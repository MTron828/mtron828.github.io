Chapter 1278: Spiritual Consciousness Not Extinguishing

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Kanuo’s howl was akin to slaughtering a pig, divulging terror and despair.

This power of Heavenly Dao was not what he could withstand at all.

Ye Yuan did not kill him; he just shackled Kanuo, making him unable to move.

“Noisy!”

Hearing that pig slaughtering-like howl, Ye Yuan was extremely irritated in his heart and fired out an arc of light with a wave of a hand.

Boom!

Kanuo’s voice immediately went mute and could not emit any sound.

His physical body directly collapsed under this blow, leaving behind only a cloud of black gas.

The black gas was also dim without light under this blow, almost dissipating.

Now, it was finally quiet.

Ye Yuan directly fired his remaining ball of vitality into Mu Lingxue’s body.

But there was not a hint of color.

Mu Lingxue’s aura was still in the midst of dissipating.

Ye Yuan shed tears as he poured colossal amounts of soul force as well as divine essence into Mu Lingxue’s body.

But this was still unable to stop the elapsing of Mu Lingxue’s life.

Drip ... Drip ...

Ye Yuan cast spells as he cried tears. Tears dripped onto Mu Lingxue’s face.

In his embrace, Mu Lingxue’s eyes were already gradually lax. But one could tell that she did not have any regrets.

On the contrary, a faint smile hung on her face, appearing very satisfied.

“Your ... Your dream ... finally came true, congratulations.”

One sentence, it virtually exhausted all of her strength.

She knew that Ye Yuan’s lifelong pursuit was the Alchemy God Realm.

At present, Ye Yuan stepped into Deity Realm. This dream naturally came true as well.

To be able to witness this scene, and also obtain Ye Yuan’s answer, and even saw Ye Yuan’s true sentiments pour out for her, she ... had nothing to be dissatisfied with.

This move, Ice Sealing Ten Thousand Miles, was a true mutual destruction.

Reversing the meridians, was the maximum degree of damage to a martial artist’s bodily functions.

What was even more terrifying was sacrificing the divine soul!

Once the divine soul was wiped out, there would no longer be this person in the world!

Once this move was unleashed, it would be irreversible, all the way until one’s life was exhausted!

Even though Ye Yuan grasped Heavenly Dao, he was not omnipotent.

Facing the elapsing of life, he also appeared so powerless.

No matter what methods he used, he was unable to stop the elapsing of Mu Lingxue’s life.

“Don’t speak anymore! You fool! Why did you have to do this?! Don’t die! You can’t die! I ... My promise hasn’t been fulfilled yet!” Ye Yuan’s heart ached to the extreme.

Mu Lingxue opened her mouth, wanting to speak. But she already could not say anything.

Color was fading frenziedly from that stunning face. Her vital functions were also rapidly dissipating.

Her divine soul was already not left with much and could not support her to talk anymore.

Seeing this scene, the human race powerhouses were all extremely moved.

Quite a number of people already had their faces covered in tears.

“Sigh, stubborn boy! Stubborn boy!”

On Fang Tian’s face, tears were already flowing from aged eyes.

Mu Lingxue’s deep love deeply shook him.

To be able to have such a soul mate was Ye Yuan’s blessing.

But it turned into such an ending.

“The Spirit Snow Divine King’s feelings touched the ninth heaven, to be so decisive for the Heaven Surmounting Divine King! She saved the Heaven Surmounting Divine King, and even saved the entire Divine Realm!”

“The Spirit Snow Divine King’s feelings for the Heaven Surmounting Divine King, it is known by all in the Divine Realm! She waited silently for many years, just to wait for the Heaven Surmounting Divine King’s one sentence, I ...” While talking, that person already choked up.

“The Spirit Snow Divine King is our benefactor! She saved all life under the heavens! Let’s pray for her together!”

This suggestion immediately obtained everyone’s recognition.

Thud, thud ...

One set in motion a bunch, a bunch spurred on a large swath.

The human race martial artists actually knelt down collectively.

“Spirit Snow Divine King, please take care!”

“Spirit Snow Divine King, please take care!”

“Spirit Snow Divine King, please take care!”

...

The tumultuous voices reverberated throughout the firmament, echoing through the entire firmament.

Ye Yuan shouted tremblingly, “Lingxue, did you hear that? Not just me, everyone in the Divine Realm, they all don’t wish for you to leave! You ... You can’t die!”

However, no matter how he shouted, Mu Lingxue was already unable to hear his voice anymore.

She slowly shut her eyes, looking like a peaceful sleeping beauty.

Ye Yuan exhausted all of his means and was also unable to salvage her divine soul from collapsing.

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth, picked Mu Lingxue up, and immediately vanished in everyone’s line of sight.

When he appeared again, he already crossed hundreds of millions of miles and arrived in the Godsfall Mountain Range.

The him who grasped Heavenly Dao could travel unhindered within this Immortal Grove Region!

“Senior, your means are exceedingly formidable! Please save her!”

Ye Yuan placed Mu Lingxue flat on the ground and directly knelt down toward Kunwu.

Kunwu gave Mu Lingxue a glance and said with a sigh, “You researched the divine soul path quite deeply and should know that sacrificing the divine soul is unsalvageable! Forget about me, even if Immortal Grove that old fart revives, he can’t save her either.”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, and he said in disbelief, “How ... How can that be? I-Isn’t he the person who created this world?”

Kunwu said, “Creating the world doesn’t mean being able to control everything in the world! Humans are the most magical species in this world! Even if he created the Immortal Grove World’s humans, he also can’t control their birth, old-age, illness, and death. His Heavenly Dao was also merely comprehended. It’s just an incomplete Heavenly Dao, that’s all. After creating this world, everything was all Heavenly Dao operating on its own.”

Crack! Crack!

Ye Yuan’s finger joints cracked, his heart aching until he was unable to breathe.

This outcome, he was really unable to accept it.

“Could ... Could it be that there’s really no way?” Ye Yuan said unwillingly.

Kunwu said, “Not that there’s no way; it’s just ... too difficult, too difficult!”

When saying the ‘too difficult’ at the back, Kunwu involuntarily aggravated his tone.

It could be seen the degree of this method’s difficulty.

But to Ye Yuan, this was undoubtedly a heavenly melody!

He looked at Kunwu with an excited look and said, “Senior, please advise! No matter how difficult, Ye Yuan has to accomplish it too!”

Kunwu said with a smile, “Something that even Immortal Grove couldn’t accomplish, can you do it?”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, but his eyes revealed a determined look very quickly, and he said, “Senior, please advise!”

Kunwu sighed and said, “No harm in telling you. But ... the likelihood of you accomplishing it is negligible! Before that, I’ll cast a secret art first. It can protect a trace of her spiritual consciousness from extinguishing. As for the matters later, it will depend on you.”

Ye Yuan’s face revealed a look of wild ecstasy, and he hurriedly said, “Many thanks, Senior!”

Ye Yuan retreated. Kunwu casually fired out nine streaks of light, inserting around Mu Lingxue. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Yuan was startled, aware that those were nine branches of Kunwu Divine Wood.

This thing was equivalent to a part of Kunwu’s body, incomparably precious.

First was the Kunwu Flower, then it was Kunwu Branches. This favor, Ye Yuan remembered it firmly in his heart.

Kunwu recited a spell. Those nine tree branches gave off a dazzling light, assimilating into Mu Lingxue’s soul.

Mu Lingxue did not react in the slightest. But Ye Yuan could sense that her last trace of divine soul was finally preserved!
