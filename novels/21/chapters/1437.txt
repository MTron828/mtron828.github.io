Chapter 1441 Breaking Through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm!

There was a fruit-like object, suspending above the island quietly, giving off a holy aura.

“That ... is the aura of Dao! It’s the aura of Heavenly Dao! What is that?”

“I feel it too! Such a powerful Heavenly Dao aura! I feel like I’ve returned to my mother’s womb!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“How magical! Why do I feel like ... Heavenly Dao is right in front of me?”

...

When everyone saw that fruit, each and every one of them revealed incomparably shocked expressions.

They could sense the aura of Heavenly Dao, but they did not know there was the existence of Dao Fruit, this sort of thing!

But Ye Yuan knew!

“That is a Dao Fruit! Sky Foothill Celestial Deity’s Dao Fruit! I didn’t expect that it was actually really found by me!” Ye Yuan said rather emotionally.

“Dao Fruit? What is that?” Bai Chen said perplexedly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Swallow it and you can become the Sky Foothill World’s master, become a paramount existence! You can even walk out of this small world and enter the true major world!”

“Hiss ...”

Everyone all sucked in a cold breath, being stunned by Ye Yuan’s words.

Each and every one of them revealed unbelievably scorching gazes, already somewhat unable to hold it anymore.

“If you all want to seek death, I won’t stop you all either!” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

How could he not know the thoughts of these people? Whoever heard of this thing would probably be moved too.

“Grand Elder, what ... what is it?” asked a Grotto Profound martial artist.

Ye Yuan said nonchalantly, “Such a precious treasure, do you feel that it would be obtained so easily? If you don’t believe me, you can go and give it a try. If you can have a little bit of bone residue left, I’ll pluck my head off for you to kick as a ball.”

That person’s head shrunk back, the heated light in his eyes instantly fading away.

Not just him, Ye Yuan’s words were like a basin of cold water, extinguishing everyone’s flames.

“Ye Yuan, Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones! On that lone island is full of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone!” Dustless said rather agitatedly.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, immediately incomparably excited.

Scattered on that lone island were all milky-white stones. They were precisely Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones!

To him, this Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone was much more valuable than the Sky Foothill Dao Fruit.

“Grand Elder, then ... what should we do now? It can’t be that we just look on like this, right?”

Ye Yuan said, “In my current state, I can’t make it through at all! This side is still considered safe. Better wait for me to recover strength first!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan sat down cross-legged on the spot and started refining the medicinal pills’ medicinal strength.

Time slowly trickled by, the others became nervous and restless.

The allure of the Dao Fruit was seriously too great. Even with Ye Yuan’s sincere advice, they could not quite hold back anymore too.

“Each and every one of you, stay in your place for me! If anyone dares to act rashly without careful thought, don’t blame me for falling out and showing no mercy!” Bai Xiu lowered his voice and warned everyone.

Regarding his actions, Bai Xiu was still constantly remembering it in his heart until now.

Hence, Ye Yuan’s words, he treated it as an imperial decree to obey now.

Furthermore, facts proved that Ye Yuan’s perception of danger was absolutely not what the rest could compare to.

If he said there was danger, then there was definitely danger!

Suddenly, the essence energy within this dome started closing in on Ye Yuan frenziedly.

Ye Yuan opened his two eyes wide, fishing out quite a few bottles of medicinal pills, and pouring all of it into his mouth in one go.

Apart from this, the Weeping Spirit Fruit left behind from breaking through the last time, Ye Yuan also swallowed all of it in one go.

When everyone saw this scene, they were all dumbfounded with shock.

“Eating ... Eating medicinal pills like this, wouldn’t one explode and die?”

“Too scary! Just what kind of cultivation method is Grand Elder cultivating? This is also too freakish, right?”

“Grand Elder actually broke through just like this! This cultivation speed ... is simply unparalleled! Could it be that the outside world’s martial artists all cultivate so quickly?”

...

Ye Yuan’s injuries had just healed when suddenly, his mind became more agile as luck hit, finally grasping that trace of opportunity to break through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm!

Of course, this was also his thick accumulations erupting, water flowing when the channel was formed!

After entering the Sky Foothill World, Ye Yuan had experienced several major fights and also experienced the death cultivation. He was just lacking an opportunity.

The brutal fight with Qin Tian previously, Ye Yuan finally grasped that trace of opportunity and successfully broke through.

But this Sky Foothill World’s spiritual energy was too thin; insufficient to support him breaking through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm. Hence, he swallowed all of the divine pills that could supplement divine essence to make up for the inadequacy.

The divine essence required for the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s breakthrough was not a tiny bit.

Not enough!

Still not enough!

The divine essence contained in these divine pills was not enough for him to break through the bottleneck at all and reach initial-stage Heaven Glimpse!

Ye Yuan’s divine sea was still expanded crazily, but the divine essence could not keep up.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan leaped and jumped straight into the huge pit!

Below was endless magma!

This scene was too suddenly, everyone all did not react and Ye Yuan jumped down already.

“Master!”

“Grand Elder!”

...

Everyone turned pale with fright, cries of exclamations sounded out everywhere, hurriedly craning their necks to look.

With this look, everyone could not help being dumbfounded with shock.

Ye Yuan actually sat cross-legged on an enormous stone stele. That stone stele emitted an archaic aura that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life which was actually even stronger than the Dao Fruit!

Below, with Ye Yuan as the center, it formed an extremely violent spiritual energy vortex.

To talk about spiritual energy, the spiritual energy in the magma was far more abundant than upstairs. Otherwise, it also would not be able to inoculate Giant Flame Stoneman, this kind of powerful creature.

Hence, Ye Yuan had a flash of inspiration and simply just absorbed the spiritual energy in the magma!

But the temperature in this magma was too high, enough to burn his whole person into nothing.

Hence, he took out the World Suppressing Stele and absorbed spiritual energy with the World Suppressing Stele as the medium.

Sitting cross-legged on the World Suppressing Stele, Ye Yuan could not feel the burning hot magma at all.

“What kind of existence is that stone stele, to actually be able to withstand the magma’s temperature! The Divine Ruins’ magma is what even grand completion Origin Deity powerhouses don’t dare to enter!”

“Grand Elder actually wants to absorb the spiritual energy in the magma to break through. This ... Isn’t this courting death?”

“Yeah! The spiritual energy in the magma is incomparably violent. Absorbing into the body will burn the meridians!”

...

However, Ye Yuan did not care at all!

He absorbed the spiritual energy in the magma greedily, then revolved the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s second level cultivation method, converting it into divine essence, gathering it into the divine sea.

The entire process was extremely smooth.

The originally incomparably violent magma spiritual energy immediately became unbelievably well-behaved under the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s refinement.

The burning power in the spiritual energy was also instantly refined away.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan’s divine sea finally stopped expanding. The divine essence in the divine sea was already completely filled too.

However, the divine essence in Ye Yuan’s divine sea became more and more viscous!

It was precisely because of so that the spiritual energy required for his breakthrough was several times, even several dozen times of other people!

“This ... is Grand Elder really a human? He ... He actually really refined the spiritual energy in the magma!”

“My God, he really broke through to the initial-stage Heaven Glimpse? Why does the feeling he gives me ... feel like a primal savage beast?”

“Simply inconceivable! Grand Elder really can’t be judged with common sense!”
