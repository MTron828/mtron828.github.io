Chapter 2405: Devastating the Divine Children Legion!

In an instant, it was as if the air solidified.

The battle that was originally fighting until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open, suddenly came to a stop.

Both sides stopped at once.

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan’s side,being shocked to the extreme.

Their chief commander, an existence close to invincible beneath Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm, was actually one-shotted in a single exchange?

It turned out that Ye Yuan did not use his full strength previously.

His True Nirvana Sword Formation was not even integrated with spacetime law.

Dealing with Tian Xu, Ye Yuan fused spatial source inside, and the power immediately increased several levels!

One had to know, before Ye Yuan went to the spacetime turbulence, his strength already crushed Wan Zhen and the rest.

Now, returning domineeringly, his spacetime law already reached an elusive realm.

Dealing with a mere peak Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm was seriously nothing much.

Forget that Tian Xu was not a divine child, even if he was a divine child, it would not be hard for Ye Yuan to kill him too!

“Chief Commander!”

“This isn’t possible! How can Chief Commander be ... dead before unleashing a single move?”

“Aren’t humans all a bunch of ants? Why is he so strong?”

... ...

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, the impact that it dealt to the Divine Children Legion was seriously too strong.

The strongest person in their legion was one-shotted by Ye Yuan!

Before this, any one of them could easily kill same-rank humans when they took action.

But now, what kind of situation was this.

Especially Nineorigin, his two eyes became wide-saucers, somewhat wondering whether he saw wrongly or not.

Was this horrifying to the extreme major power before his eyes, really that young man who stood in front of him back then, and yelled out, “Why would I, Ye Yuan, fear a fight”?

How lowly was he at that time?

But after a thousand years, this lowly youth already became a top major power that left him dead in the water.

He touched his heart and felt that he already regarded Ye Yuan highly enough. But only at the end did he discover to his dismay that he still underestimated Ye Yuan!

No way! Allowing him to continue growing unchecked, he’ll definitely be my divine race’s mortal calamity! Got to hold him back! After the three Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses come, he’ll be dead for sure! Nineorigin shouted in his heart.

Thinking up to here, he had no more thoughts in his heart and roared angrily, “What are you all still in a daze for? Everyone, attack together! Avenge Chief Commander! Kill this guy, at all costs!”

This voice immediately shattered the brief stasis.

All of the divine children were immediately startled awake.

Tian Xu’s prestige was extremely high in the Divine Children Legion. Nineorigin’s shout immediately aroused their fighting spirit.

Hence, the divine children pounced over toward Ye Yuan without heed for their lives.

They completely disregarded casualties, each and every one killing until their eyes turned red, only wanting Ye Yuan’s life.

As for the army behind Ye Yuan, they did not care about it at all anymore.

In virtually an instant, Ye Yuan’s pressure suddenly increased!

When 200 thousand Divine Children Legion pounced on a person at the same time, the combat power practically already closed in on Deva Second Blight.

A threat of death immediately rushed over.

But Ye Yuan was not alarmed when he saw this situation, but happy instead.

What he wanted was this kind of feeling!

Only a fight between life and death could stimulate his potential!

Furthermore, him sharing other people’s pressure, the others could also get corresponding training!

If let the others clash head-on with the Divine Children Legion, that would be a one-sided slaughter and not training anymore.

Although unpredictable children were strong, facing the well-trained Divine Children Legion, they still fell short by a lot.

Let alone that they were even at a disadvantage in numbers.

This situation in front of them could be said to be the most ideal state already.

Facing the Divine Children Legion’s frenzied assault, Ye Yuan could not hide his strength anymore.

The complete version of the True Nirvana Sword Formation was fully released!

In an instant, the entire battlefield seemed to have fallen into Ye Yuan’s tempo.

The profound sword formation law reverberated back and forth inside the sword formation, the power terrifying to the extreme.

However, the Divine Children Legion’s frenzied attacks similarly could not be underestimated.

The divine race only cultivated Heavenly Dao, they brought the coercion of Great Dao to contend with Ye Yuan.

One person’s strength might not be much, but 200 thousand people added together, it was terrifying.

Inside the sword formation, intense rumbling sounds erupted.

The entire battlefield already became an utter mess.

The forest in a radius of 100 thousand miles was long already razed to the ground.

But the more they fought, the more alarmed the Divine Children Legion became!

Ye Yuan’s combat power was simply hair-raisingly strong!

Him alone, practically shouldered close to half of the entire Divine Children Legion’s offensive power.

It was equivalent to him alone blocking half of the Divine Children Legion.

How could this sort of thing happen in reality?

If Ye Yuan was Deva Realm, then forget it.

But Ye Yuan was just a Heavenly Emperor Realm martial artist!

They did not dare to believe that this sort of thing was actually real.

Yet, it was happening before their eyes.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s sword formation made them want to vomit blood very much. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The advantage of numbers was diminished to the extreme by the True Nirvana Sword Formation.

It was impossible for them to want to deal with Ye Yuan like dealing with that Deva Second Blight powerhouse!

When those divine children arrived before Ye Yuan, they would be divided naturally by the sword formation, unable to form a powerful cohesive force at all.

Even for the current Ye Yuan, if he clashed head-on with the Divine Children Legion, it would be the outcome of certain death too.

Hence, he naturally would not be so silly.

However, the Nineorigin in the Divine Children Legion, the shock in his heart grew even stronger.

He was already unable to describe the feelings in his heart!

Ye Yuan’s means of one-shotting Tian Xu was actually still not his full strength!

This guy actually cultivated Sword Dao source, Formation Dao source, as well as spacetime law, to such a horrifying realm at the same time.

This kind of thing was simply too heaven-defying!

Of course, Ye Yuan himself would not be relaxed too.

The Divine Children Legion was well-trained and extremely cohesive; far from what the human army could compare to.

The extremely tragic battle still caused him significant injuries.

Even with his current strength, these divine children were very hard to kill too.

Fortunately, he was extremely tenacious and not afraid of a battle of attrition.

This was a fierce battle, true for the Divine Children Legion, and similarly the same for Ye Yuan!

It was just that Ye Yuan did not know that danger was currently slowly approaching!

... ...

Extremely far away, three streaks of flowing light actually met together without prior agreement.

“Mn? Tian Zhao, Li Qing, you guys actually came too! Looks like Tian Xu that kid ran into a considerable problem!”

The one speaking was the Profound Lineage’s Nine-marks powerhouse, Yuan Zhen. This person was precisely a divine son of the same period as Nineorigin!

At present, he already entered the realm of Nine-marks, looking down on the world, becoming a Profound Lineage ancestor-class powerhouse.

His strength was much stronger than even Deva First Blight, closing in on Deva Second Blight!

As for the other two, Tian Zhao and Li Qing, they were respectively the Heaven Lineage and Yellow Lineage’s Nine-marks powerhouses. Their strength similarly should not be underestimated.

These three people gathering together would absolutely be a nightmare to the Ye Yuan who fell into a fierce fight.

“Yuan Zhen, you actually came too! Looks like the Divine Children Legion really met its match this time. We need to hurry up! The Divine Children Legion is an important army for suppressing the world, nothing must happen!” Tian Zhao also said with a slightly dark look.

The other two deeply felt that way too and said, “Can’t delay anymore. Hurry up!”
