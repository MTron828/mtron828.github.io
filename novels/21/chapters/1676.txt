Chapter 1680 Brutally Beating Fourth-Layered Heaven!

“Shameless boasting fool! This set of array formation, your father has already used for ten thousand years. No one has ever ...”

Boss He was extremely confident in the Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation. He had used this set of array formation to trap god knows how many experts to death before. It had never failed.

But his words were just said halfway when a loud explosion sound came from inside the canyon.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Countless explosive sound interwoven together. Then a beam of light burst out of the array formation, forcefully escaping the Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation.

Boss He was startled with fright, looking at this scene in disbelief.

The Purple Extreme Hall stopped in midair, revealing Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping’s figures. Ye Yuan’s gaze was filled with killing intent.

‘No one has ever come out before,’ these few words, were forcefully swallowed back into his stomach by him.

He used an expression like he had seen a ghost to look at Ye Yuan and cried out, “Impossible! How ... How did you come out? The Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation is absolutely without chinks in its armor! How ... How in the world did you do it?”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “No chinks in the armor? How is there any array formation without weaknesses to exploit in this world? No matter how invulnerable it is, it’s also merely a rank four array formation. Just blow it up will do!”

“B-Blow it up?” Boss He muttered.

He naturally saw the explosion in the grand array. But he could not imagine what kind of explosion could blow up his array formation.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said in a cold voice, “Yeah, over 30 middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures exploding at the same time, wouldn’t it break?”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Xiang Yunfei and Boss He both could not resist shuddering.

“O-Over 30 middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures! You lunatic! H-How can you possibly have so many middle-rank mystic treasures on you?”

Boss He and Xiang Yunfei’s hearts were dripping blood. More than 30 middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures were actually gone just like that!

This guy was not only a madman, but he was also a prodigal son!

Ye Yuan originally did not have so many middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures on him. But he fleeced Zhuo Han and his junior brothers of their storage rings. They virtually had quite a few divine lord mystic treasures in each of their hands, middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures were naturally not in the minority.

Just Zhuo Han alone had seven or eight middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures!

Imperial capitals’ geniuses were indeed loaded as hell!

If not for these middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures, it would really not be easy for Ye Yuan to want to come out.

Ye Yuan had long discovered that his divine essence was very special. After injecting into middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures, it could actually detonate.

But it had no effect on high-rank divine lord mystic treasures.

Detonating more than 30 divine lord mystic treasures in an instant, it was equivalent to more than 30 middle-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouses attacking all-out.

These explosions concentrating at one point, the power in that instant practically rivaled the all-out attack of late-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

Therefore, this unassailable grand array had a crack blasted out.

One crack was sufficient!

Ye Yuan looked at Boss He with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Yeah, thanks to you, not one of the middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures on my remains! Speaking of which, I still have to thank you!”

Looking at Ye Yuan’s gaze, Boss He could not resist shuddering.

Over 30 middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures, this was a colossal sum of wealth.

Even for Ye Yuan, it also somewhat hurt.

But when Xiang Yunfei heard this, he suddenly laughed wildly and said, “Ye Yuan, you’re saying that you don’t have middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures on you anymore? Hahaha ... you fool, don’t even know how to put on an empty show of strength, to actually tell me this sort of thing!”

What he was most wary of was Ye Yuan detonating divine lord mystic treasures.

Because of this, he was blown until his realm fell the last time. Currently, he was only peak fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord and it was difficult to return to fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord anymore.

Now, Ye Yuan actually told him that he did not have middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures on him anymore. He no longer needed to be afraid anymore.

Although Xiang Yunfei could not see through Ye Yuan’s actual situation, even if he broke through, he was at the very most first-layered heaven Divine Lord now as well.

With his peak fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord strength, killing Ye Yuan was more than plenty!

Ye Yuan looked at him like he was looking at a dead man. He said coolly to Ning Tianping, “That bunch of guys will be left to you. Leave this guy to me!”

Ning Tianping nodded and said, “Your Excellency, be careful!”

Boss He was merely a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, while the others were all initial-stage Divine Lord Realm.

The battle of middle-stage Divine Lord Realm, they could not stick a hand in at all.

The moment Xiang Yunfei heard, he could not help laughing wildly as he said, “You’re saying that you want to challenge me alone? Foolish fellow, do you really think that you can go against the heavens by breaking though? Even if your father’s realm fell, I’m still middle-stage Divine Lord Realm too. Killing you ... is merely lifting a finger!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and he said nonchalantly, “Oh? Is that so?”

Swoosh!

Finished saying this sentence, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly vanished from where he stood.

Xiang Yunfei’s gaze turned sharp and he exclaimed, “So fast!”

“Universe Dragon Claw!”

Ye Yuan gave a loud cry, blue patterns flashing on his body. An azure dragon’s enormous claw suddenly reached out of the void, smacking over toward Xiang Yunfei.

The moment the dragon claw emerged, the world was alarmed!

This claw was too fast, Xiang Yunfei could not react in time at all.

Bang!

“Puhwark!”

Xiang Yunfei was directly smacked flying by a claw, fresh blood spouting wildly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of letting him catch his breath. Following that, another claw smacked out.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

...

In the sky, only to see dragon claws disappear and reappear again.

Ye Yuan was currently in a state of violent rage, venting the frustration in his heart frenziedly, pummeling Xiang Yunfei.

The battle over there had not started yet, because Boss He they all were long dumbstruck with amazement.

The battle indeed took on a one-sided situation, but it was totally different from what was imagined previously!

One-sided, but the side leaned towards Ye Yuan, and not Xiang Yunfei.

Above the sky, Xiang Yunfei already unleashed all of his abilities. But the power of this dragon claw was too strong, he could not resist all.

Ye Yuan actually used pure strength to suppress him!

Xiang Yunfei was wildly shaken in his heart. Did not expect that after Ye Yuan broke through, his strength was actually so terrifying.

His apprehension towards Ye Yuan entirely stemmed from middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures. But he discovered to his dismay that Ye Yuan’s own strength, he was completely unable to resist even a bit!

Ye Yuan was also inexplicably pleasantly surprised in his heart. Because he discovered that the dragon race martial techniques were stronger all-round.

He could feel that each time he launched a martial technique, there was a profound and mysterious power that gathered in his martial techniques, making the power of his martial techniques multiply.

Ye Yuan knew that this was all the effect of those blue patterns.

Looking at it now, these blue patterns were a good thing and not a bad thing.

Even though the dragon race’s martial techniques were strong, it was not strong to the degree where it could suppress Xiang Yunfei in all aspects.

Xiang Yunfei was a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse. Even if his realm fell, he was also not what ordinary fourth-layered heaven Divine Lords could compare to.

His strength was sufficient to sweep across fourth-layered heaven Divine Lords.

Hence, that was why he would be so confident and also dare to find Boss He for help.

Now, with these blue patterns, he could completely suppress Xiang Yunfei just by relying on the power of the fleshy body.

Sure enough, the Voice of the Dragon God previously was not a coincidence.

Xiang Yunfei only had one thought in his heart right now, that was to run!

Suddenly, blood light radiated on Xiang Yunfei’s body, his figure suddenly streaking out, flying far away in a blink of an eye.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan laughed coldly, his hands quickly forming a seal!
