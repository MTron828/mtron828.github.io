Chapter 1648 Free Publicity

“Void spirit divine-grade!” Ye Yuan lightly spat out four words from his mouth.

Zhao Jian laughed loudly when he heard it and said, “Kid, I see that you’re not here to sell medicinal pills, you’re here to swindle and deceive people, right? Claiming void spirit divine-grade, you’re not scared of spraining your tongue when bragging! In this Riverluck Capital City, there has yet to be any alchemist who dared to make this boast of being able to refine void spirit divine-grade medicinal pills. Who the hell do you think you are?”

Su Ting was not as domineering as Zhao Jian, but she also did not believe Ye Yuan’s words at all.

In her heart, she already designated Ye Yuan as a liar.

“Forget it, Eldest Senior Brother. Let’s go.” Su Ting said.

But Zhao Jian said, “Little Junior Sister, this kind of swindler at the Heavenly Network Gathering, even though it’s a last-rank stall, we can’t smash our own signboard too! Wait for me to expose this cheat, then have Martial Uncle they all chase this punk out of Heavenly Network Gathering!”

Su Ting thought about it, feeling that what Zhao Jian said had a point too. Hence, she fell silent.

Zhao Jian’s voice was very loud. Those watching a show did not mind matters blowing up.

Originally, this side was very out-of-the-way, his loud voice attracted many martial artists instead.

In this small corner, quite a number of people crowded for a moment.

“What this kid is selling is void spirit divine pills? Heh heh, most likely is a swindler, right?”

“I’ve lived for ten thousand years and have yet to see before what void spirit divine pills look like!”

“There’s all available from level one to level nine. He’s merely an Origin Deity Realm. At most, he’s also just a Three-star Alchemy God. Can he still refine level nine difficulty divine pills?”

...

Toward Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, everyone all had skeptical attitudes.

After all, void spirit divine pills were rare until it made people’s hair stand on end.

Zhao Jian looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Kid, one billion divine essence stones, is it? I’ll pay, so you take a void spirit divine-grade rank three divine pill for me to see!”

Said that he was paying, but he did not have the intention of paying at all.

Zhao Jian already ascertained that Ye Yuan was a swindler, how could he possibly be a sucker, giving Ye Yuan a billion divine essence stones?

How could Ye Yuan not see through his thoughts? He said coolly, “The money in one hand, the goods in the other. I don’t have time to play house with a snotty brat like you.”

Snotty brat?

Zhao Jian broke down. It seemed like you were not even as old as me, right?

“Pfff!”

Ye Yuan had a serious appearance, tickling Su Ting.

But Zhao Jian somewhat turned angry from embarrassment and said, “You’re not taking it out, right? I knew that you were a swindler! Humph! Snotty brat? I’m the Sword Star Alliance’s head disciple! You dare to deceive and beguile people on our Sword Star Alliance’s territory, so I’ll smash your signboard right now!”

Zhao Jian’s words made the surrounding people burst out in surprise.

They did not expect that these two people, their background was actually so prestigious.

Now, there was a good show to watch!

Sure enough, Zhao Jian directly smacked a palm over and was actually going to directly smash Ye Yuan’s signboard.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned dark and suddenly smacked a palm over, and actually reached first despite launching later.

Bang!

Zhao Jian’s entire person flew out backward. Fortunately, the surrounding people were many, the powerhouses were also quite a lot.

They propped him with palm force on account of the Sword Star Alliance’s face, that was how he was not overly wretched.

However, the surrounding people all looked at Ye Yuan with an incomparable shock.

This kid only had grand completion Origin Deity cultivation, but he smacked the half-step Divine Lord Zhao Jian flying with a casual palm.

His strength was rather daunting! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhao Jian was in a difficult position, feeling that he lost face in front of Little Junior Sister, and said in a great rage, “You dare to attack me?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “It’s not that you can’t inspect the goods. You spend money to buy a medicinal pill and you’ll naturally know the truth from false! But you were going to ruin my signboard indiscriminately! Is this how your Sword Star Alliance does things? Saying that I’m deceiving and beguiling people, it is also not that you can’t, but you must show the proof! Keep on being so arrogant and domineering, it wouldn’t be so simple next time!”

Zhao Jian could not help choking, being awed by Ye Yuan’s powerful aura.

If it was just now, he would naturally dismiss this threat with a scoff.

But now, he knew that Ye Yuan had this strength.

Just now, he indeed pulled his punches already!

But shrinking back like this, he could not stomach this. He said angrily, “Fine! I want to see what kind of panacea you’re selling! Here is a billion divine essence stones, give me a medicinal pill, I want to expose you in public!”

As he said, he smacked a storage ring on the stall.

Ye Yuan received the storage ring, checked the divine essence stones, and said coolly, “What medicinal pill do you want?”

Zhao Jian thought about it and said, “I’ll have a most ordinary Vast Essence Pill!”

Vast Essence Pill was the medicinal pill that Origin Deity Realm martial artists used to cultivate. It was similar to the Divine Essence Pill.

Divine-grade Vast Essence Pill would also appear every few years at Riverluck Capital City. Each time, it would be hiked to a sky-high price. The highest time, it even reached 80 million divine essence stones!

As for void spirit divine-grade, it never appeared once.

Looking at it this way, if Ye Yuan really took out a void spirit divine-grade Vast Essence Pill, selling for the price of one billion was considered very cheap.

Everyone’s gaze focused on Ye Yuan. Now, he even took out the money, you could not attack and beat people, right?

Under everyone’s stare, Ye Yuan fished out a storage ring, threw it to Zhao Jian, and he said coolly, “Your Vast Essence Pill.”

Zhao Jian sneered incessantly in his heart. He totally did not believe that Ye Yuan could take out a void spirit divine pill, even if it was the most ordinary Vast Essence Pill.

Pretending!

I see when you pretend until!

He reached his hand out, received the storage ring, divine sense probing inside. A surge of medicinal strength instantly impacted his divine sense.

What thick medicinal strength!

Can it ... really be void spirit divine-grade?

Now, everyone’s attention was focused on Zhao Jian. His expression changed. Everyone took it into their sights.

Everyone was extremely surprised in their hearts, could it really be a void spirit divine pill?

“Humph! At least you still have some capability in counterfeiting, making it like it’s real! But ... I want to test the pill on the spot!” Zhao Jian said with a cold smile.

Until now, he still did not believe that what Ye Yuan took out was void spirit divine-grade.

People selling fake medicinal pills naturally would not be exposed so easily.

Everyone transacted face-to-face, if it was really that easy to differentiate, they would lose all decorum on the spot.

Those people who make counterfeits had different levels. Some people’s strengths were very powerful, making the medicinal pill’s medicinal strength difficult to differentiate truth from falsehood.

But, if one tested the pill on the spot, that was different.

The effect was clear at a glance!

Ye Yuan said with a calm look, “Whatever you want.”

Real gold was not afraid of fire. Could his, Ye Yuan’s, medicinal pill, still be accused as a fake?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan understood the situation. Zhao Jian doing so was simply the best advertisement for him. He naturally did not have the reason to stop it.

Ye Yuan thought highly of himself and was not willing to do the promotion of wares.

But Zhao Jian taking the initiative to help, he also did not have reason to refuse.

Currently, this situation was simply like playing a two-man act, the coordination rather tacit.

Zhao Jian handed the storage ring to Su Ting and said, “Little Junior Sister, you come and test the pill!”

Su Ting was very curious too, hence, she took the storage ring.

Zhao Jian was already half-step Divine Lord, even if give him a spiritlink divine pill, the divine essence within his body also could not possibly increase the least bit.

Su Ting was currently peak middle-stage Origin Deity, even if this was a fake medicinal pill, it more or less still had some help to her.

To be able to make the medicinal strength so realistic, this medicinal pill naturally did not have major problems. It just had some tricks done to the quality.
