Chapter 2314: Insurmountable Peak!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Pah!

After thinking hard for more than a month, Ye Yuan finally landed another piece.

The Tai Chi diagram appeared once more; the power of Great Dao emerged.

Pah!

The Medicine Ancestor landed another piece right on the heels of him, shattering Ye Yuan’s Tai Chi diagram once more.

Overbearing!

Extremely overbearing!

The foundation of the world was constructed by Ye Yuan, it should have been led by Ye Yuan in the first place.

But the Medicine Ancestor was too strong.

This kind of might made everyone feel asphyxiated.

Only Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy had a smiling appearance, like looking at a very normal thing.

The Medicine Ancestor already had not taken action for countless years. He already became a totem.

Everyone knew that he was strong, but they did not know how strong he was.

But today, once he took action, it shocked myriad regions!

His might was unmatched, overpowering the present era!

The rules were set by me.

Alchemy Dao was ruled by me.

No matter how astonishingly talented you were, no matter how your means were exceedingly formidable, in front of this kind of powerful strength, it was all futile.

The height that he was standing at, was far from what Ye Yuan, this rising star, could hold a candle to.

The two people’s disparity was too great!

The world that Ye Yuan carefully constructed, was unbelievably deplorable in front of the Medicine Ancestor.

One look and he saw through the actual situation.

Your world was dominated by me!

The number one person in the world was this domineering!

“Second Sage is in danger! After this battle, he’ll likely sink thoroughly.”

“Second Sage is incredibly talented, since time immemorial. I thought that even if he loses, he’ll at least lose with dignity too. I didn’t expect that he actually lost so miserably!”

“It’s too miserable, there’s no strength to fight back at all! Even compared to Lord Sacred Ancestor, he’s also much worse.”

“I even thought that I could see an astonishing great battle. I didn’t expect that it’s actually one-sided. It’s not interesting anymore.”

... ...

Aside from the shock, the group of powerhouses could not help feeling dull.

Ye Yuan’s path of mythology was undoubtedly going to stop here.

The Medicine Ancestor was still the Medicine Ancestor, the alchemy world’s Heavenspan Mountain.

Of course, while it was boring, not a single person left.

The Medicine Ancestor taking action, this was a grand event that could only be encountered once every ten million years, how can it be missed?

This kind of Great Dao, even if only comprehend a trace, it would also be beneficial for life.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest had a solemn look. The shock in his heart was like thunder roaring throughout the nine heavens.

The Medicine Ancestor got stronger again!

Furthermore, it was not just a little bit stronger!

If he faced off against the current Medicine Ancestor, even if he was better than Ye Yuan, he would also not be much better.

These tens of millions of years, he was still marching on the spot, while the Medicine Ancestor already took an even firmer step toward Dao pill.

“Master, Second Sage almost can’t endure anymore! This ... is simply a rout!” Ji Mo said in surprise.

It was still his first time seeing Ye Yuan look so strained.

Every step was taken with extremely difficulty.

Wing smiled bitterly and said, “I harmed this kid!”

Ji Mo said in surprise, “Why does Master say this?”

Wing’s expression was complicated as he said, “Master always thought that this old man is a narrow-minded man, intentionally suppressing his opponents. But seeing him again today, I discovered that I misunderstood him!”

The group of disciples was shocked when they heard this, revealing disbelieving looks.

Master and Medicine Ancestor were sworn enemies, this was virtually something that everyone knew in the Priest Temple.

But what did these words now mean?

“Why does Master say this?” Ji Mo asked again.

Wing said, “This old thing is indeed narrow-minded, but on the path of alchemy, he is indeed a peerless genius that none can rival! The battle with him last time, he indeed ruined my Dao heart. But these few tens of millions of years, he integrated the essence of my Dao into his Great Dao! His strength is long already no longer what it used to be!”

The group of disciples was filled with fear, only then, understanding Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s meaning.

This alchemy path’s number one person became much stronger than back then!

This also meant that Medicine Ancestor took another big step toward the true Dao pill.

The present Medicine Ancestor already shook Sacred Ancestor High Priest off far behind.

Who else was Medicine Ancestor’s match in this world?

Only then did everyone present understand that it was not that Ye Yuan was too weak, but that Medicine Ancestor was too strong!

Reaching the Medicine Ancestor’s level of realm, it was almost impossible to make any progress anymore.

But who could have thought that he could still learn from other people’s strengths and put them to use for himself?

The present Medicine Ancestor already completely shook Sacred Ancestor High Priest off, no one could threaten him anymore.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest could not; Ye Yuan ... even less so!

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy said with a grin, “Master being the number one person on the alchemy path isn’t just being number one in strength. His talent is likewise number one in alchemy! The world all thinks that Master has long been unable to make progress anymore. But actually, he’s improving every day. Second Sage’s talent is high, perhaps even higher than Master’s, it’s just a pity that ... his accumulations are too weak.”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s expression was complicated as he said, “I harmed this kid! After this battle, his Dao heart ...”

Ye Yuan’s will was extremely tough, even far surpassing ancestor-level powerhouses’ will. Wing had a score in his heart about this.

It was just that Medicine Ancestor was too strong!

His strength already exceeded ordinary people’s understanding.

Ye Yuan ... was still too inexperienced after all.

One step forward, Ye Yuan struggled to stride forward.

Each step that he took, the time used took longer and longer.

From one month to two months, then to three months.

In a blink, several years passed, Ye Yuan only walked over a dozen steps.

However, Ye Yuan’s face did not have any anxious look. He was completely immersed in the structure of the world.

Medicine Ancestor’s Dao was incomparably tyrannical as if crushing his Dao like a giant mountain.

This was completely the disparity between two different power levels!

It was Ye Yuan’s first time experiencing the ultimate strength of Dao pill. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It also made him have a sense of powerlessness for the first time in alchemy.

Over 50 years passed in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan already had not landed a piece in ten years.

Pah!

The Ye Yuan who was akin to a withered tree finally landed his piece.

Pah!

Medicine Ancestor landed a piece right on the heels, ruthlessly crushing Ye Yuan’s Tai Chi diagram without the slightest mercy.

“Pfft!”

Ye Yuan spewed out a mouthful of blood wildly, splattering onto the chessboard.

A burst of exclamations came over, everyone understood that Ye Yuan was defeated.

The current Ye Yuan was emaciated like a stick, both eyes deeply sunken, as if his entire person was drained dry, like a seriously ill person.

“He’s still forcefully holding on! Actually, he could have surrendered long ago!”

“Ye Yuan is too weak! He doesn’t have the qualifications to face off against Medicine Ancestor at all. He doesn’t have any self-awareness at all.”

“His journey has been too smooth and he has never encountered a setback. Encountering such a huge setback this time, he’s naturally unwilling to admit defeat.”

... ...

In their view, Ye Yuan could have conceded defeat long ago.

Forcefully hanging on until now was completely keeping up appearance to cover up his predicament.

Ning Siyu grabbed Yun Yi’s clothes, practically about to tear them apart.

It was only to see her bite her lip lightly and say, “Master he ... will be fine, right?”

Yun Yi’s eyes were full of blood traces as he shook his head and said, “I don’t know. Master he might ... really be in danger this time!”

“Why? Why hasn’t he given up yet? With Master’s talent and strength, he can definitely surpass Medicine Ancestor in the future. Why must he insist on forcefully holding on now?” Ning Siyu said in tears.

“Sigh, maybe ... Master has his own thoughts!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes became more and more sunken, his person becoming thinner and thinner, his state being poor to the extreme.

But he still did not have the thought of giving up.
