1423 Teaching Disciple

Ye Yuan’s wrist shook, waving his sword down.

Whoosh!

Without any grand divine essence undulations, only a soft tearing through the air sound.

Lan Zhiru’s body suddenly turned stiff, and that steadily rising aura suddenly stopped.

Ye Yuan slowly put away his sword, his breathing appearing rather disorderly.

The expenditure for this move was really quite big for him.

“What ... What happened? The fight ... ended just like this?”

“Yeah, I only saw Lord Ye Yuan wave a sword and it’s done?”

“What move is this? Why isn’t there any undulations at all?”

...

“Puhwark ...”

Just as the people had dumbstruck faces, Lan Zhiru’s body exploded, turning into a cloud of blood mist.

Soul Devouring Blood Slaughter, this move, had yet to be used and he already died thoroughly.

The shock in Huo Tianyang’s heart could not be any greater. Lan Zhiru who used Soul Devouring Blood Slaughter was actually killed by Ye Yuan with a sword just like this!

The truth and falsehood of that sword just now, even he, this grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse, did not see through.

Outsiders looking over, it was just a casual wave; ordinary and bland.

Everyone only heard the sound of tearing through the air, and then ... Lan Zhiru exploded.

“Retreat!”

Huo Tianyang made a prompt decision, his aura suddenly erupting, forcing back the Nether Ghostclaw a bit, his figure fleeing into the distance like lightning.

As soon as he ran, how could the others still have the idea of continuing to fight? All were eager to escape.

But everyone’s strength was more or less the same. So how could wanting to run be that easy?

Therefore, the originally tangled melee became a pursuit.

The White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses became more courageous as they fought, while the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Deity Realm powerhouses fled as they fought. In an instant, they chased out 100 thousand miles away.

The Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Deity Realm powerhouses perished one after another. So much so that during the process of the pursuit, Bai Xiu had a grand display of invincible might, finishing off a Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm elder of the opposite side!

With this, the White Night Sacred Palace’s Deity Realm powerhouses felt greatly roused in spirits, marching straight in all the way, hunting down frenziedly.

Along the way, Ye Yuan followed the group of people unhurriedly.

All the way until they killed to the borders of the two great sacred palaces did Ye Yuan call out in a clear voice, “Alright, stop here!”

Only then did the White Night Sacred Palace’s group of powerhouses stop with a feeling of longing for more.

“Master Ye Yuan, why not chase further? Isn’t it good for us to follow up a victory with pursuit and destroy the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace in one fell swoop, avenging Father?” Bai Chen said puzzledly.

Ye Yuan smiled but did not speak.

Mo Yun spoke up, “Palace Lord, Lord Ye Yuan’s meaning is, don’t pursue a desperate foe! Huo Tianyang is a grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse in the end. For us to really push him into a dead end, the consequences are too ghastly to imagine.”

Bai Chen’s expression changed, discovering that Gui Yun had long disappeared already.

Most likely, the expenditure of this battle to him was rather huge too.

“I understand!” Bai Chen nodded his head and said seriously.

This fight initially was in the midst of a hopeless situation, but it concluded with a flawless victory, exceeding everyone’s expectations.

Currently, everyone was dancing for joy, like they were crazy!

“Lord Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Lord Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Lord Ye Yuan is mighty!”

...

They knew that this victory was entirely Ye Yuan reversing the hopeless situation alone!

Without Ye Yuan, the current White Night Sacred Palace would probably already be utterly destroyed.

“Lord Ye Yuan is truly a god-like figure, to actually be able to slay a Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse with Grotto Profound Realm!”

“This is an earth-shaking battle achievement, completely subverting our understanding!”

“That last sword move was simply a marvelous work of art! I, this Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm martial artist, actually completely could not see through it at all!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Everyone chimed in one after another, feeling deeply incredulous at Ye Yuan’s miraculous battle achievement.

The complete version Sundering Stars was a sword move that condensed Sword Dao laws to the extreme.

Not that it did not have any trace of divine essence undulation, but all of Ye Yuan’s divine essence was compressed into an extremely small range.

Condensed but not scattered!

This move seemed ordinary. Actually, it was a move that applied Sword Dao laws to the limits.

The burden of this move on Ye Yuan was huge too.

With his thick divine essence, he could pretty much only release one sword move.

Once this sword move failed, he would not have the strength to fight again.

...

The great battle ceasing, the White Night Sacred Palace was in jubilation.

Through this battle, Bai Chen established an exceedingly high prestige among the group of elders.

Although his strength was still very weak and he also had many lacking aspects when doing things, in terms of sentiments, everybody already accepted this new palace lord.

Moreover, behind Bai Chen even had Ye Yuan, this grand elder assisting.

Bai Chen finally gained a firm foothold in the White Night Sacred Palace.

Originally, Bai Xiu and the rest were planning on hosting a grand ascension ceremony, but it was refused by Bai Chen.

After coming back from the battlefield, Bai Chen trained in the spear art bitterly every day.

This war also let Bai Chen mature. He knew that if he could not become strong, all of the authority and all of the wealth and glory were all a fleeting illusion.

Could see, could not touch!

He did not know how long Ye Yuan would stay here still. He could only train himself to become stronger as soon as possible.

Huo ...

Huo ...

Huo ...

Bai Chen stabbed straight one spear after another, bringing along a piercing wind sound.

His spear art seemed to be no different from mortal martial artists. In reality, each spear carried the undulations of the power of laws.

This spear art was very powerful and consumed a lot of divine essence.

Very soon, dense sweat beads seeped out on Bai Chen’s forehead.

Huo ...

Another spear stabbed out. There was suddenly a blur before his eyes. An additional figure actually appeared.

Bai Chen was greatly astonished, hurriedly wanting to pull back the spear.

But this spear had an imposing momentum. He was not prepared at all. How could there be time to pull back if he wanted to?

But in the next instant, Bai Chen opened his eyes wide. His heavy spear was actually unable to advance further.

“M-Master Ye Yuan!” Bai Chen exclaimed.

Ye Yuan just extended two fingers and easily caught his spear.

Bai Chen’s heavy spear was actually unable to advance further!

“Such a soft and feeble spear, how can it kill people?” Ye Yuan shook his head and said.

Bai Chen could not help choking when he heard that and said unyieldingly, “I ... I pulled back the spear momentum just now, that’s why it would be caught by Master so easily”

He had just broken through, but Ye Yuan poured cold water on his head. How could Bai Chen not be depressed?

He knew that Ye Yuan’s strength was formidable, but he was also very confident in his own spear art.

To say that it was soft and feeble, he was unwilling to submit.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Is that so? Use your strongest move and try stabbing over. I’m standing right here.”

A hint of slyness flashed across in Bai Chen’s gaze and he said with a smile, “Master, that’s what you said!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I said it!”

Bai Chen pulled back the spear and stood there, the spear momentum on his body started gradually condensing.

“Be careful, Master!”

He knew that Ye Yuan’s strength was exceedingly powerful. Even if he used his full strength, it was also not possible to shake Ye Yuan in the slightest.

What he wanted to do was force Ye Yuan to defend!

He wanted to prove that his spear was not a soft and feeble spear.

After several breaths, Bai Chen’s spear momentum rose to the peak.

“HAH!”

Bai Chen suddenly stabbed a spear out. The powerful force made Ye Yuan’s clothes flutter wildly.

This spear was extremely fast, arriving in front of Ye Yuan instantly.

But in the next instant, Bai Chen’s gaze turned intent, revealing a look of disbelief.

Ye Yuan extended two fingers once more, clamping onto the spear tip in front of his face.

No matter how he exerted strength, he was also unable to pierce through in the slightest!
