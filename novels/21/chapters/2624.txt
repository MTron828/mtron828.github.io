Chapter 2630: Dispute!

In Shangyu Heavenly Sect’s main hall, the five great sect masters were seated according to guest and host.

The sixth seat was Ye Yuan.

Even many highly qualified Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were positioned below Ye Yuan too.

It could be seen what kind of height this battle made Ye Yuan’s status reach.

Becoming famous across the land with one battle!

Ye Yuan and Cang Yongning’s alchemy battle subverted the world’s understanding of alchemy!

Including these sect elders present, only now did they know that there was even true grade above ninth grade. It turned out that affinity was not set in stone. Only then did they know how deep the Pill Alliance’s foundation was!

In reality, after this battle, the five great sect masters’ dread toward the Pill Alliance grew deeper!!

What kind of terrifying powerhouses could such a powerful alchemy path faction groom?

Xiao Feibai was merely one of them.

“Gentlemen, for so many years, we’ve been frogs at the bottom of a well! The strength that the Pill Alliance exhibited this time astonishes this sect master greatly! Not just their alchemy path strength, but also martial path strength!”

Yang Jie’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces, his words full of solemness.

Xiao Feibai’s appearance gave the five great sect masters tremendous pressure.

When Ling Wancheng heard that, he also followed up, “The strength of that man with a cold expression is only more and not less compared to the five of us! The sensation that this alchemy battle caused is too sudden, most likely, the Pill Alliance is caught off-guard too. But, just judging from the strength that they displayed this time, the Pill Alliance’s strength is unfathomable!”

Yang Jie nodded slightly and said, “The Pill Alliance rose after Lord Zhuo went missing. This faction is very mysterious. It rarely shows its strength in front of others. All along, we only know that the heavenly alchemists that come from the Pill Alliance are very strong! But only all the way until today, do we know that they are not just strong, but strong beyond our imagination! With their alchemy path strength, they can completely create a batch of Martial Dao army whose strength doesn’t lose to us ascenders!”

Feng Xuanyi nodded and said, “The Pill Alliance boycotting my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect this time, it has likely been premeditated for a long time! They should have felt that their accumulated strength is already sufficient to go from behind the scenes to the front of the stage! They boycotted my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect in order to awe the world and reveal its strength. It’s just that they didn’t expect that my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect produced a Ye Yuan, completely disrupting their plans!”

The words of the few great sect masters made the expressions of the various sects’ elders become very solemn.

Clearly, they felt tremendous pressure too.

In the Pill Alliance, the vast majority were native powerhouses.

And native powerhouses and ascenders were naturally two camps that had clear distinctions between each other.

Even wanting to fish in troubled waters was very, very difficult.

Therefore, the Pill Alliance’s existence was like a sharp sword, suspending high above their heads.

Yang Jie said, “Presently, our Five Light Heavenly Region has already made a clean break with the Pill Alliance! Our five sects’ sect masters have already decided that from now on, our five sects will work together to completely eliminate the Pill Alliance’s forces!”

The elders trembled all over, many people’s faces revealed looks of hesitation.

A white-browed elder said with a frown, “Sect Master Yang, this matter is likely inappropriate, right? Completely breaking away from the Pill Alliance, the disciples are still fine, but how will we, these Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratums cultivate in the future?”

Although the five great sect masters already reached a consensus on this matter.

But within each sect, it was also not harmonious. Those who took issue with it were not in a minority.

In reality, with regards to the operation this time, each sect had many elders who objected to it in the first place.

Otherwise, how could it be the Pill Alliance and other sects’ turn to act wildly in the Five Light Heavenly Region’s territory? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The various sect elders that came to Cloudarch Great Nation this time were just a few.

At this time, another elder spoke up and said, “Five sect masters, just a holy son of the Pill Alliance already has such formidable strength! Then what kind of realm would the Alchemy Dao of the leader of the Pill Alliance reach? Ye Yuan’s talent and strength are indeed very strong, but can he refine grade four heavenly pills? Our five sects added together currently only has Qu Yan and Dong Rui, two grade four heavenly alchemists too! Can the Pill Pavilion take out grade four heavenly pills to support our five great heavenly sects’ Jade Sovereign Heavens?”

“No matter how strong Ye Yuan is, he’s also merely on the same level as the Pill Alliance’s holy son! He isn’t Lord Zhuo Bufan and can’t support us ascenders!”

“It’s all this brat’s fault! If not for him, we also wouldn’t have ended up in this situation with the Pill Alliance!”

… …

Yang Jie’s suggestion was strongly opposed by many elders.

Although these people were not the leaders of a sect, they had a great say in the sect.

The weight of the words that they said was very heavy.

Although the sect master was strong, it was also impossible to cover the sky with one hand in such a large sect.

Therefore, there was an alliance this time.

Hearing these elders’ ‘righteous’ objections, the five great sect masters all furrowed their brows tightly.

Being able to become sect masters, their horizons and courage were not what these elders could compare to.

Perhaps the five great heavenly sects each had their own interests. But on major issues of principle, the five people were surprisingly unanimous.

Witnessing the Pill Alliance’s might, the five people all deeply realized that they could no longer do things independently.

If the five great heavenly sects still did not band up, the crisis of the Five Light Heavenly Region would probably be arriving soon.

But these elders clearly could not see this.

In their view, immediate interests were more important.

What interests?

Heavenly pills!

Grade four heavenly pills, high quality grade four heavenly pills, only the Pill Alliance could provide them!

Therefore, they did not want to shed all pretenses of cordiality with the Pill Alliance.

Each and every one of these elders’ blood boiled with indignation, but the spearhead of the words gradually pointed toward Ye Yuan.

The fiercest one was the white-browed elder. He was the Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s Second Elder, Duan Yongchun.

“Do as I say, take Ye Yuan down and send him to the Pill Alliance to make amends and appease their wrath!” Duan Yongchun said.

“Enough!” Feng Xuanyi seriously could not listen anymore. He berated angrily and said, “Duan Yongchun, use your brain to think properly! Do you really think that the Pill Alliance is a charity? They are actually using heavenly pills to control the entire Rainclear Continent!”

Duan Yongchun sneered and said,?“Huhu,?this Duan’s words, if Sect Master Feng doesn’t like to hear it, forget it. But, these words are overly exaggerating things to raise an alarm! The Rainclear Continent is so big, how can it be what a Pill Alliance can control?”

Feng Xuanyi still wanted to say something, but Ye Yuan suddenly stood up.

The five great sect masters were taken aback, not knowing what he was going to do.

Ye Yuan slowly walked towards Duan Yongchun, but the latter was taken aback and could not help laughing as he said, “What? Master Ye is going to denounce this Duan publicly for some crimes?”

“Fool!” Ye Yuan spat out a word indifferently.

Duan Yongchun’s gaze turned sullen and he said in a cold voice, “What did you say?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I said, fool! Everyone present, you are all fools!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of the various sects’ elders changed one after another.

“Boy! A measly little Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum actually dares to insult us, deserves to die!”

“Who the hell do you think you are, to actually dare utter wild ravings! Do you really think that this elder doesn’t dare to do anything to you?”

“Sect Master Feng, does your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect discipline disciples like this?”

… …

The elders were furious and scolded Ye Yuan angrily one after another.

Ye Yuan just smiled indifferently and said, “Sorry, I’m not a disciple. This Ye is Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s elder, my status being equivalent to everyone! So, what’s wrong with scolding you fools?”
