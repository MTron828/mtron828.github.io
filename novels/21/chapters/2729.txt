Chapter 2735: Momentary Slip of the Tongue!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s Saint Exalt Waycloud! He hasn’t come into being for thousands of years. I didn’t expect that he would actually make a move this time!”

“The mystic realm trip this time actually alarmed even the Saint Exalt powerhouses! Looks like it’s not as simple as we imagined!”

“There’s a show to watch now! I want to see how this boy plans on dealing with it!”

… …

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s appearance greatly enhanced the morale of the Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s side.

No one expected that a Saint Exalt would actually be lurking among them.

Saint Exalt comprehended Heavenly Dao rules, if they had the intention of hiding, the rest definitely could not tell, just like Big Yellow.

Saint Exalt Waycloud looked at Ye Yuan and said disdainfully, “Bringing along a brute and you think that you’re invincible under the heavens already? Boy, hand over the grandmist treasure in your hands, and this exalt can spare you from death!”

The moment everyone heard, they came to a sudden realization.

Previously, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect had their faces slapped by Ye Yuan time and again, but Saint Exalt Waycloud did not take action.

In his view, this was merely a children’s squabble.

In front of a Saint Sovereign Heaven, a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven was merely so-so too.

But, when Ye Yuan took out the grandmist treasure, it was not up to him to not be moved anymore!

Grandmist treasure could only unleash their true power in the hands of Saint Sovereign Heavens.

Therefore, he made his move.

“Scram!” Ye Yuan only replied to him with one word.

His mind was currently in a whirl and he had long already lost his composure from before.

Saint Exalt Waycloud jumping out now had no other use other than infuriating him.

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “Boy, looks like you still don’t understand what’s called Saint Sovereign Heaven! Is this place your hometown? Huhu, very good!”

Done talking, Waycloud raised his hand slightly, and the entire world started trembling.

When Ye Yuan returned, he discovered that the Heavenspan World became much more stable!

If it was like before he ascended, that sword earlier would have made the Heavenspan World fall apart to pieces.

However, when a Saint Sovereign Heaven made his move, how could the momentum be of the common sort?

Seeing Saint Exalt Waycloud make his move, Wei Yu’s face was full of smugness.

Letting Ye Yuan feel sorrow like cutting into his flesh, he felt really great!

Suffering a loss time and again in front of Ye Yuan made his killing intent towards Ye Yuan climb to its peak too.

A mere Lower Realms ant, what right did he have to shit and piss on his head?

Apart from that, Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s powerhouses were also very invigorated.

Saint Exalt, was their Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s true power!

“Bullshit Saint Sovereign Heaven, is it very impressive? Big Yellow!” Ye Yuan said icily.

Actually, without waiting for Ye Yuan to give the order, Ye Yuan’s Coquettish Profligate Hoof already made an appearance.

But this time, the power of Saint Sovereign Heaven erupted!

Saint Exalt Waycloud was currently planning on demonstrating his own martial prowess. With his cultivation realm, he did not need to exert his full strength to slaughter the people of the Heavenspan World.

But Big Yellow’s hoof held tremendous power!

Saint Exalt Waycloud was caught by surprise and directly took a kick to his face.

Bang!

Saint Exalt Waycloud was directly kicked a hundred thousand feet away, his entire face bleeding, looking wretched to the extreme.

How did the current Saint Exalt Waycloud still have any airs of an expert?

One had to know, Big Yellow’s Coquettish Profligate Hoof was what even the three tribulations Saint Sovereign Heaven, Lu Zhengxin, could not withstand.

Saint Exalt Waycloud had not even reached the first tribulation yet. This kick landing, he was already seriously wounded.

He looked at Big Yellow with a look of horror, his expression changing as he said, “S-Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Just as the others did not discover that he was Saint Sovereign Heaven, Saint Exalt Waycloud also did not discover that Big Yellow was Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Currently, Big Yellow exposing his true strength, everyone felt shocked to the core.

It was not that they were stupid, but that Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were too rare.

There were only so few Saint Sovereign Heavens on the entire Rainclear Continent. They could be counted.

But who could have thought that a Saint Exalt true spirit was actually willing to be a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven’s mount?

They saw Ye Yuan ride on Big Yellow’s body with their own eyes!

Big Yellow looked at Saint Exalt Waycloud coldly and said disdainfully, “You scolded this exalt a brute just now?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s heart thumped and he hurriedly said, “N-Not at all! S-Slip of the tongue! Just now, it was just a momentary slip of the tongue!”

Big Yellow smiled coldly and said, “You wanted Master Ye’s grandmist treasure earlier?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud only felt bitterness and said, “N-No! Just now, it was just a momentary impulse!”

Big Yellow continued, “Just now, you wanted to destroy Master Ye’s hometown?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud only had a bitter smile left as he shook his head and said, “Mistake, it was really just a mistake!”

If really want a fair fight, even if Saint Exalt Waycloud was not Big Yellow’s match, it would also not be to an extent of being in such a tight corner.

But Big Yellow’s sudden hoof attack earlier really had a powerful effect.

Fighting again at this time, he had no hope at all.

So, he could only submit.

Coming here, his goal was the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm’s natural treasures.

There was completely no need to fight to the bitter end with Big Yellow right now.

The true strength that Big Yellow displayed also made all the powerhouses speculate one after another.

“Really didn’t expect that the large yellow bull is actually a Saint Exalt true spirit!”

“I heard that there’s a Saint Exalt in the Myriad Demons Mountain whose true body is that of a bull, could it be him?”

“Hang on! Why would a Lord Saint Exalt willingly be a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven’s mount? Just what background does that young man have?”

… …

At this time, there were a series of question marks above everyone’s heads.

This kind of thing, they could not figure it out even if they racked their brains too. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, Ye Yuan ignored their guesses and just said coolly, “Cripple that guy and this matter will be considered dropped. Otherwise, it’s irreconcilable till death! No one can think about entering the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm without determining a victor!”

But when he spoke, Ye Yuan pointed at Wei Yu.

This guy had already been jumping up and down a few times.

Previously, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to haggle over it with him. But now, Ye Yuan was very angry and very irritable, so he was going to take action!

When Wei Yu heard that, his expression could not help changing wildly and he said, “Who the hell do you think you are, to actually dare command a Saint Exalt what to do? Saint Exalt Waycloud, I’m the successor appointed by Sect Master! Y-You can’t get turned against me!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud gave a cold snort and suddenly pointed a finger out.

Boom!

Wei Yu was directly blown into a cloud of blood mist.

The Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s successor died just like that!

Everyone was silent like cicadas in winter.

From Jadetrue Heavenly Sect to the Heavenspan World, they were all waiting to watch Ye Yuan make a fool of himself.

But in the end, Wei Yu became the fool, and the Seven-star Heavenly Star became the joke!

It was actually a Saint Exalt true spirit following by Ye Yuan’s side!

Even Saint Exalt Waycloud, this kind of powerful existence, had no choice but to submit too.

Saint Exalt Waycloud drew a deep breath and said, “Are you satisfied with this?”

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and said, “I know that there are still some hidden Saint Sovereign Heavens among you guys. You all go to the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm to vie for your lucky chances! I’m very vexed right now, so don’t provoke me! I used my life to guard this world. Whoever dares to touch a single hair of it, I’ll never rest until he’s dead!”

This was a blatant threat, but the powerhouses present did not dare to really provoke Ye Yuan anymore.

He had the capital to threaten everyone!

Moreover, they all came to seek lucky chances.. There was no need to make trouble with Ye Yuan.
