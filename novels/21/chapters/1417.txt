1421 Writing a Myth!

“What are you still in a daze for? What I said earlier, you forgot it all?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Bai Xiu and the rest trembled all over and cried out fiercely, “Kill! Fight to the end and absolutely not shrink back!”

The rest were inexplicably stimulated too, pouncing over together.

Everyone came harboring the resolve to die, but did not expect that Ye Yuan actually had the ability to resist the grand completion Heaven Glimpse Huo Tianyang!

The hot blood was still there, but they did not need to die.

At this time, Gui Yun already clashed fervently together with Huo Tianyang. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Nether Ghostclaw was extremely powerful. Matching up against Huo Tianyang, it did not fall into a disadvantage in the slightest!

“Master Ye Yuan, thank you!” Bai Chen said gratefully from the bottom of his heart having barely escaped with his life.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What you just did was pretty good!”

Bai Chen was like a child who was being praised, excited until he did not quite know what to do. He smiled bashfully and said, “R-Really?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Giving a peach, repaying with a plum! You treated them with a sincere heart, so they will naturally support you too! However, in the martial artist world, strength is forever the kingly way!”

Bai Chen’s gaze revealed a determined look as he nodded and said, “Master, I got it! If we can defeat the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace in this battle, this disciple will definitely cultivate hard!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s no if, we’ll definitely win!”

“Truly shameless boasting! I wonder if you’ll still be so conceited if you know that you’re going to die!”

Bai Chen was suddenly startled. It turned out that an expert from the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace already arrived not far from them since no idea when.

Ye Yuan did not reveal a surprised expression. He just said coolly: “Conceited? Very sorry, I have never been conceited.”

Bai Chen said worriedly, “Master, he’s Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s ninth elder, Lan Zhiru, initial-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouse! We ... We already don’t have Heaven Glimpse powerhouse on our side!”

At this time, both sides were in a tangled melee, but the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Heaven Glimpse powerhouses had one more person!

Lan Zhiru could not find an opponent. He thought of coming to kill Bai Chen and Ye Yuan at the first moment.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You retreat to one side.”

Bai Chen’s gaze turned intent and he said disbelievingly, “Master, you want to deal with him alone? He ... He’s a Heaven Glimpse powerhouse! Come, men! Quickly come, men! Everybody, deal with Lan Zhiru together!”

Ye Yuan used a hand gesture to stop Bai Chen and said coolly, “No need. You go and help the others, leave this guy to me!”

Bai Chen’s expression changed, not knowing where Ye Yuan’s confidence came from.

Grotto Profound Deity Realm fighting Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm one-on-one, was this a joke?

Lan Zhiru looked at Ye Yuan and said disdainfully, “Arrogant fellow, you think that by bringing along a Ghost Dao powerhouse by your side, you’re invincible? If I didn’t guess wrongly, you should only be Grotto Profound Realm, right?”

He discerned from Bai Chen’s reaction that Ye Yuan was definitely a Grotto Profound Deity Realm.

Reckon that he carried some strength concealing divine artifact on him, that was why he could not see through his depths.

Except, this Grotto Profound Deity Realm was so conceited, to actually dare go one-on-one with him.

What a joke!

Ye Yuan slowly pulled out the Evil Extermination Sword and said with a calm look, “So what?”

Lan Zhiru laughed loudly and said, “So what? In front of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, Grotto Profound Deity Realms are ant-like existences! Since ancient times, there has never been an instance of Grotto Profound Realm defeating Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, do you think that ... you’re writing a myth?”

Ye Yuan cracked a smile and said, “Is that so? Then I’ll ... write a myth!”

Lan Zhiru had yet to retort back in time and Ye Yuan already moved!

Sundering Stars!

The cutting edge of the sword drew a beautiful half-moon, bringing along a heaven-shocking Sword Dao law, and chopping down towards Lan Zhiru!

This sword move was swift to the extreme, not giving Lan Zhiru any time to react at all.

Although Lan Zhiru was alarmed, he did not panic. Since he could not dodge, then raise the sword to block.

How strong could a mere Grotto Profound martial artist’s sword be?

But when this sword’s light landed on his sword, an overwhelming force instantly spread to his whole body from the sword body!

Clank!

Lan Zhiru’s body was akin to a cannonball, being dropped by Ye Yuan rapidly from the air.

Boom!

Lan Zhiru’s body was smashed heavily into the ground, smashing out a deep pit!

When Bai Chen saw this scene, his eyeballs were almost popping out.

This ... This was also a little too powerful, right?

Was Master Ye Yuan ... really a Grotto Profound Deity Realm?

Bai Chen suddenly felt that his understanding was completely being subverted!

“Are my eyes f*cking failing? Is Lord Ye Yuan really a Grotto Profound martial artist, actually bringing down Lan Zhiru with a sword!”

“No mistake, the strength that Lord Ye Yuan used earlier was Grotto Profound Deity Realm and did not surpass this realm!”

“A Grotto Profound martial artist is actually able to overpower a Heaven Glimpse powerhouse, this ... this is too inconceivable!”

“A myth! This is absolutely a myth! Since time immemorial, there has never been a Grotto Profound martial artist capable of leaping realms to overcome Heaven Glimpse powerhouses! Lord Ye Yuan, he ... actually did it!”

...

This scene was overly shocking, even alarming the crowd who were currently in tangled warfare.

Especially those Grotto Profound Deity Realm martial artists, the White Night Sacred Palace’s side occupied a considerable advantage.

This point was naturally credited to Ye Yuan slaying over a dozen of the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Grotto Profound powerhouses with one sword.

Not just the Sky Foothill World, even in the Heavenspan World, there were totally no Grotto Profound martial artists capable of overcoming Heaven Glimpse powerhouses too!

Even Jin Yu, that kind of genius with extremely deep comprehensions into Sword Dao laws, could not do this either.

Between Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm and Grotto Profound Deity Realm, these two major realms, there was an insurmountable chasm.

Heaven Glimpse powerhouse could completely rely on the suppression of realm and forcefully crush Grotto Profound martial artists.

In the Sky Foothill World, this kind of place, it was even less likely for a situation of jumping realms to battle to happen.

But now, this mythology actually appeared in front of them!

How could they not be shocked?

Swoosh!

Lan Zhiru sprang out from the ground and flew high in the sky once more, facing off with Ye Yuan.

“Damn it! You despicable person, to actually dare ambush!” Lan Zhiru cursed.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and he taunted, “Ambush is it?”

Lan Zhiru’s expression was incomparably ugly. Regardless of whether he admitted it or not, that sword move earlier had indeed posed a great threat to him!

If not for his timely block, that sword could have taken his life!

Until now, his arm was still numb.

The power of that sword move was too terrifying!

He was completely unable to imagine, a Grotto Profound Deity Realm martial artist actually could unleash such a terrifying sword move!

Clearly seemed to be an ordinary and insignificant slash, but transmitting onto his sword, it was actually able to produce such a tremendous force.

This guy’s utilization of the power of laws had simply reached the acme of perfection!

“Humph! Don’t you get cocky! This seat admits that your strength is pretty good, it’s just too bad that you’re still only a Grotto Profound martial artist in the end! Such a formidable martial technique, you probably can’t unleash more than a few sword moves, right? Your outcome is just death in the end!”

Lan Zhiru shouted fiercely, raising his sword and attacking!

“Spirit Devouring Nine Swords!”

“Sundering Stars!”

A Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, a Grotto Profound Deity Realm, two silhouettes, clashed together in the midst of everyone’s dumbfounded eyes.
