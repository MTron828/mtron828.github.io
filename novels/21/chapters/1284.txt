Chapter 1288: Spatial Storm!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Ye Yuan was still in the Divine King Realm, three great fiendgods joining hands were also unable to breach his defense.

Breaking through to the Deity Realm now, his defense was god knows how many times stronger compared to back then.

But even so, Ye Yuan could not endure the turbulent spatial flow that surged over from all directions very soon.

His divine essence was being rapidly consumed, his physical strength was also being depleted quickly.

At the rate of this speed of consumption, before long, he would be utterly swallowed up by these violent spatial turbulent flows.

“Sigh, kid, I told you not to come, but you insisted on coming! Now, you know that Kunwu and I weren’t joking around with you, right?”

In his sea of consciousness, Dustless’s voice rang out.

How could Ye Yuan’s huge consumption of physical strength and essence energy hide from his eyes?

This was still the beginning, and Ye Yuan already almost could not bear it anymore.

Continuing forward would be facing certain death.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “If Senior has time to laugh at me, might as well help me think of a way!”

“Heh, passing through the turbulent spatial flow, you can only rely on your own strength. I can’t protect myself currently, how can I help you?” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only grit his teeth and endure forcefully.

Ye Yuan carefully avoided the spatial fragments while gritting his teeth and resisting the impact of the turbulent spatial flow.

At the start, Ye Yuan’s speed was very fast.

But very soon, it became very hard for him to move his feet.

Although this process was painful, Ye Yuan was still able to accomplish slow progress by relying on his powerful defensive strength.

Cultivating the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art to the Divine Dao first level, Ye Yuan’s defensive strength was even stronger compared to those middle-stage, even late-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouses back then!

Coupled with the Domain of Sword, Ye Yuan’s defensive strength could absolutely rival those in the Grotto Profound Deity Realm grand completion!

Ye Yuan still had this bit of confidence.

Time slowly passed, the Dustless inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl was also shocked by Ye Yuan’s willpower.

According to the Divine Realm’s time, Ye Yuan already walked in this turbulent spatial flow for seven days and nights.

Logically speaking, Ye Yuan should have long reached his limits.

But, by relying on his willpower and exquisite control over divine essence, he forcefully sustained for seven days and nights.

The Divine Realm had long been devoid of divine rank spirit medicines already. Ye Yuan did not have divine pills’ formulas either. Hence, there was no way to refine divine pills at all.

Even arcane insight rank’s mystic grade medicinal pills had no effect at all on the current Ye Yuan too.

Without the support of medicinal pills, Ye Yuan could only rely on his own strength.

In this place, Ye Yuan unleashed his advantages of an alchemist to the limits.

His control over the Domain of Sword could be described using harsh.

If he could use a fraction of divine essence, Ye Yuan absolutely would not use a trace more of divine essence!

Humans would erupt with tremendous potential under a critical state.

In seven days’ time, Ye Yuan’s exquisite control aspect of divine essence actually improved even further.

This point, Dustless also secretly expressed his wonder.

Except, even if Ye Yuan lasted seven days and nights, it was also just taking the first step of a ten thousand miles long journey.

According to Dustless, wanting to pass through this sea of space required two months’ time!

The further back, the more powerful the turbulent spatial flow would become, while Ye Yuan’s consumption would also be greater and greater.

Hence, even if Ye Yuan lasted seven days and nights, Dustless was not optimistic about him at all either.

In just seven days’ time, Ye Yuan’s divine essence was already exhausted by more than half.

The remaining journey, this kind of consumption would only increase more and more. What would he use to tide over the journey at the back?

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed. The energy undulations around him actually became even more violent all of a sudden.

In virtually an instant, the pressure on Ye Yuan’s body skyrocketed, the divine essence and physical strength consumption suddenly becoming several times faster.

Ye Yuan’s expression became incomparably ugly. At the rate of this consumption speed, he could not sustain for very long.

“Senior, what’s going on here?” Ye Yuan asked Dustless.

Dustless’s expression was also incomparably ugly as he said in a solemn voice, “Your luck is really booming! This ... This is a spatial storm!”

“Spatial storm?” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed even tighter.

This name did not sound like a jackpot, no matter what.

Dustless said, “A spatial storm is a situation when two enormous spatial fragments collide into each other, and then shatter apart, throwing the energy inside the sea of space into complete havoc. Just like a tsunami at sea, the spatial turbulent flow’s berserk extent will instantly increase several dozen times, even several hundred times! It’s just that this spatial storm might not be encountered even once in several decades normally! I didn’t expect that you ran into it! Ye Yuan, turn back! Once a spatial storm kicks up, you absolutely can’t pass through the turbulent spatial flow!”

Clearly, even Dustless was also very apprehensive of this spatial storm.

Ye Yuan sucked in a cold breath. Increasing several dozen times, even several hundred times, he could not withstand it with his strength at all.

This was truly rain pouring throughout the night when your roof was already leaking. Ye Yuan did not expect that his luck was actually so good, encountering this kind of thing.

Ye Yuan’s expression flickered incessantly, his heart was also struggling incessantly.

The surrounding energy undulations became stronger and stronger, virtually going to shred his entire person up.

This was still just the beginning. Moving forward, the spatial storm would get even more terrifying!

Terrifying until one was unable to imagine it!

“Ye Yuan, what are you still in a daze for? A spatial storm is absolutely not what you can resist alone! Even if a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse enters the center of the storm, it’s a road that leads to death too!” Dustless said urgently.

He did not wish for Ye Yuan to die just like this. That way, he probably would not have the possibility of waking up the next time already.

The Immortal Grove World’s Heavenly Dao already could not sustain for that long anymore.

But Ye Yuan was still hesitating.

“Hurry, Ye Yuan! You won’t make it if you’re any slower!”

Ye Yuan suddenly clenched his teeth and urged his essence energy and physical strength to the limits, and plunged headlong into the storm!

“Are you mad, Ye Yuan?” You’re courting death here!” Dustless said with a furious roar.

He did not think that Ye Yuan actually did not retreat. He advanced instead, marching into the spatial storm. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan did not speak. His gaze was incomparably firm, entering the spatial storm without any hesitation.

This spatial storm’s scale was massive. Ye Yuan was already brought inside by the storm. Even if he escaped, he might not be able to get out either.

Turning back again at this time, his essence energy and physical strength might not be able to sustain him to return to his starting point as well.

Therefore, he chose to move forward!

Since he came here, there was no road back anymore.

Being overly cautious and indecisive, he would die even quicker instead.

“Lunatic! You lunatic! You fool who overestimate your own ability! Ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! Do you think that by controlling Heavenly Dao, you can consider everybody and everything beneath your notice? Let me tell you, in the Heavenspan World, you’re mere an ant ...”

Dustless howled inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness. But no matter what he said, Ye Yuan turned a deaf ear too.

He clung stubbornly to his own course and advanced forward, urging essence energy and physical strength to the limits.

Violent energy sliced on Ye Yuan’s body akin to sharp knives.

Very soon, his defense could not support it anymore.

Ye Yuan’s body was sustaining a tremendous impact.

Ye Yuan mustered up the Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art, repairing the injuries within his body frenziedly.

The spatial storm became more and more rampant, ravaging Ye Yuan’s fleshy body crazily.
