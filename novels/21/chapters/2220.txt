Chapter 2224: Blood Yama Hall Master!

“What? It’s you!” Empyrean Cloudburst’s heart shook wildly, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment.

It was not that they did not believe it, but Ye Yuan was seriously too young.

They always thought that the one who injured Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

Who knew that it was actually such an Empyrean Realm young man!

Furthermore, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was already injured for more than a thousand years.

A thousand years ago, what strength was Ye Yuan at? How could he possibly injure Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang until like that?

That was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, right?

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses had extremely tenacious life force and were extremely hard to kill.

But when Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang fled back, he was already weak until being no different from almost dead.

An Empyrean could injure a Heavenly Emperor until like that?

If they knew that Ye Yuan was just Divine Vestige Realm when he injured Jiu Shang, which was also Celestial Deity Realm, no idea how they would feel.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What? Don’t believe it? Call him out and you’ll know!”

Swoosh!

Right at this time, on a distant peak, a cloud of black fog whirled away, the speed swift to the extreme.

A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, taking a stride out, traveling ten thousand miles in an instant!

In a flash, Ye Yuan actually reached first despite launching later, blocking in front of the black fog.

“Spatial law!” The pupils of the group of fiend race Empyreans shrunk, exclaiming in surprise.

“Brat, you’re courting death!” Inside the black fog, an astonishing angry roar came over.

A horrifying energy undulation directly shrouded toward Ye Yuan.

This aura was actually late-stage Empyrean!

Although Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang had not recovered his strength, he already had late-stage Empyrean strength.

This sudden scene made everyone’s faces change wildly.

“Younger Brother Ye, careful!” Empyrean Chaoyuan cried out in shock.

A fiend race Empyrean said with a cold smile, “Huhu,

reckless and blind thing!”

A starving camel was still bigger than a horse. No matter how injured he was, Jiu Shang was still a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After a thousand years of rest and recuperation, even if Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang did not recover to his peak, it was also not what everyone could block.

Ye Yuan’s face was rippleless like an ancient well, lightly opening his mouth unhurriedly.

“Immobilize!”

Time became still!

Space froze!

“Heretic Dragon Dominating Space!”

With another leisurely sentence, an enormous dragon emerged out of the void, thrusting a claw toward the black fog.

Rumble!

The speed that the black fog returned was faster than when it went!

This claw directly kicked him to the foot of the mountain pass gates!

Ye Yuan leisurely took a step and returned before the mountain pass gates amidst everyone’s dumbfounded gazes.

“This ... This ... What happened?” A fiend Empyrean’s gaze was sluggish, still not quite understanding what happened just now.

Wasn’t Ye Yuan going to die?

Why was Lord Jiu Shang kicked back in an instant?

Empyrean Chaoyuan’s gaze turned intent and he exclaimed, “That’s Heavenly Dao True Word! In that instant earlier, he freezed space!”

The Empyreans sucked in a cold breath, their gazes full of horror.

After Ye Yuan returned, he displayed astonishing alchemy strength.

But he had never exhibited his martial strength in front of people before.

Today, he used two innate divine abilities consecutively, shocking everyone until they stared dumbfounded with their mouths agape.

These two paramount dragon race innate divine abilities were too domineering!

Empyrean Cloudburst muttered, “Spatial law, Time Freeze, cracking an emperor formation ...This ... Who the hell is this guy?”

“Impossible! This is impossible! It’s just been a short thousand years! How can your strength possibly advance so quickly?” In the black fog, came Jiu Shang’s frustrated sounding cry.

The voice was filled with alarm and terror.

Thinking back then, he transformed into Tang Yan and infiltrated into the Immortal Grove World, Ye Yuan was still just a Celestial Deity Realm little fellow.

At that time, Ye Yuan was merely an ant-like existence in his eyes!

He, an exalted Heavenly Emperor, did not take Ye Yuan seriously at all.

All of Jiu Shang’s attention was on Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

But now, merely over a thousand years’ time had passed. Not only did Ye Yuan enter the ranks of Empyrean, his strength could even forcefully contend with a late-stage Empyrean!

This kind of improvement could simply be rated as monstrous!

One had to know, this brat was merely a little crawling bug that walked out of the Immortal Grove World!

But now, a little bug trampled him, this Heavenly Emperor, underfoot!

Ye Yuan looked at the black fog, his gaze slightly cold as he said, “Jiu Shang, our score should also be settled properly!”

Suddenly, the void trembled, several dozen figures appeared in the sky above Fiendflame Mountain.

These several dozen figures were actually all Empyreans!

One of them was dressed in black robes, being well-built and full of power and grandeur. His aura was extremely thick. It was shockingly a Heavenly Emperor!

Seeing this scene, the human Empyreans’ faces changed suddenly.

No one would have thought that the fiend race would actually have so many powerhouses jump out all of a sudden.

With this, both sides’ strength suddenly reversed!

“Hahaha ... Boy, do you think that this Heavenly Emperor would resign myself to death? Since you’re walking right into a trap, then this Heavenly Emperor will send you on your way to go accompany Old Fart Immortal Grove!” In the black fog, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang laughed wildly.

“Blackfuse, help me kill this boy!” Jiu Shang said to that Heavenly Emperor.

Blackfuse’s gaze turned toward Ye Yuan, but he did not make a move immediately. He started sizing up Ye Yuan.

Suddenly, he opened his mouth and said, “Boy, you’re ... Source Night?”

Ye Yuan beamed and said, “You’re the Blood Yama Hall Master?”

Ye Yuan was very clear about the outfit of these people. It was precisely the Blood Yama Hall when he infiltrated into the fiend race back then!

Back then, his horizons were not broad, and even thought that the Blood Yama Hall was merely a faction that depended on Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang.

He did not expect that there was actually still a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse in this Blood Yama Hall!

Blackfuse shook his head and said, “The Blood Yama Hall spread all over the fiend race. It’s much more powerful than you imagine, this emperor is just a branch hall’s hall master, that’s all. Rather, it’s you! In just 2000 years, you actually already broke through to middle-stage Empyrean, truly terrifying talent!”

Ye Yuan scammed the Blood Yama Hall back then and brought away the entire Purple Extreme Hall, becoming the target of the entire Blood Yama Hall’s pursuit.

This matter was naturally just a tiny sea-spray to a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, being not worthy of paying attention to.

But this Source Night triggered Great Dao Heavenly Melody, and he changed the Fiend Medicine Hall, making the strength of Capone Capital City’s fiend apothecaries multiply.

This matter had once caused a stir in the entire Blood Yama Hall’s Fiend Medicine Halls for a period of time. Even the Fiend Medicine Halls in imperial cities and imperial capitals headed to Capone Capital City to learn from their experience.

Presently, that batch of fiend race alchemists that Ye Yuan nurtured back then, they already became the fiend race master-level alchemy masters. Their statuses were venerated.

After over 2000 years passed, the tiny action that Ye Yuan took against the fiend race alchemists back then, changed the entire fiend race’s alchemy world!

Of course, this was all events after Ye Yuan left.

It was also precisely because of this that Blackfuse had once specially asked for Source Night’s drawing. He memorized Ye Yuan’s appearance.

Back then, Ye Yuan transformed into Source Night. His appearance was not altered greatly, so Blackfuse recognized him with one glance.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I didn’t expect that a measly little Origin Deity Realm martial artist actually caught the attention of a Heavenly Emperor. Should this Ye feel honored or not?”

But Blackfuse shook his head and said, “Looking at it now, my attention to you was still too little! But speaking of which, this Heavenly Emperor still has to thank you!”

Blackfuse recounted the matter of the Fiend Medicine Hall, making everyone have shocked faces.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan actually still had such a past.
