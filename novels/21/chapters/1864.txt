Chapter 1868: Heaven Killing Sword Formation

Rumble!

The earth trembled, the whole world in shock.

Inside the Law Enforcement Hall was long in a chaotic mess.

“What happened again? Why does it feel like ... it’s the apocalypse?” Fang Tian’s expression was very ugly, a foreboding feeling lingering in his heart.

At present, Fang Tian was the controller and knew everything about the Immortal Grove World like the back of his hand.

Just earlier, a primeval-like force suddenly barged into the Immortal Grove World.

That force made even him, this controller, feel palpitation.

Skydistant, Lu Linfeng, Teng Yun, and the rest of the powerhouses naturally sensed this horrifying aura too, coming over one after another.

“Elder Fang, what happened?”

“Why is our Immortal Grove World always dogged by misfortune and disasters? Sigh!”

Everyone clamored to get a word in. Some grumbled, some were helpless, but even more were alarmed and panicky.

Fang Tian shook his head and smiled bitterly as he said, “This ... I don’t know what happened as well. This aura, I can feel that it’s very similar to the World Locking Gate’s aura. But it’s in the direction of the Godsfall Mountain Range. My perception ... isn’t able to extend over.”

Everyone’s faces changed. Even Fang Tian this controller was unable to perceive it, this matter was definitely huge.

Right at this time, a figure appeared out of thin air, his expression solemn.

“Everyone!”

Seeing the arrival clearly, everyone’s face was wild with joy!

Indeed, whenever the Immortal Grove World was in danger, Ye Yuan would always show himself.

“Ye Yuan, it’s really great that you came back! Something seems to have happened over at the Godsfall Mountain Range that side ...”

Fang Tian spoke halfway when Ye Yuan interrupted his words by saying, “Senior Fang Tian, I entered the Immortal Grove World from over there! This incident is likely not so simple. A large group of Heavenspan World powerhouses entered the Immortal Grove World and might make the Immortal Grove World fall apart to pieces!”

When everyone heard that, each and every one of them had ashen looks.

They did not expect that the state of affairs would actually be so serious.

“Ye Yuan, this ... what is going on here?” Fang Tian’s face changed as he said.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know either! But one thing is certain, this is a set up arranged by Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove. But what his goal is, I can make nothing of it. This matter has already exceeded my control. Senior Fang Tian, what you all have to do next is to stabilize the Immortal Grove World! Starting from now, everyone is prohibited from entering the Godsfall Mountain Range. You all rest assured, unless I die, I won’t let the Immortal Grove World be broken into pieces! Alright, not saying anymore, I’ll be leaving now. Remember, make sure not to enter the Godsfall Mountain Range!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared before everyone again.

Everyone’s faces had solemn looks. They felt pressure from Ye Yuan.

The Ye Yuan in the past had always been calm and composed. But this time, he seemed to be somewhat different from usual.

After the crisis of the fiend race, they seemed to have not seen Ye Yuan so anxious before anymore.

Someone as powerful as the Heavenly Sin Heretic God was also toyed by Ye Yuan in the palm of his hands.

Figure flashing, Ye Yuan returned to the Godsfall Mountain Range once more.

But the expression on his face became even uglier!

The Kunwu Divine Wood that originally towered into the clouds actually disappeared without a trace already.

“Senior, Senior Kunwu he ...”

Dustless shook his head and said, “I don’t know either! At that time, I’d already fallen into slumber. The matter between him and Immortal Grove, I’m not aware of it.”

Ye Yuan’s brows knitted even tighter. He seriously could not figure out just what on earth Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was doing, to actually draw so many powerhouses to his lair.

Especially that even the Kunwu Divine Wood which was unwavering for ten thousand years already disappeared into thin air now as well!

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “I keep feeling that this matter isn’t so simple. Forget it, take it one step at a time then. Just hope that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove doesn’t use his own small world as a chip!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan’s figure moved once more, disappearing.

...

“Heaven Killing Sword Formation! There are a total of nine levels of power. Those who clear three levels can enter the next mountain peak. People who clear the six levels will be awarded a true god mystic treasure. Those who clear nine levels will be awarded an empyrean spirit treasure!”

On a mountain peak, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s voice sounded out once more.

Ahead, an enormous sword formation spanned in front of the group of powerhouses.

At this time, everyone already saw that on that tallest mountain peak far away, there was a large palace, emitting an aura that made people’s hearts palpitate.

Anyone could guess that the true treasures were likely inside that palace.

However, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s words still drove the group of powerhouses into a frenzy.

Empyrean spirit treasure!

That was something that made Empyrean powerhouses go crazy for. Now, it was right in front of their eyes!

But they also knew that wanting to clear the level nine difficulty was practically something impossible.

But if one could clear the level six difficulty, obtaining a true god mystic treasure was also very decent.

Those True God powerhouses, not everyone had a true god mystic treasure.

This kind of thing could be encountered but could not be hoped for.

“Let me!” A Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity martial artist could not resist and was the first to challenge the formation.

No one stopped him. There would always be someone who would spearhead the attack. This person going to probe the sword formation’s power was also a pretty good choice.

Swoosh!

That powerhouse leaped and entered straight into the Heaven Killing Sword Formation.

Immediately, countless sword lights came whistling from all directions.

That Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity’s strength was indeed intrepid. No matter how strong the sword lights were, they could not do anything to him.

“Fan Ming’s strength is indeed formidable. Heard that he once challenged three powerhouses of the same rank without being defeated. His strength is rather powerful among itinerant cultivators!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Looking at it, he might be able to obtain a true god mystic treasure!”

“Tsk tsk, Celestial Deity Realm and possess a true god mystic treasure, really envious!”

...

Fan Ming clearly had some fame among the itinerant cultivators.

The moment he made his move, the others all gasped in admiration.

At the same time, they also had a clear understanding of the sword formation’s power.

Furthermore, Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity was a tier-one team powerhouse among these powerhouses to begin with.

Sure enough, Fan Ming’s strength was intrepid, clearing the level three difficulty sword formation very quickly.

Then, a transmission array appeared in the corner of the grand array.

“Now, you can choose to leave and can also choose to carry on challenging!” Inside the grand array, a voice sounded out.

“I choose to continue challenge!” Fan Ming said without the slightest hesitation.

In the wake of his voice fading, that transmission array disappeared. The grand array started operating again.

All of a sudden, the situation changed drastically!

Inside the Heaven Killing Sword Formation, a series of horrifying sword energy practically turned corporeal, passing through the sword formation.

Although the group of powerhouses was outside the sword formation, they felt like the series of terrifying sword intent was virtually piercing through them!

Terrifying!

The difficulty of this fourth level soared several times all at once!

Fan Ming’s expression changed drastically. But it was already too late for him to want to regret it now.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

One sword light after another arrived with a whistle. How could Fan Ming still dare to dawdle, bringing out 120% of his ability immediately.

Puchi!

A sword light pierced right through his protective divine essence, tearing through his body.

Following the first sword light landing, countless sword lights rained down like a web, puncturing Fan Ming into a sieve.

Outside the sword formation, it was death-like silence.
