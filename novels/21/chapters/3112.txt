Chapter 3111: Kneel Down!

An atmosphere of despair pervaded the world.

With these two great supremacies joining hands, no matter how powerful the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List, it was impossible to block them too!

“Mi Tian, didn’t expect it, right? Today, no one can save Ye Yuan! He must die!” Heavenless said with indignation.

Even a powerful overlord such as him had repeatedly suffered losses in Ye Yuan’s hands. He really even wanted to die.

Samsara looked at Mi Tian and said coolly, “Mi Tian, there aren’t many of those from our era who are still living in this world! This progenitor will give you a chance: hand Ye Yuan over, and I’ll spare you from death!”

Mi Tian said without even thinking: “No need! This world can be destroyed, but it can’t surrender!”

Samsara’s pupils constricted, killing intent immediately rising from his body.

He discovered that although those ants within the world were in despair, of them shrunk back.

At this point, there was also no one who begged for mercy.

He realized that this was a terrifying world!

It was not hard to want a group of people to be fearless!

But, to make the people of a world be bound by a common hatred for the enemy and share life and death, this was harder than ascending to heaven.

What right did Ye Yuan have?

“Since that’s the case, then … you all can be buried in death for Ye Yuan’s sake! Mourning of Samsara, arise!”

Hegemon Samsara raised his palm, a giant yin yang gearwheel condensed in the chaos.

The moment that giant wheel appeared, it carried the might of heaven and earth.

It was much stronger than Heavenless’ Heaven and Earth Infinity!

Even Heavenless’ pupils constricted too.

This giant wheel turned endlessly, crushing over toward Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall.

Places that it passed through, everything became dust!

More than ten blood race Hegemons failed to run away in time and were directly gone!

“What a powerful strength! I feel like my origin divinity is going to be ground up by it! Is this the secret of samsara?”

“The power of Great Dao is contained in this giant wheel too! Ancestor Heavenless and Progenitor Samsara have already completely broken away from the domain of a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse! Saying that they are the masters is also not the least bit overboard!”

“The 33 Heavens’ arrangement will be completely broken today! From now on, tripartite confrontation! No one will be able to shake their positions!”

…..

The blood race powerhouses were all extremely shocked.

Today, Hegemon Heavenless and Hegemon Samsara subverted their understanding of strength.

The power of Great Dao was too powerful!

At this time, Ancestor Heavenless made his move too! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Heaven and Earth Infinity smashed over again!

Regarding Heaven and Earth Infinity coupled with Mourning of Samsara, that raging power could virtually crush everything!

At this time, if it was any other plane, the two of them joining hands would be sufficient to destroy all of the planes!

This was the strength of powerhouses who controlled Great Dao!

Mi Tian’s complexion was somewhat pale because he discovered that the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List was actually silent!

This was true despair!

Even the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List gave up too?

“Cloudmount, Bufan, do you … regret it?” Mi Tian said.

“Haha, what’s there to regret? Making these powerhouses who control Great Dao suffer a loss, it’s sufficient for us to go down in history, right?” Cloudmount said with a loud laugh.

“Dying for Dao, nine deaths … with no regrets!” Zhuo Bufan said calmly.

Mi Tian nodded slightly and said, “This old man also can’t remember clearly how many years I’ve lived! But I feel that the years previously have all been an utter waste! Only until I knew Ye Yuan did this old man’s life become meaningful!”

Hearing that, everyone nodded one after another.

Clearly, they shared Mi Tian’s thoughts.

Dying this way was very heroic, but they had no regrets!

Why should we rejoice over life, and why should we be bitter about death?

Two horrifying to the extreme Great Dao attacks jostled against each other and came down.

Even the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven started trembling.

Crack … Crack, crack …

The boundary wall already started breaking down under this heavy pressure.

It might collapse at any time.

Yi Xue smiled lightly and said, “These guys are finally dead!”

However, just as the two terrifying attacks were about to land on the boundary wall, those two attacks actually slowly began to dissipate.

Finally, like the wind blew past, nothing was left behind.

When Samsara and Heavenless two people saw it, their pupils constricted.

In this world, who could resolve the two of their full power attacks so casually?

“This … This is impossible!” Heavenless said in disbelief.

Everyone present was staring dumbfoundedly.

Nobody knew what happened just now.

Even the powerhouses on Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s side had dumbfounded faces too.

What on earth happened during this?

Samsara’s gaze turned intent and he said in a solemn voice, “Who is it? Get out here for this progenitor!”

A youth in bright red robes slowly stepped out of the chaos.

He walked toward everyone, but people felt like Heavenly Dao had descended.

That sacred aura could not be concealed no matter what.

But they discovered to their horror that they had never seen this youth before!

When did such a major power appear in the 33 Heavens?

Samsara’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “You … You’re Bloodstone? You really came into being?”

The moment these words came out, everyone was shocked.

Mi Tian and the others were shocked and puzzled. Why would Progenitor Bloodstone help Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven?

But Yi Xue and the rest were full of ecstasy.

The blood race powerhouses all knelt down at this moment.

“Congratulations to Progenitor for coming into being! The blood race will live for generations to come and unify all the heavens!”

The youth slowly walked in front of Samsara, an incomparably sinister and charming smile hanging on his face as he opened his mouth and said, “Just now, was it you who was disrespectful to this Dao?”

Samsara frowned and said, “This Dao? Who the hell do you think you are? To dare call yourself this Dao?”

This Dao; no one in the 33 Heavens had ever called themselves that before.

But Samsara and Heavenless naturally knew what this Dao meant.

Progenitor Bloodstone was telling them that he had already controlled a Dao and transcended Great Beyond!

Only such a powerhouse was worthy of being called a Great Dao powerhouse. Only then would they dare call themselves this Dao!

This term of address also completely differentiated him from the powerhouses of all heavens.

He was the god who controlled Heavenly Dao!

It was just that Hegemon Samsara and Hegemon Heavenless did not believe that Bloodstone could really transcend Great Beyond.

Back then, they were wounded almost equally badly.

There was no reason that the Bloodstone was stronger than the two of them.

Of course, the more important thing was that they knew how difficult this half-step was!

Even if they were not injured, there was no hope of taking this half-step at all either!

What right did Bloodstone have?

Regarding that move earlier being stopped, it was simply because they placed all of their energy on Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, and they overlooked Bloodstone.

If they went at it again, they were confident that it would be absolutely impossible for Bloodstone to succeed!

This was where their confidence in controlling Great Dao lay!

Heavenless smiled coldly and said, “Bloodstone brat, do you really think that you can frighten us? Transcending Great Beyond, do you take the two of us to be fools?”

The sinister and charming youth glanced at them and lightly spat two words out of his mouth: “Kneel down!”

At the same time, a power that originated from Great Dao instantly descended!

This power of Great Dao was pure to the extreme. It was no idea how many times stronger than Heavenless and Samsara were, these two people!

No, wait, these two were not on the same level at all!

Thud!

Heavenless and Hegemon Samsara knelt down in response!

Everyone looked at this scene dumbfoundedly, horrified to the extreme!

These two powerhouses, who controlled a trace of the power of Great Dao, were actually directly pressured into kneeling!
