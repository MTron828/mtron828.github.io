Chapter 2848 Coincidental and Inevitable!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Hearing Song Qingyang’s explanation, Ye Yuan seemed to have understood something.

The reason why he obtained the unanimous recognition of these predecessors, it was probably still because of the striking righteous air that existed in his body!

Walking all the way here, Ye Yuan had saved the common people from misery and suffering time and again, developing an impressive righteous air.

Not just that, in these two lifetimes, the people that Ye Yuan saved with Alchemy Dao could not be counted at all.

There were likely not many cultivators that could match up to his merit.

Cultivators were mostly selfish.

The stronger one was, the more they tended to consider their own interests.

But Ye Yuan sought a clear conscience when doing things.

Just like outside the mountain pass gates, it originally did not concern Ye Yuan, but he meddled in other people’s business.

The power of origin stowed in these memorial tablets were originally masterless objects. But they had already formed a unified whole. It could form some kind of resonance with this striking righteous air that Ye Yuan

developed unknowingly.

Thus, that was how Ye Yuan obtained all of the predecessors’ recognition.

“What’s blessing power?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

“Do you feel that you’ve established a trace of connection with these memorial tablets?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, Li Clearcloud continued, “These predecessors’ memorial tablets carry the destiny of the sect. Therefore, your destiny will also be bound together in a common cause with the sect. The

stronger the sect is, the stronger your destiny too. Similarly, your destiny will also nourish the sect!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“In addition, when you encounter a desperate situation, it will automatically trigger this mysterious power, and the predecessors will block the fatal blow for you! Although the strength of the predecessors who left

behind the origin power didn’t reach Hegemon Realm, after so many years of accumulation, the power formed by these memorial tablets already reached a very terrifying level. It absolutely won’t lose to top Hegemon

Realm powerhouses!”

“Of course, the power of blessing still has the most important function, which is helping you comprehend the power of origin! Over 3000 Great Daos; over 3000 origin power! That’s an endless fortune.”

Ye Yuan was also incredibly shocked when he heard.

He did not expect that this power of blessing was actually so monstrous.

He also finally understood why the Extreme Medicine Sect was so powerful.

Wanting to step into the Hegemon Realm, the power of origin was a hurdle that could not be avoided.

But the power of blessing could actually help comprehend the power of origin!

Actually, before the war with the blood race, the Extreme Medicine Sect already faintly showed signs of being Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s number one great sect.

Four great Hegemons, this was something that no Hegemon level sect had!

f time was given, it might not be impossible for the Extreme Medicine Sect to grow into a super sect like the Labyrinth Divine Palace!

“In that case, Eldest Senior Brother being able to transcend the Dao tribulation many times is also because of the power of blessing?” Ye Yuan looked toward Li Clearcloud and said with a smile.

Li Clearcloud nodded and said, “That’s right!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I wonder how my power of blessing compares to Eldest Senior Brother?”

Li Clearcloud’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “There’s no comparison! Because nobody has ever received the blessing of all the predecessors!”

Ye Yuan beamed and said, “In that case, I’ll be much more confident when facing the heavenly punishment in the future? It looks like it won’t be easy for Eldest Senior Brother to want to outlast me!”

Li Clearcloud’s expression turned blacker.

He got slapped in the face!

But, Li Clearcloud knew that what Ye Yuan said was right!

His power of blessing was far worse than Ye Yuan’s.

But even so, he still relied on the power of blessing and lived until now.

Then what about Ye Yuan?

Thinking about it, he shook his head again and said, “It’s no use! Although the power of blessing is strong, no matter how strong it is, it’s also not stronger than Heavenly Dao! If Heaven wants to eliminate you, it’s

useless no matter how strong the power of blessing is!”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “There’s no point in arguing. Wouldn’t we know if we test it out?”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan’s figure flashed, and he went out of the great hall.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s aura rose crazily. He was actually going to break through to upper Saint Sovereign Heaven!

In reality, Ye Yuan could have broken through long ago.

It was just that taking the initiative to call down heavenly punishment the last time made Ye Yuan almost lose his life.

The Dao tribulation this time was even stronger than before. It was at least eight-nine Dao tribulation. Hence, Ye Yuan needed to store up and accumulate strength.

At present, with the power of blessing, Ye Yuan naturally did not have so many misgivings anymore.

Rumble!

Dao tribulation arrived as expected.

The terrifying pressure made even Li Clearcloud give a sidelong glance.

“How did this boy provoke Heavenly Dao? A mere middle Saint Sovereign Heaven is actually going to transcend eight-nine Dao tribulation!” Li Clearcloud also said in surprise.

It was not that he had not seen before divergent cultivators. But, such a freakish divergent cultivator, it was really still his first time seeing.

Eight-nine Dao tribulation, normally, only True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses had the qualifications to transcend it.

Furthermore, it was even slightly stronger lower True Sovereign Heavens.

Boom!

Very soon, Dao tribulation fell, the power was even greater than before.

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan brought out the Dao sword and slashed a sword on the Dao tribulation.

The Dao tribulation collapsed with a loud bang.

Ye Yuan had a stunned look. When did his Dao sword become so strong?

Following that, one Dao tribulation after another fell down.

Ye Yuan chopped out with a sword again. The Dao tribulation collapsed once more.

Ye Yuan was utterly dumbfounded. Was this the mysterious power of the blessing power?

But he clearly did not feel that he was more powerful.

The power of his Dao sword was still the same as before, but why could he shatter the Dao tribulation so easily?

By the side, Li Clearcloud’s eyes went wide.

“What kind of bullshit sword technique is this boy using? Each sword slashed onto the weak spot of the Dao tribulation! This boy clearly doesn’t have such sharp eyesight, but he could accomplish this. Even if it’s the

power of blessing, this is also too monstrous, right?” Li Clearcloud said indignantly.

Eight-nine Dao tribulation, it was just some rule power descending. It was not invulnerable.

These Dao tribulations were masterless things without consciousness. It was naturally impossible for there to be no flaws in the utilization of rules.

Therefore, Dao tribulation had weak points too!

It was just that to Ye Yuan, it was simply impossible to discover these weak points.

Unless one reached an extremely high realm and had an extremely deep comprehension of rule power, only then could one detect it.

Only then could one resolve a major problem with little effort, easily shattering the Dao tribulation.

But each of Ye Yuan’s sword moves chopped on the weak point of the Dao tribulations randomly.

If this kind of strange thing happened once in a while, forget it. But, it actually happened to Ye Yuan for every sword.

A coincidental thing became an inevitable thing. This was terrifying!

How sharp were Li Clearcloud’s eyes? He saw through the root of Ye Yuan being able to easily shatter the Dao tribulations with a glance.

It was just that he was incomparably shocked in his heart.

The enhancement of this power of blessing was also too scary, right?

Song Qingyang was stunned too. Ye Yuan’s strength was clear to him at a glance as well.

This eight-nine Dao tribulation was absolutely not easy for him.

But now, it was like a piece of cake.

When could Dao tribulations be overcome like this too?

“This luck is too heaven-defying! Even if there’s the enhancement of the power of blessing, it shouldn’t be like this too! Most likely, this boy’s own destiny is extremely strong to begin with. Now, with the blessing power

of all the predecessors enhancing, that’s why it’s terrifying to such an extent!”

The corners of Song Qingyang’s mouth twitched a few times, his expression seemingly strange as he said, “Right now, if lower True Sovereign Heavens were to fight with Ye Yuan, they would probably vomit blood,

right?”.
