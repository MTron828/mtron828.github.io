Chapter 1827 I Still Have to Go Back and Refine Pills

“Just one move? This guy is so shameless, is this going to directly admit defeat?”Ye Yuan’s words immediately drew laughter from the crowd.

He Yuan said smugly, “Looks like you’re really sent by the Shadowmoon Sect to play a side-character. It’s just that your luck was good, being taken a fancy to by Treasure Pig. Tsk tsk, I thought how strong you were, really disappointing!”

Similarly First Firmament Celestial Deity, but Ye Yuan was merely at the initial-stage, while He Yuan was at the peak.

It was not that this small realm itself was insurmountable, but that He Yuan’s strength was extremely strong in the first place.

Outside of the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, he could even exchange blows with some initial-stage Second Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouses.

High Clarity Sect disciples, none were weaklings.

This point had already been affirmed using many seasons of Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’re thinking too much. You’ll admit defeat within one move!”

Once He Yuan heard, he laughed loudly and said, “Did everybody hear that? He wants to make me concede within one move! Hahaha, well-deserving of being an Upper Groove Court’s genius, this imposing momentum is truly astonishing. I’m so scared!”

All around, there was a wave of laughter.

“Within the same realm, there really aren’t many who dare say that they can beat He Yuan, let alone say to make him admit defeat within one move.”

“Upper Groove Court’s genius is all out of the ordinary when boasting!”

Divine Dao realms, the further to the back, the greater the disparity within realms.

Each step needed to go through a long time of accumulation.

Even between initial-stage First Firmament Celestial Deity and middle-stage, the strength was also totally different.

“Idiot!”

These words, Ye Yuan and Little Tong practically said it in unison.

He Yuan’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “What did you say?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Haven’t even competed yet, so I really don’t know where your sense of superiority comes from. Or is it that you’ll definitely be stronger than others because you come from the High Clarity Sect? This baffling sense of superiority makes you seem very idiotic, understand?”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, everyone all had shocked faces.

Aren’t those who came from the High Clarity Sect impressive?

Shouldn’t they have a sense of superiority?

No idea starting since when, the High Clarity Sect already became synonymous with being powerful.

Even the Ruyi Sect was already completely crushed by the High Clarity Sect until they were black and blue all over.

In the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclaves for close to ten thousand years, there were at least two people from the High Clarity Sect that could enter the temple.

There was even one season where they obtained four spots at once!

This kind of might already penetrated deep into the marrow.

Hence, the quota of the High Clarity Sect taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave was as many as eight people!

The other sects could only look at their backs.

He Yuan’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Brat, you actually dare to insult my High Clarity Sect! I changed my mind! Tomorrow, I’ll make you unable to crawl up within one move!”

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “When you can do that, then talk again! Little Tong, let’s go.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought Little Tong and was about to leave.

Baili Qingyan was stunned and said, “You’re not looking at today’s matches? These five matches today, there are quite a few experts taking the stage!”

Disciples participating in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, their strength was actually all very close, the battle situation very intense too.

Under such circumstances, apart from the top few people, the majority would choose to remain behind and watch the fights.

Know yourself and the enemy, and you can fight a hundred battles without danger of defeat.

There was naturally no harm in understanding one’s opponent.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Not watching, nothing good to watch.”

In Ye Yuan’s view, pill refining was much more interesting than watching these fights.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, everyone had astounded faces.

This boy’s realm was not high, but he was unbelievably arrogant. Why would the Shadowmoon Sect let this sort of person come and take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave?

On the way, Ye Yuan glanced at Little Tong and said curiously, “You seem to be very optimistic about me.”

Little Tong had an appearance like an old man as he said, “Your spatial law is already grand completion third firmament. If you can’t even take care of that sort of guy, you can find a place to hit your head and die.”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised, this Little Tong’s judgment was very strong!

Indeed well-deserving of being an empyrean powerhouse’s descendant.

That He Yuan, Ye Yuan really did not take him seriously.

...

The five matches on the first day were indeed abnormally intense.

There was a battle where the two people fought until their divine essence was exhausted before barely managing to determine the victor.

There were virtually none capable of finishing off their opponent within a hundred moves.

It could be seen from this that the disparity who came to take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave might have differences in strength, but there was absolutely not a mediocre talent.

The battles on the second day were similarly incomparably fierce. But Ye Yuan did not show up.

All the way until midday, when the third match was about to start, did he appear.

Yang Shen came in front of He Yuan, patted his shoulder, and said, “Junior Apprentice Brother He, compete in this match well, don’t give that Ye Yuan any chance. Our High Clarity Sect’s reputation isn’t allowed to be profaned!”

He Yuan also nodded and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Yang rest assured, this boy is an ego-maniac, I’ll give him a lightning blow the moment I go up and absolutely won’t hold back!”

Yang Shen nodded his head, only then, setting his mind at ease.

The two people went up the ring, He Yuan sneered and said, “Brat, originally, I still want to save you some face. But you actually dared to make impertinent remarks about my High Clarity Sect, then be prepared to bear my wrath! Today, I’ll let you take a look at how strong the High Clarity Sect is!”

Ye Yuan was speechless as he said, “So much nonsense. Quickly make your move. I still have to go back and refine pills.”

These few years, Ye Yuan refined pills in great pleasure and was even somewhat enjoying too much to think about other things anymore.

With Treasure Pig around, he had however many spirit medicines he wanted, no need to worry at all.

Battling with He Yuan was simply a waste of time.

But when He Yuan heard this, he immediately flared up with anger.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Want to refine pills, right? Then you crawl back and refine pills!”

Done talking, He Yuan’s world power surged out frenziedly, directly enveloping Ye Yuan inside.

At this moment, the entire space on the stage seemed to be trembling.

The tremors grew stronger and stronger as if it was going to shatter the ring.

“This ... is tremor law! It’s a kind of earth law, possessing extremely strong offensiveness. Legend has it that when cultivated to the extreme, it can even shatter space! I didn’t expect that He Yuan’s strength was actually so strong!”

“Heh, looks like that kid really infuriated him! The moment he came up, it’s his trump card!”

Below the stage, there was a wave of exclamations.

In terms of world power, He Yuan had an imposing momentum, as if no one could beat him.

He looked at Ye Yuan coldly, the moment on his body growing stronger and stronger.

“Now, regret it, right? But you already have no regret medicine to eat! Suffer my wrath! Space ... Shatter ...”

He Yuan just spat two words out of his mouth when the Ye Yuan who did not move all along moved.

Only to see him take a step out, directly passing through the violent spatial quakes, arriving in front of He Yuan.

He Yuan’s pupils constricted and did not have time to panic when Ye Yuan already pointed a finger out.

“Puhwark!”

He Yuan spent a long time accumulating the momentum but did not even unleash a single punch and was sent down the stage by Ye Yuan with one finger.

He Yuan fell to the ground, fresh blood spurting wildly. Until now, he still did not dare to believe the scene that just happened.

Inside the world power, he was the sovereign!

The closer to him, the stronger the power of the vibrations.

But this powerful tremor force actually had no effect on Ye Yuan at all.

As if the domain constructed by world power was Ye Yuan’s in the first place.
