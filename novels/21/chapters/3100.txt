Chapter 3099: About on Par!

“Retreat!”

Without the slightest hesitation, Yi Xue directly announced the retreat.

Facing such a powerful Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, it was simply impossible for them to attain victory.

It was only to see him attacked with a blood spear. Heaven and earth changed colors, attempting to force Mi Tian back.

Mi Tian just smiled coldly and said, “Wanting to leave isn’t so easy! My title, Hegemon Space, isn’t in name only!”

Spatial origin surged out. The surrounding space seemed to be frozen and was actually solid as a metal bucket.

This spear of Yi Xue’s was devoured by endless space.

Meanwhile, the surrounding void was completely frozen!

Freezing space did not need the numerous Hegemons to take action. Mi Tian’s power alone would suffice.

Furthermore, with this space freezing, the power was even stronger than the blood race’s that time!

Yi Xue’s expression changed wildly, and at this time, Zhao Yue arrived!

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue’s enormous body and violent sharp claws appeared unbelievably brutal.

......

This claw seemed like it was going to tear Yi Xue to pieces.

Berserk saint force condensed on the tip of the claw. Places that it passed through, even the frozen space had fissures ripped apart.

Yi Xue’s expression changed again, long spear swinging horizontally, facing off against Zhao Yue.

Boom!

Zhao Yue was directly sent flying out.

But Zhao Yue drew a lone arc in midair and actually flew back again.

At the same time, Mi Tian also found an opportunity to attack!

Boom!

The three people exchanged blows head-on. This time, it was Yi Xue’s turn to be sent flying out.

Having fought this battle until now, it was his first time being in a disadvantageous position!

This also meant that the battle situation had completely turned around.

Above the void, three mighty Great Beyond powerhouses were fighting frenziedly. The energy undulations that exploded made everyone’s faces change.

This life and death great battle entered the white-hot stage.

However, Zhao Yue’s strength far exceeded everyone’s expectations.

In terms of strength, he was still significantly worse than these two super powerhouses.

But he charged without fear of death, and his berserk combat power made up for this gap.

How rich was Mi Tian’s combat experience? With him assisting by the side, Yi Xue could only take a beating.

In reality, Yi Xue already chose to retreat right away. He knew that nothing could be done anymore.

But it was difficult to want to escape from Mi Tian’s hands!

The blood race powerhouses originally slaughtered everywhere, sweeping through everything.

But now, it was completely reversed.

Mi Tian’s spatial freezing, the radius was huge, affecting them as well.

Even if these people wanted to run away, there was no chance either.

Hence, it actually became a one-sided massacre!

The blood race powerhouses were reducing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

…..

Ye Yuan carried Feng Xiaotian’s corpse and walked step by step to Bloodpromise. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

All around were battle cries that shook the heavens.

But the two of them seemed to be cut off from the world.

Everyone had overlooked them.

“I really didn’t expect that you actually still had such a trump card! These monsters’ talents are also just average. How can you possibly turn all of them into Hegemon Realms?” Bloodpromise said in confusion.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What the Chaos Bloodstone can do, I can naturally do it too.”

Bloodpromise sneered when he heard that and said, “Just the likes of you, you dared to be placed in the same category as Progenitor too? Who the hell do you think you are!”

Ye Yuan still said calmly, “If your Progenitor wasn’t apprehensive of me, why would there be a need to put forth such a grand line-up?”

Bloodpromise’s expression changed, and he gave a cold snort but did not speak.

Ye Yuan continued, “Their bloodlines had been reformed to begin with. These few years, I devoted myself to researching bloodlines and finally gained something. I completely stimulated their bloodline power. Them breaking through realms is also merely something that happened naturally without extra effort. Reaching the Hegemon Realm is nothing difficult.”

Ye Yuan had always been researching how to restore Zhao Yue and the others’ appearance and consciousness.

But it was very hard.

However, he found another path. It was finding a way to continue stimulating their bloodline.

Later, Ye Yuan even obtained the Heavenly Dao Paintings. He stimulated these people’s bloodline power with the Heavenly Dao Paintings as a guide, letting them break through to Hegemon Realm in one stroke.

And Zhao Yue’s evolution even exceeded Ye Yuan’s expectations.

Zhao Yue’s talent was too good. He who obtained the Heavenly Dao Painting could be said to be improving at a tremendous pace.

Later, he secretly sent these people into the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space. He did not even tell Mi Tian they all.

Of course, it was also useless even if he told them.

It was only so he could release the seal and let these monsters out.

Otherwise, no one could control it.

“Hahaha … Ye Yuan, do you know what’s called overestimating your own ability? Hegemon Realm is nothing difficult? These words are just a little conceited when other people say it. But, when it comes out of your mouth, that’s ignorant and laughable! You, a divergent cultivator, when you break through, that will be the day that you die! What are you talking about the Hegemon Realm for?” Bloodpromise said with a wild laugh.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Then you just watch how I talk about Hegemon Realm!”

Swoosh!

Four great bloodlines poured out of Ye Yuan’s body wildly, saint force exploding.

Without the slightest flashiness, Ye Yuan smashed a punch right over!

In the next second, Bloodpromise still had a look of disdain on his face.

But in the next second, his pupils constricted, and he cried out in alarm, “Four great chaos true spirit bloodlines! How is this possible?!”

The moment Ye Yuan moved, there was shock all over the sky!

Even Mi Tian’s movements were delayed by a fraction too.

“Chaos grade bloodline! He … He actually promoted the four great true spirit bloodlines all to chaos grade?” Long Jian’s expression changed wildly, and he cried out in shock.

“This is impossible! Chaos grade bloodline is absolutely impossible to reach post-natal! Quasi-chaos grade bloodline is already the limit! But … But what on earth is going on?” The White Tiger Clan’s Bai Zhi similarly had a look of shock.

“Doesn’t this mean that we also have hope of advancing to chaos grade bloodline?” The moment Xuan Taiqing said these words, everyone trembled all over.

White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise three clans, all had quasi-chaos grade bloodlines appear.

Feng Qingxuan they all already had high hopes pinned on them.

Quasi-chaos grade bloodline, although it was unable to reach the height of innate chaos grade bloodline, without a doubt, the potential was much greater than the others.

Even if similarly Great Beyond Realm, Feng Qingxuan they all, their strength would also be far stronger than Luan Qinghe they all.

But, if one could reach chaos grade bloodline post-natal, that significance was completely different!

Now, Ye Yuan’s eruption had subverted everyone’s understanding of bloodline!

The power of his punch was so strong!

Boom!

Facing the front, Ye Yuan carried Feng Xiaotian and smashed a fist fiercely onto Bloodpromise’s blood-colored shield.

The blood-colored shield rippled. The terrifying power passed right through!

Bloodpromise’s expression changed wildly. How could an ordinary Emperor Sakra Heaven break through the origin defenses of a Peak Hegemon?

Forget about breaking through; it could not even make them tremble a little!

The gap between Emperor Sakra Heaven and Peak Hegemon was really far too great, great until it was hard to make up for.

But Ye Yuan directly broke it!

The penetrative force of saint force was too fearsome!

There was no time to think too much. Bloodpromise’s blood energy surged, and he similarly smashed a punch over.

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, the two people exchanged a blow.

Bang!

The void exploded. The two people flew out backward.

Ye Yuan retreated a thousand steps away before barely managing to stand firm.

And because Bloodpromise was too hasty, he was directly smashed flying by a punch from Ye Yuan.

Then he felt countless powerful auras lock onto him.

Bloodpromise shuddered and hurriedly stabilized his figure, avoiding those powerful auras.

However, his expression was ugly to the extreme.

This punch just now, he was about on par with Ye Yuan!
