Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I, Saint Exalt Azuresky, wielded my long spear and killed the blood race army until their helmet and coat of mail were in utter disarray! Those whatever bullshit Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons couldn’t even last one exchange under my spear, and they were thoroughly obliterated ...”

On a small dirt mound, Yang Qing had a look of exultation, describing his ‘heroic valiantness.’

Around him, many Heaven One powerhouses were surrounding him, listening until they felt an upsurge of emotion.

Yang Qing’s strength was indeed strong, virtually invincible in the Heaven One Army.

Therefore, his words sound fantastical, but it was still very convincing.

Of course, he ‘grafted’ all of Ye Yuan’s contributions onto himself.

“I, Saint Exalt Azuresky, shouted loudly, who dares to come and fight! That bunch of blood race trash immediately shut themselves in! Sigh, invincibility is really lonely!”

Yang Qing gave a long sigh, with quite the air of a lonely expert.

He had been invincible for too long and naturally developed the air of an expert.

‘When not being detestable, he really had quite the air of a general.

“Saint Exalt Azuresky is well-deserving of the name Azuresky, making our human race’s awe-inspiring reputation renown!”

“Awesome! Great! Didn’t expect that our Heaven One Alliance will also beat the blood race until they don’t want to step out of the door!”

“Saint Exalt Azuresky is mighty!”

For a time, praises lingered incessantly.

Yang Qing immersed into this kind of praise, unable to extricate himself.

This kind of feeling, he had enjoyed it countless times but would never tire of it.

On the contrary, he gladly endured the hardship.

After Ye Yuan came back, he went into closed-seclusion and did not exit. These few days, Yang Qing had been boasting himself every day in the army camp.

True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses naturally would not be bored enough to come and bother him. Hence, these few days, Yang Qing’s reputation became more and more resounding among the bottom-level soldiers.

This matter was only know by Emperor Realm powerhouses.

In the beginning, everyone naturally did not believe it.

But Yang Qing obtained the token of the blood race’s chiliarch. This thing could not be faked.

‘There were naturally more people who believed in it.

“Tch, Yang Qing, can you please have some face? I was wondering why you couldn’t be found these few days. It turns out that you ran here to brag!”

Right at this time, a discordant voice came over.

The moment everyone looked, it was Little Dragon Girl Jingfei.

The moment Yang Qing saw Jingfei, he secretly thought to himself, shit.

Why did this girl come here?

‘Those soldiers felt an upsurge of emotion when they listened and had long already believed Yang Qing. The moment they heard her at this time, they became indignant.

A soldier called her into question, “Girlie, what the hell do you know! Saint Exalt Azuresky has the token of the blood race’s chiliarch in his hands. This is the symbol of their identity. Without killing the other party, it’s impossible to get it!”

Jingfei rolled her eyes. This bunch of guys was bluffed by Yang Qing into becoming his hardcore followers!

She was just about to open her mouth to provide an explanation, but there was a blur before her eyes, and Yang Qing already arrived in front of her.

“Huhu, Jingfei girlie, you came to find me to ask for something, right? Let’s go then, find another place to talk about it!”

Yang Qing covered Jingfei’s mouth and dragged her, and was about to leave.

Jingfei was not Yang Qing’s match at all. She had her mouth covered and could not speak, but this really could not stump her.

“The blood race’s chiliarch did die, and the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons died too. But they were killed by my Big Brother Ye Yuan! This guy is just a nobody waving a flag and shouting for cheers, that’s all!”

Asmall and exquisite sea conch flew out, the voice immediately spreading throughout the barracks.

All the soldiers exchanged glances when they heard it.

“It was Great Commander Ye Yuan? Isn’t he a heavenly alchemist? Why is his combat strength so strong too?”

“This lass is Great Commander Ye Yuan’s younger sister. She naturally fantasizes that her big brother is a hero!”

“Oh, so that’s how it is!”

There was still no one who believed it!

Jingfei became anxious and immediately shouted through the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, “Yang Qing, you dare to seize my Big Brother Ye Yuan’s credit. Do you still want to resolve your blood corruption poison or not?”

‘The moment Yang Qing heard, he immediately jumped up and said excitedly, “This guy really found a way?”

Jingfei could finally speak. Looking at him, she said with a sneer, “Is there anything that my Big Brother Ye Yuan can’t do in this world? He made me come find you to go and test the medicine!”

Yang Qing said excitedly, “Then what are we still waiting for? Come on!”

Finished saying, he ignored the dumbfounded crowd too, disappearing with a flash.

Jingfei glanced at the soldiers hatefully and said with a look of anger from their failure to live up to expectations: “You bunch of fools, misled by people with a few words! My Big Brother Ye Yuan is a divergent cultivator, his strength being formidable! Someone like Yang Qing, he can beat him up with one

hand! Yet, you guys still believed his rubbish! Humph!”

Finished talking, she left too, leaving behind the dumbfounded looking crowd.

Yang Qing was poisoned by the blood corruption poison?

Inflicted with the blood corruption poison, and he could still be as brave as he said?

It turned out that they were all fooled!

“It turns out that the one who did those things was actually Great Commander Ye Yuan!”

“Great Commander Ye Yuan is really impressive! Just how long had he joined the Heaven One army? He already made three great miraculous achievements!”

“This kind of big victory is really a tribute to our Heaven One’s divine might! It’s so amazing!”

“Just now, did that lass say that the blood corruption poison can be resolved?”

suddenly, the entire place became deathly silent!

The moment Yang Qing entered the room, he was virtually about to suffocate.

Within the room, there were one powerful aura after another, making him virtually unable to breathe.

Everyone’s gazes were focused on him.

It was just that the gazes were somewhat strange.

Like ... looking at a little white rat.

“alright, begin!” Dan Fei said coolly.

But, in this calm voice, it exuded strong anticipation.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and pointed at the board in front of him and said to Yang Qing, “Lie down!”

“A-Ah! Alright!”

Yang Qing lay on the panel, seeming somewhat cramped.

This room was too terrifying!

These guys were definitely all Emperor Realm powerhouses!

Upon lying down, a bloody aura hit him in the nose.

A wooden basin was placed in front of Ye Yuan. Water was filled in the wooden basin.

To be exact, it was blood water! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Scarlet red, it looked shocking!

Ye Yuan was long prepared. As soon as Yang Qing lay down, star light shone brightly, and the Xuanji Nine Leaves acupuncture technique started!

Only to see him reach his hand out in focus, divine essence needles passed through the blood water.

The divine essence needles were actually dyed red in an instant!

Following that, the fantasy-like acupuncture technique began!

‘The acupuncture technique this time was greatly different from when he imparted to the others before.

These few days, he carried out an in-depth analysis of blood essence.

The blood essence of Yuan Zheng these people had more reference value!

The blood essence of the blood race, the stronger they were, the more powerful and the more vigorous it was.

Previously, Ye Yuan already had a framework for treating the blood corruption poison. This time, with an even better reference, he found the method very quickly.

The reason why Yang Qing got injured and he did not take action, it was actually to make him be this little white rat.

It was easier to get started on an acquaintance.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan knew that Yang Qing’s strength was extremely strong. His ability to resist the blood corruption poison was also stronger than the others. He was naturally a very good experiment subject.

This basin of blood water was actually medicine water refined by Ye Yuan with the blood essence of the blood race assembled with several dozen kinds of grade five heavenly medicines.

‘This medicine water coupled with his improved Xuanji Nine Leaves, it could completely cure the blood corruption poison!

Ye Yuan’s technique was dreamlike and mystical. Even a hint of surprise flashed across in Zuo Chen’s eyes.

He was a grade eight heavenly alchemist. How sharp was his eyesight?

The virtues and faults of this technique were clear to him at a glance!

Impressive!

Sigh!

Zuo Chen could not hold back and heaved a sigh again in his heart.

A shame that he was a divergent cultivator!

This kind of alchemy path genius would definitely be a grade eight, or even a grade nine heavenly alchemist in the future! Truly a shame!

One divine essence needle after another fired into Yang Qing’s body. Yang Qing emitted muffled groans continuously.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan’s divine essence needles suddenly stopped, the stellar power dissipating with a loud bang.

A hint of wild ecstasy flashed across Ye Yuan’s face, and he said, “It succeeded!”
