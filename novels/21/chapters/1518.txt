Chapter 1522 As Long as You“re Happy

Sure enough, as the woman predicted, battling against the few guardians after her, Ye Yuan was unimpeded all the way.

When he finished off the seventeenth guardian, all of the geniuses outside were all dumbfounded.

Di Fan only felt that his mouth was somewhat dry. This Ye Yuan’s strength was actually powerful to such a degree?

He made it to the ninth round, Ye Yuan made it to the eighteenth round!

The disparity between him and a grand completion Fiend General was actually as many as nine people?

These nine people were not merely as simple as doubling.

These nine people at the back, their strength were much stronger compared to the first nine people.

“I really don’t know just what aspect this guy is strong in! I really want to have a good fight with him when he comes out!”

Ba Tu’s heart was unbearably itchy. He was really somewhat doubting whether or not Ye Yuan’s opponents were really the same as theirs.

Especially that battle where he won against the cold-looking woman. Everyone clearly saw that the woman pierced Ye Yuan’s abdomen with a sword. But why was the one who won in the end Ye Yuan?

“Heh, it’s the final battle. What the result will be, it will be known very soon!” Di Fan said with a cold smile.

...

Ye Yuan looked at this man dressed in black in front of him, feeling an unprecedented pressure.

Although the woman was strong, she completely did not give him this kind of powerful sense of oppression.

Before seeing Zheng Jian, Ye Yuan also could not imagine that a half-step Origin Deity martial artist would bring him such a strong pressure.

“Humph! Those trash actually let a weakling like you make it to my place!” Zhang Jian said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, a weakling, is it?

The 17 rounds’ guardians earlier, all of them were amazingly talented people.

Reaching Zheng Jian here, he actually became trash.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and he said, “They all said that you’re a madman. I didn’t expect that ... you’re a condescending madman.”

Zheng Jian was indifferent and still said coldly, “Not that I’m condescending, but you’re not fit to enter my eyes at all. I’m invincible in the same rank. You, a mere grand completion Heaven Glimpse, what right do you have to enter my arcane sights?”

Zheng Jian’s arrogance billowed to the heavens, completely looking down on Ye Yuan.

In his eyes, he had no opponents in the same realm, let alone that Ye Yuan’s realm was even a rank lower than his.

It was just that these words were somewhat funny in Ye Yuan’s ears.

Invincible in the same realm, this kind of words, even he did not dare to say. This Zheng Jian actually uttered it shamelessly.

The Heavenspan World was vast, geniuses as plentiful as oxen hair. Who dared to say that they were invincible in the same rank?

He believed that Zheng Jian was definitely a tough character. But to be able to say this kind of words, he was no longer confident, but conceited.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heh, sorry about it, all along, I have never encountered a match in the same rank too.”

Zheng Jian said disdainfully, “Is that so? You’re very confident! Then I’ll utterly destroy your confidence today! Let you know the disparity between genius and mediocrity!”

“Come on, I’m looking forward to it, ge ... nius!”

Ye Yuan deliberately dragged out the tone to express his disdain. He disliked this so-called strongest person greatly.

Zheng Jian had a character unmovable like a mountain. Ye Yuan’s provocation did not make him get angry.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows raised up. Zheng Jian’s aura actually fell, finally suppressing at grand completion Heaven Glimpse; exactly the same as Ye Yuan’s.

“You’re very surprised?” Zheng Jian said indifferently.

Ye Yuan nodded his head honestly and said, “Indeed a little surprised.”

Zheng Jian said, “I said before, invincible in the same realm. Still using half-step Origin Deity to deal with you, what difference is there from me and those trash?”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “Alright, as long as you’re happy.”

Ye Yuan discovered that there was no way to communicate with this arrogant guy at all.

At the outside world, a group of people looked at this scene wide-eyed and tongue-tied, full of puzzlement.

“F*ck me, is this guy retarded? To actually suppress his realm to deal with Source Night?”

“This guy is too cocky!”

“This is a typical case of looking for trouble! In a while, see how he dies!”

...

Even though Di Fan and Ba Tu they all felt that Ye Yuan should not make it to this step, regarding Ye Yuan’s strength, they had no objections.

Seeing Zheng Jian actually suppress his realm to deal with Ye Yuan, they also felt incredulous.

Toward the other people’s view, they also expressed their agreement.

While at this time, two short swords appeared in Zheng Jian’s hands like a magic trick.

His entire person immediately revealed his edge.

The swift and fierce aura coming from head-on also made Ye Yuan’s countenance change visibly.

While this guy was arrogant, his strength was definitely indisputable.

Even though the other party suppressed his realm, Ye Yuan did not dare to underestimate it either.

“Within ten moves, send you on your way! Understanding Sword Art, release!”

Zheng Jian gave a low cry, his entire person dashing out akin to a cheetah, arriving in front of Ye Yuan in virtually a blink of an eye.

Two short swords, one sliced towards Ye Yuan’s throat, one stabbed straight for Ye Yuan’s abdomen, the cooperation seamless. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh, the Evil Extermination Sword shooting out strangely.

“Misty Sword Art!”

Zheng Jian only felt a blur before his eyes. Ye Yuan’s long sword actually reached first despite launching later, and already arrived in front of his face!

This shock was by no means insignificant. He immediately changed moves, sweeping away Ye Yuan’s sword.

But this alteration of move lost the initiative.

An inch short, an inch of peril. The secret of short swords lied in close-quarters combat.

But Ye Yuan relied on the length of his sword and directly suppressed Zheng Jian.

Exchanging a move, Zheng Jian was very aggrieved.

“Lad, it turns out that you comprehended spatial laws. No wonder you’re so cocky. It’s a shame, your spatial laws are too shallow!”

Zheng Jian gave a cold cry, pouncing forward once more.

This time, Zheng Jian’s speed was swift to the extreme.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, instantly seeing through Zheng Jian’s actual situation.

Short sword laws grand completion third-layered heaven, and integrated grand completion third-layered heaven laws of wind!

Furthermore, Zheng Jian’s short swords seemed to still have some secrets that he did not see through.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Facing such an expert, Ye Yuan did not dare to hide his strength.

The two short swords were erratic like his Evil Extermination Sword. A moment of carelessness and it would be fatal.

But in the same rank, Ye Yuan really did not fear Zheng Jian.

For Ye Yuan to be able to jump realms and battle, what he relied on was not just laws comprehension, there was also his thick divine essence!

Ye Yuan’s chaos divine essence made his martial techniques inherently incomparably heavy. It had the effect of augmenting his martial technique itself.

Hence, for Zheng Jian to want to suppress Ye Yuan under the same realm, it was a very laughable thing.

Zheng Jian discovered this point very quickly. No matter how quick his movement technique was, he could only merely catch up to Ye Yuan’s speed.

He discovered to his dismay that under the same realm, he could not do anything to the other party at all.

The two people were evenly-matched!

Clank!

The two people separated from the clash.

Ye Yuan looked at Zheng Jian with a smile that was not a smile and said, “It’s already been 80 moves, boasted too big, right? This is the invincibility in the same realm that you boasted earlier?”

Zheng Jian’s face was extremely dark but he did not know how to refute Ye Yuan’s words.

This was still the first time in his life not gaining any advantage under the same realm!

This kid opposite was powerful beyond imagination!

Although unwilling to admit it, he really did boast too much earlier.

“Looks like I really underestimated you! Kid, you have the qualifications to be my opponent! However, you also successfully infuriated me. Now, I’ll use my full power to fight!” Zheng Jian said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Most welcomed!”
