Chapter 1349: Everyone Kicks a Man Who Is Down

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Cough, cough, Elder Brother has misunderstood. How can this Wang have this kind of idea?” Wang Su said, rather awkwardly.

One had to admit that Ye Yuan’s suggestion indeed made him tempted.

Wang Lingbo, this level of martial artist, could easily be found among people in the main family. Losing one to exchange for the Essence Cultivating Pill’s selling rights was still very worth it.

But this sort of words could not be said no matter what.

Those who accomplished great things did not bother with the trifles!

He was already weighing it over in his heart, whether or not to dispose of Wang Lingbo in secret, and then find Ye Yuan for peace talks.

Wang Yuxiang’s expression was also very ugly. That faintly imperceptible look of Wang Su’s just now, how could he not tell?

Making him use his son’s life to go exchange for the Essence Cultivating Pill’s selling rights, he was not willing even if beaten to death. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He would rather fight it out with the Myriad Treasure Tower!

Ye Yuan’s condition made the banquet’s atmosphere become delicate.

Wang Yuxiang’s face fell, and he said, “Ye Yuan, we came with sincerity, can you also show your sincerity?”

“Sincerity? Where’s the sincerity? Huhu, pardon this Ye’s eyes for being blind, but I don’t see it! You all don’t have sincerity, but this Ye came with the greatest sincerity. Wang Lingbo took action against me back then, he should have today’s reckoning,” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Wang Lingbo was angered until he gnashed his teeth in hatred by the side. He knew that right now, apart from his father, probably everyone wanted him dead!

“City Lord, Your Excellency, Ye Yuan is clearly borrowing a knife to kill people. Don’t accept his provocation! Even if we really kill my son, what if their Myriad Treasure Tower reneges, what to do?” Wang Yuxiang said solemnly.

Chen Yongnian fell silent. His attitude made Wang Yuxiang’s and Wang Lingbo’s hearts sink to rock bottom.

“With this city lord around, I believe the Myriad Treasure Tower won’t go back on their word, right?” Chen Yongnian looked at Ye Yuan with a heated gaze and said.

Ye Yuan smiled without saying a word but did not answer.

Wang Lingbo’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, “City Lord, what do you mean?”

Chen Yongnian said coolly, “What do I mean? Everybody is doing business in Jewelhill City, each relying on their own ability. But you sent people to hunt down the other party, it already overstepped the boundary!”

The moment Old Man Lin heard these words, he immediately concurred: “Yeah! Everyone is clear about the cause of this matter, wasn’t this all caused by that shameless younger sister of yours? It was your Wang Family’s wrongdoing to begin with, and then you guys still wanted to exterminate everyone! It’s too much!”

Old Man Lu also said, “The martial path has the martial path’s rules. While business has business rules. Wang Lingbo, you doing this has greatly ruined the rules of business!”

Wang Lingbo’s expression turned deathly pale. He finally knew what was called everyone kicks a man who was down.

“You all ... You all ... shameless!” Wang Lingbo was angered until he could not even speak.

Before coming today, he was still very excited.

But he never dreamed that this play today would actually ring the funeral bell for him!

Now, this situation, everyone already wanted to kill and be done with it!

Even the fellow clan member, Wang Su, was also sharpening his knife.

Wang Yuxiang was extremely furious too and rebuked, “You two old fogeys, shut up for me! You all are really shameless to the extreme!”

Chen Yongnian said coolly, “What they said is right too! Wang Lingbo, since you did something wrong, you have to bear the consequences. Are you doing it yourself, or do you want this city lord to take action?”

Chen Yongnian seemed to be talking about a very dull matter, his voice not carrying a trace of emotion.

Wang Lingbo trembled all over, his gaze revealing a look of despair.

It seemed like he could not escape his doom today!

His gaze suddenly looked towards Wang Su, seemingly grasping the last strand of life-saving straw, saying urgently, “Sir Su, we’re close relatives of the same clan. Could it be that you’re also going to be subjected to the sowing of dissension by these despicable villains?”

He knew Wang Su’s status. If Wang Su opened his mouth, Chen Yongnian might not be unscrupulous and brazen.

Wang Su looked straight ahead and could not be bothered to give him a glance at all.

The matter already developed to this kind of extent, he already had no need to protect Wang Lingbo anymore.

“Elder Brother, it’s not that Wang Su isn’t saving you; it’s truly a situation where the evil we bring onto ourselves are the hardest to bear!” Wang Su said emotionally.

Wang Su’s words became the final straw that brought down the camel, shattering all of Wang Lingbo’s fantasies.

Suddenly, Wang Lingbo’s figure moved, speeding outside of the main hall.

“Humph! Courting death!”

Chen Yongnian gave a cold snort, directly reaching a claw out. Wang Lingbo’s figure abruptly stopped.

But right at this time, Wang Yuxiang also made a move!

There was no way he could watch his son be killed unfeelingly!

Chen Yongnian’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “Overestimating your own ability!”

While talking, Chen Yongnian turned his claw into a palm. A surge of immense force emerged in full force.

Bang!

Just one palm, Wang Yuxiang’s body was like a kite with a broken string, flying out backward.

In front of Chen Yongnian, Wang Yuxiang was weak until he did not have any strength to retaliate!

Following that, Chen Yongnian turned his palm into a claw once more. Wang Lingbo’s figure was actually directly burst open by a powerful essence energy!

While from start to end, Chen Yongnian just sat still.

With a wave of a hand, one dead and one injured!

The aura that looked down upon the world was displayed in its entirety.

At this time, Wang Yuxiang was still lying on the ground, vomiting blood in large mouthfuls.

His gaze when looking at Chen Yongnian was filled with killing intent.

The pupils of Lu and Lin, two families’ old heads, also shrunk, looking at Chen Yongnian with incredible shock.

They also did not expect that Chen Yongnian was actually powerful to this kind of extent already.

It seemed like he was also merely a step away from late-stage Heaven Glimpse.

Chen Yongnian killing Wang Lingbo with ruthless means and bringing down Wang Yuxiang also had the intention of establishing prestige.

He already had not displayed his strength in front of the public for many years. Now, let them take a look that he, this city lord, was not someone to be provoked.

Of course, the most important was still shocking Ye Yuan, making him realize his promise.

The Yang Rui by the side was long dumbstruck with amazement already.

Before coming, he never thought that Ye Yuan’s casual few sentences would make the alliance of the three great families and City Lord Manor to fall apart.

Now, Wang Lingbo was dead, and Wang Yuxiang severely wounded. The Wang Family was virtually crippled already.

Not only was this youth’s talent extremely high, these means and resourcefulness were also exceedingly formidable. Truly terrifying!

Except, after witnessing Chen Yongnian’s means, Yang Rui no longer had thoughts of getting lucky.

Looks like Ye Yuan also knew that the Essence Cultivating Pill could not be protected anymore. Hence, that was why he would maximize the role of the Essence Cultivating Pill, using it to knock dead the Wang Family father and son.

Clearly, he succeeded.

Ye Yuan observed all of this from the sidelines the whole time. These people all posed as people of high morals, but they disowned all relatives and friends in front of benefits. Truly laughable.

Putting it bluntly, they were a bunch of despicable people who only sought profits.

Finished doing all these, Chen Yongnian used an indifferent gaze to look at Ye Yuan and said, “Wang Lingbo broke Jewelhill City’s business world order, even death cannot atone for his crimes! Tower Lord Yang, Ye Yuan, what to do next will depend on you all!”

“Depend on us? Depend on us what?” Ye Yuan switched to a smiling face and asked with a smile.

His words made everyone’s faces changed!

Could it be that this boy was going to go back on his word?

Chen Yongnian’s face fell, and he said, “The condition that you raised, I’ve already promised you on behalf of their three families! Now, it’s time for you to realize your promise!”

Ye Yuan’s smile was very radiant as he said, “Promise? Did I say anything? Did City Lord, Your Excellency, hear wrongly?”
