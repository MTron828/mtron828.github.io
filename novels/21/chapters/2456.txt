Chapter 2462: Dao Ancestor Eating Dust!

Seeing Lin Huan’s miserable state, the corners of Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s mouth twitched slightly.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

These were only four knives, and Lin Huan was already hurting until his expression was contorted. There was no way of comparing him to Wan Zhen at all.

One had to know, Wan Zhen was stabbed with dozens of knives earlier, but he did not make a sound.

“Won’t? Huhu, you’re also underestimating these guys’ shamelessness too much!” Sacred Ancestor High Priest said with a cold snort.

Previously, he respected Dao Ancestor powerhouses from the bottom of his heart too.

The strong were always worthy of respect.

However, ever since he was tricked into refining pills, his perception of the nine great Dao Ancestors already dropped to freezing point.

“Ahhh! I ... I’m going to die! Ye Yuan, I beg you, kill me! I ... I can’t take it anymore!” Lin Huan having been struck by a knife again, cried out miserably.

Ye Yuan ignored him and continued, “They won’t. Lin Chaotian will know the consequences of provoking me!”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said, “I know that they can’t catch you, but you’re currently hesitating to take action out of fear of damages. What can you do to them?”

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan did not even turn his head back and dealt another knife, then said smilingly, “I’m indeed hesitant to take action out of fear of damages, but they will be cautious in taking action. No need to use this sort of eyes to look at me. You just watch by the side. Today, I’ll invite you to watch a good show! Oh, right! Treat Wan Zhen. He only has a breath left. The medicinal pills that I brought with me aren’t strong enough. So you do it.”

Swoosh!

Another knife!

When everyone saw Ye Yuan torture Lin Huan until he was transported away and wished to die while talking in a jovial manner, they could not help drawing cold breaths.

That sort of piercing cold killing intent, they felt it.

Ye Yuan arrived in front of Lin Huan and said with a gleeful smile, “You already want to seek death? It’s just seven knives, what you gave Wan Zhen, I won’t return to you twice as much either, you just have to take it all according to the bill.”

Pffft!

As he said, it was another knife stabbing Lin Huan.

Lin Huan hurt until he gasped cold air heavily and already could not speak.

He had never experienced this sort of taste before.

With his status, who dared to let him experience it?

While talking, there was a ripple in the void. A powerful aura appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

It was precisely Dao Ancestor Life, Lin Chaotian!

When he saw Lin Huan’s miserable state, he frowned and said, “Ye Yuan, enough!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and could not help laughing as he said, “Enough? Lin Chaotian, who do you think you’re talking to?”

Lin Chaotian smiled coldly and said, “Why? Do you still think that you’re that Saint Azure? You betrayed the human race. So we nine great Dao Ancestors have already jointly agreed to take back your title of Saint Azure! Why can’t this ancestor speak to you like this?”

Ye Yuan was indifferent as he said with a faint smile, “Saint Azure? Huhu, do you think that I’d care about this sort of empty reputation?”

Lin Chaotian said disdainfully, “Since you forsake the title of Saint Azure, could this ancestor as the number one Dao Ancestor, be afraid of you still? Moreover, the people around you are all complicit in your betrayal of the human race. You dare to act wildly on my Origin Enlighten Mountain?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Then I’ll let you take a look at what right I have to talk to you this way!”

Swoosh!

In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared.

Disappearing together with him was also Lin Huan.

Lin Chaotian’s expression changed, immediately having a foreboding premonition.

Puu, puu, puu ...

Several figures directly burst into clouds of blood mist, dying until not even dregs remained!

One of them was Lin Lang!

There were also several Deva Third Blights who died along with them.

Everyone opened their mouths wide, looking at that figure with shocked faces.

This ... Just who was holding back from taking action for fear of implications?

Lin Chaotian’s side had not killed anyone yet and Ye Yuan actually went on a killing spree already!

Lin Chaotian’s face turned grim and he said furiously, “Ye Yuan! Do you really take it as this ancestor doesn’t dare to kill people?”

Ye Yuan ignored him. His figure moved and actually disappeared from where he was once more.

Very soon, Lin Chaotian sensed Ye Yuan’s aura. He was actually heading in the direction of Origin Enlighten Mountain’s central region.

Lin Chaotian’s pupils constricted. That mountain peak was the place where a Deva Fifth Blight was at.

This person was his grandchild called Lin Xiu. His strength was even stronger than Lin Huan.

This fellow was actually going to kill a Deva Fifth Blight?

Lin Chaotian’s speed was very fast. But unfortunately, he was not as fast as Ye Yuan’s teleportation!

Ye Yuan already shook him off in just a blink of an eye!

His pupils shrunk and he said in shock, “Just how long has it been? This guy became significantly stronger again!”

Lin Chaotian did not dare to dawdle, his figure immediately flashing, shuttling into the void and chasing after.

Ye Yuan did not hide his tracks in the slightest. An extremely powerful aura headed for Understanding Peak.

Lin Xiu was currently cultivating when he suddenly felt a powerful aura rushing over head-on, and his brows could not help furrowing.

However, he took no notice of it. The look of this aura was also just like someone who newly entered Deva Fourth Blight; far worse than him.

It was only to see him take a step out, already meeting Ye Yuan.

“Who’s the arrival? To dare be unbridled in Origin Enlighten Bodhidharma, are you courting death?” Lin Xiu’s brows furrowed, already striking with a sword.

Ye Yuan’s speed was swift to the extreme, the Sword of Spacetime already in hand!

He did not say a word, lifting his hand, it was a sword!

“Courting death!”

Lin Xiu gave a cold snort, already genuinely enraged, urging his martial technique to the extreme.

Originally, he did not take it to heart.

But very soon, he felt that something was not right.

This sword of Ye Yuan’s had an unstoppable momentum!

Reaching Ye Yuan’s boundary, he already reached the realm of returning to one’s original simplicity.

Coming and going, it was one sword!

Swoosh!

The two figures intersected and passed by, in only an instant.

Ye Yuan did not stop, his figure disappearing again, already headed to another mountain in a threatening manner!

There was another Deva Fifth Blight!

Deva Fifth Blights were extremely rare in the outside world. But to a bodhidharma that had existed for ten billion years of time, their accumulation was naturally extraordinary.

Ye Yuan’s chaos origin divinity communicated with heaven and earth. Every powerhouse here could not escape his eyes and ears.

Lin Xiu’s figure was still stopped in midair as if scared silly.

But right then, Lin Chaotian had just arrived.

He took a look at Lin Xiu and his expression changed wildly!

Lin Xiu was already without any life force!

Ye Yuan’s sword was too fast, resulting in Lin Xiu still maintaining his original posture even after he died!

Crack!

The Dao artifact in Lin Xiu’s hand directly snapped into two.

Half of it was still grasped in his hand.

Then his head slipped off gently, his corpse falling softly.

It turned out that Lin Xiu was actually decapitated already!

Lin Chaotian’s heart shook wildly. What kind of situation was this?

Killed a Deva Fifth Blight with one sword?

One had to know, Deva Fifth Blights had reached the summit, and they were only a step away from Dao Ancestor!

Even if Lin Xiu was not a top Deva Fifth Blight, he was also not someone who could be killed with one sword!

How could Ye Yuan’s strength be formidable to such an extent?

Suddenly, he somewhat understood what the words Ye Yuan said meant!

And while he was in a daze, Ye Yuan’s figure already flew away from that mountain. He headed for the third mountain!

Another Deva Fifth Blight died?

Lin Chaotian completely could not describe the shock in his heart currently.

He, a Dao Ancestor, could only follow behind Ye Yuan and eat dust?

The last time he left, Ye Yuan was very strong but definitely not strong to such a degree!

Now, he could actually effortlessly kill Deva Fifth Blights already!

Suddenly, his expression changed greatly, and he said in alarm and anger, “Enough! Ye Yuan, this ancestor admits that you have the qualification to negotiate with me!”
