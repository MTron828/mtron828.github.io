Chapter 2249: Heavenly Eye

Above the sky of the huge pit, three figures slowly appeared.

The person in the middle had a sagely appearance, wearing a dark blue daoist robe.

While the other two people, one of them was precisely that gray-robed man who appeared that night above the huge pit.

There was another person, but he was a ghost path Heavenly Emperor!

The old daoist stroked his beard as he said coolly, “Shui Yuan, Lonesoul, two fellow daoists, you can find this old man to cast spells, but the benefits promised, don’t forget it!”

The muscles on the face of the gray-robed man, Heavenly Emperor Shui Yuan, twitched, and he said in a solemn voice, “Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye, rest assured. You’ve already received half of the deposit. Are you still afraid that we’ll renege on the debt?”

Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul also said, “Old Fart Heavenly Eye, forget that you demanded an exorbitant price! But you must help us find that guy!”

Heavenly Eye chuckled and said, “A Dao artifact coming into being, such a precious treasure is too valuable. This old man naturally can’t state a cheap price. As for finding the person, you all rest assured, if I, Heavenly Eye, say that I’m second, there’s absolutely no one who dare to claim that they are number one!”

Shui Yuan frowned and said, “Hurry up and start then!”

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye nodded slightly, hand-seals moving swiftly, and he gave a cold cry, “Heavenly eye, open!”

It was only to see that a third eye actually grew out between his eyebrows.

The moment this eye appeared, it seemed to see through everything, giving Shui Yuan and Lonesoul two people a hair-raising feeling.

“This old fart’s prowess is getting increasingly profound!” Shui Yuan said in shock.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s gaze swept over the huge pit and could not help shaking his head as he said with a sigh, “This place has already had all traces obliterated by you! Even if there’s anything, I can’t see it either.”

Shui Yuan’s expression turned stiff and he said awkwardly, “At that time, when that guy landed, he smashed a large hole in the ground. I arrived right on his heels, but I couldn’t see him. I guessed that he might have been saved by someone and planned on forcing them out.”

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye nodded slightly and said, “Go to other places and search for a bit then. As long as he leaves behind any clues or inkling, it definitely can’t escape my heavenly eye.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Done talking, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye brought the two people and searched in the vicinity.

This search was ten days and ten nights!

An area with a radius of a million miles was searched several times by the three people, but they did not discover the slightest trace.

Finally, Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul could not endure anymore and sarcastically, “Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye, didn’t you say that it can’t escape your arcane eyes? Could it be that that guy brought the Dao artifact and evaporated into thin air?”

Heavenly Eye’s expression was very ugly, the boasting previously had gone overboard.

These ten days, he expended tremendous effort to search but did not find a trace of clues too.

Having accepted people’s benefits, he found it embarrassing too.

“Mn?” Suddenly, his gaze turned sharp, and his footsteps stopped.

Seeing that Heavenly Eye seemed to have discovered something, Shui Yuan and Lonesoul’s minds quivered.

Heavenly Eye’s gaze landed at a corner of the woods. That place had layer upon layer of mountains, the trees dense, the terrain very complicated.

“We’ve searched this area many times before and didn’t discover anything!” Shui Yuan said.

Heavenly Eye did not speak. His gaze became more and more serious. His third eye erupted with rays of brilliant light. An aura of source spread out.

“Hiss ...”

Heavenly Eye drew a breath of cold air and said solemnly, “What a crafty fellow! What an ingenious array formation!”

Shui Yuan two people were uncertain what it meant and said, “What discovery is there, Daoist Heavenly Eye?”

“Follow me!”

Heavenly Eye brought the two people and landed in the forest. The place that they were standing was precisely Ye Yuan’s land of concealment previously.

Heavenly Eye walked around the surroundings and exclaimed with admiration, “No wonder we searched several dozen times and didn’t discover anything, it’s simply superb craftsmanship excelling nature, a marvelous work of art!”

Lonesoul’s face fell and he said, “Stop leaving us hanging! Quickly tell us!”

Heavenly Eye said, “Someone made use of the environment here and set up a seamless array formation, fusing into one entity with the surrounding environment. The person used the layering of space to conceal their aura! Even if divine sense sweeps past, you all can only sense a forest! The person who laid down the formation is absolutely a formation path expert! With such strength, I’m afraid that he might already be Deva Realm!”

Shui Yuan two people’s faces changed wildly. It turned out that he was right under their eyelids!

“This is impossible! if it’s a Deva Realm formation path powerhouse, why would he hide?” Shui Yuan said.

“This ... ”

Heavenly Eye could not help choking when he heard that and said, “This array formation is extremely ingenious. Ordinary rank eight formation gods will find it hard to attain it too. If not for my heavenly eye discovering a trace of spatial undulation aura, I wouldn’t be able to discover it at all! What can he be if not a Deva?”

Shui Yuan two people could not make up their minds too. After all, being able to hide from their divine sense probing, it was definitely not what ordinary people could do.

Moreover, they practically dug three feet into the ground in this radius of a million miles!

“Heavenly Eye, don’t you have time recall? Hurry up and take a look!” Lonesoul suddenly said.

Heavenly Eye nodded slightly, both hands pointing at his eyes as he said, “Time recall! Heavenly eye, open!”

His third eye suddenly opened, emitting rays of light. An aura that came from the Great Dao source suddenly descended.

Then, one scene after another seemed to be rewinding, playing back.

Suddenly, a young figure flew in reverse and returned. He brought along a ghost empyrean and a man in white clothing by his side.

“It’s him!”

Seeing the man in white, Shui Yuan and Lonesoul cried out in surprise at the same time.

The scenery faded, the three people exchanged a glance, all seeing the thick shock from the other parties’ eyes.

“Empyrean! The one who rescued this guy was actually just an Empyrean! This array formation was actually just set up by an Empyrean!” Heavenly Eye said in shock.

Earlier, he actually thought that it was a Deva Realm formation master!

This disparity ... was too inconceivable.

Suddenly, Shui Yuan’s gaze turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “A mere Empyrean also dares to pull a tooth from a tiger’s mouth? He’s really tired of living! Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye!”

Heavenly Eye nodded slightly, since they found the source, then finding the person naturally would not be difficult either.

Only to see his heavenly eye open, one trail after another quietly unfolded in front of him.

The three people chased after Ye Yuan’s tracks.

... ...

These few years, the shock in Riverword’s heart great increasingly stronger.

This measly little Empyrean in front of him actually really forced out the Dao accumulations within his body little by little!

His injuries were gradually improving.

Ye Yuan used sword energy golden needles to seal the acupoints in his body shut and isolated the Dao accumulations within his body little by little.

Then, dividing and attacking, he forced it out of the body bit by bit.

Talking about it was simple, but that was Dao accumulations, injuries left behind by Deva Realm powerhouses!

A measly little Empyrean actually forced out the Dao accumulations of Deva Realm powerhouses.

This kind of thing, even Heavenly Emperors could not do it!

The shock in Riverword’s heart could be imagined.

“Huff ... I finally forced it all out! Deva Realm powerhouses are indeed extraordinary!” Ye Yuan wiped the sweat on his head and said in surprise.

The healing this time was the most troublesome one for him up to this date.

Those Dao accumulations rampaged recklessly within Riverword’s body and were incomparably ferocious.

Only his source sword energy could accomplish it to this degree.

Even so, he was also trembling with fear and trepidation, akin to treading on thin ice.

Many streams of aura ran amuck in the meridians. Furthermore, Ye Yuan could only guide them.

A slight carelessness and Riverword would directly croak.

Fortunately, everything was still rather smooth, finally saving this fellow.

After he was done, Ye Yuan threw him a medicinal pill and said coolly, “Eat that. It will help with recovering your meridians.”
