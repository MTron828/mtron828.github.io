Chapter 1270: Dao Defying Formed, Divine Realm in Danger!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In order to take revenge in this life, that was the reason why Ye Yuan stepped onto the martial path.

Even though his Martial Dao talent was exceedingly high, in his bones, he was still that alchemist who pursued the limits of Alchemy Dao unrelentingly.

Before reincarnating, Ye Yuan’s comprehension of Alchemy Dao already reached a profound level.

Otherwise, he also could not create the Dao Defying Pill, such a fantastical medicinal pill.

But in the previous life, his divine soul realm was lacking and kept feeling that there was a layer of windowpane paper not poked through.

In this life, not only did he obtain the Medicine God’s Soul Canon, he even obtained several Divine Dao cultivation methods and martial techniques, and his comprehension towards Heavenly Dao was even deeper.

In addition, he acquired the World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl in this life. All of the elements added up, formed the present Ye Yuan.

This Ten Directions Heaven Seizing Art, as Ye Yuan refined the pills using this technique, his entire person gradually became sublimated.

Through this Tai Chi diagram in front of him, Ye Yuan actually felt a sense of looking down on all life.

Right now, he felt like he was refining a medicinal pill with heaven and earth as the furnace!

Finally, the Dao Defying Pill’s refinement entered the final juncture.

That Tai Chi diagram suddenly released a dazzling light, piercing until everyone could not open their eyes. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

With Ye Yuan as the center, it formed an enormous vortex. Terrifying essence energy swarmed over towards this vortex.

It was akin to trickling streams, converging to form a sea.

Ye Yuan was completely enveloped by the light. Outside, Li-er and the rest already completely could not see what was happening inside anymore.

They only sensed that it was as if the entire world was exerting great efforts for Ye Yuan to refine the medicinal pill!

“If not for seeing it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe at all that one could still refine like this! This is the true perfection of Alchemy Dao!” Gu Yue said with an emotional sigh.

He was born in an alchemy path noble family, his horizons exceedingly high. But this spectacle in front of him, he did not dare to imagine at all.

This sight was deeply engraved in his mind, becoming his lifelong pursuit.

Of course, not just him, Ren Dong also smiled bitterly and said, “These few years, I cultivated bitterly every minute and second. Originally, I thought that I could approach Master a little. But only now do I know that we are people from completely different worlds with him! However, I’ll definitely catch up to his footsteps.”

Spurred into motion under this vortex, nine medicinal embryos were currently revolving at extremely high speed.

The faster the vortex spun, the faster the medicinal embryos spun as well.

Gradually, that massive light contracted, becoming smaller and smaller.

That Tai Chi diagram was similarly gradually shrinking.

Finally, all of the storms converged onto Ye Yuan’s palm.

A dark red medicinal pill suspended above his palm quietly.

Everyone scrambled forward, all sizing up the pill and Ye Yuan like curious babies.

“Big Brother, how ... do you feel?” White Light said.

“Master, this is the Dao Defying Pill? I can’t tell what special aspects it has! Such a heaven-defying pill actually doesn’t even have pill tribulation!” Xiao Ruyan said.

Ye Yuan smiled but said nothing. But Kunwu came up and said with a smile, “Refining the pill with Great Dao, this medicinal pill obtained the recognition of Heavenly Dao. Even Heavenly Dao didn’t say anything, who would send down heavenly tribulation?”

“Grand-teacher, you’re really too amazing! In my view, an Alchemy God is nothing more than this, right?” Gu Yue sighed with admiration.

Ye Yuan sized up the Dao Defying Pill in the palm of his hand. But this current mood was unusually calm, far from the anticipation and uneasiness before the refinement.

He knew that he must have succeeded!

Kunwu smiled and said, “Fine lad, you already obtained the recognition of Heavenly Dao. In the future, when your strength is sufficient, you’ll be able to replace Old Fart Immortal Grove, becoming this empyrean world’s master!”

Kunwu thought that Ye Yuan would be extremely excited by this news. After all, in his opinion, the master of an empyrean world, that was a supreme existence.

Even he could not achieve this step either.

But he was disappointed.

Ye Yuan’s expression was very calm and was not moved in the slightest over this sentence.

“Master of an empyrean world is it? Senior, even if I really became the Immortal Grove Region’s controller, what I walk will just be Senior Immortal Grove’s Dao as well. Although his Dao is strong, if I walk according to his path, I’ll never surpass him for life” Ye Yuan said calmly.

Kunwu’s gaze turned intent, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

He did not think that Ye Yuan actually said such a thing!

Controlling an empyrean world, even a dilapidated empyrean world, this was a tremendous temptation outside.

Few people could resist this kind of temptation!

But Ye Yuan actually said this kind of words that swept down irresistibly from a commanding height. It truly made him sigh endlessly with admiration.

If this were in the outside world, Kunwu absolutely would not be surprised.

But this was the Immortal Grove Region!

To him, Ye Yuan was a mortal!

A mortal, suddenly controlling a world, becoming the hegemon of a world, how great a temptation was this?

But Ye Yuan was actually unmoved!

“Heh, you, boy, are indeed extraordinary. No wonder you can get picked by Immortal Grove! What you said is right, any great achiever must have their own Dao. It’s just that even though this path has limitless potential, it’s incomparably arduous. There are really barely anyone with the courage to walk this path,” Kunwu said solemnly.

Kunwu still had some words that he did not say. It was not that there were none who walked this path, but the majority of them all failed.

In other words, to the vast majority, they were all overestimating their ability!

Moreover, Ye Yuan had not walked out of this empyrean world yet.

These words were a bit too boastful.

How could Ye Yuan not perceive Kunwu’s insinuation? It was just that he did not care and said smilingly, “I’d rather be ground to dust than fade into mediocrity!”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s resolute eyes, Kuneu fell silent and did not speak.

In his heart, he was somewhat disdainful.

Ye Yuan’s talent was indeed terrifying, but that was also merely just in this empyrean world.

The outside world’s powerhouses’ starting points were different from this empyrean world!

But toward Ye Yuan’s way of thinking, Kunwu still secretly praised with admiration.

To be able to have such ideas, it was already not that easy.

“Haha, it’s far away! Food has to be eaten mouthful by mouthful. Now isn’t the time to sit and debate on Dao. When I resolve the crisis of the fiend race, it won’t be too late to think about these again,” Ye Yuan laughed loudly and said.

“Master, are you going to consume this Dao Defying Pill right now?” Xiao Ruyan said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Time won’t wait for me! I’m currently racing with Kanuo, it will depend on who can run faster! Wait for me to adjust my breathing for a bit, and I’ll prepare to break through!”

Ye Yuan did not have much time to waste. He knew that Kanuo was also seizing every minute and second to recover his strength.

Entering this Godsfall Mountain Range already wasted a lot of time.

Now, it will depend on who could succeed first!

A day later, Ye Yuan’s Essence, Energy, Spirit, were all adjusted to their peak condition. He delivered that dark red Dao Defying Pill into his mouth.

...

At virtually the same time, Kanuo finally exited seclusion and led the fiend race army to bear down upon the borders!

The fiend race retaliating in full force, making Fang Tian realize that Kanuo was probably not far from leaving seclusion already.

Hence, he pulled back all of the lines of defense and withdrew all of the humans back to the Demon Region, planning to deal with this final battle.

“Fang Tian, this deity is back! Starting from today, this Immortal Grove Region, belongs to me, Kanuo!”

Kanuo’s voice was akin to rolling thunders, reverberating through the skies of the dragon clan.
