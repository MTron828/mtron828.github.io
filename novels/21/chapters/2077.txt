Chapter 2081: Understand or Not

Three days later, Ice Cloud Tower’s Eldest Senior Sister He Xiangyun escorted Lu-er and arrived at Grand Pill Establishment.

In order to set Empyrean Ice Cloud’s mind at ease, Ye Yuan agreed to her terms.

All in all, talk about it again after seeing Lu-er first.

But Ye Yuan’s requirement was having Empyrean Ice Cloud’s eldest disciple personally escorting her over. Because in this way, it would show sincerity.

“Damn lass, let me tell you this. Don’t have any lousy ideas! With me around, you can’t go anywhere!” He Xiangyun said viciously.

Lu-er looked straight ahead and could not be bothered to acknowledge

Actually, she was long overjoyed in her heart already.

Indeed, Young Master is different from the rest when doing things!

If it were others, they would either charge into Ice Cloud Tower desperately or think of ways to infiltrate into Ice Cloud Tower to save people.

But her young master was good. He directly made her master deliver her to the doorstep willingly.

For more than half a year, Lu-er had been thinking of what method her young master would use to rescue her every day.

She thought of countless possibilities but never thought of this kind of method before.

You came to save people and even had the other party obediently deliver the person that you wanted to save in front of you.

This kind of means was truly fantastical.

This was ... having to help you count money after being sold, right?

Lu-er thought mischievously in her heart.

“Also, Master Ji enjoys a high prestige and commands universal respect, his strength being immensely formidable. If you dare to rebut him at all, I’ll definitely tear you to shreds! Huh, heard that?”

Seeing Lu-er ignore her, He Xiangyun could not help getting irritated.

“Relax, Eldest Senior Sister. The matter concerns Ice Cloud Tower’s future, Lu-er knows the importance,” Lu-er said coolly.

Although Lu-er had been dissatisfied with Empyrean Ice Cloud these recent few years, she had a pure heart and still had more gratitude toward Empyrean Ice Cloud than resentment.

After all, in this 1000 years, it was Empyrean Ice Cloud who imparted to her cultivation method, giving her what she had today.

“Humph! Hope that you know what’s good for you! We’re about to enter Grand Pill Establishment right away. Behave yourself!” He Xiangyun said with a cold snort.

The two people entered Grand Pill Establishment. Under Song Cao’s lead, they entered the hall.

The moment Lu-er entered the door, she saw that young and handsome figure who appeared slightly skinny. Her entire person immediately froze there.

Even if a thousand years had passed, even if Ye Yuan’s present looks had changed a lot now, Lu-er still recognized at a glance.

This figure lived in her mind every day, lived in her dream, and had never been forgotten.

What did she wander for hundreds of millions of miles, arriving at this land of hardship, endured the disparaging and scorn of her junior and senior apprentice sisters, and whipping punishment for?

Wasn’t it to not become his burden anymore?

But who knew that in the end, Young Master still had to run around for hundreds of millions of miles and come to this land of extreme north to save her.

Thinking up to here, her tears wanted to burst forth from her eyes uncontrollably.

Lu-er was currently thinking of diving toward Ye Yuan, but she noticed that Ye Yuan was currently giving her a look, only then abruptly startling awake.

Right now was not the time to identify each other yet!

Empyrean Loneswan was currently seating next to Ye Yuan.

“Ice Cloud Tower He Xiangyun pays respect to Master Ji!” When He Xiangyun saw Ye Yuan, she bowed respectfully.

Seeing that Lu-er was still in a daze, her face turned cold and she said in a deep voice, “Sl*t, what are you stoning there for? Why haven’t you hurrying up and coming over to pay respects to Master Ji?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As she said, she was about to make a move to deal with Lu-er.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, his expression turning cold as he said with a cold yell, “Insolence!”

He Xiangyun did not figure out the situation and said with a cold smile, “Sl*t, heard that? You’re too impudent!”

“I’m talking about you!” Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said in a cold voice.

Actually, the killing intent in Ye Yuan’s heart currently already filled his chest.

He saw how Lu-er spent these few years in Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s memories.

This He Xiangyun was the main culprit!

Furthermore, with Ye Yuan’s eyesight, how could he not tell that Lu-er currently had a great deal of hidden injuries on her body. Clearly, she had suffered considerable torment.

Just looking at He Xiangyun’s attitude, Ye Yuan could guess that these were likely related to her.

It was just that due to Empyrean Loneswan being present, Ye Yuan could not make a move.

Otherwise, the current He Xiangyun would already be a dead person.

“Ah? Me?” He Xiangyun was stunned, clearly not believing it.

It was clearly this lass who did not have manners, so how did it become me who was insolent instead?

However, before she could react, Ye Yuan gave a cold yell again, “Loneswan, slap her mouth!”

Loneswan was taken aback but did not dare to defy, sending a slap over with a whoosh.

He also did not understand why Ye Yuan was hitting He Xiangyun, but he heard Ye Yuan’s fury.

Spending a long time with Ye Yuan, he had also grasped a little of Ye Yuan’s temperament. Therefore, he did not hold back in this slap.

How could the slap of an Empyrean be what He Xiangyun could block?

Even if she was able to react to it, she did not dare to block too!

Smack!

An extremely resounding slap smacked on He Xiangyun’s face, directly smacking her flying out.

All the way until that moment she was sent flying, He Xiangyun still did not able to understand what was going on.

Junior Apprentice Sister was disrespectful to you, Master Ji. Was there anything wrong if I am disciplining my junior apprentice sister?

But Loneswan knew how far to go when he made his move. Although this slap was loud, it was not lethal.

After all, He Xiangyun was Ice Cloud Tower’s eldest disciple. If this slap smacked her to death, wouldn’t that old lady come find him to fight it out?

But Ye Yuan’s order, he carried it out without the slightest hesitation.

When He Xiangyun crawled to her feet, half of her face was already swollen badly.

It was only to see that she had a confused look, clearly not understanding why Ye Yuan wanted to hit her.

Ye Yuan seemed to have seen through what she was thinking and said with a cold smile, “Understood why I hit you or not?”

He Xiangyun understood that Ye Yuan was presently the extreme north’s big shot. Even her master did not dare to provoke too. She could only endure this slap.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s question, He Xiangyun shook her head very innocently.

“Don’t even understand why I hit you? Stupid! Loneswan, hit again!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Loneswan’s expression changed, but he still followed Ye Yuan’s order. Another slap landed on the left side of He Xiangyun’s face, sending her flying to the other side.

How heavy was the slap of an Empyrean?

Even if Empyrean Loneswan controlled his strength, these two slaps were also enough for her to suffer.

On the two sides of He Xiangyun’s face, the mark of ten fingers was very distinct, as if imprinted on it.

Two slaps made He Xiangyun see stars and also could not figure out where was north, south, east, and west.

After He Xiangyun recovered slightly, Ye Yuan asked again coolly, “Now, do you understand?”

How could He Xiangyun still dare to shake her head? She hurriedly nodded her head and said incoherently, “U-Understood, understood!”

Who knew that Ye Yuan shouted coldly again, “Loneswan, hit again!”

With this, even Loneswan somewhat pitied He Xiangyun.

But he did not have the intention of holding back. Another slap flew over, He Xiangyun was sent flying once more.

Only after she crawled to her feet did Ye Yuan say coolly, “Clearly didn’t understand, but pretend to understand, deserves to be hit!”

He Xiangyun had ten million profanities galloping across in her head currently.

Your reason for hitting people is really a good reason!

It was absolutely out of the question for her to dare say these words out. But He Xiangyun already had tears pouring down her face now, clearly feeling wronged.

“Humph! In this Grand Pill Establishment, who kneels and who doesn’t kneel, it’s my call. It’s ot your turn to come and gesture here and there! Now, understand?” Ye Yuan looked at He Xiangyun coldly and said calmly.

He Xiangyun nodded her head painfully, her face covered with tears.

What the hell is this!
