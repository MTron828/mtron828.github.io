Seeing Zhu Wen’s incomparably shocked expression, Ye Yuan said with an amused look, “Looks like you’re very disappointed.”

The corners of Zhu Wen’s mouth twitched, finally recovering with the shock. He seemed slightly awkward as he laughed dryly twice and said, “I already said, that ...that was just an accident.”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “You’re really very weak. So what if it was deliberate? Your gaze is flickered all over the place, and you don’t even dare to look straight into my eyes. A person like you doesn’t even have the qualifications to be a bad guy. No wonder you’re depressed and failed to achieve your ambition at the temple.”

A cold aura crept out when Ye Yuan was saying this.

Zhu Wen looked at Ye Yuan angrily, somewhat turning angry from the initial embarrassment.

Zhu Wen gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Punk, you’re challenging my bottom-line!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Challenging your bottom-line? Then you come and kill me! Want to kill me, come openly and aboveboard. With your strength, I’m not a match. See, you don’t dare again. You have no status in the temple. If you kill the disciples who came to participate in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, the temple will hold you accountable. In the end, it’s still that you’re too weak!”

“Enough! Shut up for me!” Zhu Wen said with an angry roar.

Ye Yuan’s words struck the heart one by one, virtually about to shatter his mind.

Xu Yan looked at the crazed Zhu Wen, incomparably shocked in his heart.

Ye Yuan made a Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse’s Dao heart almost collapse with a few words.

This was really killing people without seeing blood!

With Xu Yan’s eyesight, he could naturally tell that Zhu Wen’s Dao heart already reached the verge of collapse. This could inevitably cause tremendous hindrance to his future cultivation.

Zhu Wen who was originally already struggling to stride forward in the temple, after this it was probably hard for him to stand up again this time.

Ye Yuan shook his head as he smiled and said, “Entering the temple doesn’t mean getting it over with once and for all. One would instead enter an even more cruel environment. Even if I don’t say it out loud, your weakness cannot be changed too. A person like you doesn’t even have the qualifications to become my opponent. Elder Xu, let’s go.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan walked over toward the building on the island first.

This place had powerful restrictions everywhere. Even True God powerhouses were unable to fly in the air too.

For Ye Yuan to be able to come over from the Spirit Nether Sea by treading on the waves, it was not because Ye Yuan could ignore these powerful restrictions, but that the place Zhu Wen threw him at, the restrictions were too weak.

In those places with powerful restrictions, Zhu Wen did not dare to act carelessly too.

Otherwise, it would not be throwing Ye Yuan down, but it would be him being buried with Ye Yuan.

And along the way, Ye Yuan had pretty much grasped the Spirit Nether Sea’s restrictions long ago.

Coupled with that there was Zhu Wen himself guiding in front, it was not that surprising for Ye Yuan to be able to come out.

The party walked onto the island. A bunch of well-arranged palaces appeared in front of everyone.

“Bamboo Groove Holy Realm!”

There was an enormous archway ahead with four big characters written on it, Bamboo Groove Holy Realm.

“It’s said that this place is just the tip of the iceberg of the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm, the only place in the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm that’s opened up to the public, and also where the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave is at,” Xu Yan explained.

Ye Yuan came to a realization and was just about to enter the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm when he heard a loud noise coming from the island.

Bang!

Back of the mountain, a building was directly blown up, the entire roof blown off, looking spectacular.

Xu Yan’s face changed and he said, “What happened? Could it be that someone dares to cause trouble in the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm?”

Ye Yuan said, “It’s fine. That should be a furnace explosion. But being able to produce such great power, the alchemist’s standard shouldn’t be weak.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Xueyan was suddenly very curious and asked, “How is he compared to you?”

Ever since Ye Yuan stepped into Celestial Deity Realm, Jiang Xueyan never had the idea of making things difficult for him anymore.

She knew that Ye Yuan’s rise was already unstoppable.

The Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave this time, Ye Yuan’s hopes were even greater than Baili Qingyan’s.

As for how great, no one knew right now.

All in all, he was definitely very strong!

The Yi Qingxiang by the side also had the same thought as Jiang Xueyan.

He did not wish to become a second Qian Ye. Opposing Ye Yuan, that was equivalent to seeking death.

Ye Yuan gave Jiang Xueyan a glance and said smilingly, “I’ve never blown up my furnace before. Of course, if I insist on doing it, it will at least be 100 times more powerful than this.”

Including Xu Yan, the few people’s pupils constricted.

They had never seen before Ye Yuan’s pill refining strength. But from the medicinal pill he gave Baili Qingyan, they could tell that his strength was definitely very formidable.

But, 100 times stronger than the explosion just now, they felt that it was somewhat fantastical.

One had to know, inside pill refining rooms all had protective arrays. To be able to directly blow off that building’s roof was already very horrifying.

100 times stronger than this, what kind of concept was that?

“Tch! Ignorant fool, who do you think you are? 100 times more powerful than that just now, do you know what it means?”

When the Zhu Wen who had been silent all along heard this, he finally could not resist jeering.

But Ye Yuan did not seem to hear it at all, lifting his leg and leaving.

Along the way, Zhu Wen finally managed to make his state of mind calm down a bit. Ye Yuan’s attitude made the evil fire in his heart flare up with a whoosh.

“Hey, I’m talking to you, are you deaf?” Zhu Wen said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Are you talking to me? I only hear a dog anyhow barking.”

Zhu Wen’s face changed and he was just about to speak, but then he heard Ye Yuan continue coolly saying, “I said it before, if you don’t dare to kill me, then keep your mouth shut, so as to avoid asking for trouble!”

Zhu Wen’s eyes seemingly spewed fire, and he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Punk, let’s wait and see! You’ll regret it one day!”

Ye Yuan pursed his lips, a disdainful look on his face as he continued walking ahead.

Under Zhu Wen’s lead, the Shadowmoon Sect party arrived at a bunch of thatched houses at the borders of the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm.

“This is your residence!” Zhu Wen said lightly.

Xu Yan’s face fell and he said, “Zhu Wen, you’re really too outrageous! If I didn’t remember wrongly, this should be the woodshed, right?”

Zhu Wen pursed his lips and said, “Supporting role sects like you all still want to have any good treatment? I reckon that you guys can’t stay too long either and will be sent packing back home very soon.”

The Shadowmoon Sect’s few people were all filled with righteous indignation. This guy was clearly using his position to get even with a personal grudge.

Ye Yuan did not care and said coolly, “Woodshed then, cultivators take the world to be their homes, why would we care about this?”

Xu Yan’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan in surprise.

This boy could have such talent, yet remain indifferent when granted favors or be subjected to humiliation.

To be able to say these words showed that he already saw through the secular world, his heart realm reaching no idea what kind of realm already.

Even Xu Yan was also ashamed of his inferiority.

Ye Yuan’s words made Zhu Wen’s face turn black.

He originally vented his pent-up feelings on some pretext. Who knew that Ye Yuan did not fall for it and even said these words.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a pink object turned into a stream of light and bored right into Ye Yuan’s embrace.

Even Ye Yuan had a baffled look too.

“Treasure Pig, where did you run to, Treasure Pig?” Very soon, a childish voice was heard.
