Chapter 2575: Bullying People

“This … This is a joke, right? You guys have already been confirmed dead at that time!” Duan Tao had a look of horror, full of disbelief.

Especially Du Qian, he personally inspected him, and he was absolutely deader than dead. How could he possibly come back to life again?

Du Qian sneered and said, “I thought that I was dead too, but I was saved by Master Ye! Your Father’s life will be Master Ye’s in the future!”

Ma Liang also said, “That’s right! Your Father is someone who has died once. This life will be sold to Master Ye in the future!”

The four people who were brought back to life made known their attitudes one after another.

They all knew how severe their injuries were back then.

That was right, it should be said that they were dead men!

But Ye Yuan actually had the ability to revive the dead, forcefully dragging them back from King Yama’s hall.

Duan Tao this bunch of people looked toward Ye Yuan with looks of amazement, being shocked speechless.

They thought that Ye Yuan was an opportunist plus a coward.

But they did not expect that he was actually a big shot!

Master Lin that they worshiped was actually Ye Yuan’s disciple!

If not for seeing with their own eyes, they would not believe it at all!

“It turns out that Brother Ye is actually a miracle-working doctor! No wonder Lord Luo personally guided you over! Brother Ye master and disciple helped our Green Bull Town out a great deal.” As Yao Qing said, he gave a bow to Ye Yuan.

“What! Lord Yao, Lord Luo that you speak of, could it be … Jade Face Swordsman, Lord Luo Yunqing?” Duan Tao exclaimed in surprise.

Yao Qing nodded and said, “Who else is there apart from him?”

“It’s actually him!”

“Lord Luo actually came to guide Master Ye personally!”

“This is a great honor!”

… …

Usually, only some Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratums would be sent out to guide these ascenders.

A very small number would send out Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses.

But there were none who could make Luo Yunqing personally guide an ascendeder at all!

But Ye Yuan could actually make Lord Luo Yunqing as a guide personally. This in itself indicated many problems!

Some of these ascenders had already stayed in Green Bull Town for a long time and naturally knew of Luo Yunqing’s awe-inspiring reputation.

This was a big shot who made even the entire Jadetrue Heavenly Sect extremely apprehensive!

It was extremely hard for them to even see Luo Yunqing once; let alone talk about being guided personally.

“This … This … This lowly one had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Master Ye, please punish!” Duan Tao’s forehead broke out in cold sweat and he said respectfully.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s not a big deal. No need to mind it. It’s getting late. Brother Yao, let’s set off.”

Yao Qing nodded and took a flying boat out of the storage bracelet that he carried on him.

The party rode the flying boat and whizzed away.

… …

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, being hidden among ten thousand mountains, had a majestic and grand atmosphere.

This place gathered the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and there were faint signs of dragons prancing for ten thousand miles.

Everyone landed, and they were stunned by the scenery before their eyes.

“My Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is one of Five Light Heavenly Region’s five great heavenly sects. It’s quite a lot stronger than Jadetrue Heavenly Sect too! However, wanting to stay in the sect, it will have to depend on your talents and strength,” Yao Qing said.

“Heh,?Lord Yao, I, Duan Tao’s talent, is one in a million! It’s naturally not difficult to enter the heavenly sect!” Duan Tao said confidently. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Yao Qing could not help laughing as he said, “It’s no use for you to boast here to me. Those capable of ascending to the 33 Heavens, which one isn’t of outstanding talent? But that’s also just in your world! The 33 Heavens isn’t as simple as you think! Just having good talent in small chiliocosms is useless!”

Duan Tao still did not believe it and was secretly holding it in.

The other ascenders naturally did not believe it either.

For these people to be able to ascend from small chiliocosms or great trichiliocosms, they all advanced in the midst of slaughter and grew up in the midst of struggle.

Each one was of the very best talent.

How arrogant at heart and haughty in manner were these people? How could they believe that they were unable to pass a mere sect assessment?

Yao Qing led everyone to a mountain peak in the front range and said to everyone, “The heavenly sect’s assessment is once every ten years! This incident happened suddenly, so we’re returning to the heavenly sect early. There’s still a year to the sect assessment. This period of time, you will be cultivating here. This place is where servants live. Although you all don’t need to do miscellaneous chores, you’ll still be subjected to the constraints of the heavenly sect! Of course, if there are those who can’t stand it, you can leave the heavenly sect and enter ordinary countries.”

“Your Excellency, what’s there that can’t be endured? Isn’t it just one year, it will pass very quickly,” Duan Tao said indifferently.

Yao Qing just smiled and did not talk.

He turned to Ye Yuan and said, “Brother Ye, I’ve arranged a first-class residence for you, follow me.”

Everyone naturally had no objections regarding this.

Yao Qing arranged a courtyard for Ye Yuan and had him live with Lin Lan.

Settling Ye Yuan down, Yao Qing returned to the sect.

He had to report Green Bull Town’s matter to the sect.

Luo Yunqing left in a hurry and did not have time to hand over many things.

Ye Yuan was a stranger in a strange land in Martial Secure Heavenly Sect. It was naturally inconvenient to flash his identity as a protector too.

Everything still had to wait for Luo Yunqing to return before talking.

After all, a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum taking on the post of the heavenly sect’s protector was seriously too outrageous.

Ye Yuan was also not some young and inexperienced fledgling. He naturally would not think that the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was an otherworldly paradise.

In reality, the way Ye Yuan saw it, Five Light Heavenly Region’s living environment might be even crueler than True Yang Heavenly Domain.

After all, ascenders were all people who were decisive in going for the kill, their personalities were quite different from native powerhouses.

What he expected was right, the next day, something happened already.

Duan Tao, Ma Liang, and the rest, all went to find Ye Yuan with bloody noses and swollen faces.

One of Duan Tao’s legs was actually broken directly, even his bone was poking out.

Looking at the few people, Ye Yuan said speechlessly, “The few of you can really cause trouble! Just one day and you guys already clashed with those servants?”

Duan Tao grimaced in pain and said, “Master Ye, they … are bullying people too much!”

Ma Liang also said, “Yeah! That Li Zhuo is unreasonable, he came to find us early this morning, and made us each hand over 30 pieces of heavenly crystals according to the number of people! One less piece, break one leg! For the few of us, our situation is slightly better and can still hand it over. But the majority of the people can’t take out so many heavenly crystals! Duan Tao was furious and had a quarrel with that Li Zhuo. In the end, it became like this!”

Ye Yuan asked curiously, “Those servants shouldn’t have reached Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum too, right? Duan Tao, you’re at the grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven Realm, and yet you’re actually not a match?”

The moment Duan Tao heard, he wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

He only dared to take action because he saw that the other party had strength that was similar to his.

But who knew that he did not even survive three moves and was crippled.

Ma Liang said, “These servants are really very strong! Duan Tao’s strength is the strongest among us. But he was actually crippled in three moves! They even said that tomorrow is the deadline. If we can’t hand over the heavenly crystals, each person will have two legs broken!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “For the Five Light Heavenly Region to be able to forcibly carve out a great heavenly region in the crevice of the four great heavenly regions, it’s naturally extremely strong! It looks like I also somewhat looked down on the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! Lin Lan, fetch some heavenly crystals for them and let them make do with it a bit tomorrow.”
