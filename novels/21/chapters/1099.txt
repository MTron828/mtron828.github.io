Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Didn’t you want to take revenge for him? Just now, sending yourself forward, and I’d be dead. Such a fine opportunity, you actually let it pass. Really feel not worth it for that dog of yours!”

Ye Yuan had a look of heartache, deeply piercing Zhao Lingdong.

“Awoo ... Awoo ...”

The Howling Sky Divine Hound let out two howls right then, seemingly cheering Zhao Lingdong on.

Zhao Lingdong’s expression turned cold, and he said, “Brat, don’t pull that trick with me! The feelings between Howlsky and me, you’ll never understand! Killing you, there can be a myriad of ways!”

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Is that so? You guys even brought out the Mountain and River State Painting. Didn’t it fail to kill me too? Do you think that the son of heaven’s mandate is that easy to kill?”

“Wouldn’t I know if I try? Fierce Wind Absolute Domain!”

The moment Zhao Lingdong’s divine king domain opened up, within a 1500 feet radius, it turned into a sea of wind.

That swift and fierce wind were akin to small blades, slicing up everything in the space.

Exchanging a blow earlier, he discovered that Ye Yuan’s reaction was seriously too quick. His advantage in speed could not be unleashed at all.

Hence, he decided to directly use cultivation realm to overpower Ye Yuan!

As long as he dragged until Datong and Santong came, with the combined power of everyone, could Ji Qingyun overturn the heavens still?

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a light smile, “Then this young master will take a look at just how much capability you, this dog person, have!”

Ye Yuan took out the Evil Extermination Sword and released his divine king domain fully. He was actually going to clash with Zhao Lingdong head-on!

Seeing this scene, Zhao Lingdong could not help being secretly delighted in his heart.

After breaking through to the Fourth Level Dao Profound, Ye Yuan’s divine king domain already reached 150 feet.

Through the Evil Extermination Sword’s boost, his divine king domain reached as vast as 900 feet all at once and was already very close to 1000 feet.

But just this tiny bit of disparity, the gap between him and Zhao Lingdong was not just a little bit.

If attacking with the divine king domain, Ye Yuan would be bound to suffer a loss. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Haha,

just the likes of you want to measure my strength too? So what even if you have a divine artifact?”

Zhao Lingdong let out a roaring laugh and suddenly urged his Fierce Wind Absolute Domain, crushing over towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan slowly shut his eyes. A terrifying sword intent surged to the skies.

“Limitless Life-Death Sword!”

Ye Yuan used divine essence without being the least bit stingy, making the Limitless Life-Death Sword’s power rise to another level!

Rumble!

Two terrifying attacks collided in midair. Ye Yuan was still significantly worse in the end and directly had a large mouthful of blood blasted out by the violent energy.

“Blind reckless fool! En? Want to run? How can it be that easy?!”

Borrowing this tremendous recoil force, Ye Yuan’s figure sped towards the depths like lightning, directly merging into heaven and earth.

Zhao Lingdong’s expression turned cold, and he chased after with incredible speed.

Ye Yuan had never thought about clashing head-on with Zhao Lingdong before. Zhao Lingdong, this kind of powerhouse, was still not what the present Ye Yuan could forcefully contend with.

Moreover, Ye Yuan was able to sense that Mo Datong and Mo Santong were already chasing on the way.

If he lingered, there was only a path that led to death.

Even if Ye Yuan was any more heaven-defying, it was also impossible to resist the besiegement of four great Void Mystic powerhouses. There were still divine artifacts in the other two person’s hands.

Right from the beginning of this attack, he had his mind set on escaping.

Ye Yuan ignored the injuries on his body and urged his movement technique to the limits.

At the same time, he swallowed a healing medicinal pill and essence energy recovering medicinal pill, so as to ensure his endurance kept up.

Zhao Lingdong discovered to his dismay that although he was that little bit faster than Ye Yuan, it was very limited.

Howlsky having a wing chopped off by Ye Yuan, disregarding the great loss in vitality, his speed also dropped drastically.

Without Howlsky, he had no way of catching up to Ye Yuan within a short time at all.

Zhao Lingdong’s teeth gnashed till it clattered. Only now did he discover that ever since Ye Yuan discovered their ambush, the actions at every step all went through meticulous planning!

From casting Moonlight Mirage and escaping, to using the Nine-Nine Illusionary Spirit Heaven Slaughter Formation to kill Mo Ertong, then to concealing within the void to sneak attack Howlsky.

This series of actions was actually just for the sake of one purpose, which was to escape!

Eliminate all the factors that affected his escape!

...

This carried on for nine days and nine nights!

Finally, the transmission array that led to the fifth level appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

He did not have the slightest hesitation. Urging his movement technique to the limits, he dove head first into the transmission array.

At this time, Zhao Lingdong also rushed over.

After seeing Ye Yuan enter the fifth level, a look of struggle surfaced on Zhao Lingdong’s face.

The fifth level was rather dangerous to him as well.

Once provoked those powerful existences inside, even if it was him, he would be dead for sure too.

“Damn it! This brat has a large stock of Tier 9 medicinal pills on him. He’s not afraid of dragging it out with us at all!” Zhao Lingdong gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Ye Yuan borrowed that recoil force and directly pulled far apart from Zhao Lingdong. Merging into heaven and earth again, he shook Zhao Lingdong off all at once.

With that, he became a full beat slower. How could he still catch up to Ye Yuan?

The speed of merging into heaven and earth was very quick. Ordinary speed could not catch up at all.

Want to knock Ye Yuan out of the state of merging into heaven and earth, it needed to be done within a certain radius too.

They were separated so far away all of a sudden, it was totally beyond Zhao Lingdong’s ability.

However, there was not much time for him to regret it at present. Carry on delaying, and Ye Yuan would run out god knows how far.

Zhao Lingdong gritted his teeth, brought Howlsky along, and tunneled into the transmission array.

Before long, Mo Datong and Mo Santong also arrived.

“Looks like they have already entered the fifth level! Big Brother, what should we do?” Mo Santong said in a solemn voice.

Mo Datong gave a cold snort and said, “Old Second’s enmity, we must avenge! So what if it’s the fifth level? Don’t forget, we have divine artifacts in our hands! Ordinary desolate beasts aren’t our match at all. Forget about the fifth level, even if it’s a mountain of blades or a sea of fire, we have to go too!”.

“Fine, go!”

The two people did not have much hesitation and immediately followed inside too.

...

After entering the fifth level, Ye Yuan casually took out a small bottle.

Inside the small bottle was a blue butterfly.

Casually opening the small bottle, the blue butterfly directly flew out and vanished with a flash, inconceivably swift.

Seeing the blue butterfly disappear, a hint of a smile appeared on Ye Yuan’s face.

This blue butterfly was called Blueflash Butterfly. It liked to rest on the Flamesoul Vast Universe Lotus the most.

This blue butterfly was already groomed for a long time by Ye Yuan with special means. If there were Flamesoul Vast Universe Lotuses nearby, it would bring Ye Yuan to find it.

The Flamesoul Vast Universe Lotus was a core medicine of the Dao Defying Pill. Apart from the Immemorial Medicine Garden, the places that Ye Yuan knew, only this Bloodrain Wilderness had it.

Ye Yuan had long guessed that the Flamesoul Vast Universe Lotus was at this fifth level. Looking at it now, it was indeed so!

Walking not far away, there was another series of undulations from the transmission array in the distance. Zhao Lingdong’s figure finally appeared at the fifth level.

But when Ye Yuan saw this scene, he sneered coldly to no end.

“Indeed still came down. Later, this young master will prepare a feast for you all. You guys savor it well!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh, his figure immediately disappearing, merging into heaven and earth.
