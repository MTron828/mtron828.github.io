Chapter 2635: Hopeless Situation!

“On the surface, our Five Light Heavenly Region has the upper hand. But you have got to know that up until now, the Pill Alliance hasn’t made a move!”

Ye Yuan’s words made Feng Xuanyi’s heart sink to the bottom.

The Pill Alliance, this faction, was seriously too mysterious.

But, without a doubt, it was very powerful!

It was just that currently, no one knew what on earth the Pill Alliance was trying to do.

This was what made Ye Yuan most uneasy.

But Ye Yuan had a feeling that the Pill Alliance probably came with unkind intentions!

“How strong do you think the Pill Alliance is?” Feng Xuanyi said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan’s expression was solemn as he said, “I originally thought that the appearance of this batch of true grade heavenly pills can force the Pill Alliance onto the stage! But I miscalculated! Therefore, the moment they make a move, it will probably shake the entire Rainclear Continent!”

Feng Xuanyi’s brows furrowed a little tighter.

Only until now did he know Ye Yuan’s thoughts.

It turned out that taking out this batch of true grade heavenly pills was in order to force the Pill Alliance out.

But until now, the Pill Alliance did not appear, which meant that they did not care at all!

Boom!

All of a sudden, the earth quaked and mountains shook. The entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect started swaying.

Feng Xuanyi and Ye Yuan’s expressions changed greatly.

The two exchanged a glance and two words popped out of their mouths at virtually the same time, “The Pill Alliance!”

When the two arrived before the mountain, they were immediately stunned by the scene before their eyes!

In front of the sect protecting grand array, more than 100 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were currently accumulating their strength and preparing for the next attack.

And the sect protecting grand array in front of them was already teetering on its last legs!

Clearly, the power of the attack previously already brought the sect protecting grand array to the brink of collapse.

The entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was full of alarmed and panicky voices.

There was a large group of powerhouses in front of the mountain pass gates, surrounding the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect until not even water could seep through.

“Is this the power of the Pill Alliance? More than 180 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, what a big move!” Feng Xuanyi’s gaze was solemn to the extreme.

Sweeping a glance over, there were more than 180 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses in an array.

For a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, each one was extremely hard to come across.

In the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, there were also merely 40 over of them!

The vast majority of them were even just lower and middle Jade Sovereign heaven.

But the moment the Pill Alliance made a move, it was 180 people. The number was more than four times compared to the powerhouses from the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect!

Which was also to say that one Pill Alliance’s Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, was virtually equivalent to the sum of the five great heavenly sects!

This contrast of power was simply too terrifying!

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s powerhouses all sucked in a breath of cold air.

This mysterious to the extreme faction, finally revealed its fangs to the world today!

“Yunqing, immediately ask the four sects for help! Activate the reverse-transmission array and have them hurry over as soon as possible!” Feng Xuanyi said to the Luo Yunqing who rushed over.

But Luo Yunqing did not move. His expression being solemn as he said, “Sect Master, it’s useless! The transmission array between us and the four sects has already been destroyed! Right now, we’re fighting alone!”

Feng Xuanyi turned pale with fright and said, “What?! The nodal points of the transmission array are extremely secretive. Only our five great heavenly sects’ upper echelons know about it. How did they destroy it?”

The five great heavenly sects were very far apart and needed to pass through many spatial nodes to transit.

These spatial nodes were very hidden and belonged to the sect’s secrets.

Such a secretive thing was actually discovered by the Pill Alliance!

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Looks like the Pill Alliance has been planning for a long time!”

Feng Xuanyi said furiously, “Damn it! They manipulated the four great heavenly regions to provoke us. It turns out that it’s in order to lure the tiger away from the mountain!”

These few years, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect pretty much had close to half of its powerhouses on the frontier battlefield.

Right now, the powerhouses that were still in the sect were only half of their full strength.

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was in imminent crisis!

Boom!

Right at this time, brilliant divine essence fluctuations lit up in the sky.

Over 140 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses attacked together. It was only to hear a loud noise. The sect protecting grand array directly fell apart.

Another earthquake!

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciples were in a constant state of anxiety.

Once the grand array was broken, more than 140 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses slowly flew towards the top of the mountain.

That intense sense of oppression made people virtually unable to breathe.

A white-robed middle-aged man walked out slowly. A middle-aged man with a frosty expression even followed beside him.

Feng Xuanyi recognized the middle-aged man with a cold expression with a glance. The person was precisely Xiao Feibai who battled with the five great sect masters back then in Cloudarch Great Nation!

The white-robed middle-aged man was naturally Huangfu Cloudthink.

Huangfu Cloudthink looked toward Feng Xuanyi and said with a slight smile, “Sect Master Feng, let me introduce myself. This humble self is the Pill Alliance’s deputy alliance chief, Huangfu Cloudthink! This one beside me, you should have fought with him before. He’s my Pill Alliance’s Heavenly Martial Hall’s hall master, Xiao Feibai!”

Feng Xuanyi’s expression was very ugly and he said in a solemn voice, “What’s with all the crap! If you want to fight, then fight! Our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect inherited Lord Zhuo’s ambitions and absolutely won’t take a step back!”

Seeing this scene, Feng Xuanyi naturally would not be stupid enough to think that Huangfu Cloudthink came to chat with him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This battle was already unavoidable.

Furthermore, Feng Xuanyi had an idea in his heart, it was likely impossible for the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect to escape its doom today!

The Pill Alliance schemed for a long time, causing such a big commotion.

Yet, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect still did not have the slightest inkling!

This battle was not lost in vain!

But Huangfu Cloudthink smiled and said, “Sect Master Feng’s personality is very strong! However, this alliance chief isn’t very interested in Sect Master Feng. I wonder if Sect Master Feng can hand Ye Yuan over to me?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s gazes looked toward Ye Yuan.

The Pill Alliance came up with such a grand line-up, it was actually for Ye Yuan?

Many people let out a sigh of relief when they heard this.

If it was just for Ye Yuan, then there was still room to salvage the situation.

Feeling everyone’s gazes, Ye Yuan’s expression was calm.

Feng Xuanyi looked toward Ye Yuan rather surprisedly. But very soon, he gave a cold snort and said, “Don’t play this with this sect master! Do you take this sect master to be a three-year-old kid? You Pill Alliance brought out such a grand line-up, I don’t believe that it’s just for a Ye Yuan!”

Huangfu Cloudthink still had not spoken and Shi Feiyu could not hold back first.

“Sect Master! The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect ended up at this point today, it’s all the trouble caused by Ye Yuan! Already reaching this point, you’re still protecting him?” Shi Feiyu rebuked angrily.

The head elder also said, “That’s right! If not for Ye Yuan provoking the Pill Alliance time and again, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect also wouldn’t have today! Ye Yuan should take responsibility for today’s matter!”

With these two people taking the lead, many of Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s elders all spoke up to reproach, expressing dissatisfaction towards Ye Yuan.

Seeing Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s internal strife, Huangfu Cloudthink just smiled slightly and did not speak, and also did not interject.

“All shut up for me!”

Suddenly, Feng Xuanyi roared angrily and interrupted everyone’s words. He said in a solemn voice, “You fools, such an obvious plan to sow discord and you can’t even discern it? That’s right. They indeed came here for Ye Yuan, but it definitely won’t be just for Ye Yuan! Already at this point, are you all still naive enough to think that by handing Ye Yuan over, the Pill Alliance will let our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect off?”

Feng Xuanyi was extremely disappointed in Shi Feiyu and Head Elder.

Very clearly, the Pill Alliance had planned for a long time with regards to the Five Light Heavenly Region!

Ye Yuan merely just happened to be there at the right time!
