Chapter 1541 Are You a Monster?

Ye Yuan gained enlightenment on Great Dao with alchemy and developed the Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

He naturally walked further along the alchemy path too.

After the Ten Directions Heaven Seizing Art, Ye Yuan created the Chaos Heavenly Star Art with the Chaos Heavenspan Canon as the foundation.

Especially after the Great Dao Heavenly Melody the last time, this alchemy skill became even more unfathomable.

As soon as it was used, it would trigger Great Dao.

Suddenly, the aura of Great Dao poured into the medicinal cauldron frenziedly. Everyone returned to serenity!

That misty look of Ning Siyu’s finally recovered clarity.

“Just now ... what happened? What a mysterious feeling! I feel like ... I seem to have understood something!” Ning Siyu said in shock.

“What a mysterious feeling!”

“I clearly don’t know how to refine pills, but why do I feel like I seem to know how to refine pills?”

“Just now ... what in the world happened? What a magical alchemy technique!”

...

Everyone seemed to have experienced a fleeting dream. Now, they had a feeling as if waking up from a dream.

Ye Yuan pointed at the medicinal pill in the jade box and said to Ning Siyu, “Your Gale Celestial Stone Pill, pay up!”

The moment Ning Siyu looked at it, her eyes went wide.

“This ... How is this possible? Peak heaven-grade! Just a bit more, just a little bit more! You ... Are you still human?”

Ning Siyu’s voice, the pitch gradually became higher and higher. She felt that she must have seen a fake medicinal pill.

This guy actually refined a peak heaven-grade Gale Celestial Stone Pill!

Furthermore, it was even his first time refining!

Ning Siyu felt that her head could not quite wrap itself around it. Everything in front of her was too surreal.

She watched Ye Yuan refine pills with her own eyes. This absolutely could not be falsified!

Also, that mysterious feeling just now, what was with that? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ning Siyu looked at Ye Yuan, feeling that this youth was so mysterious.

“Mn. This is the first time I’m refining it. I’m still a little unfamiliar with the pill. You can leave the other medicinal embryo here. Tomorrow, I’ll help you refine once more. It should be able to reach divine-grade,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ning Siyu used a gaze like she had seen a ghost to look at Ye Yuan. She seriously could not find the words to describe the astonishment in her heart currently anymore.

When did refining divine-grade medicinal pills become so casual?

At this moment, the shopkeeper’s face revealed a red glow, looking excited.

He really did not think that this young lad who was new was actually an expert who kept his own counsel!

No, wait, it was a super duper expert!

What kind of expert could refine divine-grade medicinal pills like cabbages?

Even Four-star Alchemy Gods could not do it too, right?

At this time, he felt that this ‘Will Grant All Requests’ signboard was genuine fame following real achievement, living up to its reputation,

All along, the Miracle Hand Parlor was half-dead.

But the shopkeeper was clear that the Miracle Hand Parlor would soon become the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s hottest medicinal shop!

“Everybody saw it, right? Our Master Ye has true capabilities! Everyone, remember. All requests will be granted! In the future, if everyone has any needs, feel free to come to the Miracle Hand Parlor! It’s getting late now, everyone can all disperse then!” said the shopkeeper as he smiled from ear to ear.

Everyone experienced boundless shock and left the Miracle Hand Parlor.

Ning Siyu opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but she did not know where to begin.

Ye Yuan looked at Ning Siyu and said suspiciously, “What? It can’t be that you don’t have divine essence stones, right?”

Ning Siyu’s expression changed and she suddenly put on a smile and said with a fawning look: “This ... Came out in a hurry ... Why not ... How about this? I see that your little medicine shop is lacking manpower too. I’ll be a little medicine boy for you?”

Ye Yuan looked at Ning Siyu meaningfully and said, “You want to learn alchemy from me?”

Ning Siyu instantly turned into a fangirl. Pulling Ye Yuan’s hand and swinging, she said, “Your pill refinement is really too incredible! I idolize you to death! I discovered that ... I’ve fallen in love with alchemy!”

Ye Yuan shook her hand off and said with a disgusted look, “What does you falling in love with alchemy have got to do with me? Give me the money!”

Not that Ye Yuan was greedy for money, but that his current expenditures were too great.

The cost of rank three spirit medicines was far from what rank one and two spirit medicines could compare to.

The spirit medicines of a medicinal pill like the Gale Celestial Stone Pill, the cost price would likely cost several million divine essence stones.

Along the way, in order to research rank three spirit medicines, he already spent no less than over a billion divine essence stones.

Adding in the flight expenditure along the way, he was only left with two to three billion divine essence stones now.

It looked like a very large sum. Actually, it was already consuming without producing.

Hence, the money that should be charged, he naturally must charge Ning Siyu.

Eight million to buy a medicinal pill sounded very scary. Actually, it was not considered expensive for divine-grade medicinal pills.

Because one could not buy it at all!

The Gale Celestial Stone Pill’s divine-grade medicinal pill, even Four-star Alchemy Gods could not refine it.

Ning Siyu said with a resentful look, “Stinky fellow who’s oblivious to flirting! Want money, don’t have it. Want my life, there’s one. Up to you!”

As she said this, Ning Siyu directly made a grabbing move toward the medicinal pill.

Unexpectedly, Ye Yuan was even faster than her, directly putting away the medicinal pill and medicinal embryo.

“If no money, I’ll keep these two medicinal pills. Two Gale Celestial Stone Pills, the price shouldn’t be lower than eight million,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ning Siyu’s expression changed and she said, “You! No way! This medicinal pill, you can’t take it away!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, even if you give me more, I’ll return them to you. I said eight million, it means eight million. I won’t take a single cent more from you.”

Ning Siyu said exasperatedly, “No way! The Gale Celestial Stone Pill’s spirit medicines, I’ve collected for a long time. That’s for my big brother to use, you can’t sell it!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “That’s none of my business.”

Ning Siyu gritted her teeth and said, “It’s you who forced me! Look out for my sword!”

Done talking, Ning Siyu stabbed toward Ye Yuan with a sword.

Clank!

Ye Yuan stood firm, finger lightly flicked, flicking on the flat of the blade, directly shocking the long sword until it slipped out of the hand.

Ning Siyu was shocked until her wrist went numb and she said in surprise, “Are you a monster? Alchemy strength is so formidable, martial arts is actually this strong too?”

Ning Siyu was an Origin Deity. Not saying that she was one of the best among peers, but she was also not what an initial-stage Origin Deity could casually defeat.

But Ye Yuan actually just lightly flicked a bit and flicked her sword flying.

Once this guy really made a move, how terrifying would that be?

Regardless of whether it was alchemy or martial arts, Ning Siyu had always been very confident in her talent.

She was not very hardworking in cultivation, but her strength was much stronger than her peers.

All the way until today, she ran into Ye Yuan!

This hateful guy shattered her confidence into pieces.

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered with her and said coolly, “Go on!”

Ning Siyu gritted her teeth and stomped her feet angrily and said, “Fine, I’ll pay up! Here, there’s four million in here, all for you! Now, I’m penniless and have nowhere to go anymore. You have to take me in!”

“Ouch! Let me go! Quickly let me go! You ... What are you going to do?”

Ye Yuan directly picked Ning Siyu up and walked outside the door.

Bang!

Ye Yuan did not have the slightest intention of being compassionate toward girls, directly throwing Ning Siyu out.
