Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s words made the hearts of Zi Yu and the rest tremble.

Ye Yuan’s technique was clearly just like a big jumble of mess, so why did it become very brilliant?

“This move of his seems like a big mess, but actually, there is a well-thought-out plan. He made the medicinal cauldron operate on its own with an extremely brilliant fire controlling art. As long as these spirit medicines enter the medicinal cauldron, they would automatically be extracted until the divine fire and medicinal cauldron’s control, tempered, and formed into medicinal embryo! Of course, wanting to do it to this step, there’s an exceedingly high requirement of familiarity with the medicinal properties of spirit medicines, fire controlling technique, and the medicinal cauldron. This requirement is close to rigorous, ordinary people can’t do it at all.”

Empyrean Flutterfeather spoke with confidence and composure, but everyone was alarmed when they heard it.

“A-Automatically operating to extract the medicinal embryo? How is this possible?” Chen Yu said in shock and horror.

He was a Dao Realm powerhouse himself and naturally knew how difficult this was.

Empyrean Realm Flutterfeather said coolly, “Nothing is impossible. You can’t because your skill isn’t up to par. Ye Yuan’s fire controlling art has already attained sublimity, and even this Empyrean dare not say that I can win against him.”

“Hiss!”

The sound of cold air being sucked in echoed in the hall.

How terrifying Empyrean Flutterfeather’s fire controlling art was, they were completely unable to imagine.

But he said that Ye Yuan’s fire controlling art was not the least bit inferior to him.

How terrifying was this?!

One had to know, Empyrean Flutterfeather was an old monster who had already lived for several million years. Having such a profound fire controlling technique was not unusual.

But Ye Yuan?

He was only roughly a thousand years old!

Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people no longer dared to speak, their faces being very ugly by the side.

The two of them were even much older than Ye Yuan. But in terms of fire controlling technique, they were not even fit to carry Ye Yuan’s shoes.

Even though Master doted on them a lot, he had never given them such a high evaluation before.

“Huhu, I’ve displayed my ability in front of Senior Flutterfeather,” Ye Yuan said.

Flutterfeather said coolly, “You and I know it perfectly well, so why is there a need to say such things? Next, this Empyrean won’t hold back anymore. This Empyrean’s alchemy technique is my self-created Soul Heavenly Revelation Art. You have to be careful.”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Chaos Heavenly Star Art, please give pointers!”

A strange look fleeted across Empyrean Flutterfeather’s eyes, thinking to himself in alarm, Chaos Heavenly Star Art, was it intentional or unintentional? The word ‘chaos’ was not what anyone dared to use!

But very soon, Empyrean Flutterfeather reined in his thoughts, his entire person becoming tranquil.

An aura of Dao that could not be described with words started filling the air in the hall.

A thread of flame that was as fine as silk slowly flowed into the Xuanlong Cauldron like a stream.

There were the grace and sereneness of the silent night.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, being fully aware that he ran into an expert.

Refining a rank five divine pill, he had yet to encounter such great pressure before.

Ye Yuan did not dare to be negligent, the Chaos Heavenly Star Art revolved. A similarly incomparably profound aura spread out from Ye Yuan’s body.

Two auras collided together fiercely.

Ye Yuan’s mind was shocked and nearly went limp.

What a powerful impact force!

Ye Yuan felt that it was like the weight of Mount Tai bearing down on him, being powerful and unstoppable.

The alchemy battles previously, no matter how powerful the opponents were, how fierce the impact was, it was unable to shake him in the slightest. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But this time, Ye Yuan actually felt like he was unable to confront the opponent.

This kind of aura was not the pressure of an Empyrean, but the aura formed from refining medicinal pills.

Because of the limitation of rank five divine pills, no matter how great your strength was, you could only urge rank five divine pills to the limits and would not exceed the scope of rank five.

It was just that the strength of the alchemist, the aura that was released was totally different.

Powerful ones could have their qi surge to the clouds, triggering the power of heaven and earth.

Weak ones could only barely manage to hold out, so on and so forth.

Currently, after the medicinal pill aura of Empyrean Flutterfeather and Ye Yuan two people clashed vigorously, they turned into two enormous dragons, spiraling up, rushing straight for the clouds.

That imposing momentum could be said to startle the heavens and shake the earth.

At this time, Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people no longer dared to speak up to ridicule Ye Yuan.

Although Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill aura was inferior to Empyrean Flutterfeather’s, the might of its imposing momentum made people tongue-tied.

This commotion was absolutely not what the likes of their strength could bring out.

They finally understand why Master wanted to battle in alchemy with a puny little Celestial Deity Realm with the body of an Empyrean Realm.

Ye Yuan indeed had this qualification.

On the other side, the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s elders all revealed shocked expressions.

Especially the Chen Yu three people who had exchanged blows with Ye Yuan before. They were even more inexplicably shocked in their hearts.

“Turns out that this is Ye Yuan’s full strength! When he was battling in alchemy with us, he didn’t use his full strength at all!” Chen Yu said with a pale complexion.

Chen Chang also nodded slowly and said, “Grand completion Dao Realm! This is the strength of grand completion Dao Realm! The likes of us can’t imagine it at all!”

Xiao Zhen sighed emotionally and said, “No wonder he dared to utter wild ravings, wanting to challenge Lord Flutterfeather! Us mortal men can’t arouse his interest at all! This boy’s talent is truly terrifying, being already at the grand completion Dao Realm at a young age! After hundreds of millions of years past, the Heavenspan World might produce another Medicine Ancestor.”

When everyone heard that, they were shocked.

In these countless tens of thousands of years, only one Medicine Ancestor emerged.

Although the Demon Race produced a Sacred Ancestor High Priest, the Sacred Ancestor High Priest was still quite a bit worse compared to the Medicine Ancestor.

But Ye Yuan’s age determined his future potential.

Who could say that he could not reach the Medicine Ancestor’s boundary in the future?

While they were talking, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s and Ye Yuan’s auras grew stronger and stronger. The pill refinement also reached a white-hot degree.

“Roar!”

An illusory purple dragon rushed to the sky, directly breaching the great hall’s constraints, heading for the horizon.

Ye Yuan’s side was also not resigned to playing second fiddle.

“Roar!”

A ferocious dragon similarly rose to the sky, catching up to the purple dragon very quickly.

Two illusory enormous dragons had a great battle at the horizon, the commotion grew stronger and stronger.

The present Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, the color of the sky completely dimmed down.

The clear skies that originally stretched thousands of miles actually had fine rain clouds rain down at present.

All the martial artists in the city were drawn by the two enormous dragons high up in the sky.

“This phenomenon came from Clouddream Mountain, heard that that newly appointed Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elder is challenging Empyrean Flutterfeather. Could it be that they are battling in alchemy?”

“Heard that Empyrean Flutterfeather’s divine fire is Purple Wing True Dragon Fire. That purple enormous dragon is likely transformed by Empyrean Flutterfeather, right? Then the other enormous dragon is Ye Yuan?”

“Really too crazy! Elder Ye Yuan is just a Five-star Alchemy God, he can actually fight with Empyrean Flutterfeather, this Seven-star Alchemy God, until they are evenly-matched?”

...

The commotion caused by Ye Yuan and Empyrean Flutterfeather battling in alchemy was too big, it was hard for the entire city of martial artists to not be concerned even if they did not want to.

It was just that at this very moment, what they were shocked by was not how strong Empyrean Flutterfeather’s strength was, but that a Five-star Alchemy God could actually fight with a Seven-star Alchemy God until they were locked in a struggle!

A Five-star Alchemy God could actually cause such a phenomenon, Ye Yuan’s strength already far surpassed the people’s imaginations.

Bang!

Right at this time, the two enormous dragons in the sky gave off a fierce collision.

The spiritual energy of heaven stirred up by the two enormous dragons instantly set off an enormous undulation.

In a twinkle, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled as if the end of the world had come.

Crack, crack, crack ...

Bolts of lightning wrapped in horrifying pressure rushed into Clouddream Mountain, landing inside the hall!
