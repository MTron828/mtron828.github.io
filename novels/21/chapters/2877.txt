Chapter 2883 Not Even Letting You Guys Drink Soup!

A blood envoy howled, “Stop! We must stop it! The blood essence source in this blood pool is our accumulations of nearly a thousand years! Can’t let this brat alone deplete it!”

The consumption rate of the blood essence source made his flesh hurt.

Even this City Lord in front of them, the muscles on his face were twitching non-stop too.

Although Saint Sovereign level blood essence source was relatively easy to obtain, this kind of consumption, he could not quite support it too.

If this was finished absorbing, Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City would probably enter a hundred years of vacuum period.

“Stop my *ss! City Lord Your Excellency, Bloodazure is a bloodline genius that’s hard to come across in a million years! His bloodline power far surpasses those in the same rank. He can definitely step into Hegemon Realm in the future! Compared to a Hegemon Realm, what does a mere blood pool count for?” Owlfly naturally supported Ye Yuan fervently.

“Huhu, is Hegemon Realm so easy to break through? Even at our realms, it’s far away and not in the foreseeable future, let alone talk about a Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

“Bloodazure can kill 100 hundred sons candidates by himself at upper Saint Sovereign Heaven! His talent is absolutely one-of-a-kind in our blood race! Bloodcurse, are you jealous of the talented?” Owlfly questioned.

.....

At this time, a group of Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses was arguing non-stop over a Ye Yuan.

One side felt that Ye Yuan was extremely talented and that they should support him in absorbing the blood essence source.

But the other side felt that investing the accumulations of a thousand years on a Saint Sovereign Heaven with a vague and uncertain future was not worth it.

City Lord Ye Wugui was a genuine Hegemon Realm!

Even he was also hesitant at this time.

As a Hegemon Realm, no one was clearer than him about the difficulty of reaching the Hegemon Realm.

But it was also precisely because of this that if they could groom a Hegemon Realm, no matter how much resources were thrown in, it was not overboard!

Compared to a Hegemon Realm, what did a mere blood pool count as? One had to know, for these few thousand years, even with the resources of two great continents, the blood race only gave birth to a single digit number of Hegemon Realms too!

The talent that Ye Yuan exhibited had indeed moved him greatly.

A blood envoy said anxiously, “City Lord Your Excellency, if we still don’t make a decision, that brat will be draining the blood pool dry!”

A hint of decisiveness flashed across in Ye Wugui’s eyes, and he said in a solemn voice, “Let him absorb! This city lord wants to see how much he can absorb! If he can really drain the blood pool, then so what if let him drain it dry?”

Owlfly’s gaze flashed, his face revealing a look of wild ecstasy.

This time, wouldn’t Your Father completely take advantage of you idiots? Bloodazure, you have to win credit for this seat!

Ye Yuan naturally lived up to expectations. He was currently feeling refreshed to the extreme.

Under the Dao tribulation, the growth of the Dao sword was too explosive. That was a pain like being lacerated.

But the nurturing of this blood essence source was very gentle. The Dao sword grew bit by bit, becoming more powerful.

His cultivation realm broke through to upper Saint Sovereign Heaven smoothly and actually did not trigger a Dao tribulation!

And his bloodline power similarly made rather big improvements too. It was just a shame that after his bloodline power evolved to a certain extent, it basically did not grow anymore.

“This blood pool is half-absorbed, and the upper echelons in the city haven’t reacted yet. It looks like they have acknowledged me, this ‘genius.’ However, this blood pool already doesn’t have much effect on me. I heard that there’s an even better Saint Sovereign level blood pool in the Blood God Temple. Uh ... Should I also suck that blood pool dry?” Ye Yuan could not refrain from thinking.

Blood God Temple was the same as the Extreme Medicine Sect’s Extreme Light Pavilion. It was where the legacy of the blood race lay.

The blood pool there was definitely a grade stronger than this one!

Such a good thing, Ye Yuan was naturally moved by it.

Although the effect was already not great, Ye Yuan was still absorbing the blood essence source crazily.

He did not have to leave behind such a good thing for the blood race.

Even if some was wasted on me, it’s better than you guys using it.

On the tenth day, this blood pool no longer had a drop of blood essence source anymore.

What made everyone vomit blood was that the traces of blood essence source stained on the pool wall, Ye Yuan even sucked it clean like a licking dog! Freaking hell, did you want face or not?

You ate the meat and did not even let us drink soup?

“F-F*ck me! Does this guy still want people to live or not?”

“A few thousand years of accumulation was sucked up by him in a few days! Yet, this guy still has an insatiable look! Your Father really wants to tear him to shreds alive!”

“The most aggravating thing is that we can’t beat him! This guy is an out-and-out god of killing!”

......

The geniuses outside had completely broken down.

Blood pool this sort of good thing, who did not hanker after it!

Ye Yuan was good, not even giving them a drop!

Coming out of the blood pool and looking at the surrounding expressions like their mothers had died, Ye Yuan felt refreshed in his heart.

Want to increase strength?

Sure, go and cultivate bitterly!

This kind of good stuff that saves effort, I’ll kindly accept it!

“All surrounding here for what? If you’re unhappy about anything, you’re welcome to find me to take revenge in the hundred sons battle. I won’t refuse any arrivals!” Ye Yuan said with a radiant smile.

I take revenge your *ss!

You killed people without batting any eyelid!

If my head freaking missing screws? To find you to take revenge?

But not being able to take revenge was really very unpleasant!

Fury rose straight to the clouds all around him.

Everyone dared to get angry but did not dare to speak.

This guy could beat 99 by himself when he was at upper Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Now, who else was his mate in Saint Sovereign Heaven?

Even those few who did not make a move probably did not dare to make a move against him anymore as well, right?

“Hahaha ... Little Bloodazure, I, Big Bloodazure, have broken through to half-step Emperor Realm! How is it? Impressive, right? The True Sovereign Hundred Sons battle this time, I’ll definitely take first place!”

Ye Yuan heard Yang Qing’s voice before he went out.

Clearly, he had also reaped considerable benefits in these ten days.

During the past ten days, he challenged ten blood race powerhouses in a row. He firmly occupied the number one blood pool. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In this blood pool, he gained a sudden epiphany too, and he actually reached half-step Emperor Realm!

This step was not easy to take.

However, this blood pool was indeed formidable!

But, as soon as he came in, Yang Qing saw the empty blood pool. His entire person could not help being stupefied, and he said, “Eh? Is there no blood pool at your Saint Sovereign Heaven side?”

Ye Yuan said with an innocent face, “There was. It got sucked dry by me.” “S-Sucked dry?” Yang Qing’s eyeballs almost popped out.

Was this fellow still human?

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The quality of this blood pool is a little poor, I think ... the Blood God Temple’s blood pool should be better.”

Bang!

A series of tumbling sounds was heard from all around.

Freaking hell, did you still want people to live or not?

Yang Qing gave Ye Yuan a big thumbs up again and sighed with admiration as he said, “You ... You’re amazing!” “Hahaha, the two of you, really nice! Very nice!” Right at this time, a loud laughter sounded out.

Owlfly’s figure directly landed.

The current Owlfly was in high and vigorous spirits, feeling indescribably satisfied.

With the big and little Bloodazures that he brought, he really regained all the face that he lost in these thousand years!

Delightful!

Delightful!

Ye Yuan gave him a glance lightly and said with a smile, “Lead the way then!” Owlfly was taken aback and immediately said with a big laugh, “Okay, follow me!”
