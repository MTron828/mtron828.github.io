Chapter 2102: That Sentence Before

“This demonic attraction art has probably already reached the realm of divine connection, right?”

“Ashamed, ashamed! This Empyrean cultivated the demonic attraction art for no less than a million years, and I’m still actually unable to reach the realm of divine connection!”

“To be able to be called Second Sage, this boy is indeed incredible!”

... ...

The group of Empyreans broke out with marvels. Clearly, they had their breaths taken away by Ye Yuan’s demonic attraction art.

Xin Luo’s gaze carried some shock and carried some puzzlement.

The strength of demonic attraction art determined the quality of the medicinal pill to a very large extent.

Hence, the demon race viewed the demonic attraction art with utmost importance when refining pills.

However, being able to cultivate the demonic attraction art to Ye Yuan’s level, Xin Luo had never seen before!

The demonic attraction art was divided into four levels, entry, minor accomplishment, major accomplishment, and grand completion.

But there were still three levels above these four levels, they were respectively profound intent, divine connection, as well as Dao descend[1].

The demonic attraction art was the foundational skill of demon divine pills. Its importance went without saying.

The first four levels, as long as one practiced diligently, they would be able to reach it.

But the latter three levels already reached the level of Dao and was not what bitter cultivation could attain. It depended on one’s comprehension ability.

The priests present were all major powers of the demon race, being Seven-star priests. The majority of these people could cultivate to the profound intent realm.

It was just that there was not one that reached the divine connection realm!

But now, a human cultivated the demonic attraction art to the divine connection realm! How could they not be ashamed?

Actually, to Ye Yuan, the demonic attraction art was not complicated. Actually, it was just control over demonic divine essence.

And with regards to precise control of divine essence, how many people in this world could compare to him?

Coupled with his profound understanding of Alchemy Dao, reaching the divine connection realm was not surprising.

It was just that this scene to the group of Empyreans was sufficiently shocking.

Gongyang Lie furrowed his brows and said in a solemn voice, “What? His demonic attraction art is very impressive?”

Xin Luo smiled bitterly and said, “More than impressive! Even if ordinary Eight-star priests were here, they also won’t dare to say that their demonic attraction art is stronger than his! As for me ... I’m ashamed of my inferiority!”

A hint of surprise flashed across Gongyang Lie’s eyes. He was a layman in refining pills. He just ran errands for High Priest Redplume.

It was High Priest Redplume who forcefully pushed him to Heavenly Emperor Realm with the power of medicinal pills.

Xin Luo’s strength, he roughly knew about it. Xin Luo was an apex existence among those in the Empyrean Realm.

Now, even he actually said that he was ashamed of his inferiority. So it could be seen how strong Ye Yuan’s demonic attraction art was!

“Then this battle ... Woodgem will lose?” Gongyang Lie said rather hesitantly.

Now, he was already not quite confident.

Xin Luo shook his head and said, “The process of refining demon divine pills is extremely complex. Demonic attraction art is just one aspect. Lord Gongyang, rest assured. Woodgem’s realm and foundation are absolutely not what a thousand years old junior can compare to. This battle still doesn’t have any suspense!”

Only after hearing this did Gongyang Lie set his mind at ease.

However, things did not develop in the direction that they imagined.

The two people did not carry out the competition of Alchemy Dao aura in their alchemy battle. However, seeing the actual scene of refining pills, Ye Yuan’s pill refinement was like an ensemble of nature itself, as if developing a world.

In comparison, although Woodgem’s pill refinement was impressive, it was lacking that hint of flavor.

Those present were all experts among experts. So they could tell the quality at a glance.

Just this trace of flavor, it would likely be hard for Woodgem to go past it in this lifetime.

Xin Luo’s expression became more and more serious. The puzzled look on his face was becoming thicker and thicker.

He was unable to imagine, that such a young priest, why would he not produce any mistake when refining pills?

No weakness to exploit!

This was the impression that Ye Yuan’s pill refinement gave Xin Luo!

“Condense! Haha, refining the Nine Palace Demon Divine Pill this time, this Empyrean’s state is an unprecedented good! Whatever Second Sage, a mere Six-star Alchemy God, how does he know what is pill refinement!”

The moment Woodgem condensed the pill, because his state was too good, he could not resist laughing out loud.

It was just that when he came back to his senses, he discovered that something was not quite right.

There was actually no one answering!

Looking again, everyone was using strange eyes to look at him.

“W-What’s wrong with everyone? Why are you using this kind of eyes to look at me?” Woodgem said with a baffled look.

Xin Luo threw a small bottle to him and said with a sigh, “You take a look for yourself.”

Woodgem probed with his divine sense and immediately turned stiff on the spot.

Woodgem was completely defeated!

Following that, several more people challenged Ye Yuan, all taking out the medicinal pill that they were more adept in.

But in front of Ye Yuan, they were still utterly defeated.

Gongyang Lie was long already dumbstruck with amazement.

A Six-star priest swept across the Westspirit Region’s Seven-star major powers?

This kind of thing was simply like a fantasy tale.

Finally, Westspirit Region’s number one Alchemy Dao person, Xin Luo, also stepped forward to challenge Ye Yuan, and was still completely defeated!

Ye Yuan looked at Xin Luo and shook his head and said, “A vast Westspirit Region actually can’t find a single Ancestor Realm. No wonder the demon race’s Alchemy Dao has always been suppressed by the human race!”

This place gathered the entire Westspirit Region’s strongest batch of Seven-star priests. However, not one person reached Ancestor Realm.

Ye Yuan originally even thought that Xin Luo could reach Ancestor Realm and give him some threat.

It was just that sadly, Xin Luo only reached half-step Ancestor Realm too. There was still a step away from Ancestor Realm.

When everyone heard Ye Yuan’s words, they could not help having ashamed looks on their faces.

However, there was more shock in their hearts still!

Ancestor Realm powerhouse!

Second Sage was actually an Ancestor Realm powerhouse!

A thousand over years old Ancestor Realm powerhouse, this was simply a mythical existence!

Xin Luo heaved a sigh and bowed in salute as he said, “Second Sage is mighty, Xin Luo is wholeheartedly convinced!”

Right at this time, a cold snort transmitted over. A figure stepped into the hall.

“Humph! What dogfart Second Sage? Pretending to be mysterious! You all are really a bunch of trash! The Westspirit Region’s face is utterly lost by you guys!”

Following the voice and looking over, the faces of the group of Empyreans turned fearful.

“We pay respects to Priest Crimsonsky!”

Seeing the arrival, the group of Empyreans bowed in unison.

A young man dressed in cotton clothing slowly came up to the high platform. He bowed slightly toward Gongyang Lie, and he said, “I pay respects to Uncle Gongyang.”

When Gongyang Lie saw the arrival, his eyes could not help lighting up. He said with great joy, “Huhu, good! Good! Crimsonsky is here! This emperor can rest assured!”

Crimsonsky sized Ye Yuan up and said with a contemptuous look, “Don’t think that entering Ancestor Realm, you’re remarkable. Want to be mentioned in the same breath as Master, you’re still a million years too early!”

Ye Yuan’s face turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “What did you say just now?”

Crimsonsky gave a cold snort and said, “I said that you’re still a million years too early! Are you deaf?”

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said with a cold snort, “The previous sentence!”

Crimsonsky was taken aback and immediately smiled coldly and said, “I said that you’re some dogfart Second Sage, pretending to be mysterious. What? Could it be that I said wrongly?”

Gongyang Lie’s face changed, noticing that things were not good.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan shouted in a great rage, “Where did this impudent person come from, to dare be so insolent! Gongyang Lie, does High Priest Redplume discipline apprentices like this? To look down on even their own grand-master?”

Crimsonsky’s face changed wildly, immediately knowing that he misspoke.

The title Second Sage was personally conferred by Sacred Ancestor High Priest, but he actually said dogfart Second Sage. Wasn’t this slapping Grand-master’s face?

He only saw Ye Yuan sweeping across the Westspirit Region just now and let slip his mouth due to a moment of indignance. He did not expect that Ye Yuan would use his words as evidence. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
