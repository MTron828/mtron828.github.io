Chapter 2289: Boiling Water, Brewing Tea!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Lord Zi Jin, I’m unconvinced! An exalted Ninth Firmament Heavenspan World actually knelt down and apologize to a brat who’s still wet behind his ears! After today, I, Heavenspan World Azurefeather, will probably become the laughingstock of the entire Heavenspan World!”

Settling Ye Yuan down well, Azurefeather went to find Zi Jin and strongly expressed his indignation.

The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this kind of grand occasion, it was hard to come by once in a million years too.

The various regions’ powerhouses present at that time were not in the minority. This matter could not be hidden at all.

The moment Azurefeather dropped to his knees, what dropped was his dignity as a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor. How could he endure it?

Zi Jin gave him a glance and said with a sigh, “I’m sorry. Actually, I really don’t understand it either. But this was instructed by Master. I had no choice but to do it like this!”

Azurefeather’s face changed, and he said in confusion, “The Priest Temple might be sitting high up in a leading position in the eyes of others. But in the eyes of our Cloudheart Realm, what do they count for? I don’t understand. I really don’t understand!”

Zi Jin said, “Master naturally has his own reasons for doing things. So it’s not up to us to question it. If you want to blame, blame that you shouldn’t have offended him. No matter what, for him to be able to be valued highly by Sacred Ancestor High Priest, he naturally has his saving graces!”

Azurefeather’s expression flickered incessantly and he gritted his teeth and said, “I can’t swallow this grievance! If I get the chance, I definitely won’t let him off!”

Zi Jin said coolly, “You don’t have to worry about this. The alchemy geniuses that came to Cloudheart Realm this time are plentiful like oxen hair. Among them, there is no shortage of existences whose talent won’t lose to him. He’s occupying a high position. So he’ll naturally become the common target for public scorn, you just have to wait and watch a good show.”

Azurefeather’s eyes lit up. His mood immediately improved by a lot.

Yeah, so what if Second Sage? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time gathered the top-notch alchemy geniuses of the Heavenspan World.

Some of their backgrounds were not even worse than Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s!

How could their disciples be amateurs?

If Ye Yuan was Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s disciple, then forget it. But he was Second Sage!

Those geniuses were a generation lower than Ye Yuan for no reason. How could they endure this kind of insult?

Zi Jin gave him a glance and said, “Didn’t Ye Yuan cripple Leng Tianqi’s younger brother? He should currently be simmering with rage. You go and find him. Have him incite some genius disciples. There will naturally be someone who goes and find trouble with Ye Yuan. As long as our people don’t provoke him, I believe that Master shouldn’t say anything.”

The moment Azurefeather heard, he was overjoyed and said, “Why didn’t I think of that! It’s still Lord Zi Jin who’s impressive, rousing the dreamer from his sleep with one word! Whatever dog fart second sage, I’ll definitely make him reveal his true colors!”

... ...

At this time, Ye Yuan arrived at Cloudheart Realm’s Feather Mountain. This place was the place where Sacred Ancestor High Priest was staying.

“Second Sage!” Ji Mo said with a respectful bow.

Now, Ji Mo already treated Ye Yuan as his teacher.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Lead the way then.”

“Please!”

Ji Mo turned around and led the way, entering a large hall.

The hall was very empty, without even a guard.

A middle-aged man in plain clothing, his face firm and determined, was seated in the middle of the hall. In front of him was a tea table.

Not far from the middle-aged man, ten unfathomable powerhouses were standing around respectfully, their attitudes very respectful.

At the first sight of this middle-aged man, Ye Yuan felt that he was unfathomable!

That sort of feeling was even more stately than those god statues he saw in the divine race.

The middle-aged man did not speak, he was very busy.

A ball of water was currently flowing in pace with his two hands. Inside the water ball, green leaves appeared indistinctly.

The movements of the middle-aged man carried the thick lingering charm of Great Dao.

That ball of water in his hands gradually evolved to become a world.

Using the method of Great Dao pill refinement to boil water and brew tea, Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s means were truly inconceivable.

Suddenly, the middle-aged man’s palm shook. That ball of water traversed through the void and arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was taken aback at first, but he immediately reacted and reached his hand out to beckon, catching all of the water droplets without leaking the slightest hint.

This was a medicinal pill that had yet to be perfected, it could collapse at any time.

But the function of this medicinal pill was to bring out all of the medicinal effects inside the spiritual tea.

Said that it was brewing tea, but in reality, it was refining a pill.

It was just that those able to brew tea with the method of alchemy, one probably could not find more than a few in this world.

Ye Yuan understood that Sacred Ancestor High Priest was testing him!

It was not easy to be the Second Sage!

Whether or not he had the qualifications to walk into this hall and sit opposite of Sacred Ancestor High Priest, it would have to be put off until after passing this test.

If he did not pass this test, Sacred Ancestor High Priest did not mind chasing him out.

A lingering charm of Great Dao similarly erupted on Ye Yuan’s body.

Ye Yuan held the ball with both hands, a Tai Chi diagram emerged behind Ye Yuan.

When Wing saw this scene, his eyes glimmered slightly, the corners of his mouth revealing a hint of a smile.

At the same time, his disciples became unsettled.

Although Ye Yuan this name had sounded out in their ears no idea how many times before, it was still their first time truly meeting Ye Yuan.

In their hearts, they were naturally somewhat disapproving of Ye Yuan, this rising star.

Even if they knew that Ye Yuan was not an ordinary person.

This was human nature. Before seeing it with your own eyes, no matter how exaggerated the tale, there would always be that trace of doubt in the heart.

But now, they finally understood why their master would choose Ye Yuan.

Looking at the Great Dao power contained in this Tai Chi diagram, they were actually unable to see through completely with their realm.

The current Ye Yuan actually gave them a feeling of profoundness and mystery!

That sort of feeling was like facing their own master, even though Ye Yuan’s Great Dao still appeared somewhat immature, being far from as vigorous and solid as their master’s.

But Ye Yuan had indeed already walked onto the same Great Dao!

Concerning this point, they were well aware in their hearts!

Ye Yuan’s actions possessed natural grace, akin to floating clouds and flowing water. It was natural and smooth, giving people a feeling of gladdening the mind and refreshing the spirit.

Suddenly, his fingertips guided, the spiritual tea flew back with a whoosh.

Wing smiled slightly and reached his hand out to catch it effortlessly. He continued refining.

His refinement was steady and composed as if the Heavenspan Mountain was suppressing in front, being vastly different from Ye Yuan’s style.

Suddenly, he shook again. The spiritual tea flew over once more.

Ye Yuan caught it, refined it again, and returned it again!

These two people, going back and forth, fought with great pleasure.

By the side, the group of disciples was long already stunned from watching.

This guy could actually catch the Tea Dao world that Master refined!

Too terrifying!

Normally, Wing would also occasionally play this game with them.

As disciples, they had followed Wing for tens of millions of years. But it was impossible to keep going.

This refinement seemed simple, but actually, the more toward the back, the more complicated.

Often, when they caught it at the back, it would make the entire world collapse, making the tea water all spill out.

But Ye Yuan fought with Sacred Ancestor High Priest for dozens of rounds and actually did not fall into a disadvantageous situation in the slightest!

No matter how Sacred Ancestor High Priest refined it, Ye Yuan could catch it, and continue refining, then throw it back.

Ignoring other things, just this action already surpassed all of them!

Suddenly, with Wing’s fingertips guiding, the spiritual tea entered the teapot without spilling the slightest bit.

Immediately, fragrance greeted the nose, suffusing the entire hall.

Then, it was the entire Feather Mountain!

At this time, no matter which corner of Feather Mountain, this thick tea fragrance could be smelled!
