Chapter 2786: My Backer is Here!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Above the sea, it was calm and tranquil.

One person and one bull were walking on the surface of the sea, strolling leisurely.

“Master Ye, is it alright for us to just leave like that?”

“Now that the Pill Pavilion is strong, Brother Luo’s strength left people far behind in the dust and already towers above everyone. Before I left, I also gave Li-er they all three life-protecting sword energy each. It won’t be a problem.”

“True, the Pill Pavilion’s status is aloof now. All sects require the Pill Pavilion’s help. At least within several hundred years, there won’t be any changes. However, since the Pill Pavilion rose up, Rainclear Continent’s martial path has become more flourishing. Master Ye made tremendous contributions! Master Ye has put in a lot of hard work for the Pill Pavilion these few years!”

“This is what I promised everyone. I naturally have to do it.”

“Unfortunately, that Pill Alliance’s ancient transmission array is actually a one-way teleportation. There are many dangers in the sea. We don’t know where we can go to either.”

“Huhu, that Zhuo Bufan can go; can’t I, Ye Yuan, go? I have a feeling that Zhuo Bufan must have reached the other side of the side!”

... ...

This one human and one bull were precisely Ye Yuan and Big Yellow.

Over 50 years had already passed since Ye Yuan compelled the Saint Sovereign Heavens to submission. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the past 50 years, most of Ye Yuan’s energy had been placed on the Pill Pavilion.

Presently, the Pill Pavilion was already the Rainclear Continent’s transcendent existence, with countless powerhouses in it.

Having obtained the resources of the Pill Alliance as well as the various sects, Ye Yuan also forcefully increased the strength of Yue Mengli and the others to the realm of Jade Sovereign Heaven.

But when he left this time, Ye Yuan only brought Big Yellow with him.

The sea was full of dangers. There were probably even True Sovereign Heaven Realm seafolks that existed.

Although Ye Yuan’s strength was strong, if he ran into True Sovereign Heavens, it would really be inadequate.

“Big Yellow, we’ve already passed through the seven great sea regions. There are probably quite a few Saint Sovereign Heaven existences in the sea region ahead. Let’s restrain our auras and keep a low profile,” Ye Yuan said.

“Yes!”

The sea was vast. The two people traveled south all the way and did not even see the shadow of a ghost.

However, this place already left the range of the seven great sea regions and reached the depths of the sea.

The so-called seven great sea regions were merely the same as the Rainclear Continent, being a remote sea region; that was all.

This depth of sea was the real crisis lurking in four corners.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Suddenly, there were indistinct figures ahead, spiritual energy surging. Clearly, there were powerhouses fighting.

Furthermore, they were extremely strong, and the number was a lot.

“Damn girl! This time, you can forget about escaping!”

“You big turtle, why do you keep chasing me? Isn’t it just a turtle egg? Is there a need?”

“You little wench! stole Your Mother’s turtle egg and put it in Tian Kui that old fogey’s nest. Now, Your Mother’s son is born and doesn’t acknowledge Your Mother anymore! If I don’t kill you, it will be hard to dispel the hatred in this exalt’s heart!”

“Vile spawn, you connected to the earth’s core fire and burned this exalt’s dragon palace completely! ARGHH! This exalt is definitely going to tear you to shreds today!”

“Hey, how would I know that that place links to the earth’s core?”

... ...

It was chaotic ahead.

There were probably 30 to 40 Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses hunting down one person.

Ye Yuan originally did not want to meddle in others’ business, but after taking a closer look, he frowned and said, “Mn? Why does the person that they are hunting down seem to be Jingfei that lass?”

Without waiting for him to wonder either, the person opposite who was being chased seemed to have seen Ye Yuan already and yelled, “Oh my, Big Brother Ye Yuan, you’re here! If you didn’t come, Jingfei would be killed by people! Quick! Hurry up and come save me!”

Who could the person being hunted down be if not Jingfei?

When Ye Yuan saw this line-up, he could not help being dumbstruck with amazement.

Just how many vile deeds did this lass commit, to actually attract the pursuit of dozens of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses?

It was Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses front and back, the speed extremely fast.

In a blink, Jingfei arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

Swoosh!

Jingfei hid behind Ye Yuan with a flash and made a funny face at the bunch of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses and said, “Humph! My backer is here. See if you all still dare to chase! Keep chasing me, and Big Brother Ye Yuan will beat all of you down!”

Then, she said to Ye Yuan pitifully, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, why did you only come now? Sniff, sniff ... I’ve been waiting for you for ten years! Did you look at how these people bullied me? I was almost killed!”

“Human boy, hand this lass over! Otherwise, we’ll kill you together!”

“Talk so much rubbish with him for what? Just a human bug, kill him together!”

“Huhu, this girlie said that this human is her backer! This girl is using a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven to scare us!”

“Hahaha

...”

... ...

When these Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses heard that, they all burst out laughing.

Ye Yuan looked at Jingfei and could not resist rolling his eyes as he said crossly, “You lass, how many things have you done that incurs both the wrath of heaven and men?”

The present Jingfei already broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm too.

However, after breaking through, her ability to cause trouble also increased greatly.

But Ye Yuan was very surprised. This lass actually waited for him for ten years!

Seriously?

Jingfei had an innocent look as she said, “I got bored of waiting for you. I had to find something to do.”

Ye Yuan’s face became black as the bottom of a pot.

This was not finding something to do. You’re turning this sea region upside down!

Looking at these seafolks who were glaring like ravening tigers, this hurdle today was probably not so easy to clear.

Ye Yuan said to the group of Saint Sovereign Heavens with clasped hands, “I’m really sorry about it. My sister is young and ignorant, and she offended everyone. This Ye apologizes to everyone on her behalf! Looking on account of this Ye’s face, everyone, please lift your hand high up in mercy and let her off.”

“A lower Saint Sovereign Heaven dares to sell face too? You really don’t know how the word death is written!”

The large turtle in front said disdainfully, “Your face? How much is your face worth?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Ye’s face should still be worth some money.”

The large turtle gave a cold snort and said, “Reckless and blind thing. Since you’re courting death, then this exalt will send you off!”

The large turtle roared and charged toward Ye Yuan while swaying its body.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and just pointed an ordinary finger out.

Bang!

The large turtle immediately flew out backward a thousand feet away!

Everyone’s expression changed wildly!

They knew that this large turtle was Xuanming Divine Turtle. Her cultivation realm already reached upper Saint Sovereign Heaven.

This level of powerhouse was sent flying by Ye Yuan with one finger?

“Gah, pissing this exalt off! This boy is a little creepy. Everyone, attack together and finish this brat off. Then we kill that little wench!” The large turtle roared and charged over again.

Ye Yuan’s figure swayed, and he disappeared from where he was.

Bang, bang, bang ...

In several breaths of time, Ye Yuan threw dozens of punches out.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

It was only to see one figure after another flying out like a fireworks display.

Each person was merely one punch!

Even Jingfei was dumbfounded from watching too.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, how did you become so incredible? Hehehe, I can do whatever I want in the future! This young lady wants to see who dares to provoke me!” After the surprise, Jingfei clapped her hands in joy.
