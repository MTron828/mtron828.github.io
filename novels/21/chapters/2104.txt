Chapter 2108: Aggrieved

“Master, that Crimsonsky has already been clamoring outside for many days, saying that he wanted to challenge you in front of the entire city.”

The moment Ye Yuan exited seclusion, Loneswan came up to greet him.

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up and he said with a smile, “Oh? Go out and take a look.”

The two people walked out of the front door and discovered that outside the door there was already a huge crowd of people.

Challenging the Second Sage, this sort of thing, and in addition to it being in front of everyone in the city, there was naturally tremendous appeal.

Furthermore, the people present already knew that Crimsonsky was High Priest Redplume’s disciple. His strength was bound to be extremely strong.

These two people’s alchemy battle would absolutely be unusually exciting and extremely worth seeing.

“Lord Second Sage, Crimsonsky is unworthy but wants to challenge you!”

“Lord Second Sage, do you see it? Everyone is looking forward to you taking action!”

“Lord Sacred Ancestor High Priest, huddling up like a turtle, wouldn’t you lower Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s reputation?”

... ...

Outside the front door, Crimsonsky shouted at the top of his voice, his voice spreading all around.

These people were probably mostly summoned by his loud voice.

But he became wiser this time, calling ‘Lord Second Sage’ time and again, not daring to have the slightest bit of arrogant action.

Seeing Ye Yuan come out, Crimsonsky’s eyes lit up. He then gave a bow toward Ye Yuan and said, “Lord Second Sage, Crimsonsky has been waiting here for a long time!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You want to challenge me?”

Crimsonsky nodded and said, “Right now, everyone in the city is saying that Lord Second Sage’s name falls short of reality. A mere Six-star priest at the True God Realm, how can he take on the name of Second Sage? Hence, Crimsonsky has come forward on my own accord and wants to request Lord Second Sage to give a pointer or two in front of the demons in the entire city, so as to rectify the name of Lord Second Sage.”

“Yeah, Lord Second Sage! If you want to obtain our recognition, then take out a bit of strength!”

“We really want to see on what basis you become the Second Sage!”

“Not letting us see your strength, we absolutely won’t acknowledge that you’re Second Sage!”

... ...

The ones that came to crowd around, quite a number of people were all priests and thought very highly of Second Sage this title.

With Crimsonsky saying so, it immediately aroused many people’s resonance.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly. His heart was like a clear mirror.

Crimsonsky, this kind of person whose eyes were at the top of their heads, it was impossible to have this kind of cunningness. There was definitely someone plotting at the back.

But since he dared to come to Westspirit Region, he naturally did not fear challenges.

Ye Yuan revealed a look of amusement on his face and said smilingly, “Can defeating you prove the title of Second Sage? Crimsonsky, you’re also thinking too highly of yourself, right?”

Crimsonsky could not help choking when he heard that. The others were also directly tongue-tied.

Yeah, what kind of existence was Second Sage?

That was an Alchemy Dao powerhouse second only to Sacred Ancestor High Priest. How could a mere Crimsonsky be mentioned in the same breath?

Crimsonsky discovered that in front of Ye Yuan, he was a complete and utter noob.

He was like a ball of clay, Ye Yuan could knead him however he wanted.

Really aggrieving!

“Lord Second Sage, are you avoiding my challenge?” Crimsonsky gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan avoiding and not fighting with this as the reason right now, no one dared to say a word of no.

You want to challenge me, you were totally not qualified enough!

“Huhu, why would this sage avoid the battle? Telling you all this is just to let you understand your statuses! I know that you think that by reaching Ancestor Realm, you are conceited and think that you can challenge this sage. Then this sage will let you understand how great the disparity between you and I is!”

Crimsonsky’s brows raised up, and he said with a big laugh, “That’s what you said!”

“I said it,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

... ...

Second Sage and High Priest Redplume’s disciple, Crimsonsky’s battle, swept throughout the entire city like the wind.

In the plaza, there were massive crowds of people. Not even a needle could be poked in.

The demon race’s priests all raked their heads, wanting to squeeze a little closer.

On the stage, Crimsonsky looked at Ye Yuan with a smug look and said with a smile, “Lord Second Sage, the humiliation that you gave me these few days, I’m going to claim it all back.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp and he said in a solemn voice, “Humiliation? You’re saying that you showed no respect to your superiors and then I punished you to kneel and repent; it’s humiliation?”

The moment Crimsonsky heard, he almost bit his tongue off.

How aggrieving!

A little carelessness and he fell into the pit again.

Making him maintain a modest and polite mentality toward a person whose realm was even lower than his was seriously too hard.

When talking, a moment of carelessness that he would reveal his true colors.

“N-No, I ... I didn’t mean that. What I’m saying is, Lord Second Sage please guide me well,” Crimsonsky said stammeringly.

In front of so many people, if he was punished with kneeling again by Ye Yuan, it would really be a huge loss of face.

Today was making Ye Yuan lose face, not make himself lose face.

Crimsonsky secretly hated in his heart, swearing that he would definitely make Ye Yuan lose very horribly!

But Ye Yuan was secretly laughing in his heart, but was calm on the surface as he said, “Relax, this sage will guide you well.”

Humph, humph, when the time comes, who guides who is still not known! Just you be smug, you’ll be crying later! Crimsonsky smiled coldly in his heart.

He was extremely confident in his strength and that he absolutely would not lose to Ye Yuan.

This fight also attracted the attention of many parties.

On an inconspicuous watchtower, Gongyang Lie stood with his hands behind his back. Behind him stood Xin Luo.

Crimsonsky’s deflated appearance was naturally taken into his sights in its entirety.

Gongyang Lie could not help shaking his head and he sighed and said, “Crimsonsky’s talent is indeed great, but his experiences are too little. He isn’t Ye Yuan’s match at all!”

Xin Luo smiled and said, “Huhu, I believe that this fight will also be of tremendous help to Lord Crimsonsky. He was eyed by Lord Redplume at a very young age and his road was smooth-sailing. In terms of scheming, he naturally can’t compare to Second Sage.”

Gongyang Lie’s gaze was sharp as he said, “This Ye Yuan, I have no idea what background he has either. He’s young, but he is like an old monster in the way he conducts himself. He is proud, but he doesn’t look down on everyone and everything. He is domineering, but he also doesn’t lose the sense of propriety. Even this emperor also has to be careful in front of him.”

Xin Luo also said in agreement, “Second Sage this title is virtually utilized by him to the extreme. He didn’t consider everything and everyone beneath his notice because he is the Second Sage, but he also used the title of Second Sage to pressure us until we can’t breathe. He truly is a troublesome character.”

Gongyang Lie’s gaze landed on the Ye Yuan far away and asked, “How high do you think Crimsonsky’s chances are for this fight?”

Xin Luo smiled and said, “This battle, Lord Crimsonsky will definitely win!”

Gongyang Lie said in surprise, “Oh? Why is that?”

Reaching Ancestor Realm was reaching another world.

Whoever was stronger or weaker was really hard to say.

Gongyang Lie also had no choice but to admit that Ye Yuan’s talent indeed surpassed everyone, including Crimsonsky. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xin Luo seemed to know what Gongyang Lie was thinking and said with a smile, “Talent is one thing, but strength is another. If we don’t reach Ancestor Realm, we don’t have any strength to fight back at all in front of Ye Yuan. But Crimsonsky stepped into Ancestor Realm a thousand years ago, while Ye Yuan had merely stepped into it for several hundred years at most, or even shorter. In addition, Lord Crimsonsky was taught by High Priest Redplume. Letting him out this time, the goal is to probe Ye Yuan’s strength. This indicates that High Priest Redplume feels very optimistic about Crimsonsky! If I must choose one among the two of them, I’ll naturally pick Crimsonsky!”
