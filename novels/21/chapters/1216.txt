Chapter 1220: Accumulating Wealth via Dishonest Means

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This middle-aged man’s actions made everyone jump in fright.

Up until now, there were people who doubted fake Ye Yuan’s identity before. But no one really dared to come forward to provoke.

After all, Ye Yuan’s current prestige was unparalleled.

Such provocation, a single misstep would incur a fatal disaster for oneself.

Everyone all looked toward this ‘Ye Yuan,’ wanting to see how he would respond.

Who knew that ‘Ye Yuan’ smiled faintly and said, “Everybody knows that this young master’s strongest martial technique is the Heaven Shattering Dragon Roar. But, once this move is unleashed, probably no one on the scene can survive. This brother, if you don’t believe this young master’s identity, just feel free to unleash a move at this young master. This young master absolutely won’t retaliate.”

No matter what, this calm composure made quite a few people accept his identity already.

This was the demeanor that an expert should have.

“Heh, bragging got to have a limit too! Not fighting back, I want to see how much capability you have.”

The middle-aged martial artist gave a cold laugh. A saber suddenly slashed out, its impetus exceedingly shocking.

Seeing this move, everyone’s expressions immediately changed greatly.

If this blade’s power really cleaved down, even a Void Mystic powerhouse would be split into two with one blow as well!

However, a scene that made people even more astonished occurred.

When this blade reached 20 feet away from his body, it was no longer able to advance an inch further.

“S-So strong!”

There was a series of exclamations, all being stunned by this scene.

But when White Light saw this scene, he smirked and said disdainfully, “Throwing mist over people’s eyes, shameless!”

The real Ye Yuan smiled and said, “People who understanding Divine Dao laws in the Divine Realm are too few. Even Void Mystic Realm powerhouses don’t know much either. This person’s strength is already pretty good. It’s just that this acting is truly a bit too fake.”

Ye Yuan’s perception was extremely acute.

Boom!

‘Ye Yuan’ entire body shook, immediately sending that middle-aged man flying.

That middle-aged man already had a look of admiration at this time. Bowing towards ‘Ye Yuan’ in a salute, he said, “Many thanks, Heaven Surmounting Divine King, for showing mercy! This lowly one has eyes but can’t see, and affronted Your Excellency. I hope that Your Excellency can pardon the offense. Legends say that the Heaven Surmounting Divine King’s power of domain is unparalleled under the heavens and can forcefully withstand the attacks of a fiendgod without a scratch! With Your Excellency’s strength, if you’re not the Heaven Surmounting Divine King, who else dares to admit it under the heavens?”

The middle-aged man’s words utterly dispelled everyone’s suspicions.

This ‘Ye Yuan’ was virtually identical to the one in the rumors!

Not only was his strength very terrifying, he even had his close brother, White Light, and his soulmate, by his side.

‘Ye Yuan’ smiled faintly and said, “No worries. This young master’s tolerance isn’t that small yet. This young master was originally cultivating in the Godsfall Mountain Range. I heard that there are quite a few of my human race martial artists entering the Godsfall Mountain Range, that’s why I specially came out of seclusion. At present, my human race is facing a race-extermination crisis. Every martial artist’s life is very precious. This Godsfall Mountain Range is very dangerous, this young master also faces a narrow chance of survival inside. But, this period of time, this young master has pretty much figured out the terrain and area within the forbidden area, and drew it into a map, marking out the dangerous places inside.”

The moment ‘Ye Yuan’ said this, a look of elation immediately appeared on the group of martial artists’ faces.

This Godsfall Mountain Range was abnormally dangerous. If not for having no choice, they really would not dare come here to seek out opportunities.

Those who dared to enter the Godsfall Mountain Range had to at least be Divine King Realm powerhouses too.

Otherwise, they would not even know how they died.

If there was a Godsfall Mountain Range map, then it would be completely different.

At least, it could greatly increase their chances of survival.

“The Heaven Surmounting Divine King is indeed well-deserving of being our human race’s leader! Such a valuable thing, and he’s actually willing to take it out to share with everybody too.”

“I harbored the resolve to win or die trying coming to the Godsfall Mountain Range this time. The Heaven Surmounting Divine King’s map is absolutely able to increase the chances for me!”

“There’s actually still such a good thing! The Heaven Surmounting Divine King’s bearing is truly incomparable!”

...

The group of people guessed what ‘Ye Yuan’ was going to do, and they all looked incomparably excited.

This sort of good thing, nobody would refuse it either.

Who knew that ‘Ye Yuan’ heaved a sigh and said, “Usually, this map would be given for free to everyone; there’s no harm either. It’s just that ... everyone also knows that my Mystic Gate is defending alone, and the war affair is critical, all kinds of resources are in short supply. Among these, there’s especially a shortage of spirit medicines! You all came to this Godsfall Mountain Range to seek a slim chance of survival. It’s likewise making a contribution to the human race. I feel relieved. It’s just that the other martial artists are killing the enemy at the front and requires everyone’s support even more. I hope that everyone can loosen your purse strings liberally and support my human race’s warriors! Of course, this young master won’t insist on you all taking out how much, just depends on everyone’s thoughts. How’s that?”

With this said, a hint of a smile involuntarily surfaced on the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, immediately understanding this fake Ye Yuan’s objective.

Going this one big circle, it was merely to borrow his name to earn money dishonestly.

But, this guy’s words were said extremely beautifully, making people all unable to refrain from gasping in admiration.

He said that he would not force, but there were no less than four to five hundred martial artists present. How could there really be people who had the nerve to take worthless things to serve as a stopgap.

After all, he was standing on the grounds of the human race’s righteous cause.

The moment his voice faded, the middle-aged martial artist who previously questioned him was immediately the first one to step forward and respond.

“Your Excellency exhausted your energy and racked your brains for my human race. How can we be stingy? Moreover, this map is too important to use. It can even be said to be a life-saving object! I’m willing to take out three stalks of Tier 9 spirit medicines as well as 5000 high-grade heavenly essence crystals to exchange for a copy of the map!” said the middle-aged martial artist.

With him saying so, everyone’s expression changed.

This middle-aged martial artist set the price straight away the moment he spoke up.

If the things that they took out were too shabby, wouldn’t they be despised to death by others?

Finished talking, the middle-aged martial artist was ambiguous as well, directly handing three stalks of Tier 9 spirit medicines and 5000 high-grade heavenly essence crystals to ‘White Light’s hands, and swapped for a map.

But when the others saw the situation, they were still somewhat hesitant.

It was just that the allure of the map was huge for them. All of them were not willing to leave.

That middle-aged martial artist gave a cold snort and said disdainfully, “You guys are really too stingy to pull out even a hair! Our compatriots are killing the enemy in front. No idea how many died and are in urgent need of our resources to go save lives. But you guys are all actually so miserly. Truly disappointing to the extreme!”

With this, how could those people still keep their dignity, all loosening their purse strings generously one after another.

“Give me a map! I’ll offer four stalks of Tier 9 spirit medicine!”

“Give me a copy too! I don’t have Tier 9 spirit medicines on me, I’ll use top-grade heavenly essence crystals to pay it off then!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

...

Normally, they definitely would not be like this.

But under the crisis of race extermination, they more or less still had to have some face. Coupled with the allure of the map, they could only toughen their scalps and go for it one after another.

Ye Yuan smiled and said faintly, “Let’s go.”

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not have the intention of looking into it, White Light and the rest also followed Ye Yuan and left.

Who knew that the fake Ye Yuan actually saw their group of people about to leave, and could not help laughing coldly as he said, “Those few ... truly have such thick skin! Our warriors are splashing the battlefields with blood, but you’re not sparing a single cent, heh heh ...”
