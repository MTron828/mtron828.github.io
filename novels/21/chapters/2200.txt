Chapter 2204: As Easy as Blowing off Dust

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed drastically.

Chen Yan’s head went buzzing and almost exploded.

Why did this boy not know the proper way to act at this sort of time?

As long as he endured until Chen Lie they all broke through, with two mighty Deity Realms here, would they still need to be afraid of Luo Sheng?

“A’Ning, quickly kneel down! The prestige of Divine Being can’t be affronted!” Chen Yan said with a low cry.

But Ye Yuan shook his head very seriously and said, “Grandpa Yan, I’ve considered it very seriously. He really can’t take it!”

“Hahaha ...”

Luo Sheng let out a loud laugh and pointed at Ye Yuan and said, “A trash who doesn’t even have essence energy actually says that this deity can’t handle a kneel from you? If I insist on you making obeisance today?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said again with a serious look, “I won’t do obeisance even if I die!”

Luo Sheng nodded slightly and said to the subordinate beside him, “Go, make him kneel down! If he doesn’t kneel, beat until he kneels!”

Chen Yan’s expression changed greatly and he wanted to get up, but then he heard Luo Sheng say in a solemn voice, “Nobody is allowed to move! Anyone who moves, dies!”

Everyone was silent like cicadas in winter, how could they still dare to move?

They did not understand why Ye Yuan would be so stubborn.

Just making an obeisance, one would not die.

That subordinate had a pleased look as he swaggered in front of Ye Yuan.

At this time, A’Xiu suddenly stood up. Blocking in front of Ye Yuan, she said with a stubborn look, “You’re not allowed to touch him!”

Pah!

Everyone did not react to it and A’Xiu was already struck flying by the subordinate with one slap.

“Divine Being said that whoever moves dies, are you deaf?”

As he said, the subordinate pulled out the saber at his waist and chopped over toward A’Xiu without the slightest hesitation.

“A’Xiu!”

Chen Yan’s face changed wildly, but it was already too late to want to stop it.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed greatly too and pounced toward A’Xiu without thinking, using his body to protect her below him.

Clank!

This saber landed on Ye Yuan’s body without the slightest hesitation and emitted the sound of metal clashing.

The faces of the villagers changed again and again.

They first gave a cry of surprise, all thinking that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

But Ye Yuan did not die.

The saber, shattered!

Yes, completely and utterly shattered.

“Ouch! My hand!”

The subordinate gave a painful cry. The saber that only had the hilt remaining fell to the ground, the webbing between his thumb and index finger being shocked until fresh blood spurted wildly.

Everyone had stunned faces. The one who was hacked was fine, while the person hacking was badly mutilated?

“What happened? Could it be that A’Ning’s body is as tough and strong as steel?”

“This guy is really strange!”

... ...

Casually refining divine-grade divine pills, and being impervious to swords and spears from head to toe.

It turned out that even after losing one’s memories, the person could still be so formidable!

Only Chen Yong’s gaze flickered, connecting it to Ye Yuan’s ease when chopping firewood in his mind. Could it be that this guy was a body-refinement martial artist in the past?

Now, he somewhat believed Grandpa Yan’s words. Ye Yuan’s origins were likely really not simple!

Luo Sheng’s two eyes narrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “No wonder you’re so cocky. It turns out that you’re a body-refinement martial artist! However, in front of the power of Deity Realm, everything is drifting clouds!”

It was only to see him leap up. A force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas billowed to the sky.

The faces of the villagers all turned ashen pale, being stunned by this power.

This was the power of Deity Realm!

This kind of power crushed everything!

“DIE!”

Luo Sheng arrived in front of Ye Yuan with a leap and planned on killing Ye Yuan with a palm.

Facing this power, Ye Yuan’s complexion also turned deathly pale.

He wanted to avoid this palm, but once he dodged, A’Xiu would die without a doubt.

Helpless, he could only forcefully withstand this palm.

Bang!

Thud, thud, thud ...

Luo sheng fell back several dozen steps in a row before barely managing to stabilize his figure.

He looked at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment.

This palm landing, Ye Yuan was completely unscathed, while his own palm already could not lift up anymore!

How could this guy’s body be so tough?

The villagers had blank faces, looking at Ye Yuan with incredible shock.

Wasn’t a Deity Realm an invincible existence?

Why was it that when facing such a frail A’Ning, he could not even harm a hair?

Luo Sheng’s face fell and he turned angry from embarrassment and said, “Brat, consider yourself ruthless! However, I want to see how many people you can protect! Kill for me! Spare none!”

Luo Sheng’s party was very strong, far from what the Chen Village could compete with.

Let alone that there was even Luo Sheng, this Deity Realm powerhouse around.

A hint of viciousness flashed across Luo Sheng’s eyes, and he said to Chen Yan in a cold voice, “Old thing, to dare defy this deity’s orders, seeking death!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“STOP!”

However, right at this moment, two powerful auras surged to the sky, arriving in front of everyone in an instant.

“Patriarch!”

“A’Jian!”

When the villagers saw these two people, each and every one of them was inexplicably roused.

While Chen Yan had a look of astonishment on his face as he said in shock, “You ... How did you guys break through so fast?”

Chen Lie smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t know what’s going on either. Upon swallowing the medicinal pill, my realm reached grand completion, then I broke through to the Grotto Profound Realm without the slightest obstacle, not needing the slightest effort at all!”

Chen Jian also had a look of wonder as he said, “Me too! Furthermore, this is still only the beginning. My realm is soaring crazily all the way, breaking through all the way to the late-stage Grotto Profound Realm before stabilizing.”

Chen Lie nodded his head and said, “Me too! What’s even scarier is that even though I broke through to the late-stage Grotto Profound Realm, my realm is incomparably sturdy, without the slightest signs of instability!”

Chen Lie and Chen Jian’s current realm was not the initial-stage Grotto Profound Realm, but it was the late-stage Grotto Profound Realm!

When Luo Sheng saw these two people, his face immediately turned ashen, shock on his face.

He was angered out of his mind by Ye Yuan just now and did not detect that these two people were not around for some time.

Who would have thought that in a blink of an eye, Chen Lie and Chen Jian, these two people, actually directly broke through to the late-stage Grotto Profound Realm?

Meanwhile, he was merely just at the initial-stage Grotto Profound Realm.

Chen Lie two people could trample him to death with one foot.

But at this time, there was already no one who would go and pay attention to him. Everyone cast shocked gazes toward Ye Yuan once more.

Just what kind of medicinal pills did this guy refine!

Even Chen Yan was also in a mess this time.

He had never heard before that a divine-grade divine pill could let a mortal directly breakthrough to late-stage Grotto Profound Realm!

This sort of thing was simply fantastical!

Divine-grade medicinal pills were already the limits of what he understood.

As for whatever purple spirit, void spirit, with his status, he was unable to come into contact with them at all.

Of course, if he came into contact with them, he would only be more shocked.

How could he know that the Jadeheart Pills which Ye Yuan casually refined already reached the peak of vast spirit divine-grade?

Although Ye Yuan was still in a state of amnesia currently, his pill refining skills practically flooded every cell in his body.

Refining a mere rank one divine pill was simply using a cannon to kill mosquitoes, wasting his talents on a petty job.

“A-Alright. Talk about A’Ning’s matters afterward. We need to deal with the matter on-hand first,” Chen Yan adjusted his dry throat and said.

Chen Lie nodded slightly and looked towards Luo Shen, his face full of killing intent.

Thud!

Luo Sheng directly knelt down without another word and wept, “T-Two lords, this lowly one had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai! I ... I beg you to spare my life! From today onward, the Luo Village will follow the Chen Village’s lead! Oh, right, this lowly one collected quite a few good stuff these few years. I’m willing to offer them up!”

Chen Lie’s gaze turned intent and he said, “Are there divine rank spirit medicines?”

Luo Sheng repeatedly nodded and said, “Have! There are some!”

Chen Lie and Chen Jian exchanged a glance and smiled.
