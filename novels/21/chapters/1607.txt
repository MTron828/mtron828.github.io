Chapter 1611 Repaying Ingratitude With Kindness

Expending a Herculean effort, Song Qiyang finally refined the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill.

He secretly heaved a sigh in relief, wiped the sweat on his forehead, and lamented in his heart, “So freaking tired!”

Disregarding the level, the refining difficulty of the Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill was already not less than some low difficulty rank four divine pills.

But right at this time, a mocking voice entered his ears.

“Look at you refining a rank three divine pill, why is it like you’re having a constipation? I’m even somewhat doubting now, are you really a Four-star Alchemy God? They all said that you’re once the Pill Tower’s Three-star Alchemy God’s number one person. I think this standard is also just so-so!” Gu Han’s mockery seemed particularly grating on the ears.

Clearly, he had long finished the refinement, watching Song Qiyang refine with an amused expression by the side.

Song Qiyang was angered until his face was livid and he said furiously, “Punk, don’t get too cocky! Flash out your medicinal pill for everybody to see, then be rampant with me!”

Gu Han shrugged his shoulders and said, “See then see, am I scared of you?! After I finished refining it just now, I observed by the side for a while. Regarding winning a rookie like you, I still have confidence.”

Finished talking, Gu Han directly opened the furnace.

When everyone saw Gu Han’s medicinal pill, each and every one of their faces revealed a look of despair.

“Why?! Why that kid can actually refine a high-grade Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill!”

“The disparity is too great! With Song Qiyang’s pill refinement situation, it’s at most also middle or low-grade.”

“Sigh, could it be that my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, nobody can come out and take care of this punk?”

Each and every one of these people sighed incessantly. These few days, they were triggered badly by Gu Han.

It was just that none of them thought of Ye Yuan at all. Because the current Ye Yuan would not be included in the junior group long ago.

Ye Yuan was a Pill Tower elder, that was an existence with extremely high status. How could it be possible to get involved in this level of competition?

But if not counting Ye Yuan, there really wasn’t someone capable of withstanding Gu Han’s genius now.

He already made the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City lose all of its face.

Song Qiyang’s expression was incomparably ugly. People are aware of their own affairs, he reckoned that his medicinal pill was most likely just low-grade.

This medicinal pill, he struggled greatly to refine.

Gu Han’s face revealed mockery as he said, “Why? Don’t dare to open? Or is it that you already know that you lost? Doesn’t matter, according to our agreement previously, the one who loses bow three times to the victor, then say three times ‘I’m a rookie, who greatly admires Lord Gu Han,’ and this matter will be considered over.”

Song Qiyang’s face turned red, standing there being at loss.

In a corner building, River Eternal Imperial City’s head elder had a regretful look. He said with a smile, “Brother Ruo Xu, looks like your Heavenly Eagle Imperial City really has no successor! I heard that this is the disciple that you’re most proud of? He actually only has this bit of capability?”

Ruo Xu’s face turned as black as the bottom of a wok and said, “Ling Zikun, you merely hit the jackpot and ran into a good apprentice. Being smug for what?”

Ling Zikun smiled and said, “Brother Ruo Xu, don’t get angry. Juniors sparring a bit, why are you so angry? You look at when Xuan Yu’s female disciple lost that day, she was much calmer than you!”

Ruo Xu said with a cold snort, “Ling Zikun, did you come to my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to assume great airs, or do you really have important matters? If there aren’t important matters, please go!”

Ling Zikun smiled and said, “Look at what you’re saying, this old man naturally came here because I have important matters. But this matter isn’t urgent for the time being, so I stopped for a longer period of time here. While I’m at it ... let the little fellows spar a bit, it’s also considered getting acquainted!”

“Humph!” Ruo Xu gave a cold snort and stopped speaking.

In the crowd, in an inconspicuous corner, Ye Yuan asked Ning Tianping next to him in a low voice, “The others all did this?”

Ning Tianping nodded and said, “Otherwise? This punk is too cocky, but nobody can do anything to him. That’s why he’s arrogant until now.”

In that case, Ning Siyu also bowed to Gu Han.

Ye Yuan did not have overtly angry emotions. This kind of small squabbles was just like children fighting to the current him.

His horizons and state of mind were far from what Gu Han, this kind of kid, could understand.

It was just that Ning Siyu was also considered half his disciple. Being defeated by a little brat, he still felt ashamed.

“Why? Senior Apprentice Brother Song is the disciple that Head Elder Ruo Xu values the most, it wouldn’t be can’t bear a loss and want to repudiate your debt, right?” Gu Han said with a smile that was not a smile.

Song Qiyang’s face turned into the color of pig’s liver. Making him, a Four-star Alchemy God, bow to a Three-star Alchemy God, and even had to call the other person lord, this was simply even more uncomfortable than eating a fly.

But in front of so many people, if he went back on his word, then what he disgraced wouldn’t just be him alone, there was also the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s people.

“Goddamit, what kind of world is this? Why are there so many freakish existences?”

Song Qiyang cussed in his heart, resolved his heart, and was just about to bow, but had their collar held by someone from behind.

Turning around to look, he could not help opening his mouth wide.

When the onlookers saw this young man who suddenly appeared, each and every one of them became incomparably excited, virtually almost shouted out.

Ye Yuan did a hush hand gesture, signaling everyone to be quiet.

Those people immediately understood and instantly quietened down.

But that look of anticipation on their faces could not be concealed no matter what.

Gu Han looked at everyone’s reaction, his face revealed a suspicious look.

Who was this? Why did everyone have this kind of expression?

Seemed like the moment this kid came, he could overcome the raging tides.

The other party was clearly just a grand completion Origin Deity.

In terms of realm, he was not even as high as him!

This kind of rookie wanted to beat him?

Dream on!

Didn’t he see that this Four-star Alchemy God in front of him already lost to him?

“Ye ...”

Song Qiyang was just about to speak but was interrupted by Ye Yuan. He said coolly, “Alright, leave it to me here. You go to one side and watch.”

Seeing Ye Yuan say so, Song Qiyang was akin to being granted amnesty and heaved a long sigh of relief in his heart.

He never dreamed that Ye Yuan would actually come forward at this time.

One had to know, his past with Ye Yuan was rather unpleasant!

If it were him, he might also want to watch Ye Yuan lose face on the stage, then go up and send this hateful punk packing.

Thinking this way, Song Qiyang could not help being somewhat moved in his heart.

He discovered that compared to Ye Yuan, he was simply a despicable person!

He repaid ingratitude with kindness, letting him leave casually at this time. It could be said to save his face to the greatest limit.

For the first time, Song Qiyang somewhat regretted opposing Ye Yuan.

“Halt! Senior Apprentice Brother Song, are you going to go back on your word here? If you do so, where you want Head Elder Ruo Xu’s face to go?” Gu Han did not take Ye Yuan seriously at all and said in a solemn voice.

Song Qiyang’s figure froze, and sure enough, stopped moving.

Ye Yuan waved his hand at him, indicating for him to go down, and said coolly to Gu Han, “He didn’t renege. His bet with you, I’ll take it over.”

Gu Han sized Ye Yuan up and down with a glance and said with a snicker, “You? A mere Three-star Alchemy God, what right do you have to help a Four-star Alchemy God take over? Your face isn’t that big yet!”
