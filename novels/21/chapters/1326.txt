Chapter 1330: Two-star Evil Spirit!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Y-Your Excellency, previously, we have affronted. Your Excellency, please don’t take offense!” Chang Liang cupped his fists and said respectfully.

His back was already drenched in cold sweat, feeling palpitations of lingering fear and rejoicing in his heart.

Fortunately, he did not become enemies with Ye Yuan. Otherwise, the seven of them brothers, the ones who died would not be just Number Three and Number Seven.

When a thousand late-stage One-star evil spirits besieged Wang Yutao they all, Chang Liang was watching from outside.

That spectacular scene made it hard to forget all his life.

Forget about it happening to Wang Yutao, even Chang Liang, this spectator, felt his scalp tingle.

But seeing the Wang Family’s people fall one by one, Chang Liang was incomparably delighted in his heart.

The Wang Family’s people were too overbearing, killing two of his brothers indiscriminately. Served them right to have this kind of end.

Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes and said nonchalantly, “Not to the extent of taking offense, but as long as you guys don’t provoke this young master, this young master naturally won’t go and find trouble with you all. Originally, I wanted to let you all run your own course without external interference, but seeing the feelings between you brothers run so deep, willing to help each other at the expense of your life, that’s why I made a move.”

Dustless had constantly been monitoring every movement and action in the vicinity. The things that happened outside the Ghost King Cave could not hide from him at all. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Originally thought that the Yin Wind Seven Heroes, these greedy fellows, the feelings between the brothers were probably just like that.

But he did not expect that Chang Liang, as well as Number Three and Number Seven, were actually so loyal.

Ye Yuan felt a spur of the moment. That was why he let them in.

After Dustless absorbed some evil spirits, his condition improved considerably all at once.

His methods also made Ye Yuan secretly dumbfounded.

Dustless simulated the undulations of a grand completion One-star evil spirit with a secret at, commanding these late-stage One-star evil spirits to besiege the Wang Family’s people.

To a late-stage One-star evil spirit, a grand completion One-star evil spirit was an absolute sovereign!

One-star evil spirits did not have any intelligence. They acted entirely based on their own instincts.

Hence, as long as Wang Yutao they all dared to enter the Ghost King Cave, that outcome would absolutely be miserable.

“Yes, yes, yes, Your Excellency. Previously, the few of us were committing stupidity! The Wang Family is too strong, the few of us brothers don’t have hopes of taking revenge at all, that’s why we would divert the hatred onto you! Hope that Your Excellency pardons it!” Chang Liang said.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said, “Honestly speaking, I also didn’t think that the Wang Family would be so utterly devoid of consciousness. Just because you guys were a guide for me, they vented their anger on you all. But the Wang Family, this young master will certainly purge their names from Jewelhill City! If the few of you follow me, there will come a chance to take revenge for your brothers in the future.”

Chang Liang’s eyes lit up, and he said joyfully, “For Your Excellency to be willing to take us in, it’s our honor! The few of us brothers are willing to dash our brains onto the ground and follow Your Excellency to death!”

Chang Liang signaled his brothers with a look and prostrated.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “En, you guys following this young master, this young master naturally won’t dispense with your benefits. It’s just that, this young master can’t tolerate any mistakes and transgressions. If you all still want to have any filthy ideas like before, don’t blame this young master for being ruthless!”

Chang Liang was alarmed and hurriedly said, “Dare not, dare not! The death of Number Three and Number Seven taught this Chang a profound level! Currently, this Chang’s only wish is to personally kill Wang Yutao that bastard and take revenge for Number Three and Number Seven!”

Ye Yuan was just about to open his mouth and speak when suddenly, his expression turned grim.

Chang Liang’s expression changed as well, It was as if he was being stared at by a venomous snake.

Around them, a series of powerful auras emerged, surrounding the six of them in the middle.

“Grand completion One-star evil spirits! Your Excellency, this ... What to do here?” Chang Liang exclaimed.

The great battle previously finally still startled these powerful existences!

Same as human martial artists, grand completion One-star, this level of evil spirits, were not easy to deal with.

Suddenly, a strange vortex storm spread out with Ye Yuan as the center.

Those late-stage One-star evil spirits were involuntarily sucked into the vortex, finally being absorbed by Ye Yuan!

A thousand late-stage One-star evil spirits did not have the slightest bit of resistance, directly becoming Dustless’ food.

Seeing this scene, the eyes of Chang Liang and the rest stared like wide-saucers.

While controlling a thousand evil spirits was beyond comprehension, Ye Yuan actually devoured a thousand evil spirits. This was seriously too terrifying.

He ... Wasn’t he afraid of stuffing himself to death?

Chang Liang and the rest had run around here for no less than several hundred years. But they had never seen before someone who dared to deal with evil spirits in this way.

Ordinary martial artists, even grand completion Grotto Profound martial artists, did not dare to devour an evil spirit either!

Chang Liang swallowed his saliva, discovering that this lord was truly too mysterious.

The Wang Family definitely went soft in the head, that was why they provoked such a terrifying foe.

Somehow, Chang Liang suddenly was somewhat sympathetic for Wang Yutao.

At present, the surroundings had roughly 20 to 30 grand completion One-star evil spirits. These ferocious-looking evil spirits were actually incomparably wary of Ye Yuan at this time.

Even though they surrounded everyone, all of them were fearful and did not go forward.

These evil spirits all did not have intelligence. But it was precisely because so that they could faintly perceive the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s terror.

This kind of instinctive dread made them not dare to go forward.

Myriad things in the world reinforce and counteract each other. Evil spirits were extremely powerful existences to human martial artists.

But the Soul Suppressing Pearl was their nemesis!

Only after seeing this scene did Chang Liang finally let out a sigh of relief in his heart. At the same time, he was incredibly shocked too.

In this Yin Wind Den, human martial artists all made detours when seeing evil spirits.

But today, he actually saw evil spirits feeling fear towards humans.

Chang Liang felt that the events that happened today simply subverted his world view!

Seeing Ye Yuan slowly open both eyes, Chang Liang could not resist asking, “Your Excellency, what should we do now?”

Ye Yuan ignored Chang Liang, but his gaze turned towards the depths of the cave.

The depth was a stretch of darkness, unable to see anything.

“Since you came, why hide furtively?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Chang Liang and the rest were stupefied, with baffled looks on their faces.

Didn’t late-stage One-star evil spirits already come out? Could it be that there were still others here?

Just as they were wondering, a ghostly light emerged from the depths of the darkness.

A figure slowly walked out from the darkness.

Right away, when this person came out, Chang Liang five people all palpitated endlessly.

The powerful aura made them unable to move even a muscle!

This person was too strong!

With his strength, wanting to kill the five of them could probably be accomplished with a wave of a hand!

How could there be such a powerful existence in the Ghost King Cave?

The arrival was a man, looking elegant and suave, like a fine and handsome young master.

This figure was not much different from ordinary people. But looking closely, one could discover that his body was somewhat illusionary, appearing not so real.

“You, human, are rather special!” the man said with a smile.

Hearing the meaning in his words, he was actually not a human!

Facing this man’s powerful aura, Ye Yuan seemed to be completely fine.

Hearing that, he also smiled and said, “I also didn’t expect that inside this Ghost King Cave, there’s really a Two-star evil spirit! Also, O didn’t think that a Two-star evil spirit was actually as refined as you!”
