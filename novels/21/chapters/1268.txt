Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Isn’t this the senior who defeated that fiendgod on that day? Haha, he finally took action! With him around, the human race is all guaranteed!”

“Who’s that lord? Is he very strong?”

“Heh, more than strong! The last time, that fiendgod took advantage of the Heaven Surmounting Divine King and Zhuge Qingxuan fighting until both sides suffered heavy losses and ambushed the dragon clan. It was this lord who made a move to repel him!”

“So formidable? That fiend race fellow is too cocky, to actually say whatever the Divine Realm is his! Really bullying that my Divine Realm has no one!”

...

Fang Tian’s sudden appearance gave the dragon clan’s powerhouses a heart-calming pill.

The scene of him defeating Kanuo that day was still vivid in everyone’s mind.

That heaven-shocking attack left an extremely deep impression on everyone.

And only then did those human race powerhouses know that turned out the human race still had an existence comparable to the Heaven Surmounting Divine King!

With this, their hearts finally went back in place.

They did not know how strong Kanuo was and also did not know how strong Fang Tian was.

In their view, the Heaven Surmounting Divine King battling three great fiendgods alone and even slaying one of them, was already powerful to the extreme.

No matter how strong these two people were, they also would not be stronger than Ye Yuan.

Therefore, the ignorant were fearless, this sentence, still made a lot of sense.

Fang Tian’s emotion was far from as relaxed as them.

“Heh, Fang Tian brat, you and I have fought for 50 thousand years. Today, this deity is finally going to banish you into the dirt!” Kanuo said with a cold laugh.

Ever since being suppressed by Absolute Heaven a million years ago, Kanuo could be said to be depressed to the extreme in the Immortal Grove Region.

All the way until 50 thousand years ago, he saw Heavenly Dao dwindle to zero, and humans were no longer able to step foot into Deity Realm. He thought that his chance had come.

Did not expect that the little known Fang Tian came soaring into existence, severely injuring him once more.

Toward Fang Tian, Kanuo hated to the extreme.

Now, he finally returned to the peak, returning as a king with the realm of a heavenly fiendgod.

How could there be the logic of Fang Tian not dying?

But First Level said with a face like an old well without ripples: “Kanuo, you didn’t succeed even after struggling for a million years, could it be that you still remain too obstinate to realize your error? This Divine Realm’s Heavenly Dao cannot tolerate you! Even if you returned to the peak, do you think that you’re this old man’s match? Don’t you forget, even if you’re any more powerful, you’re also merely a Half-Deity Realm! There isn’t an insurmountable gap between us!”

Fang Tian’s words made Kanuo’s heart thump.

Fang Tian’s words hit the mark!

Back then, Lord Fiend Empyrean made him and Yue Ji search for the Immortal Grove Region, and find Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s empyrean spirit treasure.

They found the region andentered it, but a million years passed, and they still did not complete the mission.

Not that their strengths were not strong enough, it was because this Immortal Grove Region’s Heavenly Dao rejected their appearance!

Could it be that this Fang Tian obtained some trump card again, that was why he was so confident?

Empyrean spirit treasure’s could not be surmised with common sense!

At this time, Fang Tian already had no other means and could only put on an empty-fort strategy, scaring Kanuo away.

But it looked like this empty-fort strategy seemed to be somewhat effective.

“Heh, so what then? You’re indeed very formidable, but compared to the Absolute Heaven back then, you’re still a little inferior! Even Absolute Heaven couldn’t do anything to this deity, could the likes of you? Moreover, this deity has obtained the Fiendsource Bead now. My strength is even greater compared to back then! Today, I want to see if this Immortal Grove Region’s Heavenly Dao is really that so powerful!” Kanuo said with a cold smile.

He was not so easy to bluff. Preparing for so many years, how could he easily give up?

Rolling fiend energy spread out from Kanuo’s body. Clouds of black gas virtually blotted out the sky and obscured the sun.

Only at this time did those humans before know how terrifying this Kanuo’s strength was!

Fang Tian’s expression was incomparably ugly. He also did not expect that this Kanuo was actually so decisive in going for the kill. He could not even delay for half a second.

He knew that that was already no way out!

Fang Tian did not value his life, he just could not bear to see ten thousand miles of land become a sea of blood.

Without the slightest hesitation, Fang Tian removed his seal on the essence energy sea. A powerful essence energy undulation made the human race powerhouses extremely inspired with enthusiasm.

Evenly-matched in strength!

Just looking at the magnitude of the essence energy, he and Kanuo both belonged to Half-Deity Realm; barely any difference.

But following the release of the essence energy seal, Fang Tian’s appearance aged at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Seeing this scene, Kanuo was first stunned, then burned with a monstrous rage. In the end, he let out a wild laugh!

“Hahaha ... It turns out that you’re already an expiring lamp that ran out of oil! What a terrific Fang Tian! You’ve bluffed this deity so bitterly these few years! Today, this deity is going to ground you to dust. Only then can it give vent to the hatred in my heart!” Kanuo laughed from extreme anger and said.

Only now did he know that Fang Tian was long a dying lamp already!

If he was not scared away the last time, there would not be today’s matter long ago already.

He would not need to recover his peak strength and would be able to capture all of the people that posed a threat to him in one fell swoop!

Now, he wasted the greater part of a year’s time in vain. But what he waited for was such a result!

“Senior, we’ll fight side by side with you!”

At this time, over a dozen figures arrived in the air, standing together with Fang Tian.

Teng Yun, Long Min, Zhong Zizhen, and the rest revealed decisive looks. This scene was rather solemn and stirring.

“Humph! A bunch of ants! This deity will let you all take a look today, at just what kind of being a Heavenly Fiendgod is!”

Kanuo looked at everyone in disdain. Both hands forming a seal, a terrifying power of law wafted between heaven and earth.

Above the void, that monstrous fiendish energy gradually condensed to form a gigantic true fiend dharma idol. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The power emitted by that true fiend dharma idol made everyone’s faces change drastically!

“Brahma True Fiend! One Palm Destroying World!”

Kanuo’s cold voice sounded out as if he blew the horn that was destroying the world.

The true fiend dharma idol slowly opened its eyes. Everyone felt their blood run cold.

That feeling was really like it was Armageddon!

This true fiend dharma idol was too terrifying!

The people’s gaze all involuntarily gathered on those dozen over profiles in the air.

That was their final hope!

Fang Tian’s complexion was deathly pale. No one was sure if it was because he was already a dying lamp, or because of the pressure than the true fiend dharma idol gave him.

The true fiend dharma idol slowly raised its palm. A scent of despair instantly swept across the human powerhouses.

“Hahaha ... Enjoy this final despair! After today, the human race shall be thoroughly erased from the Immortal Grove Region! This Immortal Grove Region is my fiend race’s!” Kanuo said with a crazed laugh.

A palm slowly pressed down. The entire space seemed to be squashed.

World destroying power, it was really not a brag!

“Do it!”

Fang Tian mustered up all of his final essence energy. A palm burst forth brazenly.

A terrifying force welcomed the true fiend palm!

Fang Tian’s strength could not be said to not be strong. This place actually just nice blocked the true fiend palm!

The other powerhouses also did not have the slightest hesitation, bringing out all of their strength one after another, welcoming the true fiend palm.

“Blocked it! Haha, blocked it!”

“Saved! If this palm were to land, we’d be dead for sure!”

“This senior has such formidable strength, to actually be able to block such a terrifying palm!”

...

However, the people’s excitement of surviving a disaster had yet to last for two breaths of time, and everyone’s faces already changed drastically!
