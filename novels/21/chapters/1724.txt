Chapter 1728 Intercepting

After Ye Yuan left, a middle-aged man walked into Jian Hongxiao’s shabby room.

Seeing Jian Hongxiao’s appearance, the middle-aged man’s expression changed. He hurriedly went up to support.

If Ye Yuan was here, he would recognize that this middle-aged man was one of the seven great Celestial Deity powerhouses who appeared that day.

He was called Jian Chen, Jian Hongxiao’s most trusted apprentice.

“Master, a-are you okay?” Jian Chen asked concernedly.

Jian Hongxiao waved his hand and said, “I, this old bunch of bones, won’t die for the time being. But I didn’t think that the Heavenly Dao’s backlash this time was actually so powerful!”

Jian Chen said with a resentful look, “Master, is doing so worth it?”

Jian Hongxiao gave him a glance and said with a smile, “After Master came to be enlightened, I’ve long already severed the thought and planned to die old here. Who knew that before the Hundred Battles Arena this time, this old man did a divination, and the matter actually had a turnaround.”

Jian Chen’s expression changed and he said, “Could it be that this turnaround lies on that kid?”

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “Although this old man can’t calculate Ye Yuan’s numerology, I can divine my own fate. The divination shows that Master’s affair has a turning point, but when Master wanted to continue divining in-depth, my own numerology was actually covered up by Heavenly Dao. Connecting these two matters, isn’t it confirmed with Ye Yuan?”

Jian Chen had a look of astonishment and said with a disbelieving look, “Master, that kid is merely at the initial-stage Divine Lord Realm. How many years and months do you have to wait for him? Moreover, your vitality is badly damaged right now, longevity taking a big dip. Can ... Can you wait until that day?”

One had to know, Jian Hongxiao already suffered Heavenly Dao’s backlash before this. He already suffered a huge loss in longevity to begin with, his realm falling drastically.

This time, for Ye Yuan’s sake, he suffered serious injuries again, his vitality greatly damaged, lifespan decreasing again.

At this time, Jian Chen was worried that his master could not persevere until that day.

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “Heh heh, you and I are both the progenitor’s successors, so how can we doubt our own fate? Man proposes, God disposes. I can only do my best, the rest will be left to Heaven.”

Jian Chen fell silent, having nothing to refute regarding his master’s words.

As a member of the Jian Family, he should act in harmony with heaven.

Since he saw a turning point, then he should go all out to do it.

Seemed like his master’s cultivation base was indeed far deeper than his!

Jian Chen was silent for a moment and said, “Master, this disciple already got some news. Ningbei Imperial City’s Xiahou Wenjian already brought along three great Celestial Deity powerhouses and is already on the way to Extreme Light Imperial City. Ningbei Imperial City is a high-order imperial city, their strength isn’t weak! What ... should we do?”

Jian Hongxiao did not reveal a look of surprise and said coolly, “You make a trip. A measly Ningbei Imperial City, if offended, then offended, there’s nothing serious.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jian Hongxiao said it very casually, not placing Ningbei Imperial City in his sights at all.

...

Ye Yuan bade farewell to Jian Zhentao and brought Ning Tianping out of Extreme Light Imperial City, speeding like the wind toward the Demon Divine Region.

The Demon Divine Region was in the land of extreme west. Passed through the Demon Divine Mountain Range and it was the gathering place of the demon race.

The territory there was called Demon Divine Region.

The Demon Divine Region was a chaotic place where the strong reigned supreme and the weak were prey for the strong.

Maybe White Light wanted to train himself. That was why he would go to the Demon Divine Region.

But he did not expect that he actually let himself fall into danger.

Ye Yuan silently prayed in his heart, hoping that nothing happened to White Light.

Through so many years, he and White Light were as close as brothers.

In terms of feelings, it was no worse than with Yue Mengli.

“Your Excellency, rest assured. Brother White is blessed and will definitely be fine.” Ning Tianping comforted him by the side.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said in a solemn voice, “This departure, just the journey on the road alone will take as long as several decades! With White Light’s strength back then, he’d likely have to fly for at least 300 years before he could reach the Demon Divine Region and couldn’t make it back to Heavenly Eagle in time at all. This punk didn’t take the 500-year-agreement to heart at all, infuriating me to death!”

Ning Tianping smiled bitterly and said, “Your Excellency, this really can’t blame Brother White. You aren’t aware of just how great the pressure of being by your side is. Just take me for example. Back then, I broke through to become a Third Firmament Divine Lord in one stroke, strength far surpassing yours. But just how many years had passed, you can annihilate me in one move now! Even though I believe that Your Excellency definitely won’t fall behind others, I also didn’t expect that this day would come so quickly!”

In the past, Ning Tianping still somewhat did not understand White Light their thoughts.

But now, he completely understood.

His Excellency was simply a freak!

Come one day, when you could really only follow behind him to make tea and pour water, that would really be called a blow.

Even though Ye Yuan did not have this intention at all.

Bang!

All of a sudden, the Purple Extreme Hall trembled violently. Ye Yuan’s and Ning Tianping’s chests seemed to have been struck by a heavy object, directly spewing out a large mouthful of blood.

“Little bastard, hurry up and come out to die! Otherwise, this seat will shake you to death today!”

A powerful voice transmitted in from outside.

Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping two people exchanged a glance, both incomparably shocked as they said, “Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse!”

Furthermore, it was not an ordinary Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse!

Ye Yuan put away the Purple Extreme Hall and revealed his figure.

Outside, four figures blocked the way.

“Uncle Xiahou, it’s him! It was him that killed Big Brother Yun! Uncle Xiahou, Big Brother Yun he died so miserably! You have to avenge him!”

The one who spoke was precisely Jiang Mengqing.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he immediately understood who this Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse in front of him was.

Xiahou Wenjian looked at Ye Yuan coldly, as if looking at a dead person.

“Little bastard, competing in martial arts in the ring, you actually dared to kill my son! Today, this seat is going to extract your soul and refine it for ten thousand years in front of Yun-er’s tombstone!” Xiahou Wenjian said angrily.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Competing in the ring, life and death are up to fate! Moreover, Xiahou Yun was instigated by people and wanted to harm me, so he deserved to die!”

“Shut up!”

Xiahou Wenjian roared furiously, his voice carrying boundless world power.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping were akin to being struck by lightning, fresh blood spurting wildly.

Just a voice made the two without the slightest strength to fight back.

Too strong!

This Xiahou Wenjian was at least a middle-stage Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse.

This kind of powerhouse, their strength was already unimaginable.

Xiahou Wenjian said with a cold smile, “Little bastard, how can your cheap life be mentioned in the same breath with my son’s? If he wanted to kill you, you should have stretched your neck out to be executed!”

In Xiahou Wenjian’s eyes, his son’s life was even greater than heaven.

Xiahou Yun’s talent was exceedingly high; sufficient to inherit his position.

Letting Xiahou Yun went out this time was to get the approval of Extreme Light Imperial City.

Who knew that he would be gone forever.

Jiang Mengqing also had a baleful look as she said, “Two little bastards! How can your lives compare to Big Brother Yun’s? Today, I’m going to take revenge for Big Brother Yun!”

Done talking, Jiang Mengqing raised her longsword and charged over toward Ye Yuan.

How could Ye Yuan do as she wished? He was just about to fight back when suddenly, an incomparably powerful burst of world power descended, suppressing him until he was completely immobile!”

Ye Yuan’s face changed, golden light radiating brightly on his body, blue patterns revolving to the extreme.

Clank!

Jiang Mengqing’s sword seemingly stabbed onto refined iron, shocking her arm until it turned numb.

“Brother Xiahou, Ye Yuan is my Extreme Light Imperial City’s distinguished guest, please lift your hand high in mercy and let him go.”

At this time, a figure slowly appeared and said these words to Xiahou Wenjian.
