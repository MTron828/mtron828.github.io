Chapter 2232: Blood Sea Phenomenon

“Such thick carnage energy!”

Ye Yuan two people arrived before a long and unbroken stretch of mountains. A thick scent of bloody smell hit face-on, stirring up a sinister wind by his ears.

Under the illumination of sunlight, this mountain range actually gave off a series of blood-red light halo.

In the dense woods, numerous Ghost Dao powerhouses came and went.

But sensing the powerful auras coming off of Ye Yuan two people’s bodies, they did not dare to draw near.

“Young Master, be more careful. Humans coming to this place need to open up their world domains to resist the carnage energy. This carnage energy is extremely harmful to humans. Even Empyreans will find it hard to withstand its corrosion too!” Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade warned.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “Resist? Why is there a need to resist?”

Finished talking, his cultivation method revolved. He actually absorbed these carnage energies frenziedly.

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade’s two eyes became wide saucers, a look of shock on his face.

His young master was actually absorbing the carnage energy!

“Young Master, you!” Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade cried out in surprise.

“That human is actually absorbing carnage energy. I think that he’s tired of living!”

“Jeje, perhaps he feels that our ghost race is pretty good and wants to join our ghost race?”

“Eh, something’s wrong! Why is his aura becoming stronger?”

In the distance, came some Ghost Dao powerhouse’s disdainful voices. But very soon, they discovered something amiss.

Humans were unable to use this carnage energy to cultivate at all.

Absorbing into the body would only harm their bodies.

But Ye Yuan’s aura was actually becoming stronger!

Ye Yuan absorbed for a while and immediately felt refreshed.

The thickness of this carnage energy could virtually catch up to the thickness of the devilish energy in the Dragon Eye Cave. Using it to cultivate naturally yielded twice the results with half the effort.

Seeing Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade’s dazed expression, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Carnage energy, devilish energy, heaven and earth spiritual energy, there’s essentially no difference. It’s just that the attribute is different, that’s all. The carnage energy here is extremely thick. It’s a superb cultivation ground for me. After finding the Silvernet Blood Essence, I want to enter closed-seclusion for a few days here.”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade had a look of astonishment on his face and said with a sigh of admiration, “Young Master’s talent, even Lord Immortal Grove is far inferior!”

He had followed Ye Yuan for a short time after all. So he was far from aware about Dustless’s experience with Ye Yuan in the past.

While chatting, the earth suddenly quaked and the mountains shook. An even stronger carnage energy gushed out from underground. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The bloody light above the mountain range became incomparably forbidding, giving people a hair-raising feeling.

The Asura Blood Pool entrance in the distance, countless Ghost Dao powerhouses gushed out, fleeing like they were flying, all of their expressions seemingly incomparably terrified.

Behind them, bloody light shone brilliantly.

Those that were enveloped by the bloody light directly turned to ashes.

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade had an anxious and doubtful look as he said, “This ... What terrifying power! What in the world happened in the Asura Blood Pool?”

But a hint of surprise flashed across in Ye Yuan’s eyes and he said, “Such a phenomenon, I’m afraid that a precious treasure came into being!”

At this time, a deadpan face came beside Ye Yuan and said coolly, “This is already the third time within a month! I heard that in the other two major blood pools there, such phenomenons similarly erupted. Looks like the Asura Blood Pool that has been quiet for countless years finally can’t hold back anymore.”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and immediately sensed that this corpse path powerhouse was very extraordinary.

“You’re a frequent guest of this place?” Ye Yuan asked.

The other party nodded his head and said, “I’m called Wu Jiang. I started braving the Asura Blood Pool starting from rank four.”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted slightly, revealing a hint of surprise.

The powerhouses in the outer-peripherals were many. Rank fours and rank fives could be seen everywhere. There were also quite a few rank sixes.

But Ye Yuan was clear that under such an environment, being able to cultivate all the way from rank four to rank seven was simply a miracle!

Looks like his feeling was not wrong. This Wu Jiang was very extraordinary!

“I’m called Ye Yuan! Since Brother Wu is a frequent guest here, then in your view, how high are the chances of the Silvernet Blood Essence appearing under this kind of phenomenon?” Ye Yuan asked.

Wu Jiang was startled, looking at Ye Yuan in surprise. Clearly, he did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually aiming for the Silvernet Blood Essence.

He shook his head and said, “Such a phenomenon, the Silvernet Blood Essence will definitely appear. It’s just that ... with your strength, I advise that you’d better don’t get yourself killed in vain.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Does Brother Wu want to team up with this Ye?”

Wu Jiang was slightly surprised, not expecting to be seen through with one glance by Ye Yuan.

He saw that Ye Yuan was actually able to absorb carnage energy to cultivate and felt that this boy was extraordinary. That was why he had the idea of making friends.

He had run around here for a long time and more or less understood the powerhouses here a little.

But there was no one capable of making him regarded the person with importance.

But this Ye Yuan, he gave him a feeling of being not simple from the first time he laid eyes on him.

Wu Jiang did not hide it either, nodding and saying, “This Wu has always moved independently for so many years and rarely found people to team up. But the blood pool abnormality this time is attracting more and more major powers. Furthermore, inside the blood pool is also filled with dangers. Hence, that’s why I had this idea.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Since Brother Wu thinks highly, then this Ye will accept deferentially rather than decline courteously.”

The voice had yet to fade when a terrifying aura descended from the sky.

“Hahaha ... With this Asura Blood Sea’s abnormality, there’s probably a peak Heavenly Emperor spirit treasure coming into being!”

Amidst the wild laughter, that ghost figure turned into a stream of flowing light and rushed into the cave by meeting the bloody light directly.

Wu Jiang’s expression changed, and he cried out in surprise, “Heavenly Emperor Purplecloud! Even he came too!”

His voice had yet to fade when several other fearsome auras descended.

Those auras completely disregarded the bloody light and charged straight into the Asura Blood Sea.

Ye Yuan was also startled inwardly when he saw the situation. These Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were all middle-stage Heavenly Emperor peerless powerhouses. Each and every one of them was starting to move restlessly.

Before long, another cloud of black gas descended.

Those who were slightly touched by the black gas directly turned to ashes, scattering away.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, and he exclaimed in shock, “A Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor!”

Wu Jiang’s deadpan face became several shades whiter and he said, “It’s Heavenly Emperor Quicksand! I didn’t expect that even he’s alarmed too! With this, Asura Blood Sea is lively!”

In merely half a day, Ye Yuan saw that there were seven to eight middle-stage and late-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses entering the Asura Blood Sea.

As for initial-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, those that entered were as many as more than a dozen!”

For some time, powerhouses gathered!

Of course, these Heavenly Emperors held in contempt toward the common treasures at the outskirts. They directly entered the depths of the blood sea.

No idea how long had passed. There were finally no more Heavenly Emperor powerhouses descending. Only then did everyone cautiously enter further inside the Asura Blood Sea once more.

Although the current Asura Blood Sea was dangerous, it was when the lucky chances were the most.

At this time, no one was willing to be outdone by others.

Perhaps a fortuitous encounter could let them soar to the heavens with one bound.

“Ye Yuan, it’s our turn to enter!” Wu Jiang said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Afraid that it isn’t that simple! Those entering now, the lowest are Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouses too. First Firmament Heavenly Emperors and Second Firmament Heavenly Emperors haven’t appeared yet, don’t you find it odd?”

Wu Jiang’s expression changed.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when several figures slowly walked out of the void.
