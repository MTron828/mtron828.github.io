Chapter 2228: Bring Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean Over!

Shinra Ghost Region was a land with extremely strong yin energy. Human martial artists did not dare to approach at all.

Legends had it that this place was once an ancient battlefield, with countless powerhouses who had died.

Countless remnant souls and skeletons experienced year after year of changes and became Ghost Dao powerhouses.

And this ancient battlefield also gradually evolved into the Shinra Ghost Region.

This place, Ghost Dao powerhouses gathered, there was no lack of Empyrean level powerhouses.

With Ye Yuan walking into Fengdu Ghost City, he immediately attracted the attention of many Ghost Dao powerhouses[1].

“Eh, it’s actually a human! Haven’t tasted the flavor of humans for so long! I didn’t expect that there’s actually someone who isn’t afraid of death delivering himself to our doorstep.”

“Jeje, what a delicious smell! His blood must taste very good!”

“All don’t snatch him from me! This human is mine!”

... ...

When several rank six Ghost Dao powerhouses saw Ye Yuan, each and every one of them salivated heavily like they had seen a delicacy.

Humans were delicious food in their eyes.

Rumble!

The moment Ye Yuan’s aura released, the pressure of Chaos Realm suddenly bloomed, directly crushing those few Ghost Dao powerhouses to dust.

The complexions of the other Ghost Dao powerhouses turned deathly pale, looking at Ye Yuan with horrified faces, turning around and wanting to flee.

“You, come over!” Ye Yuan suddenly pointed at a rank six heavenly corpse with a deathly pale complexion and said.

That heavenly corpse was no different from humans. It was just that his complexion was dreadfully pale.

At this time, because he was frightened, his face was even more without any rosiness.

“S-Senior, what instructions do you have?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’m looking for Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean. Do you know where he’s at?”

Fengdu Ghost City was an emperor-level ghost city, with the occupied territory being massive. There were three great Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperors inside.

The forces established by the three great Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperors were respectively called Yin Huai Manor, Vast Huai Manor, Li Huai Manor.

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean had once told him that he was under Heavenly Emperor Cangsu’s Vast Huai Manor.

The heavenly corpse said, “Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean? He ... He should be imprisoned in Yin Huai Manor currently!”

“Imprisoned?” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly.

The heavenly corpse nodded and said, “A few days ago, Yin Huai Manor suddenly attacked Vast Huai Manor. It caused a huge commotion in Fengdu Ghost City. Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean fumbled and was captured. Vast Huai Manor lost more than a dozen hidden streets.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent and he said, “Lead the way.”

The heavenly corpse was taken aback and said, “Where to?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Yin Huai Manor!”

The heavenly corpse said in surprise, “Senior, Yin Huai Manor has experts as plentiful as clouds, just the Empyreans are as many as more than a dozen! You’re all alone ...”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, with his tone turning slightly cold as he said, “Lead the way!”

The heavenly corpse was startled and said, “Yes!”

The heavenly corpse trembled with fear, bringing Ye Yuan around. They then arrived in front of a feudal government office that occupied a huge area.

On the feudal office was written three large characters, ‘Yin Huai Manor’!

Ye Yuan knew that Shinra Ghost Region’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouses did not easily move out as well.

As long as Heavenly Emperors did not take action, with his current middle-stage Chaos Realm strength, there were already not many in the Empyrean Realm who could do anything to him.

Moreover, Fengdu Ghost City’s three great Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperors were only First Firmament Heavenly Emperors.

Even if they wanted to take action, Ye Yuan had the power to protect himself too.

“Eh? Human!”

When Yin Huai Manor’s guards saw Ye Yuan, their two eyes lit up.

Ye Yuan stepped forward and said coolly, “I’m here to bring Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean away!”

The guards exchanged glances and suddenly let out loud hoots of laughter.

“Bring Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean away? Who do you think you are?!”

“What a delicious boy! His blood must be very sweet.”

“Boy, since you came, forget about leaving. Stay behind and let us brothers have a taste!”

Done talking, the few guards rushed forward and were about to tear Ye Yuan to pieces.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort. Stomping his feet, a horrifying air billow spread out with him as the center.

Bang, bang, bang ... Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The few guards directly exploded, turning into clouds of flying ashes.

The remaining force of the air billow did not diminish, directly shocking until the earth ruptured, transmitting into Yin Huai Manor.

After killing a few guards, Ye Yuan lifted his foot and slowly walked towards the feudal office.

That heavenly corpse’s eyes went wide. He even thought that Ye Yuan came to beg for leniency. But this guy was actually going to directly kill inside?

Nuts, right?

Yin Huai Manor was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s faction!

Even if you were an Empyrean, you also would not dare to rush like this, right?

Fine lad, this human brat is too domineering!

Ye Yuan caused a huge commotion, alarming Empyrean powerhouses very soon.

A Ghost Dao Empyrean stopped Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “Human punk, to dare act wildly in the Yin Huai Manor, are you courting death?!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Bring Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean over and I’ll leave at once.”

The Ghost Dao Empyrean sneered coldly and said, “Who do you think you are, you ask this Empyrean to bring him over and this Empyrean will bring him over? Then what face will the Yin Huai Manor still have to keep a foothold in the city?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Are you mistaken? I’m not discussing it with you. I’m just informing you! If he’s not coming out, then I’ll search for him by myself!”

The Ghost Dao Empyrean could not see through Ye Yuan’s actual situation. But he saw that Ye Yuan was young. Even if he was at the Empyrean Realm, he also would not be too strong.

Hence, he gave a cold snort and whirled toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s hand seals were like phantoms, and he said in a cold voice, “Seal!”

He instantly formed a formation!

The Ghost Dao Empyrean was directly sealed in the array formation by Ye Yuan, unable to even move.

Presently, Ye Yuan’s strength improved further. The power of the Hundred Schools of Thoughts Nine Profound Heaven Subduing Grand Array grew more than a magnitude stronger.

Dealing with a Second Firmament Empyrean Ghost Dao Empyrean, he did not need the slightest effort at all.

That Ghost Dao Empyrean had a look of terror. He totally did not see clearly how Ye Yuan made his move, and he was already completely sealed.

No matter how he urged his strength, he was unable to break free!

How could this human boy be so strong?

Very soon, there were several more Empyreans that came out again, and they were all sealed by Ye Yuan in one move!

The rank six powerhouses in Yin Huai Manor, each and every one of their eyes were almost popping out.

“Just who the hell is this human brat? He hasn’t made a serious move yet and half of Yin Huai Manor is already defeated!”

“This boy is an extremely formidable rank seven Formation God, too terrifying! If not for showing mercy, the few lord Empyreans would probably already be all dead!”

“This boy is here for Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean! He’s actually forcefully barging into Yin Huai Manor! Really crazy! Lord Chi Jue has already rushed over, so he’s dead for sure!”

... ...

While talking, an Empyrean powerhouse with a deadpan face appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

“Boy, it ends here! Take a step further and you’ll die without a burial ground!” Chi Jue said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “I said before, bring Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean over, and I’ll leave at once.”

Empyrean Chi Jue’s face fell, and he said in a cold voice, “Since you’re seeking death, then this Empyrean will send you off! Hah!”

It was only to see him roar wildly, a punch charging toward Ye Yuan.

This Empyrean Chi Jue was a corpse path Empyrean. His fleshly body was immensely powerful and was already late-stage rank seven.

A corpse path Empyrean primarily cultivated the fleshly body. A body full of tough muscles forcefully contending with Empyrean spirit treasures was nothing difficult.

It was just a shame that he ran into Ye Yuan.

Bang, bang, bang ...

In a blink, the two people clashed over several dozen moves.

Empyrean Chi Jue retreated wildly. His two meaty palms felt like they were already not his anymore.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a strange look, “You’re competing on physical body with me?”

Empyrean Chi Jue looked at Ye Yuan with a terrified look as he said in shock, “Perfect seventh transformation golden body!”
