Chapter 2173: Your Realm is Unimaginable!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Immobilize!”

Ye Yuan’s mouth lightly spat out a word.

The next second, the entire world was frozen!

The resplendent lightning snakes, five-colored lightning, dancing fog, including Long Yuan, everything and everything, was frozen!

The entire world was like a painting, being completely still!

Those crazily dancing five-colored lightning snakes, all of them stopped on top of Ye Yuan’s head.

Just like a kind of liquid that suddenly met with extreme cold, instantly being frozen.

This scene was incomparably bizarre.

Time, space, was seemingly completely frozen.

Suddenly, a hint of disharmony flashed past in the painting.

Somebody moved!

It was Ye Yuan!

Only to see him take a step out, his figure instantly crossing a distance of thousands of feet, arriving in front of Long Yuan.

Bang!

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan’s punch slammed onto Long Yuan’s face, directly blasting him flying.

At this time, a breath had just passed.

Time seemed to flow once more. The fog moved along with the wind once again.

However, that endless lightning sea dissipated with a loud bang, as if it had never appeared before.

Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning was broken!

At the outside world, all of the heavenly emperors’ thoughts were seemingly frozen by Ye Yuan’s one ‘immobilize’ word.

Of course, it was not that they were really immobilized, but that they were completely shocked by what happened on the light screen, resulting in forgetting to think.

All the way until a breath later did their thoughts similarly recover and move!

“W-What happened just now? Why do I feel like the entire mist world turned static?”

“Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning was broken just like this?”

“Could ... Could it be ...”

At this time, Morningstar slowly nodded his head, his eyes full of astonishment as he said, “Time Freeze! Which is also ... immobilization art!”

The moment these words came out, the platform immediately burst into an uproar.

All of the heavenly emperors’ faces were full of a crazed look.

“That’s impossible! Time Freeze, this is one of the dragon race’s strongest innate divine abilities, capable of making it completely still within a certain range! He ... He just broke through to Empyrean Realm and didn’t even awaken the Heavenly Dragon Mark. But then he comprehended this mighty divine ability?” Long Tianyu shouted shrilly.

Just a breath ago, he was still sentencing Ye Yuan to death, thinking that Ye Yuan was dead without a doubt.

After a breath later, Ye Yuan used the art of Time Freeze and slapped his face.

Of course, it also slapped everyone’s faces.

Everyone did not expect, and it was also impossible to expect that Ye Yuan actually grasped this astonishing divine ability.

One breath!

Very short!

Very very short!

Fleeting!

But this one breath was enough for Ye Yuan to do too many things!

Such as, breaking the Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning with one punch!

Powerful until the Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning which shocked all of the heavenly emperors was broken by Ye Yuan just like that.

“Time Freeze! Legends say that that’s a mighty divine ability that only the progenitor knows. It can be said to be a paramount divine ability among innate divine abilities! It ... It was actually grasped by him?” Long Zifeng already did not know what he should say.

Apart from shock, it was extreme astonishment!

The talent that Ye Yuan displayed already rendered them thoroughly speechless.

Was Long Yuan’s talent very strong?

Yes!

But Long Yuan’s talent was completely not worth mentioning in front of Ye Yuan!

That was the distance between a firefly and the bright moon!

If everyone was still immersing in the elation of obtaining a genius at the beginning, now, they even had a trace of fear.

When a person’s talent surpassed everyone’s understanding, he would be viewed as monstrous!

That was an aberrant lifeform!

The current Ye Yuan was an aberrant lifeform in the eyes of the group of heavenly emperors!

Morningstar sighed lightly and slowly said, “We all underestimated Ye Yuan! Being able to be bestowed a Heavenly Dragon Mark by a major power in the clan, how could Ye Yuan be ordinary? It’s just that this emperor also didn’t expect that he could even comprehend Time Freeze, this kind of mighty divine ability!”

... ...

In the Mist Battlefield, Long Yuan looked at Ye Yuan with a look of horror.

Just now, he thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

Suddenly in an instant, a strange power suddenly appeared, thoroughly binding him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In the eyes, the world was completely still!

He struggled desperately, wanting to break free of this strange power.

But, everything was futile.

Whatever Heavenly Dragon Mark, whatever Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning, in front of this strange power, it was not worth mentioning at all.

That feeling was seemingly like he was facing Heavenly Dao.

Insignificant!

He just felt that he was too insignificant!

Then, he was wrecked.

“Time Freeze! This is Time Freeze! You ... How can you possibly comprehend this innate divine ability? This isn’t possible! This is impossible!” Long Yuan said with a look of shock.

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said coolly, “You can’t do it, but doesn’t mean that others can’t do it. There’s nothing impossible in this world. It’s just that with your realm, you’re unable to imagine it. That’s all!”

Long Yuan’s entire body trembled, his eyes full of decadence.

He praised himself to be the Dragon Clan’s number one genius in one million ears and could show disdain for the world.

Comprehending the Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning, he was once pleased with himself, thinking that no one could do it anymore.

But, the height that Ye Yuan was standing at was far beyond his reach!

“Impossible! I’m a genuine dragon! How can I possibly be inferior to you, this half-human, half-dragon, lowly life-form? Five Elements Divine Punishment Heavenly Lightning, annihilate for me!”

Long Yuan suddenly launched an attack. Horrifying five-colored lightning fell from the sky, falling straight down.

The pride in his chest made him unable to accept this result at all.

Only a short while ago, he thought that he could casually eradicate Ye Yuan.

But now, he discovered that he was so laughable.

He was unable to accept this result!

Hence, he wanted to kill Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and he said in a chilly voice, “Reckless and blind!”

“Immobilize!”

Ye Yuan’s lips moved lightly, the word “immobilize” was spat out of his mouth again.

One word leaving the mouth, even with his strength, he felt drained too.

This kind of great divine ability, it was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to release it limitlessly.

Furthermore, the time of the Time Freeze this time did not even reach half a breath!

However, it was sufficient to kill Long Yuan!

From the start until now, Long Yuan always had a high and mighty appearance.

Attacking time and again, it all wanted to kill him.

If it were others, they would probably have been killed by Long Yuan no idea how many times already.

Until now, this guy still refused to come to his senses, did he really take him to be a good-two-shoes?

On the platform, when Morningstar saw this scene, his expression could not help changing drastically as he cried out in alarm, “Not good! Ye Yuan wants to kill Long Yuan!”

Virtually without thinking, Morningstar fired out several spells in a row.

A light beam suddenly charged into the Mist Battlefield and actually directly smashed Time Freeze.

The light beam directly covered Long Yuan, bringing him out of the Mist Battlefield.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, very unhappy in his heart.

He knew that someone made a move and rescued Long Yuan.

Apart from Morningstar, there naturally would not be others.

Although his Time Freeze was impressive, in front of a supreme powerhouse like Morningstar, it was completely useless.

Long Yuan was also restricted to First Firmament Empyrean. Otherwise, it would not have been possible for Ye Yuan to want to freeze for a breath of time.

In the end, Time Freeze only mobilized the power of Heavenly Dao.

The higher the realm, the stronger the comprehensions in Heavenly Dao too. Wanting to bind the other party with the power of Heavenly Dao would naturally be increasingly difficult.

However, under his certain-death scenario just now, Morningstar did not make a move to save him either.

But now, seeing that Long Yuan was about to die, he made a move to save him.

Ye Yuan was naturally outraged in his heart!
