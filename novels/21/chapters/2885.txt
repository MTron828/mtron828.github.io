Chapter 2891 Making a Show of Force!

Outside of Absolute Heaven, there were cheers.

Within Absolute Heaven, dark clouds were dense.

The blood race conferred the Blood Divine Son, this kind of major event naturally transmitted into the Absolute Heaven Barrier too.

This undoubtedly piled even more troubles on the Heaven One Alliance, which was facing an internal revolt and a foreign invasion.

“Everyone, Fellow Daoist Edgeless’ demise dealt too great of a blow to us! Absolute Heaven Barrier’s gap will enlarge further! Originally, this seat wanted to let all the sects’ elites cultivate with peace of mind in the rear, hoping that one or two Hegemon Realms could be produced. But now ... it probably can’t be done anymore!”

In the Absolute Heaven Barrier, Divine Lord’s voice was very heavy.

The chain reaction triggered by Edgeless’s demise was seriously too big.

His death affected not just South Qi Giant City but the entire Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Losing a Hegemon Realm force, the power of the Absolute Heaven Barrier was naturally greatly reduced too.

And the various major cities’ passageways would also expand. There would be more bloodkins entering them.

This way, the crisis that they would face would be all-around.

Each city needed even more powerhouses to be garrisoned before they could block the blood race’s offensive.

But, after so many years, Heaven One’s losses were seriously too heavy.

In these 20 over days, Heaven One Alliance was already forcibly drafting itinerant cultivators to enter the various major cities.

“This bunch of blood race bastards is unbelievably insidious! Humph! Scared of what? At most, just fight it out! If they really press Your Father into a corner, even if I die, a few others from the blood race will be dragged down too!” Hegemon Cloudmount said with a cold snort.

“Old Man Cloudmount, stop bullsh*tting here! The urgent matter on hand is what to do about South Qi there?” Hegemon Blacksun said.

“What else can we do? These are extraordinary times. The various sects’ disciples are mostly training outside. Rounding up the disciples also needs time! There are still ten days! As long as they can last ten days, it will naturally be fine. If they can’t last ... then just hope for the best!” Hegemon Cloudmount’s face had a rarely seen look of solemnness.

Clearly, the situation at present was already bad until it could not be worse.

“This time, I’m afraid that ... it’s very difficult! The blood race has chosen a new Blood Divine Son. This is a powerhouse that’s sufficient to suppress an era! He brought the new Saint Sovereign and True Sovereign Hundred Sons and has already arrived at Giant Net City! These 200 people are enough to hold off an army!” Divine Lord’s words revealed some helplessness.

The rest also fell silent.

Hegemon Cloudmount’s expression stirred, and he suddenly said, “I say, you guys, would Ye Yuan that brat be among these Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons or not? If there’s him being an inside man, maybe we have a glimmer of hope?”

Hegemon Blacksun smiled disdainfully and said, “Cloudmount, is your head spoiled? Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons are born in the Blood God Temple. How many tricks the blood race have, even you and I don’t know! Can he, a mere Saint Sovereign Heaven, really deceive all the Hegemons? If he really went to take part in the hundred sons battle, he’d probably be long dead at this time!”

The moment Cloudmount heard, he could not help sighing slightly too.

Although Ye Yuan’s Blood Imitation Pill was incredible, the blood race’s various means were very strange. No one could guarantee that there were some means to be able to find out.

“Then we can only depend on Feng Xiaotian himself this time!” Divine Lord said helplessly.

......

“Kneel down!”

“Blood Divine Son, Your Highness ...”

“This liege is making you kneel, can’t understand?”

Bloodsword knelt down with a look of unwillingness.

At this time, all eyes were watching!

City Lord Su Mu led everyone to welcome Ye Yuan’s party. The entire city was paying close attention.

Presently, Ye Yuan’s status had become different.

Comparable to that of a Hegemon Realm!

Hence, the welcoming standards naturally could not be lowered.

But, they never expected that upon meeting, Ye Yuan dealt an opening gambit, directly making Bloodsword kneel.

Bloodsword was an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse, Giant Net City’s deputy city lord!

This kind of powerhouse, his status was not low even in the Blood God Temple.

Now, he actually knelt down in front of the entire city!

In reality, Su Mu and Bloodsword had been paying attention to the hundred sons battle all this while.

Especially Bloodsword, he had been waiting for Ye Yuan to make a spectacle of himself all along.

Wasn’t he awesome?

One had got to know that there were too many amazing people in the entire blood race!

But, the more he paid attention to it, the more slapped in the face he felt.

It turned out that Ye Yuan had not even exerted half of his strength in Giant Net City!

Going to Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City, Ye Yuan similarly swept all away!

In the end, he even turned the Battle of Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons into a joke, everyone fighting to concede defeat!

At that time, he felt like his chest was going to burst.

What the hell! Was there still justice or not?

However, very soon, a piece of news that made him shudder came over.

Ye Yuan actually became the Blood Divine Son!

Even if he was Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons number one, sweeping away all Saint Sovereign Heavens, Bloodsword also would not dread Ye Yuan at all.

But Blood Divine Son was completely different!

This was the next king!

Obtaining this news, Bloodsword found it difficult to stomach blood and sleep easily at night.

Sure enough, the moment they met today, Ye Yuan immediately enacted revenge!

Ye Yuan looked at Bloodsword and said with a cold smile, “You feel that you’re Emperor Sakra Heaven, so it’s very impressive, right?”

Bloodsword broke out in cold sweat and said, “I-I dare not!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “This liege told you back then, Emperor Sakra Heaven is nothing in my eyes! Back then, you shrugged it off. But you didn’t expect that retribution would come so quickly, right?”

Bloodsword hurriedly said, “I-I dare not!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes were like lightning, and he said with a cold snort, “My blood race warriors only have the right to survive by continuously improving in battles! Being killed, they can only blame themselves for being less skilled than others! Killed a descendant of yours and you want to take revenge on this liege? So, if this liege wants to kill you now, is it also as simple as killing an

ant?”

Bloodsword sweated heavily and was practically crying. “Blood Divine Son Your Highness, spare my life!”

By the side, Bloodpromise could not continue watching anymore and could only step forward to urge him. He said, “Blood Divine Son Your Highness, Bloodsword was also overly anxious about his beloved son and didn’t have the intention to offend Your Highness! Please ...”

“Shut up for this liege! You fool, led an army of 300 thousand elites and actually couldn’t even take down a measly little South Qi Giant City, and you actually still have the face to speak up for him? This liege hasn’t settled scores with you yet!” Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold, and he scolded angrily.

The current Ye Yuan was really awe-inspiring, killing gods if gods blocked!

By the side, Yang Qing was envious to the extreme.

You, a human, freaking ran to the blood race to make such a show of force. It is really unbelievably satisfying!

This title of Blood Divine Son was really too useful!

Look at these Emperor Sakra Heavens; which of them were not major powers level powerhouses?

But they were like grandsons in front of Ye Yuan, unable to even retort.

Awesome!

Satisfying!

Sure enough, Bloodpromise’s expression became as uncomfortable like he was constipated, forcefully pushing back down the words at the back.

Ye Yuan did not care about their feelings. He was about to reveal his identity soon.

Not using authority when it was valid, it would become invalid after expiration!

At this time, he naturally had to posture to the extreme!

“Why? Reprimanding you and you’re unreconciled to it? In another few days, when Heaven One that side replenishes the troops, can you take down South Qi Giant City if I give you another 300 thousand?” Ye Yuan stared intently at Bloodpromise, making the latter feel a chill run down his spine.

He really did not have the confidence when it came to this!

Seeing Ye Yuan fly off the handle, he could only retreat embarrassedly. “Hegemon You Jin, Bloodsword had once attempted to harm this liege. This liege is going to kill him now. You don’t have objections, right?” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly as he looked toward Hegemon You Jin, who was not far away.
