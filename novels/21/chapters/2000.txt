Chapter 2004: I’ll Spare Your Life

At Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, there was panic and terror everywhere.

A piece of news came that Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s city lord, Empyrean Lu Yan, issued an Empyrean Order with the identity of city lord.

Within the boundary of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital, all 187 imperial capitals, all martial artists above Celestial Deity Realm, were all to head to Nine Pledge Imperial Capital and gather!

Empyrean Order, within the boundaries of a great imperial capital, it was a paramount order.

Cities that received the order had to put aside all matters and follow the order unconditionally.

But this kind of Empyrean Order might not be deployed once in a million years.

But this time, Empyrean Lu Yan utilized it!

The goal was in order to deal with an imperial city!

One had to know, in all 187 imperial capitals, each imperial capital had at least ten or more True God Realm powerhouses.

Some high-order imperial capitals even had several dozen True God Realm powerhouses.

How terrifying a force was this?

“Is this Empyrean Lu Yan mad? Dealing with us, a tiny little imperial city, he’s actually going to mobilize several thousand True God Realm powerhouses?”

“This ... How to fight this? Even if each of us has three heads and six arms, it’s also impossible to win!”

“Counting in Lord Ye Yuan and Lord White Light, Lord Leng Qiuling, as well as Lord Ning Tianping who just broke through, the True God Realm powerhouses in the city are also just six people when added together. Six versus several thousand?”

...

Everyone was in despair!

This kind of power comparison simply made people be in despair.

To an imperial city, a True God Realm was sufficient to make all of them look up to already.

But now, several thousand True God Realms were actually coming all at once. This kind of shock simply could not use words to describe.

Everyone only had one thought in their mind now, that was Empyrean Lu Yan went crazy!

He was driven mad by Lord Ye Yuan!

Inside the City Lord Manor, there was a depressing atmosphere. Everyone’s face was covered in a layer of frost, incomparably solemn.

“I really didn’t expect that Empyrean Lu Yan would actually be so crazy, sending out thousands of True God Realm powerhouses at once. This is pushing us to our wits end!” Jiang Jadehall lamented.

Everyone was silent, they really did not know how to follow up.

Under absolute power, all hard work was feeble.

Even if Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao was exceedingly formidable, it was also impossible to create thousands of True God Realms within a short time!

Let alone that among these several thousand True God Realms, some were even horrifying Ninth Firmament True God Realm existences.

Pick out any one of these people at random and it would be enough for Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to choke on.

“You guys, you guys say something! This ... Is this trying to stifle me to death?” White Light paced back and forth, seeming very anxious.

They all, these people, had always had blind faith in Ye Yuan.

But this time was different!

No matter how capable Ye Yuan was, it was also impossible to deal with these thousands of True God Realm martial artists!

When the others heard White Light’s words, each and every one of them heaved deep sighs, but they still did not speak.

They did not know what to say at all.

Right at this time, someone suddenly came to report that a powerhouse in a large black cloak came from outside, unable to see the face clearly.

Everyone exchanged glances. Already at this time, who would still pay a visit to request an audience?

“Let him enter,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Before long, a powerhouse completely covered in a black cloak appeared in front of everyone.

Ye Yuan sized the other party up and said with a slight surprise, “It turns out that it’s City Lord Yu, why would you show up here? At this time, you should be avoiding our Heavenly Eagle like the plague.”

That person untied his cloak and revealed his figure, looking at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly.

His disguise was actually seen through by him with one glance?

The arrival was none other than precisely Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s city lord, Yu Wenfeng!

Yu Wenfeng’s appearance caught everyone by surprise. Everyone looked over one after another, not knowing what medicine this guy was selling in his gourd.

Yu Wenfeng smiled bitterly and said, “Little Brother Ye really has terrific means. Looks like my guess was correct, you wouldn’t resign yourself to death like this.”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “City Lord Yu, you and I are at warring sides. Coming here ... aren’t you afraid that I detain you?”

Who knew that Yu Wenfeng let out a slight sigh and said, “Little Brother Ye, honestly speaking, this Yu came here to request for Little Brother Ye to show mercy. Under the Empyrean Order, this Yu is the Nine Pledge City Lord and has no choice but to become enemies with Little Brother, there’s really no choice! If there’s a possibility, this Yu really isn’t willing to be enemies with you.”

Yu Wenfeng’s wording made the Heavenly Eagle’s upper echelons that there present very surprised.

This guy’s head was kicked by a donkey, right?

Right now, both party’s strength disparity was so great. But he came to beg Ye Yuan to show mercy?

Did he figure out the situation or not?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “City Lord Yu, are you mistaken? Several thousand True God Realm powerhouses are sufficient to crush Heavenly Eagle dozens of times over, even dregs won’t be left. You’re actually asking me to show mercy?”

But Yu Wenfeng said with a solemn look, “Others don’t know your identity, but I know! Back then, when you were still at the Celestial Deity Realm, you already became the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder. How can there not be an Empyrean powerhouse supporting behind you? With the Myriad Treasure Tower’s rallying power, if they really want to have a showdown with Empyrean Lu Yan, it is also not impossible. Hence, I know that you absolutely won’t sit passively and await doom!”

Ye Yuan looked at Yu Wenfeng with a smile that was not a smile and said, “What you’re worried about is this? Then I can tell you that you don’t need to worry about it. The Myriad Treasure Tower’s Empyrean powerhouses won’t help me.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yu Wenfeng was taken aback, clearly feeling very surprised.

But after musing for a moment, he still said firmly, “Little Brother Ye, I know that you’re not an ordinary person and definitely have other means. All in all, I came here this time to tell you that my Nine Pledge Imperial Capital will hold a perfunctory attitude toward the Empyrean Order this time. I only hope that Little Brother Ye will show mercy when the time comes!”

Ye Yuan did not expect that when the whole world felt pessimistic about him, this Yu Wenfeng actually felt optimistic about him, and even took a huge risk to have him show mercy.

This time, he viewed Yu Wenfeng in a different light.

Yu Wenfeng’s guess was correct. He, Ye Yuan, was never a person who would resign himself to death.

Lu Yan came up with such a grand line-up, thinking that it could intimidate him, make him despair.

But he was wrong.

Ye Yuan slowly nodded and said indifferently, “Alright, I got it, I’ll spare your life.”

Yu Wenfeng’s pupils constricted, and he immediately nodded his head and said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “Many thanks, Little Brother Ye. This Yu is currently at the teeth of the storm. It isn’t advisable to stay for long, so I’ll take my leave first! After this matter, this Yu will personally drop in to give thanks!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly. Yu Wenfeng was secretly alarmed in his heart and immediately took his leave and left.

After Yu Wenfeng left, the others used extremely odd gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

White Light immediately jumped up and yelled, “Big Brother, you hid from us so bitterly! Turns out that you’ve long had a countermeasure, why didn’t you say so earlier?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You idiot, following Big Brother for so many years, don’t you understand me yet?”

White Light smacked his head and said gloomily, “I ... I was also stupefied this time. Such a grand display, it’s still my first time encountering it! I say, Big Brother, just what method do you have? Could it be that ... you invited an Empyrean powerhouse over?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “Invite what Empyrean powerhouse? I don’t have that ability! But ... we can create an Empyrean powerhouse ourselves!”
