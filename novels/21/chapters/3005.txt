Chapter 3004: Chaos Heaven Trampling Skill!

Although Ye Yuan had once made a fool out of him, Ye Yuan’s talent and conduct still brought Long Jian into submission.

Therefore, he still felt very optimistic about Ye Yuan.

But he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually ruined his own future in the Eternal River. This made him sigh endlessly.

“Sigh,?already completely crippled! I really don’t know how he was triggered to do this, to actually scatter his cultivation!”Long Ran also had a look of anger from his failure to live up to expectations.

“Origin divinity greatly damaged; Dao foundation crumbled. This boy is already hopeless! Even if he can recultivate anew, he should already thank his lucky stars to be able to cultivate to Sovereign Realm.”

Long Jian shook his head and directly gave Ye Yuan the death penalty.

Origin divinity greatly damaged was not a big deal to them.

But Dao foundation collapsing was something that nobody could save.

And right at this time, Ye Yuan, who was in the Eternal River, slowly opened his eyes.

Boom!

Suddenly, an astonishing aura erupted in the Eternal River.

A vortex actually appeared in the Eternal River.

This whirlpool grew bigger and bigger, and increasingly stronger. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Mn??What happened? Why would the Eternal River’s branch stream become so berserk? This is something that has never happened before!” Long Jian said in shock.

The greatest characteristic of the river of chaos was that it was quiet.

This was a river flow that never rested and also an incomparably quiet river flow.

But at this time, the silent chaos actually became extremely berserk.

“My goodness, I can’t comprehend anymore!”

“What happened? Isn’t this wanting people’s lives?”

“The power of chaos is already completely in havoc. How will people still cultivate?”

“Which bastard is it? Come out! Your Father won’t hack you to death!”

… …

Those geniuses were all enraged to the extreme.

Three years of comprehension, the vast majority of the people present had actually already reached the bottleneck.

But the chance to enter the Eternal River for the first time was something that only happened once in a lifetime.

Even if it was a minute, a second, it was very precious to them.

Therefore, many people could not resist letting loose a torrent of abuse.

And at this time, the vortex became bigger and bigger.

Long Jian’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in shock, “It’s Ye Yuan! What is this boy … going to do again? I-Is he absorbing the Eternal River’s water? Is he crazy?”

Everyone entering the Eternal River was to feel that boundless and everlasting aura of the Eternal River in order to gain insights.

The power of chaos in the Eternal River was the most fundamental power in the world; of course it could be absorbed.

But it could not be refined at all!

It was a form of energy too, but it was a kind of very ‘blunt’ energy. It could not be converted to divine essence at all.

Someone tried it before. He was even a Hegemon Realm powerhouse.

In the end, he died.

Stuffed to death!

The power of chaos entering the body completely blocked up the meridians within the body, and he died with divine essence completely exploding within the body.

Putting it bluntly, this thing could not be utilized by people.

Only when the power of chaos flowed into the heavens and myriad worlds, and a portion of the power of chaos converted into heaven and earth spiritual energy could it then be absorbed.

Now, Ye Yuan actually wanted to absorb this thing!

“This boy … really courts death limitlessly! It’s not enough that he played until he crippled himself. Is he going to thoroughly play himself until he dies?” Long Ran was already speechless.

As a Hegemon, having lived for several hundred thousand years, he felt that he had already seen and experienced a lot.

He had seen before too many geniuses.

But he had really never seen before a guy who sought death like this!

Long Jian was suddenly enlightened and said, “I understand! Is it possible that this kid saw the boundless power of chaos in the Eternal River, so he was suddenly hit with inspiration and started scattering his cultivation to absorb this thing? Does he think that by absorbing this power of chaos, he’s still able to cultivate back? How foolish is this boy?”

In the Eternal River, Ye Yuan started absorbing the power of chaos.

He had long detected that this power of chaos was higher level than heaven and earth spiritual energy!

However, this power of chaos was very dull and could not be absorbed at all.

And in these three years, he had been using the Wordless Heavenly Skill to mutually corroborate with the power of chaos all this while. He already created a cultivation method that belonged to him!

What the Wordless Heavenly Skill cultivated was the power of chaos. What was cultivated was also chaos divine essence.

Except, the power of chaos that it cultivated did not jump out of the scope of heaven and earth essence energy.

All the way until Ye Yuan saw the Eternal River did he truly understand what was called chaos!

Cultivation method operating, the power of chaos entered his meridians.

That turbid power appeared incomparably sluggish, unable to revolve at all.

But Ye Yuan had the Dao sword!

The quintessence of Ye Yuan’s new cultivation method was his Dao sword!

The Dao sword was Ye Yuan’s sword to defy the heavens. In a certain sense, he had transcended the scope of Heavenly Dao and was not tolerated by Heavenly Dao.

Therefore, using it to harness the power of chaos was the most appropriate.

When the power of chaos entered the Dao sword, Ye Yuan revolved his cultivation method.

Not long after, an archaic and thick divine essence flowed out of the Dao sword and entered Ye Yuan’s four limbs and bones.

Ye Yuan could feel that this chaos divine essence was several times stronger than his previous chaos divine essence!

However, this power of chaos was indeed too strong. Ye Yuan’s Dao sword realm was not high. The conversion rate was very limited.

Large quantities of chaos power entered the meridians, but what was converted into chaos divine essence in the end was very little.

Therefore, Ye Yuan needed large amounts of chaos power!

This was also why the Eternal River suddenly became violent.

However, Ye Yuan had the foundation of Emperor Cloud Heaven after all. Coupled with his powerful new cultivation method, recultivating to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum was not a big deal.

Two hours later, Ye Yuan broke through to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum anew!

Long Jian was shocked!

“This … How is this possible? He can actually absorb the power of chaos in the Eternal River? Furthermore, he broke through? Hasn’t his Dao foundation collapsed already? Why is it so easy to cultivate?”

Long Jian felt like his worldview was being subverted.

He felt that as a Supreme Hegemon, there were really not many things that he did not understand in this world anymore.

But now, he discovered that Ye Yuan this fellow was really an enigmatic existence.

His every action and movement, he could not even see through it.

From start to end, he had been mocking Ye Yuan for being naive and ignorant.

But now, Ye Yuan actually really started absorbing the power of chaos, and he even started cultivating.

Reality was blatantly face-slapping!

All these had transcended the scope of his understanding.

Long Ran was also surprised and said, “Hang on! His cultivation method is different from before! It seems … diametrically opposite! Could it be that he created a new cultivation method? Furthermore, this cultivation method can absorb the power of chaos in the Eternal River?”

Thinking up to here, Long Ran could not help drawing a cold breath.

This kind of thing, forget about them; even if it was Great Beyond Realm powerhouses, it was simply impossible to accomplish too.

If they could absorb the power of chaos here, they would have long absorbed it. Could they still have waited until now?

But, Ye Yuan, this ‘good-for-nothing,’ did it!

“Kid, you’re really remarkable! This cultivation method sets the world on fire! I’m somewhat looking forward to your future now! Kid, have you thought of how to name this cultivation method?” Mi Tian said excitedly.

He witnessed the birth of this cultivation method with his own eyes. When Ye Yuan absorbed the first wisp of chaos divine essence, he was dumbstruck with amazement.

Only then did he learn that it turns out that the power of chaos could be absorbed and refined!

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “I’m a divergent cultivator, destined to fight with heaven in the future! Since that’s the case, I’ll call it Chaos Heaven Trampling Skill!”
