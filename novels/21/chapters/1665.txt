“No matter what, consider it that I owe you a favor! Take this sword. In the future, if there’s any need, you can come to Thousand Soar Imperial Capital to find me.”

Leng Qiuling handed Ye Yuan a small and exquisite jade sword. It was very exquisite.

This jade sword was crystal clear. Holding it in the hand felt penetratingly cold. Clearly, it was not an ordinary item.

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of refusing either and said coolly, “Alright, then I’ll accept it. That sticky candy has already been shaken off. Fairy Leng, go back earlier and rest.”

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of going to find Leng Qiuling. But in order to set Leng Qiuling’s mind at ease, he still accepted it.

By the side, Ning Tianping was incomparably shocked. He did not expect that an iceberg beauty like this, a proud daughter of heaven, actually took the initiative to gift Ye Yuan something.

What shocked him even more was that Ye Yuan actually wanted to chase away such a sophisticated great beauty!

Leng Qiuling was clearly very surprised too. In these 500 years, it was still her first time encountering such a person.

Even if others knew that there was no hope, they were eager to stay awhile more with her as well.

But this guy in front of her actually wanted to chase her away!

“Mn, thanks.”

With Leng Qiuling’s temperament, she naturally would not say that she wanted to stay, directly taking her leave.

But in her heart, she kept feeling a little uncomfortable.

Walking halfway, she suddenly turned around again and said to Ye Yuan, “Oh, right, I urge that you’d best not go to the Heavenspan Mountain. Since remote antiquity, there has never been an Origin Deity Realm martial artist who could come down alive!”

Pausing for a bit, she added, “No matter how prodigious, it won’t work!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for Fairy’s reminder. This Ye Yuan will be careful.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s attitude, Leng Qiuling knew that he did not take it in at all and could not help being somewhat annoyed and irritated, turning around and leaving.

Sending Leng Qiuling away with his eyes, Ning Tianping said with a look of lament, “Tsk tsk, my lord is my lord. Seeing such a beauty and you’re not moved no matter what.”

Ye Yuan scolded laughingly, “My own relationships are a mess. So how can I be in the mood to be moved by other women?”

The moment Ning Tianping heard this, his gossipy heart immediately poured out like a flood, asking fervently, “Oh? Your Excellency actually has a lover, and there’s more than one! I’ve never heard you mention it before!”

Ye Yuan said huffily, “Don’t inquire about what you shouldn’t ask!”

The two people saw Leng Qiuling off with their eyes and arrived at a large hall in the middle of the town.

Entering the hall, inside the hall was very empty. There was only a person sitting lazily in front of a bed, drinking away from a wine flask.

“Heh, another Origin Deity Realm who came to seek death! Kid, give you an advice, the Heavenspan Mountain isn’t some fun place. Go back to where you came from!” That person said without even turning his head around.

This drunkard was in a state of drunkenness, but Ye Yuan could not fathom his limits.

“Many thanks for Senior’s advice. However, the Heavenspan Mountain, this junior must go!” Ye Yuan said firmly.

The drunkard said with a snicker, “Heh heh, reckless and foolish punk! But ... you’re late! The number of plates this year had already been fully issued before you came. If you want to enter the Heavenspan Mountain, wait another year.”

Ye Yuan was speechless. This was too unlucky, right?

He just missed the last train?

Ye Yuan did not give up and said with clasped hands, “Senior, can you make a little exception?”

His voice had yet to fade when two figures dashed out from no idea where, blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

The piercing cold killing intent made Ye Yuan’s brows furrow slightly.

“Hahaha, kid, what do you take my place to be? Go, go, go, still not going, I won’t be courteous.” The drunkard waved his hand as he drank.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and was just about to leave when suddenly, his expression changed.

“Heh heh, not meeting for several million years, you, this old drunkard, are putting on such a pompous front!”

Suddenly, a figure appeared in the hall.

What surprised Ye Yuan was that Dustless actually revealed his figure.

That drunkard’s expression changed. He put down the alcohol flask, staring fixedly at Dustless.

The drunkard said in a solemn voice, “You all leave. Without my instructions, you’re not allowed to come in!”

“Yes!” The two armored people answered him and directly vanished on the spot.

Ye Yuan also said, “Tianping, you go out first and take a walk.”

Ning Tianping was shocked inwardly, but he still answered and left the hall.

Clearing the venue, the drunkard suddenly stood up. Looking at Dustless with a look of disbelief, he said, “You ... You’re really Lord Dustless!”

Dustless smiled and said, “Who can it be if not me?”

“Hahaha ...” The drunkard suddenly lifted his head to the sky and laughed hard. Tears running down his old face, he said, “Heaven has eyes, Lord Dustless, you’re actually still alive!”

The old drunkard cried and laughed, appearing very crazy.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not help being shocked in his heart.

He did not expect that this old drunkard was actually Dustless’s old acquaintance.

Dustless looked at the old drunkard and also had a melancholic expression. Clearly, many memories were brought back.

After a bout of madness, the old drunkard hurriedly said, “Lord Dustless, please sit!”

Dustless was merely an illusionary figure, but the old drunkard was very respectful toward him.

Dustless was not polite either, sitting onto the bed.

Dustless looked at the old drunkard and he said with a smile, “Looks like these few years, you’ve been doing pretty well!”

The old drunkard smiled bitterly and said, “Lord Dustless, you’re mistaken. I hate that I failed to live up to expectations, that’s why I drown my sorrow in alcohol daily! These several million years, I’ve always cultivated bitterly, wanting to take revenge for Lord Immortal Grove. But ... I can’t even break through to the Empyrean Realm! These few years, I also took the time to go and find Lord Immortal Grove’s small world before. But he hid it too well, I couldn’t find it at all!”

Dustless sighed and said, “You had the heart! But you don’t need to go and find anymore, because ... Immortal Grove already has a successor.”

The old drunkard’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan in surprise.

For so many years, the old drunkard held down the fort at Southfoot Town. The geniuses he had seen before were too many to enumerate.

Ye Yuan was far too lacking compared to them.

The old drunkard said with a doubtful look, “It’s him? Lord Dustless, with all due respect, this kid looks very ordinary! He’s unable to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, and that’s why he came to the Heavenspan Mountain, right? Can’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm, how can he avenge Lord Immortal Grove?”

Dustless smiled and said, “The World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl both acknowledged him as their master, so it won’t be wrong! As for being unable to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, it’s not convenient for me to expound on the reason. But it’s absolutely not a problem of talent. You just have to know that his future accomplishments are far above Immortal Grove’s!”

The old drunkard was extremely surprised when he heard that. Ye Yuan looked plain and ordinary, without any special aspect.

However, Dustless’s appraisal of him was actually so high.

Lord Immortal Grove’s talent, the old drunkard was all too clear. A little fellow who could not even break through to the Divine Lord Realm could compare to him?

The old drunkard nodded and said, “Since he’s the person that Lord Dustless picked, I, an old drunkard, naturally have nothing to say. But Lord Dustless, you’re also aware, Origin Deity Realms going to the Heavenspan Mountain, there’s no return. This is no joke!”

Dustless smiled and said, “You old drunkard, how can this old man let him go and court death? You rest assured, he’ll be fine!”

The old drunkard sized Ye Yuan up with a curious look, wanting to see what was different from him.

But looking here and there, he could not perceive anything no matter what.
