Chapter 3054: Willing to Die!

“Yun Xiang, stop talking rubbish! Better think of how to get the treasures!” Next to her, an old man roared.

This old man was Melody Nether Heavenly Sect’s Hegemon Realm, Zhang Hexin.

These hidden Hegemon Realms all did not make a move previously. Actually, they were fearful of Heavenless.

But, these treasures in front of them were seriously too tempting. They still could not resist revealing their identities.

Yun Xiang’s gaze flickered, and she said, “The few of us change positions and try again!”

The other few people had solemn faces, nodding one after another.

Clearly, they approved of this plan.

The seven great Hegemons each adjusted their position.

Zhang Hexin said in a solemn voice, “Go!”

Seven figures flashed indeterminately, akin to wandering dragons; incomparably breathtaking.

However, they did not look cool for longer than three seconds.

It was only to hear the sound of explosions again. Those seven people were blasted flying out once more.

Being bombarded twice, the seven people all sustained considerable internal injuries.

In front of so many junior disciples, these big shots felt a loss of face.

However, with treasures in front, the Hegemons were naturally not willing to give up easily.

After resting, they attempted it five to six times in a row.

But each time, it ended badly.

“Heavenless this old man is really toying with us like monkeys! So many treasures, we can look but can’t eat!” Zhang Hexin said exasperatedly.

Kong Hai said with a cold smile, “Moron, weren’t you very smug just now?”

Zhang Hexin immediately retorted, “Your Father suffered a loss. Can it be that you can get it?”

The group of Hegemons seemed like eggplants hit by frost, wrinkled and mushy. The imposing momentum from before was all gone, making people find it funny.

Far away, Ye Yuan had been paying attention to these Hegemon Realms all along, revealing an expression of deep thought.

Over so many years, he had been studying this Heaven formation.

He discovered that this grand array was truly incomparably miraculous.

Those Hegemon Realms did not even know that they had gotten caught in the grand array.

But felt that Heavenless was creating difficulties to stop them and toy with them.

No wonder it could kill dozens of Hegemon Realm powerhouses back then!

Actually, Ye Yuan himself also could not tell what flaws this Heaven formation had.

Situated inside it, everything was perfectly natural.

If not for Mi Tian having told him before about some stories of the Labyrinth Divine Palace, he himself could not have seen through at all too.

But now, after the continuous probing of those Hegemon Realms, Ye Yuan finally saw through some clues.

This grand array was like the highest quality of art, without the slightest flaw.

It was like an incomparably precise machine, operating according to its own rules.

It could randomly change positions and produce attacks based on the Hegemons’ attacks.

But very clearly, the current Heaven formation did not activate killing formation mode. Otherwise, none of them could think about escaping.

Ye Yuan believed that this had something to do with Heavenless.

Heavenless did not kill people and also showed these treasures. What on earth was it for?

His goal was really hard to guess!

“Kid, come over!” Ye Yuan, who was currently contemplating, was interrupted.

Ye Yuan was stupefied, not knowing why Zhang Hexin suddenly became interested in him.

Meanwhile, the other Hegemons had gloating looks.

Zhang Hexin was currently frustrated with nowhere to vent. He naturally had to find an outlet to vent out.

Ye Yuan was the best candidate!

As humanity’s three supreme heavens, these Hegemon Realms were naturally unwilling to see Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven rise up.

However, regardless of whether it was Yang Qing or Ye Yuan, their potential was tremendous.

On this trip, Ye Yuan even brought out hundreds of origin powerhouses.

These 50 thousand people in front of him all had huge potential.

Without a doubt, Zhang Hexin was apprehensive! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Of course, it was not just him. Humanity’s five Hegemons were all apprehensive!

Ye Yuan got up, and the faces of Yang Qing and the rest changed, hurriedly stopping him.

“You can’t go over! I’ll go!” Yang Qing said in a deep voice.

“Don’t need to be so sentimental. You come too!” Zhang Hexin directly said.

With this, everyone was no longer calm.

“I’ll go!”

“I’ll go too!”

… …

Zhang Hexin clearly wanted to harm Ye Yuan. So how could they possibly watch Ye Yuan deliver himself to death without any emotion?

Even if he wanted to die, it was not Heavenly Saint Ye’s turn too!

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “No rush, see what he has to say first.”

Ye Yuan and Yang Qing, two people, came before Zhang Hexin. The latter snickered and said, “Kid, along the way, you were very capable!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s not that I’m capable. It’s that you all are too weak. Humanity’s three supreme heavens sound very domineering. But weren’t you still suppressed by the fiend race and feather race, these major races? If not for Yang Qing, humanity’s face would have long been utterly lost by you all!”

The other party was obviously looking for trouble. Ye Yuan naturally would not be polite.

As for Wang Ningyan, Lu Haoran, and the rest, their faces turned bright red.

These words slapped the face resoundingly.

But they could not deny it because this was an undeniable fact.

Actually, Ye Yuan already faintly guessed what Zhang Hexin wanted him to do.

It was nothing more than seeing that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had a lot of people, to let these people be cannon fodders and search for the restriction’s flaws.

“Courting death!” Sure enough, Zhang Hexin’s face turned black/ The overwhelming aura of a Hegemon Realm suddenly erupted. A palm smashed down toward Ye Yuan.

Everyone’s expressions changed wildly, crying out in alarm.

Feng Qingxuan’s pretty face turned deathly pale, pouncing over madly, wanting to block this palm on Ye Yuan’s behalf.

But very clearly, she was too slow.

However, Ye Yuan’s expression did not change, and his heart did not race. He just stood where he was, unmoving like a mountain.

“What courage!” Even if it was one of the human Hegemons, he could not help but praise too.

Boom!

A gust of palm wind howled past. Ye Yuan felt like his four limbs were going to fall apart.

The palm of a Hegemon Realm was too strong!

However, this palm forcefully stopped an inch in front of him.

Seeing that Ye Yuan was not frightened, Zhang Hexin was somewhat disappointed.

“Humph! Killing you like this is letting you off too cheaply! Boy, give you a chance. Go and blaze a trail yourself, or make those people find a path. As long as you can get the treasures, this seat can spare your life!” Zhang Hexin said with a strange laugh.

“Zhang Hexin, if you dare touch a hair of Ye Yuan’s, it’s sowing an irreconcilable enmity with my Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven!” Feng Qingxuan shouted fiercely.

Zhang Hexin chuckled and said, “Fire phoenix lass, are you scaring this seat? Your Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven is strong, but my humanity’s three heavens aren’t weak either! If we really fight, it’s hard to say who’ll win! At present, your Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven has suffered heavy casualties. My humanity’s three heavens really aren’t scared!”

Feng Qingxuan’s expression changed, suddenly feeling powerless.

Hegemon Realms were not so easy to scare.

They all had very powerful factions behind them!

“Heavenly Saint Ye, I’ll go!”

“I’m willing to go too!”

“I won’t hesitate to lay down my life for Heavenly Saint Ye!”

… …

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses actually all came forward on their own accord, requesting to scout a path.

Zhang Hexin could not help being stunned when he saw the situation. He did not expect that this boy actually had such great rallying power.

With this move, he wanted to drive a wedge between Ye Yuan and those people.

He felt that Ye Yuan would not go and scout a path himself and would only let those people go and die.

This way, the others would definitely bear a grudge against Ye Yuan.

But he did not expect that these people were actually willing to go and die for Ye Yuan!

Previously, when these people protected Ye Yuan, it was not to the extent of a life-and-death parting.

Furthermore, they needed help from Ye Yuan.

Zhang Hexin felt that this kind of relationship based on benefits was the most fragile.

He had used this move many times in his life. It proved to be effective every time.

But this time, he failed!
