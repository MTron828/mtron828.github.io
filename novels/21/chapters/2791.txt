Chapter 2797: What a Wrongful Death!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After enduring the first Three Calamity Dao Tribulation, Qian Kui knew that he could not bear it!

He completely could not take it at all!

The Three Calamity Dao Tribulation was too terrifying!

After one bolt, his three spiritual and seven physical souls were almost scattered entirely!

Therefore, he was going to drag Ye Yuan to die together! What right did this guy have to not die?

Bringing the terrifying Dao tribulation, Qian Kui pounced over frantically.

Sovereign Qian Kui’s Dao tribulation was Three Calamity Dao Tribulation!

Even if Ye Yuan was an exceedingly freakish monster, under Three Calamity Dao Tribulation, it would be certain death too.

Seeing this scene, a hint of delight flashed across the corners of the mouths of Hollowdark and the others.

Is this boy finally going to die?

Ought to be!

How many people did you drag down the water?!

Hollowdark the three of them were about to cry.

Why did they have to get involved in this messy situation? If he wanted to take the sea route, wouldn’t it have been fine to let him go?

Having a few generals die, having a few grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens die, what did it count for?

He was dead for sure now, damn it!

Sniff sniff... Dead for sure!

“Hahaha... Three Calamity Dao Tribulation, see if you still don’t die!”

Sovereign Qian Kui let out a wild laugh. This distance was merely an instant to him.

But, just as his body stepped into the region Ye Yuan was undergoing tribulation, a sudden turn of events happened.

Boom!

A bolt of incomparably thick electric snake fell with a loud bang.

This Dao tribulation was much stronger than previously!

Qian Kui did not even have time to let out a scream and directly turned into nothingness.

A True Sovereign Heaven was dead!

Although Sovereign Qian Kui died under the Dao tribulation, everyone felt that it was Ye Yuan who entrapped him to death.

After all, if not for Ye Yuan, it would also have been impossible for Sovereign Qian Kui’s Dao tribulation to have arrived now.

Everyone was dumbstruck with amazement!

What happened?

“F-Five calamity! Five Calamity Dao Tribulation! It became a Five Calamity Dao Tribulation!” Hollowdark cried out strangely.

When transcending tribulation, how many tribulation it was, was how many it was. It was never heard of that the number of tribulations could still increase!

Really broadened horizons!

“Who else?” Ye Yuan laughed coldly and looked at Hollowdark as he said.

Hollowdark’s neck shrank, and he immediately withered up.

Holy hell, what was going on?

Ye Yuan secretly scolded stupid. He was a divergent cultivator. Furthermore, he was an extremely monstrous divergent cultivator.

You used your Dao tribulation to smite me?

Even if you were willing, was heaven willing?

You were fucking fighting heaven for its job, wasn’t this courting death?

Finished saying, Ye Yuan raised his sword to the sky, meeting the Dao tribulation again; incomparably fierce.

However, in the next second, he was slammed into the sea again mercilessly.

However, Ye Yuan did not mind!

Only by experiencing the baptism of Dao tribulation could he become stronger!

All around, miserable cries lingered on incessantly.

In the lightning prison, the Dao tribulation was too strong!

This was heaven’s wrath!

Under heaven’s wrath, who could survive?

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Bolts of Dao tribulation fell, the Saint Sovereign Heavens who died became more and more.

Originally, there were hundreds of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses in this sea.

In a blink, there were only a scanty 30 people remaining.

The auras of the three great True Sovereign Heavens became weaker and weaker.

Finally, Sardine could not hold on anymore and was killed by the Dao tribulation that landed!

The power of Three Calamity Dao Tribulation was too terrifying!

Two of the four great True Sovereign Heavens were gone!

“ARGGHH! Damn it! Ye Yuan, I’m going to die! Hurry up and come save me! No, you’d better not come. Once you come, I’ll die even faster!” Yang Qing’s body was covered in injuries, but he was full of energy.

This guy was really stubborn enough.

Ye Yuan also had no choice but to admire this guy’s strength.

He himself was also unbelievably weak right now.

But his Dao sword grew stronger and stronger!

The stronger the Dao tribulation, the greater the benefits that he got!

Very soon, Tian Hui could not hold on either and was smote to death by the Dao tribulation.

Four great True Sovereign Heavens, there was only Hollowdark alone left.

However, he was also at death’s door and almost kicking the bucket.

“ARGH! I hate it! Ye Yuan, this sovereign is cursing you to be torn to shreds by Heavenly Dao!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Carrying strong unwillingness, Hollowdark also passed on.

The masters of four great sea regions all perished in less than two hours!

No idea how long had passed. Everything returned to tranquility.

Above the sea, it was calm and tranquil, as if nothing had happened, except for the massive corpses floating on the sea.

Everything seemed to be a dreadful sight to behold.

With a Dao tribulation, the powerhouses of four great sea regions practically all dwindled to zero!

Whalebillow looked toward that weak to the extreme young figure as if looking at a devil.

Yes, Whalebillow did not die!

He actually pulled through! He himself did not dare to believe it either!

What he overcame was the same as Yang Qing, five-nine Dao tribulation!

He actually did not die!

As if feeling Whalebillow’s gaze, Ye Yuan grinned and said weakly, “What are you looking at? Shouldn’t you be thanking me now? After this tribulation, you’ll probably be these four great sea regions’ new master!”

Whalebillow was speechless.

What Ye Yuan said was right. He was very weak now.

But he could feel that his body was brimming with vigorous vitality and was currently growing like crazy.

This Dao tribulation let him pry into the door of a new world!

The True Sovereign Heaven gate was originally difficult to open. But because of this incident, it revealed the tiniest gap to him.

General level powerhouses were elites among elites of the sea race to begin with, their talents being extremely strong.

This Dao tribulation was destruction and also new life!

He was the only war general who survived!

Apart from him, there were also three Saint Sovereign Heavens.

Several hundred Saint Sovereign Heavens, only the four of them survived!

But, experiencing this Dao tribulation was a baptism to them.

Their future road would be even broader!

“You ... You’re not killing me?” Whalebillow said fearfully.

This was not instinctive fear, but that he saw that Ye Yuan freaking swallowed another heavenly pill!

In this short while, Ye Yuan quickly recovered!

F*ck!

“We don’t have a life-or-death feud either. Kill you for what? I originally didn’t want to kill people. It was you all who forced the situation to become what it is now one step at a time. If we really want to say it out, the culprit behind this situation is you!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Whalebillow stared dumbfoundedly.

Yeah!

A frenzied pursuit that lasted close to a month, chasing until everyone in the four great sea regions was in an uproar, and even four great True Sovereign Heavens moved out.

But, tracing back to the source, the cause was merely a bit of face!

Qian Kui Sea Region’s face!

His, Whalebillow’s, face!

Later, Whalebillow naturally knew that Ye Yuan had shown mercy previously.

But, at that time, he could not pull back anymore.

In the end, this was like a vortex, getting bigger as it spun.

In the end, even True Sovereign Heavens were swept in.

Then ... everyone died!

The four great True Sovereign Heavens died so unjustly!

It was just that before this, who could have thought that chasing down a measly little lower Saint Sovereign Heaven could cause such terrifying consequences?

“F*ck, stop chatting, I... I’m dying! Ye Yuan, h-hurry up and save me!” Yang Qing said weakly.

The current Yang Qing was incomparably miserable.

His lower body was directly blown away.

The two arms only had one upper arm left, becoming a human stick.

His entire person was weak to the extreme.

However, this guy actually advanced!

This guy broke through to half-step True Sovereign Heaven!

Ye Yuan threw a heavenly pill to him. This guy’s severed limbs were growing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

When Whalebillow saw this scene, he was envious to the extreme.

This heavenly pill was really freaking awesome!

Meanwhile, he would probably have to recuperate for a few years before he could recover to his peak.

Ye Yuan brought Yang Qing away. Whalebillow looked at the two people’s disappearing backs, his gaze flickering as he said, “In the future, when humans pass through our sea region, we absolutely mustn’t provoke them!”

“Yes!” The other three Saint Sovereign Heavens replied immediately.

At this time, Whalebillow was the supreme ruler of the four great sea regions!

Ye Yuan did not know that he blazed a sea route for those who set out to sea.
