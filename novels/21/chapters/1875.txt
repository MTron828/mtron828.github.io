Chapter 1879: Eradicate Him for Me!

The group of powerhouses all had slightly fearful expressions. This Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace’s restrictions were too powerful.

Qiao Yuan’s face changed. He then pointed at another True God powerhouse and said, “You go!”

But this time, he pointed at Yang Yidao.

The moment Yang Yidao heard, his face immediately turned pale and he stammered, “L-Lord Empyrean, haven’t we already tested it?”

Qiao Yuan snickered and said, “Not testing more, how will this Empyrean know where the weak point of this restriction is?”

One sentence and everyone felt imperiled.

Ji Kang, Zuo Pan, and the rest of the True God Realm top powerhouses, all had very ugly faces.

The fox mourning the death of a rabbit was pretty much like this.

Yang Yidao was aware that there was no chance to be spared. Suddenly, he knelt in front of Ye Yuan with a flash.

He understood that at this time, there was only Ye Yuan who could save him.

“L-Little Brother Ye Yuan, I-I beg you, save me!”

Ye Yuan was also rendered dumbfounded by this sudden change. An exalted Ninth Firmament True God powerhouse actually knelt in front of him?

When the other True God powerhouses saw this scene, they could not help giving rise to the feeling of the fox mourning the death of a rabbit.

At this time, the Celestial Deity Realm martial artists whose numbers were not many felt very safe instead. Because even if they went, they could not probe anything out at all.

When Qiao Yuan saw this scene, he immediately laughed.

“Huhu, if you’d long known that it would be this way, why behave like that back then? He obtained an empyrean spirit treasure based on his own ability, you guys insisted on abusing your power to bully people. Now, you’re in a crisis and turned around to beg him. Is it that you guys will sell him again after this round? Ye Yuan brat, let me remind you, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean can’t stay for more than a few days here.”

Qiao Yuan had a smile on his face, seemingly not worried at all that Ye Yuan would help Yang Yidao.

Along the way, they concealed their strength, taking Ye Yuan’s conflict with these people into their sights.

At this time, Yang Yidao’s intestines were green with regret.

Smack!

Smack!

Smack!

Yang Yidao slapped himself ruthlessly and cried bitterly, “Ye Yuan, I made a huge mistake! It was all my fault! I shouldn’t have been blinded by obsession and covet your empyrean spirit treasure! But ... But in the end, we’re all humans, are you going to passively watch everyone die in the hands of the fiend race?”

“Yeah! Ye Yuan, at this time, we should be bound by a common hatred for the enemy and deal with the fiend race together first!”

“Everyone is human compatriots, you can’t stand by and watch us die!”

...

The moment they heard Yang Yidao’s words, these True God powerhouses all voiced their vocal support, wanting to hold Ye Yuan ransom to ethical principles.

Ye Yuan was originally somewhat stirred, but when Yang Yidao said until the second half of his sentence, Ye Yuan became enraged.

“Enough!”

Ye Yuan gave a furious roar, interrupting their words.

Everyone’s faces changed, they all saw through that Ye Yuan was angered.

“Yang Yidao, if you’re scared of death yourself, then be scared of death yourself. Deliberately dragging everyone in, are you bullying me for being soft-hearted? Or is it that you feel that I’m young, easy to hoodwink?” Ye Yuan looked at Yang Yidao and said with a cold smile.

Yang Yidao’s face was ashen. He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so sharp.

His bit of trick was seen through by Ye Yuan.

He was secretly shocked. How could a thousand over years old little fellow have such profound cunningness?

He, this old monster who had lived for a million years, could not play any tricks.

“Also, you guys! Know that you’re humans now? Know that there are compatriots now and want to fight the enemy with a common hatred? What the hell have you been doing? When the two of them were dealing with me inside the cavern, did one of you come forward? Previously, when Ji Kang they all were taking advantage of their power to bull people, did any one of you step forward to step up for me? Now, know how to be scared?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching, sweeping over each person’s face.

The places it passed through, those True God powerhouses all lowered their heads.

Ye Yuan sneered inwardly. These people posed as people of high morals but were self-centered.

Saying whatever human race’s righteousness was merely holding you ransom to ethical principles.

What Qiao Yuan said was right, even if he helped these people pass this hurdle, once Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean disappeared, they would recover to their original faces very quickly.

“Hahaha! Boy, I really underestimated you. Looks like you see things even more thoroughly than I do!” Qiao Yuan laughed loudly and said.

Ye Yuan suddenly reined in his expression and said coolly, “I know that there are definitely Empyrean powerhouses among the humans too. But ... I really admire your tolerance, to actually be able to endure until now. Huhu, thinking of sitting things out and reaping the spoils later?”

Ye Yuan’s words made Qiao Yuan’s face change.

They naturally also suspected that the humans had Empyrean powerhouses around too. But even the Seven-Colored Aegirine appeared and the human Empyreans did not show face. They thought that there were none.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually suspected that the humans had Empyreans too.

Ye Yuan swept his glance over and said with a faint smile, “All not making a sound huh? All treating me as a sucker, making me fight to the death with the fiend race Empyreans, is it? Sorry, you guys want to dodge, but I won’t let you do as you wish! Senior Wild Blade, give them a chop, force out our Lord Empyreans for me!”

The moment Qiao Yuan heard, he could not help laughing loudly and said, “Hahaha! Boy, you’re indeed ruthless enough! A great character!”

But the faces of Ji Kang and the rest changed and said, “Ye Yuan, you ... what do you want to do?”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Don’t blame me, want to blame, blame the Lord Empyreans! Senior, do it!’

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean nodded slightly, evil ghostly power suddenly erupting. Those human powerhouses were all ashen

In front of Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean, they did not have the strength to retaliate at all. There was no difference from lambs awaiting slaughter.

The blade rising, the terrifying aura raged.

Whoosh ...

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean did not hesitate in the slightest and really chopped a blade over.

The faces of the human powerhouses all abruptly changed, they finally knew that Ye Yuan was not joking with them.

But right at this time, two powerful auras suddenly erupted, meeting this blade.

Bang!

The blade momentum dissipated, everything returned to tranquility.

Two auras that were not weaker than the fiend race Empyreans appeared in the midst of the human camp.

The faces of the powerhouses around them suddenly changed, backing away one after another. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ji Kang’s pupils constricted, looking at one of the figures and exclaimed, “Lord Zhao Min, you ... you’re here too!”

Zhao Min looked at Ji Kang and said with a cold snort, “Humph! Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital’s face is totally lost by you all!”

Ji Kang had a look of embarrassment. Being suppressed by a Celestial Deity Realm boy along the way, this was simply a great stinging insult in his life.

But he had no choice!

Putting aside that he had peak True God strength, he even had an Empyrean powerhouse protecting!

The other Empyrean powerhouse said, “Heh heh, Zhao Min, you might not fare better than how Ji Kang did too. This boy isn’t simple!”

“Enough crap! Du Hong, this is my Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital’s affair. It has nothing to do with you!”Zhao Min said unhappily.

Finished talking, Zhao Min looked at Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “Boy, you’re very gutsy, to actually dare oppose my Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital! The consequence isn’t what you can bear!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and suddenly grinned and said, “Are you threatening me? Senior Wild Blade, eradicate him for me!”
