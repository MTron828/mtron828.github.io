Chapter 2571: Jade Face Swordsman!

“B-Big Brother, you’re really too incredible! What on earth is this Windward Topple? Why is it so powerful?” Tang Yu raised a big thumbs up to Ye Yuan.

Looking at the seemingly dead bodies all over the floor, Tang Yu had some lingering fear in his heart.

The scene previously was really too deeply entrenched in the hearts of people.

Ye Yuan scattered a handful of powder just like that and put down several hundred powerhouses.

Even a powerhouse like Zhao Kun actually could not resist it either.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Windward Topple is a kind of powerful anesthetic. It won’t scatter when the wind blows and won’t become disorderly with a palm strike. But one will topple upon contact! Unless you prepare the antidote in advance, otherwise, it’s incurable under Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!”

When Tang Yu heard, he could not help being tongue-tied.

This thing was also too freakish!

“But you paralyzed them. How will this mess be cleaned up! If the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect knows, they will definitely destroy Eastward Country!” Tang Yu said with a frown.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I have my own ways.”

As he said, Ye Yuan took out a small bottle again and waved it under the noses of Zhao Kun and co.

Roughly an hour later, Zhao Kun slowly recovered, and his twitching also became sporadic.

But, the occasional twitch still made people simmer with laughter.

“P-Punk, you …?ugh?… dare to make a move against me …?ugh,?you’re dead for sure!” Zhao Kun threatened Ye Yuan as he twitched.

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s disciples were rampant because their sect was strong.

Just with Jun Tian dying, the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was indifferent about it.

But Zhao Kun dying was different!

Zhao Kun was one of the inner-sect’s top ten disciples with a promising future.

If he died in Eastward Country, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect would definitely send down its wrath.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “A captive, can you stop posturing to me or not??Oh,?forgot to tell you. What I let you smell earlier was called Seven-Seven Soul Recall. This poison, I believe that with Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao’s extensive knowledge and wide experiences, you should have heard of it before, right?”

Hearing this name, Zhao Kun could not resist twitching.

This time, he was frightened into twitching.

Seven-Seven Soul Recall was unbelievably vicious.

Once the poison erupted, one would be forcibly tormented for seven by seven, 49 days, before they kicked the bucket.

In these 49 days, each day would be more miserable than the last. Ordinary people could not endure until the tenth day at all and would commit suicide.

And this poison was precisely another specialty poison of the number one Jade Sovereign Heaven, Zhong Jianchou!

Of course, these poisons were all poisons before he became famous.

After he broke through to Jade Sovereign Heaven, he no longer used these low-level poisons.

However, using it to deal with him, Zhao Kun, was enough!

“You … What do you want!” Zhao Kun said in fear.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I don’t want anything. I’m just planning on going to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect together with you guys!”

Zhao Kun’s pupils constricted and he said in surprise, “You want to go to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect?”

Not just Zhao Kun, Tang Yu and the rest had surprised faces too.

“Big Brother, what are you going to the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect for? Jadetrue Heavenly Sect discriminates against ascenders the most! If you go, wouldn’t it be walking right into a trap?” Tang Yu said in surprise.

Ye Yuan said, “I naturally have my own reasons for going to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect. Brother, all good things must come to an end, let’s split up here!”

Although he knew that Ye Yuan would leave sooner or later, when this day really came, Tang Yu still felt very reluctant.

From having an arm chopped off by Ye Yuan, to becoming Ye Yuan’s hardcore follower now.

His admiration toward Ye Yuan could no longer be described using words long ago.

“Big Brother, I …” Tang Yu choked.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need to worry. Although the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect is averse to ascenders, they probably crave talents like a thirsty person craves for water too. Coupled with the strong recommendation of an inner-sect top ten disciple, I presume that entering the sect shouldn’t be hard. Isn’t that right, Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao?”

Zhao Kun’s expression flickered indeterminately and even twitched from time to time. But in the end, he could only nod too.

No choice, being under people’s roof, there was no choice but to lower one’s head!

Furthermore, what Ye Yuan said was right, heavenly alchemists were very scarce in Jadetrue Heavenly Sect too.

With Ye Yuan’s alchemy path strength, he could naturally gain a firm foothold after he went.

Just like that, Ye Yuan reverse-detained Zhao Kun four people, and set off for Jadetrue Heavenly Sect

As for Lin Lan, Ye Yuan had him stay in Eastward Country for the time being.

He, an ascender, bringing a disciple into the sect, would be seriously conspicuous.

Zhao Kun four people were depressed!

They came to capture people. In the end, they became other people’s captives now! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In Eastward Country, Ye Yuan rescued Second Prince and sentenced Eldest Prince to death.

The struggle for the throne finally fell under ownership too.

After settling everything, Ye Yuan detained the four people and headed to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

… …

Ye Yuan was going to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect firstly, in order to look for the Heavenspan Mountain’s secret. Secondly, he also wanted to find a way to save Mu Lingxue.

This kind of major sect with a deep foundation had many miraculous means.

Perhaps they had the method to condense the divine soul?

Of course, going to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect had some risk too.

If the sect was hostile towards ascenders, he also had the possibility of delivering himself into the tiger’s maws.

However, with Zhao Kun this bargaining chip around, Ye Yuan felt that the likelihood was not high.

Ye Yuan was confident that with his alchemy path strength, he would be able to gain a firm foothold in Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

As for Jun Tian this trouble, it was actually not considered troublesome at all.

Just say that Jun Tian encountered a grade two true spirit in Inklight Forest and it would be done.

An outer-sect deacon’s life and death, the sect definitely thought nothing of it.

As for Ye Yuan, that was just a misunderstanding!

Obtaining a transcendent heavenly alchemist and losing an insignificant outer-sect deacon.

Weighing which was more important, he believed that the lords in the sect could gauge whether to advance or retreat.

Going to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect this time, it needed several years of trekking, and passing through more than ten major countries midway.

These countries were all under the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s rule.

A month later, the party left Eastward Country’s borders and arrived in the Ancient Dawn Country’s borders.

In front of them was a stretch of desolate land.

“Ye Yuan, you used poison to control us. Aren’t you afraid of the sect’s elders discovering it?” Zhao Kun said in a solemn voice.

He was arrogant at heart and haughty in manner. So how could he be willing to be controlled by Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re also looking down on the number one Jade Sovereign Heaven’s poison arts too much! The reason why I chose the Seven-Seven Soul Recall poison is naturally that it isn’t easy to be figured out! As long as you all take my medicine on time, even if a grade three heavenly alchemist is here, they also won’t discover that you all are poisoned! This is unless Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses inspect you guys personally! Except, is there that possibility?”

Zhao Kun’s expression changed, feeling despair in his heart.

Thinking of how he had to live under Ye Yuan’s despotic power every day from now on, he was practically going insane!

But what could going crazy do?

Originally, he thought that he could make a big killing this time.

Who would have expected that he actually buried himself alive in the end!

Thinking up to here, his wrath knew no bounds and a foot kicked onto Cheng Chongshan’s body, kicking him flying.

“It’s all you, this pig! If not for you, how could I be controlled by others!” Zhao Kun bellowed.

Along the way, it was already not the first time that such a thing happened.

Cheng Chongshan crawled up and said with a cold smile, “If I’m a pig, aren’t you one too? A dignified inner-sect’s disciple that ranked among the top ten actually got taken down by someone without even knowing it!”

When Zhao Kun heard that, he said in a great rage, “F*cking hell, Your Father will kill you!”

Suddenly, his figure stopped.

Because he discovered that a white-robed swordsman was currently walking over with his hands behind his back!

His gaze turned intent, and he cried out in surprise, “A-Ascender! A Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum ascender! You … You’re Jade Face Swordsman, Luo Yunqing!”
