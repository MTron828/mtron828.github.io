Chapter 99: Essence Energy Vortex!

Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessor

Inside the pavilion opposite the Nine Heavens Peak, Su Yubai stood up and patted the dust off his body.

"Nothing to see anymore. Let’s go. It’s hopeless for Ye Yuan. I even thought that he had some reliance, to dare tackle the Nine Heavens Road. In the end, he only crossed five steps in the second stage and was done."

"I don’t want to watch anymore either. Waste of time!"

"Time to go, time to go. After such a long time, turns out it’s a farce. I still thought that there was some show to watch. After messing around for the greater part of a day, he’s still the same as the rest."

Su Yubai walked off, and the other elders naturally lost interest and stood up one after another.

They watched Ye Yuan stand there unmoved for four hours, and were actually bored out of their minds already.

Now that they were assured Ye Yuan would not wake up, they naturally felt that there was no longer the need to watch on.

Su Yubai circled past the stone table and led the crowd out of the pavilion.

After just a few steps, there was suddenly a commotion coming from the students at the foot of the mountain.

"Quick, look! Ye Yuan moved!"

"En? He’s actually meditating on the spot? What’s he trying to do?"

"He’s not thinking about cultivating on the spot, right? Or has he already run amok?"

"Does running amok look like that? Doesn’t seem so? Looking at this appearance, it seems more like cultivating. But what’s the use of doing something like embracing Buddha’s feet at his hour of need?"

"Ye Yuan always exceeds expectations when doing things. I really don’t know what he’s trying to do. But looking at his appearance, he should have just escaped from inside the illusionary realm. But he only walked five steps. How is he going to cross the remaining steps at the back?"

Ye Yuan’s actions finally let the frustrated crowd find a topic of conversation once again. All manners of speculations spread out among the crowd.

The three people, Huyan Yong, Feng Ruoqing, and Feng Zhirou, who were initially already in despair, finally let out a sigh of relief right now.

"This rascal really scared me to death. I even thought that he won’t ever wake up anymore!" Huyan Yong exclaimed and wiped away his cold sweat.

Feng Ruoqing, on the other hand, continued to watch Ye Yuan silently, as if she had discovered something.

"What is it, Teacher Feng? Is something wrong?" Huyan Yong asked curiously.

"Teacher Huyan, do you feel that Ye Yuan’s aura isn’t quite right?"

"Mm?" Huyan Yong felt Ye Yuan’s aura, and sure enough, he felt that something was amiss. "This rascal, why is the aura of his body becoming increasingly weaker? Could some problem have occurred?"

Feng Ruoqing shook her head. Clearly, she also could not make clear of the situation.

However, their perceptions were locked onto Ye Yuan. But they discovered that Ye Yuan’s aura became increasingly weaker, progressively weaker until in the end, it actually directly vanished!

The three people were completely stunned.

"Mm? His aura vanished? Could it be that he’s already dead?" Su Yubai had clearly also discovered Ye Yuan’s transformation.

Elder Lin suddenly opened his mouth and asked, "Elder Su, that Ye Yuan’s aura has already completely vanished. Did he already die on the Nine Heavens Road?"

With Elder Lin’s words, Su Yubai became even more certain about his idea.

Quashing the wild elation in his heart, Su Yubai nodded and said, "Although the situation is somewhat bizarre, his aura has indeed completely vanished. Looks like he’s really dead already."

"Snort! Slighting the Elders Council! This outcome was deserved! Leaving a whole corpse can be counted as letting him off lightly!" Elder Lin derided coldly.

"Haha. Dean Hu already said that this was a student’s right. Since he chose this way of dying, and he’s already dead now, it also counts as us Elders Council enforcing the academy’s rules."

Su Yubai current mood was evidently excellent and turned around to console Elder Lin instead.

Although the process was a little winded, Ye Yuan finally still died. He had finally helped the Su Family to eliminate this hidden danger.

Inside the pavilion, Hu Changsheng looked at Ye Yuan’s ’corpse,’ gave a long sigh, and also got up to prepare to leave. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Majority of the Heaven rank students with higher cultivation also discovered Ye Yuan’s abnormal condition. After feeling sorry for him, they involuntarily secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

One Long Tang already crushed them until they could not breathe. With the addition of an even more monstrous Ye Yuan, their life in the future would be even worse off.

"Didn’t expect it; I really didn’t expect it. Ye Yuan actually died on the fifth step! Oh, Old Long, no matter how monstrous Ye Yuan was, he’s already a has been. You also saw the terror of the Nine Heavens Road. Are you still going to challenge the Nine Heavens Road?" Zuo Bugui said to Long Tang.

Long Tang narrowed his eyes. Clearly, he did not really believe the truth in front of him.

Ye Yuan charged through the first stage so smoothly, how could he possibly fall at the fifth step in the second stage?

This was too absurd!

Hearing Zuo Bugui’s words, Long Tang nodded and said, "Even if the Nine Heavens Road were a mountain of knives or a flaming sea, a dragon’s lair or a tiger’s den, I would still challenge it! Either I succeed or I perish!"

"You’re seriously stubborn! Forget it. I know that you’re proud and arrogant. I won’t be able to persuade you. Since you’re giving me your rank of the first place with both hands, I’ll kindly accept it!"

"First place? What the point of first place in the Dan Wu Academy? If you like it so much, then take it," Long Tang said nonchalantly.

"Sigh. You’ve really been ’poisoned deeply’! He’s already dead. Are you still going to keep watching?"

"Watch a while more. I keep feeling that Ye Yuan won’t die so easily!"

"Since when did you become like this, Old Long? He’s clearly already . . . Mm? What’s going on?"

While the two were talking, they suddenly felt some irregular movements happening to the surrounding essence energy.

The students at the foot of the mountain already started preparing to leave when suddenly, a wild wind whistled past, and the essence energy around them started becoming thinner.

"What’s happening?"

"The Nine Heavens Peak is a land with extremely abundant essence energy. How come now the energy became so thin? Could it be that someone is breaking through?"

"It’s Ye Yuan! Ye Yuan is breaking through!"

Somebody shouted from within the crowd, drawing everyone’s eyes toward Ye Yuan once again.

It was only to see that the essence energy in the vicinity of the Nine Heavens Peak surged towards Ye Yuan frenziedly at this moment!

With Ye Yuan as the center, it formed a storm of enormous essence energy! An essence energy vortex!

Ye Yuan’s aura also swiftly grew stronger!

Huyan Yong and Feng Ruoqing exchanged glances and saw the astonishment in the other party’s eyes.

"This is . . . Heart Like Still Water! Ye Yuan, he . . . actually reached the Heart Like Still Water Realm! This is simply inconceivable! Even among Crystal Formation Realms, there were only extremely few people who actually reached such level in terms of heart realm. This is a realm from the legends! Ye Yuan is only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, so how did he do it?" Huyan Yong sucked in a cold breath.

Feng Ruoqing’s eyes flashed. Clearly, she was also in the midst of shock. "Pretty soon, it’s not going to be Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm anymore. He’s about to break through right now!"

"This punk is seriously too shocking! He only just broke through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm a few days back, and now, he’s actually going to cross a minor stage again and directly reach the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm! Truly terrifying!" Huyan Yong was astounded.

But seeing how Ye Yuan was so peerlessly talented, he also felt quite pleased in his heart. No matter what, Ye Yuan’s relationship with the academy was sowed.

He also felt extremely proud for such a genius to walk out of the State of Qin’s Dan Wu Academy.

Feng Ruoqing took a deep breath and questioned, "Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm? Look at this amount of essence energy, Teacher Huyan; is it only the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm?"
