Chapter 2718: Six Great Saint Sovereign Heavens!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“All using this sort of eyes to look at me for? Did you all think that I died inside?”

Ye Yuan looked at the few people’s expressions. How could he still not know what they were thinking?

“N-Not at all!?Huhu,?with Master Ye’s methods, how can you possibly suffer Heavenly Dao backlash and die?” Wild Lion King replied awkwardly.

Ye Yuan flicked his sleeves, several streaks of light shot toward Bright Tiger six people respectively.

The six people were startled and hurriedly reached out to catch it.

Then, they held it carefully in their palm, as if holding a snowflake in their hands, afraid of it melting.

The six great true spirits looked at Ye Yuan resentfully.

As if saying: this was the hope leading to Saint Sovereign heaven, you’re actually being too casual!

At the same time, feeling the surging power of Great Dao coming from the heavenly pill in their hand, they were extremely moved.

These grade four heavenly imperial pills were really refined by Ye Yuan!

Furthermore, they were of true grade!

“Actually, I finished refining it half a month ago. But in the past half month, I had another important matter, that’s why I was delayed in leaving seclusion. I said before, to promise you all to definitely complete it. I naturally won’t go back on my word,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

When the few people heard, they all had bitter smiles on their faces.

Since you already finished, why didn’t you leave seclusion earlier?

Although we’re half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, our little hearts were almost frightened to death by you too!

But the few people all put away the heavenly pill carefully, planning to go back and enter closed-seclusion.

“Hahaha,?as expected of my good brother! Ye Yuan, you didn’t disappoint this exalt!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I said before, this younger brother still has some confidence in the path of alchemy. Although 50 years is a little tight, since I dared to promise, I naturally more or less had some confidence. I wonder if Big Brother’s heavenly medicines are prepared?”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon said, “No rush, no rush! You’ve worked hard these few years! Rest well for a period of time first before refining. This old man can still afford to wait for this bit of time.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I’ll accept deferentially rather than to decline courteously!”

… …

On this day, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled; a magnificent and mighty panorama.

A bright-colored enormous tiger soared into the sky. The entire Myriad Demons Mountain could see it clearly.

For some time, the entire Myriad Demons Mountain was in a stir.

“That is Bright Tiger King! A phenomenon descending from heaven, he broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

“Our Myriad Demons Mountain has not seen a Saint Sovereign Heaven appear for tens of thousands of years already! His breakthrough is really the Myriad Demons Mountain’s great prosperous age!”

“With this, a new Saint Exalt has appeared! The Myriad Demons Mountain is going to experience a reshuffle!”

… …

A Saint Sovereign Heaven coming into being, this was a flourishing age for the entire Rainclear Continent.

It had a huge impact on the Myriad Demons Mountain!

All forces would be reshuffling.

Several days later, the phenomenon dissipated.

Everyone knew that the new Saint Exalt Bright Tiger had been born!

However, it exceeded everyone’s expectations.

On the second day after Bright Tiger corroborated his Dao, a phenomenon appeared again!

A large yellow bull soared to the sky and mooed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The entire Myriad Demons Mountain was shocked once again!

“This … This seems to be Commander Big Yellow under Saint Exalt Bull Demon, right? He actually broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven too?”

“Too crazy! In just a few short days, two great Saint Exalts actually appeared!”

“This is also too coincidental. How could they break through at the same time?”

… …

Ordinary true spirits naturally did not know about the matters between the upper echelon.

So the impact of two great powerhouses breaking through at the same time was too fantastical to them.

For several tens of thousands of years, there was not even one Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But within a few short days, two actually broke through at the same time!

However, this was merely the beginning!

Big Yellow’s breakthrough was not over yet when another phenomenon rose to the sky once more on Myriad Demons Mountain!

This time, it was a giant elephant!

Myriad beasts seethed with excitement!

“The third Saint Sovereign Heaven! Freaking hell, what on earth is going on? Could it be that the celestial phenomena suddenly changed drastically, we all have a chance to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

“The heavens changed! The heavens have really changed!”

“Myriad Demons Mountain has been quiet for too long. This time, it will probably be entering an era of heroes vying for supremacy!”

… …

Myriad Elephant King’s breakthrough completely ignited the Myriad Demons Mountain.

They were completely unable to understand why such an inconceivable thing would happen.

Saint Sovereign Heaven, that was a god-like existence, that was an invincible existence.

How many powerful true spirits had this step stumped?

But now, it actually became so worthless!

A day later, two phenomenons rose to the sky again.

This time, everyone was numb.

Saint Sovereign Heaven really became cabbages!

All the way until two days later, when the last phenomenon appeared, people had already become accustomed to it and it could no longer stir up the slightest wave.

In less than ten days from start to end, six great Saint Sovereign Heavens broke through at the same time.

The phenomenon in the sky was like a firework show that never went out; incomparably gorgeous.

This spectacular scene was hard for many true spirits to see once all their lives.

In the depths of the Myriad Demons Mountain, a shadow cut through the sky and fell on the mountain.

What appeared was actually a large bird.

An old ape leaning on a walking stick with one hand behind its back slowly walked in front of that shadow.

That shadow said, “Old Ape, what the hell is going on? When did Saint Sovereign Heaven become so worthless?”

The old ape looked at the enormous projections above the sky, his gaze deep as he said, “Saint Sovereign Heaven is the realm of prying into heaven. It’s incomparably difficult! Among a thousand half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens, it’s hard for one to be able to break through too. This kind of phenomenon isn’t normal!”

The large bird snorted coldly and said, “Nonsense! Does this exalt not know that it isn’t normal? I came to find you to ask whether or not you know what happened!”

The old ape glanced at him and said coolly, “That stupid bull found a treasure!”

The large bird was stunned and said baffledly, “Found a treasure? You mean …”

The old ape had an expression like he was looking at a fool and said coolly, “Idiot! What treasure can let six true spirits break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven at the same time? I’m saying, that dumb bull came under the patronage of a big shot! There must be an unfathomable guy by his side!”

The large bird trembled all over and said, “Unfathomable guy! What kind of unfathomable guy can create six great Saint Sovereign Heavens at the same time? Could it … Could it be …”

He suddenly thought of something and became incomparably excited.

Because that answer let him see hope too!

He and the old ape were both already on the brink of life and death.

The fourth Saint Sovereign Heaven Dao Tribulation that could come at any time, they would not be able to tide over no matter what!

The old ape drew a deep breath and said with a nod, “That’s right, grade five heavenly alchemist! I didn’t expect that a grade five heavenly alchemist would actually appear on this Rainclear Continent!”

The large bird stomped its feet, radiating brilliant light as it said, “This stupid cow actually concealed so deeply! No way! We can’t resign ourselves to doom! If a grade five heavenly alchemist appeared, then we’ll have hope of tiding over the fourth Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation! What are you still waiting for, old thing?”

The old ape shot the large bird a fierce glare and said with a cold snort, “How can this level of existence be slighted like this? We can’t make a move without being fully prepared! Just wait, the news will come very quickly!”
