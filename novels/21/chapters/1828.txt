Chapter 1832 - Time Law

1832 Time Law

Perhaps it was a coincidence, or maybe the Shadowmoon Sect’s numbers were too few.

Halfway through the competition, Yang Shen did not meet a single Shadowmoon Sect disciple.

However, there was no hiding in the end.

In the 28th round, Yang Shen matched up with Yi Qingxiang.

Currently, more than half a year’s time already passed since the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave started.

Yang Shen came in front of Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “I’ve waited half a year for today! Today, I’ll let you have a taste of your fellow apprentice dying in front of you!”

Finished talking, he turned to Yi Qingxiang again and said, “Last time, I let you escaped a disaster. This time, you won’t be so lucky! Want to blame, blame Ye Yuan that he shouldn’t have provoked my High Clarity Sect!”

But Yi Qingxiang laughed when he heard that and said, “I’ve long said before, my Shadowmoon Sect’s dignity is likewise not to be trampled on! I can die, but the Shadowmoon Sect’s face can’t be lost! Of course, the prerequisite is that if you can kill me.”

Yang Shen’s face fell, he discovered that he could not gain any verbal advantage in the slightest.

He actually came because he wanted to see Yi Qingxiang’s nervous and frightened appearance. But he completely could not see it from Yi Qingxiang’s face.

This kind of feeling made him very frustrated.

In contrast, the High Clarity Sect’s disciples were long already killed until they were terrified.

But even if they were terrified, they were still unable to survive from Ye Yuan’s hands.

Unable to even admit defeat.

One had to know, the disciples that Ye Yuan killed were all the High Clarity Sect’s future sect pillars!

Because of Ye Yuan’s slaughtering, this season’s Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave’s arrangement was already completely messed up.

Apart from him and Ye Yuan, this first camp, the second camp’s competition became abnormally fierce.

Of course, Ye Yuan even gave all of the sects a big gift.

These sects that originally had no hopes of obtaining a spot had hope now.

Ye Yuan looked at Yang Shen and said coolly, “You saw it that we don’t fear death. So why threaten us with it? Save your unfounded sense of superiority!”

Yang Shen’s face fell and he said with a cold snort, “Stop pretending! When you step into the ring, I’ll see if you guys can still smile!”

After two battles, it was finally Yang Shen and Yi Qingxiang’s showdown.

Presently, as long as it was the Shadowmoon Sect and High Clarity Sect’s confrontation, it would draw great attention.

But today, it was Yang Shen’s first time facing off with the Shadowmoon Sect’s disciple, it was naturally a major topic of discussion.

On the stage, Yi Qingxiang was long already drenched in sweat, cold sweat pouring profusely on his forehead.

This was not that he was scared, but that the pressure Yang Shen brought to him was too great!

This kind of pressure, he had only felt it on one person before, that was Ye Yuan!

Before it started, Yang Shen’s aura had long already risen to the peak, dormant above the nine heavens.

As long as the announcement was given, he would give Yi Qingxiang a lightning blow, and absolutely not give him any chance to admit defeat.

Below the stage, the disciples all had solemn expressions.

“So strong! Turns out that this is Yang Shen’s true strength!”

“In the past, no one could force him to use his true strength at all. Now, it was forced out by Ye Yuan!”

“Separated by the protective grand array, I even feel that I almost can’t breathe! Similarly Second Firmament Celestial Deity, why is the disparity so great?”

...

Different from Ye Yuan’s calm and collectedness, wispy and etherealness, the feeling that Yang Shen gave people was unparalleled domineeringness!

“Begin!”

Du Rufeng’s voice had just landed when Yang Shen’s entire person was like an arrow that left the strong, brandishing his saber and hacking towards Yi Qingxiang.

Under Yang Shen’s peerlessly daunting world power and tyrannical law of saver, Yi Qingxiang was virtually unable to move.

Yi Qingxiang’s brows furrowed, feeling tremendous pressure.

But he did not admit defeat straight away.

Because he knew that Yang Shen definitely had something else up his sleeves! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Although this level was strong, it was not strong enough to the extent of making him unable to concede defeat.

One had to know, similarly Second Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse, wanting to make the other party unable to even say ‘I admit defeat’, three words, that was extremely, extremely difficult.

Suddenly, Yi Qingxiang’s pupils constricted. He felt that everything around slowed down!

Even when he wanted to open his mouth to speak, he became extremely, extremely slow, as if in slow motion.

The entire world, only Yang Shen alone was moving!

“Time law!”

Yi Qingxiang was incomparably shocked in his heart.

“Eh, what’s wrong with Yi Qingxiang? Has he been frightened silly?”

“Yang Shen’s blade is already in front of his face, why is he still not moving?”

Below the stage, the group of disciples was totally uncertain what it meant, completely not understanding what happened.

In their view, Yi Qingxiang already became an idiot who did not know how to move, reaching his head out for Yang Shen to chop.

Bang!

A tremendous rumbling sound came over, Yi Qingxiang’s body flew out backward.

“I ... admit ... defeat!”

Yi Qingxiang’s body was in midair but spat these three words out of his mouth.

“Damn it! How can you possibly block it?! How could it be blocked?! I’ll kill you!”

Yang Shen bellowed, rushing over toward Yi Qingxiang once more frenziedly.

But right at this time, a surge of powerful world power appeared out of thin air, directly blasting him flying.

“He already opened his mouth to concede defeat, so you mustn’t harm his life! This time, it’s just a warning. The next time you commit it again, kill without mercy!”

Du Rufeng’s voice was very calm like he was stating a very normal thing.

Yang Shen crawled to his feet, his face having an extremely reluctant look.

At this time, Du Rufeng’s voice sounded out once more: “This fight, Yang Shen wins.”

Yang Shen’s expression was grim until it was about to drip water, his face not having any joy after winning.

His objective was to kill and not to win.

The emotions that Yang Shen accumulated for half a year was to erupt in this fight.

But he actually failed!

This outcome, he was completely unable to accept it.

Just now, at the last critical moment, Yi Qingxiang actually released divine essence out of his body, manipulating his sword to block the certain-kill blow.

His time law could slow down the flow of time around Yi Qingxiang, but there was one thing that he could not slow down, that was divine essence!

Of course, this was because Yang Shen’s time law skill was lacking.

Otherwise, Yi Qingxiang would be hard-pressed to escape death too.

Ye Yuan’s figure floated up, arrived beside Yi Qingxiang, and fed him a medicinal pill.

The current Yi Qingxiang did not have an intact spot on his body from head to toe, his appearance even more miserable than the last time.

But he did not die!

With the medicinal pill entering the abdomen, Yi Qingxiang’s injuries improved slightly very soon.

“I really didn’t expect that this guy’s trump card was actually time law!”

Mentioning this, Ye Yuan also had lingering fear in his heart.

Time law was the same as spatial law, both being supreme laws. They were extremely hard to comprehend.

Apart from Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, it was still Ye Yuan’s first time seeing time law.

Just one look and Ye Yuan discerned it.

This time law was indeed extremely difficult to deal with.

Under time law, everything was beyond one’s control.

Just now, Yi Qingxiang did not have any strength to retaliate at all, and could not even speak!

“H-Huhu, this ... half a year of special training was indeed ... not in vain!”

Yi Qingxiang did not have any dejection but was rather excited instead.

For him to be able to avoid this calamity, it was entirely because of Ye Yuan’s half a year of training.

It was also precisely because of this training that the three of their strength all made substantial improvement.

This half a year, they cultivated under the horror of death every day.

It was also precisely because of this training that they knew just how strong Ye Yuan was!
