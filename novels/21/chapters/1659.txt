1663 Looking for Abuse

Life and death reincarnation, suddenly an epiphany in one move.

This set of seal art was simply tailor-made for Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s comprehension ability was abnormally high to begin with. Coupled with his bumpy journey and setbacks during his life, his experiences were far from what the average person could compare to.

This Nirvana Seal, he directly comprehended it.

When Ning Tianping saw that Ye Yuan had a sudden epiphany, he could not help saying with great joy, “Congratulations, Your Excellency! Master, what did I say just now? His Excellency is very impressive, right?”

Mo Lifei appeared slightly embarrassed as he smiled, extremely shocked in his heart.

He even turned his nose up at Ye Yuan earlier, feeling that Ye Yuan’s talent was too inferior.

Only now did he know how ridiculously wrong he was!

This kind of comprehension ability was simply astounding.

“Huhu, Little Friend Ye Yuan’s comprehension ability is truly terrifying. For your master to be able to take in a disciple like you, it’s truly a blessing!” Mo Lifei said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I entered the state of sudden epiphany by chance, comprehending the Nirvana Seal. You guys carry on. I’ll consolidate this set of seal art.”

Under Mo Lifei’s guidance, Ning Tianping’s cultivation method was converted very quickly.

When his cultivation method was finished converting, it would also be equivalent to familiarizing with this Starry Night Vast Cloud Art cultivation method once. Cultivating in the future would also yield twice the results with half the effort.

“Master, you said that you’re burdened with a deep-seated hatred. But you still haven’t told me who your enemy is,” Ning Tianping suddenly asked.

Mo Lifei let out a sigh and said, “Wait till your strength is sufficient, then Master will naturally tell you.”

Ning Tianping nodded his head. He also knew that his current strength was too weak, and talking about taking revenge was still too early.

“Master, this disciple and His Excellency will be leaving for the Heavenspan Mountain right away. Come together with us!” Ning Tianping said with a look of anticipation.

The pure-minded Ning Tianping felt that Mo Lifei was very good to him. These few days, quite a bit of teacher-student relationship was also nurtured between the two.

Now, Mo Lifei already gradually recognized this disciple.

Just as Ye Yuan said, this disciple did not disappoint him.

But more importantly, it was his faith in Ye Yuan!

Hearing Ning Tianping’s invitation, Mo Lifei was rather moved, but he shook his head very soon and said, “Master won’t be going, you guys go ahead.”

Ye Yuan seemed to have seen through Mo Lifei’s thoughts, took out a ring, and said, “Senior, I have a spirit void ring here. You can shelter yourself inside. The two of your teacher and student have just formed ties, separating henceforth is too cruel. Moreover, Tianping’s cultivation in the future still needs Senior to guide.”

Mo Lifei’s gaze turned intent and he said, “You ... You actually still have a soul-type mystic treasure!”

This ring was shockingly a soul-type divine lord mystic treasure too.

Although compared to the Soul Suppressing Pearl, it did not even count as trash, there was still no problem for Mo Lifei to shelter himself inside.

Mo Lifei was merely a wisp of remnant soul currently, with not much life force left.

He left behind numerous contingencies in this Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate in order to preserve his remnant soul. But once he left this place, his life force would dissipate rapidly.

This spirit void ring was a soul-type divine lord mystic treasure in the Purple Extreme Hall.

Either way, Ye Yuan had no use for it, so gifting it to Ning Tianping was just right.

The moment Ning Tianping understood the situation, he could not help being overjoyed as he said, “Haha, great! Master, we can leave this lousy place! Don’t you worry! Disciple will definitely cultivate hard and strive to help Master take revenge soon!”

Mo Lifei was agitated in his heart and said with a nod, “Alright, then I shall shelter myself inside this spirit void ring!”

He was inexplicably shocked in his heart. The secrets on this kid called Ye Yuan were truly too many.

Even though it was just a divine lord mystic treasure, soul-type divine lord mystic treasures were exceedingly rare.

He did not think that Ye Yuan actually still had a second of such a treasure on him.

...

Above the wilderness outside the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate, the powerful spiritual energy storm gradually dissipated.

Jing Lu was in high and vigorous spirits. He obtained the Crimson Light Nine Brilliance Divine Art. After coming out and converting his cultivation method, he touched the second-layered heaven Divine Lord bottleneck very quickly, and actually directly broke through.

“Indeed well-deserving of being Young Patriarch Jing Lu! This kind of talent is truly rare in the world!”

“It’s said that he broke through to first-layered heaven Divine Lord for less than 50 years and actually broke through to second-layered heaven Divine Lord already!”

“Obtaining a Divine Dao peak rank five cultivation method this time, he’ll likely become a peerless powerhouse in the future!”

...

The people were all sighing with amazement at Jing Lu’s talent. The speed of his cultivation was indeed too fast, causing people to marvel in wonder.

Right at this time, two rays of light shot out of the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate and returned to the spirit circle.

“It’s Master Ye Yuan!”

“I heard that he entered the depths of the starry sky this time. Wonder whether he obtained a Divine Dao rank six treasure or not!”

“Might not! Rank six treasures are very rare. Even if they entered the depths of the starry sky, they might not be able to obtain it either.”

...

Quite a number of people were all guessing just what kind of harvests Ye Yuan gained. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

But Jing Lu’s expression turned dark and he came up to greet them.

“Ye Yuan, you postured with me previously and looked down on a peak rank five cultivation method. I wonder what you obtained?” Jing Lu said with a cold smile.

Toward this arrogant fellow, Ye Yuan could only be speechless. He just said coolly, “What has what I obtained got to do with you?”

Jing Lu did not get angry either and said with a smile, “Ye Yuan, I want to challenge you! If you lose, I don’t want your treasure either, bring it out for everyone to take a look! Do you dare or not?”

Jing Lu was certain that Ye Yuan definitely obtained some kind of important treasure and was afraid of displaying it and being coveted by everyone.

What he wanted to do right now was to force Ye Yuan to show the treasure and draw everyone’s hostility.

He did not believe that nobody was unmoved.

Jing Lu’s little scheme, how could Ye Yuan not perceive it?

He looked at Jing Lu with a smile that was not a smile and said, “You already broke through to become a second-layered heaven Divine Lord. Challenging me, an Origin Deity Realm, your skin is really thick!”

With Ye Yuan saying so, there were indeed quite a number of people who gestured and pointed, very disdainful towards his actions.

This was a blatant bullying people!

However, Jing Lu was clearly long prepared and said with a smile, “You’re not an ordinary Origin Deity Realm. Your strength is even stronger than the vast majority of first-layered heaven Divine Lords. Now, you also obtained a precious treasure in the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate. Jumping another realm to battle is also not impossible!”

“This ... This is also too shameless!”

“Yeah! Although we’re very curious about what treasure Ye Yuan obtained, this kind of shameless words still makes people perspire in shame!”

“An Origin Deity Realm jumping realms to defeat a first-layered heaven Divine Lord is already freakish to the extreme. But to further defeat a second-layered heaven Divine Lord, how is this possible?”

...

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed when he heard it and said, “You really want to know what treasure I obtained?”

Jing Lu smiled and said, “That’s of course! Not just I want, I think everyone wants to know. I’m merely helping everyone speak their mind.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Since that’s the case, then I’ll grant your wish!”

The moment Jing Lu heard, he could not help revealing a smile of his trickery succeeding.

He did not believe that with his current strength, Ye Yuan could still beat him!

“Make your move!” Jing Lu said with a confident face.

Ye Yuan smiled, the divine essence in his entire body rousing. A mysterious and profound seal condensed and formed very quickly!

Sensing that horrifying energy undulation, Jing Lu’s expression suddenly changed.

“Nirvana Seal!”

Ye Yuan injected all of the divine essence in his body and brazenly fired a seal out!
