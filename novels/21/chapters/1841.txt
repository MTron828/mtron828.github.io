Chapter 1845 A Sword Crossing the Void

Regarding this kind of words that brimmed with confidence, Ye Yuan had always turned his nose up at it. He just said coolly, “I should have warned him before not to come and provoke me!” His and Leng Xu’s enmity, I’m not interested at all. Me and Leng Xu are just chance acquaintances, that’s all.”Iron Eagle’s brows furrowed when he heard that and said with a cold smile, “You want to clean yourself up with one sentence? Chance acquaintances, you would kill the Black Smoke Twin Fiends, and even send Young Master Xu back to the manor? Do you know that you ruined Young Master Hao’s important matter?”

Ye Yuan did things based on his heart. It was just that this thing already happened, others naturally would not believe his explanation.

Killing the Black Smoke Twin Fiends was equivalent to declaring war on Leng Hao.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “They wanted to kill me. I shouldn’t just extend my head over for him to chop, right?”

Iron Eagle said in a solemn voice, “No need to explain anymore. No matter what you think, you have to die today!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he laughed.

“Is a Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity very impressive? Want to kill me, you can give it a try,” Ye Yuan said very calmly.

“Fool who doesn’t know what you’re talking about. Now, I’ll let you take a look at the disparity between initial-stage Celestial Deity Realm and middle-stage Celestial Deity Realm.”

Iron Eagle’s gaze turned dark, Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity’s world power gushed out frenziedly, enveloping the entire alley inside. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although the intel was wrong; Ye Yuan already broke through to Second Firmament Celestial Deity, to him, Iron Eagle, it was the same.

The result was all death!

Iron Eagle took out a Thundergod Hammer, akin to a god descending to earth, directly swiping it at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was just about to make a move when his gaze suddenly turned intent, and he stopped.

When Iron Eagle saw the situation, a hint of a cruel smile flashed across the corners of his mouth. He thought that Ye Yuan saw his might and directly gave up resisting.

But right at this time, a figure suddenly showed up, blocking between the two people.

Rumble!

With a loud noise, Iron Eagle’s figure flying out backward.

“Y-Young Master Xu!” Iron Eagle’s face changed, not expecting to actually run into Leng Xu.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Leng Xu’s mouth and he said, “My good big brother really can’t wait! Being brothers, it really chills my heart!”

Iron Eagle’s expression was very ugly. Clearly, his conversation with Ye Yuan just now, Leng Xu heard all of it.

“Y-Young Master Xu, you’re mistaken ...”

Leng Xu flicked his sleeves grandly and said with a cold snort, “Enough! At this point, are you still going to explain yourself? Could it be that in your eyes, I’m an utter moron? Go back and tell your master, Ye Yuan is my friend. If he dares to touch a hair of his, I’ll never rest until he’s dead!”

Iron Eagle let out a sigh and was about to turn around and leave.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up, “Don’t need to bring these words back anymore, you can stay behind!”

Iron Eagle was taken aback when he heard that and could not help laughing as he said, “Just the likes of you want to keep me behind too?”

Leng Xu also said, “Ye Yuan, very sorry, I don’t have the strength to make him stay! But you rest assured. This matter, I’ll definitely claim it back for you!’

Iron Eagle chuckled and said, “Young Master Xu’s words are said a little too conceitedly, right?”

Since they already lost all decorum, Iron Eagle was no longer apprehensive anymore too.

Either way, Leng Xu and Leng Hao were already like fire and water, this was something that everyone knew.

It was just that in the past, everyone competed in the dark. But now, it became an assassination.

Leng Xu’s expression could not help changing when he heard that and actually did not say anything to refute.

Clearly, Leng Xu’s situation in the Leng Family was not too good.

“Ye Yuan, s-sorry, I’m useless!” Leng Xu said in shame.

Iron Eagle chuckled and said, “Kid, consider yourself lucky today. But next time, you won’t be so lucky.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No need for next time, I’ll give you this chance right now.”

“Ye Yuan ...”

Leng Xu was just about to persuade him further, but then he heard Ye Yuan saying, “Brother Leng, you wait a moment. We’ll go and drink a hundred bowls again in a while!”

Iron Eagle could not help laughing loudly when he heard that and said, “Ignorant fool, since you’re taking the road to ruin yourself, then I’ll send you off.”

Finished talking, Iron Eagle’s aura released again, world power crushed over towards Ye Yuan.

On Ye Yuan’s body, blue fine lines spread out. A strange force isolated Iron Eagle’s world power.

“Wrath of the Thundergod!”

Iron Eagle’s Thundergod Hammer was raised high up. In the entire world domain, it was all berserk lightning and thunder, the momentum extremely shocking.

This lightning domain was akin to the furious roar of heaven and earth, making people’s faces change.

Ye Yuan stood inside but was like it had nothing to do with him.

He looked at Iron Eagle. He raised up his Frostcounter Sword slowly and said coolly, “Strength is decent. You indeed didn’t disappoint me! I recently comprehended a style of sword art. It’s just nice to test the sword on you.”

Iron Eagle laughed wildly to no end when he heard that and said, “Arrogant and ignorant young man, using me to test the sword is at the cost of your life! Go to hell!”

Iron Eagle waved the Thundergod Hammer, landing it towards Ye Yuan’s head.

For a moment, the lightning in the entire space gathered over towards Ye Yuan.

Seeing this scene, Leng Xu’s expression suddenly changed and he cried out in shock, “Careful!”

He was just about to make a move to help Ye Yuan, but heard Ye Yuan’s voice drift over: “Calm down, I’m fine.”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan moved as well!

“A Sword Crossing the Void!”

Leng Xu saw a blur before his eyes, Ye Yuan’s figure already vanished.

When he appeared again, he was already behind Iron Eagle.

Leng Xu’s expression suddenly changed and he exclaimed, “This ... spatial shift! Laws fusion!”

How could Leng Xu not perceive that this sword of Ye Yuan’s fused spatial law and Sword Dao law? The commotion was not noticeable, but the power was extremely shocking.

That boundless lightning dissipated into nothing very quickly.

“This ... How is this possible?”

Iron Eagle’s eyes were full of incredulity.

Then his body started collapsing.

Finally, it turned into nothingness.

Before dying, he seemed to have seen infinite fear.

This sword of Ye Yuan’s virtually annihilated the void, smashing his body into pieces.

After three years of enlightenment, Ye Yuan did not only comprehend the fourth firmament spatial law, but he also further fused the laws, creating ‘A Sword Crossing the Void.’

This sword art could be said to have gathered the grand achievements of Ye Yuan’s Martial Dao, unleashing the power of laws to the extreme.

Its power was unimaginable.

The moment this move was released, not only was it swift to the extreme, it could even instantly cut the void into countless pieces!

Leng Xu looked at that figure in the distance, shocked until he could not close his mouth.

Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity was practically an insurmountable high mountain to Third Firmament Celestial Deities.

But Ye Yuan just broke through to Second Firmament Celestial Deity and could actually directly kill a Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity.

This kind of strength was simply dreadful to the ears.

Especially that sword just now, it really took his breath away.

Although Leng Xu’s strength was stronger than Iron Eagle’s, this move, he touched his own heart and felt that he could not receive it!

Ye Yuan put away the sword and stood there. Coming before Leng Xu, he said with a smile, “Brother Leng, come. Let’s drink.”

Leng Xu was taken back and immediately laughed loudly and said, “Haha, okay! Today, I definitely won’t lose to you!”

Ye Yuan also laughed and said, “Just your bit of alcohol tolerance, it’s really not enough to fill the crevices between my teeth!”

The two laughed loudly and walked in the direction of the tavern.
