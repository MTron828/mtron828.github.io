Chapter 3059: Failing With Every Attempt!

Yun Xiang was very confident, arriving before the grand array, and took a step in.

The grand array did not have the slightest activity.

Following that, she took a second step. There was still nothing happening.

Third step, fourth step … Yun Xiang stormed the formation naturally and smoothly, without the slightest sluggishness.

Compared to when Ye Yuan challenged the formation the previous time, it could simply be said to be unstoppable momentum.

When Zhang Hexin and the rest saw the situation, they were all overjoyed.

These few months of hardship finally exchanged for the hope of victory.

“Impressive! Impressive! It’s still a Hegemon level heavenly formation master in the end. Her strength is indeed not for show!”

“Hegemon Yun Xiang only did not detect it previously. Once she realized that we’re situated inside the Heaven formation, this place indeed can’t stop her!”

“Ye Yuan that boy is going to be in misery!”

… …

But, Ye Yuan turned a deaf ear to the outside world’s shock.

He was still writing and drawing, thinking about something.

......

Pffft!

A gust of palm wind attacked. The thing that Ye Yuan was drawing was directly erased.

Ye Yuan’s thoughts were naturally interrupted too.

He frowned and looked at the arrival. Who could it be if not Zhang Hexin?

Zhang Hexin had a cold smile on his face, and he said, “Boy, I’ve tolerated you for a long time! Now, you’re still putting on an appearance? You’ve already lost!”

“Talking nonsense with him for what? Kill him at once!” Kong Hai followed closely behind and said in a cold voice.

These few days, Ye Yuan did not go easy on tormenting them.

The number of times he made them storm the formation was much more than Yun Xiang.

In the end, Yun Xiang already comprehended the formation, but Ye Yuan did not have any leads yet.

They already found Ye Yuan displeasing to the eye in the first place. Now, it was naturally avenging grievances if there were any, and taking revenge if there were grudges.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhang Hexin and said with a light smile, “This sub-formation isn’t that simple. Behaving like this now, be careful that you guys won’t be able to clean up the mess in a while.”

Kong Hai sneered and said, “Yun Xiang has already cracked the formation. What’s there to clean up still? Boy, this seat has found you displeasing for a long time!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “Then you might be even more unhappy in a while. No matter what, you all can’t kill me right now because I’m the only second choice! Killing me, once Yun Xiang fails, none of you can get out! If you all are so confident in her, do it.”

Ye Yuan spread his two hands out and made it look like he was at other people’s mercy to be cut up like fish.

With this, Zhang Hexin two people hesitated instead.

He snorted coldly and said, “Boy, don’t be pleased with yourself! Yun Xiang will succeed in storming the formation right away. At that time, it will be your death!”

Ye Yuan shrugged, indifferent to it.

This sub-formation was not that simple.

He had not even understood the changes involved up till now.

Ye Yuan naturally would not underestimate a Hegemon level heavenly formation master, but he was certain that Yun Xiang had most likely walked into a misunderstanding.

This sub-formation was designed extremely ingeniously. There were several areas that were very easy to mix up.

It was precisely because he was not sure that Ye Yuan made Zhang Hexin and the rest storm the formation many times. It was not that he had the intention of toying with him.

But Zhang Hexin and the rest naturally felt that Ye Yuan was deliberately targeting them.

Of course, he could not be bothered to make them understood either.

Ye Yuan naturally had his reliance to dare pick a fight with Yun Xiang.

He fused the origin seeds of myriad Dao. A very large portion of them were all Labyrinth Divine Palace disciples.

Among them, there were origin powers that were quite similar to Heaven formation.

Ye Yuan guessed that the original master of this origin seed should have a significant relationship with Hegemon Sevenway.

It was by relying on precisely this origin seed that Ye Yuan held superior advantage in the Heaven formation than others.

Although Yun Xiang was formidable, she wholeheartedly sought speed, falling into mediocrity.

Those few places that were easy to make one be confused were not that easy to discover.

Boom!

Before Zhang Hexin’s voice faded, Yun Xiang was directly blasted out.

Heavily wounded!

The expressions of the six great Hegemons changed wildly! Ye Yuan really hit the mark!

Yun Xiang failed!

“What’s going on?” Zhang Hexin asked.

Yun Xiang frowned heavily and said, “It seems like somewhere is wrong. Let me deduce it again! Relax, I’ve already completely comprehended this sub-formation. It’s not difficult to crack it!”

One sentence made everyone settle down.

“Okay! Whatever help you need, just say it. You can’t lose this battle!” Zhang Hexin said with a solemn face.

After all, it was the number one killing formation. Mistakes were naturally allowed.

But the face of Hegemon Realms could not be lost! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In this battle, they could not lose to Ye Yuan no matter what!

Yun Xiang was a little stunned, but she still nodded her head and said, “Okay, I’ll reorganize it again.”

Hence, she buried herself in work again.

But Zhang Hexin felt that there was a burning gaze looking over toward him.

Turning his head, he discovered that Ye Yuan was currently looking at him with a smile that was not a smile.

Motherfucker, this guy was right again!

“Humph!

?Brat, don’t get smug! She merely ran into some trouble. The general direction is correct! Just you wait to surrender!” Zhang Hexin gave a cold snort and no longer cared about Ye Yuan.

He could not afford to lose this face!

And this time, Ye Yuan started taking things easy and simply crossed his hands and stopped comprehending the formation.

“What’s the matter? Ye Yuan wouldn’t have given up, right?”

“Even if he doesn’t give up, the chances of winning aren’t high either, right? Hegemon Yun Xiang also said that she has already fully understood it!”

“Yeah, although she ran into some trouble, the results will definitely be her being successful. Ye Yuan’s speed is still too slow!”

… …

Everyone started discussing in whispers when they saw the situation.

In a blink of an eye, another half a month passed.

Yun Xiang naturally could not dispense without tormenting Zhang Hexin they all a few times.

Then she went to storm the formation again with overflowing confidence.

Zhang Hexin and the rest pulled themselves together once more, secretly cheering Yun Xiang on.

Boom!

Who knew that before long, Yun Xiang was blasted out again.

This time, it was even more miserable!

The expressions of Zhang Hexin and the rest changed wildly, hurriedly going up to help Yun Xiang up.

“Are you alright?” Zhang Hexin asked with concern.

He was not on very good terms with Yun Xiang. There were some grudges. But, being united against outsiders at this time, he was naturally concerned.

This time, half of Yun Xiang’s body was blown away, rather miserable.

Recovering would not be that easy as well.

But Yun Xiang did not seem to have heard it and was full of confusion as she said, “Impossible! I’ve already deduced it dozens of times! It’s clearly not wrong! Why?! Why is it like this?!”

The expressions on the faces of the six great Hegemons were very complicated.

Without turning around, they already felt a series of burning gazes.

Failed again!

“It’s okay. We have plenty of time, again!” Zhang Hexin encouraged.

Yun Xiang did not say anything and nodded her head.

After nursing her wounds for a few days, Yun Xiang finally recovered a little and started studying intensively again.

But unfortunately, she came out badly injured each time.

Furthermore, each was more severe than the last!

After attempting for seven to eight times like time, she finally could not hold on anymore.

“Why?! Why is this happening! I’ve clearly already comprehended the formation. Why can’t I crack the formation!” Yun Xiang looked up to the sky and roared angrily, her eyes full of confusion.

Zhang Hexin’s face was ugly to the extreme.

Sustaining serious injuries repeatedly, Yun Xiang was already powerless to challenge the formation anymore!

His gaze could not resist looking toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan did not look at him. He was currently chatting away with Yang Qing.

This guy was definitely doing it on purpose!

But there was no choice!

“Boy, Yun Xiang can’t do it anymore! Hurry up and go comprehend the formation!” Zhang Hexin arrived in front of Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice.
