Chapter 2247: There Would Be No Stories Without Coincidences!

Ye Yuan brought Wild Blade away and looked for a hidden place. He laid down compact array formations and started his closed-seclusion.

His mind stirred. A gray bead emerged and suspended in the air. It was precisely the Soul Suppressing Pearl.

It was just that the current Soul Suppressing Pearl had cracks on it, broken and damaged, virtually about to fall apart.

Ye Yuan took out the Silvernet Blood Essence and placed the Soul Suppressing Pearl on it, absorbing the Silvernet Blood Essence’s vital essence.

This piece of Silvernet Blood Essence had its intelligence unlocked by Daymeld, had absorbed no idea how many soul bodies’ power, and was already strengthened to the extreme.

Allowing it to carry on cultivating, this primordial spirit would be breaking through to Heavenly Emperor Realm very soon.

One could say that it was a king among Silvernet Blood Essences.

Ye Yuan controlled the Silvernet Blood Essence carefully, restoring the Soul Suppressing Pearl. In a blink, it was half a month’s time.

The cracks on the Soul Suppressing Pearl were repaired bit by bit. The originally dim and dull Soul Suppressing Pearl finally recovered a trace of life.

Right then, a phantom slowly appeared in front of Ye Yuan. It was precisely Dustless!

Seeing Dustless waking up, Ye Yuan finally let out a long sigh in relief.

“Senior, you finally woke up! Ye Yuan was wilful and acted recklessly, and got you involved.” Ye Yuan said with remorse.

He would never regret it when he did things.

It was just that Dustless only became like this for the sake of protecting him. He naturally could not help feeling somewhat upset in his heart.

Dustless smiled and said, “Silly lad, is there still a need to be so courteous between you and me? This old man is an artifact spirit to begin with. When the ruler worries, the subjects feel insulted; when the ruler is insulted, the subjects die! Saving you is something within this old man’s duties! It’s just that ... that girl’s situation isn’t too good!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, expression crestfallen.

With his present realm, he could naturally discern Mu Lingxue’s situation.

Mu Lingxue’s final trace of spiritual consciousness was already akin to a candle’s flame flickering in the wind. It was possible to extinguish at any time.

“I plan on going to the Priest Temple to find Sacred Ancestor High Priest. His strength is exceedingly formidable. Maybe he has some way to save Lingxue. If it still can’t work ... then there’s only going up the Heavenspan Mountain!” Ye Yuan said.

Going up the Heavenspan Mountain, the hope was extremely bleak.

This kind of divine medicine was hidden above the firmament of a million years.

Ye Yuan was not belittling his own capability, but with his present strength, wanting to climb to the level of Dao Ancestor, the likelihood was virtually zero.

And this was also the final method.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan’s cultivation speed was fast enough. The Soul Suppressing Pearl was recovering continuously and Dustless’s strength was becoming stronger without ceasing, that was how Mu Lingxue lasted until today.

Otherwise, Mu Lingxue’s soul would have long dissipated.

Dustless nodded and said, “Sacred Ancestor High Priest is a major power, an existence second only to Medicine Ancestor. If he’s willing to take action, there might really be hope.”

He had followed Ye Yuan all over the world. His knowledge of things had also become much more extensive.

In the past, following Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, even if he had an outstanding talent, Sacred Ancestor High Priest was an existence that he could not come into contact with.

But Ye Yuan only used roughly 2000 years and did something that Immortal Grove could not do his whole life.

Although Dustless did not know about Deva Five Blights, he also knew that Sacred Ancestor High Priest was an existence above Heavenly Emperor, his means being immensely formidable.

Clearly, he had much more extensive experience than him, this soul body.

After Dustless waking up, he took the initiative to control the Soul Suppressing Pearl. The speed of absorbing the Silvernet Blood Essence sped up several times.

This Silvernet Blood Essence’s quality was extremely high. It was a great tonic to Dustless and the Soul Suppressing Pearl.

Within three days, not only did the Soul Suppressing Pearl recover as good as new, it even improved a rank, becoming a middle-rank heavenly emperor spirit treasure. This made Dustless and Ye Yuan wild with ecstasy.

The stronger Dustless got, the more stable suppressing Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness naturally was.

Done with all these, only then, did Ye Yuan’s heart calm down slightly. Dispelling the array formations, he brought Wild Blade out of the cave.

But the moment he came out, Ye Yuan could not help staring wide-eyed and tongue-tied.

Far away, space shattered. There were berserk spatial turbulent flows everywhere.

Straining his eyes and looking into the distance, how was there still any mountain range? How was there still any Asura Blood Pool? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The space of several tens of millions of miles was directly fought until it shattered!

However, the Heavenspan World’s space was extremely stable. It was in the midst of slowly recovering.

Ye Yuan could not help linking it to those powerful energies when he left and had a clearer understanding of Deva Realm powerhouses again.

The Heaven Shocking Lightning that he threw out back then, it was at least an attack left behind by a late-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

Even middle-stage Heavenly Emperors did not have such horrifying power too.

As for Deva Realm, they even directly fought until space shattered, mountains moving and seas being leveled.

“No wonder it’s said that the Doomsday Battle, if Deva Realm powerhouses all take action, that’s virtually destroying heaven and decimating the earth! The entire Heavenspan World will probably be broken apart by them too. It would be weird if this world wasn’t destroyed!” Ye Yuan exclaimed.

Dustless nodded and said, “The Ancient God Battlefield is probably the shattered ancient battlefield! There, countless Heavenly Emperors and Empyreans fell, it’s indeed terrifying! The might of Deva Realm powerhouses is unimaginable!”

He learned of Deva Realm’s existence from Ye Yuan earlier. Only then did he know that there was heaven beyond heaven.

Now that the divine race was about to come into being, this world would probably not know peace again.

Ye Yuan’s mouth moved mutely twice, and he said with lingering fear, “Luckily ran far enough, if it was too near. I’m afraid we’d have directly been obliterated by these guys!”

The array formation that Ye Yuan laid down was completely unable to withstand a single blow in front of Deva Realm.

At that time, he was in closed-seclusion. A stray bullet being fired over and he would have evaporated.

His voice had yet to fade when a streak of flowing light landed from the horizon, landed right in the woods, smashing until the entire stretch of mountain range trembled.

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered slightly, thinking in his heart that it would not be so coincidental, right?

Running over to take a look, a large pit was already smashed out in the ground.

Inside the large pit, a figure was lying there, his aura extremely weak.

His hand was even grabbing a bow!

A golden bow!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent and he could not help drawing a cold breath.

That golden bow, what was it if not the Limitless God Killing Bow?

He was speculating just now, to be able to render the Asura Blood Pool until like this, it must have experienced an extremely horrifying great battle.

Most likely, the supreme Heavenly Emperors who perished were not even in small numbers.

In fact, there were even Deva Realm super powerhouses that took action!

Then, it was absolutely impossible for the hostilities to calm down so quickly.

That person who fell wouldn’t have escaped from the battlefield, right?

With one look, it was really the case.

It was just that Ye Yuan did not expect that this person actually snatched away the Limitless God Killing Bow from the hands of numerous powerhouses!

Very clearly, he was being pursued by people until here!

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan was filled with fear.

He rushed forward with a lunge, grabbed that person, and did a teleport.

Following that, Ye Yuan’s fingers pointed repeatedly, laying down an extremely complex array formation on every side.

“Hundred Schools of Thoughts Nine Profound Heaven Subduing Grand Array, conceal!”

Ye Yuan gave a low cry, the formation formed!

In the woods, Ye Yuan and the surrounding scenery became a unified entity, concealing all auras.

Looking from the outside, one could not see through the slightest abnormality at all.

Ye Yuan had just finished doing all these when a gray-robed man descended from the sky, and he landed at the edge of the huge pit.

He looked at the giant pit, his gaze seemingly somber to the extreme!

“This huge pit was clearly just formed, but the person is actually gone! Heh, there’s actually someone who dares kill-steal this emperor. This Heavenly Emperor wants to see where you can hide!”

Done talking, the gray-robed man rose into the air and fired out one terrifying attack after another towards the surrounding woods.

In a breath, the entire forest was reduced to shambles!
