Chapter 1359: A Person With Stories

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Yuan, your alchemy talent is astonishing. Why not ... officially join my Myriad Treasure Tower?”

Xiao Feng officially extended an invitation to Ye Yuan. He knew that Ye Yuan would definitely not refuse.

Without the Myriad Treasure Tower’s protection, Ye Yuan was not enough to fill the crevices between the Wang Family’s teeth at all.

He believed that Ye Yuan was a clever person and knew how to choose.

Who knew that Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for Senior’s appreciation. But this Ye already has a place to go.”

Ye Yuan’s reply made Xiao Feng stupefied. Clearly, this answer caught him somewhat off-guard.

“Ye Yuan, that Wang Family’s junior only apologized to you due to my pressure. It’s just that this way, he probably harbors even more grudge towards you. You probably ... don’t understand Brightraise City’s Wang Family’s strength yet, right?” Xiao Feng advised Ye Yuan, thinking that the latter could not figure out the situation.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Ye is naturally clear about this. But I have my own plans. But Senior rest assured, we still have a teacher-student relationship.”

Xiao Feng’s brows furrowed, not quite understanding Ye Yuan’s words.

But very soon, he understood and said in surprise, “You’re going to enter the Wu Meng Academy?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Yes! Geniuses gather at Wu Meng Academy, this Ye looks forward to it very much!”

Xiao Feng felt rather flustered and urged, “Ye Yuan, your alchemy talent is astonishing, even this old man sighs at my own inferiority! You can enjoy immense resources at the Myriad Treasure Tower and don’t have to go compete with the other juniors!”

Wu Meng Academy also placed emphasis on the nurturing of alchemists. But the most important thing was still martial arts.

Going to Wu Meng Academy to be an ordinary student, the resources obtained were very limited. One even had to crack their heads to compete for resources with other students.

In the Myriad Treasure Tower, Ye Yuan could dive into researching Alchemy Dao.

With his talent, his future accomplishments would be limitless.

In Xiao Feng’s view, Ye Yuan was attending to the superficials and neglecting the essentials here.

Ye Yuan just smiled and said nothing when he heard that. Clearly, he had already made up his mind.

When Xiao Feng saw this, he just sighed and said, “Forget it, forget it, since that’s the case, it’s up to you! You giving this Essence Cultivating Pill’s pill formula to the Myriad Treasure Tower, the Myriad Treasure Tower owes you a great favor. This is a bronze Myriad Treasure Token. Holding this token, you enjoy a 30% discount when purchasing goods at all Myriad Treasure Towers. Additionally, there are 10 million low-grade divine essence stones inside here. It’s not much, but just take it as the price of buying out the Essence Cultivating Pill.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up. He received the token and thanked: “Many thanks, Senior!”

Laughing out, Xiao Feng scolded him, “You brat, insisting on doing this kind of thing where you reject what’s near and seek that is far! If you were willing to join the Myriad Treasure Tower, why would you care about this discount?”

Xiao Feng really had the heart of loving a talent stirred, that was why he was like that.

Living together for half a year, the two people could not help developing a sense of appreciation for one another.

Unknowingly, Xiao Feng and Ye Yuan became friends despite a great difference in age just like that.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Actually, it’s all the same. Entering the Wu Meng Academy, I can similarly go and listen to Senior’s lecture on Dao.”

Xiao Feng shook his head and said, “You probably don’t have this opportunity anymore! This half a year, this old man gleaned considerable gains. After going back this time, I’ll probably be in closed-seclusion for a very long time!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, and he exclaimed, “Could Senior be ... going to break through that layer of windowpane paper?”

Xiao Feng chortled with laughter and said, “Maybe I can, perhaps I can’t. But, if I can, you’ll claim half the credit! This favor, this old man has received it!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s Senior’s heavy accumulation of comprehension erupting, so what’s it got to do with me? However, Ye Yuan will congratulate Senior here first!”

Xiao Feng was already grand completion Origin Deity Realm. Advancing another step, that was Divine Lord Realm!

How many powerhouses were blocked in front of this great realm?

Those able to take this step were dukes and princes of a region!

If Xiao Feng was really able to break through, it would naturally be a carp leaping over the dragon gate, soaring to the sky in one move!

Xiao Feng laughed loudly and said, “You brat, nothing tangible is in sight yet, and you’re already full of nonsense! This step is as hard as ascending to heaven, so how can it be that easy to break through? Alright, not talking about this anymore. Since you want to go to Wu Meng Capital City, why not just go together with this old man.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Couldn’t ask for more!”

Dustless’ knowledge was unparalleled. But he was not a genuine alchemy god after all.

Xiao Feng’s insights in Alchemy Dao was rather deep and gave Ye Yuan tremendous inspiration. Along the way, he could sit and debate on Dao with him.

...

These few years, Liang Wanru lost a lot of weight.

Gradually becoming thinner and pining away was roughly like this.

“Miss Wanru.”

That dream-haunting voice sounded out behind her, making her entire body tremble.

“Sir Ye! You ... You finally came to see Wanru!”

Upon seeing Ye Yuan, Liang Wanru’s tears could not help trickling down her cheeks.

These few years, Ye Yuan constantly avoided her and virtually never came to see her before.

Although she learned of Ye Yuan’s feelings from Hong Yin there, she could not forget Ye Yuan no matter what.

That moment when Ye Yuan rescued her from the Liang Family’s dungeon, her heart could not hold anyone else anymore.

Later on, Ye Yuan broke into the Wang Family and refined a divine pill.

In Liang Wanru’s view, it was like a legend.

Liang Wanru seemingly looking haggard, how could Ye Yuan not see it?

He let out a sigh and said, “Miss Wanru, why must you be like this?”

Liang Wanru rushed into Ye Yuan’s embrace all at once and said, “Wanru doesn’t care! Really don’t care! Wanru already has nothing in the world, if even you don’t want me too, I ... I can only die!”

She was not scaring Ye Yuan. After she came out of the dungeon, Ye Yuan was already her sole conviction to live on. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan lightly caressed her back and said with a bitter smile, “Miss Wanru is this Ye’s savior, how can this Ye possibly not want you? It’s just that ... this Ye is really unable to accept your feelings!”

Ye Yuan sighed with melancholy, his words full of helplessness and pain.

When Mu Lingxue sacrificed her divine soul to trigger Ice Sealing Ten Thousand Miles, it also froze Ye Yuan’s heart.

Even Yue Mengli, who shared life and death with him, was also unable to melt this ice heart.

Seemingly sensing Ye Yuan’s pain, Liang Wanru raised her head and looked at Ye Yuan, and involuntarily trembled.

She discovered that the corners of Ye Yuan’s eyes actually had tears falling!

Back then, when Ye Yuan was heavily injured on the verge of death, he never made a single groan either. In Liang Wanru’s heart, Ye Yuan was a man of indomitable spirit.

But such a man would actually shed tears too. What on earth did he experience?

Indeed, Ye Yuan’s heart was higher than the heavens! He wanted to be that tenth Dao Ancestor!

It was just that Ye Yuan himself also knew that that was merely a great noble aspiration that he made.

This path was far too difficult, a thousand times, even ten thousand times harder than when he broke through to Deity Realm in the Immortal Grove Region!

Liang Wanru suddenly felt her heart aching, and all because Ye Yuan did not accept her.

Ye Yuan’s tears seemingly flowed into her heart, making her feel the same.

Suddenly, Liang Wanru had a great impulse to want to understand this man’s past.

She discovered that this man, who was not that old, seemed to have many, many stories.

“Sir Ye, don’t chase me away, alright? Wanru doesn’t need you to make any promises. I only request to be able to follow by your side, even as a slave!” Liang Wanru suddenly ceased her sobbing and said firmly.
