Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You ... Who the hell do you think you are? To dare gesture and comment on my Leng Family’s affairs? Killing my brother? What proof do you have? The one who made the Leng Family lose face is you and Leng Xu. Not me, Leng Hao! You stand here and spout empty rhetoric, based on what?”

Leng Hao being kicked flying by Ye Yuan with a foot, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of enmity.

Ever since Leng Xu knew Ye Yuan, everything seemed to have changed.

But now, it was a God-given opportunity!

Ye Yuan himself courted death, provoking Han Dongjun. This was a chance for him to turn the situation around!

When Han Dongjun saw Ye Yuan, his two eyes were practically spewing fire.

“You’re that Ye Yuan who killed my Xiao-er?” Han Dongjun gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Ye Yuan just smiled slightly. His thoughts stirred, a maidservant and a black-clothed man fell onto the stage.

He turned to Leng Hongxiu and said coolly, “This maidservant is a spy that Leng Hao planted around Leng Xu. A few days ago, she put Heavenly Fragrance Tendon Softening Powder into Leng Xu’s food. It was in order to make Leng Xu lose today’s battle for the young patriarch position. As for this black-clothed man, he’s Leng Hao’s confidant. What Leng Hao has done these few years, as long as Family Head searches his soul, you’ll naturally know everything.”

Seeing these two people, Leng Hao’s expression changed drastically.

That maidservant was still alright, but that man in black was his right arm and knew his affairs like the back of his hand.

If his soul was searched, it was all over!

Actually, that day at the Leng Manor’s entrance, Ye Yuan already detected the existence of this black-clothed man.

It was just that the other party did not make a move, he did not take action either.

That day, the black-clothed man and the maidservant met secretly but was detected by Ye Yuan who had sharp spiritual sense. He caught them red-handed.

But in order not to stir the grass and alert the enemy, he deliberately let the black-clothed man leave.

Today, taking advantage of the interval of the battle for young patriarch, Ye Yuan went to capture the black-cloth man and this maid.

Leng Hao’s countenance naturally collapsed on its own.

“Family Head, don’t listen to this guy’s words! He has evil designs. I don’t know these two people at all!” Leng Hao’s eyes revealed some panic but defended himself through sophistry.

These few years, in order to become the young patriarch, he did quite a number of things that could not be exposed to the sun.

Once it was exposed, he would be totally ruined!

But Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said disdainfully, “If not for Leng Xu, do you think that I’d bother with this nonsensical and messy thing? Fabricating charges against you? You, are you also worthy?”

Leng Hongxiu’s expression was also not looking too good.

Right now, the development of things had gone far beyond his expectations.

How could he not perceive the panic in Leng Hao’s eyes?

However, Leng Hao was not some heinous and wicked beyond redemption person in his impression.

On the contrary, he thought very highly of Leng Hao.

It was also precisely so that he pushed for Leng Hao to become the young patriarch.

Leng Xu’s personality was too undisciplined and carefree. Honestly speaking, it was also not suited to inherit the position of family head.

These were all within Leng Hao’s scope of considerations.

He was currently the head of a family and had no choice but to consider a little further.

But right at this time, the Han Dongjun who had been treated as air all along said furiously, “Punk, I’m talking to you, didn’t you hear me? Are you the murderer Ye Yuan who killed my Xiao-er?”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said crossly, “Who are you, do I know you? Why do I have to talk to you? Also, didn’t Leng Hao called my name just now? Are you deaf, didn’t you hear?”

“Pffft!”

Ye Yuan’s words made the Leng Family’s people all simmer with laughter.

Even the Han Family people that he brought also could not refrain from laughing.

Han Dongjun’s fury towered to the sky. His son was killed, and he even had to be scoffed at by this fellow. What was it with this world?

“Little brute, you actually dared to kill Xiao-er. Today, even if the Jade Emperor comes, he can’t save you either!” Han Dongjun said angrily.

Ye Yuan said with a scornful look, “When I killed Han Xiao, there were many people around. It was clearly him who ambushed, wanting to kill me but was counter-killed by me. But now, you’re questioning me. Heh, the Han Family’s people are really overbearing!”

Han Dongjun said in a cold voice, “Who the hell do you think you are, to also dare compare to my Xiao-er? You’re just a trash who’s less than animals in front of him!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “Yeah, I, this trash who’s less than animals, killed your son using only one move. Your son is lesser than ... even a trash who’s less than animals!”

“Pffft!”

Another burst of laughter sounded out, making Han Dongjun unable to contain his anger. He roared, “What are you laughing at?! Laugh again and I’ll tear your mouths!”

Finished talking, his expression was very grim as he turned to Leng Hongxiu and said, “Leng Hongxiu, what are you going to do? I’m going to bring the person away right now, you have no objections, right? He already admitted to killing Xiao-er!”

Leng Hongxiu gave Ye Yuan a glance and said coolly, “This person isn’t a member of my Leng Family. If you want to bring away, I naturally have nothing to say. But, it can’t be within my Leng Family’s boundary! After this matter is settled, I’ll chase him out of the Leng Family. At that time, whether you want to kill or dismember, it’s up to you.”

The moment Han Dongjun heard, he grinned and said, “Alright, I can wait! Brat, killing my Xiao-er, you’ll know how severe the consequences are!”

Toward Leng Hongxiu’s attitude, Ye Yuan was not too surprised. He just shrugged and said, “Just the likes of you can’t make me stay!”

Han Dongjun seemed to have heard some hilarious joke and snickered as he said, “Shameless boasting fool, a measly Second Firmament Celestial Deity also wants to escape from this Han’s hands! If I let you escape, I, this Han, absolutely won’t show face in Thousand Soar Imperial Capital in the future!”

Han Dongjun was a half-step True God existence, his status in the Han Family rather high.

No matter how formidable Ye Yuan, this Second Firmament Celestial Deity, was, it was also impossible to escape from his hands.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said smilingly, “You have to remember what you said today. At that time, don’t go back on your word.”

He comprehended spatial shift. One thought, and he would be hundreds of thousands of miles away.

Even a True God powerhouse also had to expend a lot of effort to catch up to him, let alone a mere half-step True God.

By the side, Leng Hao was incomparably conflicted in his heart.

He really wanted to go up and kill those two with a palm. But this way, him silencing people to prevent divulgence of his secrets would be equivalent to being confirmed. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

But not killing, once Leng Hongxiu searched the souls, wouldn’t he know everything.

Right then, Leng Hongxiu spoke!

“Since you say that Hao-er entrapped Xu-er, then I’ll carry out a soul-search on these two! If it’s not like what you said, don’t blame my Leng Family for not being courteous!” Leng Hongxiu looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly.

Ye Yuan did not speak, but in his heart, a hint of foreboding premonition arose.

It seemed like he somewhat underestimated the feelings between Leng Hongxiu and Leng Hao!

Right at this time, the divine soul power of a True God Realm released, rushing into those two people’s sea of consciousness domineeringly.

“Puhwark!”

The two people virtually spewed out a blood arrow at the same time, then fell to the ground, already ceased breathing.

Ye Yuan’s face changed. Was this ... doing away with the witnesses?

Leng Hao’s expression was incomparably nervous. His entire body was practically going to tremble already.

Would Leng Hongxiu announce his crimes?

Leng Hongxiu’s closed eyes slowly opened, looked at Ye Yuan, and said indifferently, “Talking nonsense, ruining my Leng Family’s reputation! Come, men! Take this boy down for me!”
