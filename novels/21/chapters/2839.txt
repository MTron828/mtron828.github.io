Chapter 2845 Exiled to Absolute Heaven Barrier!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Very soon, a piece of news spread like wildfire.

Master Zuo Chen’s new disciple, grade five heavenly alchemist Ye Yuan, instructed to exile several hundred of the sect’s disciples to the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

The moment the news came out, it immediately incurred a wave of ridicule and mockery.

“Who does he think he is? He can utter something that sounds so overconfident?”

“Huhu, he acknowledged an amazing teacher. It’s understandable.”

“Goodness gracious, if they got sent out, what to do about it in the future? Should we go to XuanYang Peak to grovel to this grandmaster?”

“How wise is Ancestor Zuo Chen? How did he accept a hothead as a disciple?”

In less than half a day, this wind had already swept through the Extreme Medicine Sect.

One should not look at how the Extreme Medicine Sect was huge. The speed of news spreading was not slow at all.

In the Extreme Medicine Sect, going to the Absolute Heaven Barrier was a very taboo thing.

After all, nobody wanted their own sect’s disciples to go to the front lines and court death.

Of course, Extreme Medicine Sect had nearly half of its disciples that were resisting the blood race at the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

It was just that the disciples that went to the Absolute Heaven Barrier were mostly the warring faction, while most who stayed behind to defend the sect were from the conservative faction.

Like Zuo Chen, he was a typical example of the warring faction.

Over 70% of the disciples under him were at the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Therefore, although Xuan Yang Peak was big, there were actually not many people.

The conservative faction’s opinion was not to fight but to groom a large number of powerhouses in the sect and accumulate strength.

Over these years, the Extreme Medicine Sect strengthened the nurturing of martial arts and had indeed also groomed a large group of Emperor Realm powerhouses.

This way, the conservative faction’s status became even more stable.

Hence, Ye Yuan wanting to exile these people actually touched the interests of the conservative faction. They naturally would not let Ye Yuan get his way.

Many Emperor Realm powerhouses also scoffed in derision when they received this news.

A brat who was still wet behind his ears thought that he could cover the sky with one hand after entering the sect?

Laughable!

Why did Zuo Chen take in this kind of moron as a disciple?

The news spread fervently, while Wu Jiang and Zhou Qun had smug faces.

“Martial Uncle Zhou’s ability is truly remarkable! It’s just been half a day, and that grandmaster of ours has already become the laughingstock of the entire sect!” Qian Nan said ingratiatingly.

Zhou Qun had a proud look as he said, “A trivial matter! But this piece of news spreading so quickly wasn’t just my credit alone! Someone is adding fuel to the fire!”

Wu Jiang nodded his head and said, “Zuo Chen that old thing raises a hue and cry every day about making the sect’s disciples go to the front lines and deliver themselves to death. He’s very stubborn! It looks like this

brat obtained his true legacy! But we have got to thank this brat too. Zuo Chen that old fellow is going to lose his face this time!”

Speaking of this, Wu Jiang was very pleased with himself.

When talking, he did not have the slightest respect for Zuo Chen this grandmaster either.

In reality, they were very disgusted with Zuo Chen and could even be said to abhor him.

Behind the scenes, they were not stingy with talking about these warring factions.

Furthermore, news spread so quickly. Zhou Qun clearly did not have this much ability.

There were Emperor Realm powerhouses adding fuel to the fire.

Clearly, there were also people happy to see Zuo Chen get deflated.

“Serves him right! Zuo Chen that old thing keeps calling for us to go to the Absolute Heaven Barrier everyday. God knows how many people in the sect hate him to death and wish for him to die at the Absolute Heaven

Barrier! This time, we can just nice watch a show!” Zhou Qun also said with a look of contempt.

Wu Jiang smiled and said, “What’s laughable is that kid. Does he really think that just by having high seniority, he can cover the sky with one hand? Those more formidable than Zuo Chen in this Extreme Medicine Sect

are not just one or two people! Oh right, Zhou Qun, who do you think gave us a push from behind this time?”

Zhou Qun smiled and said, “Asking me, don’t you know it? Apart from that one, who else could it be?”

Wu Jiang laughed and said, “Zuo Chen that old fogey repeatedly tried to drag Emperor Qin Shan into the water. Emperor Qin Shan has hated him to the core a long time ago! Apart from him, there’s really nobody else!

After this time, that Ye Yuan will have a hard time in the sect. Maybe Emperor Qin Shan will find a reason and directly send that punk off to the Absolute Heaven Barrier.”

Gong!

The few people were currently laughing away when the door was directly kicked open by someone. A youth with a shoulder strap walked right in.

Wu Jiang was just about to lose his temper, but when he saw the arrival, he could not help drawing a cold breath.

A foreboding premonition welled up in his heart.

“S-Senior Apprentice Brother Ling gracing us with your presence, I wonder what instructions you have?” Wu Jiang said with an ugly expression.

The arrival was called Ling Jiang, a Law Enforcement Hall disciple. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Law Enforcement Hall disciples had great authority. This Ling Jiang was in charge of the True Sovereign Heaven and below disciples of the few dojos nearby.

Ling Jiang coming at this time, he probably came looking for trouble!

Could it be that Ye Yuan that punk knew that he boasted too much, so he mobilized the Law Enforcement Hall to come deal with him?

Until now, he also did not believe that Ye Yuan could exile all of them to the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Such a large movement, it was bound to be unanimously opposed by the conservative faction.

Previously, the warring faction had already done so. In the end, they naturally ran into a wall.

Ling Jiang’s expression was frosty as he said, “Wu Jiang, bring your men and assemble at Heart Serenity Peak, and immediately set off for the Absolute Heaven Barrier!”

The expressions of the three people present changed wildly at the same time, their eyes full of shock.

How was this possible?

That brat really did it?

Could it be that those Emperor Realm powerhouses all did not care?

Could it be that the conservative faction was just passively watching the warring faction be pleased about it?

“I… [want to meet Martial Uncle Yunhai!” Wu Jiang gritted his teeth and said.

Emperor Cloud Heaven powerhouse, Zheng Yunhai, was Wu Jiang’s backer.

At this time, it was impossible that he did not protect him!

However, Ling Jiang still said coldly, “Don’t bother. You don’t have to hold onto hope either. This order was personally passed down by Sect Master. No one can protect you!”

“What?! S-Sect Master?” Wu Jiang somewhat doubted his own ears, his eyes full of shock.

Why would Sect Master that kind of paramount existence care about this kind of trivial matter?

This was impossible!

But Wu Jiang knew that Ling Jiang absolutely would not joke about this.

Nobody could afford to make this kind of joke!

Although the sect master was not the supreme authority, Hegemon Realms and the Extreme Light Pavilion basically would not care about things.

Under normal circumstances, Sect Master was the highest adjudicator in the Extreme Medicine Sect!

No one dared to provoke his majesty!

Ling Jiang said coldly, “Wu Jiang, move faster. You only have an hour! If it’s delayed, you don’t have to go anymore either!”

Finished saying, Ling Jiang turned around and left.

He did not need to look at Wu Jiang either. No one dared to defy the Law Enforcement Hall’s orders.

Otherwise, the consequences would be much more serious than going to the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Wu Jiang’s heart turned ashen. This was not giving him any chance at all!

But why was this happening?

“He … He really did it? But why would it be Sect Master?” Wu Jiang said with a look of despair.

He made this matter known to everyone. Originally, he wanted to give Ye Yuan and Zuo Chen a slap.

Slapping the face of an Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouse, thinking about it made people a little excited.

But now, the matter blew up so big. The one who got slapped was him instead?

By the side, Zhou Qun’s expression was similarly very ugly.

Achill ran down his spine. He seemed to have provoked a remarkable person.

Him not getting named showed that he had escaped a calamity.

But the matter of him spreading the news could be investigated as long as one had the intention of looking into it.

ight now, he only wanted to become transparent!.
