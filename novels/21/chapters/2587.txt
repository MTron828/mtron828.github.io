Chapter 2593: I’m Biased, So What?

“6-61!”

“R-Really increased! Affinity really increased!”

“My God, I’m not dreaming, right? The Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill can actually really increase affinity!”

… …

The scale mark finally stopped on 61 points!

Although it was only two points, it was enough to shock everyone!

They all thought that Ye Yuan was joking. They did not expect that it was actually true.

The most rubbish Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill can actually increase affinity!

Ye Yuan looked at Wu Chengchao and said coolly, “Wu Chengchao, now you tell me, whether the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is useful or not?”

Wu Chengchao’s expression turned stiff and he said in embarrassment, “U-Useful! B-But why is this?!”

Ye Yuan did not answer, but said coolly, “Now, what should you do?”

Wu Chengchao’s expression was somewhat ugly.

However, this miraculous thing still evoked his limitless desire.

Moreover, he knew that he could not escape this hurdle!

Wu Chengchao cupped his fists towards Lin Lan and said, “Younger Brother Lin, I was reckless before, this old man apologizes to you!”

While Lin Lan gave a cold snort and paid no heed to him.

Wu Chengchao froze there, very embarrassed.

If it were before, being apologized to by a grade three heavenly alchemist, Lin Lan would definitely be in fear and trepidation.

But now, he was Ye Yuan’s disciple. So, he was proud!

You struck Elder Ye’s disciple and want to brush it over with a mere apology?

Dream on!

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept and he said, “Who else did it?”

“Martial Uncle Lin, I’m sorry!”

“I-I’m sorry!”

… …

Those who did it just now all came over to apologize very conscientiously.

When it was over, Ye Yuan said to Lin Lan, “Go and invite Elder Luo over! Those who beat you, hand them over to the Punishment Hall to wait for sentencing!”

Lin Lan chuckled and received the order and left.

The pain on his body immediately lessened significantly.

The expressions of Wu Chengchao and the rest all became extremely grim.

Luo Yunqing was in charge of the Punishment Hall now. His relationship with Ye Yuan was good until they could wear a single pair of trousers. So how could they have a good outcome?

They already apologized and actually still had to be handed over to the Punishment Hall!

Elder Ye was really ruthless!

And right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly took out another Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

Everyone’s eyes turned sharp, looking over.

Their bodies were very honest!

“You all look carefully. What’s the difference between this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill and ordinary ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills?” Ye Yuan said.

Just now, everyone only saw the ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill and did not look closely.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, everyone could not help sizing it up carefully.

Upon looking, everyone really found it unusual.

“Although this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is ninth grade, the light doesn’t seem to be dazzling, but much more restrained instead! C-Could it be that this is …”

After Wu Chengchao sized it up carefully, he suddenly thought of something and could not help looking at Ye Yuan with a shocked expression on his face.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “At least you, this grade three heavenly alchemist, have some knowledge. That’s right, it’s a grand completion ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! Therefore, you tell me whether cultivating the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is useful or not?”

“G-Grand completion ninth grade!”

“The legendary grand completion ninth grade! There … There’s actually really someone who can reach this level!”

“No wonder! No wonder Elder Ye can cultivate the heavenly imperial pill! So that’s how it is!”

… …

All of the heavenly alchemists were shocked until they could not close their mouths.

Only then did they know what Ye Yuan relied on to refine the heavenly imperial pill!

While Wu Chengchao had an embarrassed look as he said with a bitter smile, “Elder Ye, but this grand completion ninth grade isn’t what anybody can achieve! Is spending so much time on a basic heavenly pill really worth it?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a look of disgust, “That’s why you’re not as good as Qin Shun! For so many years, the feeling of being suppressed by Qin Shun that old fellow must feel great, right?”

The moment Wu Chengchao heard, he said in a great rage, “Elder Ye, you’re actually comparing me to that scumbag!”

Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “Irrespective of character, only in terms of refining pills, he’s indeed much stronger than you! Do you know what’s the difference between you guys?”

Wu Chengchao reined in his expression and said seriously, “I naturally know. My foundation is not as good as his! But he comes from the Pill Alliance! Although I went to the Pill Alliance, I couldn’t come into contact with their core cultivation methods at all!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “So, I sent Lin Lan to go and help you all consolidate your foundations, and yet you all beat him until like this?”

Wu Chengchao’s old face turned red and he blushed with shame as he said, “W-Wasn’t it because this old man was unaware? Elder Ye, this old man is completely convinced by you! This Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, you can actually cultivate it to the legendary grand completion ninth grade! Then … can you …”

“Can’t!” Ye Yuan said with decisiveness that could chop iron.

Everyone’s expressions changed, secretly regretting immensely.

This time, they offended Elder Ye badly!

However, the heavenly alchemists present were really wholeheartedly convinced by Ye Yuan!

Although ninth grade golden pill and grand completion ninth grade golden pill were both ninth grade, they were two completely different concepts.

Ninth grade golden pill, someone had reached it before.

Grand completion ninth grade only existed in the legends!

But Elder Ye relied on his four-point affinity aptitude, and he actually reached the grand completion realm of ninth grade!

This already could not be described using monstrous! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Starting from now, all of you be more obedient! Whoever cultivates the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to ninth grade first, will be awarded one pill! If you can’t do it, forget about it!”

“What?! Ninth grade? Elder Ye, are you trying to take our old lives?” When the group of heavenly alchemists heard that, they immediately cried of excruciating suffering.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Of course, you all can also don’t practice. You can naturally forget about that Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill too.”

As he said, he threw the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill in his hand to Wen Jingxuan and said, “Eat it, continue refining!”

When everyone saw this scene, their eyeballs were almost popping out.

Wu Chengchao said in a great rage, “Elder Ye! You … You’re biased!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “I’m biased, so what? My disciple, I’ll give her however many I want to! Furthermore, you rest assured. Jingxuan and Lin Lan’s training is absolutely a hundred times crueler than yours! I, Ye Yuan, don’t have any shortcuts when refining pills. It’s just practice! If a hundred times won’t do, a thousand times! If a thousand times won’t work, ten thousand times! Ten thousand times don’t work, 100 thousand times! A million times! All the way until you master it!”

Seeing the serious expression on Ye Yuan’s face, everyone’s expressions could not help turning somber, revealing a look of admiration.

Only then did they know that Ye Yuan’s success was not accidental!

Suddenly, a dozen over figures fell from the sky, Luo Yunqing had arrived!

Wu Chengchao’s expression changed, and he begged, “Elder Ye, I, Old Wu, know that I was wrong! Spare me this time around, alright?”

But Luo Yunqing blocked in front of him and said coolly, “Although Elder Ye’s cultivation realm is low, his significance to the sect is tremendous! Sect Master has already ordered it. Those who disrespect Elder Ye will be punished severely! According to sect rules, those who offend elders, 100 strikes of the rod and paraded in public for three days! Come, men! Bring away!”

Finished saying, the members of the Punishment Hall gave no chance to explain too, directly taking everyone away by force.

“Elder Ye, I really know that I was wrong!”

“Elder Ye, spare us this time around?”

… …

Wails of doom filled the sect immediately.
