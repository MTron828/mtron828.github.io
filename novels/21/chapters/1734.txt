Chapter 1738 Clay Chickens and Pottery Dogs

With one seal, Luo Yong was heavily injured and dying!

With Ye Yuan’s realm getting higher and higher, the power of the Nirvana Seal also grew with each passing day.

Back then, when Ye Yuan just entered Third Firmament Divine Vortex, his strength already surpassed the Sixth Firmament Divine Lord Xiahou Yun.

Now, he already reached peak Third Firmament Divine Vortex. Strength like Luo Yong’s was not worth mentioning at all in front of him.

What was laughable was that he even provoked Ye Yuan along the way.

Getting hit by the Nirvana Seal, Luo Yong’s vitality was rapidly fading away, his eyes full of disbelief.

He knew that Ye Yuan was very strong, but he never thought that when Ye Yuan fought with the bug king, it was actually not his full strength yet!

A body cultivator?

It was simply a joke!

How could he know that back then Yuan was just restricted by all sorts of conditions? It was not convenient to kill the bug king; that was all.

What was exhibited was naturally not his true strength.

At this time, the others also stopped fighting, looking over toward this side in surprise.

Qi Dongyu’s expression was very ugly. His saber actually could not even touch the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves!

Spatial law!

Was this kid a freak?

How could he comprehend such a mysterious power of law?

“E-Elder Brother Qi, s-save me!” Luo Yong used the last of his strength and shouted.

Qi Dongyu’s expression changed several times. Suddenly, he said savagely, “You damn thing, to actually dare scam me! Go and die!”

Finished talking, Qi Dongyu swung the great ringed saber, a streak of saber light cleaved over.

The pitiful Luo Yong was directly cleaved into two.

Before dying, he was still hoping for Qi Dongyu to save me. Who knew that Qi Dongyu gave him a slash with a backhand.

Qi Dongyu ended Luo Yong with one saber, cupped his fists at Ye Yuan, and said with a smile, “Haha, Little Brother, misunderstanding, it’s all a misunderstanding! This Luo Yong was clearly making use of me. I hpe that Little Brother doesn’t take it to heart.”

This scene turned around too quickly, everyone was dumbstruck with astonishment.

This Qi Dongyu was also a little too shameless, right?

But in the Skydemon Mountain Range, this kind of thing would frequently happen. After the surprise, everyone felt at ease.

In this place, there were only eternal interests, no forever enemies.

Duan Peng also heaved a long sigh in relief. He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so powerful, one-shotting Luo Yong in one move.

Clearly, Qi Dongyu felt that he was not to be trifled with and shrink back.

Ye Yuan had been watching from the sidelines with cold eyes all along, watching Qi Dongyu perform.

But at this time, Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “Misunderstanding? I don’t think that it’s a misunderstanding! If my strength was lacking, the one lying on the ground right now would be me, isn’t it?”

Qi Dongyu said with an awkward look. “This ... This ... was really just a misunderstanding! Little Nrother, we wouldn’t reach a concord without discord. In the future, I, Qi Dongyu, will be making friends with you!”

Ye Yuan looked at Qi Dongyu and said with a smile that was not a smile: “Looks like you haven’t figured out the situation! Becoming friends with me, are you worthy?”

Qi Dongyu’s expression changed and his face turned sullen as he said in a solemn voice, “Brat, we’ll have a chance to meet again! In this Skydemon Mountain Range, everybody will meet sooner or later. Must you insist on fighting to the death? Your strength is pretty good, but we have four Sixth Firmament Divine Lords. If we really fight it out to the bitter end, it’s still unknown who lives and dies!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he smiled and said, “You’re really confident!”

Qi Dongyu smiled coldly and said, “Confident? Your father has roamed unobstructed in the Skydemon Mountain Range for so many years, how could I survive without a little confidence? Wang Xiao, looks like this little brother wants to test our skills. Attack together!”

Those three Sixth Firmament Divine Lords also gathered over when they heard that.

Duan Peng had just let out a sigh in relief, thinking that this matter was over. Did not expect that Ye Yuan actually refused to drop the matter!

Although Ye Yuan was very strong, fighting two-on-four was still too disadvantageous.

But at this time, his only option was to stand together with Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Boss Duan, you just watch by the side. Just a bunch of clay chickens and pottery dogs, this young master doesn’t pay any attention to them yet.”

Everyone was taken aback. Qi Dongyu let out a big laugh and said, “Hahaha, a fine clay chickens and pottery dogs! Your father wants to see if you have real skills or you’re bragging!”

Ye Yuan drew the Junyi Sword and said coolly, “Wouldn’t you know if you try it?”

While talking, an overpowering sword intent surged to the sky, his figure also became illusory.

Qi Dongyu’s countenance suddenly changed and he cried out, “Laws fusion!”

However, there was already no time for him to be shocked. Ye Yuan already rushed over.

Ye Yuan who displayed spatial law, how fast was his movements?

He did not employ the Spirit Concealing Sword at all. Ordinary laws fusion, the power was already exceedingly formidable.

Ye Yuan rushed into the midst of the four, akin to a tiger entering a flock of sheep, suppressing until the four people could not lift their heads at all.

In a blink, the four people’s bodies were all injured.

Ye Yuan caught a gap, thrust a sword out, and pierced over towards Qi Dongyu’s heart.

Qi Dongyu was greatly alarmed, wanting to dodge was already too late. He instinctively raised the great ringed saber to block.

Clank!

A crisp sound of metal clashing came over. Qi Dongyu’s pupils gradually widened, his vitality rapidly fading away.

Ye Yuan’s sword broke the great ringed saber into two, the remnant force not reducing, going straight into the heart.

“Do you think you’re clay chickens and pottery dogs or not?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The other three people gasped heavily for air, their bodies all sustaining considerable injuries, eyes full of horror.

This Third Firmament Divine Lord in front of them was too strong!

Strong until it made people despair!

Duan Peng watched until his face turned white and said in shock, “Qi Dongyu’s Ghost King Great Ringed Saber is a middle-grade divine lord mystic treasure. It ... It was actually cut in half by a sword!”

Although Ye Yuan’s sword was a high-grade divine lord mystic treasure, wanting to break a middle-grade divine lord mystic treasure was also not that easy.

One could imagine how powerful the force on Ye Yuan’s one sword was!

Ye Yuan put away the long sword. Qi Dongyu fell to the ground weakly and was already devoid of life.

How could Wang Xiao three people still dare to make a move? Directly kneeling down, he said with a mournful face, “Y-Your Excellency, spare our lives! This lowly one ... This lowly one had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai! I beg Your Excellency to spare our lives!”

Ye Yuan ignored them and said to Duan Peng, “Boss Duan, these people will be left to you to deal with.”

This kind of thing, Boss Duan was naturally the most adept.

He sized all of the things these people entered the mountain with, then directly made them get lost.

Since Ye Yuan left it to him to deal with, he naturally did not have the intention of killing anymore.

Duan Peng had lived for so many years, he could naturally perceive this.

Qi Dongyu’s party really acquired quite a number of good things. They could be sold at a high price. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Of course, these natural treasures, Duan Peng naturally let Ye Yuan have the first pick.

Regarding spirit medicines, Ye Yuan had always welcomed all that came. He picked some that he needed. But the rest, he did not take fancy to them.

Done with all this, only then, did everyone let out a sigh in relief. Gazes that looked at Ye Yuan again were already totally different.

Even Duan Peng, his eyes when looking at Ye Yuan was also full of awe.

“Alright, it’s also about time. The Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit is likely about to mature. Those Purple-eyed Devil Apes are probably unable to hold themselves back anymore. In a while, I’ll go lure the Purple-eyed Devil Apes away. You guys go and pick the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit and Green Vine Emerald Net Flower. Bring this powder on you. If those Darknight Poison Bats attack you guys, scatter this over, they won’t dare to get close.”

As he said, Ye Yuan fished out several packets of medicinal powder and threw it to the few people.
