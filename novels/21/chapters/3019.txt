Chapter 3018: Heaven One’s twilight!

Eastward, twilight.

On the city walls, Yang Qing was waiting with his legs crossed, eager for battle already.

It was just that the injuries all over his body and haggard look showed how dreadful his battle was.

“Ye Yuan this scoundrel, don’t know where he’s being carefree now either!?Tsk tsk,?when this punk returns and sees this seat’s current strength, he’ll definitely be shocked until his jaw will hit the ground! At that time, I’ll thrash him brutally. Who asked this guy to always stop me from posturing!?Mn,?it’s merrily decided like this!”

When his brain made up the image of pummeling Ye Yuan, the corners of Yang Qing’s mouth curled, very happy.

In a blink of an eye, more than a hundred years had passed. His cultivation realm rose quickly and already reached upper Emperor Vast Heaven!

Such a fast cultivation speed, it was rarely seen in the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven too.

The current Yang Qing had already grown into a war general of the Heaven One Alliance.

The Emperor Realm powerhouses that died under his name already reached more than a hundred. He could be said to have made brilliant achievements in war!

Of course, he paid a heavy price too.

During the past hundred years, he fought no idea how many times, got injured God knows how many times, and had died who knows how many times already.

“Tch,?with just the likes of you? Do you believe that when my Big Brother Ye Yuan comes back, he’ll be able to smack you flying with a slap?” By the side, Jingfei said disdainfully.

The current Jingfei’s strength could not be underestimated too. She had already stepped into the Emperor Realm.

And the Big Yellow beside her had already reached grand completion Emperor Cloud Heaven too.

“You lass, you’re clearly being stubborn! I admit that Ye Yuan is very formidable. He’s just a little worse than me. But, to say that he can catch up to me within a hundred years, I’m afraid that you don’t believe it too, right??Hahaha?…” Yang Qing said smugly.

Jingfei rolled her eyes and stopped talking.

Indeed, Yang Qing’s progress these few years was somewhat terrifying.

Jingfei also had no choice but to admire this guy’s monstrousness.

Yang Qing this guy was normally cheeky and frivolous, but his pride was actually really strong.

Ye Yuan’s existence was like a whip that continuously spurred him on.

Even if he was not here.

“If Young Master wants to thrash you, he doesn’t need to surpass you in cultivation realm. Therefore, you’re definitely not his match.” Big Yellow supplemented with a stab.

Yang Qing was indifferent and said with a sneer, “Just based on this sentence of yours, I’ll definitely beat him until he can’t get up!”

Right at this time, a voice sounded out at an inappropriate timing.

“You all are thinking too much. That brat has probably long died at some other planes! Furthermore, he’s humanity’s traitor. Even if he really returns, then he’s also our enemy! This seat will definitely finish him off for good!”

Swoosh!

Yang Qing’s spear tip was already pressed on the other person’s throat, and he said coldly, “Qing Shan, if you want to court death, try saying another word!”

Qin Shan smiled and said, “He’s a traitor. This is already the final verdict that the various Hegemons have concluded. Could it be that it can still be fake? Even if you kill me, it can’t change this fact too!”

“Big Brother Ye Yuan is not a traitor! He’s Heaven One Alliance’s great hero!” Jingfei said.

“Yes, I admit that he has done very great things! But, him being controlled by the blood race’s progenitor, this is an undeniable fact! It’s no use even if you guys deny it,” Qin Shan shrugged and said with a smile.

Back then, Qin shan was slapped time and again by Ye Yuan in the Extreme Medicine Sect. He was still very unhappy with Ye Yuan.

Now, the Absolute Heaven Barrier had already been breached and the Heaven One alliance was facing imminent danger. He had no choice but to go to the front line too.

The city where they were at was called West Sun City. It was a stronghold of the human race.

Ten years ago, the Absolute Heaven Barrier collapsed with a loud bang, several Hegemons fell, and Heaven One Alliance was in a precarious situation.

In ten years, the alliance’s defensive line fell back time and again, looking as if it was going to be a complete collapse.

West Sun City was one of the remaining strongholds.

Suddenly, one powerful aura after another approached from afar.

Yang Qing’s gaze turned cold, and he pulled back his spear and said in a solemn voice, “The blood race has come. There’s work to do again! Qin Shan, I hope that you die at the hands of the blood race.”

Qin Shan smiled and said, “You too!”

Yang Qing laughed and said, “What kind of desperate situation hasn’t you Grandpa Qing encountered before? With just the likes of this bunch of trash, they can kill me? Rather it’s you who’s too weak!”

Qin Shan’s mouth curled, and he stopped talking.

He knew that this guy was famous for being a cockroach.

Every time that he thought that he was dead, he came back again in the end!

When he was Emperor Cloud Heaven, Yang Qing was ambushed and besieged by more than ten Emperor Realm powerhouses. There was even an Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouse among them.

At that time, everyone thought that he was dead for sure. In the end, this guy was maimed and returned just like that with injuries all over his body, and he even carried a few heads in his hands.

After that battle, he also broke through the first seal in one go, breaking through to Emperor Vast Heaven!

Remembering when Yang Qing and Ye Yuan entered the sect back then, they were still both brats.

In a twinkle, Yang Qing’s cultivation was already on par with him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

How depressing!

Suddenly, a figure appeared on top of the city walls abruptly, standing with his hands behind his back, looking into the distance with tightly knitted brows.

Everyone bowed and said, “Paying respect to Hegemon Battlesky!”

“In this battle, the blood race has overwhelming momentum and power, their strength several times stronger than us! It looks like Hegemon Bufan their side has run into considerable trouble! Behind West Sun City are trillions of living beings. We cannot retreat. Has everyone prepared to fight to the death?” Hegemon Battlesky said in a solemn voice.

“Fight to the death without retreating!”

“Fight to the death without retreating!”

“Fight to the death without retreating!”

… …

Behind him, yells that shook the sky sounded out.

Hegemon Battlesky was precisely South Qi Giant City’s City Lord back then, Feng Xiaotian!

When Absolute Heaven Barrier was breached, he finally gained enlightenment on Dao, unlocking the third seal, becoming a Hegemon!

Now, he was also one of Heaven One Alliance’s leaders.

“Okay, this seat is going! I’ll leave the rest to you all!” Feng Xiaotian only left behind one sentence and left.

Everyone revealed serious expressions.

They knew that the situation that Hegemon Battlesky was facing was even harsher than theirs!

There were three blood race Hegemons that came this time!

“Kill!”

Yang Qing brandished his long spear and roared angrily, turning into a wisp of green smoke and rushed out.

It was only to see him taking the lead, clashing together with the blood race’s Emperor Realm powerhouses.

In a single exchange, three Emperor Cloud Heavens were directly one-shotted by him!

In the sky, powerhouses blotted out the sun!

However, the numbers on Heaven One were still far lacking.

Coupled with the blood race’s undying attribute, Heaven One this side fell into a disadvantageous position very quickly.

And this time, the Emperor Realm powerhouses that the blood race sent out were also several times more than Heaven One’s.

Although Yang Qing was strong, he got caught in the encirclement of many Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses very quickly.

“Hahaha,?you bunch of grandson, really too weak!”

“Too light. Are you scratching your Grandpa Qing’s itch?”

“Kill! Kill! Kill! You bunch of bloodsuckers, all die for Your Father!”

“Qin Shan, you’re too weak! Just how long has it been, and you already can’t make it? If I were you, I’d pray that Ye Yuan can descend from the sky with celestial soldiers right now!?Hahaha,?I say, if Ye Yuan saves you now, wouldn’t it be very ironic?”

… …

Yang Qing fought until heaven and earth dimmed, his two eyes bloodshot and the injuries on his body increasing continuously.

And not far away from him, Qin Shan’s strength was much weaker.

Under the heavy siege, he began faltering in strength very soon.

At this time, he already had half his body caved in, his appearance very miserable.

“Even if this seat dies, I don’t want to be saved by a traitor too!” Qin Shan roared angrily.
