“Heh heh, Ye Yuan, your alchemy skills are really divine! We’re walking openly in the city like this, and nobody recognizes us!” Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at Yang Qing and he said crossly, “I say, can you be low-profile or not? Do you know that there are Emperor Realm powerhouses nearby eavesdropping?”

Yang Qing said without a care, “What the hell do Emperor Realm powerhouses count for! I’ll be able to sweep away them before long!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance, his mouth curling as he said, “Is that so? If you’re so impressive, you must not need me to help you refine the Emperor Fate Pill.”

The moment Yang Qing heard, he immediately switched to a fawning expression as he said, “I’m saying, I’m so impressive, but isn’t it still all thanks to Master Ye? In the future, when I, Hegemon Azuresky, sweep across the world and reign supreme, you’ll be the father of the emperor!”

“Shut up!”

“Oh!”

Humph!

Just you be smug!

After Lord Qing, I, reach Hegemon Realm, I’ll definitely give you a good one!

At this time, Ye Yuan and Yang Qing two people had long already passed through the Absolute Heaven Barrier and arrived in a blood race city. The Blood Imitation Pill was a heavenly sovereign level pill. Yang Qing could naturally consume it too.

The two people swaggered through the streets but did not reveal the slightest flaw.

Of course, there also would not be bloodkins who would think that there were actually people who could completely imitate their aura.

This city was called Giant Net City, one of the blood race’s largest cities on Heaven One Continent.

Ye Yuan they all even obtained a piece of news. A new battle of sons selection would be carried out here.

The blood race would select new Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons and True Sovereign Hundred Sons every decade.

The most outstanding 200 bloodkins would be sent to the Blood God Temple and be heavily groomed. Wanting to investigate the blood race’s secret, entering the Blood God Temple was naturally the best choice.

However, the blood race’s present territory already occupied more than two-thirds of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Their clansmen were naturally a lot.

When Ye Yuan two people arrived outside the Absolute Heaven Barrier, they were completely stunned too.

The number of the blood race was seriously too many!

The scale of their one city was often three to five times that of a Heaven One city! It was not that the blood race was extravagant, but that without this scale, they could not accommodate so many clansmen at all.

The blood race propagated by splitting, the propagation speed extremely fast.

Ye Yuan two people estimated that the numbers of Heaven One’s races added up, probably could not even match up to a tenth of the blood race’s!

So many clansmen, no matter how low the chances of giving birth to powerhouses, the number could not be very low either.

The blood race had two Blood Emperor level cities in Heaven One Continent, Giant Net City was one of them.

Giant Net City would select 20 of the strongest people and send them to Thundercry Continent and Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City, to undergo the final hundred sons selection.

Ye Yuan two people were aiming for this.

The place to report was the battle hunting ground in the city.

This place had a large-scale grandstand and could accommodate hundreds of thousands of people!

At this time, all seats were occupied in the battle hunting ground.

Each period’s hundred sons battle was the gluttonous feast of the entire blood race. It could be said to be followed closely by all the people.

Therefore, the battle hunting ground’s tickets would be hiked to a sky-high price every time.

How many powerhouses were participating in Giant Net City’s selection?

Eight million Saint Sovereign Heavens!

One million True Sovereign Heavens! This number looked scary, but actually, it was nothing.

This selection had no threshold. Anyone could take part.

And the population that a Blood Emperor level city had jurisdiction over reached as high as several tens of billion!

Then why would the Saint Sovereign Heavens number just eight million?

Therefore, the majority of those who came to take part in the selection were very confident in themselves.

Actually, this kind of selection was a cruel trial in the first place.

Many Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons were originally unknown, but in this kind of cruel selection, they grew stronger the more they fought, ranking in the hundred sons in the end!

This kind of example was not in the minority.

Of course, this number was really frightening when placed in the Heaven One Alliance!

Over eight million Saint Sovereign Heavens, this was merely just the number in one Blood Emperor level city.

There were ten Blood Emperor level cities on Heaven One Continent. Then the other two continents?

Those two continents were two complete continents!

“Enter your name!”

“Name.”

“Bloodazure.”

The Saint Sovereign Heaven in charge of registration issued a wooden card to Yang Qing, engraving his name on it.” “Enter your name!”

“Name.”

“Bloodazure,” Ye Yuan said.

The registration person was taken aback and said, “You’re called Bloodazure too?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What’s the problem?”

The registration person shook his head and said, “No problem.”

Finished saying, he issued Ye Yuan a token too.

The blood race had a lot of people with the surname blood. There were naturally a lot of Bloodazure names too.

It was just that these two people were called Bloodazure at the same time. It made him very surprised.

One Saint Sovereign Heaven, one True Sovereign Heaven. Furthermore, it looked like they were on very good terms.

Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan hatefully, wishing to tear him to shreds.

This guy actually took on the same name as him!

For this, he even flew into a thunderous rage with Ye Yuan. But of course, he was still suppressed by Ye Yuan in the end.

Ye Yuan was Saint Azure back then. Now, when choosing a name, he naturally had to pick Bloodazure too.

As for Yang Qing, he had azure as his name to begin with. He naturally had to pick Bloodazure too.

Hence, two Bloodazures appeared.

Yang Qing shot Ye Yuan a hateful glare and said, “Punk, don’t fail to enter the top ten. You’ll disgrace Bloodazure this name!” Ye Yuan said coolly, “The one who should be worried should be you, right? If you can’t get a spot, scram back to your hometown for me!”

Yang Qing said with a cold smile, “What a joke! If this sovereign gets second place, I’ll immediately commit suicide!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Unfortunately, there are ten passageways. Otherwise, these ten spots, I’ll bag them myself.”

Failing to posture, Yang Qing was not willing to show weakness. He said, “Me too!”

These two people looked down on each other like nobody else was around, immediately drawing angry glares from a group of people.

These two … are too freaking arrogant!

Are you treating us as air?

“Huhu, what high-sounding sentiments! A grand completion True Sovereign Heaven, the other is even just upper Saint Sovereign Heaven, aren’t the two of you scared to sprain your tongue when talking big?” Behind the two, one person said with a cold laugh.

Ye Yuan turned his head to look at him and said coolly, “Talking big? Is a trash like you worthy of me talking big? Too narcissistic!”

Just who was the freaking narcissist?

That person smiled coldly and said, “Trash? Huhu, there has really never been anyone who dared to say that about me! You probably don’t know who I am, right?”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said coolly, “Not interested to know because that’s meaningless to me.”

“Huhu, reckless and blind thing, to not even know Brother Chou Yang! He has the strength to attempt for the hundred sons this time!”

“I wonder which countryside this fool is from, thinking that he can still be number one after arriving at Giant Net City!”

u

OT

“Hahaha, what a joke! The things that he said, Brother Chou Yang probably doesn’t even dare to say them. Stupidity is really the original sin!”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. After entering the passageway, he’ll be taught how to behave!”

……

Waves of mocking voices came from all around.

Although there were eight million Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, there were naturally quite a few who already had great fame too.

Chou Yang was one of them.

In Giant Net City, his strength was sufficient to rank in the top three. He was a strong contender for the slots this time. In reality, these ten spots were also probably being produced among those 20 to 30 people. Everyone had a score in their hearts. Even if there was a dark horse, it would also not be a measly little upper Saint Sovereign Heaven’s turn.
