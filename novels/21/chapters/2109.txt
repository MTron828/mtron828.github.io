Chapter 2113: Even if You’re a Heavenly Emperor, It Won’t Do Either!

A hint of disdain flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, the bone sword directly thrusting out.

A threat of death pounced from head-on.

Qi Zhen’s expression changed drastically. He did not think that Ye Yuan really dared to kill him.

Could it be that this guy did not care about the consequences?

Just as he thought that he was dead for sure, one fine blue thread after another blocked in front of Qi Zhen. Ye Yuan’s bone sword was actually unable to move an inch further.

The pupils of all the Empyreans present shrunk. That was the Dao mark, the hallmark of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

This kind of power was the might of heaven and earth, mortals were not able to resist it at all.

When Qi Zhen saw the Dao mark appear, he knew that Gongyang Lie would not passively watch him be killed, and he could not help being overjoyed.

With a Heavenly Emperor taking action, who else could kill him here?

Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold and he looked at Gongyang Lie and said in a solemn voice, “You want to stop me?”

Gongyang Lie bowed and said, “Lord Sacred Ancestor High Priest, Qi Zhen’s status in the Qilin Clan is extremely high. He can’t be killed! Once killed, it will surely attract the fierce retaliation of the Qilin Clan. At that time, even Sacred Ancestor High Priest might not be able to protect you too!”

When Qi Zhen heard that, he seemed to have grasped the final life-saving straw, roaring wildly: “Ye Yuan, I’m the Qilin Clan’s Alchemy Dao future, Ancestor Si Chen’s successor! If you dare to kill me, you’ll definitely regret it!”

Ye Yuan laughed coldly and said, “Really cannot change your nature! At this point, you still dare to threaten me?”

His gaze became cold, and he turned to Gongyang Lie and said icily, “When this sage is doing things, it’s not your turn to come and butt in! Do you really want to stop me?”

Gongyang Lie mused for a moment and finally sighed and said, “Lord Second Sage, I’m doing it for your own good. I also don’t wish for the demon race to fall into internal strife. Let Young Master Qi Zhen leave; this emperor will make my apologies to Lord Second Sage later.”

In Gongyang Lie’s view, killing Qi Zhen was a huge matter.

Once they provoked the Qilin Clan, they might come roaring into existence and make the entire Demon Divine Region fall into chaotic times.

Although Ye Yuan’s title of Second Sage was big, he was merely a True God Realm in the end.

Gongyang Lie’s respect was completely toward Sacred Ancestor High Priest, and it was not toward Ye Yuan.

Toward Ye Yuan himself, Gongyang Lie did not have too much awe and fear.

No matter how breathtaking Ye Yuan’s performance was, that was also just a genius that had yet to grow up.

He was on a different level from a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse like him in the end.

Ye Yuan laughed loudly. The aura on his body was surging to the sky.

However, in front of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s strength, Ye Yuan appeared so insignificant.

His bone sword was still unable to advance the slightest bit.

Gongyang Lie shook his head and said with a sigh, “Lord Second Sage, give up. The strength of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, you’re unable to imagine it! This emperor can’t watch you do the wrong thing and go beyond redemption.”

But right at this time, one fine blue thread after another crept out from Ye Yuan’s body.

Ye Yuan’s eyes also gradually became icy-cold.

Under the blue fine threads, Gongyang Lie’s power suddenly collapsed with a loud bang!

Gongyang Lie’s pupils constricted, wanting to make a move again, but it was already too late.

Puchi!

The bone sword directly pierced through Qi Zhen’s chest. Violent Sword Dao law destroyed Qi Zhen’s innards wantonly.

How powerful was Empyrean Realm? But in front of Dao marks, what did it count for?

Until death, Qi Zhen’s eyes opened wide, clearly not daring to believe everything happening before his eyes.

How could a True God Realm break through the Dao marks laid down by a Heavenly Emperor?

At this time, a trace of regret actually arose in his heart.

If he yielded to Ye Yuan, perhaps it would be a different outcome, right?

Pride, this thing, would really cause people’s death sometimes.

“This ... How is this possible? Lord Second Sage he ... actually broke through Lord Gongyang’s Dao marks!”

“What’s that on Lord Second Sage’s body? Could it be ... Dao marks too?”

“How can a True God Realm ... possibly use Dao marks? Could it be that my eyesight is failing?”

... ...

Inside the great hall, shocked voices linked up together.

The shock that the scene which happened just now brought to them was seriously too intense.

What crept out from Ye Yuan’s body were clearly Dao marks!

But why would Dao marks that even a half-step Heavenly Emperor powerhouse could not utilize appear on a True God Realm powerhouse?

But the one who was more shocked was Gongyang Lie.

He, as a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, naturally understood what Dao marks signified.

That was truly a power that belonged to Heavenly Dao!

Only by reaching the realm of Heavenly Emperor could one enter the Dao with their bodies and mobilize the might of heaven and earth to carry out attacks.

But, Ye Yuan, a mere True God Realm powerhouse actually grasped Dao marks? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This kind of thing was simply too outrageous to hear.

At this time, Ye Yuan took back the bone sword and slowly got up. The Dao marks on his body faded away like the tide.

His gaze was icy-cold. Gongyang Lie meeting eyes with him actually involuntarily shuddered.

What kind of look was this!

“You ... You actually grasped Dao marks! How is this possible?” Gongyang Lie looked at Ye Yuan and involuntarily asked.

His heart was completely being filled with questions at this time.

“If I, Ye Yuan, wants to kill people, no one can stop it! Even if you’re a heavenly emperor, it won’t do either!” Ye Yuan’s words seemed to freeze space.

The current Ye Yuan seemed to have become a different person.

The composure on his face had long already disappeared. What replaced it was iciness.

But different from the last time in the Ancient God Battlefield, the current Ye Yuan seemed to still have a trace of reason remaining.

With the lesson learned last time, Ye Yuan already did not dare to employ the power of Dao marks too much.

If not for Gongyang Lie taking action, he would not have utilized it either.

Gongyang Lie’s face changed, only then, waking up to reality.

A major issue happened!

“Ye Yuan!”

Gongyang Lie shouted coldly and said furiously, “You think that by calling you Second Sage, you can be lawless and unbridled? Do you know that you’ve caused huge trouble!”

Ye Yuan looked at Gongyang Lie coldly and said, “You think that I, Ye Yuan, can stand here and make you call me Second Sage, what I’m relying on is Sacred Ancestor High Priest? You’re wrong! It’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest who needs me, and it’s not me who needs Sacred Ancestor High Priest!”

“Arrogances! Truly wild arrogance! Even if you’re Second Sage, you also can’t compare to Sacred Ancestor High Priest! Furthermore, your action right now dragged the entire demon race into the water!” Gongyang Lie said in a great rage.

Ye Yuan continued icily, saying, “If the Qilin Clan comes, I’ll shoulder it alone! You don’t need to worry!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan flicked his sleeves and left, leaving behind the dumbfounded crowd.

No one thought that things would actually develop to such an extent.

The situation presently already reached the degree where it could not be salvaged.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s distant back view, Gongyang Lie could not help but smile bitterly.

He also did not expect that he personally took action and actually failed to stop Ye Yuan.

The Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred was indeed extraordinary!

... ...

Very soon, Qi Chen and the rest were informed of the news that Qi Zhen was killed, and they were naturally extremely alarmed and enraged.

“Xin Luo, this Empyrean is going to kill Ye Yuan right now. Don’t you stop me! Even if he’s the Second Sage, killing my Qilin Clan’s alchemy genius, he’ll also have to make amendments with death!” Facing Xin Luo, Qi Chen was in a towering rage.

Who knew that Xin Luo just shook his head and smiled bitterly as he said, “I won’t stop you. It’s just that, I’m afraid that even if you go, you can’t kill Lord Second Sage either!”
