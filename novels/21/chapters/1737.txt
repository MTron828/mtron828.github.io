Chapter 1741 Leaving Alone

Ye Yuan did not say a word and swallowed the medicinal pill.

Raging spiritual energy was instantly converted into divine essence, pouring into the divine vortex.

Bang!

The divine vortex within Ye Yuan’s body started quaking once more.

Not only did his divine vortex not become bigger, but it also shrunk up even more under some kind of mysterious force instead.

Around Ye Yuan, spiritual energy surged crazily, bolts of blue lightning flashing around him intermittently, looking very astonishing.

This medicinal pill was called Dark Fragrance Concentration Pill, a pill formula in Immortal Grove’s hands. The medicinal effect was extremely strong.

It was just that the Netherworld Dark Fragrance Flower was too rare, so this pill formula was virtually useless.

Ye Yuan reached peak Third Firmament Divine Vortex in the first place and was only a step away from Fourth Firmament Divine Vortex. Now, under the impact of this colossal spiritual energy, Ye Yuan’s breakthrough happened without extra effort.

As if sensing Ye Yuan’s steadily rising aura, the Purple-eyed Devil Ape pounced over toward Ye Yuan once more.

This Purple-eyed Devil Ape was clearly very intelligent and was able to sense Ye Yuan’s might.

Now, seeing that his breakthrough was near at hand, it decided to interrupt his breakthrough!

The expressions of Duan Peng and the rest changed. Duan Peng warned in a loud voice, “Brother Ye, be careful!”

At this time, the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s eyes were purplish-red, looking incomparably demonic.

His speed and power seemed to be even greater than before!

In a blink, a punch arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape bellowed wildly to no end, appearing very excited.

This punch landing, this damn human would definitely turn to ashes.

Because this human already did not have time to back down.

Bang!

“Ahh!”

A cry of surprise came from Duan Peng that side.

But the scene that followed left them dumbfounded with shock.

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s punch going down, Ye Yuan was safe and sound. But it was akin to being struck by lightning, directly being blasted far away.

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape fell to the ground, twitching non-stop. There were still some blue lightning dancing on its body.

Duan Peng and the rest exchanged glances, looking at this scene in disbelief, dumbfounded looks on their faces.

“W-What happened? Why did the Purple-eyed Devil Ape fall by itself?”

“Don’t know! The power of that punch just now was so strong, but it seemed like it smashed on his own body.”

“Brother Ye is really too strange! When breaking through, one actually can’t get close to him?”

...

In the midst of everyone’s shocked gazes, Ye Yuan’s aura finally climbed to the peak, and broke through the bottleneck of Fourth Firmament Divine Vortex in one go! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The current Ye Yuan was akin to a different person than before!

Ye Yuan breaking through a minor realm, the amount of spiritual energy required was more than several dozen times of ordinary martial artists.

Breaking through a stag this time, it was even more of thick accumulations erupting.

How much stronger was his aura compared to before?

Even separated so far away, Duan Peng and the rest could also feel Ye Yuan’s might.

Duan Peng’s face changed slightly and he said, “So strong! I feel like if he wanted to kill me now, just twitching his fingers will do!”

The others nodded silently, clearly agreeing to this very much.

Even Duan Peng had this feeling, let alone them.

Ye Yuan walked to the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s side slowly. The Purple-eyed Devil Ape was still twitching on the ground currently. He said coolly, “I know that you can understand me. This matter was indeed our fault, so I won’t kill you. Go.”

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape twitched twice before crawling to its feet with some difficulty and knelt down very human-like, and kowtowed toward Ye Yuan. Clearly, it was thanking his grace of not killing it.

The purple light in the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s eyes already completely faded. But it also seemed to have suffered a serious illness, aura diminishing drastically.

Duan Peng and the rest also came over and was very perplexed by Ye Yuan’s way of doing things as one asked, “Brother Ye, he almost killed us just now. Why let him go?”

One had to know, when Ye Yuan killed Luo Yong and Qi Dongyu previously, he was not as softhearted as now.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “All lives have spirituality. Those who should be killed should be killed, while those who shouldn’t be killed shouldn’t be killed. It guarded the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit for many years but was snatched away by us. If we commit anymore killing sin, it goes against nature and reason. Leave a ray of hope when conducting oneself.”

The few people exchanged glances, uncertain what it meant.

Ye Yuan waved his hand, the Purple-eyed Devil Ape was akin to being granted amnesty, immediately sprinting away.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s decision, Duan Peng and the rest naturally did not dare to have the least bit of objection. He had an excited look as he said, “Brother Ye’s strength is truly inconceivable! This trip, if not for you, the few of us would probably have died until not even dregs remain! This Duan thanks Brother Ye’s life-saving grace here! These Silverwing Earthspirit Fruits and Green Vine Emerald Net Flowers, please accept them.”

As he said, Duan Peng handed a storage ring over.

Ye Yuan smiled and pushed the storage ring back and said coolly, “A man’s promise cannot be taken back once made, how can I go back on my word now? These things, the few of you divide them.”

Duan Peng had a difficult look as he said, “Brother Ye, I don’t have other intentions, I just ... I just feel apologetic.”

Ye Yuan said, “I’ve received your goodwill, but I have my own principles. These things, I won’t accept them.”

Actually, these two spirit medicines, Ye Yuan was naturally not indifferent to them.

It was just that he had his own principles. Previously, in order to made Duan Peng they all go to the Evil Water Ravine, since he made the promise, he would not go back on it.

Moreover, these few years, Ye Yuan followed Duan Peng they all and also pretty much inquired about some of the Skydemon Mountain Range’s things.

These spirit medicines, just take it as remuneration.

Duan Peng said with vicissitudes of emotion, “Brother Ye is truly trusting. This Duan has traversed in this Skydemon Mountain Range for many years, what I learned was all mutual suspicion and deception. Meeting Brother Ye today, I’m truly ashamed!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Everyone’s standpoint is different. In this Skydemon Mountain Range, wanting to live naturally can’t dispense with mutual suspicion and deception. If I were here, I might not be better than Brother Duan.”

At this time, Yu Jing came up and said, “Brother Ye, you’re really different from the average person!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Alright, this trip is done. Everyone, I’ll say goodbye here then.”

Yu Jing’s face changed and she said in surprise, “You’re not going back with us?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I’m making a trip to the Demon God Plain and won’t be going back with you all.”

Duan Peng said in surprise, “Brother Ye, the Demon Divine Region is abnormally perilous and there are countless great demons. It’s too dangerous for you to head there alone!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I naturally know this. But I have reasons that I must go. Elder Sister Jing, after you go back, let your brother eat these spirit medicines. In less than half a month, he’ll sure be cured. At that time, you’ll be able to return to your hometowns.”

Hearing the news that Ye Yuan was going to leave, her heart seemed to be pricked by something.

But so many years of making a living in the Skydemon Mountain Range, Yu Jing was no longer that kind of young girl anymore.

She forcefully held back years, gave Yu Jing a salute with her hands folded at the lower right side, and said, “Many thanks for Brother Ye Yuan’s great kindness. Elder Sister Jing will definitely remember it well!”

Ye Yuan smiled and bade farewell to everyone.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s back view vanish into the dense forest, Duan Peng sighed and said, “Sister Jing, Brother Ye he ... is destined to be someone that doesn’t belong in the same world as us!”
