Chapter 2748: First Taste of Defeat!

Many people were unconvinced and also tested their abilities.

But, without exception, it was virtually the conclusion of being one-shotted.

Only Big Yellow lasted more than ten moves.

For a moment, the confidence of the group of Jade Sovereign Heavens and Saint Sovereign Heavens were beaten down to the extreme.

“Younger Brother Ye, you come and try?” Saint Exalt Waycloud gave a look and said.

Ye Yuan was the one who proposed to cultivate. In the end, in this current situation, there was no way to cultivate at all!

They wanted to see how Ye Yuan would cultivate.

In reality, they did not harbor much hope for Ye Yuan’s combat power.

Ye Yuan killing an upper Jade Sovereign Heaven with one sword, it relied more on the advantage of his weapon.

How powerful could a grade four heavenly alchemist be?

Ye Yuan just smiled and returned to the first cultivation room.

He was not long-winded either, directly choosing the 100th place Sun Qi.

When everyone saw the situation, they could not help exchanging glances.

This guy was also too confident, right?

Sun Qi’s illusion appeared again. He looked at Ye Yuan and could not help frowning slightly as he said, “Jade Sovereign Heaven? Really weak!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Weak or not, you’ll only know after fighting.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan pointed his finger, 16 transformed flying swords emerged with a howl.

Sun Qi’s eyes lit up and he said with a light smile, “A little interesting!”

While speaking, Sun Qi also pointed at the void. A long sword was condensed out of thin air.

Sun Qi was at the level of achieving Great Dao Transformation too!

“Great Dao Transformation! Fine lad! No wonder Younger Brother Ye is brimming with confidence! I didn’t expect that he’s actually a transformation powerhouse! Furthermore, he has already metamorphosed to the third form!”

“Alchemy Dao is so monstrous; I didn’t expect that his Martial Dao is so terrifying too!”

“Looks like he wants to sharpen himself and improve his Great Dao Transformation to the fourth form!”

“I’m afraid that it’s not that easy! Three laws transformation, wanting to improve it is far too difficult!”

When everyone heard that, they all nodded their heads.

In reality, the majority of the Saint Sovereign Heavens present were amazingly talented individuals.

Otherwise, they would not have been able to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven either.

There were many among them who had once grasped Great Dao Transformation.

But, the further back Great Dao Transformation was, the more difficult the metamorphosis would be.

The comprehension difficulty of rule power was an inverted pyramid.

The further up, the difficulty would increase exponentially.

Reaching True Sovereign Heaven, wanting to comprehend an equivalent level of rank six rule power was simply harder than ascending to heaven.

Compared to the increase in cultivation realm, the comprehension of rule power was undoubtedly more difficult.

The increase in realm could be assisted with heavenly pills, and there was also the augmentation of cultivation method.

A good cultivation method could yield twice the results with half the effort in cultivation.

But the power of rules depended completely on a martial artist to comprehend little by little and accumulate bit by bit. Another way was for it to be comprehended in the middle of battle.

Comprehending the power of rule was difficult to begin with.

And comprehending the power of rule to reach the extent of obtaining Heavenly Dao’s recognition, was even more doubly difficult.

Especially when it reached the fifth level, the comprehension of rules was even difficult to the extreme.

Therefore, these people simply gave up.

Rather than using a low-level form of Great Dao Transformation, it was more powerful to use cultivation realm and act in concert with the power of rules.

From Sublime Realm to Sovereign Realm, it was a huge leap to begin with.

One law transformation was already extremely difficult, let alone three laws transformation.

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s approach was completely wasting time in the eyes of these people.

In a blink, Ye Yuan already exchanged several dozen moves with Sun Qi.

This kind of combat power also left everyone in great shock.

However, after several dozen moves, Ye Yuan’s signs of defeat also gradually became visible.

Sun Qi was well-deserving of being in the top 100 in the history of the Labyrinth Divine Palace. His combat power was formidable to the extreme.

Furthermore, there were four light halos on the hilt of his sword, which also showed that he was at the fourth form!

Ye Yuan also felt the pressure, his opponent’s strength was really too strong.

Sun Qi was just a one law transformation, but he specialized in one path and walked very far in Sword Dao.

His combat power overwhelmed Ye Yuan until he could not catch his breath.

Pffft! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After a hundred moves, Sun Qi finally found a tiny opportunity in Ye Yuan’s sword formation and pierced through Ye Yuan’s chest with a sword.

Ye Yuan was defeated!

Sun Qi’s figure did not dissipate immediately, but he said to Ye Yuan, “You’re very strong! After your Great Dao Transformation breaks through to the fourth form, I won’t be your match! However, I wasn’t outstanding when at Jade Sovereign Heaven. I truly became powerful after becoming the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s disciple! However, I’m very much looking forward to fighting with you again after you break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Everyone was stunned. It turned out that what Ye Yuan said was true!

The lowest threshold for entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace was Saint Sovereign Heaven!

This kind of powerful sect, which of the disciples that could enter it was not an amazingly talented person?

Ye Yuan was actually able to fight to this extent with a top 100 powerhouse!

This also proved indirectly that Ye Yuan’s strength was powerful!

Which was also to say that if they encountered Ye Yuan in the same rank, they could only be thrashed!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned slightly dark and he said with a nod, “After I break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, I’ll definitely come here again!”

Coming all the way, Ye Yuan crushed his peers and jumped realms to challenge.

This was still his first time being defeated at the hands of a martial artist at the same rank.

Ye Yuan had a level-headed disposition and it was naturally not that he could not accept this result.

But this defeat also stoked his competitive spirit again!

This match earlier, he had been in a situation of passively taking a beating all along, starting from the first move.

Being able to last a hundred moves, it was completely by relying on his keen fighting instincts.

If it were others, even if they comprehended three laws transformation, it was likely hard to last 30 moves too!

The opponent was powerful until it was suffocating!

This cultivation room could record down the strongest form of disciples and project them.

Killing their way into the top hundred in history, each of these people was powerful to the extreme.

Because this cultivation room only recorded the top 1000!

Future generation disciples would continuously refresh and eliminate their seniors, leaving their figures in here.

Those able to get left behind were all experts among experts, geniuses among geniuses!

In reality, Ye Yuan being able to last until now with three laws transformation was already a miracle.

But what he wanted was not this!

So what if Labyrinth Divine Palace?

So what if being among the top hundred in history?

He, Ye Yuan, would never admit defeat!

Not as good as you, then I’ll cultivate until I defeat everybody!

Sun Qi nodded slightly and said, “Are you still coming?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head. Swallowing a heavenly pill, his injuries recovered rapidly.

He did not hesitate either, leaping and entering the training ground again.

“Younger Brother Ye’s fighting instinct is terrifyingly strong! Even if cultivation and rules are the exact same as his, wanting to win him is immensely difficult too!” Saint Exalt Purplesun said with a solemn expression.

It was not that he had not seen geniuses before.

But he had really not met a genius like Ye Yuan before.

Those present were not rookies, but old fellows who had lived to a ripe old age.

When Ye Yuan was at 30 moves, signs of defeat were already revealed. But he forcefully lasted a hundred moves!

Not everyone could achieve this sort of thing.

Waycloud nodded and said, “This guy is simply born for battle! When Sun Qi was at the 43rd move, I thought that Ye Yuan would definitely lose.. Who knew that he actually utilized spatial rule to dodge it! This kind of application is simply brilliant to the max! If it’s off by a tiny bit, it won’t work no matter what! This guy’s potential is too great!”
