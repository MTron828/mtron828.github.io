Chapter 2888 Swindling!

Swoosh!

The blood essence flashed and disappeared, and Ye Yuan’s heart also tensed up along with it.

However, on the surface, Ye Yuan did not have any fluctuations.

There was still a Hegemon Realm beside him!

A wisp of his Dao sword was stored in the blood essence.

Once the blood essence entered the Chaos Bloodstone, Ye Yuan felt as if his Dao sword had entered a terrifying forcefield.

From all directions, a monstrously terrifying pressure crushed toward him.

The Chaos Bloodstone was too terrifying!

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, his entire being seemingly being stared at by some kind of great terror.

An inexplicable power swept through his body without restraint.

Ye Yuan felt as if every hair on his body was standing on end.

This kind of feeling virtually suffocated him.

He knew that this was the Chaos Bloodstone observing him!

He did not dare to make the slightest movement. His entire person seemingly turned to stone.

In front of the Chaos Bloodstone, Ye Yuan was just like an invisible man, without the slightest secrets to speak of.

One breath!

Two breaths!

Three breaths!

That inexplicable power finally receded like tidewater.

Three short breaths of time, but Ye Yuan felt like as long as a century had passed.

In front of this level of power, all struggle was futile.

“Pffft!”

Ye Yuan tasted sweetness in his throat, and he could not bear this enormous pressure, directly spewing out a mouthful of blood.

The current Ye Yuan, his entire body seemed to have been hauled out of the water, feeling a transcendence of having died once.

He knew that he had finally cleared this hurdle!

He had deceived the Chaos Bloodstone!

“You a-actually really deceived it!” There was also intense shock in Mi Tian’s eyes.

In front of absolute strength, all schemes and intrigues were pointless.

But Ye Yuan’s scheme succeeded!

Too inconceivable!

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Although this damn thing is formidable, it’s still sleeping! Many things, he’s judging by relying on instinct! If he really wakes up, it will really be impossible to deceive him!”

Mi Tian had a speechless look as he said in shock, “How did you do it?”

Ye Yuan knew what he was asking.

That drop of blood essence was not Ye Yuan’s!

Since it was not Ye Yuan’s, then the aura would naturally be different.

The Chaos Bloodstone was the blood race’s mother stone. How could it possibly deceive his probing? But Ye Yuan did it!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Very simple. That drop of blood essence has already been altered by me! The aura on it is completely my Dao sword’s aura! And every drop of blood in my body contains the aura of the Dao sword! That damn thing judges based on aura. He’s naturally unable to differentiate.” Mi Tian had a dumbfounded look. The blood race’s blood essence was actually altered?

However, to Ye Yuan, simulating all the blood essence in his body into the aura of that drop of blood essence, this was something as hard as ascending to heaven.

But, if it was just altering that drop of blood essence, it was not impossible.

In reality, this was just one of Ye Yuan’s research into the blood race’s blood essence.

Ye Yuan was very proficient in refined operations.

Therefore, his control over Dao had long already become subtle and exquisite. He used the power of the Dao sword and completely wiped away the aura of the blood essence’s master and imprinted the aura of the Dao sword on it.

This way, the blood essence still maintained the characteristics of the blood race, but judging from the aura, it was already exactly the same as Ye Yuan.

The reason why he did such an experiment was naturally in order to deal with an unexpected probing too.

Entering the blood race’s territory, he might not be able to avoid running into all kinds of inspections.

This kind of means would be able to smoke his way through.

Either way, he had a lot of blood essence on hand and could convert them casually.

The blood race naturally did not expect that there was actually someone who could preserve the blood race’s blood essence and carry out research.

The Chaos Bloodstone could intuitively sense that drop of blood essence that fused into the Chaos Bloodstone.

But, to Ye Yuan’s main body, he could only feel it through aura.

The aura was the same, so it naturally passed!

Mi Tian was dumbfounded when he heard it. There was still such an approach?

The heavenly alchemists were really amazing!

He could even think of this kind of experiment?

This was really a terrifying profession!

“C-Consider yourself ruthless! But, kid, you really did something remarkable! Come one day, when your strength becomes powerful and detonates the Chaos Bloodstone’s Dao sword, that damn thing will probably cry!” Mi Tian said with enthusiasm.

This wisp of Dao sword clone would lie dormant in the Chaos Bloodstone.

One day, when the power of the Dao sword reached a certain level, it would give this Chaos Bloodstone a deadly blow!

Thump!

Suddenly, the Chaos Bloodstone’s beating became hastened.

A blood-colored streak flew straight for Ye Yuan.

Ye Wugui’s gaze turned intent, his gaze having indescribable shock!

“This … This …”

Ye Yuan also jumped in fright. What was this damn thing trying to do?

“Kid, this is blood origin. This is good stuff, hurry up and accept it! That damn thing has acknowledged you!” Mi Tian urged.

Ye Yuan was shocked inwardly, allowing that wisp of blood light to smash into his body without avoiding it.

But, the moment this trace of origin entered his body, Ye Yuan’s Dao sword immediately operated, completely suppressing it.

This was the Chaos Bloodstone’s reward. It was naturally impossible to be too powerful. It was just for the sake of helping Ye Yuan comprehend origin. That was all.

Otherwise, Ye Yuan would be directly blown up by the origin power.

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s Dao sword suppressed it easily.

By the side, Ye Wugui was already completely stunned.

The Chaos Bloodstone actually rewarded Ye Yuan with blood origin?

This … This was too much!

Even he, this Hegemon Realm, never got rewarded with blood origin!

This stretch of nothingness was teeming with the power of origin.

The beating of the Chaos Bloodstone was a manifestation of origin power in the first place.

Comprehending origin here would yield twice the results with half the effort.

But, no matter how one comprehended origin, it was also not as good as being rewarded blood origin!

This blood origin was the foundation of the Chaos Bloodstone!

Unless it was unavoidable, even if it was Lord Wang Zuo, it would be impossible to get any too.

Now, it was actually rewarded to a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Genius!

A peerless genius! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A genius who shocked the world!

My blood race would surely rise up across the heavens!

33 Heavens, every heaven and myriad worlds, tremble!

This boy will let you all understand what is called despair!

Ye Wugui shouted in his heart.

This was the voice currently in his heart. Being bestowed the origin of blood at Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm, this sort of thing was simply unheard of!

“Bloodazure, this is the mother stone’s reward to you! It looks like he approves greatly of your bloodline too! With this trace of blood origin, it’s enough for you to be invincible among your peers! In the future, stepping into Hegemon Realm is virtually a certainty! In fact, you might be the myriad worlds’ number one Hegemon in the future! You have to cherish it well!” Ye Wugui said excitedly.

“The myriad worlds’ number one Hegemon!”

Ye Yuan had a ‘look of intoxication’ too and said with lofty sentiments, “City Lord, rest assured. Bloodazure definitely won’t let down the clan’s and Mother Stone’s trust! i’ll lead the blood race and trample Heaven One Continent flat, sweeping across the heavens and myriad worlds!”
