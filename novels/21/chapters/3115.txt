Chapter 3114: Dao Driving Origins!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Terrifying pressure completely separated Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and the blood race.

The area of the apocalyptic tribulation was extremely vast. It formed a natural protective barrier between the two.

Very clearly, Ye Yuan was afraid that when he was overcoming the tribulation, Progenitor Bloodstone would deal a killing blow to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

The present Progenitor Bloodstone, apart from the apocalypse, he swept away the current era!

But this way, he had no route of retreat too!

!!

Once he could not withstand the apocalyptic tribulation, the world behind him would be completely destroyed!

Apocalyptic tribulation was not said for fun.

This was cutting off all means of retreat: either win or die trying!

“Grand Brightjade will live or die with me! Are you all willing!” Ye Yuan shouted loudly without even turning his head back.

“We’re willing!”

Virtually without thinking, everyone answered.

This was their only chance to live!

When Progenitor Bloodstone saw this scene, his expression turned dark.

Just now, he did indeed plan on slaughtering the people of a world while Ye Yuan was transcending the tribulation, interrupting Ye Yuan’s transcending of the tribulation.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan was so ruthless, directly tying the people of this world together with him.

But that was fine. The difficulty of Ye Yuan’s tribulation would be greater!

Crack! Crack!

A few more claps of thunder sounded out, Heavenly Dao seemed to be expressing its dissatisfaction towards him.

Ye Yuan’s actions and conduct was simply looking down on Heavenly Dao!

Amidst the chaos, dark clouds rolled. Lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled. It was as if it was the end of the world.

“Noisy!”

Ye Yuan frowned slightly and suddenly slammed a punch out!

This punch was akin to flood dragons heading out to the sea. The power of the Four Symbols surged forward, rushing straight up to the clouds.

Yi Xue’s pupils constricted slightly, revealing shock.

The power of this punch was already infinitely close to Great Beyond Realm!

Even if it was a Supreme Hegemon, they would also be one-shotted under this punch.

Compared to the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven battle back then, the current Ye Yuan was no idea how many times stronger than before!

It was as if Heaven sensed Ye Yuan’s impudence. Countless electric snakes suddenly descended from the tribulation cloud.

That was the fury of Heavenly Dao!

The strength of these electric snakes could absolutely one-shot Supreme Hegemons!

The two formidable forces collided in an instant.

Boom!

Countless electric snakes were instantly annihilated!

This was not considered over yet. Ye Yuan’s fist force still had plenty left in the tank, rushing straight for the clouds.

Boom!

The tribulation cloud collapsed with a loud bang!

Before the first apocalyptic tribulation had formed, it was actually dispersed by Ye Yuan with one punch!

It was deathly silent all around. Everyone was shocked by Ye Yuan’s fearsomeness.

Before this, the apocalyptic tribulation was boasted to the max.

Everyone felt that the apocalyptic tribulation was powerful to the extreme.

But who knew that it actually could not block a punch from Ye Yuan?

“This … This is also too strong, right? Isn’t it said that the apocalyptic tribulation is very impressive?”

“I feel like Ye Yuan didn’t use his full strength at all. This apocalyptic tribulation doesn’t seem as impressive as in the rumors!”

“I feel the same too! I say, you guys, Ye Yuan wouldn’t really succeed in overcoming the tribulation, right?”

… . .

The blood race powerhouses could not help doubting the power of the apocalyptic tribulation.

Not that the apocalyptic tribulation was not strong, but that Ye Yuan was too casual, giving them a great shock.

Yi Xue gave a cold snort and said, “What the hell do you know! Although I am reluctant to admit it, Ye Yuan is indeed the number one divergent cultivator since ancient times! Before closed-seclusion, his strength was already stronger than the Mo Fan back then! This first wave of tribulation naturally can’t pose a threat to him. However, in the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse, each wave is more terrifying than the last! Very soon, you all will know the terror of this apocalyptic tribulation! Furthermore, this first wave of apocalyptic tribulation just now, the power already reached the level of Great Beyond! Can you all block it if you give it a try?”

Everyone stopped talking.

Indeed, this was just the first wave of apocalyptic tribulation, and the power already reached Great Beyond level.

Going further, the power would probably be beyond imagination.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, he could at least overcome seven waves of apocalyptic tribulation too.

This first wave was naturally somewhat inadequate. Very soon, the tribulation clouds that were scattered condensed anew.

That terrifying to the extreme pressure descended upon everyone’s hearts again.

But this time, the pressure was stronger!

“What a strong pressure! I almost can’t breathe anymore!”

“You all, look above that tribulation. There’s another layer of tribulation clouds condensing! This … is a double-layered tribulation cloud!”

“What terrifying power of origin! I feel like the power of that origin is already almost seeping out!”

… . .

The powerhouses in the world were dealing with the tribulation together with Ye Yuan.

They could distinctly feel Ye Yuan’s pressure.

That kind of horrifying pressure was at least ten times stronger than the one before!

When Long Jian saw that double-layered tribulation cloud, his expression was solemn as he said, “Xuan Taiqing, can you block this tribulation?’

Xuan Taiqing was a member of the Black Tortoise clan. His defense was extremely shocking.

But at this time, he shook his head and said, “Can’t block!”

Long Jian’s expression became even more serious, and he said, “This is just the second wave of tribulation, and it already has such power. Those at the back … are simply unimaginable!”

Xuan Taiqing nodded and said, “The strength division of Great Beyond Realm is very vague. If we divide our realm until Senior Mi Tian’s realm into nine stages, then the power of this second wave of apocalyptic tribulation has likely already reached the third stage! Even if you and I barely manage to block it, it will definitely be the outcome of severe injuries too!”

Swoosh!

While talking, Ye Yuan leaped up and charged to the sky.

Amidst the double-layered tribulation clouds, countless lightning fell down once again.

It was just that the bolts of lightning this time were two bolts intertwined together, falling down with a loud bang.

Compared to before, the power was simply poles apart.

Ye Yuan’s both hands went up. Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, four symbols divine beasts shot to the sky.

These four great divine beasts each occupied east, west, south, and north, one direction, the bloodline power in their bodies erupting. Endless saint force poured out, forming a massive barrier.

That scene was spectacular to the extreme.

When Progenitor Bloodstone saw this scene, his pupils constricted.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s origin of blood was actually so strong!

As the Heavenly Dao envoy who controlled the Great Dao of Blood, he was all too clear about the power of bloodlines.

Ye Yuan’s origin of blood was already infinitesimally close to Great Dao!

Furthermore, the path that Ye Yuan took was completely different from his.

His Dao revolved around slaughter, the brutal air being extremely strong.

But Ye Yuan’s origin of blood had a striking righteous air, being upright and just!

Progenitor Bloodstone obtained the four symbols bloodlines too. This also had a huge effect on him controlling the Great Dao of Blood.

But he could not harness the power of the four symbols at all.

However, Ye Yuan could!

The barrier formed by the power of the four symbols was extremely sturdy.

No matter how powerful those bolts of lightning were, it stood firm as a rock!

Long Jian and the others exchanged glances, seeing the shock in the other party’s eyes.

“I really didn’t expect that our four symbols bloodlines actually have such terrifying power when fused together!” Long Jian drew a deep breath and said.

Luan Qinghe said, “Ye Yuan’s bloodline power has already surpassed all of us! Only he can unleash the power of the four symbols bloodlines to the extreme! With this barrier, even if the apocalyptic tribulation is a hundred times stronger, he can block it too!”

Mi Tian nodded and said, “Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm isn’t high, his understanding of Dao has already reached an extremely profound level. He’s driving the power of origin with his own Dao sword! The Dao sword is his foundation! Cultivation realm is no longer important!”
