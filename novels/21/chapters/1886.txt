Chapter 1890: A Slight Hesitation and He’s Finished

“Mo Xin!”

Swoosh!

A middle-aged man following behind the young man suddenly attacked, kicking a foot onto Zuo Shujie’s chest.

Zuo Shujie spewed out a large mouthful of blood with a cough, figure flying out backward.

This follower had Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity cultivation realm. Dealing with the Second Firmament Celestial Deity Zuo Shujie was too easy.

Far away, when Ye Yuan saw this scene, his brows furrowed slightly.

Just now, Zuo Shujie and the rest called this young man patrolling inspector.

Could it be that Jiang Jadehall was already swapped out?

Ye Yuan knew that patrolling inspector this position was of little importance to imperial capitals.

Especially Southridge Ten Cities, this kind of small place, the opportunities were pitifully little.

If there wasn’t any major change, they normally would not swap out inspectors.

Furthermore, this young man looked young and even brought along a middle-stage Celestial Deity Realm follower. Logically speaking, he should have a lot of potential and status in the imperial capital. Why would he run to the Southridge Ten Cities to be a patrolling inspector?

“Lord Patrolling Inspector, you’re going too far!”

This young man’s action completely infuriated Coldfeather.

It was only to see him stand up swiftly and said with righteous indignation.

The young man looked at him and said with a cold snort, “Going too far? You country bumpkins don’t even understand the most basic etiquette. Since you all don’t know, then this envoy will teach you all! Mo Xin, this person was disrespectful toward this envoy. Kill him!”

Clank!

The sword edge left the sheathe, a streak of cold light flashed past, piercing straight at Coldfeather’s heart.

No one could have thought that the new patrolling inspector was actually so vicious, to kill people at a word of disagreement.

It was just that in front of a Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity, Coldfeather, this First Firmament Celestial Deity, did not have the slightest strength to resist at all.

Coldfeather’s pupils constricted, virtually forgetting to retaliate, only to see an edge gradually magnify in his pupils.

There was a series of exclamations all around, seemingly already seeing the scene of Coldfeather’s tragic death.

But right at this time, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Coldfeather.

It was only to see him flick two fingers. With a clank, the long sword in Mo Xin’s hand was directly flicked flying.

Mo Xin’s pupils shrunk, looking at that unfamiliar young man, full of apprehension.

“Ye Yuan! You ... You came back?”

“Ye Yuan! It’s really Ye Yuan!”

“Head Elder came back!”

...

When those powerhouses kneeling on the ground saw this familiar figure, each and every one revealed wildly ecstatic expressions.

This former legend had already disappeared for several hundred years.

No one knew where he went, but his legend had always remained in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Especially when the new patrolling inspector arrived and was already trying to kill people, Ye Yuan’s appearance was even more encouraging.

Several hundred years was not long, to a Deity Realm powerhouse, it was merely a snap of a finger.

Zuo Shujie and the rest of the Celestial Deity powerhouses looked at Ye Yuan, eyes full of shock.

In just this short five to six hundred years, Ye Yuan actually already broke through to the Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity Realm!

When Ye Yuan linked up the Immortal Grove World and the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan had his body flooded by the Immortal Grove World’s divine essence and already directly broke through to the Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity Realm!

This kind of thing was simply fantastical!

One had to know, when Ye Yuan was stuck at Origin Deity Realm previously, it was a full 300 years long.

Shouldn’t Celestial Deity Realm be harder than Divine Lord Realm?

“Ye Yuan, you finally came back!” Coldfeather looked at Ye Yuan, his expression showing excitment and surprise.

Ye Yuan also looked at Coldfeather and said smilingly, “Brother Coldfeather, long time no see!”

Sweeping a glance over, Xuan Yu, Coldfeather, Zuo Shujie, He Chong, including Ning Zhiyuan and the rest, were shockingly all present.

Seeing these people, Ye Yuan also felt especially warm.

These people also all looked at Ye Yuan, feeling a boost in morale.

Ever since Ye Yuan created four mighty Celestial Deity powerhouses, he established absolute authority in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Those people who had grudges with him before, no one dared to go against him anymore.

Ye Yuan rose to power and fame in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, this place was like his home.

Now, this young man ran over to play the tyrant and even wanted to make a move to kill people, making him very unhappy.

The young man’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “Punk, who the hell are you? The person that I, Wu Tian, want to kill, you actually dare to save?”

It turned out that this new patrolling inspector was called Wu Tian.

Wu Tian was Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity, so his strength was pretty strong.

Although Ye Yuan came onto the stage very shockingly, this was nothing to him.

Let alone that an Eighth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse was even following by his side.

Ye Yuan did not look at Wu Tian and just said to everyone coolly, “All get up.”

With Ye Yuan giving verbal instruction, everyone naturally obeyed and was about to get up.

Wu Tian’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Without my orders, I see who dares to stand up! Don’t you all forget, I’m the newly-appointed patrolling inspector! Also, punk, I’m talking to you, are you deaf?”

Everyone’s faces changed, all kneeling down again.

The patrolling inspector’s authority was monstrous, life and death were up to his whims.

Opposing the patrolling inspector would not have a good outcome.

Ye Yuan still ignored Wu Tian. He just flicked his sleeves grandly, a surge of boundless divine essence rippled out.

Inclusive of Xuan Yu and the rest of the Celestial Deity powerhouses, they actually all involuntarily stood up.

“If there’s any problem, I’ll shoulder it!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Wu Tian sneered and said, “You shoulder it? Can you shoulder it? Now, I’ll make you kneel down!”

Giving no chance to explain, Wu Tian immediately made a move, suddenly smacking a palm toward Ye Yuan.

This palm was dealt too suddenly, no different from sneak attacking.

The world power of a Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity suddenly erupted, making the faces of Zuo Shujie and the rest of the Celestial Deity powerhouse change suddenly.

A Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity was too strong in front of them.

“Careful, Ye Yuan!” Coldfeather warned.

Although when Ye Yuan was at Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, he had always jumped realms to battle, Celestial Deity Realm and Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm had no comparison at all[1].

One firmament higher could directly crush you to death!

However, Ye Yuan just scoffed mockingly, finger probing out like lightning. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ahh!

A scream came over, Ye Yuan directly ignored Wu Tian’s world power and clutched his throat.

“So strong!”

“I didn’t expect that after reaching Celestial Deity Realm, Ye Yuan can still jump realm and fight like this!”

“There’s big trouble now! Offending the patrolling inspector, we’ll all be in for it!”

...

Subduing the enemy with one move, Zuo Shujie and the rest were all extremely shocked.

Of course, beyond the shock, they were also all very worried.

After all, the patrolling inspector represented the imperial capital!

The expression of the old man following behind Wu Tian changed, but it was already too late to want to make a move.

The old man threatened, “Brat, let go of Young Master Tian! The consequences of harming him aren’t what you can bear!’

Ye Yuan looked at the old man and said coolly, “I’ll ask, you answer! Hesitate slightly and he’ll be finished.”

The old man’s face changed, Ye Yuan did not take his words seriously at all.

Seeing that the old man did not react, the force in Ye Yuan’s hand increased a bit more.

“Cough, cough, cough!”

Wu Tian let out intense coughs.

“My patience is limited!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The old man’s expression changed and he said, “You ask!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and asked, “Where’s Jiang Jadehall?”

The old man did not dare to hesitate. He answered, “He violated the imperial capital’s rules and is already thrown into a death cell!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, and he asked again, “Who are you people? Why did you want to come to Southridge Ten Cities to be an inspector?”

[1] Don’t know why it says Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, should be Origin Deity Realm?
