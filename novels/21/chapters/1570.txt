Chapter 1574 This Is the First!

Everyone’s heart plunged to rock-bottom all at once.

Fang Tian, Skydistant, White Light, Fiery, and the rest, all revealed determined looks on their faces.

Since they could not be spared, there was only battling to the death!

Even if it was akin to moths flying into the fire, they also could not helplessly watch Li-er go to die.

For everyone here to be able to have today, it was all thanks to Ye Yuan.

How could they possibly watch Li-er go and die helplessly now, while they drag out an ignorable existence in the world?

The Law Enforcement Hall swarmed out in full force, akin to facing a great enemy.

They never thought that just 100 years after killing Kanuo, the Immortal Grove World actually encountered such a catastrophe again.

Furthermore, this calamity was even more terrifying than Kanuo. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although Kanuo was a Heavenly Fiendgod, he was not an invincible existence.

But this Heavenly Sin Heretic God was undefeatable!

Even if Ye Yuan was here, there was no chance of winning either!

Above the void, a divine carriage that blotted out the sky and covered the sun suspended quietly, giving people a strong visual impact.

The decorations on the divine carriage were very dazzling and joyous, just like a sedan chair for welcoming the bride.

Eight enormous dragons were carrying pegs. It was clearly used to pull the divine carriage.

Seeing those eight enormous dragons, everyone’s faces changed drastically!

“Senior Long Min! Senior Ao Qian! Heavenly Sin, what’s the meaning of this?” Yue Mengli’s gaze turned cold as she denounced charmingly.

Yue Mengli saw clearly that those eight enormous dragons were none other than the dragon race’s old patriarch, Long Min, as well as the Ao Qian who had already returned to the dragon clan!

They revealed their original forms at this time and became the mounts to pull the carriage.

On the Law Enforcement Hall’s side, everyone had bloodshot eyes, wishing to rush up and fight it out with Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

This was simply unprecedented humiliation!

The dignified dragon race’s major powers were actually forcefully abducted over by Heavenly Sin Heretic God to pull the divine carriage!

However, no one could resist Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

He was too strong!

The outcome was resisting was death!

Only seeing Yue Mengli’s expression did Heavenly Sin come to realize it, and he said with a laugh, “Turns out that you know them, then it’s really too great. My good Li-er, this one month’s time, this venerated self has racked his brains for the sake of our wedding! I first went to Longwinter, that guy’s place where he passed away in meditation, and dug up his grave, digging out this Waveheaven Divine Carriage. Then I went to the dragon clan and captured these eight dragons to pull the Waveheaven Divine Carriage for us. Hahaha, since you know them, then let them witness our love together!”

With Yue Mengli’s calm and composed personality, she was already angered by Heavenly Sin until she was virtually going mad at this time.

No need to even talk about the others, they wished to swallow Heavenly Sin whole.

“Shit, this tiger lord can’t stand it anymore! Your father will fight it out with you today!”

The White Tiger Clan and Azure Dragon Clan were of the same ancestry. The humiliation of Long Min and Ao Qian they all, he felt as if he had experienced it himself. How could he still bear it?

Done talking, White Light turned into a stream of flowing light and rushed over toward Heavenly Sin.

Skydistant also went crazy. He was part of the Four Symbols Family Clans too, how could he stand this kind of humiliation?

He followed closely behind White Light and also rushed up towards Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

“Everybody, attack together! Even if we die, we also have to teach this guy an unforgettable lesson!” Fang Tian shouted fiercely and rushed up.

Above the sky, several dozen figures rushed at Heavenly Sin Heretic God.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Heavenly Sin’s mouth and he said disdainfully, “Ants who overestimate their own abilities. Since you all want to die, then this seat will fulfill your wishes!”

Yue Mengli’s entire body trembled and she cried out, “Heavenly Sin, if you dare to kill them, I’ll die for you to see right now!”

Yue Mengli raised her palm and placed it on top of her head.

As long as her palm pressed, she could end her own life.

Heavenly Sin’s face changed, just casually waving a hand, dozens of figures flew back uncontrollably, the speed even faster than when they came.

“Puu, puu, puu!”

Everyone directly spewed out a mouthful of blood, already sustaining heavy injuries.

In front of Heavenly Sin, they did not have any leeway to resist at all!

An emotion called despair spread in the air.

Too strong!

These people were the Immortal Grove World’s strongest combat force. They actually could not even touch the corners of the other party’s sleeves!

The corners of Heavenly Sin’s mouth curled slightly and he said with a wicked grin, “My good Li-er, you see that your husband already has such sincerity. Shouldn’t we perform the formal rituals and get married? Today, let’s become Dao companions in front of everyone, never to part for all of eternity!”

Yue Mengli’s heart turned ice-cold and she gritted her teeth and said, “Heavenly Sin, want me to become Dao companions with you, that is possible. But you have to promise me, let them enter the Godsfall Mountain Range! Otherwise, even if I die, I won’t become Dao companions with you too!”

Heavenly Sin smiled sinisterly and said, “My good Li-er, do you really take husband, me, to be a fool? When this venerated self roamed unobstructed throughout the Immortal Grove Region, I toyed with the whole world in the palm of my hands. How can your little trick deceive me? Heh heh, if I let them go, you’ll commit suicide straight away. But if I don’t let them go, you ... don’t dare to die!”

Yue Mengli’s expression changed, only then, discovering that her thinking was simply too fanciful and fallacious.

Heavenly Sin Heretic God was a supreme powerhouse from 300 thousand years ago, how could he be deceived be her little trick?

Did she ... really have to commit her body to this abominable guy?

No!

That way, I, Yue Mengli, would rather die!

Right at this time, Heavenly Sin smiled again and said, “My good Li-er, it’s not impossible for this venerated self to let them go. But you must get married to this venerated self first. After the ceremony is done, this venerated self will naturally let them go!”

“You! You dream on!” Yue Mengli said in extreme rage.

Heavenly Sin laughed and said, “Hahaha ... my good Li-er, do you think that this one month that this venerated self was out, I really did not care about what’s happening in the outside world? I know that you like a punk called Ye Yuan. Furthermore, he’s the same as me, both candidate masters that this Immortal Grove Region chose. But ... that punk broke through to Divine Dao for merely 100 years, even if he’s here, this seat can smack him to death with one slap! Therefore, you can stop harboring hopes of getting lucky. Obediently become Dao companions with this venerated self and forget that kid. After today, you’ll reign the Immortal Grove Region together with this venerated self!”

Heavenly Sin paused for a bit, his gaze turned dark and murderous intent emerged fully as he said, “If you don’t obey, this venerated self will kill one by one starting from now. Wonder how you’ll feel when these people die in front of you one by one?”

What kind of existence was Heavenly Sin Heretic God?

He was a fierce and ambitious person from 300 thousand years ago. His cunningness and resourcefulness were top-rate existences.

Yue Mengli was too weak in front of him.

Heavenly Sin was incomparably pleased with himself inwardly. He knew that Yue Mengli would definitely be obedient.

If he could not even deal with a woman, his name of Heavenly Sin would also be too useless.

When the raw rice is cooked, would he still be afraid that Yue Mengli could escape his palm?

As long as the ceremony was done, Heavenly Sin believed that even if he were to let Yue Mengli return to Ye Yuan’s side, she would not agree.

She had no face to see Ye Yuan!

At that time, she could only follow him wholeheartedly!

Yue Mengli had a look of despair, she was really out of a choice.

“Li-er, you don’t worry about us! This old man was originally someone who should have died, today, I’ll return my life to Ye Yuan!” Fang Tian shouted and rushed over toward Heavenly Sin once more.

Heavenly Sin smiled evilly, and then he said to Yue Mengli, “My good Li-er, this is the first!”
