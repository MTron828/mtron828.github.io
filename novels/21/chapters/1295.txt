Chapter 1299: Myriad Treasure Tower

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Forget about the Liang Family. Senior, where do we go to buy spirit medicines?” Ye Yuan said.

Dustless said, “Go to the Myriad Treasure Tower then! The word-of-mouth of the Myriad Treasure Tower under Empyrean Myriad Treasure is still very secure. When Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was alive, he liked to go to the Myriad Treasure Tower to buy things too.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head. Even Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove acknowledged it, so he naturally would not have any objections.

Getting his things in order, Ye Yuan went straight out of the Liang Family.

Inquiring, Ye Yuan headed for the Myriad Treasure Tower. Dustless’s voice sounded out in Ye Yuan’s mind.

“Kid, there’s a tail following. It’s that Zhang Shun.”

Ye Yuan was alarmed inwardly, but his expression did not change. He continued walking forward.

The Heavenspan World was totally different from the Immortal Grove World. Ye Yuan’s divine sense could only extend roughly the distance of a hundred feet here.

Furthermore, the Heavenly Dao’s suppression toward martial artists here was exceptionally powerful.

Under Divine Lord Realm, martial artists were unable to fly!

Hence, Ye Yuan’s perception was far from as sensitive as at the Immortal Grove World.

Fortunately, Dustless was incomparably powerful. At practically the first instant, he detected Zhang Shun’s existence.

Zhang Shun was probably up to no good chasing after him.

“Looks like Liang Mingyu had some devious ideas,” Ye Yuan replied.

“En, most likely took a fancy on that so-called beast taming technique of yours,” Dustless said.

“I can’t return to the Liang Family anymore. What should I do?” Ye Yuan asked.

“No worries. You have divine essence stones on you, can go to the Myriad Treasure Tower and rent a cultivation room, and focus on figuring out Formation Dao and Alchemy Dao. However, this will have to depend on your comprehension ability. If you’re still not able to refine divine essence pills before the divine essence stones are depleted, this little life of yours ... will probably be hard to preserve,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan’s brows shot up, but he said with high morale, “Heh, this is considered driving me into a dead end? Looks like there’s only going for broke.”

Ye Yuan was a cripple now. What could move Liang Mingyu was probably just that non-existent beast taming technique. This was not hard to guess.

Luckily, he came out in time. Any later and he probably would not even be able to leave the Liang Family’s gate.

Ye Yuan hastened his footsteps and arrived at the Myriad Treasure Tower very soon.

“Hiss, what a grand Myriad Treasure Tower!”

In front of him was a magnificent and imposing building.

Carved balustrades and marble steps, richly decorated jade halls, a grand atmosphere, but completely did not have the air of an upstart.

“Heh, Empyrean Myriad Treasure corroborated his Dao with artifacts, and is the wealthiest heavenly emperor in this Heavenspan World! Even in this remote Jewelhill City, the Myriad Treasure Tower also isn’t what the Liang Family, that sort of bumpkin, can rival,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan felt a burst of yearning when he heard this. But he recollected his mind very quickly and stepped into the Myriad Treasure Tower.

“This sir, our Myriad Treasure Tower has everything under the sun. I wonder, what do you require?” A pretty maidservant came up to receive him.

She was called Hong Yin, specifically responsible for guiding customers to shop.

Seeing Hong Yin, Ye Yuan’s gaze involuntarily turned sharp.

A little maidservant was actually a Deity Realm powerhouse!

This Myriad Treasure Tower was indeed extraordinary!

Furthermore, this Hong Yin should be able to see through him at a glance. Although there was some disdain in her eyes, it was concealed very well. One could not even hear a trace of impatience in her words.

Indeed well-deserving of being a faction under a Heavenly Emperor’s command!

“I need five catties of Divine Rain Silk, eight catties of Goldenwind Immortal Grass, six catties of Heavenly Silk Crystal ...”

Ye Yuan listed out five to six kinds of divine rank spirit medicines in one go. Although these spirit medicines were divine rank spirit medicines, they were all entry-level.

Hong Yin could not help being stunned when she heard these but felt at ease very soon.

These spirit medicines were all beginner alchemists’ spirit medicines. They were normally used for newcomers to get started.

This youth in front of her did not have the slightest trace of divine essence undulations, he was probably a cripple. He should be a servant of some alchemy god master, running errands for him.

“Alright, Sir. I’ll send someone to fetch it at once. Is there still anything else you need?” Hong Yin asked again.

Ye Yuan continued, “I wish to rent a training room.”

Hong Yin froze, buying so many spirit medicines and entering a training room for what?

Could it be that he did not need to deliver it back for his master?

How could a servant be so daring?

Suspicions were suspicions, Hong Yin still smiled radiantly and said, “Our Myriad Treasure Tower’s training rooms are divided into Heaven, Earth, Mystic, Yellow, four ranks. Heaven Rank training rooms are 1000 pieces of low-grade divine essence stones for a day. Earth Rank training rooms are 500 low-grade divine essence stones for a day. Mystic Rank training rooms are 100 low-grade divine essence stones a day. Yellow Rank training rooms are 10 pieces of low-grade divine essence stones a day.”

Ye Yuan’s face could not help turning stiff.

So expensive!

He originally planned on renting 10 days. A hundred low-grade divine essence stones were gone all at once, while the divine essence stones that Liang Wanru gave him were merely 135 pieces in total.

Subtracting away the costs of buying spirit medicines, what could he cultivate still?

Ye Yuan knew that the purchasing power of divine essence stones was still quite okay.

But the cultivation rooms in the Myriad Treasure Tower were truly too expensive as well.

“This ... Is there a cheaper cultivation room?” Ye Yuan thickened his skin and asked.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly in his heart for a while. He did not expect that he would actually have a day where he was so miserable too.

Fortunately, before he came to the Heavenspan World, he already had sufficient mental preparations, and it was not to the extent of having a huge psychological drop. It was just somewhat sighing emotionally.

Hong Yin felt a bout of contempt in her heart. No money, put on an act for what?

Contempt was contempt, but Hong Yin was a very professional maidservant. She smiled faintly to Ye Yuan and said, “Of course. We still have ungraded cultivation rooms here, it only requires four pieces of low-grade divine essence stones a day. But, these ungraded cultivation rooms, the effects are much poorer, the cost to performance ratio isn’t high. Does sir really want to rent it?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up. He only asked tentatively, did not expect that there really was.

He was only renting the cultivation room in order to refine pills. Good or bad did not matter.

Right now, he did not have the qualifications to cultivate at all.

“Alright, I’ll rent for 10 days! You have someone directly deliver the spirit medicines to the cultivation room!” Ye Yuan said straightforwardly.

Hong Yin did not expect that Ye Yuan really rented it.

She was very perplexed by Ye Yuan’s actions. Could it be that this young man who did not even have divine essence actually wanted to refine pills himself?

You have got to be kidding!

The professional Hong Yin smiled faintly again and said, “Okay, Sir. Adding the spirit medicines that you bought previously, it’s 68 pieces of low-grade divine essence stones in total. Please pay the bill first.”

Ye Yuan felt his flesh hurt, retrieving 68 pieces of divine essence stones from within the storage ring and paid the bill.

With this, inside his storage ring was only left with 67 pieces of divine essence stones.

If he was unable to use these 67 pieces of divine essence stones to refine a Divine Essence Pill, then what awaited him shall be death!

Right now, Ye Yuan already had no paths of retreat!

“Oh, right, if I can refine Divine Essence Pills, will your Myriad Treasure Tower accept it?” Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and asked.

Hong Yin was stunned. This was still her first time encountering such a person!

Buying spirit medicines at the Myriad Treasure Tower, he actually wanted to refine into medicinal pills and sell to the Myriad Treasure Tower!

But she already confirmed one thing. This young man renting a practice room was really to refine pills himself!

However, a youth who did not even have divine essence, what right did he ... no, wait, Formation Dao Pill Refinement!

Hong Yin’s entire body suddenly trembled, thinking of a kind of possibility.

But how was this possible?

Formation Dao Pill Refinement, in this Jewelhill City, there should be no one able to do it, right?
