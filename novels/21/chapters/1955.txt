“Thank you, Ye Yuan,” Jian Hongxiao looked at Ye Yuan and said

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, don’t your Jian Family revere the Profound Secrets Pavilion as supreme? What’s this Stellar Hall?”

Actually, Ye Yuan did not figure out just what was the Stellar Hall until now too.

Jian Hongxiao said, “The Stellar Hall is where the core of the Profound Secrets Pavilion lies. Those able to enter it are all one-in-ten-thousand powerhouses, having outstanding strength in the Dao of Divination. And the Stellar Hall’s elders, there are only a total of eight. Only the strongest ones can assume the post.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, roughly understanding in his heart.

Although the Heavenspan World was big, the great imperial capitals that the Jian Family occupied were not their own. Those able to enter the Stellar Hall were all elites among elites, having outstanding talent in the Dao of Divination.

No wonder Jian Hongxiao back then gave him an unfathomable feeling.

Even if his cultivation realm fell drastically, his divination arts were still unfathomable. It was far from what those in the same rank could compare to.

“A Stellar Hall, only great imperial capitals have it. Furthermore, in each Stellar Hall, there’s a peak empyrean spirit treasure, the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere. The Stellar Hall’s responsibility is to borrow the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere to deduce Heavenly Dao. Each Stellar Hall elder manages one aspect of the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere, their responsibilities being enormous,” Jian Hongxiao continued saying.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “So that’s how it is! That Jian Yun has a grudge with you?”

Jian Hongxiao smiled bitterly and said, “Jian Yun’s father, Jian Hao, was always suppressed by me back then. Because there can only be eight Stellar Hall elders, so he was never able to become an elder. As for that Jian Yun, I had once divined for him before and said that he’ll never amount to much. So this father and son pair have always had some resentment towards me.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m afraid it’s not resentment that simple. That Jian Hao should be afraid of you snatching his position of elder, right?”

Jian Hongxiao nodded and said, “With Jian Yun’s skill, he can’t divine my return. Most likely, this matter has Jian Hao’s hand involved. But with this play, Jian Yun will likely really become a cripple.”

As these two people chatted, Jian Chen at one side wanted to speak but swallowed the words back.

Ye Yuan suddenly changed the topic and said, “Senior, the urgent matter on hand is that we’d better think of a way to get the pill formula fast.”

Jian Hongxiao said in surprise, “You still want to refine pills for me?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “Look at what you’re saying, if not for the sake of refining pills, what did I come to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital with you for?”

“B-But you’re also aware, I’m the Stellar Hall’s sinner!” Jian Hongxiao said.

He even thought that through this incident, Ye Yuan probably would not refine pills for him anymore at all.

After all, his unsavory past was exposed by people.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually still insisted on refining pills for him.

But Ye Yuan gave Jian Chen a glance and said smilingly, “So what? You’re the senior that I, Ye Yuan, acknowledged, and you are a friend of mine. You showed kindness to me, Ye Yuan. The rest has nothing to do with me! Even if you become enemies with the world, this pill ... I’m refining for sure!”

Jian Hongxiao and Jian Chen’s faces changed greatly when they heard that.

They did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so loyal to friends.

Jian Hongxiao was even more touched in his heart, tears already running down his old face.

When you stand opposite of everyone in the world and someone stood on your side with a firm determination, that sensation could not be described using words.

Actually, about this matter, Ye Yuan had his own judgment. Most likely, Jian Hongxiao had some painful topic. It was just that it was hard for him to say it out.

Walking all the way to this point, Ye Yuan was no longer some ignorant person anymore. He still had some confidence in discerning people.

Jian Hongxiao did not seem to be someone who had utter disregard for human life when doing things and facing people, and also did not have too much sinister air.

Activating a forbidden art likely had other reasons.

Furthermore, this Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s city lord still saved Jian Hongxiao’s life with the Bright Moon Purple Cloud Pill in the end. This also affirmed Ye Yuan’s idea from the side-view.

If Jian Hongxiao really activated the forbidden art for his own selfish reasons, that Empyrean powerhouses most likely would not have done that.

“Don’t you want to know what in the world happened back then?” Jian Hongxiao asked.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you’re willing to say, you’d naturally tell me. If you’re not willing to say, why would I need to go and pick at your scar?”

Jian Hongxiao looked at Ye Yuan and said with a sigh, “Making such a friend, what do I still need! Ye Yuan, from today onward, you and I are sworn friends for life!”

At this very moment, Jian Hao’s fury already burst through the horizon.

He could be said to have racked his brain for the sake of this son and even let him enter the Stellar Hall.

But in the end, Jian Yun was actually crippled!

To the Jian Family’s members, eyes being blinded was equivalent to being a cripple.

Six Veins Stellar Pill?

Jian Hao never even thought about it!

If there was such a medicinal pill, Jian Hongxiao also would not have left Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, feeling dejected back then.

A medicinal pill that even the city lord could not get, where would he go to get one?

“Dad, you have to take revenge for me! That old thing, and also that punk, they definitely deliberately harmed me!” Jian Yun roared.

Jian Hao gritted his teeth and said, “You rest assured, I’m going to make Jian Hongxiao that scoundrelly thing utterly disappear this time! Li Xun, bring a few people over for me and detained Jian Hongxiao three people over for me!”

Behind Jian Hao, a Seventh Firmament True God powerhouse received the order and left.

As a Stellar Hall elder, Jian Hao’s status was incomparably venerated. There was naturally no lack of some experts around him.

Li Xun picked out a few people and headed over to the inn that Ye Yuan three people were staying at.

“Jian Hongxiao, get out for me! You dared to hurt my Stellar Hall’s disciple, you deserve a thousand deaths!”

Outside the inn, Li Xun called out in a clear voice.

“Isn’t this Protector Li Xun who’s by Elder Jian Hao’s side? Who provoked them?”

“Tsk tsk, whoever it is, they will likely lose a layer of skin!”

“I heard that Elder Jian Hao’s only son, Jian Yun, suddenly became a blind man today. Could it have been done by this group of people?”

...

Outside the inn, everyone was guessing optimistic about it, all waiting to watch a show.

But no one came out and no one answered too.

Li Xun’s brows furrowed and he called out in a clear voice once more, “Fine, since you don’t know how to appreciate favors, then don’t blame us for not being courteous! The few of you guard outside, don’t let them run!”

Before Li Xun came, he understood the situation long ago. These three people were merely two First Firmament True Gods and a Celestial Deity. Him coming to capture people was bombarding mosquitoes with a cannon, putting fine timber to petty use.

But Jiao Hao was currently in a fit of rage, he naturally did not dare to be neglectful.

Bang!

Li Xun found the three people’s residence and directly shattered the door with a palm.

“Jian Hongxiao, what haughty airs you have. Do you really think that you’re still that Stellar Hall’s ... E-Elder Suyan, w-why are you here?”

Inside the house, Jian Hongxiao was currently drinking opposite an old man, chatting away happily.

When Li Xun saw that old man, his expression immediately became very ugly. He was even somewhat stuttering when speaking.

This old man was called Jian Suyan, similarly a Stellar Hall elder.

However, Jian Suyan’s status was much more venerated than Jian Hao.

Because Jian Suyan was an Empyrean powerhouse!

Jian Suyan drank a mouthful of tea and said without even turning his head back, “You go back and tell Jian Hao. Tell him not to have ideas about Hongxiao anymore, the city lord wants to see him.”
