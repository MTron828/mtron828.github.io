Chapter 2851 Shooting Down an Ancestor!

With regards to the indignation of Zhu Yan and the others, Ye Yuan did not take it seriously either.

He was not familiar with these people to begin with. There was no need to pay too much attention to their feelings.

After Zhu Yan these people left, Ye Yuan immediately went to the Scripture Library and started browsing the Extreme Medicine Sect’s alchemy records. The Extreme Medicine Sect focused on alchemy, their scriptures being extremely plentiful. It could be said to be enough to fill a house to the rafters.

The Extreme Medicine Sect’s Scripture Library was divided into Martial and Alchemy.

And the Alchemy Scripture Library was a full seven stories high!

Of course, entering a different floor required different permissions.

As Zuo Chen’s disciple, Ye Yuan’s authority was naturally great and could directly climb up to the sixth floor.

As for the Scripture Library, the Extreme Medicine Sect’s limitations were not too great.

Alchemy Dao was different from Martial Dao. It was not about giving a person a secret book, and then he would be able to ascend to heaven in one step.

The things recorded in alchemy classics were also greatly different from the things recorded into martial arts classics.

Some of the profound things, even if let a person look, he might not be able to understand it too.

Only by accumulating little by little could one go from the easy to the difficult and complicated, reaching the pinnacle. But not having many limitations did not mean that there were no limitations. The seventh level’s classics, that was all the foundation of the Extreme Medicine Sect. Only those with the highest authority could browse them.

After Ye Yuan entered the Scripture Library, he did not stop at the lowest level but went straight up to the sixth level.

Ye Yuan was only half a step away from profound grade. What he needed now was a spark of inspiration to break through this shackle.

Ordinary classics could consolidate his foundation, but it was unable to serve as any advice.

Therefore, he went straight to the sixth floor.

Alchemy classics were not like martial arts classics, being classified into levels.

Just as the Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook, it could be said to just be the list of some heavenly medicines. But its preciousness was enough to place it at the seventh level.

In the sixth level, there were naturally some records that Ye Yuan could not understand.

But, he understood the vast majority of it. It was because of the realm he had already reached.

Above profound grade, it was even more vague and insubstantial. That level of records was incredibly precious and would naturally be placed at the seventh level.

Of course, Ye Yuan knew that there were even higher level books placed in the Extreme Light Pavilion.

That place, only the Extreme Light Pavilion’s pavilion elders had the qualifications to browse through.

However, those books were still too distant for Ye Yuan. There was naturally no need to consider them for now.

At the sixth level, there were not many people reading the classics. It was basically some Emperor Realm powerhouses.

The moment Ye Yuan entered the door, it immediately attracted sidelong glances. It was not that there were no grade five heavenly alchemists able to go up to the sixth floor. Lu Daoyi had this qualification.

But, even Lu Daoyi would not go up to the sixth level either.

The alchemy records here were not suitable for him.

Therefore, seeing a Saint Sovereign Heaven come up, these Emperor Realm powerhouses were all extremely surprised.

Ye Yuan ignored these people’s gazes, going straight for the bookcases and starting browsing through.

All kinds of jade slips were placed on the bookcase. Next to the jade slips, there were the names and profiles of the records, which were clear at a glance.

Ye Yuan swept a glance and casually picked up a ‘Profound Grade Heavenly Pill Detailed Explanation’ and started reading.

“Young man, it’s not good to reach beyond your grasp! Profound grade heavenly pill is a realm that you’re currently unable to touch. Better to lay down the foundation honestly. That’s the right way!” Suddenly, a voice transmitted over next to Ye Yuan’s ear.

Upon turning his head to look, it was an old man in black robes.

Ye Yuan gave a bow and said smilingly, “Many thanks to Ancestor for your teachings. This disciple got it!”

Although he said so, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of leaving.

This black-robed old man’s strength was unfathomable. Ye Yuan could not see through. He had likely already reached Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm.

Hence, Ye Yuan called him Ancestor.

The black-robed old man frowned and said, “Boy, are you turning a deaf ear to this seat’s words?”

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only say honestly, “Ancestor, this disciple came here in order to break through to profound grade.”

The moment this was said, many Emperor Realms immediately laughed out loud. A measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven said that he wanted to break through to profound grade was really hilarious. They all, these people, had already reached Emperor Realm and had not broken through to profound grade yet!

It was fine if he did not say anything. But the moment he said this, the black robed old man snorted coldly and said, “Not only are you reaching beyond your grasp, you’re even wildly arrogant and conceited! Who’s your master?”

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only say, “My master is Zuo Chen!”

The black-robed old man snorted coldly and said, “Does Zuo Chen that brat have eyes but couldn’t see? How did he accept such an ignorant brat to be a disciple? Go to where you should go. Don’t disturb other people’s reading here!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “Ancestor, I’m just here to read. I didn’t disturb others. It’s you who disturbed the others.”

The moment these words came out, everyone was stunned.

This boy was really arrogant!

Did he not know who this person in front of him was?

Even if he did not know, to dare call Zuo Chen ‘that brat’ and even said that he had eyes but could not see, could he be an ordinary person?

You actually dared to talk like this!

The black-robed old man gave a cold laugh when he heard that. He said, “Huhu, well done! Even if Zuo Chen that brat is in front of this seat, he also wouldn’t dare to talk like that. Young friend, you really have a lot of balls!”

Ye Yuan said neither obsequiously nor haughtily, “This disciple is just speaking the truth! This disciple has the right to enter the sixth level. I naturally have the right to read here. Even if this blows up to Sect Master there, I’m not in the wrong either. Ancestor, you don’t have the authority to make me leave. If Ancestor, you, insist on making this disciple leave, then I can only go to the Law Enforcement Hall to redress my grievance!” The black-robed old man’s face was already black as the bottom of a pot.

This brat actually brought to the Law Enforcement Hall to suppress him!

He was making him leave for his own good. Not only did this brat not appreciate the kindness, but he was also even messing with him!

If this matter really ended up at the Law Enforcement Hall there, he really could not explain it clearly.

With Ye Yuan’s identity, he indeed had the qualifications to read the records here.

He was the Alchemy Scripture Library’s manager. If he really chased Ye Yuan out, that would be his fault.

The Law Enforcement Hall would embarrass him!

He, an exalted Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse, actually made things difficult for a Saint Sovereign Heaven. This could not be justified no matter what.

“Hah! Good! Very good! This seat wants to see how you break through to profound grade realm! You’re called Ye Yuan, right? This seat has remembered you. Later, this seat will ask Zuo Chen that brat how he teaches disciples!”

The black-robed old man flicked his sleeves and left, leaving behind the dumbfounded group of Emperor Realm powerhouses.

“This kid is too amazing to actually shoot down Elder Fan Li until he’s speechless!”

“What amazing? I think that he’s courting death! Elder Fan Li is the sect master’s senior apprentice brother, his seniority being extremely old! This kid offended him. Even Martial Uncle Zuo Chen can’t protect him too!”

“Huhu, actually, I also really want to see how this boy breaks through to profound grade realm!”

… …

Ye Yuan naturally knew that Fan Li was doing it for his own good, but he told the truth and the other party did not believe him and even wanted to chase him away.

Sometimes, geniuses were so helpless.

Since you want to see, then I’ll let you see.

Ye Yuan did not think too much either, divine sense sinking into the jade slip and started reading carefully.

……

Very soon, the matter of Ye Yuan not daring to accept Lu Daoyi’s challenge, but that he was too stubborn to admit defeat, was known across the entire sect. Originally, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven naturally would not attract people’s attention.

TO

But the commotion caused when Ye Yuan entered the sect was too big. Even if he did not want to attract attention, he could not.

This matter continued to ferment. Very soon, Zuo Chen’s lineage became the laughingstock of the entire sect.

When Sect Master gave the order personally, there naturally would not be people who thought that it was Ye Yuan’s face.

Hence, the vast majority of the people felt that this was Zuo Chen being partial to Ye Yuan.

Now, who he was shielding was actually this kind of coward. Wouldn’t it be a joke?

On the other hand, Lu Daoyi’s grand words also spread across the Extreme Medicine Sect swiftly, shocking everyone.

Lu Daoyi’s domineering exit from seclusion could be said to have become a sea-stabilizing divine needle of the conservative faction! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Although he was just a grade five heavenly alchemist, his battle achievement already closed in on the number one genius, Zhou Pinespring

What did this indicate?

This showed that the conservative faction’s way of doing things was correct! If they could nurture another Hegemon Realm in the rear, it would absolutely have a profound impact on this war.

On Tiansong Peak, Qin Shan said with a loud laugh, “Good! Good disciple! Master indeed didn’t misjudge you! This time, you really gained face for Master!”

These two days, he was really riding on the crest of success, getting his fill of the limelight.

Even when some Emperor Sakra Heavens saw him, they also greeted warmly with smiling faces.

Lu Daoyi smiled and said, “Master, the marvelous thing is still at the back! From tomorrow onward, I’ll challenge the sect’s grade six heavenly alchemists! I want to let everyone know that I, Lu Daoyi, am the number one genius after Ancestor Pinespring! I want to let everyone know that Master’s opinion is the correct one!”
