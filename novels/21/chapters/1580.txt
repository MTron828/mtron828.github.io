1584 Is There Still Regard for Pecking Order?

The Pill Tower competition was the Pill Tower’s grandest event.

From disciples to elders, they all had to take part, competing for a spot to enter the Pill Tower.

The Pill Tower was a faction of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, and also a cultivation tower that everyone yearned for. The Martial Tower was likewise so.

Each Pill Tower competition, in order to fight for the spot to enter the Pill Tower, the elders would also crack their heads. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Pill Martial Twin Towers were the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s most beautiful structures. The entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, no matter from which angle, one could see the twin towers that towered into the clouds side by side.

At this time, below the Pill Tower, people assembled on an enormous plaza.

The Pill Tower competition and Martial Tower competition were both major events that involved the inner city as well as the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s future direction. The attention paid was naturally extremely high.

Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted, “You guys, quickly look! The elders are out!”

A corner of the plaza close to the Pill Tower had a very high grandstand built temporarily. This was specially prepared for the elders.

Even those deacons did not have the qualifications to sit here either.

At this time, the elders entered in a single file, each finding their seats and taking it.

Deercry was so angry in his heart!

The others sitting on top, he was convinced of their qualifications.

But this Ye Yuan made him as uncomfortable as having eaten a fly.

With this, he really ran on top of his head to shit and pee.

“You all, look, that’s the newly-appointed Elder Ye Yuan, so young!”

“More than just young! He’s simply a little kid, alright? Many Pill Tower’s Three-star Alchemy God disciples are hundreds of years older than him!”

“Tsk tsk, truly, you can’t judge a man by his looks! It’s just, no idea how his true standard is. I heard that he refused Song Qiyang’s challenge.”

“Heh, scared, right? Now, everyone says that he’s the chess piece pushed out by Second Elder, I think it’s most likely the case.”

“Yeah, such a little kid, he can have the qualifications to be an elder? Isn’t that nonsense?!”

...

Ye Yuan appearing in the ranks of the group of elders truly seemed somewhat glaring.

Compared to the other elders, he was somewhat ridiculously young.

Even the vast majority of the disciples were much older than Ye Yuan.

This kind of situation occurring, it naturally made many people feel very off in their hearts.

Of course, the one who felt the most off-balance was Song Qiyang.

He looked at Ye Yuan below, sneering unceasingly in his heart.

You just be smug then. Today, I’m going to challenge you in front of everybody! I don’t believe that you can avoid and not a battle! Song Qiyang sneered coldly in his heart.

All preparations in place, Song Qiyang slowly stepped out of the ranks and said to Rou Xu with clasped hands, “Head Elder, I heard that the newly-appointed Elder Ye’s alchemy strength is formidable. This disciple is untalented and wants to seek guidance from him. There are quite a few disciples present, I think everyone wants to witness Elder Ye’s elegant bearing. Just take it as ... giving the competition this time a warm-up!”

Everyone clearly did not expect that Song Qiyang actually played this move, challenging Ye Yuan in front of so many people. If Ye Yuan still did not accept the challenge, it probably could not be justified, right?

However, they also indeed looked forward to it very much, at just how Ye Yuan’s true strength was.

For a moment, all gazes turned toward Ye Yuan, wanting to see how he would cope with the present situation.

Rou Xu looked at Ye Yuan meaningfully and said, “Elder Ye, right now in the imperial city, the criticism toward you numbered quite a lot! There are quite a few people who say that you’re young and lacking to take on the position of elder. Some also say that you’re just a Three-star Alchemy God and aren’t worthy of being an elder. Why not take this chance and show some ability for everyone?”

These two people sang in chorus, directly forcing Ye Yuan to the corner.

Quite a few elders, deacons, and protectors were all watching the joke. After all, Ye Yuan coming into existence so sudden made them very unconvinced.

“Yeah, Elder Ye, show some skill and also let us broaden our horizons!”

“Elder Ye enjoys success at a young age. He definitely has areas where he surpasses others. Why not take this chance and let us learn!”

The group of deacons and protectors craved for the world to be plunged into chaos, all concurring.

Second Elder did not like to fight and had always been ostracized by Head Elder.

The deacons and protectors present, the majority were Head Elder’s people. They were naturally here to watch the joke.

Ye Yuan sneered in his heart and suddenly asked, “Head Elder, this Song Qiyang is your disciple, right?”

Rou Xu nodded and said, “That’s right.”

Ye Yuan suddenly snorted coldly and said, “Head Elder, this disciple of yours is also too ignorant of the rules! The matter a few days ago, I presume that Head Elder wouldn’t be unaware, right? A mere Three-star disciple, what right does he have to come and challenge this elder? Today, in front of so many people, he just said those words a little nicer. Is this wanting to force me to abdicate? Head Elder, with this precedent today, then what prestige would all the elders present still have in the future?”

Song Qiyang could not help choking, his face flushing red.

Similarly Three-star Alchemy God, he was even two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan. But his single rebuttal trampled him dead.

The difference in status was too great.

Ye Yuan suddenly making things difficult for him caught Rou Xu by surprise.

He did not think that Ye Yuan, a young man, actually knew bureaucratic play and trickery, pressing people with circumstances.

Even though these words sounded like avoidance no matter what, he really could not find words to refute.

If according to realm, Song Qiyang was more than plenty to challenge Ye Yuan.

But according to status, Song Qiyang was not even fit to carry shoes for Ye Yuan!

Saying these words today was disobeying one’s superiors in itself.

But this way, Rou Xu was even more convinced that Ye Yuan was definitely an embroidered pillow, not daring to accept the challenge.

Rou Xu’s reaction was quick as well, immediately giving Deercry a look.

Deercry understood, got up, and said, “Ye Yuan, I wonder if this old man has the qualifications to challenge you?”

“Insolence!” The moment his voice faded, Ye Yuan immediately launched an attack and said in a cold voice, “Who the hell are you, to dare directly call this elder by name?”

Deercry’s face turned into the color of pig liver. Being said like this by a little boy who was not even old enough to be his grandson, he was really going crazy!

Deercry relied on that he was Rou Xu’s confidant and normally did not take ordinary elders seriously either, directly calling them by their names.

His seniority was even older than those elders. Taking advantage of his seniority a bit, no one dared to say anything either.

Who knew that today, Ye Yuan actually directly used this to shoot.

Ye Yuan had a grim look and said to Rou Xu, “Head Elder, I think our Pill Tower should be reorganized properly. Is there still any regard for pecking order? Why not ... I propose to have an elders meeting and discuss this problem well, and come up with a solution?”

Rou Xu had not opened his mouth yet when the Xuan Yu who had his eyes shut to rest the entire time suddenly spoke up.

“Mn, this pecking order should be discussed properly.” Finished talking, he shut his eyes again, as if he did not say anything.

The moment Second Elder opened his mouth, the weight of the speech was different.

With today’s matter as the pretext, having an elders meeting did not seem to be inappropriate.

Head Elder’s lineage was used to playing the tyrant and did not place the other elders in their sights at all. The concept of pecking order had actually long weakened already.

This naturally could not scare Rou Xu. But it made Rou Xu secretly become alert in his heart.

This Ye Yuan was not easy to deal with!

This kid had a completely different style than Xuan Yu, very troublesome!

Suddenly, Rou Xu opened his mouth and said, “Deacon Deercry, why haven’t you apologized to Elder Ye?”
