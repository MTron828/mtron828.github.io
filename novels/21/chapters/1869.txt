Chapter 1873: Merely Thus

Yang Yidao laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Not handing over? Did you eat the wrong medicine? Just the likes of you, a Third Firmament Celestial Deity, can defend the empyrean spirit treasure?”

In front of a bunch of True God powerhouses, Ye Yuan actually said that he was not handing over the empyrean spirit treasure, it was really very brave.

Forget about Yang Yidao, Ji Kang, this kind of Ninth Firmament True God peerless powerhouse, even First Firmament True God was also not what a rookie like Ye Yuan could resist.

Xu Xing’s contest with Ye Yuan was merely children playing house in these big shots’ eyes.

They had the potential to be a powerhouse, but it did not mean that they were powerhouses right now.

This kind of stubbornness and pride that was utterly unjustifiable would only make Ye Yuan lose his life.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Go and get it yourselves if you have the capabilities. Bullying a junior here and you’re still puffed up with pride, each and every one of you is really shameless.”

Ji Kang smiled coldly and said, “Boy, in this world, strength reigns supreme! Without strength, you’re not fit to possess treasures!”

Yang Yidao also laughed loudly and said, “What is face? Can it be eaten as rice? Can it increase strength? Boy, you’re still too young!”

Zuo Pan was clearly not that patient, snorting coldly as he said, “Enough nonsense! Boy, not handing over the empyrean spirit treasure, I’ll kill you first!”

Originally, the group of True God powerhouses was ready to jump at each other’s throats. But at this time, the spearheads were all aimed at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan not being willing to hand over the empyrean spirit treasure, no matter how they quibbled, it was all for naught as well.

“This boy wouldn’t have lost his mind, right? Empyrean spirit treasure, he has the fate to obtain it, but doesn’t have the life to use it!”

“Can’t understand what this boy is thinking. If it were me, I’d have long thrown away the empyrean spirit treasure.”

“This thing is a hot potato, but he actually can’t even understand the situation. Reckon that he’s dead for sure.”

...

Not scared of blowing matters up when watching a show. Those Celestial Deity powerhouses and weaker True God powerhouses all felt that Ye Yuan was too unwise.

Ye Yuan held his palm out, the Stellar War Banner appeared in his hand. Waves of powerful undulations spread out.

Feeling this powerful undulation, the eyes of Ji Kang and the rest revealed incomparably fervent looks.

“That’s it, this is more like it! It’s no use being stubborn, hurry up and hand it over!” Ji Kang smiled and said.

Everyone all thought that Ye Yuan still submitted in the end.

Facing so many True God powerhouses, no one could be unyielding.

Who knew that a hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said coolly, “The Stellar War Banner is right here. If you have the capabilities, come over and take it!”

Everyone was taken aback, not expecting that Ye Yuan actually put on the posture of picking a fight.

Whoosh!

Right at this time, a figure suddenly dashed out behind Ye Yuan.

The faces of Ji Kang and the rest all changed. They did not expect that there would actually be someone who struck first to gain the advantage!

The auras of Ji Kang, Yang Yidao, Zuo Pan, and the rest all suddenly erupted, rushing over toward Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, the small flag in Ye Yuan’s hand suddenly became bigger!

The sky suddenly turned dark, stars dotting the sky.

Ye Yuan gripped the Stellar War Banner with one hand and suddenly waved. Countless starlight suddenly coalesced onto the black flag.

A terrifying to the extreme aura suddenly erupted, catching that person who sneaked attack by surprise.

Bang!

The person who ambushed directly flew out a thousand feet away, fresh blood spurting wildly along the way. When he fell to the ground, there was not one unscathed spot on his body.

The figures of Ji Kang and the rest abruptly stopped, looking at this scene in tremendous alarm and terror.

“Is ... Is this the power of an empyrean spirit treasure? So powerful!” Ji Kang said with an astounded look.

Yang Yidao’s expression was very ugly as he said, “Li Zhu is Sixth Firmament True God, to actually not even be able to block the power of one strike from the Stellar War Banner!”

“He just obtained the Stellar War Banner and doesn’t have time to refine at all! Furthermore, he’s only Third Firmament Celestial Deity, so why is he able to unleash such terrifying power?” Zuo Pan was full of puzzlement.

The person who sneaked attacked Ye Yuan just now was called Li Zhu, a True God powerhouse among the itinerant cultivators, his strength not weak.

When Ye Yuan and the three factions were disputing, he had long already planned on secretly ambushing.

He found the best angle to sneak attack and wanted to snatch away the Stellar War Banner as soon as he killed Ye Yuan, and then escape.

It was just that he never would have dreamed that Ye Yuan beat him half-death with just one move. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan looked at the few people with a smile that was not a smile and said coolly, “Why aren’t you rushing up anymore? Don’t you all want the Stellar War Banner? It’s right here, so come and get it!”

The expressions of Ji Kang and the rest were very ugly. Ye Yuan this fellow was really provoking without any scruples!

“Boy, if you want to seek death, then we’ll fulfill your wish! Yang Yidao, Zuo Pan, we’ll attack together! This old man wants to see whether or not this boy has three heads and six arms!” Ji Kang said in a cold voice.

Yang Yidao and the rest all nodded and said, “Okay! Kill this brat first, and then we’ll slowly settle things among ourselves after!”

Clearly, these few people reached a consensus and were going to join hands to deal with Ye Yuan.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

One powerful aura after another suddenly released, rushing over toward Ye Yuan. Heaven and earth changed colors.

Inside the Law Enforcement Hall, Fang Tian and the rest had deathly pale complexions.

The powerful undulations coming from the direction of the Godsfall Mountain Range made the entire world shudder!

This surpassed the power of a small world!

They all, these people who lived in a small world, had never experienced such terrifying power before at all.

In their eyes, this kind of power was sufficient to destroy the Immortal Grove World!

“No wonder Ye Yuan said that even he had no confidence this time. Just what bunch of monsters entered this time?!” Fang Tian said in shock.

“Could it be that ... Ye Yuan is currently fighting with these monsters? This ... Just what level has he reached now?” Skydistant said.

An incomparably powerful Heavenly Dao power was injected into the Stellar War Banner frenziedly.

The Stellar War Banner suddenly expanded a little more again.

The skies turned dim, motes of stars dotting the sky, converging onto the Stellar War Banner once more.

Ye Yuan suddenly waved the war banner, an even more powerful force than before suddenly gushed out, colliding together with the few great True God powerhouses.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Space tore apart, the earth split open!

Ji Kang, Yang Yidao, and the rest were directly blasted flying away by this tremendous force.

Of course, facing such terrifying power, Ye Yuan also suffered a considerable backlash.

But this was nothing. Right now, everyone’s gazes that looked towards him was akin to seeing ghosts.

A Third Firmament Celestial Deity, carrying an empyrean spirit treasure, overpowered several Ninth Firmament True God powerhouses.

This battle achievement simply made their heads explode!

“How is this possible? How in the world did he do it?”

“Even if it’s an initial-stage True God Realm powerhouse, it’s also impossible to rely on an empyrean spirit treasure to resist the teaming up of Lord Ji Kang and Lord Yang Yidao they all, right?”

“Everyone thought that Ye Yuan was a soft persimmon, who knew that this fellow was a diamond!”

...

Ji Kang and the rest forcefully endured the upheaval of their innards, using extremely shocked gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

The strength that Ye Yuan just displayed was practically the same as theirs!

No, it should be that it was even a notch higher than theirs!

Because Ye Yuan blocked the few of their combined attacks by himself!

This ... How was this possible?

“Don’t each and every one of you guys crack yourselves up to be powerhouses? Doesn’t strength reign supreme? This is your strength? It’s also merely thus!” Ye Yuan said with a mocking look.
