Chapter 2220: Disregarded

Ye Yuan’s footsteps stopped, and then the smile on his face gradually disappeared.

By the side, Empyrean Flutterfeather sighed slightly, knowing that this matter could not be settled anymore today.

Before coming, he exhorted over and over again, for Heavenly Emperor Riverback to not mention the past, and just to acknowledge their faults sincerely. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

That way, maybe there was still a trace of salvaging.

But Heavenly Emperor Riverback capitalized on his status and talked about the past.

With Ye Yuan’s temper, how could he let the matter drop?

Sure enough, Ye Yuan laughed coldly and said, “Fellow Daoist Riverback, isn’t your face red from saying this? You all touch your hearts first. The Myriad Treasure Tower’s these several thousand years of glory, who did it rely on? Was it me, Ye Yuan, who received favors from your Myriad Treasure Tower’s light? Or was it your Myriad Treasure Tower who received favors from my, Ye Yuan’s light!”

Over these thousand years, the Myriad Treasure Tower could be said to be unprecedentedly powerful.

The profits that they earned were as much as the past several tens of thousands of years added up, even several hundreds of thousands of years.

With such a huge profit as support, the Myriad Treasure Tower naturally groomed countless powerhouses too.

And this profit was all created from Ye Yuan’s pill formulas!

Ever since Ye Yuan entered the Heavenspan World, the special pill formulas were given to the Myriad Treasure Tower. Its value could virtually buy a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda!

Especially after the last Cloudpill Summit, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s reputation developed to the peak.

What Ye Yuan returned to the Myriad Treasure Tower was much greater than what he took.

He, Ye Yuan, had always repaid with precious jade after receiving a peach fruit when making friends.

Ye Yuan being able to leave with his mind set at ease was equivalent to entrusting Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Although he treated the Myriad Treasure Tower as a friend, in the end, the Myriad Treasure Tower only treated him as a partner of interest.

When Heavenly Eagle needed help the most, the Myriad Treasure Tower pulled the firewood out from under the boiler.

They stopped caring!

What difference was this kind of action from kicking you down the cliff with one foot?

Even though the Myriad Treasure Tower did not take part in the besieging this time, they were one of the accomplices too!

Ye Yuan was clear in his heart that with the Myriad Treasure Tower’s present strength, they could definitely withstand the heavy pressure of the Southern Border Alliance.

At the very least, preserving Heavenly Eagle was still achievable.

But they shrunk back!

They felt that with Heavenly Eagle losing him, it lost its utility value. Hence, they directly sold Heavenly Eagle out.

Only then did Ye Yuan come to realize the truth. It turned out that Myriad Treasure Tower was merely a group of merchants who were trying to outwit the other in the end!

Merchants only ever pursued profits!

But Empyrean Flutterfeather was a different type.

Heavenly Emperor Riverback’s old face turned red. He knew that what Ye Yuan said was not false!

In reality, he was also an indirect beneficiary.

But the pride of a Heavenly Emperor made him unable to lower his head.

Saying some self-degrading words was already his limit.

And Ye Yuan’s attitude also thoroughly infuriated him.

Heavenly Emperor Riverback’s gaze turned dark, and he said, “Ye Yuan, this Heavenly Emperor humbled himself and pleaded with well-meaning advice, but you’re pushing people too far! Don’t you forget! The pill formulas are still grasped in the hands of the Myriad Treasure Tower! If we publicize the pill formulas, you should know the consequences!”

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Emperor Riverback like looking at a fool and grinned as he said, “As long as you’re happy!”

After he was done talking, he turned to Flutterfeather and said, “Elder Brother Flutterfeather, since Ji Mo that fellow came, I conveniently extorted some rank seven spirit medicines. These two days, I just happened to refine several Emergence Spirit Ascension Pills. It should be sufficient for you to cultivate for a period of time. As for Elder Brother Chaoyuan there, I’m having a bit of a headache.”

Ye Yuan patted his head, an appearance of his head hurting.

He was indeed feeling some headache!

The matter this time, the two people that Ye Yuan owed the biggest favor to were Empyrean Flutterfeather and Empyrean Chaoyuan.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s situation was still fine. He still had room to go up.

But Empyrean Chaoyuan, his situation was to reach the Heavenly Emperor Realm!

Where would he go and pool together another set of Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill’s spirit medicines?

By the side, Heavenly Emperor Riverback’s gaze turned intent.

Those were end spirit divine pills!

At present, when a medicinal pill that Ye Yuan personally refined was placed outside, it was a priceless treasure.

One end spirit Emergence Spirit Ascension Pill, even if exchanging for a rank eight divine pill, there would also absolutely be someone who would swap.

But he actually gave it to Empyrean Flutterfeather like giving a cabbage!

The moment he gave Empyrean Flutterfeather, it was several pills!

These medicinal pills were sufficient for Empyrean Flutterfeather to cultivate to the peak Empyrean Realm.

“Brat, you’re too condescending! You’ll pay the price for your arrogance!” Heavenly Emperor Riverback had a feeling of being disregarded and said furiously.

But it was like Ye Yuan did not hear him. He then said to Flutterfeather, “Oh, right, Elder Brother, here are my Alchemy Dao experiences these few years. You can take it and have a look. Let’s improve together.”

Flutterfeather’s gaze turned slightly intent and his breathing became ragged.

Compared to medicinal pills, this jade slip was more valuable!

“Ye Yuan, are you really going to force yourself into a dead end? People who dare to become enemies with my Myriad Treasure Tower all didn’t have a good ending!” Heavenly Emperor Riverback said furiously.

Ye Yuan said, “Brother Flutterfeather, call Elder Brother Chaoyuan tomorrow too. Let’s get good and drunk!”

Heavenly Emperor Riverback was speechless.

He seriously could not stay on in this place anymore.

After Heavenly Emperor Riverback left, Flutterfeather sighed slightly and said, “Why is there a need for this, Younger Brother? Could it be that ... you’re really not scared that the Myriad Treasure Tower publicize the pill formulas?”

Ye Yuan smiled mysteriously and said, “Pill formulas? Heh heh, using my pill formulas to threaten me, I really don’t know if that guy’s brain is made out of tofu or not! If Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure is smart, he should restrain himself a little! They should prop you up! With you around, some things can still be discussed. If they offend you, heh heh ... Myriad Treasure Tower’s business in the Southern Border will come to an end too!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s expression turned slightly somber. Only then did he know that Ye Yuan’s trump card was no longer some pill formulas long ago.

Perhaps from the very beginning, he never placed these pill formulas in his sights!

Yeah, using Ye Yuan’s own pill formulas to threaten him, wasn’t this a joke?

... ...

“Master, this snotty brat is too condescending, completely making light of our Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma! In my view, we should publicize the pill formulas now and ally with the other two parties to deal with this punk together! Isn’t his Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma just a measly little First Firmament Heavenly Emperor? Can they still become enemies with the entire Southern Border?”

Returning to Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma, Heavenly Emperor Riverback had a look of rage.

He was Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s eldest disciple and followed Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure the longest. His status in Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma was also extremely high.

It was just that he said it with a look of exultation, but he did not notice that Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s expression already become extremely ugly.

After he finished saying, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure laughed coldly and said, “Riverback, are you a pig? This Heavenly Emperor made you represent the Myriad Treasure Tower to go to apologize to him. But then you ran over to show off your power and prestige to Ye Yuan? Did your brain short-circuit?! Is a Heavenly Emperor very impressive? Don’t you know that Ye Yuan used a medicinal pill and forcefully created a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse? If not for the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill’s spirit medicines being too rare, Empyrean Chaoyuan would be Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma’s second one! In the future, there will still be a third, a fourth!”

Heavenly Emperor Riverback was scolded until he was struck senseless. His master had never flared up with such a temper before.

What was going on this time?

“Do you think that those few lousy pill formulas are very impressive? Using the pill formulas that Ye Yuan handed to us to threaten him, was your head kicked by a donkey?” The more Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure scolded, the more enraged he became, showing a disappointed appearance of expecting better from him.
