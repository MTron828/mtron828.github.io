Chapter 2785: If You Had Long Known What Would Happen Today, Why Behave Like That Back Then!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No one felt that Waycloud was disgraceful. This was because each of them was very frightened.

The stream of sword energy that Ye Yuan left behind actually directly garroted a Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Then how strong was he now?

Inestimable!

One had to know, even the sword energy that Zhuo Bufan left behind could not kill them!

Previously, they all thought that Ye Yuan had his road of martial arts cut off, directly exiling him to the Land of Heavenly South.

But now, Ye Yuan experienced three-nine Dao tribulation and soared to the heavens in one move!

Although his cultivation realm did not increase much, his strength made tremendous improvements and already towered above everyone!

If he wanted to kill people, no one could escape!

“Ye Yuan, it was all this exalt’s fault previously! This exalt was blinded by obsession too, p-please forgive me!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon also said fearfully.

Ye Yuan smiled and said,?“Huhu,?this Ye merely invited everyone here to exchange notes on Martial Dao. Is everyone thinking too much? Alright, the comparing of notes is already pretty much done. Let’s go back to our own homes. Brother Luo, Big Yellow, let’s go!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan ignored the dumbfounded crowd and left straightaway.

Seeing Ye Yuan disappeared on the horizon, Saint Exalt Waycloud’s entire body relaxed, his shirt already drenched.

Just now, the pressure that Ye Yuan gave to him was suffocating!

“W-What does he mean by this? Could it be that … he’s letting us off just like this?” One of the Saint Sovereign Heavens said with a dazed look.

“Let us off??Huhu,?

how is that possible? Have you forgotten what he said at the Pill Alliance’s mountain pass gates?” Skyfortune said with a bitter smile.

That Saint Sovereign Heaven’s expression changed, and he said, “He … He wants us to hand over the Pill Alliance’s fortune with both hands?”

Upon Skyfortune’s reminder, he remembered too.

Ye Yuan once said that in the future, even if they all delivered it in front of him, he would still have to consider it!

At that time, everyone present thought that that was merely just desperately upholding face. That was all.

But who knew that in this short few months’ time, Ye Yuan’s words really came true!

“Deliver with both hands??Huhu,?if it was so simple, that would be good! Back then, we directly excluded Heavenly South because of momentary greed. Now, we’ll probably have to repay it twofold! Waycloud, you’ve caused me much harm!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said with a cold snort.

Waycloud snorted coldly and said, “Don’t forget, your All-Saint Temple took 60%! Now, you’re criticizing after it’s already over?”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon said in a great rage, “If not for your beguiling, how could this exalt have done this sort of thing!”

“Rubbish! It was clearly you who coveted the wealth. Now you want to put the blame on me? Alright! If you throw to me, Ye Yuan got to accept it too for it to work!” Waycloud said without giving in at all.

“Enough!”

Saint Exalt Purplesun gave a cold yell, saying in a solemn voice, “You all should be content! If not bearing in mind that we took action against the Pill Alliance and didn’t deal a killing blow to him afterward, we’d long be dead! Honestly speaking, Ye Yuan is an extremely rule-abiding person. If we didn’t discriminate against him afterward and didn’t chase the five great heavenly sects out of Five Great Heavenly Regions, he wouldn’t do anything to us now! This matter is ultimately us who went overboard!”

“It’s too late to say anything now! At this time, we can only each skin our own skunk and show our sincerity! If the sincerity isn’t enough, Ye Yuan won’t let us off!”

Finished saying, Saint Exalt Purplesun leaped and vanished into the horizon.

… …

A month later, the remote Heavenly South City became lively.

One Saint Sovereign Heaven after another stepped into Heavenly South City in fear and trepidation.

No one dared to step in here via flight!

These Saint Sovereign Heavens all landed outside of the city, then walked into the city.

“Younger Brother Luo, here is all the wealth that our Seven-star Heavenly Sect acquired at the Pill Alliance. We offer them all up now! Apart from these, we even prepared some small gifts. Younger Brother Luo, please kindly accept them!”

At this time, Saint Exalt Waycloud’s attitude was very humble. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

For the sake of the apology this time, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect could be said to have become bankrupt this time!

Apart from the wealth obtained at the Pill Alliance, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect even took out more than 70% of their sect’s wealth to apologize to Ye Yuan.

This could be said to be, tried to steal a chicken and ended up losing the rice!

Luo Yunqing sat on the seat of honor, his face expressionless, and he did not respond either.

Saint Exalt Waycloud was anxious until his forehead was covered in sweat. He knew that he was the most unwelcome one. Wanting to obtain Luo Yunqing’s forgiveness was much harder than the rest!

But at this time, he had no choice.

Ye Yuan completely refused to meet him. He could only think of every way possible to satisfy Luo Yunqing!

Suddenly, he gritted his teeth. Taking out a sword, he offered it up with both hands and said, “This Cloudsky Sword was gifted by Younger Brother Ye! Younger Brother Luo is still using a heavenly spirit treasure now. Using this sword will be just right!”

Luo Yunqing did not refuse, playing with the Cloudsky Sword for a moment, then he put it away.

“The grandmist treasures in your hands were all gifted by Ye Yuan! Now, it’s merely returning to the original owner. That’s all. Look at how it’s making your flesh hurt!” Luo Yunqing said with a cold smile.

Saint Exalt Waycloud smiled helplessly. He really could not bear to part with it!

With a grandmist treasure, his combat power would increase by at least 30%!

Now, he actually had to hand it back. He was naturally unwilling.

Luo Yunqing glanced at him indifferently and said, “Just these?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud hurriedly said, “Of course, there’s more! With regards to Younger Brother Ye’s suggestion, we feel that it’s very right! Regardless of whether it is native powerhouses or ascenders, those are all Heavenly Stratum powerhouses and shouldn’t make distinctions between each other! From now on, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect will no longer be hostile to ascenders and allow ascenders to enter the sect! In addition, Heavenly South is a tiny place after all. Our various sects have already pulled out of the Five Light Heavenly Region. We welcome the three great ascender heavenly sects to return.”

The five great heavenly sects only had three sects that still had Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses presently.

Only the other two sects did not have Saint Sovereign Heavens. They also had merely a few disciples in the sect. They basically only existed in name.

The five great heavenly sects only had three great heavenly sects left now.

Luo Yunqing gave him a nonchalant glance and said, “At least you’re sensible! Ye Yuan has instructed it; this is the last chance! In the future, if you all still cause problems, bear the consequences yourselves!”

“Dare not! We dare not!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud was overjoyed, repeatedly saying that he did not dare.

While on the other side, Saint Exalt Bull Demon looked toward Big Yellow and was silent for a long time.

“If you had long known what would happen today, why behave like that back then!” Big Yellow said with a cold snort.

“Sigh,?this exalt knows that I was wrong! But now, it’s too late for regrets! Big Yellow, looking on the account that you and I are brothers, help out our Myriad Demons Mountain!”

Big Yellow was someone who kept old friendships in mind, but he was very disappointed in Saint Exalt Bull Demon.

Burning the bridge after crossing it, dropping a rock down the well, this was the repayment that Saint Exalt Bull Demon gave Ye Yuan!

“Humph!?If not for Master Ye, could you have overcome the third Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation? The current you would probably have long turned into a pile of dirt! Brothers? That day, in the cave of the Pill Alliance, I begged you bitterly, but you? Did you think of brotherly feelings? Now, you know about brotherhood?” Big Yellow said with a cold smile.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon nodded and said, “Big Yellow, your choice is correct! However, Myriad Demons Mountain is your hometown. At any rate, you can’t very well passively watch it be destroyed, right?”

Big Yellow said coolly, “Relax. On account of my face, Master Ye won’t make things difficult for the Myriad Demons Mountain! However, you all have to conduct yourselves well because this is the last chance!”
