Chapter 1530 Guide

Outside of the ruins, two figures quietly appeared.

These two people were precisely Di En and Heavenstar who left and returned.

After several months of rest and recuperation, Heavenstar’s injuries were a little better.

But the damage that the Soul Suppressing Pearl caused to him was too great. Without 30 to 50 years, he could forget about recovering.

The two people appeared here because they lost contact with Yi Han and the others.

Looking at the empty mountains, the two people’s eyes revealed extreme shock.

“I didn’t expect that these ancient ruins themselves are the greatest treasure!” Di En’s eyes were filled with regret.

If he had long known this was the case, he would guard here without moving a step and absolutely not let the Purple Extreme Hall escape.

The corners of Heavenstar’s mouth also kept twitching and he said with gnashed teeth, “That kid has obtained no idea how much benefits! I wish to crush him into dregs right now!!”

The one with the greatest losses was Heavenstar.

The Blood Soul Curse that he had spent an immeasurable price to nurture was already completely destroyed now.

He even subserviently gave the Profound Yellow Cauldron to Ye Yuan in order to ingratiate himself to Ye Yuan.

Finally, he even had his soul force devoured by the Soul Suppressing Pearl, almost perishing.

Now, he also discovered that Ye Yuan moved the entire ruins away. How could he not be furious?

“Puhwark!”

Thinking of the detestable aspects aggravated his injuries, Heavenstar spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

Di En gave him a glance rather pitifully and said with a sigh, “There’s some trouble now! There’s totally no way to find out this kid’s origins. Source Night this name appeared very suddenly too. Now, he’s gone. We also don’t have any head or tail if we want to track him.”

Hearing Di En’s words, Heavenstar almost spewed out another mouthful of old blood.

Nothing was more sorrowful than this. He actually did not even know who his opponent was!

“Could it be that ... we’re going to let him off just like this?” Heavenstar said unwillingly.

Di En smiled coldly and said, “Let him off? How is that possible! Suffering such a huge loss, do you think that Lord Hall Master will let him off? Relax, even though there isn’t his news for the time being, a genius such as him, the light can’t be hidden! How can an alchemist capable of triggering Great Dao Heavenly Melody be buried in the dust?”

...

The imperial city’s prosperity was far from what capital cities could compare to. Not anybody had the qualifications to enter too.

Entering the imperial city required paying divine essence stones.

Ye Yuan looked at the clearly marked prices on the city gates and the corners of his mouth could not help twitching too.

Ten-day temporary token, 500 low-grade divine essence stones.

One-year temporary token, 5000 low-grade divine essence stones.

Ten-year temporary token, 50 thousand low-grade divine essence stones.

100-year temporary token, 500 thousand low-grade divine essence stones.

Permanent token, 50 million low-grade divine essence stones.

Inside the imperial city, people without identity tokens would be directly blotted out.

When the token expired, people who remained behind would be directly annihilated.

This price, ordinary martial artists could not afford it at all!

An Origin Deity Realm martial artist’s entire net worth was merely a million low-grade divine essence stones.

This was also to say that an Origin Deity Realm powerhouse spending all of his assets could only stay in the imperial city for several hundred years.

Several hundred years of time were merely a snap of a finger to an Origin Deity Realm powerhouse.

Furthermore, spending so much divine essence stones, it was also just buying an identity token.

Want to survive in the imperial city, one still needed to find a place to stay. That was also another considerable expense.

Hence, wanting to stay in the Imperial city, one needed to keep making money continuously!

But even if it was so expensive, there were still countless powerhouses that flocked here like ducks.

Imperial city and capital city were two entirely different concepts.

At the beginning of each imperial city’s establishment, enormous spirit gathering formations would be set up underground.

The spiritual energy in imperial cities was extremely plentiful. Staying here, even you did not deliberately cultivate, the growth rate of divine essence could also compare to capital cities. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Hence, even if this identity token was more expensive, people would still yearn for this place.

And the divine essence stones collected each year by the imperial city’s city lord manor was an astronomical figure.

“Next!” The city guard selling tokens said lazily.

“A 200-year identity token.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

That city guard’s eyebrows raised, looking at Ye Yuan with some surprise.

Rich!

When purchasing temporary identity tokens, most were one year or ten year periods. A 100-year period was seriously too expensive. The average person could not afford it at all.

Ye Yuan could feel the richness of the imperial city’s spiritual energy. This made him rather moved.

If he could, he planned on settling down here.

One million divine essence stones were just a light drizzle to the Ye Yuan who was in possession of five billion.

“Tsk tsk, no idea which capital city’s young master this is, so rich!”

“Sigh, the life of a magnate always makes people envy.”

“Comparing people to people is indeed odious! If I had so much money, how good would it be!”

...

The city guard gave Ye Yuan a profound glance and handed two tokens to him.

Ye Yuan received the token indifferently and left.

“Heh, another hothead. Reckon that a few days after entering the city, he’ll be toyed to death by people,” the city guard said with a laugh to his companion.

“Haha, that isn’t something that we have to worry about. As long as it doesn’t cause too much trouble, it’s fine,” his companion said with a laugh.

The two people’s gaze when looking at Ye Yuan leaving had a gloating look.

Ye Yuan had just entered the city gates and a bunch of men by the roadside came up to greet.

“Heh, this little brother looks very unfamiliar, first time entering the city, right? Want a guide or not? I’m called Ah Four. Not that I’m bragging to you, this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s major streets and small alleys, there isn’t one that I’m not familiar with! One day just needs ten pieces of divine essence stones, equally honest with the elderly and young children!”

“Little Brother, don’t listen to him talk nonsense. I, Hu San, am the know-all here!”

“Little Brother, let me be a guide, guarantee your satisfaction!”

...

A group of men clamored to get a word in, directly surrounding Ye Yuan in the middle.

The imperial city’s boundary was too big. It was not what can be familiarized in two or three days.

Many people were only very familiar with a small region after staying here for a year.

Therefore, it gave birth to being a guide, this occupation.

When newcomers entered the city for the first time, they did not know their way at all.

Ye Yuan came to find Little Fatty. Without a guide leading the way, he would probably have to take quite a few detours.

Ye Yuan swept a glance and directly threw ten pieces of divine essence stones to that Ah Four and said coolly, “You then, bring me to the Myriad Treasure Tower.”

This Ah Four looked very slick, his reaction was very sharp too.

With him leading the way, perhaps it could save considerable trouble. Hence, Ye Yuan chose him.

Ah Four received the divine essence stones and said with an excited look, “Okay!”

Finished talking, Ah Four led Ye Yuan away.

The other guys all revealed disappointed looks. But after the two people went far away, they started discussing.

“What a big fat sheep. Didn’t even bat an eyelid taking out a million divine essence stones!”

“Ah Four this punk is too crafty. A moment of carelessness and he took the lead again.”

“Done with this job, Ah Four this kid probably doesn’t need to come out and work for a while.”

...

Ye Yuan already left and naturally could not hear these people’s discussions. Ah Four was currently introducing to Ye Yuan the imperial city’s local customs and practices with spittle flying everywhere.
