Ye Yuan looked at the giant mountain, his heart cold and indifferent.

No one was clearly than him what the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain signified.

It was where Dao was located, the epitome of the Heavenspan Great Dao.

Ye Yuan connecting it to the Immortal Grove World, the Immortal Grove World was no longer that fragile and dilapidated small world.

In front of Heavenspan Great Dao, so what ... even if Heavenly Emperor?

“Jiu Shang, my father died in your hands. Our enmity is irreconcilable under the heavens! I’m powerless to kill you today, but ... there will come one day where I’ll make your soul dissipate! Get lost!”

Ye Yuan flicked his sleeves grandly, the giant mountain quietly dissipated. A stream of black gas rushed to the sky.

“Punk, today’s matter, this emperor has remembered it! After you go to the Heavenspan World, you ... will die without a doubt!”

Bang!

The black gas directly punched a hole above the void and disappeared.

Looking in the direction Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang disappeared, a hint of regret flowed out of Ye Yuan’s eyes.

The Immortal Grove World was a new Immortal Grove World.

But his strength was still too weak!

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were naturally not that easy to kill.

Moreover, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was even a fiend race Heavenly Emperor famous for having a tenacious life force.

This level of a powerhouse, he could not kill him.

If not for Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove seriously injuring Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang previously, even if he brought out the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, it would still be difficult to escape death.

But after today, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang suffered a heavy wound, he likely could not recover to his peak state anymore within several tens of thousands of years.

Whoosh whoosh ...

Two dark shadows suddenly shot up to the sky, wanting to follow in Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s footsteps and escape the Immortal Grove World.

Ye Yuan looked and just laughed coldly: “Can’t kill Jiu Shang doesn’t mean I can’t kill you guys! Since you came, then stay behind forever!”

With a wave of a hand, the mountain appeared again.

Bang!

Two great fiend race Empyreans were directly suppressed by the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and did not even let out a scream and already turned to ashes.

These two were merely initial-stage Empyrean Realm powerhouses. Compared to Jiu Shang, they were worlds apart.

For Ye Yuan to want to kill them, it naturally did not take much effort.

It was just that this scene in other people’s eyes was totally not the case.

Zhao Min and Du Hong two people, their faces turned pale.

Ever since stepping into Empyrean Realm, they had never felt before such immense pressure.

“This ... This ... Ye Yuan, the matter previously, it was all a m-misunderstanding,” Zhao Min said with an ugly expression.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was like a torch as he said coolly, “At this time, you’re telling me that it’s a misunderstanding? Along the way, your Celestial Deity Realm disciples wanted to kill me, True God Realm elders wanted to kill me, and even you, this Empyrean powerhouse, also threatened to kill me. Now, you’re telling me that it’s a misunderstanding?”

Zhao Min’s expression was extremely ugly and he defended himself with sophistry: “You ... You can’t touch me! I ... I’m Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital’s grand elder!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital? What the hell is that! I even dared to suppress a Heavenly Emperor, do you think that I’d care about offending a great imperial capital?”

When Zhao Min heard that, his expression was extremely ugly.

Yeah!

Ye Yuan already provoked a colossal giant like Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang. So would he still care about the Empyrean-level Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital?

“Alright, don’t harbor hopes of getting lucky anymore! You guys, none of you can escape!”

While talking, Ye Yuan pointed a finger out. The wind and clouds changed colors.

One blue fine-line after another condensed and gathered on his fingertip and suddenly fired out.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Ji Kang, Ji Xun, and Xu Xing, directly turned to ashes.

The Empyrean Devilfeather inside Ji Xun’s sea of consciousness was also exterminated cleanly along with it.

Zhao Min’s gaze turned intent, grabbing at Leng Qiuling like lightning.

This scene happened too suddenly, everyone did not react in time.

However, he was fast, but Ye Yuan was faster than him!

With a flash, Ye Yuan already blocked in front of Leng Qiuling.

Bang!

Ye Yuan pointed another finger out, Zhao Min seemed to have been struck by lightning, his figure falling back wildly without ceasing.

Right at this time, the giant mountain landed once more.

Bang!

An Empyrean powerhouse of his generation was directly suppressed to death by Ye Yuan.

The others looked at this scene with their hearts beating in fear, not daring to even breathe.

Under the new Heavenly Dao, Ye Yuan was too powerful!

The most terrifying was still that giant mountain, killing Empyreans like killing dogs!

Done with these, Ye Yuan reached his hand out and pointed, a black hole appeared in the void.

“All of you leave!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The remaining people all looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief. Du Hong said with surprise, “You ... You’re really letting us go?”

At this very moment, this Immortal Grove World was like a giant cage to them.

Inside this cave, no matter monstrous your power was, you also had to be suppressed by Ye Yuan.

If it were them, they absolutely would not let these people leave.

But Ye Yuan actually let them go.

Hence, they did not dare to believe it at all, feeling that Ye Yuan was deliberately digging a pit for them.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “Before I change my mind, hurry up and get lost!”

Du Hong’s expression changed, his figure moving, speeding over towards that black hole.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan did not do anything to stop.

With Du Hong taking the lead, the others were akin to being relieved of a heavy burden, all following and leaving the Immortal Grove World.

Ye Yuan looked at Leng Qiuling and said, “What are your plans?”

Leng Qiuling looked at Gu Tianque beside her and looked at Ye Yuan again, shaking her head as she said, “I ... I don’t know either.”

Ye Yuan smiled, fished out a piece of Seven-Colored Aegirine, threw it to Gu Tianque, and said, “Senior Gu, Ye Yuan is indebted to your care a few days ago and has nothing to repay you with. Just take this Seven-Colored Aegirine as remuneration then!”

Gu Tianque’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan with a startled face as he said, “Is ... Is Honorable Nephew joking?”

With the Seven-Colored Aegirine, he absolutely had the confidence to break through to the Empyrean Realm.

At that time, so what if Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Gu, you were implicated by Ye Yuan. Leaving this Immortal Grove World, you likely can’t be the city lord anymore. Previously, in front of Ji Xun, Senior Gu also protected me. This piece of Seven-Colored Aegirine, just take it as Ye Yuan’s gratitude. As for Qiuling, she probably can’t return to Thousand Soar Imperial Capital anymore as well. So she can follow me from today onward if she wants to.”

Ye Yuan killed the Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital’s Empyrean powerhouses and already sowed irreconcilable enmity with them.

Gu Tianque and Leng Qiuling two people were the closest to him, this was what everyone saw.

If they returned, they were definitely nothing good to gain out of it.

Gu Tianque was different from Leng Qiuling, he previously thought that Ye Yuan came from some major faction, that was why he viewed Ye Yuan in a different light.

When fighting for the Seven-Colored Aegirine, Ye Yuan already determined Gu Tianque’s character.

As for Leng Qiuling, Ye Yuan already regarded her as a friend, it was naturally different.

Gu Tianque hurriedly said, “Huhu, this old man obtaining this Seven-Colored Aegirine, I’ll definitely need to enter closed-seclusion and won’t be able to take care of Qiulin. Then I’ll have to trouble Little Friend Ye to take good care of this obedient disciple of mine.”

In his eyes, Ye Yuan definitely took fancy to Leng Qiuling, that was why he would put down such a high stake.

Leng Qiuling still had an icy-cold appearance, but disappointment flashed across her eyes.

Ye Yuan naturally knew what Gu Tianque was thinking in his heart, but he would not explain anything either. He just clasped his hands and said, “Senior Gu, take care.”
