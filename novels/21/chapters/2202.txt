Chapter 2206: Collecting Ancient Records

To this day, Chen Yan still felt that he was having a dream.

The Chen Village actually became a Deity Realm village!

Even those brats who were still wet behind their ears, after consuming Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, they also broke through to Deity Realm overnight.

Ye Yuan’s pair of hands was seemingly able to transform the rotten into something magical.

The Deity Realm that was as high as the clouds in their eyes, Ye Yuan could casually create them.

And now, even Cloudriver City’s city lord was waiting outside of the village respectfully, not daring to have the least bit of arrogance.

That was Cloudriver City’s city lord, an Origin Deity Realm mighty expert!

Origin Deity Realm was once an unreachable existence to the Chen Village, a figure in the heavens.

But now, he was actually standing outside the village obediently.

Drawing a deep breath, Chen Yan pushed the door and went in. Ye Yuan was currently holding his superficial Alchemy Dao records and classics, and reading with great gusto.

“A’Ning!” Chen Yan called smilingly.

Ye Yuan put down the book, got up, and said with a smile, “Grandpa Yan.”

Chen Yan smiled and waved his hand, indicating for Ye Yuan to sit down, and saw, “Oh, A’Ning, this old man’s books probably can’t enter your sights at all, right?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said seriously, “Although Grandpa Yan’s books are shallow, I still learned many things from them. Uh ... I’ve already finished reading these books and made some remarks on them.”

Reading these Alchemy Dao records, Ye Yuan understood with one glance and did not have the slightest feeling of sluggishness.

Ye Yuan seemed to be able to find his own past from them.

Chen Yan received them to take a look and could not help trembling all over.

It was only to see that many things were recorded densely on the records.

Ye Yuan’s casual annotations immediately enlightened many areas that he did not understand in the past!

Briefly reading a few lines, he actually had a feeling of being enlightened.

Ye Yuan’s casual annotations were already no idea how many times more brilliant than the contents in these books.

Chen Yan was sure that Ye Yuan’s level was definitely a thousand times, even ten thousand times more brilliant than the people who wrote the books!

“Incisive! Truly penetrating! A’Ning, you must have been an incredible high-level Alchemy God in the past!” Chen Yan sighed with admiration as he said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said with a nod, “I also feel that way, regardless of whether it is refining pills or reading books, I have a very familiar feeling. It’s as if I was born for the sake of refining pills. Oh, right, is Grandpa Yan finding me for something?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Only then did Chen Yan wake up from the shock and said rather embarrassedly, “Almost forgot the official matters! Cloudriver City’s city lord has come to realize the truth. Lord Huang Wei brought the family heads of the five major families in the city, and they personally came to our Chen Village to request an audience with you. They don’t dare to come in and disturb and are currently waiting outside the village.”

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said, “To see me?”

Chen Yan smiled bitterly and said, “Our Chen Village, the old and young, have all become Deity Realm powerhouses now. It already shocked all the neighboring households.Iit’s also not strange that City Lord knows. The status of Alchemy Gods is venerated. He’s definitely coming to find you to request for pills.”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “I’ll meet him then.”

... ...

When Huang Wei and the few major family heads saw Ye Yuan, they were utterly stunned.

The one who created a Deity Realm village overnight was an ordinary person who did not even have divine essence?

He looked towards Chen Yan rather strangely, wondering if this guy was playing them.

Chen Yan hurriedly explained, “City Lord, A’Ning has always maneuvered heaven and earth spiritual energy to refine pills with array formations and doesn’t need medicinal cauldrons or divine essence.”

Huang Wei’s whole body trembled and he cried out in surprise, “Hiss ... array formation refining pills!”

The few people exchanged glances and bowed respectfully toward Ye Yuan and said, “Cloudriver City’s city lord, Huang Wei, offers greetings to Master Ning!”

Ye Yuan returned the bow and said, “Your Excellency doesn’t have to be courteous.”

Huang Wei said, “This city lord’s intention of coming, I believe that Master Ning already knows. However ... I still want to witness Master’s medicinal pills.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Grandpa Yan.”

Chen Yan understood and took out a jade bottle and passed it to Huang Wei.

Huang Wei received the medicinal bottle and only took one look and cried out in surprise, “This is ... Profound Origin Pill! What a high-quality Profound Origin Pill! Master Shu Ping, you come and take a look!”

As he said, he passed the medicinal pill to an old man beside him.

Very clearly, this old man was also an Alchemy God, a Two-star Alchemy God!

Shu Ping’s breaking was already somewhat losing control starting from when he saw the medicinal pill.

He received the Profound Origin Pill somewhat tremblingly and started looking closely at it.

When everyone saw Shu Ping’s expression, each and every one of them felt lost.

They knew that this medicinal pill’s quality was very high, but as for the specifics of how high, they did not know.

Shu Ping looked at it and tears actually strewn down his old face as he wept and said, “Didn’t expect it! Truly didn’t expect it! Having seen this pill, this old man can die without regrets!”

His expression whetted everyone’s appetites.

Yet, this old guy was performing there alone and refused to talk about the subject of the matter.

Huang Wei could not resist asking, “Master Shu Ping, just what ... is so extraordinary about this medicinal pill?”

Only then did Shu Ping woke up and said with lingering palpitations in his heart, “Vast spirit divine pill! This is a vast spirit divine pill! Being able to see a vast spirit divine pill in this lifetime, this old man can die without regrets!”

The other few people trembled all over, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of horror.

Vast spirit divine pill, that was a medicinal pill of the legends!

Even if a Five-star Alchemy God came, it was also completely impossible to refine a vast spirit divine pill!

Now, it actually appeared in a county’s small village.

This young man absolutely had an extraordinary background!

While Chen Yan had a baffled look, he completely did not know what a vast spirit divine pill was.

But seeing that the expression of a Two-star Alchemy God was at a loss whether to cry or laugh, he also knew that it was unusual.

It seemed like he still underestimated A’Ning!

Huang Wei suddenly got up and gave a respectful bow towards Ye Yuan and said, “Master Ning’s great talent is too unworthy of this small village. Is it possible for you to move to the City Lord Manor? As long as Master Ning goes to the City Lord Manor, this Huang will definitely treat you cordially to the highest standards!”

Chen Yan’s expression changed. This fellow was snatching people!

“No way!” He said without the slightest hesitation.

Huang Wei’s face fell. Normally, someone with a status like Chen Yan would have long been smacked to death by him with one slap.

But this way, he would be offending Master Ning.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s no need to go to the City Lord Manor. There’s no problem with you guys coming to find me to refine pills, but ... I have a condition.”

Hearing the first half of the sentence, Huang Wei had a look of disappointment.

At the latter half, he had an enthusiastic look again as he said, “What condition is there? Master Ning, feel free to speak up!”

Ye Yuan said, “Help me collect Alchemy Dao records. No matter what kind they are, however many there are, the more the merrier!”

Huang Wei had a curious look as he said, “Master Ning, with your alchemy strength, is there still a need to look at these Alchemy Dao records?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There is no end to learning. There’s no harm in reading more books.”

Huang Wei and the rest revealed looks of admiration and said with a nod, “Master Ning, rest assured. Leave this small matter to this Huang!”

At this time, Shu Ping suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Master Ning, this Shu knows quite a few people in the same pursuit, getting some Alchemy Dao records shouldn’t be anything difficult. This Shu doesn’t request for medicinal pills. I only request to be able to stay by Master Ning’s side and observe you refining pills from the sidelines. I wonder if that’s allowed?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “No problem.”
