Chapter 1521 Misty Sword Art!

“It’s useless! Although your spatial laws are strong, the level that you comprehended is too low. Give up!” said the cold woman indifferently.

“Heh, that might not be the case! Fight again!”

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, unleashing Phantom Kill once more.

The cold-looking woman did not speak. The ice domain spread out, the sword tip not leaving Ye Yuan’s surroundings.

The two people were top experts in the power of laws. It was the first time Ye Yuan’s power of law met its match.

He urged his movement technique to the limit but was still unable to break through the woman.

Her ice domain was like a large net, binding Ye Yuan’s hands and feet.

Actually, Ye Yuan was not the woman’s match.

Ye Yuan’s true killing move was using Daybreak under the state of Phantom Kill.

Daybreak, this move, shattered myriad moves under the heaven.

Especially when Ye Yuan was extremely sensitive toward sword moves. He had already found the cold woman’s weakness long ago.

It was just that this way, he would not be able to have comprehensions in spatial laws anymore.

He wanted to force himself to the limits, making himself comprehend spatial laws under the state of extremity.

Presently, a link already formed between his Sword Dao laws and spatial laws.

Ye Yuan discovered that communicating with spatial laws through Sword Dao laws yielded twice the results with half the effort.

Even though his opponent previously was strong, he did not reach the cold woman’s level.

Facing her, Ye Yuan really brought out all of his strength.

Under this kind of state, it was easier for Ye Yuan to break through.

Ye Yuan discovered that these ancient geniuses all had unique insights into the power of laws.

Just like this woman, being able to integrate Sword Dao laws and ice laws to such a degree, she was absolutely an extraordinary talent back then, her strength reigning that era.

This kind of exchange was two completely different concepts from Ye Yuan fighting with himself inside the Death Cultivation Space.

Being his own opponent was surpassing time and again; a vertical development.

But competing with these geniuses was gathering the strong points of everyone; a horizontal development.

Ye Yuan could fight with himself non-stop. But it was a rare opportunity to exchange blows with these ancient geniuses.

“It is no use. Your divine essence is consumed too fast like this! Still don’t pull back, you’ll die!” The woman’s icy voice came over.

Although the woman was an ice beauty, she clearly had the appreciation of a talent stirred by Ye Yuan, and that was why she would warn like so.

Except, Ye Yuan disregarded other people’s opinion. He did not listen to her words at all.

“Humph! Stubborn and thickheaded!”

When the woman saw that Ye Yuan did not listen to the advice, she did not hold back anymore as well, her long sword suddenly accelerating.

“Sword Clear Like Frost!”

This sword was the masterpiece of her Sword Dao!

A bone-piercingly cold Sword Dao law came from head-on, making Ye Yuan’s Phantom Kill practically freeze in the air.

The scent of death came from the front!

Pfft!

The two people’s figures intersected, their movements instantly freezing.

Drip!

Drip!

Ye Yuan’s abdomen was pierced by a large hole, blood running in torrents.

“Haha, this kid is finally defeated! Finally defeated! This time, it can’t be wrong, right?” Seeing this scene, Bu Zhe started laughing excitedly.

Everyone all heaved a long sigh in relief. The pressure that Ye Yuan brought to them was too great.

Overcoming all difficulties along the way, he actually already killed his way to the thirteenth round!

Especially Di Fan, he cleared until the ninth round in one go. He was deeply aware of how great the disparity between each round was.

One could say that the difficulty rose geometrically.

But Ye Yuan actually cleared four more rounds than him.

This disparity was too big!

Each time Ye Yuan cleared a round, it was like his heart had an additional large mountain.

Extremely heavy!

Now, seeing Ye Yuan get defeated, he could finally let out a sigh of relief.

But very soon, their expressions turned stiff on their faces.

“This ... How is this possible?” Ba Tu said in alarm.

In the projection, the woman’s figure gradually dissipated. This was the hallmark of being killed!

“It was clear that woman should have won. How ... How was she killed?” Di Fan said with a puzzled look.

In the space, the cold woman’s figure condensed once again. Her gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of shock.

“You’re a madman!” the woman said coldly.

Ye Yuan’s state was somewhat miserable. Even though he already revolved the Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art, the recovery speed clearly could not quite catch up to the speed of the power of laws’s destruction.

Hearing the woman’s words, Ye Yuan smiled tragically and said, “But I won, no? Furthermore ... I comprehended it!”

Earlier, when Ye Yuan was pushed to the limit, the initial-stage first-layered heaven spatial laws finally reached the realm of grand completion!

In that instant, Ye Yuan finally broke through the ice domain’s sealing, his figure traversing through space bizarrely, killing the woman first.

However, the woman’s Sword Clear Like Frost was also not for show. Under that small distance, it still pierced Ye Yuan’s abdomen.

The final outcome was that Ye Yuan was injured, while the cold woman died!

The cold-looking woman’s beautiful eyes swiveled and she said indifferently, “You won! Go to the next round then! You comprehended spatial laws, those few people at the back are all not your match anymore. However, the final round’s Zheng Jian is known as Purple Extreme Sect’s history’s strongest. You need to be careful! It’s said that he’s the same as you, also a madman!”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned stern. To be able to make the cold woman so solemn, he was definitely formidable to the extreme.

One had to know that this woman’s talent was absolutely rare in the world.

Being able to comprehend Sword Dao laws and ice laws to the third-layered heaven at half-step Origin Deity Realm, and merge into one, this was absolutely not what the average person could accomplish.

After Ye Yuan came to the Heavenspan World, he had also seen quite a few so-called geniuses. He had never encountered any capable of merging the power of laws before.

Among the people who came this time, he did not know if there were anyone who could fuse together the power of laws. But Ye Yuan reckoned that there should be no one able to make it to this thirteenth round.

It seemed like he really had to be a little careful with this Zheng Jian.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said with clasped hands, “Many thanks, I’ll be careful!”

The cold woman nodded slightly and directly transported Ye Yuan away.

In the array formation, Ye Yuan’s injuries and divine essence were rapidly recovering.

“What a powerful array formation, to actually be even more powerful than ordinary medicinal pills! This Purple Extreme Sect’s strength back then was likely extraordinary!”

Feeling the rapidly recovering injuries, Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

“Phantom Kill coupled with spatial laws, the power is indeed extraordinary! This sword art already can’t be called Phantom Kill anymore. What to call it? Uh ... This move’s mystery lies in its unpredictableness, making the opponent unable to grasp it. Why not call it ‘Misty Sword Art’ then!” Ye Yuan muttered to himself.

Currently, among Ye Yuan’s sword arts, it already contained quite a few spatial powers of laws.

The original Phantom Kill move already changed flavors.

This was a move that fused Sword Dao laws and spatial laws, similar to that of the cold woman’s Sword Clear Like Frost. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With the addition of spatial laws, Ye Yuan’s sword move became even more erratic and elusive.

Hence, Ye Yuan naming this new move as ‘Misty Sword Art’ was rather appropriate.
