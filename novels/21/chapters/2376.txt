Chapter 2382: Clashing in Secret!

Suddenly, an obscure sect, the Ziwei Sect, became lively. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

On this day, Originbright brought a white-browed old man and suddenly descended upon the Ziwei Sect.

Mo Qingshan and the rest were fearful and awed.

“Sect Master Mo, you guys are really so capable!”

Originbright’s words were full of derision.

Clearly, his resentment toward the Ziwei Sect was very deep.

By now, Ye Yuan’s connection with the Ziwei Sect had naturally been dug out long ago.

If it were in the past, the Ziwei Sect would have long turned to ashes.

But now, with Ye Yuan this sword of Damocles hanging up there, the divine race really did not dare to make a move on the Ziwei Sect.

Destroying a single Ziwei Sect was merely a trivial matter.

But once Ye Yuan was pissed off, the divine race would really find it impossible to defend effectively.

Therefore, they could only endure it.

Now, the divine race’s top priority was to find Ye Yuan, and then eliminate him!

This person’s existence posed too great a threat to them.

How could Mo Qingshan not discern the meaning in Originbright’s words? He hurriedly apologized, “Palace Lord, please calm your anger. Our Ziwei Sect is really not familiar with this person! We also don’t know why he ran to my Ziwei Sect.”

Originbright had a fake smile as he said, “Is that so? Then this palace lord wronged you?”

Mo Qingshan was alarmed and hurriedly bowed and said, “Palace Lord, calm your anger!”

Originbright sneered and said, “If that kid doesn’t die, how can this palace lord’s fury be appeased? Your dog head is temporarily left on your neck! After this palace lord kills that brat, I’ll come and take care of you!”

Originbright did not conceal his killing intent in the slightest. To him, a measly little Ziwei Sect could be destroyed with a flip of his hand.

Want to kill you, you did not even have the qualifications to flee!

But saying these words out showed his apprehension toward Ye Yuan.

If not out of fear toward Ye Yuan, why would he be standing here, talking rubbish with a puny little sect master?

This logic, Originbright understood; Mo Qingshan similarly understood it.

He was unbelievably shocked in his heart.

Previously, it was widely rumored that Ye Yuan went over to threaten the Sentry Celestial Palace. But that was also mostly rumors.

But today, seeing Originbright’s attitude, he knew that it was definitely true!

A Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor actually forced the entire divine race to back down. This kind of strength, he simply did not know what to say.

Mo Qingshan did not dare to talk back, he just kept silent.

Originbright gave a cold snort and said, “You all, bring this lord around to take a look! Wherever he wants to go, you guys will bring him there!”

“Yes!” Mo Qingshan hurriedly answered.

He did not know who this person was at all, and also did not know what he came here for.

Celestial Master Miluo said coolly, “Bring me to walk around first!”

Mo Qingshan did not dare to disobey, bringing Celestial Master Miluo to stroll around leisurely.

Wherever he wanted to go, Mo Qingshan would bring him there.

This Celestial Master Miluo gave him an unfathomable feeling.

This kind of feeling was even more terrifying than Originbright.

Miluo spent close to half a month’s time and virtually went around to every corner of the Ziwei Sect before leaving.

But before leaving, Originbright still left a Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse behind to garrison at Ziwei Sect.

Saying that it was garrisoning, it was actually surveillance.

Along the way, Originbright asked, “Celestial Master, were there any discoveries?”

Celestial Master Miluo’s brows were tightly locked, and he shook his head and said, “Discovered a few subtle auras. It should have been left behind by this boy! But this celestial master couldn’t divine where he came from! It’s as if he appeared out of thin air! But as for his departure aura, it was deliberately concealed! This boy’s means are inconceivable!”

Originbright had a look of disbelief and said, “This ... Even Celestial Master can’t divine it either? Could it be that we’re going to allow this kid to carry on being free and unfettered? Lord Celestial Master, I say, do you think Mo Qingshan knows where that boy’s whereabouts or not?”

Celestial Master Miluo was an existence with the highest attainments in the path of divination in the divine race. Even he could not find Ye Yuan’s whereabouts. Then wouldn’t this boy remain at large?

Celestial Master Miluo’s expression was somewhat ugly as he shook his head and said, “This boy is very shrewd. It’s absolutely impossible to tell Mo Qingshan his whereabouts. He and Mo Qingshan aren’t familiar to that degree! Now, there’s only waiting. He’ll inevitably give himself away!”

... ...

After Celestial Master Miluo returned in defeat, another figure quietly sneaked into the Ziwei Sect.

Mo Qingshan returned to his residence and felt as if he had arrived in a different world.

A world that was cut off from the outside world!

In the house, a middle-aged man was currently sitting in front of his desk, pouring himself a drink.

“Came back?’ The middle-aged seemed to be engaging in small talk.

“C-Came back! Wonder what this lord is finding this Mo for?” Mo Qingshan asked cautiously.

He was walking on thin ice every day currently, fearful of offending some great deity.

Ye Yuan’s matter provoked many legendary characters. He, an ant-like existence, would be gone with a puff from them.

He had no choice but to be careful!

“Sect Master Mo, you don’t need to be so cautious! That Miluo is seriously too formidable. That’s why I had no choice but to come up with this place. You might not have heard of me before. I’m called Jian Rufeng. Others all call me ... Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets! This emperor came for that young man. You should know who I’m talking about.” The middle-aged man introduced himself.

Mo Qingshan’s entire body trembled and he could not refrain from drawing a cold breath as he cried out in surprise, “That ... That white-browed old man was Celestial Master Miluo?”

He had not heard of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ name before.

But Celestial Master Miluo’s name was resounding like the roar of thunder to Mo Qingshan.

This Celestial Master Miluo monitored the world, he could be said to be the divine race’s eyes and ears.

Regarding the myriad races under the heavens, as long as there was any rustling of leaves in the wind, it could not hide from the divine race’s eyes and ears.

And the one who played a key role in this was this Celestial Master Miluo.

One could say that Celestial Master Miluo was the nightmare of all the races in the world!

The myriad races not daring to resist the divine race. There was a very important reason involved. It was Celestial Master Miluo!

If not for him, maybe the various races would have long revolted like crazy.

Mo Qingshan did not expect that this Miluo that made people tremble with fear when they hear, actually came to his Ziwei Sect just like that.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said, “Such a major incident occurred, how could it possibly not alarm him? But you rest assured. Even this emperor can’t divine that person. So it’s impossible for Miluo to divine him too.”

These words revealed a strong self-confidence.

Which was also to say that he was confident that he was stronger than Celestial Master Miluo in the path of divination!

Mo Qingshan stared dumbfoundedly with his mouth agape when he heard. When did such a major power appear in the human race?

“Sect Master Mo, you don’t need to be so surprised. This emperor has already attained Dao for hundreds of millions of years. It’s just that you’re also aware of the Heavenspan World’s situation. If I show myself, I’ll definitely die very horribly. Therefore ... I’ve always been very low-profile. This matter, I hope for Sect Master Mo to keep it secret for me too. After all, you and I are of the same race. If you report me, it’s equivalent to severing the future hope of the human race! You should be able to weigh the severity and pros and cons,” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said.

Mo Qingshan’s heart turned cold and he said solemnly, “Your Excellency, rest assured. Even if Mo Qingshan dies, I absolutely won’t say a word out too!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets nodded and said, “I trust Sect Master Mo! These few days, this emperor will be staying in Ziwei Sect. I hope that Sect Master Mo doesn’t mind.”
