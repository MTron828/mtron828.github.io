Chapter 2213: The King Returns!

“F*cking hell! I haven’t felt my blood boil with excitement like this for so long! Kill! Kill! Kill! Brothers, kill for me!”

On top of the city walls, Long Xiao’s scarred face appeared especially savage, bringing a group of brothers and charging over. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Everyone, follow Big Brother Xun! Kill this bunch of foolish humans!” Long Xun yelled.

“What are you fighting me for?! Follow Big Brother Tian and finish off all of these bastards!” Long Zhaotian was still competing with Long Xun.

Before coming, Ye Yuan gave them a batch of medicinal pills.

At present, this group of people already all broke through to the Empyrean Realm.

Coupled with the dragon race’s powerful bloodline, their combat power could not be underestimated.

The two camps were akin to two giant curtains in the sky. They were about to gather together very soon.

As for Empyrean Pilljade, these grandmasters, each and every one of them stood with their hands behind their backs, sitting it out and reaping the spoils later.

All of a sudden, a figure interjected between the two main camps.

Empyrean Pilljade’s gaze turned intent and he stopped everyone with a hand gesture, and said with a frown, “Flutterfeather, what’s the meaning of this? Could it be that your Myriad Treasure Tower is really going to wage war with the Southern Border Alliance?”

On the surface, this was a war between Empyreans.

But in reality, it was a group of Heavenly Emperors controlling behind the scenes.

The reason why it was delayed for several decades was because of Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure and the seven great reclusive ancient families.

The Heavenly Emperor faction behind the Southern Border Alliance was competing with these two forces.

In the past, due to Ye Yuan this important figure being around, these two forces naturally brimmed with confidence toward Heavenly Eagle.

But along with the passage of time, the hopes of Ye Yuan returning alive became bleaker and bleaker.

Only then did Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure and the seven great reclusive ancient families gradually reach a compromise.

Otherwise, how could Empyrean Pilljade dare to launch such a large-scale war?

Behind the war that seemed simple, it involved tremendous profits.

Flutterfeather looked towards Empyrean Pilljade and said coolly, “This Empyrean coming today is only representing myself. It has nothing to do with the Myriad Treasure Tower!”

Empyrean Pilljade’s brows furrowed slightly, showing a look of displeasure.

Isn’t this guy causing trouble?

You said that it has nothing to do with the Myriad Treasure Tower and so there is nothing then?

You, Empyrean Flutterfeather, is a high-ranking officer under Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure, an existence that is extremely likely to become an Eight-star Alchemy God in the future.

If you died here, wouldn’t Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure risk it all to fight with me?

At this time, another figure appeared beside Flutterfeather. It was Empyrean Chaoyuan!

“Add in this old man! Younger Brother Flutterfeather, I can’t let you fight alone by yourself!” Empyrean Chaoyuan looked at Flutterfeather and said with a light smile.

Empyrean Pilljade’s expression changed. Empyrean Chaoyuan was a peak Empyrean mighty expert, his strength being not worse than his.

The influence of this fellow’s appearance on the battle situation was big.

Flutterfeather laughed loudly and said, “Elder Brother Chaoyuan, good fellow!”

Empyrean Chaoyuan laughed and said, “This old man is all alone and doesn’t have any fetters. Rather, it’s you who could put aside Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure that old thing and come help out! You’re the one who’s really loyal enough!”

The two exchanged a glance and both bursted out a series of laughter.

Seeing these two people had appeared, Bai Tong and the rest were greatly roused.

Empyrean Pilljade was angered until his expression turned livid. He did not expect that this battle without any suspense would actually repeatedly have a sudden turn of events occur.

Up until now, there did not seem to be a single thing that went his way.

Empyrean Pilljade’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “Very good! This Empyrean has always admired Brother Chaoyuan’s strength very much. Today, I’ll spar with Brother Chaoyuan!”

As for Empyrean Flutterfeather, their side had a lot of powerhouses. There was naturally someone to handle him.

Empyrean Chaoyuan’s gaze turned sharp, and he said with a big laugh, “You hypocrite, only choose to hear the nice things! This is a life-and-death fight! Who’s sparring with you? Bring it on!”

After he was done talking, Empyrean Chaoyuan’s aura was released fully. The horrifying pressure made the hearts of all the martial artists jump.

If one’s strength did not reach the Empyrean Realm, they were unable to even stand firmly in the air.

This was a peak Ninth Firmament Empyrean top powerhouse.

The moment Ninth Firmament Empyreans moved out, this battle became bewildering and confusing.

Empyrean Pilljade also felt nervous. Empyrean Chaoyuan’s aura was extremely strong and actually faintly had signs of breaking through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm.

“Looks like this old punk obtained great benefits from the Cloudpill Summit last time!” Empyrean Pilljade secretly cursed hatefully.

The moment Empyrean Chaoyuan released his aura, he became somewhat apprehensive.

Once he lost, this fight would really be hard to say!

Empyrean Chaoyuan smiled coldly when he saw the situation and said, “Why? Don’t dare to come anymore, Pilljade brat?”

Pilljade’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Who’s scared of whom?!”

Done talking, the power of Ninth Firmament Empyrean was released fully. He actually barely managed to stand up to Empyrean Chaoyuan as equals.

The great battle was at an explosive point!

“Yo, so lively!”

Just as both sides ended up in a deadlock, a voice suddenly sounded out from the void.

This voice ... seemed to be a little familiar!

Empyrean Chaoyuan and Empyrean Flutterfeather exchanged a glance, both of their minds quivering.

On Heavenly Eagle’s side, Bai Tong and the rest similarly felt their minds tremble!

“It’s His Excellency! His Excellency didn’t die! His Excellency came back!” Ning Tianping said with wild elation.

At this time, the void vibrated. Three figures emerged.

There was a youth in white clothing in the middle. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

“Hahaha, it’s His Excellency! It’s really His Excellency! He didn’t die! He came back!”

“What did I say! His Excellency can’t be killed!”

“His Excellency is mighty!”

“His Excellency is mighty!”

... ...

With Ye Yuan appearing, Heavenly Eagle’s side seemed to have been ignited all at once.

Their backbone, their spiritual leader, their king finally returned!

Everyone seemed to have gone mad, shouting, cheering for the lord in their hearts!

At the opposite side, the Southern Border Alliance’s powerhouses were all extremely shocked.

They were seriously unable to imagine that the entire imperial city was cheering for Ye Yuan’s return.

What kind of magical power did this guy have?

Ye Yuan’s feet stepped on an array formation. Looking at Empyrean Pilljade, he smiled lightly and said, “Pilljade, not seeing you for a few years, you’re still such a good-for-nothing!”

Ye Yuan’s sudden appearance gave Empyrean Pilljade a fright.

However, he discovered very quickly that something seemed to be off about Ye Yuan!

He actually did not have a trace of divine essence undulation from head to toe!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s vital energy was extremely weak. Clearly, it was a body that was heavily wounded.

It seemed like the rumors about his demise were not a groundless rumor.

It was just that this kid had a tenacious life and actually did not die!

Since he was a cripple, then what did he still take to heart for?

Pilljade laughed coldly and said, “Kid, look at those subjects of yours. How much they looked forward to your return! It’s just a pity that ... what awaits them is a cripple! I really don’t know what face a cripple like you still have to come back and be their city lord!”

The moment these words came out, only then did everyone startle awake.

They were all immersed in jubilation earlier and did not notice Ye Yuan’s abnormality.

Now, only upon hearing Empyrean Pilljade’s words did they discover that Ye Yuan’s condition was extremely poor. There ... was not even a trace of divine essence undulation!

How could this be?

The Heavenly Eagle side that was still cheering joyfully earlier immediately fell into silence.

No divine essence undulation signified that the small world had completely crumbled.

Then wouldn’t His Excellency ... really have become a cripple?

The morale that had just been roused on Heavenly Eagle’s side was immediately squelched.

But Ye Yuan did not mind and said with a faint smile, “So what? With me around, Heavenly Eagle is safe and sound!”
