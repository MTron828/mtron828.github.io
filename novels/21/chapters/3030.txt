Chapter 3029: Return of the Hero!

“Master, I didn’t expect that it’s actually Little Junior Brother who saved us in the end!” Zhou Pinespring said with a bitter smile.

“Haha,?when have I, your master, made a mistake when judging people? Rather, it’s some people who kept saying Ye Yuan got controlled by the enemy. In the end? This slap is resounding! Back then, if not for Your Father’s persistence, this bunch of grandsons would all have to die today! Don’t you agree, Old Fogey Blacksun?” Cloudmount was pleased with himself as he said.

Blacksun was speechless.

“In my view, this bunch of grandsons was jealous that I took in a fine disciple! Luckily, Your Father had no qualms in falling out back then to protect Ye Yuan. Now, it’s equivalent to protecting Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! In the end, the greatest meritorious official is Your Father!?Hahaha?…”

Blacksun could not retort those words.

These few days, he had already been beaten down by Cloudmount in waves.

Those who got beaten down together with him were also those Hegemon Realms who were carried back.

There was no way to live otherwise!

Even so, these people themselves also could not help but sigh. The one who saved Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, in the end, was not Divine Lord, not Zhuo Bufan, but it was Ye Yuan, this measly little Emperor Vast Heaven!

Right at the start, they were knocked down by Cloudmount limitlessly.

After posturing for half a day without anyone acknowledging, Cloudmount also felt rather bored and could not help but ask, “Old Fogey Blacksun, do you think whether or not Ye Yuan they all can succeed?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s hearts became fidgety again.

After being silent for a long time, Blacksun said, “Back then, we’ve fought with the Chaos Bloodstone before. What do you think?”

Cloudmount said somewhat irritatedly, “Your Father is asking you!”

Blacksun shook his head and said, “Most likely … difficult! How strong a Great Beyond powerhouse is, you and I both know!”

Cloudmount’s face was somewhat black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Aren’t you implying that my youngest disciple went to court death?”

Blacksun gave him a look and said, “Whether or not it’s courting death, aren’t you clear in your heart? But you still let him go, no?”

Cloudmount shot him a fierce glare. He knew the answer a long time ago. It was just that he was not willing to go and think. That was all.

Ye Yuan said that he had some means, but no matter what means he had, he was also just Emperor Vast Heaven!

He could rampage in all directions because he brought back these Supreme Hegemons and not his own strength.

Could a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven deal with a Great Beyond powerhouse?

Cloudmount did not believe it. Blacksun they all did not believe it either.

The current Cloudmount had a head full of gray hair, his two eyes deeply sunken, and his severed limb was unable to regrow too. It was not much different from a mortal old man.

Hegemon Cloudmount, who had once commanded the heavens, no longer had the image of spirit of a Hegemon Realm.

The samsara that he had already transcended seemed to have been back on his body again.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a figure appeared. It was Li Clearcloud.

“Master, there’s news from over there!” Li Clearcloud’s face was full of abjectness.

Cloudmount had a foreboding premonition, his heart thumping, nearly fainting away.

Blacksun and the rest also sighed in their hearts.

Thinking to themselves, it was indeed like this!

“How is your little junior brother?” Cloudmount asked tremblingly.

“Little Junior Brother he …” Li Clearcloud could not quite continue when he spoke up to here.

Cloudmount’s gaze turned dark, and he shouted coldly, “How on earth is he doing?”

Suddenly, Li Clearcloud’s expression changed greatly, revealing a wildly elated expression as he said agitatedly, “Little Junior Brother crushed the blood race, inflicting heavy wounds onto the Chaos Bloodstone. Wang Zuo and Bloodsky have virtually died. The blood race’s Hegemons are almost completely wiped out! Heaven One is greatly victorious!?Hahaha?…”

Everyone present did not wrap their minds around it.

This sudden turn of events was seriously too sudden.

“W-What did you say?” Cloudmount could not resist asking again.

“I said, Heaven One is victorious! Unprecedentedly victorious! The blood race has fled. We’ve restored glory to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! Master, we won!” Li Clearcloud said agitatedly.

“Scoundrel! Pingspring, kill this guy for me! If he dares to fight back, Your Father will expel him!” Suddenly, Cloudmount exploded in anger.

“Alright!” Zhou Pinespring rubbed his fights and wiped his palms, and pummeled brutally.

15 minutes later, Li Clearcloud’s face swelled up like a pig’s head.

Uh,?he also had a deep-seated hatred toward Eldest Senior Brother’s behavior.

Cloudmount looked at him and said with a sneer, “You think that because Master’s life force is depleted, you can deceive and betray your master? If Master’s strength is still present, I’ll definitely make you lie down for ten thousand years!”

He was really furious!

This scoundrelly brat actually dared to trick him!

Just now, he almost fainted!

Li Clearcloud said crossly, “Right, I’m taking revenge on you! Who asked you to send me alone out at that time??Humph!?Is it only you, Hegemon Cloudmount, who’s very noble?”

Cloudmount choked when he heard that. It turned out that he was waiting for this moment.

In the previous battle, Cloudmount foolhardily sent the dying Li Clearcloud out at the risk of heavy injuries.

In the end, this guy held a grudge until now.

“Bastard! This seat saved you. Did I save wrongly?”

“Yes!”

“You *sshole!”

… …

The group of Hegemons was speechless, but they felt touched in their hearts.

Cloudmount’s current one sect three Hegemons fell over each other in their eagerness to die. This really made people admire their actions!

Counting the other two great Hegemons from the Extreme Medicine Sect who died, the Extreme Medicine Sect with their five Hegemons were almost completely wiped out!

This Hegemon level sect really fought until the last man!

Actually, a long time ago, after the blood race crisis erupted, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven did not have just those 60 Hegemons. There were many Hegemons who clung to life and feared death, directly fleeing.

Those who remained were all heroes!

But, among the Extreme Medicine Sect one sect five Hegemons, none of them ran away!

However, this news was really too unexpected!

“Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is restored to glory?”

“F*ck me! That’s a Great Beyond powerhouse. How on earth did Ye Yuan that little bastard do it?”

“A noble exploit without equal! This is a noble exploit without equal! Old Fogey Cloudmount, you’re remarkable! You took in a remarkable disciple!”

… …

The group of ‘disabled’ Hegemons was incomparably excited.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven virtually collapsed at their hands.

But Ye Yuan’s return overcame the raging tides, and he actually virtually annihilated the blood race!

Even the Great Beyond powerhouse, the Chaos Bloodstone, actually succumbed at his hands too!

He achieved a noble exploit without equal that even dozens of Hegemons could not accomplish!

At this time, there was only admiration left in their hearts.

… …

Several days later, Ye Yuan and a group of Hegemons returned, all of them carrying injuries. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Even the incredibly powerful Long Jian sustained severe injuries too!

In the final battle, Long Jian and Zhuo Bufan joined hands to deal with the Chaos Bloodstone, unleashing his ultimate innate divine ability, causing mutual destruction with the Chaos Bloodstone!

Chaos Bloodstone was seriously injured once more!

It was also precisely because of this that the Chaos Bloodstone came into being, bringing the remnant defeated forces and running away.

In this battle, Long Jian made great contributions!

Luan Qinghe, Imperishable, and the others, also sustained varying degrees of injuries.

The most miserable was Ye Yuan. That attack from Wang Zuo was completely unexpected.

Although Ye Yuan avoided a calamity by a fluke, he was actually seriously injured.

Right now, he was carried back by Zhao Yue.

But, no matter what, this war was fought extremely beautifully.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had a great reversal during its moment of desperation, recovering its full glory!

Without a Hegemon Realm to hold down the fort, the remaining blood kins were already of no concern.
