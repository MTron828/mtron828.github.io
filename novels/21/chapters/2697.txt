Chapter 2703: Two Tigers Cannot Share One Mountain!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The five great half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens returned to their territories and immediately dispatched troops to search for the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill’s heavenly medicines.

Because the heavenly medicines on the list that Ye Yuan gave them were indeed extremely rare.

Even in this Myriad Demons Mountain, they were rare too.

Furthermore, the collection of many of the heavenly medicines even needed them to attend to personally.

Although their territories were large, it was a drop in the ocean compared to the entire Myriad Demons Mountain.

Some heavenly medicines needed to go to the territories of other kings. They had to take action personally.

In fact, some half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven great battles would surely ignite in order to snatch heavenly medicines.

However, Ye Yuan did not pay attention to these.

His top priority was to cultivate.

Actually, 30 years’ time in itself was extremely pressuring to Ye Yuan.

Saying it so calmly previously was merely just a stop-gap measure.

Because in these 30 years, not only did Ye Yuan have to break through to Jade Sovereign Heaven in cultivation, he even had to reach grade four heavenly alchemist in alchemy!

30 years’ time was too short.

Although Ye Yuan’s foundation was solid, he needed to systematically research and cultivate grade three heavenly pills too.

With his current strength, he still could not refine grade three heavenly pills of true grade.

So his first request after coming to Myriad Demons Mountain was to have the five kings supply him with grade three heavenly medicines without restrictions.

Under Shuoyan’s forceful request, Ye Yuan went to Bright Tiger King’s territory.

Shuoyan led Ye Yuan to walk around and said proudly, “Among the five kings, my royal father is the strongest. So his territory is also the largest! Big Brother Ye Yuan, what do you think? It’s pretty good, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Indeed pretty good! Along the way, the spiritual energy here is the most abundant and the vegetation is also the richest. I’ve already seen many precious heavenly medicines after walking one round.”

Myriad Demons Mountain was a massive treasure vault, there were countless precious heavenly medicines on it.

Some heavenly medicines were even long extinct in the Five Great Heavenly Regions already but survived here.

Ye Yuan saw many precious grade one and two heavenly medicines along the way, there were even some grade three heavenly medicines.

Shuoyan said smugly, “That’s of course! But Big Brother Ye Yuan, you’re really capable. The effects of the heavenly pill that you refined are too strong! If I didn’t deliberately suppress it, I feel like I can even break through to middle Limitless Sublime immediately!”

One heavenly pill made Shuoyan regard Ye Yuan as a celestial.

He was currently long already prostrating on all fours in admiration toward Ye Yuan.

At the same time, Ye Yuan also had a rather good perception of this little brother.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I can tell that your cultivation is very solid! Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been able to break through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum.”

The effect of heavenly pills varied from person to person too.

If it was someone with a shallow foundation, even if they ate a true grade heavenly pill, the effects would be greatly discounted too.

Not everyone could break through from upper Greater Sublime Heaven to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum after eating a true grade heavenly pill.

Ye Yuan also precisely saw through that Shuoyan’s foundation as solid. This was why he would let him take it.

Otherwise, how could it suppress the five kings?”

“Yo,?my good brother, you’re back from the expedition with Royal Father??Mn??You broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum?” Two figures suddenly came out of the dense woods. When one of the young men saw Shuoyan, he could not help getting a shock.

When Shuoyan saw the arrivals, he was a little embarrassed and said with a nod, “Yeah, Third Brother Hefeng! When I went on the expedition with Royal Father this time, I met Big Brother Ye Yuan. His means are exceedingly formidable and used one heavenly pill to increase my realm to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!”

When the person behind Hefeng hear it, his face was greatly surprised too.

A heavenly pill increased a major cultivation realm, this was too terrifying!

But when Ye Yuan heard it, he was speechless.

When Hefeng appeared, he was dripping with sarcasm when he was talking. It did not look like close brothers greeting each other.

But Shuoyan was clearly simple-minded and did not know to hide things, directly selling him out.

Hefeng’s gaze when looking towards him already became unkind.

“You’re talking about this human?” Hefeng pointed at Ye Yuan and said.

Shuoyan nodded and said, “Yeah! He’s Royal Father’s distinguished guest. He’s great! Get to know each other, Third Brother!”

But Hefeng’s expression suddenly turned dark, and he said with a cold snort, “What bullshit distinguished guest! How can a human be on our Bright Tiger territory? Go and die for me!”

Hefeng gave a roar and directly smashed a fist towards Ye Yuan, the speed swift to the extreme.

Shuoyan was frozen there, at a loss on what to do.

He did not know why the Third Brother Hefeng who was normally very good-tempered suddenly became so irritable.

This punch of Hefeng’s did not hold back at all. It was going to send him to his doom.

But midway, he suddenly gave a muffled groan and instantly collapsed on the ground.

The expression of the powerhouse who appeared together with Hefeng changed, and he cried out in surprise, “Origin divinity attack! Courting death!”

Only to see his figure move, the aura of Jade Sovereign Heaven suddenly bursting out.

Only then did Shuoyan react and say in great alarm, “Muzhen, you really dare to attack Big Brother Ye Yuan? He’s Royal Father’s distinguished guest!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As he said, he was actually planning on blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

Muzhen smiled coldly and said, “Human, you shouldn’t have appeared in Bright Tiger Territory! Hefeng wants to kill him, so this commander naturally has to make a move! Move aside!”

Finished saying, he flicked his sleeves, and Shuoyan was actually sent flying out involuntarily.

Ye Yuan looked at Muzhen, his gaze turning cold.

This Myriad Demons Mountain was indeed famed for being where the weak were prey to the strong!

Killing people did not need a reason at all in this place.

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, directly taking out the Dragon Spring Sword.

The sound of a dragon roar rose to the sky, flying straight for Muzhen.

Muzhen was just about to kill Ye Yuan. So how could he be on guard against such an astonishing strike?

Caught by surprise, only to see his blood spurt wildly, directly being slammed flying. He was already heavily injured.

He looked at Ye Yuan with an astonished face and said in disbelief, “G-Grandmist treasure?”

While at this time, Hefeng also recovered a little from the dizziness. Hearing this name, his entire body could not help trembling.

Ye Yuan looked at the two and said coolly, “Shuoyan will be shielded by me in the future. If you guys dare to bully him, be careful that I make you the first target of attack! Scram!”

The two people’s expressions changed, being aware that they were not Ye Yuan’s match. They helped each other leave.

Ye Yuan did not deal a killing blow to Hefeng either.

His bloodline was powerful and was of the same lineage as Bright Tiger King. He was clearly a biological brother of Shuoyan.

After the two people left, Shuoyan had a look of puzzlement as he said, “Why did Third Brother Hefeng seem like he became a different person today?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and could not help laughing as he said, “Have you heard before the saying that two tigers cannot share one mountain?”

“Two tigers cannot share one mountain?” Shuoyan had a blank look.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “In the past, you were just an obedient child with meager strength. Hence, no one will care about you. But now, you broke through to lower Limitless Sublime Heaven in one go. Hence, he felt threatened! Understood?”

Shuoyan nodded his head like he did not fully understand. Ye Yuan was also speechless when he saw the situation.

This boy was even more innocent than Jingfei that lass.

Ye Yuan rubbed his tiger head and said smilingly, “In short, you guys won’t be able to be brothers properly in the future anymore! Since you’ve already grown up, there will likely only be killing left between you all! Alright, let’s call it a day. I’ll go into closed-seclusion for a few days first.. You come over to my place after a while, and then I’ll help you consolidate your foundation and nurture your essence. I’ll let you break through to middle Limitless Sublime Heaven as soon as possible!”
