Chapter 967: Initiative Changing Hands!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Only then did Ye Yuan know that the Zhou and Yue two families’ forefathers who obtained the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil before had probably long realized that the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil had problems.

Therefore, before they passed on, they set up this Vastsun Bright Moon Realm, using it to seal the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil.

It was just that they also did not expect the arrival of an age of declining laws, making everything changed.

Without Deity Realm powerhouses, no one was able to harness the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil anymore. In the course of time, it birthed a primordial spirit on its own and cultivated to an exceedingly high realm.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil’s terrifying ocular arts, even divine king powerhouses did not have the strength to resist!

Ye Yuan’s face was grim as he asked, “For 100 thousand years, who knows how many experts had come here. Why did you choose me?”

Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil smiled lightly and said, “Heh, although their cultivation realms were higher than yours, their heart realm was far inferior compared to you! Without an exceptional high heart realm, there’s simply no way of withstanding my powerful ocular powers! Wait until I wipe away your consciousness, adding on my ocular arts, the Divine Realm will be our world in the future!”

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil had cultivated for God knows how many tens of thousands of years here. His strength was unfathomable.

Even if he did not reach the Deity Realm, his ocular arts had probably already achieved perfection.

What he lacked was just a set of fleshly body suitable for him.

Accurately speaking, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil seeking out a host was different from the ordinary seizing of possession. He only wanted to wipe away the martial artist’s original consciousness, while the other abilities could be preserved perfectly.

Cultivation realm could be cultivated if lacking, but the cultivation of heart realm was far too difficult. Hence, that was why he did not make a move all along, all the way until Ye Yuan’s appearance.

“If I say no?” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil did not reveal a surprised look. He just said with a faint smile, “You will agree! Because apart from me, nobody can undo her illusionary magic!”

His gaze looked over towards Yue Mengli, his face revealing a smug smile.

Ye Yuan fell silent, a look of struggle appeared on his face.

“You don’t have much time. You really greatly surprised me by being able to break through to Heaven Man Unity within two days. However, that little girl is only left with at most four hours. Once the time is up, even I will be powerless to do anything too,” Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil said with a smile that was not a smile.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he said in a low voice, “Unless you swear a Heavenly Dao Oath, otherwise, why should I believe you?”

Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil said with a faint smile, “I won’t swear a Heavenly Dao Oath. As for whether you believe or not, that’s your problem, nothing to do with me. But I think that it seems you can only choose to believe me.”

Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil seemed to savor this feeling of kneading other people very much, an expression of walking on air surfaced on his face. He just quietly awaited Ye Yuan’s choice and did not urge.

Finally, Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and looked at the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil as he said, “Hope that you keep your word. Come on!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan utterly opened up his mind, seemingly already resigned himself to fate.

Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil smiled and said, “Haha, he who understands the times is a wise man. Don’t worry, I’ll help her release the illusionary magic.”

He naturally would not tell Ye Yuan that once these people thoroughly immersed in the illusionary realm, they would become his slave, being manipulated at his will.

Releasing Yue Mengli? That was impossible!

On this Yellow Millet Mountain, just the divine king powerhouses were numerous. Once such a force got out, it would probably become the ninth super holy land immediately!

Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil gave a light chuckle and transformed into a stream of flowing light, and entered inside Ye Yuan’s body all at once.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, instantly feeling that his two eyes swelled incomparably, seemingly on the verge of exploding.

“Heh, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil is matchlessly tyrannical, it’s not that easy to endure! Now, allow me to lead this body ... Argh ... Damn it, Soul Suppressing Pearl! How could you have the Soul Suppressing Pearl this sort of thing!” Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil suddenly cried out miserably.

Just as he was going to wipe away Ye Yuan’s consciousness, a stream of gloomy light probed out from inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil sensed a terrifying power. This power was plenty to utterly obliterate him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s divine soul suddenly blocked in front of him. That ghostly light seemed to have intelligence, and actually directly withdrew back into the Soul Suppressing Pearl.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil was still suffering from the shock, his face seized with fear and trepidation. His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was filled with a frightened look.

He had long predicted that Ye Yuan definitely would not give in so obediently. It was just that he never thought that Ye Yuan’s trump card was actually the Soul Suppressing Pearl!

His primordial spirit body was similarly divine soul in nature. For the Soul Suppressing Pearl to want to exterminate him just now was merely an effortless matter.

“I didn’t think that you’re familiar with the Soul Suppressing Pearl too. Then it’s easy to handle. Now, we can have a proper chat, right?” Ye Yuan looked at the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil with a smile that was not a smile and said.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil’s expression changed, and he said, “You ... How can you possibly have the Soul Suppressing Pearl, this kind of thing?!”

Ye Yuan said nonchalantly, “Just casually picked it up. That’s not the main point. The main thing is, when are you planning on undoing Li-er’s illusionary magic?”

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil’s expression changed, and he said, “You let me go first, then we talk again! Otherwise, I won’t undo the Secret Illusion Heavenly Realm!”

Not that the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil did not wish to go out, but that he entered Ye Yuan’s body and already reconstructed Ye Yuan’s two eyes, and produced a bond with Ye Yuan’s body.

If he succeeded in taking possession, everything naturally could be discussed.

But now, as long as Ye Yuan did not take the initiative to release this bond, his primordial spirit would be bounded up inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, unable to break free!

The current Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil had reached the point of being caught between the devil and the deep sea.

With the Soul Suppressing Pearl around, his taking of possession was something totally impossible. But wanting to escape Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness needed Ye Yuan’s approval.

With this, the initiative completely landed in Ye Yuan’s hands.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil’s sole chip right now was Yue Mengli.

“Heh, do you really take me to be a fool? I’m giving you one last chance, if you don’t agree, I’ll make the Soul Suppressing Pearl wipe away your consciousness and let you return to origin! It is a little troublesome, but at that time, your 100 thousand over years of cultivation will be ruined overnight!” Ye Yuan sputtered nonsense.

He was unable to mobilize the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil at all. He was just swindling the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil, that was all.

But Ye Yuan guessed that the Soul Suppressing Pearl had extremely powerful abilities regarding divine souls. Presumably, wiping away consciousness this sort of thing was not a difficult thing to it.

Indeed, the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil’s expression changed and he said solemnly, “If that’s the case, that little girlie is dead for sure too!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said indifferently, “There’s still four hour’s time. I think it’s sufficient for me to inherit the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil.”

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil gnashed his teeth in hatred, but he could not do anything to Ye Yuan at all.

Right now, the initiative was completely in Ye Yuan’s hands.

Right at this time, Han Tong’s eyes suddenly snapped open, and he plopped down on the ground, his entire person perspiring profusely as if he had a great illness.

Huff huff ...

Han Tong gasped for air heavily but suddenly jolted, being struck dumb with amazement by the scene in the surroundings.

Looking towards Ye Yuan again, he actually discovered that Ye Yuan’s two eyes were bleeding, and his expression involuntarily changed drastically!

“This boy obtained the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil? This ... How is this possible?” Han Tong said in disbelief.
