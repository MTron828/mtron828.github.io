Chapter 2178: You’re Making Me Look At This?

“Mn? You’re saying that Ye Yuan came?”

When Lin Changqing heard this name, he immediately jumped up. A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

Back then, he was also triggered by Ye Yuan. So he worked very hard and cultivated bitterly.

In over a short thousand years, he already broke through to become a Second Firmament Empyrean!

This speed was already quick to the extreme among those in the Empyrean Realm.

Zheng Yufeng nodded and said, “That’s right! He’s currently at Sunset Peak!”

Lin Changqing laughed loudly and said, “This kid should be here to kneel on the ground and beg for mercy, right? However ... he dared to covet Junior Apprentice Sister Meng Li. I must have him die!”

Zheng Yufeng’s expression became peculiar, and he said in a solemn voice, “Looking at his appearance, he doesn’t look like he’s here to beg for mercy!”

Lin Changqing waved his hand and said very surely, “He must be here to beg for mercy! The 2000 years agreement isn’t up yet. So why would he come to Fallen Maple Bodhidharma? Back then, when I saw him, he hadn’t even reached the True God Realm. It can’t be that he cultivated to Empyrean in a thousand year’s time, right?”

With this, Zheng Yufeng also became somewhat uncertain.

Ye Yuan was just like a mortal in front of him. He could not see through his depths at all.

While talking, Ye Yuan gave him an unfathomable feeling.

In the beginning, he still thought that Ye Yuan was an Empyrean powerhouse.

But hearing Lin Changqing, it was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to be an Empyrean.

In this world, which monster could cultivate from the Celestial Deity Realm to the Empyrean Realm in a short thousand years’ time?

Perhaps Ye Yuan was relying on his identity and oppressing people by force.

Zheng Yufeng still wanted to say something when Lin Changqing already left with a loud laugh.

“Senior Apprentice Brother, still in a daze here for what? Follow me to go teach this punk a good lesson!”

He already could not wait and wanted to devastate Ye Yuan.

This kid embarrassed him badly back then!

Now that he delivered himself to the doorstep, if he did not humiliate him well, how could he dispel the hatred in his heart?

... ...

Sunset Peak was the first peak of Fallen Maple Bodhidharma, and it was also where the entrance to the mountain was.

Ye Yuan stood on the plaza, carefully feeling the thick to the extreme spiritual energy all around, and he could not help feeling vicissitudes of emotion.

This Fallen Maple Bodhidharma should be on an offset of the Heavenspan Mountain.

Cultivating in this kind of place would simply yield twice the results with half the effort!

Just as he was ruminating, Ye Yuan’s gaze suddenly flickered, looking at the arrival with a smile that was not a smile.

“Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, you want to beg for mercy from this empyrean? This empyrean tells you, it’s impossible!” Lin Changqing took a step out of the void and used a sympathetic gaze to look at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was also sizing up Lin Changqing.

Recalling back then, when Lin Changqing descended upon Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, how haughty and all-powerful was that?

If not for Treasure Pig flying off the handle and sending him flying with a sneeze, perhaps Ye Yuan would have long been killed by Lin Changqing.

Even if the Ye Yuan back then had millions of methods, he could only look and do nothing. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

But a thousand years passed. Lin Changqing broke through his cultivation realm and became a Second Firmament Empyrean. Even so, now he could no longer muster up Ye Yuan’s interest.

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, he could smack a Second Firmament Empyrean to death with one slap.

No matter how strong this Second Firmament Empyrean was!

Looking at Lin Changqing again, Ye Yuan’s eyes already carried a trace of pity.

“Lin Changqing, not seeing you for a thousand years, you disappoint me too much,” Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh.

Lin Changqing laughed coldly and said, “What? Want to preserve the last of your dignity? It’s no use! During these 1000 years, this empyrean’s strength has already grown to an extent that you can’t imagine! Experience it well!”

Finished talking, the aura on Lin Changqing’s body erupted out without the slightest reservation.

On Sunset Peak, the berserk aura swept out, making people give sidelong glances.

“Martial Uncle Changqing has actually already broken through, becoming a Second Firmament Empyrean! His cultivation speed is also too fast, right?”

“These ... These are three types of laws, Martial Uncle Changqing actually fused three kinds of law powers!”

“Who is that kid? To actually dare provoke Martial Uncle Changqing, is he tired of living?”

... ...

Lin Changqing’s seniority in Fallen Maple Bodhidharma was extremely high. His talent was also extremely great.

He had not shown himself for a long time. Now that he displayed his strength, it directly renewed the understanding of his fellow apprentices, and it naturally aroused a wave of exclamations.

At this time, Zheng Yufeng also just happened to rush over. Seeing Lin Changqing reveal his strength, his pupils could not help constricting.

“Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing he ... is also too monstrous!”

In terms of talent, Lin Changqing was first-rate among them fellow apprentice brothers.

His cultivation time was the shortest, but it was already almost catching up to them, these senior apprentice brothers.

In this 1000 years, Lin Changqing dwelt in the deep seclusion of his own home and virtually rarely showed face.

Before closed-seclusion, he still only fused two kinds of law powers.

Zheng Yufeng did not expect that now, he actually fused three kinds of law powers!

Fusing two kinds of law powers and fusing three kinds, those were totally different concepts.

If they all, these people, were geniuses, then Lin Changqing was the genius among geniuses!

He already won these senior apprentice brothers!

Feeling the strength that Lin Changqing exhibited, Ye Yuan was also slightly surprised.

Just looking at this scene before his eyes, Lin Changqing’s talent was even stronger than the Northernmost Steppe’s Feng Tianyang!

Well-deserving of being a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda! The disciples were indeed outstandingly talented.

It was just that ... Ye Yuan’s realm was significantly lower than Feng Tianyang’s back then and he already annihilated him.

Now that his realm was on par with Lin Changqing’s, how could Ye Yuan take him seriously?

Moreover, Ye Yuan’s current trump cards were far more compared to that time!

“Hahaha, saw that? Only a genius like this empyrean can match up to Junior Apprentice Sister Meng Li! An ant like you also have delusions of grandeur, wanting to contend with a proud eagle too? Now, beg me! Maybe ... I’ll be so benevolent that I’ll let you off!” Lin Changqing said with a loud laugh.

What he and Ye Yuan signed was a divine soul contract and not a Heavenly Dao Oath.

If both parties were willing, they could get rid of the agreement.

Of course, it must be both parties agreeing. If one party was not willing, this agreement would continue taking effect.

Zheng Yufeng looked at Ye Yuan and could not help smiling coldly.

So what if Second Sage?

So what if the Dragon Clan’s Heaven’s Chosen Son?

Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing was also a peerless genius that was hard to come across in a million years!

Even if Ye Yuan could surpass Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing in the future, he did not have that time either!

Over 2000 years’ time, it was simply insufficient to let Ye Yuan catch up to Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing.

Ye Yuan was improving, but Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing was similarly improving!

When Ye Yuan heard that, he could not help but laugh in spite of himself and said, “Lin Changqing, really don’t know where your sense of superiority comes from. You once bragged and boasted to be a genius in front of me, but now, a thousand years have passed, you’re just letting me look at this? What’s even more laughable is that you’re actually still patting yourself on the back!”

Lin Changqing’s face fell slightly and he said in a cold voice, “Brat, you really don’t want face when it’s given! Posturing isn’t done like this! You know that by getting a treasure that blocks your strength and using tricks to mislead people, you can be impudent in front of this empyrean? If not for that the 2000 years agreement hasn’t arrived yet, this empyrean would slap you to death with one palm right now!”

“Treasure that blocks strength? Using tricks to mislead people??”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth revealed a hint of amusement, and he said with a light smile, “Then open your eyes and take a look at whether or not I’m using tricks to mislead people then!”
