Chapter 990: Tomb Guardian Lineage

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Heavenly Fiend Tiger Clan’s ancestral temple’s sacrificial altar was specifically used to offer sacrifices to the ancestors.

Of course, there was still another function here. It was used to communicate with the tomb guardians of the land of ancestral spirits.

Currently, Head Elder already took a bath and put in clean clothes, and arranged an incense burner table and sacrificial items for use nicely.

Several divine king powerhouses all stood respectfully by the side, with a look of solemnness and respect.

Done with the preparation works, Head Elder Pan Yin respectfully took out three sticks of incense, lit them seriously in earnest, and after three bows, inserted them into the incense burner table.

“There were two outsiders who intruded into the land of ancestral spirits today and interrupted the ancestral spirits’ peaceful rest. Unfilial child, Pan Yin, is gripped with fear and requests the spirits of the ancestors to make an exception, and let this one enter the land of ancestral spirits to capture the outsiders!”

Head Elder enunciated each word, saying it extremely devotedly.

After his voice faded, the array formation on the sacrificial altar suddenly lit up brightly. Coils of incense smoke above the incense burner were seemingly devoured by something, vanishing from sight.

Pan Yin’s face revealed a look of anticipation. This sort of thing, presumably the tomb guardian should not disagree, right?

After 15 minutes, above the sacrificial alter finally had a reaction. Head Elder had a look of anticipation, staring fixedly at the incense ashes burned out by the three joss sticks.

Incense ash drifted, gradually condensing to form a word shape.

All of the divine kings stared at that place without blinking. But very soon, the expressions on their faces became very ugly.

While Head Elder’s expression was even grim until it was almost dripping water.

It was clearly not Head Elder’s first time communicating with the tomb guardian already. But the words that appeared this time made him perplexed, and also aggrieved.

The incense ashes condensed to form a large word: Scram!

“Why is it like this? In the past, when communicating with the tomb guardian, it’s either allow or not allowed. This ‘scram’ word, what does it mean?” A divine king said in puzzlement.

“Is there still a need to say? Of course, it’s ‘not allow’! But the problem is, why would the tomb guardian want to use this word?” Another divine king said.

This word was seriously too impolite.

“Most likely, the tomb guardian is truly enraged. Otherwise, he wouldn’t use this word to reply! Could it be, us not guarding the land of ancestral spirits well, made them infuriated?”

Head Elder’s expression was incomparably ugly. He lived to a ripe old age and had yet to encounter this sort of situation before. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Remove the incense burner table then. Looks like we can only lie in wait! There’s a possibility that the tomb guardian has already personally taken action!” Head Elder finally still let out a long sigh and said.

His strength was extremely formidable. But facing the tomb guardian’s wrath, he still harbored fear.

Inside the land of ancestral spirits, the tomb guardian was the most powerful existence! Even if he was a first-rate divine king, he could not go against the other party’s wishes too.

...

At the same time, inside the White Tiger territory, Rong Kun also received the news that was sent over here.

“What did you say? They entered the Heavenly Fiend Tiger Clan’s land of ancestral spirits? That place is highly dangerous!” Hearing this news, Rong Kun turned pale with fright too.

“Yes, Head Elder! From the news that was sent over, Ling Ninehills was indeed captured by Ye Yuan already. But in the end, it still startled the Heavenly Fiend Tiger Clan’s Head Elder, Pan Yin! Finally, Ye Yuan was still intercepted. But in the end, Ye Yuan still escaped into the land of ancestral spirits!” A divine king powerhouse said.

Rong Kun finally still let out a sigh and said, “To be able to escape from Pan Yin’s hands is already a miracle! The land of ancestral spirits was indeed their only way out. But their chances of survival aren’t high! Probably at this moment, Pan Yin has already thoroughly sealed off the land of ancestral spirits. Even if they can come out from within the land of ancestral spirits, they would be hard-pressed to escape even if they grew wings too!”

The divine king below was also very alarmed. When he heard this news, he was stunned for a long time as well.

Forget about Ye Yuan, it was impossible for him to escape from Pan Yin’s hands too.

But, Ye Yuan did it! He escaped from under Pan Yin’s nose and barged into the land of ancestral spirits!

One had to admit that this could be rated as a miracle already.

“Head Elder, what should we do now?” That divine king powerhouse asked.

Rong Kun mused for a moment and instructed him, “Gather the clan’s powerhouses and hasten to the borders! Apply pressure on the Heavenly Fiend Tiger Clan! At this time, what we can do is also just this. Hope that White Light is blessed and has a tenacious life, and is able to come out from inside the Heavenly Fiend Tiger Clan’s land of ancestral spirits.”

That divine king’s expression became austere as he responded, “Yes!”

...

Yue Mengli had just come out from closed-seclusion when Bai Po came knocking.

Seeing Bai Po’s expression, Yue Mengli knew that Ye Yuan there probably encountered some accident.

“Elder Bai, how is ... Big Brother Yuan?” Yue Mengli opened her mouth to ask first.

Bai Po hesitated for a moment, but still recounted the information he got from Head Elder there.

Just earlier, Head Elder Rong Kun specially summoned him over, making him come over to tell Yue Mengli this news. It was also considered taking the matter seriously.

But Yue Mengli smiled after hearing it and said, “I see. Since Elder Bai came, why not come in a drink a cup of tea?”

Bai Po was stupefied by Yue Mengli’s attitude and could not help saying in surprise, “Isn’t Miss Yue worried about Young Master Ye at all?”

Yue Mengli said with a faint smile, “Of course I’m a little worried. However ... Big Brother Yuan will definitely return safely.”

Bai Po could not help being stunned when he heard. He had mentioned the dangers of the land of ancestral spirits earlier, but Yue Mengli was still so confident.

Where in the world did her confidence stem from?

...

Before long, the tomb guardian appeared in front of Ye Yuan and White Light once again.

“All come on out!”

The tomb guardian’s nonchalant voice reverberated inside the great hall. Very soon, one silhouette after another flickered. Several dozen people actually appeared in the great hall all of a sudden!

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan and White Light were both very puzzled.

“This ... who are they?” White Light asked curiously

The tomb guardian said with a smile, “They are tomb guardians too.”

“This ... So many tomb guardians?” White Light could not help being dazed when he heard that.

“When have I said that the tomb guardian was just me alone?” The tomb guardian said mockingly.

White Light: “...”

“I’m called Fan Lin, the leader of the White Tiger Clan’s tomb guardians. Our tomb guardian lineage is handed from generation to generation, but our mission will never change, that is to guard the ancestral spirits, and defend the White Tiger Clan. If the White Tiger Clan is in danger of clan extermination, we’re also the last barrier!” Fan Lin said.

White Light was alarmed inwardly as he listened. His face turned solemn, and he said to Fan Lin, “Guarding the White Tiger Clan, Lord Fan Lin and everyone have toiled and performed unparalleled merits! Please accept a bow from White Light!”

Fan Lin nodded slightly and said, “Our tomb guardian lineage can receive this bow of yours! Perhaps in the future, our White Tiger Clan will have to serve you as our master. This bow today, I’ll accept it on behalf of the ancestors first! Alright, into formation!”

Under Fan Lin’s order, each and every one of those tomb guardians swiftly moved positions. Their movements were extremely nimble. Clearly, they had already rehearsed this set of array formation to the limits.

Ye Yuan watched by the side and was also endlessly shocked inwardly.

These tomb guardians, each and every one of them had unfathomable strength! He seriously did not expect that the White Tiger Clan actually still had such a terrifying force!

All of a sudden, the array formation formed. The originally dim great hall suddenly radiated with a brilliant splendor!

“Roar!”

A pressure that was sufficient to decimate the heavens and destroy the earth spread out inside the great hall!
