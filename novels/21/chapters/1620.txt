Chapter 1624 Variant Deboning Great Ra

heavenstar and di en exchanged a glance, their eyes revealing a hint of cunningness.

these human powerhouses were indeed a pile of loose sand!

heavenstar said, “huhu, this suggestion is not bad! but, in order to express your sincerity, you all have to take this punk down first.”

the moment these words came out, everyone’s faces revealed hesitation looks.

they had also seen through things. ye yuan had significant enmity with these fiend race powerhouses.

if handing over could gloss things over and stay on good terms, everyone going for the treasure together, that would be for the best.

zheng qi immediately blocked in front of ye yuan. unsheathing a long sword, he said in a cold voice, “whoever dares to touch ye yuan, step over from this old man’s corpse! gao yuan, even if this old man dies together, i’ll also drag you into the water!”

gao yuan laughed coldly and said, “then you get buried together with him then! everyone saw it too. the fiends are overwhelming in numbers and can’t be overcome with force. everyone, take ye yuan down first!”

zheng qi looked towards ling zikun and said in a cold voice, “ling zikun, what’s the meaning of this? we kindly came to assist you, but you’re going to carry out the hospitality of a host like this?”

ling zikun let out a sigh and said, “brother zheng qi, this kid has already become the target of public censure, why must you be buried together with him? as long as we hand him over, everybody can get along peacefully.”

ling zikun’s impression of ye yuan was not very good.

being egged on by gao yuan at this time, plus being compelled by the circumstances, him changing side was also something within reason.

however, what made ye yuan somewhat surprised was that at this time, his disciple, gu han, suddenly said, “master, without ye yuan, we couldn’t even get down the natural chasm. just now, he saved everyone’s lives too! as the host, if we show ingratitude for kindness like this, unless all the people here today die, otherwise, who would still dare to cooperate with our river eternal imperial city in the future?”

ling zikun’s expression changed and sure enough, started to somewhat hesitate.

gao yuan gave a cold snort and said, “junior, it isn’t your turn to speak here! ling zikun, coming down here, everyone is just using each other! this kid bringing us down is merely wanting to rely on our strength. there isn’t any ungratefulness or treachery!”

ling zikun was caught in the middle, his face had a difficult look.

the fiend race powerhouses opposite were immediately dumbstruck with astonishment, all exchanging glances.

this kind of situation was what they completely did not expect.

the soul devouring devil cloud formation did not make these people slaughter each other. they did not expect that they schemed against each other and started to fight in the nest now.

ye yuan who had been silent all along suddenly opened his mouth and said, “if i were you all, i’d worry about myself first!”

gao yuan sneered and said, “punk, you’re trying to scare this old man? this kind of method, this old man has stopped playing more than 100 thousand years ago!”

ye yuan shrugged his shoulders and did not have the intention of explaining.

but in the next instant, a series of scurrying sounds suddenly came over.

everyone’s faces changed. turning to look, their scalps involuntarily tingled.

there was a large stretch of darkness all around, with no end in sight. they were already surrounded by a large group of rats!

these rats were all incomparably huge. furthermore, the numbers were extremely high.

these rats’ auras were not very powerful, only having the aura of rank three divine beasts. but such a large number made them feel in despair.

“deboning great rat! these are deboning great rats! we ... we got caught in a rat tide!” gao yuan cried out sharply.

his voice was too high, resulting in becoming somewhat squeaking. clearly, he had also fallen into immense terror in his heart.

deboning great rats were very ferocious savage beasts. places that they passed through, not a blade of grass lived.

encountering living things, they would definitely chomp until not even bone residue remained; hence, the name.

those deboning great rats’ eyes emitted rays of red light in the gloomy darkness, giving people a very sinister feeling.

everyone felt goosebumps breaking out all over, seemingly smelling the scent of death.

“it’s over, it’s over! i ... i don’t want to die here!”

“what to do? heard that encountering deboning great rats, there’s absolutely no reason to survive!”

“why? why is it that under such a powerful forcefield, there is still deboning great rats, this kind of powerful existence, existing?”

...

the human’s side was panicking and already in a flustered mess.

one scream of horror after another revealed the despair in their hearts.

ye yuan said coolly, “you guys enjoy it well. this little lord won’t accompany you all to play any longer!”

finished talking, there was a spatial laws undulation. ye yuan brought zheng qi and the rest and directly flew into the air.

when everyone saw this scene, their eyeballs almost popped out.

heavenstar and di en looked at ye yuan with incomparable shock and exclaimed, “spatial laws! he actually really comprehended spatial laws! this brat’s talent is truly too terrifying!”

heavenstar knew that ye yuan drew parallels from inference, and understood a bit of superficial spatial laws.

but now, for ye yuan to be able to fly in the air under this kind of powerful forcefield, it showed that his spatial laws comprehension was already very remarkable.

one had to know, ye yuan was a guy who could trigger great dao heavenly melody.

not only was this kid’s alchemy dao heaven-defying, but now, he also stepped onto a very terrifying road in martial dao.

this was not good news to them.

gao yuan revealed a fierce look and said in a solemn voice, “want to go?! how can it be that easy!”

gao yuan released his aura and was about to smack towards the ye yuan and co. in the air.

but his aura made those deboning great rats thoroughly erupt.

swoosh! swoosh! swoosh!

the massive rat tide swallowed the people up frenziedly.

gao yuan had yet to have time to launch the attack and was already utterly engulfed by the frenzied rat tide.

at his prime, he naturally came and went freely in this rat tide.

but now, his realm was heavily suppressed, his strength greatly discounted.

facing these powerful deboning great rats, he also felt rather taxed.

the claws of deboning great rats were extremely sharp. furthermore, their skin and fur were extremely tough.

even if one came out alone, challenging an origin deity realm powerhouse by itself was no problem at all, let alone such a terrifying number.

“charge out in one go! if we get trapped here, there’s only death!” gao yuan roared wildly.

the current gao yuan crisscrossed with sword energy, holding it in and rushed inside with a burst of power.

his strength was powerful, the others immediately followed behind him without prior agreement, breaking through towards inside.

the fiend race powerhouses also could not care about opposing the humans at this time, all sparing no effort to fight with the deboning great rats.

but very soon, they discovered something amiss.

these deboning great rats were not ordinary deboning great rats at all!

these deboning great rats’ bodies carried a strange forcefield. furthermore, they could even respond and cooperate with each other across a great distance, making those martial artists’ footsteps become heavy.

“these are all variants of deboning great rats! it’s over, with this, it’s thoroughly over!” someone exclaimed.

puchi!

a sharp claw directly tore that martial artist’s throat.

then, a large group of huge rats rushed up. he no longer made a sound.

below was bathed in blood, but ye yuan and the others flew in the air very leisurely.

the more zheng qi looked below, the more struck with horror he became.

this rat tide simply had no end in sight.

in this long while that they flew, they actually had not seen the edge yet!
