Although Qin Zhaoyun was mocking Zhao Yi, he was incomparably shocked in his heart.

First, he was shocked at the speed of Ye Yuan’s cultivation. The second was shocked that Ye Yuan could actually have a fierce battle with Zhao Yi until like this at middle-stage Origin Deity.

“Enough crap! This kid comprehended spatial laws. It’s very hard to tangle with! Hurry over and help!” Zhao Yi shouted coldly.

Qin Zhaoyun and Wen Yiyang trembled all over and exchanged a glance, their eyes full of disbelief.

Spatial laws were a legendary power of law!

How in the world did this kid accomplish it?

“Brat, don’t be rampant! You cast yourself into the net today and can’t escape even if you grow wings!”

Qin Zhaoyun shouted and also joined in the battle.

A hint of surprise flashed across in Wen Yiyang’s eyes, but he finally still decided to make a move against Ye Yuan.

Terrifying power of laws suffused everywhere, turning the surrounding houses into dust.

Three mighty half-step divine lords, how astonishing was the destructive power?

Ye Yuan appeared too delicate to stand up to a gust of breeze under the besiegement of three great half-step Divine Lords.

But he just stood firm and did not fall!

The three people exhausted all of their means and could not capture a corner of Ye Yuan’s sleeves.

On the contrary, Ye Yuan’s casual sword forced them into a fluster.

Both sides actually could not do anything to the other!

But this scene made everyone dumbfounded with shock.

How powerful was half-step Divine Lord? Three people joining hands actually could not deal with a middle-stage Origin Deity.

Ye Yuan was still as freakish as before!

“This ... No wonder he dared to swagger his way back! Ye Yuan’s strength is really too fearsome!”

“Spatial laws are a supreme law. Even Divine Lord powerhouses are unable to easily comprehend it. He’s only Origin Deity Realm and actually comprehended it already!”

“In a short 20 year’s time, Ye Yuan’s strength actually already rivals half-step Divine Lord. Simply too inconceivable.”

“If he didn’t leave, our Wu Meng Capital City would have utterly risen! This glory belongs to Wu Meng Capital City!”

...

Ye Yuan came and went like a shadow, moving between the three people and did not have the slightest hint of being suppressed.

Ning Siyu watched this great battle in the Clearwind Inn and said in shock, “Turns out that Master Ye’s Martial Dao strength is actually so formidable! No wonder I actually can’t even last one move under his hands! I really don’t know how he cultivates. He’s also not much older than I am, why is he so strong?”

Little Fatty said, “Ye Yuan this person can’t be gauged with common sense at all. Any genius will be eclipsed when placed in front of him.”

Ning Siyu did not refute this. Regarding this claim, she did not have any objections.

Even her own master had to call Master Ye when he saw Ye Yuan, his attitude could be imagined.

Saying these words could scare people all over the city!

At this time, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly moved, retreating out of the three people’s encirclement.

That feeling was very relaxed and lighthearted.

Three mighty half-step divine lords could not even accomplish trapping him!

The three people looked at Ye Yuan, incomparably apprehensive.

“The main guy has come, not playing with you all anymore. But ... Qin Zhaoyun’s life, I’ll accept it today,” Ye Yuan said coolly, like talking about a trivial matter.

An aura of a sovereign descending upon the world fell from the sky. Qin Xiao stood in the air, stepping out from the void.

He sized Ye Yuan up with a playful look, as if very intrigued.

When Qin Zhaoyun saw Qin Xiao appear, his heart also settled back in place and he said with a cold smile, “Brat, you got it backward! Today, no one can save you!”

Qin Xiao looked at Ye Yuan and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “I really don’t know where your courage came from, to actually dare return to Wu Meng Capital City! I really want to take a look at your trump card.”

Facing Qin Xiao, Ye Yuan had a calm look.

Back then, Qin Xiao was Wu Meng Capital City’s only Divine Lord Realm existence.

But now, Ye Yuan had even witnessed before the ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord Xuan Yu. A puny little Qin Xiao, he naturally did not regard him with importance.

Ye Yuan put away the long sword and stood with his hands behind his back as he said coolly, “Relax, you’ll be able to see it right away.”

With Qin Xiao’s strength, how could he be frightened by Ye Yuan?

He said with a faint smile, “No matter what ace in the hold you have, in front of a Divine Lord powerhouse, they are all trash!”

While talking, Qin Xiao’s aura suddenly rose. A peerlessly powerful pressure instantly enveloped several streets, making everyone feel incomparably suppressed.

“Second-layered heaven Divine Lord!” Wen Yiyang’s face changed and he exclaimed.

Qin Zhaoyun’s face revealed a look of wild ecstasy as he said, “Hahaha, congratulations to City Lord Your Excellency for breaking through!”

The more powerful Qin Xiao’s strength was, the more it was massive good news for his Qin Family.

Therefore, Qin Zhaoyun was virtually excited until he was about to jump up.

But when Ye Yuan saw this scene, he smiled instead and said, “Are you demonstrating your martial might to me? Would I not know that your breakthrough was still because of the rank four divine pill I helped you win?”

Only then did everyone abruptly come to realize the truth, recalling the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial back then.

Several hundred capital cities’ geniuses all gathered together. Only the one who obtained first place could get this rank four divine pill. It could be seen that it would be an ordinary item. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Qin Xiao breaking through because of it was something logical.

Ye Yuan’s words made the faces of the civilians in the city become strange.

But they did not dare to speak out. The divine sense of a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse was too keen, they did not dare to criticize City Lord His Excellency.

But in their hearts, they all gave rise to contemptuous emotions.

Originally, with Wu Meng Capital City’s strength, it was impossible to win the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial’s first place.

However, Ye Yuan helped him to do it.

It was because of Ye Yuan that he could break through to become a second-layered heaven Divine Lord!

Now, this scene, what was it if not a classic returning kindness with ingratitude?

Qin Xiao’s face turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Medicinal pills are merely external objects. Wanting to break through, one still has to rely on one’s own talent! A mere medicinal pill is but adding flowers to embroidery!”

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “Is that so? Sovereign Advent Pill can increase the chances of initial-stage Divine Lord Realm martial artists breaking through. The one I brought back was a high-grade Sovereign Advent Pill. It could at least increase the chances of breakthrough by more than 30%. Your luck was good and broke through successfully. Without the Sovereign Advent Pill, can you break through?”

Ye Yuan’s one sentence made everyone cry out in shock.

A medicinal pill capable of helping a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse breakthrough was naturally no ordinary medicinal pill.

By comparison, this kind of medicinal pill was the most expensive kind among the same rank medicinal pills.

Rank four divine pills, the value was easily calculated with more than 100 million divine essence stones.

Most likely, even if Qin Xiao took out all of his net worth, he could not buy it either.

Qin Xiao did not expect that Ye Yuan actually recognized this rank four divine pill.

Saying it out in front of everybody at this time, it really swept away all of his face.

He gave a cold snort, turning angry from embarrassment and said, “No matter how razor-tongued you are, you can’t escape death today too! I want to see just what your trump card is!”

Finished talking, Qin Xiao pointed at the void. A strong world power tore through the void, shooting straight for Ye Yuan.

Under a finger point, the wind and clouds changed colors!

However, Ye Yuan still looked at Qin Xiao with a smile that was not a smile, seemingly having no intention of avoiding at all.

Right at this time, the void trembled. A figure came into being and blocked in front of Ye Yuan.

Only to see him flick his sleeves grandly. Likewise, a surge of world power spread out.

This force was actually even more terrifying than Qin Xiao’s!

Qin Xiao’s finger was annihilated casually just like that.
