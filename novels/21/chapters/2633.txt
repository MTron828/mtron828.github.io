Chapter 2639: Sect Destroyed!

“No need to struggle anymore. You have no hope! Surrender!” Xiao Feibai looked at Feng Xuanyi who was covered in blood and said calmly.

Xiao Feibai’s opponent was Feng Xuanyi.

But Feng Xuanyi’s opponent was not just Xiao Feibai!

This was a sect destroying battle, not an individual challenge.

Xiao Feibai was strong, but among these hundred over Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, many of them were quasi-sect master level!

They were also grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. Although they were not as strong, they were absolutely not what ordinary elders could compare to.

The Pill Alliance’s strength was definitely more than just Xiao Feibai and Huangfu Cloudthink!

Feng Xuanyi’s clothes were tattered, his hair disheveled. How did he have the appearance of a sect master of his generation?

It was just that the firmness in his eyes made him not have the slightest dejection in terms of aura.

A sect master of his generation was a sect master of his generation!

Even if a hero reached a dead end, he would still shine with boundless radiance!

Beside him, those from there Martial Secure Heavenly Sect who were still fighting became fewer and fewer.

Under the Pill Alliance’s might, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect did not stand a chance at all.

But during the battle, he glimpsed the sect’s disciples rushing out of the heavy encirclement through the corners of his eyes, and a hint of relief flashed across his eyes.

He was grateful to Ye Yuan in his heart. He knew that only Ye Yuan could do this!

“Hahaha?… my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect has heaven surmounting pride! There’s only a sect master that dies after defeat; no lackey that drags out an ignoble existence! Yunqing, Ye Yuan, you must live on! With you guys around, my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect will illuminate the world again one day! Martial Uncle Yan, Feng Xuanyi will go first!”

Feng Xuanyi held the Heaven Killing Battlespear in his hand. All of a sudden, his aura surged to the sky.

A vague and insubstantial fluctuation instantly rendered the entire world with color.

At this moment, Martial Secure Sect Master was akin to a fiendgod on earth.

When Xiao Feibai saw this scene, his expression could not help changing slightly, a hint of respect showing in his eyes.

He knew that Feng Xuanyi was burning his own world power here, to assault that fleeting and ephemeral Saint Sovereign Heavenly Stratum at the final moment!

It was not for others, just for the last wisp of brilliance in life.

It was impossible to reach Saint Sovereign Heavenly Stratum.

But Feng Xuanyi’s strength would rise dramatically in an extremely short time.

This was his final glory!

After burning, he would be ashes.

“Sect Master, I’ll accompany you!” Seeing Feng Xuanyi like this, Luo Yunqing yelled angrily.

In this Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, the one that Luo Yunqing respected the most was Feng Xuanyi.

Back then, he had faded into the crowd. It was Feng Xuanyi who had discerning eyes, noticing him in the crowd, encouraging him, walking all the way until today.

A gentleman would die for his bosom friend!

For the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s sake, Luo Yunqing could likewise sacrifice himself.

But, right at the moment he immolated his world power, a powerful force suppressed over, scattering his immolation.

“Yunqing, you can’t die! Remember, from now on, Ye Yuan is the new Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s Sect Master! You have to assist him and revitalize the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect!” Feng Xuanyi said in a cold voice.

Luo Yunqing’s whole body trembled, but his gaze landed on Ye Yuan who was behind the black-robed old man.

Ye Yuan himself also trembled all over.

Feng Xuanyi did not choose Luo Yunqing, but chose him!

This was a heavy entrustment!

Feng Xuanyi’s gaze similarly landed on Ye Yuan.

He was clear that Luo Yunqing’s sword intent surmounted the heavens, and was arrogant and unyielding; just like a sharp sword.

But he was not the best candidate to revitalize the sect.

In contrast, Ye Yuan had more leadership qualities and was more suited to leading the sect to rise again.

Luo Yunqing clenched his jaws tightly and said with tears in his eyes, “Sect Master, Yunqing got it!”

Feng Xuanyi held the long spear out and said in a solemn voice, “I’ll open up the path! You go out!”

Swoosh!

Feng Xuanyi stabbed with the long spear in his hands, his entire person turning into a streak of electricity, tearing across the sky!

His speed and strength soared significantly in an instant.

Clearly, it already exceeded the domain of Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum!

“All move away!” Xiao Feibai yelled coldly, immediately moving aside.

He knew that the Feng Xuanyi at this time was like a firework shooting into the sky; shining with boundless radiance.

Nobody could stop him at this moment! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Feibai retreated quickly, but some Jade Sovereign Heavens did not have time to retreat, and was directly pierced through by Feng Xuanyi!

Luo Yunqing did not dare to be neglectful, enduring the tremendous pain and following after.

Ye Yuan had a calm look, but his heart hurt like it was pricked by a needle.

“Everyone listen up! I, Feng Xuanyi, immediately issue a sect master order, and appoint Luo Yunqing and Ye Yuan two people, as Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s elders!”

“I, Feng Xuanyi, am willing to give up the position of Sect Master! But, Luo Yunqing and Ye Yuan, I’m protecting them for sure!”

… …

Scenes of past events flowed in Ye Yuan’s heart.

The braver the current Feng Xuanyi was, the more painful it was for him.

This sect master with great courage and great bearing would soon disappear like the wind.

Feng Xuanyi’s life was flowing away rapidly.

When Huangfu Cloudthink saw the situation, he could not help frowning slightly.

He gave the black-robed old man a glance, then turned around and flew straight for Feng Xuanyi!

Boom!

Huangfu Cloudthink actually confronted Feng Xuanyi head-on!

With one blow, Huangfu Cloudthink was directly blown away.

But he did not suffer much damage.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted. It turned out that earlier, Huangfu Cloudthink actually did not use his full strength yet!

At present, Feng Xuanyi was a terrifying half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven existence.

Huangfu Cloudthink could actually clash with Feng Xuanyi!

This Huangfu Cloudthink’s strength was likely not far from Saint Sovereign Heavenly Stratum too.

Feng Xuanyi was greatly surprised too, but he did not care about it, brandishing his spear and rushing forward again.

The two people unfolded a terrifying to the extreme great battle in the air.

Luckily, under Feng Xuanyi’s lead, the two already charged out of the encirclement.

Luo Yunqing turned into a wisp of green smoke and disappeared into the horizon.

However, another streak of light followed closely behind, chasing after.

Who could it be if not Xiao Feibai?

Clearly, the Pill Alliance was going to tear the weed out by the roots!

But Feng Xuanyi was already powerless to stop him.

The black-robed old man did not say anything all along. At this time, he suddenly spoke up, “Boy, you should go now! Did you hear Xuanyi boy’s words just now?”

Crack, crack, crack?…

Ye Yuan’s finger joints were clenched by him until it made cracking sounds.

The things that he had experienced were far too many.

But such a terrible battle today still touched his nerves.

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect that was once powerful and prosperous was destroyed just like that!

Yes, from today onwards, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect would have its name removed from the Rainclear Continent!

Ye Yuan was not a saint. Even if he had experienced too much, the hatred in his heart currently still filled his chest.

He nodded his head fiercely and said, “Senior, rest assured. I’ll avenge this hatred!”

The black-robed old man turned his head, Ye Yuan could see the wrinkles on his face clearly.

But there was a faint smile on the other party’s face and he said, “There’s no need to take revenge! But you must pass down the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s inheritance! The Pill Alliance’s foundation surpasses your imagination, they are not what you can afford to provoke! Remember, before accumulating enough strength, you mustn’t take revenge!”

Finished saying, the black-robed old man flicked his sleeves grandly.

Ye Yuan only felt his two eyes go dark, directly being pushed into the space.

He was greatly shocked in his heart! He did not expect that this old man’s understanding of spatial rule was actually so strong!

But right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!
