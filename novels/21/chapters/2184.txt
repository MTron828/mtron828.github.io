Chapter 2188: That’s Right, Playing You

When he said this, Li Yue was practically sobbing.

His greatest reliance was the Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella!

Under such a circumstance, it could let his strength soar.

But who knew that Ye Yuan’s greatest trump card was not whatever golden needles piercing acupoints, nor was it some Heavenly Dao True Word. It was actually spatial law!

While Ye Yuan could not win against him, Ye Yuan did not need to fight with him at all.

As long as Ye Yuan ran the timer out, he could only stretch his neck out for the executer’s blade.

This was impressive!

“Sixth Firmament spatial law ... Brother Ye’s strength is truly inconceivable!”

“At a young age, how can he be so monstrous? Could it be that this guy started cultivating in his mother’s womb?”

“Heh, Li Yue this fellow calculated everything, but he failed to calculate this. He finally kicked a metal plate today.”

... ...

Ye Yuan looked at Li Yue and said coolly, “Sparing you, it’s not that I can’t.”

When everyone saw the situation, they secretly nodded one after another.

This was also within reason. Li Yue’s status in Clearwater Bodhidharma was rather high. Otherwise, he would not have been bestowed the Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella.

Ye Yuan was apprehensive of the faction behind him, so sparing his life was also ought to be.

Otherwise, after going out, Ye Yuan would have endless trouble.

Li Yue’s eyes glinted and he said in pleasant surprise, “As long as Brother Ye lifts your hand high up in mercy, Li Yue is willing to pay any price”

Ye Yuan’s finger pointed at the void, pointing at the Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella as he said, “I want it.”

Li Yue’s face changed, his expression ugly as he said, “This ... The Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella is my Clearwater Bodhidharma’s precious treasure. It can’t be easily given to people. If handed to Brother Ye, I’ll definitely be heavily punished after going back!”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “If you don’t hand it to me, you’ll suffer a heavy punishment right now.”

Li Yue was silent for a moment. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Fine, I’ll give it to Brother Ye!”

His hatred toward Ye Yuan in his heart was already heinous.

But the circumstances were stronger than people. He had no choice but to lower his head right now.

Li Yue secretly swore in his heart. After going out, he would definitely request his elders to take action and exterminate this hateful punk.

At once, Li Yue did not hesitate either, calling in the Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella and wiped away his divine soul imprint, and gave this quasi-emperor level empyrean spirit treasure to Ye Yuan just like this.

Done with all these, the time limit for golden needles piercing acupoints finally arrived as well.

The Empyreans present wailed out, all collapsing from exhaustion.

But being able to preserve their lives was already very good, this bit of agony was naturally no big deal.

Furthermore, everyone discovered that Ye Yuan’s golden needles piercing acupoint technique was extremely profound. It only made them collapse from exhaustion and did not cause any damage to their bodies or cultivation.

This way, everyone was naturally endlessly grateful toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan put away the Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella, arrived before Li Yue, and said coolly, “The time is up. I can send you on your way.”

Li Yue’s expression changed wildly and he said in alarm and anger, “You ... You played me?”

Ye Yuan admitted it very shamelessly: “That’s right, played you. Wanting the Ten Directional Forbidden Spirit Umbrella was merely to drag it out. Do you think that without you, I won’t be able to wipe away your divine sense imprint?”

Ever since absorbing the large amount of sea of law that time, the Soul Suppressing Pearl already completely advanced. It became a heavenly emperor spirit treasure.

With the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s current strength, wouldn’t wiping away Li Yue’s divine sense imprint still be easily accomplished?

The reason why he played the hypocrite with every semblance of sincerity was merely to prevent a cornered dog from biting, that was all.

Li Yue was incomparably ashamed and resentful and roared furiously, “You ... If you dare kill me, Clearwater Bodhidharma won’t let you off!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what? You taunted and jeered along the way, I couldn’t be bothered to haggle over it. But when you attempted to kill the abyss monster leader, your time of death arrived!”

Ye Yuan was not someone who sought revenge for the smallest grievance, but if Li Yue killed the devil monster leader, it would be equivalent to severing hopes of finding Li-er.

He could not tolerate this!

Li-er’s life or death was unknown. Ye Yuan was in a heavy mood to begin with.

Li Yue provoked him time and again. He originally could not be bothered to haggle over it.

But in the end, he actually repaid kindness with ingratitude and wanted to kill the devil monster leader.

One had to know, Ye Yuan was their group’s life savior!

Li Yue was simultaneously alarmed and enraged, but at this time, he was already a fish on the chopping board. So how could he still have the strength to resist Ye Yuan?

Currently, Li Yue’s divine essence had been exhausted. He did not have any spare strength to protect his body at all.

A cold light flashed. Li Yue perished, his Dao dissipating!

Everyone looked at this scene in great shock, being shocked by Ye Yuan’s ruthlessness and decisiveness.

A Sixth Firmament Empyrean, Clearwater Bodhidharma’s future Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, was blotted out by Ye Yuan just like that.

Those Clearwater Bodhidharma Empyreans were all silent like cicadas in winter, afraid of Ye Yuan transferring his anger onto them.

Who knew that Ye Yuan turned around and walked toward the abyss monster leader.

The monster leader looked at Ye Yuan, his eyes full of terror.

This human brat was too bizarre!

Ye Yuan was clearly different from other humans, aware of where the weakness of abyss monsters lay.

Detaining his tarnished black devil crystal, even if he had monstrous strength, he was also a piece of junk now.

“Human brat, give up! This empyrean won’t tell you what you want to know! It’s impossible for the noble abyss monsters to submit to humans!” The monster leader looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile.

“Is that so?”

Ye Yuan suddenly grabbed, holding the tarnished black devil crystal in his hand.

Chaos Heavenspan Canon quietly revolved and started absorbing the tarnished black devil crystal’s power.

The monster leader’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

This human was actually absorbing the tarnished black devil crystal’s power!

He could actually absorb the tarnished black devil crystal’s power!

He only felt that the strength in his body was being extracted bit by bit.

Ye Yuan’s speed of extracting the tarnished black devil crystal was not fast, but this way, the monster leader’s fear would gradually magnify.

“You rest assured. I won’t devour all of your strength. When your strength drops to the True God Realm, I’ll release your seal and let you go back. I think that your companions should be very happy to see you then,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The monster leader’s body shuddered again, its gaze full of terror.

The monster leader cried out, “You ... You’re a demon!”

Ye Yuan had lived for more than ten years in the Dragon Eye Cave and had killed before no idea how many abyss monsters. How could he not know their habits and characteristics?

The abyss monster world was a hundred times, a thousand times crueler than the human world!

The rise of a Sixth Firmament Empyrean devil leader followed the wake of countless slaughter and suppression.

When those companions of his see his strength fall to True God Realm, his outcome would be unbelievably wretched.

Ye Yuan ignored the devil leader, he just quietly absorbed the power in the tarnished black devil crystal.

True suffering was not dying all at once.

But the process of quietly waiting for death!

Terror spread in the devil leader’s body little by little.

The other Empyreans all quietly watched Ye Yuan, their eyes full of astonishment.

They could feel that the devil leader’s aura was diminishing bit by bit, while Ye Yuan’s aura was growing stronger little by little.

Ye Yuan was actually absorbing the devil monster leader’s strength to increase his own strength!

Just what kind of freak was this guy! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Finally, the devil monster leader could not endure this kind of despairing feeling and broke down.

“I ... I’ll talk! I’ll talk! I beg you, stop absorbing!”
