Chapter 1396 Don“t Be Too Harsh When Doing Things

On an open field, over a dozen figures were currently chasing each other.

Right at the front was a ball-shaped little fatty. Who could it be if not Xie Jingyi?

But behind him, were over a dozen people in hot pursuit.

Little Fatty was fat, looking incomparably clumsy. Yet, his movements were extremely swift and nimble. Those dozen over people could not catch up to him and could only eat dust behind him.

These few years, Ye Yuan had been providing him divine-grade cultivation medicinal pills all along.

Such a long time had passed, and Xie Jingyi already broke through to grand completion Grotto Profound.

Coupled with the fact that he trained to the sixth level in the Rockwind Cave, and furthermore, cultivated one of the six supreme academy skills, God Bewildering Step, his movement technique virtually reached the pinnacle in Grotto Profound Realm.

For these people to want to catch up to him, it was easier said than done.

“Damn fatty, quickly hand over the Crimson Firmament Fruit and we’ll spare you from death!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Damn fatty, don’t run if you have the capability!”

“Halt, you damn fatty! To actually dare take advantage of the situation and steal our spoils of war! When Your Father catches you, I’ll definitely tear you into pieces!”

...

This group of people could not catch up to Xie Jingyi no matter what. Each and every one of them started cursing in exasperation.

“I say, you guys already chased Lord Fatty for three days and night, are you tired or not? Isn’t it just a Crimson Firmament Fruit? Is there a need to be like this?” Xie Jingyi shouted loudly as he sprinted madly.

Three days ago, a group of people was currently in a fierce battle with three incredibly strong giant centipedes for this Crimson Firmament Fruit.

Little Fatty just happened to pass by there. Seeing the group of people in the midst of fierce fighting, his thoughts stirred, making use of his movement technique’s advantage, swiping the Crimson Firmament Fruit.

With this, Little Fatty incurred public wrath.

Those people at the back forced the three giant centipedes away and chased after him desperately.

This pursuit lasted three days and three nights.

The Crimson Firmament Fruit was a very rare spirit fruit, a favorite spirit medicine of body-refining martial artists.

Little Fatty knew that Ye Yuan was a body-refining martial artist too. Furthermore, his strength was quite strong, that was why he had the idea.

“Isn’t it just a Crimson Firmament Fruit? Said it lightly! Damn you fatty, stop! How are you running faster and faster?”

Liu Jin was currently cursing when he saw a figure appear in front of Little Fatty, and could not help being overjoyed.

“The friend in front, help us stop that damn fatty! Later, each of us will share with you three stalks of spirit medicines! Just have to stop him for a moment will do!” Liu Jin shouted.

Liu Jin and company were not considered far from Xie Jingyi. As long as he delayed him for a moment, they would be able to catch up.

At that time, Little Fatty would be hard-pressed to escape even with wings!

As for giving the three promised stalks of spirit medicines or not, it would depend on the mood.

Little Fatty naturally saw the arrival too. But he was not alarmed and was overjoyed instead, his feet accelerating even more, sprinting over towards that person.

Swoosh!

Little Fatty’s figure flashed and hid behind that person nimbly, and actually did not run anymore!

When Liu Jin and the rest saw this, they could not help being overjoyed.

It turned out that these two people were together. This little fatty’s brain wouldn’t be spoiled, right? To actually hide behind a late-stage Grotto Profound rookie?

“Heh, I knew that you would come and find. Lord Fatty indeed didn’t judge wrongly. Those trash will be left to you. Lord Fatty was chased by them for three days and nights and I’m exhausted. I’ll go and rest first.”

Ye Yuan had his hands behind his back as he said with a faint smile, “Relax, leave it to me.”

At this time, Liu Jin and the rest arrived. Looking at Ye Yuan with a cold smile, they said, “Kid, your bit of strength also wishes to stand up for people?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Whether I have the strength or not, wouldn’t you know if you come and size it up?”

Liu Jin laughed loudly and said, “Did everybody hear that? This late-stage Grotto Profound guy wants to size us up!”

“Hahaha!”

Everyone roared loudly with laughter.

“Attack together, dice up this punk who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, then go capture that damn fatty!” Liu Jin shouted, wielding his sword and advancing.

Facing a bunch of grand completion Grotto Profound powerhouses, Ye Yuan was firm as a rock.

When this group of people came close, the Evil Extermination Sword suddenly attacked, a sword directly sweeping across.

A swift and fierce sword energy made the faces of Liu Jin and the rest suddenly change.

“Ouch!”

Liu Jin reacted fast too, directly doing a roll, narrowly avoiding this horizontal Sundering Stars.

The few people in the middle clearly did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so powerful. Caught unprepared, it was already too late to dodge.

Helpless, they could only crush the jade pendant, their figures directly vanishing from sight. Several storage rings dropped down from their bodies.

Liu Jin did a roll and hurriedly crawled to his feet. Looking at Ye Yuan, he had an appearance akin to facing a great enemy.

“This kid is so strong! We’ll do a four-sided pincer and don’t give him a chance to attack!” Liu Jin shouted.

He raised his sword and was just about to rush forward, but he discovered that no one behind him moved.

There were even a few who took a few steps back, turning tail and directly slipping away.

Got to be joking!

That sword just now was too swift and fierce! Wasn’t fighting with this guy seeking death?

Can’t beat, it was naturally running.

“You bunch of timid fellows! Traitors!” Liu Jin said furiously.

Liu Jin raised his sword and already rushed to not far away from Ye Yuan, but his figure abruptly stopped.

He suddenly changed to a smiling face and said to Ye Yuan with a flattering smile, “Haha, just now ... was just joking with Lord Fatty! Just joking around!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Are you doing it yourself? Or let me do it?”

Liu Jin’s expression changed and he said embarrassedly, “I ... I’ll do it myself! I’ll do it myself! That ... if I hand over the storage ring, can ... can I not crush the jade pendant?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s fine.”

The moment Liu Jin heard, it was like he was granted amnesty, hurriedly taking out his storage ring and putting it on the ground, then running away.

Little Fatty was absolutely tickled watching by the side and said with a hearty laugh, “Hahaha! This bunch of turtle grandsons[1]! Just now, they were still flaunting their might, why did they shrivel up now? To dare bully your Lord Fatty, you know my prowess now, right? Ye Yuan, finish off all of them!”

But Ye Yuan ignored Little Fatty and said with a faint smile, “You guys too, put down the storage rings and get lost!”

How could the others still dare to stay? Each of them left behind their storage ring, fleeing like a puff of smoke.

Regarding Ye Yuan letting them go, Little Fatty was very displeased and muttered, “This Lord Fatty, I, was chased by them for three days and nights! You actually let them go just like this?”

Ye Yuan reached out his hand and beckoned, collecting all of those storage rings, and said with a smile, “Don’t be too harsh when doing things, we’ll always meet again! Don’t you say so?”

Little Fatty’s eyes swiveled around and he immediately said joyfully, “Haha, you, this fellow, are simply rotten to the bones! But, Lord Fatty, I, like it! Hahaha!”

Little Fatty retrieved the Crimson Firmament Fruit from inside his storage ring and threw it to Ye Yuan, saying, “This thing is for you! Just a Crimson Firmament Fruit, this bunch of bastards actually chased me for three days and nights. In the end, they even lost their own storage rings. Was it worth it or not? Haha.”

Ye Yuan received the Crimson Firmament Fruit, his eyes lighting up.

Dustless had once given Ye Yuan a body-refinement pill formula before. These few years, Ye Yuan already gathered the other spirit medicines. He only lacked this Crimson Firmament Fruit!

He did not expect that he got it without any effort!

[1] It also means bastard.
