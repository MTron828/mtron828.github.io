Chapter 1980: Doomsday Battle!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A stream of soul force crept out. The remains actually started melting from the middle.

Finally, it was divided into five portions.

The Empyrean’s residual thought was currently like an aggrieved little wifey, not daring to even breathe loudly.

He slumbered for countless tens of thousands of years, but what he waited for was actually such a result?

Even thinking about it felt aggrieved!

Getting a share of the remains, Song Yu said very contentedly, “Heh heh, Brother Ye’s means really emerged in endless streams. This Song has broadened his horizons.”

However, the shock in his heart could not be described using words.

He could guess that Ye Yuan definitely had a divine soul type empyrean spirit treasure on him!

Would he freaking ... give it a rest already? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Stellar War Banner, Qinghong Battle Armor, now, there was also another extremely rare divine soul type empyrean spirit treasure.

When did empyrean spirit treasures become common street-ware too?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Thank me for what. Want to thank someone , you naturally have to thank this senior. He put in painstaking effort and sealed his lifetime power into the remains for so many years, waiting for future generations to come. He is very noble!”

“Puhwark!”

The Empyrean’s residual thought almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

Don’t make fun of people like this!

Song Yu and the rest had smiling faces, treating it as a joke.

The Empyrean residual thought said with a bitter face, “L-Little Brother, you look; the remains are already given to you. So can you raise your hand high up in mercy and let ... let this decrepit old man go?”

In this short while, his term of self-address changed several times.

He first went from this Empyrean, to this old man, finally becoming this decrepit old man.

At this time, he already became incomparably humble in front of Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What’s the hurry? You’ve already slept for so many years and finally managed to come out. We have got to chat more, right?”

I ... I don’t know what the f*ck to tell you!

“H-Huhu, I wonder what Little Brother wants to chat about? T-This decrepit old man has slumbered for too long and already doesn’t remember many things.”

The Empyrean’s residual thought revealed a smile that was even uglier than crying.

Ye Yuan was secretly surprised.

This guy already slumbered until his memories dissipated away. How long did he sleep?

50 million years?

100 million years?

One billion years?

Ye Yuan said, “What’s your name?”

The Empyrean’s residual thought was thinking about it, but then he shook his head and said, “Can’t remember clearly anymore. This old decrepit self remembers that ... they all seemed to have called me Daoless back then.”

“Daoless? Huhu, as your name implies,” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

This guy sealed his remnant thought inside the remains. It was clearly harboring the thought of harming people.

Presumably, he was also not some good person when he was alive.

Except, encountering Ye Yuan now, he could not stir up any waves no matter how formidable he was.

Daoless’s expression was rather ugly as he said with a bitter smile, “I-I’ve incurred Little Brother’s ridicule.”

Ye Yuan said, “Let me ask you; just what kind of place is this Ancient God Battlefield?”

Daoless’s brows furrowed together, seemingly thinking hard.

But in the end, he shook his head and said, “It’s been too long, so I really can’t remember clearly anymore. This old decrepit self only remembers that this battle back then swept the entire Heavenspan World into action. Virtually no powerhouse could stay out of it.”

Although Daoless’s words were flat, when Ye Yuan and the rest heard it, they felt struck with terror.

A war that was unequaled by contemporaries that swept throughout the entire Heavenspan World, how tragic and spectacular was that?!

It seemed like too many peerless powerhouses had fallen back then in this Ancient God Battlefield. No wonder it was so dangerous.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly as he said, “I heard that Dao Ancestor powerhouses have perished here before; was there such a thing?”

After another bout of brain-racking, Daoless nodded and said, “That great battle, no one was able to detach themselves from it; even Dao Ancestors could not as well! Not only did Dao Ancestor powerhouses die in battle, but there were also even more than one.”

“Impossible! Dao Ancestor powerhouses are undying and imperishable, so how can they possibly die? Humph, you also don’t come up with a draft when lying!” Song Yu’s expression changed slightly and he said with a cold snort.

But Daoless shook his head and said, “I didn’t lie. The terror of that war isn’t what you can imagine at all.”

Daoless’s complexion was somewhat ashen as if those blurry memories made him very afraid.

The few people’s complexions were very ugly too. It was still their first time hearing that Dao Ancestor powerhouses would actually die!

Dao Ancestor powerhouses were existences that obtained the recognition of the laws of a region. They were equivalent to the representatives of Heavenly Dao, so who could kill them?

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Looks like this Heavenspan World is far from as simple as we imagine!”

Although Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was formidable, he was also just an Empyrean in the end. He was not even a Heavenly Emperor.

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, that was another world, another circle.

They might have some connection with a certain Dao Ancestor, and would also naturally know things that many people did not know.

As for Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, he had not entered that circle yet. So the things that he knew were also very limited.

All these required Ye Yuan to go and fumble himself around.

“Regarding that war, how much do you still remember?” Ye Yuan asked again.

Daoless shook his head and said, “I can’t remember clearly anymore. This old decrepit self was also just a small fry in that war. I only remember that later on we called that war ... Doomsday Battle!”

Ye Yuan’s face changed and he said, “Doomsday battle ... What a terrifying name! Did the entire Heavenspan World come close to dying out? Then who were your opponents?”

Daoless frowned and said, “I can’t remember too clearly anymore. I only remember that ... it was a race war!”

“Race war? Could it be the human race and fiend race? Or demon race?” Ye Yuan frowned and said.

“It was not any of them! I ... I can’t remember anymore! I only remember that that race was very terrifying! Very terrifying! They ... were too strong!”

When saying this, Ye Yuan could feel the tremors in Daoless’s heart.

Clearly, he really feared that race immensely.

“Alright, no matter what race they are, they already don’t exist in the Heavenspan World anymore at present,” Ye Yuan said helplessly.

Hearing these two people’s conversation, the shock in Song Yu four people’s hearts practically could not use words to describe.

They seemed to have heard the greatest secrets of this Heavenspan World.

It turned out that Dao Ancestor powerhouses would die too!

It turned out that an apocalyptic war had happened to the Heavenspan World before!

It turned out that ...

It was just a shame that Daoless’s memories were too incomplete. Otherwise, they would definitely be able to know even more things about the doomsday battle.

“L-Little Brother, this old decrepit self has already told you everything that I know. C-Can I go?” Daoless said with an ugly expression.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Go? Huhu, you even wanted to take possession of me. Do you still hope for me to let you go?”

Daoless said gloomily, “That ... That was all a misunderstanding ... A misunderstanding!”

Ye Yuan said with a cold smile, “A misunderstanding? I don’t feel that it was a misunderstanding! You deliberately planned to seal yourself inside the remains; wasn’t it in order to seize possession of people? If I let you out, are you planning on finding a suitable fleshy body, and then finding me to take revenge again?”

Daoless’s expression was ugly as he said, “H-How is that possible?”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said coolly, “Don’t need to say anymore! Letting you go is impossible. I give you two options. It is either you follow me starting today or you die!”
