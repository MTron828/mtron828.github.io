Chapter 2238: Ravaging Heavenly Emperors!

An unbelievably strong sense of crisis welled up in Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s heart.

He looked at that extremely mocking smile of Ye Yuan’s. No idea why, it was like seeing the faint smile of the grim reaper.

“Not good! There’s a trap!”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s figure suddenly stopped, wanting to pull out and leave.

But how could it still make it in time?

“Formation, arise!” Ye Yuan said with a cold cry.

Suddenly, the seven great Heavenly Emperors’ area became a misty stretch.

“Ahh! Souleater Beasts’ saliva! This is the saliva of Souleater Beasts!” Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn gave a miserable scream. His cries were filled with alarm and terror.

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

... ...

Miserable cries came over one after another. The seven great Heavenly Emperors seemed to have fallen into hell all of a sudden, crying out at the top of their voices.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives moved the fastest according to the circumstances, directly breaking the formation and leaving.

But he was the first who charged over. The Souleater Beasts’ saliva that he was contaminated by was also the most.

Although Ye Yuan’s array formation was formidable, it was nothing to Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

However, the goal of Ye Yuan’s array formation was not to trap them. It was just to make them get contaminated with the Souleater Beasts’ saliva.

Heavenly Emperor Zhao Hun’s reaction was the slowest. His whole body from head to toe was practically tainted by Souleater Beasts’ saliva.

His body instantly became much dimmer.

The other Heavenly Emperors were also infected with Souleater Beasts’ saliva to varying degrees!

For some time, miserable cries lingered in their ears.

With the addition of Ye Yuan, those Ghost Dao powerhouses’ pressure fell drastically and already broke up the remaining Bloodwing Bats.

When they saw that the seven great Heavenly Emperors were actually in this state, each and every one of them looked toward Ye Yuan with incredible shock.

Not only did this guy not die, he killed his way back instead and turned the Heavenly Emperors into this state!

Was ... he still human?

“Damn it! How can this Souleater Beast saliva be so strong? This Heavenly Emperor ... This Heavenly Emperor feels like I’m about to asphyxiate already!’ Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze finally revealed a hint of panic.

Ye Yuan took his time to pluck the Blood Lotus Flower, put it away, and said with a faint smile, “I refined this Souleater Beast’s saliva before. The power ... is roughly 100 times of the original!”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’ pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of terror.

Souleater Beast saliva was a potent toxin to soul bodies to begin with. Now, this was actually 100 times greater than before!

This lethality was too great!

On Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s body, Dao marks flickered incessantly.

But it was still unable to stop the dissipation of the body!

Amidst the miserable cries, Heavenly Emperor Zhao Hun’s figure became dimmer and dimmer, finally dissipating without a trace.

The Ghost Empyreans only felt their scalps tingle, looking at this scene with great terror.

The scene before their eyes was seriously too shocking.

“A ... A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse died just like that?” A Ghost Empyrean still did not quite dare to believe it.

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were extremely hard to kill and also represented invincibility. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In their view, Heavenly Emperors were undying existences.

But now, one was actually killed by an Empyrean just like that!

All the gazes gathered on Ye Yuan, full of dread.

This human was too terrifying!

Very soon, another Heavenly Emperor scattered and disappeared completely, dead!

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, looking at this scene with a calm face.

Dao marks revolved on the Heavenly Emperors’ bodies, resisting the corrosion of the Souleater Beast saliva madly.

After all, they were Heavenly Emperor powerhouses. Enveloping in Dao marks, their life force was extremely strong.

Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn, and a few others were more careful. The Souleater Beast’s salivas they were tainted by were not much. They barely managed to resist it.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s strength was the strongest. He resisted the corrosion desperately.

But his body was still in the midst of slowly dissipating.

Very soon, the third Heavenly Emperor perished!

Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn, and the rest finally kept the dissipation of their bodies in check.

But their bodies already became very illusory. The Souleater Beast’s saliva clearly caused them great injury, and they were unable to be recover to full health within a short time.

The Ghost Empyreans sucked in a cold breath!

In a blink, out of seven great Heavenly Emperors, three died and three were injured, there was still one currently struggling desperately.

This human was simply too fearsome!

But seeing this scene, the group of Ghost Empyreans also felt delighted in their hearts.

From the beginning, they were kidnapped by the seven great Heavenly Emperors, who forced them to enter and be cannon fodders.

Now, seeing them so miserable, they were naturally happy to see it happen.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s figure became fainter and fainter, and he was clearly could not hold on already.

As for Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn, his expression currently was extremely ugly.

Swoosh!

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn did not hesitate in the slightest, turning around and fleeing.

Ye Yuan laughed coldly, taking a step out, and actually reached first despite launching later, blocking Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn.

“Why? Meeting once again, haven’t even said hello properly and you want to leave already?” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s strength currently had less than 5% remaining and was weak to the extreme. He was not Ye Yuan’s match at all.

“You ... What do you want?” Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn said with a look of apprehension.

“What do I want? Huhu, don’t you have any idea what you’ve done before? Didn’t you say that my threat was very laughable? Didn’t you say that an Empyrean threatening a Heavenly Emperor is overestimating my own ability? What about now? Are Heavenly Emperors very impressive?” Ye Yuan said with a look of amusement.

Were Heavenly Emperors very impressive?

How insufferably arrogant was the Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn previously, killing people at a word of disagreement.

In his eyes, Ye Yuan and these Ghost Dao Empyreans were merely ant-like existences.

But now, Ye Yuan had full confidence when he said this sentence!

The other Heavenly Emperors were still fine, but this Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn wanted his life straight away.

Later, he also incited Heavenly Emperor Ninelives time and again.

This enmity was long formed. It was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to let him off.

“Ye Yuan, the matters previously were all this Heavenly Emperor’s fault! I apologize to you! I ... I beg you to give me a way out!” Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn was shameless and actually lowered himself and begged Ye Yuan for mercy.

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “If apologizing had a use, what do we still need cultivation for? Isn’t becoming strong is to be able to control everything as we wish?”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s expression changed, and he said in a cold voice, “Ye Yuan, do you really want to have a life and death struggle?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “Life and death struggle? With just the likes of you?”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s gaze turned intent. Gritting his teeth, Dao marks surfaced on his body.

A surge of Heavenly Dao pressure suddenly enveloped.

There was suddenly a dark ax in his hand!

Heavenly emperor spirit treasure!

He snorted coldly and said, “A starving camel is still bigger than a horse! Ye Yuan, you forced me!”

“That’s Distant Hatred Heaven Slaughter Axe, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s consummate skill!”

“Heavenly Emperor powerhouses are Heavenly Emperor powerhouses! Even when seriously injured, they are also not what Empyreans can provoke!”

“What’s Ye Yuan doing? Could it be that he already resigned himself to fate?”

... ...

The Ghost Empyreans had shocked faces, clearly being intimidated by Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s imposing aura.

Even if Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn was currently seriously wounded, the might of a Heavenly Emperor still could not be provoked.

Just based on heavenly emperor spirit treasures and Dao marks, he could still instantly kill peak Empyrean powerhouses!

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back. With a calm mind, he was watching Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn perform, seemingly not having the intention of taking action.

Just as Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s aura soared to the peak and the ax was about to land.

Ye Yuan lightly spat a word out of his mouth.

“Immobilize!”

At the same time, Ye Yuan flashed, already arriving in front of Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn, scattering Souleater Beast’s saliva.
