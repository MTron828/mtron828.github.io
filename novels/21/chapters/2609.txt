Chapter 2615: Enlightening the Benighted!

Facing Ye Yuan’s sword intent that surged to the sky, Luo Yunqing fell silent.

He knew that Ye Yuan was doing it for his own good. It was just that at this time, was he still going to fight?

Ye Yuan returned. Could he overcome the raging tides?

Luo Yunqing thought about it and felt that there was virtually no possibility.

Maybe a few thousand years later, Ye Yuan could lead the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect to rise up domineeringly.

But at present, he could not!

“Brother Luo, fight or not!”

Ye Yuan spoke for the third time, his voice akin to thunder, howling above the ninth heaven!

And his sword intent climbed to the limit.

Everyone’s countenance changed visibly.

“What a strong sword intent! I’m forced by this sword intent until I somewhat can’t open my eyes anymore!”

“His sword is God knows how many times stronger than when he killed Lu Zhanyuan back then! It’s also no wonder that he dares to challenge Luo Yunqing!”

… …

This sword intent made the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciples extremely shocked.

There was an additional hint of surprise in Luo Yunqing’s eyes.

The fighting intent in his chest was virtually surging out uncontrollably.

Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was a lot lower than him, his sword intent seemed to be able to evoke the soul, leaving him nowhere to hide.

Clank!

A sharp and sorrowful cry emitted from Luo Yunqing’s sword body.

That was the sorrowful cry of when a bird was about to die, its cries would be sorrowful too!

Onlookers might not feel it, but Luo Yunqing’s heart was practically shattering to pieces along with this sorrowful cry.

He gave a bitter laugh and said, “Forget it. I’ll fulfill your wishes and accompany you to fight another battle! Come on, old pal!”

Luo Yunqing reached his hand out and beckoned. The long sword emitted a light cry of unwillingness and flew straight into his hands.

Ye Yuan held his palm out, the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree appeared!

Luo Yunqing’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Great Dao Transformation!”

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan ignored Luo Yunqing’s astonishment and directly urged Universe, the two swords, rushing toward Luo Yunqing.

Luo Yunqing gave a light snort, fighting intent rising, as he raised his sword to meet it!

However, Luo Yunqing suppressed his cultivation realm to lower Greater Sublime Heaven.

With his pride, he naturally would not take advantage of Ye Yuan.

But as soon as they exchanged blows, he felt that something was wrong.

Too strong!

Ye Yuan’s Universe two swords were like a storm, suppressing him until he could not catch his breath.

Only then did he know just how much Ye Yuan improved in the Land of Exile!

Luo Yunqing was a one law transformation. He specialized in Sword Dao and had no other distractions.

But it was also precisely because of this that the power of Luo Yunqing’s sword was even stronger!

His transformation was none other than this sword in this hand!

This sword accompanied him to grow until this day.

Hence, his transformation was directly integrated into the sword.

Luo Yunqing was nurturing the sword with his intent!

What Ye Yuan’s sword pursued was Great Dao accommodation.

And what Luo Yunqing’s sword pursued was the limit of Sword Dao.

What the two people walked, each was a completely different Sword Dao.

Luo Yunqing’s sword was by no means inferior even if fighting ordinary three laws or four laws!

But he encountered Ye Yuan!

Coupled with that Luo Yunqing had no intention to fight at this time, he was long already no longer the Luo Yunqing in the past!

This battle made Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s people dumbfounded with shock.

No one expected that Martial Secure’s number one sword would actually be completely suppressed!

The news of Ye Yuan returning to the sect already spread throughout the sect at this time as well.

Many Jade Sovereign Heaven elders, even including Feng Xuanyi, had already quietly arrived at True Feather Peak as well.

When they saw Ye Yuan’s Great Dao Transformation, each and every one of them was shocked and speechless.

These people were all people with extremely high cultivation realms. How amazing was their eyesight?

Ye Yuan’s Great Dao Transformation already reached the limits of the first form.

This was still not the most important thing. The most important thing was that Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao simply had no weakness to exploit!

There was virtually no possibility of winning him in the same realm!

Each and every one of these elders substituted Luo Yunqing to fight with Ye Yuan.

But very soon, they all secretly shook their heads.

Because they discovered that in the same realm, they were not Ye Yuan’s match at all!

In fact, even if they suppressed their cultivation realms to middle Greater Sublime Heaven, they were completely not a match either!

Back then, when Ye Yuan slew Lu Zhanyuan, he definitely did not have such fearsome strength.

Concerning this point, many people had seen it with their own eyes.

But, after Ye Yuan made a trip to the Land of Exile, he seemed to have been reborn anew.

Now, even Luo Yunqing was not a match!

Who was Luo Yunqing?

He was the sword path’s number one person! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This guy was a sword fanatic, his heart yearned only for the Sword Dao and there was never anyone in his eyes!

Back then, when Luo Yunqing just entered Jade Sovereign Heaven, he could even overpower Shi Feiyu under the circumstances of not utilizing Great Dao Transformation.

The might of his strength could be seen!

However, in front of Ye Yuan, Luo Yunqing completely could not do it at all!

“Is this Martial Secure’s number one sword? When did Martial Secure’s number one sword become such a joke?” Each of Ye Yuan’s words cut deeply.

He knew that Luo Yunqing’s strength was definitely more than this.

The Land of Exile was indeed an excellent place to train. But being in the midst of this bottomless secular world tempered the sword heart even more.

Ye Yuan could feel Luo Yunqing’s sincere heart toward the sword.

Therefore, Ye Yuan guessed that in the same realm, Luo Yunqing’s strength definitely would not be much weaker than Han Yi!

But, Luo Yunqing’s current strength, most likely not even one-tenth of it was unleashed.

Luo Yunqing’s expression changed slightly and he said, “Brother Ye, don’t force me! No matter how strong my sword is, I can’t be stronger than the Pill Alliance too!”

Ye Yuan said angrily, “Those who practiced the sword would rather break than bend! If you break your own sword, you are lowering your head to others! Are you worthy of your sect, worthy of your own sword? If I were you, I’d kill my way up to the Pill Alliance by myself with a sword! Even if I die, I also wouldn’t allow the enemy to humiliate me!”

“Insolence!”

In the crowd, Shi Feiyu said in a great rage, “Luo Yunqing admitting his fault is showing consideration for the sect’s overall situation! Wouldn’t killing his way up to the Pill Alliance cause the Pill Alliance to retaliate even more strongly? A traitor like you, deluding people with fallacies, just what are your intentions?!”

Ye Yuan had a proud look as he said loudly, “In the past, us ascenders have no place that we belonged to and no territory! We relied on an unyielding heart and forcibly carved out this foundation! The four great heavenly regions united to encircle and suppress ascenders. Zhuo Bufan led our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect to kill the enemy bravely. When had we lowered our heads to the enemy to admit our fault before? Now, the foundation is achieved. Have we lost our guts? If our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect lowers our head today, it will never be able to raise its head! Old fogey, you’re deluding people with fallacies here, humiliating the sect and forfeiting its sovereign rights! You’re the treacherous one!”

Ye Yuan’s voice was akin to a great bell, each word enlightening the benighted, making many sect upper echelons feel extremely ashamed.

And Luo Yunqing’s eyes were also regaining clarity bit by bit.

“You!”

Shi Feiyu was angered until his entire body was trembling, going crazy.

But Ye Yuan did not give him the chance and continued, “Old fogey, you beguiled the sect master to offer up my disciple. Once this precedent is made, I want to ask, what face does Sect Master still have to go and meet our ancestors? In the future, if the Pill Alliance wants our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s cultivation method and secret skill books, should we offer it up on a silver platter too? Or if they want your dog head?”

Ye Yuan suddenly turned around, looked at Luo Yunqing, and said, “Today, you, Luo Yunqing, break your sword! In the future, the Pill Alliance can exterminate the sect! Weighing what’s more important, you judge it for yourself! If you’ve set your mind on breaking your sword, it’s better to die under this Ye’s sword! There will naturally be this Ye to bear the responsibility for the Pill Alliance’s matter alone!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan swung his sword and advanced, heading straight for Luo Yunqing!

This sword move, Ye Yuan did not hold back in the slightest!

Clank!

Ye Yuan’s figure was repelled back, but Luo Yunqing’s eyes had completely regained clarity!

“Brother Ye, many thanks! This Luo knows what to do now!”
