Chapter 2860 I Feel … Somewhat Bloated!

Below the life-and-death stage, there were streams of people.

Originally, this battle was just between Luo Hao and Yang Qing two people. It would not have attracted too much attention.

But, because of Ye Yuan, the influence of this battle became huge.

Even Yang Qing himself admitted that he could not last a single exchange with Luo Hao.

Then could Ye Yuan defy the heavens?

“Incredible! It seems like in the sect, there’s no one who can refine the Infinite Comprehensive Pill at all! Is that Ye Yuan going to defy the heavens?” “What a joke. He’s the youngest profound grade powerhouse in history! How can a mere Infinite Comprehensive Pill stump him?” “Heh heh, this brat really talks big!”

… …

A series of mocking voices came from below the stage.

The corners of Luo Hao’s mouth could not help curling slightly when he heard these discussion voices.

Why was the Infinite Comprehensive Pill called the hardest in history?

It was because it was an extremely rare all-attributes heavenly pill!

What was called an all-attributes heavenly pill?

After consuming it, one’s strength would skyrocket in all aspects!

Divine essence, Great Dao rule, the power of rules, origin divinity, physical body, so on and so forth, these aspects would all have an all-round improvement! This kind of heavenly pill sounded fantastical, even somewhat frightening. Of course, because it had such a heaven-defying medicinal effect, its refining difficulty was also the hardest among same rank heavenly pills!

The difficulty was hell level! How difficult was it?

A grade eight heavenly alchemist like Qin Shan could not refine a profound grade Infinite Comprehensive Pill too. He could refine true grade, but the medicine effect of true grade was basically only a little better than nothing to True Sovereign Heavens. The difficulty was high, but the medicinal effect was ordinary.

Only by reaching profound grade could it truly have a heaven-grade effect.

Hence, in the Extreme Medicine Sect, there wasn’t such a heavenly pill at all.

It was not that nobody could refine it, but exalted Hegemon Realms would not run over to refine a grade five heavenly imperial pill for you, right? Furthermore, the heavenly medicines that the Infinite Comprehensive Pill needed were extremely precious too. They were even more valuable than some grade six heavenly medicines!

This was because they were too rare.

It was also that this was a super sect like the Extreme Medicine Sect. For ordinary sects, they would not be able to even collect the heavenly medicines.

Therefore, when they knew that Ye Yuan was going to refine the Infinite Comprehensive Pill, the entire sect scoffed with derision.

Two days ago, Ye Yuan slapped the faces of everyone in the sect.

Today, everyone came to watch Ye Yuan become a joke!

Below the stage, Yang Qing appeared somewhat anxious.

The life-and-death battle was about to begin right away, but Ye Yuan still had not come.

“What are you looking at, Yang Qing? You wouldn’t really think that Ye Yuan can bring the Infinite Comprehensive Pill and come help you change your fate, right?” Luo Hao arrived before Yang Qing and said with a snicker. Yang Qing said with a cold snort, “Mind your own business!”

Luo Hao’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Yang Qing, just you show off! After getting on the life-and-death stage, you’ll know what’s called despair! You killed my younger brother. I’m going to sentence you to eternal damnation!”

Yang Qing’s mouth curled, and he said disdainfully, “Your younger brother colluded with the blood race and butchered his own species, committing countless crimes and misdeeds. Landing in my hands, I couldn’t let him live! Even if we do this again, Your Father will still kill him without fail!”

When he was carrying out missions, he accidentally discovered that Luo Hao’s younger brother was cultivating with human blood, his methods being extremely cruel.

The ordinary martial artists who died at his hands were beyond count.

Yang Qing was normally casual, but with regards to this sort of thing, he really would not be careless.

Hence, he killed Luo Hao’s younger brother.

Who knew that this person was actually Luo Hao’s younger brother!

Before his younger brother died, he sent Yang Qing’s information to Luo Hao.

In the end, the two people sowed irreconcilable enmity.

Before Luo Hao’s younger brother died, he did things cleanly. Yang Qing did not bring back any evidence.

With regards to Yang Qing killing someone from the same sect, as long as it was outside the Extreme Medicine Sect, there wasn’t this restriction.

This way, the two people each stuck to their own versions and could only use a life-and-death battle to resolve it.

When Luo Hao challenged him, Yang Qing was not a cowardly person either, directly accepting

it.

Although he clearly knew that he was not a match.

Luo Hao gave Yang Qing a glance and said coolly, “Keep framing charges! Very soon, you won’t be able to talk anymore!”

Time slowly trickled by. Ye Yuan still did not have the intention of showing up.

Luo Hao leaped onto the life-and-death stage and shouted, “Yang Qing, the hour has come. Why haven’t you come up in haste to prepare to die?”

Yang Qing’s mouth curled, and he said, “There’s still 15 minutes. What are you anxious about!”

“Haha, Yang Qing, stop struggling! Ye Yuan boasted too much. He absolutely won’t dare to come!” Zheng Qian said with a loud laugh.

In reality, that was what everyone thought.

The hardest in history was not said for fun!

To profound grade powerhouses, this was a hell-level difficulty too!

“Yang Qing, give up hope! If Ye Yuan dares to come, Your Father will pluck my head off for you to kick like a ball!” Wang Lin also said with a cold smile.

Yang Qing gave him a glance and said coolly, “Grandpa Qing has remembered what you said!”

While he said so, Yang Qing’s heart was also a little nervous.

Time was almost up. Ye Yuan did not even show a hint of a shadow!

“Son of a bitch, hurry up and come! If you don’t come, Your Father is going to die!” Yang Qing cursed wildly in his heart. Luo Hao smiled coldly and said, “Delaying the time can’t change the final outcome! Forget it that he doesn’t dare to come. Even if he really refines the Infinite Comprehensive Pill, you’ll definitely die today beyond doubt too!”

As he said, he arrived in front of the judge and said with clasped hands, “Martial Uncle, the time has come!”

That Emperor Realm powerhouse nodded slightly and said to Yang Qing, “The time is up. Yang Qing, take the stage!”

Yang Qing’s face turned black. This punk really stood him up?

F*** me!

However, he also knew that he could not drag the time anymore.

Helpless, he could only leap onto the stage!

“Catch!”

Just as he was dangling in the air, a streak of flowing light flashed and flew straight over.

Yang Qing was overjoyed, swiping a vial with a grab and landing on the stage.

Without the slightest hesitation, Yang Qing immediately opened up the vial and downed it in one gulp. Everyone did not have time to determine whether or not that was the Infinite Comprehensive Pill. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

And only at this time did Ye Yuan’s figure slowly appear.

The whole audience was in an uproar!

This guy really came?

That thing just now was the Infinite Comprehensive Pill?

This guy would not have randomly gotten some heavenly pill to posture, right?

Luo Hao’s expression changed, and he said to the judge, “The time is up. Martial Uncle, please announce the immediate commencement!”

The judge nodded and said, “Getting on the life-and-death stage, life and death are your own responsibility! Begin!” Luo Hao did not feel that Ye Yuan could really refine a profound grade Infinite Comprehensive Pill, but he would not give Yang Qing the chance to refine the heavenly pill!

This was the life-and-death stage. It was no laughing matter!

Whether or not it was, it would not be too late to verify after Yang Qing died! “HAH!”

Luo Hao slashed a saber over, immediately stirring up the wind and clouds!

Three power of rules were immediately performed by him to the extreme!

He was a genius!

The moment this saber came out, forget about Yang Qing; even his senior and junior brothers, who were similarly half-step Emperor Realm, absolutely could not block it too!

One saber and they would be met with a violent death! But, when he saw that playful look in Yang Qing’s eyes, his expression could not help changing wildly!

Over here, Yang Qing’s entire body instantly ruptured when the medicinal pill entered his abdomen!

He only felt as if his soul was about to ascend!

That liberating feeling made him unable to hold back a groan.

Too wonderful!

In virtually an instant, he felt as if his strength was like a rising tide. It was rising sharply and crazily!

“I feel … somewhat bloated!”
