1387 He Flew Over!

“Sure enough, it’s here again!”

Seeing Ye Yuan pull the sword on the light screen, Zhao Qin revealed a look that said it was as expected.

While those students on the Sword Tomb’s second level were all struck senseless at this time.

“What’s going on? Why did those Sword Dao laws all cease activities?”

“Is there a mistake? Could it be that the Sword Tomb’s second level broke?”

“Come on, when I was cultivating to the critical point, it was suddenly gone. Don’t play like this!”

...

Those violent Sword Dao laws in the Sword Tomb’s second level became incomparably docile at this time.

The students currently cultivating lost their opponents all of a sudden. This put them at a loss.

Zhao Qin’s expression turned fearful, hastily rushing into the Sword Tomb’s second level like an arrow.

“The second level’s students listen up! Hurry up and evacuate! Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself!” Zhao Qin shouted at the top of his voice.

The last time, Teacher Fan went into and witnessed the might of ten thousand swords launching in unison.

This second level’s power would only be more terrifying.

Once these students set off these swords, the consequences would be too ghastly to imagine.

Those second level’s students were mostly outer-court disciples.

Hearing Zhao Qin’s yell, they did not dare to dawdle, hurriedly withdrawing out.

“What’s wrong, Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao? What in the world happened?”

After the group of students withdrew out, they immediately surrounded Zhao Qin.

Zhao Qin’s face fell, and he said in a cold voice, “Don’t ask so much! Today, this second level is closed! Everyone is forbidden from entering inside, I’ll go and invite Teacher Fan right away!”

Teacher Fan rushed over once more after getting the news. Zhao Qin asked, “Teacher Fan, how ... to handle this?”

Teacher Fan was already not as shocked as the first time. He could ascertain that Ye Yuan comprehended something in the Sword Tomb.

Teacher Fan thought about it and said, “Forget it, let him be! Seal off the second level for the time being. Others are not to enter. After Ye Yuan comes out, then let people go in.”

“Yes, Teacher Fan!”

No one would have expected that this closure was a year plus!

“Qin Shao broke through! He passed the fourth level”

“My God, this Qin Shao’s cultivation speed is also too terrifying. This rate of progress doesn’t pale in comparison to the Qin Tian back then in the least!”

“Qin Shao’s talent is still quite a bit worse than Qin Tian’s. But his three years of hard work goes even further beyond than Qin Tian.”

...

Right on the eve of the three years agreement, Qin Shao, who had always been risking his life and cultivating, finally cleared the Sword Tomb’s fourth level!

The fourth level was a dividing chasm, because the fifth level’s Sword Dao laws were all Sword Dao second-layered heaven, which was also the power of laws corresponding to Heaven Glimpse Realm.

Qin Shao making it past the fourth level indicated that his Sword Dao laws already completely surpassed Sword Dao first-layered heaven!

With his grand completion Grotto Profound Realm plus the power of laws of grand completion Sword Dao first-layered heaven, saying that he swept across those in the same rank was not in the least an exaggeration.

So when Qin Shao walked out of the Sword Tomb, a stir aroused once more.

“Qin Shao he ... is already half-step Heaven Glimpse! This ... What’s there to compete still?”

“Yeah, this life and death battle, Ye Yuan will die without a doubt!”

“Qin Shao is well-deserving of being this season’s top dog. Just five years’ time and he already touched the threshold of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm!”

The disparity between each major realm of Divine Dao was too great. For martial artists to want to cross in one step, it was as hard as ascending to heaven.

Once grand completion realm martial artists produced a trace of enlightenment, it would make the realm loosen up once more, the divine sea expand again, reaching half-step Heaven Glimpse Realm from there.

Of course, there were also people who borrowed this trace of enlightenment to ascend to the heavens in one step, directly breaking through a major realm.

But these people were rare.

In these three years, Qin Shao bitterly cultivated Sword Dao and finally produced a trace of understanding, striding out this crucial step.

...

The three years agreement was arriving in a flash. On this day, Wu Meng Academy’s martial arena was booming with popularity.

On the corridors of the grandstand, it was packed full of people, virtually tightly packed until not even water could seep through.

These two people were the most eye-catching two people among the new season’s students.

One was a peerless genius personally conferred the Golden Sword Token by City Lord, His Excellency, becoming an in-name disciple.

While the other was the man of the hour who slew the Qin Family’s lineal descent daughter and could still be safe and sound.

Qin Shao’s might, everyone was clear.

But up till now, no one had seen Ye Yuan make a move before yet.

How his strength was, nobody knew.

“Who do you guys think will live or die in this fight?”

“Is there still a need to say? Qin Shao’s strength is top-notch among peers to begin with. These three years, his strength improved greatly again. This battle, Ye Yuan is dead for sure.”

“But Ye Yuan isn’t a fool either. Since he agreed, could it be that he has confidence?”

“Heh, what confidence can there be? I feel that he’s too confident, thinking that he can defy the heavens. I heard that he still hasn’t broken through to late-stage Grotto Profound yet. But Qin Shao is already half-step Heaven Glimpse. Could it be that there’s still any suspense to this fight?”

...

Many people were all guessing the outcome of this life and death battle. But the vast majority of the people were pessimistic about Ye Yuan.

Quite a number of people all went to the Sword Tomb’s second level to take a look before, Ye Yuan’s realm still stopped at middle-stage Grotto Profound.

Even if Ye Yuan’s trump card was any more heaven-defying, it was also impossible for a middle-stage Grotto Profound to defeat the half-step Heaven Glimpse Qin Shao!

Let alone that Qin Shao’s Sword Dao laws were already grand completion first-layered heaven! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this time, several figures slowly walked out on the grandstand. One look and everyone knew they were extremely powerful people.

“It’s the Qin Family’s Family Head, Qin Nantian! Didn’t expect that he actually came in person!”

“Heh, Ye Yuan killed his daughter, he’s here to personally watch Ye Yuan be killed!”

But to Qin Nantian’s side was the Chi Fang whom he had exchanged blows before.

Several Origin Deity Realm teachers in the academy all appeared on the grandstand.

“Chi Fang, you’re also here to watch how Ye Yuan dies?” When Qin Nantian saw Chi Fang, he could not resist poking fun.

Chi Fang laughed when he heard that and said, “Qin Shao is really confident! How do you know that the one who dies isn’t Qin Shao?”

Qin Nantian laughed loudly and said, “Within Grotto Profound Realm, is there still someone capable of winning Qin Shao? If I believe this, do you, Chi Fang, believe it?”

Chi Fang gave a cold snort and stopped talking.

He very much wanted to say he did not believe it, but he really could not say it.

Chi Fang was really unable to understand why Ye Yuan would agree to such an unfair life and death battle.

Could it be that this brat was really tired of living?

He already confirmed that Ye Yuan did not break through to late-stage Grotto Profound.

This battle had no suspense at all!

Qin Nantian smiled coldly and said, “The hour is almost arriving. That punk keeps failing to show up. I’m afraid ... he fled in the face of danger, right? Elder Tong, you’re this match’s judge, you’ll have to judge him as losing! Your Law Enforcement Hall shouldn’t be biased, right?”

Elder Tong’s name was Tong Shou. He was one of the key people at the Law Enforcement Hall.

This life and death battle today was managed by him.

According to the rules, once the hour had arrived and one party of the life and death battle did not arrive, it was regarded as automatically admitting defeat.

Their Law Enforcement Hall must carry out the death penalty on the losing party!

Tong Shou looked at the time and said, “There are still 7 and a half minutes. If Ye Yuan still doesn’t come, it will be regarded as automatically admitting defeat!”

Right at this time, a wave of commotion occurred in the crowd.

“Look, what’s that? My God, Ye Yuan he ... he actually flew over! My ... My eyes are failing, right?”
