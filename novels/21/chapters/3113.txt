Chapter 3112: Invincible in the World!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This … How was this possible?”

“Are my eyes failing? Those two major powers are already invincible in the 33 Heavens, and yet they were actually pressured into kneeling by Progenitor Bloodstone’s words?”

“What kind of realm did Progenitor Bloodstone reach?”

… . .

Countless shocked gazes closed in on Progenitor Bloodstone.

!!

This scene was seriously too soul-stirring.

For countless years, the 33 Heavens had been in a delicate equilibrium.

All the way until Ancestor Heavenless came soaring into existence, breaking this balance.

But Ancestor Heavenless was not invincible. He had Progenitor Samsara as his opponent!

In reality, although the Ancestor Heavenless back then was formidable, he was far from being invincible.

All the way until today, he molded a chaos physical body, reappearing before everyone’s eyes.

This Ancestor Heavenless was invincible!

But this invincible Ancestor Heavenless appeared so weak at this time!

Heavenless looked at Progenitor Bloodstone with a horrified look and said in shock, “H-Have you really taken the final step? This is impossible!”

The sinister and charming youth smiled lightly and said, “The blood race launched the all-heavens war, slaughtering living things from all races, collecting 99 Blood Ward Beads! These 99 Blood Ward Beads contain all the profundities of the Great Dao of Blood! This Dao fused with these 99 Blood Ward Beads with a body of chaos and finally pushed open the Door of Eternal Life! And the Door of Eternal Life’s reward to this Dao is the Great Dao of Blood! Henceforth, this Dao will be the sole ruler of the 33 Heavens! Do you have objections?”

Heavenless’ expression choked, immediately feeling an extremely strong sense of oppression hitting him head-on.

This kind of oppressive feeling, other than when he just entered the Labyrinth Divine Palace and felt it in front of his master, he never felt it again.

But now, he felt it once more!

Progenitor Bloodstone’s strength gave him a sense of powerlessness!

“Impossible! This ancestor transformed into hundreds of millions, comprehending samsara in all the heavens and myriad worlds, but I couldn’t take this step from beginning to end! What right do you have?!” Progenitor Samsara said angrily.

The sinister and charming youth smiled and said, “If it was before, this Dao really wouldn’t have been able to answer you. But now, this Dao can tell you. Samsara Great Dao is a profound mystery that you can’t probe into! So right from the beginning, your Dao was wrong!”

Progenitor Samsara’s expression changed wildly. It was as if there was a sledgehammer that smashed onto his chest.

Progenitor Bloodstone’s words simply cut deep into the heart!

He spent his whole life in pursuit of the Dao of Samsara.

In the end, it was actually all for naught?

“No! This is impossible! How can my Dao be wrong? You’re bluffing me! You must be lying to me!” Progenitor Samsara bellowed.

The sinister and charming youth was indifferent. He just smiled lightly and said, “The Dao of Samsara controls all life! Life and death samsara is predetermined by heaven! The Dao of Samsara is too vast. It’s not what you can control! If you grasp the Dao of Samsara, then what do we still need Heavenly Dao for? Even if you transcend Great Beyond, it’s impossible to surpass Heavenly Dao too!”

Talking until the back, Progenitor Bloodstone was actually somewhat melancholic.

Having taken this step, he was already invincible in the 33 Heavens.

But he was just the spokesperson for Heavenly Dao. That was all.

Hegemon was the supremacy that dominated all life!

No one could surpass Heavenly Dao!

Samsara’s expression became paler and paler.

It was because he understood that Bloodstone’s words were not without reason.

Life and death samsara, this Dao was too vast!

He could not withstand it!

“Alright, enough crap! From now on, the two of you are my dogs. Is there any objection? Don’t use this kind of eyes to look at this Dao. There’s only one chance. Think carefully before answering!” Progenitor Bloodstone said it casually.

Samsara two people’s expressions turned somber, their faces revealing a look of unwillingness.

But refusal was tantamount to death!

There was no question about this.

“I’m … willing!” Heavenless suddenly lowered his head and kowtowed toward Progenitor Bloodstone as he said.

Progenitor Bloodstone smiled evilly and charmingly, looking at Samsara again as he said, “What about you?”

Progenitor Samsara’s expression changed over and over again. Finally, he still lowered his head and resigned himself to fate. “I’m willing!”

Progenitor Bloodstone nodded with satisfaction and said, “Do you know why this Dao stopped you guys?”

Samsara said respectfully, “Only you can kill Ye Yuan!”

Bloodstone smiled sinisterly and charmingly. Turning to look at Mi Tian, he said, “Are you all inviting Ye Yuan out? Or are you going to make this Dao do it myself? From now on, you all are this Dao’s subjects. This Dao doesn’t want to go on a killing spree.”

From start to finish, Progenitor Bloodstone did not look angry at all.

It was as if everything in this world could no longer move him.

Him coming to take revenge was also merely just taking revenge. That was all.

With just one glance, Mi Tian felt infinite pressure.

That kind of pressure was as if there were 33 layers of heaven crushing down.

The fear in Mi Tian’s heart could not be obstructed at all. That was fear that came from the soul!

It was not just him. Everyone in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven felt this fear, no matter how strong or weak they were. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Only after a long time did Mi Tian barely manage to straighten out his breathing. He said in a solemn voice, “Die in glory rather than live on in dishonor! Want to meet Ye Yuan, do it yourself!”

Progenitor Bloodstone nodded slightly and said, “Okay, understood!”

Puu, puu, puu, puu …

Suddenly, the bodies of the powerhouses in the world exploded one after another, blood mist scattering!

Virtually in an instant, blood dyed the sky!

But from beginning to end, Progenitor Bloodstone never even moved a finger.

When Mi Tian and the rest saw this scene, the muscles on their faces were twitching.

They originally thought that Progenitor Bloodstone would be the same as Heavenless two people, forcefully breaking down the boundary.

But who knew that he did not even need to move and slaughtered tens of thousands of powerhouses!

The current Progenitor Bloodstone was truly too terrifying!

Progenitor Bloodstone said, “This progenitor has controlled the Great Dao of Blood. All flesh and blood bodies are within this Dao’s control! Want you to live, you’ll live! Want you to die, you’ll die! Killing you all is just a matter of a thought! Since you all are seeking death, I’ll let you all seek virtue and acquire it; get your heart’s desire! Hur hur, your current desperate expressions, this Dao likes it very much!”

Progenitor Bloodstone was full of unhappiness towards Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Even if he was presently already invincible in all worlds, he was still unhappy!

“STOP!”

Right at this time, a figure directly flew out of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

When Mi Tian saw this figure, his expression could not help changing wildly.

Ye Yuan!

At this time, Ye Yuan actually exited his seclusion!

Furthermore, this guy actually flew outside of the boundary. This was courting death!

It was merely a matter of a thought for Progenitor Bloodstone to kill him!

“Ye Yuan, come back!” Mi Tian roared.

Ye Yuan did not turn back. He just waved his hand and flew straight in front of Progenitor Bloodstone and said coolly, “I’m here. Stop this!”

Progenitor Bloodstone smiled evilly and charmingly and said, “You finally came out!”

Ye Yuan’s expression was cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “You’ll pay the price for what you did earlier!”

Progenitor Bloodstone smiled and said, “Oh? What price?”

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Your life!”

“Insolence! Who the hell do you think you are to dare speak to Progenitor like this? Our Progenitor is already invincible under the heavens!” Yi Xue immediately reprimanded.

Bloodstone just smiled and waved his hand at him. Yi Xue’s expression turned fearful. He immediately became silent, cold sweat pouring profusely.

The present Progenitor Bloodstone no longer needed to posture.

He was truly invincible!
