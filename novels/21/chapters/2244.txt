Chapter 2248: Sword Energy Healing Wounds!

Countless birds and beasts turned to ashes under the dreadful attacks.

Far away, there was pandemonium.

The fierce beasts were clearly frightened until they wet themselves, all fleeing like they went crazy.

The gray-robed man frowned slightly. Spreading out his divine sense, he swept over every inch of earth.

Deva Realm powerhouse, how powerful was his divine sense?

Even if it was a tiny worm, it could forget about escaping his probing too.

He slowly flew forward, divine sense like radar, scanning over whole stretches, not leaving out a trace.

In the array formation, Ye Yuan even held his breathing, not daring to let out the slightest trace of movement.

Fortunately, the Limitless God Killing Bow’s aura was already mostly sealed by this person. Otherwise, even if he had the ability to connect to the heavens, he could not hide its aura too.

Feeling the earth quaked and mountains swayed, Ye Yuan felt slightly surprised in his heart.

The strike of a Deva Realm powerhouse was too terrifying!

His teleport was probably several hundreds of thousands of miles, but he could still feel the other party’s attack.

Very soon, an extremely strong aura came close from afar.

Ye Yuan’s heart pounded heavily. He did not know whether or not his array formation could hide from a Deva Realm’s probing.

His array formation already glimpsed right at the source, his attainments exceedingly high.

Even if a Heavenly Emperor came, he did not fear either.

But, Deva Realm, this realm, was completely unknown to him.

A peerlessly tyrannical divine sense swept across the land. Ye Yuan’s heart leaped to his throat.

Fortunately, when this divine sense swept past, it did not discover his existence, flying over into the distance.

Ye Yuan’s heart finally landed back in place.

However, Ye Yuan did not dare to lower his guard and did not pull back the array formation immediately.

Sure enough, another powerful divine sense descended once more, sweeping across.

Only then did Ye Yuan discover that there were two Deva Realm powerhouses searching for this man in white.

The following three days, these two people took turns to search in this vicinity, over and over again.

Only all the way until three days later did the two people’s probing disappear.

Ye Yuan was very careful, hiding an entire day in the array formation before coming out.

After coming out, Ye Yuan did not dare to stay, bringing that man and directly teleporting away.

No idea how far they ran either, only when Ye Yuan felt that it was safe did he find a quiet place to land.

He thought about it, arriving outside a cave with a teleport. He then fired out one restriction after another above the void.

These restrictions were without form or substance but formed an enormous web within a radius of ten thousand miles.

These restrictions did not have the effect of harming, but as long as someone touched the restrictions, he would immediately know.

Deva Realm powerhouses, their strength was too terrifying. Ye Yuan did not wish to die with no clear reason whatsoever.

Only after bustling around for the greater part of the day did he return to the cave.

Wild Blade’s expression was ugly as he said, “Young Master, wouldn’t directly killing this person and taking this Limitless God Killing Bow do? It’s very dangerous for us like this! Those two Deva Realm powerhouses definitely won’t be willing to drop the matter!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I have no grudge or enmity with him. Murdering people and snatching treasure this sort of thing, I can’t do it.”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade had an expression like he saw a ghost. Clearly, he was unable to understand Ye Yuan’s actions.

In his impression, Ye Yuan was not a benevolent and softhearted person.

In the Asura Blood Sea, those few Heavenly Emperors who provoked Ye Yuan were all directly finished off by him.

Why was he showing petty kindness now?

Ye Yuan knew what Wild Blade was thinking and said coolly, “For real men, some things are necessary, while other things absolutely mustn’t be done! When you follow me for a long time, you’ll understand. Alright, you go outside and guard, I’ll treat his wounds for him!”

Wild Blade was helpless and could only guard outside the cave.

Ye Yuan looked at the man in white clothing and said coolly, “Stop pretending, these words weren’t said for you to hear.”

It turned out that this man in white had long already woken up, but he was pretending to be unconscious.

It was just that how could he hide from Ye Yuan like this?

The man in white slowly opened his eyes, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of vigilance.

His hands gripped the Limitless God Killing Bow a little tighter.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “To dare snatch away the Limitless God Killing Bow from the hands of Deva Realms, I have to admire your courage! But even if you snatch it, you also don’t have the life to use it.”

Hearing Ye Yuan say so, the expression of the man in white could not help turning dim as he said with a sigh, “I’m about to ... transcend the first blight tribulation right away. <y ... accumulations aren’t enough. W-Without the destiny to suppress, I’ll die without a doubt! W-Why not take the chance then?!”

The man’s injuries were extremely severe. Saying these words made the expression on his face extremely contorted, his complexion also became a little paler.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth twitched slightly. It seemed like the terrors of Deva blight tribulations were still above his imaginations.

This man in white was a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor but did not even dare to cross the blight tribulation.

Ye Yuan did not get long-winded. Carefully inspecting his injuries, he was secretly shocked in his heart.

This person’s injuries were extremely severe. Extremely terrifying Dao accumulations were retained within his body, wrecking his bodily functions continuously.

Furthermore, even his small world was punched through. His situation rather similar to Ye Yuan’s back then.

It seemed like he unleashed all of his methods in order to escape.

However, this person did not have Ye Yuan’s formidable fleshly body and life force.

At most half a month, he would die without a doubt!

Furthermore, through this person’s injuries, Ye Yuan could also distinctly feel how strong a Deva Realm’s strength was!

When his divine essence entered the white-clothing man’s body and came into contact with those remnant Dao accumulations, it was like encountering a terrible monster, directly being washed away.

That tyrannicalness was seemingly like facing Heavenly Dao.

Ye Yuan also expended a Herculean effort before figuring out the situation within his body.

After he was done inspecting, Ye Yuan said coolly, “There is no hope.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The white-clothed man’s expression turned dim and he said with a nod, “I know! Unless the Medicine Ancestor is here, otherwise ... I’ll die without a doubt. After I die, you ... take away the Limitless God Killing Bow then!”

His own body, he naturally knew himself. There was simply no way of remedying the situation.

Forget that Ye Yuan was just a measly little Eight-star, even if he was an Eight-star Alchemy God, he could not treat the injuries left behind by a Deva Realm too.

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said disdainfully, “If the Medicine Ancestor was here, do you think that he’ll save you?”

The white-clothed man smiled miserably and said, “The Medicine Ancestor ... is aloof from the masses. Why would he pay attention to the life and death of an ant like me?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “At least you have a bit of understanding of yourself! Relax, with me around, you won’t die! However, I’m temporarily unable to help you restore your cultivation. You’re currently ... just a cripple.”

The white-clothed man’s gaze turned intent, immediately smiling bitterly and said, “This Heavenly Emperor is merely someone who’s about to die. You don’t have to console me anymore.”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to waste his breath with him. Forming his fingers as a sword, a tiny pale-yellow long needle appeared at Ye Yuan’s fingertips.

This long needle was actually condensed with sword energy!

Ye Yuan moved like lightning, pricking the sword-needle onto the major acupoints all over the body of the man in white.

The white-clothed man gave a muffled groan, only feeling one stream of sword energy after another being sent into his body, wandering within his body.

At this moment, he hurt until he could not speak, but he was shocked to the extreme in his heart.

Sword Dao source!

This guy was just Empyrean Realm, but he actually comprehended Sword Dao source!

What was even scarier was that this guy actually treated sword energy as a golden needle to stab the acupoints!

What kind of terrifying control power did this require?

Just who ... in the world was this boy?

Ye Yuan’s fingers pointed, guiding the sword energy to wander within the white-clothed man’s body.

It was only to see him guide with his sword finger. A powerful force flew out of the wounds.
