1583 Trample Flat for Me

Song Qiyang landed face to the ground and slid more than a hundred feet away from his original spot before stopping.

This throw was hurled beautifully.

Everyone was dumbfounded, looking at the Song Qiyang who was thrown in a wretched manner, thinking that their eyesight was failing.

Song Qiyang was a half-step Divine Lord. He actually could not even retaliate and was directly thrown flying by Ye Yuan?

“Ouch! You ... You dare to throw me?” Song Qiyang gave a painful cry and yelled.

In this inner city, even ordinary elders and deacons also did not dare to treat him like this!

Disregarding that this kid was swindling others with false ability, Ye Yuan actually even dared to throw him like this?

Most importantly, he was completely unprepared just now, that was why Ye Yuan’s sneak attack succeeded.

If it came to the real thing, he was absolutely not afraid of Ye Yuan!

But the problem was, he already lost all face in front of a group of juniors.

Ye Yuan’s gaze looked toward Lin Dong rather coldly, and the latter felt a chill in his heart. A powerful pressure instantly pierced his heart!

Lin Dong felt that it was very inconceivable. An Origin Deity Realm actually brought such a powerful sense of oppression to him.

This kind of feeling was extremely absurd.

Was it because of his identity as an elder?

Lin Dong did not know, but he knew that Elder Ye was unhappy with him already.

He did not carry out Elder Ye’s order staunchly.

But earlier, Ye Yuan did not even dare to accept Song Qiyang’s challenge. Did he really have the strength to become an elder?

Lin Dong could not help hesitating in his heart.

If he were to take action today, it would be offending Head Elder badly.

Dealing with Qin Xiao that kind of weakling, he naturally did not care.

But Head Elder, what kind of high-ranking figure was that?

“Get lost!”

Ye Yuan’s voice was akin to thunder, suppressing everyone all at once, and they actually unconsciously divided and opened up a path.

Ye Yuan brought Li-er and the rest and slowly walked over from the middle.

Only when Ye Manor’s front door closed did they abruptly startle awake.

“Why did I move aside just now?”

“This ... This isn’t right! My strength is stronger than him, why would I be scared of him?”

Everyone was working it out one after another in their hearts. They all could not understand why they would be scared by Ye Yuan.

Lin Dong stood there very awkwardly. He knew that Ye Yuan not bringing him along indicated that Ye Yuan was already very unhappy with him.

Giving a bitter laugh, Lin Dong turned around and left.

When mighty gods clashed, little ghosts suffered.

Lin Dong had never thought that he would become a ‘little ghost’ in front of an Origin Deity Realm one day.

“Senior Apprentice Brother Song, what ... what should we do now?” someone asked Song Qiyang softly.

Song Qiyang roared, “Go back! What else can we do? Do you want to barge into an elder’s residence without any authorization? That is a serious crime!”

Song Qiyang looked at Ye Manor’s front door and said hatefully, “There’s still a few days to the Pill Tower’s competition. I’ll see when he can be cocky until! When the time comes, I’ll make him reveal his true colors! Humph!”

...

The Ye Manor was a mansion that the Pill Tower prepared for Ye Yuan. It occupied an extremely large area in the inner city.

The elders’ allotments were top-notch in the inner city.

“Hehe, Master Ye, you were really too cool just now! Song Qiyang that guy, his eyes are at the top of his head. I’ve long found him an eyesore,” the moment they entered, Ning Siyu said with a desire to see the world plunged into chaos.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “They went against their superior. For me to not punish their crimes, it’s already being very nice to them.”

Ning Siyu scoffed and said with a smile, “Then do you know who that person you threw just now was?”

From start to end, Ye Yuan did not recognize Song Qiyang and also did not know what background he had.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “He’s the head elder’s people, right? Furthermore, looking at his appearance, his status isn’t low.”

Ning Siyu opened her mouth wide and said in surprise, “How did you know?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I guessed it!”

Ning Siyu gave a thumbs up and praised, “Indeed worthy of being Master Ye! Since you already guessed it, you actually still dared to make him lose face in front of so many juniors?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “It’s because of your master’s strong recommendation that I could become an elder. Do you think that if I were friendly to him, their group of people would let me off?”

Ning Siyu could not help choking and said, “Makes sense! But if I were to say, you should have agreed to him earlier and teach him a good lesson! Let him know what’s called there’s always someone better! Additionally, you can also demonstrate your strength, this newly-appointed elder.”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Most likely, Lin Dong thinks so as well! However ... what qualifications does he have to make me go take action and teach him a lesson? Winning against him, I don’t get anything. If lose ... uh ... that’s impossible.”

“Pffft”

The few people around were tickled by Ye Yuan.

Yeah, how could Ye Yuan possibly lose to Song Qiyang?

But laughing for a while, Ning Siyu said, “But if like this, outsiders will say even more stuff than your strength being inadequate to take on the position of elder. Most likely, Head Elder will take this chance to take action!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Even if I need to take action, that’s also not me taking action. In the Pill Tower’s competition, you have to viciously slap that punk for me!”

Ning Siyu got a fright and hurriedly waved her hand and said, “I can’t, I can’t! You aren’t aware of this just because Song Qiyang isn’t anything in your eyes. But in my eyes, that’s a mighty divinity-like existence. In the realm of Three-star Alchemy God, he’s practically undefeatable!”

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said disdainfully, “Undefeatable? Hur hur, who dares to say that they are undefeatable in this world? Even the Medicine Ancestor, that kind of existence, even if he has no precedents, who can guarantee that there wouldn’t be anyone who can repeat it? After breaking through to the Dao Realm, I feel my own insignificance even more. What does he count as?”

Ning Siyu was speechless and said, “Talk is cheap for you! Reaching your realm, of course you can say whatever you want. But I’m really not his match.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Relax, starting from today, I’ll give you special training for ten days! After ten days, you have to trample that Song Qiyang’s face flat for me!”

...

“Mn? Lin Dong, didn’t I arrange for you to go be Elder Ye’s follower? Why did you come back?”

After Lin Dong left, he went all the way back to the Martial Tower.

He ruminated along the way and did not notice that there was someone. Lifting his head to take a look, it was precisely the Deacon Feng Yuhai who arranged his mission this time.

Seeing the other party ask, Lin Dong could not help smiling bitterly and said, “I probably can’t become his follower any longer!”

Feng Yuhai’s brows raised up and he said in puzzlement, “What’s going on? Do you know, this duty is what many people are fighting for!”

Being a Pill Tower elder’s follower was not just about glory, it was also a ladder to ensure one’s own strength steadily rose higher!

A Pill Tower elder casually refining a few medicinal pills when he was happy could let the follower digest for decades to a century.

This kind of task, there were naturally many people fighting for it.

Even though Ye Yuan’s strength was still weak, he was strongly recommended by Second Elder.

Even if he could not refine rank four divine pills, making Second Elder take action, that could work too.

Lin Dong was helpless and could only recount the scene that happened in front of Ye Yuan’s door, making Feng Yuhai’s brows knit together tightly.

He sighed and said, “This was also hard on you. According to what you said, that Elder Ye might really be a chess piece pushed out by Second Elder. This matter, don’t take part if you can choose not to take part then!”
