Zhang Xiu died!

The entire army was in shock!

Nobody expected that an Extreme Medicine Sect’s top disciple was sentenced to death just like this!

Unexpectedly, but also within reason, the applause was continuous.

The big defeat was not to be blamed on the fight. The loss was too pathetic.

It was clearly the Extreme Medicine Sect who caused the defeat, but in the end, they could not do anything to them.

The Heaven One army needed a relief outlet.

And Zhang Xiu played this role very honorably.

“Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples finally got their retribution! Feels amazin,

“I didn’t expect that Ye Yuan, a grade five heavenly alchemist, could actually become a great commander! | feel that he is intentionally helping us to vent this frustration!”

“Haha, what a coincidence! I think so too! With so many of our brothers dead, what right do they have to be completely fine?”

“Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples normally had aloof airs like they are standing high above the masses. Your Father has found them displeasing to the eye for a long time!”

It was true that the Extreme Medicine Sect was a pillar that propped up the sky.

But this also developed the domineering personalities of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples.

Even if they were similarly Saint Sovereign Heavens, they were also aloof from the masses.

In their eyes, ordinary soldiers were not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as them at all.

Therefore, the people in the army who were unhappy with them were not in the minority.

It was just that they dared to get angry but did not dare to speak.

After all, when they get injured, they still needed the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples to treat them.

Sentencing Zhang Xiu to death, Xiao Shan flicked his sleeves and walked away.

Everyone knew that an even higher level contest would start soon!

At the northern front battle this time, the Extreme Medicine Sect sent an ancestor over too!

Killing the Extreme Medicine Sect’s people was equivalent to slapping their faces. How could they be willing to drop the matter?

‘The wrath of an Emperor level powerhouse was not what a measly little Saint Sovereign heaven could bear.

In the eyes of Emperor level powerhouses, Ye Yuan, this great commander, had no weight at all.

‘The Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples were even sneering in their hearts.

Do you think that by becoming a great commander, you can use a made-up directive to order people around and disregard my Extreme Medicine Sect?

Laughable!

Great Commander, just you wait to receive Ancestor’s wrath!

When he heard the news of Zhang Xiu being sentenced to death, Ming Yi was currently discussing military affairs with Emperor Dan Fei.

He suddenly stood up and said angrily, “This boy, is he crazy? It’s just been a few days, and he caused such a major problem! When Emperor Zuo Chen finds out about this news, he’ll definitely be beyond furious! Lord Emperor, please hurry up and rescind your order! Otherwise, if it causes unhappiness

between emperors, that will be a big problem!”

But Dan Fei’s reaction was not as intense as Ming Yi’s.

On the contrary, the corners of his mouth even revealed a hint of a smile.

He reached his hand out and pressed down, gesturing to Ming Yias he said smilingly, “Just a small matter.”

Ming Yi smiled bitterly and said, “Lord Emperor, this isn’t a small matter!”

But Dan Fei said with a smile that was not a smile, “Do you feel that Ye Yuan did something wrong with regards to this matter?”

Ming Yi said without the slightest hesitation, “Of course he’s wrong! The Extreme Medicine Sect is a pillar that props up the sky. How can one of them be killed lightly? Moreover, there’s even Ancestor Zuo Chen standing behind them! Originally, letting him be the great commander, Xiao Shan would

definitely be unconvinced. Now, doesn’t it leave behind even more of a handle for gossip?”

But Dan Fei smiled meaningfully and said, “Ming Yi, you ... are not seeing it as deeply as Ye Yuan!”

Ming Yi was startled and hurriedly said, “Lord Emperor, please clarify!”

He knew that he might have overlooked some aspects.

Dan Fei smiled and said, “You’re wrong. Not only will this matter not incur Zuo Chen’s displeasure, he’ll be grateful to Ye Yuan instead! Ye Yuan, this great commander, has also thoroughly established his position firmly through this matter! Additionally, he’ll even get the whole army’s love and respect!

Killing three birds with one stone! Hulu, I really didn’t expect that in just a few days, this boy would give this seat a huge surprise!”

Dan Fei stroked his beard and smiled, clearly extremely satisfied with Ye Yuan.

Ming Yi was dazed after listening, not knowing what it meant at all.

When Dan Fei saw that he still did not understand, he could not resist shaking his head and sighing.

Ming Yi was startled in his heart, is Lord Emperor dissatisfied with me?

“The defeat of this great battle was entirely caused by the failure of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s true spirit method of suppression! After returning, it seemed like everyone had forgotten about this. Why is that? Because no one dares to mention this! How can a colossal giant like the Extreme Medicine Sect

be what a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven army can shake?”

“But, if the soldiers don’t say, does that mean that they really had no resentment in their hearts? Of course they do! The big defeat this time nearly caused extremely serious consequences, and it was entirely caused by the Extreme Medicine Sect! The crux is that before the great battle, Ye Yuan even

warmed the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples that there was a problem with this suppression method! The resentment in the soldiers’ hearts is likely already rising to the sky!”

“And just nice at this time, Ye Yuan killed an Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciple. What do you think those soldiers will think?”

Dan Fei explained skillfully and patiently. Ming Yi was dumbfounded from listening.

“But ... But Emperor Zuo Chen there

“Huhu, Zuo Chen this old fellow, he understands it in his heart! Not only does he understand, but he’s also actually very anxious in his heart too! Emperor Realm powerhouses can naturally disregard the thoughts of Saint Sovereign Heavens. But the failure this time was also a tremendous blow to the

Extreme Medicine Sect. It even affected their status in the Heaven One Alliance! At this time, it’s particularly important whether or not the soldiers are submitting wholeheartedly!”

“Over at the southern front, there hasn’t been too much war recently. There’s still a chance to remedy it. But the northern front here has already suffered a big defeat. So how can the reputation of the Extreme Medicine Sect be restored? Zhang Xiu was just a minor character of little importance. His death

wont affect much, But it gave the soldiers a great relief outlet. The soldiers understand in their hearts that they can’t do anything to the Extreme Medicine Sect. But they can imagine Zhang Xiu as the Extreme Medicine Sect and blame things on him bitterly!”

“Following this incident, the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples will be doing their best to treat the injured in the future, and even eradicating the blood corruption poison under Ye Yuan’s lead! Not only will the Extreme Medicine Sect’s reputation not suffer damage, but it might also make their prestige like

the noonday sun instead! No matter how formidable Ye Yuan is, he’s also just one person. It still needs the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples to really save people, isn’t that so?”

“A measly little grade five heavenly alchemist’s death can minimize the negative impact of this defeat! Do you think Zuo Chen that old fellow should be grateful to Ye Yuan or not? Not only will he not do anything to Ye Yuan, but he’ll also even recognize Ye Yuan’s status as a great commander! Ye Yuan’s

position of great commander can be considered to be secured!”

‘Talking until here, Dan Fei was even more pleased with himself, as if this was his own masterpiece.

He also indeed had his breath taken away in wonder by Ye Yuan’s ingenious brushwork!

‘This move was even more amazing than him executing Xuanji Nine Leaves!

It was completely resolving a big issue with little effort!

Ming Yi, who was by the side, was long already dumbfounded from listening.

He completely did not expect that the death of a measly little grade five heavenly alchemist actually implicated such a complicated situation.

A puny little Ye Yuan could actually see the overall situation so penetratingly?

This was impossible!

“Lord Emperor, his luck is also too good, right?” Ming Yi shook his head and said with a bitter smile.

“Luck?”

Dan Fei continued and said, “This isn’t luck! This boy saw things as clearly as viewing a blazing fire, seeing the world clearly, and has exceedingly high comprehension ability! He’s definitely a world-shattering talent! This matter looks like a dispute caused by personal feelings, but in reality, it’s a

situation that resulted from him advancing gradually and entrenching himself at every step! Each step seemed to be extremely coincidental, but when so many coincidences come together, it’s no longer a coincidence!”
