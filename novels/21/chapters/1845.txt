Chapter 1849 Spectacular Blunder

This sudden change shook Leng Hao’s mind.For a moment, he was actually suppressed by Leng XU.

“No way, I absolutely can’t lose!”

A voice shouted in Leng Hao’s heart.

He prepared for so many years, living like a dog.

Now that he had a chance to turn things around, how could he lose?

“Xi Yu Hao Ling Sword!”

Leng Hao shouted. A sword emerging, the four directions trembled, the entire ring teemed with his sword intent.

“So strong! Indeed worthy of being Leng Hao, to actually cultivate my Leng Family’s strongest sword style, Xi Yu Hao Ling Sword, to such a level!”

“Leng Hao used his trump card. Looks like the outcome is a foregone conclusion!”

Below the stage, someone immediately cried out in surprise.

Leng Hao’s momentum was shocking. His sword lights virtually enveloped Leng Xu completely.

However, amidst the sword rain, Leng Xu said coolly, “Xi Yu Hao Ling Sword, is it? Big Brother Leng Hao, with ten days of practicing the sword, I finally had some understanding. Let us decide the victor with the Xi Yu Hao Ling Sword!”

Finished saying, Leng Xu swung his long sword. Ten thousand streams of sword intent condensed frenziedly, and actually faintly suppressed Leng Hao.

Leng Hao’s expression suddenly changed and said, “Impossible! Middle-stage rank five Sword Dao law! You never grasped it after so many years of comprehension, so how can you possibly suddenly comprehend it?!”

He suddenly discovered that these ten days, the changes that happened to Leng Xu were too many.

Not only did he break through his realm, he even broke through Sword Dao laws.

Could this be a coincidence?

This coincidence was also a bit too many, right?!

However, there was already no time for Leng Hao to consider.

Only to see two powerful Sword Dao laws collide together fiercely.

Bang! Bang! Bang! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

On the stage, incomparably dazzling light bloomed, countless powerful sword lights bombarded together.

“Puhwark!”

Suddenly, Leng Hao spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood, body flying out backward, falling heavily on top of the stage.

He desperately wanted to crawl up, but a sword was already pressed on his throat. Another inch further and he would kick the bucket.

“Big Brother Leng Hao, you lost!”

Leng Xu’s nonchalant words made Leng Hao shudder.

Death-like silence!

The battle that was originally just going through the motions actually had a shocking reversal.

The Leng Xu that no one was optimistic about actually won!

Which was also to say that Leng Xu was still the young patriarch?

For some time, quite a few people’s hearts started racing.

These days, quite a number among them kicked him while he was down, and did not show Leng Xu any good attitude.

If Leng Xu continued to be the young patriarch, wouldn’t he find them to settle the scores afterward?

These people had their own little schemes. Actually, no one really cared about them.

Right now, the most awkward one was Leng Hongxiu and the elders.

They arranged this duel in order to let Leng Hao ascend to the position of young patriarch right and properly. Who knew that Leng Hao actually lost.

Of course, this could not be blamed on Leng Hao.

Leng Xu’s improvement, everyone saw it.

Ten days’ time, Leng Xu could be said to have been reborn anew!

But, this conclusion, how should the matter be wound up?

No one spoke. An atmosphere called awkwardness spread through the crowd.

Leng Hao’s face was deathly pale, his heart like dead ashes.

Many years of hard work wiped out in a day, that kind of unwillingness was virtually going to burst through the sky.

“Hahaha, what a joke! Your Leng Family really made a spectacular blunder! Hahaha ...”

Right at this time, a taunting voice sounded out.

A group of powerhouses rushed straight into the Leng Family’s manor.

Leng Hongxiu’s face turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Han Dongjun, you dare to barge into my Leng Manor without permission, are you tired of living?”

But Han Dongjun’s face fell and he said, “Leng Hongxiu, my son was killed, but your Leng Family is harboring the murderer, why can’t I barge inside?”

Leng Hongxiu said in a cold voice, “Nonsense, why would our Leng Family harbor your son’s murderer?”

Han Dongjun chuckled and said, “This, will have to ask your new, oh, nope, old young patriarch!”

Leng Hongxiu’s brows furrowed and his gaze involuntarily looked towards Leng Xu.

Leng Hao originally already lost all hope. But Han Dongjun’s appearance made him ignite the last trace of hope!

“Leng Xu, you covered up sinister motives and actually colluded with outsiders to make our Leng Family lose face! My Young Brother Xu, I know that you’re not happy with big brother, but this is our Leng Family’s affairs after all. You doing this really disappoints people too much!” Leng Hao got up and said righteously.

Leng Xu also did not expect that Han Dongjun actually directly brought people to barge into the Leng Family.

“Xu-er, shouldn’t you give us an explanation?” Leng Hongxiu’s tone also gradually turned cold.

As the saying went, don’t wash dirty linen in public.

No matter how troubled it was in the family, one also should not lose face until it went outside.

Even though the Leng Family’s internal strife was already not some secret.

But Han Dongjun came too coincidentally; just nice the crucial part of selecting the young patriarch. This had to make people’s minds fall into a reverie.

Leng Xu was silent for a moment and said coolly, “Han Xiao was killed by me. If you want the person, take me away.”

But when Han Dongjun heard it, he burst out laughing. But very soon, his expression turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Punk, you can’t escape responsibility either! But, the person who killed my son, I’ve long investigated it clearly. It’s a brat called Ye Yuan!”

Hearing this name, that ten thousand years ice-like face of Leng Qiuling’s finally had a trace of change.

Leng Hongxiu was slightly surprised and asked, “You know him?”

Leng Qiuling recovered her calm very quickly and shook her head and said, “Shouldn’t be the same person.”

On Heavenspan Mountain, the shock that that person brought to her was too intense. Such that until now, that person’s figure was still revolving around in her mind, unable to wave away for a long time.

Except, it was impossible that the Ye Yuan out of Han Dongjun’s mouth was that the Ye Yuan she knew.

With Ye Yuan’s cultivation speed, it was also impossible to reach Celestial Deity Realm now, even if his performance on the Heavenspan Mountain was extremely breathtaking.

Pray tell, a martial artist who used more than 500 years before barely managing to cultivate to the Divine Lord Realm, how could he possibly break through to Celestial Deity Realm in a short four to five hundred years?

One had to know, the breakthrough to the Celestial Deity Realm was more than a hundred times harder than the Divine Lord Realm!

Leng Xu’s expression was very ugly. He knew that Ye Yuan was right under the stage, he wanted to let Ye Yuan slip away quickly by taking advantage of the crowd.

But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of leaving at all.

Swoosh!

Just as Leng Xu was in a daze, Leng Hao suddenly launched a sneak attack, suddenly smacking a palm toward Leng Xu.

“Leng Family’s traitor! Why haven’t you hand over the person yet? Kneel down for me!”

This palm was too sudden, Leng Xu did not react at all. When he wanted to defend, it was already too late.

But right at this time, a figure appeared out of thin air, charging out from the side.

Bang!

An incomparably heavy palm force directly smacked Leng Hao flying.

“For your own selfish interests, not scrupling to kill your younger brother. Outsiders came to invade and you didn’t stint to sell out your brother, letting outsiders see a joke. A person like you is also fit to be the young patriarch? The Leng Family is really a joke!”

Ye Yuan’s words were full of cynicism.

Seeing that slightly thin figure on the stage, Leng Qiuling’s gaze was full of shock.
