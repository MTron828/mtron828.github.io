Chapter 2640: Thistle South Sea Region

Boom!

An invisible fist force punched into the void at this moment.

When the black-robed old man saw this scene, his expression could not help changing wildly.

He had the mind to drag Ye Yuan back but already could not do it.

He knew that the void seemed calm, but this punch rendered the void completely chaotic.

The shattered space would tear Ye Yuan to shreds!

When the black-robed old man saw the handsome youth who stepped out of the void, he had a solemn expression on his face.

The youth looked at the black-robed old man and said smilingly, “The new sect master is already dead. You guys … can go with peace of mind. Don’t you say so, He Xuyan?”

The black-robed old man’s pupils constricted and he said coldly, “Your Pill Alliance really knows quite a lot! It’s just, I wonder if you guys really came from the south or not?”

The youth smiled slightly and said, “Guess.”

“Ye Yuan!” Feng Xuanyi’s eyes turned bloodshot from anger, his gaze full of unwillingness.

The undulation just now, he felt it clearly.

Under this power, it was absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to survive!

Feng Xuanyi thought that by relying on He Xuyan’s strength, he could at least send Ye Yuan out.

Who would have thought that this Pill Alliance’s Saint Sovereign Heaven was actually so powerful!

This was getting rid of the weeds by uprooting them!

Xiao Feibai went to chase after Luo Yunqing too. Could he escape with his life?

Feng Xuanyi felt that the world suddenly became incomparably dark.

The Martial Secure Heavenly Sect did not even have a final trace of life anymore!

Boom!

Under Huangfu Cloudthink’s palm, Feng Xuanyi spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly.

His time was up. His life was fading rapidly and his strength was also falling rapidly.

The current Feng Xuanyi was no longer Huangfu Cloudthink’s match anymore.

Huangfu Cloudthink laughed loudly and said, “You all are too naive! How can Lord Alliance Chief possibly let Ye Yuan leave? Since he wasn’t willing to surrender, then he’s the Pill Alliance’s mortal enemy! Letting such an opponent live, we’ll find it hard to eat and sleep!”

Each of Huangfu Cloudthink’s palm moves was stronger than the last, Feng Xuanyi was already powerless to parry.

His pupils gradually dilated, carrying a strong unwillingness.

All the way until the moment he died, he did not close his eyes too[1]!

The youth looked at He Xuyan, still smiling brightly as he said, “Alright. Now, the new and old sect master are both dead. Your Martial Secure Heavenly Sect can officially withdraw from the stage of history.”

The aura on He Xuyan’s body gradually rose.

He was different from Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. His aura was illusory, giving people a sacred feeling.

This was the unique charm of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

“I know that you’re very strong, but if you want to chomp down on me, this old bone, it will probably injure you badly too!” He Xuyan seemed to have seen through everything, planning on fighting to the death.

The youth was still very calm and said with a smile, “Is that so? I’m afraid that this is just your wishful thinking.”

As he said, there was an additional piece of jade ornament in the youth’s hand.

When this jade ornament appeared, He Xuyan’s pupils constricted.

He cried out in surprise, “This … Could this be the legendary grandmist treasure?”

The youth smiled and said, “That’s right, at least you have some knowledge!”

He Xuyan said in surprise, “Looks like you guys indeed came from the south!”

The youth said coolly, “Whether or not we came from the south isn’t important anymore. From now on, your five great heavenly sects will become the past. My Pill Alliance will unify the Rainclear Continent!”

Waves of gentle light halo emitted from the jade ornament. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Although the light halo was gentle, He Xuyan’s expression was unprecedentedly solemn.

… …

Three months later, in the extreme south of the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, above the vast expanse of ocean, a ship made out of fine steel was currently approaching the shore.

On the ship, four to five young men and women were rather excited.

“Heh,?it’s the offshore water region not far ahead! After reaching the offshore water region, we’ll be completely safe!”

“The harvest this time is so big. It’s all thanks to Brother Haoyan! Not only did Brother Haoyan obtain the Water Concealment Pearl, this kind of treasure, but he also even attracted more than half of the true spirit sea race troops with his power alone.”

“Huhu,

?to talk about credit, it’s of course still Peiyun who contributed the most! She is of the grade five pre-natal water spirit physique. She’s most suitable for the Water Concealment Pearl. If not for her, we also wouldn’t have accomplished this feat.”

Huang Haoyan looked towards Su Peiyun with a look of adoration.

Su Peiyun was Calm South City’s city lord’s daughter, Huang Haoyan had courted her for a long time already.

This time, he finally succeeded with the Water Concealment Pearl.

Su Peiyun looked at Huang Haoyan and found him pleasing to the eye no matter how she looked at him and said smilingly, “Big Brother Yan is too modest! Peiyun only went in to take some things. What credit is there? Rather, it’s Big Brother Yan, your strength stands head and shoulders above all others. Facing 3000 true spirit sea race members, you didn’t show the least bit of fear too, a real man!”

When Huang Haoyan heard that, his heart burst with joy and he repeatedly said dare not.

“Eh,?you guys, look! There’s someone in the sea!” Suddenly a companion shouted.

That person in the sea clearly saw this large ship too and had a look of joy on his face as he shouted loudly, “Friends on the ship, can you give me a ride, I’ll be extremely grateful!”

As he said, he did not wait for everyone to agree either and actually leaped straight onto the large ship.

When Huang Haoyan saw the arrival, his brows furrowed hard.

This person was dressed in white clothing, full of bloodstains on it. His aura was also very disorderly. Clearly, he had sustained considerable injuries.

With regards to such a guy with unknown origins, Huang Haoyan was naturally unwilling to bring alone.

“Who are you?! How rude! Did this young lady let you onto the boat?” Su Peiyun flew off the handle first.

The youth in white clothing smiled bitterly and said, “Really sorry about it! I got lost in the sea and have already drifted for more than a month. I finally managed to run into you all. Can you let me hitch a ride? Otherwise, I wouldn’t even be able to find the way back!”

Su Peiyun rolled her eyes and said, “Your direction was completely wrong. Of course, you couldn’t find your way back! This guy is so reckless, to actually dare rush the Thistle South Sea Region all alone by himself, courting death? To be able to reach here alive, really don’t know how lucky you got! Brainless fellow!”

The youth in white clothes smiled bitterly and said, “What Miss said is true! I don’t have any malicious intent. These few heavenly pills, just take it as recompense to thank the few of you, how’s that?”

As he said, the youth in white clothes took out five heavenly pills.

The moment Su Peiyun and the rest saw, they could not help crying out in surprise, “Grand completion ninth grade! Grade two Heavenly Pith Pill!”

The few people exchanged glances, clearly moved by it.

The Heavenly Pith Pill was a superb heavenly pill for cultivation. Furthermore, it was even grand completion ninth grade, it was not up to them to not be moved.

The youth in white clothes gave Su Peiyun and glance and said with a smile, “Miss seems to cultivate a water-attribute cultivation method, I just happen to have a Water Intent Condensed Fragrance Pill on me. I believe that Miss has use for it!”

Su Peiyun opened her mouth wide and was rendered speechless and lifeless.

A grand completion ninth grade level Water Intent Condensed Fragrance Pill was simply a priceless treasure to her!

The things that they obtained in the true spirit sea clan might not compare to this when added up too!

One had to know, the Water Intent Condensed Fragrance Pill could help her increase her rule realm.

A grand completion ninth grade Water Intent Condensed Fragrance Pill was sufficient to improve her power of rule further.

The gazes that the few people looked towards the man in white with, immediately became different.

Just as everyone was surprised, a huge wave suddenly stirred up behind the large ship.

Huang Haoyan’s expression changed wildly and he said, “Not good, those guys must have discovered that the Treasure Depository Pavilion in the tribe was robbed! They are catching up!”
