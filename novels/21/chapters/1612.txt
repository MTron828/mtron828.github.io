Chapter 1616 Xiantian Divine Lord Mystic Treasure

“elders, i believe that the news of ling zikun’s arrival, everyone already knows about it. actually, his real objective of coming this time is to seek help from us ...”

ruo xu spoke with confidence and composure, introducing the true objective of ling zikun coming this time, making all of the elders visibly moved.

it turned out that river eternal imperial city had a sudden phenomenon. it was very likely that a precious treasure was about to be born.

but the place where the phenomenon occurred was at the borders with eminent orchid imperial city.

this phenomenon clearly could not hide from the eyes and ears of the fiend race.

a precise treasure capable of causing a heaven and earth phenomenon, the fiend race would naturally covet it too.

now, there were already large groups of experts gathering at the place where the phenomenon occurred.

river eternal imperial city was worried that a single log could not prop up a tottering building. hence, they sought assistance from the surrounding imperial cities.

ling zikun’s party precisely came to heavenly eagle imperial city to ask for help.

the two imperial cities were adjacent neighbors. if river eternal imperial city wanted to seek help, they naturally had to look for the heavenly eagle imperial city.

“elder zheng qi, this matter still needs your martial tower to take action. what do you think?” ruo xu asked zheng qi.

zheng qi mused for a moment and said, “this matter concerns the fiend race, we naturally have to help. it’s just that, if there is only one precious treasure, what should be done about the final ownership?”

ruo xu said, “this matter, i’ve already asked ling zikun. he said that precious treasures are obtained by the fated. as long as it doesn’t land in the hands of the fiend race, that will do. but hearing ling zikun’s meaning, this precious treasure is likely extraordinary. it might attract fiend race celestial deity realm powerhouses!”

the moment these words came out, everyone’s face suddenly changed.

once celestial deity realm powerhouses stepped in, this matter would become very tricky.

zheng qi thought about it and said, “this matter, best for this old man to personally take action! with the others going, they probably can’t control the scene. disregarding fiend race powerhouses, just that land where precious treasure would be born will likely be quite dangerous too.”

“no way! head elder zheng, you’re the martial tower’s leader! how can you take the risk personally?”

“yeah, head elder zheng, you’re the strongest person in the martial tower. if you were to meet with any mishap, what would we do?”

the moment zheng qi said that he wanted to go, many elders directly expressed objection.

but zheng qi waved his hand and said, “it’s precisely because this old man is the strongest that i have to personally go there. supporting river eternal imperial city is one thing, seeing if there’s a chance to seize the precious treasure is another. more importantly, i have to bring the people who go back! this matter, there’s no need to say anything, this old man’s mind is made up!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

at this time, the pill tower and martial tower’s elders were all present.

the martial tower was going on an expedition, so the pill tower naturally had to refine a batch of medicinal pills too.

ye yuan looked at zheng qi, his gaze revealing admiration.

anyone knew that this trip was dangerous. even celestial deity realm powerhouses might be alarmed. seizing treasure this sort of thing, it was probably not that easy.

even if zheng qi went personally, it was also not certain that he could return safe and sound.

clearly, zheng qi knew that this trip was perilous, that was why he would so personally, only to hope to bring some more people back.

this undertaking filled ye yuan with deep veneration.

at this time, he could casually appoint an elder to go, and presumably, no one would dare to say a word.

ruo xu also did not expect that zheng qi was actually so decisive. he opened his mouth and said, “old brother, have you really decided on this?”

zheng qi nodded and said, “brother ruo xu, those few are in closed-seclusion all year round. when this old man isn’t around, heavenly eagle imperial city will be entrusted to you.”

ruo xu sighed and said, “alright! this matter, this old man can’t help much either. these few days, this old man will urge the pill tower’s elders to refine more batches of medicinal pills.”

zheng qi cupped his fists and said, “then i’ll have to trouble brother ruo xu!”

afterward, zheng qi picked out another ten or so martial tower elders, deacons, and protectors.

these people had to follow him.

even head elder was personally going, they naturally had no reason to refuse.

moreover, this kind of thing, if it happened to anyone, they would have the mentality of leaving things to luck.

what if the precious treasure was obtained by them?

“alright, this matter is decided, all disperse then,” ruo xu said.

at this time, the ye yuan who had been silent all along suddenly spoke up, “head elder zheng, i’m going too.”

ruo xu’s brows furrowed and he berated, “elder ye, what are you messing around for?”

the moment zheng qi heard, he also shook his head and said, “elder ye, this trip is too dangerous, even this old man doesn’t have the confidence to get out unscathed. you’d best not go. you’re our heavenly eagle imperial city’s future hope, nothing must happen to you!”

ye yuan smiled and said, “everyone, calm down. listen to me until the end.”

as he said, he looked at ruo xu and asked, “head elder ruo xu, did ling zikun tell you what the precious treasure coming into being this time is?”

ruo xu was stunned and shook his head and said, “the precious treasure hasn’t been born yet, how would he know?”

ye yuan smiled and said, “if my guesses are right, the venue where the precious treasure is being born this time should be the fiend calling ridge’s natural chasm, right?”

ruo xu was surprised as he said, “how did you know?”

the specifics of the location was not disclosed previously, but ye yuan actually knew the location of the birth of the precious treasure, how could this not surprise him?

ye yuan smiled and said, “i’ve been to the fiend calling ridge before, and also went down the natural chasm before, so i’m still rather familiar with that place. i know that you all are worried that my realm is lacking. but going this time, even if a person’s realm being high, it will likely be useless.”

when the group of elders heard ye yuan’s words, they were incredibly shocked.

they also did not expect that ye yuan actually went to river eternal imperial city before, and even went down fiend calling ridge’s natural chasm before.

zheng qi’s brows knitted together and he said to ye yuan, “elder ye, you continue speaking!”

he realized that ling zikun probably held something back, afraid that they would not go, so he did not say.

ye yuan nodded his head and continued saying.

actually, when ye yuan returned from the fiend race back then, he went down the natural chasm once more.

he could sense that natural chasm’s extraordinariness and harbored a curious mindset, that was why he went down to investigate.

of course, others could also feel it. it was just that they did not have the ability to go down.

even divine lord realm powerhouses got to be careful going down too. a single misstep and it was the outcome of being smashed to pieces.

one had to know, the further down that natural chasm, the stronger the forcefield.

when ye yuan just broke through to origin deity realm back then, he could just happen to go down and temper the origin magnetism spirit wood and explore it along the way.

at that time, ye yuan sunk down close to ten thousand meters and still did not reach the bottom.

but at that time, a strong uneasiness came from below, making ye yuan not dare to go deeper anymore.

but ye yuan also felt that there seemed to faintly be a powerful aura transmitting out from below. it was as if there was some treasure currently gestating.

this kind of magical place giving birth to whatever treasure was also a very normal thing.

hearing ruo xu’s introduction earlier, ye yuan immediately connected it to this natural chasm.

“if my conjectures are right, the precious treasure coming into being this time might be an innate divine lord mystic treasure, or might even be an innate celestial deity mystic treasure!”

ye yuan words hell-bent on shocking people to death, igniting the elders meeting all at once.

“what? innate divine lord mystic treasure!”

“my god! don’t talk about innate celestial deity mystic treasure, even innate celestial deity mystic treasure, celestial deity powerhouses can’t hold back either!”

“this ling zikun wouldn’t be scamming us, right?”

all the elders revealed fervent looks, clearly extremely moved by this innate divine lord mystic treasure.
