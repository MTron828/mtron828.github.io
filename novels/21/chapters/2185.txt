Chapter 2189: Continuing Forward

Listening entirely to the news from the devil monster leader, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed even tighter.

Li-er did not die!

But Li-er was captured!

These abyss monsters were actually going to send Li-er into the abyss space!

With the devil monster’s level, he did not know the reasons involved.

The human powerhouses who fell into the Blackflame Cave previously were already all devoured by the abyss monsters.

Only left Li-er alone!

There were clearly more unknown secrets involved.

Although it was Ye Yuan’s first time hearing abyss space this place, there was no need to guess that he also knew that the place was the abyss monsters’ main camp!

If Li-er went there, even if he had exceedingly formidable abilities, it would also be hard to rescue her.

Ye Yuan knew that this abyss space definitely had immensely powerful existences.

Otherwise, why would those Dragon Clan major powers suppress in the depths of the Dragon Eye Cave?

For some time, Ye Yuan’s heart burned with anxiety.

At this time, Zheng Yufeng went up and consoled him. Zheng Yufeng said, “Brother Ye, Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli will be blessed by the heavens and definitely turn calamities into blessings!”

Ye Yuan forcefully pressed down the anxiety in his heart and nodded slightly as he said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Zheng, thank you for your auspicious blessings! Arriving here, I believe that everyone also knows the situation in the Blackflame Cave. Continuing to advance further, I’m afraid that everyone won’t be able to return anymore. It ends here then!”

The few leaders nodded one after another, all agreeing with Ye Yuan’s view.

This damn place, they did not wish to stay for a moment longer.

If not for Ye Yuan, they would already currently be dead until dregs did not remain.

Zheng Yufeng let out a sigh and said, “There’s only like this.”

Suddenly, Lin Changqing rushed in front of Ye Yuan, and pointed at Ye Yuan as he roared angrily, “Ye Yuan, you coward! Do you plan on leaving Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli here alone?”

Everyone cast strange gazes toward Lin Changqing, Ye Yuan’s choice was naturally the wise choice.

Continuing forward at this time, what could he do apart from sending himself to death?

Lin Changqing’s action was a little too impulsive and without due consideration.

Ye Yuan ignored Lin Changqing and said to the few leaders with clasped hands, “Gentlemen, we’ll part here!”

Everyone was stunned, what did this mean?

Zheng Yufeng asked probingly, “Brother Ye, you aren’t leaving together with us?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Li-er is in danger. How can this Ye look on with folded arms? Even if I lose this life, this Ye will also have to rescue her!”

At this time, tenderness revealed in Ye Yuan’s eyes made the group of Empyreans cast sidelong glances too.

Only then did everyone know that Ye Yuan’s meaning was that they should leave, while he would stay.

What a lovesick man!

Zheng Yufeng was taken aback and urged, “Brother Ye, it is not that this Zheng isn’t concerned about Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli. Didn’t you also see it? Continuing forward is certain death! Is such a thing that brings destruction on yourself worth it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There’s not worth it or not; only willing or not. Gentlemen, let’s part here.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan brought the devil monster leader and turned around and left.

Lin Changqing was frozen on the spot. Abruptly startling awake, he took quick steps and caught up to Ye Yuan. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I’ll go too!” Lin Changqing said with a firm gaze.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Changqing and said calmly, “If I go myself, there’s a fraction of assurance. Bringing you ... this fraction will be gone. If you insist on following and sending yourself to doom, I have no objections either. But ... don’t ... follow ... me!”

Talking to the back, Ye Yuan’s tone gradually turned cold.

The meaning of his words was already very clear, you could only get in the way if you follow!

Lin Changqing’s complexion turned deathly pale with a whoosh, feeling all the strength in his body being drained.

If it were before, if anyone dared to say such things in front of him, he would definitely have sent a slap over.

But now, after witnessing Ye Yuan’s series of inconceivable means, his confidence was long demoralized until it was battered black and blue.

Finally, it turned into a bitter smile as he said, “Alright, I got it!”

Finished talking, Lin Changqing turned around, his back view being indescribably lonely.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Changqing’s back view and shook his head slightly.

He understood Lin Changqing’s thoughts. It was just too bad that no one could understand his knot with Li-er.

Lin Changqing could only be a passer-by.

Zheng Yufeng also sighed slightly. Toward this scene, he had nothing to say as well.

To talk about Lin Changqing, he was absolutely exceptionally gifted, being the most unequivocally talented among them apprentice brothers.

It was just a shame that his opponent was Ye Yuan!

In front of such a monster, so what even if one’s talent was any greater?

Ye Yuan brought the devil monster leader and gradually vanished from everyone’s line of sight.

Zheng Yufeng and the rest did not dare to stay too long either, withdrawing one after another.

After an hour, Ye Yuan suddenly stopped and asked the devil monster leader, “Do you have a name?”

The devil monster leader trembled and said, “This lowly one is called Mosius.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “From today onward, you’re my slave! Now, let’s sign the Devil Devouring Contract!”

Mosius’s expression changed wildly, looking at Ye Yuan with a look of terror.

He did not think that Ye Yuan actually even knew about the Devil Devouring Contract.

How could he know that Ye Yuan had killed countless abyss monsters in the Dragon Eye Cave and had long thoroughly grasped some information about the abyss monsters?

This Devil Devouring Contract was similar to the slave contact of humans.

Once the contract was formed, the abyss monster would unconditionally obey the other party and become the other party’s slave.

If there was the thought of resisting, they would immediately get a backlash from the contract and die, with their outcome being extremely miserable.

Under normal circumstances, even if abyss monsters were to die, they would not sign a Devil Devouring Contract too.

But at the thought of Ye Yuan’s methods, Mosius could not refrain from shuddering.

“Even if we signed a Devil Devouring Contract, you also can’t possibly rescue that human girl! Further in are all late-stage Empyrean lords. There are even Heavenly Emperor level lords holding down the fort! If you go, there’s no hope at all!” Mosius gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “That’s not something that you should be worried about. You can choose to die or sign a Devil Devouring Contract with me.”

Dignity this thing, once lost, then it would be lost again and again.

Under Ye Yuan’s despotic power, Mosius finally still signed the Devil Devouring Contract with Ye Yuan.

“Master!” Mosius lay prone in front of Ye Yuan, his attitude being incomparably humble and polite.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly. Suddenly, his aura changed.

Thick devilish energy poured out of Ye Yuan’s body and wrapped his entire person up.

Thick black fur also grew on Ye Yuan’s body.

He looked exactly like an abyss monster.

Abyss monsters had no common form; humanoid shapes were also not in the minority.

“M-Master, this is ... too inconceivable!” Mosius was shocked until he could not use words to describe it any longer.

A human actually became an abyss monster with a sway of his body.

Even he, this Sixth Firmament Empyrean super powerhouse, could not differentiate the truth in the slightest!

What kind of existence was this master of his?!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Can your Heavenly Emperor powerhouses differentiate my appearance?”

Mosius shook his head hard and said, “Absolutely impossible to tell! All of the characteristics on Master’s body are identical with abyss monsters. They absolutely can’t differentiate Master from abyss monsters!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s good then. You take these tarnished black devil crystals and recover your cultivation as fast as possible.”
