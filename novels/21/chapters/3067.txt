Chapter 3066: The Dust Settles!

Ancestor Endless slowly opened his eyes, revealing a pondering look.

With 18 years of comprehension, he reaped great benefits!

Compared to when he came, his strength grew significantly!

“The 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings are indeed unfathomable! But sadly, I’m not Old Man Heavenless’ match. Otherwise, I’d definitely snatch the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings away!” Ancestor Endless said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ancestor Profound Ice said with a cold snort, “Do you really think that Old Man Heavenless is so kind? His thoughts are hard to guess in the first place. You don’t know what he wants to do at all!”

Ancestor Endless sighed and said, “Yes, but what choice do we have? It’s just that I don’t know who can have such a good life, to obtain the recognition of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.”

Ancestor Burning Sky looked in Kong Tan’s direction and said with a smile, “This kid originally thought that he’d definitely win. But he didn’t expect the soul race lass to interject halfway, right? It seems like his Dao heart is currently a little unstable!”

Kong Tan reached the heaven in one step and was the first to break through the shackles of Hegemon Realm.

He originally thought that he had secured the first place.

But he did not expect that Cloudneon was even more monstrous than him!

In a short 18 years, Cloudneon actually directly broke through from Peak Hegemon to Supreme Hegemon!

The Kong Tan instantly felt tremendous pressure.

In these 18 years, he did not dare to slack off in the slightest, desperately comprehending the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.

......

However, Cloudneon visualized the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings step-by-step, developing the origin of dream to the extreme.

The 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings were all-encompassing, deriving Heavenly Dao. To the Cloud Dream Soul Physique, it was absolutely a priceless treasure.

Ancestor Endless said, “The young are to be feared! Kong Tan and the soul race lass, their comprehension ability is truly terrifying! However, with Yang Qing and Ye Yuan two people’s comprehension ability, they shouldn’t have faded into the crowd? Could it be that they were held back by some other matters? No, wait, what could be more important than visualizing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings?”

Ancestor Profound Ice said coolly, “Fading into the crowd is also not impossible! Back then, the few of us weren’t top folks in the Labyrinth Divine Palace too. But in the end, it was us who became the 12 Heavenly Kings! Kong Tan, Yu Ran, and Qin Baichuan, these juniors are descendants of pedigree ancestry. There’s nothing strange about thick accumulations erupting. Being in the lead for a short while doesn’t mean forever taking the lead.”

When the other two heard that, they felt that it made sense too.

The most important thing in the Labyrinth Divine Palace was naturally the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.

Heavenless’ inheritance, this kind of temptation was not what the average person could resist. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

How could Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, that sort of lousy place, possibly produce any world-shocking genius?

Above the void, the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings suddenly extinguished, becoming one red-green jade scroll after another.

Everyone stopped breathing. They knew that the most crucial moment had arrived!

The 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings had clearly already found the person that they acknowledged!

The greatest reward for this trip to the Labyrinth Divine Palace was here!

Who would obtain all of Ancestor Heavenless’ legacy?

This reward was much better than obtaining whatever chaos heavenly treasure.

“You guys, who do you think will obtain the recognition of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings?”

“It’s definitely Kong Tan, right? Among so many geniuses, his improvement is clearly the biggest!”

“That soul race Hegemon Realm is also monstrous to the extreme! Peak Hegemon to Supreme Hegemon, this step is as difficult as ascending to heaven. She actually crossed it so easily.”

“There are also Feng Qingxuan and Yu Ran. They are not bad at all either! No one knows what the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings’ benchmark is, no?”

“Indeed, there’s really this possibility! Don’t know who can become this trip’s child of destiny!”

… …

Kong Tan clenched both hands tightly, his breathing somewhat ragged. Clearly, he was rather nervous.

The other young geniuses were pretty much the same as him.

Although their hope was not as high as Kong Tan’s, they did not know what the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings’ criterion was either.

Who knew whether or not they would be hit by the meat pie that fell from the sky?

Compared to them, Cloudneon seemed much more composed.

Breaking through to Supreme Hegemon, she was already very satisfied.

Suddenly, a streak of green light flew out of the 12 pieces of red-green jade scrolls respectively.

After the green light appeared, it converged in the air.

Everyone’s heart was nervous to the extreme.

In the crowd, there were two people who stood aloof from things of no personal interest.

These two people were naturally Ye Yuan and Yang Qing.

Two years ago, they broke out of the ‘Heaven’ scroll.

In these two years, they turned these side-halls inside out, and sure enough, they found another three lambskin scrolls!

Counting the ‘Heaven’ scroll, Ye Yuan had obtained four Heavenly Dao Paintings.

12 Heavenly Dao Paintings in their order were: Heaven, Earth, Universe, Aeon, Sun, Moon, Star, Man, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.

The changes of all things in heaven and earth were generally speaking within these 12 Heavenly Daos!

And these three Heavenly Dao paintings that Ye Yuan obtained, they were respectively the Sun scroll, Universe scroll, and Winter scroll!

“Ye Yuan, who do you think will obtain the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings’ recognition?” Yang Qing asked.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “It should be Kong Tan.”

Yang Qing said in surprise, “I even thought that you’d definitely say Cloudneon!”

Ye Yuan said, “I’m just guessing. Talking about comprehension ability, Cloudneon is only stronger than Kong Tan and not weaker. But her cultivation realm is too high. Her improvement is limited. Meanwhile Kong Tan ascended to heaven, stepping into Hegemon Realm from middle Emperor Sakra Heaven in one step! His current strength can probably already rival Peak Hegemons! In comparison, his potential is clearly a little higher.”

Yang Qing nodded and said, “Now that you said it, it’s indeed the case.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “But I feel that no matter who the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings acknowledge, it will all be in vain in the end. Cloudneon is still alright. Her temperament is cold. She’ll remain indifferent when granted favors or being subjected to humiliation. But if it’s Kong Tan, his heart will probably shatter all over the floor.”

When Yang Qing heard that, a hint of a smile could not help appearing in the corners of his mouth.

Looking at this guy feeling deflated seemed to be pretty good too.

At this time, the green light descended!

It fell from the sky like a comet.

Boom!

That green light directly smashed onto Kong Tan’s body.

The dust was settled!

Kong Tan only felt that there was an additional trace of inexplicable connection between him and those 12 red-green scrolls.

He was immediately wildly ecstatic in his heart!

“Hahaha?… It’s indeed me! Indeed me! This time, it’s finally me who had the last laugh! Ye Yuan, Yang Qing, Hegemon Cloudneon, do you guys see it? The one who has the last laugh is the real winner! You all are my, Kong Tan’s, stepping stone!” Kong Tan let out a wild laugh as he said.

Defeating Cloudneon, he had indescribable joy in his heart!

The nervousness of more than a decade was all dispersed at this moment.

He felt that he was going to step at the peak of all the heavens and look down on all life!

Feng Qingxuan, Yu Ran, and the rest all revealed looks of disappointment.

A miracle indeed did not happen!

“Sigh,?I didn’t expect that Hegemon Cloudneon actually lost to Kong Tan! I feel that her talent is only stronger and not weaker than Kong Tan!”

“Isn’t that so! With this, the fiend race is really going to rise up!”

“Kong Tan obtained the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings and Ancestor Heavenless’ inheritance. His future accomplishments will probably be above Progenitor Kong Nie’s!”

… …

The dust settling, everyone could only use envious gazes to size Kong Tan up.
