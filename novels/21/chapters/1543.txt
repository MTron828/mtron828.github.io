“You all wait here. I’ll go refine medicinal pills!” Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly.

Everyone’s face turned somber and could not help looking at Ye Yuan with surprise.

Could it be that this kid really had a way to cure Huang Qian?

No way, he must be pretending to be calm!

But now, seeing Chen Biao get smacked to death with one slap, nobody dared to move anymore.

Ye Yuan gave Ning Fangrong a very meaningful glance, turned around, and went into the inner hall.

Ning Fangrong was shocked inwardly. Could it be that this kid saw through that it was him who took action?

He shouldn’t be able to, right?

No one present could perceive it, yet, this kid could discern it?

However, this kid is really very impressive. That punch from before should be of spatial laws, right?

Truly remarkable, disregarding that his alchemy talent is heaven-defying, his martial arts talent is also this terrifying.

Truly a freak!

Ning Siyu also wanted to follow Ye Yuan in but was rejected by Ye Yuan with words.

The refinement this time, Ye Yuan had to use the Profound Yellow Cauldron and naturally could not let Ning Siyu watch by the side.

“Tch, don’t look then, what’s the big deal!” Ning Siyu stomped her feet angrily.

...

Sun Moon Gang’s headquarters, a middle-aged man slowly walked out of the hidden chamber.

Seeing this middle-aged man, He Xiao’s face revealed a look of wild elation.

“Congratulations to Big Brother for breaking through the shackles, becoming a Divine Lord powerhouse!” He Xiao said with joy all over his face.

This middle-aged man was precisely the Sun Moon Gang’s chief head, Xiao Riyue.

He went into a ten-year terminal seclusion and finally broke free of the shackles today, breaking through the calm, becoming a Divine Lord Realm existence admired by tens of thousands of people.

This was a tremendous leap. It could be said to be soaring to the heavens in one bound.

Origin Deity Realm was no different from ants to Divine Lord Realm.

Xiao Riyue was in high and vigorous spirits, his entire person’s bearing worlds apart from before.

“Huhu, Second Brother, it’s been hard on you these few years!” Xiao Riyue said with a faint smile.

Standing in front of Xiao Riyue, He Xiao felt tremendous pressure.

He knew that this big brother of his was no longer that big brother in the past!

“What’s Big Brother saying? Isn’t this what I should do?” He Xiao hurriedly said.

Xiao Riyue chuckled and said with boundless enthusiasm, “Second Brother, I know that it wasn’t easy on you these few years. But starting from today, this south city will be monopolized by our Sun Moon Gang alone! At least, we have to stand as equals with the three great families! In the future, the Sun Moon Gang is yours!”

He Xiao was wildly elated in his heart, but he did not dare to show it on his face and hurriedly said, “Big Brother is too serious. You’ll always be the Sun Moon Gang’s boss. I’m only helping Big Brother manage it a bit.”

Xiao Riyue glanced at He Xiao, very satisfied with his attitude, and said with a laugh, “Haha, you and I are brothers for how many years already, do we still need to distinguish between you and me?”

While the two people were talking, Luo Yu came to visit.

Xiao Riyue smiled and said, “Go, gobble up this Silverfeather Gang first.”

He Xiao smiled slightly, nodded his head, and followed after.

When Luo Yu saw Xiao Riyue, his shock could not be any greater. He did not think that Xiao Riyue really broke through!

They, these half-step divine lords, would have someone go into closed-seclusion to breakthrough at every turn. But less than a fraction were really able to break through.

Although the hope of Xiao Riyue breaking through was high, it was also just merely hopeful.

Breaking through to Divine Lord Realm was too difficult!

Luo Yu did not expect that Xiao Riyue really broke through to Divine Lord Realm in one go.

Henceforth, the heavens of the south city had changed!

“Head Luo seems to be very surprised.” Xiao Riyue looked at Luo Yu and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Luo Yu’s expression was very ugly and he said awkwardly, “I-Indeed very surprised! I didn’t expect that we fought for so many years, but now, it’s such a result.”

Luo Yu had a bitter taste in his mouth. This result ... was really very harsh to the taste.

Xiao Riyue smiled and said, “Fought for so many years, there should be a result too! Chief Head Luo, I wonder how you choose now?”

Luo Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Do I still have a choice? If I don’t agree, I probably can’t get out of this door today, right?”

Xiao Riyue laughed loudly and said, “He who understands the times is a wise man! Head Luo has always been a resourceful person among the three of us. Presumably, you won’t do foolish things.”

He Xiao suddenly said, “Brother Luo coming to my Sun Moon Gang, could it be that the Miracle Hand Parlor’s matter has a conclusion?”

He Xiao had always been waiting for Xiao Riyue to exit seclusion. Regarding the Miracle Hand Parlor’s matters, he was really not very clear.

Luo Yu coming over at this time, it was most likely because of the Miracle Hand Parlor’s matter.

“Miracle Hand Parlor? Isn’t that a small medicine shop run by the Dragon Slaying Gang?” Xiao Riyue said with a frown.

He Xiao nodded and said, “Big Brother isn’t aware, the recent period of time, a considerable change happened to the south city. And these changes all unfolded around this tiny little Miracle Hand Parlor!”

He Xiao briefly recounted the matter of the Dragon Slaying Gang changing names, and the matter of the Miracle Hand Parlor shooting to fame recently.

Xiao Riyue clicked his tongue in wonder when he heard this. He laughed and then said, “A mere initial-stage Origin Deity can actually stir up a storm in the south city, really not bad! Our south city’s three gangs are really missing a powerful alchemist.”

Luo Yu’s expression changed and he said with an ugly expression, “Brother Xiao, this kid just killed my sixth brother!”

Xiao Riyue said coolly, “You came to find He Xiao because you wanted to join hands with him to exterminate the Dragon Slaying Gang together?”

Luo Yu’s expression changed several times and he said with a nod, “Xing Guan’s character, Brother Xiao is aware too. He definitely won’t agree to merge into the Sun Moon Gang. Why not ... directly exterminate them.”

“Humph!”

Xiao Riyue gave a cold snort. The power of the world suddenly erupted, immediately sending Luo Yu flying out.

“Puhwark!”

Luo Yu immediately spewed out a mouthful of blood mist, suffering serious injuries.

The might of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses was dreadfully appalling!

“What I want to do, it still isn’t your turn to come and teach! Hearing you guys say it, I’m still very interested in that kid. If he really doesn’t know how to appreciate favors, just eradicate him!” Xiao Riyue said in a cold voice.

Luo Yu was incomparably shocked in his heart. This was the power of a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!

This was the strength that he desired!

He was not reconciled!

But the situation was stronger than the person. In front of Xiao Riyue’s absolute strength, he could only yield.

“It ... It was this Luo who was impetuous! Everything is up to Brother Xiao!” With extreme humiliation, Luo Yu bowed.

...

Everyone looked at the medicinal pill in Ye Yuan’s hands, marveling endlessly.

The fragrance emitting off that medicinal pill made them immensely intoxicated.

This medicinal pill, they did not recognize it. But it was undoubtedly divine-grade.

Ning Siyu did not recognize it either. But the undulation coming from the medicinal pill made her very certain that this medicinal pill was definitely very hard to refine.

Even harder to refine than the Gale Celestial Stone Pill!

No, wait, the Gale Celestial Stone Pill was not on the same level as this medicinal pill at all!

When Ye Yuan refined the Gale Celestial Stone Pill, his breathing was steady. A situation where his divine essence was inadequate did not happen at all.

But now, Ye Yuan’s entire person had chaotic breathing, his footsteps woozy. Clearly, it was the manifestation of excessive consumption of divine essence.

This medicinal pill was absolutely not simple!

“Ning Siyu, feed him the medicinal pill and help him refine the power of the medicinal pill with divine essence,” Ye Yuan said.

“Oh!”

Ning Siyu received the medicinal pill and fed it to Huang Qian. Her palm urging, she started to help him refine the medicinal pill with divine essence.

Very soon, a scene that made everyone exclaim in amazement occurred.
