Chapter 1998: Jiang Ming, I’ve Remembered It!

Very soon, the news spread out.

People from the City Lord Manor as well as powerhouses that were related to Ye Yuan, including those at the Celestial Deity Realm were all thrown into prison.

One True God Realm powerhouse, Bai Chen, was directly smacked by a palm move from his opponent, resulting in serious injury.

The black-clothed armored guards that the three great powerhouses brought took charge of the entire city’s defense.

Everyone was only allowed to enter and not allowed to go out.

The entire city was in a stir!

These few years, martial artists lived very comfortably in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City under Ye Yuan’s governance.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s Alchemy Dao’s prosperity also attracted a large number of martial artists.

The overall strength of the martial artists in the city already increased by a great deal.

These changes were visible in everyone’s eyes.

The martial artists in the city were very averse to these black-clothed armored soldiers that suddenly appeared.

It was just that the strengths of these black-clothed armored troops were too strong. Hence, they did not dare to resist at all.

Everyone dared to get angry but did not dare to speak up.

“If only Lord Ye Yuan was in the city, these guys definitely won’t dare to be unbridled.”

“Sigh! I heard that the ones who came this time are Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s middle-stage True God Realm powerhouses! Even if Lord Ye Yuan is here, it will likely be tough to stem the raging tides too.”

“Behind them, stands an Empyrean powerhouse! Even thinking about it makes people tremble! Could it be that ... Heavenly Eagle Imperial City is going to return to its state like in the past in the end? We barely experienced a few good days!”

Great imperial capitals were represented by Empyrean powerhouses.

Empyrean powerhouses represented invincibility!

At least, for an extremely long time, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s martial artists never thought that they could get involved with Empyrean powerhouses.

This level of powerhouse could massacre countless imperial cities with a wave of a hand. They were not in the same world as them at all.

Now, being targeted by this kind of powerhouse, everyone bemoaned endlessly in their hearts.

At least, the current days were much better than in the past. Who would be willing to return to the past?

“Oh, right, isn’t there still a Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse in the city?”

No idea who spoke, it rekindled everyone’s hope again.

What they did not know was that Lu Ziyi was currently confronting Bai Tong at this time.

“Am I making a move, or are you doing it yourself?” Lu Ziyi said coolly, without the slightest emotion.

Bai Tong said coolly, “I’ll only use one move. If you can receive it, I’ll enter the prison by myself.”

He was currently merely an initial-stage Fourth Firmament True God, but Lu Ziyi was a peak Fifth Firmament True God.

There was practically a difference of two minor cultivation realms between the two people.

Although Bai Tong was an Empyrean powerhouse, his strength was not considered strong among Empyreans.

His most important identity was still an alchemist.

Lu Ziyi nodded slightly and said, “Okay, I’ll give you this chance. Make your move!”

Bai Tong smiled slightly. Waving his hand, he pointed a finger out. The entire void started trembling.

Lu Ziyi’s face revealed a slight look of surprise, but his expression turned to normal very quickly.

It was only to hear her give a delicate cry, her dainty palm smacking out without any mercy.

For a moment, a horrifying power of law was virtually going to punch through space.

Bai Tong’s pupils constricted, immediately feeling tremendous pressure.

Bang!

Two powers of law collided fiercely in the air, Bai Tong’s figure flew out backward.

Lu Ziyi looked at the Bai Tong who fell to the ground and said coolly, “Strength isn’t bad, but t’s just that it’s still a bit lacking.”

Finished talking, she left with her hands behind her back.

Bai Tong gave a bitter laugh, really having a feeling of a tiger who landed in a plain being bullied by a dog. But he still walked into the prison obediently.

...

When Ye Yuan stepped into Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, he immediately detected that something was wrong.

He furrowed his eyebrows but still walked over in the direction of the City Lord Manor.

“Lord Ye Yuan! Lord Ye Yuan came back!” Very soon, the martial artists in the city recognized Ye Yuan, all revealing half hopeful and half fearful faces.

Ye Yuan sensed the peculiarity in their gaze, but he did not pay mind and just answered with a smile.

Suddenly, a young Divine Lord Realm martial artist grabbed hold of Ye Yuan and said anxiously, “Lord Ye Yuan, you can’t go to the City Lord Manor! Hurry up and leave!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, thinking to himself that something indeed happened!

“What happened?” Ye Yuan asked.

The Divine Lord Realm martial artist said, “Your Excellency, don’t care about it! Hurry up and go! It will be too late if you still don’t leave! Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s powerhouses have already surrounded the entire city until not even water can seep through, just waiting for your appearance!”

“Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital?” Ye Yuan was startled in his heart, not expecting that the problem actually came from Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital.

He did not become the Southridge patrolling inspector harboring the mentality of setting up a separatist regime. It was just that making him go to Nine Pledge Imperial Capital to report and pay his respects every day, he could not possibly do it. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

As for Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital, that was naturally even more impossible.

Except, Ye Yuan did not expect that Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital actually intervened in the remote Southridge Ten Cities.

The Divine Lord Realm martial artist nodded and said, “Correct. They sent three middle-stage True God Realm powerhouses to come. Their means are all very formidable. Even that Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse was defeated. Hurry and leave! If still not leaving, it will really be too late.”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted when he heard this. Others did not know Bai Tong’s identity, but Ye Yuan knew. Bai Tong was an Empyrean powerhouse!

Even if matching up against a Fifth Firmament True God, Bao Tong also should not lose.

Being able to defeat Bai Tong, the strength of the people that came this time was really very strong!

But what Ye Yuan was more worried about was still Bai Tong’s safety.

“That Fourth Firmament True God you mentioned, is he alright?” Ye Yuan’s tone gradually turned cold.

The Divine Lord Realm martial artist shook his head and said, “How can this lowly one know such things? Either way, the people from the City Lord Manor and people who are related to Your Excellency have virtually all already fallen into enemy hands; life and death unknown!”

Life and death unknown!

Ye Yuan’s head went buzzing.

Bai Chen, White Light, Leng Qiuling, and Jiang Jadehall, they all were Ye Yuan’s extremely close people.

If they all died, Ye Yuan would really go insane.

“Ye Yuan, it’s true! Hurry and leave! The guards in the city now have all been swapped out. They have probably already gotten the news. If you still don’t go, it will really be too late!” This Divine Lord Realm clearly respected Ye Yuan a lot; his words were full of concern.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and worked hard to calm himself down.

He knew that with this person’s level, it was impossible to know the specifics of the matter.

This incident still had to meet the other party before it could be confirmed.

If ... If someone really died, Ye Yuan would definitely destroy the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital!

Ye Yuan suddenly beamed widely and asked, “Little Brother, what’s your name?”

The Divine Lord Realm martial artist was taken aback and blurted out, “This ... This lowly one is called Jiang Ming.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said smilingly, “Jiang Ming, I’ve remembered it.”

Finished talking, his figure moved, heading straight in the direction of the City Lord Manor.

But right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

A ray of sword light sped over like the wind from ten thousand feet away, arriving in an instant.

But the target was not Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan naturally felt the sword light and abruptly wanted to turn around.

Except, it was already too late.

Bang!

Horrifying law undulations directly obliterated Jiang Ming!

How could a mere Divine Lord Realm powerhouse block a True God’s sword?

“As a Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s citizen, to actually turn traitor and tip people off; truly a commoner! Death isn’t regrettable!”

A sweet-sounding voice closed in from afar.

The voice was so pleasant, but the person’s action was so cruel.
