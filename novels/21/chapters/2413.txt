Chapter 2419: Acknowledging Master!

Ye Yuan ignored him and continued on.

Yue Feng’s expression instantly turned sullen.

This brat was also too condescending!

He, an exalted Deva Fifth Blight supreme formation god, was an existence that tens of thousands admired wherever he went.

But a Heavenly Emperor Realm little fellow actually completely ignored him!

If this could be endured, what else could not be? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He did not say a word, repeatedly pointing at the void, and was about to unleash the power of restrictions.

Reaching this level of realm, every movement and action was array formation.

They did not need to prepare anything when killing the enemy with formations.

What they prepared, were all terrifying to the extreme killing moves.

Even if Ye Yuan reached the level of rank five formation path source, it was no different to him.

But he discovered to his shock that he was actually unable to ignite the surrounding restrictions!

“This ... What in the world is going on? I’ve clearly already understood the mysteries of these restrictions completely! Why can’t I activate it?” Yue Feng’s entire body trembled as he said in disbelief.

But Ye Yuan suddenly stopped at this time, looked towards Yue Feng, and said indifferently, “You wanted to kill me just now?”

Yue Feng’s expression changed wildly. Suddenly, a hint of a ferocious look appeared on his face and he said in a cold voice, “So what if kill you? A brat actually dares to belittle this ancestor deserves the death penalty!”

Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “You, as the human race’s major power, received the human race major power’s imparting of Dao on Eight Void Mountain, but you didn’t think to repay the human race. Someone like you, so what if I belittle you?”

But Yue Feng sneered and said, “What has the human race’s life and death got to do with me? Kid, don’t you be rampant. Killing you, I don’t need this Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions at all!”

Done talking, the imposing aura on his body suddenly shook, a terrifying power suddenly spread out.

The power of a Deva Fifth Blight was sufficient to make heaven and earth change colors!

Let alone using it to kill a Heavenly Emperor Realm junior?

Only to see Yue Feng send a punch over, it was as if the entire Eight Void Mountain started shaking.

Eight Void Mountain was indeed trembling.

Because Ye Yuan moved too!

It was only to see him raise his finger. A pale-yellow light was sent into Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions.

The restrictions above 50,000 miles suddenly activated!

Rumble!

At this moment, it was as if the entire Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions were boiling over!

Yue Feng’s expression changed wildly. He only felt a power that could topple mountains and overturn the seas directly crushed his attack completely. The power struck on his chest.

The Deva Fifth Blight supreme powerhouse fell to the ground seriously injured!

Yue Feng looked at Ye Yuan with a horrified look, his eyes full of fear.

“W-What happened just now? What did you do?” Yue Feng said in alarm and horror.

He felt like he was facing the power of rules just now!

Reaching his level, apart from the power of rules, what else could hurt him?

How could a Heavenly Emperor Realm little fellow mobilize the power of rules?

The power just now was absolutely not just the power of restrictions above 50,000 miles.

He felt as if the entire Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions were rushing to his face!

Ye Yuan looked at Yue Feng coldly and said with a sneer, “I’ll spare your life for now! Want to know what I did, open your dog eyes and take a good look!”

After he finished talking, Ye Yuan ignored Yue Feng and continued walking up.

This scene already shocked all of the powerhouses on Eight Void Mountain!

“Severely wounding Progenitor Yue Feng with one attack; how ... how on earth did he do it?”

“He’s still climbing! Could it be that ... he’s going to climb to the top of Eight Void Mountain?”

“This is impossible! Eight Void Mountain has existed here since ancient times. Since time immemorial, how many peerless geniuses have attempted to reach the summit, but no one has succeeded! What right does he, a puny little Heavenly Emperor Realm, have to reach the summit?”

“Seems like this Eight Void Mountain’s highest record is the 71,000 miles created by Heavenly Emperor Heartless, right? He wouldn’t really be challenging this record, right?”

... ...

At this time, there was already no one comprehending Dao, everyone was paying attention to Ye Yuan.

The current Ye Yuan already surpassed Heavenly Emperor Yue Feng, becoming the present Eight Void Mountain’s number one person!

Then, would he surpass the highest record and really reach the top?”

At this kind of exciting moment, how could they still have the mind to cultivate?

Sure enough, the powerful restrictions above 50,000 miles, Ye Yuan completely regarded them as nothing.

Very soon, he climbed to 60,000 miles!

61,000 miles!

62,000 miles!

... ...

Each step that Ye Yuan took seemed to be stepping on their hearts, making them palpitating with anxiety and fear.

It was already getting closer and closer to 71,000 miles!

Finally, Ye Yuan took a step out and arrived above 71,000 miles!

He surpassed the countless ancient and modern formation path sovereigns, and he reached the highest peak!

The scattered powerhouses on the mountain immediately seethed with excitement.

The record through the ages was broken by a Heavenly Emperor Realm just like that.

This sort of thing, they still did not quite dare to believe it!

But this was merely just the beginning!

Because Ye Yuan was still climbing upward!

He was climbing toward 80,000 miles!

Everyone felt a little hard to breathe. This sort of thing really subverted all of their understanding.

Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun looked at that back view in the distance, all sorts of emotions spilling over in his heart.

Just what kind of existence was he talking to earlier!

Ye Yuan got closer and closer to the summit, increasingly closer.

The entire Eight Void Mountain seemed to be shaking in pace with his rhythm.

Eight Void Mountain Range was trembling under Ye Yuan’s feet!

This earth-shaking restriction seemed to gradually be waking up from a deep sleep.

Walking along the way, Ye Yuan also felt an upsurge of emotion.

He did not expect that Grand Ancestor Skyformation actually comprehended such a vast and unfathomable terrifying grand array based on his legacy.

At this time, what was wandering around him was a force that was hard to describe.

This power was not something that one could explain clearly and make people understand, but also really existed.

As if the source of all Formation Dao came from this power.

Ye Yuan understood that this was Formation Dao rule!

The power of rules towered above everything!

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, it was naturally impossible to reach the summit.

But Ye Yuan was different from the others.

Walking along the way, he had been releasing his own power of source!

He was searching for resonance with the Eight Void Mountain’s grand array!

In other words, he was trying to awaken the entire Eight Void Mountain’s grand array!

Arriving above 50,000 miles, the entire Eight Void Mountain’s grand array seemingly already acknowledged Ye Yuan’s existence.

The situation was as if it was acknowledging a master.

The entire process was like Ye Yuan was refining the Eight Void Mountain grand array!

But Yue Feng wanted to kill Ye Yuan in front of the Eight Void Mountain. Wasn’t this him seeking death?

In a twinkle, Ye Yuan was only a hundred steps away from the summit.

Ye Yuan could even see the situation on top of the mountain already.

That place had nine ghostly fires of different colors. They were operating on their own with some sort of magical power; lasting!

A power that was as vast as the firmament transmitted from there, and actually made Ye Yuan somewhat have the impulse to prostrate in worship too.

However, his body released an even more terrifying power very soon, suppressing this power.

“This is the true power of rules?” Ye Yuan looked at those nine ghostly fires as he muttered.

At this time, he arrived before the ghostly fires without the slightest hesitation and reached his hand over.

Rumble!

The entire Eight Void Mountain started trembling violently!
