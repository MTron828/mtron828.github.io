Chapter 2158: Immense Grief

“Not good! Spatial collapse!

Feeling that intense energy undulation, Long Xiao’s face turned white with a whoosh.

His figure suddenly moved, virtually arriving at a certain area among the spatial rifts in an instant.

However, it was already too late!

Once a spatial collapse occurred, it was like a domino effect. The energy undulation that was setting off became stronger and stronger.

Even he, this Fourth Firmament Empyrean, once he got caught inside, it would be certain death too.

“Ye Yuan!”

Long Xiao’s heart suddenly ached, as if his heart was being rended.

Among these subordinates, Long Xi followed him the longest, and the relationship was also the deepest.

Long Xiao never dreamed of this situation. When facing the encirclement and suppression of countless Heavenly Emperor and Empyrean powerhouses, they could even escape alive, but today, they would actually die here!

Died at the hands of a brat who just entered Empyrean!

“Is it very painful?” A figure walked out of the void, his face full of coldness.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Long Xiao’s two eyes turned bloodshot and he gritted his teeth and said, “Punk, this Empyrean will definitely rip you apart today!”

Long Xiao raised his saber and arrived in an instant!

The powerful blade light virtually tore space apart.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s figure dodged slightly, and he disappeared right before Long Xiao’s eyes.

“For so many years, you guys and Ao Xu have worked in cahoots, butchering how many of your same kind? Have you ever thought about ... whether their family members would feel pain or not? I have no grudge nor enmity with you guys, but you want to ambush us. Since that’s the case, then you’ll have to be prepared for my vengeance! Relax, the game has just started.”

Ye Yuan walked out of another folded layer of space, his words full of frostiness.

Long Xiao this group of people had their hands stained with fresh blood. Ye Yuan did not have any psychological restraint when killing them.

If not for his numerous means, he would definitely die at Long Xiao’s hands today.

Once Ye Yuan was enraged, the consequences were very terrifying.

Now, Long Xiao tasted the bitter fruit.

However, Long Xiao had more rage currently, it was the fury of not being content with anything less than his destruction.

Long Xiao raised his blade and chased after Ye Yuan. But unfortunately, in this spatial rift that he was incomparably familiar with, he was like a headless fly, being led by the nose by Ye Yuan, running around everywhere.

Occasionally, he would intrude into a layer of folded space, but seeing his subordinates’ corpse, his eyes could not help turning bloodshot from anger.

Apart from Long Xi that squad being completely wiped out, the other teams were already thoroughly broken up by Ye Yuan and Long Xiaochun two people as well.

A powerful besieging team became all alone by themselves now.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, killing a lone Second Firmament Empyrean was not a hard thing.

A carefully planned encirclement evolved into a one-sided massacre in the end.

Long Xiao’s heart was dripping blood, these Empyreans were all old brothers who have followed him for hundreds of thousands of years, braving through wind and rain together, living days on the edge of danger before there was today.

He did not expect that all of them fell here today, right at their own doorstep.

Just as Ye Yuan said, he finally felt the taste of pain!

Long Xiao had a body full of powerful strength, but in this area of spatial rifts, there was no room for him to unleash his ability at all.

His saber had just raised up and Ye Yuan already vanished.

But in half a day, the 17 to 18 Empyreans that Long Xiao brought over only had a scanty few people left.

“Ye Yuan, come out for me! If you have the capabilities, have an open and above-board showdown with me!” Long Xiao roared at the depths of the void.

“B-Boss!” Suddenly, a voice sounded out behind.

Long Xiao turned his head to look, it was the Long Zhao whose two eyes were thoroughly red.

His eyes were not red from killing, but red from crying.

One brother after another dying made Long Zhao mourn endlessly.

“Long Zhao! I finally found you! Follow me! Make sure not to leave. When we see that little brute, you and I work together, we can definitely kill him!” Long Xiao gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Long Zhao’s eyes were red as he said, “Boss, are we still fighting? S-Surrender!”

Long Xiao’s gaze turned cold and he said in a chilly voice, “So many brothers have died, but you’re asking me to surrender? If I don’t carve that punk up into a thousand pieces today, I, Long Xiao, swear that I’m lesser than human!”

“But we can’t find him at all! He understands this region of space like the back of his hand and even comes and goes freely the deep layers of space. His spatial law has reached rank six at the minimum!”

Long Zhao already did not have any temper. What was terrifying was not a powerful opponent, but an opponent that you could not understand at all.

Could not even catch the other party’s shadow, how to fight still?

Long Xiao’s expression was livid too. Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s figure flashed, and Long Xiao said in a cold voice, “Chase!”

Swoosh!

Space fluctuated, it suddenly became clear before his eyes.

At this place, cherry blossoms were in full bloom, a small stream flowed past some cottages, young children horsed around in the village. It was actually a retreat away from the turmoil of the world.

Far away, Long Xiaochun was currently playing with a few children in great delight.

But Long Xiao’s expression changed wildly!

He stared fixedly at the Ye Yuan standing in the air far away and said in a cold voice, “Boy, what do you want to do?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept across the village, a hint of gentleness flashing across his eyes.

“Surrender,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ye Yuan traversed through the void and unintentionally discovered this place.

Only then did he know. It turned out this was Long Xiao’s den.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that Long Xiao and the rest killed and pillaged outside, committing all kinds of atrocities, it was actually for the sake of this otherworldly paradise.

Originally, Ye Yuan was planning on directly entrapping Long Xiao they all to death in the void.

With Ye Yuan’s spatial law attainments, even if he could not kill Long Xiao, he still had assurance for the others.

Even if it was a Third Firmament Empyrean, under Ye Yuan’s sneak attack, it was very hard to survive too.

But now, he changed his mind.

The hand that Long Xiao held his saber trembled lightly.

Clearly, he was struggling fiercely in his heart. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Boss! Give up! We have no chances of victory!” Long Zhao said with reddened eyes.

Long Xiao looked at Ye Yuan and gritted his teeth and said, “How do I know whether he’ll strike to kill or not after surrendering?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I want to deal a killing blow, it wouldn’t be such a situation now.”

Long Xiao’s pupils constricted, immediately understanding Ye Yuan’s meaning.

If Ye Yuan was a mindless butcher of innocent people, or someone who was callous and merciless, he should have threatened with the lives of women and children currently, and not stand here talking to him perfectly well.

Clearly, that way of directly threatening was more effective.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Several figures suddenly dashed out, it was Long Ming and the others.

When they saw this scene, their expressions immediately changed dramatically.

Ye Yuan actually found their lair!

Their lair was extremely hidden, it had never been exposed before for so many years. Did not expect that it was actually found by Ye Yuan.

“B-Boss!” Long Ming also said, seemingly rather parched.

Suddenly, Long Xiao’s hand loosened up. That heavy short blade dropped down at a high speed, sticking into the soil with a clank.

Thud!

Long Xiao directly knelt in front of Ye Yuan in the air and said with gritted teeth, “Long Xiao had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai and offended Lord Dragon Son. I hope that Your Excellency punishes! I only hope that Your Excellency lifts your hand high up in mercy and let the people of Dragon Source Village go!”

As he said, Long Xiao directly sealed his divine sea and became a cripple.

Seeing Long Ming like this, the rest no longer had the will to fight, throwing down their weapons one after another, and kneeling in front of Ye Yuan.

“Your Excellency please lift your hand high up in mercy! We’re willing to take the punishment!”
