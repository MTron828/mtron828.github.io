Chapter 2641: Senior!

“A few brats who are still wet behind their ears actually dares to steal our merfolk tribe’s treasure? Simply tired of living! Do you all think that you can leave after stealing the treasure? In this ocean, our true spirit sea race is the true king!”

An enormous merfolk was galloping on the surface of the sea, riding the wind and waves, akin to flat land.

Their speed was actually several times faster than this large ship!

They were unbelievably stinky. But the fury on their faces currently was evident to all.

These few fellows actually robbed their Treasure Depository Pavilion!

What was even more aggravating was that there was actually also the merfolk clan’s sacred item in it!

Under their fury, the merfolk tribe dispatched large numbers of troops and chased after.

As far as the eyes could see, it was full of fish heads into the distance.

There was a dense and black mass, unable to see any end in sight.

Roughly counting, there were likely no fewer than several thousand!

These thousands of merfolk, the vast majority were Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, but there were also quite a few hundred that were Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

And these few people on the boat, only Su Peiyun and Huang Haoyan were upper Greater Sublime Heaven.

The others were all middle Greater Sublime Heaven.

Once caught up, they would be dead for sure/

“This … What to do here? We … We’re dead for sure!”

“Damn it, how did they find out so quickly? With the few of our strength, we’d definitely be dead beyond a doubt if caught up!” Huang Haoyan swept a glance over everyone and said in a solemn voice.

As for the man in white clothing, he was directly overlooked by him.

A middle Greater Sublime Heaven, what use could he be of?

“Big Brother Yan, didn’t you lure away 3000 seafolk previously? Why don’t you try luring away again?” Su Peiyun suddenly looked at Huang Haoyan, her eyes full of hope.

Huang Haoyan’s face turned black, and he nearly cussed out.

He merely made use of some methods before to gain an advantage by trickery.

Actually, he did not dare to show his face at all.

Got to be joking!

One person luring a few thousand people, even if he grew ten heads, it would not be enough to chop either.

“Peiyun, you aren’t aware. After I use that method, I need half a month before I can use it again! Right now … sigh!” Huang Haoyan told a fib.

Su Peiyun did not suspect anything either, but the sense of loss in her eyes could not be concealed no matter what.

The man in white said, “That … I have a way. But I don’t know if it will work or not.”

Su Peiyun smiled coldly when she heard that and said, “Even Big Brother Yan has no way, then what method can you, a measly little middle Greater Sublime Heaven have? Don’t annoy me!”

Toward this brainless fellow, Su Peiyun found him displeasing to the eye no matter how she looked at him.

Running to the Thistle South Sea Region all by himself. In the end, he could not even find where north was.

What method could this kind of moron possibly have?

As for taking out these incredible heavenly pills, the few people guessed that this fellow was probably some alchemy great family’s descendant.

It was just that he did not bring his brain out of the house.

Rather, it was Huang Haoyan who suddenly spoke up, “Treat a dead horse tentatively as if it was still alive! Peiyun, let’s hear it?”

Su Peiyun was anxious in her heart, but also had no plans and could only nod her head.

Huang Haoyan said in a solemn voice, “What idea you have, quickly say it!”

The man in white said,?“Uh?… run!”

Everyone fell down!

Freaking hell … what kind of crap idea was this?

Still need you to say run?

Huang Haoyan felt a wave of anger from being played and said in a great rage, “Punk, you’re messing with me?”

The man in white smiled and said, “What I mean is, let’s run first. After I recover strength, I’ll have a way.”

As he said, the man in white ignored everyone’s strange gazes and went to meditate in a corner of the deck by himself.

Huang Haoyan was angered until he ground his teeth, but now was not the time to blow his top.

Running was number one!

He gritted his teeth and said, “Peiyun, throw all of the sea spirit pearls obtained this time into the array formation! Activate the array formation to the highest setting! There’s only this method now!”

Su Peiyun bit her lips lightly. Finally, she still nodded her head.

The sea spirit pearl was a specialty of the true spirit sea race. Consuming one was equivalent to ten years of bitter cultivation!

They plundered the merfolk clan’s lair this time and obtained a large quantity of sea spirit pearls. Originally, they planned on using it to break through.

In the end, they had no choice but to use them to flee now.

Sure enough, the moment the sea spirit pearls were thrown into the array formation, the speed of the ship soared at once.

Although it still did not compare to those merfolk, they could not catch up in a short time.

Only then did Huang Haoyan and the rest heave a sigh in relief.

Su Peiyun looked at Ye Yuan and said in a great rage, “You this fellow, getting on the boat without our permission. Now, you’re still acting completely fine here! How can you be so shameless?”

This man in white was precisely Ye Yuan.

That strike from the Pill Alliance’s Alliance Chief made him almost die.

The shattered void practically tore him apart.

Fortunately, at the critical moment, Ye Yuan comprehended the second level of spatial rule, that was how he escaped by a fluke.

Even so, he drifted in the void for two months too, before he finally got out.

However, he arrived in a foreign place, all around him being the ocean!

Suddenly descending upon Thistle South Sea Region, Ye Yuan had a stunned face.

It was all the same all around!

Helpless, Ye Yuan could only randomly find a direction and proceed all the way.

But, he ran into heaps and heaps of sea monsters along the way. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The moment these sea monsters saw him, they pounced over to kill him without heed for their lives.

Furthermore, these sea monsters were extremely strong.

This sea was their natural battlefield.

In this place, they far surpassed same rank humans. Their strength could not be underestimated.

But unfortunately, they ran into Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan killed all the way over, killing for a month’s time before finally seeing Huang Haoyan and the rest.

In the end, he did not expect that this bunch of guys were even more of a troublemaker, provoking a clan of sea monsters!

Seeing Su Peiyun fly off the handle, Huang Haoyan frowned and said, “Peiyun, now isn’t the time to haggle over this! If we can get out by chance, it won’t be too late to denounce him publicly then!”

When Su Peiyun saw Huang Haoyan speak, she was very obedient.

But she was full of unhappiness when she looked at Ye Yuan.

“You … You guys, quickly look ahead!” At this time, a companion suddenly cried out in surprise.

When Huang Haoyan heard that, he was greatly surprised. Could it be that there was true spirit sea race obstructing in front too?

If that was the case, they would really be dead for sure.

However, he looked in the direction pointed by his companion and immediately had a stupefied look.

There were corpses of the seafolk everywhere on the surface of the sea!

The undulations coming off of some corpses were very powerful, enough to be grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven!

Suddenly, Huang Haoyan’s eyes lit up and he said, “Could it be that there was a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum senior who passed by here? If we can find him, there will be hope of surviving!”

Su Peiyun’s eyes also lit up, and she came in front of Ye Yuan and questioned, “Hey! You came from this direction earlier, right? Did you encounter any senior?”

Ye Yuan was still regulating his breathing and ignored her.

When Su Peiyun saw that Ye Yuan did not even pay attention to her, she immediately flew into a great rage!

“Punk, we kindly took you in, but in the end, you actually put on airs on the boat! Do you really think that this young lady doesn’t dare to kill you?”

Under her fury, Su Peiyun suddenly smacked a palm over.

But it hit nothing.

Ye Yuan’s body was already standing on the side of the ship.

He already finished recuperating!

His strength recovered to its peak again!

Ye Yuan turned to Su Peiyun and smiled as he said, “I didn’t encounter any senior. But I have a way now!”
