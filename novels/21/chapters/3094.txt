Chapter 3093: Chaos Grade Bloodline’s Power!

Boom!

An intense rumble reverberated throughout the entire blood cloud space.

The place that Ye Yuan was standing at was virtually engulfed in an instant, disappearing without a trace.

The terrifying pressure of the four symbols true spirits also completely vanished under this combined attack.

Chi Shang felt akin to being relieved of a heavy burden and said, “I really didn’t expect that killing a measly little Emperor Sakra Heaven actually needed this seat to use Wrath of the Blood God! With this, without a thousand years of cultivation, I can forget about recovering to my peak state!”

Meanwhile, You Lei and Meng Jin, two people who had wilted auras, their conditions were far worse than before.

In this final strike, they exerted all of their strength too.

“Luckily, the mission is considered complete! Our blood race has eliminated a great calamity in our hearts!” Meng Jin said with some lingering fear.

Before this, he absolutely would not have admitted that a measly little Emperor Sakra Heaven would be the hidden danger in the blood race’s heart, even if this person was so and so monstrous in the rumors.

But now, he was in great admiration with Progenitor and Lord Yi Xue’s cautiousness.

...

While Chi Shang was very careful and said, “Meng Jin, go and confirm it!”

Meng Jin nodded his head and headed towards that cloud of mist.

Right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

That cloud of mist actually suddenly started to spin, forming an energy vortex.

The vortex grew larger and larger and increasingly stronger.

In a twinkle, the energy vortex started to devour the Bloodcloud Grand Array’s power.

Countless red lights were sucked in by the energy vortex.

Chi Shang’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in alarm, “This … What’s going on here?”

You Lei said in shock, “The Bloodcloud Grand Array’s power is actually being drawn away! Could it be that that boy didn’t die?”

Just as they were speaking, a figure gradually appeared in the energy vortex. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

Not only did Ye Yuan not die, furthermore his strength at this time was currently rising rapidly!

Chi Shang was dumbfounded and said, “Is … Is he breaking through? He’s absorbing the Bloodcloud Grand Array’s power to break through? G-Got to be kidding?”

The energy of blood could only be absorbed by the blood race.

Once powerhouses of other races absorbed it, their own origins would also be corrupted. Not only would they be unable to break through, but it would also even sever their cultivation path.

But now, Ye Yuan was actually absorbing the energy of blood!

Inside the vortex, Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “The Dao of Blood is a Great Dao, it isn’t exclusive to your blood race! My four great bloodlines have just stepped into chaos grade, and just happen to need the nourishment of these energies of blood. Thanks a lot! Yi Xue carefully planned this assassination. But he did not expect he actually gave me a big gift, right?”

The hearts of Chi Shang three people sank to rock-bottom.

This guy was actually using the energy of blood that they bitterly collected to strengthen himself!

Only to see that there were four small and exquisite four great true spirits in front of Ye Yuan’s chest, currently slowly rotating.

Those energies of blood that were absorbed were currently pouring into their bodies!

And Ye Yuan’s aura also rose immensely during this.

“We can’t let him break through! Kill again!”

Chi Shang knew that things were amiss, and he used another Wrath of the Blood God without hesitation!

Although You Lei and Meng Jin were somewhat short on strength, they could not care that much at this time either, overdrawing on the power of origin and smashing toward Ye Yuan without heed for their lives.

Except, the power of their moves was much worse compared to earlier.

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “Even your strongest moves couldn’t kill me. Isn’t it too laughable to come and try to kill me again now? Just nice, I can use you all to measure the power of chaos grade bloodline!”

In the vortex, the pressure on Ye Yuan’s burst forth once more!

This time, the pressure of the bloodlines made the entire space tremble!

Innate chaos grade bloodline, furthermore, it was four types of bloodlines combining, in terms of level, it was already completely not worse than Progenitor Bloodstone.

The only thing that Ye Yuan was lacking in was just level of attainment!

But, facing Chi Shang these three people, it was enough!

The bloodline power of the four symbols phantoms gathered on Ye Yuan’s fist.

Ye Yuan threw a punch out. The terrifying saint force exploded like an erupting volcano!

Before even clashing, Chi Shang already felt the pressure that blotted out the skies and covered the earth.

“Four Symbols … Heading for Sainthood!”

This punch of Ye Yuan’s slammed right toward Meng Jin.

Meng Jin only felt like the sky was going to collapse!

The ultimate move that he overdrew on origin power to use was like paper paste in front of Ye Yuan’s punch.

Boom!

A loud noise.

Meng Jin’s body was directly turned into nothingness.

He was directly obliterated by that powerful saint force!

Meanwhile, Chi Shang and You Lei were directly sent flying away by this tremendous force.

Their ultimate moves were directly dispersed!

Chi Shang and You Lei looked at Ye Yuan at the same time, shock and horror on their faces.

The power of this punch was also too terrifying, right?

This kind of punch, if it was thrown out by a Hegemon Realm, they would not be surprised at all.

But Ye Yuan was just Emperor Sakra Heaven! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Chaos grade bloodline was actually utterly horrifying!

Killing a Hegemon Realm with one punch, this kind of strength, even if it was Hegemon Realms, it could not be done too!

Blood race Hegemons were notorious for being hard to kill.

Their recovery ability was more than ten thousand times of Emperor Sakra Heaven’s!

Wanting to thoroughly kill blood race Hegemons was virtually something impossible.

But Ye Yuan did it!

For a moment, the two people actually did not dare to step forward anymore.

But, they could not get out of this Bloodcloud Grand Array too!

The current state was really awkward.

When Ye Yuan broke through his realm, he would definitely kill them without the slightest hesitation.

This was also to say that they were quietly awaiting death.

This kind of sensation really made people despair.

Ye Yuan withdrew his fist, very satisfied with the power of this punch.

The lethality of saint force was indeed not what ordinary origins could compare to.

This kind of power that originated from the Door of Eternal Life was extremely mysterious.

No one could say clearly what it was.

But it was just powerful.

Being able to jump realms and battle, what Ye Yuan relied on was naturally this.

After breaking through to chaos grade bloodline, Ye Yuan could clearly feel that the four great bloodlines underwent a transformation from quantitative to qualitative.

Even if it was an independent bloodline, the power could not even be mentioned in the same breath.

No wonder the four great true spirit clans had always been the 33 Heavens’ top race.

If not for Heavenless, Samsara, and Progenitor Bloodstone, these freaks emerging, Mi Tian would be in that apex group in this world.

“After I broke through, I should have the strength to fight with Peak Hegemons, right?” Ye Yuan said a little excitedly.

The energy vortex grew larger and larger. The Bloodcloud Grand Array started trembling.

Chi Shang and You Lei looked at each other, the look in their eyes becoming more and more seemingly in despair.

A day later, the vortex dissipated. Ye Yuan walked out of it.

At this time, he already reached upper Emperor Sakra Heaven and was only a step away from grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven!

When he reached grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven, Ye Yuan would be able to bombard the Door of Eternal Life, and assault that fleeting and ephemeral realm of Hegemon!

Seeing Ye Yuan walk over, Chi Shang and You Lei completely broke down.

“Even … Even if you kill us, you can’t get out of the Bloodcloud Grand Array too! When you go out, Lord Yi Xue will already be waiting for you!” Chi Shang said, threatening in manner but inwardly shaky.

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Is that so? Then, I’ll go out first before killing you guys, alright?”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan raised a fist, saint force encircling, and he struck at the horizon!

Boom!

A deafening rumble that shocked the ears could be heard. A huge hole was actually punched out by him!

Chi Shang’s two eyes became wide saucers, and he said in disbelief, “This … How is this possible?”
