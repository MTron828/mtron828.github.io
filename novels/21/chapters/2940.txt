Chapter 2939: The terrifying Cloudneon!

The laughter stopped abruptly!

Because Feng Rui already felt one burning gaze after another.

The moment he lowered his head, sure enough, he saw that disgusting face appearing in his eyes again!

This … How was this possible?

Forget about a True Sovereign Heaven; even if it was an Emperor Vast Heaven, they would be refined in his lightning sea without the least bit of resistance too!

But Ye Yuan was actually completely fine?

C-Could it be that this guy actually really has the Imperishable Soul Physique?

Feng Rui jumped in fright at this sudden thought.

This was impossible! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hegemon Imperishable, that was a paramount existence.

How could an ant possibly awaken the same soul physique as him?

“Since you want to see me revive so much, I’ll revive again for you to see then,” Ye Yuan looked at Feng Rui and said with a radiant smile.

Feng Rui nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood!

This guy was really detestable to the extreme!

F*ck your sister! Your Father waited 15 minutes for you, and you can really endure!

“Oh,?right, what other more formidable methods do you have? I feel that I shouldn’t have reached my limits yet.” Ye Yuan continued.

Feng Rui was speechless.

What else could I say?

This guy is definitely doing it on purpose!

Didn’t you see that Your Father was very weak now?

Even the Five Lightning Execution could not exterminate Ye Yuan. He was really out of ideas.

After making a show of force for half a day, he became a complete and utter joke!

“Alright, let’s end it here! Ye Yuan, are you willing to acknowledge me as your master?” Cloudneon looked at Ye Yuan and said calmly.

“Not willing!” Ye Yuan said without hesitation.

The expressions of Eastsun and the rest turned stiff, almost jumping up.

This guy was insane, right?

“Ye Yuan, Lord Cloudneon is a top powerhouse in the Imperishable Soul Domain. Being able to go under her tutelage is your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!” Eastsun said agitatedly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what? I gave her the chance. It’s her who didn’t cherish it! Since she felt it beneath her to care about my life and death, I naturally won’t stoop to going under her tutelage too.”

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s soul body directly exploded, turning into nothingness.

A moment later, Ye Yuan revived.

Cloudneon opened her mouth and said coolly, “How about now?”

Ye Yuan’s face turned black, and he said, “You’re dreaming!”

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s soul body collapsed again!

A moment later, Ye Yuan revived again.

“Then what about now?” Cloudneon opened her mouth for the third time.

“Fine, I’m willing!” Ye Yuan decided that a wise man should not fight when the odds were against him.

Actually, Ye Yuan was compelled against his will.

Because the instant that he merged into heaven and earth, he discovered that Cloudneon had glanced at him.

Just this glance and Ye Yuan immediately decided to acknowledge her as master!

Very clearly, the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was not truly invincible!

At least, this woman had the ability to kill him!

This woman’s strength was unfathomable.

Ye Yuan estimated that her strength was likely not beneath Eldest Senior Brother, Li Clearcloud.

The so-called Hegemon Imperishable was just because his strength was too formidable; hence, nobody could kill him.

How was there true imperishable in this world?

However, this Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was clearly really very formidable and still had a lot of space for exploration.

Acknowledging her as a master, everyone was happy.

The only one who was sulking unhappily was Feng Rui.

“Senior Apprentice Brother, you have an Imperishable Soul Physique junior apprentice brother, shouldn’t you be happy?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Feng Rui “… …”

“Senior Apprentice Brother, I’m someone who bears grudges a lot!”

“… …”

Cloudneon ignored Ye Yuan and said to Eastsun, “This time, Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall has rendered merit and will be rewarded one soul canon and three sets of mystic arts!”

Eastsun and the rest were overjoyed, immediately bowing and saying, “Many thanks, Lord Cloudneon!”

Soul path records were extremely precious things in the outside world.

Things that came out of Imperishable Soul Domain were naturally not ordinary.

Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall had struck gold!

… …

Returning to the Imperishable Soul Domain, Feng Rui went into a closed-seclusion.

Along the way with Ye Yuan, the scene was very awkward.

This was an enormous palace complex, akin to the mortal world’s palaces.

It was just that the scale and grandeur were more than a hundred times compared to the imperial palace.

The Imperishable Soul Domain was the holy land of the Nirvanic Soul Clan.

Just like the Labyrinth Divine Palace and Blood God Temple, ordinary people were unable to discover its true location.

This large region of space was clearly hewed open by Hegemon major powers with a great divine ability.

After ordering attendants to leave, there were only Cloudneon and Ye Yuan two people left in the room.

This ten-thousand-year-ice-like woman had peerlessly beautiful looks, but she gave people a feeling of keeping strangers at bay.

“Speak! What objective do you have for forcibly bringing me to the Imperishable Soul Domain?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

His words did not hold the slightest respect for his master.

Cloudneon’s face still did not have any fluctuations as she said lightly, “You’re very smart.”

Thinking about it, she added, “Even smarter than Feng Rui.”

Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “You’re comparing me to a moron? You’re insulting me!”

Cloudneon was indifferent and said coolly, “He’s very smart.”

Ye Yuan said, “Just an idiot who only knows how to cultivate. Use your behind to think, and you’d also know that I’m waiting for him to posture. In the end, he really went to posture.”

Cloudneon was speechless.

I’m actually at a loss for a reply.

She knew that what Ye Yuan said was right.

Feng Rui was indeed a genius. It was just that he was completely focused on cultivation.

This kind of people, unless they used strength to crush their opponents.

Otherwise, they could only still be counting money for people after being sold by them.

“Alright, enough rubbish. I indeed need your help for something.” A rare solemn expression appeared on Cloudneon’s face.

Ye Yuan said, “Go on. I’ve fallen into the devil’s claws now and can only be at your disposal.”

Cloudneon was speechless again.

She suddenly discovered that it was somewhat hard to communicate with this person.

“Progenitor Imperishable is missing!” After a long time, Cloudneon suddenly revealed a piece of earth-shattering news.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What has Progenitor Imperishable going missing got to do with me? Wanting to worry, it should also be the business of you all, these origin powerhouses, right?”

He had a smile on his face, but Ye Yuan’s heart was burning with anxiety.

Because one of the soul race’s three great sacred artifacts, the Purple Ripple Umbrella, was in the hands of Hegemon Imperishable.

This trip to the soul race was actually riddled with difficulties for Ye Yuan.

It was just that he had to come.

But who would have expected that even though he racked his brain to come here, what he obtained was actually such news?

Hegemon Imperishable went missing. Didn’t that mean that the Purple Ripple Umbrella also went missing along with him?

Cloudneon looked at Ye Yuan just like that and said coolly, “I don’t care what purpose you came to the soul race for. As long as you can help this seat find Hegemon Imperishable, I can spare your life! Also, your fetters with your original body can’t be completely severed! Unless you forget your original self’s identity and start over!”

Cloudneon said it calmly and collectedly. Coupled with that peerlessly beautiful face of her, it even gave people a feeling of gladdening the heart and pleasing to the eye.

But Ye Yuan felt a chill run down his spine.

Turns out that everything about him was seen through by this woman!

Ye Yuan was firstly shocked, but later, he felt at ease too.

If his guess was correct, what this woman cultivated was probably the soul race’s sacred canon too!

Only a sacred canon on the same level could see through his actual situation.

What she said was right. Ye Yuan cut off the bonds and transformed into a soul denizen.

But that was not all.

This soul clone still had to return to the main body in the end.

If it was completely cut off, that would be another new life. It would no longer have any connections to his original self.
