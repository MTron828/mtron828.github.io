Chapter 3003: Reversing Cultivation method!

“What is this kid doing? He … He broke down his Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique and divine sense transformed into myriad? Is he crazy?” Long Jian exclaimed.

But by the side, Long Ran smiled and said, “You’re the crazy one! This kid had a grand awakening the moment he saw chaos! There are millions of origin seeds in his Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique. He’s going to have his divine sense transformed into myriad, each portion comprehending origin! When he reaches grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven, myriad origins returning to one, he might be able to break through the law of countless tens of thousands of years, becoming the first divergent cultivator Hegemon!”

When Long Jian heard, he could not help being dumbfounded.

Only then did he remember that Ye Yuan was a divergent cultivator!

Since time immemorial, nobody had ever stepped into the realm of Hegemon as a divergent cultivator.

Without carrying out an extraordinary method, how could one do something extraordinary?

Long Jian was unconvinced and said, “Doing so, he’ll definitely suffer a great loss in strength! Forget about Hegemon Realm. Even if it’s Emperor Vast Heaven, he probably can’t reach it too!”

But Long Ran was indifferent and said, “Since this boy dares to do so, he must be prepared. You just watch.”

This divine sense transformed into myriad was different from Ye Yuan cutting his soul into two back then.

Divine sense transforming into myriad, this was thoroughly stripping away his human soul clone, forming myriad of clones.

The loss to the origin divinity was irreversible.

Sure enough, after Ye Yuan’s divine sense transformed into myriad, his entire person seemed to be drained, directly dropping two major realms, and was only Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But, in the next second, something even more shocking happened.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was dropping at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Long Jian’s eyeballs almost popped out, and he exclaimed, “What the hell is this kid doing? He … He’s actually going to disperse his cultivation?”

With this, Long Ran was shocked too, was this abandoning himself to despair?

Putting aside crippling his human soul clone, he even took the initiative to disperse his cultivation?

Carry on dispersing like this, wouldn’t he directly drop to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum?

“This kid can really make a mess! Putting aside that he turned Blood Dragon Island upside down, he even dared to rebut Progenitor Mi Tian. Now, this guy just entered the Eternal River, and he turned the atmosphere foul everywhere! You look at the others. They don’t have the mood to gain enlightenment on Dao anymore. They are all looking at him,” Long Jian said speechlessly.

With Ye Yuan causing such a big commotion, how could those geniuses who jumped into the Eternal River still be in the mood to cultivate?

Even those Hegemon Realm powerhouses who were prepared to gain enlightenment on Dao were all not in a hurry to go down anymore as well.

No matter who came to the Eternal River, the first thing was definitely to borrow the Eternal River’s power of chaos, to break through their own shackles.

But Ye Yuan was good, directly severing his own origin divinity in half, and immediately dispersed his cultivation afterward.

Freaking hell, how impressive!

“What is this kid doing? His divine sense transforming into myriad, I can still understand that. But what’s the meaning of dispersing his cultivation?”

“Carry on dispersing like this, he’ll become a good-for-nothing!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Cultivation realm retrograding in the Eternal River, Ye Yuan is probably the first person through the ages!”

“Heh,?this kid is completely courting death! Origin divinity is greatly damaged, and he’s still dispersing his cultivation. He wouldn’t think that he can still cultivate it back, right?”

“Trying to impress people by doing something sensational? Does he think that it’s very awesome like this?”

… …

Many Hegemon Realms turned their noses up at Ye Yuan’s way of doing things.

How high were their horizons?

Ye Yuan was equivalent to piling injuries on top of injuries like this. It would cause irreversible damage to his cultivation realm.

He had basically cut off his own path of martial arts.

But Ye Yuan could not hear the outside world’s discussions a long time ago.

He had already entered a realm of forgetting everything and himself. His thoughts were running at an extreme speed.

A brand new cultivation method was constructed in his mind.

Scattering cultivation was in order to cultivate anew and also in order to create a cultivation method!

The Wordless Heavenly Skill was indeed a powerful to the extreme cultivation method in the 33 Heavens.

But, after Ye Yuan’s grand awakening, it was clearly not suitable anymore.

This path was clearly a dead end. If he still continued walking, that would be moronic.

When he just entered Heavenly Stratum, Ye Yuan’s horizons were too shallow. The Wordless Heavenly Skill was no different from a heavenly book to him.

But now, he had seen before God knows how many Hegemon Realms, and he had almost lost himself once in the origin sea too.

His current horizons were naturally different.

Entering the Eternal River and feeling the authenticity of chaos, Ye Yuan instantly understood it.

The Wordless Heavenly Skill was very powerful. Ye Yuan could not deny this.

It was also precisely because the Wordless Heavenly Skill was powerful that Ye Yuan could take many less detours.

Such as now, taking the initiative to scatter his cultivation, he was actually reversing his cultivation method.

Since Hegemon Chaos’ path was going the reverse way, then he would just inverse it!

But Ye Yuan also added his own comprehension in the middle of this, perfecting this new cultivation method and making his future path go further.

In merely one month plus, Ye Yuan fell to Jade Sovereign Heaven Realm.

The greater part of a month passed again. Ye Yuan directly fell to Sovereign Realm.

Half a year later, Ye Yuan no longer had a trace of divine essence undulation on his body, his cultivation realm directly returning to when he just entered Heavenly Stratum.

Three years later, people had already given up on Ye Yuan.

He was already destined to become trash.

“Hahaha?… I regained my martial arts path! I … I’m finally not a good-for-nothing anymore!?Sniff sniff?…” An East Billow Region genius was crying with joy.

“I found it too! I found it too! Ten thousand years! I didn’t expect that I could cultivate again!”

“I broke through! Your Father had a nirvanic rebirth. This time, nobody can stop my Hegemonic path!”

… …

In the East Billow, one East Billow Region genius after another were inexplicably excited.

Nothing was more stirring than finding your path of Martial Dao again.

“We can regain a new lease of life all because of Brother Ye! How is he now? This …”

People remembered Ye Yuan and could not resist searching for Ye Yuan’s figure in the Eternal River.

The moment they saw him, they stopped talking.

Ye Yuan was currently exactly like an ordinary person.

“How can this be? Brother Ye he … is completely crippled?”

“It doesn’t make sense. Why did he cripple his own cultivation?”

“Could it be that Brother Ye has some plan?”

“To cultivate from the beginning, who has such great willpower? Furthermore, dispersing cultivation causes tremendous deterioration to one’s Dao foundation. It’s virtually severing his road ahead. What plans can he have?”

… …

Seeing Ye Yuan’s ‘miserable’ appearance, their hearts ached to the extreme, all lamenting for Ye Yuan.

They radiated with vitality anew, but Ye Yuan had thoroughly become a cripple.

This situation was not what they were willing to see.

Long Jian nodded his head in approval and said, “The effect is better than I imagined. There are actually over 500 people who found their path of Martial Dao again! Looks like there are really quite a few fine saplings in this batch! After grooming, there might really be those who can achieve Hegemon Realm.”

Originally, Long Jian they all estimated that it would be pretty good if there could be 200 people who regained their path of martial arts.

Now, there were actually more than 500 of them, being more than double of what he estimated. Furthermore, the numbers were still growing continuously. This made Long Jian overjoyed.

Long Ran snorted coldly and said, “These remaining ones are all geniuses from recent years. In 100 thousand years, how many amazingly talented individuals? Dragonsand and Dragonwild, they all were forfeiting our dragon race’s foundation!”

Long Jian nodded and said, “You’re right! However, it’s somewhat regrettable about Ye Yuan this kid,?sigh?…”
