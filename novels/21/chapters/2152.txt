Chapter 2156: Breaking Out of the Encirclement

“Ye Yuan, let go of me! If you bring me along, it’s impossible for you to escape!” Long Xiaochun said anxiously.

She also saw through that these Empyreans that Long Xiao brought, each one was incomparably powerful, with their combat strength far surpassing those in the same rank.

Furthermore, their cooperation was extremely ingenious. They had clearly gone through countless trials before there was such tacit understanding.

“Enough crap, I’ll get distracted like this! Relax your mind and just follow me!” Ye Yuan said calmly.

Long Xiaochun was startled in her heart and could only follow along as Ye Yuan ordered.

One of the Third Firmament Empyreans suddenly shouted, “Big Brother, come up with some ideas!”

Long Xiao said in a clear voice, “Don’t panic! Let him hide! No matter how ingenious his movement technique is, there will definitely be times when he’s careless! Competing in willpower, we have never lost to anyone before!”

“Heh heh, alright!”

When the group of Empyreans heard Long Xiao’s words, the strength in their hands became steadier.

These Empyreans were not in a hurry at all, like cats catching mice. The intention was to slowly wear out Ye Yuan to death.

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised in his heart. Long Xiao’s one sentence made these guys’ combat power rise several levels!

This was not the increase in strength, but the stabilization of mental state.

In a fight, the more stable the mentality, the more one could tend to perform exceptionally well!

Three great Empyreans were the main attackers, the rest supported from the sides.

But each person, even if it was a First Firmament Empyrean, one could not overlook them.

A move of theirs that suddenly appeared would seriously injure you.

These people’s cooperation was simply impeccable!

One must find an opportunity to break this balance.

Otherwise, it would be dangerous today.

Let alone that the strongest Long Xiao had not even made a move until now!

“No wonder even Lord Ao Xu was very wary of you. Even if your strength was placed in the Battle of Dragon Sons this time, it will absolutely be top-notch too. What’s even more terrifying is that you’re only First Firmament Empyrean! Heh heh, but no matter how strong you are, it’s also a certain-death situation today. Kid, don’t struggle anymore!” Long Xiao said with a big laugh at the side.

Him talking on the sidelines was disrupting Ye Yuan’s state of mind.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan’s situation became even more critical.

Suddenly, a First Firmament Empyrean saw an opening and stabbed toward Long Xiaochun with a sword.

Long Xiaochun turned pale with fright, but it was already too late to want to stop it.

At the critical moment, Ye Yuan flashed and blocked in front of Long Xiaochun.

Swish!

The long sword stabbed right into Ye Yuan’s chest.

“Ye Yuan!” Long Xiaochun turned pale with fright and screamed out.

The other Empyrean’s eyes lit up, akin to sharks that smelled the scent of blood, blade lights and sword images all hacking towards Ye Yuan.

“Good!” When Long Xiao saw this scene, he could not refrain from cheering.

Yet, right at this time, a change suddenly occurred!

Ye Yuan suffering this sword did not collapse like everyone imagined. Instead, he opposed the momentum and stabbed a sword out!

“True Sword Hollow Etch!”

Ye Yuan’s low voice sounded out. An unparalleled sword energy directly blasted the First Firmament Empyrean in front of him to dregs.

“Go!”

Ye Yuan did not stop in the slightest, pulling Long Xiaochun and flashing, he directly tunneled out of the group of Empyreans’ encirclement.

This scene happened too suddenly, everyone did not react in time and let him succeed in breaking out of the encirclement.

“Ye Yuan, a-are you alright?”

Long Xiaochun looked at that sword stuck in Ye Yuan’s body, tears almost falling out.

Ye Yuan only got hurt in order to protect her.

Falling into a heavy encirclement was also because of her willfulness.

Long Xiaochun felt wronged to the extreme in her heart.

Ye Yuan just chuckled, reached his hand out, and slowly pulled out the long sword.

There was not even a drop of blood left behind on the sword.

When Long Xiao and the rest saw this scene, their eyes went wide.

“This ... How is this possible?” Long Xiao said in disbelief.

A First Firmament Empyrean being stabbed through by another First Firmament Empyrean with a sword, he was actually completely fine?

Long Xiaochun opened her mouth wide, a disbelieving look on her face.

“Huhu, you forgot, my physical body is very strong! How can this degree of attack hurt me?” Ye Yuan said with a light laugher.

Long Xiao’s pupils constricted, seemingly thinking of something. He then cried out in surprise, “Perfect seventh transformation! He ... He’s at the perfect seventh transformation”

“What? Is there really someone who can achieve perfect seventh transformation in this world?”

“I heard that the people with perfect seventh transformation can become impervious to swords and spears, having a perfect defense! Unless one’s cultivation realm exceeds by a lot, otherwise, they would not be able to even breach the defenses. I didn’t expect that it’s actually true!”

“That nirvanic tribulation is so horrifying! How did he transcend it?”

... ...

Cries of exclamations similarly came from the group of Empyreans. Clearly, they were shocked by the perfect seventh transformation, this term.

The dragon race’s physical body was extremely powerful. It was also precisely because so that they yearned for the perfect seventh transformation immensely.

But innumerable pioneers had once attempted it before, they all ended in failure.

But today, they actually saw a living perfect seventh transformation, how could they not be shocked?

Long Xiao gritted his teeth and said, “Boy, turns out that this is your trump card! But it ends here!”

Bang!

A powerful aura erupted. The pressure of a Fourth Firmament Empyrean made even space tremble.

But Ye Yuan did not care in the slightest and said with a faint smile, “My trump cards are plentiful Starting from now, savor my methods well. Have a taste of what’s called ... pain!”

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, directly teleporting away.

The interval before was actually done on purpose by Ye Yuan.

It was in order to break through these people’s encirclement.

As long as he broke through, with his spatial law powers, it would be difficult for these people to want to catch him again.

“Want to go? How can it be that easy? Eat this blade of mine!”

The short knife in Long Xiao’s hand raised up, the surging vital energy carried an astonishing blade, directly cutting through the sky, catching up to Ye Yuan instantly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure swayed and he actually disappeared!

This heaven-shocking blade of Long Xiao’s actually struck nothing!

“Not good! This kid is running to hide into the spatial rift! Chase!” Long Xiao said with narrowed eyes.

... ...

Inside the spatial rift, Long Xiaochun had a look of pleasant surprise.

Earlier, Ye Yuan getting injured frightened her badly.

But at this very moment, her guilt was tossed beyond the ninth heaven by her long ago.

“Hahaha ... too exciting! Ye Yuan, it’s really too exciting!” Long Xiaochun had long already forgotten about the anxiety and panic earlier, a look of excitement on her face.

Toward this plucky little sister, Ye Yuan was directly rendered speechless.

“Xiaochun, want to play a game or not?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

“I want, I want! How to play, Ye Yuan?” Long Xiaochun clapped her hands and said gleefully.

Her thought process was clearly different from others. Others would definitely roll their eyes and scold Ye Yuan viciously at this time.

What time was it, still playing games?

Yet, the moment Long Xiaochun heard playing games, she immediately became excited.

“Alright then, starting from now, you have to listen to me for everything! Since this guy dared to come and ambush me, he’ll have to be prepared to pay a painful price!” Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes, seething with killing intent.

Long Xiaochun nodded her head like a chicken pecking for rice as she said, “Say it! I’ll listen to you! You rest assured. In order to make up for the mistake that I made, I’ll go all out! You say, play what game?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Hide and seek!”
