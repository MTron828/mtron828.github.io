Chapter 2159: You Seem Very Disappointed

At Purpledragon Stronghold, a group of Son of the Heavenly Dragons were already ready and waiting for orders to set off.

Two people surrounded a handsome youth, their attitude rather humble.

“Huhu, with Brother Yu’s strength, you’ll definitely radiate splendor in the Battle of Dragon Sons this time!”

The one talking was precisely the Long Zheng that Ao Xu brought back.

“That’s right! Big Brother Yu already has no opponents among our Purpledragon Stronghold’s junior generation. Only those people that came down from the Heavenly Dragon Mountain have the qualifications to be his match.”

This was another one of Purpledragon Stronghold’s Son of the Heavenly Dragon, Ao Zhong.

Long Xiaochun did not have a Heavenly Dragon Mark, but her identity was special, and an exception was made this time for her to participate in the Battle of Dragon Sons.

“Humph! That Raindragon Stronghold is so haughty, to actually not arrive yet until now!” Long Zheng said with a cold snort.

After a few sentences of small talk, Ao Yu gave Ao Xu a signal. The two people found a quiet place and started discussing in whispers.

“Second Uncle, is that punk really as incredible as you said?” Ao Yu said with a frown.

“More than incredible! You think about it, what kind of existence is Sacred Ancestor High Priest? How can a person that could make him personally confer as sage be of the ordinary sort? If let him grow unchecked, he’ll definitely be your great enemy in the future!” Ao Xu said.

Ao Xu had already told Ao Yu about Ye Yuan’s monstrousness.

It was just that these words ultimately sounded like some Arabian night fantasy tale. So he was still not willing to believe it.

Ao Yu was arrogant at heart and haughty in manner. Normally, he would not place his peers in his sights at all. Now, a freak that was even more impressive than him suddenly popped out, he was naturally unhappy in his heart.

But Ao Yu also knew that Ao Xu would not lie to him in this sort of thing.

“You’re sure that he won’t make it anymore?” Ao Yu’s eyes glinted as he asked.

Ao Xu smiled and said, “You’re aware of Long Xiao’s strength! Even if he’s a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, he’s also just a genius that hasn’t grown up. How can he possibly survive at the hands of a Fourth Firmament Empyrean? Let alone that each and every one of his subordinates are all extremely fierce. Even if a peak Third Firmament Empyrean ran into them, he can only nurse a grievance and die!”

Ao Yu also smiled slightly when he heard it and said, “Second Uncle does things flawlessly, eliminating a great calamity in my heart for me! Second Uncle, rest assured. When I step into Heavenly Dragon Mountain in the future, I definitely won’t forget Second Uncle’s kindness.”

Ao Xu was delighted in his heart, but he had a smile on his face as he said, “You brat, what are you still being courteous with Second Uncle for?”

The group of people was currently showing impatience from waiting when suddenly, someone came to report, saying that traces of Bandit Xiao was discovered in the vicinity of Cloudheaven Mountain Range. Clearly, they had experienced a great battle. The aura of a human was even left behind.

Most likely, the Son of the Heavenly Dragon Ye Yuan and Long Xiaochun were already killed!

Everyone knew that Ye Yuan this Son of the Heavenly Dragon, the aura of a human on him was the strongest.

Then this aura was definitely left behind by him.

Once these words came out, it stunned the entire Purpledragon Stronghold.

A Son of the Heavenly Dragon being killed was equivalent to a heaven stronghold’s dragon lord being killed. That was a major incident. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When Ao Xu heard this news, his expression changed wildly. Thumping his fists and stomping his feet, he said, “H-How can this be? This ... This is all my fault! If not for me leaving them in Cloudheaven Mountain Range, they also wouldn’t have run into Bandit Xiao, that bunch of vicious and unrestrained gang!”

Ao Xu had a remorseful and angry look, full of an ashamed and indignant expression.

One had to admit, his acting skill was mastered to perfection and could even win the best actor award.

This matter, it was naturally his responsibility that was the greatest. But looking at his appearance, the others could not very well blame him anymore.

Purpledragon Stronghold’s Dragon Lord frowned slightly, no idea what he was thinking.

“Protector Xu, nobody wished to see this sort of thing either. Don’t blame yourself too much.”

“Yeah, Protector Xu! This matter isn’t what you hoped for, it was all Bandit Xiao’s fault!”

... ...

When the group of people saw Ao Xu crying, being heart-broken, they all came forward and started comforting.

Ao Xu wiped away his tears, came before Dragon Lord, knelt straight down, and said in grief and indignation, “Dragon Lord, Ao Xu requests to head to Cloudheaven Mountain Range to clean up Bandit Xiao! This time, even if I stand guard for 100 thousand years, Ao Xu also must kill all of them!”

Dragon Lord gave him a glance with a deep meaning, let out a sigh, and said, “Forget it. This matter wasn’t what you hoped for. That Bandit Xiao is extremely cunning. Even if a Heavenly Emperor went, it’s also useless. This matter, this emperor will ask for punishment from Heavenly Dragon Mountain.”

Although Dragon Lord had some suspicions, this incident had no evidence, he could not very well sentence Ao Xu’s crime with just empty words too.

But this matter was indeed fishy!

“Dragon Lord, this ... I hope that dragon lord gives Ao Xu a chance to make amends for my crime and take revenge for Dragon Son Ye and Long Xiaochun!” Ao Xu was still grieving as he said.

“Oh? What happened? Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu is actually going to avenge me?”

Dragon Lord was just about to speak when two young figures suddenly walked out of the void.

When Ao Xu heard this voice, his eyes went wide, as if he had seen a ghost. He said in shock, “You ... You’re actually fine?”

When Ao Xu saw the other party, how could he still not understand who it was?

His gaze stared fixedly at Ye Yuan as if wanting to see through him.

Ye Yuan scoffed. “Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu seems to be very disappointed that I’m alright!”

The shock in Ao Xu’s heart was simply unable to use words to describe.

A mere First Firmament Empyrean could actually survive under Long Xiao’s besieging, this was too inconceivable!

The strength of Long Xiao this group of people, he was all too clear. Forget about a First Firmament Empyrean, even if it was a Fourth Firmament Empyrean, they could forget about returning alive too.

Otherwise, Purpledragon Stronghold had so many Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, how could Long Xiao, a mere Fourth Firmament Empyrean, live until now?

There was naturally Ao Xu’s assistance involved, but their own strength also occupied a crucial reason.

But what was this situation right now?

Ao Xu reacted very quickly, saying with some awkwardness, “H-Haha, how can it be? For Dragon Son Ye to be able to return safely, this emperor is more than happy! I brought Long Zheng to go find you guys later on, but at that time, you guys were already not around.”

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu going to find us, you wanted to confirm whether or not we were killed, right?”

Ao Xu’s face changed and he said, “What do you mean?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What I mean, don’t you understand? These few years, you instigated Long Xiao and the rest to kill and pillage, committing all kinds of atrocities, cumulating numerous crimes. You’re the main culprit behind Long Xiao’s atrocities!”

Talking towards the back, Ye Yuan’s tone gradually turned cold, his voice carrying anger.

“What? The boss behind Bandit Xiao is Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu? How can this be possible?”

“This brat wouldn’t be crazy, right? To actually frame Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu?”

“Heavenly Emperor Ao Xu is normally kind toward others in the stronghold and is the most amiable and approachable Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. How can he possibly be Bandit Xiao’s boss?”

“Even if he’s a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, he also can’t give a false account of the facts and invert black and white!”

... ...

A stone stirred up a thousand layered wave, Ye Yuan’s words stirred up a fierce discussion in the crowd.

Naturally, there were more people who did not believe it.

Ao Xu this person was indeed very adept at pretending. Normally, his reputation in the stronghold was also extremely good.

Hence, the moment Ye Yuan said it, everyone felt that Ye Yuan was finding fault instead.

“Hahaha ... Dragon Son Ye, this is the most hilarious joke that this Emperor has heard! You also heard it, everyone is aware of my, Ao Xu’s, conduct. How can I possibly be the culprit behind Bandit Xiao?” Ao Xu laughed loudly and said.
