Chapter 2180: Repeated Blows!

On Sunset Peak, everyone’s expression became extremely fascinating!

This move that was an attack sufficient to cleave apart mountains actually did not leave any traces on Ye Yuan’s body!

Similarly a Second Firmament Empyrean, why would such a thing happen?

Only after a while did everyone came to realize the truth, cries of exclamations linking up.

“Really blinded my dog eyes! Martial Uncle Changqing wouldn’t be intentionally going easy, right?”

“Facing a same rank opponent, no matter how weak the opponent, it’s also impossible to be completely unscathed by standing there and letting the other party hit, right?”

“Martial Uncle Changqing fused three kinds of law powers. Even a Third Firmament Empyrean also wouldn’t dare to forcefully resist his attacks, right?”

... ...

Lin Changqing was a celestial figure in the eyes of these fellow sect members, an existence that they were unable to reach at all.

But today, Lin Changqing went all out and actually failed to leave behind any traces on his opponent’s body.

This kind of impact was seriously too intense.

Lin Changqing had a blank face. Looking at the Ye Yuan who was proud and unmoving, he muttered, “That’s impossible! This ... How is this possible? Bluecloud Truefeather Sword actually can’t even leave a mark on his body?”

His words were full of a bitter flavor.

At this instant, he truly experienced the disparity between him and Ye Yuan.

Even just now, when Ye Yuan reached Second Firmament Empyrean, he still had not despaired like so before.

He still felt that he could compete with him, and that he still had the right to speak as equals.

But at this very moment, the last of his pride was also crushed into pieces!

Ye Yuan was already powerful until it made him despair!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan raised his head to look at the sky and said coolly, “This brother, you watched the show for so long. Shouldn’t you show yourself now?”

Everyone’s expression changed and could not help looking around.

Sure enough, a middle-aged person slowly walked out of the void and lightly clasped his hands at Ye Yuan as he said, “Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple’s eldest disciple, Jun Mingxin, pays respect to the Priest Temple’s Second Sage! Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing offended Second Sage; this emperor apologizes on his behalf! Many thanks to Second Sage for showing mercy!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said coolly, “He’s at any rate Li-er’s senior apprentice brother too. On the account of Li-er’s face, I spared his life, that’s all.”

Jun Mingxin smiled slightly and said, “Second Sage coming to Fallen Maple, our humble place is honored by your presence. Master is already waiting on the main peak. Second Sage, let us move now.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Alright, lead the way.”

“Please!”

Jun Mingxing and Ye Yuan, one in front, one at the back, disappeared from Sunset Peak.

Murmur!

With this, Sunset Peak completely burst into an uproar.

“What did I see? Great Martial Uncle, an exalted Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, actually apologized to that young man?”

“What did Great Martial Uncle say? Second Sage? What’s that?”

“Who the hell knows, but he’s definitely an incredible existence! Otherwise, him being someone only at the Empyrean Realm, why would Great Martial Uncle treat him with such respect?”

... ...

Everyone clamored to get a word in, all speculating Ye Yuan’s identity.

But their levels were too low and could not come into contact with Second Sage this concept at all.

Lin Changqing stood transfixed on the spot. Until now, he still had not reacted to what was going on.

Zheng Yufeng went up and patted his shoulder, saying with a sigh, “Actually, until just now, I still wasn’t willing to believe that he was the Priest Temple’s Second Sage, an existence whose status is second only to the Sacred Ancestor High Priest! Even the 11 great disciples are all beneath him!”

Lin Changqing’s entire body trembled, using a look of disbelief to look toward Zheng Yufeng.

He cultivated bitterly in closed-seclusion these few years and completely did not know about the outside world’s affairs.

But the Priest Temple, Sacred Ancestor High Priest, as well as what kind of figures the Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s 11 great disciples were, he was aware.

Ye Yuan actually lorded above the 11 great disciples!

How was this possible?

Was this Ye Yuan really the same person as the ant that he had once seen before at the imperial city?

Zheng Yufeng looked at Lin Changqing somewhat sympathetically. He knew how great the blow this time was to Lin Changqing.

When an existence whom you once viewed as an ant suddenly stood in front of you

And used a gaze that looked down from a height to look at you, and you did not have the slightest strength leftover to resist.

That kind of despair was truly unable to use words to describe.

Only using a thousand years’ time, not only did Ye Yuan complete an all-round transcending in terms of strength, but in terms of status, he also completed a super magnificent transformation.

Even his master would likely have to show Ye Yuan some respect too, right?

After all, Second Sage was not merely a simple person!

The status signified that Ye Yuan was the Priest Temple’s number two figure, being an existence that no one could blaspheme!

“Also, that sword earlier, he was able to remain perfectly unharmed. He likely cultivated the legendary perfect seventh transformation golden body! Furthermore ... it doesn’t seem to be just so simple! He said himself that he’s also the Dragon Clan’s Heaven Chosen Son!”

Zheng Yufeng could not quite bear to shoot down this junior apprentice brother, but some things, he had to let Lin Changqing know.

Because Lin Changqing’s matters probably would not be left at this.

Ye Yuan not killing Lin Changqing, that was him being magnanimous.

But, Fallen Maple Bodhidharma provoked such a major god, could it be that it was left at that just like this?

Lin Changqing’s gaze turned slack, he was virtually breaking down.

A thousand years later, the blow that Ye Yuan’s transformation gave people was virtually catastrophic!

Heaven’s chosen?

Truly laughable!

In front of such a monster, who dared to claim to be heaven’s chosen?

Indeed, he and Ye Yuan were not people of the same world at all! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“These ... These 1000 years, what in the world happened? O-Oh right, where’s Junior Apprentice Sister Meng Li? Why didn’t she appear?” Lin Changqing suddenly thought of something and asked.

Zheng Yufeng opened his mouth, wanting to speak, but then he swallowed the words back.

... ...

Inside a great hall at the main peak, an old man sat up straight.

Ye Yuan followed Jun Mingxin and slowly walked in.

“Master, Second Sage has arrived!”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “I pay respects to Senior Fallen Maple!”

Fallen Maple’s gaze flickered slightly, and he said with a faint smile, “This emperor has long heard that Second Sage resolved the eternal chess game, Ask Not, and is the current generation’s number one alchemy outstanding figure. I didn’t expect that you were actually so young!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior is too kind.”

Fallen Maple was slightly surprised in his heart, Ye Yuan had no joy nor sorrow on his face. It was as if he was a deep chasm.

As a Heavenly Emperor, he actually could not quite see through this young man.

On Ye Yuan’s body, there was not the slightest trace of a peerless heaven’s chosen’s wild arrogance, and also not the flippantness that a youngster should have.

Every movement and action was neither servile nor haughty.

Fallen Maple could not help sighing emotionally, Lin Changqing compared to Ye Yuan was like mud to cloud!

“Huh, Changqing this child was dotted rotten by this emperor, resulting in affronting Second Sage without regard to propriety. This emperor ... apologizes for him!” Fallen Maple said with all smiles.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. He kept feeling that something was not quite right.

Ever since entering Fallen Maple Bodhidharma, the commotion that he caused was not considered small. Even Fallen Maple was alarmed, so there was no reason for Li-er to not know!

Fallen Maple would not be unaware of his intentions for coming, but he used Lin Changqing’s behavior to talk about things.

Something fishy!

“Senior Fallen Maple, I came for Li-er. I presume that you’re also awake. I wonder where Li-er is at right now? This Ye wishes to meet her!” Ye Yuan said.

“This ...” Fallen Maple’s face revealed a look of difficulty.

Ye Yuan’s heart tightened, and he said in a solemn voice, “What’s wrong with Li-er?”

Fallen Maple knew that he could not hide it and said with a slight sigh, “Li-er she ... went missing!”
