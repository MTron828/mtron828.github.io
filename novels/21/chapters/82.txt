Chapter 83: Huge Uproar!

Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessor

"Ye Yuan! You forced me!" Lin Tiancheng looked at Ye Yuan venomously.

Lin Tiancheng‚Äôs aura suddenly grew stronger, and the surrounding essence energy poured madly towards Lin Tiancheng.

When Ye Yuan saw this, his face became very grave!

"Look, quickly! Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, he . . . he‚Äôs breaking through! He wants to break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm!"

"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin could have broken through to the Spirit Condensation Realm long ago. He only suppressed his strength at half-step Spirit Condensation Realm for the Earth Rank Advancement test."

"Alas, Senior Apprentice Brother Lin is also forced to his wit‚Äôs end by Ye Yuan. Who would have thought that he could master the Eight Layer Wave? That‚Äôs 32 times the power!"

"That‚Äôs right. Ye Yuan‚Äôs too strong. He‚Äôs only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, and he could actually force the half-step Spirit Condensation Realm Senior Apprentice Brother Lin to such a state! But . . . it‚Äôs over. Senior Apprentice Brother Lin‚Äôs breaking through to the Spirit Condensation Realm, and Ye Yuan‚Äôs trump cards are all used up. There‚Äôs no more chance of victory."

The crowd was clearly pessimistic about Ye Yuan. When Lin Tiancheng was at the half-step Spirit Condensation Realm, Ye Yuan was already straining. Now that he was breaking through to the Spirit Condensation Realm, what could Ye Yuan use to fight with him?

Over 300 meters away, in the pavilion, Zuo Bugui patted his chest with a frightened look. "Oh my God. Scared this little master to death. Tried to steal the chicken, but nearly ended up losing the rice. I almost ended up losing the Sharp Horned Beast‚Äôs inner core which I had a hard time getting. I say, Old Long, now can you hand over your Spirit Essence Pill?"

Long Tang looked on and also sighed secretly.

No matter how Ye Yuan calculated, he probably did not expect Lin Tiancheng breaking through at the last moment. He could only wait now!

Even though he did not want to admit it in his heart, he knew that Ye Yuan‚Äôs chances of victory were not high.

But what he thought was one thing, what he actually said was another. "What are you anxious about? It isn‚Äôt over yet!"

"Hehe. You really won‚Äôt give up until all hope is gone! It‚Äôs already like this. Ye Yuan doesn‚Äôt even have 10% chance of victory. What are you still stubbornly holding on for?"

"You already said that he has less than 10% chance of succeeding. As long as the chance isn‚Äôt zero, then there‚Äôs hope."

Although he was stubborn, Long Tang was somebody like this. It was impossible for him to give up until it was truly hopeless.

Zuo Bugui was dumbfounded and could only say, "Fine! Let‚Äôs just wait and see! After they finish fighting, won‚Äôt you still obediently hand over the Spirit Essence Pill?"

. . . . . .

In another pavilion, a youth and a middle-aged man stood with their hands behind their backs.

"Second Uncle, what do you think?" the youth opened his mouth and asked the middle-aged man.

"If this child‚Äôs not eliminated, he will definitely be a calamity to the Su Family!"

"I think so too! I also don‚Äôt know what happened to him. This month‚Äôs improvement was simply too terrifying!"

"Regardless of what happened, this child absolutely can‚Äôt be spared! Just Ye Hang alone is already very troublesome to deal with. If his son were allowed to grow up, the Su Family would likely have to exit the medicinal herbs market in the future!" T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

The youth was in full agreement. He nodded and asked, "Second Uncle, over at the disciplinary hall . . .?"

"Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve informed the people downstairs long ago to treat this matter as if it didn‚Äôt exist. We will let Ye Yuan and Lin Tiancheng fight first. No matter the result, Ye Yuan‚Äôs definitely dead."

Hearing that, the youth let out a sigh of relief. "That bunch of old fellows can really remain patient. Second Uncle, you didn‚Äôt make a move, and none of them showed themselves. Looks like they have the same intention as us, sitting on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight.

The middle-aged man laughed coldly. "Watching the tigers fight? Haha. Just two little cats, that‚Äôs all."

Among these two people, the youth was precisely the Su Family‚Äôs new generation‚Äôs talent, Su Yishan, while the middle-aged man was Su Yishan‚Äôs second uncle, Su Yubai. And he was also the Dan Wu Academy‚Äôs Disciplinary Hall‚Äôs Elder!

By right, they had received the news long ago. Stopping this fight in time was easy for them.

However, no instructor had shown up until now. It was as if everyone had reached a silent agreement to let Lin Tiancheng and Ye Yuan finish fighting!

. . . . . .

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Tiancheng coldly without any intention of interrupting. Instead, he quietly took out a transcendent-grade Qi Returning Pill and swallowed it.

When he returned to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion a few days ago, Ye Yuan had refined more medicinal pills.

With his strength, it was basically effortless to refine Tier 1 medicinal pills.

After consuming a transcendent-grade Tier 1 Qi Returning Pill, Ye Yuan‚Äôs essence energy instantly recovered to its peak state!

This sort of treatment was not something that the average person could enjoy.

"What did Ye Yuan eat? His essence energy actually recovered in an instant!"

"What rubbish. It‚Äôs definitely the Qi Returning Pill!"

"But, can the Qi Returning Pill recover so much essence energy?"

"This . . . maybe the grade is higher?"

"How high of a grade is needed to let essence energy recover fully?"

"This . . . superior-grade? Transcendent-grade?"

. . . . . .

Ye Yuan‚Äôs action of swallowing the medicinal pill attracted the surrounding onlookers‚Äô attention.

Zuo Bugui seemed to have discovered something and said in surprise, "Old Long, look at Ye Yuan‚Äôs chest!"

Through the nourishment of essence energy, a martial artist‚Äôs body would surpass that of the average person. A distance of several hundred meters was not considered far to Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists.

Initially, everyone did not notice that Ye Yuan‚Äôs chest had something extra.

But his act of swallowing the medicinal pill drew people‚Äôs attention to the badge adorned on his chest.

Long Tang naturally also caught sight of that badge and involuntarily drew a cold breath.

"Sss . . . It‚Äôs actually a low-rank Alchemy Master badge!" Long Tang who had always remained calm became incessantly astonished.

"N-no way. He‚Äôs only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm! Is that badge fake?" Zuo Bugui‚Äôs thoughts were identical with many others. They thought that the badge was fake.

"How‚Äôs that possible? Who would dare forge a badge issued by the Alchemist Association? That would make one the public enemy of all alchemists. They would absolutely die without a burial place!"

"But how could he possibly refine Tier 2 medicinal pills with his Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm soul strength?"

"I remembered. Several days ago, the academy organized a group test. Ye Yuan seemed to have joined! He seemed to have entered a closed-door seclusion after returning from the Alchemist Association. That‚Äôs to say, when he became a low-rank Alchemy Master, he was still only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm!"

Long Tang also jumped in fright at his analysis. If that was indeed the case, then Ye Yuan was seriously too monstrous.

This discovery caused a huge uproar among the students, and everybody started debating. Of course, the general consensus was that . . . it was fake.

Using a fake Alchemist Association badge, this matter was much more serious than killing someone in the academy!

Su Yishan‚Äôs face became solemn. "Second Uncle, what‚Äôs with the badge? Did he really pass the Alchemy Master test?"

Si Yubai‚Äôs face also did not look too good. But he nodded and said, "If Ye Yuan isn‚Äôt a fool, then that badge should be real! But . . . this punk can‚Äôt be spared even more!"

"A Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm low-rank Alchemy Master. It isn‚Äôt that easy if Second Uncle wants to kill him, right?"

"Humph! A dead genius . . . is no longer a genius! Could those old fogeys oppose my Su Family because I killed a punk who violated the academy‚Äôs rules?" Su Yubai smiled coldly.

"Second Uncle‚Äôs intentions are . . .?"

Su Yubai swiped his throat and said icily, "Wait until they finish fighting. I will directly go there and finish off Ye Yuan!"
