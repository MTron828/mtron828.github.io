Chapter 2209: Achieving Mastery Through Comprehensive Study, Divine Soul Recovering!

Bang, bang, bang ...

The earth-shaking loud bangs spreaded throughout the wilderness.

The more Lin Changqing fought, the more alarmed he got!

His strength already rose to the limits of True God Realm, but Ye Yuan relied on array formations and blocked off all of his attacks!

Why was this fellow still so strong after being wrecked until like this?

“I don’t believe that I can’t crack your tortoiseshell!”

Lin Changqing’s temper also flared up. His aura suddenly soared wildly, directly breaking through to the Empyrean Realm!

The moment his Empyrean Realm’s aura appeared, heaven and earth changed colors because of it.

In this wilderness, he was an unrivaled celestial.

On Jingning Mountain, when those fierce beasts felt this horrifying pressure. Each and every one of them fled at full speed, all helter-skelter.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp. The movements of his hands became increasingly profound.

In this cycle of 60 years, Ye Yuan read extensively on Formation Dao and refining pills. Even he himself also did not know what kind of realm he reached.

But without a doubt, he was very formidable!

Through a cycle of 60 years’ worth of operations, Ye Yuan hoarded many divine essence stones in his hands. It was sufficient to use to lay down formations.

Bang, bang, bang ...

Another series of wanton bombardments.

But the power of Ye Yuan’s array formations actually rose another level out of the blue, blocking Lin Changqing’s attacks in its entirety.

The villagers were long already struck dumb from watching. Only at this time did they know what kind of terrifying realm A’Ning’s strength reached! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It turns out that this is A’Ning’s true strength!”

“My God, our Chen Village actually picked up a Seven-star Alchemy God!”

Chen Yan’s gaze flickered and he said, “I’m afraid that ... A’Ning isn’t an ordinary Seven-star Alchemy God! Sigh, this day finally still had to arrive!”

Talking until here, Chen Yan’s expression dimmed.

He felt that the day of Ye Yuan’s departure was probably arriving!

Over these 60 years’ time, Ye Yuan brought to the Chen Village an earthshaking transformation, bringing them to another world.

Presently, their Chen Village’s strength could virtually sweep across any capital city!

In just 60 years, to ordinary martial artists, it was not even enough to cultivate from initial-stage Grotto Profound to middle-stage Grotto Profound.

But Ye Yuan forcefully created a Divine Lord village.

What kind of terrifying strength was this!

The more Lin Changqing fought, the more alarmed he became, and the more force his hands exerted too.

Right now, he already fused two kinds of law powers but was still unable to breach Ye Yuan’s array formations.

Damn it! Failed to stimulate this guy, while I’m forced to use all my strength instead! A trash who doesn’t even have divine essence actually forced out my full strength! Is this guy still human? Lin Changqing secretly cursed in his heart.

Ye Yuan refreshed Ling Changqing’s view on life once more.

The current Ye Yuan was simply a cripple.

But even if Ye Yuan became a cripple, he still could not find any sense of superiority.

“Don’t care anymore! Serves you right if I beat you to death!”

Lin Changqing’s heart burned with fire, with the strength of Second Firmament Empyrean directly bursting forth.

Three kinds of fused law power made the void start to tremble.

Bang, bang, bang ...

Another series of wanton bombardments!

This time, Ye Yuan finally could not quite hold on anymore.

Those array formations collapsed faster and faster under the bombardment of three kinds of fused law powers!

“Hahaha ... see how you be cocky still! This time, I must beat you until you submit!” Lin Changqing was delighted in his heart as he said with a big laugh.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan actually already shut his eyes!

“Mn? Something’s wrong!”

Lin Changqing instinctively felt that something was not right. Ye Yuan’s array formations seemed to show signs of achieving mastery through a comprehensive study of the subject under his heavy pressure!

The recoil force became stronger and stronger!

With Lin Changqing’s eyesight, he could naturally tell.

Although the power of Ye Yuan’s array formations previously was extremely strong, they were all some scattered array formations that were not assembled.

Each and every array formation was disjointed.

But now, these messy array formations actually had signs of integrating into one!

“This guy is actually borrowing me to temper array formations! Freak! Truly a freak! Fine, since that’s the case, as you wish!”

Lin Changqing gave a cold cry and finally drew his long sword.

Bluecloud Truefeather Sword!

Lin Changqing’s strongest attack!

Three fused power of laws virtually sundered the void.

Everyone’s expressions changed wildly, crying out in shock.

Lu-er even gave a tender cry, roaring angrily, “Lin Changqing, what are you doing?”

She completely did not have time to think too much, running like mad toward Ye Yuan.

At this time, she only had one thought, that was to save Ye Yuan!

But right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly snapped open both eyes, his hands instantly firing out several thousand pieces of high-grade divine essence stones.

At the same time, an incomparably profound aura of law suddenly descended, landing on Ye Yuan’s body.

“Hundred Schools of Thoughts Nine Profound Heaven Subduing Grand Array, seal!”

A cold cry came out of Ye Yuan’s mouth, the grand array suddenly formed.

In an instant, the entire space was frozen.

Bang!

Lin Changqing’s Bluecloud Truefeather Sword landed on the grand array, but the grand array did not budge an inch!

Done with these, Ye Yuan no longer took any action and sat down cross-legged, allowing the aura of laws to descend freely.

Inside the array formation, Lin Changqing cried out in surprise and said, “This also works? This guy comprehended just like that?”

He suddenly realized that he was still inside the cage and shouted madly, “Let me out, you damn fellow!”

This Hundred Schools of Thoughts Nine Profound Heaven Subduing Grand Array was incomparably solid, sealing shut all of the space. His Bluecloud Truefeather Sword was unable to leave behind a mark. Wanting to escape was simply a fool’s talk.

During these 60 years, Ye Yuan had browsed through no idea how many Alchemy Dao records and created God knows how many major and minor array formations.

It could be said to have gathered the forte of different schools.

These abilities seemed to be imprinted in his body.

Even if he did not remember anything, he could still rely on his instincts and comprehend them thoroughly.

It was just that in the wake of his Formation Dao and Alchemy Dao strength becoming stronger and stronger, he naturally encountered a bottleneck.

During these 60 years, all that he learned was overly multifarious, being unable to fuse them into one.

But today, under Lin Changqing’s pressure, bit by bit, Ye Yuan finally broke through his limits and achieved mastery of everything through comprehensive study, successfully comprehending this heaven-defying grand array.

While on the other hand, Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao realm also achieved success without extra effort and was about to break through to the middle-stage Ancestor Realm!

This power of law was the reward for him!

Law descending, the aura of Ye Yuan’s divine soul grew stronger and stronger.

Lin Changqing cried out in surprise as he said, “This guy’s Alchemy Dao broke through! Divine soul recovery, wonder whether or not his memories can recover!”

Lu-er had a look of pleasant surprise as she said, “Definitely can! Definitely can!”

The villagers looked at this scene. Feeling the holy aura coming off Ye Yuan’s body, they could not resist prostrating in worship.

Chen Yan smiled bitterly and said, “Turns out that this is A’Ning’s original strength! He’s not somebody in the same world with us at all!”

By the side, A’Xiu bit her lips lightly, tears falling from her eyes.

When Chen Yan saw this scene, he could not help secretly sighing in his heart.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan finally slowly opened both eyes.

“I, Ye Yuan, finally returned!”

That moment she saw Ye Yuan’s eyes, Lu-er knew that her young master had returned again!

Ye Yuan looked at Lu-er and said with a sigh, “Lu-er, it’s been hard on you these few years!”
