Chapter 1553 Dao Realm

High-grade Meridian Heaven Heart Pill!

Regarding this result, Ning Siyu was simply satisfied to the extreme.

Although in front of Ye Yuan, a high-grade Meridian Heaven Heart Pill could be refined until not even dregs remained. She was still very satisfied with her result.

But in Xuan Yu’s and Ding Xun’s eyes, it was completely different.

They all knew that before running away, Ning Siyu still repeatedly failed to refine the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill.

Her running away was not unrelated to this.

But how many days had it been?

She actually directly refined out a high-grade!

Could it be that this lass really went out to learn new skills?

Seeing her master’s shocked expression, Ning Siyu was rather pleased with herself.

“Master, you look, you look, isn’t my improvement very big? I didn’t bluff you, right?” Ning Siyu smiled brilliantly and said.

After the astonishment, Xuan Yu said in surprise, “Girl, tell Master, what on earth did you do? Why is your improvement actually so great in a short few days’ time?”

Ning Siyu said smugly, “Because of Master Ye! You don’t know, Master Ye is really too cool when refining pills! I’ve never witnessed before, a person refining pills could actually refine until others become intoxicated ...”

Upon mentioning Ye Yuan, Ning Siyu started spewing forth unceasingly, not stinting with words of praises in the slightest.

“Hang on, this Master Ye that you mentioned, who is he?” Xuan Yu interrupted Ning Siyu’s ecstasy and asked.

Ning Fangrong clasped his hands and said, “Master, it’s like this ...”

Ning Fangrong briefly recounted the matter of the south city’s Miracle Hand Parlor, Ye Yuan challenging five great forces alone, surprising Xuan Yu repeatedly.

Especially when mentioning that Ye Yuan refined the Heavenly Blood Marrow Changing Pill and helped Huang Qian be reborn anew, Xuan Yu was inexplicably shocked in his heart.

The Purple Quill Marrow Extermination, he naturally knew it. This poison was incurable, but it was actually treated by a junior!

“I didn’t expect that the south city actually produced such a figure!” Xuan Yu sighed emotionally.

Ning Siyu looked at Xuan Yu’s expression and said with a smile, “Master, did you have the thought of accepting a disciple stirred?”

Xuan Yu did not hide it either, saying with a smile, “It’s you, lass, who’s astute! That’s right, such a genius, if he were taken away by others, that would be too much of a pity.”

Although it sounded very impressive, Xuan Yu did not see it with his own eyes after all.

With his status as high-rank Four-star Alchemy God, taking in a Three-star Alchemy God, wasn’t it more than enough still?

Ning Siyu giggled and said, “Master, rest assured. Nobody can take him in!”

“Mn? How so?” Xuan Yu said in puzzlement.

“Master, you look!”

Ning Siyu took out those two Gale Celestial Stone Pills. Xuan Yu’s gaze turned sharp and he exclaimed, “Divine-grade Gale Celestial Stone Pill! This ... This was refined by him?”

Ning Siyu nodded her head, pointed at the Gale Celestial Stone Pill, and said, “This is his first time refining. This one was his second time refining.”

Xuan Yu took those two medicinal pills from Ning Siyu’s hand, his expression becoming incomparably solemn.

Nothing could reflect the alchemist’s level more than medicinal pills. He discerned these two medicinal pills’ extraordinariness with a glance.

Carefully looking it over, Xuan Yu suddenly said, “First time refining ... could it be that ... this young man already reached the legendary Dao Realm? No, this is impossible! I’ve never heard before that a Three-star Alchemy God can reach the Dao Realm!”

Ning Siyu and Ding Xun both had puzzled looks and said, “Master, what’s the Dao Realm?”

Xuan Yu said solemnly, “The level of alchemists has always been divided based on the rank of the divine pills they could refine. But apart from this, there’s still a mysterious and profound realm, that’s the Dao Realm! The path of making sense is extensive and profound, nobody dares to say that they can refine all medicinal pills. Even Four-star Alchemy Gods also have rank three divine pills that they can’t refine, let alone talk about rank four divine pills. But once one reaches the Dao Realm, then their understanding of Alchemy Dao will be exceedingly profound and can unleash the properties within spirit medicines to the greatest extent. This kind of person, no matter what medicinal pills he refined, it would be accomplished with high proficiency!”

Recalling Ye Yuan’s pill refinement, Ning Siyu could not help but be in strong agreement and said, “According to what Master said, he’s really like this! It seems like ordinary medicinal pills, as long as he takes action, it will be divine-grade! Only when refining the Gale Celestial Stone Pill, was there a tiny bit of flaw, refining a heaven-grade.”

The corners of Xuan Yu’s mouth twitched slightly. He still wanted to take Ye Yuan in as a disciple earlier. But now, he completely dispelled this notion.

Taking in an alchemist who was probably in the Dao Realm as a disciple?

One shouldn’t look at how he was a Four-star Alchemy God. He really did not have the qualifications!

Putting aside that he was just a Five-star Alchemy God, even Five-star Alchemy Gods similarly did not have the qualifications!

Because such an existence, as long as there was no accident, once they stepped into Divine Lord Realm, as long as they became familiar with the properties of Four-star spirit medicines, then he was the strongest Four-star Alchemy God!

This kind of people’s understanding of alchemy was completely not what he could imagine.

This guy was totally a great god!

“So ... So incredible? A Three-star Alchemy God can actually be formidable to such a degree?”

Ding Xun completely could not comprehend this kind of existence. In his view, one star was one world. Four-star Alchemy Gods were stronger than Three-star Alchemy Gods.

He had never heard before that a Three-star Alchemy God could actually be powerful to the point where even his master was afraid of.

Xuan Yu also took a hit and said with a sigh, “According to what I know, only alchemists that reached the Heavenly Emperor Realm and infinitely approaches the Great Dao can have a possibility of comprehending Alchemy Dao ... reaching the Dao Realm! Three-star Dao Realm ... it’s unheard of! If his future road is walked solidly, perhaps ... he can reach the realm of the Medicine Ancestor!”

“Hiss ...”

The three people present all sucked in a cold breath. Xuan Yu’s speculation was a little too frightening.

Medicine Ancestor was an existence that they simply could not imagine, virtually rivaling Dao Ancestors!

This young man who popped out of God knows where could actually reach that kind of realm. Just thinking about it felt inconceivable.

“No can do! This boy, I must meet him! Lass, later, you go and find this Ye Yuan, just say that ... Master wants to interact with him,” Xuan Yu said suddenly.

Ning Siyu had never seen before her master like this. Even when facing the lord of the Pill Tower, he was calm and collected too.

“Yes, Master!” Ning Siyu answered.

“Also, the Pill Tower’s competition will be starting soon. This period of time, you go over to his side more. You must build a good relationship with him. This has tremendous benefits to you!” Xuan Yu said.

Ning Siyu hugged Xuan Yu and said gleefully, “Hehe, Master is so good, you’re the most open-minded!”

...

“Second Senior Brother, hand over your divine fire!” Ning Siyu looked at Ding Xun and said with a smug look.

Ding Xun smiled bitterly. He indeed still lost.

But he did not renege either, forcing the Blue Voyage Insight Divine Fire out of his body and giving it to Ning Siyu.

This divine fire was already not very useful to him.

He suddenly thought of something and said with uncertainty, “You wanted this Blue Voyage Insight Divine Fire ... Is it to ... give it to that Master Ye?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ning Siyu smiled and said, “Hehe, Second Senior Brother is indeed clever! That guy is already a Three-star Alchemy God and actually still uses rank two divine fire! How unsightly!”

Ding Xun’s eyeballs nearly popped out. That guy called Ye Yuan was truly too freakish, right?

He used a rank two divine fire to refine a divine-grade Gale Celestial Stone Pill?
