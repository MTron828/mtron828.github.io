“Why?” Ye Yuan was taken aback when he heard it and said in puzzlement.

He could tell that the relationship between Jian Sutao and Jian Hongxiao was not ordinary.

Logically speaking, Jian Sutao should hope for Jian Hongxiao’s recovery.

But Jian Sutao directly refused him. This made him very perplexed.

Jian Sutao said coolly, “The pill formula of the Six Veins Stellar Pill is unique to my Jian Family, how can it be easily shown to people?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “But this medicinal pill, other people don’t have much benefits consuming it too. It’s only useful to the Jian Family’s members, isn’t it? Even if I look at the pill formula, I’m also using it to save the Jian Family’s people. There doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it, right?”

Jian Sutao’s gaze turned intent; a wave of anger was released from his body. Ye Yuan immediately felt a tremendous pressure.

Jian Hongxiao was alarmed in his heart and hurriedly said, “Your Excellency, calm your anger. Ye Yuan he ... is also doing this for the sake of saving me.”

“Humph! To actually dare rebut this Empyrean, what gall!” Jian Sutao said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan did not give way in the slightest and said, “This junior is just stating a fact! This pill formula being placed in Senior’s hands, no one can refine it at all. It can only make the Jian Family’s people bemoan in the face of it. But put it in my hands, it can save many Jian Family’s people. What’s there to be against it?”

When Jian Sutao heard that, his fury was even more apparent as he said in a cold voice, “Heh, truly a wildly conceited junior! How can my Jian Family’s rules be gesticulated by you, a junior? Moreover, you want to refine the Six Veins Stellar Pill just based on that you just entered rank six? You’re looking down on this medicinal pill too much!”

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Sutao and said coolly, “Give me five years, and I’ll definitely be able to refine the Six Veins Stellar Pill!”

Jian Sutao smiled coldly and said, “A toad yawning; what high-sounding sentiments! You think that refining rank six divine pills is as easy as eating and drinking? Or is it that you think that you possess emperor surmounting aura and is invincible under the heavens? If this Empyrean kills you right now, even if you have the potential to cultivate to the realm of Dao Ancestor, it’s also to no avail!”

Finished talking, Jian Sutao’s aura really became cold. Clearly, he was genuinely enraged and wanted to kill people!

An aura that made Ye Yuan suffocated came in an overwhelming manner.

Ye Yuan felt as if the entire starry sky was collapsing, the whole process incomparably horrifying from start to end.

Back then, when Ye Yuan was still at the Divine Vestige Realm, he had once faced before the Empyrean Realm Lin Changqing. At that time, he already felt extremely powerless.

But that kind of feeling put at now, simply paled in comparison with it.

This empyrean in front of him was not what Lin Changqing that sort of rookie could compare to.

However, no matter how strong Jian Sutao was, Ye Yuan’s brows did not move a bit. His face did not have the slightest change in countenance.

Ye Yuan this person was this stubborn.

Cold sweat poured profusely on Jian Hongxiao’s forehead. He also did not expect that things would develop to this step.

“Lord Sutao, please calm your anger! If you want to kill Ye Yuan, then kill me first.”

Jian Sutao said in a cold voice, “Humph! Do you think that this Empyrean won’t kill you on the account of Fengqi’s face, is it?”

Jian Hongxiao’s face changed and he shook his head and said, “Dare not! But Ye Yuan only came here in order to save me! I can’t passively watch him die!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh and said to Jian Hongxiao, “Heh, if not going to give this pill formula, don’t give it then; so what? Other people can create this medicinal pill; so I, Ye Yuan, can similarly create it. It just takes some effort! Senior, let’s go!”

Ye Yuan even created the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill, this kind of heaven-defying medicinal pill. He did not believe that he could not create the Six Veins Stellar Pill.

It was just that Ye Yuan currently just broke through to the Origin Pill Realm. He still remained at the deduction and familiarization stage of rank six divine pills.

Otherwise, he also would not say that he needed five years to refine the Six Veins Stellar Pill.

Blackmailing Ye Yuan with medicinal pills, this sort of thing, not many people could do it.

Jian Sutao also did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually say such words, and could not help being taken aback.

Although his Dao of Divination was exceedingly formidable, he could not calculate Ye Yuan’s situation. He naturally did not understand Ye Yuan either.

Hence, he did not know how formidable Ye Yuan’s strength in alchemy was.

It was just that this kind of big talk was a little too big, right?

One had to know, this medicinal pill was jointly developed by Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and Medicine Ancestor. There was actually someone in this world who dared to say that they could create the Six Veins Stellar Pill independently?

But Ye Yuan said these words in all solemnity, but it also seemed so credible.

Jian Sutao was dazed.

More importantly, Ye Yuan was really leaving and did not seem to have the intention of staying.

Jian Sutao’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “It’s also not that I can’t give you the pill formula, but ... you have to promise this empyrean a condition!”

Ye Yuan’s figure paused and he involuntarily turned his head back, sizing Jian Sutao up with a smile that was not a smile.

Suddenly he realized that turns out Jian Sutao was waiting for this moment?

Ye Yuan was also very perplexed. He wanted to save Jian Hongxiao. This was originally a good thing. Why would Jian Sutao still decline with all sorts of excuses?

He did not expect that this fellow was actually having ideas about him.

“Senior, to the Jian Family’s people, I’m just an outsider. You used a Jian Family’s person’s life to threaten an outsider; isn’t doing this somewhat immoral?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Jian Sutao was shrewd with age, his face being thick as a city wall. He did not feel embarrassed either. He just said coolly, “You will agree.”

Ye Yuan countered with a question: “Based on what?”

Jian Sutao said, “Just based on this Empyrean’s divination art.”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he said helplessly, “Alright, you win. Say it; what’s the condition?”

Ye Yuan understood that Jian Sutao could not divine him, but he could divine Jian Hongxiao.

Hence, he knew that Jian Hongxiao would recover very soon.

And this was confirmed precisely by him.

Ye Yuan was helpless. This feeling of being kneaded by people, he did not like it.

But he owed Jian Hongxiao.

For Jian Hongxiao’s sake, he would indeed agree.

After all, developing a new medicinal pill, this kind of thing, took too much effort.

Furthermore, this medicinal pill even mustered the painstaking effort of two mighty Transcendent Heavenly Emperors. How arduous would it be to develop it?

The difficulty level was probably not much lower than the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill.

Furthermore, this was a rank six divine pill, the development difficulty would be much greater.

Therefore, even though he clearly knew that Jian Sutao’s way of doing things was very shameless, Ye Yuan could only accept it.

“You help me to enter the Ancient God Battlefield and retrieve an item!” Jian Sutao said.

Jian Hongxiao’s face changed and he said, “Your Excellency, could it be to retrieve that item?”

Jian Sutao nodded his head slightly, equivalent to tacitly acknowledging it.

“No way! I’d rather not recover! I can’t let Ye Yuan take this risk!” Jian Hongxiao said firmly.

Jian Sutao said coolly, “Who I’m asking isn’t you, it’s him! Furthermore, he’ll definitely agree.”

Jian Hongxiao’s face changed and he said to Ye Yuan, “Ye Yuan, you can’t enter the Ancient God Battlefield! That place is too dangerous; you’ll lose your life!”

But Ye Yuan looked at Jian Sutao and said, “Okay, I agree! Now, can you hand the pill formula to me?”

Jian Sutao looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly and said, “You’re not asking what item this Empyrean wants you to retrieve? And also you’re not asking what kind of place the Ancient God Battlefield is?”
