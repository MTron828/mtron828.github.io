Chapter 1338: Wang Family’s Main Family Arriving

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Wang Family’s branch, Wang Yuxiang, has seen Sir Su and Elder Xuan!”

In the Wang Family’s hall, an old man and a youth were currently sitting in the middle.

Even Wang Yuxiang, this Wang Family’s leader, could only stand in the hall.

Wang Lingbo was even only able to stand behind Wang Yuxiang and did not even have the qualifications to speak.

Sir Su, who was sitting on the seat of honor, had a high and mighty appearance. Clearly, he did not place Wang Yuxiang in his sights.

“Wang Yuxiang, your Jewelhill’s branch’s recent performance has made the main family very disappointed! A Wang Family of such a size was actually almost pulled up by the roots by someone!” Wang Su said carelessly.

On the right-hand seats, cold sweat poured profusely on their foreheads when Wang Yuxiang and Wang Lingbo heard these words.

Jewelhill City’s Wang Family was merely a branch of the Wang Family.

The Wang Family’s main family was in Brightraise City.

The Heavenspan World did not have a number of messy forces. There was only one city after another.

Heavenspan World’s cities were divided into a total of five ranks, namely, counties, capital cities, imperial cities, imperial capital, and great imperial capital.

Counties were the lowest-level cities. It was the city where powerhouses managed low-level martial artists and mortals. The numbers were abundant.

Reaching capital city this level, it was not what the average person could enter.

Mortals were absolutely barred from entering capital cities!

Even Deity Realm powerhouses had to meet certain conditions too, before they had the qualifications to enter a capital city.

The administrator of capital cities were at least all Divine Lord Realm and above.

Jewelhill City and Brightraise City were both counties, both belonging to Wu Meng Capital City.

It was just that Jewelhill City was a part of the very weak counties, while Brightraise City belonged to the stronger counties.

Three years’ time had already passed since the Wang Family’s three great elders were killed by Ye Yuan.

In these three years, Jewelhill City’s Wang Family was extremely low-key, drawing back all businesses, waiting for this day.

Wang Yuxiang made a trip to the Yin Wind Den, angering him until he billowed smoke from all seven orifices.

After a little inquiry, he learned that the Wang Family’s three great elders were all annihilated already.

The news that Feng Ping brought was utter rubbish.

But Wang Yuxiang very quickly realized the seriousness of the problem. Being able to wipe out all of the Wang Family’s elites, regardless of what methods Ye Yuan used, it could not be underestimated.

Furthermore, the Wang Family already suffered a great loss in vitality. They were already strong in will but lacking in strength to fight with the other families.

His thought reaching here, Wang Yuxiang decided to endure the humiliation and bear the burden, informing Brightraise City’s Wang Family’s main family about the matter on this side.

Jewelhill City’s Wang Family would have to pay large amounts of benefits as tribute to the main family at Brightraise City. What they were afraid of was the arrival of this day.

Three years had passed, the Wang Family’s main family finally sent Wang Su and Wang Xuanfeng here.

This Wang Su was an outstanding member of the Wang Family’s younger generation. He was less than 500 years old and already a grand completion Grotto Profound level expert.

Wang Xuanfeng was even more remarkable. Not only was he a martial arts expert, but he was also even a Two-star Alchemy God!

Although the strong reigned supreme in the martial arts world, business was business, everyone had to observe the most basic rules of the game.

Jewelhill City’s four great factions were originally balanced in strength. The Wang Family was the strongest, the Lu and Lin two families followed, the Myriad Treasure Tower the weakest.

Now, the Myriad Treasure Tower rose domineeringly with divine-grade medicinal pills. For the Wang Family to want to make a comeback, they had to use business methods.

Once martial strength got involved, the City Lord Manor would inevitably have to intervene.

Although the Wang Family’s strength was even greater than Jewelhill City’s City Lord Manor, what the City Lord Manor represented was Wu Meng Capital City and could not be offended.

“Sir Su, the fault of the matter this time doesn’t lie with the Wang Family! That guest alchemist of the Myriad Treasure Tower is really freakish to the max. We were caught off-guard too.” Wang Yuxiang said.

Although his realm was higher than Wang Su’s, he did not dare to offend him.

This was a junior that the main family placed emphasis on grooming. His future accomplishments were limitless.

“Heh, an initial-stage Grotto Profound turned your Jewelhill City branch upside-down, you guys are really promising! Don’t failures always like to give excuses like that?” Wang Su said with a cold smile.

What you heard may be false, but what you saw was true.

Wang Su was naturally aware of the news that Wang Yuxiang reported. But in his view, this was Jewelhill City’s Wang Family being incapable, and not that their adversary was very powerful.

All these information were mere excuses.

Wang Yuxiang did not dare to refute and said to Wang Lingbo, “Lingbo, present the thing and let Sir Su and Elder Xuan take a look.”

Wang Lingbo handed over two boxes respectfully. Wang Su carelessly received it and gave a glance, his gaze was still just disdain.

“Divine-grade Divine Essence Pill? Heh heh, what does lowest-grade Tier 1 low-grade divine pill count for? Don’t you say so, Elder Xuan?” Wang Su said with a laugh.

Elder Xuan, who had been silent all along, smiled when he heard this and said, “Oh, Yuxiang, just a mere Tier 1 low-grade divine pill, it’s nothing at all! With this old man around, his Myriad Treasure Tower has to coil even if it’s a dragon too! Additionally, when I came, the head elder told me, Jewelhill City’s branch family has been conscientious and earnest these few years, and have made great contributions for the main family. Head Elder specially permitted for Jewelhill City’s branch family to pick three elite disciples to enter the main family’s Soaring Dragon Pavilion.”

Wang Xuanfeng’s words made Wang Yuxiang and Wang Lingbo tremble all over, their faces revealing a look of wild ecstasy.

The Soaring Dragon Pavilion was the place where the main family specially fostered elite disciples.

Upon entering the Soaring Dragon pavilion, one’s future accomplishments would be limitless.

The Wang Family suffered heavy losses this time. But being able to let elite disciples enter the Soaring Dragon Pavilion was also considered to have gotten a blessing in disguise.

“Thank you very much, Sir Su, Elder Xuan! Thank you very much, Head Elder!” Wang Yuxiang said agitatedly.

Wang Xuanfeng smiled and said, “With this, Yuxiang, you don’t have worries about attacks from the rear anymore, right? These few years, Wang Su and I will be staying here. You guys put in more effort and squeeze the Myriad Treasure Tower out of Jewelhill City, this is the main point.”

Wang Yuxiang’s gaze turned intent, and he hurriedly said, “Rest assured, Elder Xuan, Jewelhill City’s branch family will definitely cooperate fully with the main family!”

Wang Yuxiang realized that the main family was finally going to seize this chance and make a move against the Myriad Treasure Tower!

...

Ten years, Ye Yuan did not obtain the slightest bit of progress.

Rather, Dustless mocked beside his ear non-stop.

“Kid, give up. You only spent a year’s time, you still have time to turn back now.”

But Ye Yuan shook his head stubbornly and said, “Senior, you and I have been together for a long time. You should understand my temperament a little already. I won’t give up.”

Dustless said crossly, “Boy, I acknowledge that your alchemy talent is exceedingly strong, but this Martial Dao cultivation method is a completely different matter from Alchemy Dao!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan suddenly trembled all over, his face revealing a look of wild elation. Slapping his head, he said, “Yeah! Why am I so stupid! Giving up a ready-made road and not walking, only caring about taking the roundabout way!”

Dustless froze, clueless why Ye Yuan was so excited without rhyme or reason.

“You kid, what did you think of again?” Dustless said in puzzlement.

Ye Yuan said excitedly, “Since it’s creating a cultivation method that belongs to me, then it should be the cultivation method most suitable for me! Don’t you agree, Senior?”

Dustless nodded woodenly and said, “That is, of course!

“Then, Senior, what’s my strongest path?” Ye Yuan continued.

Dustless said, “Naturally, Alchemy Dao! En? You want to use Alchemy Dao as the correspondence point and create a cultivation method? This ... This is also too ridiculous, right? Then the cultivation method created is specifically used to refine pills?”

Ye Yuan chuckled but did not say anything, stifling Dustless badly.
