Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Eh? It’s actually Ye Yuan they all! What powerful arrows, to actually be able to inhibit the blood race’s revival!”

“How did he do it? The significance of this is too far-reaching. It might affect the entire war!”

“Previously, everyone all said that he was talking big to impress people. Sigh, we really had eyes but couldn’t see! Turns out that what he said was all true!”

‘When Heaven One army saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely excited.

It was naturally impossible for ordinary arrows to accomplish it.

They guessed that this might very likely be because Ye Yuan dipped something on the arrows.

This truly held extraordinary significance!

Once this kind of method could be used on a large-scale, it could absolutely reverse the war between Heaven One Continent and the blood race.

Meanwhile, the powerhouses on the blood race side were all incomparably alarmed and terrified.

‘A few people dying was irrelevant to the blood race.

But this kind of major killing tool was simply lethal to them. The ability that they relied on to roam the heavens unobstructed was actually being restrained.

If this kind of weapon appeared on the battlefield, the degree of impact could be imagined.

‘When Luo Chuan, who was in a fierce battle presently, saw Ye Yuan, his pupils could not help constricting.

Previously, Ye Yuan breaking through the defensive life and sending news back to the Heaven One Continent already gave him a huge shock.

But that shock was far from comparable to the scene before his eyes.

“Zhong Yue, Zhu Hai, Chen Si, the three of you go and kill boy! Absolutely can’t allow him to live!” Luo Chuan said in a solemn voice.

Zhong Yue gave a cold cry, immediately leaving behind the Song Miao who was opposite of him, and charged toward Ye Yuan.

Three great True Sovereign Heavens pounced toward Ye Yuan at the same time!

The corrupted blood within Song Miao’s body was currently boiling. He was already on the verge of death to begin with.

Zhong Yue actually abandoned him at the crucial moment and gave him a lease of life.

Without the slightest hesitation, Song Miao directly withdrew from the battlefield.

“Retreat!”

Ye Yuan turned around and ran without another word.

Facing three great upper True Sovereign Heavens, he stood no chance at all.

His goal had already been achieved. There was no need to continue staying anymore.

Ye Yuan’s sudden appearance gave the blood race a huge shock. The human race side also won a fleeting opportunity to catch their breath.

However, it was nothing more than that.

It was impossible to turn things around.

Therefore, they had to retreat now.

The battle to destroy the spatial passageway this time, the Heaven One army had clearly already lost, lost due to the eruption of corrupt blood.

Ye Yuan warned them previously, but nobody took it seriously and only treated it as Ye Yuan talking big to impress people.

In the end, they burned themselves.

The thing that Ye Yuan smeared on the arrowheads was the blood essence of blood race powerhouses. It was refined with 81 kinds of precious grade five heavenly medicines, and named Blood Suppression Mourning Sun.

The hardest thing to come by in this Blood Suppression Mourning Sun was not these 81 types of grade five heavenly medicines, but it was the blood essence of blood race powerhouses.

It was common knowledge that as long as the blood race had one drop of blood essence surviving, it could be reborn from a drop of blood.

This ability could be said to be extremely heaven-defying.

Normally, wanting to obtain the blood essence of bloodkin was simply impossible.

Because if you wanted to kill them, you had to completely wipe them out.

However, Ye Yuan ambushed hundreds of bloodkin in the fog. Back then, he held a trick in reserve.

‘When he eliminated the bloodkin, he attempted to use his Dao sword to suppress.

In the end, he discovered that the blood race’s blood essence indeed could not revive anymore!

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword had been tempered by Heavenly Dao, it could suppress all things.

The blood race’s blood essence was actually unable to revive under the suppression of the Dao sword.

But even so, Ye Yuan only obtained extremely little blood essence.

It was also by relying on the advantage in timing, geographical, and human conditions back then. Otherwise, even if it was Ye Yuan, it would be difficult to collect these blood essences too. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

These blood essence could only be used in medicine after a hundred times of Ye Yuan’s refinement.

Ye Yuan made haste without resting and only created several hundred arrows.

Ye Yuan arrived quickly and left even faster!

Not waiting for the three great True Sovereign Heavens to carry out an encirclement, he already made his get-away.

This great battle actually ended just like that in the end.

Of course, the Heaven One army suffered massive losses.

The army of 50 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens actually had more than 10 thousand casualties. Another large batch of powerhouses was inflicted by corrupt blood energy.

And this was still under the situation where Ye Yuan arrived in time to suppress the blood race.

If not for Ye Yuan, this battle’s losses would be even greater, and they could even have been completely wiped out.

The consequences of the corrupt blood energy erupting was seriously too severe.

Outside of Northern View City, Song Miao stood in the air, his complexion deathly pale.

At this time, the corrupt blood energy had already spread across half the blood in his body, and it was incomparably agonizing.

However, he did not cry out in pain at all. He just kept looking at the horizon.

Suddenly, a figure cut across the horizon and came towards this side.

Song Mia’s face revealed a look of great joy.

Ye Yuan returned safely!

Seeing Song Miao, Ye Yuan was a little surprised.

At this time, he should be nursing his injuries in the city.

“Senior Song, why are you here?”

Song Miao looked at Ye Yuan. Suddenly, he lowered his body and knelt down, saying, “Song Miao had eyes but couldn’t see! Song Miao blamed Brother Ye wrongly and also caused this great battle’s defeat! This Song apologizes to you in front of everybody today!”

Him kneeling caused a great sensation in the entire city.

An exalted upper True Sovereign Heaven, Northern View City’s city lord, actually knelt down and apologized to a junior!

The powerhouses in the city had been guessing all along on what City Lord Song Miao would be doing.

They did not expect that he was actually specifically waiting for Ye Yuan to return, to kneel down and apologize to him!

While those people who ridiculed Ye Yuan before, all lowered their heads in shame at this time.

Song Miao really did not have scornful words or jeers back then.

Rather, it was them who made extremely nasty remarks.

As for Dao Chen, he wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into now.

He used his authority from being from the Extreme Medicine Sect to suppress Ye Yuan’s opinion, and he even mocked him to the best of his ability.

As a result, it caused this miserable defeat!

Ye Yuan was also stunned by Song Miao’s action.

Song Miao doing this sort of action, it could be seen how regretful and how ashamed he was in his heart at this time.

This person had a great breadth of mind.

Ye Yuan hurriedly helped Song Miao up and said, “Why is Senior Song going so far? You’re this Ye’s savior. This is killing Ye!”

Song Miao said ashamedly, “If back then this Song gave Brother Ye a chance to prove yourself, maybe I wouldn’t have made such a huge mistake!”

He knew that when Ye Yuan was seeking his opinion back then, it was actually hoping for him to come forward and speak up.

He ignored that look which asked for help.

Ye Yuan was merely a foreigner. His words carried little weight.

Facing the Extreme Medicine Sect, this kind of colossal titan, nobody would believe his words at all.

Therefore, all explanations were futile.

Hence, Ye Yuan chose silence.

However, he did not bear any hatred. Instead, he refined those powerful arrows that very same night and reversed the war situation.

Otherwise, the consequences would be too dreadful to imagine.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Senior Song, now isn’t the time to say this. Your corrupt blood energy has already erupted all-round. It will be too late if we don’t treat it in time.”

Song Miao said, “This Song’s wretched life isn’t worth mentioning! If I die, so be it! But, if I don’t apologize to you, even if this Song dies, I’ll find it hard to close my eyes!”

Ye Yuan said, “Does Senior Song trust me?”

Song Miao looked at Ye Yuan and nodded his head seriously.

Ye Yuan said, “This blood race’s corrupt blood might not be without a genuine method of cure!”
