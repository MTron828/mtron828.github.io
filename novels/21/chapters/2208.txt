Chapter 2212: What in the World Are You Persevering For?

Under everyone’s eyes, Yun Yi slowly stepped forward.

Empyrean Pilljade had a slight smile on his face as he said with a nod, “Yi-er, this Empyrean knows that it’s been tough on you these few years! In the entire Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital, only you are the most suitable to inherit my mantle! In the future, you’ll be Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s master!”

He was very satisfied with this great-grandson. Putting aside that he was exceedingly talented, he could even win Ye Yuan’s trust.

Especially back then, he could remain patient and insist on not leaving. It made Empyrean Pilljade sit up and take notice of him even more.

Had the right character, had talent; he was naturally the most suitable candidate to inherit his position.

Yun Yi’s expression was complicated. He looked at Empyrean Pilljade and had nothing to say for a while.

When Empyrean Pilljade saw that Yun Yi did not react. His brows could not help furrowing and he said, “Yi-er, why haven’t you come over!”

Yun Yi drew a deep breath and directly knelt down, and said in a clear voice, “Lord Great-Grandfather, can you let Heavenly Eagle Imperial City off on the account of Yi-er’s face?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed.

Was this guy mad?

That was his own great-grandfather!

Empyrean Pilljade’s brows knitted tightly as he said in a solemn voice, “Yi-er, do you know what you’re saying?”

Yun Yi nodded and said, “Master’s kindness toward me is as weighty as a mountain. He really taught me pill refinement techniques and pointed the way to a bright future for me! These few hundred years, Yi-er can be described as thoroughly remolded myself! In front of such great kindness, Yi-er is unable to betray Master and watch Heavenly Eagle without lending a helping hand!”

Yun Yi’s words came from the bottom of his heart.

Only all the way until he entered the Pill Tower did he know what was called true Alchemy Dao!

In these several hundred years, he could be described as casting off his old self and being reborn.

The present Yun Yi was long already not the Yun Yi back then.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan did not hoard anything from him and viewed him as a true successor, teaching him pill refinement.

A master is like one’s father!

In Yun Yi’s heart, he had long already taken Ye Yuan as his elder and treated him as his Alchemy Dao guide, as well as ... treating him as a God-like senior.

Making him betray Ye Yuan, he could not do it!

“Unfilial child! Don’t you forget your identity!” Empyrean Pilljade said furiously.

Yun Yi’s way of doing things seriously made him lose face. It was simply blatant face-slapping.

His own descendant was actually standing on the enemy’s side.

Yun Yi had a resolute look as he said, “Lord Great-Grandfather, Yun Yi doesn’t dare to forget my identity for a second! Just like back then, when Master asked Yi-er to betray Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital. Now, making Yi-er betray Heavenly Eagle, I can’t do it either! Great-Grandfather, please raise your hand high up in mercy and leave.”

Empyrean Pilljade said with a cold snort, “If I say no?”

Yun Yi seemed to have long expected it and said in a solemn voice, “Then Yi-er can only die together with Heavenly Eagle!”

As he said, he turned around and returned to the top of the city walls, and stood side by side with Bai Tong.

“Good! Good! Good! To think that I, Pilljade, was wise for a lifetime, but I actually raised such an unfilial descendant like you! Forget it! This Empyrean will take it as I didn’t have you, this offspring!”

Empyrean Pilljade repeatedly said ‘good’ three times. It could be seen how furious he was currently.

His gaze turned dark as he said in a clear voice, “People in the city listen up! This Empyrean came here today to avenge my enmity with Ye Yuan punk! Those who are Ye Yuan’s sworn followers all have to be rounded up in one fell swoop today! But this Empyrean cares about the welfare of every living thing and doesn’t wish to implicate the innocent. Right now, anyone who steps forward and surrenders, this Empyrean can spare their lives and let bygones be bygones! In fact, Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital will even have a place for you!”

Taking revenge was one thing, but what Empyrean Pilljade valued more was the pill formulas!

Pill formulas were the future of the Southern Border Alliance.

Right now, the Southern Border Alliance was just the Myriad Treasure Tower’s distributor, their profits being pitifully meager.

But with pill formulas, everything would be different!

There was also one thing. The medicinal pills that Heavenly Eagle produced, the quality was higher than those at other places!

What did this indicate?

This showed that Heavenly Eagle’s alchemists had high standards!

Heavenly Eagle’s Pill Tower’s alchemists were all pillars of society. Their strength far surpassed those in the same rank. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

With so many talented people, killing them would be too wasteful.

What Empyrean Pilljade pursued was benefits and not slaughter.

Hence, before he took care of Heavenly Eagle, he naturally had to solicit some alchemists.

Under the Southern Border Alliance’s army, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was long already as precarious as a stack of eggs piled on top of one another.

Pilljade had faith that as long as these alchemists were not fools, they would size up the situation.

But one breath passed.

Three breaths passed.

Ten breaths passed.

No one stepped forward!

Not a single one!

Pilljade’s expression became increasingly uglier and he said in a solemn voice, “You all rest assured, with this Empyrean around, no one from Heavenly Eagle will dare to make a move against you all!”

Southern Border Alliance this side had as many experts as clouds. He himself was even a Ninth Firmament Empyrean peerless expert.

This battle did not have any suspense at all.

But there was still no one who came out.

“Empyrean Pilljade, give up on this! No one will go with you! We’ll live and die together with Heavenly Eagle!”

“Stop trying to win popular support here! Who doesn’t know that you’re coveting the pill formulas! Still putting on an appearance here, don’t you find it disgraceful?”

“Stop dreaming! Even if we die, we’ll also bring the pill formulas into the coffin! If you have the ability, go find Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure and the seven great ancient families to ask for pill formulas!”

... ...

All of a sudden, a series of noisy voices came from the city.

The martial artists and alchemists in the city all let loose a torrent of abuse towards Empyrean Pilljade.

Empyrean Pilljade was angered until his expression was livid with rage, and was incredibly shocked in his heart.

Could it be that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s civilians were all a bunch of desperate people who did not fear death?

Was there such a place in the entire Heavenspan World?

Why?

Why did these guys rather die than be willing to surrender?

Hearing the cursing voices that came from here, the Southern Border Alliance side was incomparably shocked.

“A-Are these guys all lunatics? Could it be that they all aren’t scared of death?”

“What the hell kind of place is Heavenly Eagle? Why are all of them like madmen?”

“There’s actually no one who surrendered! This ... How is this possible?”

... ...

How could they know that for Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to have its present cohesion, it was earned by Ye Yuan with his life!

Only sincerity could be exchanged with sincerity.

Relationships that were bound together using benefits ultimately could not go far.

Bai Tong looked at Empyrean Pilljade and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Stop making futile efforts! Ye Yuan that brat’s abilities aren’t what you can imagine. Even if Heavenly Eagle Imperial City fights until the last soldier, there also won’t be anyone who surrenders. It’s impossible for you to bring away the pill formulas too. Using this scheme on Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, apart from asking for a scolding, there are no benefits at all.”

Empyrean Pilljade was angered until the muscles on his face were twitching. He did not expect this situation from start to end.

He thought that once the army arrived, wouldn’t a puny little Heavenly Eagle Imperial City tremble with fear and fall apart to pieces?

But who knew that these guys were a bunch of lunatics who did not fear death.

No one escaped!

No one surrendered too!

Just what kind of magical power did Ye Yuan this guy have?

He was clearly already dead. So what were these guys persevering for in the end?

In the end, he gritted his teeth and said in a cold voice, “Very well! Since that’s the case, then all of you can go and die! This Empyrean wants to see if it’s really all tough bones inside this imperial city!”

Finished talking, he flicked his sleeves grandly. Hundreds of Empyreans and countless True Gods charged over, their momentum astonishing!
