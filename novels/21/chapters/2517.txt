Chapter 2523: Unable to Speak Up

“Huhu,?even an ant who just ascended has his share of arrogance. An ant-like thing has no idea of danger or death!” Lu Yuanjie said with a laugh.

The family guards behind Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu were also all laughing non-stop at this time.

Clearly, they had already gotten used to this scene.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was connected to every heaven and myriad worlds. There were often Lower Realms martial artists that ascended.

These martial artists had immensely formidable strength in the Lower Realms.

But arriving here, they were the lowest rung.

Because Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven did not have ordinary martial artists.

The weakest here was also a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse.

Therefore, this scene of Ye Yuan’s air of haughtiness was only seen as being laughable in everyone’s eyes.

When Gui Tianyu saw that Ye Yuan still ignored him, he said in a solemn voice, “Boy, come in front of this young master and kneel down and kowtow to admit your fault now. This young master can spare your life.”

Ye Yuan was slightly angry in his heart and was just about to speak up sarcastically when that woman who was fairer than snow suddenly said, “Two senior apprentice brothers, it’s really not easy for this little brother to be able to ascend from the Lower Realms. Can you give this junior apprentice sister face and spare him once?”

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu were naturally unwilling. Ye Yuan’s attitude made them very displeased.

It was just that they were both pursuing Yang Xuezhen. So they naturally had to appear more magnanimous.

Gui Tianyu gave a cold snort and said, “Since Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen opened her mouth to plead, consider your life tenacious, brat.”

Lu Yuanjie said coolly, “We’ll listen to Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen. Get lost then.”

Yang Xuezhen said, “Two senior apprentice brothers, this little brother likely can’t walk out of here by relying on himself. Why don’t we bring him out?”

The two people frowned slightly with reluctant looks on their faces. But they could not brush off Yang Xuezhen’s face.

In the end, they could only nod their heads helplessly.

Ye Yuan looked towards Yang Xuezhen rather surprisedly, not expecting that this girl was actually so kind-hearted.

Actually, he did not care about the threats of these people.

Although he currently had not cultivated Heavenly Stratum cultivation methods and martial techniques yet, just by relying on the power of the Heavenspan Mountain, he could kill everyone present.

These few days, it was also not that he had achieved nothing.

At the very least, his control of the Heavenspan Mountain became much more accomplished with high proficiency.

The power of the Heavenspan Mountain also increased significantly.

These people in front of him, the strongest was merely middle Lesser Sublime Heaven.

It was enough to suppress these people with the power of the Heavenspan Mountain.

However, unless it was a last resort, Ye Yuan did not wish to employ the Heavenspan Mountain.

This place was Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s territory. If he took out the Heavenspan Mountain here, he would have to kill all the people present.

Otherwise, there would be a constant source of future troubles.

Ye Yuan was also not an insensible person. He gave a bow toward Yang Xuezhen and said, “Many thanks, Miss.”

Yang Xuezhen waved her hand and said coolly, “Not a big deal.”

Clearly, this girl was in a bad mood and did not have too much desire to talk.

She only helped Ye Yuan conveniently.

Ye Yuan naturally would not ask for a rebuff either. He simply followed the squad in silence.

The sky gradually turned dark. The party set up camp.

Suddenly, a tiger roar came from the distance.

Lu Yuanjie two people exchanged a glance and could not help smiling knowingly.

“Brat, there’s no free lunch in the world! We served as a protective umbrella for you along the way. So shouldn’t you do a little something too?” Lu Yuanjie said to Ye Yuan with a smile.

How could Ye Yuan not know that this guy was planning something bad?

However, he was emboldened stemming from great ability, and did not care either, saying indifferently, “You want me to go and hunt that tiger?”

Lu Yuanjie was a little surprised at Ye Yuan’s cleverness and said with a nod, “Yeah, this is merely a lower Lesser Sublime Heaven Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger. It’s one of the weakest true spirits in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. Pressing on with our journey all the way, everyone is a little tired. Why don’t you hunt it down and satisfy everyone’s craving for good food?”

Ye Yuan had not spoken yet when Yang Xuezhen frowned and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Lu, isn’t this making things difficult for him? He hasn’t even reached lower Lesser Sublime Heaven. How can he possibly be the Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger’s match?”

Lu Yuanjie smiled and said, “Junior Apprentice Sister, this boy is very haughty. Just a tiger, he shouldn’t have taken it seriously yet, right?”

Yang Xuezhen still wanted to say something, but heard Gui Tianyu say,?“Humph,?Junior Apprentice Sister, it’s just catching a tiger. You’re also protecting him too much, right? Moreover, Lu Qing and Gui Cheng will also be following him, they won’t let him die.”

Yang Xuezhen’s brows furrowed slightly, clearly being caught in a dilemma.

She was currently relying on these two people greatly and could not offend them too badly.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly said, “I’ll go!”

The moment Lu Yuanjie heard, he smiled and said, “That’s more like it! Being able to corroborate your Dao and achieve Heavenly Stratum in the Lower Realms, if you don’t even have this bit of courage, that’s also too disgraceful! Lu Qing, Gui Cheng, you guys follow this little brother. Both of you need to protect him well! If he isn’t the Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger’s match, you guys lend him a helping hand.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When he was talking, he deliberately placed emphasis on ‘helping hand’ two words.

Yang Xuezhen sighed slightly. Ye Yuan was courting death himself, she could not help it either.

She was currently unable to even fend for herself!

Yang Xuezhen was not a fool. How could she not understand Lu Yuanjie two people’s thoughts?

It was just that she was anxious to take revenge currently, and she already could not care that much anymore.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with the two and brought Lu Qing and Gui Cheng and directly left.

… …

An hour later, Lu Qing and Gui Chen ran back.

When Lu Yuanjie saw that there were only the two of them coming back, he was smiling.

But very soon, his face fell.

Not waiting for Lu Qing two people to open their mouths either, he berated, “Didn’t I ask you guys to ensure his safety? What’s going on? Can’t even handle this little thing well, what are you doing?”

Yang Xuezhen’s gaze swept towards the distance but did not see Ye Yuan’s figure. How could she not know what happened?

She let out a slight sigh and was silent.

Gui Cheng was just about to open his mouth, but then he heard Gui Tianyu yelling, “Gui Cheng, you good-for-nothing! Can’t even handle this small matter, how do you want me to give an account to Junior Apprentice Sister?”

Lu Yuanjie continued and said, “The two of you fools can’t even look after a person properly! Just a Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger, you guys actually let him get eaten?”

Gui Tianyu got more into it the more he scolded and said angrily, “What are the two of you still in a daze for, why haven’t you gone to apologize to Junior Apprentice Sister?”

Lu Qing and Gui Cheng sweated profusely from anxiety, but could not get a word in at all.

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu chimed in one after another, getting more enthusiastic the more they scolded, not giving them the chance to speak at all.

In their hearts, they already determined Ye Yuan to be dead.

“There’s no need to apologize. It was also pretty tiring for these two brothers to run back. You guys should reward them.” Right at this time, a voice suddenly sounded out, interrupting the two people’s performance.

The expression on the two people’s faces immediately became incomparably fascinating.

Only to see Ye Yuan carrying a double-winged tiger, currently walking towards the camp.

Pah!

Pah!

At virtually the same time, Lu Qing and Gui Cheng were given a slap.

The two people said in unison, “Idiots, why didn’t you say that earlier?!”

Lu Qing and Gui Cheng felt aggrieved!

It was only to hear Gui Cheng cover his face and said, “Young Master, I wanted to say, but I couldn’t speak up at all! This boy killed the Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger with one punch!”

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu’s bodies quivered, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

An ant who did not even reach lower Lesser Sublime Heaven, how could he possibly kill a Double-winged Heaven Shaking Tiger with one punch?
