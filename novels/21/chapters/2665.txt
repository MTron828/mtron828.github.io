Chapter 2671: Survival of the Fittest

“Huhu,?similarly you are a Song Family’s descendant, but Song Minzhe, you’re simply a piece of trash!”

“Just this bit of skill, you also dare to show off your incompetence in front of Brother Wenhao?”

“What a joke! The Song Family actually let you come and make up the numbers!”

… …

When Song Wenhao opened his mouth, there were immediately many people who concurred, helping to reprove Song Minzhe together.

Song Wenhao was popular and would definitely be an important person in the future.

Getting on his good terms at this time would be equivalent to climbing up a large tree!

Song Minzhe was Song Wenhao’s cousin. In this generation, he had a mediocre aptitude and barely managed to be sent over.

However, in the eyes of the Song Family, he was merely playing the character of accompanying the crown prince to study. It was impossible to be selected.

Normally, Song Wenhao looked down on this cousin and had no lack of disparaging him in the family.

“Big Brother, I don’t have the intention of displaying my slight skill before an expert. I just felt bored from waiting. So why not practice fire controlling technique to pass the time,” Song Minzhe said.

Pah!

Song Wenhao gave him a backhanded slap and shouted coldly, “Learned to talk back?huh!?Those who can come here, which one isn’t stronger than you? With your paltry skills, go back home if you want to be a disgrace. You coming here is losing face for the Song Family!”

Song Minzhe covered his face, but his eyes were very stubborn.

He did not feel that he did anything wrong!

Practicing fire controlling technique to pass the time was wrong too?

When Song Wenhao saw that Song Minzhe was not convinced, he was even more furious.

Bang!

He kicked Song Minzhe’s chest again, directly sending him flying with a kick.

“Presumptuous thing, you dare to look at me using this sort of eyes? This young master will beat you, this disobedient thing, to death!”

Creak!

Right at this time, the pill refining room’s door was suddenly opened.

Ye Yuan brought Cui Tong and the rest and walked in slowly.

“Third Hall Master is here!”

The group of geniuses were surprised and hurriedly stood in line.

Even Song Wenhao also reined in his arrogance and stood there respectfully.

Song Minzhe struggled to his feet and did not say anything. He just stood at one side quietly.

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept over everyone’s faces. All the geniuses felt short on breath, nervous to the extreme.

They did not know why. This person in front of them clearly had a similar cultivation realm as them. But when they faced Ye Yuan, they had a feeling of being seen through.

“For you guys to be able to come here, it means that you guys are all elite disciples in your families! However, being selected by your families doesn’t mean being selected by me too! This hall master has my own standards for choosing people. Now, you all practice by yourselves. Let this hall master take a look at your strength first!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Many people were immediately raring to go as soon as they heard it.

Just as Ye Yuan said, those who could come here were all elites.

They naturally wanted to display their strength in front of Ye Yuan, in hopes of being able to become Ye Yuan’s disciple.

That was true grade inheritance!

“Who’s first?” Ye Yuan said.

“I’ll go first!” Song Wenhao came forward on his own accord and was the first one to step out of the ranks.

Many people wanted to compete to be the first too, but seeing that Song Wenhao had made a move, they consciously backed out.

The first one to take the stage naturally had an advantage.

First impressions were the most lasting!

The earlier someone displayed their skills, the earlier it could capture people’s eyes.

Especially someone like Song Wenhao, the moment he made his move, it would seem dull and disinteresting afterward. The chances of being selected would clearly be much lower too.

Of course, this was also established on the foundation of strength.

If one did not have strength but took the stage first, there could only be the result of being beaten.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Okay, you’ll refine a grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!”

Song Wenhao smiled proudly and said, “Third Hall Master, the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is too simple, it can’t demonstrate my strength at all!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said with displeasure, “Are you testing this hall master? Or is it this hall master who’s testing you?”

When Song Wenhao saw that Ye Yuan got angry, he could not help being alarmed inwardly, and hurriedly said with embarrassment, “I-It’s naturally Third Hall Master who’s testing this disciple! Okay, the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill it is!”

When Song Wenhao made his move, he was indeed strong, immediately attracting a furor of exclamations.

To him, grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was simply child’s play. It was too easy.

Very soon, the heavenly pill came out of the furnace!

Without the slightest surprise, middle ninth grade!

To a grade two heavenly alchemist, being able to refine the grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to middle ninth grade was a very impressive thing in itself.

After coming down, Song Wenhao had a proud look on his face.

He believed that this heavenly pill could absolutely move Ye Yuan!

Unless he was blind!

Of course, Ye Yuan appeared very calm.

Song Wenhao was not very surprised. To really talk about geniuses, Ye Yuan was the most freakish one!

Being able to refine true grade heavenly pills at this age, this was a monster!

However, Song Wenhao would not be unduly humble either. In his view, Ye Yuan just had a better background than him.

Following this, the various major families’ genius disciples displayed their strength one after another.

Ye Yuan did not make them refine other heavenly pills either, it was all grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

Only after spending a full three days’ time did Ye Yuan finish watching all of these people.

However, when Song Minzhe was refining, Ye Yuan paid special attention and secretly nodded his head in his heart.

Actually, the things that happened here, Ye Yuan had long perceived it at a glance.

In reality, making them wait here was a part of the assessment in itself.

Ye Yuan had an impression of every person present.

After everyone finished refining, all the geniuses looked at Ye Yuan with looks of anticipation.

While Song Wenhao was brimming with confidence.

“Now, whoever I point to, stand over there.”

Ye Yuan slowly extended his hand and pointed at Song Wenhao first.

Song Wenhao revealed a smile like it was as expected, and stepped out of the ranks to stand at one side.

The others cast envious looks towards him one after another.

“You!”

“You!”

“You too!”

… …

Ye Yuan pointed one by one. Many of those he pointed at were the top geniuses of the various major families.

Even if some people were not as good as Song Wenhao, they were about the same too.

Ye Yuan pointed at more than 150 people in one go before stopping.

Those who were pointed at were all beside themselves with joy.

While those who were not pointed at had dejected faces because they lost a golden opportunity.

“You all can go back already!” Ye Yuan said to the 150 over people indifferently.

Song Wenhao was taken aback and said, “What … What did you say?”

Ye Yuan raised his volume a little as he said coolly, “I said, you all can go back already! The rest will become my disciples.”

As he said, Ye Yuan pointed in Song Minzhe that direction.

He was kept. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Song Wenhao opened his eyes wide, a look of disbelief as he said, “Third Hall Master, are … are you mistaken? This bunch of trash is going to become your disciples?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “What did you say?”

Song Wenhao suddenly raised his voice and said furiously, “Third Hall Master, you hold great power and authority, but us noble family disciples aren’t easy to bully either! Were you messing with us noble family descendants by having our families send us over? I really don’t know what kind of benchmark you’re using to assess, eliminating us geniuses and leaving behind these trash!?Huhu,?I, Song Wenhao, am not convinced!”

“I’m not convinced either!”

“I’m not convinced!”
