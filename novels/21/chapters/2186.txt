Chapter 2190: A Thousand Years in a Blink

Along the way, the devilish energy gradually grew thicker.

In the surroundings, some powerful auras appeared at times, and then disappeared.

These auras were much stronger than even Mosius’s.

Ye Yuan followed him. It was smooth along the way.

There were countless checkpoints they had to pass through. The two people finally arrived at a small-scale city.

When a guard saw Mosius, he asked, “Mosius, not garrisoning your own territory, what are you doing here?”

Ye Yuan noticed that the guards here were all Empyrean-level powerhouses!

Mosius hurriedly answered, “I’m here to meet Lord Manya. There’s an important matter to report.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The guard’s gaze landed on Ye Yuan and he said in a solemn voice, “Who is he?”

Mosius explained, “He’s my subordinate. This important information was discovered by him.”

The guard said coolly, “Lord Manya is currently trying to cheer the Divine Daughter up. I’m afraid that he doesn’t have time to meet you. You go to the courier station to rest first and await summons.”

Mosius was taken aback and said, “Divine Daughter? What Divine Daughter?”

The guard smiled and said, “You still don’t know? It’s that human female who was captured! Great Sage Nineorigin said that she’s the Divine Race’s Divine Daughter and is to be sent to the Abyss World. Otherwise ... how can she possibly live until now?”

Ye Yuan’s heart shook wildly when he heard that.

How did Li-er become a Divine Daughter?”

Also, what the hell was this Divine Race?

For some time, Ye Yuan’s heart was in an upheaval. It was as if this matter concerned some earth-shattering secrets.

“Your Excellency, this lowly one has a way to coax that human Divine Daughter to cheer up,” Ye Yuan said to the guard.

The guard was taken aback and said, “You really have a way? The Divine Daughter kicks up a row daily about wanting to return to the human race. It’s no use no matter how Lord Manya persuades her. His head is almost exploding! If you really have a way, that will be a major achievement.”

Ye Yuan said, “Your Excellency, rest assured. This lowly one will definitely accomplish it.”

The guard said, “Alright then, you guys go to the courier station first. I’ll go and report to Lord Manya.”

Mosius brought him to the courier station. Monstrous waves surged in Ye Yuan’s heart.

The abyss monsters here were no longer disorganized like he had seen before.

On the contrary, the abyss monsters in this city were like an army!

A city, courier station, guards, these were not things that a race like the abyss monsters would have.

Although the intelligence of abyss monsters was rather high, their world leaned more toward fierce beasts.

The weak were prey and the strong feasts; and the strong survived!

Also, hearing about the Divine Race and the Divine Daughter, what kind of place was this abyss space?

Asking Mosius, he was not clear either.

With his status, he could not come into contact with these at all.

Mosius was just a weakling who was banished outside.

He took orders from Manya, and Manya brought him here. That was all.

Also, there was this region of space. No matter how Ye Yuan looked, why did it seem like a sundered boundary connecting the abyss space and the Heavenspan World?

Since the Dragon Clan was suppressing the abyss space, it showed that that place was the only passageway.

Then what was the deal with this place?

For some time, countless doubts and suspicions lingered in Ye Yuan’s heart.

Not long after, that guard came to the courier status and found Ye Yuan.

When Manya heard that Ye Yuan could cheer the Divine Daughter up, he was overjoyed and made Ye Yuan go over at once.

When Manya saw Ye Yuan, he asked with uncertainty, “You can make the Divine Daughter feel at ease and stay?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Lord Manya, rest assured. Not completing the mission, this lowly one will carry my head to see you.”

Manya’s eyes lit up and he said with a big laugh, “Good! If you can make the Divine Daughter set her mind at rest and stay, this emperor will give you great rewards!”

Finished talking, Manya brought Ye Yuan and arrived at a stone house.

The stone house was very spacious, but the moment Ye Yuan got close, he discovered that a lot of restrictions were laid down in the perimeter.

These restrictions, Ye Yuan actually had never seen them before. They were very profound.

Clearly, this was in order to prevent Li-er from running.

Upon entering the door, two items flew over with a whoosh.

Inside the house, a woman’s angry yell came over, “Scram! I asked you all to get lost! Are you all deaf?”

But these words sounded like the most moving honeyed words in Ye Yuan’s ears.

How many years had he not heard this voice already?

This separation was already close to 2000 years!

Time did not wear away his feelings but made longing converge into a sea instead.

When that beautiful figure landed in his eyes, Ye Yuan’s heart that was firm as stone also melted.

“Sniff, sniff ... Big Brother Yuan, Li-er can’t see you ever again. Sorry ... really sorry ... Li-er ... Li-er didn’t do it on purpose!”

After the tantrum, Li-er lay on the table, crying her heart out.

Ye Yuan’s heart quivered, practically about to shed tears.

In his impression, Li-er was good-natured and lovely, graceful and dignified. She would never be so irascible.

But now, she knew that this departure would be eternal separation. That kind of hopeless feeling poured out from the depths of her heart, that was why she would become like this.

Manya had a depressed look. These few days, he was suffering Yue Mengli’s fury.

Manya gave Ye Yuan a look, Ye Yuan got the meaning and moved a few steps forward, bowing as he said, “Lord Divine Daughter, this lowly one has good news to tell you.”

Yue Mengli suddenly exploded and roared angrily, “I don’t want to hear any good news! You get lost for me! You ugly fellow, scram for me!”

Suddenly, Yue Mengli’s entire body trembled, staring fixedly at Ye Yuan’s eyes.

The boundless rage suddenly became tranquility.

Ye Yuan bowed his body, but a pair of eyes met with Yue Mengli’s.

One look was sufficient between him and Li-er!

Although this abyss monster in front of her, from external form, looking at the aura, she completely did not recognize, but no idea why, this look immediately made her quieten down.

Why did this look so familiar?

Why did this look so alike Big Brother Yuan’s?

He was clearly an abyss monster, so why ...

Li-er’s entire person turned stiff there.

Manya’s gaze flickered! There was a chance!

Yue Mengli’s reaction was also quick, her pretty face turning cold as she said, “What good news, say!”

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “The human race that side sent people to come and find Divine Daughter.”

Yue Mengli’s heart quivered and she said, “What happened to them?”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “What else can there be? They were naturally sent packing by Lord Mosius.”

Yue Mengli’s brows furrowed, and she reproached, “You this fellow, deliberately showing off in front of me is it?”

The moment Manya heard that things were going wrong, he hurriedly scolded, “You damn thing, intentionally using this news to anger Divine Daughter?”

But who knew that Yue Mengli waved her hand and said to Manya, “Forget it, you withdraw first! Since there’s that side’s news, I want to hear him say.”

Manya hurriedly answered and withdrew.

As long as this ancestor stopped kicking up a row, all would be fine and right with the world.

Leaving Ye Yuan behind to chat with her also seemed to be a pretty good choice.

He was not scared of Ye Yuan bringing Yue Mengli and running away either. After all, the restrictions here were laid down from Lord Nineorigin.

Even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse could forget about escape from here too!

The moment Manya left, Yue Mengli’s gaze looked at Ye Yuan somewhat blurry as she said, “The look in your eyes ... is very similar to an old friend of mine!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, chaos world power quietly releasing, wrapping him and Li-er up inside.
