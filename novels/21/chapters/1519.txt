Chapter 1523 Understanding Strike

“Hahaha, this last round’s guardian is really amusing. To actually overestimate his own ability and suppress his realm. Now, he knows Ye Yuan’s prowess, right?”

“This is purely being bored and looking for trouble. Being able to make it to the eighteenth level, can one’s strength be poor?”

“Heh, he seems to look down on Source Night a lot. With this, his face is smacked resoundingly, right?”

...

Although they could not hear the conversation inside the space, from the general look, one could still infer Zheng Jian’s attitude.

That arrogant and condescension, one could distinctly feel it even through the projection.

Although these geniuses outside disliked Ye Yuan a lot, for Ye Yuan to be able to make it to the eighteenth round, at any rate he represented them.

Zheng Jian could defeat Ye Yuan, even kill Ye Yuan, but could not look down on him.

This was slapping all of their faces!

Under this kind of strange psychological influence, seeing Zheng Jian get smacked in the face by Ye Yuan, he felt very liberated instead.

“Source Night’s situation likely isn’t good anymore. This eighteenth round’s guardian is indeed powerful. He’s not what those people previously could compare to at all,” Ba Tu suddenly said.

Regarding this, Di Fan clearly also quite agreed and said with a nod, “If my conjectures are right, Source Night probably already did his best just now! While this guardian still suppressed his realm.”

Ba Tu said with vicissitudes of emotion, “I really want to enter the place personally and watch this fight. This is absolutely the pinnacle battle of Fiend General Realm.”

...

Recovering to half-step Origin Deity Realm, Zheng Jian’s entire person gave off an erratic aura.

“Ready to die?”

Zheng Jian gave a cold laugh, his figure gradually becoming blurry.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly. The Misty Sword Art suddenly unleashed, his entire person similarly vanishing in place.

The two people seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

In the void, metal clashed. Streaks of cold light flashed by from time to time.

Two people, one was spatial laws, one was the law of wind, their movement techniques were both extremely strange.

After Zheng Jian recovered to half-step Origin Deity, his entire person’s strength immediately soared a great deal.

To experts like them, the impact of a minor realm was seriously too great.

“So fast! Totally can’t capture their figures!”

“Turns out that this is their true strength! Too terrifying!”

“Even though I can sense the law undulations, they can insta-kill me by just relying on this movement technique!”

“I really want to know just who has the upper-hand right now!”

...

At the outside world, those geniuses could not see Ye Yuan duo’s battle at all. They could only occasionally catch traces of blurry figures.

Such a battle, made them incomparably stifled.

The same Fiend General Realm, the strength was simply a world of difference!

Ba Tu and Di Fan both had solemn faces. Only all the way until this moment were they now convinced that Ye Yuan’s strength was really not what they could compare to. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The fights previously, Ye Yuan utilizing spatial laws tend to be just that one instant.

But now, Ye Yuan virtually operated spatial laws to the limit, his entire person seemingly shuttling through the void.

The Eminent Orchid Six Sons could not keep up with Ye Yuan’s speed at all.

“I understand! Source Night integrated other powers of laws in his Sword Dao laws, that’s why we couldn’t see through the mystery!” Ba Tu suddenly cried out, having a sudden realization.

But straight away, his brows furrowed together again and he racked his brain hard and said, “But what kind of law is it? Law of wind?”

“It’s spatial law!” Di Fan suddenly spoke up.

Ba Tu’s gaze turned intent and he immediately retorted, “Impossible! Spatial laws are one of the two great paramount laws! How can he possibly comprehend it?”

Di Fan gave him a glance and said coolly, “You look closely, Source Night’s movement technique disappears and reappears again, not leaving traces, just like traversing through the void! Only spatial laws can do it to this extent! That guardian’s movement technique is also extremely fast. Even though his traces are erratic, there are still traces that can be followed. It should be the law of wind!”

Di Fan’s vision was very sharp. Two mighty experts’ showdown forced himself to the limit, finally letting him see through a trace of inkling.

Ba Tu looked carefully. Sure enough, it was as Di Fan said.

Although the two people’s figures were unable to be captured, looking closely, they were indeed slightly different.

This shock was by no means insignificant!

“This ... How is this possible? This guy ... is also too freakish, right?” Ba Tu sucked in a cold breath and said.

Di Fan’s expression was likewise very solemn and he said, “This can explain why he could defeat those guardians previously! His sword looks plain and ordinary. Actually, it’s just that our naked eye can’t capture it! His sword has actually already passed through the void and killed his opponent!”

“No wonder! No Wonder! Actually, dealing with those people earlier with his strength was originally very easy. It’s just that he wanted to borrow his opponents to practice the sword! Hiss ...”

Ba Tu suddenly felt that this world was filled with malice.

How could there be such a freakish existence, to actually be able to comprehend spatial laws?!

Right then, the two people’s battle in the projection came to an abrupt halt, revealing their figures.

Everyone’s faces changed.

“Source Night lost!”

“As expected, his realm is at too much of a disadvantage!”

“But, being able to do it to this step, he’s already very incredible!”

“A freak who comprehended spatial laws, his future accomplishments are limitless!”

...

In the projection, Ye Yuan’s breathing was chaotic. He was covered with injuries all over. He was already an arrow at the end of its flight.

On the other hand, Zheng Jian was completely unscathed.

This battle did not seem to have any suspense.

“You lost! I admit that you’re very decent. Being able to force me to use 80% power, you can be sufficiently proud,” Zheng Jian said coldly.

Ye Yuan said with a slight pant, “80% power, is it? Why don’t ... you try using 100% of your power.”

Ye Yuan did not doubt Zheng Jian’s words. Such an arrogant person would not stoop to lying.

Zheng Jian’s brows furrowed and he said, “No need. As the round guardian, as long as you can win 80% of my power, it’s considered successfully clearing the round. However, you can’t do it!”

Ye Yuan cracked a smile and said, “If I insist on making you use 100% of your power?”

Zheng Jian’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “In that case, you’ll die!”

Regarding Ye Yuan’s strength, he was already very clear.

In the battle just now, Ye Yuan already unleashed all of his skill and used Daybreak and the Misty Sword Art at the same time. But was unable to break through Zheng Jian’s sword net at all.

Zheng Jian’s power of laws was too powerful and his realm was also higher than Ye Yuan’s. This was practically a certain defeat scenario.

“Heh, if you can kill me, feel free to bring it on! Use 100% of your power, let me take a look at just how formidable you, the proclaimed strongest disciple in the Purple Extreme Sect’s history, are!”

Zheng Jian’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “Have you thought it through?”

Ye Yuan swung his sword horizontally and said coolly, “Thought it through!”

Zheng Jian nodded slightly and said, “Many geniuses all die being presumptuous, clearly ... you’re the same too! Since you seek death wholeheartedly, then ... I’ll see you off!”

After done talking, Zheng Jian displayed his stance, the aura on his body suddenly changed.

“Understanding Sword Art ... Understanding Strike!” Zheng Jian said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed and he blurted out, “Selfless Realm!”
