Chapter 2349: Ye Yuan Returns!

“I know about that kid you’re talking about. Isn’t he that ancestor of Alchemy Dao who has been in the limelight recently? Heh heh, after the alchemy path declined, no one can lift up the big banner anymore. A bunch of ignorant fellows, they are playing very enthusiastically by themselves. There’s not the least bit of help with regards to the overall situation at all.”

“I know about Cloudheart Realm’s matters. This kid’s talent is indeed pretty good. But unfortunately, he still can’t stir up any waves among these unpredictable children!”

“Speaking of which, I still feel more optimistic about Xiao Qingsong, Huang Lin, Pang Zhen, and Wan Zhen they all! When they come out this time, they might become our human race’s main pillars!”

... ...

The few old men looked at the newest release of God of War Golden List, all revealing looks of disdain.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was silent by the side, also not knowing what he was thinking about.

However, being able to talk in front of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets like this, these people present were naturally all the human, demon, and fiend races’ top major powers.

At this time, a middle-aged man dressed in a blue daoist robe suddenly said to Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, “Profound Secrets, you take every conceivable possibility into account, but this time ... you probably miscalculated! This boy isn’t worth our grooming!”

There was a lightning mark at the glabella area of the blue-robed middle-aged man.

There was no overly powerful aura on his body, but in his eyes, it was as if it was a vast sea of lightning.

Inside, a powerful to the extreme aura faintly exuded; extremely terrifying.

That look seemed to be able to destroy the world!

This was the incomparably mysterious Dao Ancestor Lightning!

His words could be said to hold tremendous weight.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets selecting the human race geniuses, it was impossible for Dao Ancestors to not pay the slightest attention.

To them, the Doomsday Battle this time was similarly a life-and-death trial.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets just said coolly, “This old man absolutely won’t be wrong in judging people! Lightning, I know that you harbor selfish motives, but with this old man’s experience, Pang Zhen can’t succeed your position as Dao Ancestor Lightning.”

During the Primeval War Realm struggle this time, the various major sovereigns all had progenies who were selected.

The Fifth Blight progenitors present as well as Lightning, this spokesperson of the Dao Ancestors, all hope that their offspring could obtain the final victory.

The Pang Zhen that Profound Secrets spoke of was precisely Dao Ancestor Lightning’s descendant.

This Pang Zhen was of the innate Lightning Dao Body. His comprehension of lightning law and his talent were extremely terrifying.

Before entering the Primeval War Realm, he already comprehended the power of source, and his combat power was unparalleled.

“Profound Secrets! Can’t you say something nicer sounding!” Dao Ancestor Lightning said in a solemn voice.

Everyone felt terrified. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets actually said that Dao Ancestor Lightning harbored selfish motives to his face.

To dare talk to Dao Ancestor Lightning like this, there was probably only Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets alone!

Profound Secrets said coolly, “This old man is just discussing the matter as it is. The few of you Dao Ancestors want to continue your glory. But first of all, the human race can’t fall! Concerning this point, this old man hopes that you guys are clear. Therefore, the battle of geniuses this time, strength determines everything!”

Lightning sneered and said, “What a joke! With Pang Zhen’s strength, can he still lose to a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor brat?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets just smiled faintly and said, “Then, let’s wait and see.”

... ...

In the Primeval War Realm, a hundred years passed after a hundred years. In a blink, it had already been more than 800 years!

After more than 800 years, the competition of the God of War Golden List also became increasingly intense.

A hundred cities, only the God of War Golden List’s top ten had the qualifications to win in the end, and enter the Temple of Gods to accept the legacies.

This was a massive lucky chance!

For each city, the competition for the top ten was abnormally fierce. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Each time the God of War Golden List was released, the changes of the top ten would be huge.

Of course, there were also some powerhouses who stood out among the rest. They sat firmly in the top spot, their status could not be shaken by anyone.

Such as Wan Zhen, such as Pang Zhen, so on and so forth.

These unpredictable children, in this close to 1000 years, their improvement was so great that it was simply hard to imagine.

Their strength already reached an inconceivable height.

Except, among these people, Ye Yuan seemed to have vanished.

Even those guys who had once ridiculed him before, they already forgotten about his existence.

“The last ten years! Looks like Ye Yuan that kid really failed!” Wan Zhen’s words revealed a thick disappointment.

Time law was too difficult. With his talent, he was unable to comprehend it.

Primeval War Realm’s cultivation was too hard to come across to them, these unpredictable children.

Ye Yuan spent all of his time on this kind of unrealistic action, it was equivalent to wasting this rare opportunity.

Wan Zhen felt that it was too much of a shame.

“Heh, it’s that kid’s own choice, who can it be blamed on? We all urged him back then, but he wouldn’t listen at all! In this Primeval War Realm. How many have the talent that surpasses yours? Moreover, even if their talent surpasses yours, can they comprehend time law?” Zhang Lian said disdainfully.

“Forget it, not talking about him anymore! In the last ten years, the God of War Golden List is announced once every year! I plan on going to the Myriad Beast Battle Plain to train, are you going?” Wan Zhen said.

In Cloudaid City, the only one who could pose a threat to him was Zhang Lian.

Toward this opponent, Wan Zhen still regarded him very highly.

Zhang Lian smiled brightly, his looks able to topple kingdoms, and said, “That’s of course! This is my only chance to surpass you. So how can I not give it a shot?”

Wan Zhen nodded and said, “Okay, set off together!”

Myriad Beast Battle Plain, was the most dangerous place within Cloudaid City’s territory.

The fierce beasts there were not only huge in numbers, furthermore, each one was extremely powerful.

Even with Wan Zhen’s current strength, he also did not have confidence in coming out alive.

Actually, not just them, the unpredictable children ranked in the top 50 would probably all choose the Myriad Beast Battle Plain as the final land of trial.

Because this was their last chance!

But not long after they left, a youth in white robes slowly entered Cloudaid City.

“Yo, isn’t this our son of time? Spent more than 800 years, came back after comprehending time law? My heavens, impressive!”

“The last ten years, is our son of time going to defy the heavens? Tsk tsk, what a shame, the disparity is too great!”

“That might not be it! He grasped time law. So his strength is definitely Cloudaid City’s number one already! Ten years is sufficient for him to charge for first place! Hahaha!”

... ...

Upon entering the city, Ye Yuan heard a series of harsh ridicules.

No one else, they were precisely Jiang Zhe and co.

As a source powerhouse, Jiang Zhe’s improvement in strength these few years was extremely terrifying too.

His ranking already ranked around 2000, becoming a golden list powerhouse!

Even though it was very hard to obtain god of war points, after more than 900 years of accumulation, the current God of War Golden List’s god of war points was already an extremely horrifying number.

Especially those like Wan Zhen, their god of war points was unimaginably high!

Assaulting the top ten in ten years’ time was simply something impossible.

Ye Yuan did not care about Jiang Zhe’s mocking. He walked straight to Spirit Treasure Hall.

It was still Redleaf, it was just that circumstances already changed with the passing of time.

“Sir Ye hasn’t come for very long already. What are you buying this time?” Redleaf said smilingly.

“Jade True Swords, 1000 of them!” Ye Yuan said coolly.
