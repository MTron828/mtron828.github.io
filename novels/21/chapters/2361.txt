Chapter 2367: Spacetime Vortex!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Rumble!

Suddenly, the earth quaked and mountains swayed.

In the Primeval War Realm, three towering palaces rose from ground up, and slowly flew into the air.

The three palaces varied in size. The largest one had a circumference of 100 thousand feet.

While the smallest one was only a thousand feet.

“What a powerful aura of law! These are the inheritance palaces?”

“Surprisingly, the smallest one, its law undulation is the scariest! Could it be that that’s the one and only supreme inheritance?”

“Really envy them! This is the human race’s crème de la crème of inheritances.”

... ...

Each and every one of the one million unpredictable children revealed incredibly envious expressions.

It’s just that those who were able to enter the inheritance divine temples were only a scanty thousand people.

Of course, who people were most envious of was still the Ye Yuan who could monopolize a temple.

They really wanted to know just what kind of inheritance was inside that smallest inheritance divine temple.

“The battle of geniuses is over. Those who didn’t obtain an inheritance can leave! However, the Doomsday Battle has already begun. No one can stay aloof from the affair. If the human race isn’t united, we can only become the divine race’s slaves! Everyone, conduct yourselves well!”

Above the void, came Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ warning voice, making everyone’s hearts turn cold.

Very soon, the figures of one million unpredictable children directly dissipated on the spot. They were already transported out of the Primeval War Realm by Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets.

Those who remained in the Primeval War Realm were only left with those 1000 people already.

“Right now, you all enter the palaces respectively according to your rank. Ye Yuan, you got first place, enter the smallest palace. Wan Zhen and the rest of the ten people, enter the second palace. The others enter the third palace. This old man will still give you all ten years, which is also a thousand years’ time. How much you can comprehend, will depend on yourselves!”

Finished saying, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s voice disappeared.

A thousand unpredictable children exchanged glances. There was already someone who started flying over in the direction of the inheritance palaces.

Ye Yuan assumed his responsibility and flew towards that smallest palace.

When Wan Zhen and the rest of the ten saw this scene, they all had looks of envy, jealousy, and hatred.

Originally, this spot should have been born among them. In the end, someone threw a wrench in the works, and they were actually intercepted by Ye Yuan.

Among their circle of the top-level geniuses, they had never heard of such a person before.

Where in the world did this guy pop out from?

As for the alchemy world’s affairs, they would never pay attention to it at all.

The alchemy world was not worth mentioning to them.

In the Doomsday Battle, the alchemy world had a negligible effect on the human race. They naturally held it in contempt too.

“Stop looking around! Keep looking and your eyeballs will drop out! Time is pressing, better hurry up and comprehend the Dao!”

At this time, Wan Zhen suddenly smiled, flying toward the second palace with a leap.

A thousand years seemed very long, but with regards to gaining enlightenment on Dao, it was merely a snap of a finger.

Otherwise, why would the power of laws of those old monsters who had lived for a trillion years be not as good as Ye Yuan?

Even if these were all prodigies among geniuses, a thousand years’ time was really not considered long.

... ...

Stepping into the palace, a source power that was strong until it made people suffocate, hit him head-on.

It was another space inside the palace!

Accurately speaking, it was a vortex, a vortex composed of time law and spatial law.

“Hiss ... What a powerful spacetime law! Even if this power of law didn’t reach the power of rules, it’s also not far off, right?”

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not help drawing a cold breath. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

These two power of laws were simply too strong. It was strong to the extent that he, this proud son of heaven, was also amazed by it.

His attainments in spatial law could be said to be extremely strong already.

But compared to the spacetime vortex in front of him, it simply paled in comparison.

“Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said, these power of laws were all refined by the human race’s major powerhouses who died in the last epoch. Doesn’t that mean that the human race’s major powers back then could actually cultivate these two kinds of supreme laws close to the level of Dao Ancestor at the same time? This ... This is also too terrifying!”

Ye Yuan suddenly thought of something, the shock in his heart growing even more.

It seemed like in the last epoch, the human race was really glorious to the extreme!

Being able to cultivate two great supreme laws to this kind of level, their strength was likely not inferior to Dao Ancestors anymore, right?

This kind of powerful existence actually fell in the Doomsday Battle too. Ye Yuan simply did not dare to imagine how strong the divine race’s progenitors were.

Most likely, what they were able to mobilize was not just the power of laws already, but the power of rules!

The more he understood the human race’s glorious past, the more Ye Yuan was able to understand the might of the divine race.

Of course, he also understood Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ worries more.

With the human race’s strength currently, there was no chance of winning at all!

Whatever Divine Son, Daymeld, whatever Profound Lineage’s nine elders, whatever Daymeld, these were all not the most terrifying existences.

The most terrifying thing was still the divine race’s progenitors!

Their might was simply unimaginable.

Being able to beat such a glorious human race until their legacies were close to being cut off, and not even regain their vitality for an epoch, the divine essence’s terror was evident at a glance.

“Sigh, it’s just that, don’t know how Li-er is currently.” Ye Yuan suddenly felt melancholy in his heart.

“Brat, this ancestor senses the power of spacetime law in you. Unfortunately, it’s too weak! Are you the number one genius that Profound Secrets that brat picked? Too weak!”

Suddenly, a faint phantom walked out of the spacetime vortex, looking at Ye Yuan with a disappointed look.

When Ye Yuan heard that, his expression could not help being strange.

He annihilated 17 of the Heavenspan World’s top geniuses with his power alone to be standing here.

But reaching this old man’s mouth, he became too weak.

However, he could also understand the old man’s thoughts. After all, his power of laws was indeed too weak compared to the spacetime vortex in front of him.

Ye Yuan gave a bow toward the old man and said, “Junior Ye Yuan offers greetings to Senior!”

This old man perished for the human race, he was worthy of Ye Yuan’s bow.

He could tell that this old man was not some remnant soul, and also not some residual thought. He was merely just a remnant wisp of consciousness that was in the power of laws. That was all.

But just a wisp of consciousness already made Ye Yuan have a feeling of being daunted at the sight of him. It could be seen how terrifying an existence he was before his death.

The old man waved his hand and said to Ye Yuan, “You’re too weak to accept this ancestor’s inheritance! Leave!”

Ye Yuan could not help being taken aback when he heard that. This old man was actually not even giving him any chance?

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “Senior hasn’t tried it. How do you know that junior can’t receive the inheritance?”

The old man said coolly, “Spacetime law is the most profound, most mysterious power of law in the world! Especially reaching the level of source, it’s not what you can imagine at all! Your spatial law is pretty good, but it’s just an accessory to Sword Dao! Wanting to step into the level of source is virtually impossible. As for time law, it goes even more without saying. I believe that you also have an idea in your heart, right? Therefore, don’t tell me how brilliant you are; you just couldn’t do it!”
