Among eight million Saint Sovereign Heavens, which realm had the most numbers?

This realm occupied the vast majority.

And this realm was actually basically all cannon fodders too.

Occasionally amazing the world with a single brilliant feat and being able to kill their way into the top 100 was already considered pretty good.

There was no chance for the top ten at all.

This was because the powerhouses at the top of the pyramid were all grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens and half-step True Sovereign Heavens!

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s words were really very laughable.

“Huhu, kid, I remembered you. I’ll choose the same passageway as you!” Chou Yang looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold laugh.

Yang Qing swept a glance at Chou Yang like looking at a fool and said to Ye Yuan, “This guy wouldn’t be a moron, right?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “He’s clearly an idiot. Talking with idiots will make you dumb. Let’s

80.”

Yang Qing deeply felt that way too. “Right, right, hurry up!” After done talking, the two people left straight away and completely did not have the intention of paying any attention to Chou Yang. Chou Yang’s face turned into the color of pig liver.

F*cking hell, too arrogant!

Facing this scene, many people held the attitude of gloating over others’ misfortune.

“Chou Yang followed! Heh, there’s a good show to watch now. Chou Yang won’t let him off!” “It turns out that seeking death is done this way!”

“I’ll follow that kid too. This good show can’t be missed!”

......

Many people also followed Ye Yuan two people, seeing which passageway he was entering.

Eight million people, a moment of carelessness and you would lose them.

The entrances of True Sovereign Heavens and Saint Sovereign Heavens were not in the same place. So very soon, Ye Yuan and Yang Qing were splitting up.

Ye Yuan arrived at the passageway entrance, and the guard said, “Entering from which passageway?”

Ye Yuan asked, “Which passageway is the strongest currently?”

The guard gave Ye Yuan a glance and said, “The strongest at present should be the number one passageway.”

Ye Yuan said, “Number one then.”

The guard was not long-winded either, directly sending Ye Yuan into the number one passageway.

Giant Net City’s powerhouses opened up two enormous spaces in the battle hunting ground to carry out the hundred sons selection.

The fights in the spaces would be presented in the battle hunting ground, hundreds of thousands of people would be able to see them clearly.

There were a total of 100 Saint Sovereign Heaven passageways, ten as one group.

In each passageway, only 100 people could enter the next level.

In the end, the 1000 powerhouses in a group would fight for one spot!

This way of fighting was extremely cruel.

Each hundred sons selection, the casualties were virtually more than half in order to fight for these ten spots!

One had to know, even if the blood race was brutal, wanting to kill the opponent was very difficult too.

But, out of eight million Saint Sovereign Heavens, it actually needed nearly four million people to die. It could be seen how cruel such a selection was. However, the blood race did not care!

Their propagation ability was extremely strong and could nurture a large batch of powerhouses again very soon.

But this kind of method that was the survival of the fittest could create a large batch of powerhouses!

Therefore, the powerhouses that displayed their abilities and advanced to the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, those were all true powerhouses, their strength extremely terrifying!

Many of these people even had the strength to kill True Sovereign Heavens!

When Ye Yuan killed three Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons back then, it could be seen to what kind of extent his strength was formidable.

Presently, Ye Yuan broke through to upper Saint Sovereign Heaven. His strength grew significantly again.

With regards to this level of selection, he naturally did not take it to heart.

And this kind of selection, the strong who truly had faith in themselves would all choose the number one passageway. That represented confidence and glory!

Then why did Ye Yuan choose the number one passageway? He wanted to kill!

These people were all the blood race’s seeded candidates, all future Emperor Realm powerhouses.

Each one killed, Heaven One would have one more iota of hope.

Seeing Ye Yuan enter the number one passageway, Chou Yang’s brows furrowed slightly.

His strength was very strong, but if he entered group one, then he would have to fight to the bitter end with those few people.

At that time, he really might not be able to get a spot.

He naturally did not feel that Ye Yuan entered the number one passageway in order to get a spot. He was clearly playing tricks to make him not dare to enter.

As for Ye Yuan, as long as he did not fight to the bitter end after entering, there would not be a problem surviving.

In the passageway, if those who were scared to die hid at one side, no one would find trouble with you.

But, if you wanted to snatch the passageway opening, then there would be countless people fighting it out to the bitter end with you!

Clearly, Ye Yuan did not have that strength.

“Impressive! That kid actually went into the number one passageway!”

“Number one passageway, that’s where immortals fight! I heard that Bloodtrue, Xue Hao, He Ming ... these big shots all entered the number one passageway!”

“If Chou Yang were to enter the number one passageway, there’s definitely no problem entering the next level. But, it would be difficult to want to get a spot!”

“He got slapped badly by that kid just now. If he doesn’t go in, his face will be lost!”

... ...

Seeing Ye Yuan enter the number one passageway, many who followed all started whispering to each other.

Chou Yang’s face turned into the color of pig liver again.

“Damn it! This punk definitely did it on purpose!” Chou Yang said hatefully.

However, there were already quite a few people who followed after behind him.

He already sent out the big talk just now. If he were to shrink back at this time, then he would really become a laughing stock.

Hesitating for a moment, he gritted his teeth and said in a solemn voice, “So what if Bloodtrue? Could it be that I, Chou Yang, am scared of you?”

Finished saying, he immediately went into the number one passageway.

The grandstand immediately boiled over with excitement!

“Chou Yang entered the number one passageway too!”

“Terrific fellow, the number one passageway is really where immortals fight!” “Counting in Chou Yang, there are probably half of Giant Net City’s top experts who already entered the number one passageway!”

“It’s really a death group! I heard that Bloodtrue’s strength has likely already reached the top 50 strength of the hundred sons!”

“The others aren’t bad either! Although there are only a hundred sons each time, those who get eliminated with the strength of the hundred sons aren’t in the minority.”

“Yeah, at least Bloodtrue, Xue Hao, Chou Yang, He Ming, the few of them should all have hopes of winning this spot!”

Chou Yang few people were all seeded candidates.

Their every movement and action attracted a lot of attention.

At this time, great gods gathered in the number one passageway. It completely ignored everyone’s enthusiasm for watching the battle.

Only this kind of battle was nice to watch!

Only this was exciting!

This money was not spent in vain!

As for Ye Yuan, nobody paid attention to him at all.

An upper Saint Sovereign Heaven, who would pay attention to him?

Time slowly trickled by. Eight million people chose their passageway one after another.

The 100 passageways were evenly distributed.

If a passageway was full, it would not be allowed to be chosen anymore.

And in reality, the people who chose the first group’s ten passageways were very few instead.

This was because this was absolutely a death group! Even if you entered the top 1000, it was very hard to fight for that sole spot too.

There were too many powerhouses!

Of course, there were also quite a few true powerhouses who opted for a tactical concession.

After all, obtaining the slot to enter the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons was the king’s way.

Showing off momentary bravery here did not have any meaning.

Just as those people said, many who had the strength of the hundred sons were all eliminated in the end and even died.

But the reality was so cruel!

Obtain the hundred sons spot, soar to the heavens in one bound!

Failing to obtain it, fade into the crowd!

“It’s over. It’s over! I entered the first group!”

“F*ck, just a bit slow!”

“It’s hopeless now!”

......

Very soon, the selection of the passageways was completed. Many people were all lamenting the cause was lost.

Entering the death group, they became hopeless.
