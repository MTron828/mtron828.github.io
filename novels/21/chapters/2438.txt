Chapter 2444: Make Way!

“Do you all know? The nine great Dao Ancestors’ faces at that time were livid! Someone that even nine great Dao Ancestors can’t keep behind is absolutely the most amazing existence since time immemorial!”

In the crowd, Bao Inquire talked about the scene at that time with a look of exultation, a look of enrapture on his face.

While the Heavenly Emperors next to him opened their mouths wide with shocked faces.

Although they did not believe it, this did not prevent them from being shocked.

The news of nine great Dao Ancestors joining hands to deal with Ye Yuan, but Ye Yuan leaving unrestrainedly, already spread throughout the entire Heavenspan World like the wind.

It was just that, those who knew the details, was none other than Bao Inquire.

Bao Inquire’s strength was not strong, but his ability to inquire about news was top-notch.

Presently, these people around him seemed to be listening to a book from heaven, listening to the story of Ye Yuan’s unrestrained departure.

“Bao Inquire, you’re also too bullshit, right? Nine great Dao Ancestors locked down space with the power of rules, how did Saint Azure escape?” Someone questioned.

Bao Inquire chuckled and said, “This is also the most, most mysterious thing! So far, probably even the nine great Dao Ancestors haven’t figured out how Lord Saint Azure did it, right? But I heard that there’s a massive secret on Lord Saint Azure!”

He clearly knew that these people would question. After all, this matter was too fantastical.

Although the news already came out, the vast majority of the people felt that this incident was fake!

In their hearts, Ye Yuan should have passed the nine great Dao Ancestors’ test and was released.

Such an explanation was more reasonable.

“What secret?” Sure enough, everyone was drawn by his words.

Bao Inquire’s eyes also revealed a hint of solemnness as he said, “I heard that he has the secret to break through the shackles of Dao Ancestor on him!”

“What?! Bao Inquire, this joke of yours is also too much, right?”

“Yeah, breaking through Dao Ancestor’s shackle?! I heard that even the divine race’s major powers can’t break the shackles of Dao Ancestor.”

“Bao Inquire, your boasting is becoming more and more outlandish! Hahaha ...”

... ...

Actually, the events of that day, the news that really transmitted out were extremely, extremely little.

No idea what channel this Bao Inquire used either, to have actually inquired quite a bit of inside news.

It was just that this piece of news was too earth-shattering and already exceeded people’s understanding.

Therefore, even if said, it was also treated as a joke by people.

Bao Inquire just chuckled and said, “What the hell do you guys know! Originally, I also thought that the nine great Dao Ancestors summoned Saint Azure for the human race’s safety. But, only all the way until Lord Saint Azure exposed this matter was the objective of the nine great Dao Ancestors completely bared there and then!”

He paused for a bit and continued, “Although there’s no solid proof for this, you all use your brains and think. The nine great Dao Ancestors raised a big rumpus to deal with a martial artist who just entered Deva; don’t you all find it odd? Furthermore, Lord Saint Azure’s awe-inspiring righteous aura rippled out in all directions on Origin Enlighten Mountain. Tens of millions of martial artists spontaneously rectified his name, how can he possibly betray the human race? This logic, even we can understand it. So would Dao Ancestors not understand? If not, what can move nine great Dao Ancestors at the same time?”

Bao Inquire’s analysis was too articulate, making the group of Heavenly Emperors draw a cold breath.

If this matter was true, then it was simply incredible!

“But what’s above Dao Ancestor? Is there really someone who can surpass Dao Ancestor in this world?”

Bao Inquire’s gaze was deep as he said, “Then there’s only waiting for that day when Lord Saint Azure returns! Currently, the nine great Dao Ancestors have already declared that Saint Azure betrayed the human race. Everyone has the right to punish. It’s just that there are barely any who believe it! But it’s probably irreconcilable till death between Saint Azure and the nine great Dao Ancestors!”

The group of Heavenly Emperors were extremely shocked. There was actually someone who was irreconcilable till death with the nine great Dao Ancestors!

This matter was definitely an eternally strange tale!

... ...

When the entire Heavenspan World was in a stir about this, Ye Yuan already embarked on the road to the west.

The nine great Dao Ancestors jointly announced to strip Saint Azure of his title and viewed him as the traitor of the human race.

Except, there were few believers. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The battle of Origin Enlighten Mountain Range was too sensational.

Coupled with Ye Yuan’s prestige in the human race, there were barely any who believed Lin Chaotian their rubbish.

Walking along the way, Ye Yuan did not cover up his tracks.

Many powerhouses saw Ye Yuan and directly let him pass, without any intention of stopping at all.

Especially the land of the Western Realms, it was the land where Ye Yuan fought dauntlessly in bloody battles. His prestige was even more unbelievably high.

There were even many powerhouses who knew that he was passing through and even took the initiative to come up to say hello.

One needed to admit, it was kind of ironic.

At this time, Ye Yuan was currently standing in front of the entrance of the Abyss Suppressing Eight Realms, sighing ruefully.

There was already a large number of abyss monster corpses that fell in front of him.

Back then, he entered the Abyss Suppressing Eight Realms from here and had a great battle with the Dragon Clan.

At present, this place already became a wasteland. There was devilish energy everywhere and no longer the natural grace in the past.

The eight great supreme demon clans had lasted here for as long as ten billion years for the sake of guarding the abyss.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets also planned for a long time for the resurgence of the human race.

But, the nine great Dao Ancestors stood at the pinnacle of the Heavenspan World, what had they done?

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan’s body had uncontrollable killing intent spilling out.

Reaching the human race’s life and death juncture, these few fellows were actually still coveting the secret on him.

It was not that his Chaos Heavenspan Canon could not be spread. It was just that his cultivation system was too unique. The nine great Dao Ancestors’ foundation had already been established and it was simply impossible to cultivate.

Otherwise, Ye Yuan would have long passed it on.

Although this cultivation method was precious, in front of the human race’s cardinal principles of righteousness, Saint Profound could even give up his life. So how could he not bear to give up a mere cultivation method?

“You ... Don’t you get too smug! The divine race’s lords are currently on the way and are about to arrive soon!” A Deva Realm abyss monster said fearfully.

As Ye Yuan advanced, he said coolly, “I’m just going to the Abyss World to take a look. Those who block me, die!”

The group of abyss monsters exchanged glances, their faces dumbfounded.

Both sides had already been fighting for many years. They had never seen before such an arrogant person, to actually dare to enter the Abyss World alone!

This guy was too arrogant!

Before long, a large group of divine race powerhouses arrived.

The one in the lead was a middle-stage Nine-marks powerhouse.

When he saw Ye Yuan, his expression could not help changing wildly as he cried out in shock, “You ... You’re Ye Yuan!”

Hearing this name, the expressions of the divine race members and abyss monsters who were traveling with him all changed wildly.

This name was simply a nightmare-like existence in the divine race presently!

Eight Void Mountain’s battle, more than half of the divine race and abyss devil race were killed and injured, suffering a great loss in vitality.

Ten billion years of accumulation was virtually destroyed overnight!

This kind of disastrous lesson already turned into a nightmare, imprinting deeply into each divine race member’s heart, unable to be erased.

This person was simply the devil!

Ye Yuan looked at the other party and said coolly, “I’m going to the abyss! Make way!”

That middle-stage Nine-marks powerhouse opened his mouth wide, having a look of disbelief on his face.

This devil-like figure was actually going to head for the abyss alone?

He could not resist swallowing his saliva. Waving his hand, he said, “M-Make way! Let him pass!”
