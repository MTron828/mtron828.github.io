Chapter 1404 Mindse

Qiu Shuisheng opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but he discovered that he really could not say anything.

Jin Yu was still defeated by Ye Yuan under the situation where he had the initiative.

He could not even resolve Jin Yu’s Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels, let alone talk about dealing with Ye Yuan.

Qiu Shuisheng was a proud son of heaven. Apart from Jin Yu, he did not attach importance to anyone in the land of hundred cities.

But now, he really did not have the courage to fight with Ye Yuan anymore.

Meeting on a narrow path, the brave wins!

Under that kind of situation just now, anyone would probably consider how to protect themselves at the first moment.

At least, there would be that tiny hint of hesitation.

But Ye Yuan did not hesitate at all, chopping over with a sword just like that!

At this time, Qiu Shuisheng unwittingly recalled Qin Shao’s words previously.

He was a person born to create miracles!

He was previously still very disdainful towards Qin Shao’s words. But now, he discovered that Qin Shao did not exaggerate in the slightest.

“Take the chance while he’s ill and take his life! Kill this guy, the storage rings on him will all be ours!”

In the crowd, no idea who suddenly shouted out, startling everyone awake all at once.

Two consecutive great battles, a thousand people already gathered around in the vicinity!

With this roar, immediately, there were quite a few people who had the intention of fishing in troubled waters.

For some time, a large group of people surrounded over toward Ye Yuan.

Not just him, there were even quite a few people who rushed over toward Jin Yu.

“A bunch of shameless things! You guys are also fit to make a move against Jin Yu?”

Qiu Shuisheng gave a cold snort, his figure dashing out like lightning.

Qin Shao’s face fell as well, speeding over in Ye Yuan’s direction.

Facing the tidewater-like students rushing over, Ye Yuan just laughed coldly. His wrist shook, Evil Extermination Sword attacked once more!

Although his current state was not very good, that was also just relative to Jin Yu, this kind of expert.

The fleshy body technique that Ye Yuan cultivated was the Black Tortoise Clan’s Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art.

Even though this cultivation method did not count as some peerless divine skill in the Heavenspan World, the power of its defensive strength was absolutely not what average cultivation methods could compare to.

The Black Tortoise Clan’s talent was that their defensive strength was astonishing. The cultivation method that they cultivated was naturally not too poor as well.

Although that blow just now was heavy, it was not to the extent of making Ye Yuan lose his combat power yet.

Dealing with these trash, he still had the strength to spare.

Swish!

Ye Yuan waved his hand and chopped. The powerful force made the faces of those few meeting it head-on greatly astonished.

They completely did not expect it. Ye Yuan was already injured until like this, he could actually still release such a swift and fierce attack.

Caught off-guard, that person right at the front did not even get to crush the jade pendant and was eradicated by Ye Yuan.

The few people at the back had no time to run at all and only had time to crush the jade pendant, transporting back to the altar.

“No need to be afraid, he’s already an arrow at the end of its flight, deliberately using this sword to scare people! Kill him!” In the crowd, no idea who shouted loudly again.

The flood of people who originally paused slightly because of this sword pounced toward Ye Yuan once again.

The corner of Ye Yuan’s mouth sneered coldly, not taking this seriously at all.

One comes, he would kill one.

Two come, he would kill a pair!

These people were all harboring hopes of getting lucky, thinking that Ye Yuan was already at the end of his rope. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

How could they know the terror of Ye Yuan’s cultivation method? This bit of consumption was nothing to him at all.

Even if his divine essence already did not have much left, the time it lasts would still exceed all of their expectations.

Ye Yuan waved his sword continuously, reaping these outer-court disciples’ lives without restraint.

But in the crowd, a viper-like gaze was watching Ye Yuan close.

His realm strength was no different from the others. It appeared very ordinary in the crowd. Nobody would pay attention to him at all.

But at this time, he came to Ye Yuan’s back along with the crowd!

Following that, he brazenly attacked!

Qin Shao’s heart suddenly stirred, seeing a familiar figure, his gaze revealing a look of astonishment.

“Ye Yuan, be careful at the back!” Qin Shao shouted.

But right at this time, a powerful aura arrived with a howl!

“Qin Yuanlong, you dare?!”

This figure was none other than precisely the Thundercry who came from afar!

When he heard the news of Ye Yuan challenging all heroes, he knew that Qin Yuanlong definitely came here.

But he never thought that he would see the scene of Qin Yuanlong sneaking into the crowd and ambushing Ye Yuan when he just arrived!

Without a doubt, Ye Yuan was Wu Meng Academy’s student with the greatest potential. It even surpassed Qin Tian’s already.

Before departing, Wen Yiyang specially ordered to definitely keep a lookout for Qin Yuanlong and not let him deal with Ye Yuan.

He did not expect that this guy still escaped!

An Origin Deity powerhouse ambushing the Grotto Profound Realm Ye Yuan, this already did not have any suspense.

Qin Yuanlong mingled in the crowd and was too close to Ye Yuan. He did not give Ye Yuan a chance to crush the jade pendant at all!

A hint of a hideous smile flashed across the corners of Qin Yuanlong’s mouth. Finally could kill Ye Yuan!

This punk who made the Qin Family utterly lose face could finally go and die.

It was just too bad that Ye Yuan had his back to him at this time. He could not see the mocking smile on Ye Yuan’s face.

Boom!

Qin Yuanlong only felt a blur before his eyes. Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly disappeared.

His palm directly hit thin air, landed on those students opposite of Ye Yuan.

How powerful was the palm of an Origin Deity powerhouse? Those students directly had a large swarm exterminated by Qin Yuanlong being caught unawares.

Everyone was stunned. Where did Ye Yuan go?

Qin Yuanlong’s scalp exploded. He discovered that he seemed to have overlooked an extremely important thing!

Not just him, everyone overlooked it.

Ye Yuan knew sword maneuvering flight!

“Teacher Qin, are you very disappointed? You all are also too careless, to actually forget that I know sword maneuvering flight!” In midair, Ye Yuan looked at Qin Yuanlong and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Qin Yuanlong’s face was livid, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of killing intent.

Such an important intel was actually overlooked by them!

No, it was actually that Ye Yuan deliberately guided them to overlook it.

Ever since after the battle with Qin Shao, Ye Yuan never displayed the ability of sword maneuvering flight in front of people anymore.

In a flash, six to seven years went by, Ye Yuan had always been fighting with people on the ground and had never exhibited this ability.

Due to this, everyone all overlooked this fact!

After all, being unable to fly while being below the Divine Lord Realm was the Heavenspan World’s common sense.

This kind of mindset was deeply ingrained in people’s thinking; very hard to eradicate.

Seven years ago, Ye Yuan’s astonishing flight had indeed stunned everyone. But later, Ye Yuan’s Sundering Stars was even more eye-catching that sword maneuvering flight.

“Sword maneuvering flight! Ye Yuan actually knows sword maneuvering flight! My god, just how monstrous is this guy?”

“This fellow concealed too deeply! With this move, he’s already established in an undefeatable position!”

“I didn’t expect it! Really didn’t expect it! The land of hundred cities’ number one genius actually changed owners just like this!”

...

Ye Yuan’s breathtaking fly aroused everyone’s shock once more.

Forget about the land of hundred cities, even the land of thousand cities, land of ten thousand cities, might not produce a genius capable of comprehending sword maneuvering flight either!

But Ye Yuan did it!

“Qin Yuanlong, you disregarded your status and attempted to assassinate an academy’s disciple! This matter, I’ll definitely inform City Lord, His Excellency! You, be prepared for a reckoning!”

Thundercry’s angry roar sounded at this time.
