Chapter 2927: Bigger Bet!

The audience was in an uproar!

Many people actually already wanted to back out.

“I-It’s actually chaos Dao fires! Furthermore, it’s even 49 kinds, my god!”

“Chaos Dao fires burn myriad life. I heard that it can even burn Hegemon Realms to death! Wouldn’t we be courting death by entering it?”

“This round, there’s probably only Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian they all, these freaks, that have hope of passing, right? It’s too difficult to enter the Nirvana Soul Hall!”

… …

The examinees’ wails echoed, clearly being intimidated by ‘chaos Dao fire’ three words.

In reality, this round was indeed the most difficult of the three stages!

Of the three rounds, the Lucid Forest was the easiest instead.

Although the Soul Controlling Avenue was difficult, there would always be someone who could clear the stage every several tens of thousands of years.

But, in the third round, Soul Refining Furnace, up to this date there were only a scanty few people who could clear the stage!

These handful of people were all presently the soul race’s titan-class existences now!

Even if compared to Hegemon Cloudmount, they were not at all inferior to him in the least bit.

When Westdawn saw that many people could not make up their minds, he smiled slightly and said, “There is no harm telling you all. Each time the test starts, this round’s death rate is the highest, with close to 70%! This is also to say that, at most, only 30 people out of you guys can survive!”

With this, many people shrink back.

A death rate of 70% was indeed too horrifying.

One had to know that those able to make it to the third round were all soul path geniuses.

There was actually such a terrifying death rate.

“I … .I’ll withdraw!”

“I’m withdrawing too!”

“Forget it, I give up!”

… …

Westdawn’s words made some of those who were ranked at the back make up their minds in the end.

To these people, them entering the Soul Refining Furnace were equivalent to being cannon fodders, being virtually unable to set off any waves.

Very soon, more than ten people backed out.

Right at this time, Qin Shitian suddenly looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Ye Yuan, why don’t we bet bigger? Let’s compete in this Soul Refining Furnace. How about it?”

Ye Yuan was not surprised, he smiled and said,?“Oh??I wonder how you want to compete?”

Qin Shitian said, “In the Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall, the Soul Refining Furnace’s highest record is four by seven, 28 kinds of Dao fires! Let’s simply bet a little higher and request for Master to take action, sealing the two of our Soul Refining Furnaces shut! Without reaching five by seven, 35 kinds of Dao fires, we’re not allowed to come out!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces suddenly changed.

This was betting too big!

Putting aside that it was five by seven, 35 kinds of Dao fires, just two by seven, 28 kinds of Dao fires was already extremely terrifying too!

One had to know that the Dao fires in the Soul Refining Furnace were added one by one.

With 28 kinds of chaos Dao fires, what kind of horrifying refinement ability was that! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But to consider 35 kinds of Dao fires, this was simply an impossible task.

Even Great Emperor Eastsun’s pupils constricted slightly too.

But very soon, the corners of his mouth revealed a hint of a smile.

This was Qin Shitian!

Forcing himself into a desperate situation so that he could risk it all!

This boy had resolve, had willpower, and had strength. He was an exceptionally talented person from beginning to end.

Furthermore, this was psychological warfare too.

Once Ye Yuan cowered, it would be hard to win Qin Shitian in this round.

But, if he accepted it, it would virtually be a certain death scenario.

In this round, there was indeed an advantage for strong soul bodies.

But, once it reached the late stages, dozens of Dao fires superimposed, whatever soul body would be useless too.

Even if it was ten wroughts, it was also merely True Sovereign Heaven’s ten wroughts. That was all.

In contrast, this round’s test was more comprehensive.

Strength, talent, perseverance, courage; all these various aspects were all in this round.

Many people looked at Ye Yuan sympathetically. Right now, he was being caught in the horns of a dilemma!

Ye Yuan fell silent.

Qin Shitian looked at Ye Yuan and said smugly, “What? Don’t dare anymore? Does the powerhouse in the Soul Controlling Avenue juncture not even have this bit of courage? “”How disappointing!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I was thinking that 35 kinds are too few. How about this? I actually don’t have much confidence in 49 kinds of chaos Dao fires too. Let’s just set it on six by seven, 42 kinds. I feel that this number is just right. There’s some challenge and it aklso won’t be too easy.”

“Hiss …”

The sound of cold air being sucked in came from all around.

Impressive!

Well-deserving of being the Soul Controlling Avenue stage clearing big shot, he was brimming with confidence!

With this, Ye Yuan directly counter-checkmated and performed a posture while he was at it.

These 42 kinds, just whether you dare or not!

If you don’t dare, don’t compete!

Qin Shitian’s face was almost becoming as long as a horse’s face.

Brat, you’re ruthless enough!

Everyone gazes turned toward Qin Shitian simultaneously with a?whoosh.

The latter was hesitating!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What, don’t dare anymore? The genius who created a miracle in the Soul Controlling Avenue, just a step away from the seventh segment, doesn’t even have this bit of courage? How disappointing!”

“Pffft!”

When many people heard this, they immediately spurted out.

Sarcastic!

Blatant sarcasm!

A stage clearing powerhouse who created a myth deriding a rookie who was only seventh segment.

Nothing was more ironic than this.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan even retorted Qin Shitian with his original words.

The power was more than ten times that of the original words!

Qin Shitian’s face could not be preserved anymore. He was not a fool and knew that Ye Yuan was goading him.

But, at this time, could he shrink back?

Qin Shitian naturally did not know which step he could walk until.

But he wanted to challenge himself.

And put Ye Yuan down while he was at it.

But who knew that Ye Yuan was even more ruthless than him, directly mentioning 42 kinds of Dao fires!

One had to know, reaching that kind of degree, each additional Dao fire was like having a mountain pressing on the body.

The level of danger rose exponentially.

Could he withstand it?

“Okay, I accept!” Qin Shitian was silent for a long time, using a low voice to roar these words out.

Great Emperor Eastsun’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “Shitian!”

Qin Shitian raised his head to look at Great Emperor Eastsun and said solemnly, “Master, I’ve experienced too many life and death in the Scarlet Drill Battlefield. How can I not see through that he’s goading me? However, so what? Which powerhouse didn’t wander out of the brink of death? How can the likes of them become Hegemons?”

As he spoke, he pointed at the examinees who backed out.

Those people were incomparably ashamed and angry, wishing to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

When Great Emperor Eastsun heard, he was very moved too and said with a nod, “This seat understands. Go on! This seat will take action to lock in six by seven, 42 kinds of chaos Dao fires!”

Qin Shitian cupped his fists and said, “Many thanks, Master, for granting my wish!”

He looked toward Ye Yuan again and said with a cold smile, “How is it? You didn’t expect that I’d agree, right? Do you feel like you lifted a rock to smash your own feet?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter; as long as you’re happy.”

Qin Shitian nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood. This guy was too hateful!

He smiled coldly and said, “I heard Master say before, each of the chaos Dao fires in the Soul Refining Furnace has power at the limit of True Sovereign Heaven. After 21 chaos Dao fires are superimposed, even if it’s a ten wroughts powerhouse, a moment of carelessness and they will fall too! Don’t think that you can sleep in peace with nine wroughts!”

Ye Yuan still had a calm appearance as he said with a smile, “Is that so? You’re just six wroughts. You have to be careful.”
