Chapter 1940: Etiquette of a Senior

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Buzz, buzz!”

The aura of Alchemy Dao followed by lightning slammed right into the hall.

Empyrean Flutterfeather and Ye Yuan’s faces changed at the same time, the seals in their hands changing swiftly and indeterminately like the clouds.

The horrifying lightning was actually guided into the medicinal cauldrons by Empyrean Flutterfeather and Ye Yuan.

Immediately, countless lightning flashed incessantly on the Xuanlong Cauldron and Wandering Dragon Cauldron, looking hair-raising.

“They ... They are actually snatching pill tribulation!” Chen Chang exclaimed in shock.

As alchemists, they were clear how terrifying this level of pill tribulation was.

In reality, when each alchemist encountered pill tribulation, they would respond carefully, fearful of making the slightest mistake.

But these two people actually used pill tribulation to temper the medicinal pills!

If it was tempering medicinal pills, fine, the two of them were actually afraid that the pill tribulation was insufficient and desperately vying for the pill tribulation!

These two were absolutely lunatics!

The group of Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders looked at this scene in incredible shock and already did not know what they should say.

It was only to see bolts of lightning entering the medicinal cauldrons. The energy undulations inside the medicinal cauldrons became stronger and stronger, actually showing sights of losing control.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Ye Yuan’s Wandering Dragon Cauldron actually started cracking apart.

Chen Chang’s expression changed and he said, “It’s over! This pill tribulation’s energy is too terrifying, Ye Yuan’s medicinal cauldron already almost can’t take it anymore. A single slip up and the furnace will blow up!”

When Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people saw this scene, they could not help revealing a look of wild ecstasy.

“Haha, this brat lost for sure! Can’t even control medicinal cauldron, refine what medicinal pills?’ Qing Yun laughed loudly as he said.

But those Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders were silent. They knew that even if Ye Yuan’s furnace exploded, it was also not due to lack of skill.

Even though Empyrean Flutterfeather only used a celestial deity mystic treasure, this celestial deity mystic treasure was nourished by him for several million years. Its bearing capacity was absolutely not what Ye Yuan’s Wandering Dragon Cauldron could compare to.

The aura set off by these two people refining pills practically reached the limits of rank five divine pills already. So the pill tribulation brought down was also not what ordinary medicinal cauldrons could withstand.

Although the Wandering Dragon Cauldron was decent, it was clearly a little worse in handling such horrifying energy.

However, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of giving up. He still controlled the medicinal cauldron with his full attention, refining the medicinal pill.

The two enormous dragons were still in a struggle, pill tribulation continuously poured into the medicinal cauldron.

The Wandering Dragon Cauldron’s cracking became more and more serious, the cracks on it also became more and more.

Qing Yun was long already waiting for the furnace to blow up. But a very long time had passed and the Wandering Dragon Cauldron still did not show signs of blowing up.

“This ... What on earth is going on here? His medicinal cauldron has clearly reached the limits it can bear long ago, but why hasn’t it blow up?” Qing Yun said gloomily.

The Wandering Dragon Cauldron’s cauldron body was already fragmented into little pieces. One could practically say that it had fallen apart. Logically speaking, the furnace should have long blown up, yet, it just refused to explode!

Chen Chang said, “His medicinal cauldron had indeed reached its limits long ago, but Ye Yuan relied on the power of Great Dao and forcefully maintained the medicinal cauldron! His control over the medicinal cauldron has simply reached an inconceivable level!”

Zi Yu and Qing Yun exchanged a glance, being shocked speechless.

It was still their first time seeing that one’s control over the medicinal cauldron could reach such a horrifying degree.

Was this really what people could accomplish?

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

High up in the sky, a purple and a white, two enormous dragons, unfolded a fierce confrontation, the imposing momentum getting stronger and stronger.

Bang!

Suddenly, after the two enormous dragons had a fierce collision, they fell apart to pieces!

The two illusory massive dragons turned into motes of light.

And right at this time, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s and Ye Yuan’s minds became more agile as luck hit, suddenly opening both eyes.

The two originally diametrically opposed auras actually started blending together in perfect harmony!

Ye Yuan’s aura gradually converged into Empyrean Flutterfeather’s aura, while Empyrean Flutterfeather’s aura also slowly converged into Ye Yuan’s aura.

It seemed like the two medicinal pills were going to fuse together!

When the group of elders saw this scene, they could not help exchanging glances as they had never seen before such a scene.

“Aren’t they battling in alchemy? Why is it that when they fight until the end, the banners are lowered and the drums are silenced, shaking hands and burying the hatchet?” Chen Yu said with a baffled look.

“What kind of situation is this?” Chen Chang was similarly doubtful as he asked.

The two auras were like two converging rivers, finally converging into the sea.

Very soon, those two auras combined into one!

An air billow spread out with the two people as the center, immediately sending the group of elders flying out.

The two people’s medicinal cauldrons practically gave off a dazzling light at the same time.

“Condense!”

“Condense!”

Right at this time, Empyrean Flutterfeather and Ye Yuan gave a sharp cry at the same time.

That violent aura, countless energy, was recalled in an instant, entering the two medicinal cauldrons.

The pill condensation succeeded!

“Haha! Feels great!” Empyrean Flutterfeather’s hearty laughter reverberated in the great hall. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Indeed, it had already been God knows how many years since Empyrean Flutterfeather had such a satisfactory fight.

As an outstanding talent among Seven-star Alchemy Gods, not many people could become Empyrean Flutterfeather’s match at all.

Ye Yuan was seeking an opponent that could match his strength with; so wasn’t he the same too?

This battle was to his heart’s content.

Crack, crack, crack ...

With the pill condensation succeeding, the Wandering Dragon Cauldron finally could not bear it, falling apart to pieces, turning into a pile of fine powder.

It could be seen from this how horrifying the pill tribulation caused by the two people previously was, to actually turn a celestial deity mystic treasure to dust.

Ye Yuan moved like lightning, keeping the medicinal pill into a small bottle that was prepared long ago.

Done with all this, Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said to Empyrean Flutterfeather, “Congratulations, Senior Flutterfeather!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather was clearly in a great mood currently as he said smilingly, “Thanks for your congratulations! Without you, this old man couldn’t have taken this step either!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Flutterfeather’s realm is already there. You were just lacking an opportunity. Now, success comes when the conditions are ripe. Felicitations!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather reached his hand out and beckoned, putting away the medicinal pill. Then, he pushed lightly, pushing the Xuanlong Cauldron in front of Ye Yuan.

“This Xuanlong Cauldron has followed this old man for several million years. Meeting you today, you definitely won’t ruin its reputation! I’ll give it to you,” Empyrean Flutterfeather said smilingly.

Ye Yuan was not courteous either, directly keeping the Xuanlong Cauldron and said with clasped hands, “Thank you, Senior Flutterfeather.”

With a bout of alchemy battle, Ye Yuan naturally knew about Xuanlong Cauldron’s prowess.

Under that horrifying pill tribulation, the Xuanlong Cauldron was actually unscathed; this could be seen at a glance.

Far away, when everyone heard the two people’s conversation, each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths.

What Ye Yuan was congratulating, they were naturally well aware.

Especially Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people, their faces revealed a look of wild elation, practically about to jump up in happiness.

“Master, you ... you comprehended it?” Zi Yu said rather incoherently.

Empyrean Flutterfeather stroked his beard and said with a smile, “Yes! Starting from today, master will begin closed-seclusion. So you all don’t disturb me. As of today, Ye Yuan will be the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder. All of you have to show the etiquette toward a senior, understood?”

Everyone was stricken with fear, all bowing their heads in salute as they said, “We obey Lord Flutterfeather’s dharmic decree!”

Finished talking, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s figure moved, immediately disappearing from the great hall.

The group of Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders exchanged glances, akin to being lost in the clouds and mist.

This battle, just who won?
