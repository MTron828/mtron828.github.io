Chapter 1986: Returning in Defeat

“Mn? You people over there, still not coming over? Could it be that you have objections?”

Zhou Yu saw that Ye Yuan did not move and his brows could not help furrowing.

He did not expect that now that he already established awe, there were actually still people who did not know what was good for them.

With Ye Yuan not moving, Feng Xiaotian did not dare to move either.

Zhou Yu was formidable, but Ye Yuan was also formidable!

He did not know who between Zhou Yu and Ye Yuan was more powerful, but without a doubt, it was as easy as flipping his hand for Ye Yuan to want to kill him.

“B-Brother Ye, you look ... Shouldn’t we go over too?” Feng Xiaotian asked carefully.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Want to go, you go. I’ll wait a while more.”

Feng Xiaotian’s expression turned stiff, gloominess on his face.

I go?

Would I dare to go?

Already offended you, grandfather, badly before, if I were to really go over and you give me a slash from behind, wouldn’t I still have to meet King Yama?

But, not going ... wouldn’t I offend Zhou Yu, this great murderous god?

Feng Xiaotian had a difficult look on his face, standing there awkwardly.

When Zhou Yu saw that Ye Yuan ignored him, he was immediately greatly enraged.

But, when he saw that Feng Xiaotian was actually so cautious toward a Second Firmament True God, he was rather surprised in his heart.

Looking at the expression of Song Yu and the others, this squad actually seemed to have Ye Yuan as the center.

“Kid, I’m talking to you.iDdn’t you hear me?” Zhou Yu looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice.

“This bone devil army isn’t easy to clear. We should wait for a while more. An additional person is an additional portion of strength,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

He had personally rushed before the bone devil army, and he naturally knew how troublesome this bone devil army was.

People should not look at how he killed his way in and out alone, because not everyone had such thick divine essence like him.

Facing so many Fourth Firmament True God bone devils, once divine essence was exhausted, it would be the outcome of waiting for death.

Furthermore, these bone devils’ strengths also varied.

Weak ones, Ye Yuan could kill them with one move.

Strong ones, even he felt very troublesome to handle them.

Although Sword Hollow Etch was powerful, he could only unleash one sword move.

Not reaching the last resort, he naturally would not use this move.

Except, Zhou Yu did not know these.

With Ye Yuan not speaking, Feng Xiaotian naturally did not dare to say things out.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Zhou Yu’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Looks like there’s still someone who doesn’t know what’s good for them! Forget it! Since the deterrent force earlier isn’t enough, then let’s have another!”

This Zhou Yu was clearly someone who was decisive in going for the kill, attacking straight away, directly turning into an afterimage, and rushing over.

“Life and Death Seal!”

Ye Yuan was long prepared; the Life and Death Seal suddenly rumbled out, meeting Zhou Yu’s astonishing rod.

Bang!

The two people each retreated several dozen steps before barely managing to stabilize their figures.

Zhou Yu’s expression changed greatly. He did not expect that a puny little Second Firmament True God actually received his blow!

He knocked a Fourth Firmament True God dead with one blow earlier!

“How can this kid be so strong?” Zhou Yu was secretly startled.

The other people’s faces changed one after another. They thought that this blow landing, Ye Yuan would definitely be beaten into pulp too.

But who knew that Ye Yuan would be safe and sound!

Of course, they would not think that Zhou Yu only had this bit of strength. This blow, he definitely held back somewhat.

But even if it was somewhat held back, it was also not what ordinary Fourth Firmament True Gods could withstand.

Now, it was actually easily resolved by a Second Firmament True God.

They finally understood why Feng Xiaotian was cautious in all respects.

Zhou Yu’s expression was very ugly. He originally wanted to kill people to establish awe. But who knew that he ran into a tough character, to actually receive his blow effortlessly.

“Punk, you’re good! Since you want to wait here, slowly wait then. When we get the emperor bone, see what you’ll use to be arrogant!” Zhou Yu said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Go ahead.”

Zhou Yu gave a cold snort, but turned his head to look at Feng Xiaotian and asked, “You, going or not?”

Feng Xiaotian’s face changed and could not help looking at Ye Yuan, but he discovered that Ye Yuan already walked to one side.

Zhou Yu clearly saw through already that Feng Xiaotian and Ye Yuan were not together.

“I ... I’ll go!” Feng Xiaotian gritted his teeth and said.

He had never been so oppressed before in his life.

But he was scared. He was afraid that Zhou Yu would smash his brain into a pulp with a rod.

That was an empyrean spirit treasure!

This thing in Zhou Yu’s hand had much greater power than the things in Ye Yuan’s hand.

After all, Zhou Yu’s realm was more than two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan.

“Humph, at least you’re sensible!” Zhou Yu said with a cold snort.

Just like this, Zhou Yu brought 40 to 50 people and rushed right into the bone devil army.

Song Yu looked at this group of people and said with a cold smile, “A bunch of blind and reckless people. They think that by obtaining a bit of lucky chance, they are now undefeatable. Look at them. They would not even know how they die. Do they really think that the emperor bone is so easy to get?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Can’t be forced, so let them be. Just nice for us. Let’s make use of this chance for us to refine the Empyrean’s remains a little. It will more or less increase our strength.”

There were too many people previously, they also could not take the Empyrean’s remains out to refine.

Now that everyone was gone, they did not have any misgivings.

Just like this, the five people started refining the Empyrean’s remains. The few people’s strengths were also growing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Daoless refined all of his strength into the remains. Although countless years had passed, and the energy inside the remains also dissipated significantly, to them, several martial artists who just entered True God Realm, it was still a great tonic item. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Two days later, Ye Yuan’s realm reached the late-stage Second Firmament Origin Pill Realm, causing his strength to increase significantly once more.

As for the others, their refining speed was a little slower, but they also advanced by leaps and bounds.

Rather, it was Guo Jingyang who actually broke through to the Fourth Firmament True God Realm in one go.

Their squad added another middle-stage True God Realm.

And right at this time, a commotion came over. Zhou Yu rushed out of the bone devil army in the forefront.

The rest followed closely behind, all also charging out.

But these people’s bodies more or less carried wounds. Clearly, they had suffered considerable injuries.

This side was very spacious. Zhou Yu saw Ye Yuan the moment he came out, and his gaze could not help turning intent.

Just two days’ time, why did this punk’s strength increase so much?

Although he did not break through to the Third Firmament True God Realm yet, this cultivation speed was a little too fast, right?

There were definitely treasures on these few fellows’ bodies!

Zhou Yu’s expression was very ugly. Sure enough, Ye Yuan’s words were right. They charged a distance of several tens of thousands of feet in one go. But the further in front they went, the Fourth Firmament True God bone devils became more and more. They could not charge further at all.

Continuing further, they could only be annihilated one by one.

There was no choice. They could only turn around and slaughter their way back.

This to and fro spent two day’s time. Putting aside suffering injuries, they returned to their original spot again; incredibly depressing.

When Song Yu saw Zhou Yu they all, he could not resist bursting into laughter and said, “Hahaha, you fools! Ye Yuan already said to not be anxious; an additional person is an additional portion of strength, but you guys wouldn’t listen. With this, now you know the prowess of this bone devil army already, right?”

Zhou Yu’s face turned as black as the bottom of a pot but was unable to refute.

Their line-up was strong, but encountering this bone devil army, they could only return in defeat.
