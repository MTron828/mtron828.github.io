Chapter 2516: Transforming Dao!

“This … This is simply toying with!”

“That Jun Tian is really too strong! Dao Ancestors are really ant-like existences in front of him.”

“He’s intent on toying with the Dao Ancestors, otherwise, he could probably eradicate the Dao Ancestors with a flick of a finger!”

… …

In front of Jun Tian, the supreme Dao Ancestors also paled in comparison.

Their earth-shaking big moves seemed to only serve as a foil to Jun Tian’s might.

He wandered around in it. Suddenly he waved his sleeves casually, and several people were then seriously injured.

It was just that no one shrunk back.

After they fell, they stood up again.

Fall down, stand up again.

Coming here, they were already prepared to die.

Boundless Moonlight, Limitless Samsara!

Yue Mengli cried out, the terrifying ocular art aiming right at Jun Tian.

Jun Tian just smiled slightly and said,?“Huhu,?pretty good ocular art. Unfortunately … your Dao teachings were passed down by me. Isn’t it a little laughable to use it to deal with me?”

Jun Tian gave Yue Mengli a glance. Yue Mengli’s mind shook and tasted sweetness at the back of her throat. Her divine soul immediately suffered heavy damage, and she spurted out a mouthful of blood wildly.

Just one glance broke the Heavenspan World’s strongest ocular art.

“Be careful!”

Suddenly, a cry entered Yue Mengli’s ears.

Before she understood what was going on, she was knocked flying by a wall of meat, tumbling out heavily.

“L-Lord Tian Qing!” Yue Mengli discovered that the person pressed on top of her was precisely Tian Qing.

Just now, at the critical moment, Tian Qing blocked in front of her.

The current Tian Qing did not have an intact spot from top to bottom. He was only hanging in there with one last breath.

He forcibly took Jun Tian’s finger and already had his life force severed.

Tian Qing’s mouth dribbled blood as he smiled miserably and said, “Little Li, t-this blow, just take it as … repaying my debt! I-I’m sorry!”

His life force was dissipating rapidly, there was no hope already.

Yue Mengli’s eyes were filled with tears as she cried bitterly, shaking her head as she said, “No, you didn’t let me down! Y-You were a good elder!”

Tian Qing’s breath was weak as he said, “The … sins that I’ve committed are too serious. Ten thousand deaths can’t absolve me from the blame!?Huhu,?it’s a pity that … I can only die once! I … I hate it!”

Tian Qing used his last breath and howled at the sky.

Then, he closed his eyes and passed away all of a sudden.

His life force had already been completely cut off, there was no possibility of surviving anymore.

“Lord Tian Qing!” Yue Mengli cried bitterly, beyond description.

She naturally had hate toward Tian Qing.

It was just that, she distinguished it clearly.

In the divine race, Tian Qing could be said to have spared no effort in nurturing her.

This kindness, Yue Mengli must accept it.

Yue Mengli was a reasonable person. She knew that the fault did not lie with Tian Qing.

Even Ye Yuan forgave Tian Qing. So what reason did she have to not forgive?

Now, Tian Qing died on the spot in order to save her, how could she not feel heartache?

“Jun Tian, I’ll fight it out with you!” Yue Mengli’s wrath billowed to the sky, rushing forward without heed for her personal safety.

But on the other side, Jun Tian casually smacked, and directly smacked Pang Zhen onto the ground, smashing a large pit in the ground.

Pang Zhen struggled several times but failed to struggle to his feet.

Yue Mengli’s Heavenly Dao True Martial activated and she rushed toward Jun Tian without caring for her life.

The corners of Jun Tian’s mouth curled slightly, and he said,?“Huhu,?ignorant ants! This kind of fury doesn’t have the slightest function.?Uh?… although you’re an ant too. Your looks are not bad. In the future, follow me! After I kill them, I’ll bring you out of this forsaken place.”

Finished talking, he casually pointed and Yue Mengli directly fainted away.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Jun Tian knocked everyone to the ground with one hand each.

“Alright, just about got tired of playing. It’s time to send you all on your way. This forsaken place, even the air is filthy. It really makes me uncomfortable all over!” Jun Tian had a look of disgust and walked toward Yue Mengli, about to bring her away.

But right at this time, Jun Tian’s expression changed, and he looked in Ye Yuan’s direction with astonishment.

No idea since when, Ye Yuan actually already stood up.

His gaze was staring fixedly at Jun Tian, the aura on his body was in the midst of rising crazily.

Boom!

Suddenly, the spiritual energy on Heavenspan Mountain completely erupted.

The heaven and earth spiritual energy all around, was seemingly like surging floodwaters, rolling in.

An illusory figure appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

Gray pupils! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

White robes!

That was precisely the gray-pupiled Ye Yuan!

Only to see Ye Yuan say coolly, “From now on, you’ll be Heavenly Dao! Transforming! Dao!”

Ye Yuan pointed at the void, the gray-pupiled Ye Yuan dissipated with a loud bang.

Transforming into countless filaments, it burrowed into Ye Yuan’s body.

Ye Yuan’s small world underwent earth-shaking changes with a rumble!

The originally lifeless world became lively all of a sudden.

Grass was taking root, seedlings broke out of the soil, and started to grow green leaves.

Overflowing with vitality!

The sun, moon, and stars cycled without rest.

Mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas flowed in continuous streams!

Everything seemed to be operating according to some kind of law.

The current Ye Yuan stood proudly in the sky, with a feeling of overlooking all life.

He felt that he had become heaven!

Endless spiritual energy poured into the small world crazily, helping him to develop all life.

Jun Tian opened his eyes wide, the calm and collected expression on his face had changed for the first time.

He sucked in a deep breath and said in shock, “This … How is this possible? How can an ant possibly understand the art of transforming Dao? In this forsaken place, there’s actually someone … who can break through to Heavenly Stratum?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze never left Jun Tian from start to end.

“Heavenly Dao is heartless!?Heh,?what a fine Heavenly Dao is heartless! Jun Tian, I really have to thank you so much! Without your reminder, it probably wouldn’t have been so easy if I wanted to break through!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

Jun Tian was stunned when he heard that, only then recalling what he said earlier.

Heavenly Dao is heartless!

He was shocked. This guy found the turning point to break through to Heavenly Stratum through this sentence?

A casual remark sounded significant to an attentive listener.

Jun Tian did not expect that his thoughtless sentence actually created a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse!

This guy’s talent was too monstrous!

In reality, Ye Yuan had been stuck at this step for a long time already.

He always felt that his small world was missing something.

He had once thought of Heavenly Dao but did not know how to create Heavenly Dao.

Heavenly Dao was a vague and insubstantial thing.

No one knew what it was.

But there was a heartless existence in Ye Yuan’s body!

That guy did not have the slightest emotion.

From when Ye Yuan’s chaos first started, it already appeared after Origin Pill Realm.

Only a short while ago, Ye Yuan was still wondering whether the cultivation method he comprehended was correct or not.

It was just that later on, his strength became stronger and stronger. His confidence in himself also grew stronger and stronger, resulting in overlooking this problem.

In the end, Ye Yuan’s strength was already sufficient to suppress the gray-pupil Ye Yuan, and he did not need to worry anymore.

Not worrying, he naturally overlooked it.

But the word ‘heartless’ filled Ye Yuan with enlightenment, suddenly seeing the whole thing in a clear light!

It turned out that the gray-pupil Ye Yuan was not born without cause.

He was Heavenly Dao!

The most important step of breaking through to Heavenly Stratum also lay with precisely him!
