Chapter 2429: Where Righteousness Lies

In front of the camp, Pang Zhen came beside Yue Feng and said neither obsequiously nor haughtily, “You don’t need to kneel anymore. His Excellency said that if you really want to repent, follow Lord Ni Xuan. Go into battles to kill the enemy and defend the human race.”

The current Pang Zhen was proud but not arrogant.

In the past, he relied on Ancestor Lightning’s prestige, and he considered everything and everyone beneath his notice.

Now, he was relying on his own merits to turn his nose up at the world.

As Ye Yuan’s right-hand man, he could regard any powerhouse in this world as an equal.

He had a powerful background and also proud feats.

When Yue Feng saw Pang Zhen, his pupils could not help shrinking slightly and he said, “You ... You’re Ancestor Lightning’s descendant?”

Pang Zhen nodded and said, “That’s right, my ancestor is precisely the Ancestor of Lightning!”

Yue Feng sucked in a cold breath. How revered was the status of Ancestor Lightning’s status? Yet, Pang Zheng was actually willing to be a pawn under Ye Yuan!

His awe toward Saint Azure was entirely due to his ancestral teachings.

Although he witnessed Ye Yuan’s means, he still did not dare to believe that a dignified Dao Ancestor would actually do this sort of thing that lowered his own status.

Dao Ancestor was different from Lin Wushuang!

Lin Wushuang was merely a dead rule powerhouse, while Dao Ancestors were living sovereigns!

“I know what you’re thinking. His Excellency as Saint Azure of eternity created the human race’s ten billion years of prosperity single handedly! Even Ancestor also have to call Lord Saint Azure respectfully in front of him! If you want to atone for your crime by meritorious actions, let go of your pride of Fifth Blight, and go to the front lines to kill the enemy! In the future, there will naturally be your meritorious deeds. If you remain impenitent, heh heh, even the Jade Emperor can’t save you too!” Finished saying, Pang Zhen left with his hands behind his back.

Yue Feng’s expression was very ugly. But he was very clear about Saint Azure’s influence at present.

Perhaps his individual combat power was not strong, but all of the Fifth Blight powerhouses in this camp obeyed Saint Azure’s command.

The battle previously really shocked him.

Producing clouds with one turn of the hand and rain with another, it was talking about Ye Yuan, right!

Overcoming the raging tides with his power alone, devastating the divine race.

This outstanding feat was sufficient to be circulated through the ages!

This Doomsday Battle was not over yet, if the human race was defeated in the end, everything naturally did not need to be discussed anymore.

But if the human race won in the end, then Ye Yuan’s stats would be passed down forever!

At that time, not just the human race, the myriad races had to submit themselves at his feet too!

Ye Yuan would be a living eternal saint!

His Deva Fifth Blight was indeed very impressive, but in front of Ye Yuan, he did not even count as anything.

In this world where the strong reigned supreme, strength was everything.

However, Ye Yuan already surpassed this level. His status could shake everything!

Just based on him having offended Ye Yuan before, he would have no way of continuing in the human race at all.

At that time, however vast the world was, there would be no place to accommodate him!

This consequence was too terrifying!

He never thought that his momentary curiosity actually caused such a big trouble.

Therefore, he let go of the pride of a Fifth Blight and knelt in front of Ye Yuan’s camp.

But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of seeing him at all.

Looking at Pang Zhen’s back view, Yue Feng could not help being absent-minded.

He and Pang Zhen had similarities.

But he and Pang Zhen walked toward two extremes.

One was respected by thousands.

One was reviled by thousands!

“Could it be that ... I was really wrong?” Yue Feng muttered.

No idea how long passed either, Yue Feng slowly got up and walked in the direction of the central army camp.

... ...

“Lord Saint Azure, Yue Feng already knelt for three days and three nights outside the camp, really don’t need to care about him?” Ni Xuan said.

He was a Deva Fifth Blight sovereign after all. It was impossible for them to ignore it.

Ye Yuan said, “Time can smoothen out everything. Many people avoid and do not fight. I don’t blame them. But his ancestor experienced that era, and yet he ignored the life and death of his own people. I can’t forgive it! I know that there are similarly many people among you all who are puzzled. But if you all experienced Saint Profound’s death, you wouldn’t have this kind of thoughts. The Jian Family’s 100 people sacrificed their lives heroically for a cause. How moving and tragic was it? All of them chose death at the peak of their lives!”

“Azure and Profound Dual Saints? In my opinion, it should be Profound and Azure Dual Saints! Saint Profound’s merits are above mine! This Saint traveled through spacetime and only left behind legacies. But Saint Profound, what he left behind is a cluster of inextinguishable kindling of the spirit! Where righteousness lies, his will is still alive even if tens of thousands die! A sovereign of his generation, sacrificing his life for justice, forging an eternal great cause! This is a true powerhouse!”

“How do you all think the 18 grand ancestors reached the peak of rules? By relying on the legacies that I left behind? No! Because Saint Profound imprinted two words in each of their hearts: righteous cause! It’s these two words that encouraged them to continuously become stronger, and reach an unprecedented peak of the human race! It’s also these two words that led them to fight the divine race fiercely, not resting till they are dead! And after them, there were no more rule powerhouses. The reason similarly lies here!”

Talking until the back, a trace of mist actually spun around in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Many people lowered their heads in shame. Who Ye Yuan was talking about was not just Yue Feng, but it was also the vast majority of the people present.

Although this battle was won, the majority of the myriad races’ powerhouses present were compelled by circumstances and had no choice but to fight.

There were few who truly fought because of a righteous cause.

Who Saint Profound saved was not just the human race!

Their predecessors had also once fought side-by-side with the human race, fighting to the death without resting.

But then, everything had changed. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Your Excellency, this subordinate is ashamed!” Ni Xuan said with a look of shame.

He could feel Ye Yuan’s current mood fluctuations.

And this was rarely seen in Ye Yuan.

Being able to make Lord Saint Azure have such fluctuations, it could be seen how much that scene touched him.

And Saint Profound’s merits, no one could erase it.

“Your Excellency, we were wrong!”

... ...

The group of powerhouses apologized one after another.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Forget it. The past is over! No matter how much this saint talks, I can’t imprint these two words in your hearts too. In this lifetime, this saint can only do what I can and leave it to fate.”

Circumstances change with the passing of time, human hearts were not what they were in the old days.

Ye Yuan was also speaking his mind earlier, he knew that these words did not sink in for everyone.

Words were feeble at times.

Without the infection of that occasion, no matter how much was said, it was useless too.

Everyone lowered their heads in shame, not daring to speak.

Ni Xuan saw that the scene was rather awkward and spoke up, “Your Excellency, after this battle, the divine race no longer has the power to fight back, what should we do next?”

Ye Yuan said, “Follow up a victory with hot pursuit, recapture lost ground, and drive the divine race back to the abyss!”

When everyone heard that, they were extremely surprised.

A leader said, “Your Excellency, this ... isn’t appropriate, right? If we anger the divine race’s progenitors, there will be no way to clean up the mess!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “I think that you all are mistaken. It’s not that the divine race’s progenitors aren’t enraged. It’s actually that they dread Dao Ancestors. That’s why they didn’t make a move! Do you all think that you can sleep in peace after winning this battle? Now, is when the Doomsday Battle truly begins! The moment of Heavenly Dao Samsara is the start of our various race’s true disaster! Have you all forgotten Daymeld’s mocking laughter? The moment the divine race’s progenitors make a move, you all can only be cannon fodders too! Therefore, don’t harbor the mentality of getting lucky!”
