Chapter 1256: Monumental Sword!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After a palm, the nine evil ghosts revolved around Ye Yuan and cast a spell. Very soon, it thoroughly dispelled his Ghostspirit Curse.

“Impossible! You ... How can you possibly comprehend Divine Dao second-stage laws?”

“Boy, you’ll pay the price for your actions!”

Regardless of whether it was Zhuge Qingxuan or Li Gu, they were both hopping mad with rage at this time.

One’s Divine Realm’s number that he took pride in was snatched, the other’s Myriad Soul Flag that he expended huge painstaking efforts was refined into a treasure by someone else.

This kind of feeling simply made people go crazy.

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “The two of you are being eccentric. Who should I answer?”

“Hey, brat, you’re not his match! Let me!” Li Gui cried out weirdly.

“No way! How can I, the Heaven Stabilizing Divine King, possibly not be his match?” Zhuge Qingxuan said, being unconvinced.

He still remembered that outside the Holy City back then, it was so arbitrary for him to kill Ye Yuan.

Just how long had passed?

He was no longer his match to this extent?

Zhuge Qingxuan’s expression flickered incessantly. Clearly, the two divine souls were currently locked in a fierce dispute for the sake of contending for the body’s control rights.

“You fool! Do you think that your talent is number one under the heaven? Even your father, I, didn’t dare say that I was number one under the heaven back then too! With just the likes of you, this fellow?” Li Gui said.

“Humph! That’s because this seat wasn’t born in the Divine Dao Era! Otherwise, this seat’s accomplishments might not be beneath Zuo Zong’s!” But Zhuge Qingxuan was brimming with confidence.

Finally, Zhuge Qingxuan’s true self still occupied the body’s initiative. His expression turned cold, his gaze full of madness.

All the essence energy in his body seethed. A terrifying aura emitted from his body.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, and he finally became serious.

“Are you mad? Your laws comprehension isn’t sufficient to unleash this level of martial technique yet! Forcefully unleashing it, the power of laws will suck you dry!”

Out of Zhuge Qingxuan’s mouth, Li Gui cried out strangely.

Sure enough, Zhuge Qingxuan’s body shriveled up rapidly!

But he still unleashed this move without turning back!

His hatred toward Ye Yuan already reached the point of disregarding everything.

This kind of hatred was even more from his jealousy!

“Lunatic! You lunatic! If you let this seat take action, why would there be a need to perish together with him? You fool!”

Li Gui gave a series of strange cries, but Zhuge Qingxuan completely ignored him.

He wanted to perish together with Ye Yuan!

“Profound ... Divinity ... Finger!”

Zhuge Qingxuan, who already shriveled up to a mummified appearance, yelled this last martial technique out of his mouth.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan could not help smiling coldly and said, “Heh, perishing together? You’re thinking too much! This kind of martial technique that’s forcefully utilized is also fit to perish together with me?”

Whoosh ...

Ye Yuan pulled out the Evil Extermination Sword. A terrifying sword intent billowed into the sky!

Zhuge Qingxuan’s aura was strong, but this sword intent of Ye Yuan’s was stronger than him, overshadowing him instantly!

Witnessing Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum, Li Gui cried out with surprise again, “Evil Extermination Sword! This is the Evil Extermination Sword Formula’s third level, Monumental Sword! You pig head! Even though the Evil Extermination Sword Formula has no grade, comprehending the Monumental Sword, you’re absolutely not a match!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Li Gui clearly understood the Evil Extermination Sword Formula very well. Ye Yuan had not made a move yet, and he already saw through the depths.

The Evil Extermination Sword Formula was the general outline out of Vast Heaven Sword Art. It fundamentally did not have a grade, but in terms of power, this move Monumental Sword, was absolutely much stronger than Zhuge Qingxuan’s half-baked Profound Divinity Finger!

The two were not on the same level at all!

Li Gui knew that Zhuge Qingxuan was a genius that appeared once every 100 thousand years and originally pinned high hopes on him.

But when he saw this sword of Ye Yuan’s, he knew that Zhuge Qingxuan and Ye Yuan were not on the same level at all!

Ye Yuan was absolutely a genius that appeared once every million years!

Even the Absolute Heaven back then also definitely did not have Ye Yuan’s talent!

Even though the Evil Extermination Sword Formula was the Vast Heaven Sword Art’s elementary chapter, it was absolutely not that easy to comprehend Divine Dao laws.

On the contrary, comprehending this sword art was very difficult.

But, Ye Yuan actually already comprehended to the third level, Monumental Sword!

Which was also to say that Ye Yuan was about to start officially cultivating the Vast Heaven Sword Art. That was the truly terrifying cultivation method!

However, the Profound Divinity Finger was already Zhuge Qingxuan’s final trump card. He stubbornly used this move to have a decisive showdown with Ye Yuan.

Rumble!

Two mighty incomparably profound Divine Dao laws collided. A terrifying undulation spread out, directly leveling the originally desolate surroundings.

This showdown was worthy of being called the Divine Realm’s apex confrontation!

The number one divine king who had lasted for 2000 years officially withdrew from the stage of history today.

Even if Zhuge Qingxuan obtained Kanuo’s guidance, his concepts a notch more skillful.

Even if his essence energy realm was even higher than Ye Yuan’s.

The result was still utter defeat!

Zhuge Qingxuan’s body was like a kite with a broken string, flying out backward powerlessly, smashing heavily onto the ground, and no longer made a sound.

However, Ye Yuan’s situation was not considered good.

The injuries previously were already not light. This time, forcefully deploying the Monumental Sword, it virtually drained all of his essence energy.

Don’t look at how between Ye Yuan and Zhuge Qingxuan, there was just a difference of a tiny little minor realm.

But this kind of expert showdown, if Ye Yuan did not use all of his power, he could not gain any advantage at all.

For him to be able to defeat Zhuge Qingxuan, it was entirely because of Divine Dao laws crushing!

Ye Yuan’s expression was white as paper, his entire body dead-exhausted.

“Are you alright, Big Brother?”

After confirming that Ye Yuan was just a little short on essence energy, White Light said with an excited look, “Haha, really awesome! Didn’t expect that Big Brother, your Evil Extermination Sword Formula actually already broke through to the third level! I think that your talent in Sword Dao isn’t the slightest bit inferior to the Atavism Dragon Soul! Big Brother, you finished off the Heaven Stabilizing Divine King. Now, you’re the true Divine Realm’s number one!”

Ye Yuan swallowed an essence energy recovering medicinal pills and shook his head as he said with a smile, “Divine Realm’s number one? Huhu, that’s simply a joke! Senior Fang Tian coming up with this is in order to motivate the human race martial artists to strive forward. What isn’t counted inside are too many! It’s too bad that it didn’t achieve the expected results. Only Zhuge Qingxuan, this kind of people, would immerse in it and be unable to extricate themselves.”

The Divine Realm was too large. Even if Fang Tian could pry into heaven’s secrets, it was also impossible to take everybody into calculation.

At least inside this Godsfall Mountain Range, there were quite a number of powerful existences whose strength was much stronger than the Ten Great Divine Kings.

And inside this terrifying god-forbidden region, who knew how many powerful existences there were yet.

The Divine Realm’s number one, even the Absolute Heaven back then did not dare to make such a grand boast either, right?

Zhuge Qingxuan regarded himself highly and forcibly occupied the Ten Great Divine Kings’ first place year in year out, and really thought that he was invincible under the heavens.

Little did he imagine that he was merely a frog at the bottom of a well!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s expression changed.

“Jeje ... Boy, I really have to thank you very much! That fool was beaten by you until he fell into slumber. This deity can finally control this body!”

Zhuge Qingxuan who originally did not have much aura anymore suddenly surged with an imposing momentum!
