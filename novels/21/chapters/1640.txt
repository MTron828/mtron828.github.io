Chapter 1644 Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate.

“There’s no helping it. This little lord lacks many things except divine lord mystic treasures. Now, you come and taste the explosion of divine lord mystic treasures too.”

Ye Yuan smiled, his figure suddenly disappearing.

Hao Liang’s hairs stood on end, directly displaying his movement technique, and was about to leave.

But how could Ning Tianping give him the chance to escape?

It was only to see his figure flashed, already blocking his path. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Right at this time, Ye Yuan already arrived!

A horrifying energy instantly bloomed. Hao Liang mustered up all the divine essence in his body, wanting to resist this explosion.

Rumble!

A horrifying energy exploded once more, Hao Liang’s body directly flew out backward.

Not far away, Ye Yuan’s and Ning Tianping’s figures appeared.

Ning Tianping’s face had a pale complexion. In that instant just now, he practically thought that he was going to die.

If not for Ye Yuan bringing him away, he probably would not be any better than Hao Liang.

Even though the flying speed of a third-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse was extremely fast, and he could also utilize shallow spatial laws, Ye Yuan was able to make use of spatial shuttling ability and evade the power of this explosion.

“The remaining is left to you,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Yes!”

Ning Tianping answered, directly going up and ending Hao Liang’s life, putting away his divine lord mystic treasure and storage ring.

After tidying up, Ye Yuan looked at Ning Tianping and said, “Why did you follow after?”

Ning Tianping chuckled and said, “Tianping wants to follow Your Excellency. Even running errands for Your Excellency will do as well.”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said, “I’m no longer an elder now. Furthermore, I’m a cripple. There’s a possibility that ... I’ll never break through to the Divine Lord Realm too! There’s no benefit for you to follow me.”

But Ning Tianping smiled and said, “Heh, others don’t believe Your Excellency, but I’m full of confidence in Your Excellency. If even Your Excellency isn’t able to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, that’s also too unjust. I’m following Your Excellency to wait for the day Your Excellency breaks through to the Divine Lord Realm, to also benefit from association with it.”

Ye Yuan was moved in his heart, but scolding laughingly, “You ran out like this, if the Ning Family knew this, they would probably blame it all on me.”

Ning Tianping chortled and said, “Would Your Excellency care about this? Heh heh, the elders meeting’s matter, I’ve also heard of it. But Your Excellency, don’t blame Family Head. Managing a large family clan, he naturally has to put benefits above all.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Just a small matter, not worth mentioning. Alright, the tails are also cleaned up now, we should set off.”

He waved a hand, a palace appeared before Ning Tianping’s eyes. His eyeballs were popping out as he cried out in shock, “Y-Y-Your Excellency, what’s this?”

Regarding Ning Tianping’s reaction, Ye Yuan had long anticipated it and said with a smile, “Didn’t you see it? This is a spatial-type true god mystic treasure. Our journey in the future will be relying on it.”

Ning Tianping opened his mouth wide as he said in disbelief, “T-True god mystic treasure! My God!”

Ning Tianping nearly bit off his own tongue. This was a peak true god mystic treasure. Furthermore, it was an extremely rare spatial-type true god mystic treasure.

Such a treasure, if let City Lord His Excellency knew, he would probably have wicked designs too, right?

No wonder even a Celestial Deity powerhouse could not kill His Excellency the last time! It turns out that he actually hid in here!

Ning Tianping was very smart. Ye Yuan displaying this trump card to him was equivalent to already truly acknowledging him, treating him as his own.

Walking into the towering palace, Ning Tianping felt as if he entered another world.

He suddenly thought of something and asked Ye Yuan, “Your Excellency, where are we going?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heavenspan ... Mountain!”

Ning Tianping’s entire body trembled, his eyes full of disbelief.

...

These several hundred years, Ye Yuan accumulated tens of billions of wealth. Using them to fly was more than plenty.

Ye Yuan was not familiar with the Heavenspan World outside of the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. But with Dustless, this living map, it was not to the extent of getting lost.

After over a dozen years, the two people entered a capital city.

This capital city was called Riverluck Capital City, a high-level capital city.

Riverluck Capital City’s geographical location was very special. This place was out-of-the-way, at the juncture of several major forces.

The forces here were very close and interlocked, with experts plentiful like clouds. The situation was very complicated.

The reason why they came here was that Dustless told Ye Yuan that Riverluck Capital City might have Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone for sale.

More than 400 years passed in a twinkle, the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones were almost exhausted too.

Searching for Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones was also one of Ye Yuan’s important objective of coming out.

Walking on the streets of Riverluck Capital City, the streams of people did not rest all around, appearing very prosperous.

However, in every street and alley, the skirmishes between some small factions could also be seen everywhere.

According to what Dustless said, the major and minor factions here were intricately and complicatedly linked. Birth and death were a common occurrence.

However, there were three major forces who were this capital city’s rulers. They were respectively the City Lord Manor, Sword Star Alliance, as well as the Blood Rainbow Manor.

It was said that these three great forces all had seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses holding down the fort.

In a capital city, having a seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse to hold down the fort was already extremely rare.

This kind of place was heaven for some itinerant cultivators. They supplied each other’s needs here. Therefore, the trade here was also very developed. It was even much more flourishing compared to the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

It was just in such a place, that Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones, this kind of rare and exotic treasure, have a possibility of appearing.

“Your Excellency, something’s not right! Even if Riverluck Capital City has experts abundant like clouds, this is also too many, right? On this street, Divine Lord Realm powerhouses can be seen everywhere. It’s simply even more than Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!” Ning Tianping suddenly said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head. Clearly, he also discovered a trace of an anomaly.

The time they entered the city was not long, but just the Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, they saw several dozen!

Although the vast majority of powerhouses among them were first-layered heaven Divine Lord, this number was also too exaggerated.

Counting like this, the Divine Lord Realm powerhouses in the city currently, were at least several thousand people.

This scale could even compare to some higher-level imperial cities already.

“You go and find someone to inquire about it,” Ye Yuan said.

Ning Tianping nodded his head, stopped a first-layered heaven Divine Lord, and asked, “Brother, is there some grand occasion in our Riverluck Capital City recently? Why are there so many Divine Lord Realm martial artists?”

The moment that person saw Ning Tianping’s strength, he did not dare to slight Nian Tianping, but he still said in surprise, “You actually don’t know?”

Ning Tianping could not help laughing as he said, “It’s because I don’t know that I asked you!”

Only when that person saw that Ning Tianping’s expression did not seem to be joking that he said, “Riverluck Capital City’s northern wilderness’ Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate opens once every 3000 years. At present, that long-awaited time is approaching. The divine lord realms of the ten imperial cities and capital cities in the vicinity of Riverluck Capital City all gathered here, wanting to enter the Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate to seek lucky chances. This Riverluck Capital City naturally has many Divine Lord Realm martial artists.”

“Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate?” Ning Tianping said with a puzzled look, clearly never heard of it before.

That person said, “The Suppression Ancient Heaven Gate is said to be left behind by a True God powerhouse. Large numbers of lucky chances were left behind inside. Cultivation methods, martial techniques, medicinal pills, even laws, there’s everything one can wish for. Someone had once obtained the True God powerhouse’s cultivation method inheritance inside, cultivating to the realm of True God!”
