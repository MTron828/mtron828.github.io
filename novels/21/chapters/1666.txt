Chapter 1670 Cutting in Line

Dustless was naturally not worried about Ye Yuan. He refined a small portion of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. As long as he did not seek death, the Heavenspan Mountain’s Heavenly Dao would not crush him.

Even without the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan’s strength was already comparable to a first-layered heaven Divine Lord. It was sufficient to resist the pressure of the Heavenspan Mountain already.

It was just that this strength, if Ye Yuan did not act, outsiders naturally could not tell.

Coming out from the old drunkard’s place, Ye Yuan had a confused look. So Dustless briefly recounted the matters of the old drunkard.

It turned out that the old drunkard was a servant that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove took in during his early years.

Immortal Grove saved his life back then. He followed Immortal Grove and was loyal and devoted to Immortal Grove.

But later, because of various reasons, the old drunkard left Immortal Grove and became the manager of Southfoot Town.

Dustless making Ye Yuan come to Southfoot Town was naturally because of this consideration.

Back then, when the old drunkard heard that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove perished, he had once cried for three days and nights.

He resolved to take revenge for Immortal Grove, but his strength was too weak. That was why he drowned his sorrows in alcohol every day.

Immortal Grove’s enemy was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. How difficult was it to break through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm?

Several days later, it just happened to be the one year date.

On the Heavenspan Mountain, a beam of light slowly extended out and landed on the ground outside the small town.

All of the martial artists going to the Heavenspan Mountain gathered in the wilderness.

They all held a wooden plaque in their hands. This was the sequence number plates issued by the old drunkard.

People without a wooden plaque were not permitted to go up the Heavenspan Mountain.

This was not the Heavenspan Mountain’s rules. It was just a rule of Southfoot Town. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhuo Han swept a glance and suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan did not have a wooden plaque in his hands. He instantly understood something.

“Haha, kid, you don’t even have a wooden plaque, so what did you run here for? I almost forgot. We took the last few pieces of wooden plaques that day. You guys came after us. So ... you still got to wait a year! Hahaha!” Zhuo Han said with a loud laugh.

He burned with rage that day and did not notice this matter.

Recalling it now, they just happened to have received the last few pieces of wooden plaques. That Ye Yuan naturally did not have a wooden plaque on hand.

Leng Qiuling they all were slightly earlier, Zhuo Han they all followed closely behind.

Then later, it was Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping.

Zhuo Han’s loud laughter immediately attracted the attention of many people.

“I got it. You came to see Junior Sister Leng! Huhu, do you think that this young master couldn’t tell that she used you as a shield? You wouldn’t think that she’s really interested in you, right? Stop trying to strike out of your league. You and she are not in the same world at all. An ant like you will never understand the disparity between you guys, give up!” Zhuo Han shot Ye Yuan down without any consideration.

“No way, right? An Origin Deity Realm actually wanted to punch above his weight and pursue Leng Qiuling?”

“Really overestimating his own ability! Doesn’t take a piss to look at his own reflection at either!”

“Heh heh, another Origin Deity Realm who came to court death. Going to the Heavenspan Mountain, he won’t even have his life anymore, yet still want to pursue Beauty Leng!”

...

Clearly, Leng Qiuling was very famous. The Divine Lord Realm martial artists present, there were quite a number of people who knew her.

Hearing Zhuo Han said so, they immediately mocked Ye Yuan heavily.

People had this kind of psychology, what they could not obtain, they were even more reluctant to see others obtain.

Although there was nothing between Ye Yuan and Leng Qiuling, Zhuo Han’s words made him become the target of public scorn.

Leng Qiuling clearly heard Zhuo Han’s words too and immediately flared up and said angrily, “Zhuo Han, say any more nonsense, do you believe that I’ll tear your mouth?”

But Zhuo Han smiled and said, “Junior Sister Leng, could it be that I said wrongly? You wouldn’t really have fallen for this kid, right?”

Leng Qiuling’s expression turned cold and she said, “That’s none of your business!”

Ye Yuan secretly heaved a sigh. Leng Qiuling saying this kind of words, wasn’t it making things more vague?

Sure enough, quite a few people used even weirder expressions to look at Ye Yuan. Some gazes were rather unfriendly.

If looks could kill, he would already have been killed countless times.

“Idiot, stop simply guessing. I came to go up the Heavenspan Mountain,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Zhuo Han’s expression turned cold and he said in a great rage, “Punk, you’re very gutsy! If you have the capability, hide in Southfoot Town for the rest of your life and don’t ever go out! I want to see how you go up the Heavenspan Mountain without a wooden plaque. Do you think that Southfoot Town’s guards are all useless?”

At this time, the old drunkard brought two armored people and walked over here while drinking alcohol.

The old drunkard said, hazy-eyed from drinking, “Those with wooden plaques in their hands, line up in order for me!”

Those watching a show did not dare to dawdle at this time, immediately lining up properly according to the number plates.

While Zhuo Han looked at Ye Yuan with a smug look, prepared to see him get shot down.

Everyone knew that this old drunkard’s strength was unfathomable.

Once he was unhappy, the consequences were rather terrifying.

Indeed, the old drunkard headed over to Ye Yuan’s side staggeringly.

Zhuo Han sneered in his heart and said, “Fool who doesn’t know life from death, see how you still be arrogant! Best that you provoke the guardian to flare up and kill you, an abominable brat!”

The old drunkard gave Ye Yuan a drunken and bleary-eyed glance, smiled, and suddenly said to the two people beside him, “The two of you, give the two of them the wooden plaques.”

Those two people were stunned, wondering if they heard wrongly.

Zhuo Han’s expression changed too, uncertain of what was going on.

“Y-Your Excellency, what ... what did you say?”

The old drunkard’s expression turned cold. Those two people seemed to have had their throats stuck, expressions becoming very ugly.

The old drunkard said in a cold voice, “I said, give the two of them your wooden plaque! Don’t you understand?”

This time, they heard it clearly.

These two people were Zhuo Han’s junior apprentice brothers. They used pleading eyes to look over at Zhuo Han.

Zhuo Han had a stunned look too, completely not understanding what happened.

He stepped forward and said to the old drunkard carefully with clasped hands: “Your Excellency, clearly we came first. So why should we give up the wooden plaques?”

The old drunkard said indifferently, “Your father asked you to give, so give. What’s with all the nonsense?”

By the side, the others were astounded faces too, completely not understanding why such a thing would happen.

“What’s going on? I came to Southfoot Town several times already and have never encountered such a thing before.”

“Yeah, it has always been first come, first served. Why can those two punks cut in line?”

“Could it be that they are that lord’s disciple? Doesn’t look like it either!”

...

Leng Qiuling’s beautiful eyes looked at Ye Yuan in extreme shock.

She discovered more and more that she could not see through this boy who was as old as her.

Talent was clearly very poor, yet revealed all kinds of bizarreness surrounding him.

Zhuo Han was thunderstruck by the old drunkard’s words until he was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.

It was still his first time encountering such a thing and he was completely baffled.

If it were others, he would just swallow it. Yet, this person was Ye Yuan!

Hence, he toughened his scalp and said, “Your Excellency, I ... I’m unconvinced! B-Based on what?”

The old drunkard said coolly, “Based on what? Based on that this Southfoot Town is managed by this father of yours! The words that your father said are the imperial decree!”
