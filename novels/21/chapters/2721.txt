Chapter 2727: Battle of Servants!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shi Yue’s expression changed greatly, powerful divine essence instantly erupting, and he was about to evade this hoof.

He suddenly discovered that this hoof was faster than any kick earlier!

This large yellow bull was actually still hiding its strength?

Shi Yue urged his divine essence to the extreme in an instant.

Even if it was a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, he could avoid it too.

It was just that unfortunately, he ran into Big Yellow!

He was fast, but Big Yellow was faster!

His figure moved swiftly, but Big Yellow’s bull hoof followed like a shadow.

Bang!

A foot kicked onto his face.

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock.

Shi Yue was defeated too!

Who was Shi Yue?

He was a top powerhouse among itinerant cultivators, an existence that sects did not dare to provoke too.

An itinerant cultivator like him, having powerful strength while being a loner, was the worst to provoke.

Although Wei Yu was strong, he was not worth mentioning at all in front of Shi Yue.

Hence, that was why he had the capital to pick a fight with Ye Yuan.

But one kick and he was defeated!

“Hahaha,?impressive! My Big Yellow is really incredible! Big Yellow, follow me and you’ll be invincible under the heavens!” Taoist Wu Fang said excitedly.

Big Yellow could not be bothered to care about him at all, running back subserviently and handing the Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower over to Ye Yuan while holding it in his mouth.

Ye Yuan smiled. Putting it away, he said to the Shi Yue who had a bull hoof print on his face: “My words are still valid. You gather the Four Qi Pill’s heavenly medicines, and you can find me to refine it. I’ll be keeping this Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower. Next time, don’t be so unscrupulous.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan led Big Yellow and went away.

“This … This is also too fake, right? Just what realm is this large yellow bull, why is his bull hoof so formidable?”

“Shi Yue’s strength practically doesn’t lose to some heavenly sects’ sect master, he actually couldn’t withstand a single hoof kick!”

“Is this the strength of a chaos aberrant? No wonder even Taoist Wu Fang’s eyes were emitting light!”

“But, the problem is, this large yellow bull is so formidable, on what basis was he subdued by a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven?”

… …

All kinds of discussions came from behind.

It was just that no one could give an answer.

Originally thought that this ascender was easy to bully, but who knew that he was a tough nut.

“Don’t hit the face when hitting people! This brat actually dares to hit my Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s face! After I request Second Elder to step forward, I want to see if you still dare to be so arrogant or not!”

Finished saying, Wei Yu turned around and left.

When everyone heard it, their brows raised up.

The Second Elder that Wei Yu spoke of was called Tang Quan. He was a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven super powerhouse.

If he took action, this brat definitely could not jump around anymore.

Looks like Wei Yu was genuinely enraged.

… …

Walking into his own courtyard, a young man came up to greet.

When Ye Yuan saw him, his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

The young man’s complexion was pale, his aura chaotic. One glance and it was clear that he had considerable internal injuries.

With Ye Yuan’s eyesight, he naturally saw through at a glance that this injury was not light.

His days were likely numbered!

The young man bowed as he said, “This lowly one, Han Fang, pays respect to Senior!?Cough, cough?…”

Speaking two sentences seemed to have exhausted all the strength in his body.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said, “With your injuries, you likely won’t make it past two months.”

Han Fang’s expression changed, the look in his eyes becoming dim very quickly and he said, “This lowly one knows.”

Ye Yuan was speechless. The Jadetrue Heavenly Sect actually sent such a sickly invalid to serve him, they really thought highly enough of him.

That Zong Rui was simply showing him attitude!

This Han Fang was merely a lower Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse; just a notch stronger than that Jun Tian.

In the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s outer-sect, he was likely just a low-level minor character too.

What was even more damnable was that this guy was clearly just beaten by someone. Furthermore, no punches were pulled, it was clearly aiming for his life.

Furthermore, Han Fang’s talent was extremely poor. Cultivating like this, he probably could not reach Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum in this lifetime.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Jadetrue Heavenly Sect really knows how to bully people! However, I like to slap their faces!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As he said, Ye Yuan fished out four small bottles and directly threw them over and said coolly, “You take these heavenly pills. Just enter closed-seclusion here! Three days later, whoever beat you until like this, you go and beat them back for me!”

Han Fang was taken aback and said with a bitter smile, “Senior, forget about three days; even if you give me 30 years, it’s impossible for me to win against him too! Furthermore, he’s currently the servant of Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s number one genius, Wei Yu. After beating him, he likely won’t let it slide!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he could not help smiling.

It was really coincidental!

“If I said that three days is enough, it will suffice! You consume the heavenly pill in this first vial first. Following that, consume all of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills in these two bottles within a day. On the last day, take the heavenly pills in this fourth bottle.” Ye Yuan instructed.

Grade two heavenly pills were already not considered very valuable to the current Ye Yuan.

Using them to slap the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect and Wei Yu’s face, Ye Yuan was happy to see it happen.

Returning to the house, Han Fang opened the first vial and his expression could not help changing.

Ninth grade perfection Heavenly Healing Pill!

This heavenly pill was simply a healing sacred medicine to him!

Consuming the Heavenly Healing Pill, Han Fang’s injuries were completely restored to health in less than half a day.

Following that, he started to take the second and third bottles.

Ninth grade perfection Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!

Han Fang sucked in a breath of cold air.

The first vial only had one heavenly pill.

There were 30 Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills in these two small bottles, they were all ninth grade perfection!

What a grand display!

It was still his first time seeing so many ninth grade perfection heavenly pills having lived until now!

When Han Fang finished refining the 30th Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, he felt like his entire person had been remolded anew.

His absorption speed of spiritual energy was dozens of times faster than before!

Ninth grade perfection heavenly pills were too terrifying!

And his realm also directly reached middle Greater Sublime Heaven.

On the second day, Han Fang swallowed the heavenly pills in the fourth vial. It was three cultivation heavenly pills; the grade already approached the level of heavenly imperial pills.

After consuming them, Han Fang directly broke through to upper Greater Sublime Heaven on the third day!

After leaving seclusion, Han Fang prostrated on the ground to Ye Yuan and said, “This lowly one thanks Senior for your great kindness! This lowly one is willing to lay down my life to repay Senior!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Stop talking rubbish, go and beat that guy up ruthlessly for me.”

Han Fang said excitedly, “Yes, Senior!”

Two hours later, Han Fang returned. Bowing again, he said excitedly, “Senior, he has already been maimed by me! He can forget about getting up from his bed in a month!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Good job!”

Over there, Wei Yu was in a thunderous rage.

He already knew that the one who beat him was Ye Yuan’s servant.

He did not dare to find Ye Yuan, so he ran in front of Zong Rui angrily and questioned, “Zong Rui! Does your Jadetrue Heavenly Sect still have any respect for our Seven-star Heavenly Sect? The servant that you arranged for me actually can’t compare to that bastard ascender’s!”

Zong Rui also got the news already and knew what Wei Yu was talking about.

Except, he was very puzzled too.. He could only smile bitterly and say, “Younger Brother Wei, you’ve wronged me! People I arranged for you were the outer-sect’s top few powerhouses! The one arranged for Ye Yuan was the outer-sect’s last place. Furthermore, he was even seriously injured! Who knew that he only used three days and actually directly broke through to upper Greater Sublime Heaven?”
