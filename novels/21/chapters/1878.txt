Chapter 1882: Tang Yan’s True Identity!

Rumble!

Within the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace, intense undulations transmitted out from time to time.

That horrifying energy made the entire heavenly palace start to tremble intensely.

Ye Yuan’s expression was ugly as he said, “What’s going on here?”

“Someone is confronting the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace’s restrictions!” Dustless said with a frown.

Ye Yuan was shocked and said, “Confronting? Being able to confront the restrictions so enduringly, Empyrean powerhouses probably can’t do it too, right?”

Dustless nodded his head and said in a solemn voice, “Come, let’s go to the Immortal Grove Hall. If Old Fart Immortal Grove left behind anything, it’s likely left there.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head. Following Dustless’s guidance, he sped over towards the Immortal Grove Hall swiftly.

...

Inside the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace, Tang Yan arrived leisurely.

Those restrictive forces that were powerful until it made the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace shudder had no effect on him at all.

And the direction that he was going in was surprisingly, precisely the Immortal Grove Hall.

With a creak, the Immortal Grove Hall’s front door was lightly pushed open. A power that was daunting until it made people quiver abruptly erupted.

However, facing this force, Tang Yan just lightly waved his hand and it immediately turned to ashes.

After stepping in, Tang Yan’s gaze never shifted away before.

“W-World Suppressing Stele?!” At this time, a voice sounded out on the other side of the hall.

Tang Yan lifted his head slightly and looked over, and discovered that astonishment was written all over Ye Yuan’s face.

He just entered the hall from a side-door and discovered that the sculptures of the Four Symbols Divine Beasts were set up in the four corners of the great hall.

Apart from this, it was stark empty inside the hall. There was only a stone stele suppressing in the center position, emitting a terrifying aura.

This stone stele, Ye Yuan was quite familiar it. What was it if not the World Suppressing Stele?

However, the World Suppressing Stele was clearly on him, then what was this stone stele?

Ye Yuan did not believe that this World Suppressing Stele in the great hall was the genuine World Suppressing Stele. Because Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s goal was not the World Suppressing Stele at all, but the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain inside the World Suppressing Stele!

And the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was precisely in his, Ye Yuan’s, hands.

“That’s right! It’s precisely the World Suppressing Stele!” Tang Yan said with a faint smile.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and he looked at Tang Yan and said, “Tang Yan, who on earth are you?”

Tang Yan looked at Ye Yuan and said with a faint smile, “With your intellect and wit, haven’t you already guessed it? Why is there a need to get confirmation from me?”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, his heart twitching violently, squeezing four words out of his crevices between his teeth. “Heavenly ... Emperor ... Jiu ... Shang!”

This Tang Yan had always given Ye Yuan a very peculiar feeling.

This person was too low-profile. But each time, he could make it through safe and sound.

Most importantly, when everyone felt imperiled by danger, this Tang Yan could still maintain an expression that was rippleless like an ancient well. This was absolutely not ordinary.

In reality, Ye Yuan had always thought that Tang Yan was an Empyrean powerhouse. But under that blade of Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s, Tang Yan did not make a move. This had surprised him greatly.

Ye Yuan never dreamed that Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang actually personally took action!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Now, the truth was brought into the light!

Ye Yuan finally understood just what Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove set up such a grand spectacle for.

He wanted to draw his greatest sworn enemy, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, over!

He used the World Suppressing Stele to draw him over!

Actually, right from the beginning, Ye Yuan faintly had some surmises, feeling that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove definitely did not lay down such a grand set up in order to choose a successor.

Because Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s successor was him, Ye Yuan.

Then, there was only one reason that he would do this. It was revenge!

Except, he could not figure out what Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was relying on to dare do so.

Forget that he was already dead, even if he was currently in his prime, it was also impossible to be Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s match!

Heavenly Emperor, Heavenly Empyrean, even though it was only one word off, the strength margin was akin to heaven and earth.

Even if Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was just an existence who refined a Heavenly Emperor Dao Fruit.

Tang Yan smiled slightly and said, “For Old Fart Immortal Grove to be able to find a successor like you, his life was truly not spent in vain!”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he said, “You knew long ago?”

Jiu Shang smiled and said, “You were able to forcibly resist True God Realm powerhouses along the way and could hide from other people’s eyes. But you can’t hide from this emperor’s arcane sight! How can a mere initial-rank empyrean spirit treasure be able to let a Celestial Deity Realm have such strength? It’s just that this trip, you shouldn’t have come!”

Ye Yuan had already obtained Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s legacy. In Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s view, he could totally not get involved in this messy situation.

He was only at the Celestial Deity Realm. This trip here was too perilous.

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath, borrowing this to subside the astonishment in his heart.

No matter what, with a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse suddenly appearing in front of him, Ye Yuan still could not help being shocked in his heart.

One had to know, this young man in front of him was a formidable existence who fought with Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove several million years ago!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, and he said, “When Immortal Grove opened up another World Locking Gate, I had to come on this trip!”

Jiu Shang was slightly surprised as he said, “You were actually born in the Immortal Grove small world?”

Ye Yuan’s heart turned cold, secretly thinking to himself that this Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang had such meticulous thinking. Just based on a sentence from him, he guessed that he was born in the Immortal Grove World.

“Cultivating from a bumpkin until Celestial Deity Realm, to actually only use a short thousand over years, your talent is really rarely seen in this emperor’s lifetime! Old Fart Immortal Grove found a fine successor!” Jiu Shang said rather emotionally.

Ye Yuan fell silent.

His emotion was very complicated. Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang personally taking action exceeded his expectations.

If it were Empyrean powerhouses, he could still make use of this Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace to dance around.

But a Heavenly Emperor was too strong.

Once Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang exploded with full power, the Immortal Grove World would immediately fall apart into pieces. There was no leeway to maneuver at all.

“Huhu, you must be very curious why this emperor would personally take action. Actually, this emperor has coveted Old Fart Immortal Grove’s World Suppressing Stele for a long time already. Before obtaining the World Suppressing Stele, even if he had the World Suppressing Stele and Ten-Directional Sword, this emperor doesn’t lose to him too! But ever since he obtained the World Suppressing Stele, he continuously suppressed this emperor until I couldn’t lift my head. In fact, he was going to step into the realm of Heavenly Emperor a step earlier than this emperor! Therefore, this emperor guessed that a heaven-shocking secret must be hidden inside the World Suppressing Stele.”

As he said, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s gaze became heated.

The more he said, the more alarmed Ye Yuan got.

This Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was definitely a terrifying character. From some clues and inklings, he could guess so many things.

Furthermore, what he guessed was totally right!

The secret contained inside the World Suppressing Stele, probably even Dao Ancestors would go crazy for it, let alone a puny little Empyrean powerhouse.

“Heh heh, this old fart laid down such a grand scheme, isn’t it in order to tell this emperor that the World Suppressing Stele is here? When he wasn’t dead, this emperor wasn’t even afraid of him. Now that he’s dead, would this emperor really not dare to come? Hahaha!”

As he said, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang slowly strode out, walking over toward the World Suppressing Stele in the middle of the great hall.

Rumble!

Suddenly, the immortal grove heavenly palace started trembling violently.

In the four corners of the hall, the four enormous sculptures actually came to life.

“Roar, roar, roar, roar!”

Four light figures rose to the sky. Those four statues actually flew toward the World Suppressing Stele in the center of the hall together!
