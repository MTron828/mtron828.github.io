Chapter 1979: Whatever You Say

Even if the Empyrean had already died for no idea how many tens of thousands of years, his remains were still radiating golden light, emitting an extremely profound energy undulation.

This golden bone was indestructible and imperishable.

“What powerful energy undulations. This Empyrean was likely already approaching the Heavenly Emperor Realm when he was alive,” Song Yu said with terror in his heart.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said in approval, “Those bone devils were likely bone under the influence of this Empyrean’s remains, and they also grew up under his Dao skandha, resulting in reaching today’s realm. Hence, Zuo Mo they all wanting to get this Empyrean’s remains resulted in driving those bone devils mad.”

Guo Jingyang chuckled and said, “They lured all those bone devils away, which benefited us. The Dao skandha and energy contained inside this Empyrean’s remains is sufficient to let us break through quite a few realms.”

This Empyrean’s remains had a lot of spirituality. Furthermore, it contained tremendous energy. Using it to cultivate and using it to comprehend Heavenly Dao would both yield twice the results with half the effort.

What was called a massive lucky chance? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This was it! This was called a massive lucky chance!

In this Ancient God Battlefield, no idea how many major powers had once perished.

Even if just obtained a tiny bit, it was also sufficient for them to benefit for life.

“I feel that the remains of this Empyrean should be owned by Brother Ye. Along the way, without him, we might have been long dead,” Hu Fei said.

A hint of unwillingness to party flashed across in Song Yu’s gaze. But he struggled for a while and still nodded and said, “What you said is right. Brother Ye, the remains of this Empyrean belongs to you.”

The treasure being in front, saying that they were unmoved was fake. But they were also clear in their hearts, if not for Ye Yuan, they could not walk until here at all.

Along the way, Ye Yuan exerted the most effort, but he distributed the treasures to everyone.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Those who see it have a share, what’s the deal with me pocketing it all by myself? This Empyrean’s remains, everyone shares them equally.”

Song Yu was taken aback when he heard that and said, “Brother Ye isn’t joking, right? This Empyrean’s remains are likely even harder than ordinary empyrean spirit treasures, how to split?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “We can’t divide it, but somebody can divide it!”

Everyone was uncertain what it meant. While they were in a daze, Ye Yuan already walked over toward the remains.

It was only to see him picking up the Empyrean’s remains. He actually directly started to refine it on the spot.

Buzz!

Right at this time, an immensely powerful soul force suddenly emerged from the Empyrean’s remains.

“Hahaha! This old man was trapped for countless eons! Today, I finally get to see the light of day anew! Kid, in order to repay you, become this old man’s fleshy body!”

Seeing this old figure, the faces of Song Yu and the rest all changed drastically.

“Empyrean’s residual thought! This Empyrean powerhouse actually sealed a wisp of his residual thought inside the remains!’ Song Yu cried out in shock.

“Be careful, Brother Ye!” Guo Jingyang and the rest had looks of terror on their faces as they shouted.

The aura that this Empyrean’s residual thought exhibited was too powerful, making their divine souls quiver.

Empyreans were existences standing at the summit of this world.

Their might, mortals were completely unable to understand it.

In front of this Empyrean’s residual thought, they could not give rise to any thought of resisting at all.

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of running at all. Looking at the Empyrean’s residual thought, he smiled and said, “Senior, I’ll have to trouble you to divide this into five portions.”

The Empyrean’s residual thought was just immersing in the wild ecstasy of breaking free. But hearing Ye Yuan’s words, his laughter abruptly ceased.

Could it be that this kid was a fool?

Right now, this old man is about to seize possession of you!

Not just him, even Song Yu they all were also shocked speechless.

What was Ye Yuan doing here?

The script shouldn’t be like this!

Could it be that Ye Yuan was scared silly by this Empyrean’s residual thought that suddenly came out?

“Kid, this Empyrean is going to take possession of you right now. Don’t you understand?”

The Empyrean’s residual thought looked at Ye Yuan with a puzzled face.

This brat did not look like a fool no matter how one looked at him!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m asking you to divide the remains. Don’t you understand?”

Fool!

Absolutely a moron!

At this moment, the Empyrean’s residual thought was incomparably certain that this was absolutely a moron!

“Forget it, indeed a fool. I’ll free you afterward, and you’ll thank this Empyrean!”

The Empyrean’s residual thought felt very bored. He felt that at this time, Ye Yuan should be trembling and kneeling on the ground, begging him for mercy.

But the script did not develop according to his expectations.

He wanted to seize possession of Ye Yuan, but Ye Yuan actually wanted him to divide the remains.

Back then, after a great battle, he was heavily injured on the verge of death.

He was unresigned to it and wanted to revive.

Hence, he refined his lifetime cultivation all into a bone of his.

Then, he directly sealed a wisp of his remnant thought inside this bone and fell into an endless slumber.

As long as someone obtained these remains and attempted to refine them, they would be able to open the seal and let him come out to seize possession and revive.

Now, someone refined it, so he came out.

He thought that the world would quiver because of it, but Ye Yuan did not.

Rumble!

The Empyrean’s residual thought turned into a cloud of black smoke and attempted to directly tunnel into Ye Yuan’s body.

“Careful, Brother Ye!”

The faces of Song Yu and the rest changed drastically, wanting to rush forward. But their feet could not move at all.

But right at this time, an even more horrifying aura erupted from Ye Yuan’s body.

An enormous soul vortex was like a limitless blackhole, and it actually took the initiative to welcome the Empyrean’s residual thought.

“Argh! E-Empyrean spirit treasure! Damn it!”

The Empyrean’s residual thought that originally had an imposing momentum suddenly cried out strangely. That cloud of black smoke desperately wanted to break free of the vortex’s suction.

But how could Dustless possibly let him escape?

The Soul Suppressing Pearl was precisely these soul bodies’ jinx.

Back then, the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s spiritual energy was virtually drained dry by Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

But after Ye Yuan’s so many years of nourishing, the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s vital energy already recovered 60% to 70%.

This 60% to 70% strength was naturally inadequate to deal with genuine Empyreans. But dealing with a mere remnant thought was sufficient.

That Empyrean’s residual thought unleashed all of its abilities, wanting to escape the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s suction. But he was currently like having fallen into a quagmire, unable to extricate himself at all.

His mood gradually went from surprise to fear.

“Little Brother, t-this old man knows that he is wrong. Let this old man off, alright? This old man really knows that he is wrong!”

How did the Empyrean’s residual thought still have that insufferable arrogance from earlier? His words even carried weeping.

He was really scared!

The threat that this kind of soul-type empyrean spirit treasure posed to him was too great.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I can let you go, but you must divide the remains into five portions.”

How could the Empyrean’s residual thought still dare to say a word of no? He hurriedly said, “Whatever Little Brother says is what it is! Don’t talk about five portions; even 50 parts, this old man will divide for you too.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head. The soul vortex instantly dissipated. The pressure on the Empyrean’s residual thought’s body suddenly eased up, revealing his figure once more.

Except, his figure was clearly much fainter compared to before. The expression on his face also appeared very weary. Clearly, he sustained considerable damage.

Song Yu and the rest looked at this scene blankly. Each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths.

There was still this kind of strategy?
