Chapter 2110: Rectifying Name

Qi Chen’s face could practically squeeze water out. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

His heart already sunk to rock-bottom along with Qi Zhen’s words.

What did Qi Zhen’s words mean?

Sacred Ancestor High Priest, Ancestor Si Chen, what level of existences were those people? Qi Zhen actually placed them in the same category with Ye Yuan.

Wouldn’t this mean that even if Qi Zhen went up, there was not the slightest chance of victory too?

Qi Zhen was reputed as an existence that was the next Ancestor Si Chen in the Qilin Clan. So how high was his status?

If not for this, how could Qi Chen pledge in all solemnity to take the Jadecleanse Truefire Bottle out as a wager?

“Qi Zhen, then if you took the stage, how much assurance do you have?” Qi Chen asked with a grim look.

Qi Zhen shook his head and said, “No confidence at all!”

Everyone trembled all over!

What Qi Zhen said was no confidence at all!

With Qi Zhen’s strength, how formidable did the strength have to be before it could make him say this kind of words?

Everyone present understood Qi Zhen very well, his confidence in alchemy, no one could smash it.

But now, Qi Zhen actually did not even dare to say that he had a 10% chance.

What kind of concept was this?

“This ... How is this possible? Big Brother, you’re an existence that’s going to inherit Ancestor Si Chen’s mantle, so how can you possibly fail to deal with even a Six-star priest?” Qi Yun said with a look of disbelief.

Qi Zhen shook his head and said, “Prior to this, even if I knew that he’s an Ancestor Realm powerhouse, I also wouldn’t feel that he can pose any threat to me. But after witnessing his alchemy skills, I have no choice but to admit that he, this Second Sage, lives up to his name!”

Lives up to his name!

This was Qi Zhen’s evaluation of Ye Yuan!

Everyone was taken aback by shock. When they knew that Ye Yuan was Second Sage, there was more contempt and disdain.

But now, Qi Zhen gave him such a high appraisal.

... ...

Following Ye Yuan’s pill refinement going in-depth, one stream of flowing light after another flew out of the medicinal cauldron and converged into the stars, shattering and reassembling.

One light band after another was akin to the aurora; too beautiful to be absorbed all at once.

In the plaza, countless demons seemed to have been brought into the depths of the starry sky, roaming heaven and earth.

That kind of feeling made people feel enraptured.

No shocking and outrageous aura, and also did not raise a shocking commotion that caught people’s eyes. Everyone happened so naturally.

Under the atmosphere that Ye Yuan created, people already forgot about Crimsonsky, and forgot that they were still battling on alchemy.

They were only purely admiring, purely experiencing it.

This alchemy battle became Ye Yuan’s one-man performance.

Crimsonsky’s Alchemy Dao aura became smaller and smaller. Finally, it became small until it could be overlooked.

What Qi Zhen said, he could feel it completely. Furthermore, he felt it even more vividly than Qi Zhen.

This was just a one-time textbook example. Ye Yuan was teaching him how to refine pills and not doing some alchemy battle.

Alchemy battle?

What alchemy battle was there still!

Crimsonsky could not help smiling ruefully in his heart. It turned out that this was Second Sage’s true strength!

Crimsonsky could feel that Ye Yuan’s realm was only a little higher than his.

But pill refinement had never been about just the realm.

Pill refinement was an extremely complicated process. Any minor detail could determine the quality of the medicinal pill in the end.

Clearly, Ye Yuan performed the other aspects of pill refinement to the limits outside of one’s realm!

As long as his realm was there, even if Sacred Ancestor High Priest was here, there was no reason he could not have a battle!

Only at this moment did Crimsonsky truly experience why Sacred Ancestor High Priest would confer Ye Yuan as Second Sage.

This kind of strength simply had no weaknesses to exploit!

Unless one completely crushed him in Alchemy Dao realm, otherwise, there wasn’t the slightest chance of victory at all.

What was even scarier was that Ye Yuan was only less than 2000 years old!

While him?

He was called an alchemy genius, High Priest Redplume’s genius, the young generation’s disciples.

But compared to Ye Yuan, he was already an old man!

Ye Yuan’s potential was simply unimaginable.

When everything settled down, that vast starry sea transformed into a formation diagram, and gradually integrated into the medicinal cauldron.

Pill formed!

People finally woke up from the shock. All of the gazes were gathered on that young figure on the stage.

“Marvelous work of art! Truly a marvelous work of art! Turns out that this is Lord Second Sage’s true strength! The title of Second Sage lives up to reality as well as in name!”

“I finally understand why Sacred Ancestor High Priest conferred him as Second Sage.”

“Although I couldn’t understand Lord Second Sage’s pill refinement at all, he’s really very, very incredible!”

... ...

At this very moment, there was already no one who questioned Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s decision anymore.

Ye Yuan defeated the same rank Crimsonsky in a close to crushing manner.

Within the same generation, he was almost invincible!

If this kind of person was not fit to be called Second Sage, who was worthy?

Although there were many demon race priests present, some were even Six-star priests who were more or less the same as Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan’s pill refinement, they could not understand at all.

Ye Yuan’s realm was far higher than theirs.

However, this did not hinder them from feeling that Ye Yuan was remarkable. Because this kind of thing could not be faked, and it was clear at a glance.

Crimsonsky already gave up. There was no meaning at all to him continuing. Although these spirit medicines were very precious, he already lost the courage to carry on.

He slowly came before Ye Yuan, bowed all the way down, and said respectfully, “Crimsonsky overestimated his own ability and challenged Lord Second Sage. Lord Second Sage, please deal the punishment.”

No one felt that Crimsonsky’s action had anything inappropriate. On the contrary, they felt that it was natural and right.

Crimsonsky’s strength going to challenge Ye Yuan could indeed be called overestimating his ability.

Although similarly Ancestor Realm, their true pill refining strength was not on the same level at all.

The current Crimsonsky already put away his arrogance long ago and was respectful like a little student in front of Ye Yuan.

Toward Ye Yuan, he already prostrated on all fours in admiration.

He had never thought that there was actually still such an existence among the young generation.

Actually, many people were clear that Sacred Ancestor High Priest would not shoot at random, but Ye Yuan was seriously too young, young until it made people unable to believe that he could become Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Crimsonsky was likewise the same. Coupled with that he was High Priest Redplume’s disciple, he was even more indignant about Ye Yuan riding on top of his master’s head, that was why he would come and challenge Ye Yuan.

But now, he actually produced a trace of wavering towards his own master.

Ye Yuan was just roughly a thousand years old. Ten thousand years later, would his master really be Ye Yuan’s match?

Crimsonsky did not know, but he knew that the Ye Yuan after ten thousand years would probably have flung him no idea how many streets behind.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Forget it, my realm is right here to see. So it’s normal that you all have doubts. If there’s someone who feels that this sage is unworthy of the title, you can still come and challenge me.”

Everyone’s faces turned slightly somber. Many people recalled making quite a number of malicious remarks about Ye Yuan previously, saying that Ye Yuan was unworthy of the title of Second Sage. Some even scolded very nastily, and could not help feeling ashamed at this time.

Crimsonsky hurriedly said, “Dare not, dare not! Second Sage’s strength, even if my few senior apprentice brothers came, it’s also merely thus. And they are only a little higher than Lord Second Sage’s realm, that’s all. After Lord Second Sage’s realm is there, I’m afraid they won’t be a match.”
