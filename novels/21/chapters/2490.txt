Chapter 2496: Humanity’s Number One Person!

“The second passageway opened! A-Another person corroborated their Dao and became an ancestor!”

“Ancestor Tian Qing has already become Dao Ancestor Destruction. Coupled with his own strength, he’s already absolutely invincible! I wonder who this second Dao Ancestor is!”

“Sigh,?I hope that humanity can get a few more spots. Otherwise … the days ahead will be tough to get by!”

… …

The struggle for Dao Ancestor was already nearing its end. Many Deva powerhouses already came out of the Heavenspan Mountain.

Those nine passageways, only by obtaining a rule crystal could one stay inside.

The others were transported out automatically.

Some people only entered the Heavenspan Mountain to try their luck.

They could not obtain the rule crystal, so they fumbled for some lucky chances, and then came out.

There were nine passageways above the void.

When a passageway opened, a new Dao Ancestor was born.

So far, only the first passageway had opened.

And the one who walked out of it was precisely the divine race’s Ten-marks powerhouse, Tian Qing!

Tian Qing refined the destruction crystal and became Dao Ancestor Destruction!

This Dao Ancestor Destruction was on a completely different level from the previous Dao Ancestor Destruction.

Ten-marks powerhouse plus destruction rule, he was simply capable of destroying any strongholds.

The human powerhouses present virtually lost all hope.

At present, the periphery of the Heavenspan Mountain was not just the powerhouses who entered the Heavenspan Mountain. Many people who did not enter the Heavenspan Mountain were also looking about.

After all, the birth of new Dao Ancestors was an unprecedented grand occasion!

Tian Qing currently had his eyes closed and was regulating his breathing when he saw a second passageway suddenly erupt with rays of brilliant light, and he could not help opening his eyes.

He was also very curious about who would be the second to come out.

A figure slowly walked out. A powerful flame rule was akin to the blazing sun high above in the sky, shining until everyone could not open their eyes.

His appearance was as if the divine buddha was alive, illuminating the world.

That astonishing bearing made everyone daunted at the sight of him!

Seeing the arrival, Tian Qing could not help frowning.

Clearly, this new Dao Ancestor Flame surprised him a little.

“I-It’s Dao Ancestor Life, Lin Chaotian! He … He became the new Dao Ancestor Firespirit!”

“Damn it! How could it be him? He’s in possession of wood and fire, two great rules. After this … who is still his match?”

“I didn’t expect that he actually became a Dao Ancestor a second time! Furthermore, he’s the most terrifying Dao Ancestor Firespirit!”

… …

Lin Chaotian’s appearance immediately caused a stir.

This result was what they were not willing to see.

Disregarding the divine race’s side, a person like Lin Chaotian becoming humanity’s number one person was absolutely a calamity and not a blessing to the human race!

How could the human race who experienced the Doomsday Battle not understand this point?

The corners of Lin Chaotian’s mouth curled slightly, and he looked at Tian Qing and said, “Tian Qing, you seem to be very surprised by this ancestor’s appearance?”

The current Lin Chaotian no longer had that overcautious and timid mood.

Facing Tian Qing, this divine race’s number one person, he exuded indescribable self-confidence.

Tian Qing’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “You seem to be very proud of yourself!”

Lin Chaotian laughed loudly and said, “Yes, this ancestor is really very pleased with myself right now! Tian Qing, didn’t you claim to be the divine race’s number one person? This ancestor currently really wants to see just how strong you are!”

The moment these words came out, everyone was stunned.

No one expected that Lin Chaotian would actually say such unbelievably domineering words.

In the entire Doomsday Battle, he cowered in the rear, not daring to rear his head at all.

But now, he was actually taking the initiative to provoke Tian Qing.

Furthermore, the present Tian Qing was not the Tian Qing before anymore.

He already became a Dao Ancestor!

Everything came so suddenly.

Two new Dao Ancestors were just born, and they were actually standing ready to cross swords.

But many people present also saw it clearly, these two people’s victory or defeat would likely determine the arrangement of humanity and divine, two races, in the future!

The divine race’s strongest versus the human race’s strongest!

Even Tian Qing also did not think that Lin Chaotian would be so arrogant. He could not help laughing from extreme fury and said, “Very good. This ancestor also wants to take a look at how much ability the new Dao Ancestor Firespirit has!”

Heavenly Dao True Martial, Myriad Dao Annihilation!

Boom!

It was only to see Tian Qing threw a punch out ordinarily, carrying a biting cold fist wind, heading straight for Lin Chaotian.

Myriad Dao Annihilation, this was the divine race’s most terrifying Heavenly Dao True Martial and not one of!

One punch shattering myriad laws!

Under this punch, Tian Qing was able to borrow the power of Heavenly Dao, and make all Dao laws return to tranquility!

You could only take a beating!

Moreover, this punch of his even fused the destruction rule that he just acquired.

With this move, Tian Qing already unleashed 70% of his strength. It was unbelievably terrifying.

His high regard for Lin Chaotian could also be seen.

“Heh,?Myriad Dao Annihilation! Back then, this move made Shang Hang that guy suffer many hardships! However … this ancestor isn’t a mediocre person like Shang Hang!”

Lin Chaotian gave a cold laugh. Wood and fire, two kinds of power of rule, suddenly erupted from his body.

Heaven Wielding Golden Crow! Myriad Fire Consecration!

Only to see him hold his palm out, a large golden bird suddenly flew up.

The moment this golden crow appeared, everyone’s breathing became ragged.

They felt like they were about to melt!

This kind of means was really more than ten times stronger compared to the Ancestor Fire back then!

Even Tian Qing’s expression changed abruptly too.

His Myriad Dao Annihilation was actually unable to slaughter this large golden crow!

Boom!

The two people’s peak collision reduced space to fragments.

Many powerhouses, some powerhouses who were in the distance, were actually directly annihilated by this terrifying power!

They had already gone far enough but still did not evade this fallout.

Everyone’s complexion turned deathly pale, looking at this scene with incredible shock.

Above the void, Lin Chaotian and Tian Qing each fell back several tens of thousands of feet. They were actually evenly matched in strength!

Tian Qing’s pupils constricted. He did not expect that the Lin Chaotian who became Dao Ancestor Firespirit was actually strong to such an extent.

He already became a Dao Ancestor and was actually unable to take him down!

“This … This is also too strong, right? What a move! Heaven Wielding Golden Crow! He’s the god of flames!”

“Wood and fire in perfect harmony, it’s truly boundlessly terrifying! Even Tian Qing actually can’t do anything to him!”

“This power is practically going to smash the sky already! I’m afraid that they are not far from Heavenly Dao anymore!”

Shocked voices lingered on incessantly.

The impact that the scene before their eyes brought to them, was seriously too strong.

Previously, when Lin Chaotian was arrogant, they still held much disdain in their hearts.

After all, Tian Qing’s might had long been deeply rooted in people’s hearts.

But no one expected that Lin Chaotian was actually so strong!

“Hahaha?… How is it, Tian Qing? I, this Dao Ancestor Firespirit, can still enter your sights, right?” Lin Chaotian looked at Tian Qing and said with a loud laugh.

He had never felt so good before.

Only a short while ago, the divine race was like a large mountain, pressing on his heart.

But now, he could already stand up to Tian Qing as an equal!

Furthermore, it was even under the situation where Tian Qing became a Dao Ancestor!

He was already the well-deserved humanity’s number one person!

Tian Qing’s gaze turned slightly dark, and he said, “Very good! That’s right! You have the qualification to be on equal footing with this ancestor!”

These words were tantamount to acknowledging Lin Chaotian’s status.

Lin Chaotian laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “All of you, listen up! From now on, everyone of the human race, all will heed my orders! Whoever dares to disobey me will die!”
