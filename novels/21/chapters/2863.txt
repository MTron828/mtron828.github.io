Chapter 2869 Victory Report! Blood Race Trembles! Hegemons Raising Eyebrows!

The current Bloodpromise lost his soul and was quaking in his boots!

“Quick! Quickly stop Feng Xiaotian!” Bloodpromise shouted at the top of his voice.

Hence, another three Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses immediately came up to surround and block Feng Xiaotian.

But, in the grand array, how could they be Feng Xiaotian’s match?

After a few rounds, three people were killed by Feng Xiaotian!

Bloodpromise took this chance and pushed through the city protecting grand array and fled for his life crazily. “Blood race bastards, watch your Grandpa Qing’s spear! Come on! Bring it! Aren’t you all very impressive?”

In the army, Yang Qing’s long spear killed until the blood race did not have the slightest strength to fight back.

Under Emperor Realm, they were not opponents that could last one exchange with him!

Big Yellow, Xiao Qing, and Jingfei were also killing the enemy frenziedly.

Ye Yuan joined the battle too, collecting the blood essence of the blood race.

Such a fine opportunity, Ye Yuan naturally would not let it go.

This battle fought until heaven and earth dimmed, blood flowing like rivers!

Bloodpromise was killed several times, but he revived each time.

But even so, he suffered huge losses this time too, and it would be difficult to recover again within a short time.

The 100 thousand strong blood race army had less than 1000 people who escaped!

“Heaven One is mighty!”

“City Lord is mighty!”

... ...

The shouting was akin to a huge wave, shocking heaven and earth.

This was an unprecedented great victory, a great victory that was to one’s heart’s content! However, not long ago, they were still in despair!

This great reversal was really satisfying until their souls left their bodies!

“100 thousand troops completely annihilated! That’s an army of 100 thousand! I feel like I’m dreaming until now! Ouch, what did you hit me for?”

“Too satisfying! Really too awesome! City Lord Feng is truly a celestial deity that descended to the mortal world!”

“It’s been a few thousand years, right? In 108 cities, Heaven One Alliance had countless casualties! But we have never experienced before such a great victory with accomplishments that surpasses ancient and modern times! We ... We won!”

Talking until the back, many people burst out crying

Heavenly Stratum powerhouses all had strong state of minds.

The scene of tens of thousands of people weeping was simply unimaginable. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone cast fervent gazes toward Feng Xiaotian.

Feng Xiaotian stood proudly in the firmament, overlooking all life as he raised his fist, his voice trembling slightly as he said, “W-We won!”

“Won!”

“Won!”

“Won!”

Everyone raised their hands and shouted!

Feng Xiaotian made a hand gesture as he said agitatedly, “Brothers, you all are mistaken! The one who created this miracle isn’t me, Feng Xiaotian, but him!”

His hand pointed at Ye Yuan in the crowd.

All of a sudden, tens of thousands of gazes focused on Ye Yuan simultaneously with a whoosh.

Everyone was shocked!

A ... Saint Sovereign Heaven?

G-Got to be joking!

“I know that various brothers have doubts in your heart, but in this battle, Ye Yuan contributed the most!”

“The city protecting grand array really couldn’t be restored anymore! It was Ye Yuan who brought the long-lost Lesser Origin Restoration Art that let the grand array be completely restored!”

“Ye Yuan’s formation path attainments is transcendent! He alone completed 20% of the workload!”

“When the grand array was about to be repaired, it was also him who reminded this city lord to let this city lord draw the bow but not discharge the arrow, luring the enemy deep in!”

“Actually, Ye Yuan told me before that he doesn’t want this credit! But, I, Feng Xiaotian, can’t take his credit!”

“Without lying to everyone, even if I knew that the grand array could be repaired, I also never thought that there could be such an astonishing great victory!” “But, that moment when the grand array was repaired, I was stunned! The city protecting grand array actually directly recovered to 70% of its peak power!” “Therefore, this unprecedented great victory was all thanks to Ye Yuan!”

Feng Xiaotian voice echoed, his voice spreading throughout the entire South Qi Giant City.

Whoosh!

In an instant, countless voices erupted.

Heaven One army’s powerhouses were all shocked to the extreme.

A Saint Sovereign Heaven dictated the entire war situation?

Too crazy!

Too inconceivable!

But they knew that Feng Xiaotian would not lie!

His matter was absolutely true!

Where did this guy pop out from?

In their impression, only Hegemon Realms, only origin Emperor Sakra Heavens, only such existences could dictate the war.

But who could have thought that an ant-like Saint Sovereign Heaven actually made 100 thousand bloodkins lose their lives at South Qi Giant City?

A total of 100 thousand bloodkins!

In the past, it was not that South Qi Giant City had not fought with an army of 100 thousand bloodkins before.

But South Qi Giant City paid the price of more than 100 thousand powerhouses’ lives in order to repel the blood race!

This was even under the circumstances of having the city protecting grand array.

However, today, they annihilated the blood race’s 100 thousand strong army with virtually zero casualties!

“Master Ye is awesome!”

“Master Ye is mighty!”

......

The 60 thousand strong Heaven One army raised their hands and cheered again.

Their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan were full of gratitude, full of shock, and full of pride!

In his panic, Bloodpromise heard South Qi Giant City’s yells.

He could not help being taken aback. Who was Master Ye?

Facing this scene, Ye Yuan was quite helpless.

He really did not want to steal this limelight. Who knew that Feng Xiaotian this fellow was actually so forthright.

By the side, Yang Qing looked at Ye Yuan with envy. The limelight was snatched up by you alone again!

Are you all blind? Didn’t you see Sovereign Azuresky rampage in all directions?

Above the void, one black and one white figure stood proudly in the sky.

“Edgeless, you’re too weak! If not for me, we really might not have been able to breach South Qi Giant City! Hahaha ...” The black-robed man looked in the direction of the Absolute Heaven Barrier and laughed loudly without ceasing.

Edgeless was the Hegemon Realm who was closest to South Qi Giant City!

The reason why South Qi Giant City became a human world purgatory was that his strength was too weak. He was weak. The Absolute Heaven Barrier around him was not strong enough.

The gap was naturally the largest too.

The nine great giant cities were actually guarded by the nine weakest Hegemon Realms.

And Edgeless was the weakest among the nine people.

Like the Absolute Heaven Barrier that was guarded by Hegemon Cloudmount, the passageway that was left behind could at most only let ten thousand people pass through at the very most!

Even if the blood race had exceedingly formidable abilities, it would be difficult to open up a gap from his place too.

Therefore, the blood race virtually placed all of their energy on the nine great giant cities.

Among them, South Qi Giant City was the most important!

South Qi Giant City’s capture was near at hand. You Jin was naturally in a great mood and made digs at Edgeless. When the blood race sieged a city, there must be a Hegemon Realm to restrain.

Otherwise, if Edgeless made a move, no matter how many people it was, it could only be death too.

However, they already formed a tacit agreement between themselves long ago that they would not take the initiative to attack.

This was because the blood race could not gain any advantages in front of the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Edgeless’s expression was very ugly. He was burning with anxiety in his heart too.

He was naturally clear about South Qi Giant City’s situation.

He blamed himself!

If not for him, South Qi Giant City would not have fallen into enemy hands.

But he really did his best already. “Once South Qi Giant City opens, our blood race army will be able to enter the Absolute Heaven Barrier continuously in endless streams! At that time, the Absolute Heaven Barrier will exist only in name! The blood of all you Hegemon Realms will be ours sooner or later!”

“Edgeless, are you very anxious right now? Do you feel very desperate? Right, it’s this expression! Hahaha ...”

“Reproach yourself for your incompetence! The Absolute Heaven Barrier is merely a mantis trying to stop a cart!”

Hegemon You Jin mocked without restraint. He was full of joy in his heart.

Their blood race’s Hegemons held deep-seated hatred towards the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Now, seeing this situation, he was naturally happy.

Suddenly, a blood light flashed in front of him, a phantom appeared.

This person was precisely Bloodpromise who escaped with his life!

This was Bloodpromise’s message!

Hegemon You Jin smiled lightly and said, “Bloodpromise, you did well! This seat only asks you this. Has South Qi Giant City been slaughtered clean?”

Bloodpromise’s expression was like his mother had died. Kneeling down with a thud, he said with a quiver, “Lord You Jin, we ... we failed!”

“What! W-What did you say? Impossible! The city protecting grand array has already been destroyed. Even if 100 thousand pigs were sent in, it’s also impossible to fail, right? Bloodpromise, you’re courting death!”

Bloodpromise’s words were seemingly like a loud slap, slapping until Hegemon You Jin felt his head spin, his eyesight blurring.

Hence, he became incredibly furious.

When a Hegemon was enraged, heaven and earth would change colors!

On the other side, Hegemon Edgeless was similarly stupefied, his gaze full of astonishment.

This ... How was this possible?

Feng Xiaotian actually blocked it? But the army did not seem to have entered the Absolute Heaven Barrier for very long!

Bloodpromise quivered even harder, and he said, “I-It’s the city protecting grand array that had a problem! The city protecting grand array wasn’t damaged at all. Feng Xiaotian lured us into the grand array and instantly activated the grand array! South Qi’s city protecting grand array recovered to its peak power all at once! 0-Our army of 100 thousand ... has been virtually wiped out!” Talking until the end, Bloodpromise’s voice was already akin to an ant’s.

But Hegemon You Jin heard it all!

An army of 100 thousand bloodkins was completely annihilated!

Bang! The phantom in front of him directly exploded and dissipated without a trace.

You Jin’s fury could already immolate heaven and earth!

“Hahaha ... You Jin! I’m very weak. But our Heaven One is akin to having providential help! Army of 100 thousand completely annihilated! This time, you probably also can’t give an explanation after you return to the clan, right? Sorry about this. You most likely won’t be able to drink this seat’s blood!”

Edgeless’s laughter reverberated throughout the heavens.

Really satisfying! An army of 100 thousand bloodkins was completely annihilated!

When did our Heaven One achieve such a terrifying great victory before?

That was right. It was terrifying!

This victory sounded like it was simply a fantasy tale!

Too horrifying!

Killing 100 thousand bloodkins, what kind of concept was that?

The more furious You Jin was, the better he, Edgeless, felt.

These days, he had really been oppressed badly.

Thank you, South Qi Giant City! Thank you, Feng Xiaotian!

was

It was just that beyond the ridiculing, he was also very confused in his heart.

He was still aware of how much ability Feng Xiaotian had.

This punk had the chance to advance to Hegemon, but to talk about Formation Dao, he really did not have this ability.

Just who on earth was it? To actually do such a major thing that had the ability to rule the world?

......

“Hahaha ... What a stinking brat! The big gift that you gave Master is really too surprising! Really too satisfying!” Seeing the battle report that was sent over, Hegemon Cloudmount was extremely delighted

Below True Sovereign Heaven, all annihilated!

Emperor Cloud Heaven bloodkins, more than 2000 killed!

Emperor Vast Heaven bloodkins, more than 400 killed! Emperor Sakra Heaven bloodkins, 28 killed!

The battle report that came from South Qi Giant City simply set the world on fire.

Although he did not know what happened in South Qi Giant City, he knew that Ye Yuan must have done it!

Apart from him, there was no one else!

He knew that Ye Yuan went to South Qi Giant City. When he got the Extreme Medicine Sect’s message, he was still worried about Ye Yuan’s safety.

South Qi Giant City’s situation was very bad. He was very worried too.

Who knew that such a piece of astonishing good news was actually transmitted over!
