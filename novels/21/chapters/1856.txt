Chapter 1860: Xu Xing

“This ... Uncle Gu ...” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Shut up! Who’s your uncle, shameless thing! In the past, I saw that you still looked decent, but I didn’t expect that you were actually so shameless! I only agreed to let you and Qiuling come into contact. So when did I acknowledge your marriage? You recklessly cooked up a rumor in my Thousand Soar Mansion. Do you still have any respect for me, this city lord?”

Gu Tianque was boiling with rage and also filled with endless fear after the incident at the same time.

If Ye Yuan died at Ji Xun’s hands, the entire Thousand Soar Imperial Capital might have to suffer an apocalyptic calamity!

Fortunately, Ye Yuan was different from ordinary people and actually escaped with his life from under Ji Xun’s hands. This also greatly surprised him.

However, toward Zhuo Han who he still regarded as decent in the past, he was no longer satisfied no matter which angle he looked at him anymore.

Seeing Gu Tianque’s enraged appearance, Zhuo Han’s face was akin to dead ashes.

“Ji Xun, what are you still stoning for? Hurry up and bring this useless apprentice of yours and scram for me!” Gu Tianque said in a deep voice.

Ji Xun’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “Gu Tianque, you fell out with me for a kid still wet behind his ears. Is there really this need?”

Gu Tianque sneered and said, “Ye Yuan is my savior. Do you think I have this need or not?”

Ji Xun’s expression changed, looking at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly.

Following this, he nodded his head and said, “Fine, I got it. But today’s matter isn’t over! Kid, I hope that you don’t land in my hands! Han-er, let’s go!”

Finished saying, Ji Xun swept his sleeves grandly and took Zhuo Han away from Ye Yuan’s hands.

The moment Ji Xun left, Ye Yuan’s two eyes saw black, and then he fell to the ground.

Facing Ji Xun, this level of True God powerhouse, Ye Yuan did not dare to slack off in the slightest. At this time, he finally could not hold on anymore.

...

Ten day’s time passed in a blink. On this day, countless powerhouses gathered outside of Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.

The allure of an Empyrean inheritance was seriously too great.

Even if they knew that there was huge danger, there were also countless people who were willing to fly into the fire like moths.

And among these powerhouses, it was clearly the Thousand Soar Alliance’s strength that was the greatest.

A True God powerhouse said, “Brother Gu, the hour is almost reaching, let’s enter the mountain!”

Gu Tianque nodded and said, “Come on.”

“Hang on!” Right at this time, two figures descended from the sky.

When the group of True God powerhouses saw the arrivals, their faces could not help changing and they bowed in salute as he said, “We pay respects to Lord Ji Kang!”

The aura of that True God powerhouse in the front was astonishing, it was actually a peak True God Realm powerhouse.

It was only to see him nodded and said, “Such a grand event, my Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital naturally has to join in too. Xu Xing, why haven’t you paid respects to the various uncles?”

Behind Ji Kang, a handsome young man clasped his hands and said, “This lowly nephew, Xu Xing, pays respect to uncles.”

“So, you’re Xu Xing. Huhu, truly, heroes come from youngsters!”

“I have long heard that an extraordinary talent appeared in Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital, fused together three kinds of power of laws, his strength extremely formidable! Meeting today, indeed lives up to the reputation!”

The group of True God powerhouses actually took the initiative to flatter a Celestial Deity Realm junior. This also made the surrounding powerhouses all tongue-tied.

However, hearing them say so, these people were all incredibly shocked.

To geniuses, there were plenty who comprehended two, even three kinds of power of laws.

But, those able to fuse two kinds of power of laws were in the minority, let alone fusing three kinds of power of laws.

Those able to fuse three kinds of power of laws were undoubtedly all peerless geniuses that were one in ten thousand!

Xu Xing had a proud look, accepting the group of powerhouses’ compliments without misgivings.

Clearly, he had long gotten accustomed to this scene.

“Zhuo Han has long admired Brother Xu’s great name. Upon seeing today, it’s sufficient to have no regrets for three lifetimes!” Zhuo Han was unwilling to be left in the cold and went forward to flatter.

Xu Xing gave him a glance and said calmly, “So, you’re Zhuo Han. I’ve heard of you before. Beneath imperial capitals, your talent is first-rate.”

Zhuo Han was pleasantly surprised and said, “Brother Xu has actually heard of me before. Zhuo Han is really overwhelmed by flattery and honor!”

Xu Xing said coolly, “But I’ve heard before that among imperial capitals, there’s still a proud daughter of heaven Leng Qiuling, whose talent is above yours. I wonder who that is?”

Leng Qiuling did not expect that Xu Xing would call upon her and stepped forward rather unwillingly. Greeting with folded hands at the lower right side, she said, “This lowly one, Leng Qiuling, pays respect to Sir Xu.”

When Xu Xing saw Leng Qiuling, his eyes could not help lighting up. His face finally revealed a trace of a smile and said with a nod, “I really didn’t expect that Miss Leng actually has such unparalleled looks! Miss Leng, the journey of Heavenly Sun Mountain Range, you’re the host and have to take good care of me!”

Leng Qiuling’s brows furrowed and said, “Dare not. This trip, I still have to look to uncles for more support.”

The moment people with discerning eyes saw, they knew that this Xu Xing took fancy on Leng Qiuling.

Ji Kang was also smiling and not saying anything at one side. Xu Xing’s horizons were extremely high. The girls pursuing him in Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital were plentiful like carps moving down a stream, but he did not take fancy on anyone.

He did not expect that he found someone pleasing to the eye here.

By the side, when Zhuo Han saw this scene, he secretly gloated in others’ misfortune in his heart.

It was already impossible for him to obtain Leng Qiuling. But with Xu Xing charging out halfway now, he wanted to see what Ye Yuan had to compete with the other person!

To talk about this Xu Xing, he was indeed a peerless genius.

His age was similar to theirs, but he was already peak Sixth Firmament Celestial Deity.

More importantly, he even fused three kinds of power of laws, his combat power extremely strong!

Although Zhuo Han’s talent was extremely high, compared to him, he indeed paled considerably in comparison.

He indeed had the capital to be proud of.

Ji Kang smiled and said, “Huhu, you’re all outstanding talents among the young generation, your future accomplishments immeasurable. You should naturally get closer.”

With Ji Kang speaking, the others naturally nodded their heads and agreed.

People that came from great imperial capitals, they could not afford to provoke.

Just like this, a group of True God powerhouses suppressed their realms to Celestial Deity Realm and stepped into the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.

The moment Ye Yuan entered Heavenly Sun Mountain Range, a familiar feeling hit him head-on.

That feeling was as if ... he returned to the Immortal Grove World.

Previously, the Thousand Soar Alliance carried out a lockdown on the entire Heavenly Sun Mountain Range. But following their entry, other powerhouses also entered the Heavenly Sun Mountain Range one after another.

Currently, heads could be said to be swarming in Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.

“This array formation is very similar to the Four Symbols Family Clans’ grand array!” Ye Yuan and Dustless communicated.

Dustless nodded and said, “The Four Symbols Divine Beasts forming an array, the power is sufficient to eradicate a major realm powerhouse! Immortal Grove laid down a matchless grand array in the entire Heavenly Sun Mountain Range. Annihilating Empyrean powerhouses is akin to child’s play!”

Ye Yuan said, “With so many powerhouses entering, it’s likely that a single misstep and it will trigger the grand array!”

Dustless smiled and said, “These fools even thought that Immortal Grove would leave behind his Dao teachings for them. They are thinking too much!”

Ye Yuan could not help smiling when he heard that.

The party gradually went deep in. Suddenly, a series of screams came over.

A cluster of fire rose to the sky. More than a dozen powerhouses were instantly burned to ashes.

Ji Kang’s face changed and he cussed angrily, “This bunch of fools activated the Immortal Wind Heavenly Fire Array of the Four Symbols Grand Array! Once the heavenly fire is triggered, it vows to immolate everything! Everybody, quickly run!”
