Chapter 2420: Grand Ancestor Skyformation!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this time, a torrent of laws poured down from the top of the mountain. It was as if the Milky Way was hanging upside down. It was a grand sight to behold.

The Eight Void Mountain grand array that stretched for tens of millions of miles were all activated at this moment.

Such a vast power made everyone quake in fear.

Even Yue Feng, this kind of Deva Fifth Blight, was also eclipsed in front of such a powerful force.

“He reached the summit! He ... He really reached the top! That is the land of rules! How did he do it?”

Shock was written all over Yue Feng’s face. The impact that the scene of Ye Yuan reaching the summit gave him was seriously too shocking.

Rules, that was the ultimate that all Deva Realm martial artists pursued.

But in this epoch, for ten billion years, apart from the few great Dao Ancestors, nobody was able to comprehend rules at all.

Even if all of the Deva Realm powerhouses knew that the top of this Eight Void Mountain was the land of rules, no one had ever reached it before.

Once, Heavenly Emperor Heartless climbed to 70 thousand over miles and was also just a step away from the land of rules. But he did not manage to take that step in the end.

But today, someone actually reached the summit!

Furthermore, this person was merely just a Heavenly Emperor Realm martial artist.

The shock that this scene brought could be imagined.

The first person in ten billion years! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The ones who were shocked were naturally not just Yue Feng alone.

The powerhouses on Eight Void Mountain never thought that those who stayed on the mountain during such a time of chaos actually witnessed such a miracle.

“Could it be that this kid already comprehended the power of rules? But he’s just at the Heavenly Emperor Realm!”

“If he didn’t comprehend the power of rules, how did he reach the summit? It’s really contradictory!”

“Something that no one has done for ten billion years, he actually accomplished it! I simply somewhat doubt my eyes!”

... ...

All manner of exclamations were unable to describe the shock in their hearts.

The power of rules, that was the existence that dominated above all things.

It could be hoped for but not sought after!

Now, a Heavenly Emperor Realm martial artist actually reached such a realm. How could they not envy?

It was just that their shock was not over yet.

At this moment, it was only to hear Ye Yuan say coolly, “Come out!”

The nine ghostly fires suddenly gathered together and finally turned into an old man.

The moment this old man appeared, an illusory to the extreme Formation Dao power of rule instantly enveloped Eight Void Mountain Range.

Originally, Eight Void Mountain was just a dead place.

But his appearance made the entire Eight Void Mountain come to life all at once!

It was as if this place was born for him.

Even a fool could tell too.

This old man was none other than definitely Eight Void Mountain grand array’s master!

Everyone held their breaths, looking at the old man in shock.

This was a rule powerhouse!

“This old man, Lin Wushuang, pays respect to Lord Saint Azure!”

Amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, the old man actually prostrated down toward Ye Yuan!

It was prostrating!

A rule powerhouse actually prostrated in solemn respect to a Heavenly Emperor Realm powerhouse!

Furthermore, this level of supremacy tend to have their own resounding names.

But he referred to himself with his real name.

Eight Void Mountain’s powerhouses felt like their brains were not quite enough to use.

Everything that happened today was too bizarre and too shocking, virtually already exceeding their understanding.

They all thought that Ye Yuan might have obtained Grand Ancestor Skyformation’s legacy, that was how he could reach the summit.

But when Lin Wushuang appeared, they naturally thought that Ye Yuan should be prostrating toward Lin Wushuang, to thank him for his legacy.

However, the result was totally different.

At this time, Ye Yuan became an incomparably mysterious existence in everyone’s eyes.

Just what did he rely on?

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Wushuang. It was only to feel that he looked a little unfamiliar.

The time he stayed in the ancient period was too short, it was naturally impossible to know everyone.

Among that batch who stood out among the rest back then, there did not seem to be Lin Wushuang.

“Get up. You’ve seen me before?” Ye Yuan asked.

The time he stayed in Heavenly Hidden World was not long. Furthermore, the majority of the time was in closed-seclusion, he did not really go and guide these geniuses.

Lin Wushuang said, “This disciple was in the first batch to enter Heavenly Hidden World and had the honor of seeing Your Excellency’s graceful bearing. Although I wasn’t able to see your real face, the aura on Your Excellency’s body won’t be wrong. Furthermore ... this disciple is best friends with Qin Chao.”

Mentioning Qin Chao, Ye Yuan could not help looking downcast.

In the last epoch, the one who had accompanied him the longest was Qin Chao.

It was just a pity that he could not save Qin Chao.

Ye Yuan said, “You became a grand ancestor. Then Qin Chao ...”

Lin Wushuang said, “He could get the personal guidance of Lord Saint Azure, and so he naturally ascended to the position of a grand ancestor! It’s just a pity. He perished in the battle with the Profound Lineage’s progenitor, Yuan Yi, back then.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said with a sigh, “It’s just a shame that I couldn’t fight side by side together with you all back then.”

Lin Wushuang said, “Since ancient times, it’s been hard for things to be perfect. Lord Saint Azure’s contributions went down in history. There’s no need to blame yourself. Moreover, the burden on Lord Saint Azure’s shoulders is far heavier than ours. What Lord Saint Azure said back then, we still didn’t understand. Seeing Saint Azure again today, Wushuang understands everything. Your Excellency collecting this formation, I’m afraid that the divine race has staged a comeback again, right?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The divine race army has invaded our territory. The myriad races are powerless to resist. So I thought of this formation. Hand this formation over to me then!”

Lin Wushuang said respectfully, “This nine rule formation’s foundation is the essence of what I learned in my lifetime. It can evolve into thousands of grand arrays! Back then, I shed my heart blood to lay down this formation overnight, killing 8000 divine race powerhouses, but I also died because my heart blood was exhausted.

Ye Yuan sighed and said, “It was hard on you!”

Finished talking, Lin Wushuang tapped a finger on Ye Yuan’s glabella. Rays of brilliant light erupted.

The nine rule formation bases entered Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness one by one.

Ye Yuan just felt that a vast amount of information entered his sea of consciousness.

Although there were only nine formation bases, the Formation Dao rule contained inside could not be calculated using words at all.

When Eight Void Mountain’s powerhouses heard these two people’s conversation, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with amazement.

They could not understand many things, but they heard Lin Wushuang call himself a disciple.

A terrifying rule powerhouse of his generation actually professed himself a disciple to someone at the Heavenly Emperor Realm!

What the hell, was there anything more terrifying than this?

“Xiu Yun, do you know ... that young man? Just what is his origin?”

At this time, there were already Deva powerhouses who gathered over, inquiring about the situation from Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun.

Xiu Yun’s expression was ugly as he said, “He said he came from an imperial city in the Southern Border ...”

“I-Imperial City! Xiu Yun, are you joking with us?” How could anyone believe such words?

But Xiu Yun said, “He seemed to have made a very big name for himself in the Southern Border! I sent people to check before. He’s indeed from a remote imperial city. Furthermore, his rise was also just something that happened in the recent two to three thousand years. His speed of rising makes people speechless. The last time I saw him, he was merely at the Empyrean Realm. But now, he’s already a peak Heavenly Emperor! If my conjecture is right, he might very likely be the reincarnation of some old monster!”

“Reincarnation of an old monster? What kind of old monster could make a rule powerhouse call himself a disciple?”

Everyone was silent ...
