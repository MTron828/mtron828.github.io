Chapter 2006: Hundred Miles Incense

“Hahaha!”

After a moment of deathly silence, crazy laughter erupted from the army, shaking the surroundings.

A Third Firmament True God said that he was going to exterminate an army of more than 100 thousand by himself. This joke was really too hilarious.

“Kid, let’s not talk about us, these Ninth Firmament True God city lords. But even those Eighth Firmament True Gods can also pinch you to death with one hand! You actually boasted shamelessly, saying that you’re going to exterminate all of us by yourself?” A Ninth Firmament True God City Lord convulsed with laughter.

“Kid, we’ll watch right here, watch how you exterminate all of us!”

“We’re so scared! You look at me, my legs are scared until they are trembling!”

“Hahaha!”

Another wave of loud laughter could be heard.

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with an amused expression. It was as if looking at a fool.

Before coming here, everyone thought that Ye Yuan was an exceptionally talented person. They did not expect that he was such a fool.

This made the originally somewhat nervous atmosphere suddenly ease up.

After all, this kid provided for them quite a bit of laughter on his deathbed.

However, there was also someone who did not laugh.

In the army, Yu Wenfeng’s expression was very ugly.

He also did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually face the entire army alone by himself.

Even though he also felt that Ye Yuan’s words were very funny, his understanding of Ye Yuan was much deeper than the others.

For a person to be able to say this kind of words, if he was not a genuine fool, then he really had something to rely on.

Yu Wenfeng knew that when Ye Yuan wiped out the Deathsoul Gate branch that time, he acted after planning it out, advancing gradually and entrenching himself at every step. In the end, not even a mosquito was let out.

How could such a person possibly be a fool?

That indicated that Ye Yuan really had a trump card!

But he could not figure out even after racking his brain just what Ye Yuan’s trump card was.

Ye Yuan let out a slight sigh and said, “Looks like my persuasion doesn’t have much use. I originally didn’t want to commit unnecessary slaughter, but since you guys are seeking death yourselves, then it can’t be blamed on me.”

A Ninth Firmament True God used eyes like looking at a fool to look at Ye Yuan and said, “I really don’t know what for Lord Lu Yan dispatched such a massive force. An idiot like you, randomly sending a few powerhouses over and you’d be eradicated. Kid, this city lord will be sending you to hell right away, to avoid you making a spectacle of yourself here.”

Done talking, that person’s body released a horrifying power, crushing over toward Ye Yuan.

But at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure also became blurry.

Bang!

This move slammed right onto space.

That powerhouse’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in shock, “Spatial shift! No wonder this kid is so arrogant, but ... is this your reliance? Everybody attack together; trample Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!”

Rumble!

The commotion was overwhelming. The Five Firmament army advanced toward Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, shaking heaven and earth.

But right at this time, light rain suddenly drizzled down from the sky in a continuous stream.

“Eh? Why did it suddenly rain?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“This rain is so strange. Why is it green?”

“Smells good ... This rain actually has an alcohol aroma!”

...

The blue skies that originally spanned for ten thousand miles suddenly rained at this time. Furthermore, this rain was different from ordinary rain. It was actually glossy and green, and it was even accompanied by a slight alcohol aroma, making people intoxicated.

This strange sight made everyone stop, all being extremely curious.

Those few Ninth Firmament True God powerhouses leading were also curious at first.

But very soon, they discovered something wrong.

“Hang on! There’s something ... wrong with this rain!”

Everyone’s faces suddenly changed, but it was already too late!

“Puhwark!”

A Celestial Deity Realm martial artist suddenly spurted blood wildly, bleeding with seven orifices, then plummeted down to the ground powerlessly.

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

...

Following that, one tragic scream after another came over. People were falling toward the ground one after another.

The sky was still drizzling rain, and now it was also raining corpses.

Miserable wails echoed together. This area under the sky instantly became purgatory.

In the crowd, the moment Yu Wenfeng laid eyes on this green rain, his expression suddenly changed, his scalp tingling.

A feeling of extreme danger instantly welled up in his heart.

He virtually did not hesitate in the slightest, using the fastest speed to rush over toward Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

However, it was already too late.

In this stretch of space, the green rain was everywhere, entering from every pore, nowhere to hide.

His body was already contaminated by raindrops.

But he did not give up, using all the strength in his body and speeding over toward Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

“Little Brother Ye, s-save me!” Yu Wenfeng screamed madly.

He already felt that his divine essence was starting to become stagnant, the terrifying poison was currently flowing everywhere in his body along with his blood.

Even if he forcefully used divine essence to force it back, it did not have any effect at all as well.

This situation frightened him until he was scared out of his wits.

Suddenly, a light flashed. Yu Wenfeng felt himself being wrapped away by a spatial force.

His heart eased up, suddenly feeling incomparably glad about his decision before.

But the others were not so lucky.

Those Celestial Deity Realm martial artists could not endure more than a while, directly croaking one after another.

Luckily, the range of this rain was not large. Many Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses did not rush within the boundary of that green rain yet.

When those people behind saw those struggling figures in front, each and every one of their eyes went wide.

True God Realm martial artists had thick divine essence. The time that they persisted was a little longer.

But it was also just a little longer.

First Firmament and Second Firmament True God martial artists started kicking the bucket.

“Ahh, ahh, ahh! Save me! I don’t want to die!”

“Lu Yan, you’ve doomed us!”

“Lord Ye Yuan, we were wrong! I beg you, save me!”

...

In the air, miserable wails echoed together.

Those late-stage True God powerhouses all had ghastly pale faces. Their strength was powerful, forcefully suppressing the poison.

Except, that poison was akin to a desolate beast, wreaking havoc within their bodies, and actually had signs of losing control.

A Ninth Firmament True God city lord said in agony, “R-Really a mistake this time! Just what kind of existence is this Ye Yuan?”

“What poison is this? It’s actually so strong? I ... I almost can’t suppress it anymore!”

“This Ye Yuan simply has abilities that even gods and ghosts cannot fathom! When gods fight, small ... small imps like us suffer!”

These Ninth Firmament True God were all incomparably anguished. Right now, their intestines were green with regret.

Only then did they understand what Ye Yuan’s warning previously meant.

He was really giving them a lease on life!

But they did not believe it at all, and they took it as a joke.

Only now did they know that turns out, they were the joke!

It was just that, who could have predicted such means?

Ye Yuan actually hid the poison in the void and made everyone get poisoned with this kind of indiscriminate method.

His means were simply inconceivable!

...

Feeling the poison in his body gradually dissipating, Yu Wenfeng had the joy of surviving a calamity.

His complexion was deathly pale, using an extremely awe-stricken gaze to look at Ye Yuan.

“M-Master Ye, just ... just what poison is this? Even Ninth Firmament True Gods can’t withstand it either!” Yu Wenfeng said with lingering fear in his heart.

Ye Yuan looked at Yu Wenfeng and lightly spat three words out of his mouth, “Hundred ... Miles ... Incense!”
