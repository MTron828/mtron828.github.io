1787 Who“s Saving Whom?

In the darkness, a black figure dashed over swiftly, catching up to the two in a blink of an eye.

Baili Qingyan knew that she could not escape and could only turn around and deal with it.

“You quickly run! I’ll deal with him!” Baili Qingyan barked charmingly.

Ye Yuan did not escape but looked at Baili Qingyan in surprise.

This lass was actually going to sacrifice herself to save others?

At this time, with Baili Qingyan’s hatred toward him, shouldn’t it be leaving him behind to feed the tiger’s mouth, and then escape by herself?

Baili Qingyan’s strength was powerful. Sword Dao laws crisscrossed wantonly within the cave.

But, facing the powerful Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast, she was still more than a magnitude weaker.

Under the powerful impact of the fierce beast, Baili Qingyan’s orderly style was thrown into chaos very quickly.

Suddenly, the Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast’s third eye suddenly lit up, emitting a ray of terrifying beam.

Baili Qingyan’s expression changed, it was already too late to want to avoid it.

That guy should have already escaped, right? There must be something wrong with my head, why would I abandon myself to save him? This was the final thought in Baili Qingyan’s mind before becoming unconscious.

Bang!

That beam of light directly struck Baili Qingyan. Baili Qingyan’s body flew out backward, falling heavily to the ground, unconscious to the world.

“Roar!”

Defeating Baili Qingyan, the Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast emitted a heaven-shaking roar once more. It was as if declaring its might.

He walked over toward Ye Yuan step by step. The powerful aura was virtually crushing Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan completely ignored him, slowly walked to Baili Qingyan’s side, picked her up, and walked over toward outside the cave.

“Roar, roar!”

The Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast was clearly enraged by Ye Yuan. This tiny human actually did not pay attention to him!

He raised his giant claw and smacked down toward Ye Yuan.

In his view, this claw going down, Ye Yuan would definitely be smacked into a paste.

But right at this time, a terrifying aura came out of Ye Yuan’s body.

This aura, even he felt a chill.

Bang!

The Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast was directly blasted flying.

...

Baili Qingyan slowly opened both eyes, everything in front of her became clear.

“I ... I’m not dead yet?”

Baili Qingyan looked around, there was no one, and also no shadow of the Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast.

“Who saved me? Could it be that ... the Shadowmoon Sect’s powerhouse just happened to pass by here? Eh ... My injuries are all healed?” Baili Qingyan was full of doubts.

She clearly remembered that she was severely struck by the Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast, her injuries very serious.

But now, not only was she saved, her injuries even recovered.

“Of course it was me who saved you! You wouldn’t naively think that some savior will appear, right?”

A voice rang out. Ye Yuan’s figure walked out of the cave not far away.

Baili Qingyan was slightly stunned. This guy actually did not run away?

Or was it that after running away, he came back again?

Of course, regarding Ye Yuan’s narrative, she would not believe even if beaten to death.

“With just you? The Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast can shred you with one claw, you still want to save me from under his hands?” Baili Qingyan said disdainfully.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Otherwise, who else do you think can save you?”

Baili Qingyan smiled coldly and said, “Of course it’s the Shadowmoon Sect’s powerhouse! You take the credit of others, it’s in hopes of moving me, then getting into my good graces, right? You’re thinking too much!”

Ye Yuan was speechless when he heard that. Please, it was you who was thinking too much, okay?

But since Baili Qingyan thought so, he could not be bothered to explain either, and casually threw a few fruits in front of Baili Qingyan.

Baili Qingyan’s expression changed and she said, “These ... These are Jade Citron Fruits?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “To be able to have the Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast protect it, it’s naturally good stuff. We are teammates, these few are yours, don’t say that I don’t share profits.”

Baili Qingyan looked at Ye Yuan and could not help getting a big shock as she said, “You ... You broke through?”

She discovered to her amazement that Ye Yuan’s aura became much stronger. He actually broke through to Sixth Firmament Divine Lord in one stroke while she was unconscious. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Yuan’s realm had long already reached peak Fifth Firmament Divine Lord.

Finding these Jade Citron Fruits at this time, breaking through was naturally something within expectations.

It was just that in Baili Qingyan’s view, this breakthrough was also a little too casual.

Even if one obtained the Jade Citron Fruit, they also could not immediately turn it into strength.

Jade Citron Fruits contained immense spiritual energy. It was even stronger than the medicinal effects of some medicinal pills.

If consumed too many, the martial artist would not be able to digest it at all.

Even if one was about to break through, they also had to go into closed-seclusion patiently to slowly refine, before it could convert into strength.

But it shouldn’t have been too long from when she went into a coma until now, right?

This ... Broke through like this?

How could she know that after Ye Yuan obtained the Jade Citron Fruits, he directly ate them like fruits?

With the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s overbearingness, it was naturally all refined, converging into the divine vortex.

“You refine the Jade Citron Fruits first. This way, you should be able to break through to the peak Ninth Firmament Divine Lord Realm,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Baili Qingyan felt that it was a little too dramatic. Encountering the Three-Eyed Jade Bristlebeast, she even thought that she was dead for sure.

Who knew that in a twinkle, not only did she not die, her strength could even go up a level.

Baili Qingyan collected her emotions and started refining the Jade Citron Fruits.

After several days, Baili Qingyan slowly opened both eyes, her gaze revealing excitement.

Refining a Jade Citron Fruit, her strength already broke through to peak Ninth Firmament Divine Lord.

Confronting Zhong Hanlin again at this time, Baili Qingyan had absolute confidence in defeating the other party.

“Tsk tsk, indeed well-deserving of being a proud daughter of heaven. Your effects of refining the Jade Citron Fruit is even better than I imagined,” Ye Yuan praised.

Baili Qingyan’s talent could virtually rival Leng Qiuling’s already.

In this void realm, she was absolutely a first-rate genius.

Even Zhong Hanlin they all were unable to be mentioned in the same breath as Baili Qingyan too.

After all, their ages were much older than Baili Qingyan.

Baili Qingyan had a proud look and said coolly, “That’s of course! The Bamboo Groove Holy Temple’s slot, I must obtain it!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then when the time comes, we’ll become opponents.”

Baili Qingyan looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly and said, “You want to take part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave too? Stop joking, you wouldn’t think that you’re invincible under the heavens after you broke through becoming a Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled and shook his head as he said, “Are you all, these geniuses, always so condescending? There’s still more than 200 years’ time away from the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave. Who will emerge victorious is still unknown!”

But Baili Qingyan said very calmly, “Over 200 years, to people like you, you can at most promote to become a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord. Even if you’re exceptionally talented, there’s also not a trace of hope of breaking through to half-step Celestial Deity.”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “It’s useless to say more for now. Let’s wait and see.”

Baili Qingyan also considered herself to be important and did not argue. Instead, she asked, “There’s already not much of the one month’s time left. The heavenly demon crystals in our hands are not considered many. It’s a little troublesome now.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You don’t need to worry about this. Someone will come and deliver heavenly demon crystals to us.”
