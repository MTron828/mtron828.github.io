Chapter 3065: All the People Advances!

“Open for me!”

Kong Tan turned into a true fiend, his imposing momentum already rising to peak Emperor Sakra Heaven!

It was only to see him throw a punch out. The third seal trembled, but it did not immediately break.

Without the slightest hesitation, Kong Tan threw out his second punch!

Third punch, fourth punch …

Kong Tan’s true fiend body was formidable to the extreme.

The third seal became increasingly looser under his punches.

Boom!

When Kong Tan threw the 19th punch, the third seal broke at the sound of it!

Whoosh!

The thick origin power seemed like floodwaters that broke the dam, pouring down and filling Kong Tan’s true fiend body!

Kong Tan felt invigorated to the extreme at this time.

He let out a loud laugh and said,?“Hahaha?… Yang Qing, Ye Yuan, it’s ultimately me who took this step first! This seat is the number one genius in all the heavens!”

......

His voice reverberated throughout the heavens. It was clearly audible in the entire Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Everyone was searching for Ye Yuan and Yang Qing’s figures in the crowd but could not find them.

“Heh,?it looks like the two of them don’t dare to show themselves anymore!”

“Truly, change is the only constant. The wheel of fortune turns! Nobody could have expected that Kong Tan actually made a comeback at the final moment! It looks like he’s the true son of destiny!”

“The winner is decided! It looks like Kong Tan will be the next Hegemon Heavenless!”

… …

Visualizing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, someone breaking through to Hegemon Realm was within reason.

But no one expected that Kong Tan’s breakthrough was so fast!

In the trials previously, Kong Tan, this son of the fiend race, was suppressed firmly by Ye Yuan and Yang Qing.

But now, he finally turned things around!

With regards to this sudden turn of events, Hegemon Endless and the rest did not show any visible changes in emotions.

They were currently visualizing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings with all their hearts!

They had all visualized the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings before.

But at that time, Heavenless treasured his own belongings and did not let them visualize all of them.

Especially the Heaven scroll, Heavenless never took it out before.

But this time, the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings were gathered. The power was unimaginable!

Having just visualized for half a day, they all, these Hegemon Realms, had already faintly understood some of it.

One had to know that their cultivation realms had long already reached the limit. They might not be able to make progress for hundreds of thousands of years.

The 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings were the only channel for them to become stronger!

At this time, the entire Labyrinth Divine Palace was a harmonious sight. Everyone was visualizing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings.

Whatever treasures, whatever scheming against each other, nobody paid attention to all that.

However, it was not just Kong Tan alone who was impressive.

Three days later, Feng Qingxuan started undergoing nirvanic rebirth!

Yes, under the circumstances where she did not get injured, she directly started to undergo nirvanic rebirth.

However, her nirvanic rebirth time was very long, many people had already broken through their cultivation realms, but she did not budge an inch.

Under Kong Tan and Feng Qingxuan, the various races’ geniuses also broke through the fetters one after another.

Those top geniuses broke through to Hegemon Realm in succession!

In front of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, it was a banquet of Hegemon breakthroughs!

Qin Baichuan, Wang Ningyan, and Zhou Xianchen, these people also all broke through to Hegemon Realm one after another.

Even people who were lacking in talent, after visualizing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, their strength also advanced by leaps and bounds.

Only Ye Yuan and Yang Qing two people were still observing everything from the perspective of God.

“Eh,?she came too!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Yuan discovered a familiar figure in the crowd. It was the Nirvanic Soul Clan’s Cloudneon.

The soul race was very low-profile this time. Ye Yuan was also not familiar with the people who came, so he did not say hello to them.

He did not expect that Cloudneon was actually hiding among them.

Cloudneon’s talent was only stronger and not weaker when compared to Feng Qingxuan.

Facing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, she naturally gained quite the knowledge.

Ye Yuan could perceive that her soul force was currently strengthening. She was already not far away from Supreme Hegemon!

This woman was really formidable!

Just how long had it been since she broke through to Hegemon Realm? She was going to break through to Supreme Hegemon already?

“Ye Yuan, could it be that we were both wrong? That Ancestor Heavenless is really doing it for the sake of all the heavens and myriad races?” Yang Qing could not resist asking.

Although the Labyrinth Divine Palace trip this time had many geniuses who fell, the progress made was even more!

Especially the appearance of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings, it made many geniuses transform, becoming leviathans of a region.

This made Yang Qing unable to refrain from somewhat doubting Heavenless’ goal.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know, but I feel that it’s not that simple! Furthermore, I feel like the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s matter isn’t over yet!”

Yang Qing said with confusion, “Even Great Beyond powerhouses have come out. How is it not over yet? Could it be that there are even stronger existences? That’s impossible! Although the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings are imitations, the power is really strong! No one will be able to resist being moved!”

Ye Yuan said, “With the Labyrinth Divine Palace reappearing, all the heavens are astir! Such a major matter, it’s impossible for the blood race and Hegemon Samsara to not know at all, right? 12 Hegemon Paintings, aren’t they moved by it?”

Yang Qing said indifferently, “This place is Ancestor Heavenless’ lair. Do they dare to come? You, this fellow, you’re oversuspicious! Speaking of which, you’ve visualized for so long. Do you have any breakthroughs? Heh heh, I’ve already comprehended Spear Dao origin and destruction origin!”

Two years had already passed. With Yang Qing’s talent, he naturally benefited greatly under the Heaven scroll.

Even Kong Tan could break through to Hegemon. So how could he, Yang Qing, be weak?

Of course, Yang Qing did not have Kong Tan in his eyes at all. There was only Ye Yuan!

Comprehending two powers of origin at the same time, Yang Qing could be rated as a prodigy. So he could not resist showing off to Ye Yuan.

“Is that so? Congratulations to you!” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly.

“This fellow, is it that you didn’t comprehend anything??Heh heh,?this emperor knew that you’re still that tiny bit lousier than me!” Yang Qing said smugly.

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said, “My Dao sword should be able to kill origin powerhouses now.?Uh?… not the kind like you.”

Yang Qing’s expression turned stiff.?Uh,?of course, his expression could not be seen right now.

Origin powerhouse, under normal circumstances, it referred to above grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven!

Those such as Yang Qing who comprehended origin at lower Emperor Sakra Heaven were in the minority after all.

With the Labyrinth Divine Palace opening up this time, geniuses from all heavens gathered. That was why it seemed like there were a lot.

But actually, top geniuses like this would not exceed five fingers in one plane!

With you as the exception, it was naturally referring to grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven origin powerhouses.

Yang Qing stopped talking.

He did not know what he should say.

Posturing, he got slapped in the face again!

Yang Qing was very strong. He could be said to be the number one genius in all the heavens!

But, although he comprehended origin now, when facing off against origin powerhouses, he would still fall far short.

After all, his cultivation realm was placed there.

But Ye Yuan was just middle Emperor Vast Heaven. This guy’s Dao sword was already powerful to such an extent?

Didn’t that mean that as long as Ye Yuan was willing, he could cross a major cultivation realm and kill an origin powerhouse at the expense of being seriously injured?

This … was too terrifying!

Of course, Ye Yuan’s Dao sword only had the power of one strike.

But even so, it was much stronger than him comprehending two origins at the same time!

“Do you still want people to live or not?” Yang Qing was like a deflated leather ball and had no more temper.

“I don’t want to posture. So why do you have to force me every time?” Ye Yuan said helplessly.
