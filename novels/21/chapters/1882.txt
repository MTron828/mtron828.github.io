Chapter 1886: The Reason for My Existence!

“Damn it! Kunwu Divine Wood!”

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s face changed swiftly, being put at a loss on what to do by this sudden turn of events.

He recognized straight away that these vines were an extremely rare plant-type demon from the Heavenspan World, Kunwu Divine Wood!

Kunwu Divine Wood’s offensive strength was not strong, but the degree of its toughness absolutely gave people a headache.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The True Fiend Dharma Idol was too strong. Even the Kunwu Divine Wood found it hard to stop its advancement too.

Instantaneously, cracks started appearing on those green vines, then it broke free.

But what Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove wanted was this instant!

“Go and die!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s eyes revealed a vicious look, all of his fury unleashing completely at this moment.

A large hole was directly torn open in the entire space. Boundless spatial turbulent flow poured in, tearing this large hole bigger and bigger.

Bang!

With just the finger pointing, the True Fiend Dharma Idol was akin to suffering a heavy strike, immediately turning to ashes.

The entire Immortal Grove World was trembling. Space was torn once more until it disintegrated and was already on the verge of destruction.

When the group of powerhouses saw this scene, each and every one turned pale.

One should not look at how they were all Empyreans and True Gods. A battle of Heavenly Emperor-level, they had never experienced it before.

The shock that this horrifying energy undulation in front of them brought to them was too intense.

“Is this the power of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses? Too terrifying!”

“Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove has already died for five million years and he can actually still unleash such an earth-shaking attack, truly terrifying!”

“If Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove didn’t die, he’d definitely have already entered the ranks of Heavenly Emperors, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang might not be a match too!”

...

These people all knew that Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang seized a Heavenly Emperor Dao Fruit before he could corroborate his Dao and become a Heavenly Emperor.

But Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove relied on his own strength. He exuded such a horrifying energy.

With a comparison, whoever was superior was immediately determined.

“Heh, space already shattered, the Immortal Grove World is about to be destroyed right away, Ye Yuan is dead for sure, right?” What Xu Xing was most concerned about was Ye Yuan instead.

Zhao Min laughed coldly and said, “If it’s really him maintaining the Immortal Grove World, then he’s probably already turned to dust now! Heh, reckless and blind thing, serves him right to die!”

Xu Xing smiled and said, “Right now, the people who entered Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace, apart from those who are already dead, they are virtually all here, only missing Ye Yuan! I think that the one supporting the Immortal Grove World is most likely him! Haha, this damn fellow is finally dead!”

One had to admit, Xu Xing was still very smart.

His analysis was practically exactly the same as the truth.

But right at this time, the fragmentation of space suddenly stopped.

That spatial black hole that was torn open by Heavenly Emperor-level power was currently recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Everyone’s pupils constricted, looking at this scene in disbelief.

“What’s going on here? The Immortal Grove World is actually currently being repaired!”

“The power of two great Heavenly Emperors is currently erupting crazily. At this time, the shattering of space actually didn’t accelerate, but is being restored instead, how is this possible?”

“Could it be ... Ye Yuan?” Du Hong suddenly said.

Death-like silence, this scene was too unthinkable.

What erupted before their eyes was an apocalyptic power.

However, those spatial cracks were actually recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

This kind of immense contrast gave them a fierce misconception.

Bang!

The Heaven Sundering Finger eradicated the True Fiend Dharma Idol. However, its residual power did not disappear, abruptly landing on Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang.

On Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s hands, heavenly emperor spirit treasures lit up once more, Fiendish energy gushed out frenziedly, using all of its power to resist this blow,

However, this attack was too strong!

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s figure was immediately blasted flying out.

Intense energy undulations immediately burst out, spreading throughout the entire Immortal Grove World.

“Giant mountain suppressing the world, unmoving like a mountain!” A voice that reverberated throughout the sky emitted out of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

In the sky, a massive mountain emerged, drawing everyone’s attention.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s eyes revealed a dumbfounded look, looking at that young figure above the void.

“That ... That’s the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain! This ... This kid actually already refined the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain! He drew on the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain to suppress the Immortal Grove World! How ... How did he do it?”

While talking, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove drew a cold breath.

As the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s owner, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove naturally knew about the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

Although at this time, that virtual image in the sky was very blurry, unable to make out the shadow of the Heavenspan Mountain at all, he, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, was extremely sure that that was the Heavenspan Mountain.

Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!

The current Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, his figure became much more illusory.

Clearly, that horrifying attack just now already consumed the last of his energy.

Furthermore, his figure was currently fading away rapidly and was disappearing very soon.

The last of his soul force was already thoroughly drained.

Looking at the Ye Yuan in the sky, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s gaze gradually turned soft.

With the ... light of being enlightened greatly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Hahahaha!”

Suddenly, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laughed wildly without ceasing.

The current Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace was already completely wrecked.

The entire Godsfall Mountain Range was also already leveled to the ground.

This place that made countless powerhouses of the Immortal Grove World perish disappeared in the end.

A figure suddenly appeared beside Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove. It was just that this figure appeared extremely feeble.

Suddenly, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s laughter abruptly cut off. But he did not turn around, saying lightly, “Kunwu, on my deathbed, I finally understand!”

This figure beside Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was none other than precisely the Kunwu Divine Wood who had already disappeared!

Kunwu did not speak. He was currently extremely weak.

Entangling the True Fiend Dharma Idol, even if it was just that short while, already made his soul nearly disintegrate.

Facing a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, he was still too weak.

However, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove did not have the intention of letting him speak. He was saying for Kunwu to hear and also saying for himself to hear.

“I, Immortal Grove, achieved Divine Lord in 300 years, Celestial Deity in 800 years, True God in 3000 years, Heavenly Empyrean in 50 thousand years, and only used a million years to cultivate to peak Empyrean! I’ve always thought that I, Immortal Grove, am the person chosen by Heavenly Dao! In the future, I’ll definitely reach the apex, achieving Transcendent Heavenly Emperor, even becoming that tenth Dao Ancestor!”

“But, I never dreamed that I would actually die at Jiu Shang’s hands! I’m unwilling! I want revenge! I’m the person chosen by Heavenly Dao, how can I die? So, I laid down this heaven-shocking scheme, drawing Jiu Shang over. I want to make him pay the price, I want to make him die!”

“But, only all the way until this moment, do I understand that turns out, all this was merely my one-sided wishful thinking! The person chosen by Heavenly Dao isn’t me at all!”

“This empyrean broke through to Divine Lord, creating the Immortal Grove World! The Immortal Grove World gradually developed, having myriad realms, having the Divine Realm, having mortals, and having Divine Dao powerhouses!”

“This Empyrean’s strength became stronger and stronger, strong until it even made many Heavenly Emperor powerhouses extremely wary!”

“In my eyes, what do the mortals of small worlds count for? They are merely a bunch of ants!”

“Now, I understand. It turned out that the reason for my existence was in order to let this boy be born!”
