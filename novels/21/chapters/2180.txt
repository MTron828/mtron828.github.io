Chapter 2184: Abyss Monsters’ Strength!

“This ... This guy is actually absorbing devilish energy!”

“He absorbed so much in one go and actually didn’t blow up and die!”

“Could it be that his body is forged from meteoric iron?”

... ...

Under the watchful gazes of the people, Ye Yuan brought Lin Changqing and slowly walked into the Blackflame Cave.

That appearance was like strolling in his own backyard.

The eyeballs of those Empyrean powerhouses all stared widely.

Devilish energy was extremely berserk in nature. Forget about absorbing like Ye Yuan; just absorbing a trace in, the consequences would be too ghastly to imagine too.

When Zheng Yufeng saw this appearance, he could not help having a bitter smile on his face.

Looking at Li Yue again, he said with a snicker, “Li Yue, what were you saying just now?”

Li Yu abruptly woke up and said with a look of embarrassment, “Ah? Oh, n-nothing! I didn’t say anything!”

Seemingly afraid of everyone continuing to ask, he said ferociously.

At this time, someone suggested, “This matter brooks no delay. We’d better hurry up and seal these devilish energies and enter the Blackflame Cave!”

Everyone naturally did not have objections.

With seven major forces, more than 40 middle-stage Empyrean Realm powerhouses took action.

How shocking was this commotion?

Everyone joined hands and laid down an enchantment, temporarily partitioning off the devilish energy.

Bustling around for roughly two hours, the enchantment was finally completed.

Only then did the group of Empyreans enter Blackflame Cave.

Upon entering Blackflame Cave, this was totally different from the outside world’s heaven and earth.

This place had black smoke coiling around, dim without light, looking grim and terrifying.

Li Yue and everyone had naturally never seen before such a place.

“What kind of damn place is this?” Li Yue said with a frown.

Zheng Yufeng also had a solemn look as he said, “Don’t know, but ... it’s definitely not a good place. Everybody, be more careful!”

“This place is the abyss monsters’ world!”

At this time, a voice sounded out. Two figures slowly walked over from afar. It was precisely Ye Yuan two people.

Behind Ye Yuan, Lin Changqing’s eyes never left Ye Yuan’s body, his gaze full of terror.

“Abyss monster? What the hell is that?” Li Yue said in confusion.

The other Empyreans were also at a loss. Clearly, they had not heard of abyss monsters before.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s an extremely powerful race. All in all, everyone, just be more careful.”

Li Yue said with a disdainful look, “Extremely powerful race? Huhu, how powerful can it be? This Heavenspan World is ruled by our human race! Even the demon race and fiend race also have to stand by the side!”

Another Empyrean said, “Huhu, this little brother is also exaggerating things to raise an alarm! There are so many of us middle-stage Empyrean Realm powerhouses here. Even if a late-stage Empyrean came, we might also not be without the strength to fight. What’s there to be scared of?”

As an Empyrean, each person had their own pride.

Let alone that here were the proud heaven’s chosen of seven great Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas, each and every one of them having numerous trump cards. Why would they mind some abyss monsters?

Ye Yuan’s few words, they did not take it to heart at all.

Li Yue’s thinking actually also represented the thoughts of the vast majority of the Empyreans.

Not that they did not know that this place was dangerous, but that they were very confident in their own strength.

After all, those who came before were all some initial-stage Empyrean Realm disciples. Furthermore, the numbers were also far from as many as this time.

“Is that so? Then let’s go!” Ye Yuan showed neither approval nor disapproval. He turned around and advanced.

Li Yue’s mouth curled, and he said unhappily, “What a cocky kid!”

The party headed towards the depths when everyone’s faces suddenly became fascinating.

Along the way, there were the corpses of black monsters strewn all over the ground.

The auras of these monsters were all very powerful. The vast majority of them were at the True God Realm. There were also quite a few at the Empyrean Realm.

These monsters had clearly just died not long, but they all had a common characteristic.

There was a large hole opened up in their heads!

Then, who killed these monsters?

As plain as day!

Everyone’s gazes all looked toward Ye Yuan.

Apart from this brat, who else could there be?

Everyone was secretly surprised in their hearts, in merely less than two hour’s time from start to end, this kid actually killed so many abyss monsters?

But Li Yue smiled coldly and said, “A Second Firmament Empyrean can kill so many monsters. So how strong can these monsters be? Heh heh, this brat wants to stand in the limelight and intentionally said these monsters to be very strong! In my view, it’s merely thus!”

Another Empyrean also nodded and said, “Killing so many in one go, these monsters’ strength, they are likely even inferior to ordinary same rank humans. But the numbers of these monsters are too many, we’d best be more careful.”

The group of Empyreans all nodded, the number of these monsters was indeed a little too many.

But looking at this, Ye Yuan’s strength was still pretty good. It was just that no one was willing to admit it, that was all.

Lin Changqing opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but he did not say it out in the end.

Ye Yuan also could not be bothered to dispute anything. His attention was placed on the terrain.

He was searching for the scene when Li-er went missing according to Zhuo Yuanzhi’s memories.

Roughly more than an hour’s journey, the dead bodies on the ground gradually lessened.

Very clearly, this place was already the limits where Ye Yuan could scout.

Ye Yuan secretly went on alert. The abyss monsters in the outer regions were mostly not strong. But the deeper in, the strength of the abyss monsters gradually grew stronger.

“Roar, roar, roar!”

Finally, a group of abyss monsters of varying shapes and sizes dashed out, pouncing toward this group of people frenziedly.

These abyss monsters were extremely ferocious, their strength also extremely strong. There was quite a number of them that were Third Firmament Empyrean existences.

Li Yue just laughed coldly and said with disdain, “A bunch of trash! This bit of strength and they also dare to come up and court death! Truly a bunch of foolish things!”

Done talking, his finger pointed lightly. An incomparably swift and fierce gust of air struck one of the leopard-shaped abyss monsters.

Bang!

That abyss monster cried out strangely and rolled a few times on the ground, slipping away with a scamper.

Clearly, he realized Li Yue’s power.

But Li Yue’s expression changed. His gaze revealed a solemn look.

He was a Sixth Firmament Empyrean mighty expert. That finger just now, even if a Fourth Firmament Empyrean took it, it would also be serious injuries if not death!

But this abyss monster actually slipped away completely fine.

These monsters were actually so strong?

When he looked toward his companions around him again, he discovered that those Fourth Firmament Empyrean human martial artists were actually evenly matched in strength with those Third Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A wave of cold air rose up in Li Yue’s heart.

At the same time, it also rose up in everyone’s hearts.

Only when they truly fought did they know how powerful these abyss monsters’ strength was!

A Third Firmament Empyrean forcefully contending with a Fourth Firmament Empyrean?

These abyss monsters could actually jump realms to face the enemy!

Jumping realms to battle in Empyrean Realm, furthermore, they were even elites among human martial artists.

This scene simply subverted these Empyreans’ understanding!

“Kill!” The few leaders’ faces fell, and they took action and made a move.

With Fifth Firmament and Sixth Firmament Empyrean powerhouses making a move, the show in power was different now.

In an instant, those abyss monsters sustained casualties and retreated one after another.

But the expressions of these Empyreans became incomparably solemn.

At this time, somebody looked at Ye Yuan again and could not help sucking in a cold breath!
