Chapter 2977: Dragon and Phoenix Prosperity!

The current Feng Qingxuan was like the noonday sun and actually reached half-step Emperor Vast Heaven in one stroke!

The success of the nirvanic rebirth this time had far exceeded imagination!

It was just that the people present were all struck senseless.

This woman clearly had not figured the situation out yet.

Sure enough, she discovered that something was wrong very quickly and said,?“Mn??Why are you injured?”

Following that, she noticed Ye Yuan too and said in surprise, “You … are actually not dead yet!”

In her view, with Ye Yuan facing off against these Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses, he would definitely die beyond a doubt.

Even if he refined phoenix blood essence, it could not change this result too.

She understood Feng Ninesong’s strength too well!

But now, Ye Yuan actually did not die. This made her extremely surprised.

Feng Ninesong rolled her eyes and said crossly, “Stop showing off. I know that you’re impressive! We’re currently all Ye Yuan’s captives. You can come down!”

C-Captives?

Feng Qingxuan nearly fell down from the sky. Ye Yuan alone captured more than ten Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses?

She focused her eyes to look and discovered that the others indeed all looked scared of Ye Yuan.

It was actually true!

Otherwise, it would have been impossible for these people to live together in harmony.

Feng Qingxuan landed and transformed into an unparalleled beauty appearance.

In terms of looks, she was a notch above Feng Ninesong.

Feng Qingxuan sized Ye Yuan up and down, seemingly wanting to see through him.

This conclusion was seriously too unexpected.

So many people came to search for her. If it were not for Ye Yuan, it would have been impossible for her to succeed in the nirvanic rebirth.

However, these could be discussed in the future.

She looked toward Feng Ninesong and said smugly, “Feng Ninesong, you all framed me in order to help Feng Qingyu ascend to the throne! But you didn’t expect that you’d have today too, right? You all deceived your superiors and deluded your subordinates, framing me as disloyal. Today, I’ll sentence you to death on the spot!”

After she was done talking, Feng Ninesong’s aura surged, and she was about to make a move.

However, Ye Yuan stopped her and said coolly, “Apologies. I promised to let them go. You guys can go now.”

Feng Ninesong felt akin to being relieved of a heavy burden and the rest were overjoyed and were about to leave one after another.

Feng Qingxuan’s expression turned dark, and she said in a cold voice, “What a joke! When is it your turn to speak here? You all stop for me. Not a single one of you can leave!”

Even if Ye Yuan made Feng Ninesong and the rest captives, in Feng Qingxuan’s eyes, he was also merely an ant-like existence.

She was of the high and mighty heavenly qian level bloodline and could look down proudly on the world!

It was only to see her throw a palm over, wanting to force Ye Yuan to dodge. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, Ye Yuan did not dodge or evade at all. Lifting his hand, it was a Phoenix Nine Ensembles.

Boom!

The two people each fell back several thousand feet before barely managing to stabilize their figures.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Apologies. The deal between you and me is over. I’ve also done what I promised you. As for them, I promised to let them leave. If you’re still overbearing, don’t blame this Ye for not being courteous anymore.”

Feng Qingxuan was shocked to the extreme in her heart. When he made his move just now, Ye Yuan was clearly heaven qian grade bloodline!

Furthermore, he even learned the Phoenix Nine Ensembles!

How did this guy do it?

Feng Ninesong also finally understood how Ye Yuan made Feng Ninesong become a prisoner.

When Feng Ninesong saw this scene, she felt delighted too.

This monstrous kid that you found, you bear it yourself!

But Feng Qingxuan had her own pride. How could she possibly shrink back because of a sentence from Ye Yuan?

Moreover, her cultivation realm was significantly higher than Ye Yuan!

“Humph!?Heaven qian grade bloodline, is this your pride? Do you think that I, Feng Ninesong, have this sort of trash? Kid, I urge you to move aside. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not being courteous!” Feng Qingxuan said in a cold voice.

“Feng Qingxuan , Sir is at any rate your savior! You’re completely kicking him to the curb after he has outlived his usefulness by doing so! Sir Ye is someone whose words carry the weight of nine tripods. The promise that he made, he’ll definitely do it! Previously, he protected you like this. Now, it’s naturally impossible to let you touch us too!” Feng Ninesong said in a loud voice.

Although she was seriously wounded by Ye Yuan, the current Feng Ninesong really admired Ye Yuan.

This man stood firmly to his word!

Such a man was not often seen in the heavens and myriad worlds.

Feng Ninesong snorted coldly. She knew that what Feng Ninesong said was right.

Her blood essence had already been given. If it was someone else, they would probably have long made their get-away.

This was clearly a messy situation, but Ye Yuan still persisted in protecting her.

Although the blood essence was a reward, Ye Yuan having life-saving grace toward her was an undeniable fact.

Compared to her life, what did blood essence count for?

It was just that letting Feng Ninesong leave now, she was unwilling.

Feng Ninesong pursued her all the way. She narrowly escaped death several times.

Having such a fine opportunity today, if she did not take revenge, there probably would not be a chance anymore in the future.

Hence, Feng Qingxuan steeled her heart and said in a cold voice, “Fine, since his words carry the weight of nine tripods, let him be buried in death together with you guys then!”

A light cry!

Feng Qingxuan transformed into an incomparably beautiful phoenix, soaring above the sky.

Phoenix Nine Ensembles, fifth ensemble!

Nine ensembles, the power of each was stronger than the last.

And Feng Qingxuan’s heaven qian grade bloodline could completely support her to execute the fifth ensemble.

Furthermore, the fifth ensemble that Feng Qingxuan executed was much stronger than Feng Ninesong!

Indeed, her strength was far stronger than Feng Ninesong.

The moment this move came out, even Feng Ninesong’s expression changed drastically too.

“Her fifth ensemble is already mastered to perfection, reaching the realm of grand completion! This power, probably even Sir Ye can’t block it too! Feng Ning, you bring them away first! It will be too late if you still don’t leave!” Feng Ninesong said anxiously.

She was currently heavily injured. If Ye Yuan could not block it, she would definitely die beyond a doubt.

It was just that Feng Qingxuan’s strength and status in the clan were not what she could compare to.

Feng Qingxuan was a true heaven’s chosen!

But Feng Ning refused to leave. “Where Lord Ninesong dies, this lowly one will die there!”

Ye Yuan was also somewhat surprised. None of these Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses actually left.

This made him feel great admiration.

Just based on this, Ye Yuan would not let anything happen to them too.

Boom!

Boom!

Two shocking auras rose to the sky from Ye Yuan’s body.

A dragon and a phoenix, two phantoms, danced behind him!

These two very different auras actually appeared very harmonious on Ye Yuan’s body, letting his bloodline pressure climb significantly again!

When everyone saw this scene, they were completely stunned.

“Sir Ye’s body actually still has true dragon bloodline! Furthermore, it’s even earth kun grade!”

“No, dragon and phoenix, two great bloodlines, are actually in marital harmony, being magnified infinitely on him! His current dragon race bloodline power already reached heaven qian grade too!”

“Dragon and phoenix two races are born from chaos, incompatible like water and fire! How can these two great bloodline powers possibly appear on one person at the same time? This … is too inconceivable!”

… …

The more powerful the bloodline, the nobler it was.

True dragon bloodline and phoenix bloodline were both the most noble bloodlines in the world.

It was impossible for them to blend together!

But now, these two supreme powers actually formed a perfect unity in Ye Yuan’s body.

The Fire Phoenix Clan powerhouses present were incomparably shocked.

Ye Yuan looked at Feng Qingxuan and said coolly, “This is the move that I’ve just comprehended. Since you’re so stubborn, then I’ll give it to you! Dragon and Phoenix Prosperity!”
