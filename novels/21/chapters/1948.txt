Chapter 1952: Round up in One Fell Swoop!

“Your Excellency, what did you call us back for?”

“Yeah, there are so many gathered in the Nine Pledge Branch, this is an unprecedented thing!”

...

Everyone clamored to get a word in, clearly very perplexed by Shadowwind’s actions.

Although the Nine Pledge Branch looked like an inconspicuous place, this branch’s strength was sufficient to sweep across a high-order imperial capital.

Normally, these people were scattered all over the place.

Gathering all of them in one go, everyone was clearly all very curious.

Shadowwind waved his hand and signaled everyone to be quiet before slowly saying, “Summoning you all here, there’s naturally an important thing to do ...”

Shadowwind gave an introduction to Heavenly Eagle’s situation. Everyone turned pale with fright when they heard it.

“A tiny little imperial city actually has such powerful strength?”

“Is it real or fake? That’s merely a puny little Celestial Deity Realm brat. The Myriad Treasure Tower would send so many peoples to come and protect him?”

“What the hell do you know! Ye Yuan is currently the Myriad Treasure Tower’s money tree. Sending more people to protect him is also very normal.”

...

This tiny little underground secret room was currently plotting how to deal with Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. Inside the Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s City Lord Manor, Yu Wenfeng was currently responding to this somber middle-aged man in front of him cautiously.

The middle-aged man was called Duan Yi, the tower master of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s Myriad Treasure Tower, a Ninth Firmament True God super powerhouse.

“This ... Lord Duan Yi, just what underhanded activities are there inside that small inn?” Yu Wenfeng asked. He could not hold back his curiosity.

Duan Yi sat up straight, lightly drinking fragrant tea, a look of reminiscing the aftertaste on his face.

“City Lord Yu being able to endure until now before asking, somewhat exceeded my expectations. Not that this Duan isn’t telling you, but that I’m afraid of scaring you. Do you really want to know?” Duan Yi said with a light smile.

Yu Wenfeng’s pupils constricted. He had long expected that that tiny little inn in the city was not ordinary. To be able to make a mighty Ninth Firmament True God powerhouse personally garrison the City Lord Manor, how could this matter be simple?

Moreover, there were even no less than 20 late-stage True God Realm powerhouses staying in the City Lord Manor currently.

This kind of horrifying line-up made Yu Wenfeng unable to have a good sleep these few days.

He was incomparably shocked in his heart. Because while these were many True God Realm powerhouses, they did not belong to the same faction.

Such as, this Duan Yi was the tower master of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s Myriad Treasure Tower that had jurisdiction over Nine Pledge Imperial Capital, while the other few people, some came from great imperial capitals, some came from some high-order imperial capitals.

There were even a few who were powerhouses that came from other Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas.

It was just that, who could make these people gather here?

An Empyrean?

Empyrean powerhouses could not possibly mobilize the True God powerhouses of so many places either!

Just whose face was it that was so big?

Yu Wenfeng was full of curiosity. It stifled him badly these few days.

These people quietly sneaked into the City Lord Manor and did not alarm anyone.

Right now, inside the City Lord Manor, only he alone knew these people’s background.

Looking at Duan Yi, Yu Wenfeng nodded his head firmly and said, “Lord Duan, please clarify!”

Duan Yi drank another mouthful of tea and said with a smile, “Actually, that small inn is a branch of the Deathsoul Gate! If my conjectures are right, there are probably no fewer than ten middle-stage and above True God Realm powerhouses in that inn right now!”

Smash! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yu Wenfeng shuddered, the teacup in his hand immediately fell to the ground.

His complexion instantly became deathly pale, two feet quaking non-stop.

The Deathsoul Gate, that was a name that everyone trembled with fear upon hearing.

And this terrifying force actually had such a powerful branch under his rule!

How many years had they existed?

Also, how many people and how many factions had they eliminated under his hands?

Yu Wenfeng’s mind was in chaos, full of lingering fear.

“B-But Lord Duan, your Myriad Treasure Tower also won’t be willing to oppose the Deathsoul Gate, right?” Yu Wenfeng said rather uncertainly.

Duan Yi smiled and said, “Our Myriad Treasure Tower does business. As long as there’s sufficient profit, it’s naturally worth us taking action. Moreover, this faction that has a notorious reputation, so everyone has a duty to punish them!”

Yu Wenfeng was shocked in his heart, becoming even more curious about this person controlling it at the back.

Right at this time, a figure quietly appeared in the great hall.

The arrival bowed in salute toward Duan Yi and said, “Lord Duan, the Deathsoul Gate has set off!”

Yu Wenfeng’s entire body trembled, suddenly realizing that a large-scale True God Realm great battle was about to begin right away.

Duan Yi took his time to drink a mouthful of tea, slowly got up, and said, “Call them all up, this Deathsoul Gate’s Nine Pledge Branch has brought disaster for many years and should also be exterminated.”

...

The Deathsoul Gate’s people, the group of people went out of the city and tore off the disguises on their bodies.

Shadowwind instructed, “Be more low-profile along the way. Don’t startle the grass and alert the enemy. When we reach Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, we’ll lay low and enter first. Let’s wait for the right moment to take action, understood?”

“Yes, Lord Shadowwind!”

Everyone received the orders, all tearing across the air.

It was just that they did not know that their every action and movement was being surveyed.

And ahead, what awaited them was a heaven-shocking ambush.

The party was currently in the midst of swift travel when suddenly, several dozen horrifying energy undulations passed through the void and smashed onto them.

Rumble!

Above the sky, a massive loud bang echoed.

The weak ones were actually directly blown to death by the berserk energy.

This sudden turn of events was too abrupt, everyone practically did not react in time.

High above the sky, miserable screams linked up together.

Shadowwind’s expression instantly became extremely ugly. They fell into an ambush!

How was this possible?

It had always been their Deathsoul Gate who ambushed people. When had they been ambushed by others before?

“Who is it, come out for this lord! Injuring people by underhanded means, what kind of hero are you considered?” Shadowwind roared angrily.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

With this roar of his, more than two figures surrounded from all directions, encircling this party tightly in the center.

When Shadowwind and the rest saw such a line-up, their faces immediately became ashen pale.

More than 20 late-stage True God Realm powerhouses, this kind of strength was simply outrageous to hear.

A middle-aged person among them was even a horrifying Ninth Firmament True God existence!

“Dealing with a bunch of people who perpetuates every conceivable crime and are unpardonably evil, injuring via underhanded means is also considered heroic, right?”

Shadowwind’s expression flickered incessantly and said to Duan Yi with clasped hands, “This brother, I don’t understand what you’re talking about! We’re just a bunch of people who are hurrying along the way. I wonder what’s the reason for you all to lie in ambush here?”

Duan Yi looked at Shadowwind and said with a slight smile, “Shadowwind, as Deathsoul Gate’s Nine Pledge Branch’s head, I don’t believe that you don’t recognize this tower lord!”

Shadowwind’s heart sunk, secretly wondering to himself how were they exposed?

He naturally knew the dignified Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s tower lord, a powerful Ninth Firmament True God Realm existence. As Deathsoul Gate’s branch head, how could he possibly not know?

Seeing Shadowwind not speak, Duan Yi said coolly, “Are you very curious why your identities would be exposed? Hu hu, let you meet someone; you’ll naturally understand.”

As he said, a figure slowly walked out of the void.

Shadowwind looked toward the arrival. His pupils constricted involuntarily as he cried out in shock, “Ye Yuan!”
