Chapter 1450 Rage

“What did you say? Ye Yuan he ... he came back?”

Learning of this news from Qin Tianyu’s mouth, Qin Tiannan almost jumped up.

Qin Tianyu’s expression was very ugly as well. His face was currently sullen until it was almost dripping water.

He slowly nodded his head and said with a solemn look, “Just earlier, Ye Yuan already took the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit and went to the Merit Hall to hand in the mission! I came to find you straight away when I got the news.”

“Then ... Then what about Qin Tian? Is there news?” Qin Tiannan asked with a flustered look.

He already could not care about killing Ye Yuan anymore now. Qin Tian’s life or death was the question that he was most concerned about.

However, Qin Tianyu shook his head and said, “Qin Tian didn’t return. There’s no news at all!”

Qin Tiannan turned deathly pale and said absent-mindedly, “Impossible! Impossible! Qin Tian must have been delayed by some business!”

Qin Tianyu heaved a sigh and said, “You don’t need to be so worried either. In my view, Little Tian should have been delayed by some matters. With Ye Yuan’s strength, it’s simply impossible to do anything to him.”

Qin Tian’s facial expression eased up slightly and he forced a smile as he said, “What Elder Brother said is right. I ... I lost myself in concern here. Although Ye Yuan this brat is freakish, to want to deal with Qin Tian, he’s not qualified at all.”

Qin Tianyu’s brows furrowed, but said, “There’s still something that I haven’t told you. Ye Yuan he ... Not only did he complete the mission, he even broke through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm already!”

Qin Tiannan’s expression changed. His heart that had just settled down leaped up once more.

“How is this possible? When he went, he was just late-stage Grotto Profound. It’s just been ten years or so and he broke through to the Heaven Glimpse Realm?”

Qin Tianyu let out a sigh and said, “This matter has already spread across the entire Wu Meng Academy, so it can’t be wrong!”

Qin Tiannan’s expression flickered incessantly. Qin Tianyu slowly got up, patted Qin Tiannan’s shoulder, and said, “Wait and see first! If you really can’t, you can only find Ye Yuan to have a showdown.”

...

All the way until he returned to his residence, Ye Yuan did not see Xie Jingyi. This made Ye Yuan very surprised.

The news of him returning definitely spread throughout the entire Wu Meng Academy like the wind. Logically speaking, Little Fatty should have long arrived.

“Could it be that this guy went into seclusion to cultivate?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

However, Ye Yuan kept feeling somewhat uneasy.

“Better go and take a look at him!” Ye Yuan thought about it and still intended to go to Xie Jingyi’s residence to take a look.

Ye Yuan was just about to step out but bumped into Chi Fang directly.

“Teacher Chi?” Ye Yuan said rather surprisedly.

When Chi Fang saw Ye Yuan, his eyes lit up first but became gloomy again very quickly.

“You’re going to find Xie Jingyi, right?” Chi Fang opened his mouth and asked.

Ye Yuan’s heart thumped, a foreboding premonition welling up in his heart.

“Something happened to Little Fatty?”

Chi Fang heaved a sigh and said, “You follow me!”

...

Looking at the Xie Jingyi lying on the bed, his breathing very feeble, Ye Yuan’s fury filled his chest with a wham.

Feeling that icy-cold aura on Ye Yuan, Chi Fang’s expression changed slightly.

Little Fatty’s current condition was very terrible. There was virtually not an intact spot on his body, his face being beaten until it lost human form, his body also riddled with a thousand gaping wounds. Clearly, he had had his fill of torment.

More importantly, Little Fatty’s body already did not have the slightest trace of essence energy undulations!

His divine sea was crippled, already thoroughly becoming a cripple.

At the rate of the current situation, Little Fatty would not last past a few days.

“Who did this?”

Ye Yuan’s words did not carry the slightest emotion, as if he was talking about something that had nothing to do with him.

But Chi Fang could tell that Ye Yuan’s rage had already reached the peak.

Chi Fang did not hide it either, recounting the events of a few days back.

Actually, Little Fatty was very smart. After Ye Yuan left, he was very low-profile. The vast majority of the time, he was cultivating on his own.

In this period, Wang Song and Jia Chong they all provoked many times, but Little Fatty just did not fall for it.

All the way until half a year ago, Little Fatty broke through to the half-step Heaven Glimpse Realm.

The excited Little Fatty ran straight to the inner-court to find Lin Xiu. Since then, the two people’s feelings made remarkable progress.

Ten days ago, Lin Xiu suddenly arranged to meet with Little Fatty outside the academy.

Little Fatty did not suspect anything and actually really went to keep the appointment.

He did not expect that Lin Xiu had actually long arranged with the Qin Family’s Qin Zheng, Qin Pei, as well as Wang Song and Jia Chong!

This was simply a trap!

“Only later did I know that Lin Xiu had actually secretly liked Qin Tian all along. It’s just that nobody knew. The Qin Family’s people saw that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, and that’s why they had the idea of finding Lin Xiu to take action. Xie Jingyi indeed fell for it.”

Chi Fang paused for a bit and continued explaining, “When the Xie Family heard that Xie Jingyi became a cripple, and also because of the Qin Family’s matter last time, they already don’t care about him. I know that you and he have a close relationship, so I sent him to the Myriad Treasure Tower. But his injuries are too severe, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s alchemists are also at a loss on what to do, and could only make him hang on with one breath.”

Ye Yuan listened quietly all the way, his expression calm, his emotions did not have much ripples.

It was just that the cold light in his two eyes revealed itself more and more.

Ye Yuan did not speak, taking out a medicinal pill, and stuffing it into Xie Jingyi’s mouth.

Chi Fang’s gaze turned intent. He discovered that he did not recognize the medicinal pill in Ye Yuan’s hand.

Although that was just a Tier 1 divine pill, he had actually never seen before!

Tier 1 healing divine pills were just those few types. Chi Fang recognized all. But he had actually never seen before the medicinal pill in Ye Yuan’s hand!

Chi Fang was startled inwardly, understanding it very quickly.

This was the same as the Essence Cultivating Pill, also a new kind of medicinal pill. Furthermore, it was a high-grade Tier 1 divine pill!

Ye Yuan pushed down the medicinal pill with divine essence. Little Fatty’s body actually strengthened a little.

Chi Fang’s gaze sharpened, immediately knowing this medicinal pill’s prowess.

“Teacher Chi, where are those few people right now?” Ye Yuan said indifferently.

He knew that Chi Fang definitely knew those few people’s whereabouts.

Chi Fang’s expression changed and he said, “You’re going to find them right now?”

Ye Yuan said coldly, “It’s the Qin Family again! It looks like they really take me to be a soft persimmon, kneading as they wish! Teacher Chi, I’ll take action myself for this matter. It has nothing to do with the Myriad Treasure Tower.”

Chi Fang’s expression was rather ugly as he said, “I didn’t mean that. It’s just ... you’re not their match!”

In that group of people, there were quite a few grand completion Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouses.

Especially, Lin Xiu, she was even known as the number one person below Qin Tian.

Even though Ye Yuan broke through to Heaven Glimpse Realm, there was still some gap from those people.

But this matter, it was really inconvenient for the Myriad Treasure Tower to intervene. They had no justifiable reason to carry out a campaign at all.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You just need to tell me where they are!”

Chi Fang’s expression changed again and again, and finally he said, “They are at Clearwind Inn, all there!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and walked towards the outside.

At this time, Chi Fang suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Did that Qin Tian ... go to hunt you down?”

Ye Yuan’s figure paused and he opened his mouth and said, “That’s right!”

Chi Fang was startled again and said in surprise, “You guys exchanged blows before? Then you came back. He ...” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Dead.”

Ye Yuan lightly threw down this word and went out the door.
