Chapter 2697: Knowledge is too Shallow!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Boy, give the small mountain in your hand. I can spare your life!” Greenrock looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly.

Ye Yuan ignored him. Ye Yuan asked instead, “Where did you guys come from? Why did you besiege Calm South City?”

Greenrock snorted coldly and said, “Right now, it’s this commander who’s talking to you, it’s not your turn to come and ask me!”

“Looks like I still have to make a move before I can get an answer,” Ye Yuan shook his head slightly and said with a sigh.

Greenrock’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Reckless and blind thing! A mere lower Limitless Sublime Heaven also dares to be presumptuous in front of this commander! Kill for me!”

His subordinates, more than ten grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum generals, received the order and attacked Ye Yuan one after another.

Grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum was already a feudal king of a region in the land of Heavenly South.

More than ten true spirits attacking together, the commotion was extremely shocking.

Ye Yuan’s expression did not change, muttering under his breath. The Heavenspan Mountain suddenly turned into an afterimage, smashing towards one of them.

Bang!

It was only to hear a dull and loud bang. That true spirit spurted fresh blood wildly from his mouth, being already seriously injured.

But at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure was like a ghost, and actually disappeared under the siege of the others!

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, he could already unleash 70%-80% of the Heavenspan Mountain’s power.

The weight of the power was extraordinary!

The usage of the Heavenspan Mountain was just one thing; to be unreasonable!

No matter how your means were exceedingly formidable, I would only smash with a mountain!

Simple, crude!

Yet no solution!

After Ye Yuan was set off, the speed of the Heavenspan Mountain was too fast. It was even faster than these grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum true spirits!

Unless a Jade Sovereign Heaven took action, it was virtually a fool’s talk for someone in the same rank to want to deal with Ye Yuan.

“Go!”

Before everyone had time to react, Ye Yuan’s figure appeared behind the few people bizarrely and launched the Heavenspan Mountain once again.

A true spirit was caught off-guard and directly took a fierce blow to the back.

This true spirit immediately sprawled on the ground, vomiting blood, looking like he was about to kick the bucket.

When Greenrock saw this scene, his expression could not help changing wildly.

Bizarre movement technique coupled with the unreasonable Heavenspan Mountain, this simply had no solution!

“These grand completion Limitless Sublime Heaven lords joined forces. Not only are they unable to deal with him, but they are also beaten by him until there’s one dead and one injured!”

“Where did this human come from? How can he be so strong?”

… …

The true spirit army was all dumbfounded with amazement, being frightened by Ye Yuan’s shocking strength.

Those who attacked just now were all grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum true spirits. They actually could not even touch a single strand of hair of the other party! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

On top of city walls, Su Yi was dumbfounded too.

How similarly was this scene to Ye Yuan single-handedly repelling the Thistle South army back then?

However, what was different, was that the Ye Yuan at that time was just putting on an empty-fort strategy to scare the other party away.

But now, Ye Yuan was relying on his own strength to forcefully resist the ten thousand beast army!

Currently, Ye Yuan’s image was the same as the savior in the eyes of Calm South City’s martial artists!

Looking at the jubilant cheering happening on top of city walls, Su Yi frowned slightly.

The real crux was that green-furred commander!

He was a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. Without beating him, everything was off the table.

Calm South City did not have Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses at all.

If the city protecting grand array broke, the people would definitely be plunged into misery and suffering.

Therefore, he could not open the city gates and go out.

That way, it would be equivalent to delivering the lives of the entire city into the hands of these true spirits.

“Still coming?” Ye Yuan looked at Greenrock with strong provocation.

Greenrock flew into a great rage. Flicking his sleeves grandly, he said, “All step down for this commander! This commander is going to eradicate this boy with my own hands!”

Only to see him extend his hand and beckon. The earth quaked.

An enormous rock was actually summoned by him.

Greenrock looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “This commander wants to see whether it is your giant mountain that’s formidable, or my Giant Rock Roar that’s powerful! Go!”

Greenrock was an earth-attribute true spirit to begin with. He was the most adept in earth rule.

Swoosh!

That chunk of giant rock that was akin to a small mountain actually smashed over toward Ye Yuan with incredible speed.

This scene was unbelievably spectacular.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, muttering spells under his breath again. The Heavenspan Mountain immediately turned into a small mountain.

Boom!

Two small mountains collided, emitting an earth-shaking rumble.

The giant rock that Greenrock summoned immediately shattered into countless pieces, but the Heavenspan Mountain was as steady as Mount Tai.

The most terrifying thing about this attack was not the giant mountain, but the strength of a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

Ye Yuan felt a tremendous force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas transmitted over.

He tasted sweetness in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood.

When the true spirit army saw this scene, they immediately started howling like mountains crying out and the sea howling.

“Commander is mighty! Long live the commander!”

“Commander, tear this boy to shreds and avenge the brothers!”

“Ignorant human! To actually dare oppose the commander, courting death!”

… …

When Greenrock saw the situation, he let out a burst of wild laughter and said,?“Hahaha,?punk, know my prowess yet? Strength is the kingly way! Without strength, it’s useless no matter how strong your treasure is! This treasure is just a wanton waste of God’s good gifts in your hands, might as well give it to me!”

Ye Yuan pulled back the Heavenspan Mountain and said disdainfully, “Is this the strength of a Jade Sovereign Heaven? Nothing more than this! I’m just a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, being an entire cultivation realm lower than you. You merely hurt me a little and became so proud of yourself?”

Actually, it was not difficult for Ye Yuan to avoid that blow earlier.

But he did not dodge it.

He wanted to test how strong the strength of a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven was.

Back then, Huangfu Cloudthink struck a palm on the Heavenspan Mountain and failed to take his life, let alone Greenrock.

The result of the test seemed to be … pretty good.

This bit of injury was virtually negligible to Ye Yuan.

Greenrock’s face fell, and he said with a cold snort, “Boy, I couldn’t tell if you’re shamelessly boasting! Just now was just the appetizer. Now, I’ll let you taste something even more formidable!”

Finished saying, he sucked with his palm. An even larger boulder was sucked up by him again.

“Giant Rock Roar! Go!”

This time, Greenrock employed 80% of his strength!

It could be seen that he had become genuinely enraged.

However, this time, Ye Yuan did not seem to have the intention of using the Heavenspan Mountain.

When Greenrock saw this scene, he sneered even more coldly and said, “Reckless and blind thing, go and die for me!”

However, right at this time, a cold light flashed!

An incomparably sharp sword light tore across the sky and landed on the huge rock.

Puchi!

That enormous boulder actually broke into two and fell with a loud bang!

Greenrock’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, “How is that possible?”

When he looked again, there was already an additional dragon-shaped long sword in Ye Yuan’s hand, emitting a fleeting and ephemeral undulation.

This kind of undulation gave Greenrock a feeling of heart palpitations.

Greenrock’s eyes went wide and he said with a look of horror, “G-Grandmist treasure! This … how is this possible?”

Ye Yuan looked at Greenrock and said with a smile, “Not bad, to actually even be able to recognize grandmist treasure. Didn’t you say that no matter how strong the treasure is, it’s useless too? I can only say that’s because your knowledge is too shallow! Or should I say, the treasures that you’ve encountered were not strong enough, that’s all!”

Grandmist treasure, Dragon Spring Sword!

It was naturally impossible for there to just be one grandmist treasure in Mi Tian’s hands.

This Dragon Spring Sword was given to Ye Yuan by precisely Mi Tian!
