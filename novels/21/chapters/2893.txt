Chapter 2899 A Rare Respite!

When the news spread out, Heaven One seethed with excitement!

Before this battle started, everyone fell into pessimism, believing that this time, South Qi could not stop the blood race anymore.

Who would have expected that there would be a turnaround!

The blood race’s Blood Divine Son was actually a human!

Ye Yuan, this name, spread throughout the 108 cities again, spreading throughout the entire Heaven One.

It was because this battle was Heaven One’s unprecedented great victory.

“If not for seeing it with my own eyes, I’ll definitely think that this is a mythological story!”

“A human actually became the blood race’s Blood Divine Son! Our Lord Wang Zuo is probably vomiting blood right now, yeah?”

“Over 300 thousand elite troops slaughtered in one go! Among them, the True Sovereign Hundred Sons and Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons of this generation were all killed! This battle was truly an unprecedented great victory! Magnificent! Magnificent!”

In South Qi Giant City, the people were excited to the extreme.

Even if three months had passed after the matter, this enthusiasm continued unabated.

At this time, Ye Yuan had already become a peerless figure in their eyes.

If he was not such a figure, how could he possibly create such an astonishing victory under such desperate circumstances?

However, this battle was indeed an illustrious feat.

Ye Yuan deliberately brought the True Sovereign Hundred Sons and Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons over in order to round them up in one fell swoop.

This way, the elites of this generation were virtually wiped out by him.

Those remaining were nothing to worry about either.

This was equivalent to saying that the blood race had a disjointed generated for at least ten years!

During these ten years, they could forget about any heaven-defying figure appearing.

A ten years’ period, it might not be much to Heavenly Stratum powerhouses, but to the blood race, they could create a large number of powerhouses.

Without these top younger generation powerhouses, the blood race could not launch a large-scale offensive anymore.

This battle had won at least several years of respite for the Heaven One Alliance!

South Qi’s great victory had an extremely far-reaching impact!

Not just South Qi, at this time, all of the Hegemon Realm powerhouses were shocked by the news this time.

When Hegemon Cloudmount received the news of victory, he was stupefied for a while.

The Blood Divine Son was Ye Yuan?

This was also too amazing, right?

He knew about the Blood Imitation Pill; he even personally examined Ye Yuan’s bloodline before.

With his strength, if he really wanted to examine carefully, he could still see through some inkling.

However, it would take some effort.

Just by relying on divine sense to examine, one would not be able to tell.

Ye Yuan knew about this too.

This Blood Imitation Pill, if one really went to the blood race to play a supporting role, it did not pose much risk.

But, if he was going to the Blood God Temple, that risk was huge.

In the Blood God Temple, there were large numbers of Hegemon Realm powerhouses.

Ye Yuan was so eye-catching that it was hard to guarantee that no one would pay attention to him.

This way, the risk was huge.

Additionally, the Blood Divine Son could not be attained just by being Saint Sovereign number one!

This guy actually went on a trip to the Blood God Temple and became the blood race’s Wang Zuo’s successor!

Impressive!

Truly impressive!

This sort of thing, forget about a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, even he, this Hegemon Realm, did not dare to easily attempt it too!

Not only did Ye Yuan do it, but it was also even accomplished by him, taking breaths away in astonishment!

Inconceivable!

He could no longer use words to describe his current shock.

As for the other Hegemons, apart from envy, it was still envy.

Was Ye Yuan’s performance shocking or not?

Of course!

Ye Yuan had rendered amazing contributions the moment he arrived at Heaven One Continent and even displayed a shocking talent.

Even when Hegemon Realms saw him, they were quite moved too.

But his identity as a divergent cultivator deterred the other Hegemons.

A genius who was destined to not be able to step into Hegemon had no future.

To Heaven One, if it was not a Hegemon Realm, it was completely meaningless.

They only needed Hegemon Realms now!

But now, Ye Yuan used his actions to slap their faces resoundingly.

So what if not Hegemon?

Ye Yuan did not need to become a Hegemon at all and rendered a contribution that made T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Cloudmount, you took in a good disciple!” Divine Lord’s voice came from inside the Absolute Heaven Barrier, his tone full of complex emotions.

In reality, when Ye Yuan rose up in Northern View City back then, he had been moved before too.

But he still gave up.

At this time, he was envious of Hegemon Cloudmount to death.

With such a disciple, what more could one ask for!

“Hahaha, Divine Lord is too kind! A small matter, just a trivial matter! This kid is still far lacking! Youngsters mustn’t be praised too much. Otherwise, they will become proud! Uh, he just broke through to the True Sovereign Heaven. After he enters the Emperor Realm, it won’t be too late to praise him properly then!”

Hegemon Cloudmount had a rare show of ‘modesty.’

It was just that his showing off had filled the entire Absolute Heaven Barrier!

Those Hegemons wished to attack together and smack this trumpeting fellow to death.

But they were really envious!

One had to know, Ye Yuan’s heaven-defying performance did not just benefit Cloudmount!

Extreme Medicine Sect’s prestige already reached the peak at this time in the Heaven One Alliance!

It was because Ye Yuan came from the Extreme Medicine Sect!

With prestige, there would be more genius and more resources!

“Enough! Old Fogey Cloudmount, that’s about enough!” Hegemon Blacksun said in a solemn voice.

“Old Fogey Blacksun, you’re jealous!” Hegemon Cloudmount said smugly.

“Who’s jealous! Just a divergent cultivator, is it worth this seat to be jealous?”

“You’re jealous!”

“… …”

Fine, I’m really jealous!

Divine Lord smiled and said, “Forget about Old Fogey Blacksun, this divine lord is very envious too! The significance of this battle is too far-reaching! This great victory is sufficient to avert the influence of Fellow Daoist Edgeless’ demise to the lowest. At present, the True Sovereign Hundred Sons, Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, have all fallen. This army of 300 thousand is the most elite squad of the blood race too. They had all fallen. The blood race won’t be able to launch a large-scale siege on cities for at least ten

years.”

“Everyone, these ten years are the golden period for our development! No matter what, we must groom one or two Hegemon Realms within ten years! Ten years later, what awaits us will likely be an even fiercer war!”

At this moment, all the Hegemons were shocked.

Hegemons had never appeared in Heaven One before. This had a lot to do with the blood race’s frenzied attacks.

All the Hegemon Realms were suppressed. They had no time to nurture new Hegemon Realms at all.

Hegemon Realm was far too difficult.

But now, for ten years’ time, they could finally breathe a sigh of relief.

“ARGHH!!”

At Blood God Temple, angry roars came out from the depths.

A terrifying pressure teemed every inch of space.

Lord Wang Zuo had completely rampaged!

He personally gave the decree to let Ye Yuan become the Blood Divine Son!

He had become a complete and utter joke!

The successor that he personally chose was actually a human!

Furthermore, it was even Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan, Lord Wang Zuo was too familiar with this name!

Ever since this name entered the Blood God Temple’s field of vision, the blood race’s smooth-sailing journey seemed to have become choppy.

The spatial passageway plan, South Qi Giant City’s plan, the plan to kill a Hegemon!

Every one of them was just a little bit away from success!

But in the end, it was all ruined in Ye Yuan’s hands!

“Ye Yuan! Ye Yuan! This seat is definitely going to tear your corpse to shreds and ground your bones to dust!”

Lord Wang Zuo had never hated someone so much before.

Ye Yuan was the first!

Too ironic!

His, Lord Wang Zuo’s, face was slapped over and over again by Ye Yuan!

How disgraceful was this?

An exalted Hegemon Realm, the blood race’s king, was actually toyed with in the palm of a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven!

This was simply unprecedented shame and humiliation!

“Order the Dark Night, mobilize origin powerhouses. They must kill Ye Yuan!” Lord Wang Zuo’s gaze was cold as he said.

The corners of Ye Wugui’s mouth twitched slightly and he said in a low voice, “Lord Wang Zuo, please calm your anger. The Dark Night has already suffered heavy losses in order to kill Ye Yuan! They can’t … be mobilized casually anymore! Otherwise, our hard work for these few thousand years will be forfeited entirely!”

Wang Zuo’s entire body shook, only then, remembering that in order to kill Ye Yuan, the Dark Night had already lost dozens of Emperor Realm powerhouses!

Vile spawn!

Could this little vile spawn be this seat’s jinx?

Ye Yuan!

It was Ye Yuan everywhere!

He suddenly looked at Ye Wugui and said in a cold voice, “Ye Wugui, what the hell are you doing? A measly little human Saint Sovereign Heaven could even hide from your inspection?”

This was venting anger.

Ye Wugui gave a sigh and said, “Wang Zuo, this … He even deceived the mother stone!”

Wang Zuo’s expression choked up, suddenly giving rise to a feeling of incomparable setback in his heart.

Yeah, if not for the mother stone bestowing Ye Yuan the origin of blood, how could he give this order and slap his own face?

What to do then?

Blame the mother stone?

The Lord Wang Zuo, who had uninterrupted success, actually felt at a loss on what to do currently.

How helpless!
