Chapter 2260: Sorry About It

“It can still be used like this?”

“I never knew that Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions can even trigger a Spirit Gathering Grand Array!”

“A Spirit Gathering Grand Array above 2800 miles, the power is extraordinary! This boy is going to break through!”

... ...

Eight Void Mountain had always been synonymous with danger. Under the powerful restrictions here, no idea how many powerhouses fell here.

But they had never heard that the restrictions here could still be used as a Spirit Gathering Grand Array!

They suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan was already not comprehending array formation.

He was playing with array formations!

Ingenuity in varying tactics depends on mother wit!

Clearly, Ye Yuan comprehending Dao here already gained the true essence of the Eight Void Mountain’s formation path.

On the contrary, they were cautious in taking every step here, akin to treading on thin ice, fearful of setting off restrictions.

What they comprehended was just extremely superficial Formation Dao.

Around 2800 miles and above Spirit Gathering Grand Array, the spiritual energy was incomparably abundant, forming a thick fog around Ye Yuan.

He brought Riverword and Wild Blade to a safe place outside the fog and said, “You guys help to guard me.”

After talking, he entered inside the fog.

Under such thick spiritual energy, Ye Yuan’s strength that was drained was in the midst of rapidly recovering.

He sat within the restrictions, both eyes tightly shut.

He was comprehending the Formation Dao comprehensions along the way!

Ye Yuan fought his way up to 2800 miles all the way from the foot of the mountain. The things acquired were not just exterminating Deva Realms.

Eight Void Mountain’s grand arrays were like a vast ocean.

The more he navigated, the more unfathomable he felt.

With Ye Yuan coming up all the way, he had a lot of comprehension and needed time to digest a bit.

While at this time, the chaos world within Ye Yuan’s body finally could not hold back and started expanding once again.

Within Ye Yuan’s body, his cultivation method started operating on its own. He started advancing toward the late-stage Chaos Realm.

All of his mind and body were put into comprehending Formation Dao.

This comprehension was seven years long!

In seven years’ time, Ye Yuan finally fully comprehended the Formation Dao in 2800 miles.

“Unknowingly, already reached late-stage Chaos Realm, there’s only a step away from grand completion Chaos Realm. Looks like I absorbed quite a bit of spiritual energy during these seven years!”

Ye Yuan removed the restriction and scattered the fog, everything returned to tranquility.

Suddenly, he discovered one resentful gaze after another currently looking over towards him.

“Mn? All looking at me like this for what? I didn’t seem to have offended them, right?” Ye Yuan said with a curious look.

Wild Blade had a strange expression as he said, “Young Master, you didn’t offend them? These seven years, this mountain full of powerhouses have all been offended by you.”

Seeing Ye Yuan have a blank look, Riverword added on with a bitter smile and said, “Your array formation virtually plundered all the spiritual energy. These seven years, the powerhouses on the whole mountain were unable to cultivate.”

Ye Yuan only cared about closed-seclusion back then and did not think that much.

During these seven years, he absorbed more than a significant amount of spiritual energy.

The array formations above 2800 miles, their power rivaled Deva Realm!

Such a Spirit Gathering Grand Array, how horrifying was the power?

Ye Yuan’s current realm was roughly equivalent to peak Eighth Firmament Empyrean.

He also did not think, with the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s freakish refining ability, being able to let him break through two minor boundaries in a row, how great the capacity of spiritual energy did that require?

Eight Void Mountain’s spiritual energy was extremely abundant. Furthermore, the further up, the thicker the spiritual energy.

Ye Yuan’s Spirit Gathering Grand Array was too unreasonable. The spiritual energy above, it could not snatch any at all. So it only snatched the spiritual energy below.

The major powers who comprehend Formation Dao here, those were all calculated with tens of thousands of years. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They cultivated while comprehending Dao here. But Ye Yuan drained the spiritual energy that they cultivated dry, how could they not be resentful?

But these Heavenly Emperors did not dare to offend Ye Yuan either, afraid that he would smite them with a bolt of lightning.

There was no choice. They could only endure and hope that he would finish cultivating soon.

Who knew that this guy was really shameless. The moment he cultivated, it was seven years!

These seven years, the cultivation of the powerhouses below 2800 miles virtually did not make the slightest improvement!

The resentment of the mountain full of powerhouses grew increasingly heavier. Riverword and Wild Blade almost could not bear it anymore.

If Ye Yuan still did not wake up, they almost could not resist taking the initiative to wake Ye Yuan up anymore.

Ye Yuan yawned and said with cupped fists, “Seniors, sorry about it. This Ye was comprehending Dao here and forgot the time for a moment, truly sorry.”

Said that he was sorry, Ye Yuan completely did not have an apologetic appearance.

He relied on his ability to seize spiritual energy. So who did he bothered?

This Eight Void Mountain was not opened by someone, right? Who set the rules to prohibit cultivation here?

Ye Yuan was not an overbearing person, it was not worthwhile for him to blame himself for this sort of thing.

Breaking through two minor realms in seven years, he was still very satisfied.

On Eight Void Mountain, the group of Heavenly Emperors dared to get angry but did not dare to speak.

Fortunately, it was only seven years. If Ye Yuan comprehended for 80 to 100 years here, they might as well go down the mountain.

At this time, a figure slowly walked down from on top of the mountain.

“It’s Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun! What’s he finding that surnamed Ye for?”

“Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun is Eight Void Mountain’s legend, an existence above 3500 miles, even more fearsome than Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye! Could it be that he’s looking for trouble? Heh, there’s a good show to watch now!”

“Want to find trouble, he would have long gone for it. Why would he wait for that surnamed Ye to finish cultivating?”

... ...

The moment this figure came out, it immediately caused a stir.

Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun was a terrifying existence above 3500 miles, his cultivation being terrifying to the extreme.

Existences the likes of Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye had to bow their heads in submission in front of him too.

Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun slowly walked to the vicinity of Ye Yuan and opened his mouth and said, “This old man is Xiu Yun. Little Friend Ye finished cultivating. So are you going down the mountain?”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “I’m Ye Yuan, offering greetings to Senior Xiu Yun. What Senior said is right. This Ye is just about to go down the mountain!”

Xiu Yun said, “Little Friend Ye’s Formation Dao can move the gods, making this old man admire endlessly. I wonder where Little Friend Ye was taught? This old man wants to find a time to go and exchange views with Little Friend Ye. I wonder if I can?”

The moment these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar!

Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun, what kind of proud existence was he? He actually humbled himself in making acquaintances!

Furthermore, his tone did not seem like addressing a junior, but like he was talking to a peer.

Clearly, he felt that Ye Yuan already had this qualification!

Toward such existences, Ye Yuan was long already used to it and naturally would not feel any feeling of being overwhelmed by an unexpected favor.

At once, Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said with a smile, “This Ye came from Southern Border’s Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma. If Senior Xiu Yun is interested in coming, I’ll naturally feel greatly honored by your gracious presence. Alright, this Ye still have important matters. I’ll take my leave first”

Xiu Yun nodded slightly and said, “Southern Border’s Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, is it? Okay, this old man has noted it down.”

At this time, he suddenly said in a clear voice, “If you all covet Little Friend Ye’s Dao artifact, it’s becoming enemies with this Deva!”

This voice instantly spread throughout Eight Void Mountain.

The Heavenly Emperors who had formidable strength were actually eager for action in their hearts already.

After all, the allure of a Dao artifact was too strong!

Furthermore, as long as Ye Yuan left Eight Void Mountain’s powerful restrictions, he was just a measly little Empyrean Realm brat.

With their late-stage Heavenly Emperor strength, why would they care about an Empyrean?

But this sentence from Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun immediately dispelled their thoughts.

Ye Yuan could be offended, but Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun? They could not afford to offend the latter!
