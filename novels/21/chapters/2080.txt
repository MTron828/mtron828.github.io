Seeing Ye Yuan come in a threatening manner, He Xiangyun was not alarmed but happy instead.

She was currently worried about not finding the reason to fly off the handle. But she did not expect that Ye Yuan actually delivered himself to the door.

“Peak Sixth Firmament True God? Huhu, Ji Qingyun, the humiliation that you gave this grandaunt this time, I’ll return it to you this time along with the interest!”

He Xiangyun revealed a cruel smile. At the same time, her aura rose to the peak.

That delightful sensation of taking vengeance was practically filling her up.

Ye Yuan’s bit of strength was nothing at all in her eyes.

She was Ice Cloud Tower’s head disciple, an initial-stage Ninth Firmament True God mighty expert.

Wouldn’t dealing with a mere Sixth Firmament True God still be captured with ease?

“Master, you’re not her match, you mustn’t be rash!” Empyrean Loneswan’s face changed and he was about to make a move.

But his figure had not moved yet when Ye Yuan’s nonchalant voice came over. Ye Yuan said, “No need for you to take action. This b*tch, I’ll do it myself.”

Originally, He Xiangyun was still somewhat wary of Empyrean Loneswan. But this guy was actually courting death himself.

At once, He Xiangyun laughed coldly, ice laws suddenly expanding out, ravaging over towards Ye Yuan frenziedly.

The commotion was outrageous, making the Empyrean Loneswan by the side feel anxious and fearful.

Ye Yuan walked over leisurely. The very first step was just around ten feet, but the further to the back, the greater the distance his one step took.

Under He Xiangyun’s powerful aura, Ye Yuan appeared too weak.

“Freezing Domain!”

He Xiangyun shouted and said with a cold smile, “The humiliation that you gave me, I’m going to return all ...”

The words were said halfway when He Xiangyun’s expression changed drastically, looking at Ye Yuan with a horrified look.

Ye Yuan actually passed through inside her Freezing Domain with ease, arriving in front of her in a blink of an eye.

Smack!

A resounding slap instantly echoed throughout the entire Grand Pill Establishment.

This slap, Ye Yuan did not employ divine essence. It was merely struck with the power of the physical body.

However, how horrifying was the power of his physical body?

This slap directly slapped He Xiangyun flying out.

Empyrean Loneswan and Yang Fei-er who were not far away both opened their mouths wide, looking at this scene in disbelief.

Ye Yuan who was just Sixth Firmament True God sent the Ninth Firmament True God He Xiangyun flying with a slap?

Ye Yuan took a step out, stood in front of He Xiangyun with his hands behind his back, and said coolly, “Just now, what did you say that you were going to do with the humiliation I gave you?”

He Xiangyun’s face hurt to the extreme and already lost all sensation.

Currently, half of her face was already swollen badly, being akin to a pig’s head.

She covered her face, looking at Ye Yuan with a stunned look.

Her Freezing Domain could even freeze space, but Ye Yuan actually cut through it?

How was this possible?

The reason why she did so just now was actually to give the frozen Ye Yuan a few slaps to take back her humiliation.

Who knew that her Freezing Domain actually did not have any effect on Ye Yuan at all.

How could He Xiangyun know that Ye Yuan’s attainments in spatial law were sufficient to rival Empyreans?

She only came into contact with a smattering of spatial law through ice law. How could she resist Ye Yuan?

“I ... I’ll kill you!” After the shock, He Xiangyun completely turned angry from embarrassment and already had killing intent aroused.

In her view, it was just a moment of carelessness earlier. It was impossible for Ye Yuan to be her match.

“Limitless Ice Arrows!”

He Xiangyun’s gaze was full of hatred. Forming seals in her hands, compact and tiny ice arrows suddenly condensed in space, and they carried out indiscriminate attacks inside this area of space.

Even if a Ninth Firmament True God got caught inside, they would also be injured even if they did not die.

She was fast, but Ye Yuan was faster than her!

The moment He Xiangyun’s spell activated, Ye Yuan’s figure moved.

Smack!

Another slap sent her flying once more.

Ye Yuan looked at He Xiangyun with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Kill me? Based on your strength?”

By the side, Empyrean Loneswan was long already stupefied from watching.

It was his first time knowing that Ye Yuan’s Martial Dao strength was actually so strong!

With his eyesight, he could naturally tell that not only did Ye Yuan comprehend spatial law, his fleshy body even reached the late-stage sixth transformation golden body!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s sixth transformation golden body seemed to be special!

Yang Fei-er similarly had an astonished look. The extremely powerful Eldest Senior Sister in her eyes actually lost and failed to even receive a single move.

Not only was this Master Ji’s alchemy strength fearsome, but the strength of his martial art was also formidable. What kind of monster was this!

But at this time, she could not look on with folded arms anymore as well, her figure moving and blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and she said, “You want to stop me?”

Yang Fei-er’s expression was pale. She knew that she was not Ye Yuan’s match, but she said stubbornly, “Eldest Senior Sister was disrespectful toward Master Ji. I ... I apologize to you on her behalf. I hope that Master Ji shows mercy.”

At this time, Empyrean Loneswan also urged, “Master, hold on just a moment! That Feng Tianyang currently wants to use you to establish awe. If you kill He Xiangyun, wouldn’t you fall right into his scheme?”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he said with a smile that was not a smile, “Oh? If I want to become enemies with this Feng Tianyang, what will you choose?”

Presently, it already reached the moment of a showdown. Loneswan’s every action and conduct was all within Ye Yuan’s observations.

He Xiangyun came representing Feng Tianyang. Just now, when she made a move toward him, Loneswan was clearly planning on taking action.

Looking at it like this, this Loneswan was rather sincere toward him.

Loneswan let out a sigh, shook his head, and said, “It’s no use! Feng Tianyang is naturally nothing, but behind him is Empyrean Vast Wind, one of the extreme north’s strongest existences. Even if I want to stand up for Master, my spirit is willing, but my strength is lacking too!”

To Empyrean Loneswan, Vast Wind Assemble was a colossal giant.

A mere Grand Pill Establishment was totally not enough to look at in front of the Vast Wind Assemble.

Although he was an Empyrean powerhouse, he had to lower his head too!

Ye Yuan looked at Loneswan and said with a smile, “I’m only asking you. If I must shed all pretenses of cordiality with Feng Tianyang, what will you do?”

Although Ye Yuan looked like he was joking, Loneswan understood in his heart that Ye Yuan already made a decision in his heart.

Now, was the time where it was his turn to make a decision.

Was it to stand on Ye Yuan’s side and fight till the death, or betray Ye Yuan and stand on Feng Tianyang’s side.

But, this was a battle where no hope could be seen at all!

Just based on him, one Empyrean, how was it enough?

Once they lost all decorum, don’t talk about Empyrean Vast Wind who was in the distance Vast Wind Assemble, even Jiu Luo Ji’s Empyreans would also definitely stand on Feng Tianyang’s side.

Empyrean Loneswan’s face revealed a struggling look, clearly extremely conflicted in his heart.

He had no intention of becoming enemies with Ye Yuan. But this kind of pointless sacrifice, he was truly unable to understand!

Ye Yuan did not urge either, he just looked at Empyrean Loneswan indifferently, waiting for him to make his decision.

At this time, He Xiangyun finally struggled to her feet and said inarticulately, “Just based on you, a puny little True God Realm, you also dare to become enemies with Lord Tianyang? Reckless and blind thing! Where’s Lu-er that sl*t? Why haven’t you made her come out!”

Slap, slap, slap ...

Yang Fei-er did not even react to it, and Ye Yuan already arrived behind He Xiangyun.

A series of slaps greeted her, hitting until He Xiangyun’s blood and foam sputtered, her eyes seeing stars.

After no idea how many slaps, Ye Yuan finally stopped.

Looking at the dead pig-like He Xiangyun, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Know why I hit you?”

He Xiangyun’s eyes rolled back and she instinctively shook her head.

She also really wanted to know what Ye Yuan targeted her like so. Yang Fei-er was clearly by the side too, but Ye Yuan did not touch her at all. Was it merely because she offended him?

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Because ... I’m called Ye Yuan.”
