Chapter 1918: Vying With the Master for Spirit Medicine

The stall owner was a middle-aged man wearing a felt cap, looking somewhat weathered-beaten.

Seeing Master Chen Chang flying off the handle, he said with an indifferent look, “I already said, this Earth Qilin can only be exchanged for a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill. Lower than divine-grade, not exchanging altogether!”

Chen Chang felt exasperated. Pointing at the nose of the middle-aged man with a felt hat, he said, “You go out and inquire, this Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, apart from me, Chen Chang, who else can refine a peak heaven-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill? Unless Lord Flutterfeather personally takes action, otherwise, even if you wait ten thousand years, you might not be able to get divine-grade too!”

Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill was a level nine difficulty rank five divine pill. It could be said to be a rank five healing holy medicine. The refining difficulty was not at all inferior to the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill.

Even for Chen Chang, this kind of alchemy master who was known far and wide, wanting to refine divine-grade also had to depend on luck.

Peak heaven-grade and divine-grade were only separated by a thin line, but this thin line was as hard as ascending to the heavens.

That was the difference between knowing and not knowing.

With Chen Chang’s strength, if he kept on refining, there would always be hope of refining a divine-grade.

It was just that this way, disregarding whether or not there were that many spirit medicines, the price was also too high.

The middle-aged man in the felt hat said coolly, “Then I’ll wait until a divine-grade one appears.”

Chen Chang could not help choking when he heard that, an enraged appearance from disappointment surfacing on his face.

“You ... Why are you so stubborn?”

The middle-aged man in felt hat saw that Chen Chang was anxious, the expression on his face eased up slightly and he said with cupped fists, “Master Chen Chang, I know that your Alchemy Dao strength is exceedingly formidable, but my brother’s injury must use a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill. This Earth Qilin, I really can’t sell to you. Please forgive me.”

The moment Chen Chang heard it, his face involuntarily revealed a depressed look. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

One could tell that he clearly coveted this Earth Qilin immensely.

“If I can bring out a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, can this Earth Qilin be exchanged with me?” The two people were currently at a stalemate when a voice sounded out by the side.

The two people glanced over but saw a young man in white robes walking over to this side.

This young man was naturally Ye Yuan.

When Chen Chang saw the situation, he flicked his sleeves grandly and said with a frown, “Where did this little imp come from, don’t cause trouble here!”

When the middle-aged man in the felt hat heard this, his eyes originally lit up. But seeing Ye Yuan’s young visage, he immediately lost interest.

“Young man, don’t come and make fun of me, I can’t bear being made the target of amusement! Go back to where you came from!”

Although Ye Yuan’s strength was pretty good, it could not enter their sights at all.

In this Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity martial artists could be described using as plentiful as oxen hair, why would they pay any attention?

Let alone Chen Chang, a late-stage True God Realm top powerhouse, high-level Six-star Alchemy God.

This middle-aged man in the felt hat also had First Firmament True God cultivation.

Ye Yuan did not mind and said smilingly, “I don’t have time to make fun of you. This Earth Qilin is very important to me. If you need the Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, I can refine it for you right now. Let’s hand over the money in one hand, and the goods in the other.”

Ye Yuan’s words immediately attracted quite a few people’s attention.

“Where did this kid come out from, to actually dare snatch spirit medicines from Master Chen Chang?”

“He even said that he’s going to refine a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill on the spot. This trumpet is blown really hard.”

“Heh, truly shameless boasting! Even Master Chen Chang has to take a chance when refining the Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill. Could it be that he, a measly little Five-star Alchemy God, can refine it?”

...

Chen Chang’s reputation was clearly very resounding. Quite a number of experts present were very familiar with him.

A Celestial Deity Realm that popped out from god knows where said that he was going to refine a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, this kind of spectacle was really rather funny.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Chen Chang’s face fell and he said, “Young man, do you know who this old man is? To actually dare snatch something from this old man?”

Ye Yuan looked at Chen Chang and said with a smile, “I naturally know; you’re Master Chen Chang. But this Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, weren’t you unable to refine it? Since you can’t refine it, you can’t very well let this Earth Qilin be wasted here, right? Master Chen Chang, you enjoy high prestige and command universal respect, if you can take out a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, this child naturally won’t fight with you.”

When Chen Chang heard that, his face could not help turning black.

How could divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill be so easy to refine?

If he could take it out, why would he still need to talk rubbish here?

“Humph! Punk, you also got to come up prepared when bragging, alright? It’s not that this old man is boasting, but in this Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, apart from Lord Flutterfeather, no one has absolute confidence in being able to refine a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill! As for the other few people, their strengths are almost on par with this old man; a hairline away from this old man. They naturally have to depend on luck too. You say that you can refine it? Who would believe!” Chen Chang said with a disdainful look.

When the others heard this, they all secretly nodded their heads, and they mocked Ye Yuan for overestimating his own ability in their hearts.

Master Chen Chang was naturally not boasting, he naturally had his confidence in saying these words. No one would feel that there was anything inappropriate.

But the words Ye Yuan said, that was boasting.

For some time, mocking voices sounded out all around, ridiculing Ye Yuan one after another.

Ye Yuan looked at the middle-aged man in the felt hat and said smilingly, “Senior, please hold out on packing up the stall, and wait here for a moment. This Ye will be right back, okay?”

The middle-aged man in felt hat looked at Ye Yuan with a suspicious look and said coolly, “If you can really bring a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, this Earth Qilin is naturally yours!”

As he said, the middle-aged man in the felt hat actually did not take it seriously at all.

He was naturally aware of Chen Chang’s reputation and was not willing to overly offend too, hence, that was why he said those words.

To say that Ye Yuan was even more formidable than Chen Chang, he would not believe even if he was beaten to death too.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and immediately turned around and left.

Chen Chang snorted coldly and naturally thought nothing of it.

Forget that it was just a Five-star Alchemy God, even if a Six-star Alchemy God came, he also had sufficient confidence to feel that the other party would be inferior to him.

A Celestial Deity Realm brat whose skeletal age did not exceed 1000 years old could refine a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill?

A fantasy tale!

After Ye Yuan left, he went to inquire about the spirit medicines needed to refine the Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill.

Disregarding other things, his actions still aroused quite a number of people’s attention.

Some people did not believe in such heresy and actually followed Ye Yuan to move around within the Hundred Herb Gathering.

Although the Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill was a level nine difficulty medicinal pill, compared to the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill, the medicinal pills needed were much more common. Various major factions all had some stock, Ye Yuan gathered them very quickly.

Of course, this also cost quite a bit of his divine essence stones.

But the present Ye Yuan already obtained the Purple Extreme Hall’s inheritance and also sat on the Southridge Ten Cities.

Even if he reduced quite a bit of tax, he was also an out-and-out nouveau riche. Purchasing these spirit medicines was naturally not difficult.

Within this Hundred Herb Gathering, quite a few people were all exchanging for medicinal pills. Pill refining rooms were naturally equipped.

Ye Yuan gathered the spirit medicines and rented a pill refining room and started refining the pill.

Outside the pill refining room, a group of people surrounded there, clamoring to get a word in.

“This boy really went to refine pills! These spirit medicines that he bought, he probably spent no less than a million middle-grade divine essence stones, right?”

“Goodness gracious! Don’t look at how this brat is young; he’s really a wealthy guy!”

“Heh, reckon that he’s a wastrel! Just the likes of him also want to refine a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill?”
