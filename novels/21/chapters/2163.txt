Chapter 2167: When Two Tigers Fight, One Is Sure to Die!

With dragon origin crystals entering the body, a heartrending pain immediately transmitted over. Ye Yuan could not resist sucking in a cold breath.

Following that, origin dragon energy fused into his blood vessels very quickly.

Ye Yuan’s fleshly body and bloodline were being remolded rapidly.

He could feel that his fleshly body was becoming stronger bit by bit.

However, the energy contained in the dragon origin crystals, there was a portion of it that branched off, converting to chaos divine essence and soul force.

Ever since breaking through to Chaos Realm, Ye Yuan discovered that the divine essence he absorbed would split into three.

This was also to say that no matter how he cultivated now, it was cultivating essence, energy, and spirit, three paths, simultaneously!

This way, Ye Yuan’s strength would be even more consolidated.

Of course, cultivation also became slower.

However, the dragon race’s origin dragon energy was another form of existence.

Ye Yuan could feel traces of warm flow entering the Heavenly Dragon Mark, then spreading throughout the entire body.

His dragon race bloodline became purer!

Except, refining six pieces of dragon origin crystals in a row, Ye Yuan did not feel signs of the Heavenly Dragon Mark awakening, and he could not help feeling disappointed.

“Bloodline power increased by at least 20%, the power of my dragon race martial techniques will also increase 20%! This dragon origin crystal is really good stuff!” Ye Yuan exclaimed in admiration.

Reaching his level of boundary, each increase in bloodline was extremely, extremely difficult.

But a few pieces of dragon origin crystals let his bloodline power increase 20%, it was indeed a treasure that was hard to come by.

But Ye Yuan also discovered that the effect of the dragon origin crystals was gradually diminishing.

Furthermore, the agony of amalgamating the dragon origin crystals was also continuously increasing.

Ye Yuan reckoned that after the fused quantity reached a certain degree, it would probably be saturated.

After getting up, Ye Yuan did not dawdle either, continuing to look for dragon origin crystals.

This thing, naturally the more the better.

Very soon, he relied on the Heavenly Dragon Mark’s reaction and found a piece of dragon origin crystal.

However, without any surprises, another Son of the Heavenly Dragon also found it.

“Ye Yuan!” The other party let out a surprised cry.

Ye Yuan had long seen the arrival already. It was none other than precisely Ao Yu.

Ao Yu had a smug look as he said with a cold smile, “Enemies really meet on a narrow path! How is it? Do you have any realization already?”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Realization? What’s that?”

Ao Yu shook his head and laughed in spite of himself. Using a pitying gaze to look at Ye Yuan, he said, “Really don’t know where your courage comes from, to still dare be arrogant in front of me! You probably don’t know right? Just earlier, Cloud Dragon Stronghold’s Long Seven was already defeated at my hands!”

Long Seven was an existence that had hopes of squeezing into the top three. Now, he was actually defeated at Ao Yu’s hands.

It could be seen that Ao Yu’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds.

Who knew that Ye Yuan’s face did not have any visible chance in countenance as he said coolly, “Oh? So what?”

Ye Yuan’s nonchalance triggered Ao Yu badly, setting off all of his wrath.

At the outside world, when Ao Qi saw these two people meet, his expression could not help changing.

As the saying went, enemies would always meet, the two people finally bumped together!”

Just earlier, the outside world’s heavenly emperors had just experienced a shock.

Ao Yu who was a nobody actually defeated Long Seven who was a favorite to contend for the top three!

This result made the heavenly emperors’ jaws drop.

Originally thought that Ao Yu was just a sidekick, who knew that after he entered the Mist Battlefield, he seemed to have become enlightened, seizing dragon origin crystals consecutively.

In the end, his Heavenly Dragon Mark actually underwent a second awakening and even awoken a second innate divine ability. Even Long Seven was not his match anymore.

Long Zifeng was currently depressed. When he saw this scene, he could not help sneering as he said, “Looks like these two people don’t seem to be on good terms. There’s a good show to watch now! I wonder if it’s this arrogant Ye Yuan who’s stronger, or Ao Yu who awakened a second time who’s stronger! When two tigers clash, one is bound to get hurt! Heh heh!”

But Ao Qi let out a sigh and said, “Not that one is bound to get hurt, but that one is sure to die!”

The heavenly emperors could not help being surprised when they heard that, looking at Ao Qi in great surprise.

Originally this time, it was the moment for Purpledragon Stronghold to radiate splendor. They did not expect that such a sudden turn of events would actually occur.

Life and death were not prohibited in the Mist Battlefield. But unless one was genuinely enraged, otherwise, rarely would people determine life and death.

Under normal circumstances, crippling the other party and making the other party withdraw from the Mist Battlefield was considered over.

But now, these two great powerhouses were actually going to determine life and death, it involuntarily made people very surprised.

Somebody asked, “Ao Qi, why is that?”

Ao Yi let out another sigh and talked about the two people’s grudge, making everyone stare dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

Ye Yuan this fellow was really a troublemaker, to actually scheme a heavenly emperor to death!

But regarding this sort of scene, quite a number of people were delighted to hear about it.

Cutting each other’s throats, this sort of thing, they dwelt upon it with great relish.

“Heh, Ye Yuan this brat is so arrogant, he probably never thought that Ao Yu actually awakened a second time, right? Even if he’s of the perfect seventh transformation, it’s also impossible to be Ao Yu’s match just based on martial technique!” Long Zifeng said with a cold laugh.

He still had half a sentence that he did not say: best that both parties fight until they were both wounded, and both withdraw from the Mist Battlefield!

Regarding Long Zifeng’s words, the other heavenly emperors were also very much in agreement.

Long Tianyu nodded and said, “After the second awakening, regardless of whether it is bloodline power or innate divine abilities, the power will rise more than a level. Ye Yuan didn’t even awaken once, so it’s impossible to comprehend an innate divine ability. Therefore, he has virtually no chances of victory!”

The moment Long Xiaochun heard, she was immediately indignant and rebutted, “You guys just watch. Ye Yuan will definitely take him down!”

When the group of heavenly emperors heard, they could not help laughing out loud. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Fighting this sort of thing could not determine the victor based on feelings.

A perfect seventh transformation was indeed very strong, but each one of the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon was an elite among the elites.

In terms of the fleshly body, they also approached perfection.

Although there were disparities in this aspect, it was also not irredeemable.

A second awakening innate divine ability could make up for this disparity!

Let alone that the combat power which Ao Yu exhibited, everyone already witnessed it.

Long Seven displayed his second innate divine ability and still lost to Ao Yu.

Therefore, they were not optimistic about Ye Yuan.

“Humph! Ignorant fool, you completely don’t know the significance of defeating Long Seven! I’ve already awakened a second time and comprehended a second divine ability. Even if you have exceedingly formidable abilities, it’s also impossible to escape alive today!” Ao Yu said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Is that so? Then bring out your special skill. Don’t let me down.”

Ao Yu’s gaze turned cold, and his vital energy surged, like a fire.

An enormous true dragon phantom slowly condensed behind him!

Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter!

However, Ao Yu’s Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter was more than a magnitude stronger compared to Long Zheng’s.

That true dragon was also significantly more condensed.

This was the power of a second awakening!

Feeling the boundless power coming from the opposite side, the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth revealed a hint of amusement and he said with a light laugh, “A little interesting! It can force out some of my strength!”

It was only to see Ye Yuan’s two hands form a Tai Chi stance, an enormous dragon emerged.

Universe Dragon Claw third stance, Grand Universe Palm!

Bang!

The void trembled. Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter directly collapsed. The Grand Universe Palm carried an indomitable momentum and slammed onto Ao Yu’s body.
