Chapter 2702: Trapped in Myriad Demons Mountain!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum giving guidance to Jade Sovereign Heaven?

Then three half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens broke through all of a sudden?

The reason they could not take down Heavenly South City all along, the main culprit was actually this guy in front of them?

What was this freaking logic!

This Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum was a little too monstrous, right?

Ye Yuan originally still wanted to explain things. He did not expect Zhao Xun and Song Tianyang played along very well, directly explaining it to everyone for him.

He came from outside, it was naturally impossible to have colluded with the people in the city.

Zhao Xun and Song Tianyang’s behavior was sufficient to show it.

He could guide peak grade four heavenly alchemists to reach this step, refining grade four heavenly imperial pills would naturally be a cinch.

“Looks like there’s no need to explain anything with regards to my ability anymore. If you guys still have any concerns you can say it,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Zhao Xun two people had confused faces, completely not knowing what was going on.

But it seemed like the two of their behaviors earlier had a great impact on these five kings.

Furthermore, it looked like Ye Yuan already dealt with these five!

But beyond the joy, the two people were incomparably shocked.

Sure enough, when this boy took action, there was nothing that could not be done!

Myriad Elephant King said, “You said it just now too, the first thing that Meng Frostwind will do after leaving seclusion will be finding us to settle scores. He already obtained the Sacred Destiny Pill and might break through at any time. Even if you don’t need to reach Saint Sovereign Heaven, how can Jade Sovereign Heaven be achieved overnight? Don’t forget, you’re just lower Limitless Sublime Heaven!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “May I ask Myriad Elephant King, if you obtained the Sacred Destiny Pill, how long would you need to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

Myriad Elephant King thought about it and said, “That Sacred Destiny Pill was only third grade, if it was this king, it will take as little as 30 years to as long as 100 years, and I’ll definitely be able to break through!”

Actually, this was already him gilding gold onto his own face. Even if there was the Sacred Destiny Pill, it was also an unknown whether or not they could break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

After all, the medicinal effects of a third grade Sacred Destiny Pill were hard to say.

Of course, with their half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven realm, the chances of wanting to break through were still very high.

However, although breaking through a major realm was just a matter of a few hours, the time required to prepare for these few hours was extremely long.

Ye Yuan naturally would not expose it and asked Zhao Xun, “Head Hall Master, how long did I use to break through from middle Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum until my current realm”

Zhao Xun smiled and said, “Four years!”

He also did not expect that Ye Yuan left for a short three years and actually already broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This kind of cultivation speed could be rated as terrifying.

But thinking about it, it was normal too. Ye Yuan could refine true grade heavenly pills himself, cultivation was actually not complicated for him.

But these words were by no means trivial when they reached the ears of the five kings.

“Four years! What a joke! Do you think that breaking through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum is like playing house?” Wild Lion King said with disbelief written all over his face.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If I didn’t care about cultivation realm not being stable, with my means, I have the confidence to break through to Jade Sovereign Heaven within five years! How long do you think I need to break through to Jade Sovereign Heaven if I used that kind of heavenly pills to cultivate?”

As he said, Ye Yuan pointed at Shuoyan.

But the expressions of the five kings changed, already somewhat believing it.

The medicinal effect of that heavenly pill just now was seriously a little too terrifying.

In less than a few hours, an upper Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum became a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven!

One had to know, even if they had the help of the Sacred Destiny Pill, breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven would also require as long as several decades!

The disparity could not be measured with distance!

“Moreover, the heavenly medicines that the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill require aren’t easy to find. I reckon that you guys would probably need several decades just to gather the heavenly medicines. This period of time that I’m cultivating, you all will probably be running all over for heavenly medicines. Of course, if you can gather five sets of heavenly medicines, I can guarantee that all five of you will break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!” Ye Yuan said it casually.

“Is this true?!” When the five people heard that, they said in unison.

Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill was a grade four heavenly imperial pill recorded in Zhong Jianchou’s jade slips.

Ye Yuan was still quite confident in its medicinal effect.

Forget about true grade, even if it was ninth grade, it should also be sufficient to let these few people break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

However, such a powerful heavenly pill, the heavenly medicines required would naturally be extremely precious too.

The Myriad Demons Mountain had a vast territory and abundant resources. There was hope of gathering a few sets. It was just that whether or not they could gather five sets would depend on their own good fortune.

“I’m willing to swear in the name of Heavenly Dao! However, if you guys can’t gather the heavenly medicines, then it can’t be blamed on me,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Alright, this king promises you! But this king has a condition!” Heavenly Rat King said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Please speak!”

Heavenly Rat King said, “Before refining the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill, you must stay on the Myriad Demons Mountain as a hostage and not take a single step out! If you dare leave, the five of us will join forces to eradicate Heavenly South again!”

Clearly, Heavenly Rat King was very cautious.

Even if Ye Yuan swore in the name of Heavenly Dao, he could not trust him either.

And his way of doing things also got the acquiescence of the other four.

“No way!” The moment these words came out, the expressions of Zhao Xun two people changed, immediately rejecting it.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Okay, I promise you!”

“Ye Yuan, you …” Zhao Xun two people looked at Ye Yuan and said with guilt in their hearts.

This awful mess was caused by Meng Frostwind. But now, Ye Yuan had to shoulder it!

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a smile, “I’m also very curious about the Myriad Demons Mountain. There’s no harm in making a trip there. If you guys have anything that you don’t understand in cultivation, you can come to Myriad Demons Mountain to find me.”

At this time, Shuoyan suddenly said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, don’t worry. With me around, no one in the Myriad Demons Mountain will dare bully you!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Alright, then I’ll stick with you in the future!”

… …

Countless true spirits retreated like the tide, leaving behind a mess and corpses all over the field.

But this was already the best outcome.

Looking at the true spirit army’s distant back view, Zhao Xun could not help sighing slightly as he said,?“Sigh!?Ye Yuan is really a righteous person! If not for him, Heavenly South will probably not have a blade of grass surviving!”

Wu Jian said bitterly, “Meng Frostwind this brute, he actually used the entire Heavenly South as a chip to let himself break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven! I really hope that that Sacred Destiny Pill is useless and he can’t break through!”

Zhao Xun’s eyes turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “If he fails to break through, it will probably be difficult to find him again in this life! Better that he breaks through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, and then come back! At that time, we’ll be able to take revenge!”

Song Tianyang let out a sigh and said, “The strong feasts on the Myriad Demons Mountain and the weak are prey. There are countless powerhouses. I also don’t know whether or not Ye Yuan can return safe and sound this time!”

The weak were prey and the strong feasted on Myriad Demons Mountain. Even these half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven kings were replaced by new ones very quickly too.

A careless misstep and they would be replaced by others.

It was also precisely because of this that there were a lot of powerhouses in the Myriad Demons Mountain.

These five kings were merely just a drop in the ocean.

If everything went well, these five kings naturally would not do anything to him.

But if war broke out, the result would be hard to say.

Hearing Song Tianyang’s words, everyone’s brows furrowed even tighter.
