Chapter 2755: This Exalt Knows You Too Well!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Of course it’s me! Do you think that a puny little Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum can control all these? He’s merely a self-righteous chess piece, that’s all! After this exalt escaped, I didn’t dare to return to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and can only hide in this small world! After Zhuo Bufan left, this exalt started to set up all these!”

“Although Lower Realms ants are useless, their divine soul essence is still pretty good! Hence, this exalt killed three of this small world’s Heavenly Stratum powerhouses and devoured their origin divinities. Then I used the last of my origin divinity power to completely refine this world, sealed the two great passageways with the Heavenspan Mountain, and absorbed the power of a world to restore the Heavenspan Mountain! Then I urged time rule to the extreme and changed the time flow rate of the Heavenspan World. Done with all these, this exalt fell completely into a deep sleep.”

“Under the time acceleration, generations after generations of powerhouses provided countless divine soul essence for this exalt! This exalt’s origin divinity also recovered little by little. All the way until the last Divine essence, this exalt finally woke up. Ever since then, this exalt could take the initiative to absorb divine soul essence.”

“After this exalt woke up, the Heavenspan Mountain hasn’t been restored to its peak state yet, and this exalt’s state was extremely unstable too and couldn’t return to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. However, after waking up, this exalt discovered something that’s a little interesting. Time was actually in disorder! In this world, there was actually someone who could make time disorderly. This means that someone has understood time law and already touched rule! Hence, this exalt discovered you!”

“Huhu,?discovering you was really an unexpected pleasant surprise. You actually used the Heart of Heavenspan to comprehend a Heavenly Stratum cultivation method that belongs to you; truly remarkable! Furthermore, as your cultivation method was gradually completed, the Heavenspan Mountain was also continuously recovering, and this exalt’s origin divinity was also constantly growing stronger! When you broke through the plane passageway and ascended to the 33 Heavens, not only did this exalt’s origin divinity recover to its peak state, but it also even went a step further, reaching grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Yan Jadetrue did not avoid anything, talking tirelessly about the matter of singlehandedly controlling the Heavenspan World.

As if he had done something insignificant.

But Ye Yuan was burning with rage as he listened!

The Heavenspan World’s trillions of lives were merely trifles that could be trampled at will in Yan Jadetrue’s eyes!

And his road to maturity was actually paving the way for Yan Jadetrue’s recovery!

He did not know because at that time he was really too weak.

In the eyes of a powerhouse like Yan Jadetrue, he was an ant; he was a chess piece that could be toyed with at will.

Sucking in a deep breath, Ye Yuan’s eyes were slightly dark as he said, “So after I ascended, you felt that I could still be made use of, so you linked up the two world’s passageway and had me bring people in to get the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation?”

Yan Jadetrue smiled and said, “Not bad! In my eyes, you’ve always been an inessential chess piece. But I didn’t expect that you could actually take the last step and shatter this world’s shackles! So, I felt that maybe I could continue making use of you a little! Because your potential is really great!”

Ye Yuan corroborated his Dao as Heavenly Stratum and shattered the firmament with a sword.

It might be nothing to the rest of the 33 Heavens.

But Yan Jadetrue knew how difficult it was to be able to take this last step!

It was not that Ye Yuan would be able to take this step after creating a Heavenly Stratum cultivation method himself.

This small world was already a dilapidated world. The power of rules was all chaotic and completely disjointed from the 33 Heavens’ Heavenly Dao!

To everyone in the Heavenspan World, Yan Jadetrue’s actions were tantamount to severing everyone’s path to Heavenly Stratum.

But Ye Yuan still did it!

This could not be called amazing anymore!

Ordinary small worlds’ ascenders, no matter how amazing they were, they would also have to be grandsons when they reach the 33 Heavens!

Of course, there were exceptions like Zhuo Bufan.

But Yan Jadetrue knew that even if Ye Yuan reached the 33 Heavens, he would belong to the group of those unrivaled talented powerhouses.

The things that Zhuo Bufan could not do, he might not be unable to do them! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Back then, Zhuo Bufan entered the Labyrinth Divine Palace together with them. He actually did not get any benefits. But he did not die and escaped with serious injuries.

But Yan Jadetrue felt that perhaps Ye Yuan could do it. That was why there was this scene today.

“So, you brought the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation? If you don’t have it, then there’s no meaning for the people related to you to exist anymore,” Yan Jadetrue said with a smile that was not a smile.

Ye Yuan had a dark look and directly threw the small bottle containing the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation to the other party.

“I’ve brought you the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation. Can you let the people go now?” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Yan Jadetrue caught the small bottle, a hint of wild ecstasy flashing across in his eyes.

It was really the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation!

Back then, he almost lost his life under rank six restrictions for the sake of this Voidsnap Immortal Condensation!

Now, he finally obtained it!

This brat actually really accomplished it!

“Jeje,?this exalt indeed didn’t misjudge! Something that even Zhuo Bufan couldn’t do, you accomplished it! Actually, when I saw that those guys didn’t die, I knew that you most likely succeeded!”

Yan Jadetrue naturally knew about the rest leaving the Heavenspan World.

Those Jade Sovereign Heavens going in, they could only be cannon fodders.

But what surprised him was that there were actually many Jade Sovereign Heavens who did not die!

Yan Jadetrue opened the small bottle but threw it to Ye Yuan and said coolly, “You absorb some first!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Aren’t you a little too cautious? What the hell can I, a measly little Jade Sovereign Heaven, do?”

Yan Jadetrue chuckled and said, “Don’t you forget, this exalt watched you grow up! This exalt understands you too well! There were many powerhouses that succumbed in your hands! Enough crap, hurry up and absorb!”

Ye Yuan’s heart sank slightly. This guy was indeed extremely careful.

Fortunately, he was long prepared.

Ye Yuan’s expression flickered indeterminately. After hesitating for a moment, he still probed his origin divinity power into the small bottle.

However, his current origin divinity undulation was merely at the level of Jade Sovereign Heaven.

It was very hard for others to do it, but Ye Yuan cultivated Divine Emergence, converging his aura was easily accomplished.

When Yan Jadetrue saw the situation, he could not help clicking his tongue and praising, “Chaos origin divinity! In this dilapidated small chiliocosm, you could actually attain a chaos origin divinity, truly not easy!”

In the wake of Ye Yuan absorbing the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation, a power that gladdened the heart and refreshed the mind poured into his origin divinity.

He felt as if his origin divinity was like a long drought getting a good rainfall and started growing stronger under the nourishment of the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation.

However, Ye Yuan also detected that there was some discordant thing mixed in it.

This thing was extremely hidden. If not for him cultivating Divine Emergence to the second level, there would be no way of detecting at all.

It was naturally impossible for the Frivolous Life Like a Dream’s toxicity to manifest immediately.

By the time Yan Jadetrue discovered it, everything would already be too late.

Ye Yuan was not in a hurry to purge the Frivolous Life Like a Dream either. This poison was extremely formidable. It was not so easy to deal with.

Taking action now would only heighten the other party’s vigilance.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s origin divinity strengthening continuously, Yan Jadetrue’s eyes became even more wildly ecstatic.

True Sovereign Heaven!

He finally had hope of reaching this realm!
