1838 Maybe, This Is a So-Called Genius

“Such thick spatial power!”

The group of people arrived outside of a barrier. Ye Yuan immediately felt the spatial force that hit him head-on.

Du Rufeng nodded and said, “The heart of the void realm is the cornerstone of the void realm, the entire Bamboo Groove Void Realm built on it. The spatial power here is naturally the strongest. You’re the most adept in spatial law, perhaps you might have some gains.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, revealing a look of anticipation.

Everyone was just about to continue moving on when two figures suddenly appeared out of thin air and asked, “Halt! Who goes there?”

These two people were dressed in black, their auras being incomparably powerful.

When these two people appeared, Ye Yuan’s pupils suddenly constricted.

Spatial law!

These two people both knew spatial law. Furthermore, their comprehensions were exceedingly high.

Du Rufeng said in a clear voice, “Kong Wen, Kong Chen, why? Don’t even recognize me anymore?”

“Oh, turns out that it’s Master Du! You’re a rare guest, what wind blew you here?” Kong Wen laughed and said.

Du Rufeng smiled and said, “Isn’t the once-a-thousand-years Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave here? It just so happens that I was tasked with this errand this time. I brought over these disciples who passed the test and let them enter the heart of the void realm to comprehend.”

Kong Wen’s gaze swept a glance over Ye Yuan and the others. He said with a frown, “Turns out that it’s the disciples who just entered the temple. But ... the quality of this season is somewhat poor. Why is there even a middle-stage First Firmament Celestial Deity?”

In this one year plus, virtually every disciple who took part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave made substantial progress.

Ye Yuan as one of the best among them was naturally no exception either.

Not long ago, his realm made a small improvement and broke through. He was now a middle-stage First Firmament Celestial Deity.

Although it was still within a minor realm, this cultivation speed was actually very fast already.

One had to know, for ordinary Celestial Deity powerhouses to want to break through, it was all calculated with thousands, even several tens of thousands of years.

However, Kong Wen’s words made everyone’s faces reveal peculiar looks.

Poor quality?

Ye Yuan’s quality should not be too good!

Du Rufeng laughed and said, “Huhu, Brother Kong Wen has made an error of judgment. Ye Yuan overpowered the masses in this Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave, and is fully-deserving of the first place.”

Kong Wen was taken aback and immediately said even more disdainfully, “He got the first place? Huhu, that shows even more that this season’s disciples are too poor!”

Du Rufeng was speechless when he heard that. Ye Yuan’s strength, if not seeing with one’s own eyes, it was likely very difficult to believe.

“Snort!”

At this time, Little Tong suddenly let out a cold snort.

Only then did Kong Wen duo notice that there was actually a child who followed along too.

However, when they saw the Treasure Pig in the child’s arms, their faces could not help changing greatly.

“Alright, stop talking rubbish, hurry up and open the barrier to let us in.” Du Rufeng said coolly.

Kong Wen duo did not say anymore, immediately taking out two magic weapons, and forcefully opened up a door in the barrier.

Du Rufeng continued and said, “You all go first, I’ll follow right after.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes were flickering incessantly. No one knew what he was thinking about.

But he still entered the barrier together with the others.

After everyone left, Kong Wen said in surprise, “That ... Could that child be ... that lord?”

Du Rufeng had a solemn look and said in a deep voice, “The few great island masters’ conflict, you guys are also aware of it. This matter, you guys had best take it as you didn’t see anything. Otherwise ... the consequences are not what you can bear!”

The two people’s gazes turned intent and they said, “Got it!”

...

Above the void, an enormous chunk of crystal was suspended there.

Seeing the heart of the void realm, Ye Yuan’s mind stirred.

Laying low in the Bamboo Groove Void Realm for so long, he finally saw the heart of the void realm today.

As long as he opened up the heart of the void realm and entered it, he would be able to return to the Heavenspan World.

“Treasure Pig, can you really open up the heart of the void realm?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

The heart of the void realm was normally in a sealed state. The Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s space was extremely stable. Its normal operation did not need to activate its complete state.

Only when new disciples entered the sect would it open once.

“Grunt! Grunt!”

Treasure Pig grunted at Ye Yuan, seemingly expressing its displeasure.

Suddenly, its body shuddered, two rays of light suddenly shot out of its nose, flying straight for the heart of the void realm.

Bang!

The heart of the void realm emitted intense vibrations. Then, it burst forth with a blinding light.

A boundless spatial power rapidly spread out, making Ye Yuan’s heart float up.

Ye Yuan was overjoyed, threw several medicinal pills over, and said with a smile, “Well done, Treasure Pig! You’re indeed amazing!”

Treasure Pig swallowed several medicinal pills in one gulp and actually grinned at Ye Yuan, boring into his bosom all at once.

Little Tong snorted coldly and said, “Gluttonous pig!”

In this enchantment, spatial law revolved non-stop. Ye Yuan was impacted by the power of laws all of a sudden until he was almost asphyxiating.

Actually, what was contained inside this heart of the void realm was not just spatial power of law, but contained the source of a world, an existence similar to that of Heavenly Dao.

This kind of source power was infinitely beneficial to martial artists.

But Ye Yuan was the most sensitive towards spatial law, so his comprehension in this aspect was also the deepest.

Suddenly, a hint of comprehension rushed to his head. Ye Yuan’s entire person was akin to being electrocuted, standing transfixed on the spot.

A hint of surprise flashed across Little Tong’s eyes and he cried out in surprise, “Comprehended so fast? This kid, really ...”

Ye Yuan had already stopped at third firmament spatial law for very long. Today, under the envelopment of this powerful spatial law, he finally produced a trace of enlightenment and started breaking through.

When the others saw this scene, they were all shocked until they could not close their mouths.

Luo Zhen smiled bitterly and said, “Maybe, this is a so-called genius!”

These words coming out of his mouth were really rather bitter.

In this thousand over years, he had always been crowned with the title of a genius. He himself thought so too.

Regardless of whether it was cultivation speed or laws comprehension, he examined his own conscience and felt that he did not lose to anyone.

All the way until he saw Ye Yuan gain enlightenment on Dao today, this confidence was utterly shattered into pieces.

The other four people, including Baili Qingyan, all deeply felt that way too as they nodded their heads.

“This isn’t an ordinary law, but this is one of the supreme laws, spatial law! This guy is really a freak!” Li Long could not resist spitting, being dealt a terrible blow.

Under everyone’s eyes, Ye Yuan took a step out, his body immediately vanishing.

Ye Yuan blended right into the void.

While at this time, Du Rufeng, Kong Wen, and Kong Chen, also entered the barrier and just happened to see the scene of Ye Yuan submerging into the void, their eyes opening wide.

“This ... This is spatial law! He comprehended the fourth firmament spatial law! This kid was actually so monstrous?” Kong Wen said in immense shock.

“His profound accumulations erupted. Encountering the spatial power of the heart of the void realm, his power of law directly achieved mastery through comprehensive study of the subject, and understood! We cannot compare to this child!” Kong Wen also said.

Even Du Rufeng was also inexplicably shocked.

He knew that Ye Yuan might very likely gain enlightenment on Dao, but he did not think that it would be this fast. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
