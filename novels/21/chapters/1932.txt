Chapter 1936: Battling Three Elders

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Chen Yu’s brows furrowed, revealing an unhappy look.

Ye Yuan actually challenged the three of them at the same time, this was also looking down on the few of them too much.

As Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s veteran powerhouses, the three of their statuses naturally went without saying.

Ye Yuan was unbridled on account of his young age and also too overweeningly arrogant!

There was a series of sighs below the stage, all mocking Ye Yuan’s overestimation of his own ability.

“Ye Yuan, you’re extremely talented, your strength being extremely formidable. Concerning this point, this old man admits it! But you want to challenge the three of us at the same time, ithat’s looking down on others too much, right?” Chen Yu said in a solemn voice.

Clearly, he was unhappy.

The Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders by his side also had unfriendly looks, their expressions when looking at Ye Yuan was full of enmity.

But Ye Yuan had a relaxed look as he said smilingly, “Elder Chen Yu, don’t get agitated. Let me finish saying.”

Chen Yu had a black face as he said, “Say!”

Ye Yuan said, “This Ye doesn’t have the intention of looking down on the elders. The reason why I did so is actually because of another reason. If Ye Yuan can win by chance, I have a presumptuous request.”

Chen Chang said, “We’re not unreasonable people, if you can win, you’ll be a member of our generation. Whatever you need us elder brothers to help with, just open your mouth. There is no need to use this kind of method to goad us.”

Toward Ye Yuan, Chen Chang still quite admired him.

Furthermore, he understood that Ye Yuan was not that sort of impetuous and arrogant person.

There must be a reason why he did this.

But this way of doing things was too provocative. It would definitely push people away.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “If I can win, I wish to challenge Empyrean Flutterfeather. Hope that seniors can fulfill this request.”

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples!

Everyone’s faces changed abruptly, being stunned by Ye Yuan’s words.

“Arrogant! Too arrogant! He ... He actually dares to challenge Empyrean Flutterfeather? How dare he!”

“Ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! Who is Empyrean Flutterfeather? How could he be what a puny little Celestial Deity Realm can challenge?”

“This brat must have lost his mind!”

...

There was an uproar at the scene. The crowd was thunderstruck by Ye Yuan’s words until they were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.

It had already been no idea how many years, no one had ever dared to say that they wanted to challenge Empyrean Flutterfeather!

Forget about a puny little Five-star Alchemy God, even Seven-star Alchemy Gods, those who dared to challenge Empyrean Flutterfeather were not many either.

Chen Yu looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Do you know what you’re saying?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I naturally know. My objective of coming to Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital is seeking cooperation on one hand. While on the other hand, it’s in order to challenge Empyrean Flutterfeather!”

Entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion had never been Ye Yuan’s goal.

With his strength, entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion did not pose the least bit of difficulty at all.

“Humph! Brat who overestimates his ability, you think that by entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, you have the qualifications to challenge Lord Flutterfeather?” Chen Yu said with a black face.

Ye Yuan said, “Hence, I proposed challenging the three of you at the same time. If I win, it can at least show my strength too. Isn’t that so?”

Everyone was astonished. Only now did they know Ye Yuan’s intention.

“Humph! Even if you really win, you’re also not qualified enough to challenge Lord Flutterfeather, give up on this!” said an Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elder with a cold snort.

Chen Chang also said, “With your talent, you might not be unable to attain Lord Flutterfeather’s height in the future. It’s just that challenging him right now, you’re not qualified enough yet.”

Ye Yuan fell silent. Empyrean Flutterfeather had long already had the status of not to be blasphemed, just like gods, in these people’s hearts.

A puny little Five-star Alchemy God challenging him was seriously too grossly overestimating his own ability in their eyes.

Below the stage, there was also a series of taunting and mocking voices, all ridiculing Ye Yuan for being ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Since that’s the case, forget it then.”

Finished talking, he actually turned around and walked outside.

Chen Yu frowned and said in a cold voice, “Ye Yuan, what do you mean by this?”

Ye Yuan said without even turning his head back, “I entered the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion in order to challenge Empyrean Flutterfeather. Since I can’t get my wish, entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion lost its meaning too.”

Wildly arrogant!

Too wildly conceited!

The people looked at Ye Yuan and already did not know what to say.

In Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital, the final goal that all of the alchemists strove toward was the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion.

But Ye Yuan actually turned his nose up at it!

Actually, Ye Yuan was really not arrogant. It was just that his horizons were different from these people.

Just like a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, would he care about a True God Realm’s organization?

It was impossible to have any interest at all!

Although Ye Yuan did not reach the Heavenly Emperor Realm, the strength of Alchemy Celestial Pavilion these elders was still far too lacking compared to him.

“This empyrean accepts your challenge.” Right at this time, a voice suddenly descended.

Everyone’s faces suddenly changed. Was that Empyrean Flutterfeather?

“Lord Flutterfeather!” Chen Yu and the rest said in surprise.

They did not expect that Empyrean Flutterfeather would actually descend personally and agree to Ye Yuan’s challenge!

“The three of you have a match with him then. Little Friend, don’t let this empyrean down!”

Finished talking, that voice disappeared without a trace. It was as if it had never appeared before.

When Ye Yuan heard this, a hint of joy flashed across on his face.

Looks like his performance these few days in the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion indeed attracted Empyrean Flutterfeather’s attention.

Chen Yu sucked in a deep breath and said in a solemn voice, “Stinking brat, don’t you get dizzy with success! Our hurdle isn’t easy to clear!”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said with a smile, “Please give guidance!”

...

On the stage, three great alchemy celestial level powerhouses had fearsome auras, crushing over towards the Ye Yuan currently in the center.

However, Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of panicky look.

Three great alchemy celestial level powerhouses joining hands, the commotion was indeed extraordinary. It was far from what Yu Ying that kind of blackscale level powerhouse could compare to.

It was just that even with three people joining hands, it also could not stop Ye Yuan’s momentum.

His imposing momentum was akin to floodwaters about to breach the dam; advancing irresistibly.

“How can this be? These three are the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s strongest elders. Under their teamwork, even Seven-star Alchemy Gods have to temporarily avoid the cutting edge too. But Ye Yuan is actually faintly suppressing them!”

“Too terrifying! Could it be that this guy doesn’t have a limit?”

“It can’t be that he really has the strength to challenge Lord Flutterfeather, right?”

...

Under Ye Yuan’s assault, fine sweat beads seeped out on the foreheads of the three great alchemy celestial level powerhouses, appearing very strained.

The refinement of rank five divine pills competed in the understanding of rank five divine pills, the medicinal properties of rank five spirit medicines, as well as Alchemy Dao Realm.

In these few aspects, Ye Yuan completely crushed the three great alchemy celestial level powerhouses.

This alchemy battle seemed like Ye Yuan was very weak, but actually, it was not the case at all.

It was at this time that everyone finally saw clearly Ye Yuan’s strength. They also finally knew where Ye Yuan’s confidence lay in challenging the three great alchemy celestial level powerhouses. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Condense!”

Ye Yuan gave a low cry, the medicinal pill formed!

The three great elders were akin to being relieved of a heavy burden, only then slightly heaving a sigh of relief.

Very soon, the three great elders also completed the pill refinement.

The moment they opened up the furnace to take a look, the crowd was flabbergasted!

“Void spirit divine pill! Under this kind of brute force confrontation, Ye Yuan actually still refined a void spirit divine pill!”

The three elders’ medicinal pills were one high-grade, two middle-grades.

Not that they could not refine high-quality medicinal pills, but it was that they were utterly suppressed by Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum, unable to unleash their strength at all.

Ye Yuan won again!
