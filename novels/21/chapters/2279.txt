Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “If you’re looking for spirit medicines, might as well take a trip with me together to Cloudheart Realm. The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference is hosting the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference, I believe that there won’t be a shortage of rank eight spirit medicines.”

Although he did not deliberately interrupt Heavenly Emperor Justbright’s breakthrough, this consequence was indeed caused by him.

With Ye Yuan’s personality, he would naturally make up for it.

Moreover, this matter was merely a matter of lifting a hand to him.

Cloudheart Realm was the Medicine Ancestor’s Bodhidharma.

The Medicine Ancestor opened up a world of his own and was aloof from worldly things.

The Heavenspan World’s alchemy path powerhouses all took pride in being able to enter the Cloudheart Realm.

It was just that the difficulty of entering Cloudheart Realm was too high, those with ordinary identities could not enter at all.

Cloudheart Realm was the well-deserved number one alchemy holy land of the Heavenspan World!

Heavenly Emperor Justbright was surprised when he heard that and said, “There’s actually still this sort of thing? Cloudheart Realm hasn’t had any major activities in very long! Why did the Medicine Ancestor suddenly think of hosting this sort of grand event this time?”

He was in closed-seclusion for many years and completely did not know about this.

But with Heavenly Emperor Justbright’s status, he naturally knew about the moving direction of the Cloudheart Realm.

The Cloudheart Realm had always been aloof from worldly affairs. It would not care about everything in the secular world at all.

Even if they really organized something like an alchemy conference, it would also be held by his disciples in the secular world. They would not go to the Cloudheart Realm at all.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I said that it was organized in order to take a hit at me, will you believe me?”

Heavenly Emperor Justbright laughed loudly, his expression suddenly reining in as he said, “I won’t believe even if you beat me to death! What kind of status does the Medicine Ancestor have? Why would he personally make a move to take you, a junior, down? Even if you’re the Priest Temple’s Second Sage, with your current strength, his disciples giving you a blow is more than enough, why would he need to drag in so many people?”

Even though he knew that Ye Yuan was the Second Sage, he did not have a clear understanding of Ye Yuan’s strength.

Even if Ye Yuan could refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill, wanting to reach the level of Dao Ancestor’s realm, it was still too far away.

Dao pills, that was the highest pinnacle of the alchemy path!

And this step was virtually impossible to take.

Since time immemorial, how many astonishingly talented alchemy powerhouses had attempted to reach the level of Dao pill.

But they all did not succeed.

Now, the Heavenspan World’s Dao pill powerhouses were far too few.

Ye Yuan still had to continue working hard to prove his strength!

It was just that he did not know that Ye Yuan had long already refined a Dao pill!

If not because of this, why would the Medicine Ancestor take up arms and hold the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time?

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered to explain these. He just shrugged and said, “Come on.”

The two people left Heavenly Fate Town and were just about to teleport away, but discovered that there were some tiny black dots in the distance.

Looking at the appearance, it was a group of people besieging a person.

Heavenly Emperor Justbright frowned and said, “A bunch of little guys, a small squabble, no need to care about them, come on.”

He looked over towards Ye Yuan but discovered that Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, his entire person already stepping out on the sky and went over there with one step.

Heavenly Emperor Justbright’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “Spatial law! What swift speed! This boy is indeed very peculiar!”

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

Several streaks of sword lights flashed past, there was instantly only one person left on the battlefield.

When a woman in blue garment saw Ye Yuan, it was as if her entire person was drained, falling down softly.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, hurriedly going up to support.

At this time, he was incomparably surprised in his heart. This girl in front of him was the Shadowmoon Sect’s Senior Apprentice Sister Baili Qingyan when he was in the Bamboo Groove Void Realm!

This girl who should be in the Bamboo Groove Void Realm actually appeared in the Heavenspan World!

Seeing Baili Qingyan, Ye Yuan’s head suddenly exploded.

When he was comprehended Dao on the Heavenspan Mountain previously, Baili Qingyan seemed to have called out softly in the crowd.

But at that time, all of his body and mind were immersed in comprehending the Chaos Heavenspan Canon and did not hear at all.

But when Ye Yuan’s consciousness at that time fused into Heavenly Dao, he naturally saw everything around him clearly.

Looking back now, wasn’t Baili Qingyan above ten thousand miles?

She came to find him!

Ye Yuan made his judgment straight away.

If not for seeing Baili Qingyan here, Ye Yuan would have even forgotten this person. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Regarding Baili Qingyan’s affection, Ye Yuan naturally knew about it.

But his heart could not accommodate other women at all anymore.

It was just that Ye Yuan did not expect that Baili Qingyan was actually so deeply in love, secretly running out of the Bamboo Groove Void Realm.

Furthermore, looking at her appearance, Baili Qingyan should have run out very, very early on.

Otherwise, with Baili Qingyan’s aptitude, it was absolutely impossible to cultivate to Empyrean Realm in the Bamboo Groove Void Realm.

Only by coming to the Heavenspan World and having fortuitous encounters time and again could she cultivate to the Empyrean Realm within such a short time.

In an instant, Ye Yuan thought of many things.

When Baili Qingyan saw Ye Yuan, her face revealed a trace of a slight smile. Using all of her strength, she said, “Being able to die in your arms, I ... I’m perfectly contented!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned slightly dark and he said, “With me around, you won’t die!”

The current Baili Qingyan, her life force was already severed, her life fading away rapidly.

At this time, Heavenly Emperor Justbright already arrived too. Taking a look at the injuries on Baili Qingyan’s body, he shook his head and said, “It’s useless, her life force has already been thoroughly cut off. Even if you’re the Second Sage, there’s no way to save at all! Unless ... the Medicine Ancestor comes in person!”

Ye Yuan turned around and shot him a fierce glare, and said in a cold voice, “Shut up for me! Come over, use your longevity to channel qi to her!”

Heavenly Emperor Justbright’s expression changed and he said, “Rubbish! This emperor’s blight tribulation is about to arrive soon, using longevity to channel qi to her, isn’t it courting death? Moreover, even if I channel qi to her, it’s also just delaying her death, it can’t save her at all! This kind of loss-making transaction, this emperor won’t do it!”

Ye Yuan bellowed, “Enough crap! Your loss in longevity, I’ll help you make up for it! In addition, not counting refining the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill this time, I’ll owe you a favor!”

When Heavenly Emperor Justbright heard this, his eyebrows shot up and he said, “Is this for real?”

“If you keep on talking f*cking nonsense, do you believe that I won’t even help you to refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill anymore?” Ye Yuan exploded with a rare swear word.

Baili Qingyan’s life was rapidly dissipating, continuing to delay and it would really be hopeless.

He was burning with anxiety and this guy was still rambling nonsense, how could he not be angry?

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Heavenly Emperor Justbright did not dare to talk rubbish and hurriedly came over to use his longevity to help Baili Qingyan extend her life.

Ye Yuan let go of Baili Qingyan and immediately went to one side to meditate, his entire person entering a state of emptiness.

When Heavenly Emperor Justbright saw this scene, he could not help saying very curiously, “What in this boy doing? Can meditating a bit save this girl? This kid wouldn’t be swindling me, right?”

One breath!

Ten breaths!

100 breaths!

A hundred breaths later, Ye Yuan suddenly snapped open both eyes, both hands pointing out in the void non-stop.

An incomparably complex grand array quickly formed in the void.

Seeing this scene, Heavenly Emperor Justbright was greatly astonished!

Such a complicated and elaborate array formation was absolutely not what Eight-star Formation Gods could set up!

Heavenly Emperor Justbright had never seen before the scene of Ye Yuan refining the Chaos Samsara Pill. If he had seen it before, he would know what Ye Yuan was doing.

He was going to refine a Dao pill!
