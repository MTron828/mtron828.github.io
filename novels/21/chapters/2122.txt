Chapter 2126: Stabilizing the Universe!

“Mn?” Medicine Ancestor’s uncertain voice came from above the void.

But Sacred Ancestor High Priest laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha ... Brilliant! Stupendous! Kid, you indeed have some skills! It’s just that I wonder how long can you last under the two of our Great Dao!”

Everyone had baffled faces. Ye Yuan’s move was clearly incomparably lousy. So how was it brilliant?

But Ji Mo’s pupils shrunk, his eyes revealed an astonished look.

Otherwise could not tell, but he could understand.

Ye Yuan’s finger seemed plain and ordinary, but it perfectly remedied some latent dangers left behind during the process of the two great sovereigns hewing open heaven and earth.

Going according to the original rhythm, even if the two great sovereigns opened up a world anew, the result would also be exactly the same as before.

This was the outcome decided in the chess game. So no one could change it.

But now, with Ye Yuan smoothing things over in the middle, it was totally different!

Ye Yuan’s strength was insufficient to participate in the two people’s development of the world, to create the world.

But he had his own Dao.

“This ... This is the Yin Yang Harmony that he spoke of? How incredible!” Ji Mo could not refrain from marveling with admiration.

When Long Zhi and the rest heard this, they did not understand but felt that it was very impressive.

To be able to make Ji Mo let out such an emotional sigh, this finger move was absolutely remarkable.

It was just that they were totally clueless about Alchemy Dao. So how could they see through the profundities involved?

“Again!”

Amidst the loud laughter, Sacred Ancestor High Priest pointed another finger out. Heaven and earth divided again.

Medicine Ancestor gave a cold snort and also pointed a second finger out, being incomparably sharp.

Ye Yuan’s gaze revealed a hint of a solemn look. But he also pointed a second finger out without the slightest hesitation.

This finger was the same as before, also without any noise.

The three people’s showdown seemed played down, but in reality, it was incomparably perilous.

Under the two great sovereigns’ Great Dao, if Ye Yuan made the slightest error, it would be the outcome of being smashed to pieces.

No matter how talented Ye Yuan was, he was also just a True God Realm powerhouse. So how could he bear two mighty Transcendent Heavenly Emperors’ Dao accumulations?

Taking part in the two people’s showdown, he was actually serving a pivotal function in front of the two great sovereigns, borrowing force to deliver force, and not him really exerting much force.

But how could this sort of thing be that simple?

If it were bystanders, they probably would not even be able to block a single exchange and would be directly crushed to dust by the two great sovereigns’ power of Great Dao. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But Ye Yuan’s realm was too low in the end. It was already extremely difficult to survive under the two great sovereigns’ heavy pressure, let alone that he even had to repair the damaged world because of the two people’s showdown in magical abilities.

The second finger that Medicine Ancestor pointed out was incomparably swift and fierce. It contained thick Dao intent, with killing intent being extremely heavy.

Medicine Ancestor’s move was clearly in order to exert greater pressure on Ye Yuan, trying to make him die under the two people’s Dao accumulations.

The three people were akin to playing a game, taking turns to point out one finger after another.

A brand new world gradually appeared in front of everyone.

Ji Mo looked ahead, a trace of understanding flashing across in his eyes.

To a powerhouse of his level, every improvement was extremely hard to come across. Not making advancements for several tens or even several hundreds of thousands of years was also normal.

But these short few days of observation could match several tens of thousands of years of his bitter cultivation.

Originally, he could not figure out the Ask Not chess game after racking his brains. But with Ye Yuan’s addition, he actually had a feeling of suddenly seeing the light.

Ye Yuan’s technique was completely not worth mentioning in front of the two great sovereigns. But it was precisely because of his appearance that made this world become more perfect.

The places where he cast the spell were all lacking areas originally in Ask Not, covering the incompleteness and regret caused by the two great sovereigns’ magical showdown.

Under Ye Yuan’s participation, a perfect world was being sketched out little by little.

Time passed day by day, the powerhouses of the outside world became more and more astonished.

They had once thought of countless possibilities for Ye Yuan to clear Ask Not.

But they had never thought that Ye Yuan was actually clearing the hurdle with such a method.

Sitting and debating on Dao with two great sovereigns, creating a world, this kind of method was way too inconceivable.

Before this, if someone said that a Six-star priest would sit and debate on Dao with the two great Alchemy Dao sovereigns, they would definitely turn their noses up in contempt and then ridicule the person endlessly.

But now, their inner hearts were completely filled with shock.

Time flew by, in a blink, half a year already passed.

“The situation isn’t good! You guys, look, Ye Yuan’s complexion is pale! It seems like he’s already completely drained like a lamp without oil.”

“It’s already been half a year! He hasn’t stopped in the slightest and is actually only at the end of his ropes until now! This guy is really a freak!”

“A True God Realm powerhouse is facing two great Alchemy Dao sovereigns, and yet he could actually hold on for as long as half a year! It’s simply unimaginable! Even I, this Empyrean, would have long reached the end of my ropes too!”

... ...

Inside the chessboard, Ye Yuan’s complexion was pale, his forehead seeping out fine beads of sweat beads, his entire person seemingly very frail.

A fierce battle lasting half a year, regardless of whether it was divine essence or soul force, Ye Yuan already reached the limit.

“Humph! Boy, I didn’t expect that you could hold out until now. But, it also ends here!”

Medicine Ancestor gave a cold snort and pointed a finger out once more.

Powerful Dao accumulations covered the world as easily as crushing dead leaves, inflicting heavy damage on the space that Sacred Ancestor High Priest created.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest gave a muffled groan, clearly also already running out of steam and expiring.

Inside this Ask Not was a doomed game to begin with.

How could the Sacred Ancestor High Priest be Medicine Ancestor’s match?

If not for Ye Yuan taking part, this game of chess would merely be re-enacting the chess game back then.

Powerful Dao accumulations crushed over towards Ye Yuan. At this time, such a powerful force was like the last strand of straw that overwhelmed the camel’s back; incomparably heavy.

“Hahaha ... So what even if you’re gifted? In the end, isn’t it still death! Ye Yuan, see if you still don’t die!”

Seeing this situation, Heavenly Emperor Shaoyun could not refrain from laughing out loud.

He held extremely deep grudges toward Ye Yuan. Although he was shocked by Ye Yuan’s talent and strength, he wished that Ye Yuan would be wiped out by Medicine Ancestor.

Heavenly Emperor Zixu looked toward Ji Mo and said with a smile, “Lord Stardrive, this is the Lord Second Sage that you let us witness? That’s right, he’s indeed very impressive. But a dead Second Sage really lets people feel greatly consoled!”

Ji Mo just snorted coldly and did not say anything.

Concerning this round, he was not optimistic about it too.

The current Ye Yuan was too frail.

Ye Yuan’s gaze became slightly sharp and he said in a cold voice, “What a fine Medicine Ancestor, really someone who is narrow-minded! Since that’s the case, then I’ll let you take a look at my true strength!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, both hands in the position of holding a ball. An enormous Tai Ji diagram emerged behind Ye Yuan.

When Medicine Ancestor’s Dao accumulations landed on Ye Yuan’s body, it was immediately guided into the world by the Tai Ji diagram, repairing this world in an uninterrupted flow.

“Heaven and earth are divided into Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang stabilize the universe! Medicine Ancestor, you watch closely! This is my, Ye Yuan’s, Dao! Stabilize for me!”

Ye Yuan turned his palm. The Tai Ji diagram behind Ye Yuan slowly started turning.

This world of chess game actually gradually formed.

Ye Yuan’s Great Dao aura actually completely overshadowed the two great sovereigns.

There was only a Tai Ji Yin Yang diagram remaining in this world.

Bang!

Ye Yuan’s palm shook, the Tai Ji diagram dissipated with a loud bang.
