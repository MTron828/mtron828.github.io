ruo xu and zheng qi both had astonished expressions. innate divine lord mystic treasure, this term, deeply shocked them. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

ye yuan only heard dustless mention this thing when he dove down the natural chasm too.

dustless told ye yuan at that time, the origin magnetic field at this place was so strong. an innate divine lord mystic treasure might be born deep at the bottom.

innate divine lord mystic treasure and divine lord mystic treasures refined postnatal, that level was completely different.

although divine lord mystic treasures were rare, reaching ruo xu’s and zheng qi’s level, having one was not a problem.

but innate divine lord mystic treasure was so rare that hearing it made one’s hair stand on end.

the reason why it was called innate divine lord mystic treasure was naturally because it was gestated naturally.

it was just that the conditions for forming were extremely harsh. only in some very special places, could it inoculate successfully.

innate divine lord mystic treasures, its power overwhelmed same rank postnatal divine lord mystic treasures.

not just so, the most precious aspect of innate divine lord mystic treasures was that it was conceived naturally. within it contained heavenly dao laws.

once martial artists refined an innate divine lord mystic treasure, they could fuse with this portion of heavenly dao strength, letting themselves break through the shackles from there.

to a divine lord realm powerhouse, the chances of breaking through to celestial deity realm would also greatly increase.

how could this kind of treasure not move people?

if the thing being born this time was an innate celestial deity mystic treasure, that value was immeasurable.

celestial deity realm powerhouses would definitely go into action without delay.

“elder ye, this matter is of utmost importance, you can’t make any jokes!” zheng qi sucked in a cold breath and said to ye yuan.

ye yuan smiled and said, “how can this ye joke about this matter? but what’s there below that natural chasm, this ye can’t say for sure as well. but it’s definitely very dangerous. furthermore, the further down that natural chasm, the stronger the forcefield. one’s realm will also be suppressed drastically. the higher the realm, the higher the suppression. if head elder, you go, i reckon that at most, you can only unleash the strength of third-layered heaven divine lord.”

hearing this, everyone’s faces turned slightly fearful.

zheng qi’s expression could not help becoming serious. this news that ye yuan brought was very useful to him.

this news, knowing in-advance and preparing for it was god knows how many times better than last minute fumbling blinding when the time came.

realm suppression was not targeted at them only but targeting everyone.

once they were prepared, that was taking the initiative.

at that time, fighting for the innate divine lord mystic treasure was not impossible.

“elder ye, if it’s really as you say, we still have to give this matter further thought and confer at length. but ... you still can’t go. the ones going this time are definitely all divine lord realm powerhouses. even if their realms are suppressed, they are also not what you can deal with. moreover, there are still celestial deity powerhouses raring to go.” zheng qi said.

ruo xu also said, “elder ye, old brother zheng qi is also worried about your safety. you’d best not go and join in the fun.”

ever since after ling zikun’s incident, ruo xu’s impression of ye yuan improved significantly.

thinking about it, for heavenly eagle imperial city to have such a genius, there only seemed to be advantages and no disadvantage.

furthermore, ye yuan repaid ingratitude with kindness, preserving song qiyang’s face, and also let him vent his grievance. this made him much more pleased in his heart.

in the past, he was under an obsession, seemingly taking unnecessary pains to split hairs, opposing ye yuan in every way. it seemed to be somewhat too much.

ruo xu knew that his hate had extended on account of another, because of xuan yu, and because he feared ye yuan.

but ye yuan said, “two head elders, recently, i encountered some bottleneck in cultivation and it’s hard to resolve. this time, i can just go out and take a walk. you all rest assured, this ye still has some means, protecting myself should be an issue. moreover, at the fiend calling ridge there, i think nobody is more familiar and more used to it than i am.”

when zheng qi saw ye yuan’s composed appearance, he could not help being secretly alarmed.

hearing the meaning in ye yuan’s words, he still had a considerable trump card on him!

zheng qi ruminated for a moment and finally said, “alright, since elder ye insists on going, then go along. but, once there’s something amiss, you must escape right away. you mustn’t seek to outshine others!”

...

coming to the fiend calling ridge once more, ye yuan was also dumbstruck with amazement by the scenery before his eyes.

countless brilliant rays of sunlight shone out from inside the 100 thousand foot abyss, spectacular to behold.

from very far away, ye yuan sensed the extremely strong origin magnetic field. slight weaker divine lord realm powerhouses could not even fly.

at this time, fiend calling ridge’s two shores already had large numbers of powerhouses gathered. they were practically all divine lord realm and above powerhouses.

disregarding the fiend race’s side, just the human race’s side, the divine lord realm powerhouses that came were no less than 100 people.

among them had the reinforcements which river eternal imperial city invited, and also reclusive powerhouses who were drawn over.

“how is it, ye yuan?” zheng qi asked ye yuan.

ye yuan observed for a while and said, “this forcefield is at least five times of the original. furthermore, it’s still growing stronger continuously! i didn’t expect that in a short 100 years’ time, such a massive change actually happened to this place.”

“then according to your surmises, what kind of treasure will be born this time?” zheng qi said.

ye yuan mused for a moment and said with a solemn expression, “it’s still hard to say right now, but likely ... the grade won’t be too low.”

the two people were currently talking in a low voice when suddenly, a pair walked over this side.

“haha, zheng qi, long time no see, you’re actually not dead yet!” an ear-piercing voice drifted over from a distance.

zheng qi’s face turned black and he said coldly, “gao yuan, you’re not dead, how can this old man dare to die?!”

the one in the lead was a slightly chubby old man who looked very wretched. but his aura was very powerful. it was actually on par with head elder zheng qi.

gao yuan laughed loudly when he heard it and said, “how can a defeated opponent dare to talk brave words?! heh heh, didn’t expect that you dared to come personally this time. you mustn’t be like that damn master of yours, who died here without any explanation.”

zheng qi’s expression was incomparably ugly. ye yuan could clearly feel his fury, but he forcefully reined it in.

“gao yuan, don’t you get cocky! master’s grudge, i’ll seek it back personally one day!” zheng qi said in a cold voice.

upon meeting, swords were drawn and they were ready to jump at each other’s throats.

ye yuan was uncertain and asked an elder by the side, “what’s going on here?”

the elder said, “several tens of thousands of years ago, head elder’s master perished inside a mystic realm. but it was said that at that time, head elder’s master originally wouldn’t have fallen. he only died because he fell into a trap dug by this gao yuan. in the end, this gao yuan escaped safe and sound, while head elder’s master died inside the mystic realm. head elder later cultivated bitterly, and finally broke through to become a ninth-layered heaven divine lord. hence, he went to find this gao yuan to take revenge. who knew that because of the lucky chance that this gao yuan obtained inside the mystic realm that time, he actually touched the threshold of celestial deity realm, and stepped into half-step celestial deity realm. head elder returned in defeat and was nearly killed by gao yuan. if not for city lord personally taking action, head elder would probably have already perished.”

ye yuan did not think that there were actually still so many twists and turns involved.

back then when he brought coldfeather back, after coldfeather heard the news of wu xingtang’s demise, he was still dejected for a while.

clearly, he also valued this disciple of his greatly.
