Chapter 1318: Spirit Mending Pill and Dao Skandha Pill!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Wanru, you’re thinking about Sir Ye again, right?” Hong Yin could not help scoffing when she saw Liang Wanru staring blankly.

Liang Wanru’s face reddened, and she lowered her head bashfully.

Hong Yin could not help bursting into laughter when she saw and said, “If you miss him, then miss him, what’s the big deal? A genius like Sir Ye, which woman doesn’t like? Actually, Hong Yin likes him a lot too. It’s just too bad that Hong Yin doesn’t have this fortune and know that he definitely won’t take fancy on me.”

Hong Yin had long seen through that Ye Yuan being so talented, as long as he could repair his divine sea, he would fly to the sky in one move sooner or later.

Even if he could not repair the divine sea, just based on his unique skill of Formation Dao Pill Refinement, it was also sufficient to gain a foothold in any place!

For the tower lord to send Luo Jian out to protect Ye Yuan, this in itself indicated many problems.

Liang Wanru could not help but become interested when she heard and looked towards Hong Yin rather interestedly.

Hong Yin heaved a melancholic sigh and said, “I’m not joking with you! Not only is Sir Ye’s alchemy talent outstanding, but he’s also even sentimental and righteous. He did not scruple in going up to the Wang Family to plead for your sake. A man like this, which woman won’t be moved? It’s just too bad that he and I are destined to be people of different worlds.”

When Liang Wanru heard these words, she could not help feeling down too.

After all, not only was she a mute, furthermore, she was just a mortal.

To talk about being of different worlds, wasn’t she even more so?

At this time, a knocking sound rang out outside the door. Hong Yin went to open the door to take a look and could not help being inexplicably surprised. The arrival was actually Ye Yuan!

“Sir Ye, you finally exited seclusion! Ah! You ... You ... recovered your strength?” Hong Yin’s small mouth opened into a circle and could not close her mouth for a long time.

She had never heard before that after a martial artist’s divine sea was damaged, they could still recover their strength.

Of course, that was because nobody could refine the One-star Heavenly Mark Pill.

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Yeah, ten years of seclusion, finally achieved some results! These few years, thanks to you for accompanying Miss Wanru to relieve her worries and boredom.”

Hong Yin’s little heart pounded heavily, her gaze that looked towards Ye Yuan was filled with worship.

Hearing that, she hurriedly waved her hands and said, “What’s Sir saying? Wanru and I have long become good friends who tell each other everything already. Her life experiences are pitiful, but her character is extremely good. With such a close friend, it’s also all that I could wish for!”

Liang Wanru saw Ye Yuan enter and went up to welcome joyfully.

When Ye Yuan saw Liang Wanru, he could not help apologizing, “Miss Wanru, these few years, this Ye was in seclusion, leaving you alone out here. Really sorry about it!”

Liang Wanru’s face revealed a smile that had not been seen for ages and shook her head, indicating that she did not mind.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “But exiting seclusion this time, this Ye brought you good news!”

The moment Liang Wanru heard, she could not help becoming doubtful, using a probing gaze to look at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan did not leave her hanging and took out two medicinal pills.

Hong Yin’s gaze turned intent, and she said in astonishment, “Sir Ye, this ... this is Dao Skandha Pill?”

Ye Yuan was rather surprised and said, “You actually recognize the Dao Skandha Pill?”

These two kinds of medicinal pills were not what the average person could see.

Inside the Myriad Treasure Tower, there were absolutely no such medicinal pills.

Because nobody could refine them.

He did not expect that Hong Yin actually recognized these two kinds of medicinal pills.

“It’s really the Dao Skandha Pill! Over 30 years ago, the tower lord requested the Dao Skandha Pill from the higherups before. Hong Yin was fortunate to have seen it before. I didn’t expect that after a time interval of many years, I actually saw it once again. Sir, this was refined by yourself?” Hong Yin asked Ye Yuan in disbelief.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I didn’t refine it, could it be that it fell down from the sky?”

Hong Yin was unbelievably shocked. She knew how difficult the Dao Skandha Pill’s refinement was. Among Jewelhill City’s alchemists, no one was able to refine it at all.

She did not expect that Ye Yuan actually refined it.

“I ... I didn’t mean that,” Hong Yin was aware that she misspoke and hastily said.

Ye Yuan said with a laugh, “Haha, kidding with you, don’t take it seriously.”

Only then did Hong Yin let out a sigh in relief and asked, “Sir, the quality of this Dao Skandha Pill of yours is much better than what I saw that time! Oh, right, this is the Dao Skandha Pill, then the other one ... could it be the Spirit Mending Pill?”

Ye Yuan said with a nod, “Miss Hong Yin is really extremely intelligent! That’s right, it’s precisely the Spirit Mending Pill!”

Hong Yin could not help recalling the big talk Ye Yuan said at the Wang Family. She did not think that he really did it!

Liang Wanru being unable to open her mouth and talk was because within her body was missing a portion of Heavenly Dao.

Want to make up this portion of Heavenly Dao, one required the Spirit Mending Pill.

The effect of this Dao Skandha Pill was to help Liang Wanru be able to break through to the Deity Realm!

In the Immortal Grove World, for people to want to break through to Deity Realm, one must cultivate the heart realm to the Heaven Man Unity grand completion.

Because wanting to break through to the Deity Realm required the heart realm to harmonize Essence, Energy, and Spirit, three paths.

But the Heavenspan World’s powerhouses were able to use divine pills to achieve this sort of effect.

Hence, using divine pills to help martial artists break through to Deity Realm, this was not considered much in the Heavenspan World.

Except, this Dao Skandha Pill’s refining difficulty was tremendous. The average One-star Alchemy God really could not refine it.

Even if they really refined it, the price was also not what the average mortal could afford.

Back then, Ye Yuan said to Wang Lingbo, not only was he going to resolve the Poisonfeather Thousand Night’s poison, he was even going to let Liang Wanru opened her mouth and talk, and let her step foot into Deity Realm.

Now, it was all realized!

No wonder what kind of feeling Wang Lingbo would have when he learned about this news.

...

It was night, a dark shadow flickered and disappeared in the night, entering the Wang Family’s manor.

In front of Wang Lingbo was a black-clothed man in martial outfit.

Regarding the black-clothed man’s appearance, Wang Lingbo was not surprised.

“You came. Could it be that the Myriad Treasure Tower had some new movements?” Wang Lingbo opened his mouth and said coolly.

The black-clothed man had his face covered and could not see his face clearly at all.

“Ye Yuan exited seclusion!” the black-clothed man said.

Wang Lingbo’s eyebrows raised up. A hint of a strange smile flashed across the corners of his mouth, and he said, “That punk finally left seclusion! The humiliation that he brought to my Wang Family must be settled with him properly this time!”

“Heh, his divine sea recovered!” the black-clothed man said meaningfully.

Wang Lingbo’s entire body trembled, his gaze when looking at the black-clothed man was incredible shock.

This news was simply akin to a bolt out of the blue to him!

“He really refined a one-star Heavenly Mark Pill? This is impossible! Absolutely impossible!” Wang Lingbo cried out involuntarily. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The black-clothed man said with a heated gaze: “Does this old man have a need to lie to you? Not only did he refine a one-star Heavenly Spiritual Pill, he even refined a Spirit Mending Pill and a Dao Skandha Pill! Heh, do you feel that your face ... is burning hot?”

Wang Lingbo’s eyes stared wide-eyed. He was shocked by the news that the black-clothed man brought until he was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.

Just as the black-clothed man said, his face was really fiery-hot.

Ten years ago, Ye Yuan saved Liang Wanru. That slap was thrown extremely resoundingly.

Ten years later, Ye Yuan even refined the Spirit Mending Pill and Dao Skandha Pill, completely realizing the vows back then.

Could his face not be burning hot?

Only after a long time did he digest his news. His gaze was cold as he looked at the black-clothed man and said, “You shouldn’t have come this time because you have nothing to do and deliberately came to mock me, right?”

The black-clothed man chuckled and said, “Of course not! Ye Yuan, he wants to go to the Yin Wind Den!”
