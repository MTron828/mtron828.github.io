Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Your Excellency!”

Seeing Ye Yuan being brought away helplessly, the civilians in the city were all weeping.

Quite a few people even directly knelt down, kowtowing in the direction Ye Yuan left.

They understood that Ye Yuan was brought away by these people in order to protect them.

Body cultivating martial artists sealing their vital energy and blood was like sealing the divine sea, unable to display fleshy body power anymore.

Ye Yuan doing so was undoubtedly binding both hands himself, becoming fish on a chopping board, being at people’s mercy.

Bai Chen, Ning Tianping, Leng Qiuling, and the rest shot up one by one, wanting to stop them from leaving.

“Let go of Master!”

“Your Excellency, I won’t let them bring you away!”

...

When Xu Mao saw this scene, his face revealed a cruel smile.

“Halt!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan shouted.

Bai Chen and the rest all stopped their footsteps involuntarily.

Ye Yuan looked at them with an outraged look.

Bai Chen they all had yet to see before this kind of enraged expression on Ye Yuan’s face.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching as he said in a deep voice, “All go back for me! Whoever takes another step forward, don’t say that you know me, Ye Yuan, any longer in the future!”

Everyone’s faces changed and sure enough, did not dare to move anymore. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xu Mao grinned and said, “What a touching scene! But ... willingly be tied up for a bunch of ants, I have got to admit, you’re simply ridiculously foolish.”

Ye Yuan’s expression was calm and did not get angry because of Xu Mao’s mockery. He just said coolly, “Let’s go.”

Just like this, Ye Yuan was brought away under everyone’s watchful gazes.

“Sigh, being able to meet this kind of lord, we really have the good fortune of three lifetimes! If it were other cities, even if we were completely wiped out, it would also be impossible for the city lord to furrow his brows at all, right?”

“His Excellency was brought away, what should ... Heavenly Eagle do from now on?”

“No matter what, I’ll treat Heavenly Eagle as my home in this lifetime!”

...

Ye Yuan saving people by sacrificing his own life made countless martial artists in the city incredibly touched.

The world of martial artists was lonely and also selfish.

However, it was precisely in this selfish world that Ye Yuan’s selflessness could move people even more.

Even though they had just experienced a tribulation, at this moment, these people felt a feeling called home toward Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Inside the City Lord Manor, Bai Chen and the rest bit their lips and gnawed their teeth with bewildered and stumped faces.

They did not know which faction these True God powerhouses came from, but a faction capable of sending out so many True God Realm powerhouses was absolutely not an ordinary faction.

“Really damn it! Damn it! It’s ... It’s all us who are too weak!” Bai Chen said with tears running down his face.

The others were silent.

Even Bai Chen this True God Realm powerhouse was powerless to do anything, so what use could they, these Celestial Deity Realm martial artists, be of?

They already did their utmost to catch up to Ye Yuan’s footsteps, but the gap between them and Ye Yuan became bigger and bigger.

Finally, it could only be up to Ye Yuan to come and protect them.

Just as everyone was at a loss on what to do, a flying figure entered the City Lord Manor.

Thud!

Bai Tong casually threw, throwing a figure onto the ground. Who could it be if not Lu Xin?

The current Lu Xin had his divine sea sealed, lying limp on the ground like a dead dog.

The moment Bai Tong came in, he noticed that the atmosphere was somewhat off and asked with a frown, “What’s wrong? Where’s Ye Yuan?”

No one answered him, the atmosphere within the entire hall was crushing until it made people asphyxiated.

“I’ll kill you!”

Suddenly, Bai Chen exploded, abruptly thrusting a spear towards Lu Xin’s heart.

Bai Tong frowned, sleeves flicking grandly, directly sending Bai Chen’s spear flying.

“Ye Yuan said it before; he wants him alive,” Bai Tong said coolly.

Bai Chen suddenly turned around and roared at Bai Tong, “Master was already captured by them! What’s the use of keeping him alive?”

When Bai Tong heard this, his two eyes narrowed slightly and asked, “With Ye Yuan’s strength, how can those small fries capture him?”

Among the few people, Leng Qiuling was still considered calm. She briefly recounted the events previously, making Bai Tong stunned too.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually do such a thing.

Musing for a moment, Bai Tong said, “Relax, Ye Yuan will be fine. You guys lock him up, I’ll go to Ye Yuan’s aid.”

Everyone trembled all over when they heard it. Ning Tianping hurriedly asked, “Senior, what do you mean?”

Bai Tong said coolly, “You guys are also looking down on Ye Yuan too much. If a few random cats and dogs can capture him away too, he also wouldn’t possibly cause such a big spectacle. Relax, I’ll be right back.”

Finished talking, Bai Tong’s figure moved, vanishing on the spot.

Everyone exchanged glances, their faces involuntarily revealing a look of wild elation.

...

The four great True God Realm powerhouses brought Ye Yuan away, traveling ten thousand miles in a single breath, and already flew god knows how far.

“Xu Mao, this time, if not for you, we’d definitely be completely annihilated!” An assassin buttered him up.

Xu Mao’s expression was slightly dark as he said, “Now’s not the time to be happy yet. Don’t you guys forget, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City still has a Fourth Firmament True God!”

The other three people’s faces changed, the smugness from before immediately swept away cleanly.

They were indeed somewhat dizzy with success just now.

Among the four people, Xu Mao was the leader.

“This ... Then we’d better hurry up and escape. As long as we escape to Goldenwing Imperial Capital, our mission will also be considered as completed!”

Xu Mao nodded and said, “Lord Shadowwind already notified the Goldenwing Branch. They have already sent people to coordinate at the borders. As long as we reach the borders, it will be considered thoroughly safe. But, you guys don’t have to be too worried either. We have this kid in our hands. Even if that person really chases after us, out of fear of implicating him, he won’t dare to do anything to us either.”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s figure paused, coming to a stop.

Xu Mao’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Punk, what do you want to do? I’m warning you, don’t get any lousy ideas. Although upstairs made us not harm your life, if you really push us, it’s hard to say!”

Ye Yuan looked at him, his gaze icy cold as he said, “This place should be far enough from Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, right?”

“Mn? What do you mean?” Xu Mao and the rest were startled inwardly, their gazes revealing a vigilant look.

Suddenly, a golden needle appeared in Ye Yuan’s hand since God knows when. Before everyone came back to their senses, he suddenly stabbed toward his own body with a ghostly speed.

The final needle was directly stabbed onto his Baihui acupoint.

This scene happened too quickly, Xu Mao and the rest completely did not have time to stop it, all turning pale with fright.

“ARGH!” Ye Yuan gave a long cry, his aura suddenly erupting.

Bang!

All of a sudden, powerful vital energy erupted from Ye Yuan’s body. The horrifying pressure made the four great Second Firmament True Gods suddenly change countenance.

Xu Mao looked at this scene in incredible shock as he said in a panic, “This ... how is this possible? I clearly sealed your vital energy and blood personally and watched your vital energy completely fade! You ... How did you do it?”

Sealing vital energy, this was a very safe method.

Even if you had immensely formidable abilities, you could forget about breaking free too.

Otherwise, with Xu Mao’s cunningness, how could he possibly set his mind at ease and bring Ye Yuan out just like this?

But now, Ye Yuan actually broke free of the vital energy and blood seal.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum, it was even several times stronger than before!

Ye Yuan looked at Xu Mao coldly and said in a deep voice, “Golden needle stabbing the acupoint, reversing vital energy and blood, life and death gateway, sudden enlightenment1!”
