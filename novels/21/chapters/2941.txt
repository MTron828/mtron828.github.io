Chapter 2940: Imperishable Inheritance!

“Even major powers like you all couldn’t find him. So how can I, a mere True Sovereign Heaven, find him?” Since he had already been exposed, Ye Yuan naturally could not be bothered to disguise anymore as well and said solemnly.

Cloudneon said coolly, “You don’t think too highly of yourself either. Although according to your performance your soul physique shouldn’t be inferior to Feng Rui, in my view, you’re still of the Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique. As for whether or not you can find him, this seat doesn’t know either. But, at least you all, these Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physiques, have more hope than us.”

The moment Ye Yuan heard this, he understood.

Those who were scouted by the Imperishable Soul Domain were clearly not just him with the Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique.

Cloudneon, these soul race upper echelons, wanted to try whether or not they could establish a trace of connection with Hegemon Imperishable through the Imperishable Soul Physique, thus finding him.

Therefore, Cloudneon, this kind of origin realm mighty expert, would personally move out and go to Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall to fetch him.

He did not expect that the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique that he accidentally awakened actually had such an effect.

It really saved a lot of trouble.

Otherwise, even if he awakened a special soul physique, wanting to come into contact with these secrets was likely not a matter of one or two days either.

“Sure, but I have a condition,” Ye Yuan said.

“You don’t have the qualifications to talk terms. If you don’t agree, this seat will kill you right now,” Cloudneon said without the slightest emotion.

Ye Yuan was speechless. This woman was really impervious to everything!

This was putting it out there: I want to make use of you; you’d better let me take advantage of you properly.

However, no matter how formidable Cloudneon was, she probably also did not expect that his goal was Hegemon Imperishable in the first place, right?

At this point, he could only take things one step at a time.

Suddenly, Cloudneon pointed a finger. Ye Yuan only felt a scorching power spreading throughout his whole body.

His entire person became unable to move anymore.

No idea how long had passed either, Cloudneon withdrew her finger and said coolly, “I’ve already sealed your fetter. Unless Progenitor Imperishable is here, no one can see through you. Alright, you cultivate here. Tomorrow, we’ll set off and head to the Central Soul Region.”

Finished saying, she left straight away.

The Imperishable Soul Domain was huge. It was divided into east, south, west, north, and central, five great regions.

These five great regions were the hubs of the outside world’s continent, each controlling a portion of a region.

Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall was under the rule of the East Soul Region.

Among the five great regions, there were constant disputes.

But this time, in order to find Hegemon Imperishable, the five great regions had joined hands for the first time ever.

… …

In some mysterious space in the East Soul Region, the proud Cloudneon bowed to a big and tall man.

“Lord Wang Ning!”

Wang Ning turned around and said with a smile, “I heard that you accepted a Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique as a disciple when you went out this time?”

This kind of thing naturally could not be hidden.

Cloudneon said, “That’s right. This child is extremely talented and comparable to Feng Rui.”

Wang Ning was rather surprised as he said, “A Pseudo Imperishable Physique can actually be mentioned in the same breath with Feng Rui? Then this time …”

Cloudneon nodded her head and said, “There’s hope!”

Wang Ning was overjoyed as he said, “If you say so, then there’s really hope! Previously, there’s Progenitor Imperishable holding down the fort. The blood race didn’t dare to act rashly without careful consideration. But now, they are already eager to cause trouble! Cloudneon, do you think Progenitor Imperishable he …”

Cloudneon’s eyes flickered slightly, and she said, “Progenitor Imperishable should still be alive, but … his situation is likely not very good. In this world, an existence capable of killing Progenitor Imperishable probably hasn’t been born yet!”

Wang Ning nodded and said, “I think so too! Then who do you think did this to Progenitor Imperishable?”

Cloudneon said, “It might be the blood race. It might also be the … Qi Soul Clan, or … they joined forces! If it’s the last case, then we … have to be careful! But, if they want to trap Progenitor Imperishable, they will definitely pay a huge price too! So for the time being, we’re not in danger. But the night is long and fraught with dreams!”

Wang Ning’s expression turned somber, and he said, “You’re right. This matter can’t be dragged on anymore! This time, we have to find Progenitor Imperishable no matter what!”

… …

On the next day, Cloudneon brought a group of people and set out for the Central Soul Region.

Only then did Ye Yuan know why Cloudneon and Feng Rui looked down on him so much.

Similarly, Pseudo Imperishable Physiques, but there were actually as many as 37!

Just one East Soul Region gathered so many Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physiques.

Then, there would probably be over a hundred Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physiques in the entire Imperishable Soul Domain.

So many Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physiques, reckon that the majority of them were all trash soul physiques.

During normal times, these big shots probably did not even have interests in taking a look.

But now, it was time to use them.

Beside him, “Please reading on N?WN0V?L.0?G”a youth in a white shirt asked rather excitedly,?“Heh,?Brother, you’re of the Pseudo Imperishable Physique too?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “I’m not, I’m …”

“You’re the real Imperishable Soul Physique?” The youth in white satirized to his face.

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said, “How do you know what I was going to say?”

The youth in white laughed loudly and said, “Everyone here says that they are the real Imperishable Soul Physique!”

The others also started laughing in succession.

Ye Yuan was speechless and could not help doubting himself.

Could it be that I’m really of the Pseudo Imperishable Physique?

The youth in the white shirt said proudly, “However, I’m different from you guys! The Imperishable Inheritance this time will definitely belong to me, Bai Cuishan! You all, these people, are merely accessories. That’s all!”

“Oh??How are you different from us?” Ye Yuan asked with a smile.

Bai Cuishan said proudly, “Because I’ve met Progenitor Imperishable before and obtained his elderly self’s guidance before! The Imperishable Inheritance this time was actually opened up specifically for me by his elderly self! After I become Progenitor Imperishable’s disciple, I’ll definitely be able to step into the realm of Hegemon!”

With this, everyone was no longer calm.

Ye Yuan could not resist looking toward Cloudneon.

But he discovered that Cloudneon had an indifferent look and did not show much.

Clearly, she had already known about this a long time ago.

It was just that what Ye Yuan found strange was that these people did not seem to know what opening up the Imperishable Inheritance was for.

Ye Yuan understood this.

After all, the matter of Hegemon Imperishable’s disappearance was a shocking event. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Once the information was leaked, the Imperishable Soul Domain would sink into huge panic.

But why did Cloudneon tell him?

Could it be that in Cloudmount’s eyes, he had even higher hopes of obtaining the inheritance than Bai Cuishan?

Bai Cuishan talked with a look of exultation. It turned out that he was a descendant of an East Soul Region’s major power. Several hundred years ago, Hegemon Imperishable came to find this major power and saw Bai Cuishan in passing.

Seeing that he was of the Pseudo Imperishable Physique, he casually gave a few words of guidance.

Being able to be advised by Hegemon Imperishable, Bai Cuishan was naturally not some amateur.

If it was just a trash soul physique, Hegemon Imperishable definitely would not give pointers.

Giving pointers would be a waste too.

Sure enough, under Hegemon Imperishable’s guidance, Bai Cuishan’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds. Now, he was already an Emperor Realm powerhouse.

The opening up of the Imperishable Inheritance this time, to these Pseudo Imperishable Physiques, they just said that it was in order to deal with the blood race’s invasion and that Hegemon Imperishable wanted to accept a disciple.

Regarding the rest, these people did not know a thing.

When Bai Cuishan finished talking, Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “So that’s how it is! Brother Bai is indeed formidable! Looks like this time, we’re really just playing supporting roles!”
