Chapter 2100: Opposing Heavenly Emperor

“Xin Luo leads everyone to pay respects to Lord Gongyang!”

Below the hall, a crimson-haired middle-aged man led a group of powerhouses wearing priest divine robes and prostrated on the ground, the appearance extremely devout.

Each and every one of these powerhouses had powerful auras. They were all the same, being Empyrean powerhouses.

But in front of Gongyang Lie, this Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, they did not even have the qualification to raise their heads.

Of course, what they were more awestruck by was the High Priest Redplume behind Gongyang Lie!

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s eleven disciples, each one was a leviathan of a region, an existence in charge of a region.

But they were all very puzzled in their hearts. Who was this True God Realm junior standing beside Lord Gongyang?

Which True God Realm junior had the qualifications to stand beside Lord Gongyang?

Could it be a disciple that High Priest Redplume recently took in?

Gongyang Lie waved his sleeves grandly and said coolly, “All come and pay respects to Lord Second Sage.”

Everyone trembled all over, looking at Ye Yuan with disbelieving faces.

“He ... He’s the Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest chose? So young!”

“A mere True God Realm can actually overpower 11 great disciples, what capability does this kid have!”

“Based on what? A punk like this, based on what can he overpower High Priest Redplume? I’m not convinced!”

... ...

Below, a commotion immediately came from the group of Empyreans. Clearly, they were stunned by Gongyang Lie’s introduction.

But after the shock, each and every one of these Empyreans’ faces revealed indignant looks.

Those present were all the Westspirit Region’s elite Seven-star priests. They were all supporters of High Priest Redplume.

If High Priest Redplume’s eldest senior brother, High Priest Cloudcave, was conferred ‘Second Sage’, they naturally would not say anything.

However, Ye Yuan was too young, and his realm was too low.

Such a young man who suddenly appeared wanted to ride on top of High Priest Redplume’s head, how could they be convinced?

The red-haired powerhouse, Xin Luo, bowed and said, “Lord Gongyang, please pardon us for being impolite. This junior in front of us is merely a thousand over years old. His realm is merely late-stage rank six. Letting him become Second Sage, we truly can’t accept it!”

“Yeah, Lord Gongyang! Letting us bow to a junior like this, we’re seriously unconvinced!”

“Lord Gongyang, saying something unpleasant first. If we bow to him, can he afford to accept it?”

... ...

There was a hubbub below. Clearly, they were extremely averse to this Second Sage who suddenly appeared.

High Priest Redplume they all, fellow apprentice brothers, those were all top powerhouses among Heavenly Emperors.

Among Eight-star priests, they were all apex existences.

Even such a top character was unable to become Second Sage, but a junior became Second Sage.

These people did not say certain words out, that was whether or not Sacred Ancestor High Priest was muddle-headed with age.

A few years ago, Sacred Ancestor High Priest announced to the demon race that he was conferring Ye Yuan as Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

No one knew who Ye Yuan was, where he popped out from.

This announcement was vague, only saying that Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength was immensely formidable, and he had once resolved the Eternal Chess Game, ‘Ask Not’.

There was nothing else.

In the beginning, everyone was extremely stunned. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But later, everyone was speculating one after another that Second Sage might be some reclusive powerhouse, an existence on the same level as Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Suddenly coming out and debating on Dao with Sacred Ancestor High Priest and was just a bit inferior, so that was how he was conferred as Second Sage.

But now, a group of Empyreans suddenly saw a True God Realm. Furthermore, it was even a human, becoming Second Sage and being above them. They were unable to accept this kind of thing.

Seeing everyone’s fierce reaction, Gongyang Lie did not get angry but was delighted instead.

Of course, he, an old monster who had lived for no idea how many years, naturally would not show it on his face.

It was only to hear him snorting coldly. He said, “Insolence! How can it be up to you all to butt in about the Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred? Forget about True God Realm, even if a Heaven Glimpse Realm is here, you all have to prostrate in worship too!”

The moment a Heavenly Emperor raged, it was as if the entire hall was quaking.

All of the Empyreans’ faces turned fearful and immediately became silent.

But each and every one of these Empyreans was also an old monster. They caught some unusual meaning from Gongyang Lie’s words.

Lord Gongyang had an implicit meaning!

Sure enough, Gongyang Lie turned to Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Lord Second Sage, your status is noble. Please don’t stoop to the level of a bunch of boorish fellows.”

Ye Yuan sneered coldly in his heart. How could he not understand Gongyang Lie’s thoughts?

Wasn’t acting this out today to take him down a notch?

If it was really some welcoming ceremony, he should have long given these people a heads-up, and not like this right now, everyone having vacant faces, then completely exploding.

With his status of High Priest Redplume’s spokesman and a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, if he were to really forcefully suppress, how could these Empyreans dare to speak?

It would also not be their turn to talk!

The ‘Second Sage’ that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred, even High Priest Redplume did not dare to butt in too.

But his face had never joy nor sorrow as he said with a faint smile, “Huhu, I’m going to stoop to their level today!”

As Ye Yuan smiled, the aura on his body suddenly flared, immediately having a feeling of looking down upon the world.

Gongyang Lie’s expression changed. He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s reaction would actually be so intense.

He thought that with so many Empyrean powerhouses, plus him, this Heavenly Emperor powerhouse who lorded over all life, wouldn’t toying with a measly little Ye Yuan still be easily done ?

But Ye Yuan did not play games with him at all!

Was this Ye Yuan in front of him who looked down upon the world really that True God Realm kid?

Gongyang Lie’s eyes could not help going into a trance.

“Gongyang Lie, you don’t need to play this kind of outwardly compliant, but inwardly opposing game with me! The demon race has always been lofty and straightforward. If you’re unconvinced by me, just say it right out, don’t need to incite them to come and squeeze me. You’ve taken human form for too long and are about to lose even your ancestor’s guts too, right?” Ye Yuan questioned.

Gongyang Lie’s face turned black, nearly spewing out a mouthful of old blood.

Ye Yuan really did not save him any face when opposing him, this Heavenly Emperor.

If any junior dared to talk to him like this, they would have long been beaten to death by him with a sneeze.

Yet, this in front of him was the Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred, who dared to touch him?

Him playing a bit of petty tricks in secret was still okay, but to really take action, that was a big no-no for him.

“This emperor ... this emperor is unconvinced! Can you, a measly little True God Realm, shoulder the name of Second Sage?” Gongyang Lie was angered until his face reddened to the ears as he said.

Below, those Empyrean powerhouses were long already staring dumbfoundedly.

A True God Realm who dared to oppose a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse; they had lived for several million years, it was still really their first time seeing.

These two realms were people of two completely different worlds!

Forget about True God Realm, even Empyrean Realm, a Heavenly Emperor could also smack him to death with one slap.

With Gongyang Lie’s realm, if he really wanted to kill Ye Yuan, he would not even need a finger.

Ye Yuan this Second Sage, was really extraordinary!

“Hahaha ...”

Hearing Gongyang Lie’s words, Ye Yuan suddenly laughed loudly and said, “Gongyang Lie, do you feel that Sacred Ancestor High Priest is muddle-headed with age?”

Gongyang Lie’s face changed and he said in alarm and anger, “You ... You’re spurting nonsense! Why would ... Why would this emperor have this kind of thought!”

Ye Yuan smiled indifferently and said, “Don’t need to hide it. I know that not only you think so, but they also think so! But let me tell you this. I’m indeed not High Priest Redplume’s match right now. But before long, I’ll surpass him!”
