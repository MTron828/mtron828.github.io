Chapter 2498: Unreasonable!

The entire world fell deathly silent.

Only the blood from Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s mouth gurgled as it kept flowing.

His injuries were extremely serious, he was only left with a breath.

Lin Chaotian’s fire-attribute power of rule was ravaging his body wantonly.

“This … This is also too strong!”

“It’s over, Heavenspan World’s arrangement will really be changing in the future!”

“Damn it! In the future, we can only submit to him!”

“Lord Saint Azure was too wilful! He was actually not willing to become a Dao Ancestor. So how can he possibly be Lin Chaotian’s match?”

… …

Hearing everyone’s discussion, Lin Chaotian was seriously pleased with himself.

He understood awe and fear, these two words, very well. Since ‘awe’ could not be achieved, then let people ‘fear.’

Strength was everything!

Time passed little by little. Very soon, the fourth passageway lit up.

Yue Mengli walked out of it!

Currently, her body was augmented by wind rule. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She already became Dao Ancestor Storm!

Her appearance naturally added a powerful balancing weight to the divine race.

Two mighty Ten-marks powerhouses became Dao Ancestors at the same time, the human race would naturally have a hard time.

Of course, this was not the main point.

The main point was, there was still internal strife on the human race’s side!

When Yue Mengli saw the seriously injured Sacred Ancestor High Priest, her brows could not help furrowing slightly.

Arriving at Tian Qing’s side, Tian Qing whispered a few words in her ear. She could not help revealing a look of surprise, looking towards Lin Chaotian.

Before long, the fifth Dao Ancestor appeared.

The fifth Dao Ancestor was still the divine race.

The Earth Lineage’s Bo Yi became Dao Ancestor Darkness.

The sixth Dao Ancestor was still the divine race!

The Profound Lineage’s progenitor, Originsmile, became Dao Ancestor Earth.

At this point, the divine race already occupied four out of the nine great Dao Ancestors!

Humanity’s two great Dao Ancestors still had one who was seriously injured on the verge of death!

Humanity’s powerhouses virtually lost all hope.

Even Lin Chaotian’s expression did not look good either.

It was true that he was strong, but if this situation continued developing at this rate, it would be difficult for him to salvage the situation alone!

Tian Qing and Yue Mengli were both existences not inferior to him.

Furthermore, the divine race’s progenitors were extremely powerful in their own right.

Becoming Dao Ancestors again, their strength soared. It was not what humanity could compare to at all.

Soon after, the seventh Dao Ancestor appeared!

This time, it was finally humanity’s turn!

However, this seventh Dao Ancestor exceeded everyone’s expectations. He was not a former Dao Ancestor, but a newcomer!

This person was originally Ancestor Fire’s subordinate called Wang Cheng.

He did not expect that with Ancestor Fire’s fall, Wang Cheng actually became Dao Ancestor Lightning!

Having just become a Dao Ancestor, Wang Cheng was full of high spirits too.

But right at this time, Lin Chaotian opened his mouth.

“Wang Cheng, from now on, I reign supreme over the human race! Come over and offer greetings to this ancestor, or … die!” Lin Chaotian said coolly.

Wang Cheng’s expression changed and he instinctively wanted to blow his top.

He already became a Dao Ancestor and actually still had to be a dog for Lin Chaotian?

But right then, he saw the injured Sacred Ancestor High Priest not far away from Lin Chaotian, and his pupils could not help shrinking.

How could he not tell that Sacred Ancestor High Priest already corroborated his Dao and became ancestor?

But he was actually beaten until like this!

Furthermore, Sacred Ancestor High Priest was even a grand ancestor who corroborated his Dao, his strength significantly stronger than his.

Linking it to Lin Chaotian’s relationship with Ye Yuan, Wang Cheng immediately hesitated.

Seeing Wang Cheng hesitated, Lin Chaotian said with a cold snort, “You don’t need to have any doubts. He was taken down by this ancestor! If you don’t believe me, you can come and give it a try too.”

Wang Cheng’s expression changed wildly, already having a plan in his heart. He smiled awkwardly and said, “Y-You got to be kidding! You’re a senior, unifying the human race is ought to be! From now on, Wang Cheng will follow Dao Ancestor Firespirit’s lead!”

Finished saying, he arrived in front of Lin Chaotian with a flash and bowed in salute.

Lin Chaotian revealed a playful look and said, “At least you’re sensible!”

Wang Cheng said with a flattering expression,?“Huhu,?even the Ancestor Fire back then wasn’t Brother Chaotian’s match too. I, this junior, newly corroborated my Dao and took the position of Dao Ancestor. How can I dare to be impudent in front of you?”

This Wang Cheng already treated himself as Lin Chaotian’s lackey very consciously.

As for everyone’s contemptuous gazes, he directly ignored it.

What did the scorn of ants count for?

Although the present situation was very different from what he expected, he was invincible under Lin Chaotian!

Wang Cheng was a clever person and also a sly person.

He understood that now, the situation was already not what it used to be.

Times had already changed!

Dao Ancestors might not be able to disregard everything too!

Putting Lin Chaotian aside, those few divine race Dao Ancestors opposite, any random one that came out could trample on him!

Finding a powerful backer was naturally the most reliable.

Lin Chaotian nodded his head with satisfaction and said,?“Mn,?a lot of the people around Ye Yuan have already come out. Go and get them all docile and obedient! When Ye Yuan comes out, this ancestor will make you regret being born in this world!”

Wang Cheng’s eyes lit up and he said, “Brother Chaotian is mighty!”

Currently, Long Yi, Bai Chen, and the rest, already came out of the Heavenspan Mountain.

Seeing Lin Chaotian’s domineering appearance, each and every one of them dared to get angry but did not dare to speak.

At the same time, they faintly started to get worried.

After all, the current Lin Chaotian was too strong!

Reaching Dao Ancestor this realm, even improving one’s strength by a tiny bit was extremely difficult.

It was true that Ye Yuan was strong.

But he had also reached the bottleneck.

Could he still surpass Lin Chaotian?

Wang Cheng having received the order, looking toward Long Yi and the rest with ill-intent. The expressions of the latter changed greatly.

… …

In the Heavenspan Mountain, a powerful rule power suddenly descended.

Feeling this vast rule power, they were all moved.

The might of this power made them not dare to look directly at it!

“Is this spatial rule? Indeed ridiculously strong! It feels like within this space, His Excellency can kill me with a single thought!” Pang Zhen exclaimed.

Profound Secrets had a shocked face as he said, “Back then, when Senior Shang Hang corroborated his Dao as a grand ancestor, the undulations were also not so strong! Looks like he really has hope of defeating Lin Chaotian!”

When the trio saw this intense rule undulation, they could not help becoming more hopeful.

But right at this time, another power of rule descended!

Pang Zhen was dumbstruck with amazement and said, “T-Time rule! When did power of rules become so easy to comprehend?”

Laws reaching rule, this step seemed to only be a difference of a word.

But the effort and time required could not be calculated at all.

Too difficult!!

For ten billion years, no one had been able to step into the realm of rule!

Just based on this, it was sufficient to explain everything.

But Ye Yuan broke through two great power of rules at the same time in a short one month’s time!

Such freakishness, even if they understood Ye Yuan extremely well, they were also shocked speechless.

Furthermore, the two great rules that Ye Yuan comprehended, were even the supreme laws, time and space, two great laws!

However, his voice had yet to fade when dense auspicious clouds gathered above the gray fog!

Another two power of rules!

The three people exchanged glances, already unable to describe the shock in their hearts currently.

Four power of rules!

“This … This is really unreasonable! Time, space, Formation Dao, Alchemy Dao, four great rules breaking through at the same time. This is really unprecedented and unrepeatable!”

Even with Wan Zhen’s calm personality, he was also dumbstruck with amazement by Ye Yuan at this time.
