Chapter 2854 The Beauty Is Betrothed!

“Old Fart Cloudmount, you really picked up a treasure! I didn’t expect that this kid is actually so monstrous, entering profound grade at grade five realm.”

Hegemon Cloudmount’s face was full of smugness, but he said, “He’s a little talented, but him being able to break through to profound grade so quickly, that’s all due to my credit!”

The other Hegemons shut up very sensibly.

This guy was unbelievably pretentious!

Back then, when Hegemon Pinespring advanced to Hegemon Realm, this old man showed off so much, wanting the whole world to know.

These people were victims of it.

It was also that the war had erupted now. Otherwise, this old thing would definitely show off again this time, making sure the whole world knew.

They had never heard before of a grade five realm profound grade expert!

When these Hegemons heard this news, they were naturally inexplicably shocked in his hearts.

Grade six realm profound grade experts would still emerge occasionally, whether or not they could become Hegemons, just as Lu Daoyi.

But grade five realm profound grade experts were unheard of!

“Hahaha … You all these fellows, in spite of how each and every one of you put on airs, you’re really inferior to me, Cloudmount, in teaching disciples! This time, this seat is going to coach a divergent cultivator Hegemon Realm!”

“Not that I’m saying you guys, us old things might not be able to make any improvements in ten thousand years. Why not spend more effort on teaching disciples? Produce a few more Hegemons and we wouldn’t have to toil so hard anymore either!” “… …”

Just you show off, can’t we just ignore you?

Could Hegemon Realms be coached?

If they could be coached, then Heaven One Continent would not have ended up in this plight too!

Seeing everyone remain quiet, Cloudmount smiled and said, “Pinespring, what do you think? This brat’s talent really surpasses yours!”

Zhou Pinespring said, “Whether it’s success or failure, it still has to depend on afterward!”

Cloudmount smiled and said, “Huhu, it looks like you’re jealous too! Indeed, for so many years, it’s not that there were none who surpassed you at grade six realm, but later, they all faded into the crowd. But this little junior brother of yours, I feel very optimistic about him!”

Zhou Pinespring smiled and said, “What Master said is right. This disciple is indeed a little jealous in my heart! However, in this present situation, if Little Junior Brother can reach the Hegemon Realm, it will indeed be a great thing to us!”

Cloudmount chuckled and said, “Those juniors in the sect have probably all gone crazy from fighting now, right? But they all don’t know that this kid has already been claimed! When they discover Ye Yuan’s identity, their expressions must be very fascinating, right? Hahaha …”

“Ye Yuan, this seat is the sect master’s senior apprentice brother. My seniority is the highest in the sect! If you acknowledge me as your master, you’ll be able to obtain unimaginable benefits!”

“Don’t listen to him. This old punk’s strength is too weak. That’s why he has to guard here in the Scripture Library! I’m different. I’m the strongest one other than Sect Master! If you acknowledge me as your master, you can obtain countless resources! Ye Yuan, in the path of cultivation, one mustn’t just rely only on talent. One should rely on resources more!”

“What bullshit resources do you have? Ye Yuan, this seat is in charge of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s alchemy resources. As long as it’s heavenly medicines that you need, there’s nothing that this seat can’t get! It’s tremendously beneficial to you if you acknowledge me as your master!”

……

Five alchemy path powerhouses were currently surrounding Ye Yuan.

These five people were the five people with the most illustrious authority in the Extreme Medicine Sect apart from Song Qingyang!

Fan Li was Song Qingyang’s senior apprentice brother, but among these five people, he did not have much advantage instead.

Of course, those Emperor Realm powerhouses on the Scripture Library’s sixth floor were all chased out.

It was better for this scene in front of them to not be seen by people.

Miao Chuan and Fan Li were the closest, but currently, Fan Li was glaring at Miao Chuan fiercely, as if going to tear him into two.

It was because Miao Chuang was his greatest competitor in fighting for this disciple!

As for the disdain at the beginning, it was long already tossed beyond the ninth layer of heaven by them!

This kind of disciple was hard to come across in ten thousand years!

Ye Yuan swept a glance and suddenly smiled and said, “Ancestors, why didn’t Sect Master come?”

At virtually the same time, the five people’s expressions turned black.

Why? Looking down on the few of us?

You punk, you’re too full of yourself! One should know, even when Hegemon Pinespring was unrivaledly talented back then, when he was at Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm, no one showed any interest in him either!

“Huhu, don’t misunderstand my words. My meaning is … the few of you probably don’t have the qualifications to take me in as a disciple!” Ye Yuan continued.

The five people exploded at once.

Brat, you’re really full of yourself!

In this Extreme Medicine Sect, apart from the few of us, who else had the qualifications to take you in as a disciple?

But in the next second, the expressions on their faces instantly became fascinating to the extreme!

It was because a small and exquisite jade sword appeared in Ye Yuan’s hand since no idea when.

The Extreme Light Jade Sword!

Why would this puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven have the Extreme Light Jade Sword?

An Extreme Light Jade Sword was something that only the Extreme Light Pavilion’s elders had!

Thinking up to here, the five people could not help shuddering!

To think that this one in front of them was actually an Extreme Light Pavilion Elder? This … How was this possible? Fan Li’s expression was ugly to the extreme as he said ferociously, “Song Qingyang you bastard, to actually dare scam Your Father!” “Song Qingyang, you’ll give birth to a son without an anus!” “Song Qingyang, fuck you!”

… …

The few people practically burst out swearing at the same time.

Very clearly, Song Qingyang knew about this. But he did not warn them.

Logically speaking, after Ye Yuan did such an astonishing thing, Song Qingyang should have come over right away. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But he did not!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Martial Nephews, it’s not that Sect Master had the intention to hide it. This was what Master instructed. The few of you are all the Extreme Medicine Sect’s upper echelons. Please don’t spread this matter!”

Master?

Who was this boy’s master?

Fan Li’s expression was embarrassed as he said, “Pavilion … Elder Ye, may I ask … your master is …”

“Hegemon Cloudmount!”

The five people were collectively speechless!

They thought that this was probably Hegemon Pinespring’s disciple. That was why he had the qualifications to enter the Extreme Light Pavilion.

Who knew that he was actually Hegemon Cloudmount’s disciple!

Hegemon Cloudmount had already not accepted a disciple for over 100 thousand years!

“P-Paying respects to Little Martial Uncle!”

The five people gave Ye Yuan a deep bow while having fascinating expressions.

It was too much of a freaking scam!

……

On the other side, Zhu Yan and the rest were sitting on pins and needles, their expressions similarly very fascinating.

After getting this news, their reactions were virtually cut from the same cloth as Emperor Qin Shan that side.

Collectively petrified!

Too impressive!

Impressive until they were unable to digest it in a short time! “It turns out that what Little Junior Brother said was true!” Zhu Yan’s face was full of bitterness as he said.

Lu Daoyi was really too weak!

Not just Lu Daoyi, even he, Zhu Yan, was similarly too weak!

When Ye Yuan said this, they scoffed in derision and were full of disdain.

But, when Ye Yuan broke through to profound grade, everything became a matter of course!

Hua Zong similarly smiled bitterly and said, “No wonder Little Junior Brother couldn’t be bothered to take action. Lu Daoyi can’t muster up his interest at all! In our view, Lu Daoyi is amazingly talented. But in Little Junior Brother’s view, he’s not worth mentioning at all! What … have we done?!”

Zhu Yan smiled bitterly and said, “After Little Junior Brother exits seclusion, I’ll personally admit my mistake and apologize! Us senior apprentice brothers are too unqualified!”
