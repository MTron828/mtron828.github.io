Chapter 2600: Secretly Learning

“Universe!”

“Dual Polarity!”

“Four Symbols!”

… …

Ye Yuan’s sword art swept out one move after another. However, facing the suppression of six great experts, Ye Yuan was still somewhat in a strained situation.

Especially facing the fourth place Zhao Chendong, he gave Ye Yuan tremendous pressure.

The experts of the Land of Exile, their talent might not be as strong as the outside world’s experts.

But the slaughter that they experienced shook the outside world powerhouses off by more than ten streets!

Fighting was already fused in their blood.

In this place, not fighting meant death!

That Zhao Chendong used the sword too. But the path that he took was extremely different from others.

Each time he unleashed a sword strike, it was like an old lady swinging a sword. It was unbelievably slow.

However, each of his slashes would appear at your most uncomfortable place.

Seemingly slow, but in reality fast!

With regards to Zhao Chendong, Ye Yuan was incomparably surprised too.

He deduced the Dao of Fast and Slow of sword art to the extreme!

Just a quick sword naturally did not count as anything.

But the Dao of Fast and Slow was similarly a perfect cycle!

In other words, Zhao Chendong’s sword technique was similarly a deduction of Great Dao!

The Great Dao of Universe was integrated into Ye Yuan’s sword art, being all-encompassing. It was naturally stronger than Zhao Chendong’s.

It was just that the others were not easy to deal with either, and could compensate for Zhao Chendong’s inadequacies very well.

Ye Yuan fell into a bitter fight.

However, this scene still shocked everyone.

“His sword technique is actually even stronger than Zhao Chendong’s!”

“This boy is fighting six people by himself. His strength can probably squeeze into the top three already!”

“When did Martial Secure Heavenly Sect produce such a monster?”

… …

In the beginning, Ye Yuan’s action was just talking big to impress people in everyone’s eyes.

But now, no one went to laugh at him anymore.

Even if he could not rival six people, his strength obtained sufficient proof too.

In the crowd, two figures were currently chatting about something.

A man in black clothing said,?“Huhu,?I was wondering how capable he was. It looks like it’s only this and nothing more too.”

Beside him, a man in green clothes stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly, “His strength shouldn’t be just this.”

The man in black said in surprise, “How so?”

The man in green clothing said, “To dare provoke the powerhouses in the entire city like this, it’s either a fool or their strength is extremely formidable! You look at his appearance. Does he look like a fool?”

The man in black frowned and said, “You’re saying that he’s the same as us, grasping two or more power of rules? But he doesn’t have the advantage right now. Why doesn’t he use his full strength yet?”

The man in green smiled and said, “He’s naturally tempering his sword art! Regarding Zhao Chendong six people’s strength, they are neither high nor low. They are just nicely a piece of decent whetting stone! And this is probably precisely his goal of coming to the Land of Exile, right?”

The man in black said disdainfully, “Just the likes of a sect disciple also has this thinking and strength? I don’t believe it! This Land of Exile, how many sect disciples have come in to train before? Didn’t they all become deceased souls under our blades? This boy is naturally no exception either.”

The man in green smiled and did not speak.

Amidst the fierce fighting, Ye Yuan’s sword seemed to be getting slower and slower.

That tempo showed some signs of approaching Zhao Chendong.

And this change made the originally unassailable Universe actually reveal quite a number of flaws.

Ye Yuan also suffered quite a few injuries because of this.

How could Zhao Chendong not understand Ye Yuan’s thoughts? He then said disdainfully, “Imitating others and losing one’s own individuality, incurring the ridicule of experts! This sword art was only honed through my countless life and death instances, how could it be learned overnight?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Heh,?this is sharpening one’s spear on the eve of battle, don’t you feel that it’s too late?” Ling Bu also said with a cold smile.

With regards to Ye Yuan’s approaching of ‘secretly learning’, everyone turned their noses up in disdain.

But to the six great experts, they were naturally happy to see it happen.

They just had to kill the opponent. As for how he died, they did not care.

The most worthless thing in this place was human lives.

Ye Yuan’s Universe was all-inclusive. But it was just a framework.

The more things contained in Universe, the more complex it would be, and the stronger it would get!

Zhao Chendong’s Dao of Fast and Slow undoubtedly gave Ye Yuan a new train of thought.

Integrating Fast and Slow Sword Dao into Universe would definitely greatly increase its power.

But saying and doing were two different things.

Just as Zhao Chendong said, this was only honed through his countless life and death instances, how could it be comprehended so easily?

Let alone that he even had to fuse it into the Universe Sword Dao.

But Zhao Chendong still underestimated Ye Yuan!

His Universe Sword Dao was extremely high level to begin with and Fast and Slow Sword Dao was just a part of it.

Operating from a strategically advantageous position, it was not far beyond reach for Ye Yuan to comprehend it.

Coupled with that this kind of comprehension amidst life and death forced Ye Yuan to do his utmost.

Ye Yuan’s Universe was gradually started reaching grand completion again!

Zhao Chendong had clearly detected Ye Yuan’s transformation too. His expression changed wildly as he said, “Not good! This guy’s Sword Dao is going to be perfected even more! This brat is going to defy the heavens!”

Ye Yuan was riddled with wounds, but a faint smile hung on his face as he said, “Imitating others and losing one’s own individuality is it??Huhu,?looking on the account of the Fast and Slow Sword Dao, I’ll spare your lives!”

Great Dao returning to one!

All of a sudden, Ye Yuan’s sword light radiated brilliantly.

It was still that Universe, but there was the additional change of fast and slow tempo in it!

This sword was truly strange to the extreme.

Zhao Chendong and the rest unleashed all of their abilities and were unable to block the edge of this sword too.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

The six people were directly struck by the sword light and flew out.

One sword defeating six powerhouses!

When the man in black saw this scene, he was immediately stunned.

“This … Is this guy a freak? Secretly learning in the midst of battle and integrating it into his own Sword Dao! Freaking hell, this is also too monstrous!”

A hint of surprise flashed across in the eyes of the man in azure clothes too and he said, “Such astonishing comprehension ability! Although his Sword Dao was stronger than Zhao Chendong’s, Fast and Slow Sword Dao is another facet of Sword Dao. It doesn’t just link with his Sword Dao! He can actually comprehend the Sword Dao within such a short time and fuse it into his own Sword Dao! Truly monstrous!”

In his view, Ye Yuan was planning on using these few people to temper his Sword Dao, and then to use his trump card to defeat the opponents in the end.

Who knew that Ye Yuan directly comprehended Sword Dao in the middle of the fight!

The man in black said, “He Yunxiang, it’s your turn to take the stage! If you lose to him, I’ll directly surrender!”

This man in black was none other than precisely Resplendent Sun City’s rank three, Di Xing.

And the man in green was the second place He Yunxiang.

He Yunxiang did not speak. Walking out of the crowd, he walked straight toward Ye Yuan.

Di Xing chuckled and said, “Looks like it’s another fierce struggle between two evenly-matched opponents! If it’s He Yunxiang, he should be able to force out all of his strength, right?”

He Yunxiang coming in front of Ye Yuan immediately caused a commotion!

“It’s He Yunxiang! There’s a good show to watch now!”

“He Yunxiang fused two kinds of power of rules. His combat power is unparalleled! I wonder; between him and this boy, who’s stronger?”

“Rubbish! Of course it’s He Yunxiang! You have to know, he’s a powerhouse who has been a city lord before! If not for Changsun Xingyu’s sudden emergence later on, he’d be this Resplendent Sun City’s number one!”
