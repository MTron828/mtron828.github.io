Chapter 3013: The Power of Chaos Divine Essence!

“This … How is this possible? The two of them had a frontal confrontation, and Long Hui actually fell into a disadvantageous position?”

“What a joke! Long Hui is Emperor Vast Heaven, and he actually can’t win against an Emperor Cloud Heaven?”

“Furthermore, Ye Yuan didn’t use a martial technique at all. It’s just divine essence erupting! This … This is too strong!”

“Could it be that this is the power of the Eternal River’s chaos? I-Is it really so strong?”

… …

The surrounding crowd seethed with excitement at once.

This result was seriously too unexpected!

Emperor Cloud Heaven Ye Yuan who did not even use any martial technique directly blew the Emperor Vast Heaven Long Hui away!

This kind of combat strength simply subverted everyone’s understanding of cultivation realm.

Even Ye Yuan himself was also quite surprised.

He had long felt the power of the chaos divine essence but did not think that it was so strong.

In the process of cultivation, Ye Yuan already experienced that his chaos divine essence was extremely thick and solid.

It seemed like that was the most authentic appearance of energy!

Actually, thinking about it, Ye Yuan felt at ease too.

Chaos gave birth to all things. Even if it was a high-level plane like Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, the heaven and earth spiritual energy that was derived from chaos was also countless times thinner.

Long Hai’s laughter cut off abruptly. He looked at Ye Yuan with a look of astonishment, full of disbelief.

“S-So strong?” Long Hai felt somewhat parched.

Long Jian glanced at him and said coolly, “He isn’t looking down on the divine race. He’s just testing the power of the chaos divine essence. Most likely, even he himself is very surprised too, right?”

Long Hai’s gaze became slightly intent, and he said, “Long Jian, I say, if we …”

Long Jian naturally understood what he meant. Giving him a glance, he said coolly, “Do you dare to scatter your cultivation?”

Long Hai was dumbfounded.

A Supreme Hegemon scattering his cultivation, cultivating from scratch again?

You had got to be kidding!

The risk of scattering one’s cultivation was too great!

Ye Yuan cultivated chaos and had a grand awakening. What about him?

If he dared to scatter his cultivation, his Dao heart would most likely collapse, his cultivation being ruined overnight!

Therefore, there was no chance!

But, when Long Hai saw the power of the chaos divine essence, he really coveted it to the extreme!

If he turned the divine essence in his body into chaos divine essence, even if facing off against a Great Beyond powerhouse, he absolutely would not be at a disadvantageous position too!

While Long Hui was ashamed and resentful to the extreme, it was too humiliating!

He was Emperor Vast Heaven!

No matter what reason, losing to an Emperor Cloud Heaven under the situation where it was a frontal confrontation, it was something unacceptable.

“ARGH!

?Go and die for me!”

Long Hui bellowed, Emperor Vast Heaven Realm erupting completely, clashing together with Ye Yuan.

Bang, bang, bang?…

As if having agreed to it, the two people both did not utilize powerful martial techniques. Both chose to fight to the bitter end!

Long Hui wanted face. Ye Yuan did not even utilize martial techniques. So did he have the face to use them?

But the outcome of wanting face was very tragic.

Ye Yuan threw one punch after another against him, shocking until his innards were almost exploding!

In an instant, Long Hui experienced an illusion.

What he was facing was not an Emperor Cloud Heaven but an Emperor Sakra Heaven!

No matter how he erupted, he was suppressed mercilessly!

During the first ten moves, he could still barely manage to hold out. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After ten moves, he spurted fresh blood wildly.

With each exchange, a large mouthful of blood would be spurted.

With one exchange, another large mouthful of blood was spurted.

During the 17th move, Long Hui spurted seven large mouthfuls of blood in a row, having a fist slammed onto his chest.

Long Hui was defeated!

Long He could not bear to look straight at it and said with a sigh, “Long Hui this guy, his face is still too thin! Keeping up appearances to cover up his predicament!”

The others nodded one after another, deeply feeling that way too.

Please, already being shameless, what did you still want face for?

If you were not a match in a frontal confrontation, didn’t you freaking know how to use your ultimate move?

Done fighting a battle, Ye Yuan felt refreshed, his condition reaching its peak. He actually felt an impulse to be itching to have a go.

This kind of clash was very refreshing.

When everyone saw it, they could not help being speechless.

This guy got addicted to fighting!

However, with just this fight, no one dared to underestimate him anymore.

Chaos divine essence was too impressive!

The current Ye Yuan absolutely had the capital to have a fight with Emperor Vast Heavens!

“Actually, I also really want to test the power of chaos divine essence. Just nice, you guys came knocking on the door. Just take it as letting me try it out. Who’s next?” Ye Yuan said excitedly.

“Me!” Chao Feng Clan’s young patriarch, Long Zhu, stepped forward.

“Alright, I’m coming!”

With a swoosh, Ye Yuan directly disappeared.

Long Zhe’s expression changed drastically, the power of rules surging. A hurricane rose from the ground up.

His figure also immediately dissipated where he stood.

All of a sudden, countless sword lights swiped the sky.

Sword rain that filled the sky, completely locking down this region of space.

Amidst the sword rain, a fierce gale surged, sounds of metal clashing emitting from time to time.

It seemed like that gust of wild wind wanted to break free from the constraints of the sword rain, but no matter what he did, he could not break free.

The Universe Sword Formation was like a steel shackle, locking the hurricane inside that area of space.

“Too strong! This chaos divine essence increased the power of the sword formation by at least several dozen times!”

“Long Zhu has already unleashed all of his means, but there’s completely no chance!”

“No, Long Zhu still has a last resort! It looks like he’s going to use it!”

… …

Before the voice faded, an aura of chaos erupted from the sword formation.

“Heavenly River Outbreak!”

It was only to hear Long Zhu roar inside the Sword Formation. The sword formation emitted a burst of sound that was extremely grating on the ears.

Two extremely strong forces tore space to shreds.

What the Chao Wind Clan inherited was the talent of wind.

As the young patriarch, Long Zhu naturally inherited a chaos innate divine ability too.

This move, Heavenly River Outbreak, was the chaos innate divine ability!

When Long Zhu stepped into the realm of Hegemon in the future, if this move shattered the void, slaughtering tens of thousands of people would be a cinch too.

However, what disappointed people was that the sword formation did not budge an inch!

The expressions of the other eight great young patriarchs changed over and over again, already feeling shocked to the extreme.

Previously, they said that they wanted to witness the power of the chaos divine essence.

Now, they saw it.

This was a might that had no weakness to exploit!

The other few people were a little stronger than Long Zhu, but they were not much stronger too.

They touched their own hearts and felt that being inside this sword formation, they would simply be at the end of their rope!

Chaos innate divine ability was their final pride.

But, after using the final pride, he could not even make the sword formation waver a little.

This was too demoralizing!

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Only to hear a series of scratching sounds that were grating on the ears coming out of the sword formation.

Those swords seemingly sliced on their bodies.

Thud!

Long Zhu fell to the ground powerlessly, without the strength to fight anymore.

The whole place was deathly silent.

Ye Yuan withdrew his divine ability, very satisfied with the power of the Universe Sword Formation.

If not for chaos divine essence, Ye Yuan’s Universe Sword Formation would have crumbled in one exchange.

The strength of the dragon race’s young patriarch was not for show.

But, under chaos divine essence, the Universe Sword Formation was as steady as Mount Tai!

Even if Long Zhu used Heavenly River Outbreak, the Universe Sword Formation was as unmoving as a mountain too!

Long Hai opened his mouth wide. The heat in his eyes could not be hidden no matter what.

“L-Long Jian, do we really have no chance? I … I’m unwilling!” Long Hai gnashed his teeth and said.

Long Jian’s two eyes were blood-red too. He wished to scatter his cultivation right away now, and then acknowledge Ye Yuan as master.

This chaos divine essence was really too strong!

“No way! Can’t be impulsive! Scattering cultivation will kill you!” Long Jian urged Long Hai non-stop, as well as telling this to himself.
