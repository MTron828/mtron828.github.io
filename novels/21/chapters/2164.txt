Chapter 2168: Cultivate? Doesn’t Exist!

“This ... The second awakening Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter actually can’t beat the Grand Universe Palm?”

“This guy was actually still holding back when he exchanged blows with Long Zheng!”

“When did the dragon race’s innate divine abilities become so weak that it can’t withstand even a single blow?”

... ...

The group of heavenly emperors was rendered speechless. Was Ye Yuan planning on using Universe Dragon Claw this move to sweep across the Mist Battlefield?

Furthermore, the strength that Ye Yuan displayed was clearly a great deal stronger than that time with Long Zheng.

If Ye Yuan unleashed this kind of power when facing off with Long Zheng, Long Zheng would have long been smacked to death by him with one palm.

“Hehehe ... Elder Tianyu, didn’t you say that Ye Yuan doesn’t have any chances of victory? What about now?” Long Xiaochun laughed loudly and said to Long Tianyu.

Long Tianyu’s old face turned red, and he argued, “You saw it earlier too. Ao Yu still has Boundless Big Dipper Fist, this trump card, that hasn’t been used. That’s a true major trump card!”

Long Xiaochun’s mouth curled and she said disdainfully, “Humph! Do you think that Ye Yuan has no trump cards? Wait and see!”

... ...

Ao Yu crawled out from underneath the ground, covered in blood all over.

Ye Yuan’s Grand Universe Palm earlier did not hold back. Ao Yu’s injuries were naturally much heavier than Long Zheng’s.

Ao Yu looked at Ye Yuan, his eyes full of wrath and puzzlement.

He did not know that Ye Yuan’s fight with Long Zheng had long already shocked the outside world’s heavenly emperor powerhouses.

He still thought that with his current strength, he could casually crush Ye Yuan underfoot.

He did not expect that the moment he made his move, he was trampled on by Ye Yuan.

“Yo, can still get up, not bad,” Ye Yuan looked at Ao Yu and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Ao Yu’s two eyes were blood-red as he roared angrily, “Damn thing! You forced me! Now, I’ll turn you to ashes!”

He withdrew his fist momentum and condensed the spirit of a true dragon behind him once more.

But the spirit of the true dragon this time was more than several times more solid compared to before.

He had not made his move yet and the surrounding space seemingly solidified.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, his pupils also constricted slightly, revealing a solemn expression.

It seemed like this guy wasn’t a complete braggart either.

Just based on this move, it was not a difficult matter for the current Ao Yu to annihilate a Second Firmament Empyrean too!

“Boundless Big Dipper Fist? Indeed have some degrees of alikeness! It’s just too bad that you’re still far too lacking!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ao Yu said with a cold smile, “Stop pretending! Act cocky again after receiving this punch!”

A hint of an amused smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and his two hands formed a circle in front of his chest without any discontinuity.

A ball of light emerged in Ye Yuan’s palm.

No petrifying aura, everything appeared so serene.

Ao Yu’s movement and Ye Yuan’s motionlessness formed a sharp contrast.

Seeing this scene, Ao Yu’s pupils could not help constricting as he cried out in surprise, “Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand! This ... This isn’t possible! You just broke through to the Empyrean Realm, so how can you possibly cultivate the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand so fast?”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “Cultivate? Doesn’t exist! Didn’t anybody tell you that I’m of the Atavism Dragon Soul?”

Ao Yu’s expression changed drastically, looking at Ye Yuan with a stunned expression.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually of the Atavism Dragon Soul!

In reality, Progenitor Long Qin had long mastered the Universe Dragon Claw’s fourth form, Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand.

After Ye Yuan broke through to rank seven, Ye Yuan grasped his martial technique naturally.

Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand was famously hard to cultivate in the Dragon Clan.

Many Empyrean powerhouses cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years and were only dabblers too.

Hence, many people rather went to awaken innate divine abilities than be willing to spend hundreds of thousands of years to go and cultivate this martial technique.

However, Long Qin’s talent was immensely high and cultivated this martial technique to the realm of grand completion.

Hence, the moment Ye Yuan made his move, it was the grand completion realm Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand.

As for cultivation this sort of dreary thing, to the Atavism Dragon Soul Ye Yuan, it did not exist at all.

At this time, a myriad of profanities galloped across in Ao Yu’s heart!

At the outside world, the group of heavenly emperors already burst into an uproar.

“Just how many trump cards does this guy have! The power of Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand already doesn’t lose to ordinary innate divine abilities!”

“How did he master the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand when he just broke through to Empyrean Realm?”

“This is really a fierce struggle between two evenly-matched opponents! Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand matching up against the Boundless Big Dipper Fist, it’s not easy to say who wins and who loses!”

... ...

Seeing everyone’s stunned appearance, Long Xiaochun had a smug look.

“Hehe,

cultivate? What the hell is that? Ye Yuan doesn’t need to cultivate at all to grasp the Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand!” Long Xiaochun said with a smug look.

Everyone was taken aback when he heard that, but Morningstar’s eyes glimmered, and he said, “Could this boy be ... of the Atavism Dragon Soul?”

Long Xiaochun nodded and said with a smile, “Ye Yuan’s progenitor is my mother’s elder brother, Long Qin. This Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand, Uncle he must have mastered it long ago. Hence, Ye Yuan doesn’t need to cultivate at all.”

Ao Qi’s face changed and he cried out in surprise, “Long Qin! The Son of the Heavenly Dragon who was known as the one with the greatest talent in your Raindragon Stronghold?”

Long Xiaochun shook her head and said, “That I’m not clear.”

But Morningstar nodded slightly and said, “I’ve also heard of him before. It was said that he had high hopes of entering Heavenly Dragon Mountain back then. But due to a momentary show of bravery, he barged into the Dragon Eye Cave. In the end, he was not heard of since. I didn’t expect that such a monster actually emerged among his descendants!”

Although only the tip of the iceberg was revealed with regards to Ye Yuan’s strength, these Heavenly Emperors were all perfectly aware.

Ye Yuan already surpassed his predecessor!

However, these Heavenly Emperors only saw the scene from the light screen and did not know the actual situation in the Mist Battlefield.

Ye Yuan’s Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand did not have an earth-shaking power, as if it was an old well without ripples.

In Ao Yu’s view, Ye Yuan’s move was an empty show.

Ao Yu naturally would not be silly enough to think that Ye Yuan was putting on a showy air to deal with him.

On the contrary, his hairs were currently standing on end. A feeling of incredible danger welled up in his head.

It was just that he who had awakened a second time did not believe in fate.

“So what even if Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand? I don’t believe that a mere martial technique can break my second awakening innate divine ability! Boundless Big Dipper Fist! Kill for me!”

As he roared, Ao Yu executed the Boundless Big Dipper Fist.

This punch was indomitable, displaying the dragon race’s domineeringness in its entirety.

The spirit of the true dragon behind him suddenly struck a fist out. Heaven and earth trembled because of it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Ao Yu previously relied on precisely this move to overpower Long Seven!

Facing this heaven-shocking blow, Ye Yuan was completely oblivious. He just pushed lightly, the light ball in his palm suddenly vanished.

Bang!

Virtually instantaneously, an earth-shaking explosion sound erupted.

The massive true dragon spirit was blown into pieces by an inexplicable force in an instant.

Ao Yu’s pupils constricted, wanting to flee, but it was already too late.

His surroundings were already enveloped by an inexplicable power, then it started exploding crazily.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

After the explosions, Ao Yu fell to the ground feebly, akin to a pile of rotten mud.

Seeing the Ye Yuan who slowly walked in front of him, Ao Yu’s eyes were like dead ashes.

“W-Why?”

He was unresigned!

Originally thought that the Mist Battlefield was the place where he would experience a nirvanic rebirth. Who could have thought that ... it actually became his land of demise!

He defeated the Long Seven who ranked in the top three, but he completely lost to Ye Yuan!
