“Roar!”

An earth-shaking dragon roar sounded. The old ancestor’s face abruptly changed!

In virtually an instant, the old ancestor knew the source of Ye Yuan’s martial technique. The astonishment in his heart could not be any greater.

It was just that there was no time for him to be surprised right now. Allowing the Voice of the Dragon God to land on his body freely, his old bones would probably not even have residue remaining.

What surprised Ye Yuan was that the old ancestor was not completely powerless to retaliate like the rest.

After the astonishment, the old ancestor’s reaction was also extremely quick.

A terrifying undulation emitted from his body!

This undulation actually isolated the Voice of the Dragon God outside.

“This ... This is the Voice of the Dragon God! He actually knows the Voice of the Dragon God, how is this possible?” Ao Li cried out in alarm. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

To the dragon clan, the renown of the Voice of the Dragon God could be said to be an accomplishment that surpassed ancient and modern times.

Although this martial technique was lost, practically every member of the dragon race knew its might!

“Wasn’t the Voice of the Dragon God long lost? Why would a human know my dragon race’s supreme martial technique?”

“Too inconceivable! When he used the divine rank Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm before, it gave me a fright. Didn’t expect that now, he even used the Voice of the Dragon God.”

“Is he really a human? I even suspect that he’s a member of my dragon race. Who can tell me what the hell is going on here?”

...

The already lost martial technique suddenly showing up, the shock to the dragon clan could be imagined.

Not just the dragon clan, the other three clan’s elders were similarly shocked to the core.

Just like the Four Symbols Family Clans, they were naturally aware of the well-known Voice of the Dragon God.

They did not expect that this martial technique actually appeared on a human.

One breath, two breaths!

Ye Yuan saw that he could not breach the old ancestor’s defense. Gritting his teeth, he went for three breaths!

Right at this time, a melancholic sigh came from inside the cave.

Ye Yuan’s heart suddenly trembled, his breath immediately being cut off. The Voice of the Dragon God abruptly ceased.

“Big Brother Yuan!”

Two breaths already passed, Ye Yuan’s body already virtually reached the limits and was unable to support itself anymore. Li-er hurriedly went up to support him.

“Puhwark!”

The old ancestor’s face was deathly pale, and he spewed out a mouthful of blood.

He still could not completely resist the impact of the Voice of the Dragon God in the end!

“Ancestor! Are you alright?” Seeing the ancestor vomit blood, Ao Li and the rest exclaimed in shock.

The old ancestor waved his hand and looked towards Ye Yuan profoundly and said, “This old man understands! H-haha, this old man’s two eyes were really blind! Jun-er, you still have to meet him in the end.”

The last sentence, the old ancestor directed it toward the inside of the cave.

“Ancestor, let him come in.”

Inside the cave, a woman’s voice transmitted out serenely.

Ao Li’s expression turned austere. He had never known that apart from the old ancestor, there was still another person inside this cave!

Hearing this voice, Ye Yuan’s entire person was thunderstruck.

Clearly a foreign to the extreme voice, but the way he heard it, it was so warm.

“Forget it, you go in then! But only you alone can enter,” the old ancestor said coolly.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and struggled to his feet, and walked into the cave stumblingly.

“Ancestor, inside is ...” Ao Li could not resist asking.

“Ao Jun!” The old ancestor did not conceal it either, directly uttering a name.

Ao Li’s expression changed and he said, “Dragonlady Ao Jun! W-Wasn’t she dead?”

To say who was the most talented clan member in these 100 thousand years in the Divine Beast Realm, that was absolutely not him. It was Dragonlady Ao Jun!

Ao Jun only used a thousand years’ time and cultivated to the grand completion of Tier 9, and comprehended Divine Dao laws.

Her strength was much stronger even compared to him currently.

It was just a shame that she was not willing to be confined by this Divine Beast Realm. Over 800 years ago, she escaped out of the Divine Beast Realm and entered inside the Godsfall Mountain Range.

From then on, the clan members inside the Divine Beast Realm never saw her again.

It was also from then on that the old ancestor started devoting all his attention to guide Ao Li, grooming him to this current realm.

Ao Li did not expect that she was actually inside the old ancestor’s seclusion cave all along!

The old ancestor heaved a sigh and said, “Hard to say finish in a single sentence! But she’s probably very relieved to see her own son be so promising, right?”

“S-Son?” The clan members were in a state of disarray.

“That’s right, Ye Yuan is Ao Jun’s son, her son with a human.” The old ancestor slowly said.

Li-er and White Light exchanged a glance, both seeing the deep astonishment from the other person’s eyes.

They did not expect that Ye Yuan actually still had such a background.

No wonder Ye Yuan became so peculiar after entering this place.

At this time, the old ancestor looked toward White Light again and said kindly, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, you should be Whitefeather’s descendant, right? On your body, there’s her aura. Perfect White Tiger Physique, not bad! Pretty good! Huhu, back then, her and Jun-er’s feint attack to create a diversion for the actual attack was done really beautifully. It even deceived this old man! It’s just that this old man didn’t think that their descendants actually broke the curse at the same time. How ironic!”

Talking to the back, the old ancestor laughed self-mockingly.

White Light trembled. It was as if he was electrocuted.

“O-Old ancestor, what’s the meaning of your words?” White Light swallowed his saliva and said.

The old ancestor simply sat down and started talking about the Divine Beast Realm’s secrets.

When White Light heard the old ancestor’s words, he could not help being deeply astounded.

It turned out that this place was a land of exile!

The demon races here were all exiled to this place because of committing a severe crime, never to return to the Divine Realm!

This space was hewed open by the Four Great Divine Beasts’ progenitors joining hands, and set a curse on this place with a terrifying secret art.

Any felon who was banished here, once they left this region, their life would flow away rapidly, all the way till death!

Furthermore, their descendants would likewise be unable to leave this space!

This was a very terrifying curse, which was to say that once committing an unforgivable mistake and being banished here, their descendants would never ever see daylight!

Don’t look at how this place had green mountains and clear waters, its scenery breathtaking, it was actually a giant prison!

According to what the old ancestor said, since time immemorial, God knows how many clan members wanted to escape this cage in this place.

But after they went out, they grew old very quickly, and even died.

Even deity realm powerhouses were not exception either!

And the old ancestor was the last deity realm powerhouse in this place.

Of course, the four great progenitors did not drive them to extermination but left behind a feeble ray of hope.

If someone broke through to the Origin Deity Realm inside the Divine Beast Realm, or gave birth to a perfect divine beast and above physique’ spirit physique, the curse would automatically release.

Back then, Ao Jun and Whitefeather were the closest of sisters. The two of them joined hands and acted out a diversion in the east while really attacking the west.

One escaped to the Endless World passed the God Prohibited Demon Region, the other escaped until the God Prohibited Demon Region.

Back then, the old ancestor was greatly enraged, that was why he laid down that Peach Blossom Forest.

It was just that he did not expect that among Whitefeather’s descendants, one actually gave birth to a Perfect White Tiger Physique.

While Ao Jun’s son was even the Atavism Dragon Soul of the legends!
