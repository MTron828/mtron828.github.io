Chapter 2783: Go In and Play!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Three-nine Dao tribulation … He transcended it?” Waycloud muttered under his breath, clearly still not daring to believe it until now.

“S-Seems like it?” Saint Exalt Skyfortune murmured.

“He can’t even transform Great Dao. How can he possibly transcend three-nine Dao tribulation? To transcend the three-nine Dao tribulation, one needs to at least be an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven. Furthermore, an extremely strong existence among upper Saint Sovereign Heavens! Doesn’t that mean that he already has this strength?”

As Saint Exalt Waycloud said, he could not help shuddering.

If that was the case, that meant that not only did Ye Yuan’s combat power not regress, but it was also even stronger than before!

If he fought with Li Changsheng again, Ye Yuan might even be able to confront him head-on!

This was scary!

Saint Exalt Skyfortune looked at Waycloud and said with a bitter smile, “Have we … offended him badly?”

The moment these words came out, the Saint Sovereign Heavens present could not help but shudder.

Waycloud shook his head and said, “I don’t believe that he can still cultivate!”

Saint Exalt Skyfortune smiled bitterly again and said, “Whether he can cultivate or not, his strength is placed there! There’s probably no one stronger than him in our Rainclear Continent!”

Everyone exchanged glances, suddenly feeling at a loss on what to do.

On the other side, Saint Exalt Bull Demon and the rest of Myriad Demons Mountain’s Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were also dumbstruck with amazement.

Ye Yuan actually really gained a new lease on life!

One had to know, it was precisely them who threw a rock down the well at the crucial moment!

At this time, there was only bitterness left in the hearts of the Myriad Demons Mountain’s Saint Sovereign Heavens.

… …

Very soon, the Five Great Heavenly Regions and Myriad Demons Mountain’s Saint Sovereign Heavens received an invitation.

This invitation was inviting them to head to the seven great sea regions to have a talk.

The Saint Sovereign Heavens who received the invitation were all rather baffled.

Go to the seven great sea regions to do what?

These Saint Sovereign Heavens were not fools. They knew that Ye Yuan definitely invited them over to demonstrate his martial prowess.

However, at this time, they also really wanted to see if Ye Yuan really rose again from the ashes, or he was simply making an empty show of strength.

In the sky above the nameless island, sword energy was awe-inspiring.

Luo Yunqing felt this sword intent in addition to being overjoyed. There was an additional hint of shock.

This sword intent was too pure, too powerful!

His strength advanced by leaps and bounds during these over 100 years.

But his Great Dao Transformation was still stagnant at the third for.

But the sword energy on the nameless island was left behind in the fifth form!

The disparity between the two could not be measured with distance!

“I’ve always been following Lord Zhuo’s footsteps, but I didn’t know that he was actually already formidable to such an extent when he left Rainclear Continent!” Luo Yunqing exclaimed.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Zhuo Bufan is indeed amazingly talented. Therefore, there’s already nothing on this tiny little Rainclear Continent that can satisfy him. Without opponents, invincibility is the loneliest!”

Luo Yunqing nodded slightly, deeply in agreement too.

“Ye Yuan, just how strong is your current strength?” Luo Yunqing could not resist asking.

After overcoming the tribulation on that day, Ye Yuan did not expose his strength.

Luo Yunqing naturally knew what he invited those Saint Sovereign Heavens here for.

Therefore, he also really wanted to know how strong Ye Yuan was now.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said smilingly, “You’ll know very soon.?Oh?right, the Sword Dao that you walk is quite similar to Zhuo Bufan’s. The sword energy that he left behind is helpful to you. You go in and try comprehending on the sword.”

Luo Yunqing nodded slightly, wielding the sword and entering the island.

Luo Yunqing was very strong!

He charged right to the depths of the island with one sword by himself.

But in the end, he still withdrew in defeat.

However, he was not discouraged either, rushing into the depths of the island time and again.

Just like this, a month passed.

And at this time, Waycloud and the rest of the Saint Sovereign Heavens also arrived in succession.

There were dozens of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses in the sky above the nameless island for a time!

Waycloud looked toward Saint Exalt Bull Demon, opened his mouth, and said, “Fellow Daoist Bull Demon, someone wants to take so many of us down a notch!”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon snorted coldly and said, “That will also have to depend on whether he has this ability or not!”

Waycloud smiled and said, “True. On our two sides, there are no less than 50 Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses! If he wants to take us down a notch and establish an advantageous position, he’ll also have to weigh it over!”

Previously, they were divided into two camps.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon originally looked down on Waycloud they all too.

It was not that Waycloud they all were weak, but it was that the territorial awareness of true spirit saint exalts was extremely strong. They were not willing to interfere in the matters outside of the Myriad Demons Mountain.

But now, Ye Yuan broke through, and his strength was unknown. They had no choice but to join hands.

Previously, they all targeted Ye Yuan.

If they still did not join hands now, then they could only be defeated individually.

With over 50 Saint Exalt powerhouses, it was virtually five times that of Ye Yuan’s side!

Furthermore, they even had a large group of middle Saint Sovereign Heavens. They naturally had the confidence.

These words were all said for Ye Yuan to hear.

Meanwhile, Ye Yuan was as calm as before, as if everything had nothing to do with him.

Ye Yuan’s attitude made Waycloud somewhat irritated. He gave a cold snort and said, “Ye Yuan, what did you call us here for? Do you really think that we’re scared of you?”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, and he said, “Brother Luo broke through!”

Sure enough, in the depths of the island, Luo Yunqing’s sword intent surged to the sky, and he actually broke through to the fourth form!

One month of bitter cultivation was greatly beneficial to him!

The faces of Waycloud and the rest could not help changing.

Luo Yunqing’s Great Dao Transformation breaking through to the fourth form meant that he had the strength to have a battle with them too! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The strength of Heavenly South’s Saint Exalts rose a level again.

Waycloud sneered and said, “This is your bargaining chip? What a joke! You take a look first; how many Saint Sovereign Heavens our two sides have!”

Ye Yuan looked towards Saint Exalt Waycloud and said with a smile, “Brother Waycloud, are you interested in going in to play?”

Waycloud was taken aback and said with a cold smile, “So what if Zhuo Bufan? It’s also not that he is here. Could it be that this exalt is really scared of a stream of sword energy?”

Very soon, Luo Yunqing came out, excitement on his face. Looking at Waycloud and the rest, he was full of fighting spirit.

Ye Yuan indicated for him to calm down. Waycloud gave a cold snort and leaped, entering the sword energy.

Waycloud had the intention of showing his strength. The moment he made his move, his momentum was unstoppable!

Coupled with the grandmist treasure in his hand, his combat power skyrocketed!

He entered the depths of the island in one go.

After breaking through to middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, Waycloud’s strength increased greatly too.

His strength was even stronger than Luo Yunqing, and he rushed even deeper in.

Seeing Saint Exalt Waycloud’s strength, their side also heaved a slight sigh in relief.

Their side, together with Saint Exalt Bull Demon and the rest, the middle Saint Sovereign Heavens were no less than ten!

This force was sufficient to rival Ye Yuan!

An hour later, Waycloud came out of the island somewhat out of breath.

However, he had a proud look!

The depth that he made it to was much deeper than Luo Yunqing.

And this also demonstrated that his strength was much stronger than Luo Yunqing.

Relying on one Luo Yunqing to suppress him?

Got to be kidding!

“How is it, Ye Yuan?” Waycloud looked toward Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile.

But Ye Yuan did not answer. He turned to Saint Exalt Bull Demon and said with a smile, “Brother Bull Demon, go in and play too?”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon gave a cold snort and flew in too!
