Chapter 1887: The New Immortal Grove World!

“R-Recovered!”

Looking at those spatial cracks gradually recovering, Fang Tian’s eyes were full of mixed feelings.

The crowd that originally already lost all hope started cheering crazily at this time.

That horrifying energy undulation already passed, the Immortal Grove World was not destroyed!

Skydistant had lingering fear in his heart as he said, “Really restored! How did Ye Yuan do it? That surge of energy undulation just now made me feel like I went to the gates of hell and back.”

That horrifying energy undulation just now spread throughout the entire Immortal Grove World.

Even Skydistant, this level of powerhouses, felt the aura of despair.

But in a twinkle, not only was the Immortal Grove World not destroyed, it became even more stable instead.

Got to say, this was a miracle that they did not dare to believe.

“Yeah, too horrifying! If not for seeing with my own eyes, I wouldn’t even dare believe that there’s actually such a horrifying energy in this world. I also don’t dare to believe that someone’s strength can reach such a boundary. In the end, we’re merely frogs at the bottom of a well. Ye Yuan, he is really remarkable!” Fang Tian said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Currently, the survivors of the Immortal Grove World were all shouting crazily.

That wild elation of surviving a calamity erupted like a volcano, bursting forth from the bottom of their hearts uncontrollably.

...

Above the void, Ye Yuan looked down upon the world.

His gaze landed on the gradually dissipating Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, full of mixed feelings.

He understood Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s fury. But, for this reason, using the Immortal Grove World’s trillions of life to go take revenge, it was a little too vicious.

Ye Yuan did not have compassion for all life, but he respected each person’s existence.

Cultivating from Essence Qi Realm all the way until such a boundary, Ye Yuan’s journey of the heart was far more complicated than other martial artists.

Even just a mortal also had their meaning of existence.

In Ye Yuan’s view, Celestial Deity, True God, even Heavenly Empyreans, Heavenly Emperors, had no difference from mortals in essence.

Each person was attempting to shake off the shackles of fate, and control their own destiny.

Everyone was merely a speck of dust in this vast world.

Ye Yuan would never be soft-hearted against opponents who had massacred billions of lives with a finger, but he would still satisfy his own selfish desires by sacrificing others as the price.

In this lifetime, he had a clear conscience!

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s way of doing things made him incomparably indignant.

If not for him connecting the Immortal Grove World to the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain at the critical moment, suppressing the Immortal Grove World with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s power, this world would have already turned to ashes now.

However, for Ye Yuan to be able to have today’s accomplishments, it could be said to be all thanks to the Immortal Grove World.

“A person dying is like a lamp extinguishing! Today’s matter, I’ll leave it at this, you ... go with peace of mind!” Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and said coolly.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove looked at Ye Yuan, his face revealing a consoled smile.

Just as he was about to speak, a horrifying aura surged once more.

“A person dying is like a lamp extinguishing? Hahaha! You almost killed this emperor, how can this emperor let you die like this! Old Fart Immortal Grove, I want you to watch, watch your successor die in front of you! I want to completely destroy your small world!”

Horrifying fiendish energy rose to the sky once more, making Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s face change drastically.

“Actually didn’t die!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove meticulously laid down such a scheme, he naturally had absolute confidence in killing Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang.

But he never thought that Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang would be even more stubborn than he imagined.

The power of that finger was ridiculously horrifying and he actually did not die!

However, although Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s fiendish energy was horrifying currently, it was clearly far weaker than before.

That finger still caused tremendous damage to him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Except ... Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was already powerless to stop him.

The current Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was invincible!

Seeing Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang return once more, Qiao Yuan and Eymond’s faces revealed wild elation.

“Haha, how can Lord Jiu Shang die so easily? Old Fart Immortal Grove, you miscalculated, right?! Old Fart Immortal Grove, Ye Yuan, tremble!” Qiao Yuan laughed wildly and said.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s expression was extremely ugly. This sudden turn of events seriously exceeded his expectations.

“Boy, today’s calamity was caused by me, I’ll resolve it, you quickly leave! Kunwu, we’ll delay him, give this boy the time to leave!” Immortal Grove said.

Kunwu gave Ye Yuan a glance and just quietly nodded his head.

Being able to maintain the world from collapsing and contending with a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, these were two entirely different concepts.

The entire Immortal Grove World was like a large web, although a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s might was terrifying, it was clearly not that easy to want to make the entire large web totally fall apart.

The power that Ye Yuan drew from the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was sufficient to maintain this web from being utterly torn to shreds.

However, a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse dealing with a Celestial Deity Realm martial artist, even if he was this small world’s controller, it was impossible to accomplish too.

“Hahaha! Want to leave? Today, no one can leave!”

Clearly, Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was already thoroughly enraged.

Only to see him surge with fiendish flames billowing to the sky, condensing a black enormous sword.

That horrifying aura tore the surrounding space apart once more.

“True Fiend Sword, Fury Chopping the Firmament!”

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang gave a furious roar and was about to unleash this True Fiend Sword.

But right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

A massive mountain fell from the sky, carrying an apocalyptic might, directly suppressing down.

One blue fine-lines after another revolved incessantly on the giant mountain.

Bang!

That True Fiend Sword directly crumbled.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang let out a shrill scream, but it was already too late to want to escape.

Bang!

Another loud bang, the entire Immortal Grove World’s earth trembled.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang was directly suppressed below the ground by the giant mountain without the slightest strength to resist.

Everyone looked at that giant mountain, each and every one of their pupils constricting.

“This ... What is this, to ... to actually be able to even suppress a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse?” Qiao Yuan said with an ashen look.

“L-Lord Jiu Shang wouldn’t have died just like this, right?” Eymond said with a look of terror.

“What on earth did Ye Yuan do, why did he suddenly become so strong?”

“The Immortal Grove World is merely an Empyrean-level small world, even if he’s the new controller, it’s also impossible to suppress Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, right?”

...

The Empyrean powerhouses and True God powerhouses were all incomparably struck with terror.

The scene that happened before their eyes truly surpassed their understanding.

But they also realized that right now, the Immortal Grove World already became spiritually renewed, and was no longer that fragile small world previously.

And Ye Yuan this controller was already powerful to the extreme.

With a flip of his hand, he thoroughly suppressed a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and Kunwu’s eyes went wide, looking at this scene in disbelief.

“This empyrean ... This empyrean has never known that the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain can unleash such terrifying power!’ Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove muttered under his breath.

The current Ye Yuan was still standing proudly above the void.

It was just that his form became incomparably tall and big in everyone’s eyes.

Celestial Deity Realm?

That was just a joke!

The current Ye Yuan already reached a level where he could disregard cultivation realms.

In this Immortal Grove World, he ... was an invincible existence!
