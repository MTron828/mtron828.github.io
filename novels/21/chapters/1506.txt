Chapter 1510 Blood Soul Curse

“You’re Source Night?”

Heavenstar sized Ye Yuan up and could not help being somewhat surprised by Ye Yuan’s good looks.

He actually did not look like a fiend.

However, the pure fiend energy on Ye Yuan’s body made him unable to find any fault.

“I pay respects to Senior Heavenstar!”

Ye Yuan’s attitude was neither obsequious nor haughty. He was not especially respectful toward Heavenstar even though the latter was a Four-star Fiend Apothecary.

He had long considered the consequences of the Great Dao Heavenly Melody. There was no way Eminent Orchid Imperial City’s Blood Yama Hall headquarters would watch a genius like him slip by their side.

In reality, Ye Yuan also did not expect that he would trigger the Great Dao Heavenly Melody. Otherwise, he absolutely would not display it in front of people.

If this kind of thing was known by others, it was impressive, but it was very easy to attract a fatal calamity too.

Heavenstar coming to Capone Capital City could only have one purpose, that was to have him join the Blood Yama Hall!

A Fiend Apothecary capable of triggering Great Dao Heavenly Melody, his significance to the Blood Yama Hall was absolutely extraordinary.

Ye Yuan had long considered this result and also knew that if he did not agree, there was only one outcome.

That was death!

The Blood Yama Hall absolutely would not allow him to join other forces, then become their enemy.

But Ye Yuan could not be too deliberate either.

Geniuses needed to have the awareness of geniuses.

Arrogance was a natural attribute of geniuses.

Even though Ye Yuan was not haughty, in front of Heavenstar, he must show arrogance.

An alchemy genius capable of triggering Great Dao Heavenly Dao not being haughty at all, this did not conform to common sense. The other party would definitely be suspicious. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hence, his attitude was lukewarm toward Heavenstar.

Of course, in Ye Yuan’s heart, he did not have much veneration towards this so-called Four-star Fiend Apothecary.

He triggered Great Dao Heavenly Melody. Now, he already saw a world that others could not see.

“Hahaha, indeed, the young are to be feared! Everyone says that my fiend race’s Fiend Apothecaries’ level is too poor and can’t groom powerful Fiend Apothecaries at all! Now, those people can all shut up!” Heavenstar said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan objected incessantly in his heart. Just the standard of your fiend race’s Fiend Apothecaries, it was simply too unsightly to look at. You actually still wanted to groom a powerful Fiend Apothecary?

This Heavenstar was known as a Four-star high-level Fiend Apothecary. But Ye Yuan assumed that his standard was also not very high.

Compared to the human race’s Four-star Alchemy Gods, it was probably far off.

“The strength of Fiend Apothecaries still need to depend on the person, nothing to do with the race.” Although disdainful in his heart, Ye Yuan still had a proud appearance.

Heavenstar did not mind either, chuckling and saying, “Sit down and talk. Come and sample the Bloodgod Tea that this old man brought. This thing, ordinary people can’t drink it!”

As he said, Heavenstar pushed a pot of tea in front of Ye Yuan. Fragrance immediately overflowed.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over the blood-like tea and did not detect anything strange.

But right at this time, Dustless warned, “Ye Yuan, this guy wants to put the Blood Soul Curse on you.”

“Blood Soul Curse?” Ye Yuan said in puzzlement.

After Ye Yuan entered this room, he looked very conceited on the surface. Actually, he was very vigilant inwardly.

Except, he did not detect anything strange.

“The Blood Soul Curse is a very sinister and profound method of the fiend race. It doesn’t belong to the category of medicinal pills. Hence, you’re unable to detect it too. See those lanterns with varying different shapes in the corners of the house?” Dustless asked.

Ye Yuan glimpsed with his peripherals. Sure enough, he discovered that each corner of the room had a bizarre shaped lamp.

The fiend race’s preferences were very different from the human race to begin with. So Ye Yuan did not think too much either.

He did not expect that a profound mystery was actually hidden in these lamps.

Ye Yuan secretly thought what a close call. If not for Dustless being around, he would likely really fall for it this time.

“Saw it. What’s wrong with these lamps?” Ye Yuan asked.

Dustless said, “These lamps have a name. They are called Soul Refining Lamps. The wicks of Soul Refining Lamps are refined with countless people’s tendons. The refiner imprisons living souls in the wick of the lamps, incinerating with endless fire, tempering these living souls, making these living souls billow with monstrous resent. But on the surface, one can’t tell at all. Don’t talk about humans, even the fiend race themselves, if they didn’t understand this Dao, they can’t perceive the actual situation too.”

Ye Yuan drew a cold breath. This method was a little too cruel.

Members of the fiend race were indeed all vicious and cold-hearted people!

Back then, the fiend race also used similar methods to collect sanguine power, and also went on a massacre.

“Then what does this Blood Soul Curse have to do with the Bloodgod Tea?” Ye Yuan asked.

“The Bloodgod Tea is indeed a rare spirit tea of the fiend race. It can help them increase fiend essence, matching the result of medicinal pills. It’s just that this Bloodgod Tea is a crucial link of the Blood Soul Curse. It is the prelude to launching the Blood Soul Curse! Bloodgod Tea is grown by watering with those living souls’ blood. Once you drink the Bloodgod Tea, those living souls suppressed in the lamp wicks will collectively unleash the power of the curse, making you get hit by the Blood Soul Curse! People who get hit with the curse don’t have the slightest feeling. But once someone activates the Blood Soul Curse, you’ll suffer the torment of the soul being devoured, experiencing a fate worse than death! It looks like they want to use this method to control you!” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan’s heart sunk. He did not expect that this Heavenstar actually set up such a trap for him. His wrath rose with a whoosh.

This Blood Yama Hall was indeed well-deserving of being a mysterious underground force, an existence even more horrifying than the City Lord Manor.

He did not provoke anyone and they actually used this kind of insidious method to deal with him.

“Senior, do you have a way to deal with this Blood Soul Curse? If I don’t drink this pot of tea, that old thing probably won’t let it go!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan felt a headache too. He did not expect that preaching on the Dao actually caused such a major trouble.

He broke through the Alchemy Dao shackles because of preaching on Dao, but he also attract massive trouble because of preaching on the Dao.

It was really misfortune goes hand-in-hand with fortune!

But Dustless smiled and said, “Did you forget what kind of existence I am? The Soul Suppressing Pearl is the ancestor of Soul Dao. Unless a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse comes personally, otherwise, how can a measly Blood Soul Curse harm you? Moreover, I have a secret art that can absorb the power of the curse and feed it back to the Soul Suppressing Pearl! You just drink the Bloodgod Tea. Leave the rest to me.”

Hearing this, Ye Yuan’s heart was put back in place.

He smiled slightly, picked up the teacup and drank the tea.

Seeing this scene, the corners of Heavenstar’s mouth revealed a smile of his wicked scheme succeeding.

“How’s the taste?” Heavenstar said with a smile.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and was full of praises, “Good tea! Refreshing the mind and actually has the effect of increasing fiend essence!”

Heavenstar laughed out loud and said, “Haha, if you like, I still have some here. I’ll give them to you.”

Ye Yuan hurriedly said, “How can this do? Such a grade of spirit tea, it must be very precious, right? Source Night cannot receive benefits without sowing anything!”

Heavenstar pressed him down and said with a smile, “Younger Brother Source Night, I’ll call you as my younger brother. You’re a clever person and should have guessed this old man’s intention of coming, right? My Blood Yama Hall’s strength is powerful until you can’t imagine it. With your talent, there’s only joining our Blood Yama Hall that can let you radiate splendor!”

Ye Yuan did not reveal a surprised expression and said with a smile, “Senior Heavenstar is very kind. It’s just that ... Source Night still doesn’t plan on joining any faction for the time being.”

Heavenstar was not surprised either and said very meaningfully, “Don’t be in a hurry to reject, you go back and consider it first. Perhaps ... you’ll have a change of heart?”
