But at this time, Absolute Heaven Barrier had plunged into a life-and-death great battle again.

In order to avenge the enmity, the blood race deployed 300 thousand troops on South Qi Giant City, launching a fierce bombardment on South Qi Giant City.

This time, it was Lord Wang Zuo who personally ordered it!

These 300 thousand bloodkins were all elite troops transferred over from the rear. Their combat power was extremely intrepid.

Bloodpromise returned anew, being in control of this 300 thousand strong army!

Both sides unleashed an unprecedented life-and-death great battle at South Qi Giant City.

South Qi Giant City transformed into a brutal battlefield once again.

Fortunately, there was the Lesser Origin Restoration Art. By relying on the power of the grand array, South Qi Giant City still barely managed to resist the frenzied assault of the blood race under the huge disadvantage in military strength.

And right at this time, a drastic change plunged the Heaven One Alliance into an extremely dangerous situation!

On this day, South Qi Giant City and the blood race army were currently fighting fiercely.

Feng Xiaotian and Bloodpromise fought until heaven and earth dimmed, the void trembling

“Feng Xiaotian, in today’s battle, either you die or I perish.” Bloodpromise was really risking his life this time.

Not only him, but all of the blood race powerhouses were also attacking the city at the risk of their lives this time, completely disregarding casualties.

In the past battles, after the bloodkins were seriously injured, they would retreat at once. Therefore, their casualty rate was actually not high.

But this time, each one of them was only willing to stop after fighting all the way until they were obliterated.

Under this kind of circumstance, South Qi Giant City was under enormous pressure.

Furthermore, the blood race had an army of 300 thousand. Although only 100 thousand people could enter the passageway, they could replenish troops continuously without ceasing

But on Heaven One’s side, the speed of replenishing troops was much slower.

After the last battle, Heaven One Alliance transferred another several tens of thousands of people over to South Qi Giant City.

At this time, their military strength also reached as high as 80 thousand.

But, under the blood race’s frenzied onslaught, the casualties on South Qi Giant City’s side were enormous.

After half a month of sustained frenziedly fighting, South Qi Giant City was only left with 30 thousand troops!

For this, the blood race’s 100 thousand strong army was completely obliterated!

This casualty had never appeared in the blood race before!

Feng Xiaotian’s gaze was cold as he said in a solemn voice, “Even if we fight down to the very last man, you all can forget about taking half a step into South Qi Giant City too!”

Boom!

Right at this time, a huge noise came from above the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

A mighty aura was currently dying swiftly!

Feng Xiaotian’s expression changed wildly, his eyes full of shock.

Above the Absolute Heaven Barrier, someone … died!

That was the aura of Hegemon Edgeless!

Hegemon Edgeless … fell?

For these few thousand years, Heaven One Alliance’s Hegemon Realms had never died before.

But this time, somebody finally fell!

This death would trigger a series of chain reactions.

The consequence was too terrifying!

“Hahaha … Hegemon Bloodsky succeeded! Once Edgeless that damn thing dies, the Absolute Heaven Barrier will become weak, and South Qi’s passageway will open up! Feng Xiaotian, today will be your hour of doom!”

Bloodpromise had clearly felt it too. He let out a wild laugh, being pleased to the extreme.

The Absolute Heaven Barrier was jointly set up by the Hegemons. Once one person died, the effects would be diminished.

South Qi Giant City was the weakest place, so the passageway here would surely have a large opening be opened up!

More bloodkins would enter the passageway!

Conspiracy!

A huge conspiracy!

The blood race’s target this time was not South Qi Giant City at all, they were aiming for Hegemon Edgeless!

But, once Hegemon Edgeless died, South Qi Giant City would be in danger too!

“Children, all enter the passageway and kill for me!”

Bloodpromise’s voice shook the sky. The remaining 200 thousand bloodkin army rushed into the passageway frenziedly!

Feng Xiaotian’s mind shook wildly!

An army of 200 thousand, this force was too terrifying!

South Qi Giant City only had 30 thousand people remaining now. It was simply impossible to block these 200 thousand troops!

What on earth happened over at the Absolute Heaven Barrier?

But at this time, he could not help but be shocked too.

His gaze turned intent, and he said loudly, “Brothers, Hegemon Edgeless has fallen. We already have no path of retreat! Once South Qi Giant City is breached, the hundreds of millions of living things behind us will become meals in the bellies of the blood race! We cannot fall!”

“I believe that the Hegemons already know about the unexpected turn of events here! This battle will be the turning point of Heaven One’s war with the blood race! Starting from today, Heaven One will surely swarm out in full force and engage in the final decisive battle with the blood race! But, if South Qi Giant City is lost, we won’t even have the chance for a final battle anymore! Brothers, this city lord knows that you all aren’t afraid of death! But we can’t die! Brothers, please join me and defend South Qi to the death!”

“One month! Just one month’s time! Our hope will be rekindled!”

Each and every one of the powerhouses left in the city had incomparably solemn gazes.

They knew that the true moment of life and death had arrived!

This battle was even more perilous and even fiercer than the previous one!

They all practically had little hope of survival anymore, including Feng Xiaotian!

But they proceeded without hesitation!

Nobody answered Feng Xiaotian. At this moment, the 30 thousand strong army was silent.

There were no grandiose words or valiantness, but they had incomparably firm eyes.

Seeing their looks, Feng Xiaotian was very gratified.

“Kill!”

Under Feng Xiaotian’s word of command, the army of 30 thousand charged out crazily!

… …

20 days later!

Below the city, corpses scattered everywhere!

South Qi Giant City’s 30 thousand troops actually miraculously blocked the blood race’s army of 200 thousand for as long as 20 days!

Under desperate circumstances, the Heaven One army exhibited an astonishing will. They did not seek death!

They were holding on firmly for one last month!

Under this kind of steel will, they defeated the blood race army’s onslaught time and again.

However, the battle was extremely tragic too.

At this time, the army of 30 thousand was only left with half. Furthermore, everyone was injured.

The city protecting grand array was already severely damaged too!

The heavenly formation masters guarding the array formation were practically wiped out!

Even City Lord Feng Xiaotian was seriously injured too.

The powerhouses around him got fewer and fewer. In each battle, he would have to face more than five origin powerhouses!

However, although they had created a miracle, South Qi Giant City was only left with one last breath before completely falling into the enemy’s hands.

They did not know how many more assaults from the blood race they could still hold back.

But, thinking about it, they probably could not hold out for a month!

ce

At Bloodpromise camp, Bloodpromise was scolded with a torrent of abuse. “Are you a pig? With 200 thousand blood race elites, countless powerhouses, you actually couldn’t take down the South Qi Giant City that’s guarded by 30 thousand people! This seat and Hegemon Bloodsky have virtually fallen before exchanging for such a battle opportunity! If any more mishaps happen again, carry your head to see me!”

Hegemon You Jin was bellowing madly at Bloodpromise.

The current Hegemon You Jin had a very weak aura. Clearly, he had suffered serious wounds.

Killing a Hegemon in the Absolute Heaven Barrier, it would not be without paying a price.

Except, he did not think that the battle opportunity that he had won by paying the price of risking death, Bloodpromise actually could not take it down!

This drove people too freaking crazy!

Bloodpromise’s face already turned into the color of pig liver.

He also did not expect that 200 thousand troops actually could not even take down South Qi Giant City.

One had to know, 100 thousand people in the past would have already killed until South Qi Giant City would be close to crumbling!

Of course, the city protecting grand array was a very important aspect.

But Bloodpromise never expected that the Heaven One army, which Feng Xiaotian led, actually erupted with such a terrifying will at the moment of desperation!

Each time, they looked like they were about to succeed.

But in the end, it was still one step short of success!

Recently, he had really been down on his luck, suffering crushing defeats at South Qi Giant City repeatedly.

“Lord You Jin, rest assured. Give me another five days! Within five days, I’ll definitely take down South Qi Giant City!” Bloodpromise said.

You Jin’s expression was cold as he said, “This is what you said!”
