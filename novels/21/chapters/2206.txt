Chapter 2210: Giving a Peach, Returning a Plum

Lu-er burrowed into Ye Yuan’s embrace. Shaking her head, she sobbed as she said, “It wasn’t hard on Lu-er. It was Young Master who had it tough!”

How could she not understand? Ye Yuan becoming like this, he must have experienced a great battle without equal inside that Blackflame Cave.

Young Master was just one person!

What he shouldered back then, who could understand?

Ye Yuan sighed again and said, “It’s just a pity that I didn’t bring Li-er back.”

At this time, Ye Yuan stepped into the middle-stage Ancestor Realm, his divine soul recovering, and became even stronger than before.

The events inside the Blackflame Cave, he already remembered all of them.

He and Nineorigin experienced a life-and-death great battle, triggering an enormous space-time black hole.

Nineorigin was seriously injured. He was also similarly heavily wounded on the verge of death.

Ye Yuan could feel that the power of Divine Stele Injecting Spirit in his body disappeared completely.

Looks like it should be the golden dragon in his body that saved him at the critical juncture.

It was just that ... Li-er probably could not return anymore!

Ye Yuan was mournful in his heart. He did not know what kind of world was the abyss, but wanting to bring Li-er back from there was harder than ascending to the heavens.

There was no need to talk about the might of abyss monsters, the Divine Race’s strength was even above the abyss monsters.

Ye Yuan’s power alone was too meager.

“Young Master, Elder Sister Li-er will definitely be fine!” Lu-er suddenly stopped crying and said firmly.

Ye Yuan helped her to wipe away her tears, his gaze unprecedentedly steadfast as he said, “Mn, will be fine! Even if I trample this sky to pieces, I’ll also bring her back! I think that she’s also waiting for me!”

This was his solemn promise to Li-er through the air!

Inside the array formation, Lin Changqing yelled loudly, “Hey! Are you guys done chatting? If you’re done, let me out!”

These two chattered for half a day, directly treating him as air.

Yet, this array formation was like an iron cage, he was unable to budge it in the slightest.

Only then did Ye Yuan remember Lin Changqing. Hence, he casually waved his hand and dispelled the array formation.

Lin Changqing came before Ye Yuan, an expression like he had seen a ghost as he said unhappily, “You this fellow, are really disgusting. Already became a cripple and you’re actually still so formidable!”

Lin Changqing was really incomparably shocked in his heart. Ye Yuan was actually still able to force him into a hopeless situation under such a state.

This kind of thing was simply fantastical!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Lin Changqing, still got to thank you a lot this time! Without you, don’t know I’ll have to wait until when to recover my memories!”

It was really all thanks to Lin Changqing this time. Otherwise, for him to want to reconcile what he learned these few years, he would probably still have to wait until god knows how long.

Lin Changqing rolled his eyes and said, “Don’t give me that! I didn’t do it for you! But speaking of which, what on earth did you experience inside that Blackflame Cave? Why did you become like this? Also, where’s Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli?”

Although he knew that the likelihood of Yue Mengli returning was very low, he still could not resist asking Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and briefly recounted the events back then.

Of course, he skipped over the matter of pulling Nineorigin into the chaos world and having a great battle.

This sort of thing was too earth-shaking. He did not want to let people know.

A Third Firmament Empyrean had a life-and-death great battle with an Eighth Firmament Heavenly Emperor in his small world, and he even forcefully knocked the other party down a major cultivation realm.

If this matter spread out, no idea what kind of storm it would stir.

But even so, it was also sufficient to set the world on fire already.

Ye Yuan faced the Divine Race and abyss monster army by himself, and he wiped out the other party’s abyss monsters below late-stage Empyrean Realm.

This battle achievement could be rated as freakish!

Lin Changqing had entered the Blackflame Cave before and knew how strong these abyss monsters were.

Even if he fused the power of three laws, he could at most fight to a draw with same rank abyss monsters.

But Ye Yuan actually slaughtered so many abyss monsters whose realms were even higher than his with his power alone!

Furthermore, he even escaped outside.

Closing his eyes and he also knew how miserable the battle situation back then was.

If it were others, even if they had a thousand lives, they would also have died inside.

Bang!

Lin Changqing suddenly smashed a fist hard on Ye Yuan’s chest and said furiously, “Punk, I’ll forgive you this time! But when your strength becomes powerful, you have to fetch Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli back! Otherwise, I definitely won’t let you off!”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at him and said coolly, “Doesn’t seem like it’s your turn to come and say these words.”

Lin Changqing was greatly enraged, but recalling Ye Yuan’s mysterious array formation, he could only pull back hatefully.

Actually, Ye Yuan knew what kind of feelings Lin Changqing said this sentence with, and felt very warm in his heart.

No matter what, this fellow’s concern toward Li-er was not fake.

Otherwise, he also would not have accompanied Lu-er to look for him for so many years.

“Do you have rank seven spirit medicines on you?” Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and said.

Lin Changqing was taken aback and said, “I do, why?”

Ye Yuan said, “Take them all out, let me see.”

Lin Changqing had a strange expression and took all of the rank seven spirit medicines on him out, and asked curiously, “What are you trying to do?”

Ye Yuan swept a glance over the rank seven spirit medicines on Lin Changqing and said with a nod, “Worthy of coming out from a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda, your finances are still quite abundant. This time, being able to reconcile my knowledge and recover my memories, it’s a huge favor from you. I’ll help you refine a few medicinal pills. Take it as returning your favor.”

Lin Changqing’s eyes became wide-saucers and he said with a look of disbelief, “You ... You want to use array formation to refine rank seven divine pills?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You just watch.”

Ye Yuan’s feet moved swiftly, one divine essence stone after another shooting out, and started setting up the array formation.

Lin Changqing’s heart shook wildly. He naturally knew Formation Dao Pill Refinement, but he had never heard before that someone could refine rank seven divine pills with Formation Dao.

The higher the rank of the medicinal pill was, the more difficult it would be. The degree of complexity was what normal people could not imagine at all. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Let alone that the things involved in Formation Dao Pill Refinement were a hundred times, a thousand times more complicated than directly refining the pill.

Many Seven-star Alchemy Gods did not even figure out ordinary pill refinement. How could they have the ability to refine rank seven divine pills with Formation Dao?

What on earth did this guy experience these few years?

One array formation after another connected together, becoming more and more complicated, and increasingly colossal.

Finally, an array formation actually occupied more than half of the village!

Such a colossal and complicated array formation, just looking at it gave people a headache, let alone talk about setting it up.

Ye Yuan played the rank seven spirit medicines in the center of the array formation. Casually throwing out a piece of divine essence stone, he gave a low cry, saying, “Formation, arise!”

The divine essence stone thrown out hit a piece of divine essence stone inside the array formation. Then, it seemed to have turned on the domino effect, the entire array formation was lit up very quickly.

Bang!

Terrifying heaven and earth spiritual energy instantly swarmed around from all directions, forming a massive spiritual energy tempest.

Following that, this grand array sent out a magical scene.

Inside the array formation, there were the sun, the moon, and the stars revolving without rest, as if it formed a world.

Lin Changqing seemingly became solemn. It was still his first time seeing such a magical alchemy technique. His mouth openly widely, unable to close for a long time.

No idea how long had passed. Finally, the array formation stopped. A medicinal pill suspended in the air quietly, emitting a thick medicinal fragrance.

Lin Changqing’s entire body trembled as he said in disbelief, “This ... This is an end spirit divine pill! An end spirit Emergence Spirit Ascension Pill!”
