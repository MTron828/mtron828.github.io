Chapter 1440 Partners in Crime

Bang!

Qin Tian’s body sprang out of the rock wall with a gloomy face.

“Just how long has it been? That guy’s sword art improved again! If not for me wearing the Heavenly Feather Flexible Armor, my life would have met its end here!” Qin Tian said and gnashed his teeth.

That Chasing Moon move of Ye Yuan’s was simply dangerous to the extreme.

If not for his realm being far more powerful than Ye Yuan’s, if not for him wearing the profound divine artifact, Heavenly Feather Flexible Armor, then he would be a corpse right now!

Qin Tian’s understanding of Ye Yuan had still remained at Sundering Stars.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao laws had already broken through to Sword Dao second-layered heaven and created a new move!

Chasing Moon this move was too powerful!

Even if Qin Tian wore the Heavenly Feather Flexible Armor, his internal organs suffered a tremendous shock too, only recovering after a long time.

Recalling that scene previously, Qin Tian’s scalp was still tingling until now.

But this sword of Ye Yuan’s was too heavy. His current injuries were rather heavy, his strength greatly reduced.

“I absolutely can’t let Ye Yuan live on anymore! His growth speed is too fast! Just how long has it been, and he already has the strength to threaten me! Give him another few decades time, most likely, even I won’t be a match anymore too!”

Qin Tian became ruthless and was going to hunt down in the direction Ye Yuan and the rest escaped in.

But right at this time, a figure swayed, blocking his way.

Qin Tian’s expression changed. The one who blocked his path was none other than precisely Duan Fei!

The current Duan Fei’s breathing was chaotic, his injuries very heavy. Half of his face was virtually burned to a crisp, looking incomparably hideous.

“I didn’t expect that there was really an intruder who sneaked in and even disguised as the Life End Palace Lord! Punk, prepare to die!”

Previously, Qin Tian concealed his aura and even hoodwinked Duan Fei.

Now, Qin Tian revealed his true colors. Duan Fei did not talk crap with him at all, directly taking action.

Qin Tian’s injuries had yet to recover. At this time, he could only forcefully rouse his spirits and accept the challenge.

Fortunately, Duan Fei’s injuries were much heavier than his. Currently, it was already pretty good for him to be able to unleash 20% of his strength.

Upon exchanging blows, Duan Fei discovered something off.

This Qin Tian’s strength was more powerful than he imagined!

If not for cultivation realm suppression, he might even have the strength to contend with him.

Although Duan Fei occupied the absolute advantage, he actually could not bring him down after a long battle.

After a fierce battle, the two people’s injuries worsened significantly again. Qin Tian was burning with anxiety.

He would not let himself succumb here before killing Ye Yuan.

“Stop! Don’t fight anymore!” Qin Tian said solemnly.

“Heh, you say don’t fight and we stop? The Sky Foothill World kills intruders without mercy. You dared to sneak into the Divine Ruins, could it be that you still wish to get out?”

Duan Fei was an extremely prideful person too. Not taking down Qin Tian after a long battle, how could he be willing to give up?

“I came in order to kill Ye Yuan and don’t have any interest in your Sky Foothill World at all! He is our common enemy! If we both sustain injuries, do you think he’ll laugh himself awake when dreaming or not?” Qin Tian said.

Duan Fei’s face fell. As expected, he pulled back and stopped fighting.

“What do you mean?” Duan Fei said in a solemn voice.

Qin Tian smiled coldly and said, “Ye Yuan is my junior apprentice brother. What do you think I mean?”

Duan Fei’s expression changed and said, “Impossible! Azurepeak had once used the Tianlu Shrine to check his blood before. He’s the purest Sky Foothill people, so how can he possibly be your junior apprentice brother?”

Qin Tian sneered and said, “Heh, the intel about his identity was disclosed by me. When I heard this result, I was very surprised too! But this junior apprentice brother of mine can’t be measured with common sense. There must be a precious treasure that we don’t know on him! As long as we kill him, the precious treasure on him will be ours!”

Duan Fei’s expression turned dark and he said, “On what basis should this old man believe you?”

Qin Tian said coolly, “Actually, you already believe it! How can such a young and powerful Deity Realm powerhouse possibly appear in your Sky Foothill World? Grotto Profound Realm killing Heavenly Dao Realm, do you feel that it’s possible?”

Duan Fei fell silent. What Qin Tian said was right.

Regardless of looking from which angle, Ye Yuan did not seem like a Sky Foothill World’s person!

“Alright, I’ll cooperate with you! But the precious treasure on him belongs to me!” Duan Fei said solemnly.

Qin Tian shot him a glance and said with a cold smile, “You and I are clever men, don’t play this kind of sham! If Ye Yuan really has some precious treasure on him, none of us will let it go! At that time, each of us relies on our own abilities! Right now, the urgent matter on hand is to recover strength. That brat’s strength isn’t ordinary. Don’t look down on him because his realm is low!”

Duan Fei’s expression became stern and he nodded his head.

...

“It was my miscalculation. I didn’t expect that this guy even wore a profound divine artifact battle armor on him. I should have thought of it long ago!” Ye Yuan’s words revealed remorse and anger.

Bai Chen urged, “Master, you’re already very amazing! You nearly killed a half-step Origin Deity powerhouse! I don’t even dare to think about it!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Deity Realm powerhouses are people too, and people have weaknesses! Nobody stipulated that Grotto Profound martial artists can’t be killed. In a true life and death fight, what’s competed is never the cultivation realm. Bai Xiu, I assure you, Bai Rong’s grudge, I’ll definitely help you avenge it!”

Bai Xiu’s entire body trembled. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Grand Elder, I ... I was wrong! You’re currently heavily injured, don’t risk your life anymore. If something were to really happen to you, Bai Xiu would really find it hard to absolve my sins even if a hundred deaths!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since you all know my identity, I can’t be your grand elder anymore!”

Everyone was just about to speak, but Ye Yuan stopped it with a hand gesture and said, “My goal of coming to the Sky Foothill World is for the sake of the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone. As long as I find Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones in this place, I’ll leave. Now, we already don’t have a way out and can only charge inside. I’ll do my best to help you all seize precious treasures and let you guys have the strength to protect yourselves after going out. The rest, don’t need to say anymore.”

Unknowingly, everyone was already accustomed to relying on Ye Yuan.

Now that he said he wanted to leave, everyone actually had a reluctant feeling.

They all, these Sky Foothill people, actually had such sentiments towards an intruder. It was simply treasonous and heresy.

But, they all felt very natural at this time, without the slightest resistance.

This intruder protected them in all aspects, even rescuing Bai Xiu without balking at heavy injuries. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

But what about the Duan Fei as the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s divine official?

He wanted to doom everyone to death at all costs!

The public sentiment for or against, it was clear at a glance.

“But, these eight doors in front, which should we take?” Bai Chen could not resist asking.

Ye Yuan slowly got up and said coolly, “Just follow me.”

Ye Yuan walked toward a door very casually and walked straight inside.

Everyone exchanged glances and quickly followed after.

This was a gloomy and dark passage, causing the inability to see one’s hand in front of you.

Everyone just kept on walking and walking like that. No idea how long had passed either, everyone felt a blur before their eyes. A wave of terrifying temperature hit from head-on.

This was an enormous dome. Under the feet was endless lava!

In the center of the dome, a lone island suspended above the magma.

And on the island, something bloomed with multi-colored brilliances!

“That ... That is ...” Ye Yuan looked at that fruit with a dumbfounded look, his eyes full of incredulity.
