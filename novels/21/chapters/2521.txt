Chapter 2527: Reasoning Things Out!

In everyone’s eyes, Ye Yuan was just a little lamb who could be kneaded at will.

But who could have thought that he was actually a fierce tiger that broke the gates!

An ascender actually crippled a middle Lesser Sublime Heaven in one move. How could this not shock people?

Tang Yu’s two eyes narrowed slightly, a hint of surprise flashing across in his eyes.

Of course, it was also merely just a surprise; that was all.

That move earlier relied mostly on a movement technique to sneak attack.

Furthermore, he, Tang Yu, was not Li Zhengqiu.

Similarly middle Lesser Sublime Heaven, his strength was much stronger than Li Zhengqiu.

“When you said get lost, does it include this young master?” Tang Yu’s gaze turned cold as he said.

Ye Yuan looked him in the eye and said coolly, “Doesn’t include you!”

The corners of Tang Yu’s mouth curled slightly and he said with a smile, “At least you know what’s good for you!”

Everyone nodded slightly, thinking to themselves that this brat at least had some self-awareness, knowing that Young Master Yu was not to be pushed around.

But Ye Yuan continued, “You stay behind. I want to reason things out with you.”

The moment these words came out, everyone burst into laughter.

“Reason things out!?Hahaha,?this ascender is so funny, he actually wants to reason things out!”

“Tsk tsk,?this method is good, still don’t need to take anything, just directly reason things out.”

“Keeping up appearances to cover up his predicament! Want to posture, but also don’t want to offend Young Master Yu. How can there be such a good thing?”

… …

Everyone ridiculed for a while, greatly despising Ye Yuan’s behavior of bullying the weak but fearing the wicked.

Tang Yu also laughed in spite of himself and said, “Reason things out??Huhu,?this method is very fresh! Tell me, how do you want to reason things out with this young master?”

A hint of a faint smile hung at the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth and he said, “You’re sure that you want me to speak in front of so many people?”

Tang Yu also smiled and said, “To reason things out, one naturally has to speak in front of everyone!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Since you demand it strongly, okay!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

At the next moment, Ye Yuan moved!

Ye Yuan’s movement technique was erratic, rushing in front of Tang Yu.

Tang Yu seemed to have been long prepared, saying with a cold smile, “Reckless and blind thing! Bright Moon Emperor Hand!”

The moment Tang Yu made his move, it was akin to a luminous moon high above, illuminating the earth, the commotion incomparably shocking.

At this moment, no matter which angle Ye Yuan came from, he would be completely locked down by Tang Yu.

A hint of a mocking smile appeared on everyone’s faces.

Overestimating one’s own ability, was talking about this, right?

Fast movement technique had advantages, but what was more important was strength!

“Heh,?this fool is really ignorant! He probably doesn’t know that Young Master Yu has already obtained the qualification for Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s trial! Very soon, he’ll become Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s outer-sect disciple! This guy is simply using an egg to hit a rock!” Gui Tianyu said with a sneer.

“Dual Polarity!”

Ye Yuan’s Dual Polarity Sword Art suddenly erupted.

The swift and fierce sword energy forced everyone to glance sideways.

Boom!

A clash without the least bit of flashiness, only to see Tang Yu’s body smash into the hall like a cannonball.

Everyone was transfixed like wooden chickens.

How could he be so strong?

This ascender was clearly just lower Lesser Sublime Heaven, he actually clashed head-on with Young Master Yu and even had a complete victory?

“Brat, you’re dead for sure! Today, even immortals can’t save you too!” When Gui Tianyu saw this scene, he was overjoyed in his heart.

Boom!

Amidst the rubble, Tang Yu suddenly stood up. His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was filled with balefulness.

“Brat, you’re very good! You’re still the first one who dared to attack this young master in this imperial city! If I don’t grind your bones to dust today, this young master will write my Tang word upside down! Attack together for me!” Tang Yu said with an angry roar.

The few subordinates that Tang Yu brought were not weak. They were all middle Lesser Sublime Heaven.

Gui Tianyu and Lu Yuanjie knew that this was a chance to curry favor with Tang Yu and also ordered their subordinates to join the battlefield together.

Ye Yuan just gave a cold laugh, Universe Sword Formation suddenly blooming!

In Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, Ye Yuan’s sword formation was extremely suppressed, it could only open up to a radius of 100 plus feet.

But it was enough!

The moment the sword formation opened, no matter how many people they sent, Ye Yuan would make none of them return!

Inside the sword energy, the streaks of sword energies were incomparably sharp, wailing sounds echoing out.

Especially Gui Tianyu and Lu Yuanjie two people, they received Ye Yuan’s care.

Tang Yu was not in the sword formation, his eyes becoming wide-saucers.

He never dreamed that this unassuming ant by Yang Xuezhen’s side was actually so strong!

Sweeping away middle Lesser Sublime Heavens with the cultivation realm of lower Lesser Sublime Heaven!

After several dozen breaths, those family guards fell to the ground, wailing bitterly.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned to Tang Yu. The latter trembled all over, his eyes revealing a look of fear.

The demeanor of a young master previously was long gone already!

“W-What do you want to do? T-This young master warns you. I’m a member of the Tang Family. If you dare touch me, you’ll die very horrible!” Tang Yu brought out the Tang Family and was immediately much pluckier.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I don’t want to do anything. I just want to reason things out with you.”

Tang Yu heaved a sigh of relief, thinking to himself that this guy was still apprehensive of the Tang Family in the end.

“O-Okay, what’s there to reason with, you say!” Tang Yu hurriedly said.

Ye Yuan grinned, his figure erupted once more.

Dual Polarity Sword Formation!

A streak of cold light flashed and Tang Yu’s right arm flew up high.

He actually had an arm severed!

“ARGH!”?Tang Yu screamed miserably, soybean-sized sweat beads seeping out on his forehead.

“Y-You dare!” Tang Yu cried out painfully.

Ye Yuan came before him, patted his shoulder, and said smilingly, “If enmity isn’t settled amicably, there is no end to it! Just an arm only. So let’s let this matter slide. Young Master Yu, look, how about we become brothers?”

A guileless smile was hanging on Ye Yuan’s face.

Tang Yu was taken aback, only then, knowing what things Ye Yuan wanted to reason it out with him with.

Yang Xuezhen’s father was killed by the Li Family, but he was being the mediator, saying what if enmity was not settled amicably, there was no end to it, and even wanted Yang Xuezhen to marry over.

This kind of shameless action made Ye Yuan very upset.

Hence, he severed one of Tang Yu’s arms, but then he wanted to be brothers with him!

Yang Xuezhen who was by the side was long already struck silly with amazement.

She had always thought that she saved Ye Yuan’s life by bringing him out of Inklight Forest.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, he would have long been killed by those true spirits in Inklight Forest.

How could she have known that he did not need her to save at all!

Just based on Ye Yuan’s strength, how could Inklight Forest’s ordinary true spirits hurt him?

Ye Yuan could originally not have gotten involved in this messy situation, but he followed her to Eastward Imperial City for all sorts of reasons.

The goal was too obvious!

He came to help her!

Yang Xuezhen was very smart, how could she still not know what Ye Yuan had in mind?

At this moment, she felt extremely touched.

When she was in a state of despair, this man gave her reliance!

Of course, this was actually her misunderstanding.

Even without her, Ye Yuan would also come to Eastward Country.

Eastward Country was the closest to Inklight Forest, if Jadetrue Heavenly Sect sent people, they might very likely come to Eastward Country.

Ye Yuan was too far away from Inklight Forest currently, he did not feel at ease!

If Jadetrue Heavenly Sect discovered the Heavenspan World, it would all be over!

“Eh??Looking at your appearance, it seems like you don’t want to be brothers with me? Fine, not a brother, it’s enemies then. I’ll send you on your way then!” Ye Yuan looked at Tang Yu’s hateful gaze and said with a slight smile.
