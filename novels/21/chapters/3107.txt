Chapter 3106: Young Master Is Remarkable!

Whoosh!

A sword lacerated the sky, only to hear a rumble.

A tiny gap slowly opened in the Door of Eternal Life, unbelievably powerful saint force poured into Zhuo Bufan’s body.

Saint force flooding the body, Zhuo Bufan’s aura became even more fleeting and ephemeral.

He stood there as if representing Heaven.

Every movement and action was Dao accumulation!

This was Great Beyond!

“Zhuo Bufan is really hair-raisingly strong! He knocked open the Door of Eternal Life with just a sword!”

“One sword breaking through three realms back then, now, one sword knocking open eternal life! Hegemon Bufan is really god-like!”

“If not for being born in wrong times, Hegemon Bufan would definitely be able to reach blood race Progenitor’s realm. A pity, a pity!”

…..

Zhuo Bufan knocked open the Door of Eternal Life with just a sword, ascending to the realm of Great Beyond.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven burst into an uproar again.

Great Beyond Realm, it was hard for one to emerge in 100 thousand years too!

Although Supreme Hegemons broke through three seals, their strength formidable to the extreme, knocking open the Door of Eternal Life was even harder than breaking the three seals combined!

Great Beyond powerhouses were far too few.

The former Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven did not even have a single Supreme Hegemon. It could be seen how rare Great Beyond powerhouses were.

The present Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had six mighty Great Beyond powerhouses, but these six people were all of the true spirit race.

With Zhuo Bufan breaking through, this was Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s first Great Beyond powerhouse in the true sense, with an extraordinary significance.

Putting away the Door of Eternal Life, the disposition on Zhuo Bufan’s body underwent a huge change.

The current him seemed like a sword standing proudly in heaven and earth, giving people an extremely powerful feeling.

It was only to see his figure drift, arriving in front of Ye Yuan.

“I lost!”

No one expected that the first sentence after Zhuo Bufan broke through to Great Beyond Realm was actually to concede defeat!

Everyone was extremely shocked, because in that battle just now, it was clearly Zhuo Bufan who won by half a move before having a grand awakening.

Now, how did it become him admitting defeat?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You and I both held a trick in reserve. Why talk about admitting defeat?”

Zhuo Bufan had a serious look and shook his head. He said, “A sword of protection won’t be drawn toward your own people! But just now, you and I were both at the pinnacle; just half a step away from the final sword. I faintly felt the power of your sword of protection! This half a year of sword engraving, you’re the one who had a grand awakening!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Since you know that my sword won’t attack my own people, then what’s the point of determining a victor? You are you; I am me. Our Dao is different!”

Zhuo Bufan was taken aback and said with a nod, “Indeed, it was me who valued victory too much! Ye Yuan, what should we do next?”

Ye Yuan sighed slightly, his gaze looking into the distance as he said, “Progenitor Bloodstone’s recovery speed far exceeds my expectations! Now, not only is his strength fully recovered, his strength improved a step further. In less than three years, he’ll definitely come into being! In the struggle of the three great progenitors, it will likely still be him who wins!”

When these words came out, the crowd burst into an uproar.

Three years were too short!

The current Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was moving towards prosperity, but it had not completely grown up yet after all.

What they needed was time!

Mi Tian said, “I exchanged blows with him earlier and felt that he was unfathomable! Once Progenitor Bloodstone comes into being, I probably won’t even have the strength to fight back!”

Everyone’s heart shook again. Even Mi Tian acknowledged his superiority, which was equivalent to saying that they were already waiting for death!

No matter how many Great Beyond powerhouses, it was useless too!

In an instant, a haze enveloped everyone.

The joy of victory was also swept clean.

Ye Yuan said, “Senior Mi Tian, Brother Zhuo, you guys bring 800 bloodline warrior brothers to go and rush to the rescue of all the heavens, however many you can save counts. But remember, don’t go too deep in. Although we’re very strong, the blood race has more powerhouses! Once they group together somewhere, we won’t be a match either!”

Mi Tian said, “But this old man can’t command Zhao Yue them all!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, I had some comprehension in the Bloodcloud Grand Array and should be able to help them recover their original appearance.”

Mi Tian raised his brows and said in pleasant surprise, “That’s great!”

Zhuo Bufan said, “What about you?”

Ye Yuan said somberly, “After I treat them, I’ll start my closed-seclusion and prepare to assault Hegemon Realm!”

Mi Tian’s expression changed, and he said, “Do you … have confidence?”

Ye Yuan shook his head.

Zhuo Bufan said, “You’re our last hope! As long as you break through to Hegemon Realm, only then will there be hope of fighting with Progenitor Bloodstone! If you die, everything is over! You have to be careful in … overcoming the tribulation!”

Ye Yuan said solemnly, “Time doesn’t wait for me! I have a trace of Progenitor Bloodstone’s origin and can barely manage to sense his power. He’s currently much stronger compared to during the Labyrinth Divine Palace! Once he comes into being, it will likely be when he has completely transcended the Great Beyond! At that time, even if I break through to Hegemon Realm by a fluke, I also won’t have full assurance of winning against him! Do what we can, and we leave it up to fate then!”

Everyone was tongue-tied, all looking at each other, revealing a look of dismal.

…..

The war started again. Mi Tian led the army and moved out of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

In front of the troops, eight mighty Great Beyond powerhouses were standing shoulder to shoulder. It was a shocking line-up!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s powerhouses all felt like they were dreaming.

Eight mighty Great Beyond powerhouses, this was simply unimaginable in the past.

But Ye Yuan created this grand occasion with his own hands!

“What do you think, Zhao Yue?” Mi Tian asked Zhao Yue.

The current Zhao Yue, his body was big and tall, and his gaze was firm. He was no longer of that wild beast appearance.

There was nothing in this world that could not be refined!

Ye Yuan matched the blood race’s blood essence with the chaos heavenly medicines that he acquired in the Labyrinth Divine Palace. He then refined a chaos heavenly pill, finally curing Zhao Yue.

At present, he had already recovered his intellect and became the commander-in-chief of the 800 bloodline Hegemons!

Furthermore, his strength was a notch above Long Jian and the rest.

With a huge army rallying, Mi Tian saw that Zhao Yue seemed to have all sorts of emotions welling up in his mind. That was why he asked this.

“Young Master is remarkable!” Zhao Yue said.

Mi Tian was taken aback, not expecting that he actually gave such an answer.

He knew that the Zhao Yue back then was merely a minor character. His strength was merely Emperor Sakra Heaven.

Now, he recovered his intellect, but he was already at the Great Beyond Realm. Furthermore, he led hundreds of Hegemons. Mi Tian even thought that it was caused by him being rather excited.

He did not expect that Zhao Yue was actually feeling emotional about Ye Yuan.

After spending several months’ time treating Zhao Yue and the rest, Ye Yuan directly went into closed-seclusion.

Everyone knew that Ye Yuan was facing a life-and-death juncture!

On the day he left seclusion, it would be when he transcended his tribulation!

When the time came, heaven and earth would change colors!

“Oh, what do you mean?” Mi Tian said with a smile.

Zhao Yue said without hesitation, “This spectacular sight, Young Master can’t imagine it at all previously! Back then, the Labyrinth Divine Palace swept across all the heavens. It was also merely thus! And the powerhouses in the Labyrinth Divine Palace were all unrivaled geniuses. But we all, these people, are all a bunch of trash! Young Master transformed the rotten into something magical, letting us become peerless powerhouses! Without Young Master, there wouldn’t be us, these eight Great Beyond Realms, let alone them, these Hegemon Realms! Therefore, I’m filled with all sorts of emotions at Young Master’s remarkableness!”

Mi Tian thought about it. It was true!

Although he was a natural Great Beyond powerhouse, without Ye Yuan, he could not have recovered his strength at all.

Without Ye Yuan, it would naturally have been impossible for Long Jian and the others to break through to Great Beyond.

Regarding Zhuo Bufan, Zhao Yue, Mi Zhen, and a few more, these eight mighty Great Beyond Realms, were actually single handedly created by Ye Yuan!

This was really scary!

One could say that this Hegemon army that made all the heavens tremble was all single handedly created by Ye Yuan!

Mi Tian drew a deep breath and said, “Yeah, this kid is remarkable!”
