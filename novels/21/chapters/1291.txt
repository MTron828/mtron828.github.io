Chapter 1295: The Kind Wanru

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Liang Wanrong, Zhang Shun, and the group of guards, their eyes became wide-saucers, staring at those two figures on the elephant’s back in disbelief.

They even doubted it if they saw things wrongly or not!

The ones riding on the elephant’s back were none other than precisely the Ye Yuan and Liang Wanru, whom they thought had long already perished in the beast tide.

Liang Wanrong was dumbfounded. She did not expect that the ‘seniors’ she begged were the two of them!

But how was this possible?

What they were riding was a late-stage rank one divine beast!

Two good-for-nothings actually subdued a divine beast?

“How can you guys ... How can ...”

Liang Wanrong muttered under her breath, still not believing the truth that she saw in front of her.

Not just her, Zhang Shun also had a look of bewilderment. The Devilheaven Giant Elephant was very violent. It could be said to kill on sight. It was actually subdued by the two of them.

Ye Yuan gave them a glance and said with a faint smile, “You guys carry on playing, we’re just passing through and won’t disturb you all.”

Liang Wanrong was alarmed inwardly. Once Ye Yuan left, they would be dead for sure.

“Elder Sister, I’m your younger sister! Could it be that you’re going to watch your own biological sister be killed by these demonic beasts and do nothing?” Liang Wanrong yelled.

Liang Wanrong was very smart. She knew that Ye Yuan would not save her, but Liang Wanru would!

Sure enough, Liang Wanru’s lovely body trembled and used a pleading gaze to look at Ye Yuan.

That meaning was already very clear.

She hoped for Ye Yuan to save Liang Wanrong!

Ye Yuan sighed slightly. This girl was seriously too kind.

Even if Liang Wanrong treated her like that, she chose to tolerate it too.

However, Ye Yuan was not so kind-hearted.

This kind of viper-hearted woman, once he saved her, it might stir up some incidents in the future.

“Heh, using your own elder sister as bait to exchange for a chance for you to escape. Miss Wanrong, you’re really a good sister! Now, you want to exploit Miss Wanru’s kindness again?”

Liang Wanrong bit her lower lip tightly, tears welling up in her eyes. It was truly a sight that made people unable to help showing tender care.

“Sister, I was wrong! I really know that I was wrong! Just now, Wanrong was muddled for a moment too, that’s why I would do that kind of thing that’s worse than pigs or dogs! Sniff, sniff ...”

As she said, Liang Wanrong started sniveling. That appearance was delicate and touching.

Liang Wanru indeed softened her heart. She reached out her fair fingers and tugged the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves, the imploring look in her eyes even thicker.

Seeing this scene, Liang Wanrong secretly rejoiced.

This foolish elder sister was really a goody-two-shoes!

There was a chance!

Ye Yuan was silent and did not speak. Liang Wanru increased her strength again, tugging the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves. Tears were almost about to burst out.

Ye Yuan heaved a slight sigh and said, “Alright, I hope that you don’t regret it!”

Experiencing two lifetimes, Ye Yuan understood human nature too well.

Liang Wanrong, this kind of person, absolutely belonged to that incorrigible category.

Saving her today, not only would she not be grateful, she might even harbor resentment instead. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing Ye Yuan relent, Liang Wanrong and the group of guards all revealed looks of wild ecstasy on their faces.

“Great! Thank you! Thank you, Brother-In-Law!”

Liang Wanrong blurted out, directly calling Ye Yuan as her brother-in-law.

Ye Yuan sneered coldly in his heart. Liang Wanrong’s performance was too clumsy in his eyes.

Want to act, also got to act more realistically. Cover up that hint of killing intent in your eyes, alright?

However, Liang Wanru blushed heavily and waved her hands repeatedly.

The two of them were sitting on the elephant’s back currently, one in front, one at the back. Although Ye Yuan was very proper, it was indeed somewhat ambiguous.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Guys, make way!”

Under Ye Yuan’s order, those demonic beasts indeed clamored to open up a path.

Seeing this scene, Zhang Shun’s eyes popped out!

He thought that these demonic beasts were afraid of the Devilheaven Giant Elephant. Looking at it now, they were actually afraid of Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan was merely a cripple whose divine sea was crippled. How could he possibly make these demonic beasts fear him like so?

On what basis?

More importantly, among these demonic beasts, there was even the Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard and Devilheaven Giant Elephant, this kind of divine beasts!

How could Zhang Shun know that even though Ye Yuan’s cultivation was completely wasted, the dragon race aura on his body was still there?

Dustless had said that the dragon race was an extremely noble divine beast bloodline even in the Heavenspan World too.

After Ye Yuan broke through to Deity Realm, his bloodline already evolved to divine rank.

How could these demonic beasts in the Myriad Beast Forest dare to be unbridled in front of him?

A mere beast tide was nothing to fear to Ye Yuan at all.

Yet, Liang Wanrong fancied herself smart and played out a disgusting scene, completely exposing her nature.

Zhang Shun stared at Ye Yuan, his gaze full of fear.

This man that came out of God knows where seemed to be very extraordinary!

He felt more and more that Ye Yuan was an enigmatic existence.

Clearly could not even condense divine essence, but his means emerged in endless streams.

To be able to make the demonic beasts in the beast tide afraid to such an extent, even Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses could not do it too!

“Zhang Shun thanks Brother Ye for your life-saving grace on behalf of my brothers! Where I’ve offended previously, I hope that Brother Ye is magnanimous enough to forgive!” Zhang Shun bowed toward Ye Yuan and said with a salute.

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “Want to thank, thank Miss Wanru. With my temper, I absolutely won’t save you all.”

Zhang Shun could not help choking up. He did not think that Ye Yuan was so apathetic about giving face.

But at this time, it was also not up to him to not be unhappy. Hence, he gave thanks to Liang Wanru again.

Ye Yuan and Liang Wanru, the two of them, rode the Devilheaven Giant Elephant and passed right through the Myriad Beast Forest before putting it back.

Along the way, it was awe-inspiring.

Liang Wanrong could not even straighten her legs when riding in front of the Devilheaven Giant Elephant. She could only drag her injured body and walk together with the group of guards.

Along the way, she was also much more obedient and did not dare to be as arrogant and bossy as before.

When the Devilheaven Giant Elephant left, it even raised its trunk, like it was paying tribute to Ye Yuan.

Seeing this scene, the group of guards could not help clicking their tongues in wonder.

This scene, they had never seen before yet.

These few days, Ye Yuan already completely absorbed the medicinal strength of the Profound Essence Pill. But due to him being too heavily injured this time, his fleshy body only recovered 40-50%.

Traveling several more days, this party finally arrived at Jewelhill City!

Zhang Shun clasped his hands at Ye Yuan and said, “Brother Ye, this place is Jewelhill City already. I wonder what your plans are?”

Ye Yuan gave Liang Wanru a glance and said, “Miss Wanru’s life-saving grace, this Ye hasn’t repaid yet. How about I go to the Liang Family together with you all, may I?”

Ye Yuan originally planned on parting ways with this group of people after coming to Jewelhill City.

As for Liang Wanru’s life-saving grace, he would naturally repay it in the future.

But now, he could not quite feel reassured about Liang Wanru. He could only enter the Liang Family together with her.

Actually, Zhang Shun hoped for Ye Yuan to leave. He was very apprehensive towards Ye Yuan right now. Furthermore, along the way, the things that Ye Yuan saw were too many. It might be detrimental to the second miss.

But Ye Yuan wanting to enter the Liang Family, he really did not have a reason to refuse.

With Miss Wanru around, it was also useless if he rejected it.

When Liang Wanru saw Ye Yuan say so, her eyes revealed a look of pleasant surprise.

“Hurray, hurray! For Brother-In-Law to be able to enter the Liang Family, it’s really excellent! As the younger sister, I’ll definitely repay your life-saving grace properly!” But Liang Wanrong agreed with a cheerful expression.

Zhang Shun glanced at her and sighed helplessly.

This little lass, does she really think that Ye Yuan is so easy to deal with?

Him entering the Liang Family, whether it was catching a turtle in a jar, or inviting a wolf into the house, it was really hard to say!
