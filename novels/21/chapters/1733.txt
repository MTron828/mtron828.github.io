Chapter 1737 Betrayal

It was extremely smooth when they came out. Ye Yuan held a Netherworld Dark Fragrance Flower in his hand. So those Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs did not dare to approach at all.Even the bug king also did not dare to easily come forward.

It could be seen from this that this thing was really the Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs’ nemesis.

Following that, the party stepped onto the road of finding the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit.

And in this party, Ye Yuan’s status was also quietly changing.

At first, everyone felt that his strength was lacking and that he was here to take advantage of benefits.

But now, everyone knew that Ye Yuan could forcefully contend with the bug king. He absolutely had the strength to contend for superiority with Duan Peng and Luo Yong.

After half a month, under Dunn Peng’s leadership, the party finally arrived near the proximity of that cave.

Duan Peng’s expression suddenly changed and he said, “Not good, someone came before us!”

In the grass patches ahead, some footprints were faintly discernible. Clearly, someone had beaten them to it.

Ye Yuan said, “No need to worry. According to your description, the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit isn’t fully mature currently. Even if someone discovers it, they also would not go and harvest it right now.”

Duan Peng’s heart eased up slightly, but still became somewhat worried.

Having more competitors, this was not a good thing.

At this point, one could only showcase their true abilities.

Right at this time, seven to eight figures dashed out of the dense words, completely blocking off the road.

The one in the lead was a burly man, holding a large ringed saber in his hand and overwhelmingly intimidating.

Duan Peng’s face changed and he cried out in shock, “Qi Dongyu! It’s you all!”

Qi Dongyu laughed and said, “Heh, I was wondering who it was, turns out that it’s you! Duan Peng, you’re also here for the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit, right? Get lost, this place is taken charge by your father!”

The other squad had eight people. Just the Sixth Firmament Divine Lords had four. Hence, Qi Dongyu did not take Duan Peng seriously at all.

Duan Peng’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Qi Dongyu, what right do you have to do this? This place was discovered by me first!”

Qi Dongyu burst into laughter and said, “You discovered it? Hahaha, Duan Peng, do you feel that I am bored and specially came to amuse me? What right? Based on the fact that I win in numbers! Eh? Isn’t this Younger Brother Luo Yong?”

Qi Dongyu suddenly saw Luo Yong at Duan Peng’s side and was clearly a little surprised.

When Luo Yong saw Qi Dongyu, he was immediately wildly ecstatic inwardly.

Qi Dongyu seeing him at this time, he chuckled and said, “Elder Brother Qi, I didn’t expect to run into you here! F*cking hell, I have had enough! Elder Brother, I’ll join you all right now!”

As he said, Luo Yong’s figure moved, directly dashing over.

Duan Peng’s face changed and he said in a cold voice, “Luo Yong, what’s the meaning of this?”

Luo Yong sneered and said, “What’s the meaning? Heh heh, along the way, I have had enough of you annoying cowards! You guys opposed me in all aspects for this kid, and even hope for me to help you? If not for the sake of the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit, I would have quit long ago! Now, running into Elder Brother Qi, your father naturally has to join their company!”

The moment Yu Jing heard this, she said angrily, “Luo Yong, it was clearly you who made things difficult for Ye Yuan in all aspects along the way. Now, you’re actually playing the blame game!”

Luo Yong smiled coldly and said, “You slut, shut up for your father! You clearly know that I’m interested in you, yet you engage in lovers talk with this gigolo along the way! It was on purpose, wasn’t it?”

Duan Peng said in a solemn voice, “Luo Yong, you dare to betray your team! Do you still want to survive in this circle in the future?”

Qi Dongyu had been observing from the sidelines all along and already pretty much understood the situation on Duan Peng’s side.

Seeing Duan Peng questioning, he spoke up, “You rest assured, no one will know. These few are all brothers that this Qi can trust. If they don’t say, naturally no one will know.”

This meaning was already very clearly, they were prepared to murder them to keep their mouths shut at this time.

Hearing that, Duan Peng’s expression changed drastically, but Luo Yong got it and let out a wild laugh as he said, “Hahaha, Duan Peng, do you see it? This is called brothers! Want to blame, blame that brat!”

Qi Dongyu said to Luo Yong, “Coming out this time, I was originally going to call you, Brother. Seeing that you haven’t returned yet, I missed you. But I didn’t expect to meet here.”

These two people were the so-called people of the same ilk being drawn to each other. Their relationship was very good.

Otherwise, Luo Yong also would not immediately turn traitor the moment he saw Qi Dongyu.

Luo Yong said with a loud laugh, “Elder Brother, this trip, this Luo doesn’t want anything. Just kill this kid! I hope that Elder Brother will lend me a helping hand!”

Qi Dongyu looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Younger Brother Luo, against a Third Firmament Divine Lord, you actually still need me to take action? What’s with you?”

Luo Yong said with a solemn look, “Elder Brother, don’t underestimate this kid. He previously clashed with a peak middle-stage rank four bug king and didn’t fall into a disadvantageous situation. His strength is absolutely not behind yours and mine!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions on Qi Dongyu’s side all changed slightly.

A Third Firmament Divine Lord could actually clash with a peak middle-stage rank four bug king, this was too fake, right?

However, Qi Dongyu also knew that at this time, Luo Yong absolutely would not crack jokes with him. Hence, he also took it seriously.

“Wang Xiao, the three of you deal with Duan Peng! This kid, I’ll attack together with Younger Brother Luo. The others, apart from that girlie, kill them all!” Qi Dongyu arranged things.

Yu Jing panicked when she saw the situation and said, “Ye Yuan, quickly go! With your strength, you can definitely escape!”

Following Luo Yong’s betrayal, it was currently a nine-versus-five situation.

Furthermore, among the other side’s nine people, there were five who were Sixth Firmament Divine Lord experts!

Even though Yu Jing had witnessed Ye Yuan’s strength before, she did not think that Ye Yuan could still defy the heavens under this sort of situation.

Qi Dongyu laughed loudly when he heard it and said, “Escape? Girlie, don’t you know that my, Qi’s speed, is unparalleled under the heavens? With me around, he’ll be hard-pressed to escape even if he grew wings!”

The Ye Yuan who had been silent all along suddenly smiled and said, “Escape? When did I say that I was going to escape?”

Qi Dongyu laughed when he heard that and said, “Punk, very gutsy! However ... it’s no use! Resign yourself to fate!”

Ye Yuan ignored him, but looked toward Luo Yong and said, “I didn’t fuss over it with you previously, but I didn’t expect that you went from bad to worse and even want to doom your companions to death now. People like you shouldn’t live in this world!”

Luo Yong laughed loudly and said, “I shouldn’t live in this world? Hahaha, Ye Yuan, this is the funniest joke that I’ve heard since I entered the mountain! Elder Brother Qi, don’t talk rubbish with him any longer. Let us make him know who shouldn’t live in this world!”

“Okay! I’ll challenge this kid, and see if he’s as impressive as you said!”

As he said, Qi Dongyu brandished the large ringed saber and hacked toward Ye Yuan.

At the same time, Luo Yong moved too!

With two mighty Sixth Firmament Divine Lords attacking at the same time, the commotion was astonishing.

Especially Qi Dongyu, his speed was really very fast.

The seemingly cumbersome great ringed saber arrived in front of Ye Yuan’s face in a blink of an eye.

Ye Yuan’s expression did not change, a seal rapidly forming in his hand!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan displayed spatial law, dodging Qi Dongyu’s saber nimbly. Taking the chance where his saber momentum already died down, the seal suddenly released!

Nirvana Seal!

Luo Yong knew that Qi Dongyu’s saber could not hack Ye Yuan and was just about to follow up with a sword, but discovered that a terrifying energy undulation was sent towards him!

Bang!

A loud bang, Luo Yong directly flew out backward, fresh blood spraying wildly, his aura withering rapidly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You seemed to have misunderstood something. Not killing you is because you’re too weak, and not because you’re too strong,” Ye Yuan said coolly.
