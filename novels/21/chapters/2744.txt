Chapter 2750: Insurmountable Opponent!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“No way, can’t hold on anymore! This kind of cultivation, I can’t see any hope at all!”

“Too strong! Strong until it makes people despair!!

“Could it be that Brother Ye is a wooden head? After a series of failures, he can actually endure!”

… …

In the number ten cultivation room, wailing sounds were continuous.

The opponent was too strong, they despaired greatly.

Ye Yuan’s improvement stimulated these people, they came to the number one cultivation room to cultivate one after another.

The cultivation room was very big, enough to accommodate hundreds of people!

The opponent that they chose was all the 1000th place Wang Xiyun.

But, even if it was the 1000th place, they ended up being thrashed brutally too.

Being abused time and again, this was not a good experience.

They discovered to their dismay that no matter how hard they worked, it was impossible to surpass Wang Xiyun.

Even if Wang Xiyun was in the state of Jade Sovereign Heaven.

However, at the thought of how Ye Yuan could actually fight over 200 matches in a row, they could not help but admire Ye Yuan even more.

Cultivation required confidence too.

Consecutive losses after fighting and going on a constant losing streak, this kind of high intensity cultivation was not what everyone could persevere with.

However, there was a figure that remained persistant in the grand array.

Saint Exalt Big Yellow!

At this time, Big Yellow returned to his original form. Teetering on his feet under Wang Xiyun’s heavy pressure, he looked like he was about to lose.

They had already fought close to a hundred matches, Big Yellow lost all of them without exception!

“Big stupid bull, you’re a little stronger than those guys, but you’re still too dumb! This kind of cultivation doesn’t hold much significance to you. Better to give up,” Wang Xiyun dealt Big Yellow a palm casually and said with enough strength left to spare.

Big Yellow gritted his teeth and said, “I know that I’m stupid, but I can’t give up! Giving up here, I’ll never be able to keep up with Master Ye’s footsteps anymore!”

Wang Xiyun said in surprise, “Is this Master Ye that you speak of very formidable?”

Big Yellow said, “Of course he’s very formidable! He’s even more formidable than you!”

Wang Xiyun snorted coldly and smacked Big Yellow flying with a palm and said, “You people, each is weaker than the other, how strong can he be?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Big Yellow did not care and crawled to his feet and said, “Half a month ago, he already won the 100th place Sun Qi! Do you think he’s strong or not?”

A hint of surprise flashed across Wang Xiyun’s beautiful eyes and she said, “He actually defeated Sun Qi!”

Big Yellow nodded and said, “That was still the battle result of half a month ago! Now, he must have walked even further!”

Wang XIyun said disdainfully, “The top 100 powerhouses, each is more monstrous than the last. Do you really think that it’s so easy to win?”

Big Yellow did not explain either, continuing to practice.

… …

Over here, many people could not take this kind of high intensity cultivation and returned to the number one cultivation room again to watch Ye Yuan cultivate.

The moment they came, they could not help jumping in fright.

“This … This is Qiu Chen who is 89th place?”

“So fast! It’s only been a short half a month. Younger Brother Ye directly challenged ten people already?”

“Impossible! He must have directly skipped the ten people in front! You all look, it’s just a few moves and he already can’t hold on anymore! The two people’s gap is too big!”

… …

At this time, the opponent that Ye Yuan was fighting was Qiu Chen who was ranked 89th.

The cultivation room did not limit the opponents to challenge. Cultivators could challenge anyone at any time.

Of course, if the opponent that you chose was too strong, it was basically the outcome of being one-shotted. There would be no cultivation effect at all, wasting heavenly crystals in vain.

This cultivation room consumed a lot of heavenly crystals. Ye Yuan was not immensely wealthy and could not afford such consumption either.

Bang!

In the sword formation, Qiu Chen struck a palm out, directly shattering Ye Yuan’s sword formation.

Ye Yuan spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, flying out backward.

Merely ten moves from start to end!

This Qiu Chen’s strength was much stronger than Sun Qi’s.

Qiu Chen was the strongest opponent that Ye Yuan encountered in this half a month.

In Jade Sovereign Heaven Realm, his strength was powerful until it made people despair!

This guy was strong all the way from Jade Sovereign Heaven to Saint Sovereign Heaven!

In reality, these heaven’s chosen were already extremely powerful before Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But, after entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace, these people became even more monstrous.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace’s reputation as the number one great sect was no joke.

But this Qiu Chen was clearly already freakishly powerful at Jade Sovereign Heaven.

Compared to the rest, his improvement in Saint Sovereign Heaven was not that great.

“You are too weak!” Qiu Chen appeared very haughty and cold as he said coolly.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and did not speak.

This cultivation room could even project the personalities of these geniuses back then.

There was naturally no need to get angry with an illusion.

What he wanted to do was beat the opponent.

This Qiu Chen was indeed amazingly talented. Being at the Middle Jade Sovereign Heaven Realm, he was actually five laws transformation!

Furthermore, he already cultivated to the realm of grand completion fourth form!

Ye Yuan reckoned that Qiu Chen’s ranking in Jade Sovereign Heaven might be even stronger than the 50th place!

However, he did not plan on changing opponents.

Ye Yuan had his own pride too!

“Younger Brother Ye, it isn’t very effective for you to challenge by skipping like this. It’s better to do it routinely.” By the side, the Saint Exalt Skyfortune who was finished being abused urged.

Ye Yuan was taken aback and knew that the other party was mistaken and said with a smile, “There’s no harm.”

Finished saying, he meditated to regulate his breathing for a moment and entered battle again.

With 13 moves, defeated again!

Fighting again, 12 moves, defeated again!

Round after round, it was as if Ye Yuan did not know exhaustion, continuing to fight like a moth flying into the fire.

When Saint Exalt Skyfortune saw the situation, he shook his head slightly and said, “This opponent is too strong. There’s no meaning in Younger Brother Ye persisting like this!”

By the side, Saint Exalt Purplesun smiled and said, “Younger Brother Ye is peerlessly talented and arrogant at heart and haughty in manner. He can’t accept this fact. But, this opponent, he really chose wrongly!”

Saint Exalt Skyfortune nodded and said, “Five laws transformation, grand completion fourth form. This kind of attainment is virtually invincible in Jade Sovereign Heaven! Cultivating to grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven, it’s likely that he won’t be in a disadvantageous position in the slightest when facing off with us! This kind of genius is too difficult to surpass!”

Saint Sovereign Heaven versus Jade Sovereign Heaven, that was absolutely overpowering!

Even if one reached half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, they were also not a foe that could last one exchange with a Saint Sovereign Heaven.

This was the difference in level, it was not what a bit of rule power could change.

But, even they all, these Saint Sovereign Heavens, acknowledged Qiu Chen’s strength. It could be seen how strong he was!

“Actually, even if he loses to the opponent, it’s not some shameful thing either. Younger Brother Ye he is already strong enough!” Saint Exalt Purplesun said.

“Yeah, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s disparity is seriously too powerful! I can’t even last three moves with the 1000th place, Wang Xiyun! This kind of disparity, it can only make people give rise to despair in their hearts. It’s not even what one can call as cultivation or training at all!

These people had already accepted reality.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace’s disciples were too strong!

They were from completely different worlds from these Labyrinth Divine Palace disciples.

Ye Yuan really encountered a formidable foe this time.

In the Land of Exile, he had once encountered the five laws Han Yi.

But this Qiu Chen was much stronger than Han Yi.

A Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum’s five laws and a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum’s five laws were totally different concepts.

Because he was defeated too quickly, the matches were carried out quickly too.

Over 30 matches, the longest that Ye Yuan lasted was merely 20 moves.

His transformed swords were frail until they could not withstand a single hit in front of Qiu Chen.

“I advise that you don’t need to struggle anymore. I’m an opponent that you won’t be able to surmount.. Apart from obliterating your willpower, there’s no cultivation effect for you like this at all,” Qiu Chen stood with his hands behind his back as he said haughtily.
