Chapter 2415: Sorry About It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“But, Your Excellency, this boy’s spacetime law is transcendent. Wanting to keep him behind is too difficult! I think that he won’t be stupid enough to rush to our camp again,” Yu Qin said with an ugly expression.

Dealing with Ye Yuan, even he, this peak middle-stage Nine-marks, was useless.

Unless it was Lord Daymeld personally holding down the fort, only then would there be a possibility of catching him.

Furthermore, it was also merely just a possibility!

Daymeld gave a cold laugh and said, “If he doesn’t come out, we’ll force him out!”

Yu Qin’s eyes lit up and he said, “Your Excellency’s meaning is ...”

Daymeld said in a solemn voice, “Pass down the orders. All armies join forces at Iron Wire Ridge and march toward the Middle Realms!”

Everyone trembled all over. This move was going to start a full-scale war!

... ...

While on the other side, when the news of crushing the Divine Children Legion was sent back, the entire camp was seething with excitement.

Actually, before setting off, everyone was not optimistic about this army of young masters.

Without a doubt, this army that Ye Yuan led, each person’s strength was very strong.

But each of them was stubborn and unruly, and they also never experienced the cruelty of war.

This kind of army, the combat effectiveness was actually very limited.

But no one could have thought that it was precisely this army of young masters that beat the Divine Children Legion which had yet to taste a single defeat and had unparalleled combat power, until they were virtually completely annihilated!

During this period of time, Ni Xuan’s biggest headache was this Divine Children Legion.

This legion came and went without a trace. Furthermore, their combat strength was extremely strong, he was completely helpless.

Who would have expected that the moment Ye Yuan came, he resolved this problem in less than a month’s time!

He was still rather discontented with Ye Yuan previously. But now, he was really convinced.

Furthermore, he even heard that Ye Yuan fused time, space, and sword, three great laws, and slew three Nine-marks powerhouses by himself.

This kind of talent was simply too heaven-defying!

Although he did not know the origin of Saint Azure, the talent that Ye Yuan displayed was likely the human race’s last hope!

Regarding this point, he was well-aware in his heart!

“Hahaha ... Terrific lad, well done! Got quite the air of an ancestor!”

Ni Xuan personally went 30 miles out of the camp to welcome the army led by Pang Zhen.

As soon as they met, Ni Xuan gave Pang Zhen a punch to his chest as he said with a big laugh.

The general welcoming in person, this was an extremely high standard of courtesy already.

Pang Zhen was normally serious in speech and manner. But at this time, he felt like he somewhat benefited too and smiled embarrassedly.

“This was all Lord Saint Azure’s credit. He practically broke the Divine Children Legion with his power alone. We almost became his burden,” Pang Zhen said rather embarrassedly.

“Hahaha, you kid, have made progress! Not puffed up by success nor dismayed by failure, this is the style of a general!” Ni Xuan said with a laugh.

At this time, Ni Xuan was also shocked in his heart.

Just one battle, this army seemed to have been completely reborn.

Although the numbers were significantly reduced in this unpredictable army, their mental outlook and aura were already completely different from before.

One could see that if this army was sent out again, their combat power would inevitably soar!

“Just what origins does this Lord Saint Azure have?” Ni Xuan could not refrain from exclaiming in his heart.

In the unpredictable army, many people benefited immensely in this battle.

After they returned, the strength of the vast majority of the people all made a fair degree of progress.

But very soon, the divine race army made irregular movements.

Ni Xuan got the battle report that all of the divine race’s armies were already assembled in Iron Wire Ridge, and had clear intentions of advancing.

Receiving this news, the myriad races coalition forces became disorderly at once.

In the battles previously, both sides maintained relative restraint. The true experts did not participate in the battles or rarely took part in the fights.

But this time, the divine race suddenly bore down menacingly, catching everyone by surprise.

One had to know, the divine race’s Ancestor Tian Qing’s injuries still had not recovered.

Rashly launching a full-scale war now was an unwise move for both parties.

At the human camp, the myriad races’ heads were all gathered together.

“Are the people of the divine race crazy? Heavenly Dao Samsara hasn’t started yet and they are in a great rush for the decisive battle? Is this going to be an all-or-nothing?” A stone race major power said rather irritatedly.

Clearly, the leaders of the coalition forces present were extremely apprehensive of the divine race. They were not willing to fight this battle, especially those smaller races. After the battle, they might get annihilated.

“I feel that we still have to avoid the edge! This battle can’t be fought!”

“Yes, the divine race is powerful. We can’t go hand-to-hand with them. If we do, we’ll definitely lose!”

“I think so too! Our coalition forces better avoid the edge for the time being and retreat and stand on the defensive in the Middle Realms!”

... ...

The various races’ leaders were all not willing to fight to the death.

Right now, the myriad races still had depth, they would rather retreat than fight to the death.

The White Tiger Clan’s major power suddenly said, “Before this, the divine race’s battles have been very restrained. The sudden decisive battle this time is after the unpredictable army defeated the Divine Children Legion, could it be that there’s some connection between the two? Commander Ni, what do you think?”

If Ye Yuan was here, he would be able to recognize that this person was precisely the Bai Chen who imparted to him the Heavenly Dragon Mark in the abyss seal back then.

He was now precisely the White Tiger Clan’s leader!

Ni Xuan remained silent. Only when he heard Bai Chen ask about it did he slowly say, “If my conjectures are right, they probably did it to force Lord Saint Azure to show himself!”

The stone race’s leader laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Commander Ni, are you joking with us? The Saint Azure that you speak of is indeed incredible! But it’s also impossible for the divine race to be in a great rush to have a decisive battle for him alone, right?”

“Yeah! No matter how powerful Saint Azure is, he’s also merely Heavenly Emperor Realm! It’s at most a few hundred years before the divine race’s progenitor will come into being. These few centuries, Saint Azure alone can change the battle situation?”

... ...

The myriad races’ leaders all had disdainful looks. They were not that respectful toward a junior.

Even if it was due to Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ face, they were still very disdainful toward Ye Yuan in their hearts.

Ni Xuan was very disdainful toward these people’s faces.

What time was it already, they were still thinking about protecting personal interest and staying out of trouble!

“Sorry about this. If I didn’t guess wrongly, the divine race probably decided to start a full-scale war because of me.” Right at this time, a voice came from outside.

Following that, a youth in white robes slowly walked in and entered the camp.

Who was it if not Ye Yuan?

The stone race’s leader was the most scornful. When he saw Ye Yuan, he said with a cold smile, “What a shameless boasting brat! Don’t think that just because we call you Saint Azure, you can regard yourself as very important! This war will still rely on Deva Fourth and Fifth Blight powerhouses!’

When Bai Chen and the rest saw Ye Yuan, they could not help sighing ruefully.

The little baby back then already grew into a leviathan of a region now!

By the side, the Dragon Clan’s leader, Long Yi, directly knelt down toward Ye Yuan.

“Long Yi pays respect to Lord Progenitor!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Get up. I’ve already brought Xiaochun they all back.”

Long Yi hurried said, “It was Long Yi who was incompetent in protecting, making Xiaochun fall into danger! Long Yi deserves death!”

Ye Yuan was the Dragon Clan’s samsara progenitor. Even a major power like Long Yi was a head lower in front of Ye Yuan too.

He knew that Long Xiaochun and Ye Yuan were close relatives. That was why he said that. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “No need. Who can stay aloof from the Doomsday Battle? This matter isn’t your fault!”
