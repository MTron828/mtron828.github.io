Chapter 1337: Correspondence Point

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Lesser Heavenspan Mountain?” Ye Yuan muttered.

A surge of gentle breath pervaded around Ye Yuan. Very soon, the injuries that his divine soul suffered became much better.

Ye Yuan had obtained the World Suppressing Stele for a long time and had yet to see before this appearance.

When he faced this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, it was like when he was still at the Immortal Grove World facing Heavenly Dao, that sort of feeling.

Vast like the ocean, elusive and intangible!

“This Lesser Heavenspan Mountain is the World Suppressing Stele’s main body, holding in store Great Dao! Even a Heavenly Emperor won’t dare to investigate it like you either. But you actually dared to profane Heaven’s prestige!” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan palpitated with anxiety and fear when he heard that. The rock brought down from the Heavenspan Mountain was indeed extraordinary!

“Since that’s the case, why did you remind me earlier?” Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said.

“How would I know that you, brat, are so reckless. I was just about to warn you, but you had already made a move!” Dustless also said crossly.

Ye Yuan smiled embarrassedly and stopped talking.

He saw that this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was extraordinary just now and sent out his divine sense at the behest of supernatural powers, wanting to investigate it, but did not know that it was actually so dangerous.

Seeing Ye Yuan shut up, Dustless continued, “The Lesser Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove can only be for visualizing comprehensions, so one mustn’t use divine sense to investigate it. This Lesser Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove is unfathomable. With Immortal Grove’s realm, he’s also unable to pry into one ten-thousandth of it! He guessed that this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain might very likely be a supreme treasure inoculated by the Heavenspan Mountain, containing this portion of Heavenly Dao’s might. It’s just a shame that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove did not break through to Heavenly Emperor Realm. Otherwise, he should be able to pry into a trace of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s secrets.”

Ye Yuan’s jaw dropped, and he exclaimed in shock, “This Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s background is so great? If I fully comprehend the Heavenly Dao contained inside the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, would I be able to reach the realm of Dao Ancestor?”

Dustless smiled coldly and said, “Heh, you’re dreaming! Do you think that this Heavenly Dao is so easy to comprehend? Put away that unrealistic thought of yours! For you to visualize this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, being able to fully comprehend the first level cultivation method within 5000 years is already very impressive.”

The cultivation of Deity Realm powerhouses was easily in the units of ten thousand years.

Over 5000 years, that was really not considered a long time.

Dustless’s words were already regarding Ye Yuan highly.

He knew that when Ye Yuan was at the Immortal Grove World, he entered Dao with alchemy, and even triggered the resonance of Great Dao.

But in martial arts, he did not believe that Ye Yuan still had this kind of heaven-defying talent.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Got it, Senior. I’ll be starting now. If the outside world has any activities, wake me up in time.”

Dustless nodded his head and disappeared.

Ye Yuan looked at the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain ahead and murmured under his breath, “Lesser Heavenspan Mountain ... already has such power. I wonder how terrifying the real Heavenspan Mountain is! Could it be that even Dao Ancestor, that level of realm, all have to comprehend Dao on the Heavenspan Mountain?!”

Ye Yuan discovered that this World Suppressing Stele was really a heaven-defying treasure.

Disregarding that its potential was limitless, for others to want to go to the Heavenspan Mountain to comprehend Great Dao, they must arrive at the Heavenspan Mountain in person.

But, as long as he possessed this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, it was equivalent to Ye Yuan carrying along a Heavenly Dao by his side, able to comprehend at any time.

This kind of advantage, probably if anyone knew about it, they would all be envious to the extreme, right?

Maybe even Dao Ancestors would be moved too!

Then Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang sending Kanuo into the Immortal Grove World, maybe the objective was precisely it.

It was just that Ye Yuan felt that Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang probably only suspected and did not know the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s true face.

Otherwise, he probably would not send a puny little Kanuo over.

This kind of heaven-defying treasure, he would absolutely make a move personally!

His thoughts arriving here, Ye Yuan was secretly alarmed too.

The treasures on him were more heaven-defying one after another. In the future, better be a little more careful, and he mustn’t spill the beans. Otherwise, the consequences were too ghastly to imagine.

Especially this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, once exposed, what he would have to face would likely be the entire Heavenspan World’s pursuit.

Ye Yuan abandoned all distracting thoughts and started visualizing the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

This Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was indeed a heaven-defying treasure. But how much one was able to comprehend still had to depend on the martial artist’s comprehension abilities.

Those with poor comprehension abilities, even if they obtained the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, it was no use either; their accomplishments limited.

But even if one’s talent was any better, they also had to accumulate little by little.

Ordinary martial artists relying solely on comprehension, they might not be able to break through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm all their life.

With the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, this process was bound to be shortened by several times.

Even if one was any dumber, cultivating to Origin Deity Realm was not a problem too.

However, what Ye Yuan wanted to comprehend was not just Heavenly Dao, but comprehending a set of cultivation methods that belonged to himself from the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

This difficulty was immense.

Put on some people, they might never be able to complete it all their lives.

The cultivation method that Ye Yuan wanted to comprehend was a complete cultivation system.

He needed to comprehend Heavenly Dao while perfecting the cultivation method, all the way until this cultivation method did not have the slightest flaw, could he start cultivating.

With Ye Yuan’s current realm, he would definitely be unable to immediately complete a set of cultivation methods.

What he could do now was create the first level of the cultivation method, so as to ensure that he could cultivate to grand completion Grotto Profound.

In addition, he even had to leave behind scalability for the second level cultivation method, laying down the foundation for him to create the cultivation method in the future.

This process did not allow the slightest bit of errors.

Using a word to describe, it was hard!

As hard as ascending to the heavens!

Therefore, that was why Dustless would become angry and disappointed.

Moreover, creating whatever rank of cultivation method completely depended on the individual’s comprehension ability.

Those with high comprehension ability could create very heaven-defying cultivation methods; those with low comprehension ability, the cultivation method created might be hard to continue when cultivated to Origin Deity Realm.

Hence, there was a possibility that Ye Yuan doing so would gain less than what was lost.

Dustless did not feel that Ye Yuan could create a more powerful cultivation method than Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

After all, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s cultivation method could be cultivated to Transcendent Heavenly Emperor Realm!

No matter how powerful, how formidable could it be?

Except, Ye Yuan refused to believe in heresy!

To Ye Yuan, rather than pinning his hopes on a Dao Ancestor helping, it was better to realize it through his own efforts!

He did not like that feeling of fate being grasped in the hands of others!

Of course, Ye Yuan’s ambitions were very big. But when he really started visualizing, Ye Yuan discovered that this was really very hard. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Great Dao was boundless!

When Ye Yuan started visualizing, he felt like he was seemingly situated in an endless wilderness plain, unable to find the direction at all.

In front of Heavenly Dao, he, this Deity Realm powerhouse, did not even count as an ant.

Time passed day by day. Ye Yuan attempted many methods but was unable to find the entry point.

Ye Yuan knew that wanting to find his own path, he must first find a correspondence point with Heavenly Dao.

Just like reeling silk from cocoons, without this correspondence point, Ye Yuan would forever not enter the door.

It was just that talk was cheap, but doing it was as hard as ascending to heaven!

Leaves fell without knowing autumn. In a blink, Ye Yuan spent ten year’s time inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space.

In ten years, Ye Yuan attempted countless ways but was still unable to find this correspondence point.

This result involuntarily made him somewhat discouraged.

“Heh, know how foolish you are, right? This path of yours can’t work! Moreover, you can afford to wait, but can that little lass afford to wait?”

By Ye Yuan’s ear, came Dustless’s mocking.
