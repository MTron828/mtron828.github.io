Chapter 2682: Speechless

“Punk, it’s your turn! Don’t blame me for not telling you. But in the seven great sea regions and among peers, there’s only Younger Sister Jingfei who beats me slightly! I think that you don’t need to test anymore either. Just directly kneel down and admit your mistake!”

Youqing’s eyes were full of contempt.

He was very confident in his own bloodline power. He would surely become a true dragon existence in the future.

Even if he was not as good as Jingfei, so what?

“Boy, stop hanging on! Unless you fused true dragon’s blood, otherwise, it’s impossible to beat me, Youqing! And the blood of true dragon doesn’t exist in the seven great sea regions at all!” Muchen said with a look of excitement.

Youqing is also considered to have taken revenge for him in a disguised form like this.

“You’ve already lost. So why haven’t you quickly knelt down!”

“Kneel down!”

“Kneel down!”

… …

In their eyes, Ye Yuan already lost and needed to kneel down and admit his mistake.

It was also not their fault for thinking this way, but no one among the young generation could achieve this step at all.

True dragons, those were all extremely mysterious and powerful existences, rarely seen in this world.

Therefore, the so-called dragon race in the seven great sea regions, they were all pseudo-dragons.

Even if a human fused with pseudo-dragon blood, their bloodline power would not be much stronger either.

“Hey, you all are also too overbearing! Big Brother Ye Yuan hasn’t been tested yet, and you all already determined that he lost? Big Brother Ye Yuan, hurry up and test!” Little Dragon Girl said in defense against the injustice.

Ye Yuan arrived in front of the Dragon Qi Stone and slowly reached his hand out to press on top.

Different from Youqing, Ye Yuan did not burst forth a powerful dragon qi from his body.

Everything was the same as usual.

“Haha,?boy, the Dragon Qi Stone isn’t used like this! The way you are, the Dragon Qi Stone won’t react at all.”

“Boy, you wouldn’t not have bloodline power in your body at all, right?”

“I even thought how formidable this kid was, after messing around for half a day. He’s good at bragging! Stop disgracing yourself! Quickly kneel down and admit your fault!”

… …

Ye Yuan had not even triggered the Dragon Qi Stone, and it immediately attracted a wave of group ridiculing.

To activate the Dragon Qi Stone, one must urge one’s own dragon qi to the extreme.

Just like Youqing who mustered up all of his strength.

But Ye Yuan actually did not use his energy at all. How could it possibly make the Dragon Qi Stone have any reaction?

But, in pace with Ye Yuan placing his hand on the Dragon Qi Stone, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

First section!

Second section!

… …

All the way until the ninth section, they all lit up!

The entire Dragon Qi Stone erupted with a dazzling light.

Compared to Youqing’s dim light earlier, Ye Yuan’s light was purer and more dazzling!

Everyone was stunned. Even Little Dragon Girl’s mouth opened into a circle.

A hint of surprise flashed across Black Flood Dragon King’s eyes. It was also not known what he was thinking about.

Youqing’s eyes became wide-saucers and disbelief was written all over his face.

“How is this possible? Hang on! The Dragon Qi Stone must be broken!” Youqing muttered under his breath.

“He didn’t even stimulate his bloodline power, so how did the Dragon Qi Stone directly reach the ninth segment? Something must be wrong with the Dragon Qi Stone! Dragon Lord, there’s a problem with this Dragon Qi Stone!” Muchen said.

Black Flood Dragon King looked at him like looking at a fool and said coolly, “If there’s something wrong with the Dragon Qi Stone, what about Youqing’s test earlier? You say that there’s a problem, so maybe you can go up and try too!”

Muchen was taken aback and immediately lost his temper.

But he was still unable to accept it.

What right did a human have, to make the Dragon Qi Stone directly reach the ninth segment?

What was even more damnable was that he actually did not stimulate his bloodline power!

Could it be that the Dragon Qi Stone directly detected it?

Inconceivable!

Ye Yuan looked at the Dragon Qi Stone, a hint of a slight smile showing at the corners of his mouth as he said, “Looks like my dragon race bloodline is still considered pretty good among Heavenly Stratum powerhouses!”

Ye Yuan had the confidence in surpassing Youqing.

But he did not expect that his bloodline power was actually so strong, directly reaching the ninth segment!

Furthermore, looking at this light, it seemed to have not given full expression to its views.

Most likely, this Dragon Qi Stone could not truly gauge his true dragon bloodline.

This was normal too. After all, it was just used for testing by a bunch of pseudo-dragons and not genuine true dragons.

Presumably, even if it was true dragons, there would definitely be distinctions in strength when it came to bloodline power too.

Of course, no matter how weak a true dragon’s bloodline power was, it was also far stronger than these pseudo-dragons.

Ye Yuan thought that for his true dragon bloodline to be so strong, it should be related to becoming Dragon Ancestor back then.

Dragons were born from heaven and earth and were where the essence of heaven and earth lay.

Ye Yuan could obtain the recognition of Heavenly Dao in the Heavenspan World, this small chiliocosm, becoming the Dragon Progenitor. This was likely a form of recognition of the 33 Heavens’ Heavenly Dao in itself.

Ye Yuan looked at Youqing and said with a smile, “Sorry about it. Right now, apart from Jingfei, it seems like there’s one more person whose bloodline is stronger than yours. Now, shouldn’t it be time for you to kneel down?”

Youqing’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “There’s a problem with this Dragon Qi Stone! The strongest that has appeared in the seven great sea regions was also merely just the eighth segment dragon qi. How can you, a human, possibly reach the ninth segment? The peak ninth segment, that already infinitely approaches true dragon level! Don’t tell me that what’s flowing in your body is true dragon bloodline!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “If you say that there’s a problem, you try it again.”

As he said, he took his palm away. Only then did the light on the Dragon Qi Stone gradually dissipate.

Youqing gave a cold snort and arrived in front of the Dragon Qi Stone again.

The dragon qi on his body surged once again, pressing a palm on the Dragon Qi Stone. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This time, he still exerted all of his strength.

But the result was the same!

Peak fourth segment.

Youqing’s expression changed, but he still refused to believe this fact.

“Muchen, you come and try! There’s absolutely a problem with this Dragon Qi Stone!” Youqing said in disbelief still.

Muchen nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll try it out! How can he, a human, possibly reach the peak ninth segment?”

Muchen arrived in front of the Dragon Qi Stone and imitated Youqing, and then he also started testing.

In the end, his dragon qi stopped at peak third segment.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s okay; I’m not in a hurry. If you don’t believe it, you can still have the rest come and try.”

Youqing’s expression was grim as water and pointed at another one to come up.

But, no matter who it was, nobody surpassed the fourth segment again.

“Me too! Me too!” When Little Dragon Girl saw everyone testing, she could not resist it too and came forward on her own accord.

She skipped in front of the Dragon Qi Stone and pressed her palm on it. The stone pillar was lit up once again.

Peak fifth segment!

Jingfei’s dragon qi was actually a full segment stronger than Youqing!

This naturally aroused another wave of exclamations.

Little Dragon Girl looked at Youqing and said with a smile, “Big Brother Youqing, this Dragon Qi Stone is fine! I just tested my dragon qi a few years ago. It was the late-stage fifth segment. Now, it has improved a little bit.?Hehe,?you must be willing to lose if you bet! Moreover, as a member of the dragon race, kneeling to a true dragon isn’t considered an insult to you!”

Youqing’s expression alternated between green and white.

He looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “I still don’t believe it! Test again! I don’t believe that you can still reach the peak ninth segment!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Okay, then I’ll let you give up on this.”

Finished saying, he pressed his hand on the Dragon Qi Stone again.

The Dragon Qi Stone was instantly fully lit!

Peak ninth segment!

“With this, you have nothing to say, right?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Everyone had tested once. Now, Ye Yuan tested a second time.

This showed that the bloodline power in Ye Yuan’s body had truly reached the peak ninth segment!

This was too terrifying!
