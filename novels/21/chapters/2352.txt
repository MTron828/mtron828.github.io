Chapter 2358: Five Qi Dayorigin VS True Nirvana Sword Formation!

Inside the cage, lightning ran rampant!

Places that it passed through, wailing sounded out!

Pang Zhen was well-deserving of being Ancestor Lightning’s successor. To be able to cultivate lightning source to such a level, it was truly seldomly seen.

Laws had distinctions in superiority, but at the same time it also depended on how a person utilized it.

People who cultivated supreme laws might not be stronger than those who cultivated ordinary laws.

But Pang Zhen had clearly gained the essence of Ancestor Lightning’s true legacy, applying lightning source to a transcendent realm.

However, they were all top ten powerhouses at any rate.

Especially the various cities’ top three, those were all existences with extremely fearsome strength.

Pang Zhen being so overbearing also aroused the dislike of some powerhouses.

The temptation of this legacy was too great. Who did not want to get the supreme inheritance?

Even if they did not get the supreme inheritance, obtaining the ten major legacies was also pretty good.

Hence, some powerhouses discovered that something was wrong and established an offensive and defensive alliance very quickly.

In short, inside the enormous cage fell into an extremely chaotic situation.

But as the numbers decreased more and more, the battle situation also grew more intense.

Because those who remained were all experts among experts.

Even Pang Zhen also felt overwhelmed facing several great powerhouses at the same time.

“Hahaha, awesome! Younger Brother Ye, you should also bring out your true ability already!” Wan Zhen said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “Brother Wan is indeed formidable! Since that’s the case, this Ye won’t conceal my abilities anymore!”

Over here, the two people fought earth-shatteringly.

But up to this point, they both did not bring out their true strength and were both testing each other.

Even so, their combat power already surpassed the vast majority of the people present.

In Cloudaid City, Jiang Zhe was dumbstruck with amazement long ago!

Only seeing Wan Zhen and Ye Yuan’s fight did he know how terrifying Ye Yuan’s strength was.

The current Ye Yuan was more than ten times stronger than the Ye Yuan back then!

Let alone that Ye Yuan had not used the law of time and space yet.

Only then did he understand how laughable these few years of questioning were. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the crowd, Qin Hu’s expression was also very ugly as he said, “Really blinded my dog eyes! How was it blinded by obsession back then, to go and provoke this freak?”

Mo Xi gave him a glance and said crossly, “If you know that you’re blind, change your temper in the future, and stop making trouble everywhere! This is inside the Primeval War Realm. If it was outside, you’d had long died ten times over!’

Qin Hu deeply felt that way too and nodded repeatedly and said, “You’re right. I mustn’t simply posture anymore in the future, and keep a low-profile. Damn, you really can’t judge a book by its cover, and the sea cannot be measured with a bushel. Some people really can’t be provoked!”

Only then did he know what kind of freak Ye Yuan was.

A thousand years was neither long nor short.

Ye Yuan’s improvement in these 1000 years could simply be described with the word terrifying.

Forget that his realm increased quickly, his power of laws even advanced at a tremendous pace.

And he had not showcased his real skills yet!

“His move! Wan Zhen is going to use his ultimate move, Five Qi Dayorigin! I really don’t know what kind of realm his move already reached!”

“My god, the power of this move is more than ten times stronger than just now!”

“This pressure, it’s simply going to burst through the cage! Five Elemental Laws fusing perfectly is really too terrifying!”

... ...

Amidst everyone’s exclamations, Wan Zhen’s imposing aura suddenly rose several levels.

Above his head, a five-colored flower petal quietly condensed into shape.

Wan Zhen controlled the treasure pagoda, the five-petaled flower rotated without resting.

This scene looked very gorgeous.

But every powerhouse in the cage felt a dangerous aura.

Many powerhouses, even those powerhouses ranked in the top three, all gave a wide berth, consciously distancing themselves from the two.

Even Pang Zhen’s eyes also flickered slightly, clearly very shocked.

Over the past thousand years, Wan Zhen’s strength did not just improve by a little bit!

His major five elemental fusion became even more powerful!

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, his pupils also shrunk.

This Wan Zhen was really too strong.

This move had not been unleashed yet, but there were no flaws at all.

This battle was a tough fight, there was no chance to gain any advantage by trickery.

His thoughts stirred and the sword formation suddenly changed.

It was just that this change did not have any major changes in the eyes of others.

“Did the formation change? Doesn’t look very impressive!”

“This bit of change, can it survive under the attack of the Five Qi Dayorigin?”

“Is this Ye Yuan’s final trump card? Doesn’t look like much! Even if he used time law, it’s also impossible to be very strong, right?”

... ...

The power of the sword formation was not so intuitive.

But once one got caught in the sword formation, that would be terrifying.

Bystanders could not understand Ye Yuan’s action at all. They just instinctively felt that he could defend against Wan Zhen’s move.

True Nirvana Sword Formation!

This was Ye Yuan’s newest comprehended sword formation. It was also by relying on precisely this set of sword formation, that Ye Yuan could kill into the Celestial Beast Plain, and obtained more than 500 thousand god of war points at the final moment, making a heaven-defying comeback!

One could imagine how strong this sword formation was.

Over the past thousand years, especially the recent ten years, Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao source and Formation Dao source improved significantly again.

During a battle, Ye Yuan fused these two great powers of source and the law of time and space fully, creating this set of True Nirvana Sword Formation!

The power was extremely terrifying!

Wan Zhen similarly did not understand, but he instinctively felt that Ye Yuan’s change seemed to be even more profound.

How profound, he could not explain it.

But he understood that it was absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to rely on an ordinary move to deal with his Five Qi Dayorigin.

He would know how strong after he gave it a try!

At once, he no longer hesitated as well, urging the treasure pagoda.

Five flower petals rolled like a wheel and flew over toward Ye Yuan.

In an instant, everyone felt like heaven and earth were pressing down.

The five elements developed myriad things in the world. Wan Zhen perfectly used the Five Elemental Laws, didn’t it represent the entire world?

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, True Nirvana Sword Formation suddenly operating, forming a world of its own.

Rumble!

As soon as they collided, it was as if the world started shaking.

The entire cage started trembling violently.

Many unpredictable children were currently in the midst of fierce fighting. Even though they already avoided far away, they were still affected by this tremor.

They did not have time to resist in the slightest and were directly drowned by the horrifying energy, dying until they could not be deader.

Wan Zhen’s pupils constricted, he did not expect that this unremarkable sword formation was actually so strong!

Evenly-matched!

At once, he did not dare to be neglectful, divine essence surging crazily once more.

That five elements spinning wheel actually started disintegrating after this collision!

“Deriving Myriad Dao!”

Wan Zhen roared explosively, that five enormous flower petals immediately decomposed into thousands of miniature petals.

Ye Yuan’s pupils shrunk, the power of this move was several times stronger than earlier!

These decomposed petals seemed disorderly and unsystematic, but actually, every five petals formed a miniature closed loop.

And between each closed loop, there was a magical kind of power attracting.

This was deriving myriad Dao!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned slightly dark, his figure moving. He actually directly took a step out and entered among those countless flower petals!
