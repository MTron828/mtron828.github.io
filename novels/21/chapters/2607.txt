Chapter 2613: Overwhelmed with Terror!

Smack, smack, smack!

Ye Yuan lifted his legs and stepped a few times on Han Qianyun’s face viciously before giving vent to his anger.

Han Qianyun’s face was full of shoe prints.

This strengthened version of Windward Topple, he conveniently kept a little when Windward Topple refined it back then.

He did not expect that it was actually put to use now.

Smack, smack, smack!

What took Ye Yuan aback was that Wen Jingxuan suddenly rushed over and also stomped a few times on Han Qianyun’s face.

These few years of repression made her finally explode the moment she saw Ye Yuan.

“Huff?… Stomping him a few times, it feels much better!” Wen Jingxuan said with an unrefined look.

But, seeing Wen Jingxuan’s appearance akin to being relieved of a heavy burden, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed together.

Instinct told him that most likely, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect had some changes.

“Jingxuan, what happened to the sect?” Ye Yuan asked with a frown.

Wen Jingxuan looked at Ye Yuan, finally feeling that she had found a backer.

For a moment, grievances that filled her welled up in her heart, and tears burst out uncontrollably.

Complaining tearfully, Wen Jingxuan recounted the changes these few years for Ye Yuan to hear. making Ye Yuan somewhat reproach himself too.

He did not expect that the Pill Alliance’s influence was actually so great, to actually be able to directly boycott a great heavenly sect!

In reality, even Feng Xuanyi did not expect it either.

The Pill Alliance, this faction, was very low-profile. It normally concealed its abilities.

But once it erupted, its power was astonishing.

Qin Shun’s matter was merely a fuse that let the low-profile Pill Alliance reveal a power that was as strong as Mount Tai.

Indeed, the Pill Alliance’s attack this time shocked the entire Rainclear Continent!

Only then did the people realize that the Pill Alliance’s tentacles had already reached into the corners of the Five Great Heavenly Regions!

Even a colossal sect like the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect actually had no choice but to lower their head and admit their fault too.

Fury rose in Ye Yuan’s heart.

With the Pill Alliance attacking, this had no cause for much criticism.

But making Luo Yunqing lower his head and making Wen Jingxuan become a furnace were too much!

Disregarding Wen Jingxuan, if she was sent to Qin Shun there, there would presumably be no good end.

Even if it was Luo Yunqing, once his head was lowered, the effect on him would be too great!

He, Luo Yunqing, one person and one sword, how unrestrained and uninhibited was he? How arrogant at heart and haughty in manner was he?

Ye Yuan was perfectly clear that after going, the effect on Luo Yunqing’s cultivation in the future would be too great.

In fact, making no more progress was also not impossible.

A gentleman’s sword would not bow its head!

Whoever stopped me, I’ll kill with one sword move!

Lowering one’s head meant the sword breaking.

The sword was already broken; so still cultivate what sword then?

If Luo Yunqing was just by himself, he would definitely kill his way up to the Pill Alliance.

But for the sake of the sect, he had no choice but to lower his head!

A hint of coldness exuded from Ye Yuan’s eyes and he said in a solemn voice, “Come!”

Wen Jingxuan was taken aback and said, “Go where?”

“To save your senior apprentice brother!”

… …

Li Zhuo had been riding on the crest of success recently.

Not only did he break through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum and become an outer-sect disciple, he even found an even stronger backer.

Han Qianyun felt that Li Zhuo was sensible and took him in as a disciple.

To outer-sect disciples, being able to acknowledge a protector as one’s master was also a remarkably great thing.

Additionally, abusing Ye Yuan’s disciple, Lin Lan, also became one of the joys of his life.

Bang!

Li Zhuo kicked Lin Lan flying with a kick and said with a sneer, “Old thing, crawl through under my crotch and I’ll spare you today! Otherwise, you’ll have to lie on the bed for a few months again!”

Lin Lan was relegated to a servant and had his cultivation sealed. He could only unleash the strength of a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum and was not Li Zhuo’s match at all.

These few years, Li Zhuo tormented Lin Lan a lot too.

If not for Luo Yunqing specifically giving warnings, Lin Lan would have long died already.

Although Luo Yunqing had lost power, his strength was placed there. It was not what the likes of Li Zhuo, this kind of outer-sect disciple, could provoke.

Lin Lan spat and said disdainfully, “A lapdop wanting to make this old man crawl under your crotch, dream on! If you have the capability, kill me!”

Li Zhuo was currently a salted fish that gained a new lease on life. He was most upset by others calling him a lapdog.

Hearing what Lin Lan said, he was immediately furious and directly broke Lin Lan’s legs with a kick. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Kill you? You don’t want to live anymore and want to drag me together to die??Heh heh,?what a shame it would be to kill you, your Lord Zhuo will lose out on a lot of fun in the future!” Li Zhuo said with a sneer.

Indeed, Lin Lan did not want to live anymore.

Each time Li Zhuo came, he struck extremely heavily.

Lin Lan still had to do manual labor with serious injuries in tow. His body had long already been worn down.

Rather than living like this, he might as well die.

Lin Lan did not believe that Ye Yuan would die in the Land of Exile.

After all, he had seen Ye Yuan create too many miracles.

But he felt that he could not wait for Ye Yuan to come back anymore.

This kind of situation, each day was worse than death!

Tomorrow, Wen Jingxuan was going to be sent to the Pill Alliance. Luo Yunqing also had to go and apologize.

He planned on ending his life tomorrow.

If he could drag this dog down before dying, it was also pretty good.

But sadly, Li Zhuo did not fall for it!

Lin Lan spat out a mouthful of blood and said with gritted teeth, “Li Zhuo, don’t you get cocky! After Master returns from the Land of Exile, it will be your death date!”

But when Li Zhuo heard that, he laughed loudly without ceasing and said, “That dead ghost had probably long already been dismembered in the Land of Exile, right? You’re making that dead ghost come and deal with me??Haha,?what a joke!”

Li Zhuo seemed to have heard the funniest joke, raising his head and laughing loudly without ceasing.

But all of a sudden, he felt the surroundings suddenly quieten down, and e could not help feeling a little curious.

When his gaze landed, his entire body could not help shuddering.

The ‘dead ghost’ that he talked about was currently looking at him.

This scene seemed to be a supernatural event, making his hair stand on end.

Thud!

Li Zhuo plopped down onto the ground, scared out of his wits.

“Y-Y-You, why are you here? A-Aren’t you already dead?” Li Zhuo was scared silly as he stammered.

Ye Yuan’s gaze when looking at him was like looking at a dead person.

It was not just him. Everyone around him looked at him like looking at a dead person.

Back then, before Ye Yuan entered the sect, he killed Lu Zhanyuan in public. He would naturally dare to kill Li Zhuo.

And this scene was also announcing to everyone that he, Ye Yuan, had returned domineeringly!

Ye Yuan did not speak, he just looked at Li Zhuo quietly like that, and paced forward slowly.

Li Zhuo was already overwhelmed with terror and kept saying, “Y-You! Don’t come over!”

Ye Yuan ignored him and continued advancing.

Li Zhuo was horrified and said, “I … I’m Protector Han Qianyun’s disciple now! Y-You can’t kill me!”

Ye Yuan ignored and still closed in.

Each step that he took forward, Li Zhuo would shift a step on the ground using his buttocks.

He could not stand up at all!

The people all felt that Ye Yuan was already Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum presently!

Recalling back then, Lu Zhanyuan was not even Ye Yuan’s match in the same cultivation realm, let alone Li Zhuo this kind of trash?

Therefore, he had no chance of winning!

One step, another step.

Along with Ye Yuan’s closing in, everyone’s breathing became hastened.

“Urgh?…?Argh!”

Suddenly, Li Zhuo raised his head to the sky and roared, his eyeballs protruding, fresh blood and unknown fluids flowing out of his mouth.

Bang!

Li Zhuo fell to the ground with a loud bang and actually already breathed his last!

When everyone saw this scene, they were dumbfounded!

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse was actually scared to death by Ye Yuan?
