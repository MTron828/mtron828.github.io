Chapter 1262: Breakthrough, Tier 9 Grand Completion!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Big Brother, it’s so strange! Isn’t it said that the god-forbidden region is the forbidden area of Deity Realm powerhouses? Why didn’t we encounter any more dangers after we came out of the Death Marsh?”

From narrowly escaping death inside the Death Marsh, more than half a month’s time already passed.

White Light discovered to his surprise that it was actually unusually peaceful along the way!

That intense sense of danger when they originally stepped foot into the god-forbidden region actually vanished without a trace.

This fierce contrast simply made the four people somewhat at a loss on what to do.

Even if it was Ye Yuan, entering the God-forbidden region this time, he also carried the resolve of not coming out alive.

But now, it was too easy!

The four of them almost became doing sightseeing along the way now.

Was this god-forbidden region still the Divine Realm’s legendary deathtrap?

“Most likely, the reason still lies with the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s abnormal activity at that time! Could it be that all of the living things in this god-forbidden region are all afraid of the Soul Suppressing Pearl? This isn’t too likely, right?” Ye Yuan said speechlessly.

But White Light said with an excited look, “Big Brother, this Soul Suppressing Pearl was what I helped you find back then! Haha, didn’t expect that today, it actually had such a great effect, to be able to let us travel inside this god-forbidden region akin to walking on flat ground.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Haha, your contributions are the greatest! But I keep feeling that it’s not that simple! I remember that the Deathsoul Tree mention before Immortal Grove Region on that day, while Kanuo had also once mentioned the Immortal Grove Region before! Can it be that our Divine Realm’s original name was called Immortal Grove Region? Also, Skydistant had also once said before that the Vast Heaven Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl were both foreign treasures. Even Senior Absolute Heaven doesn’t know their origins! Seems like ... apart from this Divine Realm, there’s really another space!”

Li-er’s heart suddenly stirred and said to Ye Yuan, “Big Brother Yuan, do you think those Deity Realm powerhouses have gone to the other space?”

Ye Yuan gave her a strange glance and said with a nod, “Hearing you say so, it’s really a possibility! Perhaps they detected in advance Heavenly Dao’s absence, and nobody was willing to remain in the Divine Realm, and all the Deity Realm powerhouses joined forces and opened up the entrance leading to the other world!”

The more Ye Yuan said, the more likely it felt!

This way, all of the things could be explained!

Heavenly Dao being absent, even if they were Origin Deity Realm, they would also have to be suppressed back to Dao Profound Realm, which Deity Realm powerhouse was willing?

Even if their laws comprehension was any greater, they were merely just a slightly stronger Half-Deity powerhouse.

These people originally stood high above the masses. Making them mingle together with mortals again, it was completely impossible for them to be willing.

Furthermore, the otherworldly place might be a higher-level space. They might have the chance to attain an even higher realm.

Ye Yuan felt like he seemed to have touched upon the truth of the 100 thousand year mystery that was covered by dust!

“Immortal Grove Region! Immortal Grove Region! Why is it called Immortal Grove Region? Also, why would Heavenly Dao be missing a part? Heh heh, those Deity Realm powerhouses all prided themselves on being exceptional but left behind such an awful mess. Truly a bunch of god-like existences!”

Ye Yuan’s words were filled with ridicule, being very contemptuous towards those so-called Deity Realm powerhouses.

He did not believe that those Deity Realm powerhouses did not know the peril of the fiend race!

But those people left without turning back and did not even give a warning!

Those so-called Deity Realm powerhouses, Ye Yuan held them in great contempt.

“If it was really like this, they are simply a group of trash! What a waste of their phenomenal strength, becoming deserters and leaving behind the Divine Realm’s trillions of living things to suffer the fiend race’s abyss misery!” White Light also said indignantly.

Li-er sighed and said, “In this world, how many powerhouses are there that take on responsibility like Senior Absolute Heaven, Senior Fang Tian, and Big Brother Yuan? Those Deity Realm powerhouses looked at other people leaving, how could they be willing to stay themselves, to be cannon fodders? Perhaps in their eyes, their lives are much more important than these trillions of life!”

Listening finish, Ye Yuan trio deeply felt that way too.

Probably in those Deity Realm powerhouses’ eyes, they indeed thought that way.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s face fell. A powerful divine sense locked onto him brazenly.

“Jeje, I didn’t expect to actually run into you guys here! Truly enemies meet on a narrow path!”

A figure blocked the few people at the front. It was none other than precisely Zhuge Qingxuan!

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “You’re really a ghost that lingers on persistently!”

“Brat, you ruined my million years of painstaking effort, could it be that you think this deity will let you go?” Li Gui said.

Ye Yuan’s expression darkened, and he said, “Where’s Zhuge Qingxuan? Dead?”

“Humph! Not watching you die with my own eyes, how can this seat die?” This time, it switched to Zhuge Qingxuan’s voice.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over him nonchalantly and said with disdain, “Looks like you’re not planning on making a move yourself anymore. Huhu, looks like your confidence is worn away by this young master. The Divine Realm’s number one is merely like so!”

Ye Yuan had long figured out Zhuge Qingxuan’s temper. Even if the other party knew that this was a goading technique, he would fall for it too.

But this time, Ye Yuan miscalculated!

It was only to hear Zhuge Qingxuan give a cold snort and said, “Humph! You want to goad me into fighting with me, I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint you! Because as long as I can watch you die, this seat is willing to be mocked by you!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Jeje, boy, I have to admit that you’re very impressive! Someone as prideful as Zhuge Qingxuan actually forcefully had his pride effaced by you! Your talent is even greater than Absolute Heaven! It’s too bad that ... you were born in the wrong time!” Li Gui had an appearance of taking delight in others’ misfortune.

Clearly, these two people had long reached some kind of tacit understanding already.

With regard to dealing with Ye Yuan, their objective was to kill Ye Yuan.

For this, Zhuge Qingxuan even gave up on personally taking action!

Because he knew that no matter how hard he tried, he could not kill Ye Yuan too!

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Like that, I I got it! Looks like today, we can’t end things without a bloody battle!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan put the others away inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda.

When Li Gui saw this scene, he said with a faint smile, “Bloody battle? Boy, you’re thinking too much! With this deity’s strength, you can only contend with me by using the Voice of the Dragon God. It’s a shame that displaying the Voice of the Dragon God with Tier 9 strength, you can at most only last three breaths of time, right? As long as this deity tides over these three breaths, you’re dead!”

Ye Yuan used two breaths of time the last time, and Li Gui calculated his limits.

Although the Voice of the Dragon God was strong, his Divine Dao laws were too powerful!

The Voice of the Dragon God that had always prevailed could not achieve a certain-kill effect with him.

Since it could not achieve a certain-kill effect, using this move was equivalent to seeking death.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, but did not take it seriously at all and said indifferently, “Is that so? If my conjectures are right, your current strength is also less than 10%! Since I can’t deal with you in my current state, then I’ll ... break through then!”

Done talking, all the essence energy in Ye Yuan’s surged!

A surge of terrifying essence energy undulation roused the entire god-forbidden region until a storm raged and clouds gathered!

Li Gui’s expression changed, and he said in terror, “This ... Tier 9 grand completion, Half-Deity Realm!”
