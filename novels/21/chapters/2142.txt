Chapter 2146: Visitor From the Abyss

Looking at the bunch of greedy gazes giving off light in the darkness, Long Xiaochun’s heart sunk to rock-bottom.

The abyss monsters being summoned were extremely powerful. She even detected that there was a Third Firmament Empyrean Realm’s aura.

Abyss monsters at this strength were not what she could deal with at all.

“Don’t care anymore!”

Long Xiaochun gritted her teeth and was actually really squeezing out tears over there.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s voice sounded in her ears: “Xiaochun, make use of the jade slip that I gave you and bring them all out! You don’t need to care about my side. Let them come over!”

“But ...” Long Xiaochun was anxious.

“No buts! Let them come over!” Ye Yuan directly interrupted.

Long Xiaochun gritted her teeth, stomped her feet, and said, “You all, follow me!”

Finished saying, she brought everyone and directly crushed the jade slip.

The spatial node technique activated, Long Xiaochun and the rest were directly teleported out.

“Lord Xiaochun, this ... We’re all gone, but what about Lord Ye?” Long Xun said worriedly.

Long Xiaochun looked into the distance, her gaze glimmering as she said, “I hope that he has a way!”

Over here, a group of Empyrean level abyss monsters was casting covetous eyes, getting closer and closer to Ye Yuan.

“Spatial node technique! Truly excellent means!”

“Heh, the commotion of this human’s breakthrough is truly extraordinary! It’s even much stronger than us noble abyss monsters!”

“Seems like he must be very delicious!”

... ...

The current Ye Yuan, in the view of the abyss monsters, Ye Yuan was the most tasty delicacy.

As for Long Xiaochun they all escaping, it did not matter.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Finally, someone could not hold back and made a move against Ye Yuan.

“The prey is mine! Nobody snatch!”

“To dare snatch prey from me, are you all tired of living?”

... ...

Once someone made a move, the other abyss monsters all could not hold back, dashing over one after another. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Such a delicious prey, how could they possibly give it to others?

“Heh, truly, someone delivers a pillow when taking a nap! A bunch of fools, I was just worrying that the tarnished black devil crystals were insufficient! Since that’s the case, then I won’t be courteous!”

In the group of abyss monsters’ ears, came Ye Yuan’s mocking laughter. They could not help being greatly alarmed in their hearts.

Right then, a horrifying energy undulation erupted from Ye Yuan’s body.

“Dao births one, one births two, two births three, three births myriad life! I finally understand!” Amidst the explosion sound, came Ye Yuan’s hearty laughter.

Feeling this energy that could decimate heaven and earth, the group of Empyrean level abyss monsters felt their hairs stand on end. An incredible feeling of danger welled up in their hearts.

“Not good! Quickly run!”

“Damn it! Does this guy not want his life anymore?”

... ...

Alarmed and angry voices lingered incessantly. These Empyrean level abyss monsters turned tail and ran.

But it was already too late!

A noiseless explosion extended in all directions, destroying everything!

Including Ye Yuan himself!

The current Ye Yuan directly blew up into ashes!

However, his body was condensed again very quickly, then obliterated, rinse and repeat like this.

Nirvanic Tribulation!

Amidst this horrifying explosion, Ye Yuan was transcending the nirvanic tribulation.

Not just this, Ye Yuan’s divine soul was similarly being blown into pieces.

In the center of this horrifying energy, there were only two things that were not destroyed.

One was the World Suppressing Stele.

The other was Ye Yuan’s consciousness!

Time could be destroyed, but only consciousness was imperishable!

“Tarnished black devil crystals, absorb for me!”

Those tarnished black devil crystals were directly gobbled up by Ye Yuan, fusing into the explosions, using to condense the fleshy body, using to re-mold the divine soul!

These Second Firmament and Third Firmament Empyrean Realm tarnished black devil crystals were incomparably pure, the energy was also extremely plentiful. To the current Ye Yuan, it was simply a great tonic.

The explosions were still continuing, the entire Dragon Eye Cave was trembling.

Those powerful abyss monsters were frightened until they ran like mad outside.

The void shattered, gale winds wreaked havoc.

The entire Dragon Eye Cave fell into utter chaos.

... ...

In the extreme depths, several archaic auras suddenly emerged, emitting voices there were simultaneously alarmed and enraged.

A hoarse voice roared angrily, “Damn it! The third layer’s seal is actually broken!”

Another ancient voice said, “Sigh, we have guarded the abyss for countless years! Ididn’t expect that it actually had the seals broken by someone from outside!”

Another person said, “Could it be that ... our eight great Abyss Suppressing Pseudo Worlds were breached? Someone attempted to breach the abyss from the outside world?”

At this time, a voice that seemed to have crawled out of a grave opened its mouth and said, “Stop guessing randomly! Bai Chen, you go and take a look.”

“Yes.”

Amidst the darkness, someone answered, turning into a streak of white shadow, disappearing.

When Bai Chen’s figure landed at the Dragon Eye Cave, his pupils could not help constricting.

“This ... It’s actually like this! Interesting, really interesting! Looks like the Heavenspan World that has been peaceful for so long is finally having great waves stir again!” Bai Chen’s voice was full of complicatedness.

“Fortunately, the seal’s damage isn’t big. Otherwise, if those second layer’s monsters rush out, it would be too much to bear.”

As he said, Bai Chen kneaded incomparably profound seals in his hands and sent them into the void.

The entire Dragon Eye Cave finally calmed down once again.

The explosions were still going on, but the fiercest explosion was naturally that instant at the beginning.

Now, the destructive power was already far from before.

“Many thanks for Senior taking action. Otherwise, this junior would have gotten into trouble.”

In Bai Chen’s mind, a voice suddenly appeared, making his state of mind that found it hard to fluctuate for hundreds of millions of years have a trace of ripple.

His brows furrowed, and he said, “A puny little Empyrean, you can actually discover this emperor’s existence?”

Bai Chen’s appearance was just like a speck of dust, being unable to cause any waves to this layer’s space at all.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan could actually notice him.

This shock was naturally by no means insignificant.

Although the commotion that Ye Yuan caused was horrifying, what kind of eyesight did Bai Chen have? He saw through that Ye Yuan was merely breaking through rank seven with one glance. He was not even considered as an expert in Bai Chen’s eyes.

This kind of strength, even if they scratched their heads bloody, they could forget about discovering his existence too.

But Ye Yuan actually discovered it.

“Junior’s current state is a little special, everything in this Dragon Eye Cave is clear at a glance. Hence, I can discover Senior,” Ye Yuan transmitted his voice.

Bai Chen’s gaze glimmered slightly, also no idea what he was thinking about.

“Looks like a remarkable little fellow emerged in the Heavenspan World! Eh, didn’t expect that you have some connections to the dragon race,” Bai Chen said in surprise.

His strength was exceedingly formidable, just through this wisp of divine sense voice transmission, he detected the existence of Ye Yuan’s dragon soul.

“Junior’s mother is from the dragon race,” Ye Yuan knew that it could not help from Bai Chen and said honestly.

His current state was extremely mysterious, he could feel that this Bai Chen was unfathomable, virtually akin to a god.

The strongest person that Ye Yuan had seen before was merely Ji Mo.

But he had a feeling that Ji Mo was probably not even dregs in front of this white-clothed old man.

Bai Chen nodded and said, “So that’s how it is. I hope that you remember your identity. With your talent, you’re bound to take on a huge responsibility in the future!”

Ye Yuan replied, “Senior garrisoning here, your merits are the greatest. Junior understands what I should do in my heart.”

Bai Chen nodded slightly and said, “You break through well then. This emperor is leaving.”

Finished talking, his figure directly dissipated into the world.
