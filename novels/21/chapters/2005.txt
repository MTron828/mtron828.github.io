Chapter 2009: Is an Empyrean Very Impressive?

Lu Yan was angered until his expression was livid. Since he stepped in Empyrean, no one had dared to speak to him this way.

But the moment Ye Yuan opened his mouth, it was calling him brain-damaged.

Disobeying an Empyrean was a serious crime!

His two eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “Insolence! This Empyrean’s words are the words of an emperor! Ask you to die, you have to die! To dare disobey this Empyrean, even if you want to die today, you can’t do it either!”

By the side, Deng Yunzai said in a cold voice, “Brother Lu Yan, talking nonsense with him for what? Directly take this brat down and grind his bones to dust and refine his soul alive. See if he still dares to be so arrogant!”

But when Ye Yuan heard that, his face revealed a mocking look. He said with a cold smile, “Grind my bones to dust? Refine my soul alive? Your esteemed self’s methods are so ruthless!”

Deng Yunzai snorted coldly and said, “Why? Know to be scared? It’s useless! In front of us Empyreans, you’re an ant! Moreover, it’s three Empyreans standing in front of you! Those methods of yours are not worth mentioning at all in front of us! However ... to be able to alarm the three of us to come forward personally, you can be sufficiently proud!”

In Deng Yunzai’s view, for a puny little Third Firmament True God to be able to startle the three of them mighty Empyreans to descend in person, this was something worthy of him to be proud of.

How noble was the status of an Empyrean?

They were normally utterly disdainful to take action against a puny little True God Realm.

But today, they made an exception and came.

When the martial artists in the city saw Ye Yuan facing the Empyrean powerhouses squarely, each and every one of their souls were about to fly out.

“Those are Empyrean powerhouses! Lord Ye Yuan gained their rancor right away?”

“Lord Ye Yuan would rather break than bend! If I were standing in front of an Empyrean, my legs would probably be soft.”

“I’m really breaking out into a sweat for Lord Ye Yuan! Although I feel that Lord Ye Yuan has other trump cards, I really can’t figure out what trump cards he still has, to be able to deal with Empyrean powerhouses.”

...

To say that they were not worried, that was impossible.

Although Ye Yuan created a miracle previously, exterminating several thousand True God Realm powerhouses by himself, these three people in front of him were Empyreans!

Several thousand True God Realms sounded intimidating, but in front of an Empyrean powerhouse, they were like paper paste.

Even if there was only one Deng Yunzai present, those several thousand true god realm powerhouses would not be able to stir up any waves at all. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This was the disparity between Empyrean Realm and True God Realm!

This kind of disparity could not be made up for using numbers at all.

But Ye Yuan created miracles time and again, making Heavenly Eagle’s martial artists have a kind of incomprehensible confidence in him.

This intense paradoxical sense made them worried about Ye Yuan’s safety. At the same time, they also look forward to what kind of heaven-shocking move he would come up with again.

The moment he heard Deng Yunzai’s words, Ye Yuan was amused.

“Is an Empyrean very impressive? My methods are far from what you guys can surmise.”

Lu Yan’s gaze turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Whether or not it’s impressive, you’ll know right away! Your so-called measures are utterly not worth mentioning in front of absolute strength.”

His patience was already completely whittled away by Ye Yuan.

He thought that with him personally descending would make Ye Yuan scared, would make Ye Yuan shudder with terror, even kneel on the ground and beg for mercy.

But none of that happened!

Not only that, each word that Ye Yuan had said choked him half to death.

On Lu Yan’s body, the might of an Empyrean suddenly released, directly grabbing at Ye Yuan with a palm.

Ye Yuan had a calm look, not having the intention of taking action at all.

Lu Yan laughed coldly and said, “The big talk was pretty good, but aren’t you still surrendering with folded arms?”

But right at this time, a layer of ripples suddenly emerged in the space between him and Ye Yuan.

An Empyrean pressure that did not belong to him suddenly erupted. A palm reached out from within the void, directly clashing together with him.

Bang!

Lu Yan’s figure retreated explosively, looking at that youth in white opposite, shock all over his face.

“Second Firmament ... Empyrean!” Lu Yan said in disbelief.

Deng Yunzai and Dai Chunhao’s pupils constricted, being surprised by this youth in white who suddenly appeared.

When did Heavenly Eagle Imperial City have such an additional super powerhouse?

Lu Yan’s brows were tightly knitted, his expression extremely grim as he looked at Bai Tong and said in a solemn voice, “This fellow daoist, this Empyrean is the master of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital. Today, I came to clean up my household, please don’t intervene in this matter!”

Bai Tong looked at Lu Yan and said with a look of amusement, “Ye Yuan is my good brother, but you’re asking me not to intervene? You ... aren’t brain-damaged, right?”

Lu Yan’s face instantly turned black as the bottom of a wok.

Why was this guy’s mouth so sarcastic too?

The words that came out were actually the exact same as Ye Yuan’s too!

But what was even more in his heart was shock.

A Second Firmament Empyrean actually addressed Ye Yuan, this Third Firmament True God, as his brother?

Lu Yan was currently in a state of disbelief when a series of exclamations suddenly came from inside the city.

“I-Isn’t that Lord Bai Tong?”

“Eh, it really is! Wasn’t Lord Bai Tong Fourth Firmament True God? Why did he break through to become a Second Firmament Empyrean all of a sudden? This ... This is also too fast, right?”

“Hahaha!

Lord Ye Yuan is Lord Ye Yuan! He indeed had a contingency plan!”

“Lord Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao is unparalleled. It must be that he triggered with medicinal pills, that Lord Bai Rong broke through to Empyrean Realm!”

...

Bai Tong had taken action several times, the martial artists in the city were all not foreign to him.

With this appearance, he leaped from Fourth Firmament True God to Second Firmament Empyrean all of a sudden, making everyone exclaim with admiration.

They did not know that Bai Tong was originally an Empyrean powerhouse. This kind of leaping-style breakthrough was simply incredible!

How shocking were the eyes and ears of Empyrean powerhouses?

The discussion of the martial artists in the city made Lu Yan three people’s eyes almost pop out.

A Fourth Firmament True God?

This one front of them was that Heavenly Eagle’s Fourth Firmament True God?

Just how long had it been, he directly broke through to Second Firmament Empyrean from Fourth Firmament True God?

There was a myriad of profanities running across in Lu Yan three people’s minds.

Don’t be so demoralizing!

Just what ... medicinal pill did you freaking refined?

Lu Yan gritted his teeth and said, “Brat, you think that pulling out a Second Firmament Empyrean and it’s fine? Don’t you forget, we have three Empyrean powerhouses!’

As he said, he said to Deng and Dai two people, “I’ll tie down this fellow, you guys go and deal with that punk! Take him down immediately. Don’t play with him anymore!”

Deng and Dai two people nodded their heads in response. Lu Yan leaped, clashing together with Bai Tong.

Bai Tong’s sleeves waved, a folded fan lightly pointed out. It was shockingly an empyrean spirit treasure!

It was only to see him step forward and actually ignore Ye Yuan who was behind him.

A powerful aura hit from head-on, Lu Yan’s face changed.

He did not have an empyrean spirit treasure!

How could he have empyrean spirit treasure? How could everyone have one?

With this exchange of blows, he was immediately suppressed by Bai Tong.

“Quickly attack, this guy isn’t easy to deal with!” Lu Yan roared loudly.

When the martial artists in the city saw the situation, they could not help getting a big shock.

“Not good, Lord Ye Yuan was too careless! The other party has three Empyreans!”

“Lord Ye Yuan, quickly run!”

...

The martial artists in the city all cried out in shock.

Deng and Dai two people exchanged a glance, looked at Ye Yuan, and said with a cold smile, “Punk, resign yourself to fate! This time, I see who else will come and save you!”

Done talking, the two people stepped forward, and directly grabbed at Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, there was another ripple in the void. Two figures stepped out of the void.
