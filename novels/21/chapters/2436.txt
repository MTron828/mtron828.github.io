Chapter 2442: Rule Cage, Space Freeze!

“What about you, Ancestor Lightning?” Lin Chaotian looked in Ancestor Lightning’s direction and said calmly.

The other seven great Dao Ancestors already made their stands known. Only Ancestor Lightning seemed to still be hesitating.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets seemed to have seen the last trace of hope and said loudly, “Pang Tian! Pang Zhen is right outside. Don’t you know how great his change is? Even he doesn’t believe that Saint Azure will betray the human race. Do you believe it?”

Ancestor Lightning was still silent. His gaze pierced through the hall, looking toward Pang Zhen outside of Origin Enlighten Mountain Range.

Everyone’s gazes were focused on Ancestor Lightning.

After a moment, he retracted his gaze and said calmly, “This ancestor concurs!”

Buzz!

Inside the hall immediately burst into an uproar!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was livid with rage, cursing Ancestor Lightning loudly for being devoid of gratitude.

It was just that he could not change the result.

His individual strength was too weak!

No one could have thought that the nine great Dao Ancestors who had always been discordant were actually unexpectedly unanimous with regards to Ye Yuan’s matter!

But didn’t this confirm Ye Yuan’s argument even more?

With the nine great Dao Ancestors having a united front, this was a power that carried heaven and earth along!

With this kind of power and influence, who dared to stop them?

Even if they coveted the secret on Ye Yuan, so what?

They were the truth!

They were power!

They were sublime!

With Ancestor Lightning making his stance clear, Lin Chaotian smiled slightly and looked toward Ye Yuan as he said, “Something that us nine great Dao Ancestors decided on, is something decided by heaven! Even if the divine race’s Tian Qing was here, he wouldn’t be able to refute it too! Do you submit?”

At this time, those people supporting Ye Yuan were already in despair.

Nine great Dao Ancestors joining hands, who could still overturn the heavens?

Just as Dao Ancestor Life said, even if Tian Qing was here, he would not be able to escape alive too!

Facing the powerful pressure of nine great Dao Ancestors, Ye Yuan appeared composed and collected.

He looked at Lin Chaotian and said with a light smile, “You nine great Dao Ancestors were single handedly created by me. Now, if I allow you all to knead me as you please, wouldn’t I become a joke?”

The moment these words came out, everyone was dumbfounded.

Lin Chaotian laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, times have changed. Those below Dao Ancestor are ants! Just based on your current strength, you also have wishful thinking of escaping from under our hands?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If I want to go, I’ll go. What can you do to me? Since I dared to come, I naturally have confidence in leaving! So what if nine great Dao Ancestors?”

His words made the hall explode all at once.

“He ... He wouldn’t have gone crazy, right? Space is already completely locked down! Even if he’s proficient in spatial law, it’s also impossible to escape from under the eyelids of Dao Ancestors!”

“Is there anyone in this world who can escape from under the cooperation of nine great Dao Ancestors? This is impossible!”

“Maybe he can in the future, but right now ... it’s absolutely impossible!”

... ...

No one believed Ye Yuan’s words, because that was something completely impossible.

What were Dao Ancestors?

To really talk about it, Dao Ancestors were the darlings of heaven!

They were the absolute powerhouses!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets could be said to be the number one emperor in ancient and modern times already. But in front of Dao Ancestors, he was still nothing.

Let alone that it was nine great Dao Ancestors joining hands!

Sure enough, Lin Chaotian smiled disdainfully and said, “Is that so? Then this ancestor wants to witness Lord Saint Azure’s methods!”

Finished saying, Lin Chaotian gently pressed a palm down.

A cyan-colored palm carried horrifying to the extreme wood-attribute power of rule and crushed towards Ye Yuan.

Space was already locked down, but the power of this palm was sufficient to crush Deva Fifth Blights to dust!

A casual palm, but it made everyone present change expressions abruptly.

Ye Yuan just stood with his hands behind his back, as if he did not see this palm.

Boom!

The ground surface of the hall directly had a deep pit smashed out. That place already did not have Ye Yuan’s figure.

Origin Enlighten Hall had extremely powerful array formations guarding. But this palm actually directly shattered the array formation.

However, Lin Chaotian’s expression changed wildly.

It was his first time having a visible change in countenance.

Lin Chaotian’s figure suddenly disappeared from where he was.

When he appeared again, he was already outside the hall.

Above the void, Ye Yuan was still standing with his hands behind his back, as if nothing had happened.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Eight great Dao Ancestors as well as those powerhouses all followed out.

Everyone’s gazes when looking at Ye Yuan were full of amazement. It was as if looking at a monster.

“Is this the power of a Dao Ancestor? Merely thus!” Ye Yuan looked at Lin Chaotian, full of disdain.

There was already nothing in this world that could make Lin Chaotian, this level of powerhouse, visibly moved.

But today, he was truly shocked!

Ye Yuan actually escaped from under his eyelids!

“This ... How is this possible? Space was clearly already locked down, even if it’s a Deva Fifth Blight, it would be impossible to escape too. How did he do it?”

“Too inconceivable! Could it be that Ye Yuan’s spatial law already surpassed the power of rules?”

“No wonder Saint Azure is so calm! This is simply too inconceivable!”

... ...

Shocked words lingered on incessantly, everyone was dumbstruck with amazement. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The space inside the hall just now was clearly already locked by Lin Chaotian, Ye Yuan was absolutely unable to escape.

But Ye Yuan vanished from under their eyelids just like that!

Lin Chaotian’s expression was very ugly. His majesty as Dao Ancestor was seriously provoked by Ye Yuan today.

“Your spatial law should be rank three source currently, right? Under my power of rule, even rank five source can’t possibly escape. So how did you do it?” Lin Chaotian looked at Ye Yuan with piercing eyes as he questioned.

He was extremely shocked in his heart. At the same time, he was also extremely excited.

Ye Yuan’s means were definitely related to the secret on him!

The more mysterious his means were, the stronger it meant this secret was!

If this secret was obtained by him, then what kind of terrifying realm would his strength reach?

Even thinking about it made people’s hot blood seethe with excitement!

Ye Yuan seemed to have seen through what Lin Chaotian was thinking and said with a sneer, “What you’re thinking is right. It’s indeed related to a secret of mine! If you want to know, wouldn’t you know after capturing me?”

Lin Chaotian’s face turned black and he said in a deep voice, “A bunch of nonsense! No matter how clever your tongue is, you can’t escape today either!”

Finished saying, he raised his fingertips. A surge of even more terrifying power of rule instantly spread across the world.

At this time, it was as if the entire Heavenspan World’s wood power of rule was used by Lin Chaotian.

In virtually an instant, the entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range’s space was enveloped by the power of rule.

“Rule cage! Space freeze!”

“Hiss ...”

The faces of those powerhouses changed suddenly. They knew that Dao Ancestor Life became serious.

Rule cage was a unique method of rule powerhouses.

Those who reach the realm of Deva Fifth Blight, because of their closeness to Heavenly Dao, their application of spatial law would reach an extremely terrifying level.

Therefore, in a battle between Deva Fifth Blights, wanting to kill the other party was too difficult.

But Dao Ancestors could use the power of rule to seal off the entire region of space, leaving one with nowhere to run!

Under the power of rule, everything was futile!

This move was far stronger than that sort of casually sealing off space earlier.

They felt as if the entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range’s space was frozen. They found it hard to take even a single step.
