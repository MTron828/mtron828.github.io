Chapter 1642 Pursui

Ye Yuan’s departure was somewhat shabby. Apart from Xuan Yu’s lineage, Coldfeather, and Zheng Qi, there were no others who saw him off.

Coldfeather patted Ye Yuan’s shoulder and encouraged him, saying, “Kid, you can do it. This old man is waiting for the day you leap over the dragon gate.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’ve never doubted this before.”

Coldfeather laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Fine lad, such a composed young man like you, it’s still my first time seeing. However, this departure has a long way to go, you have to be more careful!”

Ordinary geniuses, if they were stuck for so many years at a realm, they would definitely not want to live in and abandon themselves to despair.

But Coldfeather completely could not see this kind of negative emotion on Ye Yuan.

He was still positive and optimistic, giving people a calm and composed feeling.

This also gave Coldfeather and the rest a lot of confidence, making them feel that Ye Yuan could definitely break through.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Rest assured, this Ye still has some means to protect myself. You guys just quietly wait for the news of success. It’s just that, I’m unable to treat Head Elder Zheng Qi for the time being.”

Zheng Qi was currently very under the weather, but he definitely could manage to hang on to his life.

Hearing that Ye Yuan was leaving, Zheng Qi still insisted on coming to see him off.

Zheng Qi smiled and said, “If not for you, this old man wouldn’t even be able to save this remnant life. Now that Master’s great enmity is avenged, this old man no longer has any attachments in my heart. You rest assured and go. Even if this old man holds on, I’ll also have to hold out until the day you return!”

Seeing that Zheng Qi’s mental state was pretty good, Ye Yuan also smiled and nodded.

At one side, Ning Siyu was very unhappy, and muttered to herself, “Ning Tianping that fellow is really ungrateful. Clearly agreed to come and send off, but he actually didn’t.”

Over 300 years had passed, Ning Siyu also broke through to the Divine Lord Realm already now, becoming a Four-star Alchemy God.

This was also the point that was denounced by everyone.

Ning Siyu was also considered half a disciple of Ye Yuan. Now, even the apprentice broke through, but the master still remained at the Origin Deity Realm. It was simply incurring the ridicule of experts.

But Ning Siyu herself did not have this kind of thought. She was very grateful to Ye Yuan.

Without Ye Yuan, it was impossible for her to break through so fast, and even less possible to have her present attainments in Alchemy Dao presently.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If Heaven wishes it to rain or your mother to remarry, there is no way to stop it. For you guys to be able to come, I’m already very grateful.”

A friend in need is a friend indeed!

How many true friends you had did not depend on how many people surrounded you when you had high authority and power. It depended on how many people talked and laughed with you when you fell down to the ground from high above.

Clearly, these people in front of Ye Yuan were his precious friends in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

But Ning Tianping not coming was somewhat outside of Ye Yuan’s expectations.

With his understanding of Ning Tianping, he should not be so snobbish.

Unless he concealed his character too well.

But a young master like Ning Tianping should not be so profoundly shrewd.

“Alright, although you escort a guest a thousand miles, the parting comes at last. Everyone, please return.”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists toward everyone, bade farewell, and left.

...

In the Martial Tower, two people saw Ye Yuan off with their eyes.

“Brother Zuo, you are so optimistic about Ye Yuan?” He Chong asked the middle-aged man beside him.

To be able to make He Chong call Brother Zuo, this person was naturally that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s City Lord, Zuo Shujie, whose movements and traces were elusive and secretive.

Zuo Shujie smiled and said, “This boy is definitely not someone who belongs in a shallow pond! What does a momentary setback count for? The one who has the last laugh is the true winner.”

He Chong said in surprise, “Looking at his appearance, he has probably already exhausted his potential. Breaking through to the Divine Lord Realm will likely be very difficult. Geniuses like this are also not in the minority. In contrast, I still feel holding the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain in hand is a little more reliable.”

Zuo Shujie looked at He Chong, shook his head, and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Oh, you, take a long-term view! Do you think that the treasure on Ye Yuan is only an Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain?”

He Chong’s expression changed and he said, “Oh yeah! It’s because I wasn’t sure, that’s why I didn’t act.”

Zuo Shujie smiled and said, “Luckily, you didn’t make a move. Otherwise, I’d have to personally take action to stop you!”

He Chong said in surprise, “Why is that?”

Zuo Shujie said, “Back then, when this child was still at the outer city, he attracted my attention. To have such terrifying talent in alchemy and martial arts, the secrets on Ye Yuan are definitely far more than just an Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! And he’s greatly different from ordinary young geniuses. He’s level-headed, wise and farsighted, take every conceivable possibility into account, and is very broad-minded. Such a person, his mind is extremely tough, virtually equipped with all the conditions to become a peerless powerhouse! With his character, how could he easily put himself in danger?”

The more He Chong listened, the more alarmed he got, and he said, “Your meaning is?”

Even though the two people were Celestial Deity powerhouses, in terms of wit and cunningness, he was far lacking compared to Zuo Shujie.

Zuo Shujie said, “Back then, when this seat issued the edict, having him become a Pill Tower elder. If he refused, it means that he doesn’t have the strength to protect himself. He possessed a massive secret on him. Once he has covetous eyes cast on him by Celestial Deity powerhouses, wouldn’t it incur a deadly calamity? But if he agrees, what does that mean?”

He Chong’s entire body trembled and said, “It means that he has the strength to protect himself without fear of us!”

Zuo Shujie smiled and said, “At least ... we can’t kill him! A person like him, once he can’t be killed, the consequences will be very terrifying. That Wu Meng Capital City’s Qin Xiao might be our future outcome!”

He Chong came to a realization, listening until he broke out in a cold sweat, and said, “So that’s how it is! It’s still Brother Zuo who considers things long and far! But since that’s the case, there were many rumors floating around in the city. Why didn’t you speak up to stop it, or even urge Ye Yuan to stay?”

Zuo Shujie said, “It’s true that he’s a genius, but he’s just a genius who hasn’t grown up. Keeping him behind will only harm him. Moreover, with his personality, even if we want to keep him, we probably can’t keep him behind either. Right now, the Divine Lord Realm is clearly a massive hurdle placed in front of him. Crossing it, it’s a vast expanse of flat land. Can’t cross it, fade into the crowd! However, through these few years of observation, I still have some confidence in him.”

...

Ye Yuan did not know that Zuo Shujie’s appraisal of him was actually so high.

Traveling swiftly along the way, he already traveled as far as a million years.

Inside a dense forest, Ye Yuan suddenly stopped.

Ye Yuan suddenly said, “This place is very out-of-the-way, it’s precisely a fine place to kill and rob a person of his property. You guys not showing yourselves, when are you waiting for?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He did not deploy the Purple Extreme Hall along the way, because the moment he left the city, he discovered several tails following behind.

Sure enough, the moment the voice faded, four figures dashed out of the dense forest, surrounding Ye Yuan in the middle.

A third-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse who was in the lead said with a cold laugh, “Heh, well-deserving of being an elder! We really underestimated you!”

This person, Ye Yuan knew him. He was called Hao Lian, a Martial Tower’s high-level protector, and also Lin Dong’s good friend.

Presumably, the pursuit this time was likely linked to Lin Dong.

“A third-layered heaven Divine Lord, three second-layered heaven Divine Lords, you guys really think highly of this Ye!” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Hao Liang had an appearance of cornering Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Who doesn’t know that even though Elder Ye is at the Origin Deity Realm, he has the strength to cut down first-layered heaven Divine Lords? Dealing with you, no matter how seriously we take it, it’s not overboard too! But this lineup now, killing you should suffice.”

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Isn’t there still one more? Why don’t you have him come out?”

The moment these words came out, Hao Liang four people’s faces could not help changing.
