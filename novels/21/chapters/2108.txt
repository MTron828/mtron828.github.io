Chapter 2112: Aren’t You Proud?

Qi Zhen looked at Ye Yuan and said those words with a disdainful look on his face.

This alchemy battle indeed made him inexplicably shocked, and even have a feeling of being ashamed of his unworthiness.

But so what?

Could it be that because of this, the Qilin Clan was going to give away a peak empyrean spirit treasure?

What kind of concept was an empyrean spirit treasure?

That was a treasure on the same level as the World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl!

Such treasures could suppress a region and bring extremely good destiny.

Ye Yuan being able to rise up heaven-defyingly had an inextricable relationship with these two treasures.

Such a treasure, even when placed in the Qilin Clan, it was absolutely not a dispensable existence too.

If not for the Qilin emperor bone being too tempting and too extraordinary, it would be absolutely impossible for Qi Chen to suggest this kind of alchemy battle.

But now, they discovered that there was no hope of winning at all, and they could only choose this kind of shameless method to end this bet.

Qi Zhen really did not take Ye Yuan seriously. Even if he was Second Sage, he also could not posture on top of the Qilin Clan’s head.

“Is that so? I can’t keep you here, but what about it?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze had a cold look as he slowly took out the emperor bone.

The moment the emperor bone emerged, a power that seemingly came from great antiquity suddenly descended. All of the powerhouses in the hall felt their shoulders sink, a tremendous pressure descending from the sky. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Everyone’s faces changed colors!

On that day, when Ye Yuan took out the emperor bone, he did not trigger the power inside the emperor bone.

The aura that they felt flowed out of the emperor bone naturally.

But today, the pressure in the emperor bone was in full bloom. Even these Empyreans felt enormous pressure.

Of course, it was merely just pressure, it did not give Ye Yuan the power to contend with Empyreans.

But one person was different!

That person was Qi Zhen.

This was an emperor bone from the ancient era, the ancestor of the present Qilin Clan’s ancestor. How noble was the bloodline and how strong was the pressure?

This kind of pressure originated from the depths of the bloodline and originated from the depths of the soul.

“Kneel down for me!”

Ye Yuan’s cry was akin to the evening drum and morning bell in a monastery. Borrowing the might of the emperor bone, it shook until the great hall quaked incessantly.

Qi Zhen’s mind told him that he should not kneel.

However, his body and soul seemed to not heed his orders.

It was as if there was a demon in his heart, telling him to kneel down, to kneel down ...

In the midst of Qi Zhen’s trembling, he slowly knelt down.

One could tell from his body that his entire person was undergoing intense struggle.

However, it was to no avail!

Under such a powerful bloodline pressure, his body actually did not listen to orders anymore!

That instant when Qi Zhen’s knees came into contact with the ground, endless humiliation welled up in his heart.

He looked at Ye Yuan coldly, eyes bloodshot with rage as he roared, “Ye Yuan, you dare to humiliate me? Humiliating my Qilin Clan, you’ll die without a burial ground!”

Everyone opened their mouths wide, looking at this scene dumbfounded with gaping mouths.

Even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse like Gongyang Lie was also staring wide-eyed and tongue-tied at this time.

A primal variant species like the Qilin Clan, not only were they powerful themselves, the strength of their race was also powerful to the extreme.

Although he was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, when he saw a Qilin Clan’s distinguished talent like Qi Zhen, he also had to give in a little.

But Ye Yuan actually used this kind of radical method to make him kneel?

“Lord Second Sage, this ... is probably not appropriate, right?” Gongyang Lie said cautiously.

Ye Yuan ignored him, but his gaze looked at Qi Zhen calmly as he said with a cold sneer, “Isn’t your bloodline noble? Aren’t you incomparably proud? Aren’t you taking advantage of your power to bully people? Aren’t you being shameless? Then let me tell you today, your pride is utterly worthless in front of me!”

“I don’t need the Jadecleanse Truefire Bottle. The wager can also be written off. I, Ye Yuan, am not an unreasonable person! But your Qilin Clan is self-assured that your bloodline is noble and looks down on everyone under the heavens, calling off the bet with this kind of shameless method. Turns out that the words of an Empyrean powerhouse are like letting out a fart!”

“If it’s like this, forget it too. But you even ran in front of me to swagger and make a show of force, wanting me to hand the emperor bone over with both hands! If it’s once or twice, forget it, but you all really take me, Ye Yuan, to be a soft persimmon, and can be threatened by any random Tom, Dick, or Harry? Mn?”

Ye Yuan glared fiercely, akin to a celestial deity that descended, giving people a feeling like he was a god.

When the surrounding Empyrean powerhouses heard Ye Yuan’s denouncing, each and every one of them secretly sighed in their hearts too.

Indeed, even though Ye Yuan was a young genius comparable to Sacred Ancestor High Priest, he did not have the arrogance that a youth would normally have.

Even when Crimsonsky was being arrogant in front of him, Ye Yuan also just brushed it off with a smile in the end.

But this Qilin Clan went too far.

That matter on that day, everyone present knew.

When Qi Yun saw Ye Yuan, he said that the emperor bone was the Qilin Clan’s and was extremely overbearing.

Later, Qi You jumped out and was also like that.

Then later, Qi Chen, this late-stage Empyrean mighty expert came out and was the same too.

Discovering Ye Yuan’s identity in the end and knowing that the matter could not be done, he used a wager to seize it by force and trickery.

However, after witnessing Ye Yuan’s strength, the Qilin Clan went back on their word again!

If they reneged on their word, forget it, you come and say it nicely.

Lower your head and admit your fault, perhaps Ye Yuan would not haggle over it anymore.

Yet, this Qi Zhen made it seem that he was number one under the heavens and ran in front of Ye Yuan to posture. Disregarding canceling the bet with this kind of shameless reason, he even wanted Ye Yuan to hand over the emperor bone with both hands.

Even a clay bodhisattva had some anger, let alone Ye Yuan, this genius who enjoyed success at a young age and had a status comparable to Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

No matter how easy-going one was, they also had a limit, no?

It was just that they did not expect that Ye Yuan’s emperor bone actually had such terrifying power, to actually be able to pressure the Empyrean Realm Qi Zhen to directly kneel down.

“Aren’t you proud? Isn’t your bloodline noble? Then I’ll trample all of your pride underfoot!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan stomped down, directly stepping on Qi Zhen’s face and stepping onto the floor.

The enormous force directly stomped until the ground fissured apart.

Ye Yuan’s strength was not worth mentioning to Qi Zhen. It was just that his face hurt a little.

But the humiliation in his heart reached the peak at this moment.

He gritted his teeth and said viciously, “Ye Yuan, if you have the guts, kill me! As long as you don’t kill me today, I’ll grind your bones to dust and let you know what’s called true remorse!”

How proud was the Qilin Clan? Today’s incident would become his lifelong smirch. How could he not be enraged?

But threatening Ye Yuan, he was not worried that Ye Yuan would really do anything to him.

Humiliating him like this was already the limit that he could do.

Did he really dare to kill Qi Zhen?

The consequences of killing him were not what Ye Yuan could bear!

Except, he underestimated Ye Yuan’s resolve.

He had always yielded to soft tactics and did not bow to force. Even if a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor came over, he could forget about making Ye Yuan lower his head too, let alone a mere Qi Zhen?

It was only to see killing intent appear in Ye Yuan’s eyes. The bone sword was already gripped in his hand.

“Huhu, you think that with you having the Qilin Clan a backer, I won’t dare to do anything to you? Since that’s the case, then I’ll send you off! I want to see what the Qilin Clan can do to me!”
