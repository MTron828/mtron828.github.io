Chapter 1392 Three Bows!

“This ... What’s wrong with the Sage Stone?”

Wen Yiyang gave a shocked cry, looking at the Sage Stone in disbelief.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

On the Sage Stone, cracked fine lines actually appeared!

When everyone saw this scene, they all unconsciously became nervous, not understanding what happened.

“Senior, what’s going on here? Could it be the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s effect?” Ye Yuan asked Dustless.

“Heh, this Sage Stone is merely a divine lord’s profound treasure. To actually dare pry into the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, isn’t this an elderly person eating arsenic, seeking death?” Dustless said disdainfully.

Ye Yuan felt his head swell. If this was broken, the Wu Meng Academy would definitely suspect him.

“Senior, can you make the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain pull back or not? At this rate, I’ll be screwed,” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

Dustless smiled and said, “You refined the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, why did you come and ask me instead?”

Ye Yuan was stunned, hurriedly revolving the Chaos Heavenspan Canon in secret, attempting to communicate with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

Sure enough, that oppression released by the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain gradually restrained itself.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he heaved a sigh in relief too.

After the intense tremor, the Sage Stone finally stabilized.

Those cracked fine lines were already slowly repairing itself.

Seeing this scene, only then, did Wen Yiyang’s expression get a little better. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Academy Head, this ... what’s going on here?” Ye Yuan pretended to be frightened and said.

Wen Yiyang was also uncertain and shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. This kind of situation has never appeared before in the past. Did you have any special feelings just now?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “No.”

Wen Yiyang frowned and said, “Then that’s strange. I feel ... the Sage Stone seems to be afraid of something! But now, it should have recovered to normal. Let’s continue the ceremony then! Carve the characters!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, leaped up, and soared to the sky.

Clank!

The Evil Extermination suddenly moved out, engraving ‘Ye Yuan,’ two big words, on the Sage Stone!

Ye Yuan landed. Those two large characters immediately became dazzlingly golden, glaring and eye-catching.

When everyone saw Ye Yuan’s valiantness and heroic bearing, they were all incredibly envious.

When Qin Tian looked at this scene, for the first time in his life, he felt jealousy, this emotion.

All along, he had always been the object of jealousy.

In his eyes, there was only the Divine Lord Realm. He had no rivals among peers at all.

But today, that youth whom he sentenced as a dead man entered the Hall of Fame ahead of him, becoming the youngest Hall of Fame member in Wu Meng Academy’s history!

He looked at Ye Yuan’s back view, a cold light glinting in his eyes.

Qin Tian already made up his mind, the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time, he had to let Ye Yuan die inside!

“Congratulations to Ye Yuan for immortalizing his name! Respectfully see the sage off into the Hall of Fame!”

Under Wen Yiyang’s voice, the Sage Stone concealed into the void once more, disappearing.

“Starting from today, you all shall receive Ye Yuan’s kindness. Bow and pay homage to the sage!” Wen Yiyang said to all of the students.

Qin Tian, Wang Song, as well as the Qin Family’s disciples all revealed very ugly expressions on their faces.

Especially Qin Tian, he actually had to bow down and pay respects to Ye Yuan. This was simply even more awful than killing him.

“One bow!”

Several thousand students on the plaza bowed down towards Ye Yuan. Wang Song’s expression changed a few times, finally still bending his waist down unwillingly.

On the entire plaza, only Qin Tian alone stood still.

Wen Yiyang’s brows furrowed and he said in a cold voice, “Qin Tian, why ... aren’t you moving?”

Qin Tian’s face was livid, the resentment in his head rising to the extreme.

Ye Yuan looked at Qin Tian rather interestedly, very much wanting to see what he will do.

Ye Yuan also never expected at the beginning that handing over Sundering Stars actually still had this kind of secondary effect.

This Qin Tian did not place him in his sights at all back then. But now, he had to bow toward him. He was probably extremely unwilling, right?

Qin Tian’s expression changed several times, and he said out loud, “Lord Academy Head, Qin Tian will never cultivate this sword for life, there’s no need to bow to him!”

Ye Yuan was rather surprised. He did not expect that this guy was still quite resolute.

It was then that Wen Yiyang gave a cold snort and said, “You don’t cultivate this sword. But could it be that you’re not a student of Wu Meng Academy? You dare to guarantee that your clansmen won’t cultivate this sword either? Predecessors plant trees for descendants to enjoy the shade under the tree! The martial techniques and cultivation methods left behind by past sages benefit generation after generation. What right ... do you have to not bow?”

Qin Tian’s knuckles were clenched until they cracked. Finally, he still lowered his proud head and bowed down toward Ye Yuan.

He knew that the outcome of continuing to contradict Wen Yiyang was being kicked out of Wu Meng Academy.

Even the Qin Family could not possibly compare foundations with the Wu Meng Academy.

Being chased out, he would have nothing worthy of praise!

Seeing this scene, a hint of a smile showed at the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

This guy still submitted in the end.

At this time, Qin Tian just happened to finish bowing. Raising his head and seeing this hint of a smile, that sense of humiliation instantly filled his chest.

“Second bow!” Wen Yiyang shouted again.

Everyone bowed again!

Qin Tian felt like he was about to explode. But he had no choice but to bow toward Ye Yuan once more.

“Third bow!”

Qin Tian’s entire body trembled as he bowed down once more!

“Ceremony complete!”

The moment Wen Yiyang’s voice fell, Qin Tian immediately flicked his sleeves and left.

Today was a day of extreme humiliation for him.

He and Ye Yuan could not live under the same sky, but he had no choice but to bow towards this enemy. This was truly a tragedy.

After everyone dissipated, Little Fatty Xie Jingyi found Ye Yuan and said with a wild laugh, “Did you see Qin Tian’s expression? Hahaha ... Just now, it really killed Lord Fatty, me! But I didn’t dare to laugh and nearly stifled out internal injuries. Hahaha ...”

Little Fatty’s laughter was as if no one was around drew a series of sidelong glances. The Qin Family’s disciples all used indignant gazes to look over.

Sensing these unfriendly gazes, Little Fatty chortled and said, “What? Want to hit me? Come on! Come hit me! Hahaha ... I just like to see the appearance of you all be pissed off looking at me, and can’t kill me off.”

Ye Yuan smiled wryly and shook his head. Ever since the incident last time, this punk seemed to have become a different person.

Although he was still that joker personality, he was no longer as weak as before but became incomparably arrogant.

...

Sundering Stars becoming a supreme academy skill naturally drew the attention of many students.

Its power, everyone had borne witness to it before. Everyone all coveted it immensely.

But they only discovered to their dismay after spending points to exchange for it that this martial technique was seriously too profound!

Even if Ye Yuan’s personal journal was very detailed, their understanding was also very difficult.

The more Wen Yiyang studied Sundering Stars, the more shocked he got. He discovered to his surprise that with his realm, he actually had many hard to understand areas about this martial technique too.

But without a doubt, this was a powerful to the extreme martial technique.

Ye Yuan did not hold back. On the contrary, he made a lot of notes.

It was just that this martial technique had some areas that corresponded with the Chaos Heavenspan Canon. Without cultivating this cultivation method before, wanting to thoroughly grasp Sundering Stars was simply as hard as ascending to heaven!

Wen Yiyang studied with great concentration for a month’s time and was actually only able to unleash 50% of Sundering Stars’ power too!

He wanted to advance another step, but he could not do it no matter what.
