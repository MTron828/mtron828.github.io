Chapter 1469 Spiriteye Green Soul Powder

“Your Excellency, what should we do now?” A subordinate could not refrain from asking.

Xiu Lie’s face was extremely grim, his gaze revealing a hint of viciousness as he said in a solemn voice, “We can’t wait anymore. Summon the whole army, attack the city now! We only have one path now, breaching the city!”

The other generals’ faces also revealed decisive looks as they answered, “Yes, Great General!”

Xiu Lie said in a solemn voice, “Tell them that our way out is already cut off. There’s only cutting off all means of retreat that we can survive!”

The fiend race had a brutal and ruthless temperament. Cutting off all means of retreat would be able to trigger their courage instead.

The fiend race army that flew over the natural chasm was roughly 30 thousand people.

While the human army currently defending the northern city were merely several thousand people.

This battle, who would win or lose was still unknown.

...

On the northern city walls, Zong Tao looked at Zhao Bin with a cold face.

“Didn’t you say that the fiend race has infiltrated outside of the northern city? Where are they?! The southern city has already been fighting fiercely for three days and nights, casualties heavy, where are they?! Mn?” Zong Tao lectured with a ferocious look.

Zhao Bin’s expression was very ugly. He was also not too sure anymore.

If the fiend race army really sneaked in, they should have long launched an offensive.

The southern city’s battle situation was abnormally tragic. E heard that the First Army had heavy casualties and even had their military designation canceled already.

Of course, the fiend race’s situation was even worse. It was said that they had already lost 70 thousand people.

Corpses littered the field below the southern city!

But why hasn’t the captain returned until now?

“Didn’t you say that Ling Feng went to spy on the enemy situation? Don’t let it be that he became a deserter!” Zong Tao said in a cold voice.

Zhao Bin’s expression changed and he said, “Impossible! There’s no way the captain will be a deserter!”

Wang Yifeng’s brows also knitted together tightly. Could it be that it was really a rumor deliberately spread by the fiend race?

Right at this time, a subordinate came to report, “Commander Wang, the southern city is making an urgent request for help, the Fifth Army is virtually completely wiped out! The great general asks you to bring the northern city’s garrisoned generals and head for the southern city to support!”

Wang Yifeng’s pupils constricted. Drawing a deep breath, he said, “Got it, I’ll bring people over at once!”

Finished talking, he said loudly, “All generals listen up, the army will immediately set out to assist the southern city!”

Hearing Wang Yifeng’s command, a glimmer of smugness flashed across in Zong Tao’s eyes. But he looked at Zhao Bin and said with a cold smile, “Giving false information about the military situation, contradicting your superior officer. After this battle, I’ll see how the few of you escape punishment by military law!”

The army was already fully equipped, heading to the southern city. Quite a number of soldiers already started going down the city walls.

Right then, a heaven-shaking battle-cry suddenly came from outside the northern city.

Everyone got a huge shock and did not come back to their senses for some time.

Zong Tao looked at the fiend race army with an astonished look, his eyes full of disbelief.

It was actually true!

His back dripped with cold sweat. If the great general did not partake in Zhao Bin’s opinion, the city would be breached in a blink of an eye now!

“Fiend army! It’s the fiend army! Quick, defend the city!’

In the crowd, no idea who shouted too, finally pulling everyone back to reality.

Wang Yifeng also drew a cold breath. It was actually true!

The fiend race really flew over the natural moat and circled around to the northern city!

So close!

Just a bit more and they would be leaving the city walls.

Once their army went down the city walls, the fiend race army would be able to jump up the city walls in virtually an instant!

At that time, how could these mere several thousand people stop the fiend army?

“Don’t panic! Everyone back in position, release the arrows!”

Wang Yifeng mustered up divine essence, shocking all of the soldiers abruptly awake.

The commander-in-chief was as if a sea-stabilizing divine needle. With him howling, everyone’s minds immediately settled down, and sure enough, started organizing a defense in a well-ordered manner.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh ...

The archers took their places. Countless sharp arrows tore through the air, shooting at the fiend army.

These arrows were all specially made. The arrowheads carried a strong explosive talisman; extremely strong lethality towards the fiend army.

Engaging in fierce battles with the fiend race over a long period of time, the humans naturally developed many ways to deal with the fiend race too.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The fiend army charging at the front immediately had a swathe collapse!

However, those fiend soldiers all did not fear death and did not care about the deaths of their companions around them at all, rushing over towards the city crazily.

Seeing this scene, Wang Yifeng’s brows furrowed.

He sensed that these fiend soldiers’ auras were somewhat unusual.

It seemed like ... there was a feeling of looking at death calmly in the face.

Although the fiend race was fierce, they were not ever-victorious.

They would also be struck with fear and be afraid of death too.

But this fiend army in front of them was like fierce tigers breaking the dam; all of them were not fearing death!

“Giant crossbowmen, prepare! There’s a half-step Divine Lord general in their army!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xiu Lie’s imposing momentum was seriously too powerful. Wang Yifeng saw it with one glance and could not help raising the vigilance.

These giant crossbows were produced by human artifact refining masters. It had extremely strong lethality towards half-step Divine Lord powerhouses too.

Although half-step Divine Lord powerhouses were able to fly in the air, unless they had no other alternatives, they would not charge forward.

“Kill, kill, kill!”

The fiend race army’s battle-cries shook the skies, rushing below the city walls very quickly.

Xiu Lie yelled in a cold voice, “Fiend Dragon Throwing Spear, shoot!”

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh ...

The fiend race naturally had large-scale siege equipments too. They carried them with large-scale storage spaces.

It was only to see one throwing spear after another shoot out fiercely, directly nailing on the city walls.

There was a small portion that flew right over the city walls, directly stabbing to death a large swarm of human soldiers.

With these throwing spears, those fiend powerhouses would be able to climb up.

Deity Realm powerhouses could not fly, but their strengths were much stronger than mortals.

As long as they were given a pivot point, they would be able to jump up the city walls very quickly.

A tragic great battle immediately commenced.

While at this time, Ye Yuan was currently on a hill not far away from the city, observing the situation of the entire battle.

“Looks like this side can’t hold on until the reinforcements come at all!” Ye Yuan made his own judgment very quickly.

“The fiend race are indeed natural warriors. Their skin is coarse and their flesh is thick. Furthermore, their fiend souls are very powerful. They are very difficult to kill. Humans are indeed a little weak when placed in front of them,” Dustless said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Luckily, I had some preparations along the way. Otherwise, I’d really be at a loss on what to do at this time.”

Dustless also smiled and said, “You punk, you’re really meticulous in doing things. Even I also didn’t think about things to prepare for dealing with the fiend race.”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “This is called preparedness averts peril!”

On the way to Tiderain City, Ye Yuan consulted Dustless about the fiend race’s weaknesses.

Along the way, he had indeed made quite a bit of preparation.

Now, it indeed came in handy!

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang had fought for many years. He was naturally well-aware of the fiend race’s weaknesses.

Fortunately, there were quite a few divine essence stones given by the Myriad Treasure Tower in Ye Yuan’s hands. He collected quite a few good stuff along the way in various cities.

Ye Yuan took out a small bottle. Inside the small bottle was full of green powder.

“Heh heh, this bottle of Spiriteye Green Soul Powder is probably enough for them to choke on!”

Ye Yuan smiled and opened the vial. Those emerald-green fine powder went with the wind very soon, flying into the fiend race’s main camp.
