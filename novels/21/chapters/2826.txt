Chapter 2832: Great Victory!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“ARGH!”

Asharp and miserable scream echoed through the spatial passageway.

Within the spatial passageway, it was like dominoes. A chain reaction happened, and it collapsed with a loud bang!

And the energy of the space collapse went from the ‘one’ in the beginning, to the level of atomic fission later on.

This level of collapse, the energy undulation was already comparable to the all-out attack of a peak Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse!

Such strength, even May, this Emperor Sakra Ten Heavens powerhouse, did not dare to brush it off lightly too.

Boom! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Due to the intense explosion, half of Lotuswear’s body was directly blown away.

Li He’s entire person was blasted into a cloud of blood mist.

However, their fearsome regeneration ability restored them to health again.

Except, it was still futile.

That horrifying to the extreme explosion was omnipresent!

Revive once, explode once!

Revive once, explode once!

Until the back, Li He was already unable to revive and completely obliterated by the energy of the spatial collapse.

This blood race northem front army’s highest commander was buried alive by Ye Yuan just like that.

“Little Bastard, Your Mother will definitely kill you!” Lotuswear screamed sharply.

Her current situation was also unbelievably tragic.

The violent spatial collapse bombarded her until she was powerless to fight back.

‘As for the May who was opposite, he had a struck senseless look.

Who am I?

Where am I?

What did I come for?

He came in a threatening manner and only saw a Saint Sovereign Heaven, then he was blown up.

He had monstrous strength. He could still resist the initial collapse.

But toward the back, the energy undulations of the collapse became stronger and stronger, and even he was blown up too.

“Shit, who can tell me what happened? AHH!”

Before May finished speaking, his head was blown apart.

But very soon, he grew another head.

However, it was similarly futile.

Emperor Sakra Heaven and Hegemon Realm seemed to only have the difference of one realm, but the gap in-between was like heaven and earth.

Amidst this vast energy undulations, peak Emperor Sakra Heavens were just small rowboats too.

‘Time and again, May finally could not revive his body anymore and was completely wiped out!

One of the Emperor Sakra Ten Heavens, May, lost his life at Ye Yuan’s hands!

A little earlier, Dan Fei and Zuo Chen two people consumed heavenly pills, and their injuries took a turn for the better very quickly.

The two people did not care much and were going to enter the passageway.

However, just as they arrived at the spatial passageway, horrifying explosion sounds suddenly came from inside the passageway.

Dan Fei two people’s expressions changed. Before they had time to react, they were immediately sent flying by an air billow.

Furthermore, the explosion noises in the passageway grew stronger and stronger!

The two people exchanged a glance, their eyes full of shock.

“This … Was this Ye Yuan’s doing?” Zuo Chen swallowed his saliva and asked.

“$-Should be, right?” Dan Fei said uncertainly.

“Then how did he do it?”

“N-No idea!”

“This energy undulation that spread out can even blast us flying. Then the energy level in the passageway has probably already reached Emperor Sakra Heaven, right?”

“Most likely … more than that! This spatial passageway collapsed from the inside! The energy level in the depths of the spatial passageway can probably kill Emperor Sakra Heavens easily! Even if the person who came is May, it’s likely certain death too!”

As Dan Fei said, he himself also felt that it was incredulous.

According to this level of energy undulation, the people who entered … should have already all died out!

Was this … really done by a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven?

Dan Fei two people felt like they had experienced a dream.

They had not woken up from this dream until now.

It was because everything that happened before their eyes was seriously too fantastical.

Zuo Chen swallowed his saliva again and asked, “Does that mean that … our mission is completed?”

“Completed? Huhu, more than completed! It’s perfect! Li He is dead! Lotuswear is dead! May … is dead too! Our mission was impeccable and flawless!”

Talking until the back, Dan Fei started trembling agitatedly.

It was originally impossible for this sort of thing to happen to a Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouse.

Each Emperor Realm powerhouse was very important.

Even in the blood race, Emperor Realm powerhouses could not just die like that too.

The deaths of May three people did not just concern this battle presently. It would also produce a subtle impact on the battle situation on the southem front too!

This was an impeccable victory!

Zuo Chen also understood, but he was still unable to fully believe it.

‘That moment when Lotuswear appeared, he already despaired!

Lotuswear’s strength was too strong. Her appearance completely squelched the hopes of the Emperor Realm powerhouses.

As for the Saint Sovereign Heaven army there, they actually did not harbor much hope.

‘With 50 thousand troops versus 30 thousand troops, wanting ten thousand people to rush over, this was virtually something impossible.

However, in this kind of desperate situation, an insignificant Saint Sovereign Heaven completed the final hit!

Perhaps Ye Yuan was not an ordinary Saint Sovereign Heaven, but in front of this kind of great battle, he was still insignificant.

However, this insignificant Saint Sovereign Heaven completed an act that shocked the world!

This kind of conclusion, it was not over the top to call it a miracle!

“Then … Ye Yuan he …” Zuo Chen muttered.

Dan Fei’s expression changed, the wild elation from before instantly vanishing.

Right!

Even May died inside, could Ye Yuan still survive?

‘The energy undulations inside could kill Emperor Realm powerhouses. Furthermore, it was continuous without ceasing.

It was impossible for Ye Yuan, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, to survive.

Logically speaking, a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven exchanging for such a glorious victory was an amazing bargain.

But, no idea why, Dan Fei could not get happy.

He even felt that with Ye Yuan dying inside, this battle was no different from a defeat.

Perhaps … it was because he created too many miracles!

“Cough … cough, cough …”

Right at this time, a series of intense coughing sounded out behind them.

The two people suddenly turned around, only to see someone who was riddled full of holes standing there.

“Ye Yuan! You didn’t die!”

‘The two people exchanged a glance, their eyes full of unrelenting shock.

This guy actually came out alive!

Holy shit, energy undulations that could even blow an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse to death, he actually came out alive?

“You guys … wanted me dead so much? Cough, cough, cough …” Ye Yuan said huffily.

“Hahaha … No! Nope! My good disciple! My good disciple!”

Zuo Chen was agitated until he was rambling, rushing up to hug Ye Yuan and planting a kiss on his face that was covered in blood.

Sadly, Ye Yuan did not have the strength to fight back at all, being badly disgusted by him.

“Hey, do you have some weird fetish or something? S-Stay further away from me!” Ye Yuan pushed Zuo Chen away and said in disgust.

This scene looked comical, but it was very warm.

Dan Fei, who was by the side, also had an agitated look as he said, “Terrific lad! You’re amazing! The boast that you made is actually really realized! In this battle, our Heaven One gained a complete victory! There are probably quite a lot of people on the blood race side who are going to puke blood! Hahaha

Talking until the back, Dan Fei could not resist letting out a loud laugh.

This satisfactory victory really gave people great satisfaction!
