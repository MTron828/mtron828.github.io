Chapter 1360: Top Dog

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

An archaic city wall that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life continued in an unbroken line, like an enormous dragon dancing in the air underneath the firmament, making people daunted at the sight of it.

Wu Meng Capital City’s magnificence, only by experiencing it personally, could one really feel it.

When Han Tian saw Xiao Feng once more, he could not help getting a huge shock.

“Elder Xiao, you ... you really comprehended new things?”

Xiao Feng coming back this time, his aura was clearly different. It actually gave him an elusive feeling.

There seemed to be something about to erupt within his body.

Without a doubt, Xiao Feng definitely had attained deeper comprehension.

Even if he could not really break through that step, he would also be closer to that step.

Xiao Feng smiled and said, “Huhu, it looks like this old man’s response wasn’t wrong! During this trip, I really gleaned considerable benefits!”

Although Xiao Feng’s answer was not so certain, it was sufficient to make Han Tian shocked.

“That boy called Ye Yuan is really so miraculous?” Han Tian said in shock.

Xiao Feng nodded his head and said, “Even more miraculous than you imagine! This boy is simply born for alchemy! In terms of depths, he’s inferior to me; but in terms of foundation, I’m too far behind to catch up!”

Han Tian’s gaze turned intent, monstrous waves stirring in his heart.

These words coming out of Xiao Feng’s mouth, the weight was too heavy!

Although Xiao Feng’s character was gentle, his pride was contained in the bones. This point, Han Tian was all too clear.

Working together for so many years, Han Tian had yet to hear him praise a person like this before.

Moreover, it was even a junior who was just Grotto Profound Realm!

However, to be able to make Xiao Feng have some insights, it was sufficient to indicate this Ye Yuan’s extraordinariness. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Han Tian knew that Han Tian was already stuck in this realm for more than 10 thousand years!

“Hearing you say so, I’m really interested in this boy! Oh, right, such a talent mustn’t be missed!” Han Tian said.

Xiao Feng smiled bitterly and said, “I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint Tower Lord. That kid ... has already decided to enter the Wu Meng Academy!”

Han Tian could not help choking up when he heard that and said, “Elder Xiao, such a talent, how can you let him go?”

Xiao Feng said helplessly, “This old man already did my best. Along the way, this old man has worn my lips out, but that boy is a stubborn donkey. Once he decides on something, nobody can pull him back.”

Han Tian said disappointedly, “Sigh, truly a pity!”

Xiao Feng said, “Tower Lord doesn’t need to be too disappointed either. This old man is also considered good friends with him despite a great difference in age now. On account of this old man’s face, he has already agreed to continue to be our Myriad Treasure Tower’s guest alchemist. With this layer of relationship there, he can’t cut away from the Myriad Treasure Tower. Furthermore, Yang Rui has done pretty well these few years, maintaining a strong relationship with Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan that boy values relationships and friendships immensely. He won’t do something like kicking someone to the curb after they’ve outlived their usefulness.”

Only after hearing Xiao Feng said so did Han Tian feel a little better. But his eyes still could not hide the look of disappointment.

“Yang Rui this kid is pretty good, promote him to be a deacon then. The connection with Ye Yuan in the future will be passed to him,” Han Tian said.

Xiao Feng smiled and said, “Huhu, you’re making an exception to promote him! Regardless of whether it is strength or seniority, he’s not enough to be a deacon. However ... if we can maintain Ye Yuan’s layer of relationship well, the Myriad Treasure Tower will definitely obtain even greater benefits in the future! Oh, right, Yang Rui and Ye Yuan had an agreement. If Ye Yuan fails during the Wu Meng Academy’s entrance examination, he’ll join the Myriad Treasure Tower!”

Han Tian’s eyes lit up, and he said, “Since that’s the case, why not ... we do some tricks in the test, how about it?”

Xiao Feng hurriedly said, “Don’t! That boy is shrewd, even me going to Jewelhill City, he could guess! You doing so, if it’s detected by him, it will have an opposite effect! Alright, this old man already can’t wait to enter seclusion. That boy offended Brightraise City’s Wang Family, I’m worried that they will trip that boy, you need to pay attention.”

Han Tian scolded laughingly, “I got it! You old punk, probably can’t even wait for a moment, right? Really envious of you. I, Han Tian, still don’t know when I can take this step!”

...

With Wu Meng Academy’s examination approaching, the young faces in the city also became more.

In Clearwind Inn, it was already overcrowded, by mostly young faces.

These young martial artists were mostly accompanied by followers. At first glance, they were the disciples of wealthy and influential families.

Grassroots martial artists were short on resources, cultivation arduous. Wanting to have some accomplishments before 200 years old was very, very difficult.

Hence, those coming to participate in the examination were mostly the various major counties’ major families’ disciples.

Genuine grassroots martial artists were very few. Those able to spend at Clearwind Inn, this kind of large restaurant, were even rarer.

“I heard that Wu Meng Academy’s examination this time just happens to coincide with the new year. The young martial artists taking part in the examination are as many as a million people!”

“It’s useless no matter how many people! Wu Meng Academy’s examination doesn’t regulate the number. As long as one can pass through three rounds of assessments, they can be admitted. Whether or not they can pass through the examination depends entirely on their own strength.”

“That might be the case, but with this number increasing, the number of geniuses will also increase. Probably this time, there will be quite a number of formidable people appearing! I wonder this time ... who can seize the spot of the top dog.”

“That makes sense! To talk about the top dog, it’s probably among the Wu Meng Four Young Masters, as well as Brilliant Peace City and East Dock City, these few cities’ those few people, right?”

“Most likely! These few people are too strong. Those able to be their match are also the few of them.”

...

In a corner window-seat, four people sat around the table, currently listening attentively to the others’ discussions.

These four people were precisely Ye Yuan, Yang Rui, Liang Wanru, and Luo Jian, four people.

First time here, Ye Yuan naturally had to understand the local customs and practices.

Hearing ‘top dog’ these two words, Ye Yuan became interested.

“Brother Yang, what is this top dog?” Ye Yuan asked.

Yang Rui said, “The person who passes through three rounds and ranks first!”

Ye Yuan said curiously, “This isn’t hard to understand. It’s just that obtaining this top dog, are there any benefits?”

Yang Rui said, “That is, of course! The person who gets to become the top dog is able to obtain a generous reward. More importantly, he’ll become City Lord, His Excellency’s in-name disciple! When he ascends to the inner-court, he’ll become City Lord, His Excellency’s personal disciple, with his status incomparably exalted. The resources enjoyed is also not what the others can compare to! Therefore, the once every hundred years entrance examination, the fight for the top dog is the most intense.”

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised and said, “So that’s how it is! It’s just ... even if one obtains this top dog, they might not firmly occupy first place in the future either, right?”

The path of Martial Dao was full of variables. Today’s number one might not mean the future’s number one.

Some people’s thick accumulations erupt, catching up from behind. One-shotting the top dog back then was not an impossibility.

Yang Rui nodded and said, “Hence, the top dog is just an in-name disciple and not a personal disciple. If he fades into the crowd in the future, then he’ll forever be an in-name disciple. But even so, the title of the top dog represents taking cultivation’s expressway, future accomplishments limitless! After all, the resources he enjoys is what others can’t compare to.”

Ye Yuan came to a realization. Becoming the top dog was equivalent to having special privileges. Cultivation was naturally faster than others.

For the others to want to surpass, they must put in a hundred times, a thousand times the effort.

Those able to truly surpass the top dog were extremely, extremely few.
