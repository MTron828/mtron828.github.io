Chapter 2606: Holy Mountain

“Mn??Why is that?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Just issuing a letter of challenge, why could it not go as he wished?

He Yunxiang smiled bitterly and said, “Your Excellency, during these three years that you were in closed-seclusion, the other nine cities already had six city lords who ascended to the second level. Right now, in this first level, there are only three of the original ten great city lords left.”

When Ye Yuan heard, he could not help being stunned and said, “They didn’t ascend for so many years. Then why did they …?Eh??It wouldn’t be because of me, right?”

He Yunxiang nodded and said, “Who else can it be if not you? Your battle with Changsun Xingyu was too shocking. It spread throughout the ten cities very quickly. The city lords of Qing Liang and Bi Xia, these two cities, chose to ascend within three months. The other six city lords also ascended one after another within two years.”

Nobody was a fool; let alone these supreme powerhouses who were standing at the summit of the first level.

Ye Yuan made Changsun Xingyu the first target of attack. He was bound to challenge them later.

This battle was too shocking. They did not wish to become Ye Yuan’s whetting stone.

This kind of pinnacle battle, a moment of carelessness and it was the outcome of perishing and Dao dissipating. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Although these city lords were exceptionally talented individuals and did not fear fighting to the death either, they also know how to pursue good fortune and avoid disasters.

No one would go and choose to fight to the death under the circumstances that they knew they would definitely die.

That was an old person eating arsenic; courting death!

Therefore, they chose to ascend.

Can’t provoke, I can hide!

Of course, you could ascend too.

But reaching the second level, the opponents you would be facing would plenty. You naturally would not come and pester the few of us.

Actually, these overlords not ascending was also not completely because they wanted to live the life of being a local despot.

They were accumulating strength. Only by ascending with sufficient strength could they live better after reaching the next level and also walk even further.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth twitched and he said, “Aren’t there still three city lords? Since they haven’t ascended yet, then they can’t be wasted too. Go and issue the challenge letters.”

He Yunxiang smiled bitterly again and said, “That won’t work either! Fu Guang, An Yun, and Lan Ling, three cities’ city lords have already arrived at Resplendent Sun City half a year ago, to express surrender to Your Excellency! Apart from this, the other six cities’ new city lords are also all in the city.”

Ye Yuan could not resist rolling his eyes, this bunch of grandsons really did not give any chance at all!

One would not hit a smiling face!

With Ye Yuan’s personality, since the other party took the initiative to submit, he really could not find it in him to take action anymore.

However, Ye Yuan also understood that the Land of Exile was such a realistic place.

If you were strong, you could bring everything to its knees!

Helpless, he waved his hand and said, “Since that’s the case, bring them over then.”

… …

“Fu Guang’s lord, Lin Tong, pays respects to Lord Ye Yuan!”

“An Yun’s lord, Wei Xiang, pays respects to Lord Ye Yuan!”

“Lan Ling’s lord, Xu Weiqing, pays respects to Lord Ye Yuan!”

… …

With Fu Guang three cities’ city lords leading, the other city lords stepped forward in unison to pay respects.

This also symbolized that Ye Yuan had completely compelled the Land of Exile’s first level into submission!

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept across everyone and discovered that Lin Tong three people faintly exuded an extremely strong aura. It was even a notch above Changsun Xingyu.

He could not help being a little surprised and said, “I originally thought that the three of you should be the weakest among the nine great city lords. Looking at it now … it doesn’t seem to be the case!”

Lin Tong stepped out of the ranks and said with a bow, “What Your Excellency said is true! The three of us were ranked top three among the original ten great city lords! And Changsun Xingyu was ranked fourth!”

This ranking, only the ten great city lords themselves knew.

Now, Lin Tong saying it in public still surprised everyone greatly.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he became curious and asked, “Since that’s the case, then why didn’t you guys ascend but come to submit to me?”

Lin Tong said respectfully, “Your Excellency gained enlightenment on Greater Sublime Transformation. Now, you also broke through to grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, we’re naturally not a match. But ascending just like this, we have unwillingness in our hearts too.”

Ye Yuan said, “You guys also want to comprehend Great Dao Transformation?”

Lin Tong did not shy away and said with a nod, “That’s right! The reason we, the original ten great city lords, had a Dao debate every year, was in order to break through the shackles and comprehend Great Dao Transformation! With Your Excellency’s talent, you should know the logic of the stronger the foundation, the greater the potential. Therefore, unless there were no alternatives, we didn’t want to ascend. Unless, we’re already sure that our talents have already been exhausted!”

With regards to this statement, Ye Yuan naturally approved of it.

Lin Tong three people came to submit while bearing humiliation and were also not willing to ascend. This proved precisely that the three of their martial path hearts were very firm.

However, Lin Tong’s words let Ye Yuan thought of another possibility.

This Land of Exile’s city lords changed very fast.

There would always be people like Lin Tong three people who also wanted to consolidate their realms in Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum as much as possible and feel Great Dao rules.

Could it be there was actually not a single one who comprehended Great Dao Transformation after so many years?

This was unlikely!

Ye Yuan did not doubt that his talent was high, but he similarly did not think that others were losers.

Especially in the Land of Exile this sort of place, some people had it forced out by force.

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan asked hopefully, “Then in this first level, are there still powerhouses who comprehended Great Dao Transformation?”

Lin Tong said, “Of course there are! In fact, there are quite a few!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he could not help being overjoyed, thinking to himself that it was indeed the case!

“Oh??Where? Tell me!” Ye Yuan said.

Lin Tong said, “There’s a snow-capped mountain in the land of extreme north called Xianyun Mountain. It’s the Land of Exile’s first level’s holy land! Only powerhouses who gained enlightenment on Great Dao Transformation are allowed to step into this mountain!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered slightly and he said, “So, you guys stayed, in order to enter the Xianyun Mountain?”

Lin Tong nodded slightly and answered, “Your Excellency is wise. It’s precisely so!”

The other six city lords were all rendered speechless. Only now they learned that the first level actually still had such a place!

And what the city lords assiduously seek, was this kind of supreme realm!

What was laughable was that they were all a bunch of frogs at the bottom of a well; that was all!

But when Ye Yuan heard, he was overjoyed and said, “Then what are we still waiting for! Lead the way!”

Lin Tong three people were taken aback and said, “Your Excellency, we’ve never comprehended Great Dao Transformation and can’t enter the Holy Mountain. Violators will be killed without mercy!”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “If I said that you can go, you can go! Whatever bullshit Holy Mountain, it’s merely a bunch of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums; that’s all! If they know what’s good for them, fine. If they don’t know how to appreciate favors, I’ll exterminate their whole mountain! See if that lousy mountain still dares to call itself Holy Mountain or not!”

Ye Yuan could not bear the sight of this kind of trickery the most. It was clearly just a bunch of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums, yet they wanted to feign an appearance of standing high above the masses.

Who were they scaring!

He, Ye Yuan, had virtually paralyzed the entire Martial Secure Heavenly Sect. Wouldn’t dealing with a bunch of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums be easily accomplished?

Posturing in front of him, at least in this first level, there was definitely no one who could do it!

When Lin Tong three people heard that, they were immediately rendered dumbfounded.

This guy was so wildly arrogant!

How did such a person survive until now?

One had to know, some of those Great Dao Transformation individuals on Xianyun Mountain had already stayed for as long as several thousand years, with their strength being unfathomable.

This guy actually completely did not place the Xianyun Mountain in his eyes!
