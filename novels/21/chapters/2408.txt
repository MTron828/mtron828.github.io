Chapter 2414: Must Kill!

“Lord Daymeld, what in the world is going on?”

Just a major thing happening naturally alarmed a chief commander of the divine race, Daymeld.

At this time, Daymeld was currently observing that area of shattered space. Yu Qin was currently standing beside him with a puzzled expression.

Until now, he also did not understand how Ye Yuan did it.

If Ye Yuan brought Nineorigin to flee crazily, this was still a little more explainable.

But Ye Yuan was too calm!

Under the siege of a group of Nine-marks experts, he brought Nineorigin away slowly just like that.

This was really a resounding face-slapping. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Daymeld paced back and forth at the edge of the shattered space, having a pensive expression on his face.

Suddenly, he said with a deep gaze, “What a terrific spacetime illusion! I didn’t expect that after an epoch, a genius who fused time and space laws actually appeared in the human race again! It’s not your fault for being unable to hold this boy behind!”

Everyone’s expression changed wildly, a look of shock on their faces.

The information that Lord Daymeld said was seriously too shocking.

These divine race upper echelons all knew that it was precisely Grand Ancestor Spacetime who cast the art of Spacetime Reversal Chaos back then, exiling Lord Tian Qing to the spacetime turbulence. That was how it resulted in the divine race’s overall defeat.

That Grand Ancestor Spacetime could be said to be the most terrifying enemy in the history of the divine race!

Now, Grand Ancestor Spacetime had long since passed away. But who knew that another person who fused time and space, two supreme laws, appeared again?

How could this news not be shocking?

“Lord Daymeld, you mean ... illusion?” Yu Qin said with an ugly expression.

Daymeld nodded and said, “Spacetime illusion. It isn’t any ordinary illusory art. This makes use of the law power of spacetime, making a high-level difficulty martial technique of making spacetime distort. It’s an extremely profound application of spacetime law! You all thought that you killed him, but actually, you merely killed the him in the distortion of time and space. What you all saw isn’t a real person at all! I’ve seen before Progenitor Tian Qing and Grand Ancestor Spacetime’s great battle back then, and more or less I know a little about the prowess of spacetime law.”

After he mused for a while, he continued, “This boy’s spacetime law is already evolving towards Grand Ancestor Spacetime’s that kind of level! After he reaches Deva Realm, he’ll be my divine race’s great enemy!”

Having said that, Daymeld had a solemn look.

Tian Qing’s battle with Grand Ancestor Spacetime back then was still seemingly before his eyes.

That kind of terrifying power, even he could not intervene too.

Those two people were both the most pinnacle existences in this world, nobody could replace them!

It was just that he did not expect that ten billion years later, another human youth actually fused time and space laws!

Yu Qin and the rest had shocked faces after listening.

“Lord Daymeld, then we cannot let this boy remain alive,” Yu Qin said.

Daymeld nodded his head and said, “You all don’t need to be too worried either. Even if he really grows up, he’s not Progenitor Tian Qing’s match either! Back then, how heaven-defying was Grand Ancestor Spacetime? Wasn’t he also forced into bringing about his own destruction by Ancestor Tian Qing? However, I still need to look into this matter thoroughly and find this boy to avoid future troubles.”

Hearing this, only then did everyone let out a sigh in relief.

Right at this time, a group of people flew straight from the distance in a panic.

When Daymeld and the rest saw, they could not help frowning slightly.

“Aren’t you all the Divine Children Legion? How did you end up like this? Where’s Tian Xu?” Yu Qin said with a frown.

This group of people was precisely the Divine Children Legion. Many of them were slaughtered by the human army until they fled helter-skelter.

These remnants of defeated troops were no more than a hundred people. Each person was wounded, looking very miserable and abject.

These few days, they had been wandering outside all along, fleeing very carefully, fearful of running into the human army.

It took many days before they escaped back to the camp.

When the divine child leading them saw Yu Qin, he knelt on the ground with a thud and said sobbingly, “Lord Yu Qin, we finally saw you! Our ... Our Divine Children Legion has been virtually annihilated!”

Everyone’s body trembled including Daymeld’s.

This news had not been transmitted back to the camp yet. When they heard it now, all of them were dumbstruck with shock.

Even if there was Nineorigin’s incident, Yu Qin also would not have thought that the entire Divine Children Legion was almost wiped out!

“What the hell happened, quickly say!” Yu Qin said in a solemn voice.

That divine child had a weeping face, recounting the events of the human army’s surprise attack one by one.

When Daymeld heard that Ye Yuan killed Yuan Zhen and the rest with the Sword of Spacetime, his color finally changed.

“What did you say? He ... He fused time, space, and sword, three kinds of power of laws?” Daymeld questioned.

Fusing two power of laws and fusing three kinds of power of laws, the concept was totally different.

Especially that it was even time, space, and sword, these three!

Once fused, the power was simply unimaginable!

He was still saying no need to worry just now. But now, he was also not sure in his heart anymore.

Grand Ancestor Spacetime was extremely monstrous, fusing the two great supreme laws into one.

But this guy actually fused Sword Dao law inside too, surpassing Grand Ancestor Spacetime.

If he grew up, how would that do?

The divine child had a bitter look as he said with a nod, “Yes! That kid even has a Dao artifact in possession. It’s a very strong bow! He paired the Sword of Spacetime with the Dao artifact, and shot Lord Yuan Zhen to death with one sword!”

Daymeld’s expression changed wildly and he cried out in surprise, “What did that bow look like?”

The divine child was pressured by Daymeld’s powerful aura until he virtually could not breathe.

But he did not dare to hide it, describing the appearance of the bow while sweating.

Daymeld’s expression changed again and again. Gnashing his teeth in hatred, he said, “Limitless ... God Killing Bow! So, it’s him! It’s that kid! I didn’t expect this! I really didn’t expect this! In just less than 2000 years, he had already grown to such a level!”

For so many years, that figure who cut off his arm was never able to dispel from his mind.

Condensing heaven and earth sword intent for his one use, and cutting off his arm with a sword.

That sword back then was truly breathtaking to the extreme.

But so many years had passed, that young man’s strength already grew to a frightening level.

Now, he condensed time, space, and sword, three power of laws, coupled with the Limitless God Killing Bow.

How could this kind of power be what human strength could block?

Killing a Nine-marks powerhouse at Heavenly Emperor Realm, this was simply too insane!

Yu Qin and the rest did not know about Daymeld’s thoughts and asked with uncertainty, “Lord Daymeld, who on earth is this boy?”

Daymeld’s expression was solemn, and he said in a cold voice, “He’s the person who cut off this ancestor’s arm when this ancestor escaped from the blood pool back then! At that time, he was merely at the Empyrean Realm. I didn’t expect that in just a few years, his strength actually already grew to such a level! This boy definitely can’t be let to live! No matter how great a price paid, he must be killed!”

Yu Qin and the rest were shocked when they heard it. They did not expect that the mysterious youth who barged into the divine race camp alone was actually the person who cut off one of Ancestor Daymeld’s arms!

This guy was really the divine race’s nemesis!

But hearing that Ye Yuan fused three great laws, they were also aware of the seriousness of the situation.

If they allowed this boy to continue growing unchecked, he would likely be Ancestor Tian Qing’s life-and-death great enemy!

They could tell that Daymeld already had the heart to definitely kill Ye Yuan!
