Chapter 2963: Hegemon Imperishable’s Requiem!

“Heh,?Old Ghost Imperishable, you don’t need to be unruly with us either! Your strength has indeed exceeded our imaginations, but reaching our realm, you’re not willing to die just like that either, right? If you really had this determination, you also wouldn’t be dawdling with us here.”

With regards to Hegemon Imperishable’s threat, Hegemon Evil Dragon just laughed disdainfully.

Although the present situation was far beyond their expectations, nobody could hide their thoughts from anyone.

Reaching this level of realm, no one was a fool.

Hegemon Imperishable just snorted coldly. Clearly, he had tacitly acknowledged Evil Dragon’s statement.

“Moreover, we’re not here to kill you either. As long as you’re trapped here, that’s enough! After those descendants of yours have died out, we can let you out too,” Hegemon Bloodsong said with a laugh, looking like he had cornered Hegemon Imperishable.

“Mn??That kid’s strength is too weak. His consciousness is already almost dissipating,” Heavenly Soul said.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan’s consciousness was already disorderly and confused.

Once his consciousness dispersed, the soul body would be a masterless object, and one would be considered to be completely dead.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s residual consciousness still had a strong reluctance.

“The Purple Ripple Umbrella is already right before my eyes!”

“I can save Lingxue right away. How can I die just like this?”

“No way! I can’t die!”

“Absolutely not!”

… …

This intense unwillingness made his consciousness still remain there.

Even if it was just an insignificant trace, it was like a feeble spark, stubbornly not dissipating.

Saving Mu Lingxue, this breath, had already supported him until now. He was absolutely not willing to give up now!

Two hours, four hours …

In a blink of an eye, a day passed. The four great Hegemons all thought that Ye Yuan was already dead for sure.

But he actually held on stubbornly just like that.

With this, the four great Hegemons were shocked.

The four of them mutually restrained each other and were bored out of their minds.

Ye Yuan and Cloudneon’s arrival brought them a trace of fun.

Therefore, their attention was placed on these two people very naturally.

Compared to Cloudneon, Ye Yuan was naturally a little more worth paying attention to.

It was because he was about to die right away.

“This boy has such a powerful will! Like this and he’s still not dead!” Hegemon Evil Dragon marveled. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“This seat wants to see just how long this kid can last,” Bloodsong said.

Heavenly Soul smiled and said,?“Hur hur,?it’s boring too. Why don’t we bet how long this boy can last?”

Evil Dragon laughed and said,?“Haha,?good idea! This boy’s willpower is indeed very strong. This seat bets that he can last ten days!”

Bloodsong also smiled and said, “I’ll bet 15 days!”

But Heavenly Soul smiled and said, “There are a million origins here. This kid is like a drop of water that fell into the sea. How long more can he last? In the end, he can only be assimilated! I bet that he absolutely can’t last three days! Old Ghost Imperishable, you’re of the Imperishable Soul Physique too. What do you think?”

The one who understood the Imperishable Soul Physique best was naturally Hegemon Imperishable.

Hegemon Imperishable was silent for a while and said, “Three months!”

The moment these words came out, the three great Hegemons all burst out laughing.

Clearly, this was a joke.

Although you’re of the Imperishable Supreme Hegemon, don’t treat us, these Supreme Hegemons, as morons either.

Like this, he could last three months?

“Old Ghost Imperishable, do you feel that it’s very boring now, and you’re teasing the few of us?” Heavenly Soul could not help laughing as he said.

“Forget about this boy, even if it’s this seat back then, under this sort of environment, I can’t last a month too! You’re actually saying that this boy can last three months?” Hegemon Bloodsong laughed in spite of himself.

“In this place, there’s not a trace of other variables. His consciousness is already close to disappearing. If he can last three months, this seat will pluck my head off for you to kick!” Hegemon Evil Dragon said disdainfully.

Hegemon Imperishable gave him a glance and said coolly, “Then be prepared to pluck your head off.”

Finished saying, he shut up and stopped talking.

Regarding Ye Yuan, this second true Imperishable Soul Physique, Hegemon Imperishable naturally paid great attention.

He seemed to have seen himself back then from Ye Yuan.

Not the Imperishable Soul Physique, but the person!

That sort of unwillingness to be outdone by others, that sort of stubborn unyieldingness, he saw it from Ye Yuan.

Back then, in order to lead the Nirvanic Soul Clan to rise, he challenged the entire Qi Soul Clan with his power alone.

That sort of difficulty was absolutely hell-level.

How many times had he narrowly escaped death; how many ups and downs he had; he relied on his astonishing willpower to pull through.

But, as an Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, he knew Ye Yuan too well.

Without something that could influence the situation, it was impossible for him to pull through!

Ye Yuan came to the wrong place!

If Ye Yuan entered at origin realm, this place would definitely be a paradise.

But he was currently too weak!

Right now, this God Bewildering Battlefield was the nightmare of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique.

Therefore, he felt that three months was the limit.

Very soon, three days passed.

The first to get slapped was Hegemon Heavenly Soul.

Heavenly Soul’s expression was very ugly as he said in a solemn voice, “This brat is really a rock in the latrine, smelly and hard. What’s the point of holding on like this?”

Hegemon Imperishable smiled coldly and said, “Hence, that’s why you, this idiot, would be surpassed by this seat!”

Hegemon Heavenly Soul’s face turned black, and he said in a great rage, “Imperishable, you’re courting death!”

Hegemon Imperishable was indifferent and said coolly, “Is that so? If you want to perish together, bring it on!”

Hegemon Heavenly Soul gave a cold snort and stopped talking.

When Hegemon Imperishable was a nobody, he was already a Supreme Hegemon.

But countless years had passed, and Hegemon Imperishable’s strength had already surpassed him.

Got to admit, this sort of thing was very disgraceful.

If not because the Qi Soul Clan still had a Hegemon Samsara, they would really be completely suppressed by the Nirvanic Soul Clan.

It was just that Hegemon Samsara’s status was transcendent, traveling the myriad worlds. He did not ask about the soul race’s affairs at all.

If not for this existence, Hegemon Heavenly Soul would have long been unable to suppress the Nirvanic Soul Clan.

Ten days later, Hegemon Evil Dragon was slapped in the face.

“This boy is also too monstrous, right? Does he feel that he can really go against the heavens?” Evil Dragon said somewhat glumly.

Later on, after 15 days, Hegemon Bloodsong was slapped too.

This boy actually really survived for 15 days!

This … How was this possible?

“Forcibly hold on like this doesn’t have any meaning at all! It’s absolutely impossible for him to survive,” Bloodsong shook his head and said with a sigh.

Time passed day by day, 15 days, 20 days, a month!

Three months were up!

This time, even Hegemon Imperishable was slapped in the face too!

Because Ye Yuan lasted three months!

With this, the four great Supreme Hegemons were really shocked.

“Just what kind of unfulfilled wishes does this boy have? Hanging on with this one breath, is he going to hold on until heaven and earth turn old??Hur hur,?Old Ghost Imperishable, looks like you’ve miscalculated too!” Hegemon Evil Dragon said with a laugh.

Hegemon Imperishable let out a sigh and said, “Young man, give up. It’s too hard for you to hold on like this. There’s no meaning!”

Hegemon Imperishable’s words carried a requiem effect, directly reaching Ye Yuan’s last trace of consciousness.

But he completely did not expect that his one sentence was like throwing a bunch of withered grass on the spark!

Instantly, the spark reignited!
