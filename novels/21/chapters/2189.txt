Chapter 2193: Kill! Kill! Kill!

“Come and fight!”

The three words being spat out of Ye Yuan’s mouth were akin to evening drum and morning bell in a monastery, reverberating in the entire sundered boundary.

The domineering aura made Ye Yuan look akin to a god of war. He was not to be profaned!

Not a single person actually dared to step forward!

Several hundred Empyrean powerhouses were absolutely an extremely terrifying force in the outside world.

Such a line-up could practically take down the vast majority of great imperial capitals in the Heavenspan World already.

But now, they were intimidated by Ye Yuan alone!

Ye Yuan drew the bone sword and stood proudly among them, with the heroism and sorrow of a warrior who would never return again.

He understood that this was just that first wave!

But he did not care!

Why should he, Ye Yuan, fear a battle?

Xin’s brows furrowed tightly, clearly very dissatisfied with these abyss monsters’ performance.

“What are you all still waiting for? Want this Divine Son to personally take action?” Xin yelled coldly.

Only then did those abyss monsters seem to go crazy, charging over toward Ye Yuan.

Several hundred Empyrean level abyss monsters, there were even quite a number of Fourth and Fifth Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters among them.

What kind of terrifying force was this!

Ye Yuan’s bone sword drew a line, Sword Hollow Etch suddenly attacking.

With one exchange, three First and Second Firmament Empyrean level abyss monsters died under the sword!

But it was also this instant that Ye Yuan fell into the sea of monsters.

All around him was surrounded fully by powerful attacks.

It was just that these attacks were nothing to Ye Yuan. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Under spatial law, he could easily avoid this degree of attack.

Those he had to truly be careful about were Fifth Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters.

Because these existences could hurt him.

Under such a chaotic battle, it was impossible for Ye Yuan’s spatial law to completely avoid injuries.

After all, the strength of Fifth Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters was too strong!

Ye Yuan’s sword swam like a wandering dragon, wandering among the horde, coming and leaving as it pleased.

Places that it arrived at, it would reap the lives of those low-level abyss monsters mercilessly.

True·A Sword Crossing the Void!

True Sword Hollow Etch!

Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven!

Ye Yuan executed one move after another, and he actually killed many of them until the monster horde was in a great fluster.

Xin frowned, clearly being very dissatisfied with the performance of the abyss monsters.

“Humph! Truly a bunch of useless things! So many Empyreans actually can’t do anything to a Second Firmament Empyrean!” Xin said with a cold snort.

But Nineorigin was not like him. Instead, he said rather interestedly, “Xin, this punk isn’t weak! Furthermore ... this punk is odd!”

Xin said with disdain, “So what? In front of the Divine Race, the human race is merely an ant that will crumble at the first blow!”

Nineorigin shook his head and said, “This boy is greatly different! Did you notice it? He’s completing battles after battles, absorbing the power of the tarnished black devil crystals!”

How sharp were Nineorigin’s eyes?

Although Ye Yuan did it covertly, he saw it clearly!

With each abyss monster he killed, he would snatch the tarnished black devil crystal over and secretly absorb its power.

But at this time, Ye Yuan’s speed of absorption was ten times than normal!

The current Ye Yuan could not care about whatever realm stability anymore.

He had to rapidly increase his strength right now!

He had to nurture his strength through constant battles, and he would then break through to the peak initial-stage Chaos Realm in the midst of the process!

Initial-stage Chaos Realm did not have a bottleneck. As long as he kept on absorbing, he could increase his strength rapidly.

At present, his realm was currently swiftly rising toward the peak Chaos Realm.

Hence, even though the battle was fierce, Ye Yuan’s chaos divine essence did not reduce, but it increased instead, his strength skyrocketing!

Xin’s expression changed and he cried out in surprise, “How can it be possible? Humans will explode and die from absorbing devilish energy!”

Nineorigin smiled lightly and said, “Heh, what’s strange about this? Even though I don’t know what cultivation method this boy is using, he can actually simulate the aura of abyss monsters and hoodwink everyone. It’s sufficient to indicate his formidable aspect!”

Xin’s entire body trembled and he said in disbelief, “How can it be possible? This sort of thing, even our Divine Race can’t accomplish it!”

Nineorigin smiled and said, “The man that can make Divine Daughter take a fancy to is bound to be extraordinary! Of course, he’s naturally much worse compared to Divine Son.”

Only after hearing this did Xin’s expression become much better.

“That’s of course! Our Divine Race is this world’s strongest race to begin with, while each of our branches’ Divine Sons and Daughters, they are all distinguished talents among peers; absolutely powerful existences. How many cruel battles has this Divine Son experienced before I have today’s position? Just based on him, a mere human, what qualifications does he have to be mentioned in the same breath with this Divine Son?”

Nineorigin smiled slightly, clearly very much in approval of this.

He knew that for Xin to be able to have today’s achievements, that was relying on absolute strength, crushing his peers and standing proudly above all heroes!

He had the qualifications to be arrogant!

At this time, Nineorigin suddenly turned to Yue Mengli. Taking a step, he arrived in front of her.

“Stop!” Yue Mengli shouted coldly.

Nineorigin smiled and said, “Divine Daughter, Nineorigin has already promised to let him go. It was him who isn’t willing! Can you go with me now?”

Yue Mengli smiled coldly and said, “Don’t you think about it! My divine essence has already spread throughout my entire body. As long as you move, I’ll explode and die! If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try!”

Nineorigin’s brows furrowed. He did not think that Divine Daughter was actually so decisive. Letting out a sigh, he said, “Forget it, carry on watching then!”

At this time, the battle already entered a white-hot stage.

Ye Yuan’s sword emerged like the wind, killing with each move, and already killed several dozen abyss monsters.

His realm already closed in on peak initial-stage Chaos Realm!

But by the side, Manya was in a thunderous rage and let loose a torrent of abuse towards the subordinates below.

“Are you all a bunch of pigs? So many Empyreans actually can’t deal with a puny little human!”

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so strong.

Those Fifth Firmament Empyrean powerhouse existences could not touch Ye Yuan at all and were brought around in circles by Ye Yuan.

While Ye Yuan was like a sharp blade. Places that he passed through, he would wantonly reap lives.

Seeing that the situation was not good, Manya roared loudly, “All of you go down for this emperor, kill this boy!”

He was speaking to the dozen over Sixth Firmament Empyrean commanders!

And right at this time, Ye Yuan’s aura skyrocketed!

Finally, he reached peak initial-stage Chaos Realm!

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Ye Yuan roared thrice, stepped onto the void, the spirit of the true dragon emerging.

Heretic Dragon Dominating Space!

The spirit of the true dragon trampling down, the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open, the void trembling.

Below Fifth Firmament Empyrean, they were actually all smashed to death by this foot!

One foot crushed more than a hundred Empyrean abyss monsters to death!

Sixth Firmament Empyreans had yet to take the stage and those Fifth Firmament Empyrean powerhouses were already frightened until they retreated to one side.

There was only Ye Yuan alone on the battlefield, being the last one standing!

The entire place was dead silent, everyone used incomparably shocked eyes to look at Ye Yuan.

Even those Sixth Firmament Empyrean abyss monsters who were just planning on going down, they were actually all cowed into not moving forward.

The current Ye Yuan was akin to a fiend god, giving people a feeling of not being able to overcome with force!

The arrogant and unyielding abyss monsters were also suppressed by Ye Yuan in aura!

Consecutively slaying several hundred Empyrean level abyss monsters, not only his imposing momentum did not diminish, it rose to another high instead!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s word pointed at the firmament and he glared furiously as he roared, “A bunch of ants, to dare claim to be exalted, come again!”
