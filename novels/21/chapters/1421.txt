“Cough, cough, cough ...”

“Puhwark!”

Inside a hidden underground palace hall in the Sky Foothill World, Qin Tian coughed violently, and following that, vomited a large mouthful of blood.

“Really damn it! I didn’t expect to get implicated by accident, being severely injured by that damn Life End Palace Lord. With this, no idea how long I’ll be delayed!” Qin Tian said with a gloomy face.

After Qin Tian infiltrated into the Sky Foothill World, he did not dare to move about in the outside world in such a flagrant manner like Ye Yuan.

Once discovered by people that he was an outsider, he would face the entire Sky Foothill World’s pursuit.

Especially that mysterious Sky Foothill Divine Palace. Just how powerful was its strength, nobody knew either.

He had laid low for a long time and finally found an opportunity, running into a lone sacred palace elder.

With Qin Tian’s strength, as long as he did not encounter the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s Origin Deity powerhouses, he could basically roam as he pleased in the entire continent.

Hence, he finished off that elder with momentum like a thunderclap, searched his soul, and knew about this elder’s everything.

Done with all these, Qin Tian disguised as this elder, covered his face, planning on infiltrating into the sacred palace and borrowing the sacred palace’s strength to investigate Ye Yuan’s whereabouts.

He did not expect that on the way, he encountered the assassination of an assassin with extremely fearsome strength!

With this, Qin Tian met with eight lifetimes of rotten luck.

Although that killer’s realm was inferior to Qin Tian’s, his concealed assassination abilities were first-rate.

Under the ambush, he seriously wounded Qin Tian.

However, Qin Tian was Wu Meng Capital City’s peerless genius in the end. By relying on his powerful strength, he slew this assassin.

Only upon searching the remnant soul of this killer did Qin Tian learn that this guy’s assassination target was precisely that elder. He actually blocked the spear for that old thing!

The killer’s strength was not weak, causing massive wounds to Qin Tian. It was hard to recover in a short while.

However, he learned from that killer’s remnant soul that this killer was the palace lord of an assassin organization called Life End Sacred Palace!

The strength of the opponent this trip was too powerful, and that was why he would personally take action.

With this, Qin Tian was even more depressed until he went crazy.

What was called passing away before getting the final victory was probably this sort of situation, right?

Qin Tian’s mind stirred. Might as well disguise as this Life End Palace Lord and hide in the Life End Sacred Palace. This way, it was safer.

Suddenly, someone outside the hidden room requested an audience. Qin Tian forcefully suppressed the injuries on his body and pretended to be profound.

“Reporting to Palace Lord, the thing that you wanted to inquire about, this subordinate has already inquired clearly! Recently, there was indeed an expert called Ye Yuan who rose to fame, even slaying a Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse with Grotto Profound Deity Realm cultivation, already becoming a legend in the entire Sky Foothill World ...” said the subordinate outside the door carefully.

This palace lord did not have a good temper and would kill people at a drop of a hat.

Inside the hidden chamber became silent, with no activities for quite a while.

That subordinate did not know that the ‘palace lord’ currently had monstrous waves stirred up in his heart!

Grotto Profound Realm slaying Heaven Glimpse powerhouse, this was also something that virtually no one could accomplish in the Heavenspan World.

Ye Yuan actually did it!

Although the strength of Sky Foothill World’s Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artists could not match up to the Heavenspan World’s on the whole, Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm was Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm. It was absolutely not what Grotto Profound Realm martial artists could compare to.

This guy’s rise already cannot be stopped! If I don’t kill him here, probably after he ventures out, I won’t have the chance to kill him anymore! Qin Tian secretly thought.

Qin Tian imitated the Life End Palace Lord’s voice and said in a cold voice, “Go and spread an intel, say that this Ye Yuan is an invader! This matter must be settled, and let all of the sacred palaces know. Lastly, it even has to spread to the Sky Foothill Divine Palace, understood?”

That subordinate’s expression turned fearful and he hurriedly voiced his assent, ” Yes, Palace Lord! This subordinate understands!”

“Puhwark!”

The moment that subordinate left, Qin Tian could not resist vomiting a large mouthful of blood again.

“This Life End Palace Lord’s concealment killing arts are truly profound. I had my heart meridians wounded by him. Without a few year’s time, I probably can’t recover.”

Qin Tian swallowed a medicinal pill, slightly alleviating the injuries. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“This guy used no idea what kind of method, to actually be able to hide from the Sky Foothill World’s powerhouses’ eyes and ears! But, you probably never dreamed that I, Qin Tian, would infiltrate into the Sky Foothill World, right? When the Sky Foothill Divine Palace finds you, I see how you still continue to be arrogant! H-Haha ... cough, cough, cough.”

...

Ye Yuan indeed did not know that Qin Tian actually followed his footsteps and came to the Sky Foothill World.

In Wu Meng Academy, the missions that students accept were strictly confidential!

Firstly, it was in order to protect the student’s safety.

Secondly, it was in order to protect the small world’s coordinates from leaking out.

Unless there was the Wu Meng City Lord or Academy Head’s tacit consent!

For Qin Tian to be able to get the coordinates already indicated many problems in the first place.

Learning that the Divine Ruins were opening 10 years later, Ye Yuan entered closed-seclusion.

Before departing, Ye Yuan used points and low-grade divine stones, respectively exchanging for a large batch of Tier 1 spirit medicines.

These Tier 1 spirit medicines, he had refined all into medicinal pills to use for cultivation.

Now, each minor realm that Ye Yuan raised had to expend massive resources. It was more than ten times that of other people.

Fortunately, he was an alchemist himself. Otherwise, he could forget about breaking through.

In a blink, Ye Yuan cultivated for as long as 10 years inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space. His realm finally reached the peak state of grand completion Grotto Profound.

“Senior, I seem to have already touched the threshold of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm. But this Chaos Heavenspan Canon, I keep on being unable to create the second level!” Ye Yuan sighed emotionally.

With Ye Yuan’s comprehension of Heavenly Dao as well as comprehension in the power of laws, breaking through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm was just an inevitable thing.

He had just reached peak grand completion Grotto Profound and already had a feeling in his heart. This was already much stronger than the vast majority of martial artists.

It was just that the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, this cultivation method, was too heaven-defying. Wanting to go a step further was truly as hard as ascending to the heavens.

If not for so, Dustless also would not object to Ye Yuan creating a cultivation method back then.

Dustless sighed and said, “Grotto Profound, discerning heaven’s secrets, it’s just having a feeling in your heart. Heaven Glimpse, looking at a leopard through a tube, seeing only one spot, glimpsing a corner of Heavenly Dao. The cultivation methods that others cultivate are shallow. The corner of heaven that they glimpse is naturally much smaller. While you, the Heavenly Dao that you have to pry into is too many and too large. This step is more than a hundred times harder than others!”

Ye Yuan said, “The battle with that Heaven Glimpse powerhouse the last time, I had a feeling in my heart. It’s just that this trace of opportunity, no idea when it will come again.”

The last time Ye Yuan comprehended the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, he opened up a gap with Alchemy Dao as the opportunity.

But this time, he could not.

Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao still only remained at the standard of One-star Alchemy God and was totally unable to open the second level’s gap.

Dustless fell silent for a moment and suddenly opened his mouth to say, “You’re in dire need to increase strength currently. Since that’s the case, why not activate the World Suppressing Stele’s Death Cultivation Space then?”

Ye Yuan froze and said, “Death Cultivation Space?”

Dustless nodded and said, “This is actually the Martial Dao inheritance that Immortal Grave planned on leaving to his disciples. It’s just that this cultivation space is too dangerous, so I never told you all along. Death Cultivation Space, one will really die!”
