Chapter 2074: Distinguished Guest

“The Amethyst Instant Pill doesn’t work too?”

Ye Yuan shook his head with a disappointed look. He already lowered the benchmark by a lot, but this Empyrean Loneswan’s strength somewhat disappointed him.

Looking at the other party’s appearance, he reckoned that being able to reach the middle-stage Dao Realm was already very impressive.

Most likely, he was still lingering around the initial-stage Dao Realm.

“Uh ... then let’s lower the difficulty a bit, Earth Nether Imprint Pill then.”

Ye Yuan talked to himself. Empyrean Loneswan’s face opposite turned green.

This guy was absolutely here to nauseate him.

“Humph! Earth Nether Imprint Pill then! This Empyrean wants to see if you really have that much capability, to be able to refine a level nine medicinal pill,” Empyrean Loneswan said with a cold snort.

Although this Earth Nether Imprint Pill was a level nine medicinal pill, he still had some confidence. Basically, refining middle-grade or even high-grade was not too big of a problem.

Below the stage, the faces of Song Cao and the rest were similarly ugly.

The rank six medicinal pills that Ye Yuan said, forget about refining them, they could not even learn the rudiments of them.

Their master could naturally refine them, but the success rate was not high either.

It was not that they doubted Master’s strength, but that these medicinal pills were seriously too difficult to refine.

But in the view of other martial artists, they were somewhat surprised.

Empyrean Loneswan ... yielded to Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan said three kinds of medicinal pills, but he chose the final medicinal pill. Clearly, he did not have much confidence in the other two.

“Humph! Ignorant fool! To refine level nine medicinal pills, one needs to at least enter the Dao Realm before one has the chance to refine those pills successfully. He’s so young, so could it be that he can be a Dao Realm powerhouse?” Song Cao said with a cold smile.

“Humph, so what even if he’s a Dao Realm powerhouse? Our master is already peak initial-stage Dao Realm. Coupled with the disparity in cultivation realm and soul force, could he still lose to him?” Luo Yu said with a disdainful look.

Amidst the questioning voices, the two people started the alchemy battle.

The moment Empyrean Loneswan’s aura released, everyone burst into an uproar.

These martial artists had never seen a Seven-star Alchemy God take action before. The moment he made his move at this time, it was God knows how many times stronger than the likes of SonG Cao.

To these martial artists, it was incredibly astonishing!

“This is the strength of a Seven-star Alchemy God! Even level nine medicinal pills are also a piece of cake to Lord Loneswan, right?”

“That kid actually wants to challenge such an existence, is his head okay?”

“Heh, in my view, this kid is deliberately here to nauseate people. At his age, knowing some superficial knowledge is already pretty good.”

... ...

The moment Empyrean Loneswan made his move, it gave people an extremely breathtaking feeling.

It was as if what everyone saw in the past were all ugly girls. Now, suddenly seeing a top-grade beauty, it drove people crazy.

There was a wave of cheering voices below the stage, cries of exclamations, as well as disdainful voices toward Ye Yuan.

Ning Tianping could not resist rolling his eyes and said speechlessly, “Truly a bunch of bumpkins who have never seen the world before. This bit of strength can let them cheer until like this.”

Song Cao was standing right beside him. Hearing that, he said in a great rage, “This bit of strength? That brat probably doesn’t know how to refine pills at all, right? You look, he hasn’t even started until now!”

Ning Tianping laughed in spite of himself and said, “My lord is being kind-hearted and is giving your master a chance to perform. The moment he makes his move, your master will be crushed until he could be badly mauled all over!”

Song Cao smiled coldly and said, “Being razor-tongued can’t change the outcome too! You guys had best be prepared to hand over the Sunshine Glow’s recipe.”

Ye Yuan stood on the stage, his gaze brimming with a look of disappointment.

Empyrean Loneswan’s bit of strength could not even compare to the weakest Empyrean in the Cloudpill Summit!

“Open!”

Ye Yuan gave a low cry, reached his hand out, and beckoned. The medicinal pills were all taken into the medicinal cauldron.

Immediately after, a vast surging aura burst out of his body.

Everyone’s cheers abruptly ceased!

Under Ye Yuan’s aura, Empyrean Loneswan’s alchemy aura was like a baby; weak to the extreme.

Empyrean Loneswan’s expression changed wildly, the seals formed in his hands could not help but to stop.

It was only to hear a puff. A burnt smell came out of the medicinal cauldron. The materials inside were directly being refined into a ruined pill.

It was very taxing for him to refine level nine medicinal pills to begin with, so how could he withstand Ye Yuan’s heavy pressure?

To him, Ye Yuan’s aura was like Mount Tai crushing down on top of him; he did not have the slightest strength to resist at all.

A shock to the extreme expressions appeared on Empyrean Loneswan’s face.

However, he did not fly into a great rage but was attracted by Ye Yuan’s pill refinement very soon.

Not just him, his disciples were also drawn by Ye Yuan’s bedazzling pill refinement.

In a place like the Northernmost Steppe, encountering such earth-shaking alchemy skill was undoubtedly like a good rain after a long drought to them.

Ye Yuan’s every move and action had a tremendous sense of beauty, possessing unusually deep Dao accumulations.

In their eyes, Ye Yuan was not refining pills but manipulating the Great Dao!

This kind of alchemy skill had simply reached the acme of perfection; inconceivable!

Amidst everyone’s cries of exclamations, Ye Yuan successfully condensed the pill.

Only after a long time did Empyrean Loneswan awaken from the shock. Then, amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, he bowed in salute toward Ye Yuan and said, “Master Ji’s alchemy cultivation is unrivaled, Loneswan admires greatly!”

“This ... Lord Loneswan, an exalted Empyrean, actually paid such solemn respects to a True God Realm boy?”

“Shocking! Too shocking! I originally thought that Lord Loneswan’s alchemy cultivation already reached the acme of perfection. Who knew that Master Ji’s alchemy strength is more than a hundred times stronger than Lord Loneswan!”

... ...

In Skyreturn Plaza, astonished voices rose and ebbed like waves.

A dignified Seven-star Alchemy God actually carried out the etiquette of a disciple to a Six-star Alchemy God. How could it not make people marvel?

These martial artists were not versed in alchemy and did not understand the disparity between Empyrean Loneswan and Ye Yuan.

But as an alchemist, Empyrean Loneswan understood that the disparity between him and Ye Yuan was too big!

People should not look at how he was a Seven-star Alchemy God. The rank seven divine pills that he could refine were very limited.

When rank seven divine pills reached level three difficulty and above, one could not refine them at all if their realm was lacking.

Hence, when he saw that Ye Yuan had such strength, he was immediately shocked beyond words.

As for Song Cao and the rest, they had long turned to stone on the spot. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Their godlike master was actually defeated just like this?

How could this brat-like young man have such terrifying alchemy strength?

“This ... Loneswan has many questions on alchemy. I wonder if Master Ji has spare time to give Loneswan a pointer or two?” Empyrean Loneswan asked carefully.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “The Northernmost Steppe’s Alchemy Dao is behind the times. Coming here, this Ji will just take it as giving you a fortuitous encounter.”

The moment Empyrean Loneswan heard, he could not help being overjoyed.

If there were no accidents, his accomplishments in alchemy would just be like that for life.

But if there was someone giving guidance, especially the guidance of a master like Ye Yuan, that would be totally different.

“Many thanks, Master Ji, for showing pity! Loneswan can’t repay it even with ten thousand deaths!” Loneswan was incredibly agitated and gave another respectful bow toward Ye Yuan.

Finished saying, he straightened his back and immediately recovered his Empyrean’s majesty as he said in a clear voice, “From today onward, Master Ji is this Empyrean’s distinguished guest. If anyone dares to offend Master Ji, it’s setting yourself against this Empyrean!”
