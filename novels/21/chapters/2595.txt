Chapter 2601: Changsun Xingyu

“I, Resplendent Sun’s number two, He Yunxiang, am willing to submit to Your Excellency!”

He Yunxiang arrived in front of Ye Yuan and gave a deep bow, uttering words that shocked everyone.

Di Xing was immediately stupefied on the spot!

He thought that He Yunxiang went to find Ye Yuan to fight it out. But who knew that he actually yielded right away!

Big Brother, have some backbone, alright?

You’re number two at any rate!

Sure enough, with his sentence, the entire city exploded.

“Is there a mistake? He Yunxiang actually … directly submitted?”

“Shouldn’t need to go so far, right? Although that boy won, he won with great difficulty! It’s impossible for He Yunxiang to not even be able to beat the few of them.”

“He Yunxiang admitted defeat. Doesn’t that mean that that boy is going to directly face off against Changsun Xingyu?”

… …

They did not dare to believe it. He Yunxiang actually did not have any backbone at all, directly conceding defeat before even fighting.

In their view, Ye Yuan was so arrogant, Di Xing and He Yunxiang should not have let him go.

In fact, the two people joining hands was also not impossible.

Expectedly, he actually yielded.

Ye Yuan looked at He Yunxiang and said coolly, “Your strength isn’t weak. Don’t you want to have a match?”

He Yunxiang said, “This He’s strength isn’t weak, but I know that Your Excellency didn’t use your full strength!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Who’s number one?”

He Yunxiang was taken aback and said, “Changsun Xingyu!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Three days later, if Changsun Xingyu doesn’t show up, you go and tear down the City Lord Manor!”

He Yunxiang’s expression changed, a hint of surprise flashing across in his heart.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan saw through his plan with one glance!

Indeed, he dreaded Ye Yuan a lot.

But he directly submitted because he still had other plans.

He planned on making use of Ye Yuan to go and deal with Changsun Xingyu.

If Ye Yuan won, there would naturally be nothing wrong with his surrender.

If he lost, it would not have been much of a loss to him.

But Ye Yuan had clearly seen through his thoughts.

Ye Yuan made him go and tear down the City Lord Manor. It was to make him go and be the vanguard.

Once he really made a move, that would be tantamount to losing all decorum.

He Yunxiang completely did not expect that this sect disciple who looked very inexperienced would actually be so experienced and cunning.

“This … I obey your order!” He Yunxiang hesitated for a bit but still agreed.

He kept having a feeling, when he faced Ye Yuan, it was like facing Changsun Xingyu back then.

In fact, it was even more terrifying than Changsun Xingyu!

This was the instinct of an expert.

It did not make sense, but it was very accurate!

Just like how Ye Yuan knew that his strength was uncommon without exchanging blows with him, it was the same logic.

Therefore, after hesitating for a moment, He Yunxiang still chose to submit to Ye Yuan.

But when his actions and conduct landed in Di Xing’s eyes, it shook his heart greatly.

He was just surprised for a moment just now, and then he understood He Yunxiang’s goal.

But who knew that after Ye Yuan compelled, He Yunxiang still chose to submit!

This was too surprising!

Could it be that this guy was really so formidable? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After repeated hesitation, Di Xing also came before Ye Yuan and said with clasped hands, “Resplendent Sun City’s number three, Di Xing, is willing to submit to Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly,?“Mn,?since you chose to submit too, you should go together with He Yunxiang then.”

The corners of Di Xing’s mouth twitched slightly, but he still answered, “Yes!”

With these three people taking the lead, how could the others in the top 100 dare to not submit?

Those people came out one after another, expressing their surrender to Ye Yuan.

Everyone fell into shock.

This sect disciple came to Resplendent Sun City for less than half a day and completely brought 99 out of the top 100 people into submission.

This kind of strength truly took people’s breath away in astonishment!

One had to know, the powerhouses of the Land of Exile were not born so powerful.

They only gradually became stronger in the midst of countless life and death battles.

But the moment Ye Yuan entered, he was already strong to such an extent?

Then how great was his potential?

Three days passed in a flash.

Ye Yuan waited for three days, but Changsun Xingyu did not arrive.

Then, he could only go and find himself.

Words that were said and water that was spilled naturally could not be taken back.

“Changsun Xingyu has already not made a move for ten years! Ten years ago, ten of me added together wouldn’t even be his match! As for how strong he is now, nobody knows! Your Excellency, do you really want to challenge him?” He Yunxiang said with a solemn expression.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s not to challenge him. It’s that those who don’t submit, kill!”

He came to conquer the first level of the Land of Exile!

The people who were exiled here all had ways of seeking death.

Ye Yuan already gave the chance. Since Changsun Xingyu did not know how to cherish, then he would not be courteous.

While the expressions of He Yunxiang and the rest turned somber and did not dare to say anything.

City Lord Manor was not luxurious. In reality, in this space where the weak were prey to the strong, people would not pursue luxury.

What they pursued was ultimate power.

Because these people all understood that luxury would only make them go downhill.

Even this Resplendent Sun City’s number one person could not slack off in the slightest too.

Otherwise, they would be replaced by others very soon.

“He Yunxiang, Di Xing!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

These two people were full of unwillingness. But at this time, it was already not up to them anymore.

If they did not make a move, it would be fighting.

But the consequences of battle would have to be borne by themselves.

The two exchanged a glance and made a move at the same time!

The two people each unleashed a palm, the commotion was extremely shocking.

Even a hint of appreciation flashed across in Ye Yuan’s eyes too.

But right at this time, a palm wind fluttered out of the City Lord Manor, directly clashing with He Yunxiang two people.

Boom!

The two people spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, figures flying out backward.

A young man in a blue shirt stood with his hands behind his back and walked out of the City Lord Manor.

A hint of astonishment was revealed in He Yunxiang two people’s eyes.

“Changsun Xingyu! This guy became significantly stronger again than ten years ago!” Di Xing said.

He Yunxiang clutched his chest and said in a solemn voice, “The ten great city lords will have a Dao debate every year! Only they themselves know who won and who lost! Looks like Changsun Xingyu improved significantly in these ten years!”

The ten great city lords were this Land of Exile’s first level’s overlords.

They already had no opponents.

Sparring with the people below was just a waste of time.

Hence, among these ten great city lords, they would host a Dao debate every year.

But this Dao debate would never be made public.

How terrifying these ten people’s strength was, only they themselves knew.

Looking at it now, this Changsun Xingyu’s strength was more than a magnitude stronger again than ten years ago.

Repelling two powerhouses with a palm!

This strength, probably even 30 He Yunxiangs would not be a match anymore as well.

Changsun Xingyu strolled out and said coolly, “Boy, your talent is pretty good! I gave you the chance. Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk; hell has no gate, yet you want to barge inside! Since you’re courting death, then I can’t be blamed.”

There was a confidence that considered everything and everyone beneath his notice on Changsun Xingyu’s face.

As the city lord, with such a major thing happening in the city, it was naturally impossible for him to not know.

But him not coming already showed an attitude.

He was disdainful to take action against Ye Yuan.

Or should he say, Ye Yuan was not worthy of making him take action!

But Ye Yuan launching an attack on the City Lord Manor was another matter altogether.

Ye Yuan looked at Changsun Xingyu and said coolly, “Is that so? These words were precisely what I was going to say to you.”
