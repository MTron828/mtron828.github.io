1416 Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Frui

“Lord Ye Yuan? He ... Although his strength is powerful, it doesn’t reach Heaven Glimpse Realm either, right?” Bai Chen said with some doubt.

In this struggle for the position of palace lord, without Heaven Glimpse Realm strength, it was impossible to speak any further.

The old palace lord’s death was too sudden and had yet to hand over authority to Bai Chen in time. Hence, there was not a single Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse currently standing on his side!

The only one that he could rely on now was Mo Yun.

In the Wilderness Forest, the strength that Ye Yuan displayed was indeed incredible.

But the realm that he exhibited was only grand completion Grotto Profound.

One could only say that his Sword Dao laws comprehension was exceedingly high. But facing genuine Heavenly Dao powerhouses, it was still inadequate to look at. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In front of Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouses, Grotto Profound martial artists were not enough to look at at all!

Mo Yun said, “I don’t know. But I have a feeling that this Lord Ye Yuan isn’t as simple as he seems on the surface! Perhaps, he was sent by heaven to save us! Young Lord, I know that the old palace lord’s death is a huge blow to you, but you must pull it together right now! The old palace lord is already no longer around. If even his foundation is lost, we’d really have no face to face him in the future.”

Bai Chen’s expression became stern, finally forcefully rousing his spirit.

“Okay, I’ll go and find Lord Ye Yuan! I ... What should I do?”

Mo Yun said without the slightest hesitation, “Acknowledge him as your master!”

Bai Chen was stunned and said, “Acknowledge him as my master? Then what about you?”

Mo Yun smiled and said, “I already don’t have anything that I can teach you. But Lord Ye Yuan is different! His understanding of Dao is far above mine! If you can acknowledge him as your master, your future is limitless!”

...

At the place Ye Yuan was staying at, Bai Chen’s entire person appeared rather overcautious.

“Lord Ye Yuan, I wonder if your rest yesterday was still well?” Bai Chen rubbed the sweat on the palm of his hands, seeming somewhat nervous and uneasy.

“Still alright. Didn’t have time to speak to you yesterday either, uh ... my condolences,” Ye Yuan said.

Hearing these words, Bai Chen’s heart became sour, nearly shedding tears.

But, upon thinking of Teacher Mo Yun’s instructions, he forcefully suppressed the grief in his heart and forced a smile as he said, “Many thanks, Lord Ye Yuan! Originally wanted to invite Lord Ye Yuan to be a guest, didn’t expect that the family suddenly suffered a sudden turn of events. Truly ... sorry.”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Whatever you have, just say it. I don’t like to beat around the bush.”

Bai Chen’s bit of shrewdness was not enough to look at in front of Ye Yuan at all. He was seen through by Ye Yuan with one glance.

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled. He discovered that the things Teacher Mo Yun taught were of no use at all.

With this, sorrow hit him, and Bai Chen knelt down with a thud.

“Lord Ye Yuan, Bai Chen is already forced into a dead end. Your Excellency please take pity and save me! This Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit was given to me by Father. Originally, it was intended to help me break through to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm. Now, I’m giving it to Your Excellency. I beg Your Excellency to accept me as a disciple and help me ascend to the position of palace lord!” Bai Chen said indignantly.

Ye Yuan maintained composure on the surface, but in his heart, a series of great waves was stirred up.

One of the missions, the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit, he did not expect that it appeared in front of him so easily.

As long as he agreed, he could bring it back to hand in the missions.

According to the records of the mission, the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit was a heaven and earth spiritual fruit. Grand completion Grotto Profound Realm martial artists just had to consume it and they would have a 30% chance of directly breaking through to the Heaven Glimpse Realm.

Half-step Heaven Glimpse martial artists consuming, there was a 60% chance to break through to Heaven Glimpse Realm!

To those powerhouses stuck at this checkpoint, unable to break through, it was undoubtedly a miracle elixir.

Using it to refine a Two-star divine pill, the effects were even more terrifying.

It was just that to Ye Yuan, his goal was not the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit. No matter how good this thing was, he did not care either.

Ye Yuan received the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit and played for a bit, and said with a smile, “Actually, you’re not suitable to be the palace lord. Why is there a need to intentionally get involved in a messy situation?”

Bai Chen was weak and indecisive, his personality too simple. His strength was not powerful also. Becoming the palace, he would be toyed to death by people sooner or later.

This point, Ye Yuan had long understood it.

Bai Chong this kind of person, if it were Ye Yuan, he would have long killed him with a palm, but Bai Chen kept refusing to deal the blow.

Such weak and indecisiveness, it was hard to take on major responsibilities.

Bai Chen gritted his teeth and said, “I ... I can learn! Teacher Mo Yun said, even though Your Excellency is young, your mind is even more mature than his! Furthermore, your Martial Dao comprehensions are exceedingly deep, making me acknowledge you as master no matter what! If ... If you don’t agree, we’ll back out of this struggle for the position of palace lord and go far away henceforth and not come back!”

Ye Yuan paced around, seemingly thinking.

Bai Chen’s current mood was like a well where seven buckets were drawn up and eight dropped down[1].

Suddenly, Ye Yuan put away the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit and said coolly, “I’ll help you take care of this first.”

Bai Chen was stunned, then immediately revealed a look of wild elation and kowtowed toward Ye Yuan. “Disciple Bai Chen, pays respect to Master!”

Ye Yuan took out a small bottle and threw it to Bai Chen, saying, “These things, just take it as master-acknowledging gifts.”

Bai Chen was rather puzzled. He did not recognize these medicinal pills.

“Master, then ... I wonder what this disciple should do next?” Bai Chen consulted.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Go keep vigil for your father properly. Tomorrow ... what should be done should still be done!”

...

Bai Chen left Ye Yuan’s residence with a perplexed look and found Mo Yun.

Ye Yuan’s words left him at a loss.

“How is it? Did Lord Ye Yuan ... agree?” Mo Yun immediately went up to ask when he saw Bai Chen.

Bai Chen nodded his head woodenly and said, “Agreed.”

Mo Yun could not help being overjoyed the moment he heard and said, “Excellent! I indeed didn’t see it wrongly! He definitely has a way to save us! How is it? What instructions did he have?”

Bai Chen repeated Ye Yuan’s words with a puzzled expression and said, “Teacher Mo Yun, what do you think Master Ye Yuan meant?”

Mo Yun was even more overjoyed the moment he heard and said, “You, this child, seriously ... Lord Ye Yuan not saying anything means that he already has a well-thought-out plan! Tomorrow’s discussion, let’s just care about showing up. Leave the rest to him!”

Bai Chen was still somewhat only half understood it. Mo Yun let out a sigh and asked, “That Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit, he accepted it?”

Bai Chen nodded and said, “Yeah, he even gave me a large bottle of medicinal pills as a master-disciple acknowledgment gift.”

As he said, Bai Chen took out the medicinal pills Ye Yuan gave.

Mo Yun received the medicinal pills and examined it in detail. Suddenly, his expression changed drastically.

“This ... This ...”

Bai Chen had a blank look as he said, “What is it, Teacher Mo Yun? Do these medicinal pills have anything wrong?”

Mo Yun looked at him with a complicated expression and only said after a long time: “These medicinal pills ... if I didn’t see wrongly, it should be called Divine Essence Pill! It’s just that ... these medicinal pills’ grade is extremely high. It should reach divine-grade!”

“Divine-grade medicinal pills! The ... The legendary divine-grade medicinal pills?” Bai Chen said in shock.

Due to the limitations of Heavenly Dao, inside ordinary small worlds, it was totally impossible to refine divine-grade medicinal pills.

But the Sky Foothill World continuously had Heavenspan World’s powerhouses entering to train and was not completely ignorant about Heavenspan World’s medicinal pills.

Divine-grade middle-grade, that was the legendary grade!

Mo Yun nodded his head deeply and said with a complicated expression, “Many years ago, the old palace lord had once killed a trial-taker who came from the outside world and obtained this kind of medicinal pills from him!”
