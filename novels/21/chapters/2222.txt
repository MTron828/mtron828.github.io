Chapter 2226: Here You Go

The pitiful Jiu Shang was sold by the two people just like that.

At his very moment, he experienced a suicide method called putting a noose around his own neck.

“Fine lad, it’s you who forced me! Blackfuse, this boy has a massive secret on him!” Inside the black fog, came Jiu Shang’s cold laughter.

Back then at the Immortal Grove World, the enormous mountain that descended from the sky had the aura of the Heavenspan Mountain!

This kind of treasure was absolutely what even those invincible supreme lords would be moved by.

Originally, he had always thought of finding Ye Yuan to take revenge after recovering from his injuries, and then snatch the giant mountain over while he was at it.

But he never thought that the speed of Ye Yuan’s growth would actually be so fast.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan even struck first to gain the advantage, directly rushing for Fiendflame Mountain.

But now, he was about to lose his life, what did he still want this secret for?

Hence, he planned on disclosing this secret fully, and let Blackfuse and the Blood Yama Hall take care of Ye Yuan.

He believed that they would definitely be very interested in this secret.

Hearing this, Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and did not show anything.

Blackfuse had a rather fascinated expression as he asked with a faint smile, “Oh? What secret?”

“He has ...”

Rumble!

Jiu Shang’s words were said halfway when Blackfuse suddenly pointed a finger out.

Dao marks flashed, a terrifying energy undulation leveled the entire mountain to the ground!

A finger move of a Heavenly Emperor was utterly terrifying!

Everyone had their ears perked up, wanting to hear what Jiu Shang had to say.

But who knew that Blackfuse did not give him the chance at all.

However, Blackfuse did not kill Jiu Shang and even left him with one breath.

Jiu Shang’s life, he was naturally saving it for Ye Yuan.

Blackfuse looked toward Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Master Ye became the Second Sage’s Alchemy Dao’s number one person, the Sacrificial Temple’s Second Sage, how can there be no secrets on him?

In this Heavenspan World, of the people who made great achievements, who did not have a great secret on them?

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, Sacred Ancestor High Priest, Medicine Ancestor, these people were bound to shoulder an astonishing secret on them.

But so what?

Even if he, Blackfuse, knew this secret, with the Priest Temple as the backer, could he still dare to do anything to Ye Yuan?

Let alone that there was even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse present in front of him!

It was simply laughable for Jiu Shang to want to use this secret to exchange for his life.

Except, Blackfuse fancied himself clever and was presumptuous.

The secret on Ye Yuan was indeed an incredible secret!

The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain this supreme treasure, its value was simply immeasurable.

Once divulged, Ye Yuan would probably suffer endless pursuit.

However, Ye Yuan was far from concerned.

He calculated that Blackfuse would not give Jiu Shang the chance to speak.

He still had this bit of confidence.

Since Ye Yuan had once used the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain before in front of Jiu Shang, how could he not have something up his sleeves?

This was also one of the reasons why he cooperated with Blackfuse.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said with clasped hands, “Many thanks for Hall Master Blackfuse taking action. It saved me quite a bit of trouble.”

Blackfuse nodded and said, “Since that’s the case, this Heavenly Emperor will leave first. Master Ye, please don’t forget the agreement between us.”

After he was done talking, Blackfuse directly brought the excited-looking fiend race Empyreans and left Fiendflame Mountain.

The human Empyreans all exchanged glances. A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse was sent away just like that?

Second Sage was indeed Second Sage!

“Younger Brother Ye, what to do about these fiend Empyreans?” Empyrean Chaoyuan said.

Ye Yuan swept a glance and said coolly, “Kill them all!”

Hence, a slaughter began.

These fiend Empyreans were more or less related to the besieging of Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove back then.

Killing them was also considered giving an account to Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

Ye Yuan put Jiu Shang away, eradicated Fiendflame Mountain, and completely wiped out the Kanuo lineage that took part in the invasion of the Immortal Grove World back then.

This feud that bedeviled for millions of years was finally completely over.

... ...

Everything settled down, Ye Yuan’s front foot had just returned to Heavenly Eagle and Blackfuse arrived right on his heels.

He came in person!

Coming along with him were also five Seven-star Fiend Apothecaries of the fiend race.

“Brother Blackfuse, you actually came personally!” Ye Yuan said in surprise.

Blackfuse smiled and said, “Master Ye might still be unaware of how precious your medicinal pills are. If this Heavenly Emperor doesn’t come personally, it will probably be robbed halfway! The few of you, why haven’t you offered greetings to Master Ye?”

The five great Empyreans all bowed in salutation and said, “Offering greetings to Master Ye!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, considered to have responded, and said coolly, “I’ll say the nasty things first! The few of you, upon entering my Pill Tower, you’ll have to adhere to my Pill Tower’s rules! Within these 100 years, your life and death are up to me!”

The five people’s expressions turned somber, and they hurriedly complied.

After he was done talking, Ye Yuan turned to Yun Yi beside him and said, “Yun Yi, the five of them will be handed to you, just treat them as the Pill Tower’s ordinary disciples will do.”

Yun Yi bowed and acknowledged. Casually summoning a Celestial Deity Realm youth who was dressed as a medicine boy, he instructed him, “Qin Rui, the five of them will be handed over to you! Within these 100 years, you’ll be responsible for their Alchemy Dao studies.”

“Pffft!” The five people nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

The five of them were late-stage Empyrean mighty experts, Seven-star Fiend Apothecaries.

In the Blood Yama Hall, in the fiend race, which one of them did not have extremely venerated status?

Ye Yuan’s name shook the Southern Border, they were only willing to go under Ye Yuan’s tutelage thanks to his name.

But who knew that arriving at Heavenly Eagle, he actually let a little medicine boy be in charge of their alchemy studies?

Even the Heavenly Emperor Blackfuse by the side also frowned slightly.

Among the five people, the black-faced burly man in the front got up and said with displeasure, “Ye Yuan, what’s the meaning of this? This Empyrean is, at any rate, a Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master too. You’re actually letting a Celestial Deity Realm little medicine boy be in charge of us? We came from thousands of miles away. Are you intentionally humiliating us?”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “Humiliating you all? This Ye doesn’t have that leisure time! Qin Rui, spar with these five seniors.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Rui stepped out of the ranks and said with a bow, “Yes, Grandmaster!”

Done talking, he turned to the five people again and said, “Senior, please teach me!”

The black-faced burly man sneered and said, “Very good! This Empyrean wants to see if, in this Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, even a little medicine boy can teach this Empyrean how to refine pills!”

Half a day later, the five great Empyreans came before Blackfuse with their heads hung in shame.

“Your Excellency, we ... are ashamed!”

Blackfuse was shocked until he stared dumbfounded in amazement. These five people were already his Fiend Medicine Hall’s pinnacle-most Seven-star Fiend Apothecaries. But they were actually devastated by a little medicine boy until their helmets and coats of mail were lost!

Just how profound was this Pill Tower’s strength?

He suddenly somewhat understood why Ye Yuan’s fame would be so resounding.

The fiend race’s alchemy skills did not even count as trash in front of Ye Yuan!

Blackfuse drew a deep breath, reined in his thoughts, and said coolly, “Since that’s the case, you all follow this little master and learn Alchemy Dao properly then!”

The five people no longer had any complaints and nodded in agreement.

A month later, Blackfuse brought several dozens of Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pills and left Heavenly Spiritual Pill Bodhidharma gleefully.

With these several dozens of Tyrant Blood Heavenly Fiend Pills, their branch hall’s strength would soar significantly!

While those five Empyreans stayed at the Pill Tower and became Qin Rui’s little medicine boys.

On the second day Blackfuse left, Ye Yuan brought Jiu Shang and returned to the Immortal Grove World.
