Chapter 1933: Entire City Shocked

“Hall Master Mu Feng actually apologized to Ye Yuan!”

“Truly remarkable! Hall Master Mu Feng is a peak True God Realm peerless powerhouse, and yet he actually apologized to a Celestial Deity Realm junior!”

“What the hell do you know! Ye Yuan utterly defeated Yu Ying, his strength can likely enter alchemy celestial class already. That’s a figure on the same level as Hall Master Mu Feng! Such a figure, it’s not good for Hall Master Mu Feng to offend either. Let alone that this matter was Springwind Hall’s fault in the first place.”

...

The hall master’s action caused a stir in the crowd.

Mu Feng’s position was at that pinnacle-most level in Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital. Other people could not even meet him.

If it were others, even if it was the Springwind Hall’s fault, it was also impossible for him to lower his head and admit fault.

But who knew that he actually admitted fault to a Celestial Deity Realm junior?

“Hall Master ...”

Yu Ying and Jiang Yuan two people turned pale with fright and were just about to speak, but they were stopped by Mu Feng with a gesture.

The two people had ashamed faces, hanging their heads in shame.

The mess was caused by them but needed Hall Master to clean up their mess.

Ye Yuan looked at the fatty and said with a smile, “Whether Elder Yu leaves or not isn’t important to me. But Springwind Hall’s overbearingness, this Ye has had a taste of it. Since Lord Hall Master personally spoke up today, this Ye naturally doesn’t have the reason to pester endlessly. This matter ends here.”

Ye Yuan knew his limitations, he was merely a Celestial Deity Realm junior in the end.

Mu Feng made an apology to him in front of so many people, he naturally could not possibly latch onto Yu Ying and not let go.

It was just that he already had bad blood toward Springwind Hall in his heart. Regarding Mu Feng’s show of goodwill, he did not buy it.

This matter also merely stopped here.

Toward Springwind Hall, Ye Yuan felt disinclined to have any favorable impression.

Regardless of whether it was Jiang Hua or Yu Ying, the impression left on Ye Yuan was really too deep.

The hall master was still all smiles, seemingly taking no notice of Ye Yuan’s attitude as he said smilingly, “Little Friend Ye is broad-minded, Springwind Hall is endlessly grateful. Elder Yu, Elder Jiang, why haven’t you thanked Little Friend Ye?”

When the two heard that, they hurriedly gave a bow.

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly, considered to have answered.

No one could have expected that a huge conflict was resolved just like that.

Let alone did they imagine that a colossal Springwind Hall actually apologized to a Celestial Deity Realm!

Ye Yuan and Yu Ying’s battle spread throughout the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion at the fastest speed. It even spread throughout Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital.

After that, Ye Yuan’s background was already dug out.

The entire city was shocked!

Previously, there were many conjectures about Ye Yuan.

Some said that he came from some Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda, some said that he came from a reclusive great family. Some even said that he was linked in many ways to Medicine Ancestor.

It was just that no one thought that Ye Yuan merely came from a measly little imperial city.

Digging further, he even only came out of a tiny little county!

An alchemist without the slightest background only used a short thousand over years to one-shot a blackscale alchemist. This talent simply startled heaven and earth and even made gods and ghosts weep.

For some time, Ye Yuan became the target that countless alchemists looked up to.

In the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, several alchemy celestial class powerhouses were similarly incomparably shocked. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Especially Chen Chang, he already did not know what kind of words to use to describe the shock in his heart.

“Could it be that that Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill was really refined by him? A Five-star Alchemy God refining a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, this ... How is this possible?” Chen Chang felt that his brain could not quite wrap itself around it.

Although there were faintly some guesses previously, he actually did not really believe it.

Firstly, Ye Yuan’s performance in the darkviolet arena gradually leveled out. Secondly, this sort of thing was too fantastical.

But Ye Yuan refined a level eight medicinal pill now, and he even actually refined a vast spirit divine-grade. Then reaching divine-grade for level nine difficulty did not seem to be something hard to comprehend.

A hint of surprise flashed across in Chen Yu’s gaze as he said, “In that case, he already has the qualifications to enter the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion! Most likely, in regards to the refinement of rank five divine pills, we’re not a match for him!”

When the few people heard that, they all exchanged glances.

Divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, which of them could refine it in one stroke?

Unless it was like a blind cat bumping into a dead rat, otherwise, there was no chance at all.

But Ye Yuan refined one!

A Five-star Alchemy Celestial Pavilion entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, they felt that it was very strange no matter how they thought about it.

Chen Chang was speechless. Recalling back then at the Hundred Herb Gathering, he even urged Ye Yuan with sincere words and earnest wishes, it was really laughable to the extreme.

He discovered that Ye Yuan did not have the impulsiveness that he should have at this age, but appeared extremely modest instead.

If it were a young man who had Ye Yuan’s talent being wronged by someone who said that the medicinal pill was not refined by him, they would have long exploded.

But Ye Yuan did not!

Not only did he not, he even accepted his suggestion very humbly.

If Ye Yuan confronted him back then and refined pills in front of everyone, then his old face would really have nowhere to put.

Recalling it now, Chen Chang was actually full of gratitude and admiration towards Ye Yuan in his heart.

Young in age, but had such breadth of mind, this was not what ordinary people could do.

“Huhu, Alchemy Celestial Pavilion hasn’t added new members in 100 thousand years already, right? It’s also time that a new member joins. Ye Yuan entering the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion is absolutely an excellent thing to us and to the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion!” Chen Chang said.

Chen Yu also nodded and said, “This boy’s future prospects are limitless. Him joining the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion will only make the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s reputation grow.”

...

Thud!

Jiang Yuan slightly used strength, Jiang Hua knelt in front of Ye Yuan.

“Younger Brother Ye, I’m really sorry about it! It was this Jiang who failed in disciplining and almost caused a catastrophe. Today, I brought this scoundrel in front of you to await your sentencing!” Jiang Yuan cupped his fists and said to Ye Yuan.

That day, after Jiang Hua left the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, he wanted to slink off.

It was just a pity that the Springwind Hall’s power and influence were too great. If they really mobilized the whole hall’s strength to capture a Celestial Deity Realm, how could there be a chance for him to escape?

Several days later, Jiang Hua was captured in a commoner’s house.

Today, Mu Feng and Jiang Yuan escorted Jiang Hua to Joyful Aroma Residence, delivering him in front of Ye Yuan.

Jiang Hua’s eyes were full of despair. He crawled over towards Ye Yuan and kowtowed repeatedly as he said, “Lord Ye Yuan, spare me! It was all this lowly one who had eyes but couldn’t see! It was all this lowly one who had eyes but couldn’t see!”

Ye Yuan looked at Jiang Hua and said coolly, “That day, at the gatehouse, it was originally not a major issue that you blocked me outside the door. If you don’t let me meet Elder Jiang, then I’ll use my own means to meet Elder Jiang. But you never should have made people go and kill me. Since you had killing intent aroused, that’s a situation where one of us has to die. How do you want me to spare you?”

When Jiang Hua heard that, he said with a look of despair, “Lord Ye Yuan, this lowly one knows his mistake! This lowly one really knows his mistake! I beg you to spare this lowly one!”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him and said to Jiang Yuan indifferently, “Elder Jiang, you brought the person over, do with him as you will.”

Jiang Yuan also hated Jiang Hua to the bones and said in a cold voice, “Jiang Hua, I treated you well for so many years, but who knew that you actually repaid kindness with ingratitude! You were so malicious in your motives, nearly causing me to be doomed eternally! Today, if I don’t kill you, it’s hard to dispel this hatred!”

Jiang Hua still wanted to say something when Jiang Yuan smacked a palm toward his head, striking him dead.
