Chapter 2231: Leaving Elegantly

The two people were currently discussing matters regarding the Asura Blood Pool when someone came to visit.

When Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade saw the arrival, he bowed respectfully and said, “Lord Ghostpupil!”

This Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil was also a late-stage Empyrean Ghost Dao powerhouse. His pair of black pupils were incomparably deep and seemed to be able to bewitch the heart.

Ghostpupil nodded slightly and said, “Wild Blade, Lord Vastsea made you bring your young lord to go see him.”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade was taken back, using inquiring eyes to look at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan slowly got up and said coolly, “No need. You pack things up and go with me, I’m in a hurry!”

He was currently burning with anxiety. How could he be in the mood to have small talk with Heavenly Emperor Vastsea?

Delaying a moment longer, Dustless and Mu Lingxue would be in more danger.

In reality, Dustless also would not have fallen into such a deep sleep if not for protecting Mu Lingxue.

Without Dustless protection at the final moment, Mu Lingxue’s final trace of spiritual consciousness would have long been shattered.

These days in Heavenly Eagle, Ye Yuan spent every minute and second in agony.

Now, obtaining the Silvernet Blood Essence’s news, how could he still be willing to delay?

But Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil’s expression changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Human, Lord Vastsea is summoning you. You dare to not give face?”

Ye Yuan did not even look at him and said coolly, “Wild Blade!”

Wild Blade’s expression changed slightly, and he said with a bow, “Yes!”

Ghost Dao powerhouses had those who grew themselves, and also those who were raised like Wild Blade.

Ghost Dao powerhouses who made a contract were unable to defy their master’s orders.

Ye Yuan’s order had even higher authority than a Heavenly Emperor!

Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupils saw that Ye Yuan completely ignored him and could not help saying in a great rage, “Fine lad, Lord Vastsea asking to see you is valuing you! Since you don’t know how to appreciate favors, then don’t blame this Empyrean for not being courteous!”

Suddenly, the air in the house became cold.

A surge of cold wind rose from the ground and tunneled into Ye Yuan’s body.

Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil’s eyes suddenly released a black light. A powerful surge of soul force directly rushed into Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness.

“Beguiling Ghost Melody, heed my command! Brat, slap yourself all the way until this Empyrean calls for you to stop!” Ghostpupil directly ordered.

Seeing Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil use his ultimate move the moment he came up, Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade’s expression changed greatly. He cried out in surprise, “Lord Ghostpupil, show mercy!”

“Snort!”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan released a cold snort from his mouth!

This cold snort, Ye Yuan brought along the Voice of the Dragon God of the dragon race.

“Mm!” Ghostpupil gave a muffled groan and was actually wounded by Ye Yuan’s cold snort, causing even his body to become a lot more illusory.

Although Ghost Dao powerhouses did not have corporeal bodies, reaching Ghost Empyrean Realm, they were already close to being corporeal.

But at this time, Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil was actually forced back into his original form.

“This ... How is this possible?” Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil looked at Ye Yuan with a look of fright, full of disbelief.

The aura on Ye Yuan’s body was not strong. It was at least much weaker than his.

Facing such an opponent, his Beguiling Ghost Melody would work 100 times out of 100 times. If so, why did Ye Yuan’s divine soul being released just like that, and then it could injure him?

Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil was extremely perplexed!

By the side, Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade was also extremely shocked.

He was deeply aware of Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil’s prowess. Even the three great Ghost Empyreans under Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge’s command were extremely apprehensive of him too.

This Beguiling Ghost Melody was extremely restraining toward same rank Empyreans too, but it was shaken off by Ye Yuan so easily.

Not only shaken off, he even severely wounded Empyrean Ghostpupil!

How could Young Master’s strength be so horrifying?

Ye Yuan looked at Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil and said with disdain, “Even the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest are unable to control my will. Just with the likes of your paltry ghost path mystic art, you want to control me? Do you know what’s called overestimating your own ability?”

Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil had a face that was struck dumb with amazement!

With Ye Yuan’s snort earlier, he indeed felt a willpower like beholding a great mountain hit him head-on.

It was precisely because of this that he was easily injured.

How could a mere human Empyrean Realm have such a formidable will?

Although Ye Yuan talked about whatever Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest, he felt that it was overly boastful. But Ghost Empyrean Ghostpupil dared to confirm that Ye Yuan’s will was absolutely stronger than Heavenly Emperor Vastsea!

Furthermore, it was more than a magnitude stronger!

The shock in his heart was unable to use words to describe.

“Wild Blade!” Ye Yuan urged lightly. Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade suddenly startled awake and hurriedly packed up and got everything ready.

Ye Yuan brought Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade and swaggered out of Vast Huai Manor just like that.

But right at this time, a sinister to the extreme ghost aura descended from the sky. A virtually corporeal figure blocked in front of Ye Yuan.

This ghostly energy was extremely condensed. If an ordinary human Empyrean was here, they would likely have long been frozen stiff.

Inside Yin Huai Manor, a hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge’s mouth.

“Heh, Vastsea that fool probably still doesn’t know this boy’s terror! Losing face in front of so many people in the city, this emperor will see how you still have the face to show yourself in the future!”

The events previously, he issued a gag order to the powerhouses in the manor, absolutely forbidding for anyone to spread it.

This boy was like a thorn. Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge felt that he definitely would not be used by Heavenly Emperor Vastsea.

Sure enough, in less than half a day, both parties fell out.

Heavenly Emperor Vastsea looked at Ye Yuan and said with a thunderous look, “Human brat, you brought away this Heavenly Emperor’s subordinate. Not only did you not even inform in advance, you even seriously injured this Heavenly Emperor’s subordinate! How do you plead?”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade’s complexion was ashen as he cried out in surprise, “Lord Vastsea, Young Master he ...”

Ye Yuan stopped Wild Blade with a hand gesture. Looking at Vastsea, he said coolly, “Uh, since you came, then I’ll inform you about it. Wild Blade will be following me in the future. Say your goodbyes. Wild Blade, let’s go!”

A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse moving out had long already alarmed numerous powerhouses in the city. Mo Sha and his companions just happened to be among them too.

Seeing this scene, the pupils of the ghosts shrunk.

This fellow was so arrogant!

What he was facing was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

“Could this human brat really be a fool? That’s Heavenly Emperor Vastsea! Yet he’s actually this arrogant?”

“Isn’t that so? Just nice. I can take a look at what he’s relying on to be able to bring away Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade from Yin Huai Manor this time!”

“Heh heh, I somewhat understand now! Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge probably intentionally didn’t show up to let this kid bring away Wild Blade!”

... ...

Heavenly Emperor Vastsea laughed from extreme fury and said, “Heh heh, what an arrogant brat, could it be that you really take this Heavenly Emperor to not dare to make a move against you? Forget it, since you’re intentionally courting death, this Heavenly Emperor will send you off then!”

“Immobilize!”

Heavenly Emperor Vastsea’s voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan already executed Time Freeze!

In an instant, laws descended, Vastsea was immobilized!

Back then, when Ye Yuan was still only initial-stage rank seven, he could already use this move and escape from under the hands of abyss monster Heavenly Emperor Manya.

Let alone that he was currently already middle-stage rank seven.

How much stronger was the power of the present Time Freeze compared to that time?

“Wild Blade, go!” Ye Yuan grabbed the dumbfounded Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade and directly teleported more than ten thousand miles away.

After an instant, space-time recovered. Heavenly Emperor Vastsea’s eyes were full of shock.

“Heavenly Dao True Word, spatial law! What a terrific human lad! Looks like Wild Blade followed a good master!”
