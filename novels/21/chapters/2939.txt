Chapter 2938: This Guy is Too Wicked!

“This … He didn’t even die with this?”

“Could it be that what he awakened is really the Imperishable Soul Physique?”

“This is embarrassing! Feng Rui’s strength is clearly stronger than him, but the stronger he is, the more it proves that Ye Yuan has the Imperishable Soul Physique!”

… …

In the Nirvana Soul Hall, everyone was shocked.

They did not know whether or not Ye Yuan was of the Imperishable Soul Physique.

But, judging from things now, it was at least not some lowly Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique.

“Bullsh*t Imperishable Soul Physique! Just the likes of you, this kind of trash, can awaken the Imperishable Soul Physique too?”

Feng Rui’s gaze turned cold. He felt immense humiliation!

Hence, the Divine Firmament Thunder God Blade was unleashed again!

Under this Divine Firmament Thunder God Blade, Ye Yuan really did not have any strength to resist.

Soul physique awakening was just the first step.

How one cultivated and how one utilized soul physique were the most important thing.

Similarly having awakened a soul physique, the combat power might be very far off.

Ye Yuan cultivated the Divine Emergence, but Feng Rui’s strength was absolutely considered within the most pinnacle batch among lower Emperor Cloud Heavens.

His application and cultivation of his soul physique already reached the acme of perfection.

Even if facing off against middle or even upper Emperor Cloud Heavens, he was not at all inferior too!

One could tell that Cloudneon indulged Feng Rui a lot.

To be pampered by such a powerhouse, he naturally had some skill!

If Ye Yuan crossed Emperor Realm this threshold, he could abuse him however he liked.

But now, he was indeed not a match!

Boom!

Under the one blade, it directly chopped Ye Yuan into misty air.

Feng Rui shouted fiercely, “Chaos Divine Lightning, destroying heaven and earth! Exterminate for me!”

Above the void, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled!

This time, Feng Rui’s Chaos Divine Lightning had even more terrifying power than the Allheaven Divine Lightning seat previously.

Places that it passed through, not a blade of grass survived!

Very soon, the mist was eradicated until not the slightest bit remained.

Feng Rui’s gaze was cold, looking at his surroundings vigilantly, searching for Ye Yuan’s figure again.

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not revive, Feng Rui could not help letting out a sigh in relief.

“Humph!?What rubbish Imperishable Soul Physique! It’s merely that he didn’t die thoroughly enough! If you revived again, this young hegemon will kill you again!” Feng Rui said with a cold smile.

However, in the next second, a cloud of mist appeared several dozen feet in front of him once more, condensing into Ye Yuan in the end.

Feng Rui’s eyes became wide-saucers.

This guy definitely did it on purpose!

He waited for him to finish posturing before reviving again to slap his face!

You … F*ck you!

“Oh,?is that so? Looks like this time, “Search our n?wn0?el.?rg”I still haven’t died thoroughly enough yet! I’ll have to trouble Young Hegemon Feng to kill me once more!” Ye Yuan looked at Feng Rui and said with a radiant smile.

He was already very certain that even if Feng Rui was a hundred times stronger, he could not kill him too!

Ye Yuan did not know whether or not he had the Imperishable Soul Physique, but he knew that his soul physique was indeed not easy to kill.

At least, Feng Rui did not have this ability!

Ye Yuan even discovered that his revival seemed to be able to borrow the power of heaven and earth and would not consume his own soul force.

It was as if he had fused into one with this world.

Also, Feng Rui guessed correctly. Ye Yuan deliberately waited for him to posture, then revived.

Feng Rui only felt his face burn fiery hot.

He was a genius. He awakened the Innate Five Lightning Soul Physique and succeeded in cultivating the five kinds of lightning techniques!

Furthermore, this five lightning technique placed the soul race immensely in the first place. It was simply ever-victorious in the soul race.

But today, he was being mocked by an ant!

Feng Rui’s gaze turned chilly, and he said in a cold voice, “You’re asking for it. Don’t blame this young hegemon for not showing mercy!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said with a smile,?“Mn,?an opponent like you is really hard to find! Since you’ve delivered yourself to the doorstep, where’s the logic of not using it? Now, I’m also very curious myself, where my own limits lie.”

Feng Rui gave a cold snort, five divine lightnings tearing across the air!

In an instant, a radius of a thousand feet was fully transformed into a lightning sea.

It was just that similarly a lightning sea, but the power of the lightning sea that was fused and formed by five lightnings was more than ten times stronger!

Five lightnings interwoven together, continuously reproducing in an endless succession, forming a powerful closed loop.

In this space, he, Feng Rui, was a Hegemon!

“Five Lightning Execution, destroying myriad worlds!”

Ye Yuan’s soul body turned to dust virtually without any strength to fight back, and then it was completely refined.

But this time, Feng Rui did not withdraw the lightning sea right away.

This lightning sea lasted all the way for two hours!

No matter how formidable Ye Yuan was, it was also impossible to survive!

Two hours later, Feng Rui recalled the lightning sea somewhat weakly.

This Five Lightning Execution clearly imposed a considerable burden on him too.

Sustaining for two hours, even with his Emperor Cloud Heaven soul body, it was somewhat too much for him to bear as well.

However, in order to completely kill Ye Yuan, he went all out!

Even if he went back and recuperated for a few months, he was willing too!

A mere ant dared to provoke Feng Rui. Did he really think that he had the Imperishable Soul Physique?

Even until now, Feng Rui did not believe that Ye Yuan had the Imperishable Soul Physique too.

He was different from Great Emperor Eastsun and the others. As an Imperishable Soul Domain’s genius, he was all too clear how difficult the Imperishable Soul Physique was to awaken.

This time, Feng Rui was not in a hurry to posture anymore but quietly waited.

The others did not speak either. They just looked at him in terror like that.

The combat power that Feng Rui exhibited frightened them badly.

Lower Emperor Cloud Heaven, this sort of strength was sufficient to sweep away Emperor Cloud Heavens in the outside world! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Even if it was grand completion Emperor Cloud Heaven, in this Five Lightning Execution, there was only a road that led to death too!

Sure enough, the outside world and the Imperishable Soul Domain were two different worlds!

At this time, the place was silent.

Everyone was waiting whether or not Ye Yuan would revive again.

Cloudneon was waiting too!

Honestly speaking, she was also very curious just how Ye Yuan revived.

But at this time, she was already very sure that Ye Yuan soul physique was not ordinary.

Even if it was not the Imperishable Soul Physique, it probably reached heaven rank too!

She was all too clear about Feng Rui’s strength.

Not everyone had the qualifications to toy with him!

One breath, two breaths …

Very soon, 15 minutes passed.

Feng Rui just stood there, waiting for a full 15 minutes

During these 15 minutes, nobody spoke.

Even if a gust of wind blew past, everyone held their breaths, seeing whether or not it was Ye Yuan who revived.

However, he did not!

Suddenly Feng Rui raised his head to the sky and said with a loud laughter,?“Hahaha?… Like I said, how can a second Imperishable Soul Physique possibly appear in this world? Ye Yuan, don’t you know how to revive? Revive for me to see!”

Not knowing why, Feng Rui actually felt a great sense of accomplishment in being able to kill Ye Yuan.

He detested this kind of feeling, but his heart could not contain it!

However, just as he looked up to the sky, a strange atmosphere spread within the place.

A cloud of misty air appeared again leisurely.

Everyone looked at Feng Rui with strange expressions.

“Pfft!”?Many people could not even hold back their laughter.

Ye Yuan, this fellow, was too wicked!

He forcibly held it in for 15 minutes without reviving, just waiting for Feng Rui to posture.

However, it seemed like this feeling of face-slapping was great!

After all, Ye Yuan came from our Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall, no?
