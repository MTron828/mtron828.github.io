Seeing the token that Ye Yuan flashed, Xiao Shan’s entire body trembled, his eyes revealing a look of disbelief.

“Great Commander Token! How … How do you have this?” Xiao Shan said in shock.

Although Xiao Shan was questioning it, the ‘Ye’ word engraved on the token, as well as the unique aura emitting from the token, could not be faked.

Regarding the northern front army, not counting Emperor level powerhouses, the highest commander was Ming Yi this commander-in-chief.

And below him were the five grand completion True Sovereign Heaven great commanders

Below great commanders, True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were all commander level.

Each person had a corresponding token.

Now, Ye Yuan actually took out a great commander token. The shock in Xiao Shan’s heart could be imagined.

‘There were only five of these tokens!

Furthermore, their holders were all grand completion True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

Where did Ye Yuan get it?

“Emperor Dan Fei conferred the great commander token and let me lead the northern front army’s heavenly alchemist division! Commander Xiao, I wonder if … this Ye has the authority to meddle in this army’s affairs?” Ye Yuan looked at Xiao Shan and said it word by word.

Everyone present was in an uproar!

Meanwhile, Xiao Shan’s pupils constricted, having a look of astonishment in his eyes.

This great commander token was actually personally bestowed by Emperor Dan Fei!

Emperor Dan Fei was the supreme commander of the northern battlefront in the truest sense!

Normally, his movements and traces were elusive and secretive.

The Saint Sovereign Heaven army’s battles were actually on the outer-periphery too.

‘The true core regions were the great battles of these Emperor level powerhouses.

That level of fight could be said to startle heaven and shock the earth.

Logically speaking, Commander-in-chief Ming Yi himself already had the qualifications to confer great commander.

But the heavenly alchemist division did not have a great commander. It had always been Xiao Shan in charge of it.

Xiao Shan’s strength was lacking, and he could not be a great commander either.

But who could have thought that Emperor Dan Fei actually personally intervened in the affairs of the army and bestowed the great commander token upon Ye Yuan!

Didn’t this mean that Ye Yuan directly became his, Xiao Shan’s, superior?

This sort of thing was too comical!

A measly little grade five heavenly alchemist actually became the immediate superior of him, a grade six heavenly alchemist?

But, something that Emperor Dan Fei personally concerned himself with, who could refute it?

The likes of Xiao Shan and Dao Chen had always been calling Ye Yuan’s identity into question before. Now, it was good. Not only did Ye Yuan become a member of the army, but he also even became the great commander of the northern front army’s heavenly alchemist division!

Could he not meddle?

He could meddle too well!

The heavenly alchemist division’s great commander was just nice in charge of all the heavenly alchemists present, including Xiao Shan!

It was unbelievably appropriate!

Actually, Xiao Shan’s arrest of Zhao Chen was somewhat unjustifiable.

After all, Zhao Chen was not his direct subordinate.

But the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples were used to normally being domineering. Coupled with Xiao Shan’s status as commander, he was the heavenly alchemist division’s great commander in practice.

Even Zhao Chen’s superiors would not intercede for him too.

But now, things were different.

If Commander Xiao has any doubts, you can go and ask Commander-in-chief Ming Yi!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“No need! This token can’t be faked!” Xiao Shan said in a solemn voice.

He had never felt so aggrieved before!

‘As one of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s grade six heavenly alchemists, his status in the army was extremely respected.

Even True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses had to beg him for help too.

But now, he was actually being suppressed by a grade five heavenly alchemist. How could he not be gloomy?

Ye Yuan naturally did not care about Xiao Shan’s attitude. He said lightly, “Then can this great commander meddle in the army’s affairs?”

“You can!” Xiao Shan said in a muffled voice.

But these words were like a clap of thunder when they landed in Zhang Xiu’s ears, instantly stunning him.

‘What was the meaning of this?

Not caring about him anymore?

That Ye Yuan was assuming a new official post, he would definitely be the first to bear the brunt!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Since I can meddle, then this great commander will say a few more words here! In this army, the brothers with sects and factions are probably not in the minority! The Hegemon level sects in this Heaven One Continent are also not just your Extreme Medicine Sect alone! The Extreme

Medicine Sect has indeed rendered great contributions in resisting the blood race, but which of the brothers fighting on the battlefield doesn’t have credit? The other Hegemon level sects have no credit? Or is it that the Saint Sovereign Heavens that came from Hegemon level sects have a higher status

than those small sects?”

“If that’s the case, our side has already established factions. How will this war still be fought? After entering the army, everyone is a fellow officer brother! Heavenly alchemists are a member of the army too! Everyone has parents and were raised by them. Who’s more valuable than others? You’re a Saint

Sovereign Heaven, but isn’t he also a Saint Sovereign Heaven? If you have the ability, try breaking through to True Sovereign Heaven!”

“With the army being defeated this time, the Extreme Medicine Sect can’t absolve yourselves from the blame! Nobody is investigating you guys precisely because the Extreme Medicine Sect has made great contributions! But committing mistakes is committing mistakes. We can’t talk about it? Said a few

words about you, and he has to get punished by military law? Xiao Shan, then how will you be dealt with for rebutting me, this great commander? Dao Chen, you’re merely a grade five heavenly alchemist. How should you be dealt with for talking back to me, this great commander?”

Xiao Shan’s face turned black, and he was immediately choked until he could not speak.

You’re freaking sneak attacking me!

Clearly had the great commander token long ago, but you didn’t take it out!

As for Dao Chen, his face even became ashen.

Actually, it was really not that Ye Yuan ambushed him.

After coming out from Dan Fei there, Ming Yi still had important military affairs to discuss, so he stayed behind and casually instructed his subordinates to bring Ye Yuan to diagnose and treat the soldiers.

Ye Yuan was not someone who showed off either. He naturally would not take out his great commander token.

If not for the Extreme Medicine Sect pressing people too far, he really would not care for taking out the great commander token.

Talready crushed you in Alchemy Dao. What did I still need some great commander token for?

“Let him go!” Ye Yuan said to the two attendant soldiers coldly.

The two attendant soldiers were at a loss on what to do and looked toward Xiao Shan.

Xiao Shan waved his hand, indicating for them to let go. Only then did they behave like they were granted amnesty.

It was so uncomfortable to be caught between Great Commander and Commander!

‘When Zhao Chen was released, his two eyes were emitting light.

He also did not expect that Master Ye actually performed an unexpected reversal, slapping the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples’ faces resoundingly!

In reality, after returning from the big defeat this time, they really felt aggrieved to the extreme.

It was clearly a man-made disaster, but they could not say it out loud.

The Extreme Medicine Sect’s prestige in their hearts fell to rock-bottom all at once.

Now, Ye Yuan saying it out in front of everyone, they felt much more liberated.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan shouted coldly, “Zhao Chen, take Zhang Xiu down for me!”

Zhao Chen’s entire body trembled, immediately stepping forward and arresting Zhang Xiu.

Zhang Xiu yelled, “Martial Uncle Xiao Shan, save me!”

Xiao Shan had a sullen face as he said in a cold voice, “Great Commander, do you really have to do this? My Extreme Medicine Sect’s face isn’t easy to slap! You’ve just arrived and might not know it yet. Among the Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses that came this time, there’s also my Extreme Medicine

Sect’s ancestor!”

The Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses were naturally not just Dan Fei alone.

It was just that he was the strongest.

However, Ye Yuan did not buy it and just said coolly, “Military orders can’t be disobeyed! Today, if I don’t kill people, you guys won’t know the preciousness of human life! Our comrades aren’t for people to use as experiments! Zhao Chen, haul him out and kill him!”
