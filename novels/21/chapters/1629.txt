Chapter 1633 Dogfigh

ka suo was very depressed. if other origin deity realm powerhouses dared to speak to him like this, he would definitely laugh it over.

this kind of trash could forget about posing the least bit of threat to him in their lifetimes.

but ye yuan was different!

this boy’s talent was too great. furthermore, his combat strength was heaven-defying. being at the origin deity realm, he already had the strength comparable to a first-layered heaven divine lord.

once such a person grew up, the threat to him was too big!

“however, even though killing you right now is somewhat forceful, making you suffer some hardship is still achievable.”

ye yuan grinned as he said this, smiling until ka suo shuddered.

“you ... what do you want to do? a measly origin deity realm trash wants to cause harm to this seat?” ka suo’s expression changed in a threatening manner, but inwardly he was shaky.

ye yuan’s finger moved, a silver needle suddenly appearing on his fingertips.

this silver needle was shockingly a divine lord mystic treasure!

he looked at ka suo and said with a smile that was not a smile, “heh, measly origin deity realm? you have to know, this little lord is heavenly eagle imperial city’s pill tower elder! see this silver needle? this silver needle has rank three bone eroding heavenly fiend tears tempered on it. this thing ... don’t tell me that you never heard before?”

ka suo’s gaze turned intent, his aura weakened, almost getting crushed to the ground by the forcefield.

“you ... how do you know how to refine this kind of thing?” ka suo said in horror.

bone eroding heavenly fiend tears was a strong poison that targeted the fiend race. it was incomparably powerful.

one drop of rank five bone eroding heavenly fiend tears was enough for him, this celestial deity powerhouse, to die a hundred times over!

although rank three bone eroding heavenly fiend tears could not poison him to death, it was plenty for him to suffer.

especially under this kind of state, once he was poisoned, he would definitely get incomparably weak. at that time, no need for ye yuan to make a move, he would also be crushed by the origin magnetic field.

if what ye yuan held in his hand was a celestial deity artifact, he would not care at all. because celestial deity artifacts could not breach his defenses at all!

however, what ye yuan held in his hand was a divine lord mystic treasure!

this was deadly!

looking at the silver needle on ye yuan’s hand swaying back and forth in front of him, ka suo finally broke down.

swoosh!

ka suo unleashed all of his strength, rushing out like an arrow leaving the string.

as he walked away, ka suo spurted fresh blood wildly, his entire person unbelievably weak under the suppression of the origin magnetic field.

rumble ...

sprinting a distance of 3000 feet in one go, ka suo finally staggered, falling heavily to the ground.

song yu two people’s faces changed slightly, looking at ye yuan rather fearfully.

sure enough, ye yuan took out another small bottle. the two people immediately felt their hairs stand on end.

no need to ask, inside this little bottle was nothing good as well!

how could they give ye yuan the chance to prick them with the needle? learning from ka suo, they made their move, fleeing outside.

with this escape, their injuries naturally could not be light under the heavy pressure.

these three people sat there, spewing one mouthful of blood after another. the scene was rather grand.

not far away, gao yuan’s expression changed slightly.

he did not expect that ye yuan only used a silver needle and frightened three great celestial deity powerhouses until like this.

ye yuan looked at the three of them and said with a smile, “what did you all run so fast for? i was just cracking a joke with you guys, you all took it seriously? i’m an alchemist, why would there be so many poisons on me?”

“puhwark!”

“puhwark!”

“puhwark!”

the three people spewed out a large mouthful of blood once more without prior agreement.

this guy really exasperated people to death without paying for it.

“ye yuan, you! when this seat recuperates from my injuries, i definitely won’t spare you! even if you’re heavenly eagle imperial city’s elder, it will not do as well!” song yu said furiously.

the three of their strength was already less than one-tenth under severe injuries.

ye yuan smiled and said, “then you all take good care of your injuries. i’ll retrieve the origin magnetic divine mountain first. oh, right, there’s still a person casting covetous eyes beside you guys. you all wouldn’t think that he would let you guys heal your injuries properly, right?”

the three people’s faces changed, virtually looking at gao yuan at the same time, the flames of fury immediately igniting.

gao yuan’s expression similarly changed. he did not expect that a sentence from ye yuan turned the fire on him and he roared angrily, “ye yuan, don’t make slanderous charges! this old man will leave right now. the three of you feel free to heal your injuries!”

song yu sneered and said, “when you ambushed this seat just now, weren’t you very cocky? now, your father wants to see how you can still be arrogant!”

ka suo and lei yi were both extremely shrewd people. how could they possibly allow a wolf to glare like a ravening tiger at one side unchecked?

ye yuan not being able to kill them did not mean that gao yuan could not kill them.

furthermore, gao yuan’s state currently was even a little better than the three of them.

not killing him, how could the three of them dare to heal up?

ka suo smiled coldly and said, “who the hell cares what happens! finish him off first before talking! this old punk is very insidious, not worse than ye yuan that punk! letting him live, who knows what he’ll do?”

gao yuan’s expression was ugly to the extreme. ye yuan’s move of drawing fire onto him was really vicious!

this was a blatant conspiracy. those three people were old foxes too, it was impossible to not see through that ye yuan was sowing discord.

but they still had to make a move against him.

the reason was very simple, they were not at ease!

this brat was really hard to tangle with!

swoosh! swoosh! swoosh!

the three people forcefully endured the heavy injuries and pincered gao yuan in.

ka suo three people were heavily injured and were long arrows at the end of their flight. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

if not for so, with their identities, how could they possibly join forces to attack?

rather, it was gao yuan. even though he sustained injuries too, it was much lighter in comparison.

very soon, the four people became entangled in a melee.

how could gao yuan be the three people’s match? in a few rounds, he was teetering on his feet, sustaining considerable injuries.

when ye yuan saw this scene, he could not help smiling slightly.

the more shrewd the person, the easier it was to be fooled instead sometimes.

the fight over there, he was not concerned. he was going to go and put away the origin magnetic divine mountain right now.

just as ka suo and the rest said, ye yuan’s strength was insufficient to walk in front of the origin magnetic divine mountain.

the origin magnetic field ahead was too strong. even though he had the origin magnetism spirit wood, this kind of divine object, this thing was clearly much inferior in comparison to the origin magnetic divine mountain.

however, ye yuan has his method.

to him, the origin magnetism spirit wood was the best medium to communicate with the origin magnetic divine mountain!

ye yuan took out the origin magnetism spirit wood and poured essence energy inside frenziedly.

with a swoosh, the origin magnetism spirit wood flew straight for the origin magnetic divine mountain.

crack!

the origin magnetism spirit wood actually inserted into the origin magnetic divine mountain without the least bit of obstruction!

rumble!

the origin magnetic divine mountain seemed to have been activated, instantly emitting a dazzling light.

when the four people who were currently in a fierce battle saw this scene, they could not help stopping, looking at this scene with incredible shock.

“how did this boy do it? he actually started to refine the origin magnetic divine mountain!” song yu’s expression changed drastically.

ka suo gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “damn it! bustling around for such a long time and sustaining such heavy injuries, it actually benefited this brat in the end! when my injuries are healed, i’ll definitely kill this punk at all costs!”

swoosh!

just as the three people were in shock, gao yuan turned into a stream of flowing light, speeding away toward the outside world.

the three people could not be bothered with him at all, their expressions looking at ye yuan complicatedly.

“this origin magnetic divine mountain isn’t an ordinary treasure. its grade is unable to be determined at all! once it’s fully refined, probably even celestial deity powerhouses can be easily killed!” lei yi said with a very ugly expression.
