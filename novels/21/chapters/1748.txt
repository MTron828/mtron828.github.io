Chapter 1752 Reading Without Understanding

“Just now, it was clearly Chi Feng who had the upper-hand. But now why was he suddenly defeated?”

“Yeah, I only saw that kid being chased all over the place, and suddenly, Chi Feng’s brows caught on fire.”

“Maybe this kid was lucky and hit the mark by a fluke?”

...

Chi Feng lost bafflingly just now. It was clearly him who took the upper-hand, but why did he suddenly lose?

Not just him, the others also did not see clearly, all with confused faces.

Only one person, a white-haired old man, understood, with a look of shock flashed past in his eyes.

Ye Yuan’s move earlier was extremely brilliant, directly burning Chi Feng’s two motes of starlight onto the other party’s eyebrows through spatial law.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s movements were extremely concealed. With these few people’s visual prowess, it could not be discovered at all.

“Senior Apprentice Brother Chi Feng, compete with him! Could us priests lose to a low-level trainee?” In the crowd, someone suddenly shouted.

Chi Feng’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Fine! I’ll offer 500 points. If you lose, you’ll lose both the Crane Age Fruit and 300 points to me! Do you dare to agree or not?”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “You’re really shameless enough, 200 points and you want to earn the Crane Age Fruit back. But ... why wouldn’t I not dare? Make your move!”

Chi Feng was just about to make a move when he suddenly stopped and said in a solemn voice, “Just now, it was me who made a move first. This time, it’s your turn!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You really want me to make a move? If I make a move first, you won’t have any chance at all.”

Chi Feng smiled coldly and said, “You were merely lucky just now. Do you really think that you’re impressive? Below elders, no one has yet to dare say such words in front of me, you’re really boasting shamelessly!”

Ye Yuan said with a helpless look, “Since that’s the case, then I’ll make a move. You have to be careful.”

This time, Chi Feng naturally would not underestimate the enemy again. Fully on guard, he stared fixedly at Ye Yuan.

He decided to take Ye Yuan down a peg this time.

Let him know that the prestige of priests was not to be profaned!

Right at this time, Ye Yuan slowly stretched out his right hand, index and middle finger put together.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Chi Feng’s mouth, both hands kneading seals, prepared to summon his divine fire once more.

Ye Yuan’s finger lightly flicked!

Whoosh!

Bang!

Just as everyone had not reacted, a flash of fire rose to the sky.

Chi Feng summoned Starry Sky once more unconsciously.

In the crowd, someone shouted, “Senior Apprentice Brother Chi Feng, your hair! Hair!”

Chi Feng froze and muttered, “Hair?”

All of a sudden, he felt that the top of his head was somewhat hot. Only then did he startle awake.

“Ah! Ahh! My hair! Caught on fire! Caught on fire!”

Chi Feng yelled out, hopping and skipping, just like a panicky rabbit, his appearance so comical.

But the fire on top of his head was very strong and could not be extinguished at al.

The white-haired old man shook his head slightly but was incomparably shocked in his heart.

These two people’s fire controlling techniques were not on the same level at all.

Ye Yuan’s technique seemed simple but was in fact extremely difficult.

Even he could not do it to this kind of degree as well.

Was this trainee newly recruited?

Why was such a genius just an ordinary low-level trainee?

“Ouch, my hand! I ... I admit defeat! I admit defeat! Quickly put out the fire!”

Chi Feng’s hands could not touch his head at all. Ye Yuan’s Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame had long already reached rank four, its power boundless.

Ye Yuan not taking the initiative to recall it, this fire would keep on burning.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, reached his hand out to beckon, that cluster of flames flew back into his palm.

While at this time, Chi Feng’s hair was already burned into black charcoal, looking so funny on his head.

When everyone saw this scene, they all forcefully held back smiles.

But this scene was even more humiliating in Chi Feng’s eyes.

Ye Yuan held back his laugh and said with clasped hands, “Number one fire controller indeed lives up to reputation. Ye Yuan has learned!”

“Looks like this kid really wasn’t lucky!”

“Luck my ass! Facing Chi Feng, you try being lucky twice for me to see!”

“Is he really just a priest trainee? I actually can’t see through his fire controlling method!”

...

After the mockery, what everyone was left with was just shock.

There were quite a few priests present, but those who were able to see through how Ye Yuan made his move, there were none!

A priest trainee, this fire controlling art was also too horrifying, right?

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him. His goal was contribution points. Now that he earned it, he was going to enter Tianlu Pavilion to study!

Transferring the contribution points, Ye Yuan said to the white-haired old man with clasped hands, “Senior, can I go in?”

The white-haired old man said, “Of course you can. Your identity can only enter Tianlu Pavilion’s first level. First level, two hours is five contribution points. The array formation will automatically deduct from your identity token. You grasp the time well yourself!”

Ye Yuan’s face turned black when he heard that and said, “Two hours five contribution points, this is also too black, right?”

The white-haired old man’s face also fell and he said, “Keep talking nonsense and this old man will slap you to death with one palm!”

Ye Yuan stuck out his tongue and slipped inside.

When everyone saw this scene, they were all unclear.

Wasn’t this white-haired old man an ordinary old man managing the Tianlu Pavilion?

That punk was so arrogant with Chi Feng, why was he so respectful toward this old man?

The white-haired old man looked harmless to man and beast, the aura on his body was not strong.

The priests and priest trainees that came to Tianlu Pavilion, very few paid attention to him.

The old man naturally could not be bothered with him either, turning around and entering Tianlu Pavilion.

...

Entering Tianlu Pavilion’s first level, this place formed its own space.

Ye Yuan seemed to have entered an ocean of divine inscriptions. All kinds of records were displayed on a light screen.

Seeing these things, Ye Yuan’s two eyes lit up.

What he was most interested in was naturally the demonic attraction art. This was the foundation of the demon race’s alchemy skills.

In the catalog, Ye Yuan found the demonic attraction art and started to study it tirelessly.

Ye Yuan’s present Alchemy Dao horizons were not what the average person could compare to.

These things were extremely obscure and hard to understand to ordinary priest trainees.

But to Ye Yuan, he read ten lines with one glance but was suddenly enlightened.

Ye Yuan immersed inside, more than ten days passed in a blink of an eye.

Suddenly, a large force came over, Ye Yuan was directly ejected out of Tianlu Pavilion’s first level.

“Ouch! What’s going on?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan plopped onto the ground, grimacing in pain.

“Your contribution points are already depleted, the array formation directly transported you out.” The white-haired old man came behind Ye Yuan at no idea when and said coolly.

Ye Yuan was speechless as he said, “This is called transported? This is called kicking out, alright?”

The white-haired old man snorted coldly and said, “Do you feel that contribution points came too easily, so you don’t know how to cherish it? These few days, reading without understanding like you, how many things can you learn?”

Ye Yuan was stunned and said, “Senior has been paying attention to me these few days?”

The white-haired old man ignored Ye Yuan and said with an angry look from failing to live up to expectations, “Kid, your talent is extremely high, but with such an attitude, it’s hard to have great achievements!”

He had naturally been paying attention to Ye Yuan all along. But he saw that Ye Yuan read no less than 500 classics in over ten days.

And these 500 classics, each one was sufficient for a priest to study for as long as several decades.

Wasn’t this joking around?
