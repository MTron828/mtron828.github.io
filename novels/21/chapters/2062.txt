Chapter 2066: Crushing the Enemy With One Punch

“Yes, Senior Apprentice Sister!”

Behind Senior Apprentice Sister Xun, a girl in palace attire answered and stepped out.

Following her taking a step out, her aura rose straight up, reaching peak Fifth Firmament True God very soon.

That Lian Xin had a proud look, her gaze sweeping over everyone’s faces, hoping to see worshipping looks from the eyes of the people crowding around and watching.

A middle-stage True God mighty expert was a god in imperial cities!

It was just too bad that she was disappointed.

The diners were indeed somewhat surprised at first because they did not think that these beautiful ladies actually wanted to deal with Ye Yuan.

But very soon, the expressions of these diners calmed down. And in their gazes, it even carried a trace of pity.

Even though these people’s strength did not pass Celestial Deity Realm at the highest.

The big spectacles that Heavenly Eagle’s martial artists had experienced before were too many. Forget about a measly little True God Realm, even if it was an Empyrean powerhouse, didn’t they also apologize to everyone obediently?

Senior Apprentice Sister Xuan said coolly, “Just break the four limbs will do, don’t harm his life. Otherwise, that slut will probably threaten to kill herself.”

The moment these words came out, Ye Yuan’s face fell.

Originally, when he suddenly heard Lu-er’s news, he even thought that she was pretty good with these girls. Who knew that the other party wanted to break his four limbs the moment they made their move?

A surge of evil fire immediately rose in Ye Yuan’s heart!

“Senior Apprentice Sister, rest assured. Lian Xin knows how far to go and when to stop. This kind of trash, whichever place I want to break him, it will be broken there.”

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun nodded her head, clearly thinking so too.

The current Ye Yuan looked to be just Celestial Deity Realm cultivation too. He was utterly not worth mentioning in her eyes.

It was not that Ye Yuan was deliberately concealing his cultivation, but that he traveled incognito and did not wish to swagger through the streets.

But in the eye of Senior Apprentice Sister Xun and her group., he became a target that could be kneaded as they pleased.

Finished talking, Lian Xin’s palm reached over, aiming for Ye Yuan’s shoulder blade.

A surge of ice laws instantly spread out, enveloping over toward Ye Yuan. The entire space seemed like it was going to be frozen.

This palm was very swift and fierce, if hit, the shoulder blade would definitely shatter.

“Humph! Acting recklessly and blindly!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, bending his fingers into a claw, and actually reached first despite launching later, directly disregarding Lian Xin’s domain.

Crack!

It was only to hear a crisp sound. Lian Xin fell to the ground with a painful cry. Her shoulder blade bones were already crushed.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s pupils constricted and she cried out in surprise, “Spatial law!”

Ye Yuan ignored Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s surprise and said in a solemn voice, “Where’s Lu-er? Who are you people?”

These few girls clearly did not have good intentions. Most likely, Lu-er’s current situation was also not much better, Ye Yuan was naturally anxious in his heart.

After a brief surprise, Senior Apprentice Sister Xun recovered her calmness, her mouth curling as she said, “I underestimated you, but do you think that you can be unbridled because you know a bit of spatial law? Don’t you worry. After breaking your four limbs, this young lady will slowly tell you that slut’s news on the way. Huan Yi, teach him how to behave properly!”

“Yes, Senior Apprentice Sister!”

The pretty girl smiled sweetly and turned to Ye Yuan and said, “No wonder that slut always kept you in her thoughts. I didn’t expect that your talent is actually not weaker than hers, cultivating to become a Fifth Firmament True God in a short 1000 years. However, it’s useless. You dared to hurt my Ice Cloud Tower’s disciples, it won’t be as simple as breaking four limbs!”

While talking, Huan Yi’s aura gradually grew stronger.

Taking three steps out, her aura already rose to Sixth Firmament True God!

But when that waiter saw the situation, he shook his head slightly and said with a sigh, “Really a little girl who hasn’t seen much of the world before. Asking for trouble!”

When others all nodded slightly when they heard it, deeply feeling that way too.

If Ye Yuan was just an ordinary martial artist, they would definitely be worried for his safety.

But the one standing here was Ye Yuan. Even Lu Ziyi, that kind of genius who comprehended five kinds of laws, died in Ye Yuan’s hands.

These few little girls in front of them thought that their strength was powerful, but actually, in Ye Yuan’s eyes, they were simply ants.

The waiter’s voice was not concealed. Hearing the waiter’s words, her pretty face could not help turning cold, suddenly pointing a finger out, and actually pointed at the waiter.

“Ignorant ant, go and die!”

The waiter was merely Divine Lord Realm cultivation. Being hit by this finger, he would definitely be frozen into an ice sculpture.

But the waiter did not have the intention of dodging, because he knew that Ye Yuan would not let him die.

“Humph! You’re the ignorant ant!”

Ye Yuan had long lost his patience. The other party kept on calling slut, how could he not be furious?

It was only to see his figure arriving in front of Huan Yi like a ghost.

Huan Yi knew that Ye Yuan knew spatial law and was actually long prepared.

But even so, she still jumped in fright from Ye Yuan’s ghostly figure.

Huan Yu’s ice law suddenly released, rushing toward Ye Yuan frenziedly.

But sadly, Ye Yuan did not give her the chance at all.

Smash!

A clear slap sounded out, Huan Yi was directly slapped flying out.

This time, Ye Yuan did not stop, figure moving once more, already arriving in front of Senior Apprentice Sister Xun.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun laughed coldly, the aura on her body suddenly releasing. She was shockingly Seventh Firmament True God!

“Courting death!”

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s reaction was also extremely fast. With a cry, her long sword was already in her hand in a twinkle,

But Ye Yuan did not dodge or avoid, a fist met with Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s sword.

Seeing that Ye Yuan actually used his physical body to forcefully resist her true god mystic treasure, Senior Apprentice Sister Xun was even more scornful in her heart.

“Ice Sleet Sword[1]!”

It was only to see the tip of her sword point. Countless ice sleets extended out of the void, piercing straight for Ye Yuan.

Those ice sleets were condensed by her with the power of law, the power immense. Each one was akin to a sharp sword. Even if a Seventh Firmament True God forcefully resisted it, they would also have to be poked into a mesh.

Ye Yuan actually forcefully resisted with his fleshy body. In her eyes, he was simply courting death.

But very soon, Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s expression changed wildly.

Because Ye Yuan rushed over!

Crack, crack, crack ... Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was only to see golden light radiate brilliantly on Ye Yuan’s body. When those ice sleets touched the golden light, they were directly split into two, like ordinary ice cones.

These ice sleets that were able to pierce a Seventh Firmament True God to death were actually unable to stop Ye Yuan in the slightest?

How could she know that when Ye Yuan broke through domineeringly at Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital the last time, his physical body already broke through to late-stage sixth transformation?

Even when encountering a high-grade true god mystic treasure, he did not fear in the slightest too, let alone ice sleets condensed from mere power of law.

At this moment, Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s move was already ending and did not have time to change moves at all.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s punch slam over, she did not have time to think too much, power of law erupting suddenly on her body. All around her body was actually covered in layers of ice armor.

Ye Yuan did not care and directly slammed a punch on it.

“Puhwark!”

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun vomited a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, figure directly flying out of the inn, her life and death unknown.

“Tianping, bring her to the City Lord Manor!” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

“Yes, Your Excellency!”

Ning Tianping had followed Ye Yuan for a long time and knew that Ye Yuan was currently already enraged to the extreme. At once, he did not dare to dawdle, his figure going out of the inn with a dash.

The Ice Cloud Tower’s few disciples looked at Ye Yuan like seeing a ghost, their gazes full of shock.

Huan Yi covered her face and cried out in surprise, “Senior Apprentice Sister Xun’s ice law is already cultivated to late-stage rank six, but she was ... actually sent flying with one punch?”

She could not help it but to be shocked.

Senior Apprentice Sister Xun was a small stage higher than Ye Yuan. Her ice law was also cultivated to late-stage rank six already. Her strength could also rank in the top five among the Ice Cloud Tower’s young generation. She actually could not even not block one of his punches?

Was this fellow still human?

“Heh heh, I already said that you all haven’t seen much of the world. How can His Excellency’s strength be what you all, these little fellows, can judge?”

The waiter had a smug look as if the one who won was him.
