Chapter 3010: The Blood Race’s Scheme!

“W-Why?” Mi Zhen’s eyes were full of unwillingness.

Blood Two said coolly, “It’s very simple. It’s because you’re useless now. Compared to taking blood essence from his body, it’s much easier to get it from you.”

At this time, clusters of fresh blood condensed in Blood Two’s hand, emitting a powerful undulation.

That was Mi Zhen’s blood essence!

In that instant just now, Blood Two severely wounded Mi Zhen, and extracted 50% of his blood essence all at once.

“I … I won’t let you off!” The fury in Mi Zhen’s chest rose straight to the firmament.

But he was already dying.

Blood Two could not be bothered to care about Mi Zhen’s fury and said to Mi Tian with a smile, “I really didn’t expect that you’ve actually been with that kid the entire time! This boy is really my jinx. He has already ruined my affairs several times. This time, it fell through at his hands again!”

Mi Tian frowned and said, “If not for that you made a move against him in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, I’d still be kept in the dark. I also didn’t expect that your clone in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven has actually come into being a long time ago! It looks like your scheme started since long ago!”

Blood Two smiled and said, “Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s strongest four clans, I’ve already obtained three. Originally, there was just one last step for your Dragon Clan. But I didn’t expect that that brat actually brought you back. This time, that brat ruined my affairs again. I really want to kill him!”

Mi Tian’s pupils constricted, obtained three out of the four clans!

This meant that the four symbols family clans had already almost fallen completely into enemy hands!

That was right. This Blood Two was none other than precisely one of the Chaos Bloodstone’s clones!

Of course, he was also one of the people who schemed against Mi Tian back then.

This was also to say that this Blood Two had long already been born several hundred thousand years ago.

He plotted in secret, toying with the entire Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven in the palm of his hands.

Originally, Mi Tian did not know Blood Two’s identity. But, in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, the Chaos Bloodstone made a move against Ye Yuan. That was how he finally realized it.

The aura of that guy who plotted against him back then was exactly the same as the Chaos Bloodstone!

This way, everything made sense.

Mi Zhen colluded with Blood Two and sold him out.

It was just that Mi Zhen did not know what kind of dangerous existence he was together with!

Blood Two was just a clone of the Chaos Bloodstone!

Nobody knew how strong his original body was.

Perhaps, he was only half a step away from completely opening the Door of Eternal Life!

“You can forget about him! Even if this seat dies, I won’t let you prevail too!” Mi Tian said in a cold voice.

Blood Two waved his hand and said with a smile, “You don’t have to be so nervous. Honestly speaking, I really want to kill that boy. But now is not the time. You should know, that day won’t be too long. Furthermore, I’ve already acquired your four clans’ blood essence. The most important thing at present is cracking the key and letting my original body’s origin reach grand completion!”

Mi Tian’s body immediately filled with a murderous aura.

Blood Two smiled and said, “Why? Do you really want to fight with me? To quote something from Mi Zhen, I’m no longer who I used to be back then! I know that you’re very strong now, but we’re at most evenly-matched too. You can’t make me stay. Alright, it was a pleasant chat today. I won’t disturb you two brothers’ reunion anymore, goodbye.”

Finished saying, Blood Two directly disappeared from where he was.

Mi Tian did not move because he did not have confidence in making the other party stay.

A clone was already so powerful. Mi Tian did not dare to imagine how strong the Chaos Bloodstone’s original body was!

“What on earth are you guys talking about?” Mi Zhen asked weakly.

Mi Tian gave him a glance and could not help but sigh.

This guy was a complete and utter fool!

He recounted the existence of the Chaos Bloodstone. Mi Zhen’s entire body trembled heavily after he heard.

Endless remorse and humiliation welled up from the bottom of his heart.

Mi Zhen’s personality was unyielding and arrogant. When he discovered that he was completely played like a monkey by someone for hundreds of thousands of years, that sense of shame made him virtually want to commit suicide.

“Big Brother, I … I was wrong!”

This overlord of the heavens, a Great Beyond Realm mighty expert, wept like a child.

… …

Very soon, Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven fell into great chaos, the fires of war burning everywhere.

The four symbols family clans had fallen completely into civil wars.

Every once in a while, there would be news of Hegemons dying that was transmitted over.

From start to end, the three families’ Great Beyond progenitors did not appear.

Only then did people discover that the situation was not quite right.

Mi Tian also expended a great effort to completely eradicate the Dragon Clan’s tumors.

These people had long been marked by Ye Yuan.

He had the origin of blood and was very sensitive to these people.

The Dragon Clan actually had one-third of its Hegemon Realm powerhouses that were controlled by the blood race!

In this battle, the Dragon Clan suffered a great loss in vitality.

After resolving the Dragon Clan’s havoc, Mi Tian led the Dragon Clan and pacified the chaos of the other three clans.

Only then did Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven slowly stabilize.

But the Hegemons of the four symbols family clans who died reached as many as a hundred people!

The whereabouts of the three clans’ ancestors were unknown!

Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven suffered a great loss in vitality!

This disaster lasted for more than ten years before it gradually subsided.

In the Eternal River, waves rolled.

Ye Yuan’s aura soared to the sky, breaking through to upper Emperor Cloud Heaven in one stroke!

“Huff?… Finally cultivated it back! My dragon race origin divinity is already completely restored too. It’s even a level stronger than before! Being able to make use of the power of chaos in the Eternal River to cultivate, my path should be correct! It’s just I don’t know until which step I can reach in the future!?Mn??Why am I the only one here?”

Ye Yuan leaped, leaving the Eternal River, his face somewhat blank.

The originally bustling Eternal River was now empty. He was the only one left.

But very soon, he could not help laughing as he said, “Right, I stirred up the chaos. They couldn’t cultivate at all. Senior Mi Tian should have already recovered, right? Also don’t know how things are outside.”

Seeing Ye Yuan come out, Long Min’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, “You … Your cultivation actually improved further!”

He was specially arranged by Mi Tian to stay behind and await Ye Yuan to exit seclusion.

It was just that Long Min never expected that not only did Ye Yuan recover his strength fully, but he also even took it one step further!

At this time, Ye Yuan actually gave him a fleeting and ephemeral, and unfathomable feeling.

Could this be due to the Eternal River chaos?

Suddenly, Long Min was somewhat envious of Ye Yuan.

This guy was really remarkable!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Actually, most of the new cultivation methods that I comprehended are just the opposite of my original cultivation methods. Cultivating back my original realm isn’t something difficult.”

Long Min said in shock, “J-Just inversing the cultivation method and it will have such a magical effect?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and asked, “Senior, how’s the situation outside now?”

The moment this was asked, Long Min’s brows furrowed together.

He recounted Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s situation. Ye Yuan’s heart also sank.

More than 100 Hegemon Realms fell. This had not happened in all the heavens and myriad worlds for many years already.

Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven’s strength was diminished by almost half at once!

Furthermore, the three great progenitors were actually all missing. It was likely fraught with grim possibilities.

With this, the blood race’s scheme in Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven was considered to be completely carried out!

Most likely, Mi Tian was also utterly exhausted from overwork now, right?

“Oh,?right, Progenitor instructed to hand this to you after you exit seclusion!” As he said those words, Long Min handed Ye Yuan two small bottles.

The things contained inside were shockingly White Tiger blood essence and Black Tortoise blood essence!ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
