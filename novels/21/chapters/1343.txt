Chapter 1347: You Don’t Say, How Would I Know?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“A banquet with hidden dangers! Ye Yuan, this banquet, you mustn’t go!” Yang Rui said solemnly.

At this time, Yang Rui and Ye Yuan both received an invitation in their hands.

These two invitations were issued by City Lord Manor.

The four families fought for so long, City Lord Manor had always remained silent.

This time, they were finally making a move.

It was just that Ye Yuan received an invitation too. This made Yang Rui very uneasy.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just go. Why shouldn’t I go? They are aiming at the Essence Cultivating Pill. If I don’t go, this matter will probably never end.”

Yang Rui naturally knew that they were aiming at the Essence Cultivating Pill. But if Ye Yuan went, he felt uneasy.

Those going this time were all experts. He could not protect Ye Yuan by himself.

“I know, but ... I’m afraid that this invitation will be detrimental to you!” Yang Rui said.

“No way, right? This time, it’s the city lord coming forward personally. No matter how courageous their few families are, they also don’t dare to act wildly in front of the city lord, right?” Ye Yuan said puzzledly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Rui sighed and said, “You don’t know this. That Wang Su, who came from the Wang Family’s main family, his elder brother came out of Wu Meng Academy with City Lord Chen Yongnian. Before you exited seclusion, the City Lord Manor actually suppressed us directly and indirectly, the intentions are already very obvious.”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, and he said, “You’re saying that they are acting in collusion, all targeting us?”

Yang Rui nodded and said, “If barring no accidents, it should be so! Hence, for the sake of your safety, you’d better not go!”

The complexity of Jewelhill City’s situation exceeded Ye Yuan’s expectations.

However, this could not scare him.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since they are already riding on top of our heads, we can’t avoid it no matter what. Not going today, they will always have a way to come and find trouble again. Rather than that, might as well take this opportunity, everybody lay it out on the table, that’s better.”

Yang Rui said anxiously, “Goodness, why are you so obstinate? That City Lord Chen Yongnian is a middle-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouse. Once he steels his heart to deal with you, I can’t stop him!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Tower Lord is overly concerned. Even if they have that layer of relationship, I think the city lord won’t make a move without careful consideration too. After all, his identity is placed there.”

...

Unable to persuade Ye Yuan, Yang Rui still brought him over.

He could only place his hopes that Chen Yongnian could have misgivings about the Myriad Treasure Tower’s prestige and not dare to make a move against Ye Yuan.

The City Lord Manor’s main hall was very large. The banquet was very sumptuous too.

That young city lord on the seat of honor also wore a broad smile. He looked like he had a good relationship with everyone.

It was only after three rounds of drinking had passed did Chen Yongnian bring up the topic.

“Thank you all for giving this city lord this face, to be able to come to the City Lord Manor and get together. Everyone, all present here are my Jewelhill City’s pillars of strength. Everyone says that if enmity is not settled amicably, there is no end to it, doesn’t everyone agree?”

Chen Yongnian’s gaze swept over everyone’s faces one by one. Everyone immediately felt immense pressure.

Even Yang Rui felt tremendous pressure too.

“City Lord, Your Excellency, is right!” Lu Family’s old head said with a smile.

“That’s right, that’s right! Everyone says that amiability brings wealth, haha ...” Lin Family’s old head also concurred.

But Wang Su smiled faintly and said, “What Brother Chen says is right. Jewelhill City is everybody’s, not one family’s. It’s not good to be overbearing!”

Chen Yongnian looked towards Yang Rui and said with a smile, “Tower Lord Yang, what say you?”

Yang Rui’s expression was rather ugly as he smiled slightly awkwardly and said, “This ...”

He was very reluctant. When the Myriad Treasure Tower was about to go out of business back then, why didn’t you, Chen Yongnian, say so?

Now that the Wang Family was collapsing, you came forward to posture?

Except, the pressure that Chen Yongnian gave him was too great. He had no choice but to lower his head.

Strength was one aspect, more importantly, what Chen Yongnian represented was Wu Meng Capital City!

Yang Rui’s words reached the tip of his tongue, but he was interrupted by Ye Yuan.

“Uh ... delicious! Too delicious! Tsk tsk, City Lord Manor is indeed not an ordinary place. The taste of this dish is excellent!” Ye Yuan smacked his lips, enjoying it greatly.

In this situation, the Lin Family’s family head, Lin Zaitian, Lu Family’s Lu Jinghao, as well as Wang Lingbo, could only stand at one side.

But Ye Yuan was sitting carelessly to Yang Rui’s right, eating and drinking to his heart’s content.

Chen Yongnian’s brows furrowed, his gaze sweeping towards Ye Yuan. But Ye Yuan directly ignored him and only cared about his eating.

Chen Yongnian felt his fist land on cotton, feeling very uncomfortable.

Even the initial-stage Heaven Glimpse Yang Rui yielded, this punk actually deliberately came out to cause trouble.

“Ye Yuan, could it be that ... you have objections towards this city lord’s words?” Chen Yongnian said with a frown.

It was only after hearing his name being called did Ye Yuan raise his head. He looked towards Chen Yongnian, saying with a blank look, “Mm? City Lord, Your Excellency, did you say something just now? Your dishes are too delicious, I didn’t hear!”

Pretend!

Carry on feigning!

When he spoke just now, the entire main hall could hear, he did not believe that Ye Yuan could not hear it!

But, got to say, Ye Yuan was a very crucial figure today.

Otherwise, he would not specially give him a seat either.

Chen Yongnian reined in his temper and said, “This city lord said earlier, everyone is in the same city and meet frequently. If enmity is not settled amicably, there is no end to it! Don’t you say so?”

Ye Yuan was thrilled the moment he heard and said with a smile, “Enemy? Who’s the enemy? My enemy1 is Drunken Wind Inn’s Little Red. Could it be that City Lord knows this Ye likes this and called her here too?”

Drunken Wind Inn was Jewelhill City’s largest brothel. This, Ye Yuan still knew. But Little Red was him talking nonsense.

Chen Yongnian was nearly angered until he had internal injuries. This guy was clearly inserting dialogue for comic relief on purpose.

Yang Rui sweated profusely as he listened by the side, while Wang Su and the rest had gloating faces.

Offending the city lord in Jewelhill City was not some wise move.

Chen Yongnian gave a cold snort, but said to Yang Rui, “Tower Lord Yang, this city lord only hosted this banquet on account of everybody’s contributions to Jewelhill City for many years, and let everyone bury the hatchet! Is this your Myriad Treasure Tower’s attitude?”

This cold snort, Chen Yongnian used the aura of middle-stage Heaven Glimpse. The impetus was very shocking.

Yang Rui’s expression changed, and he was just about to speak but was intercepted by Ye Yuan, who said, “Haha, turns out what City Lord is talking about is this! Say it earlier! You don’t say, how would I know? Burying the hatchet is good, I wonder what brilliant idea City Lord, Your Excellency, has?”

Chen Yongnian was just about to suppress Yang Rui with ruthless means and force him to submit. But having Ye Yuan cause a disturbance like this, he almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

Ye Yuan brought him around a roundabout and circled back again. Wasn’t this messing with him?

However, Chen Yongnian did not wish to make things too unpleasant either. It was true that he was targeting the Myriad Treasure Tower today, but he would try his best not to make a move to the best of his ability.

To actually employing martial strength was a problem too.

After all, the Myriad Treasure Tower was not to be trifled with as well.

This was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse’s business!

Chen Yongnian endured his anger, snorted coldly, and slowly said, “I have an idea. Everyone, we discuss it a bit, see if it works or not. Tower Lord, if there’s money to make, everybody should earn them together. Don’t you think so? Your Myriad Treasure Tower’s Essence Cultivating Pill is too tyrannical. This way, everybody doesn’t have means of subsistence anymore. Why not you all take out the Essence Cultivating Pill’s selling rights and share some with the Wang, Lin, and Lu, three families!”
