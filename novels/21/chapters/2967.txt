Chapter 2966: Pummeling the Four Great Hegemons!

“Should we bury the hatchet first? I keep feeling that something bad is going to happen.” Hegemon Heavenly Soul said.

Bloodsong snorted coldly and said, “Heavenly Soul, are you a good-for-nothing? A measly little Emperor Cloud Heaven has scared you? Or is it that you got scared by Hegemon Mi Tian’s name?”

Heavenly Soul’s expression turned cold, and he said in anger, “Keep your mouth shut! Otherwise, this seat will find trouble with you!”

Bloodsong’s mouth curled, and he stopped talking.

He currently needed the Qi Soul Clan’s alliance.

However, with this disturbance, no one kept Ye Yuan in mind.

They were Supreme Hegemons in the end. There were really not many existences in this world that could threaten them.

They also really wanted to see just what the hell Ye Yuan was doing.

In the origin sea, Ye Yuan emitted a series of strange fluctuations through the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique.

This undulation was very unique. Even the four great Hegemons could not sense it.

But a portion of the origins in the origin sea started to seethe little by little!

These were all masterless origins without consciousness.

They would not deliberately attack people and would not deliberately let people comprehend.

But at this time, they actually seemed to have their consciousness be awakened, producing a resonance with Ye Yuan’s soul physique!

Very soon, those origins were seemingly lit up.

In this dark God Bewildering Battlefield, countless stars seemed to have lit up all at once.

Originally, the four great Hegemons were all waiting to see Ye Yuan’s laughingstock. But now, they could not laugh anymore.

At their prime, they naturally did not care about these origins.

But the four of them were currently in a situation of four sides being defeated and wounded.

Being attacked by so many origin energies, the consequences were not an ordinary kind of serious!

“What on earth is going on here? Those masterless origins are being awakened by him?” Hegemon Heavenly Soul said in shock.

“Could it be that this boy is planning to use these origins to come and attack us? This isn’t possible, right?” Evil Dragon said in shock.

“Hur hur,?how is this possible? These masterless origins, even we can’t order them about. He, a puny little Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, can order so many origins to be used by him? This boy probably imprinted many origin seeds in the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique and can cause an origin resonance, that’s all. He wants to use this move to force Old Ghost Imperishable to submit,” Bloodsong still said disdainfully.

When everyone heard this, they felt that it made sense too. They immediately felt much more relieved.

At this time, Hegemon Imperishable suddenly said, “What he awakened doesn’t seem to be all of the origins. This place is the God Bewildering Battlefield. Do you guys think he will use some method to awaken all of the origins of the Labyrinth Divine Palace powerhouses that died?”

The moment these words came out, the three great Hegemons were shocked.

If it was like this, it would be terrifying!

“This … This isn’t possible, right? A measly little Emperor Cloud Heaven, what right does he have to be able to summon the origins of the Labyrinth Divine Palace powerhouses who died?” Hegemon Bloodsong said in alarm.

Although he denied it firmly, he still felt that Hegemon Imperishable’s guess was very reliable.

But Heavenly Soul trembled all over and said in disbelief, “Don’t you all forget. Old Thing Mi Tian and the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s Hegemon Tian Que are bosom friends! If he passed some secret technique to this brat, it’s not impossible!”

Hegemon Imperishable said, “Back then, the Labyrinth Divine Palace was like a snowball, rolling bigger and bigger. Furthermore, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s disciples were extremely united! It was like there was something brainwashing them. This boy might be using this secret technique! Although the origins are masterless, they were all comprehended by people, and all carry a trace of obsession from powerhouses when they were still alive. This trace of obsession is usually nothing, but if it’s the Labyrinth Divine Palace …”

The horizons of the few great supreme hegemons were all at the peak of the heavens.

Hegemon Mi Tian’s relationship with the Labyrinth Divine Palace was no secret.

Especially that Hegemon Heavenly Soul was sworn enemies with him, he naturally knew very very well.

They guessed the whole thing very quickly.

However, it was already too late!

All of a sudden, countless light dots in the night sky whistled by, like a meteor shower, completely illuminating the night sky.

The four great Hegemons felt their hairs stand on end.

“Old Ghost Imperishable, hurry up and stop!” Hegemon Heavenly Soul cried out.

At this time, the Hegemon Imperishable, who had been level-headed and calm, was not calm anymore as well.

His voice appeared slightly anxious as he said, “One! Two! Three! Let go!”

The other three people were long already too impatient to wait. At virtually the same time, the four people separated.

But at this time, the origin meteor shower had already arrived in front of the four people.

Among the hundreds of thousands of origins that were awakened, there were even many Hegemon Realm powerhouses’ origins among them. How immense was the pressure?

The four people brought out their strongest moves at the same time without hesitation, attempting to withstand this meteor shower.

If they were at their prime, they naturally would not fear a bunch of dead people.

But the four people had experienced a great battle without equal. They were all already arrows at the end of their flight.

Facing such shocking power, they also felt tremendous pressure.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

… …

The meteors fell, and the void exploded!

A terrifying to the extreme energy undulation blew the void into smithereens.

“ARGH!?Pain! So painful!”

Hegemon Evil Dragon cried out strangely. His powerful physical body was blasted into a blurry mess of blood and flesh.

Countless meteors landed on Hegemon Heavenly Soul’s head, directly blowing his head away.

And Hegemon Imperishable’s Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique also became extremely thin under this kind of terrifying explosion.

This meteor shower explosion belonged to an indiscriminate attack. It even disrupted the heaven and earth rules in this area of space-time.

Therefore, Hegemon Imperishable’s consciousness suffered heavy damage too.

The most miserable was none other than Hegemon Bloodsong.

Ye Yuan fused a wisp of the purest blood origin into Hegemon level origin.

Hegemon Bloodsong was also a key target of Ye Yuan’s consideration.

That region of blood lake almost dissipated under this bombardment!

One had to know that Hegemon Bloodsong’s strength was even stronger than Lord Wang Zuo’s! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

How could his blood lake be so easy to break?

But sadly, he encountered Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan’s origin of blood was even purer than his origin!

“This is the origin of chaos blood! How can you, a measly little Emperor Cloud Heaven, have this!?AHHH!”?Amidst the miserable cries, Hegemon Bloodsong’s voice was filled with horror.

He was all too clear where this origin of chaos blood originated from!

Apart from the Chaos Bloodstone, nobody could possess it!

Now, it actually appeared on a puny little human.

How could he not be horrified?

The terrifying meteor shower bombardment finally subsided after blasting this region of space-time for several hours.

At this time, Ye Yuan’s figure slowly emerged. It was just that his soul body was already close to dissipating.

Guiding this origin explosion, he naturally had to pay a huge price too.

The price was his soul body virtually collapsing.

The current Ye Yuan was weak to the extreme once again.

However, the four great Supreme Hegemons were even more miserable than him.

If someone was here, they would definitely be frightened until their eyes were popping out.

Regarding these four great Supreme Hegemons, randomly call one out and the world would tremble for a long time.

But here, they were actually being thrashed by a puny little Emperor Cloud Heaven!

This scene was seriously too soul-stirring.
