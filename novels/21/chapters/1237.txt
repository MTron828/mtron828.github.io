Chapter 1241: Four Symbols Resonance!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hey, the person who’s saving you is here,” Ye Yuan looked at Long Chun and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Long Chun’s dead eyes finally had a hint of sheen.

“Grandfather! Quickly save me, Grandfather!”

Long Chun saw Long Yan and practically used all the strength in his body to shout.

Only when Long Yan saw that his grandson was safe and sound, did his heart settle down slightly.

But immediately, his gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was filled with killing intent.

This human brat actually dared provoke the majesty of the Four Symbols Divine Beasts. What was this if it wasn’t seeking death?”

“Brat, let Chun-er go if you’re sensible, I’ll leave you an intact corpse!” Long Yan said fiercely to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan could not help finding it funny when he heard. Could this old man have stayed inside this confined space for too long, to not even know about the ways of the world?

Was this how you asked for someone?

You even wanted to leave me with an intact corpse, I still have to let your grandson go?

However, Ye Yuan really did that.

Ye Yuan lifted his leg and kicked Long Chun’s buttocks, immediately sending him flying out.

“ARGH!!”

Long Chun screamed miserably and flew straight for Long Yan.

Long Yan was startled and hurriedly fired out a streak of essence energy, catching Long Chun.

Everyone was shocked, especially Long Yan.

He even thought that he had to expend a bout of effort before he could rescue Long Chun.

What he was worried about was Ye Yuan using Long Chun as a hostage to threaten him. That way, he would really be somewhat cautious in taking action.

He did not think that this human boy actually directly let him go.

However, did he think that he would let him off like this?

“Grandpa!”

Long Chun had a look of shame. He, this young patriarch, had utterly thrown his face away today.

Long Yan snorted coldly and reproached, “Shameful thing, scram back and reflect on your mistakes behind closed doors! You’re not to exit seclusion within a hundred years!”

Long Chun did not dare to disobey and said respectfully, “Yes, Grandfather.”

Long Yan no longer bothered with Long Chun, but looked at Ye Yuan with a grim look and said, “Human boy, you’re very sensible. I’ll keep my word and leave you with an intact corpse!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re the dragon clan’s head elder, Long Yan, right? I think you’re misunderstanding something, Long Chun is just a small fry to me. Letting go or not only takes a thought. Not killing him is just because this young master’s ties with the dragon race isn’t shallow. Otherwise, do you think that those people would have the chance to return and tip off you?”

Long Yan’s face fell, and he said, “Boy, how confident you are! Or is it, you’re an egomaniac? You ask yourself, facing the four of us, can you still escape with your life?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heh, not arrogant, but that I have this strength! The four of you attack together then, I want to take a look just how strong the Four Symbols Family Clans inside this Divine Beast Realm are!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed!

The arrangement inside this Divine Beast Realm, apart from the Patriarch who’s in closed-seclusion all year-round, as well as that old ancestor who had never shown his face before, it was these four head elders as the head.

The four head elders were all existences who had comprehended Divine Dao laws!

This human brat actually wanted to fight one-on-four? Was he crazy?

“Hahaha ... What an arrogant boy! Truly unaware of the immensity of heaven and earth! Killing you, this old man along is sufficient!”

Towards a just initial-stage divine king human boy, he did not take his seriously at all.

Done talking, he stepped forward and threw a palm out, toppling mountains and overturning the seas!

“Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!”

Ye Yuan smiled again. Grand completion spirit rank Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm and Long Yan wanted to deal with Ye Yuan using that move?

With the exact same move, Ye Yuan’s Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm came out with a howl!

The same grand completion spirit rank!

One palm unleashing, the winds and clouds immediately changed color!

Boom!

Long Yan flew out backward. He could not withstand the power of Ye Yuan’s palm, spewing out a mouthful of blood.

Comprehending Divine Rank laws and comprehending divine rank dragon wave was two completely different concepts!

The Four Symbols Family Clans were the darlings of heaven and earth and had their own Dao belonging to them.

The dragon race martial techniques were actually a different understanding of ‘Dao.’

And dragon wave was the amplitude stimulated with dragon race bloodline power, the medium to unleash the martial technique.

The dragon race martial techniques, inclusive of the Voice of the Dragon God inside, were released with dragon wave.

If Ye Yuan’s dragon wave was only spirit rank, his Voice of the Dragon God would not have such horrifying power either.

In addition, Ye Yuan’s comprehension of the dragon race’s Martial Dao had long reached an exceedingly high realm under Long Teng’s guidance.

His comprehension of the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm was far above Long Yan’s.

The juniors that came together were all dumbstruck. They rubbed their eyes, looking at this scene in front of them in disbelief.

“N-No way, right? A human’s Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm is actually even more formidable than Head Elder’s!”

“Previously he used this move to defeat Young Patriarch, I even thought that that was already his limits. Didn’t expect that his Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm is actually on the same level as Head Elder!”

“No wonder he dared to be so arrogant. It turns out that he really had the capital to be arrogant!”

...

In the crowd, Long Zhen thought that Head Elder arriving could definitely help him purge away his former shame.

He did not expect that the invincible head elder in his heart, was actually defeated just like this!

Recalling back then, the gap between him and Ye Yuan was also not that great.

But now, Ye Yuan could poke him to death with a little pinkie.

He who had always cracked himself up to be a genius, finally knew what was called feeling ashamed of his own unseemliness.

Long Yan looked at Ye Yuan with an astonished look and said in incredible shock, “You ... How do you know the Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm? This is my dragon clan’s non-transmissible secret! You ... This is the death penalty!”

“Death penalty? Who’s sentencing the death penalty? You?” Ye Yuan could not help laughing in spite of himself as he said.

The four clans’ head elders were all stifled when they heard that. Yeah, these words that originally sounded all too normal, they sounded so laughable hearing it at this time.

In this world, it had always been the strong sentencing the weak to death.

Now, Ye Yuan was clearly that strong one!

Long Yan’s face fell, and he said, “Still in a daze for what? Attack together! I want to see just how strong this brat is!”

The other three head elders’ faces turned stern, and without being the slightest bit apprehensiveness, they attacked together!

Four great head elder attacking in unison, the commotion it caused was truly shocking.

But what made Ye Yuan surprised was that these four people’s martial techniques cooperating together, they actually produced a kind of resonance!

Azure dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, black tortoise!

Four divine beasts’ phantoms emerged in unison and actually aroused heaven and earth’s resonance!

Ye Yuan’s expression turned stern and did not dare to slight it.

The Domain of Sword instantly opened up, shrinking to a radius of ten feet. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At the same time, the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art revolved in full force, an earth-yellow light flooding his body.

Boom!

Under the four great head elders’ dumbfounded gazes, Ye Yuan forcefully received this blow!

Even though this attack’s power was incomparably terrifying, compared to the three great fiendgods’ Starburst Grand Art, it was more than a magnitude inferior.

Ye Yuan did not budge an inch!

“This ... How is this possible?”

The four head elders felt that this was too preposterous.

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “I didn’t expect that the four symbols divine beasts’ martial techniques combining together, can actually produce such power! It’s just that, your strength is too weak.”

Ye Yuan’s words made the four head elders’ expressions incredibly ugly.

The four of them were the Divine Beast Realm’s apex existences already. A joint-attack actually could not even break off a single hair of this brat in front of them!
