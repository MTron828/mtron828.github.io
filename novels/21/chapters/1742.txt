Chapter 1746 Learning and Doing on the Spo

Mu Yuanchun was so depressed!

This guy was clearly clueless about the demon race’s alchemy techniques, so why did the elder still let him carry on?

How could he know that what Stonefeather saw was completely different from what he saw!

The things he saw were Ye Yuan’s crudeness and ignorance.

But what Stonefeather saw was Ye Yuan’s improvement!

Actually, since after the first round, he had been paying attention to Ye Yuan all along.

When the second round started, from when the first person took the field, Ye Yuan’s gaze never left his body before.

From the initial-most completely ignorance to the later slightly rustiness.

This improvement was truly too astonishing.

Stonefeather was an expert in this area, so how amazing was his vision?

Ye Yuan’s improvement simply made people sigh with wonder!

One had to know, prior to this, he was still a complete and utter newbie.

Stonefeather very much wanted to see to what extent Ye Yuan could reach when he enter the field.

The examinees went up one by one, but those who could pass the test could be counted on one hand.

Of course, there were also a few with decent strength who bound together 30 over kinds of wood.

And these people’s achievements, the inspiration it gave Ye Yuan was naturally greater.

Very soon, it was Mu Yuanchun’s turn to take the stage. He shot the very engrossed Ye Yuan a glance, his expression showing disdain.

The moment he made his move, Mu Yuanchun amazed the audience.

It was only for them to see him move like lightning, using an extremely short time to bind together more than a dozen types of wood.

25 types were naturally not his goal.

“So impressive, looking at him, he can at least bind together more than 40 kinds, right?”

“Even though the first round’s limelight was snatched by that punk, Mu Yuanchun’s strength is really very strong!”

“That kid is simply a layman regarding demon divine pills. Scared me until I even thought that I encountered a great alchemist just now!”

...

Mu Yuanchun’s demonic attraction art was clearly very brilliant, more than a notch stronger than the others.

These people’s gazes were all attracted by Mu Yuanchun. No one noticed that the eyes of the Ye Yuan in a corner became brighter and brighter.

“45!”

“46!”

...

“50!”

“51! My God, he finally failed!”

“This number already surpassed even Priest Kong Lin’s!”

The further back, everyone started to help Mu Yuanchun count.

Finally, after Mu Yuanchun fused 51 wood chips, it collapsed.

But the number of 51 types of wood chips still let Mu Yuanchun obtain extremely high praises.

One had to know, Kong Lin was a genius universally recognized in the recent few assessments. But he only completed 47 kinds of wood chips in the last season too.

While Mu Yuanchun was actually four more than him!

Stonefeather secretly nodded his head. Since he internally decided on Mu Yuanchun, his strength naturally left no room for doubt.

If he could not even do this, he also would not be fit to be his personal disciple anymore.

Hearing everyone’s sigh of admiration, the confidence that Mu Yuanchun had just lost returned once more.

Since many people were eliminated in the middle, the next one was Ye Yuan’s turn.

Mu Yuanchun smiled and said, “Our layman is going to take the field. Let’s see how many types of wood chips he can fuse together? Why doesn’t everyone make a guess.”

The moment these words came out, everyone immediately felt like they were injected with stimulants.

“I guess that it’s at most no more than 10 types!”

“10 types? Are your eyes blind? Just the likes of him can fuse 10 types? I guess at most five types!”

“Pooh! He’s totally clueless, alright? I guess not even one!”

...

Hearing everyone’s discussion, Mu Yuanchun had an amused look.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Each and every one of you, prepare your faces, I’ll come and slap them one by one in a while!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan walked up.

Different from the natural smoothness in the past, this time, he appeared rather cautious and wary.

After all, it was his first time using a demonic attraction art.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence slowly flowed out, drawing out the wood chip in the first box.

That wood chip trembled shakily as if it could drop down at any time.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s demonic attraction art appeared very stiff. One look and it was new until he could not be any more newer of a novice.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help bursting into laughter.

“Haha, are you hitting our faces like this? Come on, my face is extended out, slap it!”

“Really ridiculous! Do you really think that learning and doing on the spot, you can learn our demon race’s demonic attraction art?”

“You’re also looking down on our demon race’s alchemy technique too much! If you can learn with one glance, then wouldn’t our thousands of years of bitter cultivation become a joke?”

...

Ye Yuan’s appearance immediately drew a burst of ridicule.

But toward this, he already could not hear it long ago.

His entire mind was currently placed on controlling the demonic divine essence.

Imitating and deducing was one thing, truly handling it was another thing. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The moment he started, he was still a little too unfamiliar.

However, Ye Yuan’s soul attracting art had long already reached its peak.

Ever since awakening the dragon soul, his twin divine souls were several times stronger than ordinary martial artists. His soul force was already incomparably boundless.

Hence, ever since after ascending to Divine Dao, he no longer worried about soul force anymore.

And this was also his guarantee for being able to refine high-level medicinal pills.

Demonic attraction art, even though it was Ye Yuan’s first time coming into contact with it, with the soul attracting art as the strategically advantageous position, he was absolutely not slow in getting started.

Sure enough, under Ye Yuan’s efforts, he finally drew out the wood chip in the second box and fused them together.

The first fusion, the difficulty was the lowest.

But as the number increased, the difficulty of merging would soar exponentially.

“Heh, the first one is so strenuous, I think he can at most fuse three.” Mu Yuanchun said with a cold laugh.

“Clearly a novice, yet still want to posture. Got struck by lightning now, right?”

“Just this bit of strength, actually still want to smack our faces. I really don’t know where his confidence came from.”

The moment Mu Yuanchun said this, everyone immediately concurred.

Completing the first fusion, Ye Yuan finally found some feel.

His control of demonic divine essence also finally became a little smoother.

Hence, he started fusing the third type of wood chip.

This time, it seemed to be a little easier than last time.

Following that, fourth type, fifth type, sixth type …

Everyone’s faces started to change.

What was this?

Logically speaking, the greater the number of fused wood chips, the greater the difficulty!

To a novice, this kind of difficulty was magnified infinitely.

But why did Ye Yuan give a feeling of understanding better and becoming more mellow?

This was too illogical!

In a twinkle, Ye Yuan fused more than a dozen types of wood chips. Furthermore, his speed seemed to be getting faster and faster.

Above, the three elders’ eyes gradually became brilliant.

The three of them exchanged glances, wishing to lift their heads to the sky and burst into laughter.

Such a terrifying genius was simply hard to encounter in a lifetime.

This kind of comprehension ability was simply terrifying to the extreme.

Mu Yuanchun’s expression became extremely ugly and he muttered, “Impossible! Impossible! He’s clearly a novice who doesn’t know the demonic attraction art at all, so how can he possibly fuse so many wood chips? Could it be that he did it on purpose just now? Actually, he knows the demonic attraction art? This brat is full of schemes!”
