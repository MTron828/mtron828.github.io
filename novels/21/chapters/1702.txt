Chapter 1706 Transaction

“Argh! My eyes!”

Jian Ping suddenly screamed, covering his eyes with his hands, and fell to the ground in pain.

This sudden turn of events made everyone stare dumbfoundedly in shock.

Jian Ping came in a threatening manner, but who would have expect that he only took a look at Ye Yuan and then collapsed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

What the hell was this?

Initially, Jian Yu had a pleased look. Suddenly seeing Jian Ping fall down, his entire person was in a daze.

He completely did not expect that the words he unintentionally said aroused Jian Ping’s curiosity.

Took a look just like that and he went blind!

“B-Big Brother, what’s wrong with you? Don’t scare me!” Jian Yu said with a look of shock.

“Pain! My eyes hurt!” Jian Ping screamed tragically.

Jian Yu had a petrified look, completely not knowing what had happened.

All around, the people emitted a series of exclamations.

“What happened? Just now, Jian Ping used the aura viewing art on that young man, right?”

“Isn’t his destiny unranked? How did Jian Ping become like this with one glance?”

“Why are we totally fine when we look at him? No, wait, I remembered, that young man said previously that Jian Yu’s aura viewing art is lacking, could it be ...”

“He even said that it’s because of this that Jian Yu’s eyes didn’t go blind! This ...”

...

The people abruptly startled awake. Previously, Ye Yuan said that Jian Yu’s eyes were not blinded, so his aura viewing art was still lacking!

Now, Jian Ping took one look at Ye Yuan and his eyes went blind!

Which was also to say that it was not that this young man’s destiny failed to enter the ranks, but because ... it was too strong!

What kind of destiny would be so strong?

That was at least ... imperial aura!

Everyone was incomparably shocked in their hearts. This young man before their eyes, could it be that he was in possession of the legendary imperial aura?

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Yu and said with a smile, “Looks like his skill is much more profound than yours, so ... he went blind. But you, you don’t even have the qualifications to be blinded.”

Jian Yu’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

He finally understood now what the words Ye Yuan said before meant.

He also finally understood why Big Brother would suddenly be like this.

“You ... You’re actually of the legendary imperial aura! This ... This is impossible!” Jian Yu cried out weirdly.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said helplessly, “I also don’t know whether or not it’s the imperial aura, because currently, no one can tell me yet.”

Regarding this, Ye Yuan was very speechless too.

He also wanted to know just what destiny he was. But sadly, even Jian Zhentao, such a powerful existence, directly went blind after taking a look.

Imperial aura was also just Jian Zhentao’s guess.

Jian Yu’s expression changed several times. These words ... sounded so arrogant!

But, if it was the imperial aura, the Profound Secrets Pavilion would treat him as a guest of honor.

Then this guy could not be offended anymore!

One had to know, people possessing imperial aura, barring no accidents, they would all be powerhouses who inspired awe in a region.

This kind of people, even the Jian Family had to make friends with him.

After all, Extreme Light Imperial City was just an imperial city. Even though it was the Jian Family’s territory, the strongest here was also merely Celestial Deity Realm only.

Making friends with future powerhouses, this was also an important reason for the Jian Family’s power.

Because they had ‘wisdom eyes,’ which others were not equipped with, that they knew how to make their choice.

At the same time, members of the Jian Family were also snobbish. If your destiny was lacking, they would not even be bothered to give you a glance.

Ye Yuan slowly walked in front of Jian Ping. Jian Yu’s face changed, and he said in panic, “W-What do you want to do? I’m warning you, my big brother is a member of the Profound Secrets Pavilion. If you dare to touch a single strand of hair of his, you absolutely can’t leave the city alive!”

Ye Yuan could not even be bothered to look at him. He knelt down and said to Jian Ping, “You’re called Jian Ping, right? How about we make a deal?”

Experiencing the initial-most pain, Jian Ping was already much better now. But his eyes could not open, shedding the same blood tears as Jian Zhentao.

How could he still not understand at this time that this young man in front of him was someone with extremely exuberant destiny!

But this guy blinded his eyes!

Whoosh!

Suddenly, Jian Ping launched an attack!

“Go to hell! Who wants to make a deal with you?!” Jian Ping said with a hideous grin.

This scene was too sudden, fast until everyone did not react to it.

All around were cries of exclamations.

“Sir, be careful!’

Zhang Haotian’s and Zhang Xiaoran’s faces turned ashen pale, crying out in shock.

Bang!

The floorboards cracked and debris flew everywhere.

The violent attack of a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord, how shocking was the commotion?

Everyone’s heart sunk to rock-bottom. They did not expect that Jian Ping was actually so despotic, to actually directly deal a killing blow.

Ye Yuan and Jian Ping were too close. Furthermore, the strength difference was enormous. Wanting to avoid was simply something impossible.

Under this punch, how could Ye Yuan still be alive?

“Hahaha, what dog-fart imperial aura? Isn’t he still beaten to death by me with one punch?” Jian Ping said with a savage laugh.

Ye Yuan blinding his eyes was equivalent to ruining his future. So how could he not be furious?

Moreover, this guy even broke his younger brother’s legs.

This kind of guy, even if he had an imperial aura, it would not do either!

“Sigh! Pity this young man, the legendary imperial aura!”

“He wanted to stand up for Zhang Haotian father and daughter, but he also doesn’t think about how powerful the Profound Secrets Pavilion is.”

“Someone who overestimates his own strength. A first-layered heaven Divine Lord was actually so close to a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord, what is it if not courting death?”

...

In the crowd, some people lamented, some people felt that Ye Yuan was too inexperienced.

Zhang Xiaoran’s legs turned soft, directly sitting down on the ground.

This sudden turn of events made her unable to stand.

“Your eyes suffered the backlash of Heavenly Dao. Even if cured, it’s also very hard to recover to the peak. Don’t you ... want to be cured?”

At this time, amidst the dust, a voice sounded out faintly.

Everyone had astonished faces. This kid ... was not dead?

How was this possible?

Jian Ping was currently laughing loudly without ceasing. Suddenly his smile froze on his face, a look of astonishment on his face.

“You ... How could you possibly not be dead?” Jian Ping said in shock.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’re still a bit too unskilled to want to kill me. At this time, you should be grateful that you’re a member of the Profound Secrets Pavilion. Otherwise ... you’re already a dead man. Uh, enough nonsense, we’d better talk about our deal. I’ll help you treat your eyes, but you brothers must swear a Heavenly Dao oath that you’re not allowed to find trouble with Zhang Haotian father and daughter again in the future.”

Jian Ping’s entire body trembled and he said, “You ... You can cure my eyes?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I can naturally cure it! In fact, I still have an objective for coming to Extreme Light Imperial City this time. It’s to help Jian Zhentao, Elder Jian, treat his eyes.”

Jian Ping trembled again and said in disbelief, “Elder Jian’s eyes, could it be because he used the aura viewing art on you?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right! This transaction, do you agree?”

Jian Ping’s heart was shocked until it could not be any greater.

Elder Jian answered the invitation of Riverluck Capital City the last time and went to host an auction. After coming back, his eyes went blind. Until now, it was not healed too.

But Jian Ping never thought that Elder Jian was actually blinded by looking at Ye Yuan!
