Chapter 1355: Wang Song Arrives!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang!

The teacup in Wang Song’s hands was directly crushed into fine powder by him.

“Ye Yuan? Good! Very good! There’s actually really someone who dares to climb on top of my head! I’ll let you know what’s called blood debts will be paid in blood!”

Wang Song gnashed his teeth in hatred, his two eyes virtually spitting fire.

If rage could kill, the Ye Yuan ten thousand miles away would have long been burned to death by him countless already.

He had just received intel from Jewelhill City’s City Lord Manor that his younger brother, Wang Su, and the Wang Family’s Two-star alchemist, Wang Xuanfeng, both died at the hands of a boy called Ye Yuan at Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower!

This news made Wang Song tremble with rage.

Wang Song was much older than Wang Su. To him, it could be said to be like a brother and father. The two brothers had very deep feelings.

Over 30 years ago, the family received Jewelhill City’s Wang Family’s request for help. It was even him who suggested to the family to let Wang Su bring Wang Xuanfeng over to assist.

This kind of small matter, he felt that letting Wang Su go and temper himself, it was to take over the position of family head in the future.

He did not expect that it claimed his brother’s little life.

As for him, his ambition did not lie in Brightraise City. A tiny little Wang Family could not trap him, this dragon hiding in deep waters.

“Come, men!” Wang Song roared furiously.

“My lord!” A manservant entered and answered carefully.

“Prepared a flying dragon divine colt for me, right now! Immediately! At once!”

The manservant’s expression changed, and he repeatedly voiced his assent.

The flying dragon divine colt was a divine beast, its speed several dozen times faster than the flying dragon colt, incomparably precious.

Even in the entire Brightraise City, there were only less than five. Three of them belonged to the City Lord Manor.

Wang Song asked for the flying dragon divine colt straight away. It could be seen how furious he was at this moment.

Before long, a person and a mount galloped, akin to a sharp sword, rushing out of Brightraise City.

...

After the Wang Family disappeared from Jewelhill City, Jewelhill City entered a strangely peaceful period.

City Lord Manor was abnormally low-key, low-key until it was as if it did not exist.

Regarding the matter of Wang Su being killed, they did not even let out a fart.

Of course, they did not have the face to let it out either.

As for Ye Yuan, he entered a state of closed-seclusion once more.

Inside the World Suppressing Stele, Ye Yuan was currently assaulting late-stage Grotto Profound in full force. In a blink, it was half a year’s time.

However, Ye Yuan discovered to his dismay that this was not an easy matter.

The Essence Cultivating Pills were not enough for him to consume at all! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Essence Cultivating Pills consumed by his cultivation alone could virtually be put on par with the Essence Cultivating Pills sold by the Myriad Treasure Tower.

The spirit medicines to refine the Essence Cultivating Pill were naturally much more expensive than the Divine Essence Pill.

Even if backed by the Myriad Treasure Tower, this kind of major faction, it was also not possible to supply Ye Yuan’s limitless consumption.

In desperation, Ye Yuan could only rely on absorbing heaven and earth spiritual energy to cultivate.

It was just that this way, the progress was undoubtedly much slower.

“Just what kind of cultivation method did I create? This is simply a bottomless hole! No matter how many divine essence stones, it also can’t afford this kind of expenditure!” After cultivating, Ye Yuan said to Dustless with a bitter smile.

Dustless was long numb already and said coolly, “Stop showing off your cleverness after coming off cheap! Once this cultivation method of yours circulates out, the entire Heavenspan World is bound to be shocked. It can’t dispense with a bout of sanguinary slaughter. Right now, even if you absorb heaven and earth spiritual energy to cultivate, the speed is also ten times faster than others.”

Ye Yuan said, “Although it’s like that, this consumption is truly too costly as well. It looks like the majority of my effort in the future will still have to be placed on earning divine essence stones!”

Dustless nodded and said, “That’s true. As long as there are sufficient resources, your cultivation speed is simply outrageous to hear. The things that other people use a thousand years to be able to accomplish, you only need a hundred years, and it’s enough!”

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Looks like you have to go to Wu Meng Capital City as soon as possible. Jewelhill City is too small. Even if one has divine essence stones, they can’t buy so many resources either!”

Dustless also said, “Mm, it’s time to leave. However ... that Liang Family’s little lass, how do you plan on handling this?”

Ye Yuan froze, thought about it, and said, “Bring along then. I’ve offended all of Jewelhill City’s major factions. I can’t rest easy leaving her behind here. With Chen Yongnian’s personality, he might vent the anger on her.”

Dustless said, “Mm, may as well. That lass’s looks are pretty good. If you like, taking her in works too. Us cultivators, what does a few more Dao companions count as?”

Ye Yuan’s face turned black, and he said, “Not saving Lingxue, this Ye won’t marry for life! Senior, don’t say this kind of words anymore.”

But Dustless said with a smile that was not a smile, “Then if come one day, you really bring that girl back?”

Ye Yuan could not help choking when he heard that, falling silent.

This question, he had never considered it before.

Perhaps, he was unwilling to consider.

...

Boom!

Myriad Treasure Tower’s front door was blasted by someone with one punch.

“Have Ye Yuan scram outside for this city lord! Otherwise, I, Wang Song, will tear this Myriad Treasure Tower down today!”

Half a year already passed; Wang Song finally rushed to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

His actions immediately drew countless people to surround and watch.

Wang Song’s aura billowed to the sky, the strength of late-stage Heaven Glimpse erupting without a doubt.

He was so simple and crude. He did not need any reason at all.

He was here to kill people!

Blood for blood!

“Who is this person? What powerful strength!”

“Yeah, this person is late-stage Heaven Glimpse realm; even stronger than City Lord, His Excellency! When did the Myriad Treasure Tower provoke such a powerful existence again?”

“Ah, I remember! Wang Song, isn’t he that Wang Su’s elder brother? He’s here to take revenge!”

...

Wang Song did not hide anything. Very soon, someone guessed his identity and was extremely shocked.

Brightraise City’s deputy city lord actually rushed straight to Jewelhill City.

Brightraise City and Jewelhill City were extremely far away. Even riding a flying dragon colt, one trip also needed two to three year’s time.

Now, just half a year passed, Wang Song actually rushed over already.

Wang Song stirring up such a huge commotion, it naturally alarmed the Myriad Treasure Tower’s people.

Very soon, Yang Rui appeared.

His brows furrowed and he said solemnly, “Wang Song, what’s the meaning of this? Could it be that you think my Myriad Treasure Tower is easy to bully?”

Wang Song said coolly, “The Myriad Treasure Tower isn’t easy to bully, but ... Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower is very easy to bully! You’re Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s tower lord, right? Hand over Ye Yuan. Otherwise, this Wang will demolish your lousy tower today!”

Wang Song’s aura was threatening, not putting Yang Rui in his sights at all.

Yang Rui’s bit of strength was not even enough to fill the crevices between his teeth.

Yang Rui was livid with rage and said grimly, “If I don’t hand over the person?”

Wang Song’s eyes narrowed. A cold light flashed past. Raising his hand, it was a palm!

Yang Rui did not expect Wang Song to attack at once. Caught unprepared, he only felt a surge of power that toppled mountains and overturned the seas crush over towards him.

Bang!

Virtually without the least bit of strength to retaliate, Yang Rui was smashed flying.

Wang Song was brimming with killing intent as he said solemnly, “This palm is considered a lesson. Don’t think that I really don’t dare to kill you! In front of me, you’re no different from an ant! Even if I really kill you, what can the Myriad Treasure Tower do to me?”

Wang Song was incomparably overbearing, not putting the Myriad Treasure Tower in his eyes at all.

Indeed, with his identity, he did not need to fear the Myriad Treasure Tower at all!
