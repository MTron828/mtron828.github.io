Chapter 3017: Saint Force!

“Although they all became like this, the blood race’s understanding of true spirit bloodlines has clearly reached an extremely profound level! Now that they have obtained the four clans’ chaos grade bloodlines, the time for the Chaos Bloodstone to come into being will probably be greatly shortened!”

Finished inspecting the bloodline warrior, Ye Yuan had a solemn look on his face as he said.

It was true that these bloodline warriors were defective goods. But their combat strength had soared significantly!

Especially Zhao Yue, his strength approached Supreme Hegemon!

This kind of method could not be accomplished casually.

Mi Tian said, “I don’t have confidence in beating that Blood Two!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Just a clone is already so strong? Senior, then do you feel that he can really transcend the Great?Beyond1?”

Mi Tian smiled bitterly and said, “Whether or not he can transcend the Great Beyond, nobody knows either! There was once a Great Beyond powerhouse who attempted to pass through the Door of Eternal Life, but the price was perishing and his Dao dissipated! Therefore, everyone guesses that only by completely pushing open the Door of Eternal Life can one reach the Great Beyond! But this is also merely a speculation, that’s all! Because nobody can push open the Door of Eternal Life fully! Samsara that old thing should be about there. If the Chaos Bloodstone comes into being, I think he can do it too! As for whether or not he can transcend the Great Beyond, there’s no way of knowing!”

Great Beyond powerhouses were existences that pushed open the Door of Eternal Life!

The moment the Door of Eternal Life opened, Hegemon Realm powerhouses would be able to communicate with Heavenly Dao. Every movement and action carried a sacred aura.

Therefore, their strength was significantly greater than Hegemon Realms.

However, the vast majority of Great Beyond powerhouses only pushed half of the door open.

Meanwhile, the powerhouses who pushed open the other half as well were all the strongest existences in this world[2.To clarify, olden days manors in ancient China have massive doors that were made up of left and right sides. You’ll have to push up both sides in order to fully open the ‘door’.]!

Only those who reached this realm, could truly have the qualifications to pursue transcendence.

Mi Tian was currently pushing open the other half of the Door of Eternal Life. Therefore, his strength was stronger than Hegemon Kong Nie and Hegemon Qian Yu!

“But, what’s certain is that, once the Door of Eternal Life is completely opened, one’s strength will definitely have a qualitative leap! At that time, I’m afraid that Samsara that old thing won’t be his match anymore either!” Mi Tian added on.

Ye Yuan sighed and said, “Having obtained the four great chaos grade bloodlines, there’s practically no suspense in him completely pushing open the Door of Eternal Life!”

Mi Tian’s pupils constricted, and he said, “What have you found?”

Bloodline power emerged from Ye Yuan’s body, a vortex formed in his hand, and a sacred aura transmitted over.

Mi Tian cried out in surprise, “Saint force! You … You can actually utilize saint force!”

Opening the first seal, Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses would be able to mobilize the aura of the Door of Eternal Life to fight the enemy.

But it was also merely being stained with a trace of aura, that was all.

Even if it was Hegemon Realm powerhouses, they were unable to employ saint force too!

Only by pushing open the Door of Eternal Life, becoming a Great Beyond powerhouse, could one use saint force!

But Ye Yuan was just Emperor Vast Heaven, and he could actually utilize saint force already. How could he not be shocked?

Long Jian also said in shock, “What? This … This is saint force? I even thought that …”

Mi Tian nodded and said, “Although it’s very weak, it’s saint force. No mistake about it! The two auras are very similar, but the power is poles apart! It’s also no wonder that you didn’t discover it too!”

When Ye Yuan defeated Long He with one punch, Long Jian felt this power too.

At that time, he only thought that the move was tainted with the aura of the Door of Eternal Life. But he did not expect that that was genuine saint force!

Ye Yuan said, “My dragon race bloodline hasn’t reached peak heaven qian grade yet, so the saint force is still very weak. But the Chaos Bloodstone obtained four great chaos bloodlines. Most likely … its power is unimaginable!”

Mi Tian drew a deep breath and said with a bitter smile, “Who could have thought that after the four great chaos bloodlines fuse together, it will actually have such a terrifying effect? With this, it’s really troublesome!”

The four great true spirit bloodlines could not be fused at all!

Therefore, for countless years, nobody could find the connection.

But there were always exceptions in this world.

The Chaos Bloodstone was similarly born from chaos. Furthermore, it innately comprehended the most fundamental origin of blood!

Only he could perfectly fuse the four great true spirit bloodlines together!

Of course, Ye Yuan was similarly an exception.

He used the Dao sword to fuse with the origin of blood and virtually possessed the same ability as the Chaos Bloodstone.

“Sigh,?there’s no news from those three old fellows at all. Now, there’s half-chaos bloodlines appearing. Most likely . .. they are fraught with grim possibilities! If the four of our strengths are gathered, we might have some way to deal with the Chaos Bloodstone,” Mi Tian said with a sigh.

“It’s not necessarily impossible!” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Mi Tian’s eyes lit up and he said, “You have a way to find them?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “It’s not finding them, but that I discovered that chaos grade bloodline might not be insurmountable. It’s just that the conditions are a little too harsh! If there’s a chance, maybe I can upgrade all four bloodlines to chaos grade!”

“What?! Kid, food can be anyhow eaten, but words can’t be anyhow said! Chaos grade bloodline has never been born post-natal for countless years! On what basis can you reach chaos grade?” Long Jian cried out in surprise.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “In the past, there wasn’t. But it doesn’t mean that there won’t be in the future! Then have you seen before an Emperor Vast Heaven that can utilize saint force in the past?”

Long Jian choked and was immediately rendered speechless.

He was caught off-guard by this posturing.

“This … This is different! According to you, then wouldn’t each of us from the true spirit race be able to become chaos true spirits?” Long Jian argued fiercely.

“In theory, that’s the case! It’s just that I also said earlier, the conditions are very harsh. The blood race had done research for more than 100 thousand years on Blood Dragon Island. In my view, it’s probably for this! Furthermore, they should have achieved great results. Just look at Zhao Yue, and you’ll know. But what they pursue is combat power. As for the rest, they don’t care at all.” Ye Yuan said.

Long Jian and Mi Tian could not help being speechless. However, they felt that what Ye Yuan said was very likely.

Zhao Yue was originally just an origin powerhouse. He was not even at the Hegemon Realm.

But now, his combat power approached Supreme Hegemon!

This kind of leap was simply unimaginable when placed in ordinary times.

But the blood race did it, didn’t they?

“You fused the origin of blood and also gained enlightenment in the Eternal River. Now, you also fused together the four races’ bloodlines. Perhaps, you’re the biggest variable in this calamity! Therefore, if you need any help, feel free to speak up,” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Right now, there’s really something that I need Senior to help with.”

“Speak.”

“Senior, please send some powerhouses to follow me and charge back to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

Mi Tian was taken aback and said with a smile, “Right, it’s about time. You should go back! Long Jian, bring some people and go along with him.”

At this time, the bloodline warrior on the ground slowly got up, looking at the surrounding scenery, a blank look on his face.

But very soon, he seemed to have remembered something. Kneeling before Ye Yuan with a thud, he cried bitterly as he said, “Your Excellency’s grace of rebirth, Jiang Zhennan will engrave it in my heart! From now on, this lowly one’s life is Your Excellency’s!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

By the side, Long Jian was incomparably shocked.

This bloodline warrior actually regained his mental faculties!

The heavenly pill that Ye Yuan refined was actually so magical?
