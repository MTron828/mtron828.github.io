Chapter 2410: Give You Ten Breaths!

“Sword of Spacetime, go!”

While everyone was still shocked, Ye Yuan struck again with a sword.

But this time, the target locked onto Li Qing!

Yuan Zhen’s expression changed wildly, having the mind to save, but could not muster up the courage.

What would he use to save?

Li Qing felt that every hair on his body was standing up. He did not have time to think too much, turning tail and running.

Except, the Sword of Spacetime was too fast, how could it give him the chance to flee?

Swish!

The light sword flashed past lightly, Li Qing was similarly decapitated.

Yuan Zhen saw it clearly, the cuts on Li Qing and Tian Zhao’s wounds were extremely flat, not even a trace of blood flowed out.

As if that place was sealed by some kind of mysterious power.

He understood that this wound was blocked off by the power of spacetime, and would never heal.

This kind of murdering method was far more terrifying than a blade wound.

If Ye Yuan were to chop at a vital spot, it would directly kill.

If it sliced his finger previously, then his finger would never be able to grow out anymore.

Thinking up to here, Yuan Zhen finally gave rise to the thought of withdrawing.

Staying here was just waiting for death!

When the Divine Children Legion’s warriors saw this scene, each of them was dumbfounded with shock.

Ye Yuan killed two great Nine-marks powerhouses as if chopping vegetables!

When did Nine-marks powerhouses become so weak?

No, wait. It was not that Nine-marks powerhouses were weak, but that Ye Yuan was too strong!

Fusing three great power of laws, this sword move could virtually cut everything in the world!

Just as everyone was in a state of disbelief, Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum suddenly withdrew, his realm being fixed at peak World Realm!

He looked towards Yuan Zhen with a slight smile and said coolly, “Don’t your divine race call yourselves the messengers of Heavenly Dao, looking down on myriad races? Now, I’m going to jump realms and kill you! Give you ten breaths, whether or not you can escape will depend on your ability.”

Then, he took out a bow and arrow unhurriedly.

Limitless God Killing Bow!

A surging power of Great Dao assaulted everyone’s minds.

In the past, Ye Yuan’s realm was lacking and could not unleash the true power of a Dao artifact at all.

Now, even though he did not reach Deva Realm yet, he already had strength comparable to Deva Realm.

When he used the Limitless God Killing Bow again, the power long already could not be mentioned in the same breath!

The power of a Dao artifact coupled with the Sword of Spacetime, it was simply ever-victorious!

Seeing the Limitless God Killing Bow, Yuan Zhen’s pair of huge eyes almost popped out.

The threat of death hit him head-on!

Flee or not to flee?

This was a difficult problem!

If he fled, Ye Yuan’s words were too impudent. Where would his face as a divine child go?

Not fleeing, the power of a Dao artifact plus the Sword of Spacetime, he would be simply powerless to resist it.

Even if he used Heavenly Dao True Martial!

This was really a huge irony!

Ye Yuan actually said this kind of words to a Nine-marks divine son with Heavenly Emperor Realm.

And he was actually still hesitating!

But Wan Zhen and the rest had their faces flush red.

This kind of heroic feeling really made people’s hot blood burn with righteous indignation!

Ye Yuan’s sentence completely recovered their lost confidence!

Before this, they were really wrecked by the divine children army.

The Divine Children Legion’s might completely exceeded their imagination.

If not for Ye Yuan, they completely would not have been able to imagine what this battle would have been like.

“Hahaha ... Awesome! So what if they are of the divine race?”

“As long as our power of laws reaches a certain realm, we can similarly look down on you!”

“That lord Nine-marks, are you fighting or running?”

... ...

On the humans’ side, came endless ridiculing voices.

Yuan Zhen kept harping that they were trash, ants, they were long already unhappy.

But the strength that Yuan Zhen exhibited previously was too strong, making them not have the chance to say anything at all.

But now, it was different.

Ye Yuan saying this kind of word with the realm of Heavenly Emperor was really too satisfying and delightful!

Listening to the taunting coming from over there, Yuan Zhen’s face became gloomy to the extreme.

But on this side, Ye Yuan could not be bothered with his reaction, and he already started counting down.

“Ten!”

“Nine!”

“Eight!”

... ...

Each count was like a death-hastening curse, striking on Yuan Zhen’s heart.

Finally, when it counted down to seven, he could not stand it anymore and ran wildly!

Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm coupled with Heavenly Dao True Martial, how fast was the speed?

In virtually an instant, Yuan Zhen’s figure disappeared.

It was as if Ye Yuan did not see it, still counting down.

“Six!”

“Five!”

... ...

His voice spread extremely far, no matter where Yuan Zhen ran to, it could reach his ears accurately.

The laws of time and space were no joke.

This kind of method to transmit one’s voice through space was not considered very high-level.

But when Yuan Zhen listened to it, it was totally not the case.

These continuous countdowns were like claps of thunder, sounding out in his ears.

Over these countless years, how many tens of millions of life-and-death battles had he experienced before?

But not once did he feel so hopeless like now before.

At this time, he wished that his parents had given him two more feet, so that he could run a little faster.

He urged his physical body to the limit, trying to run a little faster.

In reality, he ran fast enough too.

But, he still felt that it was not fast enough!

“Three!”

“Two!”

“One!”

When he heard ‘one’, Yuan Zhen had already escaped no idea how far away from Ye Yuan.

But these words still exploded in his ears!

Then, he felt a terrifying aura erupt behind him.

This aura drew closer and closer, and increasingly stronger!

He desperately wanted to increase his speed, but that aura was still continuously closing in.

Then, that aura disappeared.

He discovered that he was still fine!

“Hahaha ... I escaped! I escaped! Brat, scaring me is it? How can I, Yuan Zhen, die that easily?”

He could not resist turning his head to take a look.

All of a sudden, he froze.

When he turned back, he saw his lower body!

His body below his neck was already separated from his head!

“I ... I died?”

Then, his consciousness slowly became blurry.

This sword was too fast, he did not feel pain at all and was already beheaded.

Normally, this sword was not sufficient to be fatal.

But, spacetime law seemed to isolate everything, cutting off all connections between his upper body and lower body.

His life force was rapidly dissipating.

Finally, it disappeared.

Ye Yuan slowly retracted his bow. That appearance was like he had done something insignificant.

The whole place was deathly silent.

The powerful Heavenly Dao True Martial was actually defeated!

Seven breaths of time were enough for Yuan Zhen to flee a distance of several tens of millions of miles.

But Ye Yuan killed him with just one sword!

Suffocatingly strong!

The divine race never feared the human race.

They were proud and arrogant!

Even if they lost the Doomsday Battle to the humans, they also would not feel that they were worse than humans.

But today, they felt terrified facing Ye Yuan!

This human’s might already exceeded their understanding.

Ye Yuan put away the Limitless God Killing Bow. Looking at the Divine Children Legion which covered the sky, he said coolly toward Wan Zhen and the others, “Stop looking, continue!”

“Kill!”

The Divine Children Legion was still in a daze when Wan Zhen and the others already roared loudly and charged over.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
