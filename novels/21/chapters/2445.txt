Chapter 2451: Have You Given Up?

“Brat, don’t run if you have the capabilities! If you’re a man, have an open and above-board fight with this old man” Celestial Master Miluo roared angrily.

He already unleashed all of his abilities and even employed Heavenly Dao True Martial.

His Heavenly Dao True Martial could predict his opponent’s next move, and it was extremely accurate.

It was just a pity that it was completely useless against Ye Yuan.

He could never determine where Ye Yuan would appear in the next second!

Using coming and going like a shadow to describe Ye Yuan could not be more apt.

And the space that he sealed off was completely useless against Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan could always escape his lockdown easily.

Celestial Master Miluo was practically going insane.

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly when he heard that and said, “Old fogey, pretending to be a man with me? If you have the capabilities, suppress your cultivation realm to the initial-stage Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm. I guarantee that I’ll beat you until even your mum can’t recognize you!”

The corners of Celestial Master Miluo’s mouth twitched slightly, almost exploding.

With Ye Yuan’s combat power, if he was in the same realm, he could only be crushed!

He became completely demotivated!

Unable to hit him and also could not win in a quarrel, how to play?

By the side, Yue Mengli’s gaze flickered indeterminately, not knowing what she was thinking about either.

However, she did not make a move all along, just quietly watching.

Right then, a voice slowly came from the cave.

“Miluo, let him enter. You can’t deal with him.”

Miluo’s expression changed slightly. Finally, he still gritted his teeth unwillingly and said, “Yes!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a faint smile, “Continue blaming yourself then. It’s best that ... you blame yourself for another ten billion years. At that time, perhaps your crimes can be lessened a little. Uh ... of course, if you stop condemning yourself, I’ll lend you a helping hand in the future.”

Finished saying, he walked away, leaving behind Miluo who had an angry expression.

Yue Mengli hesitated for a moment and also followed into the cave.

She led Ye Yuan through the cave.

Ahead, an archaic aura that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life hit him head-on.

This kind of aura seemed to be like an eternal existence as if overriding above all life!

The further ahead he went, the more Ye Yuan felt an archaic aura, which simply made people prostrate in worship!

Gradually, an underground hall entered Ye Yuan’s eyes.

A tall and straight back currently had his back facing Ye Yuan, kneeling in front of the eight god statues.

Ye Yuan raised his eyes and glanced at the eight god statues, and his mind was shocked!

At this moment, that kind of aura that towered above all life was exceptionally strong.

The eight god statues seemed to have souls, they were looking at him too!

Those gazes attacked straight at the heart!

At this moment, Ye Yuan actually had an impulse to worship!

These eight god statues wanted to make him submit!

Ye Yuan’s mind shook greatly, hurriedly mustering the Heavenly Dao power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, to deal with this power.

Swoosh!

That man who had his back facing Ye Yuan suddenly launched an attack at this moment, throwing a punch over!

In a blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

The terrifying pressure was virtually crushing Ye Yuan into a meat-pancake, making him feel asphyxiated!

Too strong!

However, Ye Yuan’s reaction was extremely fast too, immediately urging spatial law!

Boom!

The place where Ye Yuan was standing, there was a violent tremor in space.

But the current Ye Yuan switched positions with that man!

The man’s attack missing, he did not pursue, but withdraw his aura instead and stood with his hands behind his back, sizing Ye Yuan up with interest.

“Well-deserving of being Saint Azure! This ancestor’s attack, even if a Dao Ancestor was here, it would be too late to avoid it too! I didn’t expect that you could actually resist the heavenly might of the eight gods and avoid this strike of mine! I’m very curious. How did you do it?” The man said with a faint smile.

This strike earlier, he did not hold back!

Furthermore, this place had the blessing of the eight god statues, the space was extremely stable.

Under such a space, wanting to use spatial law to evade attacks was doubly difficult.

Let alone that the eight god statues’ heavenly might was irresistible.

Even if a Dao Ancestor was here, they would surely be affected too.

This strike earlier was absolutely a certain-kill blow in the eyes of the man.

Who would have expected that Ye Yuan actually still evaded it!

Ye Yuan frowned and looked at the man and said, “You’re Tian Qing?”

The man said coolly, “That’s right. It’s precisely this ancestor! Speaking of which, this ancestor still has to thank you. If not for you restoring the chaotic spacetime, this ancestor will probably still be exiled in the spacetime turbulence.”

This man was the divine race sovereign who made the Heavenspan World tremble, the one and only Ten-marks powerhouse. He was Tian Qing!

This blow earlier looked simple, but actually, it was incredibly lethal!

Ye Yuan deeply felt his power!

Because that strike earlier, it actually affected his chaos world!

The current Ye Yuan had his vital energy and blood surging, the chaos world being in havoc.

It could be seen to what degree the power of this punch was strong until!

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised in his heart and said with a sigh, “I still underestimated the heroes of the world! The force of his fist already reached the level of Dao and can affect my chaos world through spatial nodes! Truly inconceivable!”

Fortunately, Tian Qing did not have the intention of continuing to attack. Otherwise, whether or not he could walk out of the Abyss World was still unknown!

Clearly, Tian Qing was wary of Ye Yuan too.

Earlier, he was just testing a little, to see if Ye Yuan was really as impressive as the rumors.

If he really killed Ye Yuan, it would naturally be over.

Who would have thought that he actually still failed?

Ye Yuan could not even be killed in the ancestral land, it went even more without saying outside.

However, by the side, Celestial Master Miluo and Yue Mengli were dumbfounded with shock.

Especially Celestial Master Miluo, his mouth opened wide, and could not close for a long time.

He had never seen Tian Qing fail before!

Even if facing Grand Ancestor Spacetime back then, Tian Qing’s attacks would never miss too!

No one could avoid his punch!

The Grand Ancestor Spacetime who comprehended spacetime law to the extreme, could not either!

But Ye Yuan actually evaded it!

How shocking was this?

In his view, Ye Yuan entering the ancestral land was completely an act of seeking death.

But who knew that even the divine race’s strongest, Tian Qing, could not do anything to Ye Yuan.

Was this guy really so amazing?

The fact was, he really was!

“Humph! No need to say thanks. One day, I’ll personally kill you with my own hands!” Ye Yuan said with a cold snort.

But when Tian Qing heard that, he laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha ... someone capable of killing me, there wasn’t any in the past, and there also won’t be any in the future! To tell you the truth, unless these eight gods come to life, otherwise, no one in the Heavenspan World can kill me! I know that your talent is very strong, but it’s useless! This ancestor is undying and imperishable. You can’t kill me! In the future, at best, this ancestor will dread you to some extent. That’s all!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Is that so? Then let’s wait and see!”

Tian Qing shook his head slightly, seemingly not willing to argue about this.

His confidence stemmed from his strength that was powerful until it was heaven-defying.

He had the qualifications to be arrogant!

“You came for Little Li. Do you understand it now?”

Tian Qing looked at Ye Yuan and said smilingly, “My divine race is a race favored by heaven! These eight gods are precious gifts from heaven, letting us stand above all life! Little Li is someone of the divine race. She’s proud of being a member of the divine race, and she’ll also fight for the divine race! So, have you given up?”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
