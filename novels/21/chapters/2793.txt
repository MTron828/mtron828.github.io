Chapter 2799: Killing True Sovereign!

“Hahaha... Foolish human, you can’t kill us!”

After a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven revived, he laughed wildly

and said to Ye Yuan.

The blood race’s revival from a drop of blood had a great impact on humans.

An opponent that could not be killed was sufficient to make people’s will

collapse!

Is that so? Isn’t your revivals getting increasingly slower?

Ye Yuan laughed coldly, suddenly pulling back his divine essence. The Universe

Sword Formation immediately disappeared.

Sure enough, just as he talked, he killed many times in a row, the recovery

speed of these blood race members clearly became much slower.

Dragon might overflowed from Ye Yuan’s body!

Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist!

Ye Yuan threw a punch out, directly slamming onto a cloud of blood mist.

That cloud of blood mist directly turned into nothingness.

With this, the world became clean.

The pupils of that grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven shrunk, and he

cried out in alarm, “This. How is this possible?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Is there anyone who can’t be killed in this world? It’s just

that your numbers are a lot, so I was wearing you all down first!

Done talking, he slammed another punch out, obliterating another blood race

member again.

In terms of large-area attacking means, the Universe Sword Formation was

indeed unparalleled. It could magnify Ye Yuan’s strength several times over.

But in terms of single- target attack, the Universe Sword Formation was

inferior to the Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist.

Presently, Ye Yuan’s bloodline evolved into battle spirit level true dragon

bloodline. The power that this move erupted with was dozens of times of his

power!

Furthermore, this power was concentrated in a single point, the destructive

power extremely strong

It was perfect for obliterating the blood race.

Ye Yuan dealt a punch each, the numbers of the blood race could be seen

reducing ata speed visible to the naked eye.

Boom!

That grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven was also directly obliterated by

one punch.

In the depths of the fog, Han Guang’s expression changed.

He could sense through bloodline that his subordinates were vanishing one by

one at an extremely fast speed.

“What’s wrong, Lord Han Guang? It’s merely a few Saint Sovereign Heavens.

Could it be that Mie Chen can’t take care of it?

Chile’s perception was lacking, but seeing Han Guang’s expression, he

immediately understood something.

A hint of shock flashed across Han Guang’s eyes, and he said, “There’s only

Mie Chen alone left!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

What?! Could it be . a True Sovereign Heaven? Chile’s shock was by no means

insignificant

Han Guang shook his head and said, “One half-step True Sovereign Heaven,

the others are all ordinary Saint Sovereign Heavens, there isn’t even a grand

completion one. Mn?Mie Chen died too!”

This time, Han Guang was really shocked.

Died too quickly!

It was less than 15 minutes from start to end.

Unless the blood race encountered an opponent whose strength greatly

exceeds their own, they would never die so quickly.

The half-step True Sovereign Heaven Mie Chen could practically capture same

rank opponents with ease.

Even if he encountered a monster from the human race, he could always run

away if he could not beat.

Now, they were all dead!

“No can do! They are going to pass through the fog! They already know that

we’re lying in ambush here. If they bring this news over, then all of our

previous efforts will be wasted! Chile, you bring people over to kill them! No,

everyone move out! You must kill them!”

“These blood race members made a surprise attack on you all. They have

probably already discovered you guys. There might be a great conspiracy for

them to lie in ambush here!” Mi Tian.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “In this case, we have to bring the news to Heaven

One Continent and inform the humans there!”

Ye Yuan also did not expect to actually run into this sort of thing before

entering Heaven One Continent.

Those that came out to ambush them already had a half-step True Sovereign

Heaven Realm. There was probably a True Sovereign Heaven existence in the

depths of the fog!

“Retreat!

Ye Yuan shouted coldly, his figure retreating explosively.

“It’s too late!

A figure came out of the void and struck a palm towards Yang Qing.

This palm was incredibly fearsome. It was precisely Chile!

“ARGH!Why is it me again? F*ck, I’m not the strongest, you idiot!”

Yang Qing cried out strangely, but his figure dodged bizarrely and actually

avoided this certain-kill strike!

Chile’s pupils constricted, looking at Yang Qing rather astonishedly.

This half-step True Sovereign Heaven actually evaded his charged blow.

However

After getting a shock, a hint of a cruel smile flashed across the corners of

Chile’s mouth.

This move of his was not a killing move at all!

The real killing move was Han Guang

Right at this instant, the five people withdrew out of the fog

And right at this moment, a large palm fell from the sky!

The power was completely incomparable to Chile!

The lethal blow of a middle True Sovereign Heaven was akin to doomsday to a

Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Nowhere to avoid!

“Really dead for sure this time!” Yang Qing cried out strangely.

Big Yellow and the rest could not even move a muscle under this palm!

Han Guangs strength was completely not on the same level as Chile’s.

Above the void, Han Guang was expressionless.

Killing a few Saint Sovereign Heavens was merely a matter of lifting a hand to

him.

Even if they were half-step True Sovereign Heavens, they would be inadequate

too.

But right at this time, an incomparably terrifying force suddenly burst forth

beneath his palm.

This power made him feel heart palpitations.

Chile’s face originally carried a mocking smile. But at this time, his expression

changed wildly.

Commander Han Guang, be careful!”

Yet, it was already too late!

This astonishing sword directly chopped apart the giant palm, heading straight

for his main body.

This sword shone with boundless radiance and was extremely dazzling, forcing

everyone until they could not open their eyes!

When this sword appeared, it seemed as if it was going to chop the firmament!

Chile, who was not far away, his breathing was about to stop.

Pfft!

Han Guang’s body was actually directly smashed by this sword!

Everyone present opened their mouths wide, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

This sword was released by Ye Yuan!

No one would have thought that a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven would kill a

middle True Sovereign Heaven with one sword!

He directly crossed a large realm to kill the enemy!

This sword already surpassed cultivation realm!

This. Lord Han Guang was actually killed by one sword? w-What kind of joke

is this?

“What a dazzling sword! Is this human really middle Saint SovereignHeaven?

“Earlier, I thought that the strongest was that half-step True Sovereign

Heaven; 1 didn’t expect that it’s this unremarkable fellow!

Before this sword move, nobody took Ye Yuan seriously.

Among the five people, Ye Yuan was not even as good as Jingfei.

But this sword made Ye Yuan seemingly look dazzling to the extreme.

Dao sword!

The strongest sword that Ye Yuan unleashed, the power was far more powerful

than the A1-Encompassing Sacred Tree’s Sword of Heaven Killing!

This was Ye Yuan’s sword of defying Dao, all of his comprehensions in this life.

Similarly, it was a sword that was unleashed using his life!

After unleashing a sword, Ye Yuan’s complexion was pale to the extreme, like a

living dead.

“Big Yellow

Ye Yuan shouted coldly. Actually, there was no need for his order. Big Yellow

already carried Ye Yuan and scurried into the fog again.

And everyone was still in shock.

No one even went to stop them.

Yang Qing three people had long known about Ye Yuan’s trump card and also

followed after instantly.

Above the void, that cloud of blood mist that was smashed apart by Ye Yuan

attempted to condense together.

But it could not do it!

Under this sword’s slash, the blood race actually found it difficult to revive!

Chile and the rest actually forgot to chase for a moment.

“Commander Han Guang, are you alright?” Chile asked worriedly.

Finally, that cloud of blood mist recondensed.

Han Guang was alarmed and furious to the extreme, shouting loudly, “Chase!

What are you all in a daze for?”
