Chapter 2877 How Could There Be Such an Impressive Person in the World!

Yang Qing made an unnecessary fuss, but very soon, he discovered that something was not right.

Too quiet!

The battle hunting ground had several hundred thousand watching the fights. Why was it so quiet?

Seeing Ye Yuan looking at him with a smile that was not a smile, Yang Qing only felt somewhat jittery and said, “W-What did you

do?”

Yang Qing already understood Ye Yuan long ago. One should not look at how this guy normally kept quiet, appearing too profound to understand.

But, when he caused trouble, ten Yang Qings could not catch up either!

Ever since this guy landed on Heaven One Continent, how many earth-shaking major events had he done already?

Motherf*cker, looking at his appearance, it looks like today’s trouble was not small again!

“Nothing, it’s just that … I killed all the geniuses in my passageway. Uh, these guys were too weak. There’s no kick in killing at all,” Ye Yuan said with some dissatisfaction.

Everyone was speechless.

No kick and you still killed so many!

You’re simply the devil!

My blood race is bloodthirsty, but it simply does not hold a candle compared to you at all!

It was also just that there was three days’ time. If Ye Yuan was given a few more days, everyone would not doubt in the slightest that this guy could kill off all the people in the number one passageway! “W-What did you say? K-Killed all? What kind of joke is this!” Yang Qing’s eyes became wide-saucers, a look of disbelief on his face.

He knew that Ye Yuan was very strong but did not know how strong the current Ye Yuan was. This result was really too surprising!

Killing everyone in a passageway, what did this mean?

This signified genuine invincibility in the same rank!

Saint Sovereign Heaven, no matter how impressive you were, you could not post any threat to Ye Yuan anymore!

Thinking about his own battle achievement, he actually showed off in front of him.

Uh … was this not him slapping his own face?

But very soon, he understood why Ye Yuan did so.

Really satisfying!

If this news reached back to South Qi Giant City, the Heaven One that had just calmed down would explode again, right?

Yang Qing gave Ye Yuan a big thumbs up and said with a strange expression, “You’re amazing!”

“Hahaha, I finally got a spot! The few of you fools aren’t my match in the end!”

Suddenly, a figure landed in the plaza and let out a burst of loud laughter.

Zhuo Er defeated many formidable foes, obtaining the Saint Sovereign Heaven spot. He was very excited.

But very soon, he also discovered something amiss.

Where were the cheers? The voices of exclamations?

Why was it so quiet?

Suddenly, he looked in the direction of the number one passageway and could not help being startled in his heart.

It was not Bloodtrue!

Not He Ming!

Not Chou Yang either!

It was just … an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven! What the hell?

The number one passageway where powerhouses gathered, why would it be an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven who obtained the spot? “That kid, why is it you who came out of number one passageway? Did they kill one another and let you come off cheap?” Zhuo Er looked at Ye Yuan and said with a disdainful look.

The several hundred thousand people present had expressions that were strange to the extreme.

Come off cheap?

Kill one another? Huhu, did they have this chance?

Ye Yuan completely ignored him and said to Yang Qing, “Why are there so many idiots this

2 SO I

year?”

Yang Qing smiled and said, “There are idiots every year. This year is especially a lot!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Makes sense, makes sense!”

Zhuo Er’s expression turned cold, and he said, “Boy, I’ve remembered you, refusing face when it’s given!”

Everyone on the grandstand only felt a chill run down their backs.

This was a great killing god! Not being remembered by him was already giving thanks to everyone. You actually still wanted to remember him?

Very soon, all the passageways had people come out of it.

The 20 spots were occupied very quickly.

Su Mu and Bloodsword descended from the sky, landed in the plaza.

It was just that their expressions were both very ugly.

Su Mu’s descendant was also beaten down by Yang Qing.

However, he was a little better than Bloodsword. Yang Qing did not have that ability to kill everyone.

Encountering this kind of homicidal maniac, anyone would be depressed until they vomited blood.

Bloodsword looked toward Ye Yuan with an unfriendly expression and said with a cold smile, “Boy, you’re very good. This seat has remembered you!”

The moment these words came out, the 18 victors present all had baffled faces.

How did this boy offend Great Emperor Bloodsword?

However, Zhuo Er gave a cold laugh, thinking to himself that this punk was dead for sure, to have actually offended Great Emperor Bloodsword!

Unless you really became Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, you would be dead for sure.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Are you stupid? Do I, Bloodazure, still need your approval when killing people? Is your face very valuable?” Bloodsword’s pupils constricted, a pair of eyes staring at Ye Yuan, already almost unable to suppress his impulse to kill people.

The hundreds of thousands of people present, as well as the hundred sons candidates, were stunned!

You are also too freaking arrogant, right?

That … That is a Great Emperor!

You rebutted him so readily! Isn’t this sowing irreconcilable enmity?

Ye Yuan naturally did not care. This guy did not dare to do anything to him at all.

As for the future, he also would not really keep staying on in the blood race.

After I left, who cares about floodwaters surging!

Being so arrogant, Ye Yuan naturally did it on purpose.

The persona of a homicidal maniac naturally needed unparalleled overbearingness to serve as a foil.

“Don’t look at me with this sort of eyes. Otherwise, I’ll kill you in the future! Maybe you feel that it’s a little funny, but breaking through to Emperor Sakra Heaven is nothing difficult for me. In fact, maybe I don’t need to step into Emperor Sakra Heaven, and I’ll be able to kill you at Emperor Vast Heaven Realm! You might feel that this day is very far away and that you have adequate time to kill me. But you’ll never get the chance! With my strength, getting Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons first place is as easy as turning over my hand! In the future, I’ll be True Sovereign Hundred Sons number one too. Emperor Realm will be the same! You’ll never have the chance to kill me!”

Ye Yuan looked at Bloodsword and said it casually.

But the looming threat that exuded was too obvious!

F*ck me!

Too awesome!

A Saint Sovereign Heaven actually threatened an Emperor Sakra Heaven!

Those 18 hundred sons candidates all opened their mouths wide.

Where did this guy pop out from?

Each one of them was a candidate. Why were you so outstanding?

Why were you so impressive? “Hahaha, who do you think you are? Hundred sons number one? Why don’t you ascend to heaven?” Zhuo Er looked at Ye Yuan and mocked with a loud laugh.

Boom! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Yuan threw a punch over, Zhuo Er directly disappeared without even reacting to it.

The remaining hundred sons candidates had dumbfounded faces!

Freaking hell, you were also too arrogant, right? We all killed our way out from a horde, and you killed on a whim?

However, this guy was really so strong! How could an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven be so strong?

Looking at Bloodsword again, he actually did not even dare to let out a word!

What did this show?

This showed that Great Emperor Bloodsword already acknowledged Ye Yuan’s words in his heart!

He really did not have the opportunity to kill Ye Yuan!

IS e

But Ye Yuan could kill him as easily as turning over his hand in the future!

Too awesome!

There was actually such an impressive person in the world!

Bang! Bang! Bang! When everyone was still in shock, Ye Yuan moved again!

“Bastard, we’re hundred sons candidates, you dare to kill us?”

“Motherfucker, everyone attack! Fight it out with him!”

……

Very soon, these people were annihilated!

The original ten candidates were already just left with Ye Yuan one person currently!

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock!
