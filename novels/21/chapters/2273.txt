Chapter 2277: I’ll Explain It Myself

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain and his wife felt shocked.

They already fought to this extent. Could it be that Ye Yuan was still holding back measures?

Seemingly confirming that they were thinking in their hearts, more than ten streaks of sword light flew out again, instantly replacing more than ten swords in the sword formation.

These dozen flying swords were precisely the 12 heavenly emperor spirit treasures that were plundered from the divine race!

The hearts of Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain and wife shook wildly!

The moment he made his move, it was 12 heavenly emperor spirit treasures. This boy was really loaded as hell.

In the entire Heavenspan World, those who could be so bold and unrestrained were not many either.

But Ye Yuan was still merely an Empyrean brat!

The moment 12 heavenly emperor spirit treasures joined in, the power of the sword formation immediately skyrocketed.

Heavenly emperor spirit treasures were not some ordinary goods. Their power was God knows how many times stronger than Empyrean spirit treasures.

These 12 flying swords as the eye of the formation could make the power of the sword formation increase significantly!

Very soon, Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain and wife were getting somewhat overwhelmed, their defensive circle quickly shrinking.

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain’s mind trembled strongly and he hurriedly cried out in alarm, “Fellow Daoist, it’s all a misunderstanding! All a misunderstanding! The two of us husband and wife are under Heavenly Emperor Swordtime’s command. We are the Heavenspan Mountain’s passageways’ administrators. Maybe you haven’t heard of Heavenly Emperor Swordtime before, but he’s a Deva Fourth Blight sovereign powerhouse! This matter was all the two of us husband and wife’s fault. It was the two of us who failed in discipline, that’s how Tang Yucheng this unfilial son happened! Fellow Daoist killed him well, the two of us husband and wife have nothing to say! Fellow Daoist please raise your hand high up in mercy and let the two of us leave.”

The voice at Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain this side had yet to fade when they heard a roar from Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance that side came over.

“Tang Swiftrain you coward! The enmity of killing my son is irreconcilable under the heavens, and yet you’re actually lowering your head to the enemy?! Want to leave, you leave! This old lady will fight it out with him!”

After talking, she turned to Ye Yuan again and screamed, “Boy, kill me if you have the capability! Killing an administrator without permission, Heavenly Emperor Swordtime won’t let you off! Come on, kill me!”

The current Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance was an out-and-out lunatic.

She knew that she was not Ye Yuan’s match. She was actually threatening to take revenge with her death.

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain’s expression changed drastically, and he was just about to explain but heard Ye Yuan say coolly, “Is that so? Then as you wish!”

“Immobilize!”

Heavenly Emperor True Word directly came out of his mouth, immobilizing Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance dead in her tracks.

Then, hundreds of flying swords turned into countless sword lights, shuttling past in the air, slicing Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance into countless pieces.

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain’s mind shook fiercely. He did not think that Ye Yuan still had such heaven-defying means.

Sword formation coupled with Heavenly Emperor True Word, killing Heavenly Emperors like killing dogs!

“F-Fellow Daoist, this woman is already crazy. You don’t stoop to her level. She and that unfilial son provoked fellow Daoist. It was them who sought death themselves. But my identity is different, you can’t kill me!”

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain was really afraid!

The strength that Ye Yuan displayed made him shudder with fear.

Currently, Ye Yuan could control all of the flying swords to set up the sword formation. With his strength, he absolutely could not block it.

He currently wished to piece Tang Yucheng together and slice him up again. Just what kind of existence did this punk provoke?!

But Ye Yuan smiled brightly and said, “Indeed father and son, even the methods used are cut from the same cloth. After I let you leave, you’ll probably call for reinforcements again, right? Just now, your subordinate already transmitted a communication talisman. So ... you’re buying time?”

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain was extremely shocked. He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually still had time to observe his men when controlling so many flying swords.

“Misunderstanding, really a misunderstanding! That was all that subordinate acting on his own. After Lord Xin Yu arrives, I’ll explain to him!” Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain resorted to sophistry.

“No need, I’d better explain it to him myself! Just nice, I can find him to take back Old Drunkard’s divine soul imprint.”

Ye Yuan said it nonchalantly, but his divine sense suddenly controlled the flying swords and swept over towards Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain.

The complete sword formation coming together, the power immediately soared crazily.

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain unleashed all of his abilities and could not resist Ye Yuan’s attacks too.

“Ahh! Punk, killing me, you’ll die too! Lord Xin Yu won’t spare you!”

Amidst the miserable screams, Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain was also sliced into countless chunks.

In a blink, two great Heavenly Emperor powerhouses fell.

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain’s subordinates were all shocked and speechless.

“Two great Heavenly Emperors! D-Died just like this?” Old Drunkard muttered to himself, unable to recover from the shock for a long time.

Heavenly Emperors were invincible!

This was the irrefutable fact in everyone’s hearts.

But today, Ye Yuan used his formidable strength and shattered this fact.

With a wave of a hand, cutting down two great Heavenly Emperors in a row, suppressing the four directions!

This young man was too powerful!

Ye Yuan looked at Old Drunkard and said with a faint smile, “Heavenly Emperors are people too. As long as they are people, they will die, what’s strange about it?”

Old Drunkard had a strange look and said, “But ... But that was a Heavenly Emperor!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “It will be fine once you’re used to it. The great era is coming. Ordinary Heavenly Emperors are also just cannon fodders.”

Just as he was speaking, an even more terrifying pressure suddenly descended.

A figure stepped out of the void, his gaze looking towards Ye Yuan coldly.

“Lord Xin Yu came, this punk is dead for sure!”

“Lord Xin Yu, this brat killed Lord Swiftrain and Lord Phoenixdance! His sins are heinous!”

... ...

Lord Xin Yu looked at Ye Yuan with a frown and exclaimed in surprise, “An Empyrean killed two Heavenly Emperors?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That’s right. They were killed by me. You should be Heavenly Emperor Swordtime’s subordinate, right?”

This Heavenly Emperor Xin Yu’s strength was extremely strong, he was a Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

However, Ye Yuan did not take him seriously.

This kind of powerhouse, he had seen before far too many of them.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s attitude, Heavenly Emperor Xin Yu was very unhappy and said in a solemn voice, “So what if yes? Aren’t you going to give me an explanation for today’s matter?”

Ye Yuan slowly took out a token. An aura of Great Dao suddenly released.

“Wonder if this explanation is enough or not?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

When Heavenly Emperor Xin Yu saw the token, his mind shook fiercely and he cried out in surprise, “Priest Temple’s token! You ... You’re the Priest Temple’s Second Sage!”

Ye Yuan put away the token and said coolly, “It’s precisely this Ye!”

Heavenly Emperor Xin Yu woke up from the shock and said in a solemn voice, “Even if you’re Second Sage, if you don’t give an account for today’s matter, it still won’t pass!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and briefly recounted the entire sequence of events and said, “Wonder if you’re still satisfied with this explanation? These two people came to kill me and were killed by me because their strength was lacking. It’s just like that.”

Heavenly Emperor Xin Yu listened until his brows furrowed hard. He did not expect that such a thing actually appeared under his jurisdiction.

If it was an ordinary time, then forget it. Yet, they provoked the Priest Temple’s Second Sage.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s status was not worse than Heavenly Emperor Swordtime.

Ye Yuan as the Second Sage, his status approached Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s status.

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain and his wife, they wanted to kill Ye Yuan in the first place. This was blasphemous to begin with.

Being killed by Ye Yuan, they could only blame them for being unlucky.

Heavenly Emperor Xin Yu gave a bow towards Ye Yuan and said, “This matter was Xin Yu who failed in disciplining them. Offending Lord Second Sage, Xin Yu apologizes here.”

Everyone turned to stone!
