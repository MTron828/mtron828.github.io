Chapter 1580 Lifting the Power of the Curse

Inside the hidden chamber, brilliant colors were dancing, being incomparably dazzling.

Fang Tian’s eyes gradually became bright, seemingly producing a trace of understanding.

He discovered that a trace of bond was actually established between him and Heavenly Dao!

This trace of bond made him feel that he was unbelievably powerful!

Gradually, the luscious colors disappeared without a trace, returning to tranquility.

Fang Tian looked at the Ye Yuan in front, the shock in his heart could not be any greater.

Even though he examined himself and felt that his talent was peerless, to say becoming Heavenly Dao’s controller, it was still beyond his reach.

But Ye Yuan actually helped him to establish a trace of bond between him and Heavenly Dao, making him become a controller!

Just what kind of level had this kid reached?!

“How in the world did you do it?” Fang Tian sucked in a deep breath and asked.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The World Suppressing Stele is even stronger than you imagine. It’s all thanks to the World Suppressing Stele that I have today’s accomplishment.”

He did not tell Fang Tian about the matter of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. It was not that he did not trust Fang Tian, but this kind of heaven-shocking secret, knowing it would not benefit him at all.

Once the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was exposed, probably even Dao Ancestors would be moved.

Knowing this kind of thing did not have any benefits to Fang Tian at all.

Returning and encountering Heavenly Sin Heretic God this time made Ye Yuan realize many uncertain elements.

Hence, he borrowed the power of the World Suppressing Stele and let Fang Tian become a new controller.

No matter from which angle, Fang Tian was the most suitable candidate to become a controller.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Fang Tian could not help smiling bitterly and said, “Looks like the World Suppressing Stele was really wasted in my hands.”

Ever since after Heavenly Dao recovered, Fang Tian’s thick accumulations erupted, his realm soaring rapidly all the way like sitting on a rocket and already broke through to initial-stage Origin Deity, even catching up to the veteran grand completion Heaven Glimpse Skydistant.

But he never dreamed that a short 100 years, not only had Ye Yuan already surpassed him in terms of realm, his true combat strength even rivaled half-step Divine Lord.

This improvement speed simply made people wish to knock their heads and die.

One had to know, he, Fang Tian, had accumulated for 50 thousand years before he had such astonishing cultivation speed.

But Ye Yuan?

Counting his previous life’s time, it was also merely a hasty several hundred years!

By comparison, this disparity was seriously too great.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, the Immortal Grove Region’s matters will be left to you in the future. Returning this time, I’m going to bring Li-er, White Light, Fiery, they all away. After all, this place is just a small world. Furthermore, the Heavenly Dao is incomplete and it’s too limited.”

Fang Tian nodded and said, “What you said is right! With their talent, it’s truly too wasteful to be in the Immortal Grove World. This old man is old and can’t endure more suffering. Otherwise, I’d definitely want to follow you together to the Heavenspan World.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, rest assured. After I gain a firm foothold in the Heavenspan World, I’ll naturally bring you and Senior Skydistant they all over.”

Fang Tian smiled and said, “Then I’ll wait for the arrival of this day! Coming back this time, how long are you planning on staying?”

Ye Yuan said, “I can’t say for long. The Heavenspan World that side also has packs of wolves circling around! After I deal with the curse of the land of exile, I plan on leaving.”

Even though Ye Yuan was already the Pill Tower’s elder now, his appearance already aroused Head Elder’s fear.

Also, that Deercry, Ye Yuan already offended him to the core, he would definitely think of ways to deal with him.

Second Elder, his faction was weak to begin with, so Ye Yuan’s days in the future would not be very smooth.

Moreover, Ye Yuan, an Origin Deity Realm powerhouse, mixed up amidst a bunch of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, the pressure was truly immense!

But Fang Tian said in shock, “You can already lift the curse? Wasn’t it said that you have to wait until you reach the realm of the dragon race’s progenitor before you can lift the curse?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “In the past, it’s like that. But now ... there’s no need.”

...

After Ye Yuan refined the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, his understanding of Heavenspan Mountain already far surpassed when he just became the controller back then.

The Four Symbols Family Clans’ land of exile was merely a kind of Heavenly Dao sanction.

With Ye Yuan’s present height, lifting this kind of curse power was easily accomplished.

Outside the cold pool, the old ancestor was currently cultivating in closed-seclusion.

Along with Heavenly Dao’s recovery, he already cultivated to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm presently.

Suddenly, he snapped open his eyes, his eyes full of shock.

“This ... How is this possible? The curse ... is lifted? Could it be that it’s the Progenitor who returned?”

He swiftly got up and sprinted over towards the cold pool, his figure abruptly stopping.

A gentle and graceful middle-aged woman slowly walked out of the cold lake.

The old ancestor’s face revealed a joyous smile and said, “Jun-er, it’s been so many years, you finally recovered! Yuan-er will definitely be unbelievably happy to see you like this!”

This middle-aged madam was precisely Ye Yuan’s mother, Ao Jun.

The current Ao Jun already completely recovered her youth, as if time had flowed backward.

Ao Jun’s face was full of puzzlement as she said, “Ancestor, what’s going on? Apart from the progenitor, could it be that there’s still someone who can lift the power of the curse?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The ancestor shook his head and said, “I don’t know either! I was thinking just now could it be that the progenitor is back! He took pity on our generations of entrapment suffering and specially came to rescue us from the sea of suffering?”

Ao Jun said, “No way, right?! Wasn’t it said that the progenitor is already missing for several million years and there’s completely no news at all?”

The old ancestor smiled and said, “Don’t think too much first! Either way, it’s a good thing. Everyone is definitely over the moon. Let’s go out and take a look!”

At the same time, the land of exile was in jubilation.

They sensed the curse power on their bodies disappear, each and every one ecstatic until they virtually went nuts.

Cheers and jubilation reverberated in the air of the land of exile.

The old ancestor and Ao Jun two people came out of the cave. They saw a young man slowly walk over.

“Yuan-er! Didn’t you go to the Heavenspan World? How could you be here?” The two people practically exclaimed almost in unison.

Ye Yuan’s gaze landed on Ao Jun and could not help feeling very warm.

After a time interval of many years, he could finally help his mother escape the sea of suffering.

The old ancestor suddenly recalled something, his face revealing a look of disbelief as he cried out in shock, “Could it be ... Could it be that the land of exile’s curse was lifted by you?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Ancestor, Mother, the world is so vast. In the future, the land of exile’s Four Symbols Family Clans can go wherever they want, nobody can stop them!”

The old ancestor’s entire body trembled and he said, “It’s really you! You ... How did you do it? You’re just ... mn? You ... You’re already at the middle-stage Origin Deity Realm?”

The ancestor drew a cold breath, being shocked by Ye Yuan until he was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.

This cultivation speed was a little too horrifying, right?

Rather, it was Ao Jun who had a look of pride and relief all over her face.

She did not think that her son was actually so remarkable.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I obtained some fortuitous encounters in the Heavenspan World. Now, breaking this curse isn’t considered a big deal.”

The old ancestor was speechless. This kid said it really lightly.

One had to know, in the era where Heavenly Dao flourished, the land of exile had also once produced quite a number of major powers.

But they worked hard for countless generations and were also unable to break out of this place.

But Ye Yuan only went out for a hundred years’ time and lifted the power of the curse.
