Chapter 1517 There“s Something Shady

“I lost! Junior, you’re very strong!” Mei Fang said sincerely.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior is very strong too! Your sword art gave me great inspiration.”

Mei Fang laughed loudly and said, “Actually, you could defeat me in one move, but you tangled with me for 500 over moves. It’s in order to glean the strength of my sword art, right?”

Ye Yuan smiled and did not deny it.

Even though Mei Fang’s strength was much stronger than Ka Xin, Ye Yuan could defeat him in one move by unleashing Daybreak.

The current Ye Yuan, it was already very hard to find an opponent within Heaven Glimpse Realm anymore.

“Huhu, what a fine formless beats having moves! Your sword art might be able to reach the acme of perfection! Alright, you’ve already passed the level and can go to your next opponent there.”

Outside, when everyone saw that Ye Yuan finally defeated the first opponent, they could not help revealing a mocking look.

Especially Bu Zhe, he said with a mocking face, “Heh, so what if he became the arena lord? Isn’t he still a supporting character?”

“Haha ... Bu Zhe, don’t say that the grapes are sour because you can’t eat them. He has at any rate gotten the arena lord’s reward too.”

“However, he indeed can only be at the bottom of the barrel too. With his strength, it’s likely very hard to even pass the second round.”

“These 18 people are called the strongest, they look like they are so-so. Di Fan already defeated three people, reckon that a few hundred six people isn’t hard.”

...

At this time, the Di Fan who was known as the Eminent Orchid Six Sons’ number one person already won against three people in a row and was currently in a fierce battle with the fourth person.

But the Di Fan at this time clearly already could not be like the start, only using ten moves to defeat his opponent.

Their opponents were all half-step Fiend Commander Realm without exception.

Clearly, Di Fan the six of them were already straining more and more.

Bang!

An arena lord was directly smashed into pieces by his opponent!

This crowd of geniuses was all taken aback with fright. Only then did they know that this round did not seem so easy.

A single mishap and it was life-threatening!

The other three arena’s arena lords’ strengths were clearly much weaker.

He only held on to the second round and was directly slaughtered by his opponent without even having a chance to admit defeat.

Seeing this scene, Bu Zhe looked even smugger as he said, “You all guess, will that punk called Source Night be directly killed?”

“Haha, this is very likely! It was already so grueling for him in the first round, being killed in the second round is also something very normal.” Someone immediately concurred.

The others already secretly nodded their heads, clearly not having objections towards this claim.

However, Ye Yuan disappointed them.

Even though Ye Yuan still cleared the second round strenuously, after 300 moves, Ye Yuan still passed the level.

“F*ck me, is there a mistake? Can even pass like this, this guy is also too freaking lucky!” Bu Zhe stomped his feet in anger.

Although the rest would not be like Bu Zhe, they were clearly all very surprised by Ye Yuan’s clearing of the round.

“Quickly look! Ba Tu lost! My God, just how strong are these round guardians, to actually be able to jump realms to battle!” suddenly, someone exclaimed.

Swoosh!

Ba Tu was directly transported back.

Coming down from the ring, Ba Tu’s expression was very ugly.

As one of the Eminent Orchid Six Sons, his strength virtually overlooked everyone.

Now, he actually lost to a half-step Fiend Commander!

It had always been him jumping realms to challenge others. Today, he was actually overstepped by others.

Even though this was a young genius from goodness knows how many years ago.

“Ba Tu, are these round guardians really so strong?” Someone plucked up his nerves and asked.

When they looked at the projections on the rings, they could only see both parties’ moves and not the undulation of laws. It was very hard to perceive the actual situation.

Ba Tu’s face was sullen as he nodded and said, “Very strong! Their power of laws basically all reached late-stage third-layered heaven, even grand completion realm. Furthermore, their application of laws at least reached the point of unity of mind. Coupled with that their martial techniques are extremely powerful, their overall strength is very powerful! It isn’t unjust for me to be defeated in their hands!”

“Hiss ...”

Everyone drew a cold breath. Only then did they have a clear understanding of their round guardians’ strength.

Before long, there were another two Eminent Orchid Six Sons who were defeated in the fifth round.

Now, among the ones still persisting in clearing this level, only four people left.

Three Eminent Orchid Six Sons as well as ... Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s progress speed was very slow. Everyone already lost interest.

Everyone’s gaze was focused on Di Fan.

At this time, Di Fan was currently in a fierce battle with the sixth round’s guardian. The two people were practically already rampaging, fighting until heaven and earth dimmed.

“If not for seeing with my own eyes, I really don’t dare to believe that there’s actually a half-step Fiend Commander who can force Di Fan to such an extent!”

“Yeah. I didn’t expect that the ancient era’s powerhouses were actually powerful to such an extent!”

“This is just the sixth person! How terrifying must the 18th person be?”

...

Even though there were no violent law fluctuations, just relying on the projections, they could already feel the intensity of the battle situation.

Boom!

Finally, Di Fan found an opening, blowing his opponent up with one punch!

“No. 1 arena lord, cleared the sixth round, obtained a low-grade divine lord mystic treasure!” That old voice sounded out once more.

The moment everyone heard, their faces all revealed incomparably heated gazes.

Divine lord mystic treasure, which was also fiend lord mystic treasure!

That was something that only Fiend Lord powerhouses had the qualifications to use!

Even though this fiend lord mystic treasure ultimately had to be given to the Blood Yama Hall, the Blood Yama Hall would definitely give a considerable reward.

In the projection, Di Fan had a proud look.

Clearly, he was also fully satisfied and content with defeating this sixth round guardian.

“Di Fan is indeed worthy of being the six sons’ number one, his strength is too strong!”

“Di Fan already passed the sixth round, wonder how many people he can still beat.”

“I estimate, he can at least clear until the ninth round!”

“You all look! That kid ... That kid ...”

Suddenly, someone cried out in shock.

Ba Tu saw that Di Fan obtained a fiend lord mystic treasure and was currently not happy. The moment someone cried out, he immediately said in a deep voice, “Making an unnecessary fuss for what?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That kid called Source Night actually cleared to the fifth round!”

That person cried out as if seeing something beyond comprehension.

Ba Tu’s face fell. Looking towards the number three arena, he discovered that Ye Yuan had indeed cleared to the fifth round!

Everyone turned pale with shock. They were all paying attention to Di Fan wholeheartedly but did not expect that Ye Yuan actually cleared until the fifth round unknowingly.

Ba Tu was defeated in the fifth round. Ye Yuan making it to the fifth round, didn’t it mean that he was already very close to his strength?

You got to be kidding!

A rookie who did not even reach half-step Fiend Commander was actually about the same strength as him?

“Is there a mistake?! With this kid’s realm, how can he possibly make it to the fifth round?”

“Yeah! Ba Tu was so strong and only made it to the fifth round. I don’t believe that his strength is even stronger than Ba Tu’s!”

“There’s something shady! There must be an inside story! This Source Night’s opponent definitely isn’t as strong as Ba Tu they all!”

...

The group of people immediately exploded.

They were unable to accept this face. Even Ba Tu’s strength only made it to the fifth round. What right did Ye Yuan’s bit of strength have to make it to the fifth round?

He was clearly very strained during the first round!

Hearing these people’s words, Ba Tu felt a little better in his heart and said coolly, “Relax, he definitely can’t pass the fifth round.”
