Chapter 1306: Stringing Together Sugar Coated Haws

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“G-Guest alchemist? B-Brother Luo, you wouldn’t be mistaken, right? He, a cripple, how to refine pills?”

Liang Mingyu felt that this reason was not funny at all!

Ye Yuan did not even have a trace of divine essence on his body, what would he use to refine pills?

However, Luo Jian was the Myriad Treasure Tower’s number one expert, a late-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouse!

This guy was a sword fanatic. His sword arts had reached the highest level of attainments, his strength pushing straight for grand completion Grotto Heaven powerhouse.

This guy could not be provoked!

Therefore, even though Luo Jian’s reason was off the mark, Liang Mingyu was secretly startled in his heart.

No matter what this reason was, Ye Yuan had a very deep relationship with the Myriad Treasure Tower right now, this was beyond all doubt.

Luo Jian this person was not what a cripple like Ye Yuan could command.

Who knew that after Luo Jian said finish this sentence, he became a mute again and did not make any more sound.

That appearance was really cool to the extreme.

“Family Head Liang, it’s still that sentence, if you have the capabilities, come and try stopping.” Ye Yuan mocked.

Liang Mingyu could not help choking up when he heard that, but he really became cautious in taking action.

Luo Jian was someone that they could not afford to provoke!

Wang Pianran said anxiously by the side, “Mingyu, what are you scared of him for? Jewelhill City isn’t Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s domain either, with our Wang Family backing you up, still scared of him, a Myriad Treasure Tower? Call Second Uncle out, I want to see if this whatever Luo Jian is really as formidable as in the legends!”

Wang Pianran winked at Liang Mingyu vigorously, signaling how great the value on Ye Yuan was.

In the end, it was still greed and overwhelmed reason.

Only to see his expression turn cold, and he said, “Go and invite Second Elder over, just say that the Liang Family has encountered a powerful foe and request for his elderly self to assist! Then the others, attack together. I don’t believe that he can protect that boy’s safety alone!”

Under Liang Mingyu’s command, all of the Deity Realm powerhouses all gathered together, surrounding Ye Yuan trio.

With this, it was a life-and-death struggle.

Ye Yuan and Luo Jian behaved like there was nobody around them, walking straight towards the gate.

Those family guards were all afraid of Luo Jian and just surrounded the three people, but no one dared to make a move.

“All attack for me! Those who defy will be opposing the Liang Family and Wang Family!”

Wang Pianran’s shrill scream sounded out. Everyone could not help shuddering.

A martial artist finally could not resist making a move. But the blade in his hand had just raised up, and a gust of force-wind assailed.

“ARGH!!”

A tragic scream echoed. That martial artist’s arm directly flew out along with his weapon.

Everyone did not see clearly how Luo Jian attacked. That person’s arm was directly severed at the wrist.

Everyone just felt a cold wind swoosh. With this, there was really no one who dared to take action anymore.

No matter how Wang Pianran shouted, they did not dare to make a move anymore either.

Could not even see how he made his move, how to fight still?

Ye Yuan and Luo Jian strolled idly and walked towards the outside unhurriedly as if nothing happened at all.

That appearance was truly condescending.

However, the Liang Family’s people had no temper.

Liang Mingyu himself was merely middle-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm, even a notch inferior to Luo Jian. How could he dare to make a move?

He was aware that Luo Jian this person would never care about the strength of his opponent. The moment he made his move, it must draw blood.

Even if your strength was greater than his, he would also fight to the end.

Either you die or he perishes!

Looking as the two people were about to leave the Liang Family, Liang Mingyu and Wang Pianran were very panicky.

Right at this time, everyone just felt a blur before their eyes. An old man already appeared at the gate.

“Second Uncle!”

When Liang Mingyu saw the old man, he was immediately overjoyed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This old man was Liang Mingyu’s second uncle, also the person with the strongest combat power at present in the Liang Family; late-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouse, Liang Hui.

“Mingyu, what’s going on here?” Hearing the mournful cries in the courtyard, Liang Hui said with a frown.

“Second Uncle, Wanru saved that boy, but who knew that that kid was a wolf with wild ambitions, to actually covet Wanru’s beauty, breaking into the Liang Family to abduct her away!” Liang Mingyu said.

The moment Liang Hui heard this, he could not help flying into a great rage and glared at Ye Yuan as he said, “A cripple actually dares to be so insolent at my Liang Family?”

Liang Mingyu hurriedly said, “This boy used no idea what kind of trick, to actually obtain the Myriad Treasure Tower’s protection. They actually sent Luo Jian out to protect him. In our powerlessness, that’s why we interrupted Second Uncle’s peaceful cultivation.”

Liang Hui was startled and could not help looking towards that burly man behind Ye Yuan.

Liang Mingyu continued when he saw the situation: “Second Uncle, you just have to hold Luo Jian back, when we take down that crippled boy, he won’t dare to be insolent anymore.”

Liang Hui’s face fell, and he said with a nod, “No problem! This Luo Jian’s strength is strong, but this old man can still hold him for a while. The rest will be left to you all!”

Liang Mingyu was thrilled the moment he heard it and said, “Rest assured, Second Uncle. That kid is merely a cripple, I’ll take it upon myself later!”

Liang Hui nodded his head and said to Luo Jian, “Luo Jian! You’re the Myriad Treasure Tower’s number one swordsman, but today, you broke into my Liang Family and injured people! It’s truly bullying people too far! This old man will come and face-off with you, see if you, this Myriad Treasure Tower’s number one swordsman, has an undeserved reputation or not!”

Luo Jian was still silent, giving people the feeling that there was only him alone in the whole world.

Liang Hui’s face fell and his figure shot forth. His hand already had an additional treasure sword at goodness knows when, charging over towards Luo Jian.

Deity Realm powerhouses, even just a minor realm apart, the disparity was very huge too!

Late-stage Grotto Profound compared to middle-stage Grotto Profound was god knows how many times stronger.

Wanting to leap realms and battle was virtually something impossible.

Many martial artists expended as long as 10 thousand years and were only able to break through a minor realm too.

Liang Hui’s strength already infinitely approached Grotto Profound grand completion. This opening move was truly earth-shattering.

At the same time he made his move, Liang Mingyu moved too!

His target was Ye Yuan!

Although Luo Jian was known as the Myriad Treasure Tower’s number one swordsman, his strength was merely around on par with Liang Hui. Wanting to shake off Liang Hui absolutely could not be done within a short time.

Therefore, that was why he would set his mind at east and attack boldly.

But right at this time, a fierce gale swept up!

Clank!

A light ringing sound echoed out!

This time, everyone finally saw Luo Jian unleash his sword!

No berserk sword energy, no outrageous divine essence undulations, just stabbing out a sword plainly.

Clank!

A crisp metal clashing sound echoed out.

Puchi!

Luo Jian’s long sword stabbed into Liang Hui’s chest viciously.

However, the remnant momentum did not diminish. Liang Mingyu’s figure had just reached midair when Luo Jian’s sword carried along Liang Hui, directly stringing them up together!

The two sounds of a long sword entering the flesh made everyone shudder with fear.

“This ... How could he be so strong? Second Elder is only one last step away from Grotto Profound grand completion, to actually fail to last one exchange under Luo Jian’s hands!”

“What to do? The Myriad Treasure Tower’s number one swordsman is actually so strong!”

“This time, the Liang Family really kicked a steel plate! The Myriad Treasure Tower is what we can provoke at all!”

The Liang Family’s guards were all deeply astounded by this scene. This Luo Jian was truly too strong.

By the side, Ye Yuan was apathetic to this scene and carried Liang Wanru, slowly walking out of the Liang Family’s gate.
