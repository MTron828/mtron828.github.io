Chapter 1463 Investigation

Seeing this battle result, Ling Feng was somewhat dazed too.

It was seriously too unexpected, making him have a feeling like he was dreaming.

Five great Heaven Glimpse powerhouses instantly all annihilated, the battle situation reversing instantly. He did not understand what happened at all.

“Haha, Captain, we actually didn’t die!”

“Wonder which senior made a move, to actually directly insta-kill five fiend race captains.”

“I was scared until my hands were shaking a little just now. Didn’t expect that in a blink, they were all wiped out. Really awesome!”

...

The soldiers were all incomparably excited. This feeling of surviving a disaster was really too good.

They had long become indifferent to life and death already, but it did not mean that they were willing to go and die.

Ling Feng’s face also revealed a look of joy as he said with a smile, “Zhao Bin, Wang Long, the few of you go and gather up the spoils of war. This place isn’t suited to stay for long, let’s hurry up and leave.”

“Alright!” The few people voiced their assent, going to collect the spoils of war gleefully.

Ling Feng came to Ye Yuan’s side and smiled as he patted his shoulder and said, “Kid, good skills! I apologize to you, it was me who looked down on you previously.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Captain Ling is really formidable, this Ye admires!”

Ye Yuan did not expect that this Ling Feng was very open and forthright, directly apologizing to him.

But this Ling Feng’s strength was indeed very powerful. Even fighting one-on-one with those fiend race captains, he probably would not fall into a disadvantage either.

Ling Feng smiled as he waved his hand and said, “This was all trained in the battlefield. Your foundation is much better than mine. Your strength in the future will definitely be above mine. Oh, right, did you see clearly just now, who was it that took action to kill those five fiend race captains?”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “I don’t know either. That Mu Feng was just about to attack me when his entire person exploded.”

Ling Feng’s eyes revealed a disappointed look and said, “Looks like it was a passing human race powerhouse who couldn’t endure the sight of it, and he made a move to help us. To be able to instantly one-shot five fiend race captains, I’m afraid that he’s at the very least an Origin Deity Realm powerhouse!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “It should be like this.”

The battle previously, all the fiend race soldiers’ targets were all placed on Ling Feng and the rest, resulting in no one paying attention to Ye Yuan at all.

That Mu Feng did not have the slightest strength to retaliate in front of Ye Yuan and was instantly one-shotted.

After that, Ye Yuan released four Sundering Stars in an instant, eradicating the other four fiend race captains.

However, Ye Yuan did not plan on displaying his strength in front of Ling Feng. Because experts on the battlefield were too many. It was better to keep a low-profile.

The war between the two imperial cities, Grotto Profound Deity Realm experts could only be ordinary soldiers. Even initial-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses were merely just a small captain too.

The cruelty and dangers on the battlefield could be seen at a glance.

Ye Yuan was strong among martial artists in the same rank. But with his current strength, once he ran into grand completion Heaven Glimpse, even Origin Deity Realm powerhouses, that would be dangerous.

The more high-profile on the battlefield, the faster one died.

“Captain, the battlefield is cleaned up. Heh, our harvest in this fight isn’t small!”

Everyone gathered up the spoils of war, each and every one of the faces very pleased.

Military exploits in the army were calculated according to the fiend race tokens they obtained.

Their squad exterminating five fiend race squads all at once this time, it was a considerable military achievement.

As for storage rings, these spoils of war, it all belonged to the individual.

But the army on the human race’s side had strict orders not to practice the fiend race’s cultivation methods and some taboo medicinal pills. Otherwise, kill without mercy!

Apart from this, with these military exploits, everyone could even obtain better cultivation resources, using them to improve their strength.

Ling Feng nodded his head and said, “Let’s hurry up and go! Just now, that fiend race captain said, there’s still a battalion coming from behind. It’s likely going to ambush Tiderain City. Let’s hurry back to report the news. Younger Brother Ye, since you want to join the army, then go back together with us.”

The strength that Ye Yuan displayed obtained Ling Feng’s recognition. He was also much more courteous when speaking.

But Ye Yuan fell silent for a moment and did not reply immediately.

Ling Feng was slightly surprised as he said, “Why? Does Younger Brother Ye have any concerns?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not really concerns, but I feel that we should split into two paths right now.”

The moment Ling Feng heard, he could not help becoming interested and asked, “Oh? What idea do you have?”

Ye Yuan said, “Whether what those fiend race captains said is true or not is still to be confirmed. After all, we didn’t see it with our own eyes. Also, what kind of method the fiend race used to cross the Fiend Calling Ridge, this intel should all be investigated clearly. If we know their methods, perhaps we can imitate them and give him a huge surprise. Therefore, I feel that we should split one force to go back and report, the other force to continue deep into the Fiend Calling Ridge and investigate thoroughly.”

Ye Yuan said this and discovered that everyone all strange gazes to look at him.

“Look at me like that for what? Do I have flowers on my face?” Ye Yuan touched his nose and said innocently. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Feng looked at Ye Yuan with eyes like looking at a monster and sighed with admiration as he said, “Younger Brother Ye truly has the style of a great general. These things, I never considered them. You thought it out comprehensively! What you said is right, they aren’t prepared right now, us going to investigate the intel is the most suitable. Zhao Bin, you return to the city right now and bring the news over here back. The others follow me to Fiend Calling Ridge!”

The others also looked at Ye Yuan with admiration. They discovered that they all underestimated this young man.

They all regarded themselves as foot soldiers, only minding their own business.

While Ye Yuan could consider problems from the height of the overall situation. This manner was not what they could compare to.

Zhao Bin was just about to leave, but Ye Yuan said, “Captain Ling, let them all go back. Fiend Calling Ridge, just the two of us go!”

“Mn?”

“We’re going to investigate, not fight it out. Numbers might be easier to expose instead. If we’re really discovered, it’s easier for the two of us to want to escape instead,” Ye Yuan explained.

Ling Feng thought about it and said with a nod, “What Younger Brother Ye said is true, but ... better I go alone then. Younger Brother, Ye, you go back together with them. You aren’t considered a member of the army yet currently, making you go and take risks isn’t too appropriate.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since this Ye ran into everyone, I need to join with some display of loyalty too. My movement technique is still alright, I won’t drag Captain Ling down.”

Ling Feng mused for a moment and said with a nod, “Okay, Younger Brother Ye is righteous, then we’ll act together. Zhao Bin, you bring the others back.”

But Zhao Bin and the rest were indignant and grumbled, “Captain, my movement technique is passable too, let me go together with you.”

“Captain, I’m following you too!”

“I’ll go too!”

...

Ling Feng’s face fell and he said, “All shut up for me! This is an order, all get lost for me!”

Seeing Ling Feng really flared up, the others did not dare to shoot their mouth off anymore, all leaving awkwardly.

“This bunch of bastards, one day of not scolding them and they will feel uncomfortable all over!” Ling Feng scolded with a smile.

Ye Yuan smiled too and said, “All are a bunch of good brothers, they are worried about your safety.”

Ling Feng chuckled and said, “Why wouldn’t I know? But what you said is right, this kind of thing, they’ll drag us down if they went too. Let’s go!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and followed after him.
