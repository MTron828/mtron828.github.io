Chapter 1678 Leaving the Heavenspan Mountain

Ye Yuan collected over a hundred storage rings and made each of them swear a Heavenly Dao Oath before he was willing to drop the matter.

No need to check to find out. These hundred over storage rings were definitely a large sum of wealth.

These people all came from an imperial capital, they were not shabby like the geniuses of imperial cities.

Breaking through to the Divine Vortex Realm, Ye Yuan’s expenditure would increase. He naturally would not mind having an abundance of money.

Putting away the storage rings, Ye Yuan said to Zhuo Han with a smile, “You all carry on comprehending Heavenly Dao. I won’t disturb anymore. If we’re fated, we’ll meet again.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned around and left.

“L-Left just like that.” Everyone had a stunned expression.

The Heavenspan Mountain was not what one could come as and when they liked. Each time they came to the Heavenspan Mountain, the martial artist’s body would carry away quite a bit of Heavenly Dao’s aura.

Only by refining all of these Heavenly Dao aurae could one enter once more.

To geniuses like Leng Qiuling and Zhuo Han, they only used around 100 year’s time and could pretty much digest all of these Heavenly Dao.

But to martial artists with very weak aptitude, they needed to spend thousands, even tens of thousands of years before they could digest these Heavenly Dao.

Therefore, coming to the Heavenspan Mountain each time was an extremely precious opportunity for martial artists. They all cherished it very much.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s current intention, he was actually going to leave in-advance.

Ye Yuan’s goal of coming to the Heavenspan Mountain was already attained. He already did not need to stay here any longer.

Creating the fourth level cultivation method, before Ye Yuan broke through to the fifth level, there would not be much of a bottleneck.

There was nothing that could not be solved by a medicinal pill.

Moreover, with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain on him, if not for encountering the major bottleneck this time, he did not need to come to the Heavenspan Mountain.

Bringing along a Heavenspan Mountain on him was a great thing.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s departing back view, Leng Qiuling actually gave rise to a faint sense of melancholy in her heart.

She was taken aback with fright by her feelings. She actually had the feeling of not bearing to part toward a man? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This ... shouldn’t be!

But Leng Qiuling was indifferent by nature and restrained her thoughts very quickly, and started comprehending Heavenly Dao.

She came to the Heavenspan Mountain this time in order to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm in one stroke.

Currently, she already wasted a lot of time. She could not delay any longer.

Ye Yuan came to the mountainside and found the Ning Tianping who was currently comprehending Heavenly Dao and directly interrupted him.

When Ning Tianping saw Ye Yuan, his eyes immediately lit up and he said in surprise, “Ye Yuan, you ... you broke through!”

Ning Tianping was secretly shocked in his heart. He did not quite understand, with his strength, he actually could not see through Ye Yuan’s depths.

He just knew that Ye Yuan’s aura skyrocketed recently. He definitely broke through to the Divine Lord Realm soundly already.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This trip wasn’t in vain. Come on, let’s go down the mountain!”

Ning Tianping did not hesitate either and nodded his head and said, “Go!”

However, Mo Lifei was indignant and said with a frown, “A chance to come to the Heavenspan Mountain is hard to come by, so how can you give up halfway?”

Ye Yuan glanced at Ning Tianping and smiled without saying a word.

Ning Tianping smiled and said, “Master, you still don’t understand His Excellency enough. Now that he broke through to rank four, this disciple breaking through to the Celestial Deity Realm is also right around the corner. I don’t need to waste time at the Heavenspan Mountain at all.”

Mo Lifei was stunned and full of puzzlement.

Ning Tianping continued and said, “Master isn’t aware, but His Excellency is even a Four-star Alchemy God!

Mo Lifei thought that Ye Yuan had some astonishing ability. After hearing it, he said disdainfully, “Four-star Alchemy Gods, you can easily find a whole bunch in this world! It’s true that he’s impressive, but his impressiveness can’t transfer onto you either! A Four-star Alchemy God can ensure that you breakthrough to Celestial Deity Realm? This Celestial Deity Realm is also too pointless!”

Ning Tianping was speechless. He also knew that not seeing Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao standard with their own eyes, it was very hard for normal people to believe it.

Ning Tianping just chuckled and transmitted his voice to Mo Lifei who was inside the spirit void ring, “Master, you’ll know how terrifying His Excellency’s Alchemy Dao standard in the future. Perhaps, he’ll be the second Medicine Ancestor!”

The Mo Lifei inside the spirit void ring trembled all over, his eyes revealing a look of disbelief.

Ning Tianping’s appraisal was a little too high, right?

However, if Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength could really rival the Medicine Ancestor’s, then helping Ning Tianping to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm was naturally nothing difficult.

While Mo Lifei was in a daze, Ning Tianping already went down the mountain with Ye Yuan.

At the bottom of each level of the Heavenspan Mountain, there would be a passageway.

As long as one entered that passageway, they would be able to get out of the Heavenspan Mountain.

The two people passed right through the passageway and returned to the Heavenspan World.

Ye Yuan was not in a hurry to leave but returned to Southfoot Town.

Within reason and favor, he should bid farewell to the old drunkard.

When the old drunkard saw Ye Yuan, he could not help getting a shock.

“You ... You really returned safe and sound! No, wait, you even broke through! But why ... do I actually have a feeling of not being able to see through your actual situation?”

Seeing Ye Yuan again, the old drunkard discovered that monumental changes took place on Ye Yuan’s body.

This kind of transformation was very hard to use words to describe.

But without a doubt, Ye Yuan broke through to rank four!

At this moment, he finally understood why Dustless thought so highly of Ye Yuan.

Entering the Heavenspan Mountain with Origin Deity Realm strength, not only did he come out unscathed, he even broke through the shackles.

Just based on this, it was not what ordinary people could accomplish.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Junior’s cultivation method is a little special. So it looks somewhat like inside a cloud and fog.”

The old drunkard’s expression changed and he said in surprise, “Since you obtained Lord Immortal Grove’s inheritance, you actually didn’t cultivate his cultivation method?”

The old drunkard understood Immortal Grove very well. Even though Immortal Grove was very formidable, his cultivation method could not possibly let Ye Yuan give him this kind of feeling.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This junior didn’t cultivate Senior Immortal Grove’s cultivation method.”

The old drunkard’s expression changed, incredibly shocked in their hearts.

One had to know, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s cultivation method was the Heavenspan World’s peak cultivation method.

As long as one cultivated in the proper order, forget about Heavenly Empyrean Realm, even peak Heavenly Emperor was completely not an issue.

But Ye Yuan actually did not cultivate!

Then where did his cultivation method come from?

Dustless also appeared and said with a smile, “You don’t have to guess here and there anymore. This cultivation method was created by Ye Yuan! He encountered a bottleneck, so that’s why he would come to the Heavenspan Mountain to seek opportunities to break through. Now that he already broke through successfully, there’s naturally no need to stay as well. Old drunkard, you just wait at ease. About Immortal Grove’s grudge, Ye Yuan will help him to avenge it before long!”

Old drunkard’s entire body trembled, with titanic waves setting off in his heart.

For Dustless to dare say this, it showed that he had full confidence in Ye Yuan.

Looking at it now, this kid in front of him was really not as simple as he imagined.

After the astonishment, the old drunkard gave Ye Yuan a deep glance and said, “Alright, this old man will wait for your good news! If you can help Lord Immortal Grove take revenge, this old man will serve you all your life by slaving and toiling for you for life!”

Ye Yuan hurriedly said, “Senior Drunkard is too serious, that Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang, I have a great enmity too. Even if not for Senior Immortal Grove’s sake, I won’t let him go either.”

Dustless scolded with a laugh, “You old fogey, you really take yourself to be someone important! This kid’s future accomplishments are far from what you can imagine! Jiu Shang is merely one of his stepping stones!”
