Chapter 1433 Powerful Enemies All-round!

“Hahaha ... I finally recovered! Ye Yuan, this time, I’ll see where you can escape!”

Inside the Life End Sacred Palace’s hidden chamber, Qin Tian suddenly snapped open his eyes, bursting forth with rays of brilliant light. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He was in closed-seclusion here for ten years. Today, he finally healed all of his injuries.

All of the grudges and enmity shall be settled in full this time!

“Wu Hen!”

“Your subordinate is present!”

“Has the White Night Sacred Palace set off yet?”

“Already set off for the Divine Ruins! Palace Lord, should we set off too?”

“Depart! This trip, we have to return fully loaded!”

“Yes, Palace Lord!”

After Wu Hen left, a hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Qin Tian’s mouth.

“Alright. I came, so I can’t return empty-handed!”

...

In front of him was a massive stretch of ruins. But the waves of terrifying aura exuding out from inside, even Ye Yuan felt his heart palpitate too.

This Divine Ruins seemed to have existed here since ancient times. This place was both unusually dangerous and also full of opportunities.

This place was also a place filled with dangers to Origin Deity Realm powerhouses.

The entrance to the Divine Ruins was a volcanic crater. The place had a stretch of pure white bones, seemingly declaring to everyone death.

Ye Yuan had not approached the entrance area yet and already sensed the rolling heatwaves surge over.

This terrifying temperature, even he, this half step into Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouse, quite not quite bear it.

Once entered from there, the temperature inside could only be imagined.

“It’s probably Grand Elder’s first time coming to the Divine Ruins, right?” When Bai Xiu saw Ye Yuan’s expression, he guessed it.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “In the past, I’ve always been cultivating bitterly in closed-seclusion. It’s really my first time coming to this Divine Ruins.”

Bai Xiu said, “The peripherals of the Divine Ruins have a natural flame restriction that can incinerate everything. Even peak Origin Deity powerhouses aren’t able to enter inside normally too. Every thousand years or so, this restriction power will have a period of dormancy. The Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s Divine Palace Lord will use a celestial divine artifact, the Flame Restriction Seal, and break the restriction, letting us enter.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “So that’s how it is!”

At this time, a large group of Deity Realm powerhouses flew over from the horizon. They were precisely the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Huo Tianyang and co.

The atmosphere on the White Night Sacred Palace’s side changed all at once.

Especially Bai Chen, his two eyes were about to spew fire.

He only hated that his strength was too weak. Otherwise, he would have long charged forward to fight it out with Huo Tianyang.

The moment the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace landed, it became dangerously explosive between the two major forces, with major signs of attacking at a word of disagreement.

“Goodness me, my eldest nephew, don’t use this expression to look at this palace lord! In a while, when inside, it wouldn’t be good if this palace lord accidentally pushes you into the fire pit,” Huo Tianyang said with a taunting look.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “With the likes of you?”

Huo Tianyang’s expression became stifled, his eyes full of apprehension.

If not for this guy in front of him, they would have long eradicated the White Night Sacred Palace!

“Heh, punk, don’t get cocky first! It’s not late to be cocky after you can come out of the Divine Ruins!” Huo Tianyang said with a cold smile.

Finished talking, Huo Tianyang brought the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s powerhouses to one side.

Ye Yuan’s expression turned grim. This Huo Tianyang ... had an underlying meaning in his words!

Bai Xiu’s expression was not too good as well. Moving close in front of Ye Yuan, he said softly, “Grand Elder, this Huo Tianyang seems to be somewhat off!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Looking at his appearance, he seems to be relying on something! You go and warn everybody. After entering the Divine Ruins in a while, be more careful.”

Bai Xiu nodded and said, “Mn, got it!”

As they were talking, one group of force after another arrived in succession.

The entrance area became much more lively all at once.

But the various major forces seemed to be very interested in the White Night Sacred Palace.

“I really didn’t expect that the White Night Sacred Palace actually let a kid still wet behind his ears become the palace lord. I really don’t know what that Bai Xiu is thinking.”

“Haha, this is probably the funniest scene in the history of the Sky Foothill World, right? An initial-stage Grotto Profound chap is actually leading a group of Heaven Glimpse powerhouses. Really funny!”

“Heard that their Grand Elder Ye Yuan is very formidable. Not only is his strength powerful, he even has a powerful Ghost Dao powerhouse by his side, capable of fighting evenly with Huo Tianyang!”

...

These discussions made the Bai Chen beside Ye Yuan appear rather restless and uneasy.

He knew that after Master obtained the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, he might be leaving the Sky Foothill World.

At that time, how was he going to face the numerous powerful enemies?

“Everybody in the world can look down on you, only you can’t! They all feel that you can’t make it, so you do it for them to see, and make all of them shut up!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Bai Chen’s gaze turned intent and his mood immediately calmed down and he said with a nod, “I understand, Master!”

Right at this time, several profiles flew over from the horizon again.

The person in the center rode on a tiger with wings, with the air of an expert.

This person’s aura was incomparably powerful. The person had yet to arrive and a powerful aura already enveloped over, making everyone’s faces change.

Origin Deity powerhouse!

Ye Yuan’s expression turned stern, looking at that old man on the tiger’s back.

This should be the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s divine official.

Very soon, his gaze was placed on a person behind the old man. It was actually an old acquaintance. Who could it be if not Azurepeak?

Ye Yuan suddenly discovered that the faces of everyone around him changed. The atmosphere on the White Night Sacred Palace’s side became oppressed all of a sudden.

Ye Yuan had a blank look and asked Bai Xiu, “What’s wrong?”

Bai Xiu’s expression was ugly to the extreme as he said, “No wonder Huo Tianyang was so cocky. It looks like he had long gotten the news! This divine official is the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s previous generation palace lord, Duan Fei!”

Ye Yuan’s expression also changed when he heard it. He did not expect that there was actually still such a coincidental thing.

He knew that in the Sky Foothill World, as long as one could break through to the Origin Deity Realm, they would be called away by the Sky Foothill Divine Palace, becoming the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s divine official!

After becoming a divine official, they must cut off all relations with their original sacred palace and serve the Sky Foothill Divine Palace faithfully.

However, even if he became a divine official, he was still a human after all.

People had feelings, how could it be possible to turn a blind eye to their original faction?

From Huo Tianyang’s performance, he had clearly long known that the divine official coming this time was Duan Fei!

This indicated that Duan Fei definitely notified him in advance.

Then during the Divine Ruins trip this time, what Duan Fei would do, use one’s butt to think and they would also know.

Ye Yuan immediately felt a headache coming one. One Huo Tianyang was already troublesome enough. Adding on another Origin Deity powerhouse, Duan Fei, this trip was really perilous!

“Ye Yuan, that guy wearing a mask, his entire body’s aura cold and gloomy, seems to be constantly paying attention to you! Uh ... This person seems to be rather familiar.”

Dustless’s voice sounded out in Ye Yuan’s mind, making Ye Yuan’s heart jump again.

“Paying attention to me? Rather familiar?”

A hint of a bitter smile flashed across in Ye Yuan’s heart and he said, “I think I know who he is! I really didn’t think that everyone got together!”

“You know who he is?” Dustless said curiously.

“Apart from Qin Tian, who else can there be?” Ye Yuan said coldly.
