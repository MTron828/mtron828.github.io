1428 Entering Selfless Realm Again!

Pfft!

The clone’s sword plunged deeply into Ye Yuan’s body.

Laws entering the body, Ye Yuan’s body seemed to be lacerated.

The heart-piercing pain finally made Ye Yuan regain some consciousness.

“Pain, right? Give up struggling! A weakling like you isn’t fit to live in this world!”

As the other Ye Yuan was talking, he agitated the sword in his hand, churning Ye Yuan’s wound bigger and bigger.

Golden blood spouted out wildly like a fountain, even being mixed in with some minced meat.

The swift and fierce Sword Dao laws penetrated the wound and wreaked havoc in Ye Yuan’s internal organs.

Ye Yuan’s consciousness was getting more and more blurry, his eyes becoming more and more lax.

“Ye Yuan!”

Seeing this scene, Dustless’s entire body trembled, his eyes revealing a look of despair.

Along the way, the hope that Ye Yuan gave him was too great.

In fact, he never even thought that Ye Yuan would fail.

But this time, Ye Yuan really did not have such good luck anymore.

That rapidly flowing away vitality was currently showing that Ye Yuan was currently walking towards death.

Under this kind of situation, Ye Yuan already completely did not have the possibility of retaliating.

“Sure enough ... Sure enough, it still can’t work?”

Dustless’s words actually appeared rather choked up with sobs.

These close to 100 years, he and Ye Yuan already fostered extremely deep affection.

If one took the length of time into account, his time together with Ye Yuan was even longer than Long Teng’s.

One could say that he watched Ye Yuan grow up step by step. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But now, Ye Yuan was going to die.

“So tired ... Really want to sleep just like this ... Yeah, give up just like this then.”

A burst of intense weariness welled up, making Ye Yuan slowly shut his eyes.

Walking all the way was really tiring!

Seeing Ye Yuan’s aura get weaker and weaker, a hint of a delighted hideous grin flashed across the corners of the clone’s mouth, as if this scene made him incomparably refreshed.

“But if I sleep, what will happen to Lingxue? Li-er, she ... is waiting for me too! Also, Lu-er, White Light, Father, Mother ... so many, so many concerns! I ... I can’t die!”

The clone Ye Yuan who saw fresh blood pouring in torrents seemed to have become even more bloodthirsty.

“Hahaha ... Go and die!”

The clone shouted fiercely and was about to move his sword to cut open Ye Yuan’s body.

But right at this time, a hand suddenly grabbed the sword body, and slowly pulled the sword out of the body.

This action made the clone and Dustless outside the space tremble all over, gazes revealing frightened looks.

The clone’s gaze turned intent, pouring divine essence crazily into the sword body, wanting to chop off Ye Yuan’s palm.

But Ye Yuan’s palm was like an iron tong. He actually could not cut it!

The current Ye Yuan still had both eyes shut like he was sleeping.

But the power in his hands was unusually great.

Pfft!

The clone’s sword was forcefully pulled out of the body by Ye Yuan.

His gaze turned intent, revealing a horrified look.

Ye Yuan’s body was actually recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye!

He naturally knew that Ye Yuan had the Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art, but those Sword Dao laws of his earlier already ravaged Ye Yuan’s internal organs beyond description.

Wanting to recover absolutely could not be done in a short while.

More importantly, Ye Yuan was still in that state of sleep right now.

“Selfless Realm!”

“Selfless Realm!”

The clone and Dustless practically shouted these two words at the same time.

But the two people’s expressions were completely different.

The clone’s shock could not be any greater, while Dustless was incredibly encouraged!

Dustless completely did not expect that Ye Yuan actually entered the Selfless Realm once more at the final juncture before death!

“Humph! So what if you entered Selfless Realm? You’re still that Ye Yuan! I can kill you all the same!”

The clone gave a cold snort. Lifting his hand, it was Sundering Stars!

Clank!

Ye Yuan’s sword tapped on the clone’s sword at a strange angle, directly sending him flying out.

The clone’s gaze was full of disbelief as he said in horror, “His Sword Dao laws ... broke through just like this!”

Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao laws were originally grand completion first-layered heaven realm. There was still a massive gulf away from initial-stage second-layered heaven.

The power of laws breaking through from first-layered heaven to second-layered heaven was similarly a huge hurdle.

People with poor comprehension might not be able to break through for life.

Now, after Ye Yuan entered Selfless Realm, he directly broke through to initial-stage Sword Dao second-layered heaven!

This casual tap earlier seemed simple. But in fact, it was already totally different from Sundering Stars.

This was a brand new move. A move that the clone did not know!

What the clone replicated was the original Ye Yuan, not the current Ye Yuan.

Now, Ye Yuan surpassing himself, it was equivalent to announcing that his doomsday was coming.

The clone’s expression flickered incessantly, clearly unable to accept this fact.

“I don’t believe that I can’t kill you! Sundering Stars!”

This time, what the clone unleashed was the complete version Sundering Stars. The power of this move could cut down Heaven Glimpse powerhouses. Its power could be imagined.

He previously fought with Ye Yuan, both sides knew the prowess of this move. So he would not give him the time to launch it at all.

But now, Ye Yuan was asleep!

Clank!

The clone only felt a blur before his eyes and the Evil Extermination Sword tapped on his sword body once again, directly resolving his complete version Sundering Stars!

“Kill, kill, kill!”

The clone’s state was as if it was crazy, waving his sword and charging over towards Ye Yuan.

But this time, no matter how he used martial techniques, he was unable to touch Ye Yuan in the slightest!

Ye Yuan’s every action was nimble and precise to the point where it made people’s hair stand on end, making people feel a chill from the bottom of their hearts.

The current Ye Yuan was like an ice-cold machine, precisely calculating everything around, controlling everything around.

Swish!

Swish!

Swish!

The clone could not touch Ye Yuan, but his body unknowingly had quite a number of wounds cut by Ye Yuan.

“Ah, ahh, ahh! I won’t fail!”

The clone actually had human emotions and was very afraid of failure.

However, the current Ye Yuan was very cold, cold until he did not seem like a human.

Pfft!

Ye Yuan’s sword pierced right through the clone’s sea of consciousness!

Clone body, dead!

Death cultivation, ended!

However, Ye Yuan did not break out of the state of Selfless Realm.

His figure moved, arriving in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

A burst of faintly perceptible aura emitted off Ye Yuan’s body.

The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain suddenly erupted with a powerful aura and actually produced a resonance with the aura emitting from Ye Yuan’s body.

Dustless watched this scene fixedly from afar; inexplicably agitated.

The current Ye Yuan was unmoving like a mountain, giving Dustless an unreal feeling.

As if, Ye Yuan also incarnated into a Heavenspan Mountain!

Under Selfless Realm, Ye Yuan inexplicably set up a trace of connection with Heavenly Dao and could be said to have incarnated to become a part of Heavenly Dao.

Under this state, he could communicate with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain to the greatest extent.

“Hahaha ... This kid indeed didn’t disappoint me! Indeed didn’t disappoint me!” Dustless said agitatedly.
