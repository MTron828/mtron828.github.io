Chapter 2301: Vile Spawn, Why Haven’t You Hurry Up and Scram Back!

A Spiritlink divine pill coming into being was no less than a precious treasure coming into being.

Furthermore, the effect of the South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill was used for cultivation.

Consuming a spiritlink South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill could practically make Heavenly Emperor powerhouses directly improve by a minor realm!

For Heavenly Emperor Realm, cultivation was done in units of million years.

Heavenly Emperors with slightly poor aptitudes might not be able to break through a minor realm in ten million years.

What raising a minor realm meant could be imagined!

Hence, the eyes of many powerhouses present were already red.

This medicinal pill naturally would not have any problem being held by Yun Windborne. He himself was a Deva Realm super powerhouse.

There also would not be any problem if it was in Ye Yuan’s possession.

With Ye Yuan’s status, at least in this Cloudheart Realm, no one would dare to take action.

But placed in Mu Tiesheng’s hands, that was like a three-year-old kid holding a pile of gold bricks and passing through a busy city.

It was true that he was strong, but the experts here were too many!

“S-Second Sage, this medicinal pill ... you’d better keep it for yourself. This Mu doesn’t have this fortune,” Mu Tiesheng said with a bitter smile.

To say such words, he endured great temptation too.

Actually, if he held this medicinal pill, he naturally would not sell it. He would take it himself.

But he knew that he could not bring this medicinal pill out.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Put it away. In a while, you follow me down the mountain.”

Mu Tiesheng’s entire body trembled and he said with wild elation, “Many thanks, Second Sage! Many thanks, Second Sage!”

The others revealed hints of dread, the blood-red color in their eyes fading significantly.

The commotion here must have already startled Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Making a move against Second Sage now, they would be smacked to death with one slap.

They naturally would not do this sort of stupid thing.

It was just that, what a shame.

“Puhwark!”

In the crowd, when Fang Tianren saw Mu Tiesheng put away the spiritlink South Battle Ancient Spirit Pill, he could not resist spurting out a mouthful of blood, and directly fainting away.

Ye Yuan used action to tell him what was called losing the watermelon to pick up a sesame!

Weren’t you cocky?

Weren’t you arrogant?

Didn’t you say that Second Sage was nothing?

Fine then, anger you to death!

Looking at the unconscious Fang Tianren, everyone cast pitiful gazes toward him.

While at this time, Yun Windborne was still in shock and had not recovered to his senses for a long time.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “I can go past now, right?”

Yun Windborne’s entire body trembled and he said involuntarily, “How ... did you do it? Without a trace of source undulation, you actually refined a spiritlink divine pill!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “I already said earlier; you’re a junior. It’s just that you didn’t take it to heart.”

Finished saying that, Ye Yuan walked around Yun Windborne and continued walking up the mountain. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mu Tiesheng had a vigilant look, following after like a cat.

Yun Windborne was battered out of his senses as he muttered under his breath, “I was actually defeated at the hands of a little brat. Then what do my efforts all these years count for?”

“Laughable! Truly ridiculous! I even thought that I was standing at the summit below Dao pill. I didn’t expect that I actually couldn’t even beat a child!”

“Hahaha ... what pinnacle Alchemy Dao! What grand completion Ancestor Realm! I, Yun Windborne, am merely a loser!”

All of a sudden, Yun Windborne seemed to have gone crazy, his entire person in a state of madness.

Everyone’s gaze looked toward him one after another and could not help feeling shocked.

Yun Windborne previously said that Ye Yuan’s Dao heart would fall. He did not expect that it was his Dao heart that would actually crumble!

But they could also understand Yun Windborne’s feelings.

A super powerhouse standing at the top actually lost to a child who just made his world debut.

This kind of psychological depression was really not what the average person could bear.

As the saying went, the higher one stood, the harder one fell, it was this logic.

A powerhouse like Yun Windborne, his psychological development was accumulated bit by bit over a trillion years.

Their hearts were extremely strong and could be said to be infallible.

However, they had been in a high position for too long!

In Yun Windborne’s heart, those that could compete with him were only those ancestors’ number one disciples.

The others were long already not in their sights.

Losing to those people did not have much of an impact on him.

While the rest were not his match at all too.

But who could have thought that a trillion years later, a roughly 2000 years old young man came roaring into existence, and carried out a domineering devastation against him with unparalleled talent?

Although everyone called him Second Sage, even though he beat his junior apprentice brothers, he still had strong confidence in himself.

After all, he was already standing at the summit of the alchemy peak.

But he was defeated!

Utterly and thoroughly defeated!

His Dao heart was like a crack had fissured apart on an embankment, fissuring wider and wider.

Finally, his Dao heart was lost!

“Windborne, bring your junior apprentice brothers to the great hall. The others, withdraw.”

Suddenly, an incomparably illusory voice suddenly landed.

Everyone was shocked inwardly, Ancestor Maplegrove gave instructions at this time!

“Withdrawing just like this? Ancestor Maplegrove is actually not letting us watch anymore!”

“What a shame! Truly a pity! How many years has it been since anyone dared to challenge ancestor-level powerhouses?”

“This level of pinnacle showdown, it makes people excited to even think about it!”

... ...

Everyone’s faces revealed extremely regretful expressions.

This level of pinnacle showdown might be hard to come across even in 100 thousand years or a million years.

This time, there was finally a chance to see it, but Ancestor Maplegrove actually did not allow people to watch the fight anymore.

Yun Windborne’s entire body trembled, bringing his junior apprentice brothers up the mountain in a daze.

... ...

At this time, Zhao Zixuan five people were still in the city. Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin was being the host and currently inviting them to a meal.

“Huhu, that punk really overestimates his own ability! Who does he think he is, to actually dare provoke Ancestor Maplegrove!” Zhao Zixuan said disdainfully.

Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin said, “Got to say, Second Sage’s strength is really very strong! It’s just that, provoking ancestor-level powerhouses, he’s still too young! Counting the time, he should have already lost, right?”

Zhu Tianxiang said, “Mn, with my guess, Second Senior Brother probably can’t stop him too. Right now, his alchemy battle with Eldest Senior Brother should have already ended.”

Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin smiled and said, “The scout should already be on the way back. He’ll be here soon.”

But at this time, a thunderous voice suddenly exploded in Zhu Tianxiang’s ears, making him jump in fright.

“Vile spawn, scram back for Master!”

Zhu Tianxiang’s expression changed wildly. The wine that reached his mouth splashed all over him.

He did not speak, taking a step out, directly going out of Cloudheart City.

The others exchanged glances, not knowing what it could mean.

The voice at Zhu Tianxiang here was very loud, but the others could not hear it.

A person asked, “What’s wrong with Brother Zhu, he left without even saying anything?”

Suddenly, his expression changed drastically too, figure flashing, disappearing on the spot.

Then, there was the third, the fourth!

Zhao Zixuan’s expression changed wildly and he said with a frown, “What in the world is going on? These guys didn’t even say anything ...”

“Vile spawn, look what you’ve done! Why haven’t you hurry up and get back to Master?! Immediately! At once!”

Right then, a voice similarly exploded in his ears. His expression changed, disappearing from where he was.

Heavenly Emperor Zi Jin and Heavenly Emperor Azurefeather exchanged glances, not understanding what was going on.
