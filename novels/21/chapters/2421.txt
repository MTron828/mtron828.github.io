Chapter 2427: Great Victory!

Bang, bang, bang ...

The explosion sounds coming from the top of the mountain made everyone’s hearts palpitate.

Someone as strong as Daymeld was actually blasted flying away here and there like a ball, without the slightest strength to fight back.

The undulation of rules seemed to carry the might of Heavenly Dao, making people awed at the sight of it.

Daymeld was blasted until he was a blurry mess of flesh and blood from head to toe. It was a dreadful sight to behold.

Clearly, he was already seriously injured.

This kind of terrifying undulation, Daymeld’s innards must have suffered tremendous shock.

If not for his strength being too formidable, he would have long already been shocked into meat paste!

“What a pity. This isn’t when I was at my prime. Otherwise, he would be dead beyond a doubt.” Beside Ye Yuan, Lin Wushuang said with a sigh.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “It’s enough! Leave the rest to me!”

Lin Wushuang said, “Your Excellency’s advancement is a little slow. Otherwise, how could it be the divine race’s turn to behave wildly?”

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Born in wrong times; what can be done about it?”

Lin Wushuang’s body already became very illusory at this time and was actually looking like it was about to dissipate.

He bowed to the ground and said, “Your Excellency, the blood essence left behind by this disciple has been exhausted after this battle! In the future, this disciple won’t be able to follow Your Excellency. Your Excellency ... please take care!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered and he said, “Destiny arises and fate extinguishes, maybe ... our fate is unfinished! If there’s reincarnation, this saint will let you return again!”

Lin Wushuang’s entire body trembled and he said, “Your Excellency, what do you mean?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I’m also not too clear. It’s just that I faintly sense something. Hope that what I sense isn’t wrong!”

Lin Wushuang had a shocked expression on his face and exclaimed, “Entering reincarnation is just a legend! No one knows where we go after death! With Your Excellency having a faint feeling from forces beyond control, it looks like you’ve already reached a realm that we can’t imagine! If there’s a chance to do it again, Lin Wushuang is willing to follow Your Excellency to the death!”

Ye Yuan fell silent. Lin Wushuang’s figure gradually dissipated.

There was no Grand Ancestor Skyformation in this world anymore!

However, there was the legend of Grand Ancestor Skyformation!

It was he who shed his heart blood ten billion years ago, laying down a heaven-shocking grand array overnight, blocking countless divine race experts.

It was he who returned domineeringly ten billion years later, inflicting heavy casualties on the divine race army again!

He performed immortal feats for the human race, for the myriad races!

“All of you just be at ease. I hope that one day, I can activate you all again!” Ye Yuan said with a light sigh.

If there was war, there was death.

No one could change this.

As soon as Lin Wushuang left, the grand array became a dead object.

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, he was unable to truly control the grand array at all.

Daymeld was a ghastly sight from head to toe, but he laughed wildly as he said, “Hahaha, brat, you can’t kill me in the end! Lin Wushuang is merely a wisp of blood essence having a sudden spurt of activity prior to collapse! What can he do to me?!”

Ye Yuan looked at Daymeld and said coolly, “The next time we meet is when I’ll take your dog life!”

“Brat, do you think ... there’s still a next time? I’m afraid that next time, who you’ll be facing will be my divine race’s various great progenitors!”

After a bout of fierce struggling, Daymeld finally broke free from the constraints of the Eight Void Mountain’s grand array.

With regards to Ye Yuan’s talent, he did not have the slightest doubt.

Therefore, after this tragic battle, his dread towards Ye Yuan grew even stronger.

Being able to awaken Lin Wushuang in itself, was absolutely not what the average person could do!

But Ye Yuan did it!

There were too many secrets hidden on this kid’s body.

If he did not die, Daymeld could not relax!

Leaving this sentence behind, Daymeld tore across the air and left.

The grand array gradually subsided, restoring the peace of the past.

In this battle, the myriad races coalition forces won a complete victory. More than half of the divine race army was killed or injured with their vitality being affected. They no longer had the strength to counterattack!

The unpredictable army chased them for 30 thousand miles, and finally, the Divine Children Legion was completely wiped out!

The myriad races coalition forces launched a counteroffensive frenziedly, causing less than one-in-ten of the divine race army to remain alive!

Supreme powerhouses teamed up to pursue and attack. The divine race’s experts suffered heavy losses!

The battle of Eight Void Mountain had far-reaching significance!

However, everyone was clear in their hearts that the next battle would be even more dangerous!

The confrontation between the top powerhouses of the two sides was the final battle to determine the ownership of the Heavenspan World.

“Hahaha ... awesome! Really awesome! Since the Doomsday Battle started until now, we’ve been unbelievably oppressed all along! Today, we can finally walk with our heads held high!” Ni Xuan returned from killing the enemy and let out a burst of wild laughter.

These few years, he had truly been frustrated to the extreme.

The strength of the opponent, the allied forces each harbored their own ulterior motives, the weakness of the human race’s combat power, all made him mentally and physically exhausted.

Fight a battle, lose a battle!

Even if the number of the human army was hundreds and thousands of times that of the enemy army, there was virtually no victorious battle.

But in today’s battle, they completely defeated the divine race! Was it not delightful?

He looked towards that slightly thin young man on top of the mountain, admiring immensely!

This was the Saint Azure of eternity!

Shi Potian also laughed loudly and said, “Those damn things of the divine race were arrogant to the extreme in the past! This time, seeing their appearance of covering their heads and scurrying away, it feels really awesome! Hahaha ...”

“These damn things call us ants every day! This time, the ants bit an elephant to death too!”

... ...

The various races’ powerhouses really felt exaltation upon fulfillment.

They all looked towards that figure at the top of the mountain without prior agreement, their eyes full of admiration.

It was him, who took every conceivable possibility into account, luring the divine race into the trap step by step.

It was him, who climbed to the top of Eight Void Mountain, and activated the eternal grand array!

Without him, there would not be this hearty victory!

Suddenly Ni Xuan raised his arms and cried out, “Lord Saint Azure is mighty!”

The other leaders understood and similarly raised their arms and shouted.

“Lord Saint Azure is mighty!”

“Lord Saint Azure is mighty!”

... ... VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The shouting grew higher than each previous wave!

The entire Eight Void Mountain Range was seething with excitement!

Thud!

At the foot of Eight Void Mountain, Pang Zhen came over travel-worn and weary, directly kneeling on the ground as he said sobbingly, “Your Excellency, save Wan Zhen! He ... He’s on his last legs!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, arriving at the foot of the mountain with a flash.

It was only to see that on the ground, Wan Zhen was already just exhaling and not breathing in air any longer.

In the previous battle, he virtually blocked the Divine Children Legion with his power alone to delay them, but he also suffered extremely severe injuries.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over, his expression easing up slightly and he said coolly, “It’s okay. He won’t die!”

Done talking, a medicinal pill entered his abdomen. Wan Zhen’s aura became stronger at a speed visible to the naked eye.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them was shocked until they stared dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

They did not know how Lord Saint Azure had such terrifying alchemy path cultivation.

Pang Zhen opened his eyes wide and he said with a shocked look, “What ... What medicinal pill is this, it’s also too magical, right?”

Following that, he used an expression like having seen a ghost to look at Ye Yuan again, and he said, “Is there still something that Lord Saint Azure can’t do in this world?”

In merely a moment’s time, Pang Zhen already sat up. His complexion was deathly pale. As he was about to bow to Ye Yuan, he was stopped by Ye Yuan.

“Many thanks for Your Excellency’s life-saving grace!” Wan Zhen said.

... ...

The myriad races coalition forces crushing the divine race army, this news immediately spread throughout the entire Heavenspan World like the wind!”

The myriad races who were originally in a constant state of anxiety were inexplicably invigorated at this time.

Everyone cheered joyfully, rejoicing in their victory.

And Saint Azure’s great name also spread throughout the Heavenspan World in a very short time.

It was Saint Azure who overcame the raging tides, and he saved the myriad races!
