Chapter 2143: Initial Display of Talent!

“Y-Your Excellency, we can’t head forward any futher! Any further in front and that’s the territory of rank seven abyss monsters!”

“Yeah, Lord Ye. You’re powerful and can escape from the jaws of rank seven abyss monsters, but ... but we can’t!”

Following behind Ye Yuan, Long Xun and Long Zhaotian were trembling. The others were also the same.

Long Xiaochun pursed her mouth and said, “Scared of what? This grand-aunt is here, would I still let you guys suffer a loss?”

“Goodness gracious, my grand-aunt, the strength of rank seven abyss monsters far surpasses those in the same rank! If it aims a sneeze over here, we’d be dead!” Big Brother Xun said with a bitter face.

“Roar!”

His voice had yet to fade when a three-person tall behemoth suddenly emerged.

The devilish energy sprawling off its body practically froze everyone!

“Goodness gracious, why did it really come when we were talking about it?”

Long Xun and Long Zhaotian were scared out of their wits and practically did not even have the courage to run away anymore.

Empyrean level abyss monster!

This was a monster with a lion’s head and a horse’s body. Two sharp teeth poked out, giving people an extremely ferocious feeling.

“Heh, a decent one finally came out. I’ll use you to practice then!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and drew the bone sword, fighting intent surging on his body.

“W-What? Your Excellency, you aren’t mad, right? This is an empyrean level abyss monster!”

Long Xun was frightened badly.

Empyrean level abyss monster was not what ordinary Empyreans could compare to, their strength far surpassed those in the same rank.

Even though they all knew that Ye Yuan’s combat power surpassed people, facing an Empyrean level abyss monster was still too forceful!

“Ye Yuan, you’d better don’t push yourself. I’ve exchanged blows with Empyrean level abyss monsters before and almost succumbed. Dealing with it with your current strength is still too forceful!” Long Xiaochun said.

She had mucked around in the Dragon Eye Cave for a long time. These few years, she had always been helping Ye Yuan hunt abyss monsters and could not avoid contact with Empyrean level abyss monsters.

Long Xiaochun’s fleshy body strength was extremely powerful, her strength far surpassing same rank Empyrean level powerhouses.

But even so, she was not a match either. It could be seen how strong Empyrean level abyss monsters were.

“Heh,

it will be boring if it’s weak. Moreover, I require purer devilish energy when I break through to the Empyrean Realm. The devilish energy of True God Realm is already insufficient to use.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, his footsteps already moving over toward the abyss monster.

“Ignorant human, you’re provoking the noble abyss monsters. This Empyrean will tear you to shreds!” Inside Ye Yuan’s mind came the other party’s mental transmission.

Abyss monsters were extremely bloodthirsty but were not without intellect.

On the contrary, abyss monsters had extremely high intelligence. It was just that there was a language barrier, they rarely took the initiative to carry out communication.

When they saw humans or demons, there was only one word; that was kill!

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “Huhu, arrogant and overweening fool. Today, I’ll let you see how lowly you are!”

“Humph, a mere human, truly ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! There will come a day where we shall step out of the abyss and occupy the entire Heavenspan World! Now, you can become a delicious meal in this Empyrean’s stomach! Blade of the Devil!”

The abyss monster brandished its claws, several dozen black blades of light rushed over.

The swift and fierce blade lights virtually shredded space.

Feeling the horrifying power of the black blades, the faces of Big Brother Xun and the rest turned white. Even Long Xiaochun also had a solemn look. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Sword Hollow Etch!”

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, there was no problem instant-casting several dozen sword hollow etchs.

Incomparably swift and fierce sword light flashed past, completely canceling out the Blade of the Devil.

The abyss monster was also slightly surprised. Clearly, it did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so strong.

His Blade of the Devil, even if it was an ordinary human Empyrean, it was also impossible to neutralize so easily. It was actually resolved by a True God so lightly.

“Huhu, merely like that! Watch this!”

“True Sword Hollow Etch!”

“Grand Universe Palm!”

“Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space!”

By relying on these powerful moves, Ye Yuan actually fought until he was evenly matched with the abyss monster!

By the side, Big Brother Xun and the rest were immediately dumbfounded.

“T-T-This ... My eyesight must be failing!” Long Zhaotian stammered.

“A True God battling an Empyrean, this is simply unheard of! Furthermore, this abyss monster isn’t an ordinary Empyrean. Their strength far surpasses those in the same rank! This is also to say that if an ordinary First Firmament Empyrean is here, wouldn’t they be defeated at His Excellency’s hands?” As Big Brother Xun was in shock, he sucked in a cold breath.

The combat power that Ye Yuan displayed simply drove people insane.

Even though they had long known that Ye Yuan’s combat strength was extremely strong; sufficient to insta-kill peak True God powerhouses, when Ye Yuan really went all out, they were still shocked.

This was simply not the combat strength that a human should have at all!

How powerful were abyss monsters?

But Ye Yuan actually crossed a major realm and fought until he was evenly-matched with the abyss monster!

“Strong! Too strong! Whichever genius, whichever heaven’s chosen, they are simply a pile of trash in front of Lord Ye!” Long Zhaotian marveled with admiration.

“Ah, ah, ah! Damn human, you’ve angered this Empyrean! This Empyrean is going to tear you to shreds!”

After a drawn-out battle, the abyss monster finally got angry.

Bang!

The Empyrean abyss monster opened its huge mouth. Countless devilish energy suddenly gathered.

Everyone’s faces changed, Long Xiaochun even cried out in surprise, “Ye Yuan, run first! Avoid the sharp edge!”

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of retreating at all, laughing loudly and saying, “Haha, perfect!”

“Run? Do you think that you have the chance to escape? You’ll be crushed into nothingness right away! Abyss Desolation!”

The Empyrean abyss monster gave a loud roar. The entire space became dark.

Heaven and earth seemed to have become a huge cage, completely imprisoning Ye Yuan, not giving him any chance to escape at all.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of their faces changed wildly.

Up until now, they had never seen before Empyrean level abyss monsters executing an attack. They did not know that the other party actually still had such a horrifying ultimate move.

This power was virtually going to obliterate everything!

“Ye Yuan, I’ll help you!” Long Xiaochun cried out daintily, raising her fist and about to join the fight.

“Xiaochun, don’t come over! This fellow, me alone handling is enough!” Ye Yuan shouted.

“Ignorant fool, this Empyrean wants to see what means you have!”

“Heh heh, do you think that only you have an ultimate move? Today, this little lord will let you take a look at true strength!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, the muscles on his body started quivering fiercely. A formidable strength soared to the sky.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces changed wildly.

The imposing aura on Ye Yuan’s body was not one type, but three types!

Divine essence, vital energy, and soul force!

Three kinds of auras rose steadily up, surging straight for the sky. Heaven and earth changed colors because of it.

In an instant, fierce gales howled. Ye Yuan’s hair fluttered, his clothes fluttering madly, akin to a celestial deity descending.

On Ye Yuan’s body, three kinds of auras actually started fusing. His body gave off a terrifying light.

The cage formed by devilish energy was akin to paper paste under this imposing momentum, directly being burst through.

“W-What move is this? Impossible! Absolutely impossible! In this world, how can someone possibly fuse Essence, Energy, and Spirit into one?!”

The Empyrean abyss monster was simultaneously alarmed and enraged, its voice carrying incredible disbelief.
