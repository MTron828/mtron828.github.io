Chapter 1546 Foul-Mouthed

“Quick, Ping-er, quickly kowtow toward Master Ye! Master Ye gave the grace of rebirth to our Qian Family!” Boss Qian said to his son.

The divine essence stones that he spent over so many years were more than 20 million.

Even though 20 million was a lot, to be able to save his son, everything was worth it.

Hence, not only did Boss Qian not complain about it being expensive, he was instead overflowing with gratitude toward Ye Yuan.

“Yes, Father!”

Qian Ping voiced his assent and was just about to bow his head, but then he heard Ding Song snorted coldly. Ding Song said, “He received money and saved people, it’s his duty. What’s there to be grateful about? Since you’re cured, you father and son can go back.”

Boss Qian’s expression changed, aware that Ding Song got angry. So he could only bring Qian Ping back.

Even though the Qian Family was a well-known tycoon, they relied on the Sun Moon Gang to survive. How could they dare to offend Ding Song?

Ding Song did not have the intention of leaving. He and Chen Biao whose face was covered in blood both stayed behind.

They did not believe that Ye Yuan could really resolve all of these problems.

They also understood that the hardest one here was still Huang Qian!

This point, some inkling could be seen from Ye Yuan’s asking price.

Huang Haoran already went to find Wu Feng. It was just that he did not know whether Wu Feng would give this sum of money or not.

A sky-high price of 50 million was not what anybody could take out.

However, this sum of money was definitely no problem for Wu Feng. It just depended on whether he was willing or not.

At this time, the other two families’ divine essence stones were also brought here. Same as Qian Ping, their patients were brought into the inner hall.

The Miracle Hand Parlor’s shopkeeper collected money today until his hands were cramping.

He had lived for most of his life and had never seen before so much money.

In less than a day’s time, they already earned 50 million divine essence stones!

There was still a huge sum of 50 million that might still be on the way right now.

100 million!

Since the Miracle Hand Parlor opened shop, the total divine essence stones gained was less than even a fraction of today’s sales!

The shopkeeper had lived for so long and it was his first time feeling that earning money was so easy.

At this time, Huang Haoran rushed over hurriedly.

A hint of surprise flashed across the faces of Ding Song and the rest. Looks like Master Wu Feng really paid this sum of money!

Tsk tsk, 50 million!

What a huge deal!

It seemed like Master Wu Feng was also very confident in this problem that he had schemed.

This also made everyone have an additional trace of confidence in their hearts.

From the start until now, Ye Yuan already beat their confidence until there was not a patch of skin left whole.

Nobody could have expected that this Master Ye was actually so incredible. Really will grant all requests. Even the idiocy of Boss Qian’s son was cured.

After two hours, those two people brought inside by Ye Yuan also came out.

All cured!

“Master Ye is really incredible! Whatever strange and difficult illness, he can cure them! This will grant all requests signboard really lives up to its reputation!”

“No matter what the final result is, Master Ye’s strength is already indisputable! Probably even Master Wu Feng can’t match up to him as well!”

“But I feel that this Huang Qian, he probably can’t cure him. For Master Wu Feng to dare make this heavy bet, there must be something that we don’t know! Perhaps ... he has already found a Four-star alchemy god to take a look at it before!”

“It’s also not impossible! After all, Master Wu Feng came out of the Pill Tower.”

...

No matter what, the Miracle Hand Parlor’s reputation was thoroughly established today.

Even though this ‘Will Grant All Requests’ was very offensive to the eyes, without a doubt, Master Ye had the capital to be arrogant.

Everyone all understood in their hearts, after today, Master Wu Feng’s title of number one alchemist of south city would likely change owners.

Five major forces joined hands to come and find trouble today, but they did not expect that it established Master Ye Yuan’s fame!

Huang Haoran was conflicted in his heart. He was aware of Wu Feng’s goal, but Huang Qian was the nephew that he valued the most.

When he heard that Ye Yuan had even cured Qian Ping, he involuntarily gave rise to a trace of hope in his heart.

Ye Yuan glanced at Huang Haoran nonchalantly and said, “Brought the divine essence stones?”

Huang Haoran said, “Brought it. As long as you can cure Huang Qian, 50 million will be presented in full!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Bring him over then.”

Huang Haoran led the zombie-like Huang Qian and came before Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan started diagnosing his pulse. Traces of divine essence probed into Huang Qian’s body.

Very soon, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed together.

When Ding Song, Chen Biao, and the rest saw this scene, their brows could not help raising.

Finally, stumped this brat!

Ye Yuan slowly shut his eyes, as if running into some big problem.

Time slowly trickled by. In a twinkle, four hours passed. Ye Yuan never opened his eyes.

Ding Song and the rest finally could not hold back anymore.

“Hey, can you do it or not? Stop pretending over there, you’ve already diagnosed the pulse for four hours!” Ding Song suddenly shouted.

“Are you trying to drive all of us away by dawdling? Heh heh, this shop of yours, I will smash it today!” Chen Biao also said.

“Kid, stop feigning! I’ve never seen before that diagnosing a pulse can take four hours!”

“Brothers, attack for me! Smash!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The group of people was long impatient from waiting. With Ding Song taking the lead, they immediately exploded.

Five major forces, a total of no less than 30 people came today, all watching here.

When they made a move all at once, Meng Huo alone could not stop it.

“I see who dares to move!”

At this time, Ning Siyu’s long sword flashed, glaring at Ding Song and the rest.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s lack of activities, she was also burning with anxiety.

But she believed that Ye Yuan definitely was not buying time but really diagnosing the pulse.

One could only say that this person’s condition was indeed very complicated.

As Master Ye’s little medicine boy, she could not watch this group of people smash the store.

In the crowd, a young man looked at Ning Siyu with some surprise.

His own younger sister’s performance, he took it all into his sights today.

At first, he even somewhat doubted if he found the wrong person or not.

Ning Siyu actually did not have any complaints at all being ordered about by Ye Yuan.

Normally, when she learned alchemy at her master there, there would be a whole string of complaints about doing a bit more work.

But now, she actually even made a move for the sake of this young man.

“Oho, what a pretty little lass! You won’t have a good end following this liar. Why not ... follow your Grandpa Biao. Serve Grandpa Biao comfortably and you’ll have endless glory and wealth! Haha ...” Chen Biao laughed loudly and said.

A middle-stage Origin Deity little girl, he did not take her seriously at all.

Not everyone was Ye Yuan, able to blast him flying with one punch.

Slap!

No idea where a slap came from. Chen Biao flew right out of the door, flying onto the street.

“Goodness, Sixth Head ... is dead!” Outside, someone suddenly exclaimed.

Everyone hurriedly went to the street and took a look, discovering that Chen Biao had already breathed his last.

He was actually slapped to death by someone with one slap!

Everyone exchanged glances, completely not knowing what had happened.

Chen Biao was a late-stage Origin Deity powerhouse. He was actually slapped to death with one slap?

Furthermore ... who in the world took action?

But right at this time, Ye Yuan finally slowly opened his eyes.

Ning Siyu suddenly detected the abnormality behind her and could not help turning to look, and said with pleasant surprise, “Master Ye, is there a chance?”
