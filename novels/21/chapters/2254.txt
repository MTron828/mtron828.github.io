Chapter 2258: Pursuing 3000 miles!

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye comprehending Dao on Eight Void Mountain was once a legend of this place.

Comprehending Dao at 3000 miles, this was not what anybody could accomplish.

But, after 3000 miles, he was unable to go an inch further.

He thought that this was him encountering a bottleneck.

It turned out that he was wrong from the very start!

“Brat, consider yourself ruthless! This score today, this Deva has remembered it! After I recover my strength, I’ll definitely tear your corpse to pieces!”

Shui Yuan yelled coldly, turned to Heavenly Eye again, and said, “Fellow Daoist Heavenly Eye, what are you still in a daze for? Still not going, waiting for death?”

Actually, Shui Yuan was extremely displeased in his heart. He expended a huge price to invite Heavenly Eye. He did not expect that this guy was a pewter spearhead that shone silver; impressive looking but useless.

Pursuing for miles, in the end, he actually lost to an Empyrean Realm brat in a battle of magical abilities.

Of course, he did not dare to go too overboard right now. Want to walk out of Eight Void Mountain, he still had to rely on Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye.

He naturally knew that Ye Yuan was extremely monstrous, but he just could not swallow this grievance in his heart.

How awe-inspiring were Deva Realm powerhouses? But they lost at the hands of an Empyrean Realm brat, and it was even in front of so many powerhouses, this made him utterly lose face!

The moment Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye heard, he was filled with fear.

This place was not a place to stay for long!

“Go!” Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye did not hesitate in the slightest, turning around and leaving.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Looks like you haven’t figured out the situation yet! You wouldn’t think that I’d watch you guys go down the mountain just like this, right?”

The three people felt their scalps tingle, walking down the mountain frenziedly.

But under the heavy restrictions, how could they speed up?

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, firing out countless streams of divine essence in an instant, detonating the restrictions around the three great Deva Realms.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s scalp tingled, not daring to dawdle in the slightest, neutralizing Ye Yuan’s attacks frenziedly.

But Ye Yuan’s comprehension of Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions had long already flung him several streets behind. So how could he block?

Rumble!

Rumble!

Rumble!

For some time, lightning, ice, raging fires, sword lights, so on and so forth, all sorts of restrictions suddenly exploded.

Terrifying energy undulations reverberated in the mountains, making the powerhouses around the mountains palpitating with anxiety and fear.

Three great Deva Realm powerhouses completely did not have the strength to fight back under Ye Yuan’s pursuit.

Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye was virtually about to vomit blood. His defense was like paper paste in front of Ye Yuan.

But he could not stop defending.

If he gave up resisting, Ye Yuan would detonate even more restrictions.

At that time, with all kinds of restrictions being all summoned over, the power would be several times, even several dozen times than now.

Although the restrictions below 2800 miles were not comparable to Deva Realm, the power was extremely strong too.

Plus, the three people were already seriously injured. The power of the restrictions was magnified infinitely.

However, they were Deva Realm powerhouses in the end. Unleashing all of their power, they actually barely managed to withstand the impact of the restrictions.

Of course, their injuries were also continuously worsening.

Eight Void Mountain’s powerhouses watched until they stared dumbfoundedly and their mouths agape. An Empyrean Realm hunted three great Deva Realm powerhouses until there was no road to heaven and no gate into the earth. This scene was absolutely an unprecedentedly rare sight.

This kind of powerhouse, which one wasn’t an existence that shocked the world?

But under Ye Yuan’s invincible might, they were thrown into a panic.

Rumble!

Suddenly, another bolt of lightning landed.

Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul let out a tragic cry, his figure no longer able to maintain, completely dissipating between heaven and earth.

A Deva Realm peerless powerhouse of his generation was dead! He fell in Eight Void Mountain just like that!

“I actually witnessed the demise of a Deva Realm powerhouse today!”

“How many years has it been that we’ve heard of a Deva Realm powerhouse dying? This young man is too terrifying!”

“After today, the entire Heavenspan World will probably tremble because of it!”

... ...

Witnessing the fall of a Deva Realm powerhouse made all the powerhouses sigh incessantly.

Such a powerhouse was originally the strongest existence in the world, virtually having undying bodies!

What could make them perish was also just the most terrifying Deva blight tribulation in this world.

At least, they had to die at the hands of a Deva Second Blight powerhouse and above too.

But Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul died in the hands of an Empyrean Realm junior.

Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul was originally a ghost path powerhouse, his cultivation being immensely formidable. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

But no matter how strong he was, he also had the weakness of ghost path powerhouses. It was being utterly restrained by extreme yang and indomitable things.

Actually, cultivating to Heavenly Emperor Lonesoul’s kind of realm, the lightning laws that could threaten him were already exceedingly few.

Yet, this place was Eight Void Mountain, the apex of Formation Dao!

The might of the restrictions here were seldomly seen in the world.

He was struck by the restriction lightning consecutively. So how was there the logic of not dying?

Rather, it was the other two people who were much tougher than him.

But at this point, they were already extremely weak as well.

“No way! Carrying on like this, I’ll die here too! Shui Yuan this fool, just what kind of a terrifying fellow did he provoke? I got scammed badly by him this time! Bringing him along now is just a burden. I can’t continue like this anymore!”

Heavenly Eye was burning with anxiety. Bringing along two people previously, he was certainly not Ye Yuan’s match.

But now, he already could not quite hold out under Ye Yuan’s savage bombardment.

Thinking up to here, he no longer hesitated and cried out coldly, “Heavenly eye, open!”

By the side, Heavenly Emperor Shui Yuan was caught off-guard and only felt his divine soul suddenly suffer a heavy blow from a sledgehammer, making him feel drowsy.

“Heavenly Eye, you!”

He only had time to say three words and was struck flying by Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye with one palm.

Suddenly, countless restrictions exploded on his body.

Heavenly Emperor Shui Yuan was originally already seriously wounded. Currently, his divine soul suffered heavy damage as well. So how could he still withstand the bombardment of these restrictions?

Without Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s lead, it was like he stepped on countless land mines. There was nowhere to hide at all.

In a single breath, he was blown by countless restrictions into a pile of minced meat!

Another Deva Realm powerhouse fell!

It was just that Shui Yuan did not die at Ye Yuan’s hands. Instead, he died at Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s hands.

The world of martial artists was so cruel. Faced with imminent disaster, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye directly pushed his own people into the fire pit.

“Hiss ... What vicious means!”

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them could not help drawing a cold breath.

Without these two people hindering, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye’s speed suddenly sped up.

Among the three people, he was the least injured.

Heavenly Eye was a Deva Realm formation path master in the end. His Formation Dao strength was formidable to the extreme. He could naturally neutralize the majority of the restrictions’ power.

Now, without Shui Yuan two people dragging him down, his speed suddenly accelerated.

Ye Yuan’s face fell slightly, he still underestimated this guy in the end.

The further down, the weaker the power of the restrictions, and the smaller the harm to Heavenly Eye naturally too.

As long as he could endure until below 2000 miles, it would be very hard for Ye Yuan to cause substantial harm to him anymore.

Among the three people, the most troublesome one was Heavenly Eye instead. Ye Yuan naturally did not want to let him off.

Even if did not kill, he also wanted to inflict serious wounds, making him unable to recover within a short time.

Otherwise, being targeted by a Deva Realm powerhouse all day, Ye Yuan would find it hard to eat and sleep.

The two people, one chased and one fled. They arrived at the foot of the mountain in a blink of an eye.

“Brat, hide in Eight Void Mountain for all your life if you have the capability! As long as you leave Eight Void Mountain, this Deva will definitely tear your corpse to pieces!”

Upon exiting Eight Void Mountain, Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Eye suddenly became light, fleeing like flying.

Before leaving, he even left behind harsh words.

Ye Yuan’s face fell, and he said to Riverword, “Senior, lend the bow to me!”
