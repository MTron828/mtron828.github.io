Chapter 1672 Perfecting Cultivation Method!

Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhuo Han, Leng Qiuling, as well as all of the Divine Lord Realm powerhouses all doubted whether they saw it wrongly or not.

Ye Yuan was very relaxed at this time. How was there no hint of pressure on him at all?

Rather, it was they themselves who felt the heavy pressure.

“W-W-Why ... are you totally fine? You were clearly ... clearly ...” Zhuo Han had an expression like he saw a ghost, looking at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan looked at him as if looking at an idiot. He said with a smile, “Clearly what? Faked for you to see, you took it for real? Said that you’re an idiot, it’s really not false at all!”

Zhuo Han gnashed his teeth in hatred and said furiously, “Impossible! The Heavenspan Mountain is the forbidden land for Origin Deity Realms! Nobody has ever survived here! There’s no way that you’re completely fine!”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him. Footsteps moving lightly, he walked up the mountain.

He was calm on the surface, but actually, titanic storms already raged within his body.

The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain seemed to have produced some kind of resonance with the Heavenspan Mountain and started quaking wildly within his body.

At the same time, the preliminary form of the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s fourth level cultivation method also slowly took shape in Ye Yuan’s mind.

The fourth level cultivation method was totally different from the first three levels.

In terms of complexity, the first three levels added together also could not match half of the fourth level cultivation method.

This was the reason why Ye Yuan kept failing to create the fourth level cultivation method, but it was not the primary reason.

Looks like this trip to the Heavenspan Mountain was really right! If I didn’t come here, I probably can’t create the fourth level cultivation method for the rest of my life! This place is the summit of the world! Ye Yuan secretly sighed in his heart.

Ning Tianping’s words before, ‘the Heavenspan Mountain gave birth to the entire Heavenspan World,’ made Ye Yuan have a flash of inspiration, seemingly grasping something.

Only all the way until now, when he truly set foot on the Heavenspan Mountain did he understand what that sentence meant.

Only now did Ye Yuan know that he had been going in the wrong direction all along!

He attempted to go and open up a small world according to everyone’s cultivation train of thought.

But the Chaos Heavenspan Canon which he cultivated did not reach the point of opening up a small world at all!

His divine sea still had a possibility of improving further!

Therefore, to Ye Yuan, the fourth major realm ... was not Divine Lord Realm!

If other martial artists knew Ye Yuan’s cultivation method, they would definitely be unbelievably shocked, even scoffing in contempt, treating Ye Yuan as a different kind.

This was the path that everyone in the Heavenspan World cultivated. So how could it possibly be subverted?

But the reality was that it was subverted by Ye Yuan!

Other people’s divine seas were already fixed when they reached Origin Deity Realm due to the limitations of cultivation method, unable to break through anymore.

Reaching the limits, one must open up a small world before they could take a step further, becoming a higher existence.

However, Ye Yuan’s path was not like this!

His Chaos Heavenspan Canon was much stronger than martial artists of the same rank, resulting in him having the strength to battle with first-layered heaven Divine Lord, even second-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses when he was at Origin Deity Realm.

Others were not able to do this at all.

What Ye Yuan had to do was to continue devouring spiritual energy crazily, growing his divine sea.

All the way until his divine sea was fixed, unable to break through anymore, and at that time, open up a small world in one stroke.

That way, his strength would be countless times stronger than others!

The later he opened, the more powerful his strength would be!

Because at that time, the small world that he opened up, others were not able to imagine it at all.

At that time, how powerful this small world would be, Ye Yuan could not say for sure right now. But he had a feeling that it might ... be able to reach the boundary of Dao Ancestor!

This was the path that he had to take!

“Tianping, you comprehend by yourself. Don’t need to care about me anymore.” Ye Yuan’s calm voice drifted over.

Ning Tianping had an excited look. He knew that Ye Yuan definitely found the turning point to break through to the Divine Lord Realm.

Over 300 years of unrelenting hard work, finally it was all for this day.

Even he felt that it was very not easy.

Leng Qiuling looked at Ye Yuan’s back view in disbelief, feeling extremely incredulous.

It was still her first time hearing that an Origin Deity Realm could survive within the Heavenspan Mountain.

If it was merely surviving, she would not be to the extent of being so shocked.

The crux was that Ye Yuan was too calm as if this place was his home!

“Just who is this guy? How could he accomplish this” Leng Qiuling said with her heart filled with shock.

Immediately, she shook her head hard and said to Bai Qing and the rest, “Let’s go, it’s not easy to take a trip to the Heavenspan Mountain. Let’s not waste any longer and hurry up and go comprehend Heavenly Dao!”

Coming to the Heavenspan Mountain once was very not easy. They could not stay on indefinitely. Once the time limit was up, they would be kicked out of the Heavenspan Mountain.

Hence, every minute and every second at the Heavenspan Mountain was very precious. They could not continue to be shocked anymore.

Zhuo Han gritted his teeth, used a very baleful gaze to look at Ye Yuan, and said coldly, “Let’s go! I must break through to the Celestial Deity Realm this time. I’m going to let this punk die without a burial ground!”

Divine Lord Realm martial artists could climb as high as ten miles.

Past this height, it was out of the bearing range of Divine Lord Realm martial artists.

Even taking a step out would be crushed into dust by Heavenly Dao.

Existences such as Zhuo Han and Leng Qiuling, the height that they could scale already infinitely approached ten miles.

Once they broke through the shackles, they would be able to scale new heights, becoming a Celestial Deity powerhouse.

But even in the Heavenspan Mountain, this was also not an easy matter.

How much Heavenly Dao one could comprehend, that depended on the individual’s talent.

But being so close to Heavenly Dao like this, for the likes of Leng Qiuling to break through, it was just a matter of time.

To geniuses of their level, Celestial Deity Realm had never been a fatal bottleneck.

Ye Yuan’s climb was very slow, it could be said to be a step at a time.

In other people’s view, his footsteps seemed to be rather strained.

Actually, he was carefully sensing Heavenspan Mountain, feeling the resonance between the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and the real Heavenspan Mountain.

Coming to the Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan’s Chaos Heavenspan Canon was already suddenly enlightened.

At this time, he was structuring the entire fourth level cultivation method bit by bit.

Just like building a house, first put up the framework. Then add the bricks and tiles little by little, and finally form a sturdy and reliable house.

Inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, Dustless was also shocked to the core!

“I really don’t know just how this fourth level cultivation method would look like after it’s completed. But looking at it now, it seems to be different from normal cultivation methods! This kid, I really can’t see through more and more.”

...

Zhuo Han’s movements were very rapid, catching up to Leng Qiuling in a few steps.

“Junior Sister Leng, don’t you understand my feelings for you yet?” Zhuo Han said unresignedly.

Originally, he held Ye Yuan in utter contempt. He felt that Leng Qiuling was spiting him.

But now, he finally felt threatened.

This Ye Yuan was far from as simple as he showed.

Leng Qiuling gave him a glance very indifferently and said, “Zhuo Han, give up on it! You and I, it’s impossible! Right now, we’re at the Heavenspan Mountain, I hope that you don’t disturb my cultivation!”

Zhuo Han’s expression changed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “That punk is still climbing the mountain. I don’t believe that he won’t get crushed to death by the Heavenly Dao!”
