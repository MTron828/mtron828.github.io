Chapter 1941: End Spirit Divine Pill!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Etiquette toward a senior!

These words were not just said to Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people, but it was also said to the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders that were present.

These were all peak Six-star Alchemy Gods whose fame shakes a region. They actually had to carry out the etiquette of a disciple to a Five-star Alchemy God?

If it were before, they would naturally be extremely unwilling to obey this command.

But now, they had witnessed Ye Yuan’s strength, the group of elders did not have any complaints.

Ye Yuan fought with Empyrean Flutterfeather until they were evenly matched in skill and strength.

Furthermore, after Empyrean Flutterfeather had the alchemy battle with Ye Yuan, he actually gained enlightenment on Dao!

Ancestor Realm!

To alchemists, entering Ancestor Realm was their lifelong pursuit.

As long as one was an alchemist, they would want to enter the Ancestor Realm even in their dreams!

How difficult was it to enter the Ancestor Realm?

It was even harder than entering the realm of Heavenly Emperor!

In this Heavenspan World, there were still some Heavenly Emperor powerhouses. But how many Ancestor Realm powerhouses were there?

Empyrean Flutterfeather taking this step was equivalent to embarking on the path of Great Dao that led to the heavens!

Then, the Ye Yuan who could let Empyrean Flutterfeather take this step, how strong could his strength be?

Ye Yuan’s current realm was still low, but no one out of all the people present doubted his future accomplishments!

“Lord Ye Yuan!” The group of Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders bowed in salute toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “You’re all seniors, so there is no need to stand on ceremony like this.”

Ye Yuan was modest, but how could they really dare to make light of Ye Yuan?

In the future, wouldn’t Empyrean Flutterfeather still remove their heads to kick like a ball?

But, unable to hold back his curiosity, Chen Chang still could not resist asking, “Your Excellency, I wonder just who won and who lost in this alchemy battle?”

Ye Yuan knew that these people were curious, but smiled and said, “I lost!”

Hearing this, everyone’s hearts eased up.

Empyrean Flutterfeather gifting the Xuanlong Cauldron, they even thought that this battle, it was Empyrean Flutterfeather who lost.

But even if Ye Yuan was defeated, no one present dared to underestimate him anymore.

Seeing that Chen Chang still had a curious look on his face, Ye Yuan directly tossed the small bottle over and said with a smile, “Today, Senior Flutterfeather and I battling in alchemy, only the few of you know the results. If someone divulges it, I won’t find trouble with you guys. But in the future, when Senior Flutterfeather comes out of seclusion, he’ll naturally come to find trouble with you guys.”

When everyone heard that, they were shocked inwardly.

Although this battle was Empyrean Flutterfeather’s win, Ye Yuan did not pale the slightest in comparison too.

If it spread out, it would have a tremendous impact on Empyrean Flutterfeather’s reputation.

Chen Chang received the small bottle, sunk his divine sense inside, and was immediately petrified.

The other people’s hearts were itching unbearable and urged: “Brother Chen, just how is it, say something!”

Chen Chang was startled, passed the small bottle to Chen Yu, and muttered, “You see for yourself.”

Chen Yu was baffled. Receiving the small bottle and taking a look, he was immediately petrified.

Everyone was rendered confused by these two, but they also knew that this Thousand Tribulation Chaos Essence Pill was definitely not ordinary.

Passing it over one by one, they were petrified one after another.

The expressions on their faces were fascinating to the extreme.

When Zi Yu and Qing Yun two people saw this scene, they were stirred up by it until their hearts itched unbearably.

Just what magical powers did this medicinal pill have, to make the group of Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders behave like they saw a ghost?

After the two of them saw the medicinal pill, their expressions became no different from the rest.

“End spirit divine-grade! Didn’t expect that this old man can actually see an end spirit divine pill in this lifetime! This life was truly not in vain!” Suddenly, Chen Chang let out a long sigh.

The other elders all nodded, clearly feeling the same as Chen Chang.

That was right, the Thousand Tribulation Chaos Essence Pill that Ye Yuan refined was precisely the extremely rare end spirit divine pill!

The five realms above divine-grade, purple spirit, void spirit, vast spirit, end spirit, spiritlink, each realm was harder than the last.

Vast spirit divine pills, one could still see it if they were lucky.

But end spirit divine pills were almost extinct in the entire Heavenspan World too!

Perhaps only Medicine Ancestor that level of powerhouse could refine end spirit divine pills.

As for the legendary spiritlink divine pill, to Chen Chang they all, they did not even dare to think about it.

Chen Yu looked at Ye Yuan and said in puzzlement, “Your Excellency, you refined an end spirit divine pill, so why ... why did you still lose?”

How hard was it to refine end spirit divine pills?

To alchemists, it was even harder than breaking through to be a Heavenly Emperor!

Ye Yuan refining an end spirit divine pill, that was simply sweeping across the world. He would actually still lose?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Because what Senior Flutterfeather refined is also an end spirit divine pills! Unfortunately, he saw another scenery in this alchemy battle, so ... his quality is slightly above mine.”

Talking until here, Ye Yuan also revealed a trace of regret.

In this battle, Ye Yuan naturally gleaned considerable gains too.

That fleeting and ephemeral Ancestor Realm seemed to be a little clearer in front of Ye Yuan.

Unfortunately, the time that Ye Yuan immersed in the grand completion Dao Realm this level was still too short. How could he compare to Empyrean Flutterfeather who already had half a foot stepped into the Ancestor Realm?

But even so, he was also just a hair’s breadth worse, barely losing to Flutterfeather.

The group of elders exchanged glances. They were incomparably shocked.

They were clear in their hearts that although the alchemy battle this time was fair, there was a difference in the end.

Xuanlong Cauldron’s quality was clearly far better than Wandering Dragon Cauldron.

At the later stages, the Wandering Dragon Cauldron cracked apart. Ye Yuan maintained it from collapsing with tremendously strong control.

In between this, he naturally had to expend considerable energy

When refining pills, the difference of millimeters was as good as missing by a thousand miles. This kind of difference would naturally affect the final result.

In addition, Flutterfeather was of an Empyrean’s body. In terms of divine essence thickness, in terms of divine soul’s might, in terms of pill refining experience, it was all far stronger than the young Ye Yuan.

Under such a disparity, Ye Yuan only barely lost too.

One could say that he had a moral victory!

Of course, Ye Yuan would not find this sort of excuse for himself. Losing was losing, he could accept failure.

The benefits of this alchemy battle to him far exceeded the significance of winning or losing.

“Your Excellency, that means ... you can always refine end spirit divine pills in the future?” Chen Chang could not resist asking.

Ye Yuan shook his head and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “How is that possible? When this alchemy battle reached the end, Senior Flutterfeather and my Alchemy Dao produced a resonance, merging into one body in the end. He nourished my medicinal pill with his Dao, I nourished his medicinal pill with my Dao. That is how the current results came to be. If let us refine again, it’s impossible to refine end spirit divine pills too.”

Only when everyone heard that did they come to a realization.

It turned out that at the final juncture, the two people actually turned from enemies into friends, complementing each other. That was how a miracle was created, refining the end spirit divine pills.

...

A month passed in a twinkle, Ye Yuan finally came out of seclusion.

During this one month’s time, Ye Yuan experienced that alchemy battle time and again, obtaining tremendous benefits.

And this alchemy battle was also spread until it raised a babel of discussion in the city.

But to the vast majority of the people, he naturally lost to Empyrean Flutterfeather.

Although Ye Yuan displayed powerful strength, in front of Flutterfeather this Seven-star Alchemy God, he was still too unskilled.

Toward this, Ye Yuan naturally did not care.

His objective of coming to Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital was also achieved, he naturally planned on returning to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Your Excellency, with your talent, staying in an imperial city is seriously too unworthy of your talents! Why don’t you remain in the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion?” Chen Chang said.
