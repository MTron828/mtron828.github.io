Chapter 2766: The Present All-Saint Temple!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Entering the Myriad Demons Mountain, the hearts of Luo Yunqing and the rest tensed up.

Waves of powerful auras came from all around. These were all the auras of Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

They all, this bit of people, were too weak in front of the true spirit army.

But what surprised them was that they actually proceeded unimpeded all the way.

Coming out of the base, the Blood Alliance also received a lot of news along the way.

The factions opposing the Pill Alliance in the Five Great Heavenly Regions, out of the 36 strongest ones, more than half of them were destroyed!

The remaining ones also suffered heavy casualties.

This piece of news made Luo Yunqing and the rest feel lingering fear.

Zhou Yunxiang and Yu Haizheng were even ashamed until they could not even lift their heads.

At this time, if they still did not understand what happened, then they could forget about being the deputy alliance chiefs.

They realized that Ye Yuan really caught up to this upheaval by chance.

But it was also precisely because of this that Ye Yuan saved everyone in the Blood Alliance.

And they actually even misunderstood Ye Yuan, thinking that Ye Yuan betrayed them.

The party arrived at Bull Demon Mountain, and it instantly became lively.

“Hall Master Ye!”

“Hello, Master Ye!”

“Hall Master Ye is back!”

... ...

Seeing one powerhouse after another greet Ye Yuan, everyone felt extremely shocked.

It seemed like Ye Yuan was living very well on Myriad Demons Mountain!

Suddenly, an unparalleled and powerful aura arrived from afar with a howl.

Luo Yunqing three people exchanged a glance, their expressions suddenly changing.

The aura of a Saint Sovereign Heaven!

In a blink of an eye, they saw Big Yellow’s figure appear in front of Ye Yuan.

Big Yellow chuckled and said, “You all are Master Ye’s friends, right? I’m just Master Ye’s servant. Don’t need to be courteous with me, just call me Big Yellow.”

“S-Servant?” Luo Yunqing almost bit his tongue off.

A Saint Sovereign Heaven was actually Ye Yuan’s servant?

Luo Yunqing wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into now.

Too freaking embarrassing!

To think that after he met Ye Yuan, he kept showing off about his great achievements over the years.

Who knew that Ye Yuan he already took a Saint Sovereign Heaven in as a servant!

Compared to this, what did the Blood Alliance count as!

With a slap from Big Yellow, the entire Blood Alliance would be destroyed!

Zhou Yunxiang two people were even more embarrassed. They kept stopping Ye Yuan from being the alliance chief previously and almost drew their weapons against Luo Yunqing.

When Ye Yuan said that he was not going to be the Blood Alliance’s alliance chief back then, Zhou Yunxiang even scolded him for being phony.

In the end, he really looked down on it!

But Big Yellow ignored their surprise and said to Ye Yuan, “Master Ye, you’re finally back! Big Yellow was worried sick these few years! Later on, I went back several times but couldn’t find you and that person, so I could only return.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Was threatening, but not dangerous, it’s finally resolved. How are the preparations on this side?”

Big Yellow beamed and said, “Master Ye, make a guess how many Saint Sovereign Heavens our All-Saint Temple has now?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “Quickly say! Stop leaving me hanging!”

Big Yellow smiled and said, “Including the original nine of us, there are a total of 35 Saint Sovereign Heavens now! The batch of half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens previously have already all stepped into Saint Sovereign Heaven now! These few years, the phenomenon in the sky above our All-Saint Temple has never stopped!”

Ye Yuan did not feel anything, but Luo Yunqing three people’s legs turned soft, and they nearly stumbled to the ground.

A total of 35 Saint Sovereign Heavens!

You’re freaking messing with me, right?!

Adding up the Saint Sovereign Heavens on the entire Rainclear Continent, were there 35?

This guy must be boasting!

While talking, a woman walked toward them.

Seeing Ye Yuan, she immediately bowed and said, “Master Ye is back. Kong Ling thanks Master Ye for bestowing the pill!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re ... King Kong Ling? Oh, no, I should be calling you Saint Exalt Kong Ling now!”

“If not for master Ye, Kong Ling would probably have no hope for Saint Sovereign Heaven in this life! If Master Ye has any errands, feel free to instruct!”

“Haha, then I’ll be troubling Saint Exalt Kong Ling!”

“Master Ye is too courteous. It is ought to be!”

After speaking, Kong Ling left.

Along the way, he really bumped into many acquaintances.

Ye Yuan had met these people at the Myriad Spirits Summit before. At that time, they were still all half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Now, they all broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven already.

When these people saw Ye Yuan, they were naturally incomparably polite.

Along the way, Ye Yuan was extremely busy.

When a Saint Sovereign Heaven walked by, Zhou Yunxiang could not help swallowing his saliva and said to Yu Haizheng, “How ... many was this?”

Yu Haizheng took a deep breath and said with a bitter smile, “The seventh one!”

Zhou Yunxiang also smiled bitterly and said, “I’ve lived my whole life and have never seen before so many Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses! When did Saint Sovereign Heavens become cabbages too?”

The three people exchanged a glance, all smiling bitterly without stopping.

“Huhu, the Saint Sovereign Heavens who broke through these few years were too many, the Myriad Demons Mountain’s all sorts of affairs need them to handle, so it seems a little messy.” Big Yellow explained.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “How’s Heavenly South that side?”

Big Yellow said, “We sent a batch of heavenly pills over. The two great hall masters and three great family heads, as well as City Lord Manor’s City Lord Ironcore, have all already broken through to Saint Sovereign Heaven! The Land of Heavenly South has six great Saint Sovereign Heavens now!”

Luo Yunqing three people were already shocked until their innards had shifted positions.

Even on that day when the five great heavenly sects were destroyed, they were also not as shocked as they were today.

For more than a hundred years, they fought all the way, forcefully carving out a blood path, before they had a thousand strong Blood Alliance.

But what did Ye Yuan do?

This guy actually created a Saint Sovereign Heaven army!

Now, just from what they heard, there were already 41 Saint Sovereign Heavens!

No matter how formidable the Pill Alliance was, it was also impossible to have so many Saint Sovereign Heavens, right? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Blood Alliance’s alliance chief?

Luo Yunqing even had the desire to cry now.

With extremely shocked feelings, the party arrived at All-Saint Temple.

Ye Yuan said, “Are there still Sacred Destiny Pills?”

Big Yellow nodded and said, “There are a lot of Sacred Destiny Pills. The three hall masters used three bottles for cultivation. The rest were distributed to those half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens. There are still two bottles remaining now, with almost 20 pills.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Give them three. Brother Luo, Brother Zhou, Brother Yu, you guys stay in the All-Saint Temple with peace of mind these few days and prepare to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven! The Pill Alliance exterminated our Five Great Heavenly Regions and enslaved the Rainclear Continent. Before long, we’ll definitely make them pay their debts in blood!”

Zhou Yunxiang muttered, “S-Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

He had never thought that he would actually be able to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven one day.

Although he reached half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, he really did not have any ideas about Saint Sovereign Heaven.

This step was way too difficult!

So much so that when Ye Yuan said Saint Sovereign Heaven now, he felt like he was dreaming.

Luo Yunqing smiled bitterly and said, “It turns out that when you followed me to the Blood Alliance, you were planning to let the few of us break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Otherwise, what did you think? That day, the Pill Alliance brought close to 200 Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses to destroy our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! Today, I’ll bring dozens of Saint Sovereign Heavens to trample their Pill Alliance! I don’t believe that his Pill Alliance can overturn the heavens!”

One sentence made Luo Yunqing three people’s blood seethe with excitement.

They thought that their sect’s revenge would likely be far away and not in the foreseeable future.

Who could have expected that hope was near at hand!
