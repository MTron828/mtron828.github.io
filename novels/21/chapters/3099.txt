Chapter 3098: Great Reversal!

“Haha, carrying a dead man, you want to fight side by side? Do you really take us, these Hegemons, to be decorations? Ye Yuan, you’re joking around using your life!”

Seeing Ye Yuan carry Feng Xiaotian, Bloodpromise mocked.

Facing the encirclement of numerous Hegemon Realms, Ye Yuan was in a certain-death situation to begin with. Now, he actually even wanted to carry someone while fighting? Was he joking?

“Being able to kill a Hegemon is so impressive! He probably doesn’t even know what’s his surname anymore, right?”

“Heh, the outcome is a foregone conclusion now. Even if he got out of the Bloodcloud Grand Array, so what?”

“He just came out. He probably hasn’t even figured out the situation yet, right?”

…

All around, there was a series of ridicules.

Ye Yuan’s appearance indeed made them feel extreme shock and confusion, but this did not hinder the overall situation.

In this kind of war that was unequaled by contemporaries, any individual’s strength was insufficient to change the entire war situation.

Even Yi Xue and Mi Tian were unable to influence the war too.

…

A mere Ye Yuan, was there any use in being angry?”

Since it was useless, then Ye Yuan’s way of doing things appeared extremely laughable.

Ye Yuan carried Feng Xiaotian, looked at Bloodpromise, and said, “Brother Feng, you said that this guy is simply a piece of trash, but Heaven One is weak and never had the chance to trample him underfoot all along. Yet, this guy still regards himself as infallible and likes to posture. You’ve always been nursing a grievance! Today, I’ll trample him underfoot together with you, and let him know how trash he is!”

These words seem to be said to Feng Xiaotian, but Bloodpromise found it extremely grating on the ears.

Trash?

Liked to posture?

He was the blood race’s genius!

Did he not have the capital to posture?

Who the hell was Feng Xiaotian?

Bloodpromise’s expression turned dark, and he said in a cold voice, “Boy, do you think that by saying a few words, you can goad this seat? You’re still too inexperienced! This great battle concerns the destiny of all the heavens. How can it be a dispute caused by personal feelings? Since you’ve walked right into a trap, then … you can go and die.”

In Bloodpromise’s view, Ye Yuan was goading, triggering him to fight one-on-one. Only in this way would Ye Yuan have a chance to take revenge.

But he would not give Ye Yuan this opportunity.

Bloodpromise raised one hand up. All of the Hegemon Realm powerhouses accumulated power, awaiting release.

Just waiting for his word of command and it would be a shocking attack.

Even if Ye Yuan had three heads and six arms, there would only be a road that led to death too!

Facing the pressure of dozens of Hegemons, Ye Yuan appeared especially calm and opened his mouth and said nonchalantly, “You’re right. I indeed want to fight with you! However, I don’t need to goad you into action!”

It was only to see Ye Yuan formed seals with both hands. A storm of surging chaos divine essence emerged from his hands.

Swoosh!

The spell was fired into the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space by Ye Yuan with a back-hand. Right on the heels of that, the space started trembling violently. An enormous light door appeared above the void.

As if it was some great primitive beast that was awakened by Ye Yuan.

Bloodpromise’s expression changed slightly. He felt that something bad was about to happen.

Could it be that this kid still had some trump card?

But they already fought to this extent. What trump card could Ye Yuan still have?

He could not figure it out after racking his brain too.

Rumble …

Swoosh!

A monster with a tiger head and human body dashed out of the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space, pouncing straight for a blood race Hegemon.

Immediately after, more and more monsters appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

Bloodpromise’s pupils constricted, looking at these monsters with a look of horror.

Each of these monsters had the strength of Hegemon Realm!

Boom!

Boom!

.

Boom!

Above the void, a shocking great battle immediately broke out.

These monster Hegemons, each one of them was intrepid to the extreme, like they were bloodthirsty, pouncing towards the bloodthirsty Hegemons frenziedly.

There were actually more than 800 of these monster Hegemons!

Bloodpromise’s complexion was deathly pale, and he said in a panic, “This … How is this possible? More than 800 Hegemon Realm monsters, where did they come from?”

More than 800 Hegemon Realm level bloodthirsty gods of war; what kind of terrifying strength was that?

For a moment, countless powerful existences filled the sky, giving people an extremely shocking feeling.

Their appearance suddenly turned the entire battle situation around!

“Leave that person to me. Kill the rest!” Ye Yuan pointed at Bloodpromise and said.

The dozens of Hegemon Realms that Bloodpromise led were virtually crushed into scraps by these 800 Hegemon Realm monsters in an instant.

They revived non-stop and were continuously killed again.

All the way until the end, they were finally unable to revive.

Even if it was those Peak Hegemons, they could not escape this fate too.

Being pummeled frenziedly by hundreds of Hegemon Realms, no matter how strong they were, it was to no avail too.

Furthermore, these monsters all did not fear death and were dauntless to the extreme, their combat power going off the charts. None of them were easy to deal with.

However, those monsters did not attack Bloodpromise, directly emptying out this region of space where he was standing.

But they completely sealed off this large area of space. Bloodpromise did not even have the chance to run away.

Bloodpromise’s complexion was deathly pale, a feeling of despair welling up in his heart.

Just now, he was still pleased with himself, thinking that he had cornered Ye Yuan.

But in a blink, it became his certain-death scenario!

This huge reversal was too crazy!

Over 800 Hegemon Realm level monsters instantly rushed out of the battlefield. This kind of impact was seriously too strong and too shocking.

In the midst of fierce fighting, Yi Xue’s pupils constricted, and he said in astonishment, “These … These are those monsters … that had their bloodlines nurtured? How … How could they possibly all become Hegemon Realm?”

It was not just Yi Xue; Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s side was also in extreme shock, unable to extricate themselves for a long time.

The appearance of these 800 Hegemon Realms made the visual shock even stronger! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Clearly, they all did not know that their side actually still had such a horrifying trump card.

“It’s those monsters! Many years ago, they already disappeared. I didn’t expect that they were actually forged into a Hegemon Realm army by Heavenly Saint Ye!”

“Amazing! Over 800 Hegemon Realms, this strength is enough to sweep across all the heavens! With them, we can even fight with the blood race!”

“They were all persecuted by the blood race. That’s how they became like this. The blood race also didn’t expect that there would be today, right? This is called retribution is great!”

…

Originally, these people were all harboring the resolve to make a last ditch desperate attempt.

But, who knew that the moment Ye Yuan appeared, it reversed the battle situation and became a one-sided slaughter!

Hence, each and every one of them was incomparably invigorated, going all out and launching a major counter-offensive against the blood race army!

“Roar!”

A shocking angry roar came over, and a monster with a huge body dashed out of the Extreme Light Pavilion’s space.

This was the last one!

Zhao Yue!

The current Zhao Yue, his body was several times larger than before!

His entire person’s aura became incomparably violent and unbelievably powerful!

His appearance made everyone fall into even greater shock.

It was because the current Zhao Yue had actually already reached Great Beyond Realm!

His appearance pushed the momentum of the entire battlefield to the pinnacle!

“You go and help Senior Mi Tian. Take Yi Xue down! I’m going to use his blood to hold a memorial ceremony for Brother Feng!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue lifted his head to the sky and roared angrily, rushing toward Yi Xue!
