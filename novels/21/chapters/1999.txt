Chapter 2003: Lu Yan’s Fury

Inside the City Lord Manor, the atmosphere did not ease up even after the deaths of the three great geniuses.

On the contrary, the atmosphere was rather suffocating.

“Your Excellency, this ... Is our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City considered to have revolted?” City Lord Zuo Shujie asked somewhat flusteredly.

Under Ye Yuan’s miracle medicine, Zuo Shujie finally had his life saved.

As an imperial capital’s city lord under Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s command, he had awe and veneration in his heart toward the existence of great imperial capitals.

This kind of awe and veneration had been accumulating over a very long time. So how could it be wiped away easily?

Ye Yuan killed an Empyrean’s daughter and slaughtered hundreds of black-clothed armored soldiers. Among them, there were even some True God Realm commanders.

This way of doing things was simply too insane.

What everyone was worried about now was the Empyrean’s vengeance.

Empyreans were invincible existences in everyone’s eyes.

Even if your True God Realm strength was monstrous, in front of an Empyrean powerhouse, it was still too weak to stand up to the competition.

Ye Yuan’s strength was strong, powerful until he could kill Lu Ziyi who comprehended the laws of the five elements. But in front of an Empyrean powerhouse, he would still be too weak to take a single blow.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “Revolt? Since we’ve never obeyed before, what’s there to revolt?”

He had never treated himself as anyone’s citizen. Taking on this position of patrolling envoy was also merely in order to make it convenient to run Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

With Ye Yuan’s personality, he naturally would not leave his life at other people’s mercy.

Even if the other party was an Empyrean powerhouse, they could forget about making Ye Yuan lower his head too.

“But, Big Brother, our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City doesn’t have an Empyrean powerhouse to hold down the fort. If that Empyrean Lu Yan really comes knocking, how should we respond?” White Light also frowned and said.

This time, he felt tremendous pressure too.

“Yeah, all are ants beneath Empyrean. Your Excellency, your strength is extremely strong, but you haven’t reached Empyrean in the end,” Ning Tianping also said with a worried look.

“Master, aren’t you Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder? If you go and invite Empyrean powerhouses with this identity, they should give face, right?” Bai Chen suddenly said.

His words made everyone’s eyes lit up all at once.

The identity of Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder was extraordinary.

Even Empyrean powerhouses should give some face too.

After all, who would offend a super Alchemy God with a great future?

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “You all are thinking too much. No matter how powerful the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion is, they are also merely just a bunch of Six-star Alchemy Gods. Empyrean powerhouses, which one isn’t extremely proud? How could they possibly come and be my hired thug for this sort of thing?”

This would not do, that would not do as well, everyone really did not know what they should do.

The title of Empyrean was like an enormous haze, crushing until everyone could not breathe.

Everyone fell silent again.

This atmosphere was not just inside the City Lord Manor. It was also spreading in the entire imperial city.

Although the present Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s strength already could not be compared to the past.

Matching up against a great imperial capital, this level of a city, was undoubtedly an ant trying to shake a big tree.

But even so, only a very small portion of people chose to leave Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

The vast majority of martial artists all chose to stay behind.

Ye Yuan cutting down three great geniuses in a rage, they understood that it was not for himself. It was for an unimportant person.

That nobody was called Jiang Ming.

After that day, everyone remembered this once insignificant name.

Because that was the personification of each and every one of them.

Wasn’t each and every one of them the Jiang Ming among the numerous living things?

“I’m just an itinerant cultivator. These several tens of thousands of years, I’ve lived in more than a dozen cities before. But no city made me have such a sense of belonging.”

“Lord Ye Yuan is different from ordinary controllers! In his eyes, every martial artist of Heavenly Eagle is his family.”

“Isn’t that so? The last time, Deathsoul Gate provoked him; Lord Ye Yuan would rather bind both hands himself than be willing to have one more person in the city get hurt! One has to know, with his strength, killing those people wasn’t a hard thing. This time, he also killed people in a rage for that nobody Jiang Ming.”

...

Ye Yuan made the martial artists here in Heavenly Eagle had a great sense of belonging these few years.

He managed the Martial Tower and the Pill Tower, and opened them to all martial artists, and reduced the tax of the martial artists in the city. This series of things did not need to be said. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Especially during this recent incident, Ye Yuan’s actions and conduct thoroughly conquered the martial artists in the city, making everyone submit wholeheartedly.

This made them feel like Heavenly Eagle Imperial City had a feeling of home.

In this indifferent world, there was a ruler who sincerely supported bottom-level martial artists. This was clearly an extremely rare thing.

Therefore, despite being clearly aware that Ye Yuan’s opponent this time was an Empyrean powerhouse, no one shrank back. Instead, they had an appearance like they were bound by a common hatred for the enemy.

...

There were no walls without cracks in the world. The news of Ye Yuan killing the three great geniuses, Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital received the news very quickly.

At this time, the Deng Family’s and Dai Family’s two ancestors were currently in a furious rage at the City Lord Manor.

The Deng Family’s ancestor Deng Yunzai roared furiously at Lu Yan, “Brother Lu Yan, this punk called Ye Yuan really ate a bear’s heart or leopard’s gall, to actually dare kill our family’s Deng Wei! Not killing this fiend, it will be hard to dispel the hatred in my heart!”

By the side, the Dai Family’s ancestor, Dai Chunhao, similarly had a look of thunderous rage as he said, “My Dai Family expended countless painstaking effort on Yang-er for him to be who he is today. I was even hoping for him to inherit my mantle. But I didn’t expect that he died in this brat’s hands. Not killing him, I, Dai Chunhao, swear that I’m less than human.”

These two ancestors currently had extremely vigorous auras. A few sentences were practically about to bring down the roof. Their fury could be seen from just this.

Opposite them was a middle-aged man with a frosty expression.

This middle-aged man was precisely Lu Ziyi’s father, the master of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital, Lu Yan.

For these two family’s ancestors to dare raise such a clamor in front of an Empyrean, they were clearly in the same generation as Lu Yan.

These two people were shockingly Empyrean powerhouses too.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s martial artists did not know Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s actual situation.

If they knew that Ye Yuan offended three great Empyrean powerhouses in one go, no idea how despairing it would be for them.

Lu Ziyi’s brows furrowed slightly. Snorting coldly, he said, “What’s the fuss? Those two grandsons of yours have already been separated by no idea how many generations. Although their talents were pretty good, if really talking about it, it’s also just like that. Whether or not they can break through to be an Empyrean is still another matter altogether. However, my Ziyi is a one-in-ten-thousand peerless genius. She already grasped the true essence of the five elements. Given time, her strength will definitely be above mine. You guys are furious, could it be that this Empyrean isn’t as furious as you all?”

Lu Yan overflowed with majesty with every movement and action. Even though Deng and Dai two people were both Empyrean powerhouses, they also fell silent at this time.

Yeah, actually, the angriest one should be Lu Yan.

With Lu Ziyi’s talent, breaking through to the Empyrean Realm in the future was virtually a sure bet.

In fact, there was a possibility of breaking through to the legendary realm of Heavenly Emperor!

Such a rare talent, forget about the puny little Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital, even when placed in a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda, she also did not pale in comparison to those geniuses.

Now, she died bafflingly just like that.

How could he, Lu Yan, not be furious?

“That ... Brother Lu Yan, why don’t we make a move together, and go kill that punk!” Deng Yunzai asked probingly.

Lu Yan smiled coldly and said, “Kill him? Isn’t that letting him off too lightly? This Empyrean will let him know what’s called despair!”
