Chapter 1137: What You Said Makes a Lot of Sense

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing Shark One’s comical expression, Ye Yuan was tickled.

Shark One was very clever. He saw that Ye Yuan was completely ignorant about the Nine Phoenix Island’s matters and knew that Ye Yuan definitely did not have Clear Eye Tokens on him.

Reaching the Nine Phoenix Island, he was very scared of Ye Yuan snatching their tokens.

One token could only let one person go in. The remainder would have to wait outside the island.

If Ye Yuan snatched away their two tokens, Shark One’s trip would be considered in vain.

“When have I said that I’m going to snatch your tokens?” Ye Yuan could not help laughing in spite of himself.

With this, everyone was stunned.

“Milord, not snatching their tokens, how do we go in? Those fire spirits seem to be very powerful. Furthermore, this fog barrier seems to secretly encompass array formations. It’s not easy to cross!” Ao Qian said.

“Yeah, Young Master Ji. Shark One already said, for so many years, there has never been anyone who entered without relying on the tokens before,” Elder Tan also said.

Zhao Qian pretty eyes swirled around, but she did not speak. But the puzzled look in her eyes was similarly considerable.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “They only have two tokens. Even if we snatch it over, only two of us can go in. Who’s entering then?”

Ye Yuan’s words stumped everyone.

However, Shark One was wildly elated and said, “Y-Your Excellency, you’re really not going to snatch our tokens?”

Ye Yuan directly gave him a kick and said huffily, “Scram inside! Keep being long-winded and your tokens will belong to this young master!”

Shark One jumped in fright and hurriedly rolled and crawled together with Shark Two, entering inside the mist barrier.

“Milord, this ...” Ao Qian asked in bewilderment.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You all just follow me will do. How can a mere fog barrier block this young master?”

Done talking, a hint of brightness flooded Ye Yuan’s eyes. That mist barrier instantly became open and clear.

The Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil could see through myriad things in the world. A mere fog barrier naturally could not stump Ye Yuan.

The moment the Sun Moon Heavenly Pupil opened, it came into plain view.

Ye Yuan shuttled back and forth inside the fog barrier, akin to strolling idly in a courtyard.

Suddenly, a terrifying fire spirit suddenly dashed out, pouncing straight at everyone.

The party’s expression changed drastically, feeling like their entire person was going to be melted.

Ye Yuan yelled out coldly, “Fiery!”

A figure whirled away, pouncing straight for that fire spirit.

Under everyone’s dumbfounded gaze, Fiery actually extended both hands, directly hugging the fire spirit in his arms!

Then, a scene that made people even more astonished occurred.

Fiery directly lowered his head, picked the fire spirit up, and started chomping down!

“This ... This is a primordial spirit?” Elder Tan said with an astonished look.

Even if he was a primordial spirit, to be able to resist such a terrifying fire spirit, he was also a remarkable existence!

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Fiery was incarnated from a Cleansing Sandal Flame Lotus and can devour myriad flames of the world! These fire spirits are a great tonic to Fiery.”

“C-Cleansing Sandal Flame Lotus?” Elder Tan could not refrain from swallowing hard, his eyes filled with a look of shock.

A primordial spirit transformed by a Cleansing Sandal Flame Lotus, it was hard to come across even once in 100 thousand years!

He looked at Ye Yuan, endlessly shocked in his heart.

Disappearing for 20 years, what the hell did Ji Qingyun go through?!

This guy was simply ridiculously monstrous.

Along the way, Fiery swallowed quite a number of fire spirits. But his aura became stronger and stronger, making everyone jumpy with fear.

This guy even burped and said with a bashful look, “so full.”

Everyone broke down.

After half a day, it suddenly became bright and clear before everyone’s eyes. They finally arrived at a stretch of land.

The place ahead was actually like a town, streams of people busily coming and going, flowing in an endless stream.

“To be able to set up a trade fair on this stretch of sea region, the strength of this place’s master can’t be underestimated!” Ao Qian said.

“Y-Your Excellency, you really entered! This ... How is this possible?”

Suddenly, a strange cry sounded out. The voice was filled with shock. Who could it be if not Shark One?

“Not needing the Clear Eye Token and being able to enter the Nine Phoenix Island, it has never happened before in these over one thousand years!” In Shark Two’s voice was similarly filled with alarm.

“Making a big fuss over nothing! There are plenty of things that you haven’t seen before! How can my lord be what small fish like you can gauge? Then have you seen before a Sixth Level Dao Profound capable of killing you?” Jiang Taicang said with a gloating look.

Shark One was stunned and actually really pondered it seriously. Only after a while did he suddenly come to a realization. He said, “En,

what you said makes a lot of sense. His Excellency is indeed not an ordinary person. Shark One is impressed!”

The sea race similarly revered the strong. Ye Yuan’s strength already completely convinced Shark One.

Furthermore, after Ye Yuan defeated them, he did not make things difficult for them and even did not snatch the Clear Eye Tokens.

The Shark One, who had simple thoughts, was truly grateful toward Ye Yuan.

But the commotion over this side still startled quite a few people in the town.

Each and every one of them surrounded over, like they discovered priceless treasures, sizing up Ye Yuan and the others.

“No way, right? They don’t have Clear Eye Tokens and are actually able to barge into the Nine Phoenix Island. Truly inconceivable!”

“Yeah. Nine Phoenix Island has already operated for over a thousand years. I’ve never heard before of anyone capable of directly forcing entrance inside.”

“There’s probably some precious treasure on these few people, right? Otherwise, the fire spirits on the island are sufficient to annihilate them!”

The moment ‘precious treasure’ two words were uttered, quite a number of people’s gazes revealed a look of greed.

To be able to enter the Nine Phoenix Island, most were not weak.

Among them, there were no lack of some extremely confident Void Mystic powerhouses.

A precious treasure capable of avoiding the fog barrier and fire spirits, how could they not be moved?

Shark One’s pair of fish eyes blinked, and he secretly chuckled to himself.

These guys did not know how terrifying this lord in front of them was!

Sure enough, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Old Ao!”

“Yes, my lord!”

Ao Qian received the order and opened his mouth to give a crazed howl. Violent essence energy instantly spread throughout the entire island!

Everyone’s expression changed drastically, all becoming hesitant and fretful.

“It’s a dragon cry! They are members of the dragon race!”

“This dragon has such formidable strength!”

“Better don’t poke our noses into what isn’t our business. There will naturally be the island masters they all to handle. We’d better go!”

These few people witnessing Ao Qian’s strength, how could they still have covetous eyes? All of them backed up and started to trade by themselves.

“Heh, a bunch of things who overestimate their own ability! To actually dare have wicked designs on His Excellency!” said Shark One. He was trying to suck up and curry favor, ingratiating himself.

Ye Yuan shot him a glance and discovered that this guy also did not seem to be as pure as imagined. It seemed like he was just a little simple-minded.

“Shark One, it’s our first time coming to this Nine Phoenix Island. Bring us to tour around,” Ye Yuan said.

Shark One hurriedly said, “Okie dokie. To be able to bring Your Excellency to tour the Nine Phoenix Island is Shark One’s honor! But ... we’d better hold off for a bit.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ye Yuan was stunned and said, “Why?”

“Your Excellency entered the Nine Phoenix Island without using the Clear Eye Token. The few island masters definitely won’t sit by idly and remain indifferent. If I didn’t guess wrongly, they are already on their way!” Shark One said.

Sure enough, Shark One’s voice had yet to fade when three figures slowly walked over.

The middle-aged man walking in the middle came close, gave a salute to Ao Qian and said, “This dragon race brother, I wonder what business you have for coming to my Nine Phoenix Alliance?”
