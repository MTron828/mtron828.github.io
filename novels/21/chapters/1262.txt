Chapter 1266: Empyrean Spirit Treasure!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, looking at the young man in amazement.

He really did not expect that he actually obtained the Kunwu Flower so effortlessly.

Before this, Ye Yuan thought of countless possibilities and was even prepared to fight to the bitter end.

The only thing that he did not think of was that the other party actually gave it to him so magnanimously.

Receiving the Kunwu Flower, Ye Yuan even had a feeling like he was dreaming.

“Senior, this ... Why?” Ye Yuan said in wonder.

The young man smiled and said, “I’ve long already found that Deathsoul Tree to be an eyesore, and you did it beautifully! In addition, I have to give face to Old Fart Immortal Grove’s successor. As for whether or not it can succeed, that will depend on you.”

Ye Yuan was stunned. He already heard ‘Immortal Grove’ this name more than once, but he did not know why this Divine Realm would be called Immortal Grove Region.

Looking at it now, this ‘Immortal Grove’ seemed to be a person’s name!

“May I ask Senior, just what is this ‘Immortal Grove’? Why do a lot of people call the Divine Realm as Immortal Grove Region?” Ye Yuan asked.

Kunwu smiled and said, “Divine Realm is just what you yourselves call it. The path of Martial Dao, the so-called Deity Realm, is merely just the starting point. The reason why the Divine Realm is called Immortal Grove Region is naturally that its sovereign is Old Fart Immortal Grove!”

“Old Fart Immortal Grove?” Ye Yuan frowned and said.

Kunwu nodded and said, “Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove is this Immortal Grove Region’s founder, and also sovereign. Cultivation reaching a certain realm, one can hew open a world. This Immortal Grove Region is the world that Old Fart Immortal Grove opened up.”

Not just Ye Yuan, everyone trembled all over when they heard these words.

Establishing a world, this was simply inconceivable means!

This Divine Realm that they lived in was actually established by a Martial Dao powerhouse!

Could a person really accomplish to this extent?

“E-Establishing a world! Senior, you aren’t joking around, right?”

Even if Ye Yuan was experienced and knowledgeable, his expression currently also became incomparably fascinating.

The impact of Kunwu’s words on him was too great.

“Heh, I’m not so free to crack jokes with you! Establishing a world isn’t considered some noteworthy thing. But establishing a world like the Immortal Grove Region, that’s not what an ordinary person can accomplish. Telling you now, you can’t understand either. If there comes a day where you can leave this Immortal Grove Region, you’ll naturally understand,” Kunwu said.

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath. This Kunwu’s words simply subverted the understanding of Martial Dao.

He had never thought that this Divine Realm was actually established through artificial means!

And also never thought that the human’s Martial Dao could attain such a terrifying realm.

This kind of thing, if not for Kunwu personally saying it, no one could imagine it.

‘Empyrean’ this term, Ye Yuan remembered it firmly in his heart.

In an instant, he was filled with a yearning for this realm!

A realm when achieved, one could establish a world. Just with his current strength, there was completely no way of imagining it.

Only after a long time did Ye Yuan come back to his senses from the shock and said to Kunwu, “Senior, Heavenly Dao is missing. So why ... do the existences inside this god-forbidden region seem to be unaffected?”

Ye Yuan was very curious. Regardless of whether the Deathsoul Tree or this Kunwu Divine Wood in front of him, Ye Yuan could not fathom at all.

This indicated that their boundary was what he was incapable of imagining.

Unlike the old ancestor as well as Shi Potian, Ye Yuan could clearly sense that their realms were being suppressed.

Kunwu smiled and said, “Because we all don’t belong to the Immortal Grove Region and didn’t attain Dao by practicing the laws here. So we won’t be suppressed by Heavenly Dao.”

Ye Yuan was incredibly shocked. Turned out that all of them came from another world?

But very soon, Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and was just about to speak, but was beaten to it by Kunwu.

“Don’t think anymore! This god-forbidden region’s existences, all can’t leave this region! Moreover, the Immortal Grove Region is already an arrow at the end of its flight and can’t endure us taking action at all. The moment we act, this Immortal Grove Region will probably not be far from utterly collapsing,” Kunwu said.

Ye Yuan had a look of disappointment on his face. He was just thinking that the Kunwu Divine Wood was not restrained by thatHeavenly Dao, so maybe he could make a move to deal with Kanuo. Ye Yuan did not expect that it was actually this situation.

He could not help saying gloomily, “Senior, what in the world happened to the Divine Realm? Why would Heavenly Dao be missing?”

Kunwu shrugged his shoulders and said, “Because Old Fart Immortal Grove died!”

This one sentence made Ye Yuan inwardly alarmed.

A powerhouse that could establish a world would actually die too?

Then what kind of existence would the powerhouse who killed him be like?

Kunwu continued, “However ... the Immortal Grove Region’s decline originally shouldn’t be so quick either. Five million years ago, Old Fart Immortal Grove severed his connection with the Immortal Grove Region. Ten to one, the odds are he’s dead. This Immortal Grove Region naturally declined with each passing day. But 100 thousand years ago, his lifeblood empyrean spirit treasure should have been refined by others, that’s why it would make the Immortal Grove Region’s Heavenly Dao become defective. Mystic Qi was drained empty, that’s why you all are unable to achieve Deity Realm.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, and he muttered, “Lifeblood empyrean spirit treasure?”

Kunwu looked at Ye Yuan with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Don’t you have it too? Furthermore ... it’s even more than one!”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, and he opened his eyes wide and said in disbelief, “Senior is talking about ... the Vast Heaven Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl?”

Kunwu smiled and said, “Otherwise? Apart from the Soul Suppressing Pearl, what else can finish off Deathsoul Tree that guy?”

These words, they actually carried thick grievances.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he knew that the Kunwu Divine Wood seemed to be on rather bad terms with the Deathsoul Tree.

However, Kunwu’s words still stirred up monstrous waves in Ye Yuan’s heart.

He could not figure out all along, just what origins the Vast Heaven Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl had.

Ye Yuan did not expect that they were actually the empyrean spirit treasures of the Immortal Grove Region’s sovereign, Immortal Grove Empyrean! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This level of supreme existence was not what the average person could conjecture at all.

No wonder even Absolute Heaven that kind of peerless powerhouses could not figure out the Vast Heaven Stele’s depths.

“Old Fart Immortal Grove had three empyrean spirit treasures. One is the World Suppressing Stele, one is the Soul Suppressing Pearl, and one is the Universe Sword. These three empyrean spirit treasures are closely related to the Immortal Grove Region. Old Fart Immortal Grove used them to nurture these three empyrean spirit treasures. So the moment the Universe Sword was lost, this Immortal Grove Region suffered a heavy blow. From then on, there was no longer Divine Dao,” Kunwu spoke with confidence and composure.

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath, but the astoundment in his heart kept failing to calm down.

The impact that Kunwu’s words brought to him was too great.

Every sentence that Kunwu uttered was this Immortal Grove Region’s extremely great heaven’s secret.

The people of the Divine Realm lived here one lifetime after another, but they never knew that this was merely just a space that someone else established.

In the end, they were merely frogs at the bottom of a well!

Outside had even broader space!

This 100 thousand years mystery was finally uncovered today. How could Ye Yuan not be shocked?

And what Kunwu disclosed was far more than this 100 thousand years mystery.

Ye Yuan never dreamed that the two inconceivable treasures which he obtained by chance were actually empyrean spirit treasures!
