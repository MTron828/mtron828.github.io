Chapter 1570 Elder Ye

“P-Protector Lin Dong!”

This powerhouse who suddenly appeared made Qin Xiao shudder all over.

Qin Xiao recognized that this person was really the Martial Tower’s high-level protector, Lin Dong.

In the Martial Tower, only those who reached third-layered heaven Divine Lord had the qualifications to be called high-level protector.

Why would such an existence help Ye Yuan?

But in the next moment, something that made him even more dumbstruck with amazement occurred.

Lin Dong bowed and gave a salute to Ye Yuan, saying respectfully, “Elder Ye, this subordinate was late in rescuing you and let you get frightened. Elder Ye, please punish.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Protector Lin doesn’t have to be like this. You came just in time. How are the things that I instructed you?”

Lin Dong said, “Already done.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “It’s been hard on Protector Lin.”

“E-Elder Ye?”

Hearing the two people’s conversation, Qin Xiao’s brain somewhat short-circuited, somewhat unable to recover to his senses for a moment.

Elder Ye?

What Elder Ye?

Also, Protector Lin was a third-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse, to actually respectfully address Ye Yuan as Elder.

This ... What in the world happened?

“Hey, what in the world happened? That’s a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, right? Why does he seem very respectful in front of Ye Yuan?”

“Elder Ye? Where is Ye Yuan an elder?”

“Can’t figure it out, but it seems like ... Ye Yuan’s current identity is extraordinary!”

...

The civilians in the city were all in a state of disbelief, speculating about Ye Yuan’s identity.

However, they were too far away from the imperial city, and they totally did not know what Ye Yuan’s so-called elder signified.

They only knew that Ye Yuan returning this time seemed to be incredibly awesome!

To be able to make a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse even stronger than their city lord be so respectful, this was not what the average person could accomplish!

But they did not understand that Qin Xiao was racking his brain in extreme terror.

Protector Lin Dong was the Martial Tower’s protector. The elder he called, apart from the Martial Tower’s elder, who else could there be?

Ye Yuan was the Martial Tower’s elder?

Qin Xiao felt somewhat flustered. An Origin Deity Realm becoming the Martial Tower’s elder, was this a joke?

However, it was not funny at all.

Lin Dong’s attitude toward Ye Yuan was already sufficient to explain everything.

Even if it was putting on an act for him to see, how could a Martial Tower’s protector be someone that Ye Yuan could invite.

Damn it, who can tell me what the hell happened?!

Qin Xiao started shouting frantically in his heart. The scene that happened before his eyes was too unreal.

“Qin Xiao, you dared to offend the newly-appointed Pill Tower’s elder? Why haven’t you knelt down to apologize for your offense?!” Lin Dong’s voice was akin to a great bell, shattering the last trace of fluke in Qin Xiao’s heart to smithereens.

A hint of panic flashed across in Qin Xiao’s eyes and he said in disbelief, “Impossible! Absolutely impossible! He ... He, an Origin Deity Realm brat, how can he possibly become the Pill Tower’s elder? P-Protector Lin, this ... this joke is too much!”

Lin Dong’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold shout, “Insolent thing! You dare to question the Pill Tower’s decision?”

Qin Xiao hurriedly waved his hand and said, “I-I ... No, but he ... but he ... is just Origin Deity Realm!”

Lin Dong snorted coldly and said, “Humph! Elder Ye’s Alchemy Dao, you’re unable to imagine it at all! Although he’s just in the Origin Deity Realm, his Alchemy Dao strength, even Second Elder expresses endless admiration!”

“S-Second Elder?”

At this time, Qin Xiao’s eyes were full of fear and trepidation. The boundless enthusiasm previously, not a trace of a shadow could be seen at this time.

His legs turned soft and he nearly lost his footing.

Pill Tower’s second elder, that was a god-like existence.

Even the second elder admired endlessly?

This ... What kind of concept was this?

Qin Xiao was unable to imagine it at all!

Ye Yuan slowly took out a token. The token was of purple-gold color. It was forged from purple-gold meteoric iron.

The token exuded a terrifying aura. It was actually a divine lord mystic treasure!

Thud!

Qin Xiao’s legs turned soft and he directly knelt down, his face full of shock and despair.

“P-Purple Gold Mystic Token!” Qin Xiao muttered under his breath.

Purple Gold Mystic Token was the symbol of the identity of the Pill Tower and Martial Tower’s elders. It was a low-level divine lord mystic treasure in itself and absolutely could not be faked.

With Ye Yuan flashing out the Purple Gold Mystic Token, the identity of an elder was already confirmed.

Qin Xiao’s head was a mess, feeling like the sky had fallen down.

What did he do?

Became mortal enemies with a Pill Tower’s elder?

One should not look at how he was a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse. In reality, he was not even a dog in front of the Pill Tower’s and Martial Tower’s elders!

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, if there weren’t a thousand, there were at least 800.

But the Pill Tower and Martial Tower’s elders did not surpass 20 when added up!

This was not on the same level at all!

For a Pill Tower elder to want to kill him, it was as simple as crushing an ant.

Qin Xiao completely could not understand, only 20 years had passed, how did Ye Yuan suddenly transform into a Pill Tower’s elder?

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s affairs merely happened in the recent few months.

When one was far away from authority, the powers that be would not intervene. Qin Xiao did not know the imperial city’s changes at all.

Even if he knew, he also would not associate this Ye Yuan in front of him with his mortal enemy Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan revealing his identity was undoubtedly a bolt out of the blue to Qin Xiao.

To the Qin Family, it was equivalent to sounding the funeral bell.

Drip ... Drip ...

A smell of urine spread out, drawing a series of sidelong glances.

Qin Xiao could not bear it. Qin Zhaoyun was even more deplorable than him, and he was actually frightened until he peed his pants in front of everyone.

Clearly, he also knew what Pill Tower elder meant.

In front of the Pill Tower’s elder, his Qin Family was like an ant.

Seeing Qin Xiao’s appearance, Qin Zhaoyun knew that the Qin Family was finished!

Lin Dong’s brows furrowed, casting a disdainful look at Qin Zhaoyun.

This guy was actually so disgraceful.

Ye Yuan looked at Qin Xiao and said coolly, “Back then, you told me that you’re the strong and you’re in charge of a capital city. If you wanted me to repent, I’ll have to repent! This sentence really inspired me to continuously become strong. Quite unfortunately for you, I’ve accomplished it.”

Qin Xiao opened his mouth, but could not say anything.

In his heart, it was full of bitterness.

This sentence coming out of Ye Yuan’s mouth right now was really ironic!

20 years ago, Ye Yuan was merely an ant-like existence in his eyes.

He did not need a reason to deal with Ye Yuan at all, crushing him domineeringly.

It was just that he never thought that Ye Yuan actually refused to give in to be disciplined.

Let alone did he think that 20 years passed, Ye Yuan already became an existence that made him look up to. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The two people’s status underwent a resplendent grand reversal.

“I ... I’m unresigned! E-Even if you’re the Pill Tower’s elder, you ... you also can’t decide my life and death at will! At least, I’m a protector of the Martial Tower too!” Qin Xiao harbored the last trace of a fluke and said.

Ye Yuan looked at him with pity and said coolly, “Why do you think I appeared in the capital city in an ostentatious manner? Qin Xiao, for this young master to sentence you, I naturally won’t give you any chance to get away. Protector Lin, say out your gains these few days for him to hear one by one.”

“Yes!”

Lin Dong answered respectfully and started announcing Qin Xiao counts of charges for so many years one by one.

Qin Xiao did not even have the last trace of hope anymore when it landed in his ears.

Ye Yuan was ... cutting the ground from under his feet, not even leaving him the last trace of a way out!
