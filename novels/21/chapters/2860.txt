Chapter 2866 Breathtaking Repair!

“You mean that over 1000 of us heavenly formation masters here, including a bunch of grade eight and grade nine heavenly formation masters, are not even as good as you, a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven?” Liu Yi looked at Ye Yuan and sneered coldly.

If you did not brag, then it was me who was boasting?

A punk who had just arrived was uttering wild ravings, truly ignorant!

Liu Yi was already prepared to make a move and send Ye Yuan off.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, instinctively wanting to reveal his identity as Hegemon Cloudmount’s disciple.

But that way, everything would become meaningless.

He would not be able to continue staying in this South Qi Giant City too.

Suddenly, his gaze glimpsed the Feng Xiaotian in the distance. Suddenly, he had a flash of inspiration, and he shouted, “You’re right! I’m not targeting anyone. The heavenly formation masters here are all trash! Clearly don’t need people to die, yet you insist on using human lives to stack it up. What are you all if not trash?”

One speech shocked the entire city!

Everyone put down the work in their hands and looked over here.

Among them naturally included Feng Xiaotian too.

Hearing this, his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

Where did this boy come from, being so arrogant?

Liu Yi was stunned. This kid really dared to continue!

“Hahaha, ignorant thing, I think that you’re simply here to cause trouble! The restoration of the entire grand array has been delayed by you alone! You deserve death!”

Liu Yi laughed with extreme fury, and his aura exploded and was about to exterminate Ye Yuan.

“STOP!”

Right at this time, he was stopped.

The one who shouted at him to stop was precisely Feng Xiaotian. Liu Yi hurriedly bowed and said, “City Lord Feng, this boy is deliberately disrupting the restoration of the grand array. This lowly one was just about to kill him, carry out capital punishment!”

Feng Xiaotian waved his hand and looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Little Brother, this place is the battlefield. You mustn’t shoot your mouth off! If you can’t do it, not just you, the sect behind you shall also suffer a great wrath!”

When Ye Yuan saw Feng Xiaotian come over, he could not help letting out a sigh of relief.

His judgment was indeed not wrong!

The former posturing sentence was in order to attract everyone’s attention.

And the latter sentence was the crux to move Feng Xiaotian.

He cherished his men very much. Actually, he was not willing to send these people to death! If there was a way that did not let these people die and could also repair the grand array, he would naturally be willing to use it.

Although he also knew that this possibility was very low.

In reality, Feng Xiaotian knew better than anyone that five days was not enough at all.

If these over 1000 people died, they would have died in vain too.

But even if the grand array was a fraction stronger, they would be able to kill a few more bloodkins too. Was using 1000 people to exchange for 2000 bloodkins worth it or not? Of course it was worth it!

This was a last resort that could not be helped!

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “I’m willing to write up a military writ! Give me an hour, I’ll restore this whole stretch! If I can’t do it, I’ll atone for my crime with my death!”

“City Lord Your Excellency, this boy is completely causing confusion in the morale of the troops! How can he, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, possibly do it?”

“Yeah, City Lord Your Excellency, stop talking nonsense with him. Time is being delayed by him!”

“This boy might be the blood race’s spy!”

Nobody believed Ye Yuan’s words at all.

Too nonsensical!

One person doing the work of a hundred people, furthermore, it only needed an hour?

Boasting was not done like this!

However, Feng Xiaotian waved his hand and said, “For the sake of everyone’s safety, this city lord is willing to gamble once! Even if I’m tricked, I won’t hesitate either!”

Yes, he was completely gambling!

Because even he himself also did not believe that Ye Yuan could do it.

But he was willing to gamble! There were far too many people who died.

A single less death, that was good too!

It was also precisely this compassion for ordinary soldiers than made his prestige in South Qi Giant City extremely high.

South Qi Giant City’s cohesiveness and combat power were also extremely shocking. Feng Xiaotian looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “There’s no need to write up a military writ. If you trick us, this city lord will personally send you on your way!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and came right in front of a damaged stretch of grand array.

Interlinked grand arrays were exceedingly complicated!

Forget about a measly little grade five heavenly formation master; even if it was a grade eight heavenly formation master, it was hard to see through it too.

These restoration works all had grade nine heavenly formation masters designate an area first with a few small-scale array formation demarcated before they could complete it.

No matter how complicated the array formation, it was also composed of one small array element after another.

Those low level heavenly formation masters could not see through it, but it did not hinder them from repairing the grand array. It was because these large formations were being analyzed little by little, until in the end, demarcated into some grade five and grade six small array formations.

This was like an assembly shop. Each person was in charge of their own production processes.

When all the pipelines were finished, the grand array would naturally be completed.

These low grade heavenly formation masters did not need to understand how these parts were produced. They just needed to install them.

The ones who truly understood all these were the grade nine heavenly formation masters!

This region’s restoration that Ye Yuan was going to complete, the difficulty was not just the workload of a hundred people. He even had to understand the principles of this entire area!

And he was only grade five!

These heavenly formation masters were insiders. They naturally did not believe that Ye Yuan could complete the restoration.

Ye Yuan did not make a move to repair but started observing the formation bases in this region, looking like a professional who knew what he was doing.

This scene naturally incurred a series of ridicules.

Liu Yi smiled coldly and said, “Putting on an appearance! Forget about this load of 100 people; if he can complete one person’s load, Your Father will go straight to the blood race’s camp to kill the enemy!”

Qi Li also said disdainfully, “City Lord Feng has compassion for his subordinates, how benevolent! It’s just that this kid is completely wasting everybody’s time!”

“Huhu, he already looked for 15 minutes and only looked at such a tiny bit! I want to see how he completes the repair within an hour!”

Ye Yuan just continued looking like this. After looking for very long, he did not have the intention of making a move either.

Logically speaking, this kind of restoration did not need to comprehend array formation at all.

Ye Yuan’s way of doing things was completely unnecessary in the eyes of the others.

Furthermore, didn’t repairing need time?

Such a complicated array formation, even if it was parsed until it was just grade five heavenly formations, that also required a huge amount of time to repair!

Along with the passage of time, everyone believed more and more that Ye Yuan was purely talking nonsense!

Feng Xiaotian also shook his head unwittingly. Sure enough, was it still a failed bet?

This kid was just a little talented. Then he had grandiose ambitions without real ability and engaged in empty talk?

It seemed like it was really the case!

However, he himself also did not harbor any hope, no?

……

Outside of the Absolute Heaven Barrier, the blood race army was currently gathering!

This time, the blood race was prepared to take down South Qi Giant City in one stroke!

Bloodpromise, this blood race army’s commander-in-chief, was an origin Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse.

He had already fought with Feng Xiaotian for several hundred years.

In the battle that had just ended, they paid the price of 13 Emperor Sakra Heaven deaths and forcefully riddled the city protecting grand array full of holes.

Hence, the blood race army gathered once more. They planned on bringing work to completion in one stroke!

Absolute Heaven Barrier’s passageway only had a very small gap. They were unable to send too many powerhouses in.

a

But, time after time of wearing away, South Qi Giant City was finally tottering on its feet too. “This time, this seat is going to perform a remarkable feat without equal! As long as we connect South Qi Giant City’s passageway, our blood race will be able to reinforce troops to the Absolute Heaven Barrier without ceasing! Absolute Heaven Barrier won’t be far from collapse too!” Bloodpromise was somewhat boiling over with excitement at this time. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Having fought fiercely with Heaven One Continent for several thousand years, they finally saw the dawn of hope.

And the crucial battle was being realized by him. How could he not be excited?

“Congratulations, Great Emperor Your Excellency! Felicitations, Great Emperor Your Excellency!” The subordinates gave their congratulations one after another.

At this time, a figure returned.

Bloodpromise was filled with lofty sentiments as he said with a smile, “Is there any activities at South Qi Giant City?”

That subordinate said, “Lord Bloodpromise, South Qi Giant City has stopped repairing the city protecting grand array!” Bloodpromise said in surprise, “The city protecting grand array is their lifeblood. How can they possibly give up?” The subordinate said, “It’s absolutely true! If Your Excellency doesn’t believe it, you can go over and take a look! It has already stopped for an hour!”

Bloodpromise laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Is this Feng Xiaotian indeed giving up? It looks like he has already come to his senses! The city protecting grand array no longer has the possibility of restoration! This seat won’t give him the chat! Five days! This seat only needs five days and I’ll be able to recover to my peak state! In order to breach the city, this seat is going to expend one Heavenly Blood Bead!”

An hour passed in a twinkle.

At this time, Ye Yuan was only left with the last 15 minutes.

The surrounding jeering already became enraged, cursing him. One hour had been forcibly delayed by this fool!

Why don’t you go and die?

Amidst countless cursing voices, Ye Yuan suddenly made a move!

One stream of divine essence after another was injected into that damaged grand array, without the slightest trace of stopping.

Those who were weaker could not even see Ye Yuan’s movements clearly.

Too fast!

Everyone was completely dumbfounded.

Were you here to be a freaking joke?

Who repaired grand arrays like how you’re repairing? Repairing the formation base required deducing the surrounding array elements bit by bit, and repairing it little by little.

This was a colossal project that took a lot of time.

But you’re not even looking?

In less than a hundred breaths of time, Ye Yuan already fired out God knows how many streams of divine essence. Then, he pointed at the void, that stretch of grand array was instantly lit up!

Motes of array elements emerged again.

This finger was like the Midas’ touch!

Those heavenly formation masters discovered to their astonishment that the array elements had actually already linked up together at goodness knows when!

The array elements were activated all at once, and then the formation base was consolidated, finally letting this large stretch of array formation be completely repaired!

Too stunning!

This move was like playing a game of go.

It was as if Ye Yuan’s moves previously were all planting foreshadowing.

Then the final move completely linked up his large dragon into one, instantly activating the whole thing!

This kind of means was simply fantastic!

If it was a grade nine heavenly formation master, accomplishing this was not hard.

But, Ye Yuan was merely just a grade five heavenly formation master!

He did not even understand the grand array. How did he do it?

At this moment, the over 1000 heavenly formation masters present were dead silent.

They even discovered that the region that Ye Yuan repaired was far greater than the area that he promised before!

This was also to say that he alone, used an hour’s time, to complete the load of 100 over people!

This efficiency was simply divine!

Could it be that this guy was a grade nine heavenly formation master to begin with, and that he just concealed his strength?

Impossible!

This move, even a grade nine heavenly formation master could not do it too!

Even if it was a grade nine heavenly formation master, they would need to deduce it little by little too.

Of course, their speed was on a completely different level than low levels.

Yang Qing’s mouth curled, and he said, “This guy snatched all the limelight again! AHHHHH! When can it my, Lord Qing’s, turn to steal the limelight!”
