Chapter 2304: Second Sage’s Friend

“Master!”

“Hehe, Master, we’re here! Tsk tsk, really didn’t expect that I can actually come to the number one alchemy holy land in this lifetime!”

When Yun Yi saw Ye Yuan, he bowed respectfully.

While Ning Siyu was much more cheerful, looking around everywhere, clicking her tongue in wonder.

To her, Cloudheart Realm was a legendary place, could view from a distance but could not play with disrespectfully.

But today, she actually walked into Cloudheart Realm herself and was going to battle in alchemy with the myriad regions’ heaven chosen.

This sort of feeling was like she was dreaming.

Such a grand occasion was a tempering opportunity that was extremely hard to come by for any alchemist. Ye Yuan naturally would not forget his disciples.

Yun Yi’s talent was extremely high. Under Ye Yuan’s teaching, he already stepped into Ancestor Realm not long ago.

Ning Siyu’s strength was second only to Yun Yi. Her foundation was even more solid than Yun Yi’s. She had already reached grand completion Dao Realm too.

When Ye Yuan saw the two people, he smiled and said, “The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time has as many experts as clouds. The two of you mustn’t be self-conceited and must study hard.”

The two people hurriedly answered, “Yes, Master!”

Arriving at Cloudheart Realm this time, only now did Ye Yuan know that the alchemy world truly had talents lying in concealment.

Ignoring other things, the talents of Zhao Zixuan few people were absolutely rarely seen in the world.

Their strength made many alchemy powerhouses who were a generation older perspire from embarrassment.

Not just them, in the various major holy lands, there was no lack of Ancestor Realm youngsters too.

As for the older generation Ancestor Realm powerhouses, that went even more without saying.

Even though they were not worth mentioning when compared to Ye Yuan, to Yun Yi they all, it was definitely an unprecedented experience.

Right then, another group of people entered Cloudheart Realm.

Ye Yuan looked over, only to see several Heavenly Emperors slowly walk over.

Behind them even followed several familiar people: Empyrean Pilljade and Empyrean Flutterfeather, as well as those reclusive alchemy ancient families.

They all came from the Southern Border, so it was about time that they arrived.

When Empyrean Pilljade saw Ye Yuan and Yun Yi, he could not help being taken aback, then his face immediately turned black.

“Humph! Unfilial child!”

Yun Yi had an awkward look and could only keep silent.

Ye Yuan also pretended not to hear and went forward to greet Empyrean Flutterfeather, saying with a smile, “Brother Flutterfeather, how have you been!”

As for the Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure by the side, Ye Yuan directly ignored him.

He had never seen Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure before, but coming together with Flutterfeather, it could only be Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure.

Empyrean Flutterfeather was slightly awkward as he said, “Younger Brother Ye, turns out that you’ve arrived long ago.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “It’s been a few days. Since Brother Flutterfeather came, why not go to my Feather Mountain to stay, it will also be convenient for you and me to interact.”

Empyrean Flutterfeather did not speak yet when the Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure beside said unhappily, “No need, we have a place to go. Flutterfeather, let’s go.”

“Master ...” At this time, Yun Yi suddenly spoke up.

His face was slightly embarrassed, Ye Yuan knew what was going on with one look.

This kid was still rather filial and wanted to find a better place for Empyrean Pilljade.

It was just that Ye Yuan had not spoken yet when he heard Pilljade say with a cold snort, “No need! This empyrean hasn’t fallen so far to the extent where that I need an unfilial child to give alms!”

Done talking, he also galloped away at full speed.

Along the way, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure said with a cold snort, “This brat really doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Really think that he can look down on the likes of us after he became whatever Second Sage?”

Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun smiled coldly and said, “So what if Second Sage? In front of the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest, that level of powerhouse, he’s merely a junior. He really treats himself as someone notable? He doesn’t know the terror of such powerhouses at all. Would they really pay attention to him, this sort of junior?”

Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun was the person that Empyrean Pilljade paid allegiance to.

He was an Eight-star Alchemy God himself!

These two people racked their brains before getting a qualification to enter Cloudheart Realm.

After all, Empyrean Flutterfeather and Empyrean Pilljade were both Ancestor Realm powerhouses and barely had the qualifications to enter the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference.

Except, seeing Ye Yuan the moment they entered, it made them feel as uncomfortable as having eaten a fly.

This brat made them lose out on a huge profit.

“Look at that brat’s cocky appearance. It’s like we can’t survive in this Cloudheart City after we leave him!” Pilljade said with a sneer.

Entering the city, the Heavenly Emperors naturally did not dare to be unbridled.

They played the tyrant in the Southern Border, but arriving here, they had to tuck their tails between their legs and behave.

“Little Brother, we came from the Southern Border. I wonder if there are any accommodations arranged?” Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun said respectfully to an Empyrean.

That Empyrean had a proud look on his face, completely looking down on these few Heavenly Emperors.

The Heavenly Emperors that were hard to come across outside, he saw too many every day.

The Medicine Ancestor’s lineage had this arrogance.

The Empyrean brought everyone to a residence. When the few Heavenly Emperors saw, their faces immediately became extremely ugly.

This residence had fishes and dragons jumbled together and already had too many people staying.

What was even more terrible was that Heavenly Emperors stayed two in a room, Empyreans ... six in a room.

Regardless of whether it was Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun or Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure, or even Empyrean Pilljade they all, which one wasn’t a mighty figure who commanded a region? When had they lived so shabbily before?

Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun’s expression was rather ugly as he said to that Empyrean, “This little brother, can you change rooms for us? The price can be discussed!”

That Empyrean smiled disdainfully and said, “Those who can enter Cloudpill Summit, how many do you think lack money? During the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time, there are plenty of guys like you that are fishing in muddied waters and are long already overcrowded! Want to stay, then stay; not staying, then get lost!”

The few people’s faces immediately became black as the bottom of a pot.

Arriving at this Cloudheart Realm, even a measly little Empyrean dared to order them about, not giving the slightest bit of face.

Really aggravating people to death!

Except, they had the anger but nowhere to vent.

If they annihilated this Empyrean with a slap, they would be annihilated by somebody with a slap later on.

Helpless, they could only stay temporarily.

Their residence was very crammed, it was clearly partitioned out temporarily.

Only after arriving here did Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun they all know their insignificance.

The other Heavenly Emperors were also all squeezed in a small space, the atmosphere foul everywhere, unable to cultivate at all. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Right at this moment, a figure slowly walked in, his face radiating awe without being angry.

The powerful aura suddenly made everyone become tense.

That Empyrean’s expression changed and he said respectfully, “Lord Azurefeather!”

Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure and Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun’s faces both changed wildly. Azurefeather’s illustrious reputation, it had struck their ears like a thunderclap.

The two people hurriedly bowed and said, “Offering greetings to Lord Azurefeather!”

Azurefeather nodded slightly. Sweeping over everyone’s faces, he said coolly, “Who is Flutterfeather? Who is Pilljade?”

The two people’s hearts turned cold, not knowing what happened, but they still answered.

“This lowly one is Flutterfeather!”

“This lowly one is Pilljade!”

Azurefeather said coolly, “The few of you, follow me.”

The few people did not dare to disobey and could only follow after.

Azurefeather brought them to a courtyard and said coolly, “You guys stay here then, someone will make arrangements for your daily life.”

The few people exchanged glances, their faces surprised.

They did not know why they would suddenly get such superior treatment.

One had to know, the people coming and going from this place, most of their auras were extremely strong; far above theirs.

No need to ask and they also knew that this place must be a place that only distinguished guests could stay.

“Lord Azurefeather, may I be so bold as to ask, why suddenly let us stay in such a nice place?” Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure said.

Azurefeather said coolly, “Since you all are Second Sage’s friends, then you naturally can’t live too shabbily.”
