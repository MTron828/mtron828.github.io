Chapter 2328: Primeval War Realm!

“Since they were invincible, how did the human race defeat them?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, a look of incomprehension showing on his face.

Jian Yunxin smiled slightly and said, “There is no doubt that Dao Ancestors are strong, but they have a fatal weakness. And our human race grasped precisely this fatal weakness. That’s how we completely defeated them.”

Got to say, Ye Yuan’s curiosity was completely aroused.

This was the Heavenspan World’s top secret. He could not imagine it at all previously. It turned out that Dao Ancestors actually still had weaknesses.

“What weakness?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Jian Yunxin said, “The law blessing of Dao Ancestors is periodic, and it is not eternal. Every epoch, the law blessing of Dao Ancestors will be taken back by Heavenly Dao. And in this period, Dao Ancestors will return to their most primitive state, becoming ordinary people. And it’s this period that’s the weakest period of Dao Ancestors. In the last epoch, the human race had been secretly accumulating strength all along, and exploited this weakness of Dao Ancestors, dragging them down the horse.”

Ye Yuan’s mind shook wildly when he heard. Only then did he know that Dao Ancestors still had such a secret.

He had always thought that Dao Ancestors were eternal and invincible. He did not expect that they actually still had such a weakness.

It was just that an epoch was too long. Hence, in the eyes of people like Immortal Grove and Dustless, Dao Ancestors’ invincibility was eternal.

“Since that’s the case, why don’t the present Dao Ancestors take action to suppress the divine race. Right now, the human race’s Dao Ancestors shouldn’t have been taken back by Heavenly Dao, right?” Ye Yuan asked.

Speaking of this, Jian Yunxin revealed a trace of disdain and said, “The current Dao Ancestors, heh heh, with the blessing of laws, they are indeed very strong. It’s just that you’re underestimating the divine race too much. You can imagine, if a cat is blessed by laws and a tiger is blessed by laws, can their strength be the same?”

“The divine race’s eight lineage’s progenitors were former Dao Ancestors. Although the power of law that was blessed on them was taken back by Heavenly Dao, they could personally comprehend the power of laws. An epoch of comprehension is no joke. Back then, the human race’s top experts almost died out and failed to kill these ancestors too. They could only suppress them. Now, their strength is fully restored; each person’s strength is not beneath Dao Ancestor.”

“In contrast, the present human race’s Dao Ancestors are merely a bunch of people who got hella lucky, obtaining the crystal of law in the Heavenspan Battle by chance. That’s how they have today’s glory.”

Ye Yuan sucked in a cold breath when he heard. He did not expect that the strength of the divine race’s forefathers was actually strong to such an extent that they did not even fear Dao Ancestors too.

Furthermore, hearing Jian Yunxin’s tone, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ strength was likely not too far off from Dao Ancestor even if he was not as good.

His strength might even be on par with Dao Ancestors!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was indeed the most terrifying existence among the Deva Fifth Blights!

Ye Yuan reckoned that he was likely an existence who could have a dialogue with Dao Ancestors.

But looking at it now, both race’s top combat powers were both fearful of each other. Hence, they did not make a move.

The divine race was clearly waiting, waiting for that moment when Heavenly Dao took back the power of law.

At that time, the humans would no longer have powerhouses that could compete with the divine race’s progenitors anymore.

Ye Yuan suddenly thought of Daymeld and wondered if he could be the ancestor of one of the divine race’s lineages. Hence, he opened his mouth and asked.

Hearing Ye Yuan mention Daymeld, Jian Yunxin could not help getting a shock and said, “There’s actually still such a thing? Young Friend Ye, you’ve rendered a huge contribution to the human race! This Daymeld is the second generation ancestor of the divine race’s Heaven Lineage. Even though his strength isn’t as good as a progenitor’s, it’s also not far away. Back then, the human race expended a tremendous price in order to suppress him. I heard that in order to suppress him, the human race lost many Deva Fourth and Fifth Blight powerhouses! Once he comes into being, he shall be a major combat power of the divine race.”

Ye Yuan was also incredibly shocked after hearing it.

Back then, he felt that those words that Daymeld said were somewhat bragging.

Looking at it now, what he said was not false.

Daymeld’s strength was likely much stronger than Originguard.

“Alright, better talk about official business then. Even though Young Friend Ye’s combat power is unparalleled, concerning the Heavenspan World’s major matters, you still can’t worry about them for now,” Jian Yunxin suddenly said.

Ye Yuan raised his brows and asked curiously, “Oh, what is senior looking for me for?”

Jian Yunxin said, “Actually, ever since Father attained Dao, he calculated that the human race will have this calamity. Hence, in this epoch, he has been preparing for this catastrophe ...”

When Ye Yuan listened to what Jian Yunxin said, he was filled with deep respect in his heart toward Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets.

It turned out that ever since Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets attained Dao, he had been making plans for the human race’s future.

He spread the Jian Family’s forces throughout the Heavenspan World. It was actually to recruit talents for the human race.

Except, even though the humans won the apocalyptic great battle, it was a pyrrhic victory too. Countless Dao teachings became extinct.

After the human race had been through billions of years of recuperation, they finally recovered some vitality.

It was just that compared to their prime, this kind of human race was still not worth mentioning.

The Ancient God Battlefield that Ye Yuan had gone to before, was actually the ruins of the Doomsday Battle.

The area that he had gone to back then, was merely the tip of the iceberg of the Ancient God Battlefield.

Although that place was a wasteland, there were countless soul treasures hidden.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets expended immeasurable effort, extracting the top 100 human legacies from the Ancient God Battlefield.

Among them, there were ten legacies that were left behind by the human race’s top major powers back then, their power boundless, already reaching the level of law.

Apart from this, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets even opened up a small world called Primeval War Realm with a great divine ability.

This small world was used to select the most outstanding geniuses of the human race, entering the land of inheritance, and accepting the human race’s top legacies.

However, the divine race’s suddenly coming into being disrupted all of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ arrangement, making these geniuses have no time to grow up.

But to act was always better than not doing anything. It was ultimately better than allowing one to be seized without putting up a fight.

Taking advantage of the fact that Dao Ancestors still had deterrent power, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets had to carry out this plan in advance.

Jian Yunxin coming here was in order to invite Ye Yuan to enter the Primeval War Realm and take part in the battle of geniuses.

Ye Yuan shuddered with fear when he heard it. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets actually extracted a hundred inheritances from the ruins of the war. This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

However, this was a huge project. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets likely expended a tremendous effort on this.

“Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets exhausted himself and racked his brains for the human race. This Ye has wronged him. Senior, please apologize to Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets on this Ye’s behalf.” Ye Yuan said sincerely.

He previously thought that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and many others, these major powerhouses, hurdled up like turtles, each and every one of them being self-centered. That was how the human race fall into such a dangerous situation.

Looking at it now, it was him who wronged Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was the human race’s true hero, being worthy of Ye Yuan’s respect.

Toward such a person, Ye Yuan had never been stingy with his admiration. A mere apology was naturally nothing. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jian Yunxin waved his hand and said, “Young Friend Ye’s actions and behavior, this emperor has seen it. It’s true that Father’s actions are worthy of respect, but you overturning the raging tides is similarly worthy of admiration.”

Jian Yunxin said these words from the bottom of his heart too. Once Originguard’s scheme succeeded, the consequences would be too ghastly to contemplate.
