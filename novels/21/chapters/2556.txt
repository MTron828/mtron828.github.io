Chapter 2562: Blockhead!

“You don’t hate me?”

“Hate??Huhu,?this old man wants to thank you! If not for your timely warning, this old man would probably continue to have no accomplishments to my name just like this for life!”

“Then on what basis do you think that I’ll take you in as a disciple?”

“Accepting or not is up to you, to acknowledge or not is up to me! This old man is just asking for his peace of mind!”

“You, an exalted Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, can really put aside your ego and serve by my side?”

“Slaving like a bull or horse, I won’t hesitate!”

“Okay then. From today onward, you’ll stay in Nation Teacher Manor and be a servant! Remember, from now on, without my permission, you’re not allowed to refine pills!”

“Yes!”

… …

Just like that, Lin Lan became a measly little servant of Nation Teacher Manor.

This matter shocked the entire imperial city once more!

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum actually willingly ran to Nation Teacher Manor to be a servant, it was hard not to cause a sensation even if one did not want it to.

Lin Lan was not allowed to refine pills in Nation Teacher Manor. He could only soak in the medicine storehouse every day and sort out and extract heavenly medicines.

This was simply the greatest torture and humiliation to someone who had once stood at the pinnacle of Eastward Country’s alchemy path.

People all thought that Lin Lan would definitely leave.

However, they were all wrong!

Lin Lan actually persisted!

In the beginning, everyone was somewhat apprehensive of his former identity and strength.

But gradually, the servants in Nation Teacher Manor discovered that Lin Lan did not dare to talk back or attack at all.

Hence, they became brazen and fearless.

Many servants even started bullying Lin Lan.

Whatever dirty work and tiring work was thrown at him.

Lin Lan did not reject anyone who came!

Tang Yu and Ye Yuan were observing Lin Lan from a secret place. Tang Yu could not resist saying, “Big Brother, isn’t it a bit too much for us to treat Lin Lan like this? Right now, rumors outside are all saying that Lord Nation Teacher is narrow-minded and doesn’t have forbearance!”

Just earlier, a maid from Nation Teacher Manor even bullied Lin Lan a little, making him go and empty the lavatory bucket.

Lin Lan went to pour it away without making a sound.

Ye Yuan gave Tang Yu a glance and said with a smile, “What about you? Do you think so too?”

Tang Yu smiled awkwardly and said, “How can it be! Big Brother is forthright and is clear about what to love or hate. Back then, when I insulted Big Brother like that, Big Brother didn’t even do anything to me and just punished me lightly. How can you be a narrow-minded person? It’s just that public clamor can melt metal!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Would we martial artists still care about what others say? Come, go over and take a look.”

When Lin Lan saw Ye Yuan, he hurriedly bowed and said, “I pay respects to Master Ye!”

Ye Yuan gave Lin Lan a glance and said with a sigh, “It’s been half a year. You didn’t seem to have grown at all!”

Lin Lan was taken aback and said, “This old man is ashamed!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re not convinced!”

Lin Lan trembled and said, “This disciple doesn’t dare!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You feel that I’m making you be a servant and not allowing you to refine pills, it’s just in order to make fun of you? To test you?”

Lin Lan’s gaze revealed a look of confusion.

Those eyes seemed to be saying, wasn’t it so?

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “You regained your original aspirations, but it’s just that your comprehension ability is too poor! You’re indeed not qualified enough to be my disciple! Compared to my disciples in the Lower Realms, you’re far too lacking!”

By the side, Tang Yu almost sprayed out a mouthful of old blood.

In the entire Eastward Country, apart from Ye Yuan, Lin Lan was the alchemy path’s number one person!

This kind of powerhouse actually did not even have the qualifications to be his disciple?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan actually said that Lin Lan, this Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, grade two heavenly alchemist, could not even compare to his disciples in the Lower Realms!

This … was a little too jarring!

Now, Tang Yu was extremely certain that Ye Yuan was deliberately suppressing Lin Lan!

Actually, according to Ye Yuan’s criteria for accepting disciples, Lin Lan was indeed far worse than Yun Yi!

Yun Yi worked as an apprentice in the Pill Tower and understood Ye Yuan’s intentions very quickly.

But it had been half a year, Lin Lan was still completely confused.

His intelligence was too low!

When accepting disciples, Ye Yuan’s requirements for talent were not high.

What he wanted was someone who held awe and veneration in their hearts toward Alchemy Dao. Someone who could restrain their temper.

With just a glance in seeing Lin Lan again, Ye Yuan was sure that this former nation teacher regained his original aspirations for Alchemy Dao.

He was different now.

However, he was a blockhead.

In this half a year, he really did these miscellaneous chores as miscellaneous chores.

Without any accomplishments!

If Ye Yuan still did not come out to give guidance, this guy could do it stupidly for all his life!

Therefore, that was why Ye Yuan said that his intelligence was too low.

After all, an uncut jade like Yun Yi could not be encountered at will.

Lin Lan did not think that there was anything and said respectfully, “Yes, this disciple is slow-witted. Master Ye, please say it explicitly!”

Ye Yuan did not speak, but he casually picked up a stalk of Dragonbone Grass, and started extracting.

The moment the Dao fire arose, the Dragonbone Grass melted rapidly.

Lin Lan’s pupils constricted, his gaze full of amazement.

Very soon, Ye Yuan finished extracting, looked at Lin Lan, and said, “How does my extracting the Dragonbone Grass now compare to back then?”

Lin Lan drew a deep breath and said, “Master Ye’s strength is many times stronger than back then!”

The first time the two people wagered, Ye Yuan extracting the Dragonbone Grass was already transcendent back then.

But the extraction back then, when compared to this earlier, was on a completely different level!

The shock in Lin Lan’s heart could be imagined!

So many years had passed, Ye Yuan was actually still spending energy on the extraction of Dragonbone Grass!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I used 18 years to cultivate the extraction of the Dragonbone Grass to the extreme! I used eight years’ time to refine the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! I used more than half a year to cultivate the Dragonbone Grass to seventh grade! And then I used another full year’s time to cultivate the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to grand completion ninth grade! With over 20 kinds of basic heavenly pills, I only used four years’ time to cultivate them to grand completion ninth grade! As for the Jasper Regeneration Pill, I only used several days to cultivate it to ninth grade! I know you never believed it all along that it was my first time refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill. However, that’s the truth!”

“This … How is this possible?” The words pushed Lin Lan’s shock until it could not be surpassed.

That was right. He never believed it all along that it was Ye Yuan’s first time refining it.

But now, Ye Yuan recounted his alchemy experiences after ascending in detail from the very beginning. Only then did he know that that was really the first time!

But only until now did he know that it turns out those 20 kinds of basic heavenly pills, Ye Yuan actually cultivated all of them to the grand completion realm of ninth grade!

He only used four years!

This was simply too exaggerated!

This was a report card. Furthermore, it was dazzling to the extreme kind of report card!

Placed across True Yang Heavenly Domain, one probably could not find a second one!

Only at this moment did Lin Lan become deeply aware of Ye Yuan’s terror!

Ye Yuan said, “Telling you these is not for the intention of showing off, but for you to understand that here at my place, one’s foundation is the most important thing! I, Ye Yuan, won’t do this kind of boring thing like taking revenge. If I’m not willing to take you in, you naturally won’t be able to enter this door! Since you came in, there’s no shortcut at my place. There is only hard work. I’ll give you one year’s time. After one year, if you can refine a seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, I’ll officially take you in as my disciple! If you can’t do it, leave on your own.”
