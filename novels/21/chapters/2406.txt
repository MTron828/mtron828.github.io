Chapter 2412: If I Don’t Let You Shout, You Won’t Be Able to Yell Out a Single Word!

After running long-distance for three days and nights, Nineorigin was very tired.

He felt like as soon as he stopped, he would fall asleep at once!

To a peak Eight-marks powerhouse, three days and three nights on the road was nothing.

There was only one reason for his exhaustion!

During these three days, he exhausted all of his strength.

He did not know how fast Ye Yuan was, but he knew that Ye Yuan was definitely very fast.

Therefore, he could only flee desperately.

Heaven took pity on him, he finally saw the outline of the camp.

As long as he returned to the camp, even if Ye Yuan had exceedingly formidable abilities, he would not be able to do anything to him either.

Ye Yuan could kill the Yuan Zhen who just entered Nine-marks with one sword, but it was absolutely impossible to beat so many Nine-marks experts in the camp.

“Damn it, after going back this time, I have to report to the clan elders to have them mobilize middle and late-stage Nine-marks supreme powerhouses, and kill Ye Yuan at all costs! This guy is seriously too terrifying!”

Recalling Ye Yuan fusing three great laws, Nineorigin still had lingering fear in his heart until now.

Being able to jump realms and kill the divine race’s divine child, this kind of means was really too sick!

If Ye Yuan reached Deva Fourth or Fifth Blight, who else in the entire divine race could be his match?

At that time, probably even Progenitor Tian Qing might not be his match too!

“Who’s there?”

At this time, two figures rose up from the camp, questioning Nineorigin.

When Nineorigin saw these two people, he could not help crying with joy.

After three days and nights of suffering, he finally escaped with his life!

“It’s me, Nineorigin!” Nineorigin said in a clear voice.

When those two people heard Nineorigin speaking, they immediately lowered their vigilance. But they still asked in surprise, “Nineorigin, why did you return to the camp alone? Isn’t your Divine Children Legion ambushing the myriad races’ coalition forces in Upper Essence Valley?”

Nineorigin was one of the army’s commanders. Leaving his post without authorization was a major thing. They naturally did not dare to be sloppy about it.

Nineorigin was still fleeing towards this side in a hurry. Even if he was already so near the camp, he still did not dare to relax.

As he sprinted, Nineorigin shouted, “The Divine Children Legion has lost more than half in terms of casualties. They are fleeing everywhere in disorder now, Chief Commander Tian Xu died in battle! Yuan Zhen, Tian Zhao, Li Qing, the three lords died in battle! Kong Ru, don’t stop me. I have an important matter to report to Lord Daymeld!”

Daymeld was precisely that one who Ye Yuan encountered at the Asura Blood Pool back then.

Now, his strength already fully recovered, and he returned to the clan. He became a commander of the divine race army!

However, he was not in his camp but in the base camp of the divine race. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Nineorigin wanted to report to him, but he had to rely on this camp’s powerhouses.

Otherwise, he did not dare to leave by himself at all.

Nineorigin was already scared out of his wits by Ye Yuan.

While the two opposite were struck dumb with amazement by the series of news thrown out by Nineorigin.

No need to guess and they also knew that something big happened!

Otherwise, why would Nineorigin be in such dismay?

In virtually a blink of an eye, Nineorigin already rushed above the sky of the camp.

Without the slightest hesitation, he landed toward the camp.

He did not even have time to greet Kong Ru two people.

The moment his feet landed on the ground, Nineorigin’s heart was finally at ease!

Even if Ye Yuan had exceedingly formidable abilities, he also would not dare to come here and capture him!

“Hahaha ... I finally escaped! I finally escaped! Ye Yuan, I, Nineorigin, escaped alive! The next time, it will be the date of your death!”

Three days and three nights of desperate fleeing, Nineorigin did not dare to relax in the least bit.

He was afraid that Ye Yuan would find out at any time, and then chase after.

Now that this nerve was loosened up, he could not resist letting out a burst of wild laughter.

“Oh? Is that so? If I capture you from here, would you feel even more despair or not?”

Right then, a voice seemed to come out from the netherworld, making Nineorigin’s hair stand on end.

He was too familiar with this voice. It was Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan actually chased into the camp!

Was he mad?

Ye Yuan’s figure slowly walked out of the void, having a look of amusement on his face.

His spatial law already reached the level of rank two source.

It was really rare for someone to be able to surpass him in movement technique in this world.

Even if he set off two days later than Nineorigin, he caught up at the eleventh hour too.

When Kong Ru two people saw Ye Yuan appear, their faces could not help changing wildly.

Where did this guy who appeared like a ghost pop out from?

Before this, they were actually completely clueless!

When Nineorigin saw Ye Yuan, all the hair on his body stood up, and he turned around and ran without thinking.

He wanted to run in the direction of the camp, that place had the divine race’s major powers!

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of making a move, he just looked at Nineorigin with a sneer.

“Lord Yu Qing, help!” Nineorigin shouted with all the strength in his body, his voice instantly spreading throughout the camp.

He used the last of his strength, wanting to run towards the camp.

But he discovered to his shock that even though he used all of his strength, his movements were slow to the extreme.

His entire person seemed to be in slow motion, running forward.

His movements were very exaggerated, but he did not even take a single step out.

Time law!

Ye Yuan imposed time law on his body!

There was merely a hundred steps away from the camp currently.

But Nineorigin who had time law imposed felt like it was far on the horizon!

When Kong Ru two people saw this scene, their pupils could not help shrinking, looking toward Ye Yuan with a look of horror.

This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

However, Nineorigin’s yell spread out.

The entire camp was immediately alarmed.

Several dozen powerful auras burst out of every corner of the camp in an instant.

These powerful auras rushed over to this side one after another.

But Ye Yuan ignored them. He just arrived behind Nineorigin at an appropriate speed and tapped lightly, and he fell to the ground softly.

Time law vanished, Nineorigin looked at Ye Yuan with the appearance of a lump of mud, his eyes full of despair.

“Ye Yuan, you entered the camp to capture me, it’s seeking your own death! Lord Yu Qin is a middle-stage Nine-marks supreme powerhouse! You’re dead for sure!” Nineorigin said hatefully.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a light chuckle, “Do you think that you being able to yell out was your own ability?”

Nineorigin’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan in horror.

Could it be that this guy let him yell out on purpose?

Otherwise, with Ye Yuan’s strength, restraining him then bringing him away in an instant, the people in the camp probably all would not have time to react!

“You ... You ...” Nineorigin was shocked until he could not speak.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Do you think that your voice can be faster than time law?” If I don’t let you shout, you won’t be able to yell out a single word! But I’m magnanimous. I’ll let you shout! Let you alarm these people! Then I’ll take you away in front of them! At that time, will you feel even more in despair?”

Nineorigin opened his mouth wide, looking at Ye Yuan in shock as he muttered, “D-Devil! You’re a devil! However, you can’t possibly take me away from Lord Yu Qin’s hands!”

Right as he was talking, a powerful to the extreme aura arrived in an instant!

This person’s aura burst through the firmament, and he already reached peak middle-stage Nine-marks!

A surge of Heavenly Dao power instantly enveloped over toward Ye Yuan.
