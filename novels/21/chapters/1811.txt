Chapter 1815 Tit For Ta

Ye Yuan’s words made the sect master stunned.The other nine people all used eyes like looking at a fool to look at Ye Yuan.

This guy was really stubborn!

“Ye Yuan, do you know what sounding this Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum means? The entire sect from top to bottom, regardless of which cultivation method, martial technique, medicinal pill you want, even if you want this sect master to personally take action, it’s not a problem. As long as it’s something that the sect can do, this sect master won’t refuse!”

The sect master thought that Ye Yuan did not know what sounding the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum signified and deliberately reminded Ye Yuan.

The nine great skill-imparting elders also all looked toward Ye Yuan. They felt that the sect master’s explanation was already detailed enough.

They felt that Ye Yuan would not use such a big favor to do this sort of silly thing.

However, Ye Yuan said firmly, “Thank you, Sect Master, for the reminder. Ye Yuan only has one request; that’s to take Qian Ye’s life!”

The sect master frowned and looked at Jiang Hong.

Jiang Hong understood the sect master’s meaning. His expression was also very ugly and he briefly recounted the conflict between Ye Yuan and Qian Ye.

After the sect master listened, he could not help falling silent.

Ye Yuan was not in a hurry either, quietly waiting for the sect master’s reply.

After a moment, the sect master slowly opened his mouth and said, “Ye Yuan, why not ... you reconsider it. This is a one-in-a-blue-moon opportunity for you. A measly little Qian Ye is just a passerby on your road to greatness. Using such a big favor to exchange for his life, it’s not worth it.”

Finished talking, the sect master looked at Ye Yuan calmly. He felt that Ye Yuan was a clever person and should know how to make his choice.

However, Ye Yuan’s performance disappointed him.

It was only to see the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth reveal a hint of a sneering expression as he said coolly, “Sect Master, don’t use this kind of high-sounding words to dodge it. Putting it bluntly, you merely can’t bear to part with Qian Ye, this genius disciple, that’s all. Lord Sect Master, you cannot ... have the best of both worlds!”

The moment these words came out, the nine great elders’ faces all changed.

Jiang Hong even reproached him, saying, “Insolence! Boy, how do you speak to the sect master?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’m just telling the truth!”

The sect master’s expression was also a little unsightly. While this boy’s talent was great, he was also too arrogant.

But he had to admit that Ye Yuan this kid was not easy to hoodwink.

Just as Ye Yuan said, he could not bear to kill Qian Ye.

Standing from his perspective, naturally the more geniuses, the better for the sect.

While Ye Yuan, this prodigy throughout the ages, held extraordinary significance to the sect, Qian Ye was similarly a rare genius.

Every genius concerned the sect’s future, so he wanted to have the best of both worlds.

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan was even harder to deal with than he imagined, seeing through his intentions at a glance.

For some time, the scene was somewhat awkward.

The sect master’s face fell and he said, “If I say no?”

Ye Yuan seemed to have long expected and shrugged his shoulders and said coolly, “The sect talks like letting out a fart. This kind of sect, I feel that there isn’t anything left for me.”

The sect master’s aura turned heavy and he said in a cold voice, “So, if I don’t agree, you’re planning on betraying the sect?”

It was not that he definitely could not kill Qian Ye, but Ye Yuan’s words put him somewhat on the spot.

In the Shadowmoon Sect, he could control everything. But Ye Yuan’s appearance made him have a feeling of not being able to control.

This feeling made him very displeased.

Even so, Ye Yuan sounded the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Sect Master’s words aren’t appropriate! It’s not that I want to betray the sect, but it’s the sect that abandoned me. Qian Ye wanted to kill me several times, but the sect refused to deal with it. I had a fair fight with him and won, and was stopped by the skill-imparting elder. I sounded the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum for this and in the end, I still can’t get a fair result! Pray tell, Sect Master, what does such a sect have for me to stay on?”

Ye Yuan spoke righteously, rendering the sect master speechless.

The woodcutter saw that the sect master’s expression became uglier and uglier. He could not resist to reprimand Ye Yuan and said, “Ye Yuan, don’t talk nonsense! Lord Sect Master is also thinking of the sect’s long-term future!”

Ye Yuan said, being neither obsequiously nor haughtily, “Elder’s life-saving grace, Ye Yuan will never forget it. But this Ye touches his own heart and feel that this Ye’s contributions to the sect far exceed Qian Ye’s. I only ask for the sect to give a chance to be treated fairly! Ye Yuan knows that the words of the lowly carry little weight. If Sect Master doesn’t allow it, you can very well kill this Ye!”

The nine great elders were all dumbfounded listening to Ye Yuan’s words.

This kid was also too lawless!

The sect master’s expression became increasingly uglier and he said in a cold voice, “Do you think that your talent is exceptional and this sect master doesn’t dare to kill you?”

Ye Yuan did not speak and met the sect master’s gaze, not backing down in the slightest.

Clearly, he expressed his standpoint.

The sect master gritted his teeth and said, “Good, very good! My Shadowmoon Sect really produced a disciple with backbone! This sect master wants to see how tough your bones are!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s entire person seemed to have fallen into an ice-cellar. A horrifying pressure descended upon his body, making him unable to even breathe.

However, Ye Yuan stood firm, clenched his jaws tight, eyes staring firmly at the sect master.

Feeling Ye Yuan’s gaze, the sect master became even angrier.

He was just about to increase the power when suddenly, darkness descended. The sect master’s horrifying pressure seemed to have fallen into darkness.

Ye Yuan felt the pressure on his body lighten, his entire person seemingly hauled out of the water.

The sect master’s expression changed, and he exclaimed, “M-Martial Uncle!”

A cold snort came out of the void and said, “Zhou Qing, you, this sect master, is really declining with each passing day! Are you trying to disrespect your forefathers?”

The sect master’s face changed and he hurriedly clasped his hands and said, “Zhou Qing dare not!”

“Humph! You even dare to defy the ancestor’s ancestral instructions, what do you still not dare to do?” Another cold snort came out of the void, clearly very displeased with Zhou Qing’s way of doing things.

Zhou Qing’s expression was incomparably ugly. He did not think that this matter actually startled Martial Uncle.

His elderly self was the Shadowmoon Sect’s last trump card. Normally, he stayed in closed-seclusion and did not come out, and had never asked about the sect’s matters.

This time, for Ye Yuan’s sake, he actually acted!

The nine great skill-imparting elders exchanged glances. They did not know that there was actually still such an existence in the sect.

Zhou Qing was deeply aware of this martial uncle’s terrifyingness and naturally did not dare to defy. He could only explain himself, “Zhou Qing is ... is also looking out for the sect!”

A cold laugh came out of the void and said, “Zhou Qing, you’re really declining with each passing day! You think about yourself back then. How many geniuses’ corpses did you step on to walk over? The sect’s supreme powerhouse, the sect only needs one and that’s enough! A genius who can sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, you actually wanted to murder him for your face? Are you mad?”

Zhou Qing’s expression changed again and again. Finally, he lowered his head and said respectfully, “Yes, Martial Uncle, Zhou Qing knows that I was wrong! Zhou Qing knows what should be done!”

“Although this old man doesn’t ask about worldly affairs, I also know a thing or two about the sect’s matters. Originally, struggles between factions is a good thing. But now, the sect from top to bottom has already been befouled with a foul atmosphere by the struggle of factions. And you actually even gave the green light for it! Zhou Qing, all ... the best to you!”

Done talking, there was no more sound in the void.
