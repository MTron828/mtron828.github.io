Chapter 1724 Borrowing Power

“What? That Fifth Firmament Divine Lord? Purple destiny?”

“What a joke! His destiny is actually even higher than Jiang Nan’s and Mo Fei’s?”

“Oh please, do you think that the pavilion lord will crack this sort of joke with you?”

...

Everyone was stunned!

No one could have thought that Ning Tianping was actually the person with the most exuberant destiny among these people. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Whether or not one’s destiny was exuberant, strength occupied a very large proportion.

Under normal circumstances, the stronger one’s strength among peers, the more exuberant the destiny.

But this was not absolute. Everyone knew this.

It was just that, Ning Tianping was seriously too ordinary!

Even though his strength was also pretty good, compared to Jiang Nan and Mo Fei, it was far too lacking.

So everyone was not willing to believe no matter what that he was the person with the strongest destiny among these eight people.

Jiang Nan and Mo Fei also looked at Ning Tianping in surprise, their eyes carrying a hint of unwillingness.

“M-Me? Purple destiny?”

Ning Tianping pointed at himself with a look of disbelief.

Seven years ago, Jian Zhentao had once viewed his aura before. At that time, he was still just blue destiny.

Who knew that seven years passed, he actually already evolved into purple destiny!

Staying in Extreme Light Imperial City for so many years, Ning Tianping more or less had some understanding of destiny too.

He reckoned that before he followed His Excellency, his destiny was at most just yellow destiny.

These several hundred years went by, he actually already transformed into purple destiny!

Purple destiny, which was also called purple extreme aura, was the most thriving existence among normal people’s destiny.

People who possessed purple extreme aura had a very high possibility of reaching the True God Realm!

At an imperial city this level, this was extremely rare.

Because of the inheritances of imperial cities, the vast majority were all Celestial Deity legacies. Rarely did True God legacies exist.

Even if there were, wanting to truly reach the True God Realm was also as hard as ascending to heaven.

Hence, everyone’s shock could be imagined.

The Hundred Battles Arena had been hosted for at least several hundred seasons already. But up till now, purple extreme aura genius martial artists that appeared could be counted on one hand!

It could be seen from this how rare purple extreme aura was.

But he actually possessed purple extreme aura now. This was all His Excellency’s credit!

Several hundred years’ time, from the most, most ordinary yellow destiny, transforming into the seldom-seen purple extreme aura, this was absolutely a carp leaping over the dragon gate!

“Huhu, little fellow, could it be that you don’t believe this old man’s words?” Jian Hongxiao said with an amiable smile.

“No, no, no, how can this kid dare to doubt Pavilion Lord’s words? This kid just ... just feels a little like I can’t believe it. After all, this kid only originated from the most remote and low-order imperial city. Purple extreme aura, that’s what I didn’t even dare to think about in the past!” Ning Tianping said somewhat incoherently.

However, these words were akin to a bolt out of the blue in other people’s ears.

“What? His ... His background is actually a low-order imperial city!”

“Are you kidding? A low-order imperial city can actually produce a purple extreme aura?”

“This guy is bent on coming to beat people down, right? I f*cking only want to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into right now!”

...

These geniuses were virtually about to break down when they heard Ning Tianping’s words.

In low-order imperial cities, Celestial Deity Realms were merely three or five. Their legacies were also pitifully weak, resources were also very scarce.

How could this kind of place possibly produce a purple extreme aura?

Picked up a True God legacy?

If this kind of thing was so easy, there would not be so many people with no accomplishment to their name.

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “A person’s destiny is not static. For you to be able to have your present destiny, it’s naturally being tainted by the aura of your benefactor. As the saying goes: when one man attains Dao, his fowls and dogs ascend to heaven too. It’s this logic.”

Ning Tianping’s heart became clear. He naturally knew who his benefactor was. Looking over toward Ye Yuan with a grateful look, he said, “Your Excellency, d-did you heard that? I ... I’m actually purple extreme aura now!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not bad, not bad! Your efforts over these few years finally paid off!”

Regardless of whether the other final six on the stage or the audience on the grandstand, they did not know much about Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping’s relationship.

Hearing Ning Tianping called Ye Yuan ‘Your Excellency’ at this time, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with amazement.

Only then did they abruptly startle awake. There was still Ye Yuan!

A purple aura, two blue auras, then what was Ye Yuan?

Previously, everyone was still wondering why Ye Yuan who got the first place was not as high as Jiang Nan, or even Ning Tianping?

It was also not weird that they thought so. After all, imperial aura this kind of existence had never appeared in history before.

As for the emperor surmounting aura, that went even more without saying.

They did not even dare to think about it!

And now, this purple extreme aura actually called Ye Yuan ‘Your Excellency’, then that meant that he was just a follower of Ye Yuan!

In addition to what Pavilion Lord said just now, Ning Tianping was tainted by the aura of a benefactor.

Then how horrifying was Ye Yuan’s destiny?

Jian Hongxiao did not let them wonder for too long, he smiled and said, “Huhu, everyone guessed correctly! The first thing that this old man is going to announce is that the first imperial aura finally appeared at the Hundred Battles Arena! He is Ye Yuan! Furthermore, his destiny is extremely flourishing, a pinnacle existence!”

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples!

The grandstand immediately burst into an uproar.

“Imperial aura! It’s actually the legendary imperial aura! No wonder ... No wonder he can overpower Jiang Nan!”

“My God, really can see everything if you live long! This old man actually saw an imperial aura in this lifetime!”

“F*ck me! I really want to be friends with me! No, wait, being a follower works! Let me be tainted with his immortal qi too!”

“Lord Ye Yuan, are you lacking a bed-warming maid or not? I’m willing!”

“Hahaha!”

...

Jian Hongxiao did not say emperor surmounting aura because that was too astonishing.

But imperial aura was already sufficiently astounding!

On the grandstands, no one was envious of Ye Yuan’s imperial aura at all.

They were all envious of Ning Tianping!

Holy shit, a puny little genius from a low-order imperial city made a meteoric rise after following Ye Yuan, rushing to purple extreme aura all at once.

Could this kind of destiny be a little more heaven-defying?

Seeing Ning Tianping, they all understood a logic: following Ye Yuan one would have meat to eat!

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Hongxiao with a helpless look, but Jian Hongxiao also cast a slightly apologetic gaze.

Ye Yuan naturally understood that Jian Hongxiao was borrowing his destiny to promote Extreme Light Imperial City’s name.

The Hundred Battles Arena producing an imperial aura, once this news spread out, it would immediately cause a sensation.

This was naturally a good thing to Extreme Light Imperial City.

According to Ye Yuan’s idea, it was naturally the more low-profile, the better.

But that person was Jian Hongxiao, so what could he do?

Want to borrow power and influence, borrow it then.

You’re awesome, you have the final say!

Who asked us to have to ask you for help?

Jian Hongxiao did a hand gesture, indicating for everyone to be quiet.

Only after seeing everyone quieten down did Jian Hongxiao slowly say, “Such a joyous occasion is naturally worth this old man taking a trip out. Uh, this second matter ... it is that the next season’s Hundred Battles Arena will be postponed till after 1000 years.”
