Chapter 1650 Astronomical Figure

The entire city was in a stir!

Inside the Heavenly Spiritual Pill, a small medicinal pills shop that only sold void spirit divine pills actually appeared.

This matter was akin to the wind, spreading throughout the entire capital city at an extremely fast speed.

In front of Ye Yuan’s Medicinal Pill Shop, a long line already formed, with no end in sight.

Among the people queuing, Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were in the majority.

Although the medicinal pills were good, not many of those Origin Deity Realm itinerant cultivators were able to afford the price of hundreds of millions of divine essence stones.

Even the most ordinary medicinal pill, it was very hard for them to afford to buy one.

At the back row of the line, someone complained, saying, “Such a long line, how long do we have to queue until?!”

Another person said, “Then what can you do? That master said those who simply cut the queue won’t be sold medicinal pills! Heavenly Network Gathering was jointly established by the three great factions, so do you dare to cause trouble?”

“But such a long queue, no matter how many void spirit divine pills that master has, it will be sold out too!”

“I heard that if there’s Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones, they can have priority in exchanging for medicinal pills. But sadly, I don’t have any. Sigh!”

...

Right now, the popularity of Medicinal Pill Shop was so explosive. Ye Yuan also released a statement, saying that anyone who had Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones could have the priority in purchasing void spirit divine pills.

In a short half a day, he collected three pieces of Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones.

Of course, he also traded several more expensive medicinal pills out.

In this half a day’s time, Ye Yuan already sold hundreds of medicinal pills. His pockets started to bulge again.

In a short half a day’s time, he made more than ten billion.

Deducting away the cost of these medicinal pills, Ye Yuan also made a net profit of seven to eight billion.

The medicinal pills that Ye Yuan sold currently, low difficulty ones were in the majority.

Not everyone could take out one or two billion divine essence stones to purchase those extremely difficult medicinal pills.

“Alright, let’s stop here today. Pack up the stall! Those who need medicinal pills, please be early tomorrow.”

The sky was getting dark, Ye Yuan directly gave the order to chase away the customers.

With this, everyone exploded.

“Don’t! Finally managed to reach the end of the queue, why did you pack up the stall?”

“Are you kidding? Who does business like you?”

“Hey, kid! Your father queued for half a day, now, you’re telling me closing up the stall? If you dare to go, I will exterminate you!”

Ye Yuan gave that first-layered heaven Divine Lord a glance coldly and said coolly, “Very good, I’ve remembered you. You can forget about buying a single medicinal pill from my place. Even if you have money, it won’t work either!”

That first-layered heaven Divine Lord obviously had a short fuse as he said angrily, “Fine, you have balls! If you have the capabilities, don’t go out of the Heavenly Network Gathering! Otherwise, this father of yours will break your legs!”

Suddenly, a powerful aura locked onto him and said coldly, “Why? You want to make a move against Brother Ye?”

That first-layered heaven Divine Lord’s back turned cold, his expression instantly becoming incomparably ugly.

This aura was clearly released by a third-layered heaven Divine Lord. Who was it if not Ning Tianping?

“I ... h-haha, just kidding, was kidding around just now. How can I dare to offend Master?”

Yielded in one second!

That first-layered heaven Divine Lord even thought that Ye Yuan was alone. Who knew that there was actually still a third-layered heaven Divine Lord backing Ye Yuan from behind?

“Good that you don’t dare. Otherwise ... you won’t see tomorrow’s sun! Humph!” Ning Tianping said with a cold snort.

The person sweated profusely and repeatedly said that he did not dare, and he was scared away frightened out of his wits.

Ning Tianping came to Ye Yuan’s side, passed him a storage ring, and said, “Brother Ye, the medicinal herbs that you want, I’ve bought them!”

Ye Yuan gave Ning Tianping a very long list. Ning Tianping ran for a whole day, virtually running all over the whole city, before buying all of these spirit medicines.

He had not returned yet and already knew that a medicinal pill big shot appeared in the city, causing a sensation in the entire city. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Returning to take a look, this was a spectacle to behold!

In the past, His Excellency had never worried about money before. This time, pressing him into a corner, the momentum released was really tremendous!

Ye Yuan received the spirit medicines and said with a nod, “Thank you for your effort. Let’s find a place to rest first. Tomorrow, we’ll come over to set up the stall again.”

Ye Yuan brought Ning Tianping and left, leaving behind everyone looking at each other.

Left just like this?

What the hell?!

To martial artists, forget about one day, even not resting for a year was also nothing.

Therefore, the Heavenly Network Gathering actually operated 24 hours a day.

Although the people at night were fewer, the number of people was still a lot.

The booth fees were already paid, so how could one still find a place to rest?

Wasn’t this wasting divine essence stones?

Uh ... hang on, the rental fee for last-rank stalls seemed to be just 100 thousand divine essence stones a day. It was not even enough for the change for one of Master’s medicinal pills.

“Uh, all scatter then! Tomorrow, come and queue up early!”

“Seriously, have money and he doesn’t even want to earn!”

“Heh heh, what the hell do you know?! Void spirit divine pills don’t need to worry about selling at all. Even if he sells for two hours a day, you’ll also have to wait respectfully!”

...

Everyone rose in tumult and dispersed. Following Ye Yuan’s departure, the Heavenly Network Gathering returned to its original appearance.

On the way, Ning Tianping asked impatiently, “Heh, Your Excellency, how was today’s gains?”

Ye Yuan mused for a bit and said, “Roughly calculating, there’s roughly 17 or 18 billion.”

Ning Tianping opened his mouth wide and said with a look of disbelief, “So ... So fast? Your Excellency, you’re really too crazy! You setting up a stall for a day already catches up to my Ning Family’s one year of income!”

Although Ning Tianping was long mentally prepared, he was still taken aback with fright by the figure Ye Yuan said.

One had to know, the Ning Family, this kind of imperial city’s major family, their one year’s net profit was also merely 20 over billion.

But Ye Yuan set up a stall here for less than a day and earned the family’s annual income. This was also too crazy.

He knew that Ye Yuan rented the stall for ten days. After these ten days, wouldn’t it be 200 billion divine essence stones?

200 billion ...

This was simply an astronomical figure!

The more Ning Tianping thought, the more shocked he got. He never knew that earning money turned out to be so easy.

His Excellency was simply a money-making machine!

Ye Yuan seemed to know what he was thinking and said with a smile, “What are you thinking? These medicinal pills were all accumulated by me over several hundred years. Only selling them at one time will have this kind of effect. If really let me refine them, then even if I continuously refine pills day and night, it’s also impossible to have this kind of money-making speed!”

Ning Tianping smacked his lips and said, “That’s also very impressive already! It’s also only Your Excellency that can accomplish this kind of thing. If it were others, under this kind of situation, there is nothing apart from despair!”

The two people walked and just walked out of the Heavenly Network Gathering when three groups of people came over from three different directions.

The one in the lead was actually a sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse!

No need to ask, these three teams were definitely sent by the three major forces.

The sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord on the right-hand side said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “Little Brother Ye Yuan, our alliance chief invites you to the manor for a chat, please honor with a visit!”

Behind him was Zhao Jian. Su Ting’s figure was nowhere to be seen. Clearly, she went into a retreat already.

That sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord in the middle glared at Du Mingliang and said, “Du Mingliang, you dare to snatch people from our City Lord Manor?”

At this time, that sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord on the left also opened his mouth and said, “Little Brother Ye Yuan, our Blood Rainbow Manor sincerely invites you to our manor for a chat!”
