Chapter 3067: The Show is Just Starting!

“Congratulations! Congratulations! Fellow Daoist Kong Tan attained Dao overnight! In the future, we can only look up to you!”

Hegemon Yun Shang came forward and clasped his hands at Kong Tan.

There was an uproar!

Hegemon Yun Shang this kind of Supreme Hegemon, actually took the initiative to build friendly relations with Kong Tan!“Please reading on

Not just him, many Peak Hegemons and Supreme Hegemons all went up and congratulated Kong Tan.

Meanwhile Kong Tan replied to them one by one.

All the glory gathering onto one entity; this was how it was!

He obtained the recognition of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings and became the son of destiny.

Very soon, he shall even obtain all of Hegemon Heavenless’ inheritance. His future accomplishments would be immeasurable.

In fact, he might even become the second Hegemon Heavenless!

With this kind of future, no one dared to ignore him.

Building a relationship at this time was naturally no big deal.

At this very moment, there was already nobody who had doubts about Heavenless’ motives.

......

Even the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings were released. The powerhouses from all heavens made tremendous progress in these 18 years.

Everyone could not think why someone who had ulterior motives would go through so much effort to improve everyone’s strength.

Therefore, everyone thought that Heavenless had long already fallen.

Opening the Labyrinth Divine Palace was just to look for a successor.

“Humph!?These 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings are really blind, to actually choose that kid! In terms of talent, you’re much stronger than him!” A Nirvanic Soul Clan Hegemon said unhappily.

He felt unjust for Cloudneon!

Cloudneon’s talent was clearerly stronger than Kong Tan’s. In the end, the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings actually picked Kong Tan!

Was this comparing advancing realms?

Cloudneon was indifferent and said coolly, “Lucky chances, it’s naturally obtained by those who are fated. These 12 Hegemon Paintings naturally have their own rules. It can’t be forced. Moreover, it’s already very remarkable that I could break through to Supreme Hegemon. This kind of lucky chance isn’t what anyone can have.”

The Nirvanic Soul Clan Hegemon nodded and said, “Yeah, this way, our Nirvanic Soul Clan will have two great Supreme Hegemons! If Hegemon Samsara doesn’t come out, we can sufficiently crush the Qi Soul Clan!”

Kong Tan’s gaze also glanced towards this time, very unhappy.

This soul race actually dared to not come and congratulate!

The winner becomes king and the loser an outlaw!

Since the soul race lost, then they had to bow their heads in submission.

This bunch of guys was actually so haughty!

After this seat achieves Great Beyond, I’ll definitely teach you all a lesson!

Also, Ye Yuan and Yang Qing, heh heh, weren’t you guys showing off earlier?

Very soon, this seat will bring the fiend race army and trample Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

Presently, he was really looking forward to Ancestor Heavenless’ inheritance.

This kind of heaven-shocking major figure, if one could inherit all of his mantle, what a wonderful thing that would be!

Suddenly, he glimpsed the Ye Yuan and Yang Qing in the crowd, and he immediately grinned.

“The two of you, come over!” Kong Tan pointed at Ye Yuan and said with a tone that allowed no questioning. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Want to posture? Come yourself!”

Kong Tan’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, the winner becomes king. No matter how breathtaking your and Yang Qing’s performances were previously, it can’t change the reality of being losers too! You dare to be disrespectful to this seat. This… is courting death!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Is that so? Congratulations to you then.”

Very insincere!

It looked more like sarcasm!

The powerhouses present all shook their heads, secretly sighing at Ye Yuan’s unwise move.

Regarding Kong Tan finding Ye Yuan, everyone knew that he was posturing, to regain face from before.

Although Kong Tan’s performance had always been stunning, how could such a genius be willing to submit to others?

Forget about Kong Tan. If it were Yu Ran, Qin Baichuan, and the rest, if they attained Dao overnight, they would definitely regain face too.

Ye Yuan was not even willing to lower his head at this time.

Got to admit, he was courting death!

Kong Tan had already obtained the recognition of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings. He would obtain Ancestor Heavenless’ inheritance very soon.

Even if Ye Yuan was hiding inside the ‘Heaven’ formation, it was useless too!

“I thought that two dark horses were going to emerge this time. Didn’t expect that they were so useless!”

“Yeah, other people’s strength all advanced by leaps and bounds. They practically did not improve much.”

“Forget about dropping the ball at the critical moment; but to actually not even recognize how capable they are, this is courting death!”

… …

Visualizing the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings this time, virtually everyone’s strength soared.

Ye Yuan and Yang Qing two people appeared somewhat glaring to the eyes.

Therefore, they naturally became idiots in other people’s eyes.

However, the two of them clearly did not have this self-awareness.

Kong Tan’s face became black as the bottom of a pot. Only to see him snort coldly and casually thrust a palm out.

The strength of a Hegemon Realm erupted fully!

During these 18 years, Kong Tan’s strength improved greatly.

The power of this palm was absolutely not beneath Peak Hegemons!

He had the intention of using Ye Yuan and Yang Qing to establish awe.

Some people shook their heads. Some were disdainful. Some gloated over others’ misfortune.

All in all, they all thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

However, a beautiful figure suddenly appeared in front of Ye Yuan. Only to wave her hand casually, that powerful palm of Kong Tan’s directly dissipated with the wind.

It was Cloudneon!

But on the other side, Feng Qingxuan secretly stomped her feet.

“Damn it. This woman beat me to it!”

When in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, Feng Qingxuan already knew about Cloudneon. Furthermore, Ye Yuan was very close to her.

Therefore, she naturally felt a sense of urgency.

Furthermore, Cloudneon’s talent was even greater than hers. This time, she actually broke through to Supreme Hegemon!

Kong Tan’s expression turned cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “Why? Does your soul race want to become enemies with this seat? You should understand what kind of existence you’re facing!”

Cloudneon said coolly, “You can think whatever you want. But you can’t kill him!”

Kong Tan’s face turned black. How embarrassing!

This woman was courting death!

He snorted coldly and said, “Very good, this seat has remembered it! On the day this seat breaks through to Great Beyond, it will be when your Nirvanic Soul Clan bears this seat’s wrath! All the best to you!”

He could not bear the sight of Cloudneon and Ye Yuan.

Since he could not bear looking at them, they could die!

Suddenly, a figure condensed and formed above the void. It was precisely Heavenless!

“Ancestor Heavenless has appeared!”

“He’s going to impart his skill! Sigh, really envy Kong Tan!”

“I wonder what Ancestor Heavenless’ inheritance is like!”

… …

When Ancestor Heavenless showed himself, everyone was very excited.

This was the moment that everyone looked forward to, although it had nothing to do with them.

But witnessing this moment was also pretty good!

Kong Tan’s face went from being overcast to bright, changing to a smiling face as he went to greet.

Cloudneon arrived next to Ye Yuan and said coolly, “You don’t seem worried at all?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Didn’t you take action? What am I worried about?”

Cloudneon said, “You know that I’m not referring to this.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The show is just starting!”

Cloudneon’s brows furrowed, clearly not understanding what Ye Yuan was referring to.

In her view, the overall situation had already been decided.

As for Kong Tan’s revenge, she did not care.

The Dao enlightenment this time, she had benefited greatly from it.

Maybe when Kong Tan became a Great Beyond powerhouse, she would be able to step into Great Beyond too.

The Cloud Dream Soul Physique was no joke!

Except, why did Ye Yuan say that the show was just starting?

“Oh, right, haven’t congratulated you for becoming Supreme Hegemon!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Cloudneon still remained indifferent whether granted favors or was subjected to humiliation. She said nonchalantly, “There’s nothing to congratulate. When conditions are ripe, success will follow.”
