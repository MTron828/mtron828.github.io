Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ironcore, don’t talk nonsense with him anymore! Do it!” Min Nanshan said in a solemn voice.

No idea why; Ye Yuan was clearly all alone right now, but he was very uneasy in his heart.

Ironcore had clearly sensed this uneasiness too; his expression turned dark as he said,?“Humph!?Even if Ji Chun betrayed me, you’ll find it hard to escape death today too! Go to hell!”

At virtually the same time, eight great Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses attacked at the same time.

The commotion was shocking to the extreme.

However, Ye Yuan did not show the slightest fear under the besiegement of eight great Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses.

He took out a small and exquisite conch and recited a spell.

Right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

A water curtain suddenly descended, directly enveloping Ye Yuan inside.

More than a dozen figures actually appeared out of thin air!

Each and every one of these people had odd forms. They were clearly sea creatures.

True spirit sea race!

These dozen over powerhouses were actually all Jade Sovereign Heavens too!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A series of intense tremors rippled in the void.The attacks of the eight great Jade Sovereign Heavens were actually disrupted in an instant.

“Hehe,?it’s so fun! Big Brother Ye Yuan, thank you for bringing me out to play!”

A crisp and tender voice sounded out, who could it be if not Little Dragon Girl Jingfei?

The small conch in Ye Yuan’s hands was given to him before Little Dragon Girl left.

This little conch was the derivative body of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch and was used to transmit information.

Of course, it could be used to teleport in Ye Yuan’s hands too!

Just now, Ye Yuan activated the small conch and directly teleported the Emerald Sea Divine Conch over.

While Little Dragon Girl used the Emerald Sea Divine Conch to bring these people and teleported over together.

Ye Yuan’s face turned black, and he said unhappily, “Somebody wants to kill me right now. But you actually think that it’s fun!”

Little Dragon Girl smiled and said, “Of course! You take a look at the expressions on their faces. It’s really fun to the max!”

Shock and horror were written all over the faces of the eight great Jade Sovereign Heavens.

Jade Sovereign Heavens powerhouses were able to fly, but they could not shuttle through the void.

This kind of instant teleportation means was simply unimaginable.

But Ye Yuan actually summoned so many Jade Sovereign Heaven seafolk in an instant. So how could they not be surprised?

“Ye Yuan, you actually dare to collude with the sea race and have evil designs on our Heavenly South!” Ironcore’s expression changed wildly and he asked.

Ye Yuan looked at him like looking at a fool as he smiled and said, “Did you turn stupid from being the city lord? If I had evil designs on Heavenly South, wouldn’t I just not need to do anything when the sea race invaded back then? Did I have to make it so troublesome like now? Are you not aware of what I’ve done in this one year? Me increasing Heavenly South alchemy path’s strength, what benefits are there to the sea race?”

Ironcore gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Who knows what the hell you’re thinking?”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said nonchalantly, “Looks like there’s nothing to discuss with a fool like you.”

Ironcore sneered and said, “Even if there’s the sea race helping you, what can you do to me? This city lord is a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. They can’t keep me behind! However, with this incident today, this city lord wants to see how you’ll continue staying on in Heavenly South City!”

Grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven, this was virtually Rainclear Continent’s apex strength already.

In ordinary battles, wanting to kill grand completion Jade Sovereign Heavens was seriously too difficult.

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a faint smile, “Want to leave? I’m afraid that it won’t be easy! Did you forget? When Little Dragon Girl and I joined forces, our strength was even stronger than you, this grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven!”

Back then, when Ye Yuan joined forces with Little Dragon Girl, they beat Ironcore until he knelt down and begged for mercy by relying on the power of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

This scene left a huge shadow in Ironcore’s heart.

At present, Ye Yuan and Little Dragon Girl joining as one again. It would be equivalent to a powerhouse who surpassed grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven appeared once more.

How could he, Ironcore, not be alarmed?

“Retreat!”

Ironcore bellowed loudly, his figure turning into an afterimage and flew into the distance.

“Hehe,?only thinking of running now! It’s too late! Watersource Canopy!”

Just as Ironcore acted, Little Dragon Girl moved too!

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch suddenly activated. An enormous cubic water curtain covered the entire sky.

In an instant, everyone was enveloped inside.

Ironcore’s figure had just moved but felt like he had fallen into a quagmire, his speed unable to pick up at all.

But, as soon as this water curtain descended, those sea race powerhouses seemed to have been injected with stimulants, becoming even more excited.

Sure enough, they were much more comfortable in the water!

“Big Brother, my power alone isn’t enough to trap them! Come and help me!” Little Dragon Girl shouted.

Ye Yuan had long prepared, directly pressing a palm on the back of Little Dragon Girl.

The berserk true dragon power rushed in. The range of the Watersource Canopy directly doubled!

But the resistance felt by Ironcore and his group increased several times!

This Watersource Canopy was equivalent to a giant cage.

Furthermore, it enhanced the seafolk’s condition to 120% but weakened the conditions of Heavenly South powerhouses.

Increasing one’s strength and reducing the opponent’s strength.

This was simply a huge trump card!

Seeing this kind of power, even Ye Yuan could not resist marveling too. This Emerald Sea Divine Conch had endless wonders.

While on the sea race powerhouses this side, they were incomparably shocked too.

Among the sea race powerhouses, Ye Yuan was very familiar with one of them. It was precisely that moronic black shark general.

The black shark exclaimed,?“Tsk tsk,?I really didn’t expect that you, a human, actually possess a true dragon power several times stronger than that of the princess, simply unimaginable!”

He did not exclaim with amazement because of this Watersource Canopy but exclaimed for Ye Yuan’s true dragon power.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was even lower than Little Dragon Girl’s. In the end, the moment he inputted his true dragon power, the canopy suddenly doubled in size.

They had never seen before such a vigorous true dragon power.

“You moron, stop talking rubbish already. Why haven’t you quickly made a move?” Ye Yuan said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan did not have a good impression of this idiot.

“You!” The black shark glared and was about to fly off the handle.

“My goodness, Uncle Black Shark, my strength is limited and can’t hold on for too long. Why don’t you hurry up?”

The moment Little Dragon Girl spoke up, the black shark immediately reined back his temper.

The moment the black shark made his move, it was immediately earth-shattering!

In this water curtain, with the augmentation of true dragon power, he seemed to have returned to his mother’s womb.

That sort of power was simply endless.

Numbers, strength, both parties were not on the same level at all.

The battle also progressed extremely smoothly.

After several exchanges, Ironcore’s side was beaten until they did not have the slightest strength to fight back.

“Ye Yuan, we’re all humans! Do you really want to exterminate everyone?” In the water curtain, came Min Nanshan’s desperate yell.

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Know that we’re of the same species now? If I didn’t have a backup plan, would you guys show mercy to me today? What’s the point of saying these on your deathbed? Moron, don’t need to show mercy, kill!”

“Heh heh,?alright!”

The black shark moron was excited from killing and did not haggle over Ye Yuan’s term of address either.

The sea race was warlike to begin with. The shark clan was even warriors among warriors.

Killing Heavenly South’s Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses was incomparably delightful to him.

Under the joined forces of more than a dozen people, the Heavenly South’s side had little strength to fight back, Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In less than an hour, the Heavenly South side’s powerhouses only had the Ironcore and Min Nanshan who were lingering on with their last breath of life remaining..
