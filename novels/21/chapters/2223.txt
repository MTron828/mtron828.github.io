Chapter 2227: Samsara?

In front of the lone grave, the youth in white clothing sat on the ground. He leaned against a large tree. Holding a wine gourd in his hand, he drank the wine inside.

His expression appeared somewhat lonely.

Inside the pale-white flames, a wisp of remnant soul shouted himself hoarse, appearing extremely terrified.

“Ye Yuan, I was wrong! I beg you, don’t kill me! As long as you spare my life, I will work like a horse for you in the future ...”

“Noisy!” Ye Yuan’s snapped his fingers. The power of the flames soared once more.

Jiu Shang screamed miserably without ceasing, his fiend soul becoming even weaker.

This lone grave was erected for Ji Zhengyang by Ye Yuan back then, on the former site of the Medicine King Hall.

Ye Yuan drank a mouthful of wine and said to the gravestone, “It’s been 2000 over years, Father, your deep hatred has finally been avenged. This karma ... is finally settled! Refining Jiu Shang’s remnant soul requires seven by seven, 49 days. This child will keep watch over you here for 49 days.”

Ye Yuan drank another mouthful, the corners of his mouth smiling as he said, “Still remember that back then, when I was six, you taught me pill refinement for the first time. I refined it into a ball of paste. You clapped your hands and laughed loudly, praising that my talent surpasses others.”

“You told me to not be arrogant and not be rash, so I devoted himself to comprehending Dao for 200 years, and rose to prominence overnight in Cloudmarsh City!”

“... ...”

It was like he was drinking with an old friend while engaging in small talk.

As he chatted, Ye Yuan’s tears already drenched his shirt.

A father’s love for his son; for more than 500 years, Ji Zhengyang gave the most noble fatherly love in this world to Ye Yuan.

For Ye Yuan to be able to have today’s accomplishments, Ji Zhengyang took immense credit.

Ye Yuan naturally did not know that Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s appraisal behind his back were these rare and commendable qualities in him.

Apart from experiencing huge changes, there was still a huge portion that originated from his father, Ji Zhengyang.

One could say that Ji Zhengyang was the beacon light of Ye Yuan’s path in life.

Even after reincarnating, before Ji Zhengyang’s remnant soul dissipated, he still taught Ye Yuan one final lesson.

Seven by seven, 49 days were about to pass in a twinkle, Ye Yuan poured some wine. Then he discovered that the wine gourd was already dry.

Wine drying up, the tears also dried along with the wind.

Ye Yuan slowly got up, looked at the gravestone, and said, “Originally I wanted to accompany Father a few more days. It’s just that presently, Lingxue’s life and death is unknown, while Li-er is trapped in the abyss. The Heavenspan World is about to fall into an upheaval. This child has no choice but to go! After everything settles down, this child will come and accompany Father again.”

At this time, Jiu Shang’s final wisp of remnant soul was also thoroughly refined.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang completely dissipated into heaven and earth.

Watching Jiu Shang evaporate into thin air, a hint of relief flashed across in Ye Yuan’s heart.

His thoughts were incomparably smooth and actually entered a state of emptiness.

The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain flew out of his body involuntarily and arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan viewed it and actually produced a feeling of a trace of bloodline connection.

When looking at the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain again, the scenery before Ye Yuan’s eyes was already completely different.

This Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was an assemblage of colors, but constructed and formed out of tiny pieces of cubes.

These little cubes divulged incomparably complicated and detailed information, making Ye Yuan unable to grasp it too.

“This is ... the aura of the Great Dao source? Yeah, the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain is incomparably profound and capable of letting me comprehend the Chaos Heavenspan Canon, this kind of cultivation method. It’s naturally closely linked with the Great Dao source! I just don’t know what relationship this Lesser Heavenspan Mountain has with that Heavenspan Mountain.”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows jumped slightly. A wisp of green smoke suddenly emerged above Ji Zhengyang’s gravestone.

It flashed across in a twinkle!

Ye Yuan’s heart jumped wildly and was incomparably shocked.

“This ... This is ... Father’s remnant soul has already completely dissipated! How can there possibly still be divine soul undulations? That ... is also ... the aura of source?” Ye Yuan was shocked until he could not express it with words.

Back then in the Endless World, he watched his father’s remnant soul dissipate into thin air with his own eyes.

But now, what was with the divine soul undulation on the gravestone?

“Remnant soul ... Karma ... Source ... Could it be ... samsara?”

Ye Yuan’s mind flashed like lightning, instantly thinking of many things.

Father’s soul did not disintegrate but was a remnant soul dissipating.

Once Jiu Shang died, all of Father’s karma in this world was settled.

Hence, Father turned into a trace of source and went to reincarnate?

But ... was there really a venue for reincarnation in this world?

Why was it never heard of?

Where did one go to reincarnate?

This world always had legends about reincarnation.

But it had never been heard of that anyone really reincarnated.

A person dying was like the lamp extinguishing, all thoughts becoming ashes!

Dying was dying.

Even for those Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, no one had heard before of someone who reincarnated and ascended the summit again too.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, looking toward the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

Following that, his gaze seemed to pass through the void again, looking at the Heavenspan World, the Heavenspan Mountain.

“Just what’s there on the Heavenspan Mountain? Even Dao Ancestors can’t climb to the summit. Can I ... go up? Father ... wouldn’t really have entered samsara?”

Ye Yuan muttered under his breath and suddenly felt an extremely strong impulse toward the Heavenspan Mountain.

No idea how long passed either, Ye Yuan’s gaze suddenly turned intent and he said, “Father, if there’s really samsara in this world, this child will definitely find you and let you recover your memories! What you and Mother went through in this lifetime is far too painful! I’ll definitely think of a way to make it up to you!”

Ye Yuan re-living another life, even though Father Ye Hang and Mother Ren Hongling had some gray days, they loved each other for life.

Presently, under Ye Yuan’s protection, reaching old age together, even living forever, was not something hard.

But, his previous life’s father, Ji Zhengyang, and mother, Ao Jun, experienced far too many bumpy roads and setbacks.

The two people were in the right place, but at the wrong time, and they were unable to be together from the beginning to the end.

Ye Yuan rescued his mother, but he was forever unable to rescue his father. This was the biggest regret in Ye Yuan’s heart.

Maybe he still had a chance to make up for this regret?

Ye Yuan was not sure, but as long as there was a trace of possibility, he would not give up!”

... ...

Bidding farewell to Ye Hang husband and wife, and his other, Ao Jun, Ye Yuan returned to the Heavenspan World once more.

Presently, the Southern Border’s general situation had already settled down. With Bai Tong holding down the fort, he could also leave with his mind at ease.

After the great battle with Nineorigin the last time, not only was Ye Yuan’s chaos world utterly destroyed, his fleshy body debilitated, his divine soul even almost turned to ashes.

If not for Dustless deploying the Soul Suppressing Pearl to protect Ye Yuan at the final juncture, he would not have lost his memories so easily.

After all, Nineorigin was not an enemy that Ye Yuan had encountered in the past.

He was too strong!

His strength was sufficient to rival a human race’s Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor!

What kind of concept was a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor?

Someone like Jiu Shang, he could kill him with a puff of air! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

For Ye Yuan to be able to survive under his hands, it was already a miracle.

But the price was Dustless falling into slumber.

Without Dustless’s support, Mu Lingxue’s spiritual sense became weaker and weaker.

Hence, after suppressing the Southern Border’s upheaval, Ye Yuan had to leave!

He had to go to Shinra Ghost Region, to search for a natural treasure called Silvernet Blood Essence.

Silvernet Blood Essence was immensely helpful for recovering soul bodies and could help Dustless recover.

However, just as Ye Yuan was about to leave, Ning Tianping also came to bid farewell to him.

At present, Ning Tianping already broke through to the Empyrean Realm with the help of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills.

His strength was already suddenly to go and take revenge for his master, Mo Lifei.

Mo Lifei had once said before, his opponent’s strength was merely at the peak True God Realm.

Even if he broke through after so many years, with Ning Tianping’s strength, it was naturally a cinch to deal with him. Ye Yuan naturally had no reason to stop him.

Ye Yuan gave Ning Tianping some medicinal pills and Empyrean spirit treasures to protect himself. This master and servant two people left, going on their own path.
