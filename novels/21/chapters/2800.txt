Ye Yuan did not deliberately suppress this corruption power, but his noble bloodline allowed no provocation.

Chaos bloodline was practically the 33 Heavens’ strongest bloodline.

Not one of!

Carefully feeling this corrupted bloodline power, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed together.

Very complicated!

The corrupt blood mixed together with the ordinary bloodline and already completely fused into one. It could not be purged at all.

Even if Ye Yuan’s control of divine essence already reached a transcendent level, he could not do it too.

This kind of fusion was a unified entity. It could not be differentiated at all.

After Ye Yuan stopped examining, Song Miao smiled and said, “This Song appreciates Younger Brother Ye’s good intentions. However, this Song has a score in mind about this corrupt blood power. It’s likely unable to be removed.”

Ye Yuan did not answer and asked, “Senior, those who got inflicted by the poison of corrupt blood such as yourself shouldn’t be in the minority, right?”

Song Miao nodded and said, “The northern land is relatively peaceful, but the vast majority of the people have participated in battles with the blood race before. This blood corruption poison naturally can’t be avoided.”

Ye Yuan said, “I’ll go take a look.”

Song Miao smiled and did not refuse either, bringing Ye Yuan out.

Geniuses were all haughty. After Ye Yuan became aware of the overwhelming odds against him, everything could naturally be discussed.

This blood corruption poison was not merely studied by grade five, grade six heavenly alchemists. Even grade nine heavenly alchemists had researched it before too.

But it was simply incurable.

Once the corrupt blood fused into the blood, no method could separate it.

Unless the inflicted person died, otherwise, there was no way of separating it at all.

Currently, Northern View City had a Saint Sovereign Heaven army of 2000 stationed here.

‘When Ye Yuan walked into the army camp, his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

The army of 2000 was already left with just 1400 over people. Furthermore, many people were injured.

Many of these injuries were due to blood corruption poison.

Ye Yuan ignored him but said to Song Miao, “Senior, I want to take a look at a few more.”

Saint Sovereign naturally had no objections, bringing Ye Yuan to take a look at a few more Saint Sovereign Heavens inflicted with blood corruption poison.

But Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed even harder.

Zhao Chen was a centurion. With regards to Ye Yuan’s action, he scoffed in derision.

“Brat who hungers for fame and reputation, how ignorant! A country bumpkin who came from overseas, do you really think that Alchemy Dao is so easy?” Zhao Chen said disdainfully to Ye Yuan’s face.

Ye Yuan still paid no attention to him and said to Song Miao, “Senior, there’s a big problem with this method to control the blood corruption poison!”

Song Miao could not help being taken aback when he heard it. It was somewhat exaggerating things to raise an alarm, right?

This method was not figured out by Dao Chen this disciple but devised by his master, an Emperor level powerhouse.

You, a measly little middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, you’re at the very best a grade five heavenly alchemist. Yet, you’re actually questioning a grade seven heavenly alchemist?

However, Ye Yuan had rendered great contributions. Song Miao could not very well refute him either and said, “Oh? What’s the problem?”

He did not understand much about Ye Yuan. Actually, his thoughts were pretty much the same as Zhao Chen’s, feeling that Ye Yuan was somewhat talking big to impress people.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said, “This method of controlling is using the power of true spirit bloodline to suppress the spreading of corrupt blood. But this kind of method has huge hidden danger! The pride of true spirit bloodline is even more so than that of the blood race. Using true spirit bloodline to

suppress corrupt blood will indeed have a bit of effect within a short time. But, once a great battle starts, it’s very easy for true spirit bloodline to lose control, and it will even cause a backlash to the master! At that time, our combat force will be greatly diminished!”

Ye Yuan saw through that this so-called treatment method was using chaos true spirit bloodline to suppress the power of corrupt blood.

This method seemed flawless.

But, once a genuine great battle erupted, it was very easy for Heaven One Continent this side to crumble!

It was just that nobody seemed to be able to take this in!

The moment Song Miao heard, he smiled and said, “Brother Ye is worrying too much! Suppressing corrupt blood with the blood of true spirit, this is the method that the Extreme Medicine Sect devised and has already been verified at the southern front. There’s absolutely no problem.”

Zhao Chen was also impatient, completely disregarding Ye Yuan’s face as he said, “City Lord Song, where did this kid come from? Such high-sounding sentiments! Extreme Medicine Sect is a Hegemon level holy land. Can the things that they figured out be questioned by people? In my view, this boy is

completely haughty from being conferred favors! He wants to render even greater contributions and obtain even greater glory!”

“Huhu, having half-baked knowledge but showing off! Kid, the bloodline suppression method that my Extreme Medicine Sect devised has already been verified at the southern front. There’s absolutely no problem! But now, you’re saying that there’s a problem with our Extreme Medicine Sect’s suppression

method. Who gave you the courage?” Just as they were talking, Dao Chen heard about this from god knows where and swaggered in.

Dao Chen looked toward Ye Yuan, his eyes seemingly full of disdain.

He knew Ye Yuan and knew that Ye Yuan had rendered great contributions.

But, in his eyes, Ye Yuan was merely a foreign hillbilly and had never seen the world before.. How could he grasp bloodline suppression, this kind of high-level treatment method?
