1429 Looking for Trouble

In the great hall, Divine Envoy Azurepeak’s two eyes slowly opened.

“Two hours is up. Looks like ... you guys aren’t planning on handing over the person! Very good! Since that’s the case, this divine envoy will go and invite him personally!”

Azurepeak gave no chance to explain, slowly walking out of the great hall.

The Sky Foothill Divine Palace had always been transcendent, not caring about the various major sacred palace’s fights, letting them develop unrestricted.

No idea how long it had been since the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s divine envoy had descended upon the secular world already.

Everyone did not expect that this divine envoy was actually so overbearing.

Interrupting other people’s closed-seclusion cultivation was all martial artists’ taboo. It could virtually be mentioned in the same breath as killing one’s parents.

Because a single mishap and it would ruin other people’s cultivation road!

This sort of thing, to any martial artist, especially Deity Realm powerhouses, was unacceptable.

Ye Yuan was undoubtedly a savior-like existence to the White Night Sacred Palace.

No matter who it was, they were not willing to risk a grave mistake to go and interrupt Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion.

Even if this one in front of them was the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s divine envoy.

“Mn?”

Azurepeak’s brows furrowed, looking at the Bai Chen in front of him coldly.

This kid actually dared to block his path.

“Are you courting death? This divine envoy brought the Sky Foothill Divine Token down. If you stop this divine envoy from doing my mission, even if you’re the lord of a sacred palace, I’ll kill you all the same!”

Azurepeak glared, a surge of powerful aura crushed over toward Bai Chen. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled, directly backing up a few steps before barely managing to stand firm. The injuries that he had just suppressed flared up again, a strand of fresh blood remaining at the corners of his mouth.

But he was completely oblivious of this and said with Azurepeak with clasped hands, “Lord Divine Envoy, please calm your anger. Bai Chen doesn’t dare to contend with the divine palace. It’s just that Grand Elder is too important to our White Night Sacred Palace. Once he runs amok because his cultivation is interrupted, it can be said to be a catastrophic blow to our White Night Sacred Palace! Bai Chen begs Lord Divine Envoy to give us another three days’ time. We’ve already sent the communication talisman into Grand Elder’s closed-seclusion venue. Once he reaches a cultivation interval, he’ll definitely exit seclusion to welcome divine envoy!”

Mo Yun was originally on tenterhooks at one side, planning on making a move at any time.

But did not expect that Bai Chen actually said these words.

It looked like their young lord finally grew up!

“Get lost!”

However, Azurepeak was not moved at all as he shouted to Bai Chen in a solemn voice.

Bai Chen’s expression changed, not expecting that this guy was actually so unreasonable.

“If he’s in closed-seclusion for 100 years, does this divine envoy have to wait 100 years here? This divine envoy doesn’t have so much spare time! One more time, get lost! Otherwise, don’t blame me!” Azurepeak said coldly.

The expressions of Bai Xiu and the rest changed several times and they spoke up to warn him, “Palace Lord, move aside!”

Bai Chen’s face actually had a look of unwillingness but knew that this divine envoy could not be offended.

The consequences of offending the divine envoy, the White Night Sacred Palace could not afford it.

If he was just a loner without anyone, he would rather die than take a step back.

But he was currently the White Night Palace Lord, representing the whole White Night Sacred Palace.

“Yes ...”

Bai Chen finally still opened up a path.

“Humph!”

Azurepeak gave a cold snort and walked right by Bai Chen’s side.

Mo Yun heaved and went up to pat Bai Chen’s shoulders, saying: “Let’s go over and take a look too! Just hope that Lord Ye Yuan isn’t at the most critical juncture right now.”

Bai Chen nodded his head unwillingly and followed after helplessly.

...

“This is Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion place?”

“Replying Lord Divine Envoy, precisely so! Your Excellency ...”

Bai Xiu was just about to persuade some more but was directly interrupted by Azurepeak with a hand gesture.

“The orders of the divine palace cannot be defied! If he’s really an intruder, nobody can shoulder the responsibility! As for whether or not is he currently at a critical juncture of cultivation, it will depend on his fortunes!”

Azurepeak’s voice did not carry the least bit of emotion.

Clearly, he, this divine envoy, had a lofty and aloof perspective.

At this time, the aura on Azurepeak’s body skyrocketed, suddenly throwing a palm out, slamming right at the door.

The hearts of Bai Chen and the rest all leaped to their throats, wishing to pounce to block this palm.

But this palm was very powerful. Even the grand array set up outside the cultivation room was bound to not be able to withstand it too.

Boom!

This palm shattered the grand array without any surprises, slamming onto the cultivation chamber’s door.

But right at this time, an incomparably sacred aura enveloped the entire courtyard, making everyone have an impulse to prostrate in worship.

“Puhwark!”

Azurepeak’s entire person was akin to suffering a heavy blow, directly spewing out a large mouthful of blood mist, his body flying out backward. He was actually knocked unconscious straight away.

Everyone all stared at this scene with dumbfounded looks, completely unaware of what happened.

A sacred light screen descended from the sky, enveloping the entire cultivation chamber inside.

“This ... What on earth is going on here? The aura coming from the cultivation chamber is so terrifying. I ... I actually have an impulse to want to run away.”

“Could it be that ... Lord Ye Yuan is the legendary son of God? Lord Divine Envoy profaned the might of God just now?”

“Just what is Lord Ye Yuan cultivating? This is too terrifying! Lord Divine Envoy is a grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse. He was actually knocked right out!”

...

Seeing the Azurepeak lying on the ground unconscious, no idea why, Bai Chen actually felt satisfied in his heart.

“This guy really brought trouble to himself! Hahaha, Master Ye Yuan is Master Ye Yuan, forever can’t be estimated with common sense!” Bai Chen was secretly pleased.

Before long, the light faded. Everything returned to normal.

Creak ...

The cultivation chamber’s door opened from inside. Ye Yuan slowly walked out.

The moment Ye Yuan appeared, the many Deity Realm powerhouses in the courtyard actually felt like Mount Tai crushing down on top all of a sudden.

That sacred aura on Ye Yuan’s body was cut from the same cloth as that light screen earlier!

Seeing so many people gathered in the courtyard, Ye Yuan said with a puzzled look, “What are you all doing here?”

Bai Chen came before Ye Yuan and briefly recounted the events that happened recently. Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly when he heard it.

This rumor was clearly intentionally spread by someone!

In an instant, Ye Yuan thought of a lot.

With Ye Yuan’s understanding of Bai Chen, he would not do so.

Then, it was Mo Yun?

Either that, or it was the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace who was unresigned to suffering a huge loss, deliberately fabricating this rumor and spreading it out.

Except, this hearsay was not a rumor, but real.

Of course, there was still another kind of possibility, that was that somebody else knew his identity and wanted to borrow the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s strength to finish him off!

These three situations were all possible.

Could it be that ... Wu Meng Academy also had someone enter the Sky Foothill World?

Ye Yuan’s heart sunk. An inexplicable anger burned in his belly.

It was not without this possibility!

The Qin Family could even influence Wu Meng City Lord’s decision-making. Knowing that he was in the Sky Foothill World and getting this world’s coordinates did not seem to be something unthinkable!

Ye Yuan gave Bai Chen a glance and said with a frown, “You’re injured?”

He shot another glance at the Azurepeak lying on the ground and said, “It was done by that guy?”
