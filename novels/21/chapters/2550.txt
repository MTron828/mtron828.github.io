Chapter 2556: Not Selling to You Anymore!

In front of Sky Gathering Establishment, it was long already packed until not even water could seep through.

Five years ago, a one point heavenly alchemist defeated Nation Teacher and caused a great sensation in the entire city!

Now, the one point heavenly alchemist was going to challenge the Jasper Regeneration Pill that no one could refine, which naturally attracted even more attention.

Furthermore, this wager even concerned the title of nation teacher!

“Five years have passed. I wonder what level of strength that one point heavenly alchemist has reached!”

“Heh heh,?no matter what level he reached, it’s also impossible to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill!”

“A one point heavenly alchemist is indeed heaven-defying, but five years’ time is too short!”

… …

The vast majority of the people still felt pessimistic about Ye Yuan.

It was not that they did not believe in Ye Yuan’s talent. But that five years’ time was too short.

Five years were not even enough to learn the rudiments of heavenly pills.

Even if Ye Yuan could refine a seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, there were a hundred thousand Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills between the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill and Jasper Regeneration Pill!

This disparity was not what a short five years could make up for.

“He’s here, he’s here! The one point heavenly alchemist is here!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd.

Ye Yuan led the Tang Family’s people and arrived in front of the Sky Gathering Establishment.

Nation Teacher Lin Lan walked out slowly and said with a smile, “Master Ye came? Looking at Master Ye’s energetic appearance, victory should be in your grasp, right? I, this old nation teacher, am probably going to have to abdicate!”

The intel that Eldest Prince grasped, Lin Lan naturally grasped it too.

Therefore, he already won this bet!

Regarding the humiliation of the past five years, he was going to return it all to Ye Yuan today!

“Yeah, you’re old. It’s time to relinquish your position!” Ye Yuan followed up.

Lin Lan did not care either and said with a smile,?“Huhu,

?flattery, like perfume, should be smelled not swallowed! Refined five years’ worth of basic heavenly pills and never even once touched the Jasper Regeneration Pill. This nation teacher really wants to know what you’ll use to win this nation teacher!”

“What?! Refined five years of basic heavenly pills?”

“What a joke! What’s the use of basic heavenly pills!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Goodness gracious, it isn’t true, right? Even if Ye Yuan refined the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill until he shatters the sky, he can’t refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill too!”

… …

With Lin Lan’s one sentence, the entire crowd directly exploded.

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan should have been studying the Jasper Regeneration Pill frantically in the past five years.

At least, he should be working in this direction too.

However, he did not!

Ye Yuan spent five years’ time on merely just basic heavenly pills!

Basic heavenly pills were entry-level heavenly pills, the basic skill of heavenly alchemists!

Studying this kind of heavenly pill did not help the Jasper Regeneration Pill at all!

Which was also to say that this wager was actually just a joke?

On Sky Gathering Establishment’s second floor, one could have a commanding view of the situation outside.

A middle-aged man dressed in faint azure long robes was currently standing by the window and looking at everything below.

This middle-aged man’s gaze brimmed with radiating vigor, full of power and energy, radiating awe without being angry. He was precisely Eastward Country’s emperor, Qiao Kaiyuan!

The emperor said, “Old Second, this is the person that you chose? You disappoint Us greatly!”

At this time, Second Prince was currently standing next to Qiao Kaiyuan.

Hearing this, he could not help sweating profusely.

He also did not expect that Ye Yuan actually spent these five years all on basic heavenly pills!

“Royal Father, Ye Yuan’s alchemy talent is extremely heaven-defying! As long as give him time, he can definitely surpass Nation Teacher!” Second Prince gritted his teeth and said.

Qiao Kaiyuan had both hands behind his back as he said coolly, “No matter how strong his talent is, it’s also pointless if he doesn’t have the temperament! Ascenders often act in undue confidence of their own ability and look down upon others. Their outcomes are mostly tragic! He’s no exception either! Clearly, he doesn’t have the assurance, but he set a five-year gamble! This kind of person isn’t worth entrusting our future!”

Second Prince’s cold sweat poured profusely. The emperor’s words were equivalent to sentencing him to death!

Eldest Prince already went up to the second floor at some point and just happened to hear this, and he could not help being wildly elated in his heart.

“Huhu,?Royal Father is wise! This boy is conceited and condescending! Winning against Nation Teacher the last time, although he has strength, there was also a lot of luck. But he thought that he already surpassed Nation Teacher. What a joke!” Eldest Prince said with a laugh.

Qiao Kaiyuan nodded and said, “What Yu Qin said is right. A seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is indeed amazing. But it’s also merely just amazing!”

As he spoke, he already turned around and left the window, and sat down in the room.

He gave his two sons a glance and said coolly, “These few years, We have been mentally and physically exhausted and already have the thought of abdicating! Yu Qin is level-headed when doing things and acts after planning things. Apart from this, he even kept the three Jadetrue Heavenly Sect envoys at bay these few years, rendering utmost contributions! We feel at east handing over the country to Yu Qin!”

Second Prince’s entire body trembled, his gaze revealing a look of despair.

He did not expect that Royal Father actually directly announced the sentence at this time!

He lost!

Eldest Prince was wildly ecstatic in his heart, but the expression on his face was controlled just right.

When the emperor saw this scene, he became even more certain of his judgment in his heart.

“After this matter is over, We will choose a date to announce this matter!” Qiao Kaiyuan gave the final word.

Second Prince gritted his teeth and said, “Royal Father, I … am unconvinced!”

Qiao Kaiyuan did not get angry and said coolly, “Yu Tang, now that things have played out like this, what bargaining chips do you still have in your hand? Nation Teacher has chosen a side. You’re not fated with the envoys. You … no longer have cards to play from your hand!”

Second Prince said in a solemn voice, “No! Royal Father is wrong! If Ye Yuan can win, the nation teacher … will be mine!”

Eldest Prince laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Old Second, have you become desperate from losing? Now that it has come to this, could it be that you still feel that Ye Yuan can win? A fellow who refined five years’ worth of basic heavenly pills, you expect him to be able to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill?”

Second Prince smiled coldly and said, “My elder brother! The last time, no one was optimistic about him either, right? How can you guarantee that he won’t be able to turn the tables this time?”

Eldest Prince still wanted to speak, but heard Qiao Kaiyuan say coolly, “If he can really win, We can retract our order! It’s just that it’s impossible!”

People did not know that the ownership of Eastward Country’s emperor was decided on this second floor just like that.

In front of Sky Gathering Establishment, people were all grumbling that Ye Yuan overestimated his own ability.

Clearly did not have that ability, but insisted on attempting it.

Beside Lin Lan, Xie Hua laughed loudly and said, “Ye Yuan, didn’t you say that after five years, you’ll make this Xue come to find you to buy heavenly pills? Now, this Xue is finding you to buy heavenly pills, where’s your heavenly pill??Hahaha?…”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “You seem very pleased with yourself!”

Xie Hua’s expression changed and he changed to a vicious expression and said angrily, “Of course I’m pleased with myself! You severed my heavenly alchemist path. Now, you also cut off your own way out! Do you think I can not be smug??Hahaha?…”

Xie Hua’s hatred towards Ye Yuan was not the slightest bit less than Lin Lan.

How glorious a profession was being a heavenly alchemist?

He had once enjoyed unparalleled glory and was admired by thousands!

But all these were ruined in Ye Yuan’s hands!

Now, seeing Ye Yuan like this, how could he not be happy?

However, Ye Yuan just said with a faint smile, “Is that so? Since you’re so smug, then I won’t be selling my Jasper Regeneration Pill to you anymore!”

Xie Hua laughed loudly when he heard that and said,?“Oh?no, I’m so scared! Your Jasper Regeneration Pill? Your Jasper Regeneration Pill!?Haha,?have you refined a Jasper Regeneration Pill before? How hilarious!”
