1594 Void Spirit Divine-grade

“This ... This is Elder Ye’s strength?”

“No wonder he could become an elder with the identity of a Three-star Alchemy God! There’s no problem at all!”

“Convinced! Really convinced! I never dared to imagine that a Three-star Alchemy God could actually be powerful to such an extent!”

...

When everyone woke up from being enthralled by the aura of Dao. Each and every one of them was incredibly shocked.

Ye Yuan’s pill refinement made them broaden their horizons.

Only then did they truly understand what Ye Yuan relied on to become an elder.

Ye Yuan already finished, but Ruo Xu was still meticulously concocting his medicinal pill.

The people who were originally still marveling at Head Elder’s pill refinement, looking back at it again now, there was actually a dull feeling.

No idea how long had passed either, Head Elder’s Vastsun Universe Pill was finally refined completely.

Regarding the pill refinement this time, he was very satisfied.

Based on his judgment, it was at least heaven-grade too.

Being able to refine Vastsun Universe Pill to heaven-grade, one could practically be in an undefeatable position already.

When he saw that Ye Yuan was still standing there, looking at him calmly, he even thought that Ye Yuan did not refine one.

“Huhu, gave up? Now, do you know the disparity between you and me?” Ruo Xu smiled and said.

Ye Yuan looked at him with a smile that was not a smile and said, “I’ve long finished refining. It’s you who were too slow.”

Ruo Xu seemed to have heard the most hilarious joke in the world and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Still being stubborn until now, do you think that the Vastsun Universe Pill is a cabbage, can be refined completely in this short while? Or is it that you treated those spirit medicines as stir-frying a dish, cooking them in one pot?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not speak.

At this time, an elder ran to Ruo Xu’s side and said a few words in his ears.

Ruo Xu’s expression changed, looking at Ye Yuan with amazement.

He opened his mouth but did not know what he should say.

Ye Yuan ... He really refined it!

A Three-star Alchemy God, how could it be possible to refine the Vastsun Universe Pill?

This medicinal pill was the taboo of Three-star Alchemy Gods!

Ruo Xu abruptly startled awake, his eyes sweeping across the other people’s faces, instantly understanding something.

He was incomparably ashamed and resentful as he said to Ye Yuan in a cold voice, “Open the furnace, this old man wants to see what the hell you refined!”

Everyone’s faces also revealed a fascinated look. They were all very curious, to be able to have that kind of terrifying alchemy art, to what grade did Ye Yuan refine it.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Open then. Head Elder, who first?”

Head Elder said in a deep voice, “You first. This old man is very curious now, what grade of Vastsun Universe Pill can a Three-star Alchemy God actually refine!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “As you wish!”

The moment the medicinal cauldron opened, a dazzling light shot out and reached straight for the firmament, blinding until everyone could not open their eyes.

In the sky, the winds and clouds suddenly changed, and actually formed a rainbow auspicious cloud!

The rainbow auspicious cloud danced in the sky, looking unbelievably magnificent, like celebrating Ye Yuan forming the pill.

In the crowd, cries of exclamations rang out.

“What grade is this medicinal pill? To actually be able to trigger a heaven and earth phenomenon!”

“Are you dumb?! Heaven and earth phenomenon, only void spirit divine-grade and above medicinal pills can trigger it! Elder Ye’s medicinal pill already reached void spirit divine-grade!”

“G-Got to be joking, right? Vastsun Universe Pill, void spirit divine-grade?”

“Really what the frick! I was actually able to see a vast spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill be born!”

...

Head Elder’s face revealed a look of astonishment. With his experience, how could he not understand what happened?

This scene was simply too soul-stirring!

Want to trigger heaven and earth phenomenon, it was not just any kind of medicinal pill reaching void spirit divine-grade could work!

Only a pil like the Vastsun Universe Pill that seized the good fortune of heaven and earth could it trigger heaven and earth phenomenon.

And this kind of medicinal pill, wanting to refine void spirit divine-grade was undoubtedly a fool’s talk.

But now, the crazy talk genuinely happened in front of them.

Ye Yuan was just a Three-star Alchemy God!

How could Ye Yuan do it to this extent?

If not for seeing it with his own eyes, Ruo Xu would never believe no matter what that a Three-star Alchemy God could actually refine a vast spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill!

This was simply a joke.

Even if he witnessed the heaven and earth phenomenon with his own eyes, he still felt that this was a joke!

A joke that heaven made toward him.

Xuan Yu heaved a sigh and said with a bitter smile, “I even thought that Ye Yuan could refine purple spirit divine-grade. I didn’t think that he actually directly refined void spirit divine-grade. This guy, I really don’t know where his limit is!”

Lu Yi who was beside him also said in wonder, “Master, Elder Ye is really remarkable! This Void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill, probably the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City will plunge into madness!”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “That is, of course! This time, Ruo Xu miscalculated. If Ye Yuan didn’t have the ability that could be showcased, how could upstairs possibly agree to let him be an elder? I very much want to see if Ruo Xu is opening the furnace or not opening the furnace.”

Lu Yi froze and immediately understood.

He did not expect that the good guy master also had such a mischievous side.

Under this circumstance right now, whether Ruo Xu opened his furnace or not was a very awkward question.

Open, the jewel was in front, he could not present it at all.

Not opening, the exalted head elder actually did not even have the courage to open the furnace.

What an awkward spectacle!

Ruo Xu regretted until his intestines turned green now. If he had long known it was like this, he might as well open the furnace first.

No idea how long had passed either, the rainbow auspicious cloud faded. Everything returned to tranquility.

A medicinal pill suspended above the medicinal cauldron quietly. Fragrance instantly filled the entire plaza.

“So fragrant!”

“It’s my first time smelling such an aromatic medicinal fragrance!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The entire plaza is actually able to smell the medicinal fragrance, void spirit divine-grade is indeed extraordinary.”

...

Everyone’s faces revealed incomparably heated looks. Clearly, they all wanted to obtain this medicinal pill.

There were quite a number of large families’ upper echelons present. Toward this medicinal pill, they were naturally extremely eager for it.

This grade of medicinal pill did not just signify being able to create a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, it even implied the possibility of a limitless future.

Void spirit divine-grade medicinal pills were naturally different from ordinary medicinal pills.

It could consolidate and bolster, stimulating the martial artist’s potential, letting the martial artist have even greater upside potential.

A martial artist who exhausted their potential and could only cultivate to first-layered heaven Divine Lord after consuming medicinal pills, after consuming a void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill, there was a very high hope of breaking through to second-layered heaven Divine Lord, even third-layered Divine Lord!

This was still just those whose talents were poor.

After those with good talent consumed it, their future possibilities would simply be unimaginable.

Such a medicinal pill, how could they not go crazy?

“Head Elder, it’s your turn.”

Ye Yuan’s words made the muscles on Ruo Xu’s face twitch unceasingly.

The scene seemed to have been frozen.

Everyone’s gazes were locked onto Ruo Xu, wanting to see what Head Elder would do.

After all, Head Elder’s status was exalted.

Ye Yuan’s words virtually forced him into a corner.

Today, no matter what, Head Elder’s face was considered utterly lost.

“You ... You won!”

Ruo Xu practically squeezed these few words out from the crevices between his teeth.
