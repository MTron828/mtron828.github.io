Chapter 2276: Still Remember Those Two Pats?

Ye Yuan looked at Tang Yucheng and said with a look of surprise, “I trusted you so much, and yet you actually sold me out?”

Tang Yucheng laughed loudly and said, “If I didn’t say that, would you let me go? What a fool! You got fooled by me with a few words!”

Ye Yuan had an expression like he had resigned himself to fate and said with a sigh, “Sigh, why did you have to do this?”

Tang Yucheng said smugly, “A measly lowly ant, do you really think that I’d take it to heart? This Heavenspan World has too many ants! My cousin toyed with a few ants, what does it matter? But Old Drunkard killed him! That violated heavenly law!”

Tang Yucheng was a so-called proud son of heaven!

He was birthed by two great Heavenly Emperors. Furthermore, his roots were excellent. He was an Empyrean Realm super powerhouse the moment he was born.

In his eyes, those below Empyrean Realm were all ants.

How could this kind of silkpants think anything of the life and death of mere Divine Lord Realms?

Tang Yucheng looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “You think that you can be lawless and unruly with just a peak Empyrean cultivation? This young master tells you, in front of my father and mother, you’re likewise an ant!”

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain looked at Ye Yuan, his gaze cold as he said, “Heard that? In front of a Heavenly Emperor, all are ants! Punk, are you ending yourself, or do you want this Heavenly Emperor to take action?”

Ye Yuan ignored him, but looked at Tang Yucheng and said smilingly, “But in my eyes, you’re an ant too!”

Tang Yucheng laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “So what if I’m an ant? In front of my parents, can you still kill me?”

Ye Yuan looked at Tang Yucheng like looking at a fool and said with a smile, “Still remember the two pats that I patted you with before you left?”

Tang Yucheng’s expression changed, and he said in horror, “Y-You’re scaring me?”

Not just Tang Yucheng, Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain’s and Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance’s expressions changed wildly, looking over toward Tang Yucheng subconsciously.

However, it was already too late.

Pah! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan snapped his fingers. All of a sudden, countless sword energy poured out of the body.

Tang Yucheng was directly sliced into countless chunks by the sword energy.

Those two pats were sword energy left within Tang Yucheng’s body.

As long as Ye Yuan activated it, it would erupt crazily.

It was just that with Tang Yucheng’s strength, he was unable to detect it at all.

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain and Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance two people stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, looking at this scene in disbelief.

Their own son was killed in front of them just like this! His corpse could not even be assembled back fully!

Old Drunkard also had a thunderstruck look. He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so crazy, to actually kill the son of Heavenly Emperors in front of them.

Looking at it now, it was not that Ye Yuan was ignorant of worldly affairs.

But since he planted sword energy inside Tang Yucheng’s body, why didn’t he threaten the two great Heavenly Emperors with this?

He discovered that he could not understand the way Ye Yuan did things at all!

But Ye Yuan did not care. Like he did a trivial thing, he smiled and said, “Inviting the two of you here is to ask you two for something. Return Old Drunkard’s divine soul imprint to me, okay?”

Rumble!

Rumble!

Two terrifying forces rushed straight for Ye Yuan like sharp swords.

“Divine soul imprint? Heh heh! You killed my son, this emperor will definitely grind your bones to dust to vent the hatred in my heart!” Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance bellowed shrilly.

Tang Yucheng was important in her heart. Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance doted on him to the extreme, unable to bear letting him suffer at all.

But now, Ye Yuan actually killed him just like this. So how could Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance not be furious?

She vented all of her wrath on Ye Yuan.

After being stunned, Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain was similarly enraged to the extreme and said in a cold voice, “Very good, punk! You’ve got guts! Very soon, you’ll regret having come to this world!”

Swoosh!

Not waiting for Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain to take action, Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance already teleported in front of Ye Yuan and suddenly smacked a palm down.

Dao marks flickered. The terrifying energy undulation made the expressions of everyone present suddenly change.

The attack of a Heavenly Emperor in anger, how terrifying was the power?

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure!

But right at this time, over a thousand flying swords suddenly flew out. A terrifying sword formation suddenly lit up.

In an instant, Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance was trapped by the sword formation.

Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance came in anger, but at this time, she was extremely alarmed and furious.

Being trapped inside the sword formation, whatever Dao marks, whatever heaven and earth pressure, it all could not stand up to a single blow in front of the sword formation.

At present, Ye Yuan was already faintly going to break through to the next realm, virtually standing at the peak of Chaos Realm. Regardless of whether it was divine essence or soul force, it climbed to an unattainable peak.

The power of the sword formation was significantly stronger than when at the Hidden Lineage!

At that time, this sword formation could already overpower the divine race’s powerhouses, let alone a mere First Firmament Heavenly Emperor?

In other people’s view, Heavenly Emperors might be very powerful.

But in Ye Yuan’s eyes, it was also just like that.

Old Drunkard’s pupils constricted, the shock in his heart unable to be any greater.

He never thought that Ye Yuan’s strength could actually already contend with Heavenly Emperors!

“This ... This is simply too astonishing! He clearly only has Empyrean Realm cultivation, but he can rival Heavenly Emperors! Even Lord Immortal Grove is far inferior to him too!”

Old Drunkard initially felt that Ye Yuan having peak Divine Lord cultivation in 2000 years was already astonishingly talented.

But he discovered that Ye Yuan’s growth already completely exceeded his cognition!

In just 2000 years, from an Origin Deity Realm brat, growing into a leviathan who had the ability to rival Heavenly Emperors!

This sort of thing, he did not even dare to think about it!

He finally understood why Ye Yuan did not care about Tang Yucheng’s identity in the slightest.

Because he totally had this strength!

Over there, Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain’s expression changed wildly, and he cried out in shock, “Sword Dao source! Formation Dao source!”

Just a breath’s time, Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance’s world domain was already compressed by Ye Yuan’s sword formation significantly.

Before long, this sword formation would be able to breach Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance’s defenses.

At that time, Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance could only face a dead end.

How could he still hesitate? He shouted, “Wife, I’ll come and help you!”

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain took a step and circled out the sword formation, charging straight for Ye Yuan himself.

As long as he killed Ye Yuan, the sword formation would naturally collapse on itself!

It was just that, how could Ye Yuan let him do as he wished?

All of a sudden, half of the flying swords in the sword formation pulled back, directly matching up against Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain.

Both sides fought fiercely without rest. The terrifying energy fought until the surroundings were full of pits and holes.

Ye Yuan battling two great Heavenly Emperors with his power alone, he was not the least bit afraid, and faintly showed signs of suppressing the two people instead.

The subordinates that Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain brought over were already dumbfounded.

This brat that popped out from no idea where, his strength was also too fearsome, right?

Heavenly Emperor Swiftrain currently had a bitterness that he could not articulate. He thought that Ye Yuan dividing the forces to save himself, with their two great Heavenly Emperors’ strength, they would naturally be able to crack the sword formation.

But, Ye Yuan merely used half the flying swords and trapped him already.

He unleashed all of his abilities and was barely able to fight to a draw with Ye Yuan.

But fortunately, the pressure at Heavenly Emperor Phoenixdance that side fell sharply, and she could resist the sword formation presently.

Ye Yuan controlled the sword formation and still had the strength to spare as he said coolly, “Me letting him go was already giving him a chance. Yet, he called the two of you over, that’s him courting death. Not educating the son is the father’s fault! The two of you brought up such a son, you’re also no better yourselves. Since that’s the case, I’ll send you guys on your way then!”
