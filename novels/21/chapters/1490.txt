Chapter 1494 Giving In

Inside a hidden private estate in the capital city, Huo En was currently kneeling in front of a man in black, fearful and in awe.

“Huo En, do you know your mistake?” The man in black said coolly.

“Your Excellency, I ... know my mistake!” Huo En hesitated for a bit, but finally still admitted his fault.

The man in black slowly turned around and said coldly, “In the Assassination Hall, you aren’t wrong. But in the entire Blood Yama Hall, you’ve made a grave error. Now, the Fiend Medicine Hall and Hundred Knows Hall are applying pressure on me at the same time. The pressure on me, this hall master, is also huge!”

Huo En was a capable general under his command. When the Fiend Medicine Hall came over, he still supported Huo En a bit.

But, he never thought that later on, the Hundred Knows Hall actually came over to put pressure too. This doubled the pressure on him, a hall master.

The Assassination Hall primarily did some things that could not see the light and could not appear on the stage.

The prestige of the Blood Yama Hall was mainly established by the Fiend Medicine Hall and Hundred Knows Hall, these two halls.

The function of the Assassination Hall was to kill.

Huo En was depressed in his heart!

His position in the Assassination Hall was around the same as Meng Qi’s in the Fiend Medicine Hall. Hence, he did not take Meng Qi’s warning to heart as well. He even left a few harsh words.

He did not expect that now, his face was slapped resoundingly.

Huo En was flustered inwardly and said, “Your Excellency, what ... what should this subordinate do?”

The man in black swept a glance over him indifferently and said, “An assassin failing an assassination, the outcome ... you know it.”

Huo En’s entire body trembled, his gaze revealing a look of despair.

He originally thought that it was a big business for him. He did not expect that his life actually had to be capitulated on this mission!

“Do it yourself then!” The words of the man in black carried some melancholy.

Honestly speaking, he did not think that Huo En did anything wrong. What was wrong was that this was a world where the strong prey on the weak!

For that young man called Source Night to be able to make two great halls value so highly, it indicated that he was a figure who carried a lot of weight.

Then one could only say that Huo En was unlucky.

Who asked him to provoke someone he should not provoke?

“ARGHHH ... !”

Huo En’s gaze revealed a fierce look, his body suddenly burst apart.

Clank!

A black token dropped onto the ground.

The man in black extended a hand and beckoned. The token landed in his hand.

...

After Ye Yuan returned from the Hundred Knows Hall, he went to the Fiend Medicine Hall again to give Meng Qi they all a lesson.

Meng Qi and the rest naturally benefited greatly.

But this time, there was an additional person listening to him preach Dao, the Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master!

He was a Three-star Fiend Apothecary, his status in Capone Capital City extremely revered.

Even ordinary Fiend Commander powerhouses found it hard to meet him.

A single one of the medicinal pills that he refined was hard to seek after.

But this time, he was like a student, sitting together with Meng Qi and the rest respectfully, listening to Ye Yuan preach on Dao.

On the first day, he relied on his status and hid next door to listen.

But on the second day, he sat together with Meng Qi and the rest very conscientiously.

The contents that Ye Yuan preached on were not some profound maxim of Great Dao. It was just some alchemy basic skills.

But to them, it was akin to obtaining a priceless treasure.

Ye Yuan discovered that their cultivation system was too messy. These Fiend Apothecaries’ basic skills were too poor, resulting in affecting the pill refinement’s result in the end.

As the saying went: details determined success or failure, and alchemy skill was an extremely meticulous art in the first place and did not tolerate any sloppiness.

Ye Yuan targeted the Fiend Apothecaries’ characteristics and summarized some cultivation methods, imparting it to them.

One should not look down on these simple basic skills. Actually, Meng Qi their standards were not lousy. They just had to practice some basic stuff properly and the effects would be immediate.

Compared to elucidating on some profound things, these little tips were more effective instead.

After the last sermon, the five elders including the hall master cultivated the spirit calming and mind focusing spells that Ye Yuan imparted, and they discovered that the medicinal pills’ quality improved significantly all of a sudden.

This result made them wildly ecstatic.

Therefore, each and every one of them revered Ye Yuan akin to a god.

This time, Ye Yuan talked for five days and five nights in a row, making everyone wholly enraptured.

Following that, the spirit medicines that Ye Yuan wanted also arrived, and he returned straight to the Fan Family, planning on going into a retreat.

The closed-seclusion this time, apart from refining the Second Transformation Profound Gold Pill, he even purchased a large batch of spirit medicines from the Fiend Medicine Hall.

He wanted to refine a batch of divine essence advancing medicinal pills and assault late-stage Heaven Glimpse!

Ye Yuan killed Xiu Lie before entering the fiend race and obtained all of the wealth on his body.

A half-step Fiend Lord powerhouse’s wealth, that was rather terrifying.

Ye Yuan using it to purchase spirit medicines, cultivating to the Origin Deity Realm was also plenty to spare.

As long as there were sufficient medicinal pills supporting him, Ye Yuan’s cultivation would be very fast.

But before closed-seclusion, Ye Yuan welcomed a guest, the Assassination Hall’s hall master, You Ming[1]!

Even the Fan Family’s family head did not recognize You Ming.

It was You Ming himself making his identity known before the Fan Family’s family head knew who he was.

His arrival made the Fan Family’s family head panic.

For so many years, the Assassination Hall’s hall master was an existence who daunted people. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Even if they were the four great families’ family heads, they were also extremely afraid of him.

Even though their realm was more or less the same, You Ming this person had always been hidden in the night, no idea when he would reap people’s lives.

In history, the Assassination Hall had once destroyed a major family. And that major family’s strength was not weaker than the Fan Family.

The Assassination Hall’s strength was too terrifying!

If say that the major families were in awe of the City Lord, then toward the Assassination Hall, it was fear.

Because your life would be gone without knowing when.

But when Ye Yuan saw You Ming, he did not have much of a feeling.

People all had weaknesses, and You Ming’s weakness was clearly being grasped by the Fiend Medicine Hall.

Him coming to find him openly indicated that the Assassination Hall gave in.

“This is Huo En’s Blood Yama Token. He has already committed suicide to offer an apology. There’s his divine soul imprint on it. You can check it,” You Ming threw over the black token and directly said this.

Ye Yuan received the Blood Yama Token but did not check. He just casually threw it to one side and said coolly, “This is your affair, nothing to do with me.”

You Ming could not help suffocating when he saw the situation, immediately discovering that Ye Yuan was not easy to deal with.

Before coming to meet Ye Yuan, he had already seen the Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master.

But the two people’s behavior was very different.

He felt that this young man in front of him was even harder to deal with that the wild old fox Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master,

You Ming sucked in a deep breath and said, “This matter was my Assassination Hall’s fault, I apologize to you on behalf of the Assassination Hall. Sir Source Night, please raise your hand high in mercy.”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “I said, this is your affair, nothing to do with me! The Assassination Hall accepting a bounty and killing people, this is something perfectly justified.”

You Ming nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood. This punk was too cunning.

These words were said until he did not have any room to refute at all.

Yeah, the Assassination Hall was not wrong. What was wrong was that they provoked someone that should not have provoked!

But, with Ye Yuan not relenting, the Fiend Medicine Hall and Hundred Knows Hall both would not drop the matter.

What can I do?

I’m very powerless too!

You Ming wished to dig Huo En out from underground right now and kill him again.
