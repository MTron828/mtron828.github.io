1417 I Disagree!

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled. His gaze revealed a look of astonishment.

“I-Impossible! How can Master Ye Yuan possibly be an outside trial-taker? I ... I completely couldn’t perceive it at all!”

Trial-takers were not some secret among the Sky Foothill World’s upper echelons. With Bai Chen’s status, he had clearly heard before.

Mo Yun sucked in a deep breath and said, “I won’t see wrongly! These medicinal pills are extremely similar to the medicinal pills on that trial-taker’s body! It’s just that the medicinal properties are much stronger than that!”

Bai Chen’s eyes revealed an extremely complicated look. Clearly, his inner-heart was also struggling fiercely.

The Sky Foothill Divine Palace had once issued a strict order. Upon discovering trial-takers, kill them without amnesty!

Now, what should they do?

This trial-taker was the life-savior of these master and disciple!

“Then ... Then what should we do? Go ... Go to the Sky Foothill Divine Palace and report him? No way! Absolutely not! Master Ye Yuan is my life-savior. I can’t do this kind of repaying kindness with an ingratitude action!”

Bai Chen directly denied the idea of going to report Ye Yuan. But he also did not know what he should do and fell into a dilemma for a moment.

Mo Yun said in a solemn voice, “These trial-takers treat our Sky Foothill World as a breeding ground, taking whatever they please, and is the enemy of all of us Sky Foothill martial artists! How can this kind of person be indulged?”

Bai Chen’s expression flickered incessantly, falling silent.

Finally, he still said, “I, Bai Chen, would rather be reviled for generation after generation and also not be willing to be a person who repays kindness with ingratitude! Master Ye Yuan agreed to help me under this sort of circumstances. If I betray him instead, what’s the difference from a pig or a dog? Teacher Mo Yun, if you disagree with my decision, I won’t force you either. You can go and report Master Ye Yuan, but I’ll live and die together with him!”

Mo Yun did not expect that his disciple would actually say these words. A conflicted look appeared on his face and he finally still heaved a sigh and said, “Alright then, who asked you and me to be as close as father and son! Since you’ve already decided, I’ll walk this path with you until it’s dark!”

Bai Chen did not know that his every action was all under Ye Yuan’s surveillance.

And his decision saved his own life too.

With Ye Yuan’s cautiousness, how could he possibly make this kind of low-level mistake?

Him deliberately doing so was actually giving Bai Chen a chance to choose. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If he helped Bai Chen sit on the seat of palace lord and he opened his mouth to ask for the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone in the future, Bai Chen would definitely suspect.

Since he was going to expose his identity sooner or later, might as well let Bai Chen know earlier.

If Bai Chen betrayed him, he would kill Bai Chen without the slightest hesitation.

Ye Yuan’s objective of coming to the Sky Foothill World was very simple, it was for the sake of the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone.

That was Mu Lingxue’s life-saving object. Ye Yuan absolutely would not allow any accidents!

Even if he was not willing to kill Bai Chen.

Fortunately, Bai Chen chose to stand on his side.

...

In the White Night Sacred Palace’s great hall, Bai Xiu sat on the seat of honor, his brows tightly knitted.

“I’ve just received the news. A large group of Autumn Rain Sacred Palace powerhouses has already entered the White Night Sacred Palace’s sphere of influence. There are probably still a few days and they’ll reach here! Most likely ... we must come up with a conclusion today!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions on everyone’s faces were all different.

Some were worried, some were afraid, some were angry.

The truest face of human nature could probably only be seen at this time as well.

“Deputy Palace Lord, Your Excellency, I think there isn’t anything to discuss! This position of palace lord, regardless of which son takes it, it’s not suitable. Best for you to take over the position of palace lord!” said an elder.

The moment these words came out, somebody immediately concurred: “Yeah. Facing a formidable foe, although the young masters are all pretty good, they don’t enjoy high prestige and command universal respect like Deputy Palace Lord, Your Excellency. There’s nothing to discuss, so it’s decided like this!”

“Deputy Palace Lord, Your Excellency’s strength is the most powerful, prestige the highest. Only with you coming forward, can it lead us to resist the powerful enemy! This position of palace lord, accept it!” said another person.

There were a total of eight elders present. They were all Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouses.

The moment they spoke, there were already three elders who agreed.

The remainder, each and every one of their faces all revealed looks of struggle. But they were leaning toward Bai Xiu as well.

“What are you all still waiting for? Could it be waiting for our White Night Sacred Palace to be exterminated, then you all will choose the new palace lord?” said the elder who spoke first earlier.

Everyone’s expression changed. This sentence became the last straw that broke the camel’s back.

“Alright, I ... I agree!”

“I agree too!”

“I ... agree!”

The elders all expressed their attitudes one after another, all agreeing for Bai Xiu to take over the seat of palace lord.

Bai Xiu was wildly elated in his heart, but on the surface, he put on a difficult expression and said, “This ... How can this do? The White Night Sacred Palace was established by the previous, previous generation palace lord single-handedly, and brought to greater heights in the hands of the old palace lord. What capabilities do I, Bai Xiu, have, to dare succeed the position of palace lord?”

“My Lord Deputy Palace lord, stop declining it! You’re surnamed Bai too, and are brothers in arms with the old palace lord. Why can’t you be the palace lord? Keep declining and the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace will slaughter to the doorstep!”

“Yeah, Deputy Palace Lord, just agree!”

...

The few elders were anxious too, all urging Bai Xiu to succeed the position of palace lord.

Although Bai Xiu was also surnamed Bai, he was not a blood relative of the old palace lord.

In terms of blood lineage, it was naturally the few sons who were the most orthodox.

It was just that at this time, there was already no one who cared about what they thought.

Bai Xiu heaved a long sigh and said, “Since that’s the case, then Bai Xiu will make the best of things and take over the position of palace lord! But I’ll declare it first, I’m only temporarily acting in the position of palace lord. When they grow up, we’ll choose a young master with the greatest prestige to succeed the position of palace lord again!”

The moment these words came out, the elders’ faces all revealed looks of relief.

“Palace Lord, Your Excellency, truly understands the principles of right and wrong, to actually consider so thoroughly! Then this matter is decided! Today, we’ll announce to the entire White Night Sacred Palace in the name of the Elders Association, Deputy Palace Lord Bai Xiu will take over the position of palace lord!” said the elder.

The other few elders also nodded slightly, clearly very satisfied with Bai Xiu’s attitude.

Bai Xiu smiled and said, “Alright, then that’s it for today first! Facing a formidable enemy, I must go and arrange for some things. This matter of announcing to the world will have to trouble the elders!”

“I disagree!”

Right at this time, the Ye Yuan who remained silent all along finally spoke up.

The elders looked at Ye Yuan like looking at a fool, not recognizing this guy at all.

A guy without the slightest divine essence undulation on his body actually dared to talk drivel here?

“Where did this crackpot come from? To actually dare act wildly in the Elders Association? How can the matters that the Elders Association decided be what you can disagree?” That elder who had always endorsed Bai Xiu immediately spoke up to berate.

Under this current situation, Bai Chen had long already been marginalized.

Although he came to the Elders Association, nobody would care about his opinion at all.

As for who he brought, there was naturally even less who paid attention.

Moreover, Ye Yuan looked just like a mortal.

Too unremarkable!

Ye Yuan could not even be bothered to look at him. He just looked toward Bai Xiu and said with a faint smile, “Hey, your acting is pretty good! But ... it ends here. I don’t agree with you becoming the palace lord!”
