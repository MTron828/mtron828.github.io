Chapter 2923: Creating a Miracle!

“Haha,?the two of you can’t do it! My soul body is about to break through right away and reach six wroughts!”

Qin Shitian’s unbridled laughter came from in front.

At this time, the three of them had already made it to the fourth segment, the disparity also gradually manifested.

Qin Shitian already shook the other two people more than a hundred feet behind.

Furthermore, it showed signs of being shaken off further and further!

Apart from this, Qin Shitian’s soul body became increasingly erratic, an appearance of going to advance ranks.

Soul body was a kind of unique existence. In each realm, the strength of the soul body was divided into ten wroughts.

This magnitude was different from the human race and true spirit clan’s fleshy bodies.

If what humans and the true spirit clan pursued were hardness, then what the soul body pursued was tenacity.

The greater the tenacity, the harder it was to kill!

If a True Sovereign Heaven soul denizen’s soul body could reach ten wroughts, even if an Emperor Cloud Heaven came, it would be difficult to kill them too!

Of course, to the Nirvana Soul Hall, ten wroughts belonged to an existence in legends.

Nobody could reach the realm of ten wroughts at all.

At this time, Qin Shitian’s soul body was about to reach six wroughts. This was already extremely shocking.

Finally, Qin Shitian took the lead and charged into the Soul Controlling Avenue’s fifth segment!

Then, his soul body became even clearer, as if a crystalline sculpture.

Great Emperor Eastsun’s pupils constricted, and he said, “Broke through! Six wroughts! Even if it’s this seat, I didn’t reach this step back then too!”

“Hiss?…”

From the powerhouses there came a series of cold air being sucked in.

Six wroughts, that was already the soul body strength in the legends!

“This guy is too strong! Six wroughts, even if he stands there to try to kill him, I can’t kill him either!”

“Although there was an upset in the Lucid Forest, in this round, Qin Shitian finally regained face!”

“Ye Yuan was ultimately just taking advantage by trickery in the Lucid Forest! In terms of strength, he’s far worse than Qin Shitian!”

… …

Under the Soul Controlling Avenue, many people were discussing animatedly.

At this time, there were already many people who came out. Some had passed two segments, succeeding in the test, but some had already been eliminated.

But the strength that Qin Shitian revealed suppressed all of the questioning voices.

Qin Shitian after six wroughts had the air of a king who returned.

Many people looked toward Ye Yuan again. They could not help revealing sympathetic gazes.

This guy was still milling around in the first segment until now.

“Mn? Seems like there’s already no way of upgrading. I’ll enter the second segment then.” Right at this time, Ye Yuan discovered that the first segment’s tempering already had no effect on him.

And his soul body already reached peak two wroughts as well!

Ye Yuan discovered that the divine soul attacks in the Soul Controlling Avenue were very special.

Rather than say that it was a test, it was better to say that it was a kind of tempering!

Entering the second segment, the number and power of the divine soul attacks immediately doubled!

Ye Yuan revolved the Divine Emergence and started guiding these divine soul attacks, tempering his soul body. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hence, he entered the realm of three wroughts smoothly.

It was just that at this time, there was already no one who paid attention to him.

Qin Shitian already caused a great sensation.

The people all wanted to see just which step Qin Shitian could walk until.

After entering the fifth segment, Qin Shitian’s pressure suddenly increased.

They clearly felt that Qin Shitian was straining much more than before.

Even if he entered the realm of six wroughts.

However, he was still advancing with strong determination!

He got nearer and nearer to the sixth segment, the people were already holding their breaths.

“Broke through!”

Right when Qin Shitian stepped into the sixth segment, someone shouted at the top of their voice.

This moment was seriously too exciting.

“Qin Shitian broke through two records in a row! This guy is really monstrous!”

“The accumulations of the Scarlet Drill Battlefield finally erupted at this moment! This guy’s future accomplishments are immeasurable!”

“You guys, look! That Ye Yuan is still persevering! Compared to Qin Shitian, he’s just like a clown now!”

… …

The crowd was boiling over with excitement!

At this time, the inconceivable record that Ye Yuan made in the Lucid Forest, everyone selectively had forgotten about it.

After all, having Dao heart in vain without strength, everything was futile.

And Qin Shitian broke the records of the two stages in a row. This absolutely set the world on fire!

It was because the records of these two rounds were not maintained by the same person!

Even Great Emperor Eastsun’s breathing became irregular too.

He had long predicted that Qin Shitian could step into the sixth segment.

But all the way until this moment arrived, he was still somewhat uncontrollably agitated.

After all, it was too hard to come by.

Someone noticed Ye Yuan. He finally made it to the second segment.

Furthermore, he did not die yet!

His perseverance seemed to have been rewarded.

But, under Qin Shitian’s light, Ye Yuan’s perseverance appeared so laughable.

Right at this time, Zhou Yu and He Chen two people finally could not endure and withdrew.

They only reached the peak fifth segment in the end. They were naturally not satisfied with this result.

In the assessment this time, Qin Shitian completely shook the two of them off!

However, being able to reach the peak fifth segment, it was also sufficient to show their strength.

And Qin Shitian was still continuing to advance forward!

At this time, the entire Soul Controlling Avenue only had Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian two people remaining.

At the back, Ye Yuan, who was slowly crawling like a tortoise, appeared especially glaring to the eye.

When Zhou Yu saw this scene, he smiled coldly and said, “This punk is really impressive. I even thought that he could make it to the tenth segment this time! After half a day, he’s just at the second segment. What a joke!”

The fury of failure ultimately needed a channel to vent.

Clearly, Ye Yuan was very suitable.

He Chen also said disdainfully, “Ignorant thing! This bit of skill and he also dares to swagger in front of us! Really almost got intimidated by him!”

However, everyone’s attention was still on Qin Shitian.

Entering the sixth segment, Qin Shitian’s speed clearly slowed down significantly.

Each step that he took seemed to require all the strength in his body.

But he did not give up.

Just like that, he headed towards the seventh segment step by step.

Following his footsteps, he got nearer and nearer to the seventh segment. Everyone’s hearts were virtually leaping out of their throats.

Too exciting!

Could it be that Qin Shitian could still create an even greater miracle and reach the seventh segment?

1000 feet!

700 feet!

300 feet!

He got closer and closer to the seventh segment.

The expression on Qin Shitian’s face was hideous until it was virtually contorted.

His soul body also suffered immense damage.

The sixth segment’s divine soul attacks were too terrifying!

Hundreds of divine soul attacks assaulted at the same time. It was simply like a bombardment.

Qin Shitian’s soul body was attacked until it virtually distorted.

Finally, he gave up when he was still around 200 feet away from the seventh segment.

The whole place boiled over with excitement!

“What a shame, just 200 feet!”

“Almost created history!”

“But reaching the peak sixth segment is already unbelievably impressive! Most likely, nobody can break this record within a few thousand years!”

“Scarlet Drill Three Sons, with this, Qin Shitian really left them far behind in the dust!”

… …

Everyone was marveling in admiration. This result was seriously too monstrous.

Different from the Lucid Forest, what the Soul Controlling Avenue competed in was bona fide strength.

Qin Shitian challenging this assessment this time shocked the entire Nirvana Soul Hall!
