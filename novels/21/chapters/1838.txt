Chapter 1842 Who“s The Fool

Ye Yuan carried Leng Xu and passed through three streets according to the guidance of that person in the tavern. He turned into an alley.Along the way, Ye Yuan carrying a drunk man naturally attracted quite a few sidelong glances.

The corners of Little Tong’s mouth curled and he said disdainfully, “You this fellow, really a busybody!”

In the view of most martial artists, this kind of chance acquaintance relationship was not worth it.

Either way, playing there to spend the night drunk also would not kill anyone.

Moreover, that person even warned that the Leng Family was not too calm recently.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Just sending a drunk man home, a small thing.”

Little Tong rolled his eyes and did not make a sound.

Clearly, he was very disapproving of this.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Suddenly, two figures fell from the sky and blocked off Ye Yuan’s front and back exit routes.

The current Ye Yuan was equivalent to a turtle in a jar.

Little Tong had a helpless look as he said, “See, trouble came.”

However, his face did not have much worry.

But seeing the arrivals ahead, Ye Yuan’s face turned dark.

This person was precisely that man who told him about this path in the tavern.

The other person was also drinking with him.

That man had a smug look as he looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Brat, you’ve worked hard to support him over. Now, put the person down. Then you should leave.”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “You intentionally led me here? Turns out that the trouble you said was yourself.”

That man laughed loudly and said, “I took people’s money to help them avert a disaster. His trouble isn’t me. But if you were to insist on it, that’s fine too. Either way, he’s about to pass on right away.”

Once martial artists really got drunk, their divine soul was also in a paralyzed state, and was naturally clueless about the outside world’s danger.

Hence, if one was not really in a bad mood, they normally would not drink until like Leng Xu.

The current Leng Xu was equivalent to a lamb awaiting slaughter.

Ye Yuan looked at that man and said coolly, “Since that’s the case, you saying to let me leave is also to deliberately let me lower my guard, right? You’re very careful when doing things.”

The moment that man heard, he laughed loudly and said, “Boy, you’re very clever! But sadly, you’re not suited for the world of martial artists. This world is one where the weak are preys that the strong feasts on. Your kindheartedness won’t have a good outcome! In your next life, remember to be more cold-blooded, hahaha ...”

One should not be a busybody. A person should hold back when talking and doing things. This was general knowledge of the martial artist world.

But Ye Yuan did not seem to know this common sense at all.

Or should he say, he knew but was not willing to do it.

This kind of ‘fool’ would naturally die sooner or later.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “You’re so confident like you’ve already cornered me.”

That man said smugly, “Otherwise? You don’t think that you, a First Firmament Celestial Deity, can still stir up any waves, right? I urge that you’d better not wake Leng Xu. You won’t have this chance.”

This man was an initial-stage Third Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse. That man at the back was also a peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse.

Ye Yuan being a peak First Firmament Celestial Deity, they did not take him seriously at all.

“Fool!” Little Tong snorted coldly and scolded.

The moment that man heard, he burst out laughing and said, “Heard that? Even this little kid is scolding you stupid! If you died, then you died, you even had to harm this little brat to die together with you, truly sorrowful!”

Little Tong could not resist rolling his eyes, this guy was really dumb to the max, what kind of comprehension ability was this?!

Ye Yuan placed Leng Xu in a corner and said to Little Tong, “Look after him for a while. It will be over very soon.”

“Oh,” Little Tong said very casually and did not express much.

Finished talking, Ye Yuan turned to that man again and said, “Hey, ask you one more time. Is the Leng Family just after passing through this alley?”

That man was taken aback and immediately laughed loudly and said, “For what? You want to send him home even if you become a ghost? Tsk tsk, you, brat, are really loyal to friends, making me not bear to kill you.”

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Looks like still have to find somebody else to inquire. Also, the fool that Little Tong said just now was referring to the two of you, not me. Mn, I think that before you guys die, you should still understand that.”

That man was stunned again and had yet to understand what was going on when Ye Yuan’s figure already disappeared.

That man’s gaze turned intent and he said in horror, “Spatial law!”

The scent of death hit him head-on. He opened up world power straight away, planning to use world power to feel Ye Yuan’s position.

But, it was all futile.

Puchi ...

A sword poked out of the void silently, directly swiping his throat. Fresh blood gushed out, his eyes began to turn lax.

Only at this time did he understand what kind of terrifying opponent he had provoked.

When the man opposite saw this scene, his face turned deathly pale.

Without the slightest hesitation, his figure fled into the void, wanting to escape this alley at once.

It was just too bad that in front of the Fourth Firmament spatial law Ye Yuan, this kind of escape appeared feeble and powerless.

Puchi!

Another sword, a peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse fell!

Inside the heart of the void realm, three years of enlightenment on Dao, Ye Yuan’s realm made tremendous progress in the first place.

Drifting inside the space for ten years, Ye Yuan’s realm had already reached peak First Firmament Celestial Deity.

Coupled with Fourth Firmament spatial law and middle-stage Fifth Firmament Sword Dao laws, his strength was god knows how many times stronger than during the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave.

Initial-stage Third Firmament Celestial Deity, if not an existence with exceedingly high law comprehensions, they posed not the slightest bit of threat towards Ye Yuan.

Very sadly, this man was not.

Killing them was similarly a matter of lifting a finger.

Seeing this scene, Little Tong’s gaze turned sharp.

“This boy’s strength improved again! This guy doesn’t know what’s called bottleneck at all!”

These few years, Little Tong had also witnessed Ye Yuan’s improvement.

In a short decade, Ye Yuan’s improvement could practically be seen with the naked eye.

Too fast!

Even he, this Empyrean powerhouse, also sighed with admiration at Ye Yuan’s talent.

Ye Yuan helped Leng Xu up again and said helplessly, “Isn’t this guy the Leng Family’s young patriarch? Why did he end up in this plight? Casually finding a Third Firmament Celestial Deity and he could take his life.”

Little Tong pursed his lips and said, “In prominent families, brothers fighting among themselves is all too normal. What’s the big fuss?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “That’s true too, come on.”

The Leng Family’s address was not hard to inquire, casually inquiring and one would know.

Actually, the place where that man pointed to was not far from the Leng Family. It was just that there was no need to pass through this alley.

This alley was the place to kill that they meticulously arranged. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was just a pity that their strength was lacking. They were killed instead.

Ye Yuan arrived in front of the Leng Manor’s front door, and just happened to bump into a young man.

The moment that youth saw Leng Xu, his expression could not help changing drastically.

He took Leng Xu from Ye Yuan’s hands and berated Ye Yuan, “Young Brother Xu, why did you drink until like this? Who are you people? What did you do to Younger Brother Xu? Come, men! Capture these two villains for me!”
