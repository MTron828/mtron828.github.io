Chapter 1630 Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain

zheng qi, ning tianping, and heavenly eagle imperial city’s powerhouses looked toward ka suo, each and every one of their eyes spewing fire.

ye yuan was heavenly eagle imperial city’s future, but he was actually killed by another person just like that!

they dared to get angry but did not dare to speak.

ka suo was too strong!

if not looking on account of song yu’s face, ka suo would probably exterminate them together as well.

killing ye yuan was one thing, killing zheng qi them all were another matter.

this point, ka suo understood it. so he did not make a move.

“already resolved the little bug, so let’s go,” ka suo said indifferently as if having done a very ordinary thing.

song yu two people nodded their heads and moved forward together with ka suo.

the three people bombarded wildly along the way, blasting the absolute magnetism black tortoise until it was utterly routed, not having the strength to retaliate at all.

however, this absolute magnetism black tortoise’s defense was really powerful. no matter how they bombarded, it would not die.

those divine lord realm powerhouses were all incredibly stunned from watching and had a direct visual understanding of a celestial deity realm powerhouse.

celestial deity realm powerhouses were seriously too strong.

even if their cultivation was suppressed, they were still so powerful, and could even fly in the air still.

very soon, the three people vanished from everyone’s line of sight.

the expression on gao yuan’s face was very conflicted. hesitating for a bit, his figure moved, speeding over toward the depths of the canyon.

some people shrink back and just took no action altogether. they started meditating on the spot.

“head elder, what should we do?” ning tianping asked zheng qi.

zheng qi had a sorrowful look as he said, “i let ye yuan down! i shouldn’t have dragged him into the water! now ... what to do now?”

ning tianping also said, “head elder, this matter isn’t your fault, it’s all that fiend!”

zheng qi gritted his teeth and said, “i hate it! master’s enemy is right in front of me, but i’m powerless to take revenge! now, ye yuan was killed in my presence and i also don’t have the ability to take revenge for him! i ... i’m too useless!”

heavenly eagle’s people all had rueful looks, deeply feeling the same.

everyone all did not detect a speck of dust flying lightly by them, drifting over towards the depths of the canyon.

...

three figures flew toward the depths of the canyon.

“that kid just now, there are likely quite a few secrets on him. dying is somewhat a pity,” song yu said.

“that’s of course! that kid could disguise as a fiend and not be discovered by people, and can even attract great dao heavenly melody. now, he also comprehended spatial laws, how can there possibly be no secrets on him?” ka suo said.

“then you killed him just like that?” song yu said.

“otherwise? will you watch me take him away before your eyes?” ka suo answered with a question.

“that’s naturally impossible!” song yu said with a smile.

“then isn’t that enough! this kind of latent danger, best to die earlier! although i covet the secrets on him, i cherish my life more. perhaps i don’t need to wait for him to reach celestial deity realm and he’d have the ability to come and find me,” ka suo’s eyes narrowed slightly as he said.

clearly, the talent that ye yuan displayed already made him feel scared.

actually, ka suo also did not expect to be able to run into ye yuan here.

the few of them had been following behind the battalion all the way and took their situation into their sights.

when heavenstar and di en exposed ye yuan’s identity, ka suo became alert.

the commotion that ye yuan caused back then at the fiend race was too big. the blood yama hall also told ka suo the matter of ye yuan inquiring about information for the first time ever.

but source night this identity was clearly a fake identity, ka suo had nowhere to start searching too.

all the way until today, in an accident arising from many causes, he actually ran into ye yuan.

if it was merely like this, forget it. but the heaven-defying talent that ye yuan displayed along the way made ka suo really frightened.

origin deity realm and he could rival five great first-layered heaven divine lord powerhouses. allow him to carry on developing, how could that do?”

what was even more damnable was that ye yuan’s cultivation speed was too fast.

at the current rate of cultivation speed, him breaking through to celestial deity realm was also right around the corner!

this kind of latent threat, ka suo did not dare to allow it to grow unchecked.

since he encountered it this time, he naturally had to kill him in the cradle.

song yu just nodded his head. he understood ka suo’s action very well.

if it were him, he would also do the same.

song yu’s eyes swiveled and he said with a smile that was not a smile, “there are a few little tails following behind!”

ka suo said disdainfully, “just a few small fries. they can’t stir up any waves. if they aren’t sensible, eliminate them directly.”

song yu smiled and said, “these fools always overestimate their own ability, thinking that they can get some petty gains. but getting petty gains will cost their lives!”

suddenly, the three people’s expressions changed. a powerful forcefield pressed over.

the three people’s figures suddenly sunk and could no longer stabilize their figures, falling straight down.

after the surprise, the three people’s faces revealed a look of wild ecstasy.

“looks like it’s not far away! this kind of undulation is at least xiantian celestial deity mystic treasure!” ka suo said excitedly.

song yu’s face also revealed wild elation as he said, “it’s absolutely a xiantian celestial deity mystic treasure!”

after the ecstasy, the relationship between the three people immediately became delicate.

a strange atmosphere started spreading between the three.

the calm and collected appearance from before immediately turned into vigilance.

swoosh!

song yu was young in the end and finally could not resist moving.

ka suo laughed sinisterly and suddenly attacked.

at this time, lei yi wanted to take advantage of the two people’s fight and secretly sneak in.

however, how could the other two do as he wished, and actually both blasted over towards him?

for some time, the three people clashed together, tangled into a mess.

the great battle of three great half-step celestial deity powerhouses, that battle situation was truly earth-shaking.

but the three people’s strengths were not much different, nobody could do anything to the other.

bang! bang! bang!

the clash of powerful world power shook until debris flew everywhere.

the three people swept forward as they fought.

suddenly, rays of faint light halos came over ahead. the three people only felt a tremendous pressure, their movements also stagnated significantly.

far away, a dark hill was upright on a platform, emitting an undulation that shook the soul.

that powerful forcefield was emitted by precisely this small hill!

“origin magnetic divine light! that ... that’s an origin magnetic divine mountain! hahaha ... this place actually gave birth to an origin magnetic divine mountain! with an origin magnetic divine mountain, this seat’s strength will definitely advance greatly!” song yu said frenziedly.

the other two people also had heated faces. ka suo laughed coldly and said, “you’re thinking too much! this origin magnetic divine mountain, this old man is determined to get it!”

lei yi said in a cold voice, “you all can stop thinking, the origin magnetic divine mountain is mine!”

ka suo laughed loudly and said, “then let’s showcase our true abilities then!”

this origin magnetic divine mountain was clearly outside of the three people’s expectations, making the three of them incomparably excited.

seeing the main thing, the three people no longer held back, each flashing out big moves. the battle situation became more intense.

it was just that reaching here, it was hard for them to advance forward an inch anymore. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

these three people all had their own little schemes. nobody was willing to let the other party gain an advantage.

far away, amidst the rugged rocks, gao yuan cleverly concealed his figure, the expression on his face flickered incessantly.

he was a wild wolf, with sufficient patience. he was quietly waiting for the chance.

this was his greatest hope of breaking through to the celestial deity realm. he did not wish to miss it!
