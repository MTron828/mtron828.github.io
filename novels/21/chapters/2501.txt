Chapter 2507: Despair and Hope!

Ye Yuan’s body was trembling slightly, his breathing becoming rapid.

The Sacred Ancestor High Priest who was by the side, it was still his first time seeing Ye Yuan so nervous.

It could be seen what weight of this woman whose life and death situation was unknown had in Ye Yuan’s heart.

One dark green light halo after another emitted from Mu Lingxue’s body.

Ye Yuan carefully guided the power of the Tear of Life with the power of his divine soul, entering Mu Lingxue’s sea of consciousness.

There was only a trace of spiritual consciousness remaining!

Ye Yuan forced himself to calm down, there was no room for the slightest error at this time.

This final trace of spiritual consciousness could not withstand any accidents!

It was also Ye Yuan’s first time seeing the Tear of Life. Even he was extremely amazed by the vast aura of life inside.

This aura of life was extremely complex and profound, seemingly containing the Great Dao of Life and Death inside.

There was a myriad of Great Dao. The Great Dao of Life and Death was also one of them.

Furthermore, it was an extremely profound one.

Ye Yuan had cultivated the Nirvana Seal’s Life and Death Seal before and had a rather profound understanding of Life and Death Dao’s attainments.

But, even if he was presently revered as Heavenspan World’s number one person, he could not penetrate the secrets of life and death too.

People were the most, most complex things in this world to begin with.

In front of the Great Dao of heaven and earth, people were insignificant like a drop in the ocean.

But people themselves were also akin to a complicated and sophisticated instrument, running continuously.

Logically speaking, everyone was within the operations of Heavenly Dao.

Everyone’s life trajectory should also have been configured already.

But Ye Yuan had gone through so much and had long already seen through a lot. The destiny of people could not be controlled by Heavenly Dao at all.

Just like … himself!

He had discussed his life with Profound Secrets before and could confirm that his heaven-defying rise was absolutely not within the operation of Heavenly Dao.

He broke free from Heavenly Dao’s control!

Ye Yuan could also confirm that the Heavenspan World’s current situation already broke out of the control of Heavenly Dao too.

Ye Yuan had a feeling that even if one grasped Life and Death rule, they would not be able to truly see through life and death too!

The Tear of Life contained the maxim of life!

Feeling this power, Ye Yuan felt a bit more confident out of thin air.

Under Ye Yuan’s control, the power of life seemed to be like the spring rain, watering the weak spiritual consciousness.

Time slowly trickled by. But Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness did not show the slightest signs of strengthening.

After several devastations, Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness was already too weak.

The power of life was unable to enter Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness at all.

Ye Yuan could not help feeling a little more fretful in his heart.

But he did not dare to be the least bit neglectful.

Every pore on his body from head to toe became tense.

One day!

Two days!

… …

A month later, just as Ye Yuan already completely despaired, that trace of spiritual consciousness suddenly grew stronger.

Although it was only a little bit, Ye Yuan could see it clearly!

This trace of change made Ye Yuan ecstatic!

In this one month, Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness was immersed in the power of life.

Finally, there was a slight improvement!

With a trace, there was a second trace!

Ye Yuan believed without a shadow of a doubt!

Sure enough, in the following time, this trace of spiritual consciousness became stronger and stronger, increasingly stronger.

Ye Yuan’s heart was practically leaping out of his throat.

He was too exhilarated!

Experiencing untold hardships and turning the Heavenspan World upside down, what did he do it for?

To become the Heavenspan World’s number one person?

To be admired by millions of people?

For that eternal name?

No!

He only did it for Mu Lingxue!

That strange woman with an ice-cold outer appearance, but dared to love and hate!

Now, he finally did it!

Mu Lingxue’s spiritual consciousness was continuously strengthening.

From feeble and dim in the beginning, to solid, and then turning into like clusters of flames.

“Ugh?…”

Finally, Mu Lingxue let out a soft murmur.

This sound was very light, soft until it was almost inaudible.

But when it entered Ye Yuan’s ears, it was more beautiful than any music in the world!

“Lingxue! Can you hear? Lingxue! I … I’m Ji Qingyun!” Ye Yuan completely forgot about himself and did not notice the tremor in his own voice at all.

However, there was no response.

After this sound, there was no more sound.

And right at this moment, the light halo on Mu Lingxue’s body dissipated with a loud bang.

The Tear of Life also shattered with a loud bang at this moment.

“No! Don’t!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed wildly, desperately wanting to gather those fragments.

But everything was futile!

Those fragments gradually dissipated, returning to heaven and earth.

Ye Yuan’s entire person was stupefied, instantly falling from great joy into great sorrow.

“Lingxue! W-Wake up! D-Don’t scare me! I carried endless hope, that’s how I walked until today, d-don’t shatter all of my hopes!”

Talking until the back, Ye Yuan was practically saying it while crying.

These thousands of years, it was the Tear of Life that supported Ye Yuan to come this far.

But now, the cruel reality told him that the Tear of Life could not save Mu Lingxue too.

This despair of shattered hope directly broke Ye Yuan.

“Lingxue, don’t be like this!”

“Y-You give me a response, okay?”

“I know. You’re just pretending to sleep …”

Ye Yuan’s voice became weaker and weaker. Until the end, the sound of a needle dropping could be heard.

His face dried up after being wet with tears and turned wet again after drying, no idea how many times already.

He was unable to deceive himself anymore too.

He knew that he really failed! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

But he was not reconciled to it!

How he hoped that all this was a scam!

By the side, Profound Secrets and Sacred Ancestor High Priest were both visibly moved.

They had never seen such behavior before from Ye Yuan!

Only all the way until now did they understand that Ye Yuan walked until today step by step for this mortal woman in his arms!

At present, Ye Yuan was already revered as supreme.

But his feelings for this mortal woman never changed in the least bit.

To a martial artist, there could be many women in their lives.

Along with the increase in their strength and status, their mentality would undergo massive changes.

How could a mortal match up to the Heavenspan’s sovereign?

How could her life or death be worthy of the Sovereign being so heartbroken?

This was a strange man who was most affectionate and sincere!

“Ye Yuan, m-maybe … there’s still hope! After all, the Tear of Life had an effect, right? One Tear of Life can’t. Then we can find more Tears of Life!” Wing hesitated for a bit but still urged.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes were vacant without any spirit as he said, “You don’t need to comfort me anymore! You and I are both Dao pill powerhouses. It’s very clear whether the Tear of Life was useful or not!”

Spiritual consciousness was just a wisp of consciousness.

This wisp of consciousness became stronger under the nourishment of the Tear of Life.

Spiritual consciousness became stronger, but the divine soul did not show the slightest sign of recovery!

This was the crux!

Mu Lingxue’s divine soul had long already dissipated. There was only this strand of spiritual consciousness left that was not extinguished.

Ye Yuan had always been waiting, waiting for the Tear of Life to be able to let this wisp of spiritual consciousness re-condense its divine soul.

But no!

There was not the slightest trace of anything!

His despair did not lay with the Tear of Life shattering, but it lay here!

Without the divine soul, it was useless no matter how strong the spiritual consciousness was.

Wing’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Ye Yuan, didn’t your divine essence already become a chaos origin divinity? This shows that the divine essence still has a higher level form! Maybe … there’s still a way?”

Ye Yuan’s body shook fiercely, the hollow eyes gradually recovering a bit of light!

“Right! Y-You’re right! That fellow might know something! I can’t give up hope!” Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said.

His eyes recovered their resolution once again!
