Chapter 1946: Lurking

Five Ghosts Open Gate was the true god mystic treasure that Mo Qing sanctified.

Even if it was inferior to the long spear in Bai Chen’s hand, it absolutely could not be shattered by one punch too.

Sixth transformation golden body martial artists, just the fleshy body was comparable to mystic treasures. But to say shattering with one punch, that was absolutely impossible.

But what was going on with this fellow in front of him?

This young man before his eyes was not to be trifled with!

Swoosh!

How could Mo Qing still dare to stay? He turned around and ran, his figure instantly shuttling into the void.

But his figure had just moved when a figure blocked in front of him.

It was precisely Ye Yuan!

Mo Qing’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “S-Spatial shift! Who ... Who on earth are you?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said calmly, “You came to find me. Didn’t you inquire about who I am?”

Mo Qing had a panic-stricken face, gritted his teeth, and said, “I’m a member of the Deathsoul Gate! If you dare to kill me, it’s becoming enemies with the Deathsoul Gate!”

“Deathsoul Gate? Never heard before! Die.”

Ye Yuan slammed a fist out calmly, the entire space solidified.

Even if Mo Qing wanted to escape, he could not escape either.

His world power, his protective divine essence, could not even block for a moment under this one punch, directly collapsing.

Bang!

Mo Qing’s entire person directly exploded, turning into a burst of blood rain.

A peak First Firmament True God powerhouse directly died under Ye Yuan’s one punch.

“So strong! A peak First Firmament True God powerhouse, Lord Ye Yuan crushed him with one punch!”

“He didn’t employ any divine essence. This should be the power of the fleshy body. Lord Ye Yuan should have broken through to the sixth transformation golden body!”

“But is a sixth transformation golden body so strong? Those skulls should be a true god mystic treasure, right? His Excellency shattered them with one punch, truly terrifying!”

...

Everyone looked at how Ye Yuan was like a god of war, all shocked until they could not close their mouths.

In just a short few years of closed-seclusion, the moment he came out, he disposed of a True God powerhouse.

Indeed well-deserving of being Lord Ye Yuan!

Looking at his fist, Ye Yuan was rather satisfied.

“Possessing this kind of power, these few years of suffering was also not in vain.”

These six nirvanic tribulations, Ye Yuan took eight years to transcend them.

During these eight years, Ye Yuan walked along the borders of life and death every minute and second.

That feeling was akin to touring the 18 levels of hell, the blade mountain, fire sea, oil bath, so on and so forth.

This kind of torment, Ye Yuan’s scalp still tingled when he recalled it now.

He also finally understood why the dragon race’s founding ancestor would seal these memories to after rank five.

Nirvanic tribulation was really not what ordinary people could transcend.

Especially the last one, the sixth nirvanic tribulation, Ye Yuan almost could not endure it quite a number of times.

In the end, he still relied on powerful willpower and forcibly held out.

“Ye Yuan, you were a little impulsive this time. The Deathsoul Gate is famed for being hard to entangle with in the Heavenspan World, specialized in doing some murder and arson acts, and is also the Heavenspan World’s largest assassin organization. This faction’s powerhouses are countless and have already existed for god knows how many years. Furthermore, it’s said that its creator was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. You killed a member of the Deathsoul Gate now, so you have to be careful of their revenge,” Dustless warned.

When Ye Yuan heard that, his brows also furrowed slightly.

He had really never heard of Deathsoul Gate this name before, but hearing the meaning in Dustless’s words, he had no choice but to guard against.

Originally planned on making use of the Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill to earn more money, but did not expect to cause such a storm.

However, even if he knew the Deathsoul Gate’s prowess, it was also absolutely impossible to let Mo Qing leave.

“I got it. Looks like we still have to make some preparations,” Ye Yuan said.

...

Inside a hidden chamber underground of an inn in Nine Pledge Imperial Capital, more than a dozen black lotuses were placed.

Suddenly, a black lotus right at the end suddenly fell apart.

The black shadow inside the secret chamber was abruptly startled and muttered to himself, “Mo Qing actually died? Shouldn’t be! Heavenly Eagle Imperial City only has a newly-ascended True God Realm, so how can he possibly be Mo Qing’s match? Even if he’s really not a match, it’s also impossible to not even be able to escape, right?”

No one would have thought that this inconspicuous little inn was actually a branch of the Deathsoul Gate.

And those dozen over black lotuses represented more than a dozen True God Realm powerhouses.

If City Lord Yu Wenfeng knew that there were actually so many True God powerhouses under his rule, he would definitely be uneasy even when sleeping.

The black shadow paced back and forth. Suddenly, the seals in his hand changed erratically, finally turning into several streaks of black threads, concealing into the void.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Very soon, several figures flew into the underground secret chamber.

“Chief!”

After the few people entered, they bowed down towards that black shadow.

The black shadow sat down, made a sound of acknowledgement, and said, “A mission came from upstairs, saying that we must capture the Southridge Patrolling Inspector Ye Yuan alive. I sent Mo Qing over, but ... he died!”

“Mo Qing this fool, he had always thought of himself as infallible. Dying was also a matter of time,” one of the people said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Another person said, “Your Excellency calling us here, could it be to have us take action together?”

The black shadow said coolly, “Yes, Ye Yuan this boy can’t be underestimated, he always has unexpected means. This time, the five of you go together, Lu Xin assumes personal command, the four of you join hands. Additionally, bring over Traceless Spatial Lock. This boy’s spatial law is remarkable, you all have to ensure that it cannot fail under any circumstances before you can take action, understood?”

When the five people heard that, they were all extremely surprised.

Lu Xin frowned and said, “Your Excellency, it’s just capturing a puny little Celestial Deity Realm. Isn’t it making a mountain out of a mole hill? Even without using Traceless Spatial Lock, the five of us joining hands, could it be that he could still escape?”

The black shadow waved his hand and said, “This is the person that the people upstairs want. So matter how highly we regard him, it’s not over the top. Furthermore, Mo Qing is already dead. To be able to kill off a True God Realm without a sound, it’s hard to guarantee that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City doesn’t have any contingencies. Once any slip-ups occur, you and I can’t shoulder it! Do it according to my words, if you fail, carry your head back to see me!”

The five people were slightly fearful in their hearts and no longer dared to be negligent.

“Yes, Your Excellency!”

...

The five people receiving the mission, broke it down into its elements, and quietly sneaked into Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

The Deathsoul Gate’s disguising and concealing techniques were extremely skillful. On the surface, Lu Xin five people were merely very ordinary Divine Lord Realm martial artists.

The present Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, Divine Lord Realm martial artists were everywhere on the streets, it was nothing at all.

The five people were extremely patient. This lurk became half a year long.

On this day, the five people gathered together in an unassuming commoner’s residence.

Upon entering the door, one of the assassins, Xu Mao, said unhappily, “Mo Qing was really a stupid pig, acting rashly and alerting the enemy. Now, just great! That kid doesn’t leave the City Lord Manor at all. We can’t find the opportunity to act at all!”

Inside the City Lord Manor would normally be laid down with a lot of restrictions.

Even people very skillful in spatial law would also find it very hard to sneak inside without a sound.

The few people were veteran assassins. But Ye Yuan huddling up in his shell like a turtle, they could not do anything either.

“Alright, he’s already dead. What’s the use of you complaining about him? But, this Ye Yuan kid is truly incredible, to actually be able to develop such a heaven-defying medicinal pill. It’s also no wonder that the people upstairs want to capture him alive,” said another assassin.

At this time, the Lu Xin who was silent all along opened his mouth and said, “Since he’s not coming out, then we’ll go in.”
