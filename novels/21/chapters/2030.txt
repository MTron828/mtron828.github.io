Chapter 2034: Astonishing the World With a Single Brilliant Feat!

In past years, the sparrings between Empyreans were all carried out during the Peak Alchemy Meet.

These young geniuses did not have the chance to see Seven-star Alchemy God take action at all.

But today, five great Seven-star Alchemy Gods were in sync and took action at the same time. How powerful were the power and pressure?

Furthermore, what these few Seven-star Alchemy Gods were currently refining were all rank six divine pills. This was simply a textbook-like performance to those young Six-star Alchemy Gods.

Seven-star Alchemy Gods refining rank six divine pills was undoubtedly using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken.

In the view of these juniors who had never seen Seven-star Alchemy Gods take action before, it was naturally incredibly shocking.

“No matter how strong Ye Yuan is, it’s also impossible to block the teamwork of five Seven-star Alchemy Gods, right? This guy is too arrogant!”

Seeing five great Empyreans take action, everyone shook their heads one after another.

The current Ye Yuan was already like a clown in their hearts.

When Empyrean Wenlan saw the situation, he said with a big laugh, “Huhu, Brother Flutterfeather, you probably miscalculated this time, right? No matter how strong this kid is, how can he possibly defeat five great Seven-star Alchemy Gods?”

Empyrean Flutterfeather just smiled and did not speak. One completely could not see worry from his face.

Sensing the five Alchemy Dao auras that could topple mountains and overturn the seas, Ye Yuan just laughed coldly. Forming a seal with his hand, a boundless aura rose to the sky like a rocket directly from between the gaps of the five great Empyreans.

Everyone’s faces immediately changed drastically!

The moment this aura appeared, it immediately made the five great Empyreans’ aura pale in comparison.

That dazzling light forced everyone until they could not open their eyes.

If the five great Empyreans’ auras were likened to stars, Ye Yuan’s aura currently was the sun!

Under the illumination of the sun, all stars lost their luster.

Only I alone reign supreme!

“What a powerful aura! It turns out that a Six-star Alchemy God can do it to this extent?”

“Too terrifying! To actually overwhelm five great Seven-star Alchemy Gods with Six-star Alchemy God strength, just what realm is Ye Yuan? Middle-stage Dao Realm? Late-stage?”

“How is this possible? How can a Six-star Alchemy God be so strong?”

...

On the plaza, cries of exclamations linked up together.

The Six-star Alchemy Gods here were no less than ten thousand people. Each one of them had a standard for the limits of Six-star Alchemy Gods in their hearts.

But the current Ye Yuan completely shattered all of their benchmarks, subverting all of their understanding. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It turned out that Six-star Alchemy Gods could be so strong!

In the crowd, Yun Yi looked at that dazzling figure, with his face full of bitterness.

“We were all wrong! Turns out that he wasn’t posturing, but that he really finds us beneath contempt. Although we’re all Six-star Alchemy Gods, we don’t have the qualifications to challenge him at all!”

Only at this moment did Yun Yi finally understand that all of Ye Yuan’s arrogance previously was just illustrating an all too normal thing.

Ye Yuan eyes no longer had those in the same generation long ago.

Those able to exchange blows with him were only Seven-star Alchemy Gods. Furthermore, they were peak existences among Seven-star Alchemy Gods!

Since that was the case, their provocation naturally appeared laughable.

Would an Empyrean powerhouse mind a Celestial Deity Realm’s provocation?

What difference was that sort of provocation from a naughty child pointing an adult in the face and saying, I want to defeat you?

As for Luo Yue and the rest, each and every one of them was shocked until it could not be any greater.

They had witnessed before Ning Siyu’s Alchemy Dao and were utterly defeated at her hands until they were black and blue.

At that time, they thought that Ning Siyu was a rare alchemy talent.

But placing Ning Siyu in front of Ye Yuan, that was not on the same level at all!

No wonder even with Ning Siyu’s exceptional talent, she had to be so respectful and submissive in front of Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength was sufficient to crush the majority of Seven-star Alchemy Gods.

Empyrean Pilljade, Empyrean Pilljade, Empyrean Lumen, Empyrean Chaoyuan, and the rest were all radiating brilliance in their gazes at this time.

Clearly, they were astounded by Ye Yuan’s breathtaking debut.

This was Ye Yuan’s first time taking action in the Cloudpill Summit. But it carved an indelible impression in the people’s minds.

The five great Empyrean’s faces changed drastically, a never before sense of oppression made them instantly have many mistakes appear.

When experts exchanged blows, victory and defeat lied in just millimeters.

This tiny bit of mistake already determined the conclusion.

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, he established his victory!

Of course, Empyrean Longyi and the rest were not ordinary people. Even when suppressed, they were still not defeated.

It was just a pity that defeat was already set!

The five great Empyreans could only eke out a meager existence under Ye Yuan’s powerful pressure.

After more than two hours, Ye Yuan pulled back, the pill formed!

But the others were still struggling bitterly.

Ye Yuan looked at the five great Empyreans calmly. After he withdrew, the five great Empyreans finally recovered strength. After an hour, they completed the refinement.

Except, no one paid attention to them anymore.

Everyone’s gazes were gathered on Ye Yuan.

Astonishing the world with a single brilliant feat!

Before this, no one could have thought that Ye Yuan had the strength to compete with Seven-star Alchemy Gods.

His words were ignorant, was arrogant, was unreasonable, in everyone’s eyes.

But only now did they know that turns out that was merely Ye Yuan accurately stating his own strength!

Even if someone chose to believe Ye Yuan, it was also impossible for them to expect that Ye Yuan would defeat five great Seven-star Alchemy Gods in a crushing manner.

“Too incredible! Really too impressive! A thousand over years old young man, how can his alchemy strength be so strong?”

“Seven-star Alchemy God! Those are Seven-star Alchemy Gods! Furthermore, it’s even five of them. They were defeated just like this?”

“Just based on this fight, who dares to say that he doesn’t have the qualifications to sit on the grandmaster seat?”

...

Ye Yuan making his move shocked the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world.

Starting from today, Seven-star Alchemy Gods were not undefeatable!

About to open the furnace, everyone held their breaths.

“Ye Yuan, purple spirit divine-grade!”

“Empyrean Longyi, peak superior-grade!”

“Empyrean Pingao, superior-grade!”

...

A grandmaster opened the furnaces of Ye Yuan and the others. Apart from Empyrean Longyi reaching peak superior-grade, the others were all only ordinary superior-grade, without even a heaven-grade.

Seven-star Alchemy Gods refining rank six divine pills, with the strength of Empyrean Longyi and the rest, heaven-grade was the minimum requirement.

Even divine-grade was nothing difficult to them too.

But they were suppressed firmly by Ye Yuan and could not even break through to heaven-grade.

The expression on Empyrean Longyi’s face was extremely ugly. He just gave a cold snort and returned to his seat.

He currently felt that his face was already utterly lost. He was actually suppressed by a Six-star Alchemy God to such a degree.

“Huhu, no wonder you could make Empyrean Flutterfeather view you in a different light. Grandmaster Ye’s strength indeed can’t be underestimated. However ... want to sit in the position of grandmaster just based on this, it’s still not enough!”

On the Empyrean seats, Empyrean Wenlan said dripping with sarcasm.

Ye Yuan’s situation, he could naturally do it and even do it better than Ye Yuan.

After all, the alchemy strength of Empyrean Longyi and the others could only be considered below-average among these 100 Empyreans.

But his words were still leaking a sour flavor.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s strength far exceeded everyone’s imagination.
