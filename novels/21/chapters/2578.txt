Chapter 2584: Well Killed!

“This matter is huge! It’s already not what I can handle! I’ll report it to the sect master to handle this matter personally!” Protector Mo said in a solemn voice.

No matter what, Ye Yuan this green-wing protector was real.

The rank was even above his.

Ye Yuan said indifferently, “Anything then.”

Protector Mo said in a loud voice, “The entrance assessment is suspended! After I report this matter to Martial Uncle Sect Master, I’ll make a decision again!”

His voice had yet to fade when a terrifying aura suddenly descended.

An old man dressed in black clothes arrived from the horizon with a howl, his arrogance billowing to the sky!

“Who killed this old man’s disciple!” The thunderous voice shook until everyone almost could not stand firm.

“Elder Shi!”

“Master!”

Protector Mo and Han Qianyu exclaimed at the same time.

This person was precisely Lu Zhanyuan and Han Qianyun’s master, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s Jade Sovereign Heaven elder, Shi Feiyu!

The moment a Jade Sovereign Heaven appeared, everyone was suppressed until they found it hard to breathe.

Too strong!

The black-clothed old man landed on the ground. Looking at Lu Zhanyuan’s dead body, he was beyond furious.

“Qianyun, who killed Zhanyuan?” Shi Feiyu said angrily.

Han Qianyun pointed at Ye Yuan and said, “It’s him!”

Shi Feiyu could not help being taken aback and said, “Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum? Just the likes of him can kill Zhanyuan? Could it be that he’s a peerless genius that’s hard to come across in a million years?”

Han Qianyun’s expression was ugly as he said awkwardly, “No, he … has a lower-inferior aptitude! Furthermore, his affinity is only four points! However, his means of using poison has reached the acme of perfection. Junior Apprentice Brother was suddenly caught off-guard and was paralyzed by him using Windward Topple.”

Shi Feiyu’s gaze turned grim and he said in a cold voice, “Then what are you doing? Why haven’t you avenged your Junior Apprentice Brother?”

Han Qianyun said with a bitter smile, “Senior Apprentice Brother Luo gave him the green-wing token! His brat is now a green-wing protector!”

“What? Nonsense! Luo Yunqing this punk is becoming wilder and wilder these few years! Giving the green-wing token to a Luo Yunqing Heavenly Stratum, and he’s even lower-inferior aptitude, what is he trying to do?”

Shi Feiyu was extremely enraged. The others were all silent like cicadas in winter.

The deterrence of a Jade Sovereign Heaven was seriously too strong!

“No need to care about him! Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, lower-inferior aptitude, he isn’t worthy to possess the green-wing token at all! Qianyun, do it!”

Shi Feiyu was unparalleled and domineering. He could not be bothered to say anything at all, directly sentencing Ye Yuan to death!

Even if it was the green-wing token, he did not think anything of it either.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned chilly, and he said with a sneer, “Your esteemed self is so awe-inspiring!”

Shi Feiyu’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Boy, you dare to talk to this old man like this?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing as he said, “Why? You already want to kill me. Could it be that you still want this Ye to be overflowing with gratitude towards you? Did your head spoil from your advanced age too?”

“Hiss …”

The sound of a series of cold air being drawn came from all around, this guy was really crazy!

That was a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

“Huhu,?a newborn calf really doesn’t fear the tiger! Do you think that with Luo Yunqing backing you up, you can act recklessly without caring for nobody? Let me tell you. He’s nothing in front of this old man! You played tricks and killed Zhanyuan. So you’ll have to pay for it with your life!” Shi Feiyu said with a cold smile.

As a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, every action and movement of Shi Feiyu’s brought tremendous pressure on these Lesser Sublime Heavens.

When he talked about killing people, everyone was practically about to faint.

“Oh,?is that so? Martial Uncle Shi is really getting more and more overbearing! You can even kill green-wing protectors without authorization now?” Right at this time, a leisurely voice sounded out.

Han Qianyun and Protector Mo’s expressions changed and they cried out in surprise, “Luo Yunqing!”

It was only to see a person walk out with a sword behind his back. Who could it be if not the Jade Face Swordsman, Luo Yunqing?

Seeing Luo Yunqing return, Ye Yuan also let out a long sigh in relief.

The pressure that a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse brought to him was seriously too great!

Shi Feiyu’s gaze turned dark and he said in a cold voice,?“Humph!?As an elder, could it be that this old man can’t even sentence a …?mn??You … You broke through?”

Shi Feiyu spoke halfway when he suddenly discovered that Luo Yunqing’s aura was not quite right!

It had clearly already surpassed Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum and reached Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum!

This shock was by no means insignificant!

Luo Yunqing smiled lightly and said, “In this one year, I challenged 12 branches of the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect in a row and fought with 28 Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses one after another, narrowly escaping with my life many times, killing six Jadetrue Heavenly Sect protectors. I finally pierced through this layer of windowpane paper!”

Limitless Sublime Heaven to Jade Sovereign Heaven was a massive ridge.

Even if Luo Yunqing was peerlessly talented, he was stuck for many years too.

The matter of sneak attacking Green Bull Town this time completely enraged Luo Yunqing.

He killed Jadetrue Sect’s people until they were utterly routed with his power alone!

But he did not expect that under the fierce fighting, he actually broke the shackles and broke through this huge threshold!

Shi Feiyu’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He did not like Luo Yunqing’s arrogance and stubbornness to begin with and suppressed him a lot.

But he did not expect that this punk actually broke through to Jade Sovereign Heaven now and is on an equal footing with him now!

“Congratulations, Senior Luo!” Ye Yuan said sincerely.

Actually, if not because of Luo Yunqing, Ye Yuan might have gone straight down the mountain previously. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Whatever green-wing protector, Ye Yuan did not care at all.

He had his own pride.

It was just that Luo Yunqing laid low in Eastward Country for ten years in order to solicit him.

If he left here and now, it was letting down Luo Yunqing’s high regard too much.

Luo Yunqing laughed loudly and said, “Speaking of which, I still have to thank you, Brother Ye! If not for you giving me those few things, I might really have not been able to come back this time! Let alone talk about breaking through to Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum!”

Luo Yunqing went too overboard this time, virtually inciting the entire Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s strength.

The Jadetrue Heavenly Sect even mobilized Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, wanting to cut him down.

It was just a shame that Luo Yunqing’s movements and traces were elusive and secretive, one person fighting as a guerrilla, leaving them nowhere to start.

But even so, facing so many same rank powerhouses, Luo Yunqing also narrowly escaped death many times.

Although those few toys that Ye Yuan threw to him did not have much effect on Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratums, they indeed had unexpected effects.

Just like Windward Topple, it only needed to paralyze that tiny bit at the crucial moment.

Facing an expert like Luo Yunqing, it was absolutely fatal!

The two people’s conversation was akin to a clap of thunder to the ears of the bystanders.

Luo Yunqing who already broke through to Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum actually addressed Ye Yuan as his brother!

It seemed like this green-wing token was really not anyhow given!

It was just that what right did a lower-inferior aptitude fellow have to make him being regarded so highly?

Just based on him being able to defeat Lu Zhanyuan at the same rank?

Not enough, right?

“Brother Ye, don’t call me Senior Luo in the future as well! If you don’t mind, call me Big Brother Luo!” Luo Yunqing said to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was not pretentious either, clasping his hands and saying with a smile, “Big Brother Luo!”

Luo Yunqing laughed loudly and said, “Good brother! Leave your matter to your big brother! This Lu Zhanyuan, I’ve already found him displeasing to the eye for a very long time already, well killed! I indeed didn’t misjudge things. Brother Ye’s temperament really suits my, Luo Yunqing’s tastes!?Hahaha?… Martial Uncle Shi,?oh?wait, Senior Apprentice Brother Shi, I’m shielding Ye Yuan! If you don’t feel happy about it, let’s have a fight now, how about it?”
