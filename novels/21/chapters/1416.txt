1420 With Me Around, You Can Be Capricious!

Above the sky, several dozen figures whistled past, with a shocking commotion.

With so many Deity Realm powerhouses moving out at the same time, this was absolutely an extremely rare situation in the Sky Foothill World.

The mortals were all guessing that some earth-shaking major incident must have happened, and that was why there were so many major figures moving out at the same time.

Deity Realm powerhouses traveled ten thousand miles in a twinkle. Three days later, the White Night Sacred Palace and the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s Deity Realm powerhouses finally met on a narrow path!

The person in the front ranks of the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace was an old geezer. Seeing the White Night Sacred Palace’s people, he could not help being surprised.

He already got the news that the White Night Palace Lord, Bai Yehai, was poisoned and died. Hence, he brought a large group of experts and charged over.

It was just that he did not expect that the White Night Sacred Palace’s people actually dared to charge right out.

He swept a glance through the crowd and said with a big laugh, “Where is Bai Yehai that old thing? Why didn’t he come? He didn’t dare to come, so he sent you, a little child, here to court death? Hahaha ...”

Bai Chen was angered until he was trembling all over. He pointed at the other party and said furiously, “Huo Tianyang, you’re shameless!”

This Huo Tianyang was precisely the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s palace lord, a grand completion Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse!

And the White Night Sacred Palace’s internal strife was precisely plotted by him singlehandedly.

This sowing discord strategy could not be said to not be ruthless, directly making the White Night Palace Lord Bai Yehai perished, his Dao disappearing.

Right now, the White Night Sacred Palace was a host of dragons without a head. They were about to borrow this opportunity to thoroughly wipe out the White Night Sacred Palace.

Bai Chen was still not mature enough in the end. With this anger, it thoroughly gave the whole thing away.

When the eight great elders behind him saw the situation, they all secretly shook their heads.

At this time, they should be putting on a false show of strength and let Huo Tianyang be unable to make a decision. Only then would they have hopes of scaring away the other party and win a chance to eke out a meager existence.

The moment Huo Tianyang heard, he laughed even more arrogantly and said, “My good nephew, looks like you have already become the palace lord! It’s just too bad that ... you as the palace lord can only be until today!”

Bai Chen said furiously, “Huo Tianyang, don’t be impudent! Today, even if we fight it out till the fish dies and net tears, I’ll also make you pay a blood price!”

Huo Tianyang laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Till the fish dies and net tears? Hahaha, even if the fish dies, the net won’t tear! Bai Yehai is not around. Just based on you guys, this bunch of stragglers and stray soldiers, also want to fight it out to the death? Today, your White Night Sacred Palace will be struck off the books from the Sky Foothill World!”

Huo Tianyang was in high spirits currently, full of domineeringness.

The moment grand completion Heaven Glimpse Realm released, the White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses’ all changed countenance.

Under this pressure, Bai Chen’s complexion became deathly pale, and he unconsciously looked over towards Ye Yuan there.

However, Ye Yuan was expressionless, as if he was in a daze, not giving him any hints at all. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He resolved his heart and mustered up all of his strength to resist this pressure.

His gaze suddenly focused toward Bai Xiu. He said, “Bai Xiu, if I die in battle today, you’ll be the lord of White Night! I hope that you’ll lead everybody to keep fighting regardless of death! Even if one last person is left, don’t shrink back either!”

Bai Xiu’s entire body trembled, not expecting that Bai Chen would actually say such words.

At this moment, Bai Chen’s image in his heart was magnified infinitely.

Originally, he was only forced to acknowledge this palace lord because he was afraid of Ye Yuan.

But now, Bai Chen’s gust actually stimulated him until his hot blood boiled!

In reality, although Ye Yuan defeated them, Bai Xiu did not think that Gui Yun could defeat Huo Tianyang.

At most, it was also just adding a little confidence to them.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up too, his gaze revealing an approving look.

Who knew how many hearts this sentence would buy over for Bai Chen!

This kid was also not absolutely without merit huh.

Bai Xiu’s eyes were actually slightly wet. Gritting his teeth, he cupped his fists and said, “Rest assured, Palace Lord, Bai Xiu will definitely fight to the bitter end! Bai Rong, if I die, you’ll be the lord of White Night! We’ll fight to the end and absolutely not shrink back!”

Bai Rong’s entire body trembled too and said, “Fight to the end and absolutely not shrink back!”

“Fight to the end and absolutely not shrink back!”

“Fight to the end and absolutely not shrink back!”

...

The resounding slogan shocked the entire world!

The moral on the White Night Sacred Palace’s side rose unprecedentedly.

Seeing this scene, Huo Tianyang’s expression changed slightly too.

He did not expect that this brat still wet behind the ears actually had such magical powers, to actually be able to trigger the fresh blood of that bunch of old fellows which had long turned cold.

An army burning with righteous indignation was bound to win!

Under this sort of circumstance, even if he won today, it would definitely be a pyrrhic victory too.

The generals disregarding their lives, the soldiers not fearing death.

This battle was not easy to win!

Except, when the arrow was on the notch, it must fly.

He did not believe, with his grand completion Heaven Glimpse strength, these guys could still flip the heavens?

However, before he could react, Bai Chen raised his long spear and stabbed over towards him brazenly.

“Kill!!!”

Bai Chen gave a fierce cry, carrying indomitable imposing momentum, and charged over towards Huo Tianyang.

At this moment, a hint of understanding was actually born in his heart! His spear art achieved a breakthrough at this moment!

Except, no matter how he broke through, he still could not stand up to a single blow in front of Huo Tianyang.

“Palace Lord, you mustn’t!”

Bai Xiu completely did not think that Bai Chen actually charged straight at Huo Tianyang.

This move did not hold back. Bai Chen went harboring the resolve of certain death!

The words earlier were not in order to inspire their morale. He was really going to show his determination with death, stimulating everyone’s fighting spirits!

One Bai Chen had no influence on the battle situation.

But the moment he died, the situation would be completely different!

At this moment, he actually gained admiration towards this palace lord, and also truly acknowledged him in his heart!

It was just too bad ... he was already too late.

Huo Tianyang naturally understood this logic too. His brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “Seeking death!”

Huo Tianyang raised a pair of fleshy palm and smacked over towards Bai Chen.

A palm move of a grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse, what kind of power was that?

A hint of a liberated faint smile actually revealed at the corners of Bai Chen’s mouth.

But right at this time, a dark-black enormous claw extended out from the void.

Bai Chen’s spear had yet to stab out and was bounced back by a massive force!

Boom!

Huo Tianyang’s palm collided together solidly with the enormous claw, kicking up a wave of massive undulation!

Evenly matched!

Huo Tianyang’s expression suddenly changed, staring fixedly at Gui Yun, akin to being confronted by a formidable enemy!

“A-Actually stopped it! Truly inconceivable!” When Bai Xiu saw this scene, his gaze was full of disbelief.

A late-stage Heaven Glimpse Ghost Dao powerhouse actually blocked the all-out attack of a grand completion Heaven Glimpse?

Only at this time did he know that Ye Yuan showed mercy to them that day!

Otherwise, not a single one of them could live!

“S-So strong!”

“What’s that black ghost claw? Why would it have such a terrifying strength?”

“That Ghost Dao powerhouse has such formidable strength, to actually be able to fight to a draw with the palace lord!”

...

The Autumn Rain Sacred Palace that side, each and every one of them also cried out sounds of exclamations all around, being utterly stunned by this scene.

The originally almost guaranteed battle had a sudden turn of events!

And the White Night Sacred Palace this side seeing this scene, each and every one of them was greatly roused!

Huo Tianyang was like a huge mountain, pressing on their hearts, making them unable to gasp for air.

Now, this huge mountain was actually held up by someone!

“I’ve said it before that with me around, you can be capricious!”

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled. Ye Yuan already arrived behind him at no idea when.
