Chapter 2048: Empty Alleys

Lin Tong listened very attentively and did not notice the situation behind him.

But upon turning his head, he could not help but be filled with surprise.

Behind him, the crowd that was originally in great numbers actually disappeared without a trace.

“That Grandmaster Ye is incredible. I heard that during his sermon, many people broke through on the spot.”

“Yeah, I heard that Grandmaster Ye’s sermon explained profound theories in simple terms. He made it very easy to understand.”

“Sigh! I really had my eyes blinded by pig oil, to actually not go and listen to Grandmaster Ye’s preaching on the Dao!”

“Many people have already gone over! Let’s hurry and go over.”

“Then what are we still waiting for? Hurry up and go over!”

Those few people discussed and got up and were about to leave.

When Lin Tong heard the few people discussing, he was incredibly shocked in his heart and secretly wondered if the Grandmaster Ye from these few people’s mouths was the Grandmaster Ye that Song Zichun spoke of.

Seeing the few people leave, Lin Tong hurriedly stopped them and whispered, “Fellow Daoists, who is the Grandmaster Ye that you guys were talking about just now?”

The few people looked at Lin Tong with eyes like looking at a freak as one of them said, “You don’t even know about Grandmaster Ye?”

Lin Tong smiled bitterly and said, “Fellow Daoist, please tell me.”

The other person said, “Grandmaster Ye is the youngest grandmaster in the Southern Border’s history, the youngest half-step Ancestor Realm. In this alchemy summit, he suppressed 99% of the Seven-star Alchemy Gods with his power alone until they submitted! You’ve actually never heard of his great name before? Not talking to you anymore. I’ve already been stuck at the initial-stage Initial Realm for many years. Perhaps after listening to Grandmaster Ye preach on Dao, it will suddenly dawn upon me.”

Done talking, that person left without even turning his head back, leaving behind the Lin Tong with a stunned face.

Song Zichun was actually not bragging!

But how was this possible?

Song Zichun said that this Grandmaster Ye was only less than 1500 years old. He actually stepped into becoming a half-step Alchemy God and overpowered 99% of the Seven-star Alchemy Gods?

This ... This was simply a figure in mythological stories!

If it was merely like this, then forget it; it had nothing to do with him no matter how strong Ye Yuan was either.

But now, Ye Yuan’s preaching on the Dao actually let many people break through on the spot. This was too incredible! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lin Tong harbored complicated feelings and slowly got up and walked over in the direction where Ye Yuan was preaching on the Dao along with the crowd.

Along the way, Lin Tong discovered that more and more people were currently gathering in the same direction.

“This ... This is too inconceivable! Can a thousand over years old young man really have such great rallying power?” Lin Tong was still somewhat doubting.

...

The Tianyue Plaza at the south-west was a very remote plaza of Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

The plaza was very small and could only accommodate several tens of thousands of people.

Lin Tong could not move anymore after he walked halfway, because in front of him was packed full of people.

On the roofs, on the pavilions, there were figures everywhere.

Although the numbers were many, the entire plaza appeared extremely quiet, a pin drop could be heard.

There was only a voice that seemed slightly immature in the plaza, transmitting over slowly.

Just hearing a few sentences, Lin Tong’s figure suddenly trembled, akin to being enlightened, all the pores in the body opening up.

“This ... This ... No way! I have to hurry up and find a place!”

Lin Tong’s eyes swept all around hastily and discovered that it was already overcrowded.

Helpless, he came to a slightly far-off rooftop with a few leaps.

“Eh, Lin Tong?” Suddenly, a mosquito-like voice came over.

Lin Tong had a look of surprise as he said, “Song Zichun? You ... Why are you here?”

Who could this person be if not Song Zichun?

It was just that, didn’t Song Zichun come long ago? Why would he be in such a remote place?

Song Zichun had a bitter smile on his face as he said, “The places in front are all occupied by major families’ disciples. I was originally at a place very close to Grandmaster Ye. Now, I was forcefully squeezed out.”

Finished talking, Song Zichun switched to an amused smile and said, “Didn’t you not believe my words, saying that I was bragging? Since you turned your nose up at Grandmaster Ye, what did you come here now for?”

Lin Tong’s expression was very awkward. But he recollected his thoughts very quickly and could not be bothered to argue with Song Zichun.

He wanted to listen to Ye Yuan’s preaching on the Dao!

Although he had only heard a few sentences, Lin Tong discovered that Grandmaster Ye’s sermon was totally different from Empyrean Pilljade’s.

Empyrean Pilljade’s sermon was akin to clouds, seeming near, but in reality far away.

But Grandmaster Ye’s sermon was akin to revolving around him. It was within reach!

This kind of feeling was like there was a pair of invisible big hands hastening the influence, letting them understand Alchemy Dao.

“Heh,

looking at your appearance, you should have discovered the difference of Grandmaster Ye’s sermon, right? I only listened for a day and already broke through!” Song Zichun said with a smug look.

When he saw the expression on Lin Tong’s face, how could he not understand what the other party was thinking?

When he first started listening, his expression was exactly the same as Lin Tong’s.

With this, Lin Tong could not resist visibly changing his countenance anymore.

“What? You ... you already broke through?” Lin Tong said in shock.

Song Zichun’s strength was similar to his. He was also at the peak initial-stage Initial Realm, just a step away from reaching the middle-stage Initial Realm.

It was just that this step was far too difficult for them.

But Song Zichun only listened for a day and already broke through the shackles. How could this not surprise Lin Tong?

Song Zichun chuckled and said, “That’s right! Among those 5000 people that came first, there were at least 300 people that broke through on the spot.”

Lin Tong was already unable to use words to describe the shock in his heart. This Grandmaster Ye was too amazing!

He sucked in a deep breath, forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart, and started listening to Ye Yuan’s preaching on the Dao, and he entered a profound and mysterious state very soon.

...

Empyrean Pilljade looked at the sharply declining numbers, his brows furrowing.

This kind of sermon did not restrict the venue. People that were willing could go to several venues within half a month.

But, in the past, his audience normally had more than 100 thousand people. But now, there were less than 30 thousand people.

And the numbers were still declining.

How keen was the divine sense of Empyrean powerhouses?

He could feel that the people who left were all heading in the southwest directly.

That place was precisely the place where Ye Yuan was preaching.

Furthermore, Empyrean Pilljade even discovered that it was not just him, but the numbers of people at other grandmasters’ sermons were also reducing sharply.

The alchemists in the city were practically all gathered towards the southwest corner.

“Just how terrifying is this kid?”

Toward Ye Yuan, Empyrean Pilljade presently only had a word to describe his sentiment: convinced!

Ever since the Cloudpill Summit started, Ye Yuan suppressed Empyreans, seized territories, and took in geniuses. Now, he also drew all of the alchemists in the city into his preaching field.

He felt that the Cloudpill Summit this time was simply held for Ye Yuan.

Although Empyrean Pilljade looked down on these ordinary alchemists, he also understood that these people were not fools. It was impossible to all go to Ye Yuan there without any rhyme or reason.

Ye Yuan’s sermon definitely had areas different from others.

No, it was not just different from the rest, but it had magical power.

The other 12 grandmasters, inclusive of Empyrean Flutterfeather, had the same thoughts as Empyrean Pilljade without prior conversation.

Empyrean Flutterfeather looked in the southwest direction and smiled bitterly in his heart as he said, “I thought that I already overestimated this kid. I didn’t expect that ... I still underestimated him!”

On the third day of the sermon, Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital had empty alleys. All of the alchemists listening attentively to the sermons all gathered at the southwest corner.

It was densely packed with crowds around Tianyue Plaza.
