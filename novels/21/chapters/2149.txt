Chapter 2153: Battle of Dragon Sons!

“Yo, Long Chi, what a shocking scene! Got nothing to do? To actually call yourself a pig?”

Long Chi was just yelling ‘Long Chi is a pig’ when a middle-aged man suddenly appeared at the top of the stone tower, having a look of amusement on his face.

Long Chi’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Brother Ao Xu, what are you here for?”

Ao Xu chuckled and said, “You don’t have to care about what I’m here for first. You’re doing something unique here. This Emperor could even hear your howls from a hundred miles away. Heh heh, our dragon race bloodline is incomparably noble. So even if you abandon yourself to despair, don’t put yourself in the same category as a pig, this kind of low-grade life-form!”

Long Chi had a black face, the hatred toward Ye Yuan in his heart increasing even more.

This Ao Xu was Heavenly Stronghold Purpledragon Stronghold’s Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. Having this scene seen by him, wouldn’t this unsavory scandal spread to all the heaven strongholds?

Could it be that his face was going to utterly lose in the East Suppression Pseudo World?

Fortunately, this Ao Xu’s relationship with him was pretty good. Long Chi let out a sigh and said, “Sigh! Don’t mention it anymore, Brother Ao Xu! Right now, I have a stifled breath blocked up in my chest, almost exploding!”

Ao Xi knew that Long Chi covered the sky with one hand in Raindragon Stronghold, virtually rendering Dragon Lord Long Xiyue to a figurehead.

This scene right now should not happen.

“Oh? Could someone still anger you until like this in this Raindragon Stronghold?” Ao Xu said curiously. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Long Chi had a bitter look as he said, “There wasn’t in the past, but now ... sigh!”

He roughly recounted the events. Of course, he selectively forgot about Long Hao’s overbearing action.

When Ao Xu heard, he could not help having a shocked face too.

“You’re saying that he only used ten years’ time and broke through to Empyrean in the Dragon Eye Cave, obtained the Heavenly Dragon Mark, and even found the way back?” Ao Xu counter-asked.

Long Chi nodded and said, “Precisely so!”

“Pooh! Precisely so my ass! Long Chi old punk, this emperor takes you to be a friend. Are you playing this emperor like a monkey?” Ao Xu directly spat in Long Chi’s face. He completely did not believe Long Chi’s words.

But right at this time, Ao Xu gave a slight cry of surprise. A white secret order jumped out of the void and landed in Ao Xu’s hands.

Ao Xu reached his hand out and grabbed the secret order in his hand. Sinking his divine sense inside and looking, his expression could not help changing wildly.

“Long Chi, what did you say that pu ... the Son of the Heavenly Dragon was called?” Ao Xu asked in a solemn voice.

“He’s called Ye Yuan!” Long Chi gritted his teeth and said.

Getting a confirmed answer, shock was written all over Ao Xu’s face as he said, “Then, what you said earlier was all true?”

Long Chi was speechless as he said, “It’s naturally true!”

Ao Xu opened his mouth wide, disbelief all over his face.

The things that Long Chi said, each one was unthinkable, let alone that it even happened to one person at the same time.

This matter was too inconceivable!

Long Chi observed his speech and countenance and said, “Brother Ao Xu coming to Raindragon Stronghold, could it be ...”

Ao Xu nodded and said, “That’s right, the Battle of Dragon Sons is about to begin, I came to invite Long Xiaochun to take part. However ... a secret order came from the stronghold just now, saying that an additional name appeared on the Dragon Mark Monument, called Ye Yuan, originating from precisely your Raindragon Stronghold! I really didn’t expect that a measly little Raindragon Stronghold actually produced two children of the heavenly dragon this time!”

... ...

“Hehe, Ye Yuan, seeing this great grandaunt, shouldn’t you kowtow?” Long Xiaochun teased Ye Yuan again.

Ye Yuan was speechless, Long Xiaochun could play with this stick for ten years.

However, Long Xiyue said in a solemn voice, “Xiaochun, you mustn’t be rude! Disregarding that Ye Yuan obtained the Heavenly Dragon Mark, just talking about how he’s of the Atavism Dragon Soul, it’s equivalent to Big Brother’s successor separated by generations. In terms of seniority, he’s of the same generation as you! You’re younger than him and should call him as your big brother!”

Long Xiyue looked toward Ye Yuan with an affectionate look.

She and Long Qin had a close relationship. The love for the house extends to even the crows perching on the roof, so she naturally viewed Ye Yuan in a different light.

Long Xiaochun pursed her mouth and said unhappily, “What? I finally managed to get some leverage over him, but you ruined it with one sentence.”

Ye Yuan also found it funny listening at one side. It turned out that the Dragon Clan could still have this way of saying things.

Long Xiyue shot Long Xiaochun a fierce glare and said, “You lass, you don’t cultivate well every day! You only know how to cause disturbances! The Battle of Dragon Sons is about to begin right away. Starting from today, you cultivate well for me, strive to break through to Second Firmament Empyrean as soon as possible! If you lose in the Battle of Dragon Sons, see if I don’t teach you a lesson!”

The moment Long Xiaochun heard the word cultivate, she could not help getting a headache.

“Mother, don’t force me anymore! You look, I already cultivate very diligently, cultivating to the Empyrean Realm so quickly.” Long Xiaochun said in a spoiled manner.

But Long Xiyue was not the slightest bit moved and pulled a long face as she said, “Don’t give me that! Doesn’t Mother still not know your character? If you still dare to be negligent, just remember that I will directly confine you!”

Long Xiaochun had a bitter face. Suddenly, she had a spark of inspiration. Pulling Ye Yuan, she had an appearance of giving people a feeling of unable to help to show tender care when one saw her as she said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan ...”

Long Xiyue was just about to get angry, but saw Ye Yuan smile. He said, “Aunt, you don’t need to force Xiaochun like this too. With her talent, isn’t breaking through to Second Firmament Empyrean still easily accomplished?”

Long Xiaochun nodded her head like a chicken pecking for rice at the side, agreeing strongly to this.

Ye Yuan’s words were also not uttered against his conscience. Long Xiaochun’s talent was indeed what he rarely saw in this lifetime.

Even that Lin Changqing who cracked himself up to be a genius was also a piece of trash in front of Long Xiaochun.

This was still Long Xiaochun being very playful, that was why her cultivation speed was so slow.

If she cultivated diligently, her current strength would already be god knows how horrifying.

Long Xiyue shook her head and said, “You don’t know this. But the Battle of Dragon Sons is related to the Raindragon Stronghold’s rise and fall. Now that the Battle of Dragon Sons is hanging above our heads, with her indolent personality, she’ll definitely suffer a big loss going to the Battle of Dragon Sons. Those able to obtain the Heavenly Dragon Mark and become children of the heavenly dragon, every one of their strength is extremely powerful and not much weaker than her.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, Aunt, leave Xiaochun’s breakthrough to me.”

Long Xiyue was taken aback and said with pleasant surprise, “I nearly forgot. You’re the Second Sage that Sacred Ancestor High Priest personally conferred! Then ... I won’t be courteous!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “We are one family. There is no need to be too distant.”

Long Xiyue beamed and said, “I really didn’t expect that Big Brother would actually have an outstanding descendant like you. Given time, you’ll definitely surpass your predecessor!”

Long Xiaochun giggled and said, “Great! Eating a medicinal pill and I’ll be able to break through, it really saves too much trouble!”

... ...

In front of Ao Xu, Long Chi said with a doleful look, “Brother Ao Xu, you have to uphold justice for this younger brother! Disregarding that that boy killed my Hao-er, he even used this sort of method to humiliate me! I really can’t endure this grievance!”

Ao Xu revealed a difficult look, shook his head, and said with a sigh, “Younger Brother Long Chi, Elder Brother knows the bitterness in your heart. But you’re aware of the status of the Son of the Heavenly Dragon. Just based on my status, it’s hard to touch him at all!”

Long Chi secretly cursed the old fox, gritted his teeth, and said, “As long as Brother Ao Xu is willing to help Younger Brother take revenge, Younger Brother is willing to offer the Heaven Shaking Hammer with both hands.”

Ao Xu could not help smiling when he heard this. He then said, “Younger Brother Long Chi, rest assured. What’s our relationship? Your matters are my matters. This matter, I’ll definitely help you settle it!”
