Chapter 2467: Became a Spirit!

“Honk!”

Treasure Pig gave an angry roar. Its pig mouth opened, and rows of water swords shot toward Ancestor Fire.

This power was actually also a power of rules!

This pig actually grasped two great power of rules at the same time!

Ancestor Fire’s expression changed wildly, hurriedly meeting the challenge.

Bang, bang, bang?…

Heaven and earth were collapsing, terrifying energy undulation made everyone’s faces change.

What was even scarier was that Ancestor Fire was being completely suppressed!

Water and fire gushed from Treasure Pig’s mouth, the power being boundless. It actually fought until Ancestor Fire did not have the slightest strength to fight back!

Ye Yuan was dumbstruck with amazement from watching. He fed Treasure Pig for so many years and never knew that he was so strong!

He remembered back then that Treasure Pig sent Lin Changqing flying with a sneeze.

Although it was surprising, Ye Yuan did not feel that it was too exaggerated.

After all, Treasure Pig was also a very special existence in Bamboo Groove Void Realm.

But now, Treasure Pig actually fought until Ancestor Fire did not have the slightest strength to fight back! This was too exaggerated.

Origin Enlighten Mountain Range was directly crumbled apart by two great Ancestor Realm powerhouses fighting, spiritual energy collapsing and dissipating.

The group of powerhouses hid far away, such a battle was too terrifying!

“I’ll help you!”

At this time, Dao Ancestor Destruction suddenly burst forth with an imposing momentum, joining the battle with a flash.

The moment Dao Ancestor Destruction made his move, space shattered, and not a blade of grass survived!

That kind of horrifying attack simply obliterated the heaven and decimated the earth!

These two great Dao Ancestors were all known for the power of their offensive strength.

It was just that sadly, the addition of Dao Ancestor Destruction did not suppress Treasure Pig. They just barely fought to a draw with Treasure Pig.

The might of Treasure Pig was utterly appalling!

The more the two great Dao Ancestors fought, the more alarmed they got. Treasure Pig was like a rule transmitter, all kinds of attacks emerging in endless streams.

Furthermore, there was never a stop!

Suddenly, a strong thick strange fragrance spread out. The entire world teemed with this fragrance.

When the fragrance entered his nose, Ye Yuan’s expression became weird.

His brows furrowed and he said in surprise, “This fragrance is … medicinal fragrance?”

Very clearly, this exotic fragrance effused from Treasure Pig’s body.

This guy was in the heat of a great battle and his body was actually giving off such a thick medicinal fragrance.

Ye Yuan’s mind spun like lightning and had an answer very soon.

It was just that, he was also stunned by this answer, disbelief written all over his face.

“This guy … wouldn’t be a Dao pill, right?” Ye Yuan said in shock.

At the same time, Lin Chaotian’s face also revealed a look of sudden realization and cried out in surprise, “Legends has it that back then, Grand Ancestor Profound Spirit refined a Dao pill. As a result, it brought down heaven and earth Dao tribulation, and a mutation happened to the Dao pill! Could it be that this pig is that Dao pill?”

“What! This pig is … a Dao pill?” By the side, Ancestor Water was dumbstruck with amazement.

“This … This is also too inconceivable, right? Grand Ancestor Profound Spirit was the alchemy path’s number one person back then!” Ancestor Lightning also said in shock.

A Dao pill became a spirit!

They all, these Dao Ancestors, actually could not beat a Dao pill!

The group of Dao Ancestors opened their mouths wide, shocked until it could not be any greater.

A Dao pill actually transformed into a pig and even cultivated to the realm of rule!

Lin Chaotian’s gaze gradually turned from shock into ecstasy and greed.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he yelled, “Treasure Pig, come back!”

When Treasure Pig heard that, he released a few shots through the air and turned back to return to Ye Yuan’s side, turning into a pink pig and returning to Ye Yuan’s arms.

Hearing Lin Chaotian’s words, Ye Yuan finally understood why Treasure Pig liked him so much.

The alchemy Dao teachings in the last epoch were imparted by him.

The medicinal pills that he refined had a familiar taste to Treasure Pig.

Furthermore, Treasure Pig ate medicinal pills to live. It was actually also strengthening his own strength.

The taste of the medicinal pills that Ye Yuan refined was naturally extraordinary.

It was just that with Treasure Pig revealing his identity, he was now viewed as a great tonic to Lin Chaotian they all!

Regarding a Dao pill that cultivated and became a spirit, its strength was even stronger than a Dao Ancestor.

If they ate Treasure Pig, their strength would most likely grow to a terrifying point.

To powerhouses at the level of Lin Chaotian, even Dao pills did not have much effect anymore. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But Treasure Pig was an exception!

He was the proud work of Grand Ancestor Profound Spirit and had even experienced the accumulation of countless years, and already grew into a Dao Ancestor-like existence.

Such a Dao pill, one absolutely could not find a second one in the world.

He determined Lin Chaotian’s plans from the change in his eyes, so he quickly called Treasure Pig back.

Although Treasure Pig was strong, it was also impossible to be the nine great Dao Ancestors’ match.

“Treasure Pig, in a while, you bring my physical body and escape. The further you run, the better! Don’t need to care about me! Even if they chase you, don’t continue fighting. Understood?” Ye Yuan transmitted his voice with his divine soul and communicated with Treasure Pig.

Witnessing Treasure Pig’s strength, Ye Yuan had long already made a plan.

If Treasure Pig brought him along, they definitely could not escape.

Escaping from under the hands of the nine great Dao Ancestors, this was something virtually impossible.

Moreover, with Ye Yuan’s current state, he was simply a burden to Treasure Pig.

Treasure Pig looked toward Ye Yuan, his gaze flickering.

Ye Yuan knew that he understood!

“Leave!”

Ye Yuan shouted loudly, his origin divinity instantly leaving his body!

Treasure Pig was extremely intelligent, he erupted at the same time, holding Ye Yuan’s physical body in his mouth, turning tail and running.

Lin Chaotian and the rest had astounded faces. Clearly, they were caught off-guard by this sudden change.

But his reaction was also extremely fast as he said, “Ancestor Fire, Ancestor Water, Destruction, the three of you go chase that pig, don’t need to finish him off! Just delay him will do! The few of us go and chase Ye Yuan! After killing Ye Yuan, we’ll regroup with you again!?Heh,?this brat actually dared to have his divine soul leave the body, truly reckless and blind!”

Lin Chaotian was still very awake at this time. To him, Ye Yuan was of the utmost importance!

Letting Ye Yuan escape, there would be no end to future troubles!

Therefore, even if Ye Yuan escaped with his divine soul body, he still brought the main force to hunt Ye Yuan down.

At this time, there was no way for the Dao Ancestors they all to hesitate either. Fire, Water, and Destruction, three great Dao Ancestors, directly turned into wisps of green smoke, chasing after.

Ye Yuan cultivated the chaos origin divinity, he traversed the world incredibly swiftly.

Although he was unable to borrow spacetime law to carry out teleportation, his speed was not much slower.

Lin Chaotian and the rest turned into six streaks of long rainbow, chasing right after.

This sudden change stunned all of the powerhouses.

“This … What in the world is going on here? That pig was actually a Dao pill that cultivated and achieved sentience?”

“Ye Yuan’s divine soul actually left his body in order to let that pig run? How can he possibly escape the pursuit of Dao Ancestors with a wisp of a divine soul?”

“I’m afraid that he knows that he can’t escape anymore, that’s why he used himself as a bait to let that pig escape.”

… …

No one could have thought that the show today actually developed into this state. It was truly full of twists and turns.

Except, they also let out long sighs in the end.

Ye Yuan was ultimately unable to escape the fiendish clutches of the Dao Ancestors!

Divine soul leaving the body was no different from suiciding.

“How can this brat’s divine soul body be so fast?” Lin Chaotian’s expression changed slightly as he said.

Upon chasing, they discovered that they actually could not catch up to Ye Yuan within a short time!”

To the group of Dao Ancestors, this was simply inconceivable.
