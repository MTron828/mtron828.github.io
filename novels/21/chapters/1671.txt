Chapter 1675 Brand New Realm!

“I say, guys, do you think that guy wouldn’t have run over from the realm fog, right?”

“There’s really a possibility! His position is at the edge of the fogrealm. The passageway also hasn’t opened up currently, so there’s no way that he came straight up from outside.”

“Yeah, an Origin Deity Realm, it’s impossible to run up by hiding among us too.”

“Where did this genius pop out from? Is the Heavenspan World’s sky going to change? An Origin Deity Realm breaking through actually has such commotion!”

“Isn’t that so? Even if you and I break through, it’s also impossible to cause such a big commotion! Looking at his appearance, he’ll only give up after absorbing the spiritual energy above ten-miles clean!”

...

The group of Celestial Deity powerhouses looked at the Ye Yuan inside the storm and was struck even more with wonder.

Too many unknowns, too many mysteries; it made them feel unbearably itchy, wanting to take a look at just who was breaking through.

And Ye Yuan’s divine sea was currently undergoing earth-shaking changes at this time.

Innumerable spiritual energy entered his body from every pore, finally merging into the divine sea.

His divine sea was just like a bottomless pit; unable to be filled no matter what.

Ye Yuan’s divine sea was long already saturated. Logically speaking, it was unable to accommodate more divine essence at all.

However, at this time, those viscous divine essence in his divine sea started to slowly revolve under the urging of the fourth level cultivation method.

This revolution was just like a millstone, compressing and condensing the originally paste-like divine essence once more.

As a result, after a large quantity of spiritual energy was refined by Ye Yuan, it merged into that vortex.

This vortex was just like a black hole, devouring the refined divine essence frenziedly.

Now, inside Ye Yuan’s divine lord, a slowly rotating viscous cyclone formed.

In terms of size, this viscous cyclone was much smaller than before. But the thickness of the divine essence was a hundred times more than before!

Rumble ...

A horrifying aura transmitted out of the storm, reaching straight for the firmament!

Ye Yuan’s aura soared frenziedly inside the storm.

Finally, he broke through the bottleneck of Origin Deity Realm in one stroke, entering the Divine Dao fourth stage!

Ye Yuan’s two eyes suddenly opened, his eyes shooting out rays of brilliant light.

His eyes were full of shock.

The storm started gradually dissipating. The Celestial Deity powerhouses outside all opened their eyes wide, wanting to take a look at just who it was that actually caused such a powerful influence.

Swoosh!

Just as a figure was faintly discernible, that person’s figure moved, directly tunneling into the fog realm.

When the Celestial Deity powerhouses who were waiting eagerly saw this scene, they could not resist letting loose a torrent of abuse.

“What a cunning lad, actually ran!”

“F*ck, this kid is too wily! Scratched until your father’s heart is unbearably itchy but he actually slipped away!”

“Bastard, get back for your father! You’re being extremely irresponsible here! You’ll die a horrible death!”

“This bastard, he actually really passed through via the fog realm. How in the world did he do it?”

“This kid is too mysterious! Ahhh, I can’t take it anymore, who the hell was that punk?!”

...

Right now, these Celestial Deity powerhouses were like watching a suspenseful movie, all of the mysteries would be revealed at the last second.

But when this movie played out until all of the mysteries were about to be unveiled, the power suddenly cut off.

This emotion of going crazy, only the parties involved could understand it.

If Ye Yuan showed up right now, he would definitely be dismembered by a flurry of blades by these Celestial Deity powerhouses.

However, Ye Yuan could not be bothered with those Celestial Deity powerhouses.

He knew that his commotion was too big. Furthermore, passing through from the fog realm, those people would definitely be very curious.

Once he revealed his true self, there would be countless troubles.

Those were all Celestial Deity powerhouses. Even if Ye Yuan’s current means were immensely formidable, it was also impossible to be their match.

If someone had a malicious intent, wanting to find him to be a guinea pig, or coveted the treasures on him, that would not be too good.

As for their unbearably itchy hearts, Ye Yuan did not care.

Whatever!

Of course, Ye Yuan being anxious to get away was because naturally there was a more important thing to do.

Because he broke through to a brand new realm, a completely different realm!

Ye Yuan needed to figure out just what kind of realm he broke through to.

Creating a cultivation method, everything was empty talk.

What it was like after breaking through, Ye Yuan was completely unsure too.

Everything needed him to go and fumble.

Entering the fog realm, Ye Yuan found an open space and started introspecting his own body.

Inside the divine sea, a viscous cyclone was revolving systematically, like a cluster of nebulae.

But Ye Yuan could feel that his divine essence was already completely different from before.

As for the specifics of what was different, he could not tell either.

The size of the viscous divine essence was around one-fourth smaller than before.

But the total reserve of the divine essence was a hundred times more than before!

Ye Yuan sensed that this viscous cyclone seemed to be very mysterious. It further compressed the viscous divine essence.

He clearly absorbed a large amount of divine essence, but the size became even smaller than before instead.

However, what surprised Ye Yuan was that his divine sea became small too!

Other people breaking through to the Divine Lord Realm, it was transforming the divine sea into a small world.

Him on the other hand, not only did his divine sea not become big, it shrunk instead. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Mn? What’s this?”

Ye Yuan suddenly discovered that the surroundings of the viscous cyclone seemed to have some miniscule patterns.

“These patterns seem ... to be somewhat similar to the patterns on your body!” Dustless suddenly said.

Ye Yuan looked carefully. It really was so!

But studying it for a long time, he also did not figure out what use these patterns had.

“What ... What’s my realm? Seems like ... calling it Divine Lord Realm isn’t too appropriate, right?” Ye Yuan suddenly said with a bitter smile.

By creating a small world and becoming the sovereign of a world, only then could one be called a Divine Lord.

But Ye Yuan did not have a small world at all and naturally could not be called a Divine Lord.

Dustless also looked speechless as he said, “This path of yours is unprecedented and unrepeatable. But I can feel that your realm is likely extraordinary! Maybe ... the path that you take is correct and others ... forget it, you’d better name it.”

Ye Yuan had a bitter smile on his face, suddenly having a feeling of how the world was drunk and he alone was awake.

He thought about it and said, “Since a cyclone formed in my divine sea, why not call it Divine Vortex Realm!”

Dustless nodded when he heard it and said, “Divine Vortex Realm, it’s apt. Heh heh, this old man is somewhat looking forward to just where you, this kid, can walk to!”

Ye Yuan laughed loudly and said, “I don’t dare to say which step I can walk until, but right now, I’m somewhat itching to have a go. I want to try the power of this Divine Vortex Realm!”

Dustless froze when he heard that and said with uncertainty, “How to try?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Isn’t there a live target ahead? Heh heh, let’s go back.”

Dustless was stunned and immediately revealed a knowing smile.

When that group of people saw Ye Yuan return, they would definitely get a big shock, right?
