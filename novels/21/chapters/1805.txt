Chapter 1809 Battling Qian Ye

“The gap between Celestial Deity Realm and Divine Lord Realm, I don’t need you to remind me. I’m very clear about what I’m doing. The more you talk, the more it displays the hesitation in your heart,” Ye Yuan looked at Qian Ye and said coolly.Qian Ye’s faltering confidence, Ye Yuan naturally saw through it with one glance.

Divine Lord Realm challenging Celestial Deity Realm, this kind of courting death action, if Qian Ye was brimming with confidence, he would not have the least bit of hesitation.

However, he hesitated.

This showed that the strength he exhibited previously already left behind an indelible impression in Qian Ye’s heart.

Following the increase in his realm, the uncertainty in Qian Ye’s heart grew even greater.

Hence, that was why he did not dare to answer the challenge.

Because punishing Ye Yuan through the sect rules was much safer.

Qian Ye smiled coldly and said, “Heh, with just the likes of you? I’m just disdainful to take action. Since you’re courting death yourself, then I’ll personally avenge Hanlin and redress his hatred!”

Ye Yuan smiled scornfully and said, “Really so much crap! Something that can be settled with a slap, what are you hesitating for?”

Jiang Hong’s brows furrowed and he could not help scrutinizing Ye Yuan anew.

With his eyesight, he could naturally tell that Qian Ye was really faltering!

Although the two people’s realms were far apart, from start to end, it was all Ye Yuan grasping the initiative.

If it was an opponent of similar strength, this bit of flaw was enough to be fatal!

Did Ye Yuan really have this strength or was he making an empty show of strength?

“Woodcutter, you’re so optimistic about this brat?” Jiang Hong could not resist asking.

The woodcutter smiled simply and said, “Heh heh, I know what you want to ask, but I don’t know. Maybe, the one who loses is Ye Yuan! But I know that even if Ye Yuan can’t win, it absolutely won’t be easy for Qian Ye to want to take him down too.”

A hint of strange expression revealed on Jiang Hong’s face, thinking to himself that this guy did not even have confidence himself and yet let that kid take the field?

This guy was indeed a lunatic that cannot be explained by reason!

Junyi Sword entering the hand, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Since you’re not making a move, then I’ll make a move!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan raised his long sword and stepped forward.

The swift and fierce sword energy made everyone’s faces change.

“Sword Dao rank five, this is his reliance? Foolish!”

When Elder Tao saw this scene, his expression could not help changing slightly. But his words were full of contempt.

Divine Lord Realm comprehending Sword Dao rank five, this was absolutely a genius among geniuses.

Except, dealing with Celestial Deity Realm with this was clearly still not enough.

But Qian Ye behaved akin to facing a great enemy and gritted his teeth and said, “Who cares about your laws. I’ll just use realm to crush you!”

Done talking, Qian Ye’s aura climbed frenziedly, the ring teemed with his world power.

At this moment, the entire arena seemed to have become Qian Ye’s world.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and had a direct understanding of the might of Celestial Deity Realm.

If the world power of the Divine Lord Realm was just a trickle, then the world power of the Celestial Deity Realm was a great river.

World power was the martial artist’s control of a region of the world!

Celestial Deity Realms already reached a subtle and meticulous degree regarding this control of a region of the world.

Those able to contend with Celestial Deity Realms were only Celestial Deity Realms!

Of course, Ye Yuan was not subjected to the rules.

His figure started becoming erratic, the space around also emitted strange undulations.

If Qian Ye’s world power was an impervious shield, then Ye Yuan was a sharp blade.

This was the showdown between the spear and the shield!

Under everyone’s astonished gazes, Ye Yuan broke through the heavy barrier of world power and rushed in front of Qian Ye.

When Qian Ye saw this scene, his pupils constricted.

A Divine Lord could actually break through the world power of the Celestial Deity Realm?

One had to know, the world power of a Celestial Deity was more than a hundred times stronger than a Divine Lord!

“This guy’s spatial law also became much stronger!”

Like this, how could Qian Ye still dare to be careless? He immediately went up to receive it and clashed together with Ye Yuan.

Saber lights and sword shadows, the two people’s moves were inconceivably swift and were actually hard evenly matched.

The surrounding audience, each and every one of them felt a chill, being dumbfounded with amazement by this scene in front of them.

Jiang Hong opened his mouth wide and had disbelief written all over his face as he muttered, “Rank five Sword Dao law fused with rank three spatial law! How in the world ... this did brat achieve it?”

At this moment, he finally knew where Ye Yuan’s confidence came from.

Such monstrous talent entered the sect for more than 200 years, he was actually unknown to the public.

This was simply a joke!

In front of Ye Yuan, Baili Qingyan was merely thus as well.

Such a prodigy was actually relegated to Tianying Peak, which pig did it?

Jiang Hong’s inner-heart was practically roaring. They, these skill-imparting elders, did not belong to any faction.

If even this position was monopolized by the respective factions, then the Shadowmoon Sect would also not be far from decline.

Hence, when he saw Ye Yuan’s terrifying strength, Jiang Hong’s first thought was to curse and swear!

Looking at it now, Ye Yuan was hated by others for being more talented and deliberately ostracized to Tianying Peak.

No wonder Ye Yuan had such great resentment. Anyone would also not be reconciled to it.

These 200 years, Ye Yuan did not only break through realm. He also constantly fought with himself in the Death Cultivation Space.

His Sword Dao law already broke through to rank five. Spatial law also broke through to the level of grand completion rank three.

The two fusing together, Ye Yuan’s combat power was no idea how many times stronger than before closed-seclusion.

While Celestial Deity Realms were strong, Ye Yuan’s cultivation method was powerful. Similarly Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, he was much stronger than those in the same rank.

Powerful cultivation method coupled with powerful laws fusion, the disparity between Ye Yuan and a First Firmament Celestial Deity was not as great as others imagined.

Of course, it was also absolutely not that easy.

Qian Ye was not an ordinary First Firmament Celestial Deity. His law comprehension was likewise very high. In addition, his ubiquitous world power formed an absolute suppress against Ye Yuan.

Except, this did not impede the people’s surprise at Ye Yuan’s strength.

“Hahaha, so what even if you can jump realms to battle? Aren’t you still suppressed firmly by me? Foolish thing, do you really think that you can defy the heavens? Not wasting time with you anymore, now, I’ll let you take a look at my true strength and send you on your way!”

Qian Ye’s long spear moved, the terrifying aura locked Ye Yuan down firmly.

“Heavenly Dragon Howling Fang Spear!”

The berserk world power rushed to the tip of the spear frenziedly.

It was as if that in this entire world, there was only this spear left.

At this moment, the people felt Qian Ye’s might.

That spear seemingly transformed into an enormous dragon, exhaling a breath that made people shudder.

“Not good, this spear is too powerful, Ye Yuan is in danger!”

When Baili Qingyan saw this spear, her beautiful face could not refrain from turning pale with fright.

But the woodcutter chuckled and said, “Don’t need to worry. Qian Ye has an ultimate move, but Ye Yuan’s ultimate move isn’t out yet!”

Sure enough, his voice had yet to fade and the aura on Ye Yuan’s body became stronger.

The surging chaos power poured out without any reservations.

The swift and fierce sword energy surged to the sky, at the same time, the surrounding space also became illusory.

“Spirit Concealing Sword!”

Two peerlessly powerful auras collided together violently.

At this moment, the void shattered, divine essence surging wildly. Everyone’s countenance changed visibly.

Crack!

Suddenly, the Junyi Sword in Ye Yuan’s hand could not withstand that terrifying pressure and actually fell apart!UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
