Chapter 2550: There’s Still a Long Way to Go!

There was silence. The sound of a needle falling could be heard!

Everyone present was collectively rendered speechless!

A Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was really formed!

After several breaths, the crowd suddenly exploded!

“Heavenly pill! He really refined a heavenly pill! A one point heavenly alchemist! He’s really a one point heavenly alchemist!”

“My goodness, I even thought that he was posturing! It turns out that he’s really awesome!”

“Something’s not right! Why does the aura of this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill feel stronger than Nation Teacher’s?”

… …

Previously, these people were still taunting and jeering, mocking Ye Yuan in various ways.

It was as if Ye Yuan was a clown.

But now, Ye Yuan used a single heavenly pill to make everyone shut up!

Shocked everyone!

Of course, what shocked them even more was the quality of this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

Judging from the aura, it was actually even stronger than Nation Teacher’s.

Of course, just how strong it was, it still needed to be tested before they would know.

Second Prince was stunned and muttered, “H-He really succeeded! B-But how is this possible? One point affinity! A one point affinity actually refined a heavenly pill!”

Clearly, he still could not quite believe the truth before his eyes.

But he knew that Master Yun gambled correctly!

Inconceivable!

Under the circumstances where there was absolutely no hope, he turned the tables!

Lu Yun was also unbelievably shocked. Until now, he still felt that he was dreaming.

He thought before that Ye Yuan could refine heavenly pills.

But he never thought that the quality of the heavenly pill that Ye Yuan refined was actually so good!

“If not for that his affinity is only one point, how could he have refined this Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill so strenuously?” Lu Yun smiled bitterly and said.

From Ye Yuan’s performance, one could tell how much effort he put in for today!

If not for the restriction of affinity, with Ye Yuan’s terrifying talent, he would have long already made Eastward Country submit at his feet!

What did a mere Lin Lan count for?

Lin Lan looked at that Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, a shocked expression on his face.

When the impossible became possible, nothing was more impactful than this.

“This … How is this possible? With one point affinity, he … he actually really refined a heavenly pill!” Lin Lan’s eyes were full of astonishment and disbelief.

Until now, he was also unwilling to believe that this was real!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Looks like you only cared about mocking just now and didn’t study well. Just a grade two heavenly alchemist, I wonder where your baffling self-confidence comes from. You must know, there’s a heaven beyond heaven. Lording over in this tiny little Eastward Country and posing as being number one in the world, you’ll only have this bit of strength forever. Refining pills need to harbor a heart of awe and veneration. It’s not that no one is stronger than you; it’s just that you haven’t encountered them.”

As he said, Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned, and sent the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that he refined to the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.

Light shone; one beam, two beams … FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Very soon, the light beams surpassed five.

At this time, everyone quietened down again, holding their breaths and staring fixedly at the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.

The fifth beam of light was still rising!

These people felt as though they were almost suffocating, as if even more nervous than them competing in alchemy themselves.

Gradually, the fifth light beam rose to more than half!

Same as Nation Teacher, upper fifth grade!

The sound of hearts shattering seemed to be able to be heard all around.

However, the light beam did not stop rising!

The fifth beam of light was full very soon.

However, it reached the sixth light beam without the least bit of suspense!

“Sixth grade! My God, a one point heavenly alchemist refined a sixth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! Crazy! It’s too crazy! I-It’s still rising!”

The clamoring voices rose and ebbed, lingering on incessantly!

That rising beam of light continuously refreshed their understanding!

From being impossible to possible.

From being possible to surpassing Nation Teacher.

From surpassing Nation Teacher to crushing Nation Teacher!

Progressing step by step, pressing harder with each step!

A one point affinity ascender had created too many miracles within this short time!

The light beam did not stop rising.

From lower sixth grade to middle sixth grade, and then to upper sixth grade!

Very soon, it closed in on the great hurdle of seventh grade!

Everyone was almost asphyxiating. Their eyes were glued on the light beam, wanting to know when it would stop!

The rising speed of the light beam began to slow down.

Finally, it arrived before the juncture of seventh grade!

Then, the light beam was like a stream of water that spilled over, breaking through the great hurdle of seventh grade.

Seventh grade!

“S-Seventh grade! A seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill! My God, I’ve never seen before such a high-quality Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill in my lifetime!”

“Really blinded my dog eyes! I actually thought that this ascender was a piece of trash!”

“Forget about Eastward Country; even in the entire True Yang Heavenly Domain, seventh grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills are also seldom-seen, right?”

… …

The light beam stopped at middle seventh grade in the end.

Ye Yuan looked at the light beam and heaved a slight sigh, muttering under his breath: “Just middle seventh grade? Indeed, there’s still a very long way to go!”

Clearly, he felt quite regrettable.

This was already his current limit.

To him, not reaching peak ninth grade was not considered a success at all.

The Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was the most basic heavenly pill. If even the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill could not reach grand completion, how could the road in the future be smooth?

High-rise buildings were raised from the ground up!

Ye Yuan had never relaxed his pursuit in alchemy before.

It was precisely this kind of stringent pursuit that was close to freakish that let him have today’s accomplishments.

Actually, the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was really too simple for Ye Yuan.

But, because of the constraints of affinity, he had not been able to achieve grand completion for a long time.

His instinct training still had not reached perfection.

It was just that when his words fell into the ears of bystanders, the posturing value increased infinitely.

Lin Lan’s face turned black, wishing to swing a slap over.

This posturing was too obvious, right?

Many onlookers were also extremely unhappy inwardly.

Middle seventh grade, this was already outrageously strong, alright?

But no one jumped out anymore at this time.

Fine, you’re amazing; posture however you like!

Actually, it was just the difference in worldview that led to a difference in understanding.

The things that you flaunted were merely other people’s daily life.

Although Ye Yuan was an ascender and was even still a newcomer in the cultivation of heavenly pills, his pursuit of Alchemy Dao was not what these people could understand at all.

He was just speaking his mind.

“Lord Nation Teacher, can the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that this Ye refined still enter your arcane sights?” Ye Yuan responded lightly.

Lin Lan’s expression changed. But without waiting for him to speak, Ye Yuan continued, “The pill has been refined too. Isn’t it time for Nation Teacher to fulfill the origin divinity contract?”

Lin Lan’s pupils constricted, he did not expect that he really lost!

Lost completely and utterly!

A grade two heavenly alchemist actually lost to a one point affinity ascender!

He had never even thought about such a thing before.

But now, at this point, he wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

He, the exalted nation teacher, Eastward alchemy path’s … former number one person, actually had to apologize to the Tang Family!

He clenched his jaws tightly and said in a solemn voice, “Those who attacked just now, cut off an arm yourselves and kowtow and apologize to the Tang Family father and son!”

“Nation Teacher! W-We-!”

Lin Lan’s gaze turned cold, and he said in a cold voice, “Why? Want this nation teacher to do it personally?”

Those few guards who attacked were practically all upper Lesser Sublime Heaven, their strength rather formidable.

Making them cut off an arm, they were naturally unwilling.

But at this time, it was not up to them anymore as well.
