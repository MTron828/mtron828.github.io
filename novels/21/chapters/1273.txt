Chapter 1277: A Storm Overnight Thaws It All Away!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Lingxue, I ...”

This poem was the last sentence Mu Lingxue said to Ye Yuan before she left the Medicine King Hall back then.

Ice sealing ten thousand miles, a thousand autumn snowfalls, seemed like it was just a grandiose snow-covered landscape.

Actually, it was Mu Lingxue questioning Ye Yuan.

Of course, it was also a sentence that expressed her true feelings.

Back then, she used this sentence to force Ye Yuan to pour his heart out.

But Ye Yuan fell silent.

He did not give a response!

Mu Lingxue smiled mournfully at that time, and left abruptly with a flick of her sleeves, and never turned her head back again.

The meaning of Mu Lingxue’s sentence was: if you don’t accept my true feelings, then my heart shall be locked in ice henceforth, and never open my heart for anyone again.

In this life, the door to my heart would only open for you!

Ye Yuan’s silence made Mu Lingxue heartbroken to the extreme. She returned to the Snowgod Palace from then and sealed off the gates.

Under this scene presently, Mu Lingxue asked this sentence once more!

“If you feel troubled, you can still choose to be silent,” Mu Lingxue still said with a faint smile.

“Haha, you, little girl, are really an infatuated one! It’s too bad that the heartless brook babbles on while the dropping flowers pine for love! You’ve done so much for him, but he doesn’t appreciate the favor at all. Presumably, even your life or death, he won’t care either!” Kanuo said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan’s face fell, and he said with seething killing intent, “Kanuo, if you dare to touch a hair of hers, this young master will make you never reincarnate for all of eternity!”

Kanuo burst into laughter and said, “Is that so? What if I were to make her never to reincarnate for all of eternity?”

Finished talking, an additional bone awl suddenly appeared in Kanuo’s hand and plunged straight into Mu Lingxue’s chest.

“Ugh ...”

A heart-piercing pain spread throughout Mu Lingxue’s entire body!

Mu Lingxue’s brows furrowed tightly, the originally already deathly pale face became even more without a trace of blood. But she stubbornly did not cry out in pain.

“Lingxue!” Ye Yuan exclaimed.

“Heh heh, the Soul Locking Nail’s prowess, you should know,” said Kanuo, as he looked at Ye Yuan with a smile that was not a smile.

The Soul Locking Nail’s prowess, Ye Yuan naturally knew it!

It was able to cause irreversible damage to the divine soul. Furthermore, this kind of damage was continuous!

It would torment the martial artist’s divine soul unceasingly until the divine soul was destroyed.

One could imagine just how much torment Mu Lingxue was currently suffering at this time.

Ye Yuan’s face was grim to the extreme, and he said in a solemn voice, “What the hell do you want?”

Kanuo said with a sinister smile, “You die, or she dies!”

“Ji Qingyun, you ... haven’t answered me!” Mu Lingxue said feebly.

This nail ramming down, Mu Lingxue’s vitality was seriously injured. But her two eyes stared at Ye Yuan even more incisively.

Ye Yuan’s mind trembled, and he blurted out, “A storm overnight thaws it all away! Lingxue, sorry, it is I who let you down ...”

Mu Lingxue’s chest heaved unsteadily. Even breathing became very difficult.

However, this sentence of Ye Yuan’s was like the warm sun in winter, instantly thawing her long already frozen heart.

She had never been so happy before!

The human race martial artists were all besotted by this smile of hers.

At this moment, they finally understood what was called toppling all life!

Even though they all knew that this smile only belonged to the Heaven Surmounting Divine King.

“With this sentence of yours, it’s enough!” Mu Lingxue said with a smile.

“Haha, what a fine pair of cruel fated mandarin ducks, parted in life and separated in death! It’s too bad that you guys have no chance to continue your former destiny anymore! Ye Yuan, I’m only giving you three breaths of time. Every three breaths that pass, I’ll drive a Soul Locking Nail into her body, now ... the countdown starts!” Kanuo said and burst into laughter.

Ye Yuan’s chest was almost exploding. He really did not know how to choose.

What was certain that upon his death, the Divine Realm would no longer have hope.

But, to make him helplessly watch Mu Lingxue be subjected to all kinds of torment and die, how could he do it?

This ... was an unsolvable question in the first place!

“Ye Yuan, I hope that you can grow to a ripe old age with her! With this sentence of yours, Lingxue has no regrets in death!”

Suddenly, Mu Lingxue incomprehensibly gave this sentence.

In her eyes was full of tenderness, making Ye Yuan feel like a knife was being twisted in his heart.

Only then did Ye Yuan know that Mu Lingxue was really very easy to satisfy.

The moment Kanuo heart, he let out a wild laugh and said, “Die? In front of this deity, you can’t die ... as you please! Your essence energy is sealed, divine essence is locked, use what to die? Hahaha ...”

Mu Lingxue’s eyes finally landed on Kanuo, but it was icy-cold.

“Kanuo, you captured me to threaten Qingyun. Actually, you didn’t know that this was also what I hoped for! If not for the sake of waiting until today, how could I give you this opportunity?”

Mu Lingxue gave a cold laugh. A freezing to the extreme aura emitted from her body.

This freezing to the extreme aura instantly swept across the entire stretch of heaven and earth!

The previous moment, it was still clear skies for ten thousand miles. The next instant, it was overcast with dark clouds.

Very soon, goose feather-like heavy snow fell.

“Lunatic! You mad woman! You ... How did you do it?”

Kanuo’s voice was filled with terror as if the end of the world had arrived.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, seemingly remembering something!

...

“Ye Yuan, do you know what the Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian’s most powerful move is?”

“The Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian is just a type of spirit physique. It’s also not a cultivation method or martial technique, what strongest move can there be still?”

“Of course! This is the move recorded in the Heaven Illusionary Ice Soul, it’s name is called Ice Sealing Ten Thousand Miles! Upon unleashing this move, within ten thousand miles will turn into an ice plain, snow falling in the sky for three years! Even peak Void Mystic powerhouses will also be frozen immediately!”

“So strong? Then isn’t your Snowgod Palace the true number one under the heavens? But why have I never heard of it before?”

“Because utilizing this move requires reversing the meridians and sacrificing the divine soul. It’s a mutual destruction move! If you don’t promise me, I’ll use this move and perish together with you!”

“Huhu, what kind of joke is this?”

“I’m not joking with you! Ji Qingyun, I’ll gift you a poem. If you can’t match with the second half, I’ll launch this move right now! Ice sealing ten thousand miles, a thousand autumn snowfalls!”

“...”

Mu Lingxue naturally did not unleash this move. She left.

Ye Yuan thought that she was joking all along, thinking that she only came up with this strategy in order to force himself.

He did not expect that she really unleashed it!

There really was this move!

A terrifying freezing air reverberated throughout heaven and earth; it was as if it could make time and space freeze. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The power of this move was truly very terrifying.

If it were before, this move was sufficient to freeze Ye Yuan to death.

But she knew that Ye Yuan, who had already become the number one person through the ages, did not care about this bit of cold air!

Her goal was suicide!

She used this move to break through Kanuo’s restrictions, destroying this trump card in Kanuo’s hand!

“Lingxue, stop! Quickly stop!”

Ye Yuan shouted until his throat hoarse, resounding through the clouds.

Ye Yuan’s figure instantly appeared beside Mu Lingxue, holding her in his arms.

When Kanuo saw this scene, his expression changed several times.

His figure moved; he sped away toward the horizon!

But right at this moment, a terrifying power of law descended from the sky, like a cage, thoroughly confining him.

Kanuo’s figure abruptly came to a stop. A shrill and miserable scream sounded out.
