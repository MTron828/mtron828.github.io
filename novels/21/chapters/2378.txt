Chapter 2384: Terrifying Guess!

“A terrific special existence! No wonder this emperor couldn’t calculate you no matter how I calculated! Perhaps you’re really sent by heaven to save the human race from extreme misery! It’s worth it for me to wait a thousand years here painstakingly!” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said.

But Ye Yuan shook his head when he heard that and said, “The one who saves the human race isn’t me, but you, Senior!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ pupils constricted and he said with a frown, “Do you know something?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I think I should know what it is. Looks like Senior has already started to move. Then coming to find me this time, do you want to recruit me?”

“How did you know?”

This shock of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was by no means insignificant.

The existence of Deicide was an absolute secret. Even among humans, there were extremely few people who knew about it too.

He could confirm that Deicide had never come into contact with Ye Yuan before. So how did this kid know?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, just take it as I guessed it.”

The matter of him traversing through spacetime was seriously too fantastical.

Even for Grand Ancestor Spacetime Shang Hang, it was also impossible to easily travel through time and space.

Therefore, him transmigrating back was absolutely just an accident.

Most likely, even Shang Hang did not expect it either.

But these words became even more mysterious and hard to fathom in Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ ears.

His gaze turned dark, and he said, “Alright. Since you’re not willing to say, then this ancestor won’t ask anymore. But I think that our aspiration should be the same, right?”

Ye Yuan’s actions and behavior, he had taken it into his sights.

Seemingly more brave than wise, but in reality, it was very meticulous.

More importantly, the influence of Ye Yuan’s battle was extremely far-reaching!

One could say, things that were not convenient for Deicide to do, Ye Yuan did it!

Previously, some things launched by Deicide became much more convenient.

In these 1000 years, although Jian Rufeng was not active in Deicide, he received the news over there one after another.

The invisible influence that this battle of Ye Yuan’s gave to people was too great.

In past understanding, the divine race was invincible.

But Ye Yuan’s appearance completely broke this curse.

He told the world that as long as your law comprehensions were strong enough, you could defeat, or even kill divine race powerhouses!

And this was also precisely the reason why Ye Yuan did so.

The human race was too ignorant, their understanding had already been deceived by the divine race, and needed someone to come and break this inherent understanding.

Since no one would do it, then it was up to him to do it.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “What Senior has done, Junior admires endlessly.”

Jian Rufeng said, “What you guessed is basically all correct. But there’s something that you go wrong. This ancestor isn’t here to solicit you, but to invite you to Deicide to be the chief instructor!”

This time, it was Ye Yuan’s turn to be surprised. He thought that Jian Rufeng was going to focus on grooming him.

However, Jian Rufeng actually invited him to go back and nurture others!

He was truly unable to predict this result.

“Senior, did you make a mistake? You look, I’m only a Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor!” Ye Yuan said suspiciously.

Although a thousand years had already passed, his realm only increased to late-stage World Realm, equivalent to Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

This bit of cultivation should be considered much when placed in Deicide.

Making him go and teach people, would those Deva Realm powerhouses be convinced?

But Jian Rufeng said firmly, “You don’t need to suspect anything. This ancestor hasn’t reached a point where I’m muddleheaded with age. Although there are many experts in Deicide, in terms of law comprehensions, they are far worse than you! What you’re worse than them is just cultivation realm. This isn’t impossible to make up for.”

In the eyes of true geniuses, cultivation realm was never a disparity.

True disparity was in terms of laws!

“The various races were suppressed by the divine race, extremely limited in terms of law comprehensions! The human race looks like they have a huge population, but there aren’t many true experts. Those Deva Realm powerhouses mostly succeeded in transcending the tribulations by a fluke. In terms of combat power, some Deva Realms are not even as good as the divine race’s peak Eight-marks! Hence, it’s not that the various races don’t want to revolt, but that they are completely powerful to revolt!” Jian Rufeng said with a solemn expression.

When Ye Yuan heard, he revealed a thoughtful look.

No wonder when he returned to the previous epoch, he discovered that the martial artists here were not as powerful as he had imagined.

According to what he had seen and heard in the other time and space, the ancient times should have been when the human race was the most glorious.

This era had countless powerhouses!

Each one was a powerhouse who shocked the heavens.

Especially the 18 grand ancestors, those were terrifying existences who could contend with the divine race’s progenitors.

But even a peerless genius like Qin Chao was pitifully weak regardless of whether it was cultivation method or martial technique.

This was clearly not too logical.

Even when Empyrean Vast Universe passed him the bone sword, he also had a contemptuous look on his face toward the later generations’ human geniuses.

As for Grand Ancestor Spacetime Shang Hang, that went even more without saying.

But when Ye Yuan returned to this era, he discovered that this was not the case at all.

This was also to say that the human race had not reached its most glorious time yet!

Hang on!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan thought of a certain possibility, and his expression changed wildly, monstrous waves surging in his heart!

“The previous generation Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets is still alive. The 18 grand ancestors have not appeared yet. The human race hasn’t welcomed its most glorious era yet!”

“The human race is weak, yet, there are so many geniuses in this era! What they lack isn’t geniuses but inheritances!”

“Spiritual energy is abundant, geniuses are plentiful like oxen hair, all prerequisites for the human race to be strong are already provided for! One can say that everything was ready except for a crucial element!”

“Currently, the previous generation Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets asked him to go back and be the chief instructor, doesn’t that mean that the grand event that Shang Hang spoke about, had a lot to do with me?”

“Could it be that ... the incomparably glorious era of the human race later on, it was actually single handedly created by me?”

“This ... This is also too ridiculous, right?”

Ye Yuan’s mind spun like lightning, a terrifying idea forming in his mind.

Although this idea was extremely absurd, the more he analyzed it, the more likely he felt that it was!

Because in terms of time, this era’s Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets should be sacrificing himself not long after.

If not for him, who else did the human race have who could step forward, and impart them the true Great Dao?

Jian Rufeng himself also said those so-called powerhouses were no good at all in terms of law comprehension!

Although Ye Yuan’s own law comprehensions had not reached the acme of perfection yet, the comprehension of laws varied from person to person in the first place.

What he had to do was not to hold their hands and teach one by one, but it was to teach them how to enter the Dao!

As long as he brought them along on the journey, they would develop powerful cultivation methods and martial techniques themselves, and walk toward the true summit!

Just like Spacetime Reversal Chaos this move, if Ye Yuan’s own spacetime law continued developing, it absolutely would not evolve this move.

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan was filled with fear.

This was too terrifying!

Then what exactly was he?

Was he a person of this era, or someone of that era?

His entire person became ruffled in an instant.

“Spacetime! Spacetime! What the hell are you? What on earth am I? Where the hell am I right now? Who in the world am I?”

Ye Yuan shouted crazily in his heart, he wanted to figure all this out.

But, no matter how he shouted, it was to no avail too.
