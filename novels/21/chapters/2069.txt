Chapter 2073: Looks Like You Don’t Have Much Confidence!

In Skyreturn Plaza, people were everywhere.

A Seven-star Alchemy God taking action, this was a grand event of Jiu Luo Ji.

Ye Yuan issuing a challenge letter to challenge Empyrean Loneswan spread throughout the entire Jiu Luo Ji like the wind.

“Eldest Senior Brother, you were also too sloppy. Having Master compete in alchemy with a snotty brat, this is disgraceful!’ Song Cao’s junior apprentice brother, Luo Yu, said with a disdainful look.

Another junior apprentice brother said, “Isn’t making Master compete in alchemy with this brat pretty much the same as having Master compete in alchemy with us? This kind of alchemy battle doesn’t have the slightest suspense at all.”

Song Cao smiled coldly and said, “What the hell do you guys know! That kid has a wine recipe in his hands. Once we obtain it, we can definitely earn boatloads of money! At that time, Northday Assemble’s Empyrean Dragonjade and Splitwind Assemble’s Empyrean Junhao will all have to bow their heads in submission toward Master!”

The moment Luo Yu heard this, he said in puzzlement, “Senior Apprentice Brother, is this wine really as good as you say?”

Song Cao had a look of recollecting the aftertaste as he said, “More than good! It simply brings back endless aftertastes! Senior Apprentice Brother, I, only drank a mouth, and during this half a month, my whole body has been warm! I don’t even need to use divine essence to ward off the cold with divine fire at all! Delicious plus keeps out the cold, who do you think can resist its allure in this Northernmost Steppe?”

The apprentice brothers were all skeptical. Since Eldest Senior Brother came back from Raging Fire Tavern the last time, his mouth kept on praising this whatever Sunshine Glow with endless praises, as if he was bedeviled.

Seeing him always talk about it every day, these few people also could not help drooling.

Among the people in this Northernmost Steppe, there was none who did not like to drink.

Hearing that it was so delicious, how could they not be moved?

Except, those who had drunk before this Sunshine Glow at present was just Song Cao and Wu Song two people.

Whether it really tasted good or not, they were also not sure.

But they understood in their hearts that if it was really as Song Cao said, then as long as this wine was rolled out, it could absolutely sweep across the extreme north’s various territories.

“He’s here, he’s here! It’s this boy? So young!”

At this time, there was suddenly a commotion in the crowd. A ridiculously young figure slowly walked onto the stage.

“This ... This is also too young, right? Just like a little kid, he’s qualified to challenge Empyrean Loneswan?”

“Where did this kid pop out from? Simply blaspheming the idol in my heart!”

“Get down!”

... ...

When the people saw that Ye Yuan was so young, they immediately exploded, having a feeling of being cheated.

So young, he probably had not even figured out what were medicinal pills and came to challenge Jiu Luo Ji’s Alchemy Dao number one person. Was this a joke?

With someone taking the lead to hoot, many people also shouted along, asking Ye Yuan to get down.

Ye Yuan had an indifferent look as if he could not hear anything.

After a while, these guys would naturally shut up.

When Luo Yu saw that Ye Yuan was so young, he was also stunned and said disdainfully, “Heh, really a fool who overestimates his own ability. So young and he actually dares to challenge Master too, truly ignorant!”

But Song Cao said in a solemn voice, “I don’t know how’s his pill refinement, but his fire controlling technique is truly transcendent! If this wasn’t the case, why would I make Master take action? I would have suppressed him myself!”

Luo Yu was surprised when he heard that and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, you really lost to him in a fire battle?”

Song Cao’s expression was slightly dark as he nodded his head.

Luo Yu did not quite dare to believe it. He was naturally aware of Song Cao’s fire controlling technique. Even he was a million miles away compared to Song Cao’s skill.

But such a formidable eldest senior brother actually lost to this kid. Could it be that he was really an alchemy genius?

Right at this time, a powerful aura descended from the sky.

“Empyrean Loneswan is here!”

“All thanks to this brat that I can see Empyrean Loneswan’s true face!”

“Lord Loneswan, teach this punk a good lesson!”

... ...

There was cheering in the crowd.

Empyrean Loneswan was a godlike existence in their hearts.

In this Northernmost Steppe, a Seven-star Alchemy God was the sun in the sky, illuminating the world.

A brat like Ye Yuan rushing into challenging Empyrean Loneswan was blaspheming the idol in their hearts.

An old man in azure robes slowly stepped out of the void. His gaze swept all around, his awe displayed in its entirety.

“Disciple pays respect to Master!” Song Cao brought the group of apprentice brothers and directly knelt down.

Empyrean Loneswan nodded slightly, his gaze finally landing on Ye Yuan. He could not help being slightly surprised.

Ye Yuan’s youth still far exceeded his expectations.

“You’re the Ji Qingyun who wants to challenge this Empyrean?” Empyrean Loneswan’s gaze was scorching as he said.

The moment he came up, he applied tremendous pressure on Ye Yuan.

Except, Ye Yuan was composed and collected in front of this pressure, and even had signs of being able to stand up to it as an equal.

When Empyrean Loneswan saw the situation, he could not help being surprised in his heart.

How could he know that even when Ye Yuan was facing Empyrean Pilljade, that level of horrifying existence, his aura was also not the slightest bit weak?

His bit of pressure was too much of a child’s play and even had some suspicion of showing off in the presence of an expert.

“It’s precisely this Ji!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Empyrean Loneswan deliberately pretended to be magnanimous as he said, “Indeed, heroes come from youngsters! To dare come and challenge this Empyrean at a young age, your courage is commendable! Rest assured, this Empyrean won’t be bullying the weak by being strong. In a while, when this Empyrean takes action, I’ll definitely pay attention to the proper limits. Uh ... you pick the medicinal pill then.”

This battle was simply a piece of cake to him.

It was just that his acting was the demeanor of a grandmaster in the view of those people below. He was tolerant and open-minded.

“Indeed well-deserving of being Empyrean Loneswan! Toward a young man’s affront, he’s actually not angry at all and even has the intention of guiding him.”

“Heh, you look at that kid! His proud appearance really pisses people off!”

... ...

Actually, how was there any pride? Ye Yuan just had a calm expression, that was all.

It was just that in the view of these people, when Ye Yuan saw a powerhouse like Empyrean Loneswan, he should be reverent and respectful, trembling with fear and trepidation, akin to treading on thin ice.

Only that way would it be apt for Ye Yuan’s status.

Ye Yuan gave Empyrean Loneswan a glance and said with a strange expression, “Really want me to pick?”

Empyrean Loneswan could not help laughing as he said, “This Empyrean is a Seven-star Alchemy God. Battling in alchemy with you, a junior, could it be still let this Empyrean pick?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said indifferently, “In that case ... Crimson Flame Heavenly Soul Pill then.”

Empyrean Loneswan’s gaze turned sharp, almost choking to death.

This Crimson Flame Heavenly Soul Pill was one of the medicinal pills with the greatest difficulty among rank six divine pills.

Even refining it with his current strength, the success rate was also not high.

Furthermore, even if it succeeded, the grade would not be too high either.

He opened his mouth, wanting to speak, but he did not know what he should say.

Say that he could refine?

What to do if he screwed it up? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Saying that he could not refine?

Did he have shame or not?!

“Junior, you’re deliberately here to mess with this Empyrean, right? This medicinal pill, you probably can’t even learn the rudiments, right?” Empyrean Loneswan said with a dark expression.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “Looks like you don’t have much confidence in refining the Crimson Flame Heavenly Soul Pill. Then why not ... the Amethyst Instant Pill then.”

Empyrean Loneswan nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood. Don’t dig up people’s dirt like this!

Furthermore ... it was another level nine medicinal pill!

He was already very sure that this kid was definitely here to mess with him.

Could he have been ... sent by those few fellows?
