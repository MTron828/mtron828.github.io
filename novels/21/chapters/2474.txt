Chapter 2480: This Was What You Said!

With three great progenitors taking action at the same time, the power was truly heaven-shocking.

The spectacular sight of the Doomsday Battle was virtually being put on show again.

Furthermore, Bo Yi’s strength was second only to Tian Qing in the entire divine race!

His addition turned the tide of the battle all at once.

Even with the eighth true dragon spirit, it was also counter-pressured by the three great progenitors.

The three great progenitors activated their Heavenly Dao True Martials, forcing until the eight true dragon spirits were unable to get close. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the might of the divine race’s progenitors were displayed in its entirety.

However, what was even more shocking was still Ye Yuan!

Ancestor Fire opened his mouth wide and said with a look of shock, “This … This is also too monstrous, right? He actually forcefully resisted three great divine race progenitors with his power alone? This is him not entering the realm of rule yet. If he reached the realm of rule, with his fused rule coupled with this kind of earth-shaking physical strength, who can still be his match?”

Lin Chaotian frowned and said, “To us, it’s a calamity! Not a blessing!”

Lin Chaotian’s expression flickered incessantly, not knowing whether to be happy or to be sad.

Concerning Ye Yuan threatening the divine race with his power alone, they naturally welcomed it.

But he similarly knew that his enmity with Ye Yuan was big!

The stronger Ye Yuan’s strength was, the harder he would find it to eat and sleep.

But the other human powerhouses did not have their worries.

Each and every one of them danced for joy, seeing the hope of new life!

Ye Yuan’s strength forcibly hurled them out of despair.

“Lord Saint Azure is mighty!”

“Lord Saint Azure is overwhelming, suppressing the divine race!”

“Hahaha?… Lord Saint Azure, it really blinded my dog eyes! With your strength, how can you possibly lose to the divine race?”

… …

Ye Yuan’s prestige was exceedingly high in the human race to begin with.

Currently, he made a grand display of invincible might, fighting three progenitors by himself. It exerted this glory to the extreme even more.

The human race powerhouses, regardless of whether male, female, old, or young, their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan was like looking at a divine buddha!

Currently, Ye Yuan was no longer a person in their hearts, but a totem!

They firmly believed that Ye Yuan would lead them to victory!

But at this time, sweat also oozed out of Ye Yuan’s forehead slightly.

Summoning eight true dragon spirits, the burden was still too heavy to him!

However, his hand-seal changed again!

Seeing this scene, Tian Qing’s expression changed wildly, and he cried out in surprise, “Damn it, this brat wouldn’t really be summoning nine true dragon spirits, right?”

His voice had yet to fade when there was a violent shaking in the void.

A golden dragon head slowly extended out.

As if feeling the appearance of the ninth true dragon spirit, the other eight actually increased greatly in strength and launched a counteroffensive frenziedly.

Long Yi as the Dragon Clan’s highest chief almost jumped up in agitation.

“The ninth true dragon spirit! This is a scene that surpasses the ancients and amazes the contemporaries! Nine dragons arriving simultaneously, invincible under the heavens! Once the ninth true dragon spirit arrives, what does Tian Qing count as? My dragon race clan will be able to suppress the divine race!” Long Yi was agitated until his entire body trembled.

This scene was seriously too soul-stirring.

But at this time, Ye Yuan’s complexion became paler and paler, appearing rather strained.

The ninth true dragon spirit was not like before, it came out very slowly.

But with every little bit that the true dragon spirit came out, the strength of these eight true dragons would rise by a level!

Their strength was skyrocketing!

Originally, three great progenitors already suppressed the eight true dragon spirits.

But now, both sides were already equally matched in strength!

Tian Qing’s pupils constricted, he was also startled by this scene.

Looking at this stance, if the ninth true dragon spirit really came out, it would probably really suppress even him too!

He sucked in a cold breath, his expression ugly as he said, “This brat is without an end!”

He shouted crazily in his heart, don’t come out, don’t come out!

If Ye Yuan summoned the ninth true dragon spirit out now, then it would really be over for the divine race.

But the ninth true dragon spirit was still slowly coming out.

Before long, the three progenitors were suppressed by the eight true dragons again, without the slightest strength to fight back.

However, right at this time, all of a sudden, Ye Yuan spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his seal directly being interrupted.

The ninth true dragon spirit directly dissipated without a trace with a bang.

The trembling of the void finally stopped.

Ye Yuan’s breath being interrupted, those eight true dragon spirits were also unable to maintain their figures, roaring a few times in the air. They finally disappeared without a trace.

Over on humanity’s side, there was a uniform sigh.

“Sigh!?Just a little, just missing one last bit! A pity! What a shame!” Long Yi smacked his thigh and said with endless regrets.

Nine dragons arriving simultaneously, shaking the heavens and startling the earth!

This kind of spectacular and sacred scene, it was missing just a bit more!

Originsmile, Yi Feng, Bo Yi, three great progenitors, all had disorderly breathing, looking at Ye Yuan with incomparable shock.

They never dreamed that they would actually be forced into such a state.

When Tian Qing saw this scene, he secretly sighed in relief at his good fortune.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan’s blood vitality power was not enough to summon the ninth true dragon spirit.

Otherwise, they would really have to head back home.

Ye Yuan gasped heavily for air, his entire person dead-tired.

He practically drained his blood vitality empty in order to summon the nine true dragon spirits.

Becoming weak at this time made sense too.

But right then, a punk shadow flashed and landed below Ye Yuan’s body, and propped him up, putting him on its back.

Grunt! Grunt!

This ink figure was precisely Treasure Pig!

Treasure Pig’s appearance also made Tian Qing’s expression change.

He already heard that this pig could rival two great Dao Ancestors, its strength fearsome!

There was still such a powerful existence by Ye Yuan’s side.

Ye Yuan leaned on Treasure Pig, looked at Tian Qing from afar, and said coolly, “Tian Qing, I wonder if my threat is considered a threat or not? You also know that I haven’t stepped into the realm of rule yet! After I reach the realm of rule, how much confidence do you have in dealing with me?”

Tian Qing’s expression was very ugly, he was actually threatened by someone!

He, Tian Qing, battled through the nine heavens and ten earths. Even when he encountered Grand Ancestor Spacetime, that kind of peerless character, he also fought until he perished, his Dao dissipating.

But today, he was actually being threatened by someone!

But he knew that what Ye Yuan said was not wrong at all!

The Heavenspan World’s myriad races, no one could enter his arcane sights.

Even Dao Ancestor Life, Lin Chaotian, could not as well!

He only dreaded one person. That person was Ye Yuan!

If it were before, Ye Yuan’s threat would naturally have been nothing.

But now, Ye Yuan battled three great progenitors by himself. This potential was too terrifying.

After Ye Yuan stepped into the realm of rule, coupled with such a formidable to the extreme physical body, he could simply be rated as invincible.

The most important thing was that Ye Yuan could not be killed!

This threat was a real threat!

Tian Qing fell silent!

Over on humanity’s side, all of the powerhouses had invigorated expressions on their faces.

Something that even the nine great Dao Ancestors could not accomplish, Ye Yuan did it!

He forced the divine race’s number one person, Tian Qing, to hesitate with his astonishing strength!

After a long time, Tian Qing’s gaze turned sullen and he said, “The divine race can enter the Heavenspan World! This was what you said!”

Ye Yuan grinned and said with a nod, “I said it! To the east of Heavenspan Mountain, it belongs to the human race! To the west of Heavenspan Mountain, it belongs to the divine race!”
