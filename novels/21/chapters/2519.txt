Chapter 2525: Yang Manor Storm!

Without the guidance of a cultivation method, Ye Yuan’s realm had never consolidated all along.

Therefore, he was not considered a true Heavenly Stratum powerhouse right now.

But, with a single circulatory cycle, his cultivation realm was already completely consolidated!

Now, he was already a true lower Lesser Sublime Heaven!

“What a miraculous cultivation method! No wonder Yan Jadetrue could rely on this cultivation method to command the Five Great Heavenly Regions back then!” Ye Yuan said in shock inwardly.

Although he had never cultivated it, he had studied Jun Tian’s cultivation method before.

Wanting to consolidate one’s cultivation realm required revolving a thousand circulatory cycles no matter what.

But Ye Yuan only revolved a single circulatory cycle, and his realm was already consolidated.

This was also to say that the Wordless Heavenly Skill’s cultivation method was a thousand times better than ordinary cultivation methods!

It was clear at a glance which was superior or inferior.

A series of footsteps interrupted Ye Yuan’s excitement.

It was Gui Tianyu!

He came before Ye Yuan and said with an unfriendly look, “Brat, don’t think I don’t know what wicked idea you’re plotting! I’m warning you, stay further away from Yang Xuezhen. Otherwise, you’ll die very horribly!”

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him and walked right past him.

Ignored!

Gui Tianyu was greatly enraged and was just about to fly off the handle, but he saw Yang Xuezhen suddenly appear. She said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Tianyu, Ye Yuan, it’s time to set off.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Coming.”

Looking at the two people’s departing back view, Gui Tianyu’s heart burned with fury.

… …

The party got out of Inklight Forest and headed straight for Eastward Country.

They were travel-worn all the way. Finally, after three days, they rushed to Eastward Country’s imperial city.

There was a mansion that occupied a rather large territory in front of them, it was precisely the Yang Manor.

The Yang Family was a small family clan in Eastward Country but also rather prosperous.

Yang Xuezhen’s talent was pretty good and was selected by Thousand Crane Sect to become a disciple.

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu were both from major family clans in the imperial city too; much stronger than the Yang Family.

The Yang Family and Li Family had a long history of hatred because of friction in their operations.

It was just that one month plus ago, Yang Xuezhen received news from the Yang Family that Yang Xuezhen’s father was actually beaten to death by the Li Family’s family head, Li Batian.

The Yang Family immediately fell into a crisis.

After Yang Xuezhen received the news, she naturally rushed back at once without stopping.

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu had been courting Yang Xuezhen for some time already. Seeing this opportunity, how could they be willing to let it go. Hence, they took the initiative to follow.

After all, with the statuses of the Lu Family and Gui Family, the Li Family would not dare to go too far as well.

“Halt!” The Yang Family’s family guards directly stopped everyone.

Yang Xuezhen’s expression changed and she scolded angrily, “Tian Ming, Yan Yi, what are you guys doing? Don’t even recognize me anymore?”

Tian Ming said coolly, “Miss, there are distinguished guests in the family right now. You all wait outside for a moment!”

Yang Xuezhen had a blank look and said in shock, “What distinguished guests? Even I can’t go in too? Are you guys rebelling?”

At this time, Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu blocked in front of her at the same time.

Lu Yuanjie said with a cold snort, “Lowly lackey, get lost! Otherwise, this young master will kill you guys right now!”

Gui Tianyu scolded angrily, “Dogs who are threatening people under the protection of your master! Take a look at who this young master is!”

Tian Ming’s expression changed, only then, recognizing the arrivals, and he hurriedly said, “Turns out that it’s Young Master Lu, Young Master Gui, please forgive me!”

“Get lost!”

Tian Ming two people’s faces changed and they could only give in.

Lu Yuanjie had a proud look and said to Yang Xuezhen, “Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen, rest assured. With me around, everything will be fine!”

Gui Tianyu smiled and said, “Junior Apprentice Sister, you don’t need to worry. I reckon that this Li Family won’t be able to set off any waves!”

Yang Xuezhen’s heart was in turmoil. How could she hear these two people’s showing off?

She, the Yang Family’s young miss could not enter, but the Lu Family’s young master could enter?

What on earth happened to the Yang Family?

The party entered the Yang Family and went straight to the meeting hall.

A youth currently had a fawning look, pouring tea for another young man.

The youth hunched his back and said with a flattering smile, “Elder Brother Qiu, please drink tea! Don’t you worry. After my elder sister comes back, I’ll definitely have her take the initiative to marry Elder Brother Qiu!”

The young man picked up his tea and said with a nod,?“Mn,

?you, boy, still knows how to appreciate kindness; not like that stubborn old guy from your family, impenetrably thickheaded!”

The youth nodded his head repeatedly and said, “Yes, yes, yes! Yang Yu that old fellow should have long handed the position of family head over! He clung conservatively to the old system, this is pushing the Yang Family into the fire pit! Fortunately, he died. Now, my mother calls the shots in the Yang Family, everything can be discussed!”

The young man glanced at the youth and said with a loud laugh,?“Hahaha?… Well said! Well said!’

By the side, Yang Xuezhen was long already angered until she was trembling, almost fainting away.

“Yang … Jin! Y-You unfilial son! To actually suck up to your father’s killer, aren’t you scared of being struck by lightning?” Yang Xuezhen practically roared it out.

That youth was precisely her younger brother born from the same father, but a different mother, Yang Jin.

And the young man sitting in the hall was the Li Family, Li Batian’s only son, Li Zhengqiu!

How great the impact of this scene was to Yang Xuezhen could only be imagined!

Her father died. Not only did her younger brother not want to take revenge, he actually even showed great courtesy to his father’s killer, and even cursed his own father for clinging conservatively to the old system!

And he even … wanted to deliver her to the Li Family to be married off!

This was simply too unscrupulous!

Hearing this roar, Yang Jin was clearly stunned too.

After seeing Yang Xuezhen, he smiled and said, “Sis, you’re finally back! Just nice, Big Brother Qiu is here. You guys catch up. After all, you guys are good friends that grew up together. Later, pick a date and you’ll marry over to the Li Family. You don’t need to return to the Thousand Crane Sect anymore too.”

Yang Xuezhen did not do anything, but Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu flew into a great rage.

Lu Yuanjie arrived in front of Li Zhengqiu with a lunge and said angrily, “Li Zhengqiu, who the hell do you think you are, to also dare covet Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen? Scram for Your Father right now, otherwise, you’ll crawl out!”

Gui Tianyu arrived right after, pointed at Li Zhengqiu’s nose, and said, “Li Zhengqiu, you also don’t take a piss and look at your own reflection, a toad lusting after swan meat??Heh,?go over and apologize to Junior Apprentice Sister Xuezhen, and this matter will be considered over! Otherwise, not just you, your Li Family … just wait and see!”

The two originally thought that Li Zhengqiu would be quivering with fright, then apologize and beg them for forgiveness subserviently.

But sadly, Li Zhengqiu did not!

He drank a mouthful of tea lightly and said coolly, “Gentlemen, I’m afraid … this can’t be done! I came today to the Yang Family to give the betrothal gift. The Yang Family has already accepted the betrothal gift. A match is made on the parents’ order and the word of the matchmaker, Yang Xuezhen will be my woman in the future! As for the two of you, better don’t be unreasonable and make a scene here. Otherwise, bear the consequences yourselves.”

Lu Yuanjie and Gui Tianyu were not fools either. They did not get angry for no reason.

This opportunity was hard to come by. Whoever could handle this matter, Yang Xuezhen would definitely look at him in a different light.

Things would be easier to handle in the future.

It was just that now, Li Zhengqiu’s attitude made them unable to save their faces.

They were genuinely enraged!

“Wow, gotten cocky?huh!?Li Zhengqiu, just the likes of a random nobody like you also dares to posture in front of this young master, is that it?” Gui Tianyu laughed coldly, the imposing aura on his body erupting.

Middle Lesser Sublime Heaven!

Lu Yuanjie was the same, saying with a sneer, “Li Zhengqiu, who gave you the courage to dare to posture in front of this young master?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“It’s me. Do you guys have any objections?”
