Chapter 2399: Ten Billion Years as a Place to Cultivate!

“Lord Profound Secrets, your words are too much, right? Without him, there won’t be us? These words sound really strange!” Pang Zhen said in a solemn voice.

At this time, only he dared to speak up.

But his words indeed represented the inner-voices of the unpredictable children.

Profound Secrets did not speak, but Shang Hang laughed coldly and said, “That’s because you all don’t know how great the contributions Azure and Profound Dual Saints made to the myriad races! These two people created an era! Saint Profound, who is also Profound Secrets brat’s father, offered up the lives of 100 Jian clan members as the price, to ignite the sun of heaven’s secrets, and conceal heaven’s secrets, winning a respite for the human race! Saint Azure, left behind 18 inheritance grand arrays, and created 18 grand ancestors as well as countless powerhouses for the myriad races! Otherwise, who do you all think these ten billion years of prosperity and stability were captured by?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If you all don’t know how strong grand ancestors are, then this ancestor will tell you guys!”

As he said, he pointed at Ancestor Lightning and said with a proud expression, “When this ancestor was at my prime, even if he’s augmented by rule, he might not be this ancestor’s match too! Of course, if Heavenly Dao takes back his power of rule, it’s as easy as turning my hand over ... for this ancestor to kill him!”

“Hiss ...”

All around, came a series of cold air being sucked in sounds.

This statement completely subverted their imagination.

Weren’t Dao Ancestors invincible existences?

This old man before their eyes was actually so strong at his heyday?

The 18 Dao Ancestor level powerhouses ... This was simply unimaginable!

This kind of horrifying strength actually lost to the divine race!

The divine race was actually so strong!

Profound Secrets nodded his head and added, “The last Doomsday Battle was fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open, mountains and rivers shattering! The 18 grand ancestors all died; the myriad races had countless powerhouses who perished! But even so, we failed to completely defeat the divine race too! You all can imagine how strong the divine race is! Therefore, without Saint Azure, even if my father ignited the sun of heaven’s secrets, the myriad races would have ultimately ended in failure too! If that was the case, it would have likely caused a catastrophic blow to the myriad races, where will you all come from?”

“Therefore ... you all can be disrespectful toward this emperor, but absolutely can’t be disrespectful towards Saint Azure! From today onwards, if anyone dares to be disrespectful towards Saint Azure, once it reaches this emperor’s ears, this emperor will hunt him down to the ends of the world!”

The group of unpredictable children was dumbstruck with amazement from listening.

This secret from ten billion years ago, they had never heard it before.

The era was too distant, they were simply unable to imagine, what kind of extreme misery the myriad races were living in back then.

These two people’s words exploded in their ears like claps of thunder.

Only then did they know how tragic the previous Doomsday Battle was.

Only then did they know how strong the ancient time myriad race powerhouses were!

Compared to the ancient times, the current myriad races powerhouses were simply trash!

No wonder Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets would raise such a big rumpus, gathering a million unpredictable children to undergo the battle of geniuses.

Pang Zhen had a dumbfounded look and could not resist asking Ancestor Lightning, “A-Ancestor, is what he said true? A-Aren’t Dao Ancestors ... invincible existences?”

Ancestor Lightning’s expression was somewhat ugly, but he still nodded his head and said, “When Senior Shang was at his prime, he can annihilate Deva Fifth Blights with one hand! His spacetime law already reached an inconceivable level! If this ancestor doesn’t rely on the power of law, I’m not his match at all!”

“This ... How is this possible?”

“Not Dao Ancestor, but stronger than Dao Ancestors?!”

“Can a person’s strength actually reach such a terrifying level?”

... ...

With Ancestor Lightning acknowledging that he was inferior to Shang Hang, the crowd immediately burst into an uproar.

Even a Dao Ancestor was not a match, what kind of terrifying existence was that?

Then what kind of monster was the Saint Azure who could groom such a terrifying existence?

Everyone opened their mouths wide, looking at Ye Yuan in shock.

Were all these really done by him?

Yu Tanzhi’s expression flickered indeterminately and he said in a solemn voice, “Lord Profound Secrets, but what has this got to do with Ye Yuan? What Saint Azure has done, this junior admires endlessly too! But Ye Yuan is someone from ten billion years later. So how can he possibly go to the ancient times to teach you all? Furthermore, just his bit of strength, what right does he have to have taught a character like Grand Ancestor Spacetime? Also, even if he traveled through spacetime this time, he wasn’t even born yet ten billion years ago, how could he have taught you all? Could it be that everything that happened today is actually still ten billion years ago? None of these makes sense!”

Clearly, he still did not believe it.

Yu Tanzhi’s series of questions was the key to this issue!

Ten billion years ago, Ye Yuan’s grandfather’s grandfather was not even born yet. How did Ye Yuan go and teach them?

Profound Secrets’s brows furrowed slightly. Clearly, he could not answer this question either.

But he was certain that Ye Yuan was Saint Azure!

This was indisputable!

“Saint Azure came out of thin air and also left baselessly! Before my father died, he saw a trace of heaven’s secrets too. He said that the things that Saint Azure is shouldering, we’re all unable to understand it! But now, this emperor understands!” Profound Secrets said in a solemn voice.

Yu Tanzhi was still unrelenting as he said, “If all these were just a coincidence? Didn’t you, Lord Profound Secrets, not have seen Saint Azure’s true face too?”

As long as he proved that Ye Yuan was not Saint Azure, everything could be discussed!

What right did Ye Yuan have to become Saint Azure?

But these words really stumped Profound Secrets.

“Humph! You brat, what the hell do you know? The profundities of time and space, these two great supreme laws, forget about you, even this ancestor can hardly get a complete picture too!”

At this time, Shang Hang snorted coldly and said, “Do you know why Spacetime Reversal Chaos this move is called this name? Heh heh, this ancestor has only used this move once in my lifetime. That’s in that battle to deal with Tian Qing! Because once this move is used, even I can’t control the direction of time and space too! This ancestor can’t beat Tian Qing and can only exile him to the spacetime turbulence!”

“Under this move, spacetime will turn chaotic. Those who are exiled will forever be lost in the chaotic spacetime! Lord Saint Azure triggered the Spacetime Reversal Chaos, a reverse chaos happened between these two spacetime! The events of the two spacetime really happened. It’s just that because of the disorder of spacetime, the order is already not important! Or should I say, the spacetime of these ten billion years is all chaotic! Now, Lord Saint Azure returned. Only now is the spacetime of these ten billion years considered complete!”

“These 300 years, he leaped across spacetime and took back the name of Saint Azure! These ten billion years of spacetime, it is merely Saint Azure’s place to cultivate! His accomplishments in spacetime law in the future will be far above this ancestor’s! As long as he’s given sufficient time, he’ll be able to sweep away the divine race by himself!”

In terms of understanding spacetime law, no one in this world could compare to Shang Hang.

This explanation of his shocked everyone even more until they were dumbstruck with amazement.

Regarding the spacetime samsara of ten billion years as his own training land.

This kind of means was simply inconceivable!

Spacetime law, it was simply hard for ordinary people to surmise!

They were not tangible and material like other laws. They really existed, but could not be touched at all.

Furthermore, when they reached an extremely profound level, it was even harder for ordinary people to imagine.
