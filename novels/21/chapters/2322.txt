Chapter 2326: Reinforcements Arrive

Ye Yuan was bringing along a wave of powerhouses and currently fighting while retreating when suddenly, a powerful to the extreme aura arrived from afar.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed wildly and immediately realized that Originguard had lost it!

There was no time to think too much. Ye Yuan directly did a greater teleportation and left the team.

“Ji Mo, bring Yun Yi they all away. I’ll go and lure that old fellow away!”

Ye Yuan threw behind this sentence and left in a hurry.

Sure enough, the moment he left, the two did not say a word and chased right after.

But currently, Ye Yuan already comprehended eighth firmament spatial law, his speed of shuttling through the void was quick to the extreme. Originguard could not catch up in a short while too.

“Kid, no matter up in the heavens or down below the earth, this ancestor will tear your corpse to pieces.”

Originguard’s voice revealed a bone-piercingly cold intent, exhibiting his current anger.

Sensing the powerful aura behind him that got closer and closer, Ye Yuan could not help having the jitters.

This Originguard was too strong!

His speed was swift to the extreme. Even if Ye Yuan comprehended eighth firmament spatial law presently, he was still far inferior to Originguard.

Seeing the Originguard whose momentum was overpoweringly whizzing past, the faces of Ji Mo and the rest were extremely ugly.

“Not only is Second Sage extremely talented, but his character is also incredibly righteous! He did not hesitate to use himself as bait in order to protect us.”

“Heh, Medicine Ancestor as the alchemy path’s number one person, when Second Sage broke the fetters of space, Medicine Ancestor was the first to run. It really makes people feel disappointed.”

“If I can escape this time, this emperor will only follow Second Sage’s lead! It’s just ... I don’t know ...”

This Heavenly Emperor powerhouse said halfway and could not continue anymore.

Originguard was too strong, strong until he made them feel asphyxiated.

Even Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest teaming up was not his match, with Ye Yuan’s bit of strength, could he return alive?

Facing the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art, Ye Yuan created a miracle.

But Originguard was not the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art. He could rival a Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art on his own.

The Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art had weaknesses. Ye Yuan could find its weakness, but ... Originguard had no weaknesses!

At least, at Ye Yuan’s level, even if he knew Originguard’s weakness, he did not have the ability to defeat Originguard.

The two people, one in front and one behind, shuttled through the void. Originguard’s speed was unbelievably fast.

He moved among the spatial turbulent flows like it was flat ground. Those violent spatial storms did not have any effect on him at all. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But within two to four hours, Originguard gradually caught up to Ye Yuan.

“Heh heh, see where you can still run to! Ruining this ancestor’s plans, prepare to die!”

Originguard gave a cold laugh, a fist punched out with a rumble.

Dao marks flickered. A horrifying to the extreme power directly split the spatial turbulent flow into two, tearing across the air and arriving.

That appearance was like a punch split the sea into two, leaving people tongue-tied.

Ye Yuan’s hair stood on end, feeling that the entire world was collapsing.

The horrifying power surged over toward him from all directions, completely sealing off his space, not giving him any room to escape at all.

Originguard’s punch was in anger and alarm.

Anger was due to Ye Yuan ruining his plans, making him fall short of success at the last second.

Alarm was due to Ye Yuan’s talent being too terrifying. He already overestimated Ye Yuan’s talent as much as possible.

But in the end, he discovered that he still underestimated Ye Yuan.

The existence who created the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art was not inferior to him. Once this spell was used, it could forcefully contend with Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses.

Him being able to launch the ambush this time, his biggest reliance was the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art.

But who knew that Ye Yuan actually cracked this invincible spell.

Such talent, if he allowed Ye Yuan to continue growing up unchecked, it would be a devastating blow to the divine race.

Hence, he had to kill Ye Yuan at all costs.

He realized that compared to this Cloudheart Realm’s countless alchemy path powerhouses, Ye Yuan’s threat was clearly greater.

Letting the tiger return to the mountain, there would be no end to future troubles!

This punch, Originguard did not hold back in the slightest, directly using his strongest strike.

He planned on killing Ye Yuan with one punch, so as to end all future troubles.

With this armageddon-like punch being struck over, Ye Yuan did not have the strength to resist all.

The force had yet to arrive and Ye Yuan already spewed fresh blood wildly. Hiis entire body was like he was hauled out of bloody waters.

This time, he was truly powerless.

Originguard was not Nineorigin. This punch of his did not give Ye Yuan any chance at all.

Moreover, even if Ye Yuan took Originguard into the chaos world, it was also impossible to kill him.

Just as Ye Yuan lost all hope, a figure walked out of the void.

It was only to see him draw a circle in the void with both hands, directly covering Ye Yuan and himself.

Bang, bang, bang ...

This shield emitted intense tremors, the spatial turbulent flow was directly blown apart.

But this seemingly unremarkable shield actually defended against Originguard’s fatal punch.

A middle-aged man in coarse cloth was standing in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was certain that he had not seen this middle-aged man before. But he did not know why this person would come to save him.

Originguard arrived with a howl. Seeing this middle-aged man, his face had a gloomy look.

His certain-kill strike was actually blocked by this middle-aged man. His irritation could be imagined.

“Who are you? To actually dare ruin this ancestor’s plans?” Originguard looked at the middle-aged man and said in a solemn voice.

The middle-aged man said coolly, “Jian Family, Jian Yunxin.”

This middle-aged man was shockingly the son of Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, Jian Yunxin!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, he did not expect that the one who saved him at the final juncture would actually be a member of the Jian Family.

Originguard’s brows furrowed and he said, “Jian Family, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets! I’ve long heard that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets calculated everything happening in this world. Attacking Cloudheart Realm this time, I already request Ancestor to take action, to shield heaven’s secrets. I didn’t expect that it was still divined by him. Looks like I underestimated members of the Jian Family.”

Jian Yunxin said coolly, “Your esteemed self indeed did it without a trace. But not long ago, heaven’s secrets suddenly had a change, letting Ancestor detect a trace of abnormality.”

When he said this, Originguard and Jian Yunxin’s eyes both landed on Ye Yuan.

Clearly, this trace of heaven’s secrets’ change landed on Ye Yuan.

Jian Yunxin did not know the inner reason, but Originguard understood in his heart.

Originally, this plan of his was indeed flawless.

Logically speaking, it was impossible for everyone to escape the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art.

But Ye Yuan broke through right then, cracking the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art, shattering this trace of heaven’s secrets. That was how it let Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets detect a trace of abnormality.

This could be said to be a trace of coincidence, and could also be said to be Originguard’s mistake.

If Ye Yuan was not at Cloudheart Realm, no one would have been able to crack the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art at all.

including Medicine Ancestor, everyone would have to die here.

But Ye Yuan happened to be here. He was the greatest variable in this big event, but no one calculated his existence.

Once heaven’s secrets moved, it made the outcome of the matter have an unexpected change.

Originguard was livid with rage and said in a solemn voice, “Truly, considerations will have oversight. I didn’t expect that this brat is already strong until the extent that he can influence heaven’s secrets. If I’d long known that it would be like this, this ancestor would have directly planned to kill off this brat first.”

Jian Yunxin said coolly, “Saying more words is pointless. Does your esteemed self want a battle or to withdraw?”
