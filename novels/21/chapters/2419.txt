Chapter 2425: Barely Escaping with His Life!

“Not good! This aura, could it be that Daymeld’s Heavenly Dao True Martial is ... ?”

“Hahaha, you guessed it right! Lord Daymeld’s Heavenly Dao True Martial is called Shrinking Earth into an Inch! That boy thought that he could escape from Lord Daymeld’s hands. It’s really laughable!”

Hearing his opponent’s words, Ni Xuan’s expression became ugly to the extreme.

Shrinking Earth into an Inch, hearing the name and one would know that it was a movement technique type Heavenly Dao True Martial.

Daymeld’s speed was originally swift to the extreme. Now, coupled with Heavenly Dao True Martial, Ye Yuan would not be able to reach Eight Void Mountain at all!

For a moment, Ni Xuan burned with anxiety!

While on the other side, Wan Zhen delayed the Divine Children Legion, the divine race army continued chasing after Pang Zhen.

Without Ye Yuan taking the charge, Wan Zhen these ten thousand people fought very bitterly.

Fighting at a disadvantage of numbers, under the situation where they did not have an advantage in strength, it was even more unbelievably tragic.

Fortunately, Wan Zhen already broke through to Deva Realm, attracting the vast majority of the force.

Many unpredictable children gambled with their lives, fighting extremely miserably.

Many unpredictable children used methods that stimulate potential to greatly increase their strength.

After a bout of fierce fighting, they could even kill several people in a row. But in the end, they were surrounded and beaten to death by divine children.

The numbers on both sides were rapidly being depleted.

Boom!

A terrifying attack arriving from behind with a howl.

The entire world seemed to be trembling.

After activating Heavenly Dao True Martial, Daymeld’s speed was too fast!

In virtually a blink of an eye, he caught up.

Eight Void Mountain’s grand array looked like it was still a step away, but he could not make it anymore.

That area of space was unable to withstand this horrifying power at all, directly collapsing.

Even those spatial turbulent flows were knocked back too! The might of the power could be seen!

All the hairs on Ye Yuan’s body stood on end, feeling as if the sky was falling down.

He had never seen before such terrifying power. Only then did he truly understand what was called Doomsday Battle.

Even Daymeld was like this, what about Tian Qing and the other progenitors?

That kind of power, using destroying heaven and decimating the earth to describe it was also not over the top.

At this moment, the entire foot of Eight Void Mountain was shattered!

A huge black hole was a ghastly sight to behold.

This terrifying scene made everyone extremely shocked.

Especially the unpredictable army’s and coalition forces’ upper echelons, each and every one of them was staring dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

Everything was over like that?

“Lord Saint Azure!”

Pang Zhen’s eyes turned bloodshot from anger, looking at that black hole as he roared angrily.

Tears actually already flowed down his eyes.

Unknowingly, Ye Yuan already became the leader in his heart.

At this time, with the leader dying, he was deeply saddened.

Not just him, everyone in the unpredictable army, all could not help shedding tears.

“Why is it like this! Could it be that Lord Saint Azure is gone just like that?”

“I don’t believe it! This is impossible!”

“The human race’s hope is severed just like that?”

... ...

Painful wails lingered incessantly.

Everyone was clear what Ye Yuan being killed meant.

“Hahaha ... ignorant child, did you really think that you could escape from under this progenitor’s hand? You completely don’t know how terrifying this progenitor was when I roamed the world unhindered! So, everything is over!”

Killing the human race’s hope, Daymeld was incredibly relieved in his heart.

Ye Yuan’s existence made him feel threatened.

This feeling of extinguishing hope made him very contented.

However, right at this moment, the void trembled, a figure covered in blood from head to toe, crawled out of the void.

Yes, crawled out!

The originally white long robes already turned a scarlet red color at this time, dreadful to behold.

The bones in his body was practically all shattered.

The aura of his body was very weak.

But he was still alive!

Daymeld’s laughter abruptly stopped.

He looked at Ye Yuan with a shocked expression, full of incredulity.

“This ... How is this possible? Is it spacetime illusion? But this progenitor’s attack can even shatter spacetime! How did he do it!”

Reaching his level of realm, every move and stance carried the might of heaven and earth.

Spacetime law could not ignore everything.

Daymeld naturally knew about Ye Yuan’s spacetime illusion. Hence, he did not hold back on this move. He dealt a blow at his full power!

Under this blow, even a Deva Fifth Blight would have to die too.

But Ye Yuan actually survived!

This was simply too inconceivable.

“I understand! It’s a multi-layered spacetime illusion! Fine lad, I didn’t expect that your application of spacetime law already reached such a profound realm! Like this, I can’t let you stay alive even more!”

Daymeld came to a sudden realization, immediately understanding it.

At the critical moment, Ye Yuan laid down several layers of spacetime illusions. He completely disrupted spacetime, narrowly avoiding this attack.

Laying down multiple layers of spacetime illusions, the difficulty did not increase a tiny bit compared to one layer of spacetime illusion.

This was an extremely profound application of spacetime law, it was not that it could be done just by knowing spacetime law.

Of course, even so, Ye Yuan was still almost killed by the horrifying power.

Daymeld’s strength was too terrifying, it was already strong to the degree that it could ignore laws.

Ye Yuan’s powerful power of laws could even render Yu Qin at a loss on what to do, and yet he was unable to stop Daymeld.

“Old dog, you come and kill if you have the ability!”

The moment Ye Yuan spoke, it gave everyone a fright.

That hoarse voice was like puffing bellows.

After he finished talking, he turned around and entered Eight Void Mountain.

Daymeld sneered and said, “This Eight Void Mountain is merely a dead formation, how can it stop this progenitor? Brat, you’re too naive!”

Done talking, he leaped and shot towards Eight Void Mountain.

Rumble!

Eight Void Mountain’s grand array was immediately activated.

The terrifying energy undulation smashed towards Daymeld overwhelmingly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, Daymeld’s momentum was overwhelming, he did not fear these powerful restrictions in the slightest at all.

He actually relied on his powerful strength to forcefully resist Eight Void Mountain’s grand array.

The grand array that ordinary martial artists feared like a tiger, actually could not do the slightest thing to Daymeld.

Daymeld charged all the way. Although his speed slowed down significantly, his speed of climbing the mountain was extremely fast.

But in front, Ye Yuan smiled coldly in his heart.

Entering Eight Void Mountain’s grand array, he was considered to have returned home.

As long as he was willing, he could reach the summit in one step.

But he did not.

In this position, the grand array could not unleash its strongest power, and could not severely wound Daymeld at all.

He deliberately led Daymeld on, in order to bait him up.

The two people, you chase and I run, went from 3000 miles to 9000 miles, then to 18,000 miles, then to 40,000 miles!

Daymeld was in hot pursuit, the momentum getting stronger and stronger.

“Brat, you’re almost reaching the limit, right? Let me tell you, as long as you’re unable to reach the top, you’re dead for sure today! Are you very despaired? Hahaha ...” Daymeld let out a burst of wild laughter at the back.

Ye Yuan just smiled coldly without ceasing and continued climbing.

Very soon, the two arrived above 60,000 miles.

Daymeld’s figure suddenly stopped, having a bad feeling arising in his heart.

This distance already far surpassed the limit that Ye Yuan should reach!

But Ye Yuan was still climbing upward!

He suddenly had a feeling of falling into a pit.

At this time, Ye Yuan also stopped. Turning back, he said with a sneer, “What? Scared? Didn’t you say that I can’t reach the top of the mountain? Would you like to try?”
