Chapter 2956: Every Word Pricking the Heart!

From the three great races, a hundred powerhouses were gathered all around.

Just the Hegemon Realm powerhouses were as many as 23 people!

The number was more than double that of the Nirvanic Soul Clan!

The rest were all origin powerhouses!

In order to completely wipe out the Nirvanic Soul Clan’s core forces, the three great races really mobilized powerhouses this time.

“Sigh, I really regret not listening to Young Friend Ye’s words! If I had listened to Young Friend Ye’s words, the Nirvanic Soul Clan wouldn’t be in this current danger! The death of the Nirvanic Soul Clan today is entirely due to this old man’s muddleheadedness! Young Friend Ye, this old man apologizes to you for the disrespect along the way. Our Nirvanic Soul Clan shouldn’t have dragged you into the water!”

Yu Tian suddenly looked at Ye Yuan, his face full of regret.

Only now did he know that him suspecting Ye Yuan was pushing the Nirvanic Soul Clan into the abyss with his own hands.

Thinking up to here, he felt incredibly guilty.

The other Hegemons also had remorseful looks.

Outside the abyss, Ye Yuan urged them time and again, but none of them believed him.

Now, they were getting their just desserts.

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of harming people at all. But, they projected their shortcomings onto him, harming themselves in the end.

Hearing this, Bloodmourn three people all looked towards Ye Yuan, somewhat visibly moved.

All of this had been arranged carefully to the extreme.

In fact, even Hegemon Imperishable had fallen into the pit too.

In the end, this important matter was actually almost ruined because of this inconspicuous Emperor Realm brat?

The flawless plan was actually seen through by this kid?

Bloodmourn’s back was already drenched in cold sweat!

The blood race had schemed for far too long, for the sake of this plan.

If the entire plan fell through because of this kid, then the losses would really be too great!

Dealings between the three great races with complicated interests and alliances, and they even had to hide from the entire Nirvanic Soul Clan.

The manpower and resources expended for this were simply unimaginable!

This Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven was different from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. This place was the soul race’s world. The soul race had three great Supreme Hegemons who were extremely powerful.

This bone was not easy to chew.

Hence, they could only put up with the second best option. It was to think of a way to join forces with the other two major factions first and then eradicate the Nirvanic Soul Clan.

This god-like maneuver was actually completed by them!

Now, when the results bore fruit, it actually almost failed!

Luckily!

Luckily, Yu Tian these guys were too stupid. If they believed Ye Yuan, then he would probably be hammered to death by Lord Bloodson.

“Sorry.” Cloudneon’s voice entered Ye Yuan’s ears.

Ye Yuan gave her a glance, somewhat surprised. This woman actually knew how to apologize! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Actually, you all don’t need to despair! Progenitor Imperishable won’t die! After killing your way out, the Nirvanic Soul Clan is still the Nirvanic Soul Clan!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Bloodmourn was shocked inwardly, but he laughed loudly on the surface and said, “Kid, you just entered Emperor Cloud Heaven, and you dare to surmise the victory or defeat of Supreme Hegemons? Hegemon Imperishable is indeed known as imperishable and is difficult to kill! But, there’s no unkillable person in this world at all! Regarding this point, Yu Tian they all definitely know better than you! Three great Supreme Hegemons joining forces, it’s just a matter of time that Imperishable that old thing dies!”

The moment these words were said, the expressions of Yu Tian and the rest became even bleaker.

They knew that what Bloodmourn said was right.

Although Progenitor Imperishable was known as imperishable, he was not undying.

He could be killed!

A Supreme Hegemon naturally could not kill him.

But three Supreme Hegemons, that was completely different!

Evil Dragon, Bloodsong, Heavenly Soul, these three great Supreme Hegemons, represented the apex of three great chaos powerhouses!

With them joining forces, there was no one that could not be killed!

Ye Yuan gave Bloodmourn a look and said coolly, “Why are you in such a hurry to come out and defend yourself? Guilty conscience?”

Bloodmourn was shocked inwardly again. What a formidable brat. Every word pricked the heart!

When did such a monster appear in the Nirvanic Soul Clan?

“Although you all are Hegemon Realm powerhouses, nobody understands this Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique better than me! If it was before entering the Seven-Colored Pagoda, I’ll definitely say that Progenitor Imperishable will die. But, after entering, I can tell you all that those three can’t kill him! The blood race’s true objective is you all! If you all, these people, die here, the Nirvanic Soul Clan will really be finished! Progenitor Imperishable alone can’t set off any waves!”

Ye Yuan said it slowly, each word like a knife, making Bloodmourn’s expression change greatly.

Because what Ye Yuan said was not the slightest bit off from the blood race’s plan!

It was just like this plan was drawn up by him.

Before this, Bloodsong had personally admitted that even if the three of them joined forces, they could not kill Hegemon Imperishable too!

Hegemon Imperishable was an anomaly among Hegemons.

His soul physique had already been cultivated to an incomparably terrifying realm.

It could virtually be said to be undying and imperishable!

Therefore, the blood race’s true objective was the five great soul regions’ leaders!

The Nirvanic Soul Clan had already become extremely powerful after hundreds of millions of years of accumulation.

Compared to the Qi Soul Clan, it was much stronger.

Although Supreme Hegemons hard to come across, powerhouses below Supreme were similarly hard to come by.

Not every Hegemon could reach Hegemon Cloudmount’s level.

But one Nirvanic Soul Clan produced five of such existences. It was a very difficult bone to bite on.

As long as they killed Yu Tian the five of them, the Nirvanic Soul Clan would completely fall!

Bloodmourn did not expect that such an elaborate plan would actually be laid bare with a single comment from an Emperor Cloud Heaven boy!

However, Ye Yuan did not finish speaking yet!

He continued, “From the moment they appeared, they have been using psychological attacks on you all, making you all think that Progenitor Imperishable will die! In addition, Sea of Evil this battlefield is too advantageous to them. This way, they will be able to kill you all at the smallest cost! If you all are dispirited, it will fall right into their wishes! Therefore, kill your way out! Even if a single Hegemon escapes, it will be a great loss to them too!”

Boom!

A streak of bloody light lit up, flying straight for Ye Yuan.

Yu Tian’s pupils constricted, a streak of soul force flying straight for the firmament!

Two great hegemons exchanged blows in an instant.

But how terrifying was the attack of Hegemons?

That aftershock instantly vaporized Ye Yuan.

“Ye Yuan!” Yu Tian roared angrily, glaring at Bloodmourn.

He still failed to save Ye Yuan in the end!

Bloodmourn snorted coldly and said, “A reckless and blind ant actually dared to talk about hegemons presumptuously. His death isn’t regrettable!”

The Nirvanic Soul Clan powerhouses were all glaring furiously.

An Emperor Cloud Heaven was seriously too weak in such a battle!

Even a tiny aftershock was sufficient to kill them several times over too.

But, Bloodmourn’s sneak attack also indirectly proved that Ye Yuan’s guesses were completely correct!

Sigh, it was a shame that a peerless genius was gone!

However, in the next second, misty air emerged from the ground.

Gradually, it condensed into Ye Yuan’s appearance.

The eyeballs of everyone present were almost popping out!

“This … How is this possible? Ye Yuan actually didn’t die?”

“That blow earlier, forget about Emperor Cloud Heaven; even if it was Emperor Vast Heaven, they would turn to ashes too!”

“His Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique was clearly completely erased under that blow. Why didn’t he die?

… …

The four great races looked at Ye Yuan with incredible shock, full of incredulity.

Suffered a Hegemon’s blow and actually did not die?
