Chapter 2047: Where Are the People?

Ning Siyu’s particulars were placed in front of the group of Empyreans very soon.

Everyone was rendered speechless.

A female Five-star Alchemy God could actually fight on par with initial-stage Dao Realm powerhouses.

This kind of strength was simply outrageous to hear.

Wasn’t this Ning Siyu a junior version of Ye Yuan?

With this, the group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods finally understood why these geniuses all wanted to choose Ye Yuan.

How could a barren place like Heavenly Eagle have some unparalleled genius? This Ning Siyu was definitely groomed by Ye Yuan!

At the very most, Ning Siyu merely followed Ye Yuan for a thousand years’ time but had such strength. It was truly dreadful to hear.

Everyone looked toward Ye Yuan like seeing a ghost. This guy ... was truly a freak!

Empyrean Pilljade somewhat understood Yun Yi now. This great-grandson of his had an obsession with Alchemy Dao that normal people found hard to understand.

Witnessing Ye Yuan, this major power, how could Yun Yi not be moved?

If Yun Yi could really acknowledge Ye Yuan as master, it would also be a good thing to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

Although he did not want to admit it, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s talent was indeed greater than his.

Now that he already lost to Flutterfeather, along with the passage of time, the likelihood of winning would be lower and lower.

But Yun Yi’s potential was far from exhausted. Once developed by Ye Yuan, surpassing Empyrean Flutterfeather in the future was also not something impossible.

Except ... could Yun Yi really pass Ye Yuan’s test?

This season’s Cloudpill Summit’s disciple recruitment ended in such a theatrical style.

Apart from Ning Siyu, the other 39 people directly left Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital afterward and sprinted for Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Following that, the curtains were drawn for the grandmasters’ preaching on the Dao that had a duration of half a month.

A total of 14 locations was set up in the city, provided for 14 grandmasters to preach on the Dao.

Grandmasters preaching on the Dao could be said to be a welfare benefit. All of the alchemists in the city could choose the grandmaster that they admired in their hearts, and listen to the sermon, without any restrictions.

Lin Tong was a Five-star Alchemy God from a remote imperial city. He hurried over to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital from a great distance just to listen attentively to grandmasters preaching on the Dao.

He did not have the qualifications to enter the inner-city to watch the Cloudpill Summit. The reason why he came to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital was for the sake of this final grandmaster sermon.

In the outer-city, he also became acquainted with some people of the same profession and agreed to go and listen to grandmasters preach on the Dao.

“Lin Tong, which grandmaster’s sermon do you plan on listening to?” The one talking was called Song Zichun, a good friend that Lin Tong made in this period of time.

Lin Tong said without the slightest hesitation, “Is there still a need to ask? Of course it’s Empyrean Pilljade! He’s an Ancestor Realm powerhouse, the Southern Border’s number one person!”

Song Zichun chuckled and said, “Southern Border’s number one person? Your intel is really out-of-touch! Empyrean Pilljade lost to Empyrean Flutterfeather this time. The title of Southern Border’s number one person already changed owners!”

Lin Tong’s eyes opened wide and he said in disbelief, “Empyrean Pilljade is an Ancestor Realm powerhouse! How can he possibly lose?”

Song Zichun had the intention of showing off as he said with a smile, “You don’t know it yet, right? Empyrean Flutterfeather came prepared this time. He already broke through to Ancestor Realm. Furthermore, he defeated Empyrean Pilljade under the watchful gazes of everyone. The next Cloudpill Summit will be changing its name to be called Lustrous Gold Summit!”

“T-There’s actually such a thing?” Lin Tong said in surprise.

It was very hard for them all, these bottom-level martial artists, to get the inner-city’s information. It tended to be inquired from scraping together what everyone had.

Song Zichun had some connections in the inner-city, so the intel that he obtained was still considered more accurate.

Song Zichun said smugly, “Heh, although Empyrean Flutterfeather defeated Empyrean Pilljade, their light during this Cloudpill Summit was overshadowed by another person.”

Lin Tong was shocked by this series of information until he stared dumbfoundedly with his mouth gaping. He said blankly, “Could it be that ... there’s still an existence even stronger than these two mighty Ancestor Realms?”

“Huhu, not to the extent of being stronger, but him surpassing these two mighty Ancestor Realms in the future wouldn’t be something hard.” Song Zichun said with a laugh.

Lin Tong let out a sigh in relief and said with a smile, “Looks like a remarkable genius emerged in this Cloudpill Summit.”

Many geniuses would appear in each Cloudpill Summit, this was not at all surprising. Lin Tong naturally would not take it to heart. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But Song Zichun smiled disdainfully and said, “Cloudpill Summit? Huhu, among all the juniors participating, this lord that I’m talking about is just a Third Firmament True God, also a Six-star Alchemy God. He’s an existence who already surmounted above all of the Seven-star Alchemy Gods and became a grandmaster! Not just that, all top 40 geniuses in this Cloudpill Summit wanted to acknowledge him as their master!”

Lin Tong’s expression became more exciting towards the back.

After Song Zichun finished saying, he chuckled and said, “Brother Song, you’re also exaggerating too much. A Six-star Alchemy God surmounted above all of the Seven-star Alchemy Gods? How is this possible?”

When Song Zichun saw that Lin Tong did not believe, he just smiled coldly and said, “Whether believe it or not, that is up to you. Either way, I’m planning on going to listen to Grandmaster Ye’s sermon, farewell!”

Seeing Song Zichun leave, Lin Tong laughed in spite of himself and shook his head.

Song Zichun blew his trumpet a little too hard. It was totally impossible for people to believe.

Actually, it was not just Lin Tong. The alchemists in the city presently were no fewer than several hundreds of thousands. They completely did not believe that a Third-firmament True God could make two great Ancestor Realms be cast into the shade.

When the grandmaster sermons started, Ye Yuan’s sermon site had the lowest count. There were only a scanty few several thousand people.

Most of these several thousand people were very young. They were all alchemists that participated in the Cloudpill Summit.

Preaching on Dao was different from alchemy battles in the end. No matter how strong Ye Yuan’s strength was, his accumulations were also not as long as other grandmasters.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was just a Six-star Alchemy God after all.

Hence, everyone did not have much faith in his preaching on the Dao.

To many alchemists, this was an opportunity that only came by once every several thousand years. They were naturally not willing to waste it on a grandmaster who was young until it made people doubt.

When Lin Tong saw the ocean-like alchemists around him, he was immediately greatly reassured in his heart.

Song Zichun that fellow was definitely bragging. Maybe he’s also here listening to Empyrean Pilljade preach on the Dao himself. If that young grandmaster is really so formidable, everyone also wouldn’t come and listen to Empyrean Pilljade preaching on the Dao,” Lin Tong thought in his heart.

On the first day of the sermon, Lin Tong was wholly enraptured listening to it.

Ancestor Realm powerhouses were Ancestor Realm powerhouses, the experience and knowledge, the preaching on the Dao, absolutely surmounted all life.

Lin Tong’s alchemy strength was already considered very strong in the surrounding imperial cities. But his strength had already come to an end.

A measly little imperial city was already unable to let him improve further.

By chance, he heard the news of the Cloudpill Summit and rushed over to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital without the slightest hesitation.

Now, hearing Empyrean Pilljade’s sermon, it made him have a feeling of being amidst cloud and mist.

That sort of feeling made him feel like he might break through at any time.

Heh, this is the strength of an Ancestor Realm powerhouse! This sermon might be my opportunity to break through! Lin Tong thought, being incomparably certainly in his heart.

But right at this time, very soft discussions suddenly came from around him.

Lin Tong’s brows furrowed, and he turned his head, wanting to express his displeasure.

When an Ancestor Realm powerhouse was preaching on Dao, they actually did not pay attention and were whispering to one another below.

But upon turning his head, he was immediately stunned.

Where were the people?
