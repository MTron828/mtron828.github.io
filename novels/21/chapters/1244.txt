Chapter 1248: Past Events

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Of course! Otherwise, how would I know the Voice of the Dragon God, this kind of already lost martial technique?” Ye Yuan said.

Ao Jun strove to the utmost of her ability to make her emotions calm down. But she discovered that her mind was hard to calm down.

She finally understood now, what the old ancestor’s ‘I understand’ earlier, meant.

For Ye Yuan to be able to break the curse, there was bound to be some extraordinary aspect.

But Ao Jun never dreamed that it was actually the Atavism Dragon Soul!

But very soon, she sighed slightly again and said, “Even the Atavism Dragon Soul is useless too. At present, Divine Dao dwindled to zero, you’re unable to break the shackles at all.”

A look of determination appeared on Ye Yuan’s face, and he said, “This child came to this Godsfall Mountain Range in order to find the opportunity to break through to Deity Realm! I’ll become a deity or die trying!”

Ao Jun said in surprise, “Yun-er, why be like this?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Yuan briefly recounted the situation of the outside world but concealed many things.

Ao Jun was already an expiring lamp without oil now. She was probably unable to withstand the blow of Ji Zhengyang’s passing.

If not for this Eternity Frost close to freezing her physiological functions, Ao Jun would have long passed away, her Dao vanishing already.

This piece of Eternity Frost was precisely what Ji Zhengyang retrieved only after expending tremendous effort when he entered deep into the lands of extreme north back then.

“But the god-forbidden region is too dangerous! Even if a Deity Realm powerhouse goes in, it’s difficult to protect themselves too, let alone you!” Ao Jun said worriedly.

Finally, she managed to see her son, so she did not wish to lose him just like this.

Ye Yuan said with a firm gaze, “This child has a reason that he must go! Now, there’s another reason! Don’t you wish to go out and reunite with Father?”

Hearing these words, a hopeful light appeared in Ao Jun’s eyes.

Ye Yuan weaved a beautiful lie. He did not hope for Mother to wait for death so quietly.

He already lost Father and did not wish to lose Mother anymore.

No matter how bleak the hope, Ye Yuan also wished to save his mother!

Disregarding the result after the fiend race dominated the Divine Realm, just the enmity of killing Father was already impossible for them to live under the same sky!

If he could not exterminate Kanuo, he would rather die!

Of course, this sort of words, he would not say them.

Toward Ao Jun, he only said that it was for the human race’s righteous cause.

After all, he inherited Absolute Heaven’s Dao teachings and became the Son of Heaven’s Mandate.

This burden, he had to carry it.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s eyes, Ao Jun knew that she could not convince her son and could only heave a long sigh and said, “Your temper is exactly the same as your father’s; both of you are so stubborn!”

Ye Yuan smiled but did not say anything.

At this point, Ye Yuan’s heart-knot was already gone, and he already completely accepted Ao Jun.

Even if meeting for the first time, Ye Yuan did not have much psychological obstacles either.

That feeling of being connected by blood could not fool people.

Moreover, this was a connection that originated from the depths of the soul.

If not for that sort of strong resonance, Ye Yuan would not insist on barging into this cave either.

The two people talked for a long time. This conversation took five days and five nights!

In these five days and five nights, Ye Yuan finally knew about the events that happened back then.

Turns out that not long after Ao Jun escaped the land of exile back then, she ran into the Ji Zhengyang and his party, who entered the void-forbidden region.

Wandering alone in the Godsfall Mountain Range was very dangerous.

Hence, Ji Zhengyang invited Ao Jun to join their team.

Later on, Ji Zhengyang moved Ao Jun with his character. The two people became united in wedlock from then, Ao Jun also followed Ji Zhengyang back to the Medicine King Hall.

It was just that Ao Jun dwelled in deep seclusion and seldom went out. Extremely few people knew about her existence.

But before long, a problem occurred.

Ji Zhengyang discovered that Ao Jun’s aging speed was too fast!

Just over 200 years, Ao Jun seemed to have aged 10 thousand years.

Under his repeated inquiry, Ao Jun told the entire story.

And at that time, Ao Jun was already expecting.

Ji Zhengyang used all of his abilities and was also unable to stop Ao Jun’s aging.

He loved Ao Jun deeply and decided not to have this child.

Because giving birth to the child, Ao Jun’s aging speed would be even faster!

Ao Jun chose to leave without bidding farewell in order to give birth to Ye Yuan.

She returned to the land of exile!

In this period of time, Ji Zhengyang got the news of the Eternity Frost. Hence, he could only enter deep into the lands of extreme north first to search for the Eternity Frost.

Later, he came to the land of exile bringing along the Eternity Frost, but discovered that this place already had the peach blossom grand array laid down.

He threw caution to the winds and barged into the peach blossom formation, but he was nearly killed by the peach blossom formation.

It was Ao Jun’s pleading that made the old ancestor save Ji Zhengyang.

Ji Zhengyang wanted to stay at the land of exile at that time, but the old ancestor refused no matter what!

In the end, Ji Zhengyang left behind the Eternity Frost and brought away Ye Yuan who was in swaddling clothes.

In this land of exile, the elapsing speed of Ao Jun’s life was greatly reduced. Coupled with Ji Zhengyang’s Eternity Frost, that was how she was able to live until now.

Except, Ao Jun was now a living dead person and was completely unable to leave this cold pool.

Even a trace of mood swing would hasten the elapsing of her life.

Hearing these past events, Ye Yuan also sighed endlessly.

This was truly fate making a mockery of men!

Only then, did Ye Yuan knew why Father would always enter deep into the Godsfall Mountain Range every few years.

He only thought that Father was searching for opportunities back then, but did not think that there was still this layer of reason present.

Even separated by a peach blossom forest, it could also slightly relieve the pain of lovesickness.

It was just too bad that they were already forever separated by life and death now.

...

Five days later, Ye Yuan came out from inside the cave. His gaze, when looking at the old ancestor, was filled with complexity.

“Huhu, if you want to take revenge, bring it on,” the old ancestor smiled and said.

Ye Yuan looked at him and suddenly sighed and said, “Forget it. Actually, I can understand you. Mother is already someone on the verge of death. You don’t wish to have Father and I be reared in this place like livestock in pens as well, so you drove us out. This cave is a grave, but how is this Divine Beast Realm not a large tomb? If my conjectures are right, outsiders will probably also be cursed if they stay here for a long time, right?”

The old ancestor’s smile withdrew, his gaze revealing a look of surprise.

He really did not expect that Ye Yuan would say these words.

“Haha, Jun-er really gave birth to a fine son!” The old ancestor suddenly burst out laughing.

“It’s just that I’m very confused, how did you know that I’ll be fine if I go to the outside world? Presumably, you also didn’t perceive that I was of the Atavism Dragon Soul back then, right?”

The old ancestor smiled and said, “Because you’re a human! This land of exile’s curse is merely targeted at demon races! As long as people of the outside world enters this place for over half a year, they will likewise be planted with the curse! It’s just that this place never had outsiders enter before, so this sort of thing, nobody knew either; that’s all.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “So that’s how it is! I still have one more thing. Old Ancestor please resolve the confusion.”

The old ancestor nodded and said, “You say.”

“When I previously saw the four great head elders use the four clans’ martial techniques at the same time, it actually produced a certain kind of resonance. From there, the power increased tremendously! I wonder if this was coincidental, or the four of them specially trained before in the path of joint-attacks?” Ye Yuan said curiously

The old ancestor smiled and said, “This will have to start from the origin of the Four Symbols Family Clans.”
