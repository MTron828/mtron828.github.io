Chapter 1257: Double Combo

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Go!”

Ye Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest, making a prompt decision and directly put himself and Li-er away inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda, and attached it onto White Light’s body.

He and White Light did not need much communication at all. One look was sufficient.

Virtually right away, White Light displayed his movement technique and ran like mad!

Even though White Light did not have Ye Yuan’s kind of greater teleportation remarkable ability, his speed was not much slower than Ye Yuan’s.

The name of the Flowing Light White Light was not called in vain.

Even Li Gui also did not expect that Ye Yuan was so decisive, and actually turned tail and ran.

Being stunned for a brief moment, White Light already disappeared.

“Jeje, this boy is indeed a talent! He’s not sloven at all when doing things! No idea how many times stronger he is compared to Zhuge Qingxuan that fool!”

After a mild surprise, Li Gui gave a praise, and his figure moved, chasing after White Light. His figure was actually fast as lightning and was even much faster than White Light.

White Light’s shock was by no means insignificant and said to Ye Yuan inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda, “Big Brother, this guy’s speed is so fast!”

“Ignore him. You just run and wait for my instruction!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

Ye Yuan at this time was currently desperately recovering essence energy inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda.

White Light and Li Gui’s figures, one in front and one at the back, rushed speedily through the god-forbidden region.

This chase was four hours. The two people already entered god knows how far into the God-forbidden region.

“Jeje, brat, your speed is decent. But playing speed in front of this seat, this is displaying your slight skill in front of an expert!”

Li Gui gave a strange laugh. White Light’s distance from him was just around 100 thousand feet.

“White Light!”

Right at this time, White Light’s figure suddenly vanished. Li Gui’s expression changed. A feeling a danger welled up in his heart!

“Roar!”

A heaven-shaking dragon roar echoed out. A terrifying energy undulation assaulted!

Li Gui’s expression changed again, and he exclaimed, “Sacred Dragon Token! The lord of the dragon clan! A terrific lad!”

This Li Gui was well-deserving of being a Deity Realm big shot back then. It was very familiar with the Sacred Dragon Token as well.

But Li Gui did not panic in the face of danger. His two hands swiftly painted something in front of his chest. A powerful Divine Dao power of laws instantly condensed and formed.

“Ghost Drawing Talisman!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

The Sacred Dragon Token’s attack arrived with a howl. That Ghost Drawing Talisman was just drawn finish, and the attack already arrived!

Even if Li Gui’s Ghost Drawing Talisman was incomparably powerful, his figure was also smashed flying backward, his innards churning.

“The Sacred Dragon Token is very strong! It’s too bad that you’re too weak!” Li Gui said disdainfully.

“Is that so?”

Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out beside Li Gui’s ear akin to a death-hastening talisman!

This shock of Li Gui’s was by no means insignificant! When did Ye Yuan suddenly teleport beside him?

However, Ye Yuan would not give him time to think. A dragon roar billowed into the sky!

Voice of the Dragon God!

Ye Yuan was merely a hundred feet away from Li Gui currently.

This kind of amplitude could simply be described with horrifying!

Li Gui was just like being electrocuted, his entire body twitching. Even the whites of his eyes rolled out.

However, Li Gui was a former peak Heaven Glimpse existence in the end. Just like the old ancestor, facing the Voice of the Dragon God, he was not completely powerless to retaliate.

Even though Li Gui was unable to unleash the power of a Deity Realm powerhouse, his strength was likely even above Fang Tian’s!

After all, Li Gui was once a peak Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm existence!

A bizarre power of law emitted from his body.

Except, the Voice of the Dragon God’s penetrative power was too strong.

Even if his means were exceptionally formidable, it was also unable to completely isolate the power of the Voice of the Dragon God.

This double combo had long been calculated by Ye Yuan.

Although the power of the Sacred Dragon Token was strong, dealing with Li Gui this kind of powerhouse, Ye Yuan reckoned that it was slightly lacking.

Just as Ye Yuan expected, even though his sneak attack had some effect, it did not pose too great of a threat to Li Gui.

So after he unleashed the Sacred Dragon Token, he made use of the cover of the energy utilization and came to Li Gui’s side with a greater teleportation, and threw him a big one.

One breath!

Two breaths!

“White Light, go!”

Ye Yuan and White Light completed the switch in an instant. White Light sped rapidly towards the depths of the god-forbidden region.

The whites of Li Gui’s eyes finally rolled back. His eyes, nose, ears, all seeped with blackish-red bloodstains. Clearly, he had sustained severe injuries.

Looking at White Light’s distant back view, Li Gui revealed a look of great terror.

“Voice of the Dragon God! It must be the Voice of the Dragon God! That’s the paramount martial technique that only the dragon race’s progenitor knows! How did that boy learn it?” Li Gui revealed a horrified look as he said.

“Humph! Blew your own trumpet too hard, right? Didn’t you say that you could kill him? In the end? You were almost finished off!”

Zhuge Qingxuan actually already woke up from his deep sleep at God knows when. But he just happened to see the scene of Li Gui suffering a major loss and could not refrain from ridiculing.

But he was actually also very surprised by Li Gui’s failure.

He was aware of Li Gui’s strength. Peak Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, this kind of strength and he actually still failed to take Ye Yuan down.

“Humph! What do you know? That move just now was called Voice of the Dragon God! This move was long lost in the dragon clan already! That boy actually learned this kind of heaven-defying martial technique, truly terrifying!” Li Gui said.

“Heh, looks like ... you’re scared!” Zhuge Qingxuan mocked mercilessly.

“Scared? Heh! This brat ruined my million years of painstaking effort. Not killing him, how will it give vent to the anger in this deity’s heart?! Even if he’s Absolute Heaven’s reincarnation, this deity will also make him never to reincarnate for all of eternity!” Li Gui said with a cold smile.

...

“Big Brother, why didn’t you let me finish him off?” White Light asked Ye Yuan.

Just now, that Li Gui was clearly already short on strength. It was precisely the best time to eliminate him. But Ye Yuan chose to leave without the least bit of hesitation.

“How can the power of Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm be what the likes of us can imagine? I saw Senior Fang Tian attacking on that day. Li Gui’s strength is even stronger than him, how can he be finished off so easily?” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

White Light was also greatly surprised and said, “Even if there isn’t Divine Dao cultivation realm, his strength is also so terrifying?”

“Of course! Powerhouses capable of breaking through to Deity Realm, which one isn’t an extraordinary genius? But even so, the comprehension of Divine Dao laws are also in units of 10 thousand years! How can the disparity in-between this be a tiny bit? Even if I enter seclusion and comprehend with all my power, it’s also impossible to reach their boundary within a short period! If not for this, why would I need to face a slim chance of survival and come to this Godsfall Mountain Range to search for the opportunity to become a deity? Achieving Deity Realm is our only way out! Otherwise, nobody is Kanuo’s match!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

Only then did White Light know Ye Yuan’s painstaking thoughts and care, as well as Kanuo’s terror.

“Big Brother, this god-forbidden region is so large. Where do we go to find the Kunwu Divine Wood? Furthermore, we have never seen the Kunwu Divine Wood before as well!” White Light suddenly thought of a very serious problem and asked.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “Keep going forward and see fate! Heaven will always leave a door open!”

“Mm? Big Brother, something seems to be off! We ... seem to have entered some incredible place!” White Light suddenly said.
