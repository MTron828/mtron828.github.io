Chapter 1485 Blood Yama Hall

“The four great progenitors were the Immortal Grove World’s realm guardian divine beasts, and also Immortal Grove’s most important companions. With Immortal Grove perishing and his Dao vanishing, their situation is probably no better too. As for where they are, I’m not sure either. Back then, I’d already fallen into a deep sleep and was sent back into that realm by Immortal Grove. The events later, I don’t remember much.”

Mentioning this, Dustless’s expression became downcast too.

Clearly, what happened back then was not a pleasant memory.

“Senior, don’t think too much about the events back then. This Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s lineage, I won’t let a single one go!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Dustless looked at Ye Yuan in relief, his expression calming down slightly.

He knew that if Ye Yuan could grow up step by step like now, taking revenge for Immortal Grove was not something impossible.

The time that followed, Ye Yuan re-tempered his fleshy body according to the Heavenly Dragon Dharma Body’s cultivation method, and indeed felt extremely unhindered.

That feeling of stagnation previously completely vanished without a trace.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan discovered that this Heavenly Dragon Dharma Body was a very high-level body-refinement cultivation method; much more impressive than even the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art.

Ye Yuan spent three full year’s time to temper his fleshy body. After finished tempering, his body-refinement realm actually already reached grand completion initial-stage second transformation.

Just missing a step and he could catch up to his divine essence realm already.

“Indeed, it’s still the dragon race’s cultivation methods that’s the smoothest when cultivating!” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

Before Deity Realm, Ye Yuan still did not feel anything when cultivating the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art.

But after the first transformation golden body was completed, Ye Yuan felt his cultivation speed become slower and slower.

The method of cultivation was clearly not wrong, but his strength was unable to advance.

Now, this kind of feeling was completely gone.

The three years in the World Suppressing Stele, merely three months passed in the outside world.

When Ye Yuan exited seclusion, he discovered that Li Ji was actually already waiting outside the door long ago.

“Miss Li Ji, you’re ...” Ye Yuan said with a blank look.

He discovered that Li Ji looked at him with eyes exuding tender affection, just like a maiden who became enamored.

Li Ji’s face turned red and she said bashfully, “Brother Source Night cultivates so diligently, no wonder you have such strength at a young age. Li Ji has already waited for two months here.”

Ye Yuan secretly felt a headache come on. This fiend race girl was really bold and enthusiastic!

Li Ji did not indulge like other fiend race women. But once she encountered who she liked, she would become very forward and liberal.

This ... was going to launch an offensive against him.

Li Ji was not too alike the average fiend race women. The other fiend race women all did not refuse any admission, but she was different.

Ka Xin was one of the best among the young generation, his strength rated as invincible among Capone Capital City’s young generation.

Yet, she did not like him.

Ye Yuan was somewhat of a different type. He had no lack of meticulousness amidst ruggedness, unrestrained, yet not barbaric. He was very different from the average fiend race men.

Originally, she just felt that Ye Yuan was good-looking and pleasing to the eye, and did not have too much of a feeling.

But Ye Yuan’s performance previously was too eye-catching. That Phantom Kill move unleashing, it captured Li Ji’s heart all at once.

“This ... Miss Li Ji finding Source Night, is there something?” Ye Yuan said.

Li Ji’s beautiful eyes looked straight at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Why? Can’t I come and look for you if there’s nothing?”

Ye Yuan sweated profusely and said, “Of course not.”

Li Ji said gloomily, “Source Night, I discovered that you’re really different from the rest! If it were someone else, this young lady being so forward, they would probably have long been at a loss on what to do with joy. Yet, you seem to avoid me like the plague.”

Ye Yuan chortled with laughter and said, “Isn’t Miss Li Ji different from the rest too? Ka Xin is one of the top young heroes in the capital city. How many girls are infatuated with him? Yet, you speak brusquely towards him.”

Li Ji smiled and said, “That’s because ... he isn’t as good-looking at you!”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “Huhu, that’s true!”

Ye Yuan was living under someone else’s roof now and could not express too reservedly either. Otherwise, it would definitely incur suspicion.

Li Ji laughed until she shook with laughter, clearly being tickled by Ye Yuan’s humor.

“Hehe, it’s also too boring for you to cultivate every day. Why not ... we go for a stroll around the capital city, how’s that?” Li Ji asked probingly.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Just nice, I also want to take a trip to the Blood Yama Hall. Why not Miss Li Ji take a trip with me, is that alright?”

Li Ji revealed a surprised look and said curiously, “What are you going to Blood Yama Hall for?”

Ye Yuan said, “Source Night has a relative who went missing and wants to go to Blood Yama Hall to inquire about it.”

Li Ji revealed a look of realization and said, “Like that huh, then ... this young lady will accompany you.”

...

Blood Yama Hall was a powerful underground organization of Capone Capital City.

This organization was not just limited to Capone Capital City. Its network and power spread throughout the entire Eminent Orchid Imperial City.

The might of its strength, even the City Lord Manor did not dare to easily get on bad terms with it.

Different from the City Lord Manor lording over a city, the Blood Yama Hall’s goal was to earn money.

It was just that their methods of earning money were different from conventional means.

Blood Yama Hall was divided into quite a few halls: Blood Battle Hall, Assassination Hall, Hundred Knows Hall, Fiend Medicine Hall, so on and so forth.

All in all, their methods of earning money were mostly some things that could not be exposed to the public.

When everyone heard the Blood Yama Hall’s name, they loved and hated it.

For example, Fiend Medicine Hall this place was somewhat similar to the Alchemist Association; a place specifically to refine medicinal pills.

The fiend race alchemists were called fiend apothecaries. The name was different, but it was actually about the same as human alchemists.

Except, the fiend race’s medicinal pills were very different from the human race’s; two entirely different approaches. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Fiend apothecaries’ status in the fiend race was extremely revered. Because the fiend race was seriously too weak in this aspect.

The fiend race was warlike and valued valiantness. But making medicinal pills, this sort of delicate work, not many could really be qualified.

Hence, the fiend race’s fiend apothecaries were much rarer than the human race’s alchemists. Each one had exceedingly high statuses.

The fiend race did not lack powerful martial artists but lacked powerful fiend apothecaries.

Hence, everyone all liked the Fiend Medicine Hall, this place, but was afraid of the Assassination Hall, this sort of place.

As for the Blood Battle Hall, that was a killing field, and also the gambling place of the capital city’s various major noble clans. It was very bloody.

The Hundred Knows Hall was naturally the place to inquire about information.

The moment Ye Yuan and Li Ji went out the door, they were locked on by someone.

Huo En was the Assassination Hall’s heaven rank fiend general assassin. His strength belonged to the pinnacle-most existences among the Assassination Hall’s fiend general killers.

He had kept watch for three month’s time in the Fan Family’s vicinity and finally managed to wait for Ye Yuan. But he did not expect that he came out together with Li Ji.

The Assassination Hall had a rule, one was not allowed to make a move against the four great families’ direct line of descent disciples.

Of course, if they were paid a sufficient price, they would take action anyway.

The four great families’ influence was enormous in the capital city. Pull one hair and the whole body was affected.

Even the Blood Yama Hall, this kind of major force, was not willing to easily offend as well.

“No wonder Ka Xin wants to kill this brat. He actually won over Capone Capital City’s famous cold-beauty! Consider yourself lucky, kid, let you live a while more! Mn? They are going to the Blood Yama Hall?”

Huo En’s brows shot up, revealing a hint of a smile.
