Chapter 2105: Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space

It was not just the red-haired youth. Everyone present looked at Ye Yuan with incredible shock.

The demon race’s bloodline power could be grafted. Humans frequently extracted the demon race’s bloodline power.

But no matter how it was grated, it was unable to surpass the original race’s bloodline power.

But now, Ye Yuan, a human’s bloodline power, was actually thick to such an extent. How could they not be shocked?

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Is it very strange to be stronger than you?”

By the side, Uncle You said with a cold snort, “Humph! Stealing Qilin bloodline, deserve to die ten thousand times over! Qi Yun, don’t hold back, kill him!”

Qi Yun’s face turned cold, and he said with a nod, “I didn’t expect that taking this trip out, I actually really ran into someone who isn’t afraid to die, to even dare to steal my Qilin Clan’s bloodline power too. Forget it. Since that’s the case, I’ll send you off then!”

Finished talking, Qi Yung’s two hands came together, two clusters of fire combining into one. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

A surge of mysterious power instantly reverberated between heaven and earth.

Behind Qi Yun, the figure of a giant beast slowly emerged.

The enormous beast opened its gaping maws. That appearance was like it was going to swallow the sky and devour the earth.

This enormous beast was naturally the Qilin divine beast.

“This ... This is the Qilin Clan’s innate divine ability, Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space!”

“It’s said that once this move is unleashed, even the void can be devoured! Its power is tremendous!”

“To be able to execute Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space, this red-haired youth’s status in the Qilin Clan definitely isn’t low!”

... ...

Feeling Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space’s horrifying power, there were cries of exclamations from all around.

Although demons like the Qilin Clan were reclusive and did not emerge, there were legends about them in this world.

The Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space was precisely the Qilin Clan’s powerful hallmark.

After the demon race cultivated to a certain realm, they would awaken their innate divine abilities.

It was just that to legendary divine beasts like the Qilin, their innate divine abilities were especially terrifying.

In terms of strength, this Qi Yun was inferior to Feng Tianyang. But by relying on an innate divine ability like Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space, Feng Tianyang might not be Qi Yun’s match too.

The awakening of this kind of innate divine abilities had nothing to do with the power of laws. It was only related to the source of Great Dao.

In other words, it was heaven bestowing a gift!

And this was the powerful reliance for the demon race to be able to exist side by side with the human race.

Witnessing Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space, everyone looked at Ye Yuan very pitifully.

They could tell that Ye Yuan touched the Qilin Clan’s reverse scale.

Qi Yun looked down from a height, looking at Ye Yuan with cold eyes as he said with disdain, “So what if stole Qilin bloodline? How can my Qilin Clan’s true strength be what you can imagine? Once Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space is unleashed, even the void can be devoured. You ... can go with peace of mind!”

Ye Yuan just smiled faintly and said, “Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space is it? As luck would have it, I also awakened it.”

“You? Awakened the Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space? Hahaha ... mn?”

When Qi Yun heard Ye Yuan’s words, he could not refrain from laughing wildly. But laughing halfway, it suddenly ceased, like a duck which had its throat stuck.

Because Ye Yuan’s body suddenly erupted with a powerful undulation!

This undulation was actually exactly the same as his!

Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space!

Behind Ye Yuan, a behemoth Qilin similarly appeared.

Two Qilins faced each other, not giving an inch.

The entire place was dead silent. The Qilin Clan looked at that figure in the void, shook to the core.

Uncle You said in shock, “How is this possible!? This human’s Qilin bloodline is actually powerful until it can awaken innate divine abilities?”

Ye Yuan pointed at the void and shouted coldly, “Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space, devour for me!”

Qi Yun’s pupils constricted and he gritted his teeth and said, “So what even if you know Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space? Kill for me!”

Bang!

Two Qilins were baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, tearing crazily in the void.

The city’s sky immediately turned dim. Endless spiritual energy was being devoured. Ye Yuan two people’s figures were immediately swallowed up by the darkness.

In an instant, berserk energy undulation swept throughout the entire city, alarming countless powerhouses.

“Is this the innate divine ability of the Qilin Clan? Indeed ridiculously strong!”

“Even if a peak rank six clashes with them, they would probably be directly swallowed up too, right? This power is too frightening!”

“Just which of the two of them won? Completely can’t tell!”

... ...

When the martial artists in the city were discussing animatedly, a figure dropped down from above the void. Uncle You’s face changed, leaping up.

The one who fell was precisely Qi Yun.

The current Qi Yun was already unconscious, injuries all over his body. It was as if he was torn apart by something.

Clearly, he already sustained extremely severe injuries.

Following that, another figure stepped out of the void, his figure elegant. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

Seeing this scene, the powerhouses below became wide-eyed.

What kind of situation was this?

The counterfeit Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space defeated the authentic Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space?

How could this human be so monstrous?

Uncle You shouted fiercely and reproached, “Punk, to dare hurt Qi Yun, you’re courting death!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “I already said to teach him how to behave on behalf of his elders. Natural treasures are obtained by those fated for it. This is the Heavenspan World’s norm. I went through all kinds of hardships and perils, obtaining the Qilin treasure at death’s door, but you want it back with a word and even want me to kneel and admit my fault? What kind of logic is this?”

Uncle You’s face turned frosty and he said in a solemn voice, “My Qilin Clan’s words is the logic! Kid, this Empyrean will send you on your way right now!”

Done talking, Uncle You raised his hand and it was a fist.

Except, Loneswan was long prepared, directly clashing a fist with Uncle You.

Loneswan’s realm was a level higher than Uncle You, but Uncle You’s bloodline power was powerful. The two people barely managed to be evenly-matched.

Uncle You’s expression was extremely ugly as he said with a cold snort, “Kid, if you don’t give an explanation today, forget about leaving here!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “With the likes of you?”

At this time, a figure stepped out of the void. Looking at Ye Yuan, he said in a cold voice, “He can’t, then what about me?”

The one who came out was an old man, his aura extremely powerful. Looking at him, he was a late-stage Empyrean peerless powerhouse too.

When Uncle You saw the arrival, he was immediately overjoyed. Bowing in salute, he said, “Qi You pays respect to Lord Chen! This boy ...”

Qi Chen interrupted Qi You’s words with a hand gesture and said coolly, “This Empyrean knows.”

He looked at Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “Brat, hand over the Qilin precious treasure. Then end your life yourself to atone for your crime, saving this old man from having to take action.”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and shaking his head when he heard that and said, “Looks like your Qilin Clan has its leaders setting a bad example, and its subordinates following suit! Indeed all shameful. Still that sentence, the treasure is on me, come take it if you have the capability.”

Qi Chen’s gaze turned cold and he said with a cold smile, “Kid, you’re very courageous. Since that’s the case, then this Empyrean will come and take it.”

Loneswan’s face changed and was about to block in front of Ye Yuan, but heard Ye Yuan say coolly, “It’s fine, let him come over.”

Loneswan was taken aback and could only retreat to the side.

A powerful aura completely locked onto Ye Yuan. This Qi Chen was indeed a late-stage Empyrean mighty expert.

The powerhouses in the city looked at Ye Yuan with doubtful faces, like looking at a fool,

They did not understand just where Ye Yuan’s confidence came from.

Could it be that he thought that he was invincible under the heavens by grasping Heavenly Qilin Devouring Space?

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and did not have the intention of making a move. He wanted to see when those old things planned on taking action.
