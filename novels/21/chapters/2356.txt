Chapter 2362: The Strongest 17 People!

“Rest! He actually took the initiative to have Pang Zhen and the others rest up!”

“Did this kid knock his head silly when fighting Wan Zhen previously?”

“What time is it, is he still talking about whatever broadmindedness?”

... ...

Everyone exploded. They were completely unable to understand Ye Yuan’s way of doing things.

At this kind of moment when the smallest details had to be argued over, this guy became generous and took the initiative to let the others rest up.

Even Pang Zhen, Yu Tanzhi, and the rest were taken aback too, only coming back to their senses after a while.

They all, these people, were proud by nature, when had they been underestimated like this by someone before?

“Boy, are you sure?” Yu Tanzhi said with a smile that was not a smile.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “To me, one person or a dozen over people, it’s all the same. Hence, you guys had better recover your strength first. Otherwise, this fight will be boring.”

Done talking, he sat down cross-legged and continued resting.

The 18 geniuses exchanged glances, all having a feeling of being looked down on.

They were actually being underestimated by someone!

“Very good, I want to take a look today, just how strong this punk is!”

Pang Zhen sneered coldly and immediately started to adjust his breathing.

Waves of loud laughter came from above the void.

“This kid is really overbearing! He’s actually challenging 18 people alone. This breadth of spirit, even this old man can’t compare to his spirit! Lightning, you said that he couldn’t even enter the God of War Golden List. How about now?” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said with a big laugh.

All of the big shots including Ancestor Lightning, each and every one of their faces were very ugly.

In these past ten years in the outside world, they had been mocking Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets all the way, saying that the person he chose could not even enter the God of War Golden List.

But who could have expected that at the final juncture, Ye Yuan actually came roaring into being, rising all the way until he charged to first place?

In the caged battle, Ye Yuan even shocked the world with two battles, scaring the group of geniuses to not dare to make a move against him.

In the final battle, he even challenged 18 of the strongest geniuses proudly on his own.

This unexpected way of doing things not only shocked the geniuses in the Primeval War Realm, it similarly shocked the progenitors who were spying.

Even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was also stunned for a long time before he came back to his senses.

Ancestor Lightning had a sullen look as he said, “What are you showing off for? Fighting one-versus-18, do you think that he can win?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said, “So what even if he loses? A genuine major power needs to be capable of doing what others can’t, and what others don’t dare to do! Not crushing geniuses of the same generation, how will one corroborate their Dao? In this epoch, didn’t only the few of us old fellows emerge? Moreover, this kid dares to be so arrogant. How do you know that he doesn’t have any reliance?”

The others were immediately rendered speechless.

What Profound Secrets said was right. They all, these ancestors who corroborated their Dao, which one did not crush geniuses in their same generation, before they had today?

But, even back then, they also did not dare to say that they would fight one-versus-18!

A progenitor said with a cold snort, “Profound Secrets, don’t you get cocky too early! Even if he has something to rely on, it’s also absolutely impossible to win! Be careful that your face gets slapped when the time comes!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Profound Secrets’ gaze swept across everyone’s faces, shaking his head, and could not help laughing as he said, “Your eyesight are too narrow! When all races are facing danger, there will be a hero who rises to the sky! The stronger Ye Yuan is, the more hope the human race has! At this time, you all are still playing your little schemes. Why is there such a need?”

Everyone was speechless. Profound Secrets’ words made sense, but people were all selfish. Who could truly be selfless?

... ...

Three days passed in a flash. What these top geniuses cultivated were all the top-notch cultivation methods. Recovery was also very fast.

At this time, the 18 people have all reached their peak states already.

With power in hand, it was as if strong self-confidence returned to them.

Pang Zhen looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile on his face, “Kid, confidence is a good thing! But you’ll discover very soon that yours isn’t called confidence, but it is called conceit!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Is that so? Then hope that you can prove it to me.”

Pang Zhen’s face turned black, this punk’s smile was so annoying!

But Yu Tanzhi suddenly said, “Wan Zhen, which side are you prepared to stand on?”

Wan Zhen said coolly, “I choose to withdraw!”

Yu Tanzhi sneered and said, “Withdraw? Heh, what a nice plan you have! If we really fought until both sides sustained heavy injuries, wouldn’t you reap the spoils of victory without lifting a finger?”

But Wan Zhen said, “Actually, I want to help Younger Brother Ye, but he definitely doesn’t want me to intervene. Therefore, I can only withdraw. Of course, if you guys feel uneasy, you can also divert a few to come and deal with me!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, this Wan Zhen was a sensible person.

Yu Tanzhi’s gaze also turned dark and he said, “Since that’s the case, gentleman, after we kill this punk, we’ll join forces again to kill Wan Zhen!”

Everyone nodded their heads. Clearly, everyone did not have objections.

Suddenly, a series of powerful to the extreme source power of law lit up inside the cage.

Before even making a move, that powerful aura already passed through the cage and engulfed the entire Primeval War Realm.

This was the power of 17 people joining forces!

Just feeling this aura made people feel asphyxiated.

With 17 people, several dozen kinds of source power could be seen.

Some had an overwhelming momentum, some had a majestic air, some were illusory!

Each person’s characteristic was different, each person’s forte was different.

These 17 people joining forces could be said to be without any weaknesses to exploit.

“So strong! Really so strong! If I were to stand there, probably before even waiting for them to make a move, I’d have directly been crushed into minced meat.”

“Forget about you, if Wan Zhen was standing in the middle, he would likely have already collapsed as well!”

“I really don’t know how Ye Yuan thinks. Can such an opponent be what one person can deal with?”

... ...

Wan Zhen felt this terrifying power, his complexion turning pale too.

It was a one-on-one battle previously. But now these auras were all aimed at a single person.

But now, everyone was targeting Ye Yuan alone at the same time, the feeling was completely different.

The superimposition of 17 powers was akin to 17 big mountains, it was truly incomparably heavy.

Above the void, Ye Yuan was surrounded tightly in the middle by 17 people.

Around him, a series of sword lights glimmered and faded indeterminately, the sword formation operating on its own, no joy nor sorrow on his face.

To him, this was similarly a huge challenge.

After all, these opponents were not some Tom, Dick, or Harry, but the Heavenspan World’s top geniuses!

Especially Pang Zhen, the power of lightning on his body seemed to represent the heavenly punishment of Heavenly Dao; unbelievably terrifying.

“Kill!”

It was only to hear Pang Zhen roar angrily. His entire person already turned into a bolt of lightning, smiting toward Ye Yuan.

In an instant, a sea of lightning completely surrounded Ye Yuan.

That horrifying power of lightning virtually wanted to destroy the world!

Ancestor Lightning represented the power of heaven’s punishment in the first place.

Pang Zhen obtained his true inheritance, how horrifying his strength was could be imagined!

At the same time, the other 16 people made a move at the same time.

One horrifying to the extreme energy undulation after another smashed toward that lightning sea, the place where Ye Yuan was standing at.

In virtually a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan was drowned by the brightly colored energy fluctuations.

People only saw that the place Ye Yuan stood practically already became a black hole.

The horrifying attack turned that side into a vacuum zone.
