Chapter 2000: The Laws of Five Elements!

“This ... How is this possible?”

“Actually completely unscathed! Lord Ye Yuan he ... How did he do it?”

“This defensive strength is truly freakishly powerful!”

...

There were cries of exclamations in the city. Following that, there was joyful cheering.

Not seeing him for several decades, Lord Ye Yuan’s strength increased to a realm that made people tremble again.

Of course, this was to the enemy.

Deng Wei’s pupils constricted, staring fixedly at that figure, full of disbelief.

Ye Yuan stood proudly, his body not even having a damaged corner of his sleeves.

How freakish was this defensive power?!

Lu Ziyi’s brows furrowed slightly, clearly extremely surprised by this scene.

“Just now, there was ... the undulation of an empyrean spirit treasure! He has a defensive empyrean spirit treasure on him!” Lu Ziyi opened her mouth and said coldly.

“E-Empyrean spirit treasure?” Deng Wei looked at Ye Yuan absent-mindedly.

Immediately, his face revealed a look of wild elation.

Ye Yuan had an empyrean spirit treasure on him. As long as he killed Ye Yuan, wouldn’t the empyrean spirit treasure be his?

How could Deng Wei’s little thought hide from Ye Yuan’s eyes?

He opened his mouth and said coolly, “Want the empyrean spirit treasure?”

Deng Wei did not have the intention of hiding and said with a smile, “I didn’t expect that there’s still an unexpected harvest by coming here. That empyrean spirit treasure, I want it!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Can. As long as you can block a blow from me.”

Deng Wei burst out laughing when he heard this. He said, “Overconfident fool! You think that by relying on an empyrean spirit treasure to block my attack, your strength outmatches this young master’s strength? If this young master can’t even block this blow of yours, wouldn’t these several thousand years have been lived in vain?”

Ye Yuan was expressionless. He had been suppressing his rage constantly.

“Very well, then you receive it well!”

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly erupted, arriving in front of Deng Wei like lightning.

“So fast!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Deng Wei’s pupils constricted, world domain and protective divine essence bursting out crazily.

However, his world domain and protective divine essence could not block Ye Yuan in the least bit at all.

Ye Yuan was just like a sharp knife, barging straight into Deng Wei’s world domain, two hands directly grabbing his shoulders.

Deng Wei was greatly alarmed in his heart and struggled desperately, wanting to shake off Ye Yuan.

But very soon, an acute tearing feeling came from his body. It was extremely painful.

“What happened? Why do I feel like my body isn’t mine anymore?”

This was the last thought that flashed past in Deng Wei’s mind. Because his body was already torn in half by Ye Yuan using brute force.

The entire city was silent!

Everyone looked at this scene in incredible shock, feeling the jitters.

Tearing a Fifth Firmament True God with his hands, it was such a spectacular sight. It was their first time seeing such a thing happen in their lives.

Too shocking, too intense!

Too ... liberating!

These few fellows had always been swaggering before others, harping on and on about lowly commoners.

In the eyes of these people, they all, these ordinary martial artists, were merely targets to be exploited, sheep that they were raising.

Deng Wei was forcefully torn in half by Ye Yuan just like that.

“Middle-stage ... perfect sixth transformation golden body!”

Lu Ziyi and Dai Yang’s pupils constricted, looking at Ye Yuan in immense shock.

The might of Ye Yuan’s fleshy body power greatly exceeded their imaginations.

Only then did they know that when Ye Yuan blocked Deng Wei’s strike, the empyrean spirit treasure was merely adding flowers to embroidery.

What Ye Yuan truly relied on was his powerful to the extreme fleshy body!

Achieving a middle-stage sixth transformation golden body, this was the lucky chance that Ye Yuan obtained inside the Crape Myrtle Cave.

Currently, Ye Yuan had been suppressing his rage all along, so he needed to vent.

And Deng Wei was clearly the best target.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, looked toward Lu Ziyi, and said coldly, “This is the so-called genius that you guys spoke of? Merely thus! I really don’t know where your so-called sense of superiority came from! You kept saying on and on about how they are lowly commoners, but in my eyes, you guys are the lowly plebeians.”

“They work hard and fight every day in order to live. They frequently wander the borders of life and death. They supply resources to you all, these so-called geniuses. But in the end, they became the lowly commoners that came out of your mouth.”

“You don’t need to worry about food and clothing, don’t have to worry about resources, don’t lack cultivation methods, and mystic treasures are free for your picking. Putting it bluntly, you all just simply reincarnated well. Even so, he still couldn’t block a move from me. What a joke! You all remember for me, killing you guys today is for the sake of a young man called Jiang Ming!”

Ye Yuan’s every word and sentence rang with power, condemning Lu Ziyi and Dai Yang until they were utterly worthless.

He naturally had this capital.

Previously, Deng Wei’s words were wildly conceited, not taking Ye Yuan seriously at all.

But in the end, he could not even hurt a single strand of Ye Yuan’s hair. He could not even block one blow from Ye Yuan.

Lu Ziyi’s expression did not have much of a change. She just said with a cold smile, “This is your reliance? You think that by killing Deng Wei, you’ve cornered us? Also, you killing Deng Wei is already a capital crime. You and the people around you all have to die!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Is that so?”

Swoosh!

Voice had not faded and Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly erupted.

The Dai Yang who was by the side immediately felt his scalp tingle, a feeling of immense danger welling up in his heart.

He used all of his energy to defend, but it was to no avail!

Bang!

Ye Yuan’s punch landed, Dai Yang’s entire person was blown apart, turning into a cloud of blood mist, no time to even defend.

And from start to end, Lu Ziyi observed coldly from the sidelines, not having the intention of helping.

“Lord Ye Yuan’s strength is actually already so strong!”

“Hahaha! Beat this group of condescending things to death! Lord Ye Yuan, we support you!”

“Lord Ye Yuan, kill that girl! Take revenge for Jiang Ming!”

...

The martial artists in the city all watched until their hot blood boiled with excitement, shouting crazily.

They all knew that Ye Yuan similarly rose from nothing. He relied on his own efforts and walked until today step by step.

Now, Ye Yuan represented them and beat these condescending geniuses until they were utterly routed. How could they not be excited?

Lu Ziyi looked at Ye Yuan and was still calm as she said, “I admit that I underestimated you. But, it also ends here! Although the perfect golden body is formidable ... you still can’t escape death!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “I really don’t know where the confidence of you all, these so-called geniuses, came from.”

A sword appeared in Lu Ziyi’s hand like a magic trick and she slowly said, “Don’t know is it? Then ... this young lady will use it to tell you where my confidence comes from.”

Lu Ziyi’s long sword swung, the air immediately became wet.

Law of water!

Following that, she beckoned with one hand. A cluster of flames wrapped around her.

Law of fire!

The next second, the sword light turned cold. A yellowish-brown colored light halo lit up.

Law of earth!

In the city, the faces of all of the martial artists changed.

The laws of five elements, three appeared all at once.

Furthermore, there were still no signs of stopping.

Lu Ziyi pointed with her sword, and another green light lit up. An aura of life filled the air.

Everyone cried out in surprise, “Law of wood!”

“There ... There wouldn’t be more, right?” The expressions of the martial artists in the city changed.

However, things did not go as people wanted. Lu Ziyi let out a delicate cry, another power of law lit up!
