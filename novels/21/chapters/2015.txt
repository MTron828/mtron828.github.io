Chapter 2019: Luckily You Know

Commander Gan did not even look at the token in Ye Yuan’s hand and just said with a cold snort, “Whatever thing is also useless, this commander only acknowledges the Cloudpill invitation.”

“Haha, do you think that Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital is some random place? Casually taking out a token and you can go in? What a bumpkin!” Zheng Qian said with a look of disdain.

“The Cloudpill Summit only acknowledges the invitation and won’t recognize other things. You don’t even know this bit of general knowledge and also dare to come and take part in the Cloudpill Summit?” Zheng Buqun said with a cold smile.

They were really brought to tears from laughing at watching the joke today.

The current Ye Yuan was completely a bumpkin who had never seen much of the world before in front of them.

This fellow was completely clueless about the Cloudpill Summit, but he ran in front of them, these alchemy geniuses to posture, adding a bunch of merriment.

Seeing these few people’s reactions, Ye Yuan was also taken aback.

He looked at the grandmaster token in his hand and felt baffled.

It seemed like this thing was not too useful!

He even thought that this thing looked very impressive. But taking it out, people did not recognize it at all.

“Kid, looks like you really want this commander to take action!”

In Commander Gan’s eyes, Ye Yuan was merely a little child showing off; talking big to impress people.

He released his aura and directly grabbed at Ye Yuan.

The aura of Fifth Firmament True God was suddenly released, locking right onto Ye Yuan.

While Zheng Qian and the rest revealed gloating looks, looking at this scene calmly.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed. This Commander Gan struck rather heavily. With this grab, if his strength was inadequate, he would really be heavily injured.

Clearly, this guy was currying favor with these few ancient families’ descendants and deliberately dealt a heavy blow.

It was only to see him snort coldly. Suddenly, a Life and Death Seal fired out.

A Fifth Firmament True God versus a Third Firmament True God; Commander Gan thought that he would capture him easily.

Who knew that the moment Ye Yuan made his move, that pressure that could topple mountains and overturn the seas came from head-on.

Bang!

Commander Gan was caught off-guard and directly smacked flying by this Life and Death Seal. He seemed to be injured in an extremely wretched manner.

Zheng Buqun’s pupils constricted and he said in surprise, “This ... How is this possible?”

The young man surnamed Duan also said with surprise, “How can this kid’s strength be so strong?”

They were all waiting for Ye Yuan to suffer a loss. Who knew that Ye Yuan was fine and actually crippled Commander Gan in one move.

An initial-stage True God Realm striking a middle-stage True God Realm flying away in one move, this sort of thing was too outrageous to hear.

Ye Yuan looked too unremarkable, a thousand over years old, how strong could he be?

Yet, he wasted Commander Gan in one move!

“S-Still in a daze for what? This kid actually dared to cause trouble, c-cripple him for me!” Commander Gan gritted his teeth and roared at the soldiers.

At once, a large group of guards rushed forward and surrounded Ye Yuan in the middle.

Ye Yuan frowned slightly. He also did not expect to cause such a big commotion. Who knew that these guys did not even recognize the grandmaster token.

Actually, this could not be blamed on Commander Gan they all too. How could a grandmaster token this sort of thing be what Commander Gan would know of?

One had to know, in the entire land of Southern Border, there was only a total of 14 grandmaster tokens.

Those who possessed grandmaster tokens were all people with extremely revered statuses. They were at least middle and late-stage Empyrean super powerhouses too.

The moment these people appeared in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital, there would immediately be Empyrean powerhouses that came out to welcome them. They would not enter from the city gates in an ostentatious manner like this at all.

Ye Yuan did not know the inner reason. He only wanted to stroll around more in the city, who knew that it caused such much misunderstanding.

But at this point, Ye Yuan naturally would not hold back either.

These guards were mostly at the Celestial Deity Realm. There was also a portion of True God Realms. But in front of Ye Yuan, it was completely lacking. He knocked down these guards with a few moves.

Zheng Qian’s expression was ugly to the extreme as he said, “How can this guy’s strength be so powerful?”

Ye Yuan’s age was merely similar to his. But his combat power was no idea how many levels higher than him.

Looking across the Southern Border, there were also not many capable of surpassing Ye Yuan in martial arts.

But Zheng Buqun chuckled and said, “This kid is courting death himself!

Zheng Qian was taken back and said, “Why?”

Zheng Buqun smiled and said, “Originally, he was swindling people. If he was given a beating and thrown out, the matter would be settled. But now, he caused such a big commotion. There will immediately be someone who comes out to take care of him. What’s the use even if he’s any stronger? Can he be stronger than Ninth Firmament True God powerhouses?”

The moment Zheng Qian heard, he immediately reacted to it and said with a big laugh, “Haha, this kid is dead for sure!”

“Who is it? To dare cause trouble in my Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital?”

The voice had yet to fade when a voice closed-in from far away, arriving in an instant.

A burly man with a curly beard appeared in front of Ye Yuan, his expression unfriendly.

When Commander Gan saw the curly-bearded burly man, it was as if he grasped a life-saving straw, hurriedly saying, “Lord Qin Chong, this punk doesn’t have an invitation. I chased him out of the city, not only did he not leave, he even beat me and the soldiers to serious injuries!”

Qin Chong also had a fiery temper. Hearing Commander Gan’s words, he immediately flared up with anger.

The moment Qin Chong heard, he said in a great rage, “What? Impudent brat, to actually dare ...”

When Zheng Buqun and the youth surnamed Duan saw Qin Chong fly off the handle, their faces revealed an expression of gloating over others’ misfortune.

Qin Chong was a Ninth Firmament True God mighty expert. No matter how heaven-defying Ye Yuan was, could he still deal with him?

Qin Chong was just about to go crazy, suddenly turning his head to look at Ye Yuan, but saw Ye Yuan slowly take out a token. Ye Yuan said, “I gave this to them to see this, but they all didn’t recognize it. I wonder if ... you recognize it?”

Ye Yuan also asked probingly. If this Qin Chong still did not recognize it, then he could only slip away.

Zheng Buqing scoffed when he saw the situation and said, “Still taking this lousy token out, could it be that ... this kid is really a fool?”

Fortunately, Qin Chong’s reaction made Ye Yuan heave a sigh in relief.

The moment Qin Chong saw the token, his pair of eyes immediately went wide.

He looked at the token and looked at Ye Yuan again, his eyes full of disbelief.

“This ... This ...” Qin Chong stammered and actually could not speak.

How could a grandmaster token be in the hands of a young man like this?

Commander Gan did not know the inner reason and urged, “Lord Qin Chong, what’s wrong with you? This brat is too insolent, you mustn’t let him off easily!”

Smash!

A clear slap sounded out, Commander Gan was directly slapped flying out.

This slap made everyone stunned.

Before figuring out what was going on, they heard Qin Chong roar, “You scoundrelly thing! Don’t drag me down if you want to die! Also, you all, are you in a rush to reincarnate? All put away your weapons for me!”

The group of guards looked at each other, blank looks on their faces.

Suddenly, Qin Chong knelt down with a thud and said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “These scoundrelly things are insensible. Your Excellency, please don’t take offense! When this lowly one returns, I’ll definitely teach them a good lesson!”

“This ... What’s going on here? Lord Qin Chong actually knelt down to a Third Firmament True God?”

“Just what background does this kid have?”

“Could it be that ... that token is very impressive?”

...

Cries of exclamations sounded out all around, completely knocked dizzy by Qin Chong’s actions. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ye Yuan put away the token and let out a long sigh in relief, and then he said smilingly, “Luckily you know. Otherwise, it would really be somewhat troublesome.”
