Chapter 2418: Climbing the Mountain!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When he arrived at Eight Void Mountain again, this place no longer had the prosperity of the past.

Back then, there was no idea how many myriad races powerhouses who were gaining enlightenment on Dao on Eight Void Mountain.

But now, Eight Void Mountain was cold and deserted. Those powerhouses were nowhere to be found.

This place was the gateway to the Middle Realms. It would surely be affected by the war.

Continuing to gain enlightenment on Dao here was no different from seeking death.

However, there were always some people who were oblivious to the outside world. There were still some people scattered on Eight Void Mountain.

Ye Yuan walked up the steps. The countless restrictions in front of him were a different sight in his eyes.

Back then, when he was gaining enlightenment on Dao on Eight Void Mountain, his experience and knowledge was still too shallow. He could not discover the nucleus of this huge restriction at all.

Now that he returned again, this restriction was already not as mysterious as back then in his eyes.

Because the foundation of this Formation Dao was passed down by him! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Of course, being less mysterious did not mean that this restriction was nothing great.

Grand Ancestor Skyformation was a supreme existence that reached the level of rules. So how could this restriction power be of the common sort?

This time, Ye Yuan was not here to gain enlightenment on the formations, but he was here to take over this astonishing grand array!

“Eh, isn’t this Young Friend Ye Yuan? Why are you back at Eight Void Mountain in such a troubled time?” Suddenly, a cry of surprise came from not far away.

Ye Yuan looked over. It was Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun who engaged in small talk with him before leaving, when he was comprehending the formations on Eight Void Mountain.

He did not expect that this person was actually still here gaining enlightenment on Dao.

Ye Yuan replied, “So, it’s Fellow Daoist Xiu Yun!”

Xiu Yun focused his eyes and looked, and he could not help sucking in a breath of cold air.

Not seeing him for a short thousand years, Ye Yuan actually already reached peak Heavenly Emperor Realm, and he was only a step away from Deva Realm!

Furthermore, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body was very illusory. He actually could not quite see through.

Xiu Yun could not help feeling a little more solemn in his heart.

“Not seeing for many years, I didn’t expect that Young Friend Ye is already almost becoming a member of my generation! It’s just that Eight Void Mountain’s great battle is nigh. With Young Friend coming to gain enlightenment on Dao at this time, I’m afraid that it’s the wrong time,” Xiu Yun said.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I’m not here to gain enlightenment on Dao.”

Xiu Yun was taken aback and said, “Not comprehending Dao? Then what did Young Friend Ye come here for?”

Ye Yuan did not answer. He instead asked, “Fellow Daoist Xiu Yun, it’s currently troubled times, the human race needs a major power like yourself. You obtained the human race’s inheritance, but want to become a recluse, is this really okay?”

Finished saying, he stopped paying attention to Xiu Yun and continued climbing the steps.

Xiu Yun’s old face turned red, but he became unhappy in his heart.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually did not have any consideration for his face.

“Young Friend Ye, aren’t you the same? What qualifications do you have to talk about me?” Xiu Yun said in a solemn voice.

“I’m different from you!” Ye Yuan did not turn back as he said coolly.

This place was already above 6000 miles!

The restrictions here already reached close to the level of rank three source.

Ye Yuan actually walked through here without any stagnation.

Very soon, he surpassed Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun and continued up.

When Heavenly Emperor Xiu Yun saw this scene, he was dumbstruck with amazement once more.

Could it be that Ye Yuan’s current Formation Dao attainments already surpassed him?

This ... How was this possible?

But Ye Yuan had clearly already surpassed him!

On Eight Void Mountain, whoever walked higher represented whoever was stronger!

This point had already been affirmed by countless formation path powerhouses.

The height that Ye Yuan climbed was higher than him. This indicated that Ye Yuan was stronger than him in formation path strength.

There was no doubt about this at all!

At this height, there were still some sporadic formation path powerhouses. They were all startled by Ye Yuan.

“That kid is the fellow who turned above 3000 miles upside down back then!”

“Not seeing for just a thousand years, his formation path strength is already so terrifying?”

“He doesn’t have the intention of stopping yet. Could it be that he’s still planning on going up?”

... ...

Under the watchful gazes of a group of powerhouses, Ye Yuan slowly went up.

6500 miles!

7000 miles!

8000 miles!

9000 miles!

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied!

The mark of 9000 miles was the watershed between rank two source and rank three source!

Walking until here, meant that Ye Yuan’s formation path strength already reached rank three source!

Except, this was not over yet.

Ye Yuan continued up, 10,000 miles, 13,000 miles, 18,000 miles!

At this time, the powerhouses on Eight Void Mountain were already startled one after another.

A Heavenly Emperor Realm junior actually climbed to a height of 18,000 miles in one go!

That place was the watershed of rank four source!

Those who were able to reach this step were all Deva Fourth Blight supreme powerhouses. Each one was a heaven-shocking important figure.

Now, a young fellow had reached it!

However, Ye Yuan did not seem to have the intention of stopping. He was still going up!

Eight Void Mountain’s grand array, each level one climbed up, the greater the distance that it crossed.

The watershed of rank five source was 40,000 miles!

All the powerhouses on Eight Void Mountain were shocked.

“No way, right? He ... he wouldn’t really go above 40,000 miles, right?”

“This is really too crazy! All my years of living were really utterly wasted!”

“Could it be that his Formation Dao already reached the level of rank five source at a young age? I really don’t dare to believe it!”

... ...

Without the slightest surprise, Ye Yuan walked up to 40,000 miles!

Rank five source!

At this moment, the entire Eight Void Mountain was stirred!

Those Deva Third and Fourth Blight powerhouses even became short of breath.

They already did not remember how long it had been since they lost such composure before.

It was also that right now, the number of people on Eight Void Mountain was too few. Otherwise, at this moment, it would definitely be full of discussions all over the hills and valleys.

However, this was still not the main point!

Ye Yuan was still heading up!

Eight Void Mountain Range, the main peak reached as high as 80,000 miles!

That place was the top of Eight Void Mountain, the place where the ultimate profound intent of Formation Dao lied!

It was just that, there had been so many geniuses since time immemorial, but nobody had ever been on it!

Even for Deva Fifth Blight formation path masters, it was absolutely impossible to climb to the summit too.

Because that place was where rules lay!

That place was where Grand Ancestor Skyformation’s lifelong painstaking effort lay!

It was precisely because of this insurmountable peak that had blocked countless divine race powerhouses.

Above 53,000 miles, Progenitor Yue Feng suddenly opened his eyes, rays of brilliance shooting out of his eyes.

That gaze landed on precisely Ye Yuan.

He was currently the only Deva Fifth Blight formation path sovereign on Eight Void Mountain!

“Who on earth is this boy, to actually climb up to 40,000 miles with the realm of Heavenly Emperor! Looking at his appearance, is it possible that he’s still continuing to go up?” Progenitor Yue Feng exclaimed.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan walked over leisurely.

That appearance was seemingly like admiring the beautiful scenery on this Eight Void Mountain.

Those terrifying to the extreme restrictions did not seem to exist to him at all!

41,000 miles!

45,000 miles!

... ...

53,000 miles!

Ye Yuan finally arrived at Progenitor Yue Feng’s height!

Reaching this level, the remaining land on the mountain was already very small.

The place where Ye Yuan passed through was not far from Progenitor Yue Feng.

However, he did not have the intention of going up to say hello.

At this point now, he did not like the people who still remained on Eight Void Mountain to gain enlightenment on Dao!

“Young Friend, wait!” Progenitor Yue Feng suddenly said.
