Chapter 1834 Divine Vestige Realm

On the stage, two powerful auras gushed out.One was tyrannical, one was proud!

Yang Shen’s aura was peerlessly domineering, while Ye Yuan’s aura was unmoving like a mountain.

This battle was a showdown between the High Clarity Sect and the Shadowmoon Sect, and also a contest between two great supreme laws.

Such an opportunity could not be casually encountered.

“Ye Yuan, hope that you don’t concede defeat! Today, let’s fight to the death. Do you dare or not?” Yang Shen’s gaze was heated as he stared fixedly at Ye Yuan.

Can’t kill the others, he might as well directly have a deathmatch with Ye Yuan.

Yang Shen had absolute confidence in himself. There was no way he would lose to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had a calm look as he said, “As you wish.”

Yang Shen laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha, Ye Yuan, the humiliation that you brought to my High Clarity Sect, I’ll wash it all clean today! You are dead for sure!”

Ye Yuan’s expression was calm as he said, “That will depend on whether you have this ability or not!”

Yang Shen sneered and said, “You have a supreme law. But I have a supreme law too. In fact, I’m two minor realms higher than you! What do you have to beat me with? Today, I’ll let you take a look at my true strength! What my High Clarity Sect has to become the number one sect!”

Facing Yang Shen, Ye Yuan’s biggest disadvantage was his cultivation realm.

Ye Yuan was currently merely initial-stage First Firmament Celestial Deity, while Yang Shen was peak Second Firmament Celestial Deity. It was equivalent to being two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan.

These two minor realms did not seem to be much in the initial stages of Divine Dao. But at the Celestial Deity Realm, these two minor realms were sufficient to be deadly.

Even for a genius like Baili Qingyan, breaking through two minor realms step by step also required several hundred years. The gap could only be imagined.

“Kill!”

With a fierce cry, Yang Shen hacked over toward Ye Yuan with a matchlessly overbearing saber blow.

This saber pressed forward with an indomitable will!

What was even more frightening was that Yang Shen’s world power was extremely strong, overbearing until it seized all of the space as its own, not giving Ye Yuan any place to survive at all.

In front of this saber, Ye Yuan appeared too weak.

At this time, Ye Yuan moved too.

The Frostcounter Sword swinging, Ye Yuan’s figure cut through space, welcoming Yang Shen’s saber.

This Frostcounter Sword was a celestial deity mystic treasure!

After the Junyi Sword shattered, Ye Yuan had no convenient weapon all along.

After Ye Yuan broke through to rank five, Ye Yuan finally opened up the Purple Extreme Hall’s second layer space, obtaining the treasure trove inside.

He chose a celestial deity mystic treasure from among them, it was this Frostcounter Sword.

At the same time, dense blue patterns revolved around Ye Yuan.

One sword unleashing, it actually directly broke through the heavy blockade of Yang Shen’s world power, charging in front of Yang Shen without any obstruction.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Horrifying power of laws roamed about on the stage, giving off a series of rings.

In a blink of an eye, the two people exchanged more than ten moves, power of law surging endlessly.

Evenly matched!

Yang Shen’s pupils constricted. His realm was clearly much higher than Ye Yuan’s, but his world power was actually unable to affect Ye Yuan in the slightest.

What in the world was that blue pattern?

Below the stage, everyone was extremely shocked.

The level of these two people’s battle, they were simply unable to imagine it.

The 64 people taking part in the Bamboo Groove Martial Conclave were all the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s top geniuses.

But these two people towered about the group of geniuses, reaching another level.

“Ye Yuan’s blue pattern is so strange. It’s actually not affected by Yang Shen’s world power. It’s like where Ye Yuan goes, it forcefully hews open a space that belongs to him. What in the world is that thing?”

At this time, Little Tong was holding Treasure Pig, currently standing together with Du Rufeng.

This place was the place with the best view.

Little Tong was also very interested in this fight, he naturally would not miss it.

Hearing Du Rufeng inquire, his two eyes narrowed slightly and he said, “It’s ... Heavenly Dao!”

Du Rufeng’s face changed and he cried out in surprise, “H-Heavenly Dao? How is this possible?”

Little Tong used a tone that was not commensurate with his age and said with a solemn look, “It won’t be wrong. That’s the aura of Dao! Ye Yuan’s comprehension toward the Dao has already reached an inconceivable realm. He can already spur Heavenly Dao to use for himself. Although this aura isn’t strong enough yet, as his strength improves, this Heavenly Dao pattern will become more and more terrifying!”

Hearing Little Tong’s explanation, the shock in Du Rufeng’s heart could not be any greater.

Controlling Heavenly Dao for one’s own use, this kind of thing, ordinary people did not even dare to think about it, but Ye Yuan already did it.

Martial artists comprehend Heavenly Dao to strengthen themselves.

But Ye Yuan could actually drive Heavenly Dao, this was too terrifying!

Actually, Little Tong was half-right.

These blue patterns were indeed the aura of Heavenly Dao, but it was not Heavenly Dao that Ye Yuan was spurring on.

These blue fine lines were Ye Yuan’s own!

Other people breaking through to rank five, what they reached was Celestial Deity Realm. However, Ye Yuan embarked on a different path. His realm would naturally not be the same as well.

After Ye Yuan broke through to rank five, his divine sea underwent a change once more.

His divine vortex shrunk again, chaos divine essence also becoming more condensed.

That viscous aura already became thicker and thicker. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

If one was to say the divine sea was as big as a lake in the beginning, then Ye Yuan’s current divine vortex was at most the size of a pond.

Not only did Ye Yuan’s divine essence not weaken, but it also grew even stronger than before instead.

Apart from this, countless blue lightning was born in Ye Yuan’s divine sea.

These blue bolts of lightning were extremely similar to what he saw back then on the Heavenspan Mountain. It was just that in terms of aura, it was much, much weaker; totally not on the same level.

Ye Yuan discovered that when he faced the enemy, he could mobilize these blue lightning and make his attacks sharper. His defenses also became stronger.

As for world power, it was even more like paper paste in front of the blue patterns.

As long as it was not strong to a certain degree, Ye Yuan could split it apart easily.

Hence, Ye Yuan named this realm, Divine Vestige Realm!

Outsiders could not tell, but Yang Shen keenly felt his own suffering.

Ye Yuan’s sword seemed ordinary and sloppy. But an extremely strange force was contained within, throwing his vital-energy sea into turmoil, virtually unable to control himself.

With several dozen swords, he actually had a feeling of the long sword slipping out of his hand.

“No way! This kid is too peculiar. I can’t carry on like this!”

Yang Shen knew that at this rate, he would lose without a doubt.

“Time law!”

Right at this time, he urged time law to the extreme.

Ye Yuan’s face changed and suddenly felt that his movements became slow like an ant.

Even shuttling through space also became much slower.

Yang Shen grinned hideously and said, “How can the profundities of time laws be what you can imagine! Let me tell you! Actually, the time law that I used on them was not my full strength at all! My time law has similarly been comprehended to third firmament! Didn’t expect it, right? Now, you can go to hell! Unparalleled World Suppressing Saber!”

Right at this time, Yang Shen urged his saber arts to the extreme as well. The incomparably swift and fierce martial technique was practically shredding the space.

This blade wanted Ye Yuan’s life!
