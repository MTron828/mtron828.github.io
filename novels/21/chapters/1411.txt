1415 Bai Chen“s Hope

“Young Lord is back! Young Lord, you finally came back! Things are bad!”

Upon reaching the White Night Sacred Palace, a steward-looking old man came up to greet them.

Bai Chen’s expression changed and he said, “Uncle Ji, what happened?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Uncle Ji had a heartbroken look as he said weepingly, “Master ... Master he ... is almost on his last legs!”

This news was akin to a bolt out of the blue, making everyone’s expression changed drastically.

Bai Chen grabbed Uncle Ji and asked, “I was only gone for half a year, what in the world happened?”

Suddenly, the Bai Chong by the side started laughing crazily, “Hahahaha ... This old fellow is finally going to die! He deserves death! Hahaha ...”

Bang!

A buzz went off in Bai Chen’s head. He gave Bai Chong a kick in an uncontrollable rage, kicking him to the ground.

“Treacherous villain! You, what in the world did you do to Royal Father?”

Bai Chong getting hit by the kick, his mouth was full of fresh blood.

But he did not care at all and still laughed crazily as he said, “This miserable old fool! I’m so outstanding. Why doesn’t he pick me? Not picking me, he deserves to die! Deserves to die! Hahaha ...”

Bai Chong’s entire person fell into a state of madness. The long suppressed discontentment in his heart all erupted in this instant.

“You!”

Bai Chen’s palm was raised in the air but kept failing to find it in him to land it.

He wished to kill this elder brother with a palm, but he could not do it.

“Hahaha, kill! Kill me! Let me tell you, the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s powerhouses are already on the way! If you kill me, all of you have to be buried in death with me! Now, your only way out is to let me go and let me succeed the position of palace lord!” Bai Chong said arrogantly.

One sentence made everyone’s hearts sink to the bottom of the valley.

Mo Yun gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “You treacherous villain, truly devoid of all conscience! A person like you becoming the palace lord, the White Night Sacred Palace will be ruined in your hands sooner or later! Palace Lord was quite prescient to not choose you to be the young lord!”

“Humph! Bai Chen becoming the palace lord will let the White Night Sacred Palace to a bad end! You see, he, this coward, doesn’t even dare to kill me! Hahaha! My good younger brother, you kill me! Kill! You ...”

Swish!

Bai Chong’s arrogant voice abruptly ceased, fresh blood splattering all over Bai Chen’s face.

Bai Chen’s expression changed, his gaze looking over toward Ye Yuan in surprise.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you keep dawdling, your royal father will be dead.”

Bai Chen’s expression changed and could not be bothered to wipe the fresh blood on his face, sprinting over towards the palace.

“All don’t be in a daze anymore, go in and take a look, see if you can be of any help or not.”

Ye Yuan did not care about everyone’s shocked gazes. Lifting his foot, he headed towards the depths of the palace too.

Mo Yun suddenly startled awake and followed after too.

When Ye Yuan saw the already dying White Night Palace Lord, he knew that he was already deeply poisoned and a goner.

Poison entering the heart, even if he could refine a Two-star divine pill right now, it could not save the White Night Palace Lord either.

As expected, before long, news of the palace lord’s demise came from the depths of the palace.

Mo Yun arranged a quiet place for Ye Yuan and he took up his quarters in peace.

While at this time, a battle of heirs was currently playing out in the White Night Sacred Palace.

The White Night Palace Lord did not just have Bai Chong and Bai Chen, two sons. Bai Chen still had quite a few older brothers.

Now, the palace lord had passed, the various factions were starting to become restless and eager to take action.

Bai Chen was the palace lord’s youngest son. Appointing him as the young lord originally had many people refusing to accept.

It was just that Bai Chen indeed lived up to expectations, breaking through to the Deity Realm at a young age. Plus, there was the old palace lord holding down the fort, that was why nobody dared to gossip.

It was just too bad that Bai Chen had not completely grown up yet and the old palace lord was harmed by Bai Chong. This made the others see hope.

“Mo Yun, the urgent matter on hand is to resist the outside enemy! Bai Chen is still young and normally isn’t in charge of the palace’s affairs too, it’s hard to convince the masses! Making him lead everyone to go and resist the enemy, isn’t it courting our doom?”

“Yeah! Currently, in this sort of situation, we should choose a son with high prestige and commands universal respect to succeed the position of palace lord!”

“The Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s people are about to reach soon. Young Lord’s bit of strength, could it be letting him lead us to go and fight with them?”

...

A group of people was trying to get a word in. In short, they were questioning that Bai Chen was young and unable to take on big responsibilities.

Confronted by a great enemy, it was just nice to become the excuse for them to force an abdication.

Mo Yun gave a cold snort and said, “The palace lord appointed the young lord in order to succeed him! Young Lord Bai Chen succeeding the position of palace lord is right and proper! The old palace lord’s corpse has yet to turn cold and you all did such a thing. The old palace lord will die with everlasting regret!”

“That’s not right! It’s a matter of expediency. Right now, it’s extraordinary times, there naturally needs to be extraordinary measures! Bai Chen’s strength and prestige are insufficient to convince the masses no matter what. How can he succeed the position of palace lord?” An elder came forward to refute.

“Want to talk about high prestige and commanding universal respect, I feel that it still belongs to Deputy Palace Lord, Bai Xiu. The old palace is not around anymore. In the entire White Night Sacred Palace, his strength is the strongest. The sacred palace’s aspects, it’s also him who understands them best! Since everybody is currently debating endlessly, in my view, let Deputy Palace Lord Bai Xiu temporarily act in the position of palace lord. What does everyone think?”

Suddenly, an elder’s words broke the balance of the scene.

Everyone did not expect that a Deputy Palace Lord Bai Xiu actually charged out halfway.

It was just that they calmed down and thought about it. This current sort of situation, there was really no one more suitable than Deputy Palace Lord Bai Xiu.

Bai Xiu was currently sitting on the seat of honor, both eyes narrowed slightly, seemingly in a daze.

When he suddenly heard this, he got a shock too and hurriedly said, “No way, no way! The White Night Sacred Palace’s tradition has always been palace lord passing to young lord. Where is the logic of palace lord passing to deputy palace lord? If I really become the palace lord, everybody will feel that I’m scheming to usurp the throne and it will be even harder to convince the masses! Don’t mention this matter again! How about this, since everybody can’t come to a conclusion, let’s discuss it again tomorrow. As for the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s activities, I’ve already arranged people to keep an eye on it. There still aren’t any movements for the time being. Uh ... that’s it for today.”

The palace lord was already deceased. Bai Xiu was currently the person with the highest prestige and respect in the entire White Night Sacred Palace. His strength was also the strongest.

His words won the group of elders’ favorable impression even more.

Very soon, inside the great hall was stark empty. There was only Mo Yun master and disciple, two people, left in the hall.

Bai Chen’s entire person was battered out of his senses. He did not say a word from start to end.

His thoughts were not on contending for the seat of palace lord at all. The blow that the death of the old palace lord had on him was tremendous. He still had not come back to his senses currently.

Seeing Bai Chen’s dejected and disheartened appearance, Mo Yun was burning with anxiety too.

“Young Lord! If you carry on like this, the position of palace lord will be gone!” Mo Yun said anxiously.

Bai Chen looked at Mo Yun with a pair of listless eyes and said, “Gone then gone. What they said was right. I’m not suited to be this palace lord at all.”

Mo Yun sucked in a deep breath and said solemnly, “Young Lord, you think properly, how much did the old palace lord worry over the White Night Sacred Palace? In order to let you be the young lord, how much did he rack his brain? Could it be that you’re going to hand over his life’s effort to people on a silver platter, then be swallowed up by the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace? You’re the old palace lord’s favorite successor. Could it be that you’re really going to let him die with everlasting regrets?”

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled, his eyes finally had an additional trace of light.

But, he dimmed down again very quickly and said, “But ... under these current circumstances, we already don’t have a trace of hope anymore!”

When Mo Yun saw Bai Chen finally pull it together a little, a ray of hope finally ignited in his heart.

He plucked his spirits up and said, “No, we still have hope!”

Bai Chen’s eyes revealed a hint of puzzlement and said, “Still have hope? You look. Right now in this place, there’s only you and me left!”

Mo Yun said, “Go find Lord Ye Yuan! He’s our last hope!”
