Chapter 2862 Expounding the Pros and Cons!

“You’re full of yourself.”

The judge looked at the Yang Qing in the dust and said nonchalantly.

It served him right!

This was what everyone present was thinking.

Yang Qing got to his feet, looking at the judge with an unfriendly expression as he said, “Humph humph! Old man, change is the only constant thing; the wheel of fortune turns! After my cultivation realm catches up to you, I’ll definitely smack you into the ground!”

Smack him!

Smack him to death!

Everyone was shouting in their hearts.

However, the judge actually gave him a profound glance and said with a nod, “Boy, you’re pretty good! I’ll lend you this field!”

Yang Qing snorted again and said, “Don’t think that lending the field can resolve the grudge; I’m very vengeful!”

The judge laughed loudly and said, “Alright. Then I’ll wait for you!”

Yang Qing was not long-winded either, leaping onto the stage. Cao Dian also followed closely behind.

The moment the two people made their moves, they were their strongest attacks!

But this time, they saw Yang Qing’s spear clearly.

A domineering spear!

Boom!

It was only to hear a loud noise. Cao Dian shot out backward, but Yang Qing did not budge an inch.

With one strike, the level was immediately established!

Everyone was incredibly shocked.

This was also too bloody freakish, right?

“I … lost!” Cao Dian threw down a sentence, turned around and left.

The entire audience was in shock!

With one heavenly pill, Yang Qing soared to the sky with one bound and became number one in True Sovereign Heaven?

Unbelievable!

What the hell kind of heavenly pill was this? Could you give me one?

“You trash, you mocked your Grandpa Qing daily for the past few days. Now, does this slap feel good? Hahaha …” Yang Qing put away his long spear and laughed rampantly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Those people who had mocked him before wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

How could they have expected this kind of heaven-defying rise! “Yang Qing, what are you being cocky for! If not for Ye Yuan, what the hell are you?” Zheng Qian said with refusal to accept it as final.

“Yeah! The impressive one is Ye Yuan. What does it have to do with you?”

“You’ve performed all of his posturings, do you really think that you’re very impressive?”

Everyone seemed to have found a relief outlet, rebutting Yang Qing frenziedly.

Yang Qing did not care in the slightest and showed off. He said, “Your Father can beat you all down by having such an awesome brother! If you’re not convinced, bring it on!”

Everyone was speechless.

You make a lot of sense. I actually have nothing to say in reply!

Why did we not have a brother like Ye Yuan?

Hence, the news of Ye Yuan defying the heavens with one pill swept throughout the entire Extreme Medicine Sect once more.

The entire sect was incredibly shocked.

Although the one who swept across True Sovereign Heaven was Yang Qing, everyone’s discussion was more focused on Ye Yuan. It was because the one who created this miracle was Ye Yuan!

Even those Emperor Realm powerhouses and high level heavenly alchemists, were all shocked too.

Such a heaven-defying heavenly pill, how did Ye Yuan refine it?

Even if it was an all-attributes heavenly pill, it would not be to an extent of being so heaven-defying too, right?”

Just what kind of additional material did Ye Yuan add?

These people suddenly discovered that after Ye Yuan entered the sect, it seemed like all of the limelight had been snatched away by him alone!

The Infinite Comprehensive Pill was hailed as the hardest in history!

Ye Yuan was just grade five realm, and he actually refined it.

Not only did he refine it, but the medicinal effect was also mind bogglingly amazing!

Didn’t this mean that Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength already surpassed many grade eight heavenly alchemists?

This was a … freaking joke, right?

Didn’t you just enter profound grade for ten years?

What right do you have to be so impressive?

Of course, this kind of small scene had nothing to do with Ye Yuan. He had already entered the Extreme Light Pavilion.

As Hegemon Cloudmount’s little disciple, the sect had no choice but to take his words seriously.

Moreover, he just gave the sect such great kindness!

“Little Junior Brother, this matter affects the situation as a whole. The implications are too big!” Li Clearcloud said with a solemn expression.

A pavilion elder said, “I disagree as well! If people learn our things and run out to establish a sect, then our Extreme Medicine Sect will have many opponents out of the blue!”

“Little Martial Uncle, your seniority is high, but some ideas are still too naive!”

……

In the Extreme Light Pavilion, virtually all the pavilion elders were opposed to Ye Yuan’s proposition.

This kind of idea was too fanciful and fallacious!

Creating many opponents out of the blue for themselves, this was a way of digging their own grave!

This notion was already deeply entrenched in the hearts of people.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a smile, “Pray tell, everyone. Since the Heaven One Alliance was established, how many powerhouses has our Heaven One Continent given birth to? Which powerhouses did our Extreme Medicine Sect give birth to?”

Li Clearcloud’s brows furrowed, and he shook his head and said, “Our Extreme Medicine Sect didn’t give birth to any true powerhouses. There have even been hundreds of Emperor Realm powerhouses who have already fallen because of the war! As for the other sects, there are mostly the same! In fact, they are even worse off than us!”

“That’s it!” Ye Yuan said calmly, “After the Heaven One Alliance was established, it seemed like everyone was united. But until now, you’re still only clearing away the snow in front of your own doors! Not only did our strength not get stronger, but we’re also being weakened by the blood race non-stop instead! In contrast, the blood race grew stronger the more they fought, and their powerhouses got more and more! I don’t know how long more the Absolute Heaven Barrier can still resist, but if things continue like this, we probably won’t be able to resist any more!” The Extreme Light Pavilion’s pavilion elders had all gone to the front-lines before and fought with the blood race!

Over these few thousand years, quite a number of the Extreme Light Pavilion’s pavilion elders had actually fallen too!

These were all origin powerhouses, with hopes of stepping into Hegemon Realm in the future!

As for the other sects, that went even more without saying.

“Many people in the sect have never been to the front-lines before. They probably don’t know the cruelty and dangers there at all, and they also don’t have much sense of danger. In fact, they even think that our Hegemon Realms are very strong, and they can keep the blood race’s powerhouses outside of the Absolute Heaven Barrier! But in reality? I saw strong worry on Master Cloudmount and Senior Apprentice Brother Pinespring’s faces! Even existences of their level completely don’t have the confidence too, right?”

“At this current situation, the various major sects are still thinking of preserving strength, pending to stage a comeback. It’s just that do they have this chance? I don’t believe that those Hegemon Realms can’t see this! But I feel that Divine Lord is probably lacking an opportunity! Since nobody is willing to take the lead, then why don’t … our Extreme Medicine Sect break this stalemate!”

“Furthermore, I don’t feel that opening up resources will cause huge losses to the sect. On the contrary, I feel that it can make us become stronger instead! The Extreme Medicine Sect is an alchemy path leviathan, but the other sects similarly have their own foundations! If we open up resources, it can let those small sects undergo a mutual exchange of resources! Our disciples are elites among elites. Could it be that they would lose to them?”

ILII

Ye Yuan said a whole bunch at great length, expounding on the pros and cons.

Ye Yuan had already prepared these words for a long time, making those pavilion lords dazed from listening

Should these things be what you, a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven, consider?

Hearing you speak, you directly substituted yourself as Divine Lord, His Excellency!

However, each and every one of these pavilion elders was incredibly shocked in their hearts.

Ye Yuan’s development was too big!

When they were still conflicted about the sect’s interests, Ye Yuan had long already jumped out of the sect and placed his horizons across the entire Heaven One Continent, even the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

In reality, when Ye Yuan was at Northern View City, he had already understood from Zuo Chen in-depth about the present situation. These plans, he had long already worked them out.

Talking about it at this time, it was enlightening the benighted. Proposing something like this from the perspective of Divine Lord, that was incredibly difficult

It was because he had to balance the various great Hegemons and could not let anyone suffer a loss in benefits.

Otherwise, this alliance would be done for.

But breaking this bottleneck from the Extreme Medicine Sect could not be better. Once the Extreme Medicine Sect did it, the situation would be broken.

Divine Lord would be able to push the boat along the current and carry out a transformation on the entire Heaven One Alliance, achieving a fusion!

Only this kind of fusion could let Heaven One become stronger!

Otherwise, they could only be encroached upon by the blood race step by step, and then all of them would fall into the enemy’s hands in the end.
