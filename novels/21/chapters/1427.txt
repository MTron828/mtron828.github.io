Chapter 1431 Testing Blood

No idea how long had passed either, the pain finally subsided. Azurepeak’s four limbs finally recovered some mobility.

However, he only barely managed to stand up after trying for a long time.

His entire person seemed to be drained, without a trace of strength from head to foot.

During this long time, he maintained clarity of his consciousness from start to end but was utterly helpless.

Every hint of pain on his body was transmitted into his brain clearly, like tidewater; without break.

Azurepeak very much wanted to faint, but he discovered to his dismay that he could not do it at all!

This period of time was simply even worse than death!

“Damn White Night Sacred Palace! If I discover that Ye Yuan is an intruder, I’ll definitely not spare even the chickens and dogs!” Azurepeak gnashed his teeth and said in hatred.

At this time, Bai Xiu’s voice sounded out from outside the door.

“Has Lord Azurepeak rested well? Palace lord and Grand Elder have made this lowly one come and invite Lord Divine Envoy to the great hall.”

Huo ... 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The door was opened violently from the inside. Azurepeak’s face was sullen until water was virtually about to drip out.

Rest?

That was called rest just now?

He was hurting until he was practically about to commit suicide just now, you guys actually said that it was resting!

Azurepeak wanted to kill people right now!

He really wanted to kill people!

“What’s with Lord Azurepeak? Could it be that you’re blaming our White Night Sacred Palace for the poor reception? Lord Divine Envoy suffered the backlash force and injured the internal organs. Grand Elder said that he helped Lord Divine Envoy purge the hidden injuries with a special technique, there’s absolutely no sequela. Could it be that ... Grand Elder he didn’t cure Lord Divine Envoy’s hidden injuries?” Bai Xiu pretended to be surprised.

Azurepeak was just about to flare up when he suddenly frowned.

He viewed internally and discovered that the internal injuries he suffered because of the backlash force were indeed already cured. The meridians in his whole body were unobstructed and actually had a refreshing feeling!

This discovery made his expression ease up slightly.

Could it be that ... that Ye Yuan really treated him?

Recalling that palm of his, the backlash force was indeed not small. It would likely leave behind considerable hidden injuries.

Now, the injuries were completely healed. Clearly, he had obtained treatment.

It was just that this treatment ... was a little too painful, right?

“Mn, the hidden injuries are already healed! Lead the way!” Azurepeak said coldly.

This Azurepeak, as a divine envoy, was clearly an extremely prideful person.

Since the other party was really treating him, he did not wish to let the other party know such a deplorable side of him.

Bai Xiu already had flowers bloom in his heart long ago. If he was not in front of Azurepeak, he would practically be laughing until he rolled on the ground.

But Bai Xiu was not Bai Chen that sort of little chap. He was in a high position all year round. His shrewdness was rather deep.

He did not show the slightest hint of emotion on the surface.

Ye Yuan invited him to watch a good show. That scene of Azurepeak rolling about on the ground in pain previously, he saw it all clearly outside the window.

How smart was Bai Xiu? He knew that it was Ye Yuan’s underhanded trick done in secret.

Originally, he was still apprehensive, worried that Azurepeak would utterly rampage after coming out.

But when he said it according to the words Ye Yuan taught him, he discovered that Azurepeak’s complexion immediately became much better.

Just as Ye Yuan said, not only would he not blame, he would even be secretly grateful in his heart.

Currently, he was simply prostrating on all fours in admiration toward this grand elder.

Azurepeak sucking in cold air while on the ground in pain, he heard it clearly outside.

To be able to make a grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouse agonized until he wished he was dead, that pain could be imagined.

Heh!

Not only did he not assign blame, but his reaction was also really calm and smooth!

This method, probably only Grand Elder, this kind of figure, could accomplish it, right?

...

Coming to the great hall, Ye Yuan greeted with a smile and said with clasped hands, “White Night Sacred Palace’s grand elder, Ye Yuan, respectfully welcomes Lord Divine Envoy! Previously, this Ye Yuan was in closed-seclusion, resulting in slighting Lord Divine Envoy. Truly sorry! This Ye apologizes and asks Lord Divine Envoy for punishment!”

Ye Yuan’s attitude was very sincere like he was really going to bow down.

Azurepeak hurriedly supported his arm and said coolly, “No need!”

Ye Yuan said joyfully, “Lord Divine Envoy is indeed an exalted envoy, with a broad breadth of mind! Oh, right, the cultivation method that this Ye cultivates is rather peculiar. Once somebody draws near, there will be an extremely powerful backlash force, resulting in accidentally injuring Your Excellency. This Ye is truly guilty and deserves ten thousand deaths! Fortunately, this Ye has some unique methods and helped Lord Divine Envoy open up the meridians, relieving the hidden injuries. This method is a bit painful, but the effects are very good. I wonder if Your Excellency still has ailments now?”

Azurepeak’s muscles twitched slightly. It was more than a bit painful. It was simply painful until he wished to die!

However, the effects were really good!

Otherwise, if he went back to report completion of the mission with hidden injuries, he really had no idea how he would be laughed at.

“Mn, it’s already well!” Azurepeak still said coolly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then that’s good! Since Lord Divine Envoy already arrived, then let’s get down to business first! This Ye was just a reclusive cultivator previously, how am I some intruder? Some people like to cause trouble by spreading rumors, truly detestable!”

Seeing Ye Yuan so calm, Azurepeak unwittingly really started to somewhat doubt it in his heart.

Although this rumor started from god knows where, without a doubt, the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s suspicions were the greatest.

But, as long as there was a trace of possibility, the Sky Foothill Divine Palace would not let it go either.

Furthermore, such an expert suddenly emerged, how could they possibly not be careful?

“Whether or not it’s a rumor, we’ll know after testing!” Azurepeak still continued his indifferent style.

Finished talking, Azurepeak slightly formed a seal. A box-sized shrine rested on his palm.

Ye Yuan was currently in a position of face-to-face with Azurepeak. This distance, if the Tianlu Shrine had a response, it should have long unleashed an attack.

But the Tianlu Shrine did not have any movements at all!

Seeing this scene, everyone in the White Night Sacred Palace all heaved a long sigh in relief.

“Like I said, how can Grand Elder possibly be an intruder?”

“It must be the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace, that bunch of bastards! After the miserable defeat this time, they harbored hatred in their hearts and deliberately fabricated rumors!”

“Damn Autumn Rain Sacred Palace, we are not done with them!”

...

The White Night Sacred Palace’s powerhouses all pointed the spearheads at the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace, obviously thinking that this was their idea.

However, the worry of Bai Chen and Mo Yun, in the two person’s hearts, did not disappear at this point.

After all, the most crucial part of the Tianlu Shrine was still the blood test this checkpoint!

Sure enough, Azurepeak said coolly, “The aura on the surface can be disguised. But, the Heavenly Dao laws contained in the martial artist’s blood cannot be disguised! Elder Ye, please!”

A martial artist’s growth was the process of absorbing heaven and earth spiritual energy.

During this process, one would naturally bring the aura of Heavenly Dao into their own blood too.

Hence, verifying a martial artist’s identity, the most reliable was still blood!

When Mo Yun and Bai Chen duo heard this, their hearts leaped to their throats.

The rest also stopped the din, looking towards Ye Yuan with unmoving eyes.

The instances of finding out using blood were not few!

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and did not hesitate either.

Only to see a cold light flash. Ye Yuan’s finger had a gash added to it.

Drip!

A drop of fresh blood flowed down the fingertip and dripped into the Tianlu Shrine.

Everyone’s breathing all became ragged!
