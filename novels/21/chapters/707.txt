Chapter 711: Counter-suppression

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hear that or not? I know that you guys are all first-rate geniuses in the Lower Realms with your own pride. However . . .”

Cheng Jiang deliberately dragged it out and said with a solemn face, “Your pride isn’t worth a penny in the Divine Realm!”

Ye Yuan looked at Cheng Jiang and could not help laughing as he said, “Perhaps I really don’t have the capital to be arrogant in front of a genuine expert. But in front of you . . .”

Ye Yuan did not finish talking, But the meaning of his words was already very clear.

He, Ye Yuan, was proud!

As proud as when he was in the Lower Realms!

When Cheng Jiang heard Ye Yuan’s words but did not show an enraged expression.

Their objective of being here was in order to make those ascenders be obedient, let them know that after ascending, they had to tuck their tails between their legs and behave.

Otherwise, if these ascenders were all arrogant to the extreme, how would they manage?

Ye Yuan’s behavior was also within Cheng Jiang’s expectations. Or should he say, every ascender’s attitude was about the same as Ye Yuan’s.

Those two previously were like that too. Now, weren’t they still docile and obedient?

“Hah, is that so? Then . . . I’ll have to take a look at your pride!”

Cheng Jiang’s voice had yet to fade when a surge of powerful essence energy instantly crashed over towards Ye Yuan, directly enveloping Ye Yuan inside.

The elder and youth other there could not quite bear to look steadily at it.

They knelt down to this move of Cheng Jiang’s earlier and did not even have strength leftover to retaliate.

What was exasperating was that the two of them were both Boundless Realm experts!

First Level Boundless Realm versus First Level Boundless Realm and they actually did not even have strength leftover to counterattack.

They only struggled a little before conceding dejectedly. That scene earlier even made them somewhat doubtful about life.

Could it be that these years of cultivation were all cultivated into a dog’s stomach? Or were the Divine Realm’s martial artists all powerful to this sort of degree?

They ended up like this even though they were Boundless Realm. Wouldn’t Ye Yuan, a freshly broken through Second Level Divine Traversing brat, be crushed until half-dead?

“Hey, Old Huang, you look! It looks odd!” that youth suddenly said to the elderly man.

Old Huang looked over at Ye Yuan there, his expression involuntarily changed.

“He . . . Why is he totally fine? This . . . This isn’t right!” Old Huang said in amazement.

Over there, Ye Yuan was being pressured by Cheng Jiang’s aura, but he was perfectly calm and collected. It was as if Cheng Jiang did not do anything at all.

Yet, the violent essence energy undulation around Ye Yuan clearly told everyone that Cheng Jiang was really putting pressure on Ye Yuan.

“Huhu, essence energy suppression is it? This is your opening gambit? Doesn’t look like much to me,” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Cheng Jiang’s expression was ugly as he said, “You . . . How is this possible?! You, an ascender, moreover, only Second Level Divine Traversing, are actually able to withstand my essence energy suppression! I don’t believe it!”

Cheng Jiang clearly could not accept this truth. Hence, he mustered up all the essence energy in his body.

The coercion of a Boundless Realm crushed over towards Ye Yuan overwhelmingly.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “Thickheaded!”

The next instant, Ye Yuan’s aura was fully released!

The violent essence energy abruptly burst out, forcing back Cheng Jiang’s suppression immediately!

Cheng Jiang did not expect that Ye Yuan actually still had strength leftover to counterattack. Caught off-guard all at once, he was forced back by Ye Yuan until his bottom plopped onto the ground directly.

Ye Yuan sneered coldly in his heart incessantly.

Cheng Jiang’s methods, he was all too clear. Merely taking advantage of his cultivation time in the Divine Realm being long.

To really talk about comprehension towards cultivation realm, he might not even be stronger than an ascender.

The so-called essence energy suppression was actually because the Divine Realm’s essence energy was not only thicker compared to the Lower Realms, it was purer compared to the Lower Realms’ essence energy too.

Therefore, the martial artists cultivating in the Divine Realm, the essence energy within their bodies were many times purer compared to Lower Realms’ martial artists!

Similarly, First Level Boundless Realm, the essence energy within Cheng Jiang’s body was much purer than Old Huang’s!

But how could Cheng Jiang have thought that what Ye Yuan cultivated was the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art that caused a stir in the entire Divine Realm!

Even if Ye Yuan was cultivating in the Lower Realms, the essence energy he absorbed into his body was also refined and extracted through the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art.

Compared to Cheng Jiang, Ye Yuan’s essence energy was God knows how many times purer!

Therefore, him wanting to use essence energy to suppress and deal with Ye Yuan was simply a joke.

Ye Yuan arriving at the Divine Realm, although he was unable to jump realms and battle by a large margin like in the Lower Realms, dealing with a bottom-level soldier like Cheng Jiang was still achievable.

“No way, right? This . . . This brat is so strong!” on the platform, Old Huang exclaimed in shock.

Even though the youth did not speak, the expression on his face was exactly the same as Old Huang’s. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When Cheng Jiang’s big brother saw this scene, his face could not help revealing a look of astonishment.

These few years, Cheng Jiang had never dropped the ball before when taking action to deal with the lower realms’ ascenders.

Didn’t expect that today, he failed miserably in a very simple task.

“Boy, you’re courting death!”

Cheng Jiang did not expect to actually have his face swept away by an ascender. He flew into a violent rage all at once and was about to step forward and make a move.

But he had yet to move and was stopped by Big Brother.

“Cheng Jiang, don’t be rash!”

As he said, he came in front of Ye Yuan and bowed with his hands folded in front as he said, “Little Brother has such pure essence energy. This one is Yu Ming. I wonder what’s Little Brother’s name?”

Ye Yuan was not some impetuous person who just ascended. He knew the Divine Realm’s matters like the palm of his own hand.

These two people were merely soldiers here to guard the ascension pool. They still had a powerful force behind them and could not be offended at all.

In the end, Ye Yuan was only an ascender now as well. His strength was too weak!

Earlier, making a move to deal with Cheng Jiang was also just taking him down a notch, and make them not casually knead him.

Since this Yu Ming had the intentions of getting friendly now, Ye Yuan was naturally happy to oblige.

“You flatter me. This one is Ye Yuan.”

“So, it’s Little Brother Ye. This brother of mine is too reckless when doing things. Just now, he offended you. But restraining ascenders is also where our brothers’ duties lie. Little Brother Ye, please don’t take offense.”

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Big Brother Yu is overly sensitive. This small matter, this Ye will not go to the extent of taking it to heart.”

Yu Ming originally thought that since Ye Yuan was young and his strength was formidable too, he probably would not be too easygoing. Didn’t expect that he was so astute.

Except, because of this, Yu Ming regarded Ye Yuan even more higher.

This boy was bound to be a major figure in the future.

At least, he would be an existence that them brothers needed to look up to.

Such a person, one either had to exterminate him immediately now or get on friendly terms in advance. At least, one could not offend too much.

“Haha, then that’s good, then that’s good! Little Brother Ye’s essence energy is so pure. It’s really not like a newly ascended martial artist!” Yu Ming said with a laugh.

“Big Brother Yu is too kind. It’s just that the cultivation method that this Ye cultivates in is a little special. To really come to blows, I probably won’t be Big Brother Yu’s match.” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

This Yu Ming’s shrewdness was very deep, wanting to test Ye Yuan. But Ye Yuan yielded cleverly, lightly skating over this topic.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan only said that he was not Yu Ming’s match. But he did not say that he was not Cheng Jiang’s match.

Yu Ming was slightly apprehensive in his heart and also put away the thought of probing. With a big laugh, he said, “Little Brother Ye is too modest!”
