Chapter 2262: A Stroke of Genius!

Skyfame Great Imperial Capital was not the same as other cities, with endless streams of horses and carriages, being so crowded with people.

Ye Yuan arrived outside the city gates and could not help being taken aback.

A girl was standing there, already welcoming him.

The girl greeted with folded hands at the lower right side and smiled brightly as she said, “Xiyue has been waiting here for a long time. Sir seems to be very surprised to see Xiyue?”

This woman was none other than the Rong Xiyue who he happened to meet once before!

Rong Xiyue was Southridge Ten Nations’ Cloudjade Imperial City’s princess, who later entered Linghua Pavilion.

Back then, she instigated behind the scenes to have people frame Jiang Jadehall.

Later, under Ye Yuan’s compelling power, Rong Xiyue had no choice but to come over and extend a formal apology.

Ye Yuan did not expect that it was actually this woman controlling everything at the back!

What deep scheming!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “You’re of the divine race!”

At that time, Ye Yuan knew absolutely nothing about the divine race and did not detect Rong Xiyue’s abnormality.

Meeting again now, he recognized it with one look.

This time, it was Rong Xiyue’s turn to be surprised. She was first taken aback, and then she immediately smiled and said, “Sir actually knows about the divine race! Then Xiyue needs to re-introduce herself! Divine race’s Hidden Lineage’s Divine Daughter, Rong Xiyue, pays respect to Sir Ye.”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth twitched slightly. Yue Mengli being captured was to be this whatever Divine Daughter.

He did not expect that he would actually encounter another Divine Daughter.

A surge of killing intent immediately gushed out.

Rong Xiyue was rather surprised by Ye Yuan’s reaction. It was still alright previously, but upon mentioning ‘Divine Daughter’ two words, Ye Yuan’s expression immediately changed.

“Hidden Lineage! Looks like the divine race being suppressed in the Abyss World, your Hidden Lineage escaped a calamity!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

Rong Xiyue said in surprise, “Looks like sir knows a lot about the divine race’s secrets!”

Ye Yuan said in a cold voice, “Not just know, but this Ye even almost killed a Divine Son and the Profound Lineage’s ninth elder! Hope that you aren’t so unlucky to end up in my hands this time.”

Rong Xiyue opened her mouth wide, a look of shock as she said, “Profound Lineage’s ninth elder! Impossible! The nine elders are the strongest people in the race, with your strength, you can’t even survive one move under his hands at all!”

Rong Xiyue naturally knew what kind of figures the nine elders were. So in her view, Ye Yuan’s boasting was a little too big.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Is that so? Isn’t the two world’s passageway about to link up soon? You can find Nineorigin to confirm it, see if I’m bragging or not. Also, you all have an ancestor called Daymeld. An arm was cut off by me. I don’t know where he ran to now.”

Rong Xiyue’s face was full of shock. Those were all the divine race’s legendary class figures out of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

Especially Daymeld, that was a peak powerhouse of the previous epoch!

Absolutely not just anyone knew about these things.

Furthermore, with her understanding of Ye Yuan, it was impossible for her to talk through her hat.

Could it be that he really did it before?

This was too scary!

She drew a deep breath, her expression slightly awkward as she said, “Sir, please follow me.”

Ye Yuan followed Rong Xiyue into the city but discovered that the people in the city were few and far between.

Furthermore, the people here were all very strange, a murderous aura faintly loomed on each person.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, seemingly recalling something.

“These people ... are all from the Deathsoul Gate? The Deathsoul Gate ... is your divine race’s organization?” Ye Yuan suddenly paused his footsteps and asked.

Rong Xiyue raised her eyebrows and praised, “Really can’t hide anything from Sir Ye! That’s right. The Deathsoul Gate was single handedly established by our Hidden Lineage.”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “In that case, the ones who attacked Heavenly Eagle back then and wanted to bring me away, those were your people too?”

Rong Xiyue did not hide it and nodded her head and said, “That’s right. It was single handedly arranged by me.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ye Yuan’s fury loomed and he said in a cold voice, “Looks like this Ye’s grudges with the divine race are really quite a lot!”

Rong Xiyue smiled sweetly and said, “Sir Ye, rest assured. These grudges will be resolved very soon.”

Ye Yuan looked at her and said, “Looks like you’re very confident in being able to keep this Ye here!”

Rong Xiyue smiled and said, “In order to capture sir, Xiyue paid a considerable price! If this can’t keep Sir as well, Xiyue this Divine Daughter can’t carry on anymore.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then let’s wait and see.”

Ye Yuan followed Rong Xiyue and arrived at the City Lord Manor.

Upon entering the City Lord Manor, Ye Yuan detected that the nearby space was already thoroughly confined, unable to teleport at all.

It seemed like what Rong Xiyue said was right. She really schemed for a long time in order to deal with him.

Arriving in the hall, an old man slowly came up and bowed to Rong Xiyue and said, “Your Highness, Divine Daughter!”

Rong Xiyue nodded slightly and said, “Uncle Song, Sir Ye has already been invited, but what surprised this Divine Daughter is that he actually understands our divine race very well. This makes things a little difficult for me.”

Uncle Song was slightly surprised and said, “Since that’s the case, kill and be done with it.”

Rong Xiyue shook her head and said, “Sir Ye is someone who is born in response to the general trend of situation. He is bound to be part of that group of people who decides the Heavenspan World’s direction in the future. If such a person can be utilized by me, he shall be a great aid to our divine race trampling the Heavenspan World! Sir Ye, do you know why I had to invite you over?”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly and he said, “Why?”

Rong Xiyue heaved a sigh and said, “Actually, our mission is to take over the Extreme Nether Bodhidharma without a sound. But you rose too quickly, and you completely stirred up the waters of Extreme Nether Bodhidharma. Resulting to the current situation, the Southern Border became your world alone. The divine race’s plans in the Southern Border were all disrupted by you alone. However, this Divine Daughter admires you greatly.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “I want to see Ning Tianping!”

Rong Xiyue smiled and said, “Bluffed you, Ning Tianping isn’t here at all! You can’t see Ning Tianping. As long as you stay in Deathsoul Gate and do things for this Divine Daughter, he’ll be fine all the way. But, if you insist on opposing the divine race, then ... apologies.”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Is that so? Then I wonder, Your Highness Divine Daughter’s life and Ning Tianping’s life, which is more valuable?”

“Hehehe ... Sir Ye really loves to joke around. You seem to have forgotten, this place is my territory!” Rong Xiyue laughed until she shook with laughter. It was as if she heard a very hilarious joke.

“Immobilize!”

A cold cry came over, Rong Xiyue’s laughter abruptly stopped. Ye Yuan rushed toward Rong Xiyue like an arrow that left the bow.

But right at this time, Dao marks inside the hall glimmered, and they actually cracked Ye Yuan’s Heavenly Dao True Word in an instant!

Uncle Song’s figure flashed and directly clashed with Ye Yuan.

Behind him, Rong Xiyue kept giggling away and said, “Sir Ye underestimates Xiyue too much. Your Heavenly Dao True Word is famous throughout the Southern Border. So how can Xiyue not guard against it? Without the Heavenly Dao True Word, you’re like a tiger without teeth. I want to see how you’ll capture this Divine Daughter.”

But right at this time, there was a blue blur before Uncle Song’s eyes. It was only to see countless swords appear in front of him, filling the entire hall.

Uncle Song’s pupils constricted and he cried out in shock, “Sword formation! A sword formation formed with a thousand Empyrean spirit treasures!”
