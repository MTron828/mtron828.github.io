Chapter 1285: Array Amplifying Heavenly Dao!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Somebody triggered the Heavenly Dao, wanting to break through to the Deity Realm!” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

Skydistant and Fang Tian exchanged a glance when they heard that, both incredibly shocked.

“This ... How is this possible? In this world, apart from you, there’s actually still someone capable of breaking through to the Deity Realm?” Fang Tian said with a look of disbelief.

When it came to talent, he, Fang Tian, could be said to be the greatest in the Divine Realm!

Even he was unable to break through to Deity Realm, so how could someone possibly break through to the Deity Realm?

He conceded to Ye Yuan, but other people breaking through to Deity Realm, he was unconvinced.

“Yeah, you wouldn’t have been mistaken, right? To say that there’s still someone capable of breaking through to Deity Realm, I won’t believe even if you beat me to death!” Skydistant said.

Ye Yuan suddenly said, “I only said that somebody is breaking through to the Deity Realm; I didn’t say that he broke through to the Deity Realm. If barring no accidents, he’s probably going to fail.”

Only upon hearing Ye Yuan’s words did the two people’s expressions become a little better.

But they were very curious just who was breaking through to the Deity Realm.

Those with the qualifications to break through to the Deity Realm in the Divine Realm were just those few. There was no reason that they did not know.

“However ... his breakthrough method is really indulging in the wildest of fantasy! It’s too bad, too bad!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ye Yuan’s words involuntarily aroused the two people’s curiosity.

“Ye Yuan, just what in the world is happening? Are you trying to exasperate me to death?” Skydistant said anxiously.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly. His mind stirred, and he arrived at the summit of a tall mountain.

Three people stood in the air, looking at the raging storm in the distance.

When Skydistant and Fang Tian saw this scene, their faces revealed an astonished look at the same time.

Fang Tian’s gaze turned intent, and he exclaimed, “Grand Yan Divine King! This ... This is the aura of Heavenly Dao! He ... He actually used array formations to derive Heavenly Dao!”

This powerhouse that was currently breaking through to the Deity Realm was actually the Grand Yan Divine King, Lu Linfeng!

During the turmoil with the fiend race, he never showed himself all along. Fang Tian did not expect that he was actually preparing to break through to the Deity Realm!

Although he could not see his true body, Fang Tian was not foreign to Lu Linfeng’s aura and recognized it at a glance.

Skydistant was also unbelievably shocked and exclaimed, “He ... He’s actually going to create a Heavenly Dao that belongs to him! This guy is really a genius!”

In the distance, inside the array formation, a sacred aura surged to the sky. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

That array formation subverted their past understanding.

Within the scope of the array formation, there was a very unique atmosphere.

That atmosphere did not belong to the Immortal Grove Region, but it belonged to ... the Grand Yan Divine King himself!

The array formation’s area was akin to another world, appearing out of place with the surrounding environment.

Grand Yan Divine King Lu Linfeng, actually derived Heavenly Dao with Formation Dao, creating a Heavenly Dao that belonged to him.

This way of thinking could not be said to not be genius!

Furthermore, it seemed like he was already not far away from success!

It was precisely because so that Skydistant and Fang Tian would be so visibly moved.

However, Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Doing this, he’ll suffer the wrath of heaven!”

Skydistant duo trembled all over, looking toward Ye Yuan, uncertain what it meant.

If other people said these kinds of words, they would definitely turn their noses up and scoff.

But, in this Immortal Grove Region, no one had more authority to say this kind of words than Ye Yuan.

His words virtually represented the Heavenly Dao!

He said that he would suffer the wrath of heaven, then he would definitely suffer heaven’s condemnation!

Except, they did not understand. Why would such a shockingly brilliant idea suffer heaven’s condemnation?

“Old Fart Lu is indeed a rare genius! Even if his strength is slightly weaker than Zhuge Qingxuan and Brother Teng, he clearly has more ideas than them on Dao. It’s just a shame that Old Fart Lu is pulling up seedlings to help them grow here!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

“Pulling up seedlings to help them grow?” The two said with a puzzled look.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and explained, “Creating Heavenly Dao, that is something that only Divine Lord Realm can do. Old Fart Lu is only Half-Deity Realm, how can he be capable of creating a Heavenly Dao belonging to him? Furthermore, in the Immortal Grove Region, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s Heavenly Dao rejects all other Heavenly Daos. Him creating a Heavenly Dao that belongs to him, that is challenging the prestige of Heavenly Dao. How can Heavenly Dao not eradicate him? This idea seems genius, but actually, it’s no different from seeking death.”

Ye Yuan’s words made the two shudder with fear.

The two of them were Half-Deity Realm powerhouses. Moreover, their concepts were already comprehended to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm.

But regarding Heavenly Dao’s understanding, they could not even catch up to Ye Yuan by whipping their horses.

They only felt that Lu Linfeng’s aura was incomparably powerful, charging straight for Deity Realm.

But did not expect that there were actually still so many tricks involved.

As if affirming Ye Yuan’s words, an apocalyptic aura descended from the sky at this time.

Skydistant and Fang Tian’s countenance suddenly changed!

This aura was even stronger than what Ye Yuan exhibited!

At this time, they finally understood Ye Yuan’s words.

Heavenly Dao was enraged!

Lu Linfeng’s approach already thoroughly infuriated Heavenly Dao.

Heavenly Dao had no consciousness. It was just a kind of extremely mysterious rule. Everything was a primitive instinct.

The Immortal Grove Region’s Heavenly Dao was the rules that Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove set.

Now, someone was challenging the prestige of Heavenly Dao. It instinctively wanted to give it a catastrophic blow.

Hence, this terrifying heavenly tribulation descended from the sky.

A dark-yellow lightning bolt plummeted straight down from the clouds. This lightning bolt was like a towering tree that reached the heavens, incomparably thick.

The target was precisely the grand array that Lu Linfeng set up!

The commotion of Lu Linfeng’s breakthrough was indeed huge. But he already realized that his way of doing things would not work. The array formation already showed signs of instability.

This terrifying heavenly tribulation arriving at this time, his gaze revealed a look of despair.

Only at this time did he realize that he seemed to have angered Heavenly Dao.

The Heavenly Dao wanted to kill him and be done with it!

Just as that incomparably thick lightning bolt was about to fall on the array formation, a gentle power of Heavenly Dao overlapped on top of his array formation.

When that dark-yellow lightning bolt landed on it, it actually directly dissipated into nothingness.

The Lu Linfeng inside the array formation was incomparably shocked as he looked at this scene. He did not expect that this heavenly tribulation was actually all talk no action.

“Puhwark!”

It was not up to him to be shocked. The breakthrough failing caused him to suffer a tremendous backlash, fresh blood spurting wildly.

When everything evaporated away, only then, did Lu Linfeng saw clearly that there were three figures in the distance currently looking at him. This made him greatly surprised.

In order to ensure that his breakthrough was not interrupted, he set up many large formations around him. Even peak Void Mystic absolutely could not barge inside either.

But these three people actually entered effortlessly.

Furthermore, he actually did not detect it in the slightest.

If the three people touched the array formation, his breakthrough would have long failed.

The three silhouettes flashed and arrived in front of him in a blink of an eye.

Seeing the arrivals, Lu Linfeng’s gaze turned intent, and he said in surprise, “Ji Qingyun! Was ... Was it you who saved me?”

Lu Linfeng was not a fool. The might of that bolt of heavenly tribulation before could virtually destroy the heavens and decimate the heaven. But it started off with a large bang and ended with a whimper, finally dissipating into nothing. This was definitely someone making a move to assist.

Except, that kind of Heavenly Dao’s might, who had this ability to save him?

Lu Linfeng had always focused on closed-seclusion, making preparations for today’s breakthrough. Regarding the Divine Realm’s matters, he did not have the slightest clue.

Suddenly, his entire body trembled and his gaze revealed astoundment as he said, “You ... You broke through to the Deity Realm? This ... This is impossible! I must have seen it wrongly!”
