“Hahaha … ‘m cured! There isn’t any blood corruption poison in my body at all!”

“Leven thought that I was dead for sure. I didn’t expect that I actually didn’t die!”

“Great Commander Ye Yuan is mighty! Great Commander Ye Yuan is incredible!”

“Great Commander Ye Yuan rendered amazing merit. He’s really our Heaven One’s great hero!”

Following one blood corruption poison victim after another being cured, the entire Heaven One camp was boiling over with excitement.

Previously, even if the blood corruption poison was being suppressed, the camp had never been this crazy before too.

All of the Heaven One soldiers seemed to be having a carnival.

No one thought that the blood corruption poison could actually really be cured one day! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This was just like a terminal illness being completely cured.

That feeling of despair to a new lease on life was sufficient to make people excited until they went mad.

Hence, Ye Yuan’s prestige in the army reached the peak in an instant.

Those soldiers who were cured practically regarded Ye Yuan as a god.

The difficult hurdle that could not be overcome for thousands of years was overcome by Ye Yuan!

The terminal illness that no one had ever cured was cured by him!

Zhao Chen hugged Qiao Yiping and said agitatedly, “Good brother, we can fight side by side again in the future! This time, we have to join forces properly and kill until the blood race is trembling in their boots!”

Qiao Yiping nodded agitatedly and said, “Boss, rest assured. We’ve mustered up enough strength this time. We’ll definitely teach the blood race bastards an unforgettable lesson!”

“It’s all thanks to Great Commander Ye! Without him, there’s no need for us to fight this war anymore too,” Zhao Chen said.

“Great Commander Ye is truly divine! Something that the Extreme Medicine Sect didn’t accomplish for thousands of years, he did it! Remarkable! Truly remarkable!”

Mentioning Ye Yuan, Qiao Yiping and the brothers around him were all incomparably respectful.

This kind of respect came from the bottom of the heart.

One time, twice, thrice, four times!

Ye Yuan used one miracle after another and conquered everyone!

Using half a month’s time, Ye Yuan led Xiao Shan and the rest and completely cured over 4,000 soldiers in the army who were inflicted with blood corruption poison.

At this time, there was already less than a month left from the spatial passageway completely stabilizing.

Furthermore, the blood race was still continuously sending large forces through the spatial passageway.

Awar brooked no delay!

After experiencing the initial-most excitement, clouds of sorrow started shrouding the upper echelons.

“Can’t drag on anymore! The southern front has already sent news that the war is very tough, and the casualties extremely heavy! Just a while ago, Hegemon Windthunder was injured by the Hegemon Shie of the blood race, his injuries very severe. The southern front there transferred another ten

thousand people over. This is already the limit!” Dan Fei said in a solemn expression.

Hearing this, the expressions of the Emperor Realm powerhouses present changed one after another.

Even Hegemon level powerhouses were seriously injured. The tragic plight of the southern front war could be seen.

These ten thousand people were even squeezed out through the crevices between their teeth.

After all, once the northern front was lost, the Absolute Heaven Barrier would also lose its meaning of existence.

“During this period of time, the blood race had three more Emperor Realm powerhouses come over through the spatial passageway. The war this time will probably be even harder!” Zuo Chen similarly said with a worried look.

“No matter how difficult, we have to fight too! Even if our northern front army fights until the last soldier, we have to destroy the spatial passageway too! Otherwise, the consequences are unthinkable!” Dan Fei said decisively.

He understood that this fight would be even more miserable than that previous battle!

Because tin his fight, both sides had no way out anymore.

Especially the Heaven One Alliance.

Therefore, even if it was Dan Fei, this commander-in-chief, he was also prepared to die in battle.

Zuo Chen nodded his head and said, “Fight! Naturally have to fight. Nobody is afraid of dying. But right now, the most crucial problem is how can we destroy the spatial passageway? According to the last encounter, we can’t get close to the spatial passageway at all. This time, the hope is even more bleak.”

The moment these words came out, even Dan Fei fell silent too.

In the last great battle, 15 people fought ten of the blood race’s Emperor Realm powerhouses, but they still did not take the upper-hand.

Now, the other side added three more. It was naturally even more impossible.

They could not even come into contact with the spatial passageway, let alone talk about destroying it.

“Ming Yi, 50 thousand troops versus 30 thousand troops, how confident are you?” Dan Fei suddenly looked toward Ming Yi and asked.

He was the highest commander of the Saint Sovereign army and naturally had the qualifications to take part in this conference too.

Apart from him, there were also six great commanders, including Ye Yuan.

Although the Saint Sovereign army were cannon fodders, if the army’s side won, and the Emperor Realm powerhouses there held out, they could destroy the spatial passageway too.

Ming Yi’s expression was somewhat awkward as he said, “Honestly speaking, not even 30%! These 30 thousand troops are all elites among elites, their combat power extremely strong! Although we resolved the blood corruption poison, it’s still very difficult to kill them! This 30% confidence is still

because Ye Yuan killed Yuan Zheng three people and close to half of the chiliarchs. Otherwise, we don’t even have 10% confidence.”

As he said, he looked toward Ye Yuan, full of gratitude.

Ye Yuan killing Yuan Zheng three people and those chiliarchs was not just venting frustration so simple. It was also of great strategic importance.

These people’s combat power naturally went without saying. And they also played a sea-stabilizing needle effect in the Saint Sovereign Heaven army.

Ye Yuan killing them was equivalent to destroying the blood race’s war banner. It was of great significance!

The reason why the battle previously suffered heavy losses was because of the eruption of the blood corruption poison on the one hand.

On the other hand, it was because the blood race’s combat power was extremely strong!

In front of Ye Yuan and Yang Qing, these people were naturally too weak to stand up to competition.

But, to ordinary soldiers, the combat power of the blood race was strong.

And on the Heaven One Alliance’s side, the majority were transferred over temporarily. They were much worse in terms of combat power.

However, because of Ye Yuan, the entire army’s cohesiveness reached the peak currently.

Hearing Ming Yi’s words, Dan Fei’s expression became a little uglier.

Could it be that there was really no hope at all?

Everyone fell silent.

“Why don’t … I give it a try?” Suddenly, a voice broke the death-like silence.

‘When all the Emperor Realm powerhouses heard that, they looked over one after another.

The one speaking was precisely Ye Yuan.

“You? This kind of great battle, what function can you alone play?” Dan Fei shook his head and said.

He knew that Ye Yuan had extremely strong combat power, but a great battle of several tens of thousands of Saint Sovereign heavens, if they really fought, even a grand completion True Sovereign Heaven would be bombarded into residue too.

What use did a mere Ye Yuan have?

“Ye Yuan, Master knows that you have good intentions. However, miracles can’t happen over and over again. The great battle this time, you don’t take part in it! At present, only you can seize the blood race’s blood essence, and set it aside for use later. Saving more companions is the right thing to do.” Zuo

Chen said.

Ye Yuan was a treasure. He could not die.

At that time, once he got targeted by a True Sovereign Heaven, that would be very dangerous.

The refinement method of the Blood of Flame Crystal, as well as the new acupuncture technique, Ye Yuan had already imparted them to Xiao Shan and the rest.

But, without Ye Yuan, they were unable to suppress the blood race’s blood essence. They were naturally unable to refine the Blood of Flame Crystal.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m saying, I have a way to destroy the spatial passageway. But the prerequisite is that I can reach the spatial passageway there! Therefore, I need everyone to help me hold off the blood race’s powerhouses!”
