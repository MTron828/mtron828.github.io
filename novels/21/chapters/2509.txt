Chapter 2515: Tragic!

“I-It’s over!”

“Sigh!?Lord Saint Azure’s pride rises to the sky. How can he stand such humiliation?”

“Really unwilling! But, the opponent is too strong!”

… …

The Heavenspan World’s powerhouses were full of sorrow.

Weakness was the original sin!

At this time, they were so powerless!

Even the powerful Lord Saint Azure also ended up in such a plight.

And the smile on Jun Tian’s face was finally reined in.

He was unhappy.

Not angry, because ants were not worthy of him being angry.

But this did not mean that ants could scold him!

“Impervious to reason! I’ve already given you the chance. Since you don’t know how to cherish it, then pay the price for the destruction of the Eight Extreme Divinities!”

It was only to see his figure sway and suddenly appeared in front of Ye Yuan.

He was actually face-to-face with Ye Yuan already!

Ye Yuan’s world domain had always been open.

Jun Tian directly passed through his domain!

This was the first time!

Ye Yuan only felt that every pore opened up. He used teleport without the slightest hesitation.

Swoosh!

In an instant, he left Jun Tian’s range.

However, in the next second, Jun Tian appeared in front of him again.

It was still that distance, a look of indifference and disdain.

“A small chiliocosm’s spatial law? It’s really quite good! Unfortunately … it’s too weak!”

A faint smile hung on Jun Tian’s face, a finger already pressing on Ye Yuan’s chest.

Pffft!

A blood arrow spurted out of Ye Yuan’s back. His chest was pierced right through by a burst of energy!

His body flew towards the ground like a cannonball, smashing heavily into the ground.

The ever-victorious spatial teleport ceased to be effective too!

Ye Yuan’s teleport through his small world was actually unable to escape Jun Tian’s control too!

This Jun Tian was simply too strong!

Jun Tian slowly unleashed his palm. A powerful suction force transmitted over. Ye Yuan who was underground was actually directly sucked up.

It was only to see him shake his head slightly. He said with a sigh, “An ant also dares to fight for glory with heaven, you really don’t know life from death! Do you know that if I wanted you to die, you’d have already died ten times over?!”

“Ptooey!”

Ye Yuan used all of his strength and spat fiercely.

It was just that that mouthful of blood already turned into nothingness before touching Jun Tian.

Jun Tian’s gaze turned sullen. Another finger pointed at Ye Yuan’s knee.

Pffft!

Ye Yuan’s knee was directly crushed!

“Argh!”?Ye Yuan could not refrain from crying out miserably.

“An ant should have the awareness of an ant! Offending heaven, wanting to die … won’t be that easy too!”

As Jun Tian said indifferently, he gently pressed a palm on Ye Yuan’s chest.

Bang!

Ye Yuan spurted another mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his figure flying out backward.

That speed was even faster than many Deva powerhouses!

It could be seen how terrifying this light palm was.

Ye Yuan only felt that from top to bottom, there was no piece of flesh that belonged to him anymore.

Jun Tian grasped his sense of propriety very well, he did not give Ye Yuan a fatal blow. But the agony inflicted on Ye Yuan’s physical body was extremely intense.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

A palm, another palm.

Ye Yuan just felt that his skeleton was about to be dismantled by Jun Tian.

The whole place was deathly silent.

Everyone looked at this scene blankly, not knowing what to do.

Bang!

Another palm, Jun Tian flattened Ye Yuan on the ground.

He stood with his hands behind his back, looked at Ye Yuan indifferently, and said, “Speaking of which, being angry with an ant like you is beneath my dignity. It’s just that you destroyed the Eight Extreme Divinities beforehand, and you insulted afterward. I can’t tolerate you! However, I’ve grown tired of playing. You can go and die already! Before you die, I’ll let you see the true strength of a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse!”

Jun Tian flipped his palm over, an aura that made people shudder rose to the sky.

That … was the aura of Heavenly Dao!

Everyone’s countenance changed visibly.

Including Ye Yuan!

This aura was too strong! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This was the true Heavenly Dao!

Jun Tian flipping his palm was like flipping the sky over!

That power was practically going to break the Heavenspan World!

“This … is a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse? Could it be that the next realm is Heavenly Stratum? It’s just, how the hell can I break through?” A hint of helplessness flashed across in Ye Yuan’s heart.

Before coming, he already made the resolve to die.

It was just that he did not expect that he was actually unable to even touch the corners of Jun Tian’s sleeves.

Good-for-nothing!

Unwillingness!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

… …

All of a sudden, several figures sprang out, blocking in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, opening his hazy eyes, and his pupils constricted.

Yue Mengli, Pang Zhen, Fiery, Profound Secrets, Sacred Ancestor High Priest, Ni Xuan, and the six great Dao Ancestors, all came!

Apart from them, Tian Qing led Originsmile and Bo Yi three great Dao Ancestors as well as the other four great progenitors, and all appeared!

Nine great Dao Ancestors had all arrived!

“Y-You guys!” Ye Yuan’s breath was weak as he said.

Yue Mengli turned her head and said with a smile, “Sorry, Big Brother Yuan. Li-er can’t watch indifferently without lending a hand! What Elder Sister Lingxue can do, Li-er can do it too!”

Profound Secrets said with an indifferent look, “Ye Yuan, the Heavenspan World isn’t your Heavenspan World alone! What you said is right. We’ve been frogs at the bottom of a well for too many years, just like the human race back then, being afraid to even face the outside world! Today, we’ll face it together!”

At this time, the vacant look Tian Qing’s face had already been swept away fully.

He had his back facing Ye Yuan and said with some melancholy, “Ye Yuan, I’m the Heavenspan World’s sinner! Today, this ancestor is here to atone for my sins!”

Tian Qing’s back view was indescribably lonely.

Sometimes, the truth was this cruel.

For countless years, he had been nothing more than Jun Tian’s chess piece.

He was an executioner. How many Heavenspan World compatriots had he butchered?

Ever since recovering, he had fallen into deep self-reproach.

He knew that it was Ye Yuan who liberated them and let them return to themselves.

He was deeply grateful to Ye Yuan.

So, he came.

He was going to atone for the divine race!

Suddenly, Jun Tian put down his palm. That astonishing aura immediately disappeared without a trace.

“Huhu,?these … are all people around you, right? If they die in front of you one by one, you should be in agony, right?” Jun Tian looked at everyone behind Ye Yuan and said with a slight smile.

It was just that that smile exuded a cruel smell.

Yue Mengli’s brows furrowed slightly and she said in a solemn voice, “You’re really a cold-blooded and heartless person!”

But Jun Tian did not care at all, smiling as he said, “Ignorant ant! Don’t you know that Heavenly Dao is heartless?”

Tian Qing snorted coldly and said, “Attack together! How can our Heavenspan World’s Dao Ancestors have anyone who cravenly clings to life instead of braving death?”

Everyone nodded one after another, the nine great Dao Ancestors plus four great progenitors charged toward Jun Tian with astonishing imposing momentum.

It was just that Jun Tian still stood with his hands behind his back, moving back and forth indeterminately among the Dao Ancestors.

No matter how powerful their imposing momentum was, it could not touch the corners of Jun Tian’s sleeves.

“Huhu,?Dao Ancestor! How ridiculous! You guys are merely Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s toys, that’s all! Do you really take yourselves to be supreme existences? Ants are ants!”

As he spoke, Jun Tian stomped his feet.

Boom!

The group of powerhouses was directly sent flying. Each person suffered serious injuries.

Jun Tian’s haughtiness rose to the sky!

It was just that he did not notice that the light in Ye Yuan’s eyes became brighter and brighter!
