Chapter 1609 Believe in Yourself

Ye Yuan had first experienced the pain of losing his father. Later, he experienced the premature death of Mu Lingxue, so he was even more sensitive about the protection of those around him.

He absolutely did not allow the people around him to suffer any bit of harm.

Hence, when he returned to the Immortal Grove Region and encountered Heavenly Sin Heretic God, he dealt with the latter with that kind of nauseating method.

For so many years, he had always been doing his best to protect the people around him but had never thought about the feelings of those around him.

Seems like his way of doing things made Yue Mengli, White Light, and even Lu-er, all live in a stifling atmosphere.

Very clearly, regardless of Yue Mengli, White Light, or Lu-er, they were all people with extremely strong pride.

Putting Ye Yuan aside, they were all first-rate genius martial artists.

Even when placed in the Heavenspan World, their talents were still stronger than the vast majority of martial artists.

But Ye Yuan’s way of doing things stifled their talent.

It seemed like this period of time in his absence, it finally made the pride of the people around him being challenged to the limit.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Li-er, White Light, sorry. Looks like I’ve neglected your feelings.”

White Light blurted, “Big Brother, what are you saying! The things that you do for us, we can all understand. Furthermore, you indeed have that capability too! But we likewise also know how much you endured these few years! Us wanting to become strong isn’t only not wanting to become your burden, but to be able to let you advance forward without scruples!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yue Mengli also said, “Big Brother Yuan, I ... I just want to offer a bit of my meager strength for Elder Sister Lingxue.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Alright, I got it. Every person has their own path. These few years, it was indeed me who was too nervous, wiping out your talent instead. You guys go then, but ... let’s set an agreement of 500 years! 500 years later, no matter where we are, we have to return to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!”

The moment everyone heard, they could not help being overjoyed. There was naturally no reason to refuse.

Ye Yuan understood these few people too well. Since they decided to come to find him, that meant that they already made a decision.

Disregarding White Light, Li-er seemed to have a gentle temperament, but actually, she had her strong side too.

Otherwise, she also would not directly escape to the lower realms back then and meet Ye Yuan.

Among the few people, the one Ye Yuan was most worried about was naturally Lu-er.

Lu-er’s thoughts were simple and had not experienced worldly affairs. In the complicated and disorderly world of martial artists, it was hard to guarantee that she would not suffer a loss.

For this, Ye Yuan handed Gui Yun to Lu-er, and had him protect Lu-er’s safety along the way.

Apart from this, Ye Yuan gave each of them several divine lord mystic treasures.

With divine lord mystic treasures, they could jump realms and battle, their ability to survive naturally increased greatly.

On the day they left, Ye Yuan did not go and send them off.

Although you escort a person a thousand miles, there was bound to be a parting at last.

Weal and woe were hard to predict with this trip, Ye Yuan really did not have the courage to face it.

Hiding in the Ye Manor, Ye Yuan was depressed by himself.

“Senior, I’m still not strong enough!” Ye Yuan gave a long sigh and said to Dustless.

Dustless was silent for a moment and opened his mouth and said, “You’ve already done very well! Life is like the moon, waning and waxing. People have sorrow and parting. Dao Ancestors seem to stand at the summit of the world, but the life and death partings they experienced, how many are able to understand it? In the end, Deity Realm powerhouses are not true deities!”

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “I understand all the logic, but when it really comes to this day, I still can’t let it go. I have to become strong as soon as possible, powerful until Li-er they all don’t need to worry about me, powerful until nobody dares to roll their eyes at them again!”

Dustless consoled him and said, “I’ve never doubted that before!”

...

Li-er and the rest departing stirred up even stronger determination in Ye Yuan instead.

From then on, he threw himself into even more frenzied cultivation.

These few days, Ye Yuan had been constantly hiding inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space, wanting to comprehend the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s fourth level cultivation method.

But reality did not accord with hopes, he comprehended for more than ten years inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space and could not find the slightest clue either.

Origin Deity Realm to Divine Lord Realm was a massive threshold to all martial artists.

A heaven’s darling like Ning Tianping was after all just a minority existence.

No idea how many martial artists were blocked outside the door of Divine Lord Realm all their lives.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation encountered a huge bottleneck for the first time.

“Senior, why do I feel that there’s an extremely contradictory feeling? All of the Divine Lord Realm powerhouses open up the inner-world, achieving the position of a sovereign. That’s how one corroborates their Dao as a Divine Lord Realm. But why is it that according to my deductions in these ten over years, this path wouldn’t work at all? Just where did I go wrong? Could it be that ... I was wrong right from the start?”

Not progressing for a long time, Ye Yuan was abnormally irritable in his heart and had to get some words out of his system.

Over the past ten years, Ye Yuan had done countless deductions in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, wanting to find the method to open up an inner-world.

However, no matter how he deduced, there was only one outcome: this path was closed!

Corroborating one’s Dao as a Divine Lord, opening an inner-world, and becoming the sovereign of a world, this was the path that must be taken for all Heavenspan World powerhouses.

But Ye Yuan did not know why, continuing according to the first three levels in his cultivation method, this path was actually completely wrong.

He had attempted to forcefully break through before as well, but without exception, it all failed.

For the first time in his life, Ye Yuan doubted his own path.

Ye Yuan’s situation, Dustless naturally took it into his sights.

But honestly speaking, he did not have the faintest idea too. Dustless could only sigh and said, “Right from the start, I told you that this path is extremely arduous. It’s a path that no one has ever walked before. Without a doubt, the first three levels in your cultivation method are extremely strong! This old man has followed Immortal Grove and roamed unobstructed for millions of years in the Heavenspan World, and has never seen before such a powerful cultivation method! But this cultivation method has clearly reached a watershed now. If you cross over, it will be a smooth road ahead. If you don’t step over it ... you can only stop using this cultivation method and re-cultivate anew!”

Ye Yuan’s expression flickered incessantly. This result was clearly not what he wanted.

He was very clear, with his talent, even if abolishing the Chaos Heavenspan Canon and cultivating Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s cultivation method anew, he could also cultivate to an extremely high boundary.

But this also signified that he might never be able to save Mu Lingxue in this life anymore.

This result was not what he wanted.

If he could not save Mu Lingxue, then what was the point of his many years of struggle?

Even if he could become a transcendent heavenly emperor in the future and laugh proudly across the entire Heavenspan World, what was the use?

If you are not around, why do I want this world for?!

Now, it reached the biggest fork in the road in Ye Yuan’s life.

Dustless gave Ye Yuan a glance and said, “Ye Yuan, actually, rationally speaking, I feel that you should abandon this path! This path’s uncertainty is too great!”

Ye Yuan gave Dustless a glance and quietly waited for him to continue.

He knew that this was not the meaning that Dustless really wanted to express.

Sure enough, Dustless paused for a bit and said with a bitter smile, “This old man, as an artifact spirit, has lived to this ripe old age, and has never been crazy before. But this time, I’ll gift you a sentence: believe in yourself!”
