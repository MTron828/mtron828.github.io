Chapter 1406 Ownership of the Four-star Divine Pill

On the altar plaza, one figure after another was being transported back,

During previous trials, the later it was, the fewer people sent back.

But this time, there were still people being transported non-stop.

“You still ran into that malefic star in the end?”

“Isn’t that so! No idea what method that guy used either, I clearly already hid very covertly, but was still found by him!”

“Me too! This malefic star is too vengeful. I was very far away from him at that time. There was no chance to make a move at all and he still didn’t let me go.”

“You don’t know it. Later on, as long as everybody sees him, they directly crush the jade pendant. This malefic star kills on sight, completely unreasonable.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

An outer-court disciple was just transported back, so he started chatting with his fellow disciples who were finished off by Ye Yuan previously.

Upon mentioning Ye Yuan, each and every one of their faces all revealed an extremely depressed look.

In the entire plaza, several thousand students taking part in the trial were virtually all talking about Ye Yuan.

The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time, Ye Yuan alone shone in the limelight.

Virtually everyone lived in his shadow.

At this time, a virtual image descended from the sky. It was precisely Xuan Ling!

Xuan Ling’s gaze swept slightly and said nonchalantly, “The hour has arrived! Everyone return!”

Finished talking, he flicked his sleeves grandly. All of the altars flickered with light, summoning all of the remaining people back.

Ye Yuan just felt a blur before his eyes and returned back on the altar once again.

“How is it, Ye Yuan? You wouldn’t ... really have finished off everybody, right?” Little Fatty asked curiously.

When Ye Yuan challenged everyone, he settled Little Fatty down in a concealed place.

He knew that the Qin Family would definitely target him. If he brought Little Fatty by his side, it would definitely be very dangerous.

Now, the trial ended. Little Fatty came back together with Ye Yuan and did not know what happened in the outside world.

“Junior Apprentice Brother Xie, your relationship is the closest with Junior Apprentice Brother Ye. You actually don’t know his earth-shaking record?” A Wu Meng’s inner-court student poked fun at him.

Little Fatty looked at Ye Yuan in surprise and said, “Y-Y-You ... really did it?”

That inner-court student laughed and said, “More than just did it! Ye Yuan challenged the entire Zuo Xiang Capital City’s outer-court 15 people with his sword alone, completely annihilating the other party! Then, under the circumstances where he did not rest, he defeated the hundred cities’ number one person, Jin Yu! Following which, under the circumstances where he was seriously injured, he killed until everybody threw away their helmets and armor, running wildly all over the place!”

When he spoke, he intentionally raised his voice.

Next to them were Zuo Xiang Capital City’s students. Hearing these words, each and every one of them was depressed until they wanted to vomit blood.

When Wu Meng Capital City’s students heard this, they all guffawed with laughter.

This time, they really walked with their heads held high!

The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial took place once every 300 years. Every time, Wu Meng Capital City was targeted by Zuo Xiang Capital City, losing very tragically.

But this time, Ye Yuan alone won back some ground, directly shaving them bald. How could this not make them feel great?

But at this time, Little Fatty jumped up all at once, pointed at Ye Yuan, and said angrily, “You are really too treacherous! I said that I wanted to go together with you, but you just refused! Such a spectacular sight, Lord Fatty, I, actually missed it! Sniff, sniff ...”

Little Fatty had an aggrieved look. Clearly, he was regretting missing such a grand occasion immensely.

“If you went, you might already be a corpse!”

Lin Xiu’s voice suddenly sounded out behind Little Fatty, making him jump in fright.

“Xiu ... Senior Apprentice Sister, where ... did this come from?” Little Fatty said puzzledly.

Lin Xiu let out a sigh and briefly recounted the incident of Qin Yuanlong sneak attacking Ye Yuan.

“Pooh! The Qin Family’s people are indeed all still so shameless! To actually do such a shameless thing! Doing this sort of thing in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, they have utterly lost their face! Everyone says not to wash your dirty linen in public, but they are good, directly making it known throughout a hundred capital cities!” After Little Fatty finished listening, he spat indignantly.

Ye Yuan did not turn back and he was able to feel that there were several murderous gazes at the back.

Little Fatty clearly saw it too. Eyes glaring, he said disdainfully, “What? Did this kind of thing that will leave a stink for a thousand years and still don’t let people say? If you have the capability, come and bite me!”

Qin Tian’s gaze sharpened and he said in a cold voice, “Damn fatty, I’ve remembered you!”

“Yoo, threatening Lord Fatty? Did Lord Fatty grow up being frightened?” Xie Jingyi said without showing weakness in the slightest.

By the side, Lin Xiu’s brows furrowed but did not say anything.

“Qin Tian, you shut your mouth for me! This matter won’t end because of Qin Yuanlong’s death. Your Qin Family must give the academy an account!” by the side, Thundercry said in a solemn voice.

After that day, Thundercry pursued Qin Yuanlong for two months, finally executing him under his palm.

Although Qin Yuanlong shouldered all of the blame that day, even an idiot knew that this matter could not get away from the Qin Family.

Qin Tian’s face fell and he controlled his temper and said, “Teacher Thundercry, since Qin Yuanlong has already turned his back on the Qin Family, what he did has nothing to do with my Qin Family! Isn’t it rather biased for you to do so?!”

Thundercry smiled coldly and said, “Heh, how this matter will be ruled, that’s City Lord, His Excellency’s business! But the events here, I’ll report them truthfully!”

Qin Tian could not help choking up when he heard that and could only stop speaking.

Clearly, Qin Yuanlong’s actions already thoroughly infuriated this teacher.

At this time, Xuan Ling’s voice sounded out once more, saying slowly: “Alright, the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time ends here. Now, I’ll examine your storage rings and distribute the rewards for this trial.”

While talking, Xuan Ling’s gaze actually looked over at Ye Yuan’s side; no one knew if it was consciously or unconsciously.

Not seeing him take any action either, all of the storage rings broke free of the students’ body on their own, flying in front of Xuan Ling.

With just a glance, Xuan Ling finished checking all of the storage rings and called out: “Inner-court disciples’ first place, Yong Dang Capital City’s Bi Tianzhou, obtained a total of 621 stalks of Tier 2 spirit medicines!”

“It’s indeed Bi Tianzhou! Yong Dang Capital City is too strong. The inner-court has Bi Tianzhou, outer-court has Jin Yu. These two people are simply unsurpassable existences!”

“Heh, that’s in the past! Didn’t Ye Yuan emerge this time? Jin Yu has already lost to him.”

“No idea how many Tier 1 spirit medicines Ye Yuan obtained in the end. Five stalks of Tier 1 spirit medicines can offset one stalk of Tier 2 spirit medicines. Wonder who the Four-star divine pill this time will end up with!”

“Should be Yong Dang Capital City still, right? No matter how formidable Ye Yuan is, it’s also just one person. Yong Dang Capital City has more people than just Bi Tianzhou! Even though Jin Yu was defeated, the inner-court disciples’ total amount of Tier 2 spirit medicines is also quite a lot.”

...

After Xuan Ling announced Bi Tianzhou’s results, it immediately aroused a wave of speculation.

Actually, the inner-court’s first place and outer-court’s first place did not have any suspense. The only suspense was the ownership of this Four-star divine pill!

In terms of value, five stalks of Tier 1 spirit medicines naturally could not compare to one stalk of Tier 2 spirit medicine.

But in this smelting trial, the difficulty in obtaining Tier 1 spirit medicines was not too different from Tier 2 spirit medicines.

5-to-1, this ratio was what everyone could still accept.

At this time, Xuan Ling continued, saying, “Yong Dang Capital City obtained 2126 stalks of Tier 2 spirit medicines in the end! 1000 stalks of Tier 1 spirit medicines!”
