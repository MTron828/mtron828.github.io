Chapter 1722 This Was a Difficult Problem!

“What did Jiang Nan say? Admit defeat?”

“Is there a mistake? A favorite to win the championship, he actually conceded ...”

“This ... actually withdrew without a fight, this guy is so timid!”

...

Everyone originally thought that they could see an exciting showdown. Who knew that Jiang Nan directly admitted defeat the moment he came up. This made everyone’s jaws drop.

Everyone thought that this final eight showdown would startle heaven and earth and make gods and ghosts weep.

Who knew that the first round, Ning Tianping directly forfeited. In the second round, Jiang Nan directly admitted defeat.

Could it be funnier or not?

If it were others, forget it. But Jiang Nan was a favorite to win the championship.

Although Xiahou Yun was very strong, no one felt that Jiang Nan was worse than him. He was even a notch stronger.

Now, he actually directly admitted defeat without even fighting.

“You could kill Xiahou Yun, but I can’t do it. So ... there’s nothing to fight about. You’re stronger than me. Things that waste strength, better not do it.” Jiang Nan waved his hand dismissively and went straight down the ring.

Ye Yuan was stunned too, not expecting that this guy was actually so shameless.

Reaching his level, even if he clearly knew that there was no hope, he would always struggle.

But this guy did not seem to have any interest in anything.

But being able to win without fighting, Ye Yuan naturally had nothing to complain about.

On the other side, Mo Fei also defeated his opponent neatly and tidily.

This way, the final showdown was between Ye Yuan and Mo Fei.

During the break, Mo Fei went to find Jiang Nan and said with an unhappy look, “Do you still want face or not? To actually directly admit defeat!”

Jiang Nan said with a nonchalant look, “Clearly know that can’t beat, still waste that strength for what? What if he cleaves me into two with one sword? That death state is too disgusting, I don’t wish to become like Xiahou Yun.”

Mo Fei’s expression could not help changing when he heard that. Recalling Xiahou Yun’s death state, a chill immediately welled up in his heart.

Jiang Nan said it lightly, actually, he was the same as him, scared!

If they really exchanged blows, life and death were hard to say.

Just how strong Ye Yuan was, they did not see it with their own eyes. No one could say for sure.

Moreover, if Ye Yuan was a bloodthirsty person, then the consequence ... could only be being split in half.

Thinking up to here, Mo Fei’s face fell and he said angrily, “Jiang Nan, you despicable villain!”

Jiang Nan shrugged his shoulders and said with a lazy look, “Don’t you malign a good person, I only don’t want to make a fearless sacrifice.”

Mo Fei was angered until his expression turned livid and he said, “Don’t you want to see how he killed Xiahou Yun?”

Jiang Nan smiled lazily and said, “Of course I want, but I don’t want to use my life to go and see!”

Mo Fei gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “So, you intentionally conceded to let me go and test his depths?”

Jiang Nan smiled and said, “You can decide not to test him. I am not forcing you.”

“You!” Mo Fei gnashed his teeth in hatred but was helpless about it.

This guy’s curiosity was absolutely not less than his.

Reaching their realm, it was already very hard to encounter a match in the same rank.

But now, an incredible Third Firmament Divine Lord suddenly popped out, jumping three minor realms to kill Xiahou Yun. How could they not be curious?

But curiosity kills the cat!

Sometimes, wanting to satisfy one’s curiosity had to pay with one’s life as the price!

Very unfortunately, Jiang Nan ran into Ye Yuan first, then he admitted defeat very shamelessly.

He looked at Ye Yuan on the stage for a long time and finally said those three words. It could be seen that he had also experienced a struggle in his heart.

In the end, this massive difficult problem was thrown to him.

Then, was he admitting defeat or not?

This was a difficult problem!

It was also precisely because so that Mo Fei would curse Jiang Nan for being despicable.

Mo Fei immediately felt a headache come on. He really wanted to see just what Ye Yuan relied on to kill Xiahou Yun.

However, if his outcome was the same as Xiahou Yun, then it would be really fun.

“The final showdown begins, Ye Yuan versus Mo Fei!”

Right at this time, the judge’s voice sounded out, making Mo Fei’s heart tighten.

Ye Yuan slowly walked up the stage. Mo Fei’s expression changed again and again, but he did not move his feet.

Jiang Nan saw him not moving and reminded him nonchalantly, “Hey, your turn.”

Mo Fei was currently struggling fiercely in his heart, his feet seemed to have taken root.

At this time, everyone’s gazes were focused on Mo Fei.

Under the watchful gazes of the people, Mo Fei moved his feet. It just appeared rather heavy.

Arriving on the ring and meeting eyes with Ye Yuan, Mo Fei felt like he was dreaming.

Because taking part in the Hundred Battles Arena, he never thought that his last opponent was actually this young man in front of him.

He had thought before that his opponent would be Xiahou Yun or Jiang Nan. He even thought of the possibility of facing some very formidable Fifth Firmament Divine Lords.. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

But a Third Firmament Divine Lord, he would not even think about it.

The pressure that this Third Firmament Divine Lord in front of him brought to him was too great.

Test the sword with his life or not?

“What’s with Mo Fei? He wasn’t like this before!”

“Isn’t that so? His aura that showed disdain on all under the heavens when on the ring, who can block it? What’s going on now?”

“He wouldn’t be the same as Jiang Nan, also directly admitting defeat, right?”

...

On the grandstands, there were still many people who did not know the truth.

Even in the match before this, Mo Fei still had the air of an expert, cold and fierce.

But now, his temperament changed drastically, making quite a few people feel extremely puzzled.

Ye Yuan looked at Mo Fei and also had a blank expression.

Did fighting with him have so much pressure?

Can beat, then fight. Can’t beat, then admit defeat, what’s the big deal!

Ye Yuan completely did not know how great the psychological impact of him killing Xiahou Yun with one sword had on these two.

Under normal circumstances, Ye Yuan would not kill so viciously either.

But he had no grudge nor enmity with Xiahou Yun and the other party actually wanted to kill him in the ring, this was intolerable.

Actually, killing Xiahou Yun, it was not easy for Ye Yuan at all too.

His ease was only in the eyes of outsiders.

Right at this moment, Mo Fei seemingly made a huge resolve. Sucking in a deep breath, he stared intently at Ye Yuan and said, “Ye Yuan, I wish to witness that move you killed Xiahou Yun with!”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, immediately understanding something, and said with a nod, “Okay!”

Below the stage, when Jiang Nan heard Mo Fei’s words, the corners of his mouth revealed a hint of a smile like his wicked scheme succeeded.

In the ring, Mo Fei was akin to facing a great adversary, waiting in full battle-array.

Ye Yuan slowly drew the Junyi Sword. The aura on his body suddenly changed, becoming fleeting and ephemeral.

Just like last time, Ye Yuan’s sword vanished!

When Mo Fei and Jiang Nan saw this sword, their expressions immediately changed drastically.

“Sword Dao law fused with spatial law!” Jiang Nan’s expression changed greatly as he said.

Supreme laws, wanting to fuse them was as hard as ascending to heaven.

At this moment, they finally understood why Xiahou Yun would be killed.

This sword move, who could block?

A feeling of immense danger welled up in his heart, Mo Fei opened his mouth and was about to throw in the towel.

However, it was already too late.

At this moment, Ye Yuan already moved.

Mo Fei’s words were directly stuck in his throat.

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure disappeared!
