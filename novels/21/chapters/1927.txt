Chapter 1931: Fangs

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Currently, Ye Yuan and Yu Ying two people directly treated Wang Jian as air.

Ye Yuan did not cause trouble, but he was not afraid of trouble either.

Since people bullied him to the doorstep, he naturally had no reason to shrink back.

“Heh, looking down on even blackscale, truly outrageously arrogant! I’ll let you take a look today at how strong blackscale is!” Yu Ying said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Is that so? Then I’ll have to take a good look.”

Below the stage, when Jiang Yuan master and servant were looking at this scene, they sneered coldly without ceasing.

How strong Yu Ying was, they were very clear.

Even level eight difficulty rank five divine pills, he had also once refined divine-grade before.

Although Ye Yuan’s strength was great, reaching blackscale this level, he definitely reached the limit already.

“Heh, indeed a condescending fellow, this kind of people isn’t worthy of remaining in the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion at all!” Jiang Yuan said with a cold smile.

After Jiang Hua was beaten, he found Yu Ying and requested him to take action to teach Ye Yuan a lesson.

Yu Ying was very devout to the Springwind Hall. Jiang Yuan also looked after him very well, the two people’s relationship was very friendly.

Jiang Yuan said those groundless words for Yu Ying to hear. He was naturally greatly enraged and immediately came over to find trouble with Ye Yuan.

Now, Yu Ying goaded out Ye Yuan’s arrogance. When it landed in Jiang Yuan’s ears, he believed Jiang Hua’s words even more.

Seeing Ye Yuan accept the bet, Jiang Hua was delighted to the extreme in his heart.

“Family Head, aren’t I right? This punk thinks nothing of anyone, let alone me, a mere steward.” Jiang Hua said with an aggrieved look.

Jiang Yuan nodded and said, “Climbing on top of our heads, he’ll have to bear the consequences! I’ve already arranged for people to wait for him outside the city. As long as he leaves the city, he’ll definitely die without a doubt!”

As Springwind Hall’s elder, Jiang Yuan was naturally not some softhearted and benevolent person.

Ye Yuan hitting his steward was equivalent to hitting his face, how could he endure it?

Moreover, Ye Yuan even insulted Springwind Hall along with him.

Jiang Hua was overjoyed when he heard it. Clearly, he did not expect that Family Head actually handled things without missing a single detail.

“Many thanks, Family Head, for venting this frustration for me!” Jiang Hua said excitedly.

On the stage, the two people were already good to go. A great battle was on the verge of breaking out.

Before this, there had never been darkviolet alchemists who challenged blackscale alchemists.

The disparity between the two was too great, there was no possibility of challenging at all.

But today, Ye Yuan, this darkviolet, actually challenged a blackscale.

Furthermore, Yu Ying was an extremely powerful existence among blackscale alchemists.

“Brat, open your eyes wide and take a look at what’s called a true Alchemy Dao powerhouse! You are still early! Today, I’ll have you scram out of the great imperial capital!” Yu Ying said with a cold smile.

Actually, before this, everyone’s estimation of Ye Yuan’s strength was blackscale.

It was just that the strength difference of blackscale level alchemy powerhouses was tremendous too.

The powerful existences among them entered Dao Realm many years ago and were not what ordinary people could imagine.

To alchemy gods, Dao Realm was a watershed, another universe.

It was just that Yu Ying did not know that Ye Yuan was already at the grand completion Dao Realm.

“Alright, enough rubbish, if bragging can refine pills, anyone can be an alchemist in this Heavenspan World,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Yu Ying’s face was black as he said in a solemn voice, “What a razor-tongued brat. During the alchemy battle, you have to be careful!”

Yu Ying’s vast soul force suddenly erupted, giving people a hair-raising feeling.

Entering a pill refining state, Yu Ying’s entire person still failed to show restraint, giving people an overbearing feeling.

Very soon, a profound and inscrutable aura gradually rose around the medicinal cauldron.

Bang!

Yu Ying’s aura became more and more powerful, like a fierce tiger, rushing towards Ye Yuan’s territory; incomparably domineering.

In the view of outsiders, Yu Ying wanted to forcibly occupy the entire ring, not giving Ye Yuan any leeway to survive.

The Dao Realm Yu Ying, his imposing momentum was naturally greatly different from the opponents that Ye Yuan encountered.

His impact force was more than a thousand times stronger than others.

Under Yu Ying’s powerful aura, Ye Yuan appeared to be in a precarious situation.

“Indeed, it’s still too early for Ye Yuan to deal with blackscale alchemists!”

“This is the strength of blackscale level pinnacle powerhouses? Indeed ridiculously strong! Looks like Ye Yuan encountered his match this time.”

...

Seeing Ye Yuan’s situation, people all sighed emotionally one after another.

“Brat, don’t you look down on blackscale? This is the true strength of blackscale! I want to see how you refine pills still!” Outside of the pill refinement, Yu Ying still had leftover strength to talk with Ye Yuan.

Under the interference of his powerful aura, ordinary people could not maintain their state of mind at all.

Pill refinement did not allow the slightest error.

Once interrupted, it was very easy to affect the outcome of the pill refinement.

Yu Ying’s aura was like tidewater, scouring Ye Yuan’s aura wave after wave; incomparably domineering.

This kind of alchemy battle was the clash of two people’s Dao.

But at this time, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes and said coolly, “Just this bit of strength? Really disappoints me!”

Yu Ying gave a cold laugh and was just about to refute when suddenly, his expression changed.

Ye Yuan’s aura suddenly changed, an imposing momentum that was vast like the sea instantly pushed back. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Originally, on this ring, it teemed with Yu Ying’s aura everywhere.

But in a blink of an eye, it was retaliated by Ye Yuan.

Yu Ying’s expression suddenly changed. How could he still care to speak? He used all of his methods, wanting to stop the retreat.

But all of his actions were futile.

Ye Yuan’s Chaos Heavenly Star Art went at full power, advancing irresistibly, crushing Yu Ying like sweeping away dead leaves.

However, Yu Ying was a Dao Realm powerhouse in the end. Finally, at the last moment, he blocked Ye Yuan’s assault.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces changed.

At this moment, Ye Yuan was akin to a god. That mysterious aura around him made people tremble.

“This ... What’s going on here? Why did Ye Yuan suddenly become so strong?”

“Too inconceivable! Turns out ... Turns out that he concealed his strength all along!”

“Concealed strength my ass! It’s just that we were totally not qualified enough to make him use his full power!”

...

Everyone was extremely shocked. The scene before their eyes was seriously too out of their expectations.

All along, Ye Yuan’s alchemy battles appeared very cordial. He had never taken the initiative to attack others before.

Being low-profile for a long time, everyone thought that his strength merely stopped here.

But today, Yu Ying was overbearing, finally triggering Ye Yuan’s fury, making him bare his ferocious fangs.

He went all out!

The Ye Yuan who spared no effort was actually terrifyingly powerful!

The current Yu Ying was deathly pale, hands and feet all in confusion. He was already thrown into confusion.

Under Ye Yuan’s dominance, his aura was suppressed to within a radius of ten feet, unable to break through anymore.

“Not bad, at least you have some skill. It’s just that you’re too weak!”

Ye Yuan slowly opened his mouth, another wave of fierce attack lashed over.

“Puhwark!”

Yu Ying could not withstand it anymore, a mouthful of fresh blood spewed out.

His furnace of medicinal pills also thoroughly became useless pills.

Yu Ying looked at Ye Yuan, incomparably shocked.

Lost?

He was actually defeated!

He, a dignified middle-rank Six-star Alchemy God, an apex existence among blackscale alchemists, actually lost to a Five-star Alchemy God?

Yu Ying felt like he was dreaming.
