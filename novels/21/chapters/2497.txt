Chapter 2503: Reaping What You Sow!

“Oh??Is that so?”

Facing Lin Chaotian’s threat, Ye Yuan was completely indifferent but moved closer forward instead.

Lin Chaotian had a look of fear and repeatedly fell back as he said, “You … Don’t you come over! Walk over again and this ancestor will really crush it!”

Ye Yuan was completely unmoved, continuing to close in.

“Lin Chaotian, you’ve also borrowed the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain away for very long already. It’s time to return to the original owner! Also, this Tear of Life, this Ye will accept it too!” Ye Yuan had an indifferent look as if he was not afraid of the Tear of Life being crushed at all.

Lin Chaotian fell back repeatedly, he was really frightened badly by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s various bizarre divine abilities made him not even have the possibility of running away.

However, Lin Chaotian was a ruthless person too.

Under Ye Yuan’s coercion, Lin Chaotian suddenly laughed loudly and said, “Is that so? Then if you have the ability, try taking the Tear of Life away from this ancestor’s hand!”

Finished talking, Lin Chaotian gritted his teeth and exerted force with his hand, going to crush the Tear of Life.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan spat a word out of his voice very calmly.

“Immobilize!”

Lin Chaotian’s body suddenly froze there.

He desperately used strength and even used the two great rules.

But it was as if everything stopped!

His power of rule could not be transmitted to his hands at all.

All of his strength seemed to be restrained.

“Heavenly Dao True Word! He … His time law also reached the realm of rule?” Tian Qing had an inert look, feeling like all of his understanding was being subverted.

Within a month, Ye Yuan broke through these two great supreme laws to the realm of rule?

He was speechless!

In his view, Yue Mengli should be a rare talent whose accomplishments surpassed ancient and modern times.

But Yue Mengli was nothing in front of Ye Yuan at all!

Concerning Time Freeze, this move, Ye Yuan already had not used it for a long time.

It was not that he did not want to use it, but that his opponents were too strong. This move already could not have much effect anymore.

Although innate divine abilities were powerful, they also depended on who the opponent was.

With Ye Yuan’s previous strength, going to immobilize a Dao Ancestor was equivalent to setting fire to himself.

Under the power of rule, not only would he fail, it would even backlash back to him.

But now, it was different!

His spacetime law had similarly reached the realm of rule.

His fleshy body realm also reached the limit of rank nine!

Under such circumstances, unless the Dao Ancestor surpassed him.

Otherwise, they would not be able to shake off his Heavenly Dao True Word too!

At least, Lin Chaotian could not do it!

Whoosh!

A streak of sword light flashed past, Lin Chaotian’s arm was severed at the wrist.

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned, and the Tear of Life flew over.

Getting the Tear of Life, Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, “I tried and seem … to have succeeded!”

Lin Chaotian’s eyes went from shock to astonishment, then to horror.

Spacetime law!

Time, space, sword, three great laws, stepped into the realm of rule at the same time!

He finally understood why Ye Yuan was so calm and composed.

Because ha already completely surpassed the Grand Ancestor Spacetime Shang Hang back then!

He was Saint Azure!

He was the number one person throughout the ages!

He was the true human race’s sovereign!

Humanity’s sovereign had never been flaunted by oneself, but proved using strength!

All of the powerhouses present fell into deep shock.

Ye Yuan used his strength to astound three eras!

At the start of this epoch, he sent a supreme Dao Ancestor who had just reached the peak into the dust!

“I didn’t expect that this Heavenly Dao Samsara actually had such an outcome!”

“Lord Saint Azure is now really the number one person throughout the ages!”

“Thinking about it now, Lin Chaotian’s domineeringness previously was really laughable to the extreme!”

… …

Everyone shook their heads one after another. Lin Chaotian used strength to terrorize everyone. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Not long ago, he was still so insufferably arrogant and unparalleledly tyrannical.

He felt that Ye Yuan was utterly not worth mentioning in front of him.

Saint Azure was about to become history.

But now, reality slapped his face brutally.

He was nothing in front of Ye Yuan!

Only then did they understand why Ye Yuan disdained to refine the rule crystals.

Because he did not need it at all!

Three great laws fusing, this was indeed very amazing.

But it was nothing in front of Dao Ancestors.

Because these three Daos stepping into the realm of rule was virtually something impossible.

However, Ye Yuan did it!

Now, he had time, space, and sword, three Daos, step into the realm of rule at the same time!

What did Dao Ancestors count for?

Lin Chaotian finally broke free from the fetters of Heavenly Dao True Word. But his body was already drenched with sweat.

Three great powers of rule were ravaging within his body.

His severed wrist was still bleeding, unable to stop at all.

He looked at Ye Yuan with a horrified face and said, “You … You’re simply not human! H-How did you do it?”

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Chaotian and said coolly, “Lin Chaotian, I won’t kill you!”

Hearing this, Lin Chaotian was wildly ecstatic in his heart.

He never thought that Ye Yuan would actually let him off!

However, what Ye Yuan said next, made him feel like he fell into an ice cellar.

“Today, I’ll waste your cultivation! I’ll suppress you in front of the two race’s realm boundary market, and let you suffer the reviling of humanity endlessly! This humiliation was written by you. So you bear it yourself!”

Finished talking, he did not wait for Lin Chaotian to react either. Ye Yuan executed the Heavenly Dao True Word again.

Lin Chaotian was directly immobilized there.

Then Ye Yuan smacked a palm towards his abdomen area.

A terrifying power of law directly penetrated into his divine sea and shattered his small world into pieces.

Ye Yuan struck extremely heavily. Lin Chaotian’s small world had already been completely destroyed and it would be absolutely impossible to regenerate again.

Lin Chaotian had despair written all over his eyes. He glared at Ye Yuan and bellowed, “You … You’re the devil! Ye Yuan, I won’t let you off even if I become a ghost!”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he laughed in spite of himself and said, “Then you’ll have to be able to become a ghost first! Return!”

It was only to see him reach his hand out and beckon. The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain directly broke away from Lin Chaotian’s control and returned to Ye Yuan’s hand.

These few years, although the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain had been in Lin Chaotian’s hands, he was unable to refine it at all.

A precious treasure like the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain was not what anybody could refine.

Concerning Lin Chaotian’s outcome, Ye Yuan had long thought about it.

His sins could not be paid off with a simple death.

Facing the divine race’s invasion, Lin Chaotian only thought of his own interests and nearly doomed the human race for all of eternity.

This sin needed him to go and repay himself!

Currently, Lin Chaotian was still a Dao Ancestor, but he already did not have divine essence to display the power of rules.

The current Lin Chaotian was like a baby walking through the downtown area while hugging a gold brick.

In the crowd, there were already many people whose eyes turned green

Dao Ancestor!

Who did not want to become a Dao Ancestor?

But right at this time, Ye Yuan said coolly, “You all can beat or scold him, but you can’t kill him! I have another use for the fire rule crystal!”

This sentence immediately extinguished everyone’s fantasies.

Who dared not follow Ye Yuan’s words?

Killing Lin Chaotian was easy. But even if they became Ancestor Fire, so what?

Ye Yuan could kill them like killing a dog!

This fire rule crystal, Ye Yuan was saving it for Fiery.

Ever since Fiery left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, he had been in closed-seclusion in his hidden place. Till today, he had not exited seclusion.

But this fire rule crystal was naturally most suitable for him.
