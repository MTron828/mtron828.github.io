Chapter 2075: Sweeping Through Jiu Luo

Several days later, a piece of extremely explosive news spread throughout the entire Jiu Luo Ji.

Empyrean Loneswan acknowledged Ji Qingyun as his master and paid respects to the latter as a disciple!

This news was akin to a heavyweight bombshell, stirring up titanic waves in Jiu Luo Ji.

“Did I hear wrongly? No matter how powerful that Ji Qingyun is, he’s also merely a Six-star Alchemy God. Does Lord Loneswan have this need?”

“Truly inconceivable! A Seven-star Alchemy God actually acknowledged a Six-star Alchemy God as a master. I’ve lived for tens of thousands of years, but it’s still my first time hearing of such a thing.”

“Just what kind of god is Ji Qingyun, to actually be able to bring Lord Loneswan into submission?”

... ...

The entire Jiu Luo Ji blew up. Everyone was discussing this matter frenziedly.

Everyone was filled with curiosity toward this Ji Qingyun that popped out from no idea where.

Empyrean Loneswan had always been a godlike figure in Jiu Luo Ji all along.

Even Empyrean powerhouses also showed extra reverence to him and did not dare to offend in the slightest.

But now, this kind of godlike existence actually acknowledged a thousand over years old youth as his master. It was simply too astonishing.

But very soon, another explosive news came over. Grand Pill Establishment rolled out a new kind of wine. The name of the wine was Sunshine Glow.

Grand Pill Establishment was recruiting nine sales representatives. Once the news came out, it immediately caused a great sensation in the entire Jiu Luo Ji.

This Grand Pill Establishment was Empyrean Loneswan’s force.

Not only this wine called Sunshine Glow had excellent taste, but it also had the effect of keeping out the cold.

As long as Celestial Deity Realm martial artists drank a cup, they would not need to use any cold-warding method for half a month.

As soon as this wine was rolled out, it immediately spread throughout the entire Jiu Luo Ji in a frenzy. Various restaurants, taverns, and wine shops rushed toward Grand Pill Establishment crazily, wanting to obtain Sunshine Glow’s dealership rights.

Hearing this news, Zhang Tu almost went mad.

Others did not know, but he knew that this Sunshine Glow was Master Ji’s wine!

Now, his intestines were almost green with regret.

Back then, if not for a moment of muddleheadedness, offending Master Ji, with the Raging Fire Tavern’s strength and his relationship with Master Song Cao, wouldn’t getting Sunshine Glow’s dealership rights still be accomplished with ease?

But sadly, there was no regret medicine in this world that could be eaten!

Even so, Zhang Tu still brought a large gift and went to find Song Cao.

“Master Song Cao, you’re also aware, my Raging Fire Tavern is number one in Jiu Luo Ji. There are hundreds of branches alone ...”

“Number one? Heh heh, that’s all in the past! The moment Sunshine Glow emerged, your Raging Fire Tavern probably can’t even enter the top 10 anymore. Brother, don’t blame me. Want to blame someone, blame yourself for not having eyes, offending Grandmaster. These things, bring them away. If Grandmaster knew about it, wouldn’t he break my legs?”

Zhang Tu’s words were not finished saying yet and were interrupted by Song Cao coldly, directly issuing an order to evict the guest.

Leaving the Song Manor, Zhang Tu felt like the entire world turned gloomy.

A single misstep resulted in eternal regret!

In the old days, his Raging Fire Brew was unique in Jiu Luo Ji. It could be said that he could summon the rain and wind in Jiu Luo Ji.

But now, the Raging Fire Brew was left without anyone caring about it overnight.

Sure enough, the nine great representatives were picked very quickly. As soon as Sunshine Glow came out, it was akin to like a fierce wind passing through, being all the rage.

There were long queues in the shops of the nine sales representatives every day.

Many martial artists queued for several days and nights in order to taste a mouthful of this legendary Sunshine Glow.

“Really too freaking delicious! Grand Pill Establishment is really harming people! After drinking this wine, drinking other wines will be like horse piss.”

“Equipped with this jar, I won’t need to think of ways to ward off the cold within a year anymore!”

“This wine should only belong in the heavens! Fine wine! Fine wine!”

... ...

After Sunshine Glow came out, it became an extremely popular item very soon. Even if Grand Pill Establishment brewed it around the clock, it was also unable to satisfy the enthusiasm of all the martial artists.

Later on, the various major restaurants could only limit the supply.

A cup of Sunshine Glow was even hiked to a sky-high price.

But even so, no one would go and sell the wine at all.

People who had the luck to purchase the wine all cherished what was theirs, hiding and tucking it away, fearful of being known by people.

On this day, Zhang Tu finally purchased a small jar of Sunshine Glow after queuing for seven days and nights.

Hence, he could not wait and drank a mouthful.

The moment the wine entered the abdomen, a mellowness instantly spread throughout his four limbs and bones, as if an electric current ran through.

At the same time, a hot current gathered at this dantian area, as if it was the blazing sun illuminating from high up, continuously warming his body.

“Fine wine! Truly excellent wine!” Zhang Tu could not resist praising.

But after praising, his expression turned dim. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Such a fine wine, he actually passed right by it!

Originally, it should be him who became a figure who could summon the wind and rain in this Jiu Luo Ji.

But now, everything was gone!

... ...

Inside Grand Pill Establishment, Empyrean Loneswan was looking at Ye Yuan with a look of worship.

Toward Ye Yuan, he already prostrated on all fours in admiration.

After Ye Yuan entered Grand Pill Establishment, Empyrean Loneswan asked him about some areas that he did not understand. The incisiveness of Ye Yuan’s understanding took his breath away in astonishment.

On some areas that were obstructed originally, he suddenly saw the light.

The following few days, the more he consulted Ye Yuan on Alchemy Dao, the more that he felt that Ye Yuan was unfathomable.

He even suspected whether or not Ye Yuan already stepped into the legendary Ancestor Realm.

Otherwise, how could he have such a deep understanding of Alchemy Dao?

Therefore, he steeled his resolve and acknowledged Ye Yuan as his master.

Ye Yuan hesitated for a moment but still agreed.

This Empyrean Loneswan could acknowledge him as master as a Seven-star; it could be seen that he genuinely loved alchemy.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan still had to borrow Empyrean Loneswan’s power to save Lu-er.

After acknowledging him as his disciple, Ye Yuan took out the Sunshine Glow’s recipe and handed it to Empyrean Loneswan.

After Empyrean Loneswan drank the Sunshine Glow, he felt even more respect towards Ye Yuan from the depths of his heart.

As the saying went: those who reached first can teach. Ye Yuan could casually take out such a freakish pill formula, it could be seen how deep his attainments in Alchemy Dao were.

Indeed as expected, as soon as Sunshine Glow rolled out, it immediately swept across Jiu Luo Ji, and allowed Grand Pill Establishment earn boatloads of money.

“Listening attentively to Master preach on Dao these few days, this disciple suddenly saw the light and seemed to have already touched the threshold of middle-stage Dao Realm,” Empyrean Loneswan said excitedly.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and shook his head and said, “You’re still far away! Although you became an Empyrean and a Seven-star Alchemy God, your foundation is too shallow. It seems like you’ve already touched the threshold of middle-stage Dao Realm, but in reality, you’re too far away. Even if give you a thousand, ten thousand years, you might not be able to enter middle-stage Dao Realm too.”

Imparting Dao to Loneswan these few days, Ye Yuan was already shocked.

He had never seen before a Seven-star Alchemy God with such a shallow foundation.

Being able to enter Seven-star, this Empyrean Loneswan absolutely got massively lucky.

Placed in the Southern Border, Empyrean Loneswan was probably even inferior to Yun Yi, let alone talk about other Seven-star Alchemy Gods.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s face, Empyrean Loneswan also had a look of embarrassment on his face as he said with vicissitudes of emotion, “It’s exactly as Master said. It’s just that this Northernmost Steppe, spirit medicines are lacking and inheritances are missing. Wanting to step into Seven-star is as hard as ascending to heaven!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Hence, if you want to improve further, don’t reach beyond your grasp, but be down-to-earth.”

Empyrean Loneswan repeatedly said yes.

The two people chatted for a while when Empyrean Loneswan suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Master, Jiu Luo Ji’s other seven great Empyreans have heard about you. All of them want to come over to pay respects to you. I wonder ... what’s your opinion?”
