Chapter 2621: Holy Son Arrives

On a long path of the street, an old man and a youth were walking slowly.

One could tell that the blue-robed youth walking in front was very haughty.

Suddenly, a talisman appeared out of thin air. The old man reached his hand out to seize, grabbing the talisman in his hand.

Browsing entirely the contents of the talisman, the old man’s brows knitted together tightly.

The young man said indifferently, “Why? Lost again?”

The old man nodded slightly and said, “This is already the 17th match! Even Shangyu Heavenly Sect’s Qian Yao Great Nation’s Mu Lianqing was defeated at Ye Yuan’s hands. He’s an existence who fought with you for the position of holy son back then!”

The young man said disdainfully,?“Humph,?what does Mu Lianqing count as? What you’re talking about is just something back then. Now, he isn’t even worthy of carrying my shoes!”

The old man said, “True! Lord Holy Son is a candidate for the next alliance chief. How can you be what Mu Lianqing can compare to? It’s just that this Ye Yuan can’t be underestimated!”

Mentioning Ye Yuan, the young man was similarly disdainful as he said, “If he didn’t have some skill, the alliance chief wouldn’t have sent this holy son over too! However, no matter how monstrous he is, he’s still not worth mentioning in front of my Pill Alliance. Let him be smug for a few days first. After this holy son grinds down his spirit, those despicable ascenders will know who is the Rainclear Continent’s true ruler!”

Three months had already passed since Ye Yuan caused a disturbance at Pill Verdant Establishment.

In these three months, Ye Yuan challenged 17 of the Pill Alliance’s strongholds in a row and consecutively defeated 17 of the Pill Alliance’s alchemy path experts.

The five great heavenly sects were in a huge stir!

Especially Qian Yao Great Nation’s Mu Lianqing, he refined a middle ninth grade golden pill, but he was still suppressed by Ye Yuan!

Originally, when Ye Yuan threw out the name of Pill Pavilion in Fire Peace Great Nation, people were all still indifferent to it.

But now, the name of Pill Pavilion already reverberated throughout the Five Light Heavenly Region.

The various major factions sent disciples with aptitude to Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s Pill Pavilion one after another to cultivate Alchemy Dao.

Five Light Heavenly Region’s five great heavenly sects were virtually all ascenders. Those capable of becoming heavenly alchemists could be counted on one’s fingers.

Hence, the five great heavenly sects’ reliance on the Pill Alliance was especially so.

With the Pill Alliance carrying out a boycott against the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, the other four sects naturally had a feeling of the fox mourning the death of a rabbit.

But the more it was so, the more they did not dare to offend the Pill Alliance.

However, the appearance of the Pill Pavilion completely changed this situation.

Ye Yuan already used his strength to prove to the world that the Pill Pavilion’s strength was not the least bit inferior to the Pill Alliance!

It was even stronger!

At least, up until now, no one in the Pill Alliance could win him!

With regards to this kind of sensational effect, it was naturally impossible for the Pill Alliance to resign themselves to death.

Hence, they sent out Cang Yongning who was this blue-robed youth.

He was the Pill Alliance’s holy son and also the strongest alchemy path powerhouse of the junior generation!

The Pill Alliance had always been mysterious. Nobody knew just how strong the Pill Alliance was.

And the Pill Alliance sent out Cang Yongning this time. Firstly, it was in order to strike Ye Yuan down, while secondly, it was in order to demonstrate their strength!

The old man nodded and said, “That’s of course! No matter how monstrous this boy is, he’s naturally too weak to stand up to the competition in front of Holy Son! Our Pill Alliance has always been low-key. It’s also time to let Rainclear Continent know our Pill Alliance’s strength!”

Cang Yongning smiled slightly and said, “Where’s that punk now?”

The old man said, “Cloudarch Great Nation!”

Cang Yongning nodded his head and said,?“Mn,?it’s already not far from here. Let’s go!”

… …

In Cloud Leisure Establishment, Kan Feihong was anxious like an ant on a hot pan.

He paced back and forth, cold sweat already pouring profusely on his forehead.

By the side, Establishment Lord Sun Xu also had a solemn look.

“Is there no news from Lord Holy Son yet? That Ye Yuan has already entered the city. What should we do?” Kan Feihong said anxiously.

The defeat of Qian Yao Great Nation’s Mu Lianqing completely shattered Kan Feihong’s fantasy.

He knew that Mu Lianqing was an existence on par with the holy son!

Although he was defeated in the end, his strength could not be ignored by anyone.

However, even such an existence was defeated at Ye Yuan’s hands, how could he be a match?

Sun Xu shook his head and said, “How can Lord Holy Son’s whereabouts be what we can grasp? However, I reckon that he shouldn’t be too far away anymore, right? Maybe he’s already on the way to Cloud Leisure Establishment! After all, even Mu Lianqing was defeated. If Lord Holy Son still doesn’t appear, our Pill Alliance’s face will have nowhere to put!”

Kan Feihong said angrily, “By the time Lord Holy Son comes over, the flowers would have turned yellow!”

Boom!

Right at this time, a loud noise came from outside.

No need to guess, it must be that Ye Yuan had arrived.

Whenever they reached a place, Luo Yunqing would directly tear down the signboard, without exception!

At least up to this point, there was no one in the Pill Alliance who could win back this face.

Mu Lianqing was also very domineering back then. But he suffered a crushing defeat and was ashamed and resentful.

Kan Feihong’s expression changed and he said, “Damn it, that brat is here! What to do? Fight, we will definitely lose. Not fighting, it’s shameful! Alas!”

Seeing Kan Feihong sigh heavily, Sun Xu also had a helpless look.

He understood Kan Feihong very well.

Kan Feihong was not like this originally. Before Ye Yuan challenged Mu Lianqing, he even pledged in all solemnity that he would definitely stop Ye Yuan’s footsteps of continuous victories.

But now, he did not dare to say it anymore.

Sun Xu heaved a sigh and said, “No matter what, go out first! Even if our Pill Alliance loses, we can’t be cowardly turtles too!”

Kan Feihong had a bitter face and nodded his head. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Outside Cloud Leisure Establishment, it was already seething with excitement.

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect produced an alchemy path expert who beat the Pill Alliance to the ground.

This matter had long already spread throughout Cloudarch Great Nation.

The people had long already heard of Ye Yuan’s great name. Upon seeing him today, he was indeed extraordinary.

“Heh,?I even thought that it was boasting previously. Looking at it now, the rumors are true! Cloud Leisure Establishment’s Master Kan Feihong is actually scared until he doesn’t dare to come out!”

“This Ye Yuan is really too formidable, fortifying the spirits of us ascenders!”

“Every day they talked about how the Pill Alliance’s people are so formidable. Looking at it now, it’s also nothing more than this!”

… …

Seeing that Cloud Leisure Establishment’s front door was tightly shut and no one dared to come out, the people were all snickering without ceasing.

It was also no wonder that these people exclaimed in surprise. It was undeniable that the Pill Alliance powerhouses that Ye Yuan challenged, they were all alchemy path powerhouses who garrisoned a region far and near!

These people’s alchemy path strength was even stronger than the various major heavenly sect’s retainers.

However, Ye Yuan could win 17 matches in a row. It was sufficient to prove how terrifying his strength was.

Creak!

Cloud Leisure Establishment’s front door was finally opened, revealing Kan Feihong and Sun Xu’s figures.

Kan Feihong’s expression was slightly dark and he said to Ye Yuan, “Punk, don’t be arrogant! My Pill Alliance has already sent out Lord Holy Son! Once he arrives, you’ll get it!”

Ye Yuan looked at Kan Feihong and said with a faint smile, “Why? Your Pill Alliance all became cowards and don’t even dare to accept the challenge anymore?”

Seeing Kan Feihong’s being threatening in manner but inwardly shaky appearance, everyone was shocked.

This guy who came from the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect was really too strong! To actually scare Kan Feihong until he did not dare to make a move!

One had to know, Kan Feihong’s alchemy path strength was extremely strong!

It could be seen how great a deterrent Ye Yuan’s consecutive wins previously was!

Kan Feihong’s expression was ugly to the extreme, and he said in a solemn voice, “Ye Yuan, I admit defeat! But don’t leave if you have the capability! When Holy Son comes, you’ll be embarrassed!”
