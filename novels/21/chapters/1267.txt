Chapter 1271: So, This is the Deity Realm!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Fang Tian looked at the insufferably arrogant Kanuo in the distance, his expression turned gloomy.

“In the end, Ye Yuan couldn’t make it?”

“Senior, I’ll go and fight him!” Teng Yun said.

Fang Tian gave him a glance said, “You don’t need to go and die. With his current strength, annihilating you is just a matter of a flick of a finger. You’re unable to imagine how terrifying the strength of Origin Deity Realm is!”

Fang Tian comprehended for 10 thousand years and only merely comprehended concepts to the Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm.

It was precisely because of so that he was even more aware of how frightening the Origin Deity Realm was.

Moreover, even the Absolute Heaven back then was unable to kill Kanuo.

How great his strength was could be seen at a glance.

“Then ... What should we do?” With Teng Yun’s might, he had a look of despair at this time too.

Fang Tian heaved a sigh and said, “Delaying every second count, I guess! If Ye Yuan can succeed, he’ll help to avenge us. If not ... Then the Divine Realm will also end here!”

Teng Yun could not help feeling stifled when he heard that. He had followed Fang Tian for many years already. He had never seen before Fang Tian speak with this kind of tone.

He knew that Fang Tian was really at his wit’s end already.

Even if Fang Tian risked this old life, it was also not possible to be Kanuo’s match.

But at this time, Cao Yunzhi came over anxiously to find, and said, “Senior, that guy is too arrogant! The people below are all seething with righteous indignation and are all requesting to battle! I almost can’t suppress it anymore!”

Teng Yun brows furrowed, and he said, “This bunch of guys who think themselves to be infallible. Do they really think that the fiend race is kneaded from clay?”

Fang Tian said to Teng Yun, “You go and quell them a bit. Have everyone not to act recklessly without careful though! They don’t know the terror of a heavenly fiendgod, so being like this is also understandable. I’ll go and face-off with Kanuo.”

Finished talking, his figure moved, vanishing from where he was.

...

With the medicinal pill entering his abdomen, Ye Yuan felt like he was about to explode.

The surging medicinal strength gushed forth wantonly inside his body.

Finally, his body could not endure it anymore and directly exploded into pieces!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions changed drastically!

“Big Brother Yuan!”

“Big Brother!”

“Young Master!”

...

Li-er they all were dumbfounded by this scene that arrived unexpectedly. All of them screamed and sprinted towards Ye Yuan.

However, barely taking two steps, they were stopped by a powerful force and were unable to move an inch forward.

A calm voice sounded out beside their ears.

“He’s not dead yet. Don’t shout and wrangle! You all, look!” Kunwu said.

Everyone was shocked. Focused their eyes and looking over, they discovered that the shattered Ye Yuan did not scatter everywhere, but coagulated and did not dissipate.

An enormous Tai Chi diagram appeared out of thin air once more, condensing Ye Yuan’s flesh and blood inside.

“Senior, this ... What’s going in? Is Big Brother Yuan alright?” Li-er was uncertain what it meant and still asked incomparably nervously.

The scene just now was truly too frightening. At that moment, she only felt her head buzz, her mind a total blank.

But Kunwu said with an indifferent look, “Heh, how can a mortal fleshy body withstand Heavenly Dao? Reestablishing after being broken, he re-molded Heavenly Dao with a medicinal pill. Right now, his lesser Heavenly Dao is going to re-mold Essence, Energy, and Spirit, so that it can withstand his Heavenly Dao.”

Everyone exchanged glances when they heard that, all had looks of incredulity.

They had never heard before that achieving Deity Realm would have such a thing happen!

Ye Yuan’s way of breaking through was truly too frightening.

Seeing the expression on everyone’s faces, Kunwu smiled and said, “If it was 100 thousand years ago, him breaking through to Deity Realm naturally doesn’t need to be like this. But now ... huhu, one naturally can’t use normal means to breakthrough. His current situation is tantamount to operating a miniature Heavenly Dao within his own body, and has no correlation with the outside world anymore! But you guys rest assured. When he breaks through to Grotto Profound Deity Realm, his strength will be much stronger compared to ordinary Grotto Profound Deity Realms.”

Even though Kunwu’s explanation was well-grounded and reasoned, with everyone’s relationship with Ye Yuan, not seeing Ye Yuan recover his original appearance with their own eyes, how could they set their minds at ease?

But Ye Yuan’s current state was totally different from that horrifying sight that everyone saw.

He felt like he seemed to have returned to his mother’s womb. Everything was so serene and peaceful.

At this moment, he felt like he had floated above the ninth layer of heaven, overlooking all life.

As if the Divine Realm’s everything, he was able to take it all into his sight!

“This is ... Endless World! Wu Fang City!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was currently staring at the Lower Realms’ Wu Fang City at this time!

The city was still as busy as ever. Everyone came to this alchemy holy land to make a pilgrimage.

Ever since this place produced a Ye Yuan, the reputation of alchemy holy land could no longer be shaken.

“That is ... Father!”

Ye Yuan was pleasantly surprised. Who he saw was precisely Ye Hang!

Ye Hang at this time was currently sitting high above at the City Lord Manor, signing something for the people below.

Turned out that he was actually Wu Fang City’s city lord already!

“Heh heh, ten years, Father really did it!”

Even though there was Ye Yuan around, the ten-year covenant originally was already nothing.

But Ye Hang still did not be laidback!

Within 10 years, Ye Hang broke through to peak Alchemy Sovereign, becoming this Wu Fang City’s lord!

His grandfather, Ren Xingchun, had clearly relinquished his throne already.

Ye Yuan’s heart stirred and saw that Ren Xingchun was currently cultivating in closed-seclusion inside a secret room.

In addition, Ren Hongling was currently talking to a teenage girl.

That little girl was actually 70% to 80% similar to Ren Hongling between the brows. She also looked somewhat similar to him.

“Could it be that this little girl ... is actually my sister! Haha, with a sister to carry out filial piety on my behalf, it also put my heart at much greater ease.”

Discovering this scene, Ye Yuan was pleasantly surprised too.

Ye Hang’s and Ren Hongling’s age were not considered old. They, who were without children, gave birth to a sister for him alleviated Ye Yuan’s sense of guilt significantly.

Following that, Ye Yuan’s gaze swept over and saw the Tranquil Cloud Sect that was like the noonday sun.

The current Tranquil Cloud Sect was goodness knows how many times grander than before.

Inside the sect, Long Tang was dressed in the sect master’s attire. He actually became the master of the Tranquil Cloud Sect already!

Seeing all these, Ye Yuan could not help feeling vicissitudes of emotion. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

In a blink of an eye, it had already been close to 20 years since he left the Endless World.

Even though the Endless World was just a small world, it had a tremendous impact on Ye Yuan’s this lifetime.

Of course, in the eyes of the current Ye Yuan, the Endless World did not even count as a small world.

Because even this Divine Realm was also merely an empyrean world.

Outside, there was an even broader space.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s mind stirred, and he turned his gaze to the Divine Realm’s dragon clan, and it involuntarily became intent!

Above the sky, Fang Tian and Heavenly Fiendgod faced each other from a distance, seemingly talking about something.

Heavenly Fiendgod Kanuo actually came into being once more!

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan could not help panicking greatly in his heart.

He did not expect that it was still Kanuo who was a step faster in the end!

Just as Ye Yuan was burning with anxiety, Ye Yuan’s consciousness was abruptly pulled away.

He only felt his eyes blur, the scene returning to the Godsfall Mountain Range again.

Sensing this brand new body, Ye Yuan felt like he possessed limitless power. It was as if the entire world could be used by him!

“So, this is the Deity Realm!” Ye Yuan muttered.
