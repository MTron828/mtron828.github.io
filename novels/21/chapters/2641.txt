Chapter 2647: Turning Stone into Gold!

When he walked out of the secret room, there was an additional glimmer of brilliance in Ge Ling’s eyes.

He did not expect that pills could still be refined this way!

To him who had an uncultivated background, Ye Yuan’s casual guidance made him feel like he suddenly saw the light.

At this very moment, he was full of awe for Ye Yuan.

“Old Ge, still going up? I want to say that your strength is pretty good too. But, continue losing like this, this old face of yours will be completely lost!” When Zuo Fang saw Ge Ling get on the stage again, he could not refrain from mocking.

Ge Ling’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Who wins and who loses is still unknown!”

Zuo Fang did not care and said with a smile,?“Huhu,?being guided by a junior, you’re really able to give up on this old face! You wouldn’t really think that in less than an hour, you’ll be able to surpass me, right?”

Ge Ling snorted coldly and said, “That will only be known after competing!”

Zuo Fang laughed loudly and said, “Looks like you really take it seriously! Being taught by a junior, if you were to still lose, you probably won’t be able to go out in Calm South City in the future anymore, right?”

Ge Ling knew that he could not win him with words, so he could only give a cold snort and stop talking.

This round of alchemy competition was starting again very quickly.

The nine cities’ heavenly alchemists made a move once again!

Everyone’s eyes were naturally focused on Ge Ling.

The heavenly alchemists present were all not weaklings.

It was just that, they also could not see that there were overly obvious changes to Ge Ling.

Everything seemed to be the same as before.

Continuing to refine step by step, it was simply impossible to win.

“Huhu,?this is a big joke! A grade three heavenly alchemist was actually guided by a junior. The key is that there aren’t any changes still!”

“Looks like this time, Calm South City is really going to become the laughingstock of the nine cities. After everyone goes back, today’s matter can probably serve as a joke for a year.”

“What’s going on with City Lord Su Yi, to actually accompany a junior to mess around!”

… …

Many people were all discussing animatedly.

Clearly, they were not optimistic about Ge Ling.

When these words landed in Su Yi’s ears, it made him even more upset.

Earlier, he was quelled by Ye Yuan in a few words, thinking that Ye Yuan was really formidable.

Looking at it now, he was simply fooling people! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yet, this guy was still sitting by the side like nobody’s business.

“Master Jiang Li, is there anything different?” Compared to others, Sun Yunjing still believed in Jiang Li more.

It was also Jiang Li’s assessment that cowed Sun Yunjing.

Jiang Li stared at Ge Ling for a long time before shaking his head and saying, “There’s not much difference. I said it earlier, habits are the scariest. How can it be changed so easily? This battle, Ge Ling will still lose for sure!”

The moment Sun Yunjing heard, he immediately settled his heart back in place.

Jiang Li was his trump card, Sun Yunjing trusted his vision very much.

Even he said that it would not work, then it definitely would not work.

“Su Yi, looks like this little brother can really transform the rotten into something magical! Ge Ling changed until I almost couldn’t recognize him anymore!?Hahaha?…” Sun Yunjing started his great mockery art again.

Actually, the nine cities were of the same breath and branch. They resisted the true spirit sea race jointly and at the same time were also in a competitive relationship.

The nine great city lords also secretly competed with each other.

This was also the situation that Heavenly South City was willing to see.

The Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit was the best opportunity to show off to begin with. It was naturally impossible for Sun Yunjing to let it slip by.

Su Yi had a dark look and did not play along, but gave a cold snort and said to Ye Yuan, “Brat, do you want to explain it? Because of you, Calm South City and this old man have already incurred the ridicule of experts today!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was on Ge Ling the entire time. Without even looking at him, he just said coolly, “You just watch, isn’t the result not out yet?”

Su Yi was taken back, immediately gnashing his teeth in hatred.

This boy was really cocky to the extreme!

By the side, Su Peiyun was extremely awkward.

She discovered that bringing Ye Yuan was simply a mistake.

Now, she had already ridden the tiger and found it hard to dismount.

But the combat power that Ye Yuan displayed in the sea still made her unwilling to give up.

Huang Haoyan sensed Su Peiyun’s awkwardness. Gritting his teeth, he said to Ye Yuan, “Senior Ye, Peiyun and I both respect you very much! I’m afraid that it’s not appropriate for you to do so, right?”

Ye Yuan found it funny in his heart, but he just said indifferently, “What’s not appropriate about it?”

Huang Haoyan said, “Peiyun only had the intention of getting on friendly terms with Senior. But you made the entire Calm South City become a laughingstock for your own face! This isn’t appropriate!”

Clearly, Huang Haoyan and Su Peiyun had already talked about it. The two people’s relationship was re-established.

But, with Ye Yuan doing so, it made them still unable to accept it.

Ye Yuan still said coolly, “Whether it’s a laughingstock or laughing proudly, you just watch!”

Amidst the mocking voices, the pill refinement of the nine great grade three heavenly alchemists gradually reached an end.

The nine heavenly pills were presented to the judge’s bench.

Three grade four heavenly alchemists started undergoing a comprehensive judgment of the nine heavenly pills.

“Skybless City’s Yuan Yi, Thunderfire Heavenly Dipper Pill, middle fifth grade!”

“Yong He City’s Zhao Lei, Sulfur Flame Kun Earth Pill, upper fifth grade!”

… …

Cui Tong reported the results one by one, without much surprise.

He was a grade four heavenly alchemist from Heavenly South City, his status extremely revered.

The strength of these grade three heavenly alchemists was actually very close.

This round, whoever performed a little better, might clinch victory.

As for the commotion on Sun Yunjing and Ye Yuan this side, he naturally noticed it too. But he did not pay too much attention.

In his view, Ye Yuan was merely talking big to impress people.

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, he would be a grade two heavenly alchemist at the very most. How could he possibly guide a grade three heavenly alchemist?

But, with this farce, he still harbored some curiosity about Ge Ling’s heavenly pill.

This time, Ge Ling was the last to complete the refinement, so he was queued last.

“Water Billow City’s Zuo Fang, Emerald Dawn Meteorite Pill, lower sixth grade!” Cui Tong said coolly.

Finished speaking, he picked up Ge Ling’s heavenly pill and placed it onto the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.

Suddenly, his gaze turned intent, looking at the scale in amazement.

Middle sixth grade!

“It … It actually reached middle sixth grade! This … how is this possible?” Cui Tong sucked in a cold breath.

Before this, Ge Ling had never reached sixth grade before!

The best was also merely upper fifth grade!

This time, he actually directly broke through a grade and reached middle sixth grade!

The two people beside him were also surprised!

“This … should be a coincidence, right?” Another grade four heavenly alchemist said.

Cui Tong sucked in a deep breath and said with a nod, “It should be a coincidence! If casually giving some pointers can attain this kind of effect, that’s would also be too monstrous! Even the likes of us can’t achieve it. So how can a grade two heavenly alchemist possibly do it?”

Following that, he said loudly, “Calm South City’s Ge Ling, Six Ren Carefree Pill, middle sixth grade!”

The moment these words came out of his mouth, the entire audience exploded!

“What? Really won?”

“How is this possible? Gave pointers on the spot and it promoted a grade? This is freaking cheating, right?”

“Just what kind of person is that boy, to actually have the ability to turn stone into gold?”

… …

The despots from all around felt that this was simply like talking about a book from heaven; too ridiculous!

A grade two heavenly alchemist spent less than an hour’s time and gave pointers to a grade three heavenly alchemist.

In the end, he won!

You are freaking joking, right?
