Chapter 1435 Giant Flame Stoneman!

Whoosh!

A ray of sword light came through the sky, chopping that lava flying monster flying.

Bang!

At the same time, only to hear a loud bang. Ye Yuan’s body was directly smashed flying out.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan directly spewed out a mouthful of blood, but immediately adjusted his position in the air, abruptly borrowing force and returned into the group battle.

In midair, he even managed to find time to release several swords, cutting down lava flying monsters.

“Master Ye Yuan!” Bai Chen’s eyes were bloodshot as he shouted.

If not for Ye Yuan helping him to block this, he would be dead for sure.

“I’m fine! This thing’s speed is too fast, be careful!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

Forcefully taking the hit of a lava flying monster, Ye Yuan felt his blood in turmoil too.

Fortunately, his fleshy body was already grand completion first transformation and what he cultivated was also the Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art. His defensive power was more than several times stronger than those in the same rank.

A one time impact would not cause fatal damage to him yet.

Bai Chen clenched his jaws, self-reproaching emotions had long already filled his chest.

“Who said that the trial-takers were all bad guys who destroyed the Sky Foothill World? Master, he values relations and sentiments immensely;God knows how many times better than the Sky Foothill World’s people! It’s all my fault! All my fault for being too weak! I want to become strong! I can’t become Master’s burden!”

A surge of powerful fighting spirit erupted from his body.

“Kill!”

Bai Chen’s spear was peerlessly domineering, brazenly attacking.

In this instance, a trace of enlightenment was produced in Bai Chen’s heart.

Originally, he could not catch the lava flying monsters at all. At this time, he actually saw it incomparably clearly!

His spear tip was actually slowing down!

Boom!

This spear struck a lava flying monster without any deviation!

Ye Yuan’s hands did not slow down in the slightest, but taking this spear of Bai Chen’s into his sights, revealing a hint of a praising smile.

“Haha, I finally did it!” Bai Chen said excitedly.

“Pretty well done! Careful, coming again!” Ye Yuan warned.

Bai Chen’s face fell, his spear stabbing out once more!

In a blink, over a hundred lava flying monsters were all blasted away.

On the ground, on the rock walls, were holes everywhere.

Ye Yuan alone virtually resisted over half of the lava flying monsters.

Otherwise, their party would definitely suffer heavy casualties.

Bai Chen came before Ye Yuan with a self-reproaching look and said, “Master, it was all my fault, causing you to be injured!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’ve already done very well. These lava flying monsters are not what the current you can resist. These few years, your painstaking cultivation, Master has seen it. Now, your spear art finally improved further. Congratulations!”

With Bai Chen’s strength, blocking one or two that were weaker was still okay.

Some lava flying monsters’ impact force already approached Heaven Glimpse Realm. How could it be what he was able to deal with?

These few years, Bai Chen trained in the spear for all he was worth, wanting to reach the realm of that spear Ye Yuan exhibited.

For this, he was tired out until all the divine essence in his body was exhausted god knows how many times, collapsing weakly onto the ground.

All these, Ye Yuan naturally saw it.

Presently, his spear art was finally mastered, his strength increasing greatly.

“Huhu, Elder Ye’s sword art is transcendent, how impressive! Facing so many lava flying monsters, not a single person actually died, truly impressive.”

At this time, the others also descended from the sky and landed onto the ground. Huo Tianyang directly taunted

Ye Yuan knew that they had come over long ago. But each and every one of them watched indifferently without lending a hand. Most likely, they all hoped to see the White Night Sacred Palace suffer heavy casualties.

Just now, that lava flying monster almost killed Bai Chen. Huo Tianyang had a look of excitement.

But he did not expect that Ye Yuan saved Bai Chen at the risk of suffering a blow himself.

Even more unexpected was that Ye Yuan was actually still able to maintain such powerful combat strength after suffering such a heavy blow.

Right now, although these words were ridiculing, it actually also had some sour taste in it.

Ye Yuan just smiled when he heard that and said, “Sorry about that, disappointed you. This bit of minor trouble, this Ye can still resolve it. Just take it as blazing the trail for Lord Divine Official. Don’t you say so, Lord Divine Official?”

Ye Yuan looked at Duan Fei with a wide grin. Duan Fei grunted his assent and said, “Elder Ye indeed has fine means. If you don’t fall, you and I might even work together one day!”

Duan Fei’s words immediately caused an uproar.

There were dozens of Heaven Glimpse powerhouses here. But among them, nobody dared to say that they would become Origin Deity powerhouses.

Breaking through to the Origin Deity Realm was far too difficult!

Hence, Duan Fei’s appraisal of Ye Yuan could not be said to not be high.

Of course, the prerequisite was that he did not perish!

Everyone was smart and naturally heard insinuation.

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “This Ye likely won’t have that good fortune!”

Everyone’s expressions changed. This Ye Yuan’s guts were plucky.

The meaning of his words was naturally not saying that he would fall, but saying that Duan Fei would not live till that day!

These two people’s words hid needles, the smell of gunpowder rather strong!

Duan Fei’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Elder Ye, please go ahead!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Go!”

Ye Yuan took the lead and continued leading the White Night Sacred Palace’s people as cannon fodders.

This was a wide stone bridge. The two sides of the stone bridge were endless magma.

Ye Yuan could sense those powerful restriction undulations on both sides and above walking on the stone bridge.

Ye Yuan reckoned that this Celestial Deity Sky Foothill’s comprehensions in fire laws must be extremely deep.

This restriction power, forget about the Deity Realm three realms’ martial artists, even Divine Lord Realm probably could not withstand it too.

“Quickly look! Purple Sand Gold! What a large chunk of Purple Sand Gold!” Bai Chen suddenly shouted.

Duan Fei’s eyes lit up and saw that at the end of the stone bridge, a piece of enormous rock was mounted on that cliff wall. It was likely as large as three people wrapped their arms around.

Purple Sand Gold was an excellent material for refining celestial divine artifacts with a wide range of uses.

The Sky Foothill World’s artifact refining path being prosperous had a lot to do with the existence of the Purple Sand Gold.

Such a large chunk of Purple Sand Gold could be said to be worth several cities.

But everyone’s faces did not have very happy expressions. Because according to the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s rules, Purple Sand Gold, this level of material, all completely belonged to the Sky Foothill Divine Palace.

“Palace Lord Bai Chen, go and pluck down the Purple Sand Gold. At this time, it’s time for your White Night Sacred Palace to show loyalty,” Duan Fei turned to Bai Chen and said indifferently.

Bai Chen was practically about to explode. He glared at Duan Fei and said, “Places that have Purple Sand Gold are bound to have Giant Flame Stonemen! If Lord Divine Official wants to kill me, just say a word, why is there a need to do so?”

Duan Fei smiled and said, “Why, Palace Lord Bai Chen’s meaning is that the White Night Sacred Palace is going to oppose the divine palace?”

Bai Chen’s expression changed, simply infuriated to the extreme.

“Best for me to go then. Lord Divine Official’s charge is a little too big, we can’t bear it!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Master! A Giant Flame Stoneman is extremely strong. Such a large chunk of Purple Sand Gold, it must be adult Giant Flame Stoneman guarding it, existences that rivals middle-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses!” Bai Chen gritted his teeth and said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, it’s fine.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure floated away, arriving at the Purple Sand Gold’s area in a blink of an eye.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Ye Yuan unleashed several slashes with a raise of a hand and directly cut out that Purple Sand Gold.

Slam!

Slam!

Slam!

Indeed as expected, a giant stoneman covered in flames all over appeared in front of everyone.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Duan Fei’s mouth. But very soon, his smile turned stiff on his face!
