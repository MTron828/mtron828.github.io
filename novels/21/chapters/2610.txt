Chapter 2616: Forcing Abdication!

“Come! You and I, let’s have a good fight!”

Luo Yunqing brandished the long sword in his hand, his entire person immediately in flourishing spirits, becoming like a different person from the decadence earlier.

When Shi Feiyu saw this scene, his expression could not help changing.

He schemed for a long time to ruin Luo Yunqing’s sword heart. He did not expect that the moment Ye Yuan came back, he made him regain it!

“Haha,?that’s more like it!” Ye Yuan laughed loudly and said.

“Brother Ye, you have to be careful! I won’t hold back this time!” Luo Yunqing said with a light smile.

“Huhu,?want to win me, you’re still lacking!”

Ye Yuan laughed loudly, two green leaves turning into a myriad of sword lights and rushing toward Luo Yunqing.

Luo Yunqing one person and his sword became a unified entity, revealing its sharp edge.

Clank, clank, clank?…

In an instant, the two people exchanged countless sword blows, making people see things in a blur.

Ye Yuan’s advantage previously was all gone!

In everyone’s eyes, the two people seemed to have turned into two sharp swords, crisscrossing.

What the two people developed was both the limit of Sword Dao! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At this moment, Luo Yunqing finally returned to his soul, his entire person revealing a sharp edge, clanking extraordinarily.

But Ye Yuan was not the least bit inferior!

Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao was mellow, very well-balanced, and stable, not leaving the slightest flaw.

No matter how sharp Luo Yunqing was, he was also unable to break through!

Feng Xuanyi watched until his eyes sparkled brightly, secretly crying out lucky in his heart.

Rare talents such as Luo Yunqing and Ye Yuan, gaining them were his good fortune, losing them were his fate!

If not for Ye Yuan returning, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect would really suffer a huge loss!

Ye Yuan’s words earlier also made him feel extremely ashamed.

The master of a sect had too many misgivings.

Luo Yunqing was also like him, willing to sacrifice himself for the sect.

But could sacrificing him be exchanged for the benevolence of the enemy?

In this world, there had never been anyone who survived by wagging their tails and begging for pity.

Want to survive, you could only continuously break through!

People were like so!

The sect was like so too!

When he chased Qin Shun away, he had anticipated today’s result.

It was just that he did not expect that the Pill Alliance was so strong.

Hence, he was overcautious and indecisive again!

Sacrificing the sect’s most outstanding disciples to exchange for the Pill Alliance’s short-term compassion.

Was this really worth it?

The onlookers did not have his complicated thoughts. Ye Yuan and Luo Yunqing’s battle of Sword Dao made all of the disciples’ hot blood seethe with excitement.

Especially disciples that used the sword, they were even more intoxicated from watching.

Even many protectors gave sidelong glances too.

“The two of them really developed Sword Dao to the limit!”

“Putting Elder Luo aside, why is Ye Yuan, this heavenly alchemist’s Sword Dao, so sharp and fierce too?”

“Really incredible! Ye Yuan’s Great Dao Transformation first form has actually already been perfected! What in the world did he experience in the Land of Exile?”

… …

The two people’s battle attracted bursts of exclamations.

Luo Yunqing’s might, that was within reason!

But no one expected that Ye Yuan was so strong too!

Boom!

Suddenly, there was an intense collision. Luo Yunqing flew out backward!

This bit of fluctuation was naturally nothing to him, this Jade Sovereign Heaven.

But everyone could tell that he was defeated!

This time, he really lost!

One astonished gaze after another locked onto Ye Yuan.

He defeated the same rank Luo Yunqing, didn’t that mean that the sect’s number one genius currently, was Ye Yuan?

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

But Luo Yunqing laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… awesome! I, Luo Yunqing, am wholeheartedly convinced at my loss! Didn’t expect that after Brother Ye entered the Land of Exile, not only did he comprehend Great Dao Transformation, you even comprehended it to the extreme! Remarkable! Incredible!”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “Brother Luo is too humble! I faced one law with three laws. It was an unscrupulous win!”

Luo Yunqing waved his sleeves grandly and said, “Victory is victory; defeat is defeat! I, Luo Yunqing, am not someone who can’t take a loss! But this fight let me understand that my Sword Dao still has room for improvement! Of course, more importantly is that I, Luo Yunqing, have found myself again!”

Finished saying, Luo Yunqing said to Feng Xuanyi with clasped hands, “Sect Master, I’m sorry! This fault, I, Luo Yunqing, can’t admit it! From now on, I, Luo Yunqing, will withdraw from the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! My grudge with the Pill Alliance has nothing to do with the Pill Alliance! Farewell!”

Luo Yunqing’s figure moved slightly and he was about to leave.

Feng Xuanyi’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Impudent! Is the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect somewhere that you can come and go as you please? Get back for me!”

Only to see him reach his hand out and point at the void, a piercing cold air billow instantly exploded.

Luo Yunqing was actually forced back!

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, his pupils also constricted slightly.

Indeed well-deserving of being the master of a sect, this kind of strength was simply shocking!

“Sect Master!” Luo Yunqing said anxiously.

“Shut up!” Feng Xuanyi’s brows furrowed and he shouted coldly.

Indeed, Luo Yunqing did not dare to speak anymore.

Shi Feiyu saw through Feng Xuanyi’s intention to protect him and suddenly said, “Sect Master, this farce is already over! Since Ye Yuan has already returned, then he should be held solely responsible for the Pill Alliance’s matter! This matter was caused entirely because of him. If we don’t hand him over to the Pill Alliance, it will likely be hard to appease the Pill Alliance’s wrath!”

Feng Xuanyi’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold snort, “If we hand Ye Yuan over to the Pill Alliance, will they be willing to drop the matter? Could it be that what’s lost isn’t our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s face?”

Shi Feiyu said, “Sect Master, while the sect’s face is important, long-term development is more important! We’re currently already completely boycotted by the Pill Alliance. Over the past two decades, our disciples’ cultivation speed has been getting slower and slower! If we’re unable to appease the Pill Alliance’s fury, this disparity will grow greater and greater! At that time, the Five Great Heavenly Sects will probably become the Four Great Heavenly Sects!”

Feng Xuanyi was just about to speak, but an old man suddenly spoke up, “Feiyu’s words are reasonable! Although Ye Yuan’s talent is decent, his talent can’t save the sect! If we allow the Pill Alliance to continue boycotting, a hundred years later, our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect will probably withdraw from the stage of history!”

The moment these words came out, even Feng Xuanyi’s expression changed too.

But when Shi Feiyu heard that, he was overjoyed.

The one who spoke was Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s head elder, Shen Chang!

Head Elder’s prestige in the sect was extremely high, it did not even lose to the Sect Master Feng Xuanyi.

The moment he spoke up, the weight became heavy.

“Sect Master, being protective of your own at this time, is playing a joke with the sect’s fate! Sect Master, please think thrice before acting!”

“Ye Yuan is lawless and unbridled. Angering Qin Shun away, he has to give an account for this matter!”

“Sect Master please put the interests of the whole above all else!”

… …

Sure enough, the moment Head Elder opened his mouth, many elders spoke up to concur one after another. The height of his prestige could be seen.

But Feng Xuanyi’s expression became ugly to the extreme.

This matter concerned the sect’s destiny, even Head Elder was not optimistic about Ye Yuan either.

This put tremendous pressure on him.

“Enough! All shut up for me!” Feng Xuanyi shouted coldly, quelling everyone.

His gaze swept across everyone, and he said in a solemn voice, “Qin Shun was chased away by me, Feng Xuanyi! This matter, if responsibility needs to be taken, I’ll take full responsibility! If the elders have any dissatisfaction, I, Feng Xuanyi, am willing to give up the position of sect master! But, regarding Ye Yuan and Luo Yunqing, I’m shielding them!”
