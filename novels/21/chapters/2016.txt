Chapter 2020: Yun Yi

“Yes, yes, yes, Your Excellency. It was all because they had eyes but couldn’t see, offending Your Excellency. Your Excellency, please don’t take offense. This grandmaster token isn’t what servants like them can recognize,” Qin Chong’s cold sweat poured profusely as he hurriedly explained.

How exalted were the statuses of people who possessed the grandmaster token? How could they be what he could afford to provoke?

This kind of existence could decide his life and death with one word.

One must not look at how he was Ninth Firmament True God. Because in the eyes of Empyrean powerhouses, he was merely an ant-like existence. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

His own city lord also could not offend a big shot that possessed a grandmaster token for a mere True God Realm expert.

Of course, the grandmaster token that appeared in Ye Yuan’s hand indeed made him very surprised. It could even be said to be hard to imagine.

But a grandmaster token was a grandmaster token. Qin Chong did not doubt its authenticity in the slightest.

In this land of Southern Border, who could snatch away a grandmaster token from the hands of the seven big shots?

Ye Yuan’s bit of strength was not even enough to fill the crevices between the big shots’ teeth. It was even less likely that he snatched it.

Moreover, this grandmaster token also could not be used after snatching it!

Therefore, even though there were a hundred disbeliefs in his heart, Qin Chong still did not dare to be careless in the slightest.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said helplessly, “I just wanted to enter the city, but they insisted that I was swindling people. Uh ... can I go in now?”

Qin Chong hurriedly nodded and said, “Of course, of course! All the grandmaster residences have already been arranged. This lowly one will lead the way for you!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and followed after.

Ning Siyu was delighted in her heart when she saw the expressions of Zheng Buqun and the rest.

“You bunch of guys don’t even recognize the grandmaster token and you dare to flaunt your prowess here. I can only say that you’re ignorant! You all mocked my lord, but you don’t know that you were the most laughable! Your levels are too far apart!”

Finished talking, Ning Siyu caught up with Ye Yuan, leaving behind the dumbfounded crowd.

Zheng Buqun still had a look of disbelief until now as he muttered, “That is a grandmaster token? This ... How is this possible?”

The youth surnamed Duan had an expression like he had seen a ghost as he said, “A Third Firmament True God grandmaster? This ... Is there a mistake?”

...

The grandmaster residence was grand and magnificent, flushed with spiritual energy. It was absolutely in a favorable geographical location.

The residence was built around a lake. In the middle was a miniature lake.

Qin Chong carefully led Ye Yuan into the Danfeng Court and settled him down.

Seeing Qin Chong wanting to speak but swallowing the words back, Ye Yuan said cooly, “Just ask whatever you want to ask. Why are you, a seven-foot-tall burly man, behaving like a woman?”

Qin Chong smiled ostentatiously and said, “I wonder which city lord Master Ye received the invitation from?”

Qin Chong naturally knew the seven great Empyreans. Ye Yuan was clearly not one of them. Then he could only be invited by one of the Empyreans.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This Ye was invited by Empyrean Flutterfeather.”

Qin Chong’s gaze turned intent, and he said in surprise, “Empyrean Flutterfeather?”

Ye Yuan said curiously, “Why? Is there anything wrong?”

Qin Chong hurriedly smiled flatteringly and said, “N-Nothing wrong.”

Although he had a fiery temperament, he was also not so superficial when conducting himself. It was truly that Ye Yuan’s grandmaster token was too surprising.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold snort, “Do you feel that I’m easy to hoodwink because I’m young?”

Qin Chong’s expression changed, being aware that he could not deceive him anymore. He could only smile bitterly. He said, “H-How can it be? In the past, Empyrean Flutterfeather would always invite the Myriad Treasure Tower’s Empyrean Purplewing over. I didn’t expect that ... he actually invited Master Ye this time?”

Ye Yuan’s brows could not help furrowing when he heard it and started musing.

Previously when he agreed to Empyrean Flutterfeather, he forgot that there was such a thing.

Since each city lord had another grandmaster spot, then it would definitely be existences that were about the same as them in the past!

Now that this spot was given to him, wouldn’t he have offended another grandmaster?

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan could not help feeling a headache.

Empyrean Flutterfeather gave him an extremely high status, but Empyrean Flutterfeather also put him on the fire to roast.

By the side, Qin Chong’s thoughts drifted, speculating Ye Yuan’s identity.

Could it be that this Ye Yuan came from the Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma and was a newly emerged genius junior of Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma?

Coming to the Cloudpill Summit this time was likely to come and experience it.

It was just that giving him a grandmaster token was a little too extravagant, right?

For Ye Yuan’s bit of strength to really want to experience things, wouldn’t putting him in the disciples’ generation to spar with those people be more meaningful?

Thinking about it, Qin Chong also felt that something was not right.

Ye Yuan’s martial arts strength was extremely strong. Jumping realms to battle was nothing difficult. Then how strong could his alchemy strength be?

This place was the Cloudpill Summit and not the Martial Dao Summit.

Thinking up to here, Qin Chong became even more disdainful toward Ye Yuan in his heart.

Alright! You, a martial arts powerhouse, came to the Cloudpill Summit to pass off as a grandmaster!

When the time comes, you’ll be embarrassed.

He was practically certain that Ye Yuan was the kind of profligate descendant who was conceited and insolent on account of his ability.

He stayed for a long time in the Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda and came out to look for fun. Qin Chong also saw that he even brought along a beautiful maidservant by his side.

Of course, he could only put these thoughts in his heart and naturally would not say it out.

“Alright, you can go. Oh, right! She’s called Ning Siyu. Help her arrange a bit for her to take part in the Cloudpill Summit,” Ye Yuan said.

“Yes, Your Excellency.” Qin Chong was unable to make head or tail of it, but still answered and left.

Could it be that this kid came to take part in the Cloudpill Summit for this lass?

Occupying a grandmaster spot for a mere Five-star Alchemy God, truly capricious!

...

A Third Firmament True God grandmaster spread in the inner-city very quickly.

Beyond the shock, there was even more indignance.

What capability did a mere Third Firmament True God have, to actually be able to get a grandmaster token?

One had to know, Six-star Alchemy Gods could be easily found in the city. Many were young and promising genius figures. There were also peak Six-star Alchemy Gods that enjoyed high prestige and commanded universal respect.

Which of these people were not stronger than Ye Yuan?

Especially when everyone knew that Ye Yuan was merely a thousand over years old. Furthermore, after knowing that his martial arts were rather impressive, this indignant feeling spread even more.

At this time, seven to eight alchemy geniuses were currently gathered in a restaurant discussing this matter.

“Brother Yun Yi, you aren’t aware, but that kid is really arrogant to the extreme, saying that he’s what number one alchemy genius! To talk about this number one alchemy genius, it can only be Brother Yun Yi!” The one talking was precisely Zheng Buqun.

Ever since learning that Ye Yuan had a grandmaster token in his possession, he was extremely dissatisfied in his heart.

How could a mere Third Firmament True God be worthy of the grandmaster token?

Ye Yuan ‘uttered wild ravings’ and completely did not put his Zheng Family in his sights at all.

He could not swallow this insult.

It was just that Ye Yuan had a grandmaster token in his hand, so he had to swallow it even if he did not want to.

But just because he could not do anything to Ye Yuan, it did not mean that others could not as well.

Yun Yi was a genius alchemist of this Cloudpill Summit, one of the extremely few geniuses who broke through to Dao Realm in this Cloudpill Summit.

Barring no accidents, the champion crowned in the Cloudpill Summit this time would be born from these few Dao Realm powerhouses.

Furthermore, this Yun Yi’s identity was special. He was Empyrean Pilljade’s great-grandson, possessing an extremely exalted status even in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

With him around, wouldn’t dragging that conceited brat down the horse be easily accomplished?

At the very least, Yun Yi could make him lose all standing and reputation, and leave Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital dusty and dirty in appearance.
