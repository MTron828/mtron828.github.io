Chapter 3104: Defying Heaven and Changing Fate!

Ye Yuan’s pen expressed dragons and snakes, sword intent crisscrossing.

Each stroke and each line did not reveal a sharp edge but faintly contained an infinite amount of power.

He had never seen before this kind of sword intent.

Zhuo Bufan immersed himself in Sword Dao his entire life. What he pursued was the extremity of strength.

No matter how strong you were, I would break through with just one sword.

Therefore, he accumulated for many years in Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm, splitting apart the road of life and death with one sword, directly reaching Supreme Hegemon, stunning the entire 33 Heavens.

But Ye Yuan’s sword intent currently was completely different from his understanding of the sword.

What Ye Yuan pursued did not seem to be the extremity of power but something else.

But this did not mean that Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao was not strong.

On the contrary, Zhuo Bufan felt that Ye Yuan’s Sword Dao was extremely powerful!

All of the power was hidden within his strokes.

“Bufan, have you understood Ye Yuan’s sword?” Mi Tian asked.

Clearly, he discovered it too.

Zhuo Bufan shook his head and said, “I don’t understand at all! This Zhuo has comprehended on the sword all my life. I only seek to be uninhibited! His sword intent is getting stronger and stronger, but it doesn’t have killing intent. It’s as if all of the concepts are sealed in the brush strokes. With his close friend’s death, carving the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List, it’s originally something of great sorrow. But there’s no sadness in his sword intent. On the contrary, it has the feeling of solemness instead! I don’t quite understand. If he’s sealing the sword intent, then what’s the use of gaining enlightenment on the sword?”

Mi Tian frowned. Clearly, he did not understand it either.

His feeling was not as clear as Zhuo Bufan’s. But, with his realm, he was naturally able to understand many things too.

It was just that. He also could not understand what on earth Ye Yuan comprehended.

However, Ye Yuan’s sword intent grew stronger and stronger. A tremendous power seemed to be contained in the entire Chaos Heavenly Spirit List.

The current Chaos Heavenly Spirit List was like a bomb that was growing larger and larger in tonnage. The feeling that it gave people was extremely dangerous.

But somehow, under this power, everyone from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven felt a sense of security.

This kind of feeling was very conflicting, and yet it was so real.

No idea how long had passed either, the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List’s aura suddenly changed. It actually gave off rays of golden light halo.

This light halo spread out, submerging into the void.

“Mn? What is this?”

“The Chaos Heavenly Spirit List seems to be different!”

“You guys, quickly look! The broken space seems to be repairing! This light halo is restoring Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

This great battle involved a thousand hegemon realm powerhouses. It could be seen how shocking the destructive power was.

Back then, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s battle, fighting until a world fell apart to pieces was also normal.

The current Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was virtually fought until it crumbled to pieces.

This kind of plane was no longer suitable for cultivation.

Of course, the Eternal River flowed, and Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven would slowly recover. But this time would be very long.

But currently, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s space was actually being repaired quickly.

Large amounts of Eternal River chaos poured into Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. It was as if receiving some kind of guidance.

Zhuo Bufan looked at this scene wide-eyed and was tongue-tied. He then said in shock, “Just what did he comprehend to actually be able to have such a wonderful effect? Sword Dao cutting edge is mainly for killing! I’ve never thought that it would actually have this kind of restoration effect … It’s too inconceivable!”

Mi Tian was also greatly surprised and said, “This old man was born from heaven and earth. How many heroes and peerless heaven’s chosen have I seen before? I’ve long already become used to it. Today, I really broadened my horizons! This boy actually remolded Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven with Sword Dao as a guide! However, this isn’t his own power. Only now did this old man know that some people died, but they are still living in this world!”

Zhuo Bufan’s eyes were full of respect and emotion. He said with a nod, “Everyone says that Hegemons live forever, but how many can really live forever? The fleshy body is easy to decay, but the spirit can live forever! Their cultivation realms might not be high, and their strength might not be great, but their spirit and willpower will endure forever with Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

Mi Tian drew a deep breath and said, “I really don’t know how this kid thinks to actually come up with this Chaos Heavenly Spirit List. Perhaps in the future, it will become an extremely terrifying treasure!”

Abandoning a chaos heavenly treasure, furthermore, it was the Myriad Realms Mountain, this kind of top-grade chaos heavenly treasure. Not everyone had this boldness.

With the Myriad Realms Mountain in hand, Ye Yuan’s combat power would rise to a new high!

But he gave it up resolutely for the sake of Feng Xiaotian and the others, these heroic people who died in battle.

But looking at it now, Ye Yuan’s abandonment was the right choice!

Zhuo Bufan nodded and said, “Willingness to part; only by giving up can one attain something! But, among humans, how many have such resolve to abandon the most important thing to them?”

“It’s them! It’s really them! They are not dead yet!”

“A-Ahh, I seem to have heard that they want to fight side by side with us!”

“Yeah, the danger of the blood race isn’t eliminated yet. Why would these guys be willing to die just like this? Brothers, we’ll continue fighting side by side!”

…..

The powerhouses present also felt a familiar aura.

The intent emitting from the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List was currently reverberating between this heaven and earth.

Many people even had their eyes brimmed over with hot tears.

Was death the end point?

No!

They would rather die to protect this hot soil!

This was their home. No one was allowed to encroach upon it!

One day, two days, a month! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Boom!

People seemed to have felt the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven tremble a bit.

Space was completely consolidated!

But it was not over yet!

The light halos emitting from the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List got stronger and stronger. It was actually strengthening the space.

Mi Tian’s pupils constricted slightly, and he said, “You guys noticed it?”

Cloudmount, Zhuo Bufan, and the rest nodded one by one.

Mi Tian said, “These golden light halos are actually reinforcing outside the boundary wall! Furthermore, it’s not just one layer! At this rate, not only will Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s space become incomparably stable, the heaven and earth spiritual energy retained will reach a terrifying level! Perhaps, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven will become the highest level plane of the 33 Heavens!”

This one sentence from Mi Tian was earth-shattering!

The 33 Heavens, the heaven and earth spiritual energy in all the heavens would reach a delicate balance.

A low-level plane such as Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven could not retain more heaven and earth spiritual energy at all.

Therefore, it was a low-level plane.

And a high-level plane like Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, the space was extremely stable. The heaven and earth spiritual energy retained was also abundant.

Only an abundance of heaven and earth spiritual energy would give birth to more Hegemon Realms, and only then would the strength of the plane get stronger!

Hence, that was why the four great true spirit clans would regard themselves as superior to others.

It was not without basis that they called themselves a high-level race.

It was just that the superiority of planes could not be transferred by outside force at all.

Even if your strength could access heaven and penetrate the earth, it could not change the attribute of the plane too.

But at this time, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s space grew more and more stable. Most likely, it would jump up and surpass Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven!

No one thought that Ye Yuan creating the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List would actually produce such a miraculous effect.

Defying heaven and changing fate was also nothing more than this!

Zhuo Bufan’s pupils constricted, and he said, “I think I understand!”
