Chapter 1955: Six Veins Stellar Pill

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Inside the garden, an elderly man and a young man sat opposite facing each other, chatting away happily.

“Hahaha! Indeed well-deserving of being an emperor surmounting child. Not seeing you for a mere few hundred years, didn’t expect that you’re already a member of my generation! This cultivation speed is truly terrifying!”

“Huhu, it’s just that there were some fortuitous encounters these few years. Rather, not seeing for a few centuries, senior’s elegance remains as before!”

The old man waved his hand and said with a smile, “Are you making fun of this old man? During the last time, this old man suffered a great loss of vitality. Through these few years of recuperation and rest, coupled with expending countless spirit medicines, I barely managed to recover some life.”

The young man smiled and said, “Therefore, aren’t I here?”

The old man shook his head and said smilingly, “Some vitality can be recovered in a thousand years. So you don’t need to make this trip.”

The young man said, “Junior received Senior’s great kindness. Coming here this time, it’s in order to treat Senior’s ailment once and for all.”

The old man could not help being shocked when he heard that and said in surprise, “Could it be that ... you’ve already touched that threshold?”

The young man smiled slightly as he nodded. When the old man saw the situation, he was wildly ecstatic.

These elderly man and youth were precisely Extreme Light Imperial City’s Profound Secrets Pavilion’s Pavilion Lord, Jian Hongxiao, and Ye Yuan.

After the Deathsoul Gate’s storm, Ye Yuan laid down many contingency plans in Heavenly Eagle, but the Deathsoul Gate did not have any stirrings.

These days, Ye Yuan felt that he already reached the bottleneck and was going to break through to rank six very soon, so he thought of coming to find Jian Hongxiao.

The sixth level cultivation method of Ye Yuan’s Chaos Heavenspan Canon was going to be deduced completely very soon.

Once it was deduced entirely, Ye Yuan would be able to step into the next major realm.

Hence, after Ye Yuan made the arrangements for Heavenly Eagle’s affairs, he hurried over to Extreme Light Imperial City.

Seeing Jian Hongxiao again, Ye Yuan did not have that deep as an ocean feeling like last time anymore.

The present Ye Yuan, his fleshy body already broke through to rank six. His strength could even overpower Second Firmament True Gods.

He could tell with one glance that Jian Hongxiao was at the True God Realm before suffering Heavenly Dao’s backlash.

“Heh, these words are also a little too overbearingly haughty, right? How many Ninth Firmament Celestial Deities spend several tens of thousands of years when stuck before True God Realm? Even if your talent is outstanding, without several decades or several centuries, it’s also hard to break through, right?” Jian Chen said with disdain.

Ever since seeing Ye Yuan, Jian Chen’s expression was extremely complicated.

Back then, when Ye Yuan arrived at Extreme Light Imperial City, he was merely an initial-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouse.

His master wasting his essence to divine for Ye Yuan, he was rather contemptuous in his heart, feeling that Master’s decision was not worth it at all.

Jian Hongxiao’s longevity suffered a great loss and already did not have much time to live.

The lost essence was easy to make up for, but the lost longevity was hard to make up for again. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was just that he did not expect that Ye Yuan only used a short few hundred years and already reached Ninth Firmament True God, already caught up to him in terms of cultivation realm.

Jian Chen felt another distinct emotion in his heart.

Hearing this, Ye Yuan just smiled and did not speak. Jian Hongxiao looked at Jian Chen with a meaningful glance and said with a smile, “Chen-er, your visual prowess isn’t there yet! Little Friend Ye’s splendor is converged within, skin like congealed fat1, his looks changing drastically. He already cultivated to the sixth transformation golden body. Hence, that’s why Master called him a member of my generation.”

When Jian Chen heard that, his pupils constricted!

But Jian Hongxiao’s following words made him even more incredibly shocked.

Jian Hongxiao looked toward Ye Yuan, as he said, “Furthermore ... Little Friend Ye’s situation is very alike the legendary perfect sixth transformation golden body. Wonder if this old man guessed correctly?”

Ye Yuan also had an astonished look from what Jian Hongxiao said and immediately smiled bitterly and said, “Senior really has good eyesight. You hit it right on the mark!”

Jian Hongxiao had a smug look, stroked his beard, and smiled as he said, “Huhu, this old man has been training this pair of eyes all my life. Although I can’t deduce your destiny, some things can’t be hidden.”

Ye Yuan also clicked his tongue in wonder when he heard that and said with cupped fists, “Senior has arcane sight, Ye Yuan admires.”

Jian Chen was long shocked until he could not speak by the side.

A perfect sixth transformation golden body, that was a legendary existence among body cultivating martial artists, its strength being extremely formidable.

He did not expect that it actually appeared on Ye Yuan.

What he never thought was that Ye Yuan actually stepped into rank six so quickly.

Having a perfect sixth transformation golden body, that was a genuine rank six powerhouse!

He had been stuck at Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity for God knows how many years already, but he was unable to touch that bottleneck from start to finish.

In contrast, his disparity with Ye Yuan was too great!

“Humph! So what if it’s perfect sixth transformation golden body? Putting aside that he hasn’t broken through to the True God Realm yet, even if he really broke through, how can he refine the Six Veins Stellar Pill within a short time? And how can Master’s torment of backlash be dispelled?” Jian Chen said with a cold snort.

Jian Hongxiao’s brows furrowed, and he berated, “Insolence! Chen-er, in the martial arts world, strength reigns supreme. Since Ye Yuan is already a member of my generation, how can it be your turn to be so insolent?”

But Ye Yuan’s brows raised up when he heard that and waved his hand and said, “Nothing serious. Brother Jian Chen is older than me in the first place. Furthermore, he’s already worried about Senior’s body. Huhu, moreover ... he’ll also be a member of our generation before long.”

As he said, Ye Yuan fished out a small medicinal bottle and passed it to Jian Chen, saying with a smile, “Brother Jian Chen, this is the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill that this Ye refined. Please kindly accept it. This Ye received Senior’s great kindness and has nothing to it repay with. This medicinal pill, just take it as a bit of interest.”

With the Myriad Treasure Tower as his backer, Ye Yuan naturally did not lack spirit medicines now. Refining another few Sun Moon Azure Sky Pills was naturally not difficult.

It was just that even so, the Sun Moon Azure Sky Pills on Ye Yuan were not many either. After all, this level of spirit medicines, the Myriad Treasure Tower also could not possibly supply endlessly.

As for Jian Hongxiao, Ye Yuan was very grateful in his heart. If not for him making strenuous efforts to deduce White Light’s whereabouts, he would probably harbor a grievance all his life.

Ye Yuan could naturally tell that Jian Chen was the disciple that Jian Hongxiao valued the most.

This Jian Chen was clearly stuck at Celestial Deity Realm for many years and had been unable to break through all along, that was why resentment was born in his heart.

Hence, that was why Ye Yuan would give him such a precious medicinal pill.

When Jian Hongxiao master and disciple heard this, they immediately had blank faces.

Jian Chen received the medicinal bottle somewhat woodenly and instinctively sunk a wisp of divine sense to examine, his entire person immediately turning into stone.

“V-Vast spirit divine-grade! I ... Did I see wrongly?”

When Jian Chen spoke, even his tongue wasn’t straight anymore.

He sunk a wisp of divine-grade to examine once more, the result obtained was still vast spirit divine-grade!

A vast spirit divine pill, he had never seen before in this life, let alone talk about a vast spirit divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill!

At this very moment, his whole mind went blank, completely did not know what he was thinking about.

He only knew that he seemed to have hit the jackpot!

Hearing Jian Chen’s words, even if Jian Hongxiao was very knowledgeable and experienced, his mouth did not close for a long time.

“L-Little Friend Ye, this ... this medicinal pill is too precious. Jian Chen can’t accept it!”

When Jian Chen heard that, his entire body could not help trembling. His face was full of unwillingness to let go, but the small medicinal bottle in his hand was gripped even tighter.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said smilingly, “Senior doesn’t have to be like this. This Ye Yuan’s eyes, a thousand, even ten thousand vast spirit divine pills are also not as important as a brother’s life! Brother Jian Chen needs this right now, so let him accept it. Additionally, the Six Veins Stellar Pill that Brother Jian Chen mentioned just now, what medicinal pill is it?”
