Chapter 1621 Robbing the Rich and Helping the Poor

gao yuan’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “what do you mean?”toward gao yuan’s killing intent, ye yuan was completely indifferent. he just said coolly, “old man gao, you really think that this little lord has a good temper, right? originally, it wasn’t so troublesome, but you insisted on fanning fire here, using so-called human race’s righteous cause to come and pressure me. it’s clearly you who covets the precious treasure, but then you insist on feigning a righteous and awe-inspiring appearance. do you really take me to be a three-year-old kid? trying to repulse me, right? this is the outcome of disgusting me!”

the scene was silent, everyone all looked at ye yuan in amazement.

to dare speak to a half-step celestial deity realm powerhouse like this, ye yuan was probably one of a kind.

one had to know, even though half-step celestial deities were not genuine celestial deity powerhouses, once he took this step, that was an existence who looked down upon the world.

therefore, that was why those people wanted to suck up to gao yuan and squeeze ye yuan.

gao yuan’s chest was like a puffing bellow, furious until he puffed heavily.

his expression was incredibly grim, icy-cold to the extreme as he said in a chilly voice, “do you really think that i don’t dare to touch you?”

the aura of a half-step celestial deity releasing, the powerful pressure enveloped everyone once again.

but ye yuan was not the least bit afraid and said nonchalantly, “you’re the one who doesn’t dare! so many people are waiting for me to bring them down. if you kill me, you’ll be the human race’s common enemy!”

gao yuan choked when he heard it. the imposing momentum that had just condensed immediately vanished without a trace.

this punk ... actually completely turned the situation around unknowingly!

now, this kid actually used this reason to come and threaten him.

and he could not seem to find a reason to retaliate!

monstrous waves stirred in the heart of the zheng qi at one side.

ye yuan this brat, not only was his talent exceedingly terrifying, his means were actually so superb too.

originally, a single misstep, heavenly eagle imperial city and him would be dragged into the water.

but in a twinkle, the situation was reversed by ye yuan.

now, ye yuan reverse-checkmated him. gao yuan could only be a mute eating a dose of bitter medicine; suffering humiliation in silence.

but seeing gao yuan slumping, zheng qi was really endlessly refreshed in his heart.

gao yuan was livid, he wished to tear ye yuan with his hands.

but what ye yuan said was right, he really did not dare!

gao yuan gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “state the price then!”

he really did not expect that he was actually forced until he was at a complete loss on what to do by a brat still wet behind his ears.

ye yuan smiled and said, “make it a bit cheaper for you, one divine lord mystic treasure for two people!”

gao yuan’s eyes became wide-saucers and he roared, “what did you say? to think that you can say it out! do you think that divine lord mystic treasures are common wares?”

everyone behind ye yuan looked at each other speechlessly, full of shock.

this elder ye was really demanding an exorbitant price!

ye yuan shrugged and said, “you, a half-step celestial deity realm powerhouse, could you not have a few articles of divine lord mystic treasures that you have no use for on you? using them to exchange for a lucky chance for utmost peace imperial city’s young generation, it’s all too worthwhile. or is it that you’re selfish until you aren’t willing to contribute to utmost peace imperial city?”

gao yuan was angry until he billowed his beard and glared, but he was powerless to do anything.

this brat was really sharp-tongued!

i have divine lord mystic treasures, but why should i give them to you for no reason?

“brat, to dare ask for this old man’s things, be careful it stuffs you to bursting and kills you!” gao yuan said viciously.

“huhu, this little lord’s appetite is ferocious. don’t need you to worry about it. hurry up, don’t dawdle. everyone is waiting to go down!” ye yuan said coolly.

gao yuan was like squeezing out toothpaste, taking out three divine lord mystic treasures, and said in a cold voice, “brat, eating this old man’s stuff, you’ll ultimately have to spit it out!”

ye yuan received the divine lord mystic treasures, directly threw a sword of ning tianping, and said coolly, “you don’t have a divine lord mystic treasure yet, right? this sword will be given to you. uh, which of you still don’t have divine lord mystic treasures?”

ning tianping as a martial tower protector and ye yuan’s follower naturally came along too.

he received the long sword, extremely excited in his heart.

even though the ning family was heavenly eagle imperial city’s major family, it was impossible to have a divine lord mystic treasure in everyone’s hands.

only gao yuan, this kind of old undying fellow, a person who went to no idea how many mystic realms, did how many schemes, could have so many divine lord mystic treasures on him.

even though ning tianping was already almost third-layered heaven divine lord, he really did not have a divine lord mystic treasure in possession.

now that he had a divine lord mystic treasure, he was confident that defeating third-layered heaven divine lord powerhouses should be nothing difficult.

even when encountering fourth-layered heaven divine lord, he had the power to have a battle too!

ning tianping bowed and said, “many thanks, elder ye!”

ye yuan smiled and said, “you followed me, so i’ll have to give you some benefits.”

very soon, ye yuan also distributed the other two divine lord mystic treasures, agitating the people who obtained them badly.

the heavenly eagle imperial city’s side was extremely excited. because counting according to the number of people, the opposite side had to at least take out two divine lord mystic treasures to be able to bring everyone away.

quite a number of people came from utmost peace imperial city this time. adding them up, there were close to 20 people.

counting gao yuan, there were four people above seventh-layered heaven divine lord. if each of them brought two to three people along, there were still around ten people.

if they wanted all to go down, they had to use divine lord mystic treasures.

gao yuan gritted his teeth and said, “mo hui, zhu yuncai, each of you take out another divine lord mystic treasure!”

this mo hui and zhu yuncai were both eighth-layered heaven divine lord powerhouses. hearing gao yuan’s words at this time, their hearts were dripping blood.

you caused trouble, now, you want us to wipe your backside for you!

but facing gao yuan, they dared to get angry but did not dare to speak. they could only each take out a divine lord mystic treasure.

after ye yuan got them, he immediately distributed them.

with this, heavenly eagle imperial city’s side’s strength increased greatly.

zheng qi said, “ye yuan, so many divine lord mystic treasures, why didn’t you keep one for yourself?”

ye yuan said with a smile, “does head elder feel that i’m someone who lacks divine lord mystic treasures?”

“uh ...” zheng qi could not help being stunned when he heard it.

the current ye yuan was just like a nouveau riche, exuding the aura of a tycoon from head to toe.

these were five divine lord mystic treasures, he gave them away without blinking just like this.

when gao yuan saw this scene, he was even more livid with rage, almost spewing out a mouthful of old blood.

you don’t lack divine lord mystic treasures, then what did you scam me for?!

ye yuan seemed to have seen through his thoughts and said with a smile, “i just feel that a powerhouse like old man gao should sympathize with bottom-level martial artists a little. either way, he can’t use these things. so why not take them out and let everybody increase their strength. this way, our human race’s collective strength will also rise significantly, don’t you say so? even though i don’t find old man gao pleasing to the eye, he’s considered to have contributed to the human race with this. if anybody gets a lucky chance, you have to remember that he was good to you.”

“puhwark!”

gao yuan finally had anger attack his heart, spewing out a mouthful of old blood.

this punk was simply terrible! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“goodness, my head elder gao, you have to take it easy. you’re our human race’s heavyweight figure, an existence who might step into celestial deity realm. if something were to happen, what would we do?” ye yuan hurriedly said.

zheng qi hearing ye yuan’s comical concern, laughed until he could not close his mouth at one side.

in these several tens of thousands of years, he really had not laughed so happily like today.

“alright, it’s getting late, don’t let the fiend race take the initiative. we have to go down. in a while, when i use spatial laws, none of you resist. otherwise, if you get lost in space, don’t blame me,” ye yuan said.
