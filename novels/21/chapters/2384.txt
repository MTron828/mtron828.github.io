Chapter 2390: Heavenly Hidden World

When the words stopped, everyone was shocked!

This one year of preaching was undoubtedly a gluttonous feast to the people of the Alchemy Hall.

Everyone was immersed in it, unable to extricate themselves.

When Ye Yuan finished talking, they were still dissatisfied.

Witchcloud’s reaction at this time was virtually the same as Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s reaction back then.

Their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan already became different.

Previously, they were still worried that Ye Yuan was here to steal the limelight.

But at this time, they felt that there was already no need.

This person did not need to snatch the limelight at all.

This was a complete cultivation system. This was a Great Dao that led to the heavens!

Listening entirely to Ye Yuan preaching on the Dao until the end, they also finally understood what he meant by having an unstable foundation.

“Listening to Master Ji talk, Witchcloud feels enlightened all at once! Master Ji is high above. Please accept a bow from Witchcloud!”

As he said, Witchcloud bowed deeply toward Ye Yuan.

Everyone was incredibly shocked!

“This ... This ... Lord Witchcloud is actually treating Chief Instructor with the etiquette of a disciple!”

“Master Ji can afford it! Just this preaching, Lord Witchcloud’s title of number one person in the world is about to change hands!”

“Master Ji wasn’t the slightest bit stingy, demonstrating Great Dao to us. He can bear this solemn bow! Let’s bow too!”

... ...

After the shock, everyone woke up.

Rank three source powerhouses took the lead to bow first. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The rest also bowed down one after another.

Ye Yuan hurriedly helped Witchcloud up and said, “Senior Witchcloud is killing me. Senior exhausted your mind and body for the human race. I can’t accept this bow.”

Witchcloud said firmly, “Just based on this Dao preaching, you can bear it! Master Ji, you don’t have to refuse, in the future, this old man will address you as Master Ji!”

Ye Yuan was helpless and could only say: “Fine then, that’s also up to you. I’ll leave behind inheritances in the Alchemy Hal. What you don’t understand, everyone can come and ask me. But this Alchemy Hall still needs Senior Witchcloud to give a lot of care.”

Witchcloud hurriedly said, “This is within this old man’s duty to begin with. Where’s the talk of giving a lot of care?”

... ...

“There’s actually such a thing? This kid actually has such high attainments in Alchemy Dao?”

Hearing that Witchcloud actually addressed him as ‘Master Ji’, Jian Rufeng was shocked until he was dumbstruck with amazement.

Before this, Ye Yuan did not reveal anything to him.

When Ye Yuan went to the Alchemy Hall, he also found it quite strange at that time.

His thinking was the same as the rest, also thinking that Ye Yuan went to suppress Witchcloud and establish his prestige.

Regarding this action of Ye Yuan, he did not say anything, but he felt somewhat disdainful in his heart.

This kind of action was still a little too childish.

He even doubted a little, whether he made a wrong decision or not, and used the wrong person.

But hearing Witchcloud’s words at this time was no less than a clap of thunder exploding.

He and Witchcloud were life-and-death buddies. So he naturally knew his alchemy path strength, and also knew how highly he regarded himself in alchemy.

But he actually carried out the etiquette of a disciple toward Ye Yuan!

He originally invited Ye Yuan back, hoping that Ye Yuan would leave behind the legacies of the few great laws.

But who knew that there was actually still such an unexpected harvest.

Witchcloud nodded and said, “I can’t use having high attainments to describe anymore already! If anyone in this world can reach the realm of rules, it’s undoubtedly him for sure! This old man is inferior to him! Far, far inferior!”

Jian Rufeng was shocked for a while before he slowly said, “Looks like, really picked up a treasure! With him, our plan can be started in advance!”

Witchcloud’s face changed and he said with a frown, “So fast? You ...”

Jian Rufeng waved his hand and said smilingly, “Old Friend, why is there a need to be like this? There will come this day, you don’t need to be sad. Moreover, I also won’t die right away after entering the Heavenly Hidden World. The growth of geniuses requires the accumulation of time, and time waits for no man! Furthermore, the burden on you, old friend, is even heavier than mine! Dead, dead, death squares all accounts. I won’t know anything anymore after dying. But the ones who are alive will carry heavier burdens!”

Hence, an extremely huge project was carried out in secret just like that.

This project looked simple but was actually complicated to the extreme.

One had to know, the Sentry Celestial Palaces monitored the world. They knew about the various sects’ affairs like the back of their hand.

Wanting to move these geniuses into the Heavenly Hidden World, it needed to hide from their eyes and ears, and could not reveal any clues or inkling.

Once their suspicions were aroused, it would all fail just one step short of success.

Fortunately, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets had long already made perfect preparations. Implementing them now, things were done systematically.

In the entire Heavenspan World, the myriad races’ geniuses were moved into the Heavenly Hidden World batch after batch.

This was a colossal project. It was naturally impossible to be accomplished overnight.

This process would likely last for a thousand years.

Ye Yuan was the first batch to enter the Heavenly Hidden World.

He did not enter with the identity of a genius but entered with the identity of a chief instructor.

Of course, there was also the first batch of geniuses who entered together with him.

They were all selected by Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets. Each person’s potential was tremendous.

They were the unpredictable children!

However, the first batch of unpredictable children who entered were not many. There were just 100 thousand people or so.

The geniuses subsequently were still entering one after another.

Of course, Jian Rufeng, Witchcloud, and the rest, they all established a complete advancement system.

These geniuses would undergo the cruelest competition.

On this day, several young people gathered together, seemingly discussing something.

A young man wearing a silk headdress on his head said, “Did you guys hear? Our chief instructor is actually just a Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor!”

Another genius could not help laughing as he said, “Shang Hang, what nonsense are you talking about? How can a Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor possibly be our chief instructor? His strength is likely not even our match!”

This young man who was wearing a silk headdress on his head was precisely the Grand Ancestor Spacetime whose fame shook the world later on, Shang Hang!

Shang Hang shook his head and said, “I’m not talking nonsense! You guys know that Qin Chao, right?”

Another person said disdainfully, “Of course we know! It’s said that he has connections. He’s that chief instructor’s personal disciple, and he has already been designated as a core legacy disciple!”

Shang Hang nodded and said, “The news came from him, it won’t be wrong!”

“No way, right? Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor, this is also too much of a joke! We entered the Heavenly Hidden World for the human race’s future! But those lords upstairs actually used a Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor to hoodwink us?! This is truly preposterous!” The moment another genius heard, he immediately exploded.

“Yeah! It’s been two years. That guy never even showed his face. It’s really outrageous!”

“What are the heads of those people upstairs used for? Can’t they see it?”

Shang Hang smiled coldly and said, “Ever since this chief instructor entered the Heavenly Hidden World, he has been in closed-seclusion in Inquire Heavenly Palace. No idea what he’s trying to do either. He doesn’t take us to heart at all. The few of you, you dare to rush into the Inquire Heavenly Palace with me or not?”

The moment the few people heard, their faces immediately changed drastically.

Entering the Inquire Heavenly Palace was a major crime!

The few of them could not resist backing out.

Shang Hang sneered and said, “What? Like this and you’re scared? Facing the divine race in the future will be ten thousand times more dangerous than this! You guys don’t even have this bit of courage, and yet you all are talking about killing divine race for what?”
