Chapter 1985: Killing to Establish Awe

The whole place was silent. Zuo Mo’s side was even silent like cicadas in winter.

Ye Yuan’s combat power far exceeded their imaginations.

That sword move earlier might not be able to deal with Fifth Firmament True God powerhouses, but it was absolutely enough to one-shot Fourth Firmament True Gods.

Who among them was Ye Yuan’s match?

“This ... Brother Ye, it’s a misunderstanding. This is all a misunderstanding,” Feng Xiaotian said with an awkward look.

“Yeah, yeah! All a misunderstanding!”

“Brother Ye is magnanimous! Don’t haggle over it with the likes of us.”

...

With Feng Xiaotian taking the lead, the others also followed suit and apologized.

They were all frightened silly by this sword move executed by Ye Yuan. So how could they still dare to oppose Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan swept a glance over everyone and said with a cold smile, “Misunderstanding? Is it also a misunderstanding that you guys wanted to kill Song Yu?”

Feng Xiaotian had an awkward look as he said, “This ... This is also Zuo Mo. It was him that detested the sight of Brother Ye, so he deliberately led us astray!”

Zuo Mo’s face changed and he said angrily, “Feng Xiaotian, you!”

Feng Xiaotian sneered and said, “I told you long ago, don’t oppose Brother Ye. His talent isn’t what you can compare to at all!”

“Puhwark!”

Zuo Mo was angered by Feng Xiaotian, spurting out another large mouthful of blood.

Ye Yuan was amused when he heard this. He then said with a smile, “So that’s how it is. Then you kill Zuo Mo now and I’ll forgive you.”

Feng Xiaotian was first taken aback, then immediately, his eyes revealed a hint of viciousness. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Okay!”

Zuo Mo’s face changed and he said furiously, “Feng Xiaotian, you dare!”

Feng Xiaotian smiled coldly and said, “Sorry about it, Brother Zuo! Want to blame, blame that you shouldn’t have offended Brother Ye.”

Whoosh!

A streak of swift and fierce sword light arrived in an instant. The current Zuo Mo was severely wounded, so how could he block this swift and fierce sword?

Just one sword and Zuo Mo’s head was decapitated, dead until he could not be any more dead.

A peerless genius who possessed an emperor surmounting aura fell just like that.

When Song Yu saw this scene, he also felt satisfied in his heart.

Just now, when Zuo Mo unleashed the Grand Blazing Sun, he really thought that he was dead for sure.

Although Ye Yuan made a move and saved him in the end, that kind of despair in the face of impending death still made anger rise from his heart.

He was somewhat uncertain why Ye Yuan did not take action himself but wanted to make somebody else do the work.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, even killing Feng Xiaotian was also merely thus.

How could he know that Ye Yuan could not unleash a second sword at all currently?

Earlier, before Ye Yuan returned, he already swallowed quite a few divine essence recovery medicinal pills, and he was currently frenziedly recovering strength.

One had to admit, this Qinghong Battle Armor still had a benefit, that was being able to conceal his actual situation.

His divine essence was currently depleted, but others could not tell at all.

The reason why he did so was merely buying time.

But Song Yu was long already dead set on Ye Yuan now. Although he was doubtful in his heart, he did not say it out loud.

Killing Zuo Mo with a sword, Feng Xiaotian said with a fawning smile, “Wonder if Brother Ye is satisfied?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “At least you have sincerity. This matter is considered dropped.”

Feng Xiaotian’s heart eased up and he said, “Brother Ye, this emperor bone can actually summon so many powerful bone devils. What should we do?”

Ye Yuan shut his eyes and said coolly, “Wait!”

“Wait?” Feng Xiaotian was uncertain.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said, “The ones coveting this emperor likely aren’t just the few of us. Wait for the others to come over and rendezvous, we’ll charge over together. As for who can get the emperor bone, that will depend on their own means.”

Regarding this, Feng Xiaotian naturally did not dare to say a word more. He could only laugh dryly twice and retreat to one side.

Indeed as Ye Yuan expected, in this following half a month, quite a few people arrived at the Bone Devil Ridge in succession again.

Song Yu discovered to his surprise that the ones who obtained lucky chances were not just their party alone.

There were plenty of people who broke through to be Fourth Firmament True Gods.

There was even someone whose strength had already reached the peak Fourth Firmament True God Realm, being only a step away from becoming a Fifth Firmament True God.

Although some people’s strength did not increase too much, they likely obtained quite a few powerful treasures too. Otherwise, they also would not dare to easily step foot into Bone Devil Ridge.

The lucky chances left behind in this Ancient God Battlefield were seriously too many.

Of course, the squads that came out first already became incomparably scattered now.

There was no need to ask around; those weak ones were now likely already became part of the Ancient God Battlefield forever.

Even Zuo Mo this emperor surmounting aura powerhouse died, let alone these imperial auras?

After having learned about the situation here, those powerhouses all stopped.

At this time, it was clearly the time to band up together.

Only with everyone pooling their efforts and being of one mind could they pass through this bone devil army.

Of course, there were people who felt that this was exaggerating things to raise an alarm. They did not believe that the situation was quite dire.

The result ... was naturally being torn to pieces by the horrifying bone devil army.

After a month, the powerhouses that gathered here were roughly 50 to 60 people already.

These 50 to 60 people, their strengths were no idea how many times stronger compared to during the past before they entered this battlefield.

At this time, a young man in azure robes came to the center of everyone and said in a clear voice, “In my view, the people who want to compete for the emperor bone should be pretty much all here. With our strength, it should be sufficient to break through the bone devil army. Why not everyone give it an attempt together now; how about it?”

This azure-robed young man was precisely that peak Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse, called Zhou Yu

His original strength was not conspicuous among the group of geniuses.

But just several months’ time had passed, and he was already standing at the summit.

Zhou Yu’s tone had some high and mighty flavor, clearly putting himself on the seat of this group of people’s leader.

“Heh, you say go and we go? This young master, I, still want to go after a few days, can’t I? Stop putting up a front here. Who the hell do you think you are?” At this time, a very disdainful voice sounded out, not giving Zhou Yu face at all.

One sentence attracted everyone’s gazes.

A good show came!

This person who replied was called Li Xin. He was also a Fourth Firmament True God.

Toward Zhou Yu’s attitude, he was clearly very displeased.

The moment Zhou Yu heard this, he laughed.

Swoosh!

His figure suddenly moved, with his speed being swift to the extreme.

At the same time, the sound of tearing through the air arrived with a howl.

For Li Xin to dare retort, he was clearly prepared, immediately raising his sword to meet the enemy.

Bang!

A huge bang came over, Li Xin’s sword broke with a clank.

And his head was also directly smashed into pulp like a watermelon.

Everyone was silent like cicadas in winter!

“That rod is an empyrean spirit treasure!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Not only that, but his strength is also so formidable!”

“Looks like the lucky chance this Zhou Yu obtained really isn’t small!”

...

All around, there was a series of exclamations. Clearly, they were surprised by this swift and fierce rod.

That Li Xin’s strength naturally went without saying. Being a Fourth Firmament True God already indicated he will be a problematic opponent.

But under Zhou Yu’s rod, he actually did not even withstand one move!

Ye Yuan kept on watching this scene quietly. Seeing this rod, his gaze turned slightly austere.

This Zhou Yu’s strength was very strong!

Zhou Yu put away the stick and stood upright, saying coolly, “Who else has objections?”

Who else would have objections still?

Everyone stood up one after another and gathered together. Clearly, they were preparing to rush the bone devil army.

In reality, the people that came these few days got lesser and lesser. It could be assumed that there would be less and lesser people coming if they wait around.

Continuing to wait was simply wasting time.
