Chapter 1723 Pavilion Lord Appears

Cries of exclamations came from the grandstands. The two people separated upon contact.

When he appeared again, Ye Yuan was already at Mo Fei there.

Jiang Nan retreated several steps in a row. It was as if this sword was unleashed against him.

“S-So strong! Xiahou Yun ... died under this sword? Then Mo Fei ...”

Jiang Nan broke out in cold sweat, incomparably rejoicing in his heart that luckily, he did not test the sword himself.

Otherwise ... the consequences were too ghastly to imagine!

Even though this sword was not directed at Jiang Nan, he felt like it was.

If it were him, he would not be much better than Mo Fei.

No wonder Xiahou Yun died under Ye Yuan’s sword.

Ye Yuan put away the Junyi Sword, slowly turned around, and said coolly, “Done.”

Mo Fei seemed to have had a paralyzing hex cast on him. Hearing Ye Yuan’s word, Mo Fei’s soul finally came back.

It was only to see his pupils constricted as if he saw some horrifying thing, gasping heavily for air. The sweat on his body was like he was dragged out of the water.

“T-Thank you for showing mercy!” Mo Fei panted and said.

At this time, Mo Fei seemed to have made a trip to and back from the gates of hell.

He knew that if not for Ye Yuan showing mercy, his outcome would be the same as Xiahou Yun’s.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “You and I have no grievances, so what would I kill you for?”

“I ... I lost!” Mo Fei directly admitted defeat.

Jiang Nan could not help being a little surprised that Mo Fei did not die.

He even thought that Mo Fei was already killed.

That sword just now was too bizarre. He could not see the reality of it at all.

The sword move that merged spatial law and Sword Dao law was too horrifying.

“Someone as strong as Mo Fei is actually without the slightest strength to retaliate in front of him!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“No wonder Jiang Nan directly admitted defeat. Looks like ... he knew that he was not Ye Yuan’s match!”

“I really didn’t expect that the champion of the Hundred Battles Arena this time, is actually a Third Firmament Divine Lord! It’s still the first time in history, right?”

“I’m really somewhat curious now, just what color is this Ye Yuan’s destiny?”

...

On the grandstands, cries of exclamations linked up.

Before this Hundred Battles Arena, no one could have thought that the final winner would actually be a Third Firmament Divine Lord.

The judge looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly and announced, “This season’s Hundred Battles Arena, the winner is ... Ye Yuan! Now, the final eight all step up to the ring!”

The other six people were uncertain what it meant but still went up the ring.

Suddenly, a cluster of powerful auras emerged from the void, immediately causing a stir.

Seven powerful figures stepped out, they were actually all Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses!

Even Ye Yuan’s countenance changed slightly too.

Seven Celestial Deity powerhouses appearing together, this commotion was truly astonishing.

More importantly, among these seven great celestial deities, each person’s strength was not inferior to Jiang Jadehall’s. Ye Yuan could not see through them at all.

One had to know, Jiang Jadehall was a Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse!

This was Extreme Light Imperial City’s strength!

Similar to an imperial city, a casual grand elder from Extreme Light Imperial City coming out could easily destroy Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

However, this was not over yet.

After the seven people, another figure stepped out of the void.

Ever since after those seven great Celestial Deity powerhouses retreated behind the old man, they bowed slightly to show respect.

On the grandstands, a clever person immediately reacted.

“That’s ... That’s Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord, Jian Hongxiao!”

“My God! The Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord is mysterious and unfathomable. No one has ever seen his true face before. I didn’t expect that this time, he actually appeared!”

“Tsk tsk, looks like Extreme Light Imperial City attaches great importance to the Hundred Battles Arena this time! Really very curious just what kind of destiny that Ye Yuan has!”

...

Below was seething with excitement. Even the geniuses on the stage all felt honored seeing Jian Hongxiao’s appearance.

They came here to compete in martial arts from afar, even risking their lives, wasn’t it for the sake of getting Jian Hongxiao’s guidance?

This was a godlike figure!

The young geniuses that he gave guidance to all became an overlord of a region.

The talk of destiny was fleeting and ephemeral. Even though they all used the aura viewing art, different cultivation, different understanding of Dao, the things seen were completely different.

Similarly seeing seven colors, but this aura viewing art was clearly not what seven colors could summarize.

Just like Jian Ping, he could only see a blurry color when he looked at Xiahou Yun. But if it were his master, Jian Shaoning, looking, he would be able to see the divination contained within the color.

If it was Jian Hongxiao, it would be another scenery.

The stronger the strength, the clearer the divination seen. The guidance given would naturally be greatly different.

These grand elders’ strength had long mastered the profound already. But compared to Jian Hongxiao, it was more than a level inferior.

Therefore, each time the Hundred Battles Arena was hosted, these geniuses still came without hesitation even though they knew that this trip was dangerous.

But Ye Yuan did not have much reaction towards this.

Because he knew that his life path, even Jian Hongxiao could not discern it too.

Moreover, he had already seen Jian Hongxiao. Jian Hongxiao was also not that mysterious in front of him anymore.

The current Jian Hongxiao looked just like an amiable grandfather and did not have much air.

Different from the powerful pressure emitting off the other grand elders’ bodies, the feeling that he gave people was somewhat vague and mysterious, extremely profound.

Perhaps, this was the difference in realm.

Jian Hongxiao’s face carried a faint smile as he said, “The Hundred Battles Arena this time seems to have produced quite a number of prodigious figures! Not bad, not bad, among these final eight, there’s actually a purple destiny, and two blue destiny. Looks like a great era is coming!”

“What? There’s actually a purple destiny?! Who is it?”

“You fool, who else can the purple destiny be still? Of course it’s that Ye Yuan!”

“Goodness gracious, truly remarkable! Purple destiny, if lucky, that’s an existence who can achieve the Celestial Deity Realm!”

...

Jian Hongxiao’s words immediately caused an uproar.

With him speaking, naturally no one would doubt it.

Jian Hongxiao smiled slightly and said, “The few of you, don’t employ the aura viewing art, your eyes will go blind!”

These words were clearly said to the seven great Celestial Deity powerhouses behind him.

Hearing Jian Hongxiao’s words, everyone naturally became curious and wanted to use the aura viewing art, but was immediately frightened by Jian Hongxiao’s words.

Below, everyone was extremely puzzled.

Using the aura viewing art could blind the eyes?

This ... was simply unheard of!

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “Everyone must be very curious why this old man will show up this time.”

Hearing this, everyone all nodded their heads.

Indeed, normally after the Hundred Battles Arena ended, it was all the grand elders coming out to summarize it. Jian Hongxiao would never show up.

But this time, he made an exception.

Jian Hongxiao continued and said, “This old man showing up this time is to announce two things. Everyone must think that Ye Yuan has purple destiny. Actually, it isn’t him. The one who has the purple destiny is that young man called Ning Tianping. As for the two blue destinies, it’s Jiang Nan and Mo Fei.”
