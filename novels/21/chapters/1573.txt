Chapter 1577 Sundering Heavenly Dao!

Looking at Heavenly Sin’s crazy-like behavior, everyone’s faces revealed strange looks.

Was this Heavenly Sin Heretic God in front of them really that one who nearly killed them just now?

What the hell did Ye Yuan do, to actually let a controller lose control of Heavenly Dao?

“What did Ye Yuan say just now? Heavenly Dao ... dares not answer?” Fang Tian said somewhat uncertainly.

He somewhat doubted whether or not he heard wrongly, hence, he asked the Skydistant beside him.

Skydistant glanced at him and said full of shock, “Could his meaning be that Heavenly Dao was frightened away by him? And he really didn’t do anything?”

“Heavenly Dao ... can be frightened away too? What ... What on earth is it afraid of?” Fang Tian felt like his brain was somewhat unable to keep up.

Skydistant drew a deep breath, his gaze deep as he said, “Looks like not seeing him for 100 years, Ye Yuan’s realm is already not what you and I can imagine!”

Everyone was incomparably shocked in their hearts. Before going out, Ye Yuan was just a Heavenly Dao controller. But returning this time, even Heavenly Dao actually trembled.

An emotion called despair crept out in Heavenly Sin’s heart.

He experienced 300 thousand years before producing a trace of enlightenment, obtaining Heavenly Dao’s recognition.

But now, what the hell was this?

It was just over a month after he came out of seclusion!

Over 300 thousand years of humiliation, he had not begun to take revenge on this world and it already ended?

Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he said with a cold smile, “If I can’t control Heavenly Dao, I don’t believe that you can as well! Humph! Even if I don’t control Heavenly Dao, my realm still crushes you!”

When people despair, it would always be easy to find all sorts of excuses for themselves.

Heavenly Sin was naturally unwilling to be trampled underfoot by Ye Yuan, so he kept on finding excuses in his heart.

Perhaps, Heavenly Dao was just temporarily unable to be controlled!

Similarly, as a controller, there was no reason that he could not but Ye Yuan could!

Heavenly Sin’s aura of grand completion Origin Deity emitted out, the commotion was similarly incomparably outrageous.

His strength could virtually rival Kanuo’s already.

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Sin with pity and said indifferently, “Ignorance is truly terrifying. You can’t, doesn’t mean that I can’t!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan raised his palm and pressed down.

An enormous palm reached out of the void and slapped onto Heavenly Sin’s body with a momentum like a sudden peal of thunder which left no time for covering ears.

Heavenly Sin spurted fresh blood wildly, his figure flying out backward.

The might of Heavenly Dao!

Ye Yuan did not deal a heavy blow. This palm broke bones and injured the ligaments, but absolutely would not take his life.

Before he returned, he never dreamed that this Immortal Grove Region actually still had someone who dared to provoke him like this.

Very good, he was very successful!

Ye Yuan was very angry and the consequences were very severe!

He calmly looked at the Heavenly Sin spurting fresh blood wildly and said, “You understand heaven better than me? Who gave you the courage to say this sort of words in front of me?”

Boom!

Another palm protruded out of the void and smacked Heavenly Sin silly like smacking a fly.

He had not recovered when a large foot already trampled on his face, directly trampling him onto the ground from the air.

Boom!

Another loud bang, a 100 thousand foot pit was smashed out on the surface of the ground.

Heavenly Sin’s face was practically flattened by Ye Yuan.

“Posturing in front of me, no problem! At most, I’ll beat you up and it will be over. But you dared to touch my woman, Ye Yuan’s woman, and dared to humiliate my own race, dared to kill the senior who watched me, Ye Yuan, grow up. I ... am very angry!” Ye Yuan’s words got colder word after word.

These things were all what Ye Yuan was very particular about, being a taboo.

Especially Li-er, she was a weight that he could not bear in his life.

Mu Lingxue’s matter made Ye Yuan even more sensitive to such things.

However, this guy just had to make an issue about this kind of thing.

How could he not be furious?

“This ... This venerated self was wrong! I ... I beg Your Excellency to spare me!” Heavenly Sin said with a slur and blood pooling.

He was really frightened, this young man in front of him was seriously too terrifying.

He finally knew now that Ye Yuan really understood heaven better than him and was not joking with him.

It was just that he did not understand, why would Heavenly Dao actually be afraid of Ye Yuan?

But this was already not important, he was trapped for 300 thousand years. Now that he broke free, he had not enjoyed life yet. He did not want to die yet!

Ye Yuan glanced at him, a hint of a smile that gave people a chill flashed across the corners of his mouth.

It was just that this hint of smile, Heavenly Sin could not see it at all now.

Tap!

Ye Yuan threw a medicinal pill beside Heavenly Sin’s head and said coolly, “Eat it, don’t say that I’m bullying you. I’ll give you a chance for a fair fight right now!”

Ye Yuan let go of his leg. Heavenly Sin looked at the medicinal pill beside him but did not dare to make a move.

Only an idiot would fall for it!

Right now, it was more important to preserve his life.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and he said, “I asked you to eat it, you didn’t hear it?”

A terrifying killing intent locked onto Heavenly Sin. How could he still dare to hesitate, grabbing the medicinal pill on the ground and swallowing it.

The medicinal pill entering the abdomen, a wave of cool reinvigoration instantly filled all the limbs and bones in his body, making his entire person much more spirited.

What a powerful healing medicinal pill!

Heavenly Sin was startled inwardly, looking at Ye Yuan rather disbelievingly.

The medicinal effect of this medicinal pill was truly too incredible.

In less than an hour, he could fully recover.

“Give you one hour’s time, refine the medicinal pill’s medicinal strength.” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Heavenly Sin was full of doubts, not knowing what medicine Ye Yuan was selling in his gourd.

Could it be that this guy was going to fatten him up and then slaughter him?

But Ye Yuan’s words, how could he dare to defy? He could only muster up divine essence and start to refine the medicinal pill.

Everyone all looked at Ye Yuan with puzzled looks, similarly not understanding what he was going to do.

This kind of guy, directly smack him to death with one slap would do, being so long-winded with him for what?

Now, he actually even wanted to treat his injuries.

But Ye Yuan’s decision, how could it be their turn to interfere?

One hour later, Heavenly Sin was full of energy again and actually directly recovered to his peak state.

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help but marvel greatly at the medicine effect of this healing medicinal pill.

Especially Fang Tian and the rest, they naturally knew that divine pills were vastly different from mortal realm medicinal pills.

Ye Yuan’s currently Alchemy Dao strength was simply unfathomable! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Heavenly Sin stood up and was just like an aggrieved little wife, not daring to make a sound.

At this time, Ye Yuan said coolly, “You and I are both controllers, I’ll give you the chance for a fair fight. We won’t use the power of Heavenly Dao and have a fair battle!”

Heavenly Sin’s gaze turned intent and he hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Y-Your Excellency, how can this lowly one dare to make a move against you? Previously, it was all this lowly one who was scoundrelly and did ... did something that shouldn’t be done. I ... I beg your excellency to spare this lowly one’s life!”

What a joke, you say fair battle and it would be a fair battle?

You want to let me be pleased with myself for a while, then when you can’t beat you, use the power of Heavenly Dao again and smack me to death with one slap!

What kind of existence am I, Heavenly Sin Heretic God? How could I fall for the scheme of you, this child?

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s palm-blade chopped at the void.

Crack!

Right at this time, a bolt of lightning tore across the sky, akin to a bolt out of the blue!

Heavenly Sin’s eyes went wide and he said in disbelief, “Y-Y-Y-You sundered the Heavenly Dao?”
