“Senior, this junior still has a query.”

“Speak.”

“Breaking through Deity Realm requires mystic qi flooding the body. I wonder if there’s still any mystic qi in the Divine Realm?”

Mystic qi flooding the body was also the most crucial link to breaking through to Deity Realm.

This was not just the step that Fang Tian they all were most worried about, it was actually the step that Ye Yuan was most worried about as well.

Even if his Dao Defying Pill was really able to succeed, without mystic qi, he was likewise unable to break through to the Deity Realm.

Kunwu smiled and said, “Mystic qi? Huhu, don’t you have it on you?”

“I have it on me?” Ye Yuan had a blank look.

“Heh, heaven and earth essence energy is merely the low-level form of mystic qi. Not reaching the Deity Realm, this Immortal Grove Region’s martial artists are totally unable to withstand mystic qi flooding the body. One empyrean spirit treasure is sufficient to support the Immortal Grove Region’s martial artists to break through to Deity Realm. These few years, the empyrean spirit treasure that sustained the Divine Realm’s mystic qi was precisely the Universe Sword! Now that the Universe Sword was refined by someone, mystic qi is naturally siphoned empty too. But inside the other two empyrean spirit treasures, there’s naturally mystic qi too,” Kunwu said.

Ye Yuan said in amazement, “You’re saying that inside the Vast Heaven Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl both have mystic qi? But, how should I guide them out?”

“No need to guide them out! If you can remake Heavenly Dao within your body, mystic qi will naturally come out. If you fail, it naturally won’t come out either,” Kunwu said.

Ye Yuan did not expect that inside the Vast Heaven Stele actually hid mystic qi!

Five million years ago, Fang Tian had once attempted to break through to the Deity Realm before but did not arouse mystic qi.

If Fang Tian was able to find the method to add the finishing touch to Heavenly Dao, perhaps he would break through to the Deity Realm first.

Of course, whether or not he could draw out mystic qi, even Kunwu was also uncertain.

Maybe Ye Yuan was the same as Fang Tian, the final outcome being failure.

“Many thanks for senior resolving my doubts! Ye Yuan is forever indebted!” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

...

After a bout of preparations, Ye Yuan planned on refining the pill on the spot!

Kunwu did want to interrupt Ye Yuan. He just quietly watched by the side.

On a table, over a hundred kinds of spirit medicines were arranged very densely.

These hundred over types of spirit medicines were not anyhow picked.

In order to select these hundred over kinds of spirit medicines, Ye Yuan had done God knows how many deductions and experiments before.

By relying on his tiny hint of response towards Heavenly Dao, it was sifted out.

In this life, when he was idle, he did countless deductions and verifications again. He did many modifications before finally deciding on this never-existed-before pill formula.

“Big Brother, don’t know why, I ... I’m so nervous!” White Light said with an anxious look.

Ye Yuan scolded with a laugh, “You rascal, it’s just refining a medicinal pill. Is there a need?”

“That might be the case, but this medicinal pill of yours concerns the Divine Realm’s life-and-death. Can I not be nervous? If it fails, there won’t be a chance to do a second try!”

“Heh, when have your big brother failed before on refining pills?” Ye Yuan looked at White Light and said with overflowing confidence.

White Light thought about it and said, “That’s true! Big Brother’s alchemy skills have long attained the acme of perfection already. However, can the Nine Stars Imperial Heaven Art refine this Dao Defying Pill?”

Nine Stars Imperial Heaven Art was already the strongest alchemy technique under Deity Realm.

But for this alchemy technique to refine this never before seen medicinal pill, White Light was not confident either.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not using the Nine Stars Imperial Heaven Art this time!”

White Light was stunned and said, “Not using the Nine Stars Imperial Heaven Art?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “If talking about refining methods, barely anyone is more familiar with it than me. Even if it’s the Nine Stars Imperial Heaven Art, it’s also impossible to refine the Dao Defying Pill. Since I created this medicinal pill, I naturally have to create an even more impressive alchemy technique!”

“Even more impressive alchemy technique? Big Brother ... you concealed your skills so deeply!” White Light drew a cold breath.

No one understood Ye Yuan better than him. He had never seen before Ye Yuan used any alchemy skill that was even more powerful.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This alchemy skill was created in my previous life. After perfecting in this life, it should be sufficient to take on great responsibilities.”

“Big Brother, what is this alchemy skill called?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, and he said, “Ten Directions Heaven Seizing Art!”

This was an experience that was hard to come by. Naturally, the situation could not be without Ren Dong, Xiao Ruyan, as well as grand-pupil Gu Yue. They were all called out by Ye Yuan to watch and learn.

Putting aside Ren Dong and Xiao Ruyan, Gu Yue’s strength these past few years also advanced by leaps and bounds.

Of course, he learned from the fundamental level; hence he was much slower than Ren Dong and Xiao Ruyan. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But his strength was indisputable.

“The pill refinement this time is where the quintessence of everything that Master learned in his lifetime lies. You all watch carefully. How much you can comprehend will depend on your individual fortunes,” Ye Yuan said to the three people.

The three people all nodded their heads solemnly, all being incredibly excited.

They already knew that what Ye Yuan was going to refine this time could be said to be the number one pill in 100 thousand years!

As for the Ten Directions Heaven Seizing Art, it was also their first time hearing. But they did not doubt in the slightest that this was an alchemy skill that reached the acme of perfection!

Taking care of everything, Ye Yuan started refining the pill.

Ye Yuan dripped a drop of blood essence into the Dragon Sovereign Cauldron. The Dragon Sovereign Cauldron’s dragon pressure immediately billowed into the sky!

With Ye Yuan’s current peak sacred rank dragon blood, he could already deploy the Dragon Sovereign Cauldron’s power to the greatest.

The current Dragon Sovereign Cauldron was already a half-divine artifact rivaling the Vast Heaven Pagoda.

But the refinement this time was greatly different from everyone’s impression in the past.

In the past, the feeling that Ye Yuan’s pill refinement gave them was exhilarating!

Not just exhilarating, but breathtaking.

But this time, just extracting and purifying the medicinal embryo, Ye Yuan spent a full three day’s time!

Spirit medicines being many was one aspect. But Ye Yuan’s method of purification was vastly different from before.

The medicinal embryos that Ye Yuan refined, in the end, was not one, but nine!

Each main ingredient, he would refine a medicinal embryo on its own.

Seeing this scene, Xiao Ruyan and the rest were all extremely amazed.

“What’s grand-master doing here? Could it be that he’s going to refine nine medicinal pills?” Gu Yue said in wonder.

Xiao Ruyan rolled her eyes at him and said, “Do you think that the Dao Defying Pill is nine medicinal pills?”

Ren Dong said, “Refining these nine medicinal embryos doesn’t have any difficulty to Master. But refining these nine medicinal embryos into one medicinal pill is as hard as ascending to the heavens!”

Xiao Ruyan nodded and said, “Refining the Dao Defying Pill is not mixing these spirit medicines together, but combining into a complete Heavenly Dao! In the process of refinement, not only does one have to focus on the medicinal pill’s refinement, they even have to rely on their comprehension toward Alchemy Dao and fused these medicinal embryos together organically. One can say that refining this Dao Defying Pill is a tiny little world!”

Refining the medicinal embryos, Ye Yuan finally started refining.

But the moment he made his move, Xiao Ruyan and the others were all shocked!

“This ... Isn’t this the refining method of the Greater Phaseless Art? A ... A Tier 1 alchemy skill to refine the Dao Defying Pill?” Gu Yue said in shock.

Xiao Ruyan was likewise incomparably shocked and exclaimed, “You guys, look! It became the Lesser Phaseless Art! No, wait, this is another skill! This ... What in the world is going on here?”

Kunwu originally watched Ye Yuan refine and purify the medicinal embryos calmly. But the moment he took action, his gaze revealed glimmers of brilliant light!
