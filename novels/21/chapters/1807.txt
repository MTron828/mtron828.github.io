Chapter 1811 Nine Great Skill-Imparting Elders

Ye Yuan’s words stunned everyone.Jiang Hong reacted very quickly and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum? Heh, do you think that the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum is the same as the Jadelight Drum you sounded during the entrance examination? Let me tell you, that Jadelight Drum only had restrictions added. That’s why you all could sound it! Otherwise, you all, these people who entered the sect, none of you can think about sounding it!”

Ye Yuan heard after entering the sect that the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum was the Shadowmoon Sect’s ultimate treasure.

Seven drums emerging together could practically exterminate empyrean-level powerhouses!

This treasure was not a true god mystic treasure, but a genuine empyrean spirit treasure!

These seven drums, each article was a peak true god mystic treasure. But combined together, it would become a genuine empyrean spirit treasure!

Of course, the prerequisite was that someone could sound all of them.

The Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum was left behind by the Shadowmoon Sect’s founding ancestor who set a rule, anyone who could sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, the entire sect had to do their sect to help him fulfill one wish.

But, ever since the founding father, no one had accomplished it before for millions of years.

Now, Ye Yuan actually shot his mouth off, saying that he was going to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum. Wasn’t this turning himself into a laughingstock?

“This guy prides himself on having astonishing talent, truly overestimating his ability too much!”

“Heh, since time immemorial, how many overwhelmingly talented people wanted to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum. But no one could do it. What right does he have?”

“Ignorant fool, doesn’t know what kind of existence the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum is at all and he dares to talk wildly.”

...

The moment Ye Yuan’s words came out of his mouth, it immediately attracted a series of ridicules.

The Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum was the Shadowmoon Sect’s holy artifact. In the course of time, no one wanted to overestimate their ability to go and beat it already.

But now, there was actually a guy who talked wildly, saying that he was going to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum.

The woodcutter leaped and arrived on the ring, and he said to Ye Yuan, “Kid, stop messing around. The Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, even Sect Master can’t sound it too. It’s ... impossible for you to sound it. As long as the green hills remain, there will be no shortage of firewood. This enmity, let’s avenge it again in the future.”

Baili Qingyan also went up to the stage and urged, “Yeah, Ye Yuan. You’ve displayed your talent now. The sect will definitely view you in a different light. With your talent, taking revenge won’t need very long. Moreover, sounding to Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum to kill him is really using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken.”

Even he also thought that Ye Yuan saying this was merely words said in anger.

Once the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum sounded, that was to have the power of the entire sect from top to bottom help him fulfill one wish.

Such a massive favor, using it to kill Qian Ye was simply using a cannon to kill mosquitoes. This was wasting fine material for petty use.

Who knew that Ye Yuan said sternly, “I’m not messing around! I said that I’m going to kill him, it means that I must kill! Benevolence toward enemies is cruelty to yourself! This drum, I’m definitely sounding it!”

Everyone did not think that Ye Yuan’s attitude was actually so resolute.

...

Seven Stars Valley, the Shadowmoon Sect’s forbidden land, also the place holding the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum.

At this time, the nine great skill-imparting elders were gathered in one hall.

Quite a few people used unfriendly gazes to look at that figure in front of them.

“Humph! Nonsensical brat, to actually want to sound the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum!” Heavenly Heart Peak’s skill-imparting elder said unhappily.

“A brat still wet behind his ears is actually going to trouble us nine great skill-imparting elders to gather together, what haughty airs!” Heavenly Rush Peak’s skill-imparting elder similarly said unhappily.

“Woodcutter, you’re sure that you want to accompany this kid and go nuts? If this kid can’t even sound three times, not only will he have to be exiled to Remorse Cliff, you’ll also have to suffer heavy punishment!” Tianzhu Peak’s skill-imparting elder looked at the woodcutter deeply and said.

Opening up the Seven Stars Valley required nine great skill-imparting elders to gather.

They each controlled a part of the spell. Only nine stars gathering together could open the Seven Stars Valley.

Being so troublesome was naturally in order to prevent outsiders from intruding.

But, in order to prevent disciples from having malicious fun, the sect naturally set strict rules too.

If the disciple beating the drum was unable to sound it three times, not only did they have to be punished severely, even their peak’s skill-imparting elder would also have to suffer heavy punishment.

Hence, before disciples entered the Seven Stars Valley, they must get their own peak’s skill-imparting elder’s approval.

Ye Yuan’s talent naturally went without saying. The woodcutter had long approved of him already.

It was just that these three drumbeats were also not that easy to achieve.

The woodcutter said coolly, “Don’t you worry! With Ye Yuan’s talent, even if he can’t sound seven drumbeats, three drumbeats are absolutely not a problem.”

Tianzhu Peak’s skill-imparting elder laughed mockingly and said, “You’re also too confident in this brat. For so many years, not one disciple could sound three drumbeats!”

The woodcutter chuckled and said, “Ye Yuan is different from them! Enough nonsense, open up the Seven Stars Valley!”

The moment nine great True God powerhouses released their auras, just that pressure made Ye Yuan’s complexion turn pale.

True God Realm was too powerful!

Nine beams of light rose from the ground up and shot straight into nine points.

Rumble!

The Seven Stars Valley’s restrictions slowly opened under these nine beams of light.

Ye Yuan looked at the woodcutter’s figure, eyes full of gratitude.

The incident this time somewhat deviated from his expectations. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If not for the woodcutter’s words, he would really die very horribly this time.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and slowly walked into the Seven Stars Valley. The nine great skill-imparting elders also followed closely behind.

Upon entering the Seven Stars Valley, a piercing cold gale blew over.

Ye Yuan was caught by surprise and was nearly blown away.

This scene landing in the eyes of several skill-imparting elders, they naturally felt even more disdain.

“Heh, an outer-sect disciple beating the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, it’s really the first time in the sect’s history. To talk about overestimating one’s own ability, this seat will yield to this brat!” Jiang Hong looked at Ye Yuan and said with a scornful look.

Ye Yuan’s goal was drumming the drum. It was in order to kill Qian Ye.

Among these nine great skill-imparting elders, the sight of Ye Yuan naturally turned him off the most.

While Ye Yuan’s talent was astonishing, he could not wait for Ye Yuan to be shocked to death by the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum right now.

The woodcutter said coolly, “Jiang Hong, I know that you’re very covetous of Ye Yuan right now. Heh heh, you all, these guys who came from large sects, all look down on those who came from small sects, all look down on my Tianying Peak. But you all don’t know, true geniuses tend to come out of small sects! Just like myself. Back then, I chopped those so-called proud children of heaven dazed and confused with an ax. That’s how I have today. While today, Ye Yuan similarly used his strength to make you all regret your actions back then!”

Woodcutter’s words made the other eight great skill-imparting elders’ faces turn black.

The woodcutter back then was indeed a legend of the Shadowmoon Sect.

He came out of an unknown small sect, carried an ax, and swept across the so-called proud children of heaven back then.

Later, the woodcutter was the same as Ye Yuan, being squeezed out to Tianying Peak.

But he did not grumble about anything, carrying an ax and chopped wood every single day.

Chopping day in and day out, chopping year in and year out.

He was laughed at by god knows how many people, spurned by no idea how many.

All the way until one day, a powerful aura burst through the horizon.

He, the woodcutter, broke through to True God!
