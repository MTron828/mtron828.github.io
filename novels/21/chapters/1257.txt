Chapter 1261: Soul Tempest!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Damn it! Could it be that even the Soul Suppressing Pearl isn’t this Deathsoul Tree’s match either? Why doesn’t it have any reaction at all?!”

Although Ye Yuan’s divine soul was frozen, he did not completely lose his ability to think.

His only hope right now was the Soul Suppressing Pearl.

But the Soul Suppressing Pearl did not react at all. This made him incredibly anxious.

Ye Yuan’s divine soul was pulled out of the body bit by bit. The crow’s eyes were like a bottomless abyss where Ye Yuan fell non-stop.

All of a sudden, the Soul Suppressing Pearl had a trace of undulation once more!

Ye Yuan’s divine soul that had just left the body halfway was pulled back once more!

“En? What’s going on?” The crow said in surprise.

This move of his had never failed before. Even Deity Realm powerhouses, as long as they stared at his eyes, they would also not be able to shake off the fate of having their souls absorbed.

But today, he actually failed!

The other party was still a mortal who was not even Deity Realm.

“Legends have it that the Atavism Dragon Soul is the dragon race’s strongest divine soul. Ao Qin that old thing’s strength is unfathomable. Being able to resist the Netherworld Look isn’t impossible either. However ... unless it’s that old thing’s main body personally descending, otherwise, nobody can save his descendant!” muttered the crow to itself.

Suddenly, that crow in the center opened up its wings, and actually flew onto Ye Yuan’s head!

Ye Yuan’s divine soul that had just settled down was akin to being struck by lightning once more.

The crow opened its sharp beak and reached towards the top of Ye Yuan’s head. A suction that shook the soul instantly enveloped Ye Yuan’s whole body.

But in the next instant, the crow cried out in terror!

“Soul Suppressing Pearl! Turns out it’s the Soul Suppressing Pearl! Damn it! Damn it! How can it be the Soul Suppressing Pearl? Argh!”

The crow seemed to have suffered an immense scare, his cry filled with despair.

He flapped his wings twice, wanting to leave Ye Yuan’s body.

Except, it was already too late!

A terrifying suction emitted from the top of Ye Yuan’s head, directly sucking the black crow in.

The black crow did not absorb Ye Yuan’s divine soul but was devoured by Ye Yuan instead.

Accurately speaking, it was not Ye Yuan, but the Soul Suppressing Pearl!

Ye Yuan could distinctly sense that the black crow was directly swallowed up by the Soul Suppressing Pearl.

“Huff, huff, huff ...”

Ye Yuan gasped heavily for air, finally breaking free from that terrifying shackle.

He wanted to go rescue White Light and Lu-er straight away!

It was just that before Ye Yuan took action, Ye Yuan just felt his sea of consciousness buzz. A terrifying soul tempest swept out with him as the center.

This soul tempest was too frightening. Ye Yuan could not withstand this kind of impact at all. His two eyes rolled back at once, fainting away.

A black bead slowly flew out from inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, suspending in the air.

For some time, a fierce gale sprang up.

With the Soul Suppressing Pearl as the center, it formed a soul vortex.

This vortex became larger and larger. The storm became increasingly stronger!

“Ahh, ahh, ahh! After that old thing died, hasn’t the Soul Suppressing Pearl long gone missing? Why would it appear on this brat?”

The Deathsoul Tree gave off a shrill miserable scream, seized with immense terror.

Except, the soul tempest that the Soul Suppressing Pearl gave off became larger and larger. That horrifying suction, even the Deathsoul Tree was actually unable to withstand it too!

This storm spread to the entire Death Marsh very quickly.

The entire god-forbidden region’s unknown existences all detected this terrifying undulation.

This undulation made their hearts palpitate vigorously!

Those living in this god-forbidden region were all existences that the Divine Realm was unable to imagine.

...

In a mountain range, two pairs of eyes were revealed in the darkness.

In the eyes, it was full of fear.

“What kind of aura is this, such powerful undulations! Looks like it’s coming from the Death Marsh that side?”

“It’s the Soul Suppressing Pearl! One of Immortal Grove Empyrean’s personal three great magic treasures! It’s the Immortal Grove Region’s supreme soul artifact! Five million years ago, the Immortal Grove Empyrean perished. With his Dao vanishing, the Soul Suppressing Pearl went missing. I didn’t expect that five million years later, it finally came into being once more!”

“Immortal Grove Empyrean? Who is that?”

“That’s the sovereign of this Immortal Grove Region, an existence that the likes of us look up to!”

“An existence that even you, Father, look up to? Just how strong is that?”

“How strong? Huhu, strong beyond your imagination!”

“Then the Deathsoul Tree?”

“Huhu, that guy dared to provoke the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s new master! That’s courting death himself. Nobody can save him! Once the soul tempest kicks off, those guys will probably all have to restrain themselves a bit. Devouring the Deathsoul Tree, the Soul Suppressing Pearl probably should awaken thoroughly as well!”

...

No idea how long had passed either. The storm finally settled down.

Ye Yuan finally recovered a trace of consciousness and only felt that his head was splitting.

Virtually right away, he thought of White Light and Lu-er, and suddenly recalled things.

“White Light! Lu-er!” Ye Yuan cried out in shock.

“Big Brother (Young Master), we’re here!”

“Big Brother Yuan, you finally woke up!”

Three familiar voices sounded out by his ear, making Ye Yuan feel like he was dreaming.

He glanced at White Light and looked at Lu-er, and said in surprise and bewilderment, “You ... You guys are fine?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

White Light said, “We don’t know what happened either. When we woke up, we were lying here just like you! Lu-er and I woke up around the same time. Only the time you were in a coma was a little longer.”

No matter what, seeing that the two people were safe and sound, a large rock in Ye Yuan’s heart finally landed.

Recalling that scene of White Light and Lu-er being snatched of their souls, Ye Yuan really felt like a knife was being twisted in his heart at that time.

Even now, he was shaking with lingering fear too.

Ye Yuan suddenly looked towards Li-er and said, “Li-er, you didn’t have your soul snatch. Did you see anything inside the Vast Heaven Pagoda?”

Li-er shook her head and said, “Although I didn’t have my soul seized, I was the same as you all, being restraint by that Deathsoul Tree. Later on, the soul tempest started, and I became unaware of everything.”

The four people exchanged changes. All had vacant looks, totally unaware of what happened in-between.

There was still the Shi Potian by the side who likewise had a blank look.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he sunk his divine sense into the Soul Suppressing Pearl. He discovered that the Soul Suppressing Pearl was still suspended in his sea of consciousness, the same as before. It was as if nothing happened at all.

“Just what the hell is this Soul Suppressing Pearl? The things that happened before are simply unimaginably mysterious!” Ye Yuan said absentmindedly.

Watching White Light and Lu-er being devoured by the crow, Ye Yuan virtually already ascertained the two of their deaths.

But did not expect that after the soul tempest, the two people appeared in front of him again perfectly well.

Beyond the wild ecstasy, Ye Yuan was more surprised.

This Soul Suppressing Pearl was seriously unfathomable, making him feel completely at a loss.

That Deathsoul Tree was a legendary existence, an existence even more horrifying than Deity Realm powerhouses.

But the Soul Suppressing Pearl actually utterly crushed it!

“En?” Ye Yuan was suddenly startled and said, “We seem to have already exited the Death Marsh. What about that Deathsoul Tree?”

The other four people had blank faces too. They also did not know what in the world happened.

Ye Yuan was helpless and said, “Alright, don’t think anymore if we can’t figure it out. We’d best go find the Kunwu Divine Wood!”

At this time, inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl, a phantom gradually condensed.

His gaze seemed to pierce through space, landing on Ye Yuan, who was currently pressing on with his journey.

“Huhu, five million years already, the Soul Suppressing Pearl finally has a successor!”
