Chapter 1253: World Suppressing Stele!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Bit off more than I can chew this time!”

Ye Yuan never thought that these blockheads could actually still self-detonate.

However, he was not really seized with fear and trepidation.

Putting aside that even three great fiendgods could not breach his defense, even if it was really breached, his Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art could still ensure his survival.

It was just that he did not expect that this Stonebrave was actually so resolute.

Stonebrave’s large hand waved, sending all of his clansmen flying, while he himself sped over in Ye Yuan’s direction.

At this time, his entire body was filled with a horrifying aura, just like a time-bomb.

At this time, a gentle energy suddenly appeared, wrapping Stonebrave inside.

The Stonebrave who was originally about to explode and already almost disintegrating was actually suppressed back,

That horrifying aura dissipated to nothing just like that.

Boom!

An enormous stoneman stood in the crowd with a loud bang.

Ye Yuan could not help looking towards his new-arrival stoneman in surprise. His size was even larger than Stonebrave. The degree of danger was clearly even greater compared to Stonebrave!

“Patriarch!”

“Patriarch!”

...

When those stonemen saw him, each one of them was abnormally excited.

“Patriarch, you finally woke up! This damn human killed Stonebold they all! You have to take revenge for them!” Stonebrave said with grief and indignation.

He hated Ye Yuan to the bones right now and wished to perish together with him.

Of course, this was just his beautiful wish.

Ye Yuan looked at this large blockhead, akin to facing a great enemy.

Although the other party was a stoneman, the aura coming from the other party’s body was actually somewhat similar to the old ancestor!

Could it be that this guy before his eyes was actually a Deity Realm powerhouse?

That gentle energy earlier was mysterious and hard to fathom, and actually suppressed the Stonebrave who was about to self-detonate back.

That kind of control over energy laws was absolutely not what the present Ye Yuan could achieve.

The stoneman patriarch did not bother with Stonebrave, but looked towards Ye Yuan instead and said, “Human, on your body ... seems to have an aura that this deity is familiar with.”

This deity!

As expected, a Deity Realm powerhouse!

The stoneman patriarch’s words made Ye Yuan’s and his party’s faces change.

This time, it seemed like they really bit off more than they could chew.

“Familiar aura?” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, not quite certain what it meant.

The stoneman patriarch said, “Let this deity thinking it over, it seems like ... the World Suppressing Stele’s aura.”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, and he hoisted up the Vast Heaven Stele in his palm and said curiously, “You’re talking about it?”

The stoneman patriarch’s gaze turned intent and he said, “This ... This is really the World Suppressing Stele! The stoneman clan’s patriarch, Shi Potian, pays respect to Master.”

Shi Potian suddenly knelt on the ground with one knee. That enormous body shook the entire mountain until it rocked.

Seeing this scene, not just the stoneman clan, even Ye Yuan was stunned too.

When did the Vast Heaven Stele become the World Suppressing Stele again?

“Patriarch, this ... What’s going on here?”

Stonebrave was struck senseless by this scene. He seriously could not figure out why Patriarch knelt down towards a human.

One had to know that the humans were the stoneman clan’s mortal enemy!

“Yeah, Patriarch Shi, are you ... mistaken? It’s called Vast Heaven Stele, not World Suppressing Stele!” Ye Yuan also said rather baffledly.

But Shi Potian said, “Absolutely won’t be wrong! The World Suppressing Stele’s aura is branded on the Heart of Stone of the stoneman clan’s patriarch, passing down from generation to generation. It absolutely won’t be wrong!”

This time, Ye Yuan was truly taken aback from shock.

He also perceived that the Heart of Stone was very important to the stoneman clan.

Something that could be branded on the Heart of Stone, it was like inheritance memories, which absolutely would not be wrong.

Then the problem came, why was the Vast Heaven Stele called World Suppressing Stele?

“Patriarch Shi, you get up first. What on earth is going on here, can you tell me in detail?” Ye Yuan did a lifting hand gesture and said.

But Stonebrave said with a look of righteous indignation and said, “Patriarch, Stonebold and their hearts of stone are still in this human’s hands! You ... How can you be like this?”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said with an awkward look, “It was just joking around with you guys just now, don’t take it for real. H-Haha, actually, I just want to know the secret of the Heart of Stone, that’s all.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan immediately threw the few hearts of stone out.

All of a sudden, the shattered rocks all gathered around the hearts of stone. Stonebold and the rest recovered again.

This heart of stone was like the seven-inch point of a snake.

Once grasped by someone, they would be unable to recover anymore.

Even though Ye Yuan released Stonebold and the rest’s hearts of stone, Stonebrave did not buy it and was still filled with resentment towards Ye Yuan.

In his view, Ye Yuan only did so due to Patriarch’s strength.

Who knew that Shi Potian said indifferently, “The heart of stone is where the essence of my stoneman clan lies. To human martial artists, it’s a great tonic item. When human martial artists swallow the heart of stone, not only can their strength advance greatly, they can even comprehend the powers of law inside the heart of stone comprehensively. Originally, my stoneman clan was a powerful race in the Divine Realm. But later on, we were captured and killed without restraint by humans. Later, in order to escape the humans’ poaching, that’s why we hid in the Godsfall Mountain Range, eking out a feeble existence till today.”

“Patriarch! You ... How can you say this sort of words to a human?” Stonebrave said in shock.

The heart of stone was the stoneman clan’s original sin.

Only then did Ye Yuan understand why Stonebrave and the rest had such strong hostility towards him.

An ancient powerful race declined until like this now, it was all because of greedy humans.

With humans’ greed, they could really do this kind of unbelievably brutal thing.

But toward Stonebrave’s shock and anger, Shi Potian was indifferent and said coolly, “The master of the World Suppressing Stele is our stoneman clan’s master! Even if he exterminates our entire clan, there’s also no cause for much criticism! This bit of secret has no need to hide. If Master requires it, just take our hearts of stone. There’s no harm either.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Shi Potian’s words struck everyone with alarm.

This degree of loyalty in Ye Yuan’s opinion was undoubtedly foolish loyalty.

But Shi Potian’s words did not seem to be joking around.

With the other party’s strength, even if he used the Voice of the Dragon God, he might not be a match either.

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I have no interest in the hearts of stone. Just now, I was just somewhat curious.”

Ye Yuan making his position known aroused Stonebrave’s snickering instead.

“High-sounding words! Right now, Patriarch already woke up. Of course you say that you’re not interested!”

But White Light smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “Heh, with my big brother’s comprehension abilities, does he still need your hearts of stone to comprehend Heavenly Dao? Growing from the Essence Qi Realm until now, he merely used 30 over year’s time!”

Stonebrave said in disbelief when he heard that and said, “You’re lying! How can a human martial artist possibly have such great talent?”

“Heh, my big brother’s improvement, haven’t you seen it too? Before he entered the Peach Blossom Forest and after he came out, how much time passed?” White Light said coolly.

Stonebrave was startled. Only then did he recall this incident, and could not help somewhat believing White Light’s words.

Ye Yuan had no intention of arguing. He asked Shi Potian, “Patriarch Shi, you said that the Vast Heaven Stele is the World Suppressing Stele. Just what’s the meaning of this?”

But Shi Potian’s answer made Ye Yuan very surprised.

“Actually, I don’t know either. I just know that our stoneman clan’s mission is to guard the World Suppressing Stele!”
