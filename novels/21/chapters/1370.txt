1374 Golden Sword Token

Suddenly, an inexplicable sense of palpitation welled up in their hearts. A powerful pressure descended from the sky.

Lei Dong, Mu Sen, as well as the academy’s students all gave a bow respectfully.

“We welcome City Lord, Your Excellency’s descend!”

A middle-aged man in azure clothing slowly walked out of the void. As soon as he appeared, he gave people a feeling of peerlessness.

So strong! Is this a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse? Ye Yuan was secretly alarmed in his heart.

He did not think that this legendary Divine Lord Realm powerhouse actually came personally!

This middle-aged man in azure clothes looked elegant and soft-spoken. But his might could not be concealed no matter what.

Xiao Feng was already a peak Origin Deity powerhouse. But the oppressive feeling he gave Ye Yuan was on a completely different level from this one in front of him!

Heh, this is merely a wisp of thought clone! A true Divine Lord Realm powerhouse is God knows how many times stronger than this, Dustless’s voice suddenly sounded out in his consciousness.

Ye Yuan was shocked again when he heard that. Such a powerful oppressive force, and he was actually merely just a thought clone!

Wu Meng City Lord said coolly, “Being able to pass the test, you all are my Wu Meng Capital City’s top geniuses, with future accomplishments being limitless! Wu Meng Academy is the place where heroes gather. The path of a powerhouse for everyone has only just begun! I hope that ... there’s someone among you all who can surpass your predecessors and reach Divine Lord Realm!”

The words ignited everyone’s hot blood.

For these students, their lifelong pursuit was Divine Lord Realm!

But wanting to reach this step was far too difficult.

Don’t look at how these genius martial artists all left people behind in the dust currently. Once their potential was used up, they might not be able to break through a minor realm for tens of thousands of years!

Among Wu Meng Academy’s students, those whose talents were a little weaker could all reach grand completion Heaven Glimpse.

The good ones could even reach grand completion Origin Deity!

But they might not be able to produce one capable of breaking through to Divine Lord Realm in 100 thousand years!

If Xiao Feng did not meet Ye Yuan, perhaps he could not find this breakthrough opportunity all his life too.

Even so, whether or not he could really break through was another matter altogether.

Wu Meng City Lord paused for a bit and continued, “This lord coming here today is to take the top dog in as an in-name disciple! Qin Shao!”

Ever since the test, Qin Shao had always been calm and level-headed.

But at this moment, he was trembling all over.

That was trembling with excitement!

This day, he had waited far too long.

“Disciple Qin Shao, pays respect to City Lord!”

Qin Shao directly knelt down towards Wu Meng City Lord and performed a master acknowledgment ceremony.

Wu Meng City Lord slowly nodded and said, “This test, you overpowered all geniuses and became the top dog! According to Wu Meng Academy’s rules, I’ll take you in as an in-name disciple today. This is the Golden Sword Token that represents this lord’s disciple status. Seeing this token is akin to seeing this lord!”

Wu Meng City Lord pointed a finger. A ray of golden light flew towards Qin Shao. A several inches long golden little sword appeared in his hand.

Seeing this scene, all of the students felt envious.

They all knew that not only did this Golden Sword Token represent the identity of a city lord’s disciple, but it was also a heavenly divine artifact in itself, with its boundless power!

With it, it was equivalent to having a death-exemption golden token!

Qin Shao said agitatedly, “This disciple thanks Master!”

Wu Meng City Lord nodded and said, “Mm, although you’re already an in-name disciple under me, you have to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, don’t get proud by relying on favors! If you fail the tests in the future, this Golden Sword Token, this lord will take it back!”

Qin Shao’s heart turned cold, and he said, “This disciple will remember Master’s teachings and will definitely work harder, and strive for a face to officially enter Master’s tutelage!”

Wu Meng City Lord nodded his head slightly and said coolly, “Alright, the test this time is already done. After you all enter the academy, you have to work harder and become my Wu Meng Capital City’s pillars! This lord is going!”

While talking, Wu Meng City Lord’s figure gradually became illusionary.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan felt all the hairs on his body stand on its end.

He clearly felt Wu Meng City Lord’s gaze turned toward him.

Being stared intently by such a powerhouse, Ye Yuan’s hairs really stood on its end.

But very soon, Wu Meng City Lord’s figure disappeared. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Only then, did that uneasy sense of danger disappear.

“Could it be that ... he saw through something?” Ye Yuan asked Dustless.

The secrets on Ye Yuan were too many. Just the Soul Suppressing Pearl and World Suppressing Stele, two empyrean spirit treasures, were sufficient to drive the world crazy.

Hence, that was why Ye Yuan would be so low-profile and did not want to be overly eye-catching.

Otherwise, even if he could not get many points in the second round, this position of top dog would also not be Qin Shao’s turn.

“Heh, he’s just interested in you! Your play was too overboard just now. His level of expertise, how could he possibly be completely unaware of it? However, with his bit of strength, he still can’t perceive this old man’s situation, so you just rest assured,” Dustless said with a laugh.

Only then did Ye Yuan let out a sigh in relief. Looks like the final round just now, he really played a little too overboard.

“Alright, now, take your wooden tablets and return to your lotus seats again. The lotus seats will transport you all to Wu Meng Academy!” Lei Dong said.

When everyone heard that, they all returned to the lotus seats one after another, being transported away one by one.

Ye Yuan was just about to move but was stopped by Lei Dong.

“Ye Yuan, you wait a minute!”

Ye Yuan was stupefied and said, “What is Teacher finding me for?”

Lei Dong’s gaze was heated as he said, “Ye Yuan, you give an honest account, just how much strength did you preserve in the third round?”

Ye Yuan was stunned and said, bewilderedly, “Preserve strength? Teacher, Ye Yuan already went all out, where’s the talk of holding back strength?”

Pretend!

You just pretend!

Even a fool could tell that Ye Yuan preserved strength.

Withdrawing from the consciousness space in three days, then directly charging to the 18th scale line.

No more, no less, just nicely able to win against Jia Chong!

To say that Ye Yuan did not hold back strength, that was also a little too ridiculous, right?

If Jia Chong’s result was 20 scale lines, Lei Dong did not doubt in the slightest that Ye Yuan could charge to 21 scale lines!

But with Ye Yuan feigning ignorance, Lei Dong really did not have much temper. Waving his hand, he said, “Alright, go then.”

“Teacher, Ye Yuan will leave first!” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

Ye Yuan slowly walked towards the lotus seats. Mu Sen walked up and said, “You believe him?”

“Only a ghost will believe him! This kid isn’t honest!” Lei Dong said disgruntledly.

Mu Sen smiled and said, “Although Qin Shao is formidable, you and I can see through with a glance. But this kid really can’t be fathomed! It looks like there are quite a number of secrets on him! Honestly speaking, I feel more optimistic about him!”

Lei Dong nodded his head and said, “This boy is very hard to say. His future accomplishments might not be worse than Qin Shao’s!”

...

Little Fatty moved close and asked Ye Yuan softly, “Bro, say honestly, how many scale lines is your limit?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “You guess?”

Xie Jingyi thought about it and said uncertainly, “Twenty ... three?”

This was already the limit that he could imagine.

Ye Yuan shook his head and smiled, but he did not speak.

Xie Jingyi’s gaze turned intent, and he said again, “Twenty ... six?”

Ye Yuan still shook his head and said with a smile, “Stop guessing, I won’t tell you!”
