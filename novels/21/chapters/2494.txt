Chapter 2500: This Ancestor is Talking to You!

“Yes! Of course there was!”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s question, Wang Cheng could not resist being pleased with himself and said, “That guy, that guy, and that guy, all were done by me! Why? You want to come to find me to take revenge??Hahaha?… what a joke!”

Wang Cheng laughed very wildly, very arrogantly.

He was already very sure that Ye Yuan was not Lin Chaotian’s match.

Heavenly Dao Samsara was already over. The outcome was a foregone conclusion!

Ye Yuan could only be eliminated by the times.

Therefore, he did not care about Ye Yuan’s attitude at all.

Not only did he not care, but he was also very proud of himself instead.

The person who abused Saint Azure made him feel great!

Not far away, Lin Chaotian also smiled as he said,?“Huhu,?if you feel that you have the capability, you can very well take revenge on Wang Cheng under this ancestor’s eyelids!”

Swoosh!

Lin Chaotian’s voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan’s figure already disappeared.

That speed already surpassed thought!

Crack!

Everyone still had not understood what was going on when they heard a brittle sound came over.

“ARGH!?My … My arm!” Only after a breath, di Wang Chang’s pig-slaughter-like scream suddenly came out. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Everyone followed the voice and looked over, and they could not help being filled with fear.

It turned out that one of Wang Cheng’s arms had already been forcibly broken by Ye Yuan!

Without the strength to fight back!

A Dao Ancestor actually did not have the strength to fight back in front of Ye Yuan!

Far away, came a series of sounds of cold air being sucked in.

This bit earlier was seriously too fast, quickly until everyone did not react. Many people also looked at Lin Chaotian with strange expressions. He just finished talking and Wang Cheng’s bones were broken.

This face was slapped too resoundingly. It was even more resounding than Wang Cheng’s screams.

Tian Qing’s pupils constricted slightly, having a look of surprise on his face.

He also did not expect that things would actually have such a dramatic change.

“It will be easy to discuss things with you,” Ye Yuan’s nonchalant words sounded out in Wang Cheng’s ears.

Lin Chaotian’s eyes turned dark, a fiery-burning feeling on his face.

The prestige that he had just established, was wiped away with Ye Yuan’s slap!

Fury!

“Ye Yuan! Let Wang Cheng go! Otherwise, you’ll die very horribly!” Lin Chaotian said in a chilly voice.

Ye Yuan ignored him, he just said to Wang Cheng indifferently, “The things that they suffered, you need to bear it ten-fold! Relax, you won’t die so quickly!”

Wang Cheng was alarmed and enraged, his fear reaching the extreme.

Just now, he did not see how Ye Yuan made his move at all.

A Dao Ancestor could not see clearly how his opponent made his move.

This sort of thing was simply too crazy, and too … chilling!

“B-Brother Chaotian, s-save me!” Wang Cheng endured the intense pain and shouted.

Crack!

Another crisp bone snapping sound.

This time, everyone saw it clearly.

Ye Yuan forcibly broke Wang Cheng’s other arm just like that.

He did not employ divine essence, he just used the power of the fleshy body crudely.

This kind of breaking was not fatal, but it made the physical body feel very painful.

Wang Cheng’s scream lingered on incessantly.

With this, Lin Chaotian was genuinely enraged.

Ye Yuan actually dared to make light of him!

“Humph!?Looks like you’re really seeking death!”

Lin Chaotian gave a cold snort, his figure moving swiftly, suddenly thrusting a palm towards Ye Yuan.

His speed was quick to the extreme.

Being conferred ancestor a second time, Lin Chaotian’s improvement was all-around.

Just in terms of the application of spatial law, he also far surpassed other Dao Ancestors.

Boom!

Lin Chaotian’s palm smacked onto Ye Yuan’s body.

The corners of his mouth curled slightly. Sure enough, the current Ye Yuan was already not his match!

A series of exclamations came from all around.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure slowly became illusory, akin to the moon’s reflection in the water, dissipating without a trace.

“Ahhh!!”

At the same time, another scream came over.

It turned out that Wang Cheng’s chest directly had a large hole opened up!

It was forcibly punched through by Ye Yuan with one punch!

The current Wang Cheng was miserable to the extreme, having cold sweat pouring profusely from pain.

He only felt that every cell in his body was hurting from head to toe.

“Were you yelling for him to come to save you just now?” A hint of a smile appeared at the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

It was just that the smile was somewhat cold.

Ye Yuan was really enraged!

Lin Chaotian provoked his bottom-line time and again, making him reach the limit of his patience!

Now, there was even a Wang Cheng who jumped out to bounce around.

He naturally did not mind cleaning them up together.

Looking at the Ye Yuan in front of him disappear bit by bit, Lin Chaotian’s eyes suddenly contracted.

He was a little surprised in his heart.

This disappearance was completely different from that strange disappearance in the pat.

Was it possible that this boy already reached the realm of spatial rule?

“Damn it! This ancestor wants to see how much you can avoid! Endless Fire Hell!”

Lin Chaotian was enraged too!

It was only to see that the moment he released his law. It instantly turned into a sea of fire within a hundred miles.

Ye Yuan as well as Sacred Ancestor High Priest and the others were shockingly encased inside.

Wood and fire, two laws activated, the temperature of this sea of fire, was ten times more terrifying than the Fire Dance Frenzied Demon back then!

In this sea of fire, ordinary Dao Ancestors would be incinerated into nothingness too.

“What a terrifying sea of fire! This … This is the true Ancestor Fire!”

“Yeah! The former Ancestor Fire is simply like a baby when compared to Lin Chaotian!”

“It’s over! This is an indiscriminate attack! I’m afraid that Lord Saint Azure is unable to escape, right? Even if he can escape, those friends of his likely can’t escape too!”

… …

The moment the sea of fire appeared, everyone’s expressions changed wildly.

Even Tian Qing’s gaze also flashed slightly.

Clearly, the power of this fire sea made him view it in a different light.

But at this time, an indifferent voice came from beyond a hundred miles away.

“Kneel down!”

Pffft!

Pffft!

The sound of two bones cracking came over, Wang Cheng directly knelt down.

And opposite him was Ni Xuan and the rest.

Lin Chaotian’s eyes immediately became wide-saucers.

“He … How did he escape? This is impossible! My Endless Fire Hell doesn’t have a dead angle at all! Even if he reached the realm of spatial rule, it’s impossible to escape too!” Lin Chaotian looked at this scene, full of shock and disbelief.

This sea of fire was vastly different from an ordinary sea of fire.

Even if you escaped into the void, the sea of fire could burn you too.

This move was an indiscriminate attack!

But this formidable move was actually dodged by Ye Yuan so casually?

Lin Chaotian was full of puzzlement in his heart!

Wang Cheng’s knee bones had already been completely crushed and he could not help kneeling down in front of Ni Xuan and the others.

Seeing this scene, Ni Xuan and the others felt incomparably delighted.

Previously, Wang Cheng’s lackey appearance was still vivid in their minds.

Now, he was finally taken care of by Ye Yuan!

So what if Dao Ancestor?

“Apologize!” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly, his words carrying a majesty that brooked no intervention.

Wang Cheng broke down!

He discovered to his dismay that Lin Chaotian could not save him at all!

In fact, he was almost killed by Lin Chaotian indiscriminately just now!

He appeared outside of the sea of fire bafflingly.

“I … I was wrong! Your Excellencies, j-just treat this lowly one as a far and let me off!” Wang Cheng said to the few people with tears and snorts running down his face.

But right then, a terrifying to the extreme power of rule surged to the sky behind everybody.

This power made everyone feel despair!

“Ye Yuan! This ancestor is talking to you, are you deaf?” Lin Chaotian bellowed angrily.
