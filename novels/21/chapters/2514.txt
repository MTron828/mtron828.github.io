Chapter 2520: Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, True Yang Heavenly Domain.

There was a vast expanse of forest in front. Trees were vigorous and upright, luscious and green.

There was a clearing in the forest, the clearing was overgrown with weeds.

Amidst the weeds, a broken altar was faintly visible.

Suddenly, the altar gave off a beam of light, and a figure appeared.

“Puhwark!”

As soon as the figure appeared, he vomited a large mouthful of blood fiercely.

It was only to see his figure sway, wanting to take two steps, but he vomited a mouthful of blood again.

The severity of his wounds could be seen.

This person was precisely the Jun Tian who had just escaped from the Heavenspan World!

“D-Damn it! My injuries are too heavy. I already can’t move! I really failed in this simple task, to actually let an ant hurt me until like this! However … that heavenly spirit treasure! After my injuries recover, I must find a way to obtain the Heavenspan Mountain!”

Thick greed flashed across in Jun Tian’s eyes.

That collision from Ye Yuan truly startled heaven and earth and made gods and ghosts weep.

He, this grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, was also knocked dazed and confused.

But fortunately, the plane passageway was closed. Ye Yuan was unable to pass through!

Otherwise, he would probably die on the spot right now.

Putting away the heated gaze, Jun Tian took out a dark-gray medicinal pill and swallowed it, and started revolving his powers and regulating his breathing.

Boom!

Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the altar exploded!

Jun Tian was directly sent flying out by the huge impact.

A figure dashed out and landed not far in front of Jun Tian.

Jun Tian’s pupils constricted and he said in horror, “Y-You … How is it possible? The plane passageway is closed. It’s absolutely impossible for a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum to forcibly burst open! You … How did you do it?”

The current Jun Tian was terrified to the extreme.

His injuries were extremely heavy and he was completely unable to fight anymore.

But Ye Yuan forcibly broke through the plane barrier at this time; this was really terrible!

Ye Yuan held his palm out, a hardy and heavy small mountain appeared.

“Used this to smash it open,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Jun Tian’s expression changed wildly and he said, “Y-You subdued the Heavenspan Mountain? This … How is this possible? You’re clearly …”

“I’m clearly a rookie who knows nothing, so how can I subdue the Heavenspan Mountain, is it? Really let you down. The Heavenspan Mountain’s method of control is hidden on the Heavenspan Mountain,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

When Jun Tian heard that, he practically had an impulse to swear.

This Heavenspan World was really a huge pit!

Him jumping in now directly buried himself!

Earlier on, Ye Yuan caused a great sensation in the Heavenspan World.

That towering and lofty Heavenspan Mountain that had stood for countless hundreds of millions of years was actually gone!

Gone …

The Heavenspan Mountain was taken away by Ye Yuan!

At that moment, the entire Heavenspan World was plunged into deep fear and shock.

The Heavenspan Mountain’s significance to the Heavenspan World’s martial artists could not be described using words at all.

Now, the Heavenspan Mountain was gone. They already felt at a loss on what to do.

This time, Jun Tian was really afraid!

Jun Tian’s footsteps were falling back involuntarily.

But Ye Yuan’s gaze was sizing up the surroundings.

This place made him very uncomfortable.

The air was filled with a powerful suppression force.

That feeling was like someone walked into a gravity chamber.

If Heavenspan World’s gravity was one, then the gravity here was ten thousand!

The powerful restrictive force greatly limited his cultivation method and martial technique when they were displayed.

Clearly, Jun Tian also sensed Ye Yuan’s abnormality.

He smiled coldly and said, “Brat, do you feel very uncomfortable??Heh,?the 33 Heavens is the world of rules! There are no laws here, only rules! This place is heaven, the heaven that dominates a myriad of worlds! Entering here, all of your power will be infinitely suppressed! Right now, you can’t even fly. I want to see how you kill me!”

Finished talking, Jun Tian’s figure flashed, speeding away into the depths of the dense forest.

Ye Yuan just laughed coldly and urged the Heavenspan Mountain according to the spell recorded on the Heavenspan Mountain.

Swoosh!

The Heavenspan Mountain instantly turned into a streak of flowing light, chasing right after. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jun Tian was currently crying out in his heart about getting lucky when suddenly, he felt a powerful aura arrive with a howl from the rear.

He was seriously injured to begin with. His strength had greatly diminished.

At this time, how could he avoid it?

Boom!

The Heavenspan Mountain slammed right onto his body without the slightest surprise.

Jun Tian spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood and fell to the ground.

Ye Yuan walked over unhurriedly and said indifferently, “It doesn’t matter that my strength is suppressed. Don’t I still have the Heavenspan Mountain? Although I don’t know what grade of a treasure it is, being able to suppress a world, it’s definitely not what the long spear in your hands can compare to, isn’t that right? Therefore, I don’t need any cultivation method or martial technique at all. Directly using it to smash you will do.”

Seeing Ye Yuan walking over step by step, Jun Tian really got scared!

He underestimated the Heavenspan Mountain!

Yeah, Ye Yuan did not need to compete with whatever cultivation method or martial technique with him at all.

He just had to pick up the Heavenspan Mountain and smash people.

Simple, yet crude!

But very practical!

“Y-You can’t kill me!” Jun Tian gasped heavily for air.

“Oh??Why?” Ye Yuan said.

“I’m the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s outer-sect deacon. I have a life tablet in the sect. If you kill me, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect will definitely come and find you! Furthermore, the Heavenspan Mountain is the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s supreme treasure. If they know that you acquired the Heavenspan Mountain, they will definitely keep hunting you down! You can run, but what do you plan on doing with those people in the Heavenspan World?” Jun Tian hurriedly said.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, this was a troublesome thing.

However, Ye Yuan was naturally not willing to believe it easily.

When Jun Tian saw that Ye Yuan was moved, he hurriedly said, “You’ve felt Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s rule pressure too! If those friends of yours don’t break through to Heavenly Stratum Realm, it’s impossible to enter Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! Otherwise, they will be crushed into minced meat by the Great Dao rules here!”

“As long as you don’t kill me, I can let you plant an origin divinity will and become your servant! You’ll definitely be entering Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and know absolutely nothing about the things here. Just nice, you need a servant!”

There was an impulse to die in Jun Tian’s heart.

When he entered Heavenspan World previously, he was planning on taking Ye Yuan in as a servant.

Who knew that in a blink, he was actually going to take the initiative to become Ye Yuan’s servant? Such irony!

After Jun Tian finished talking, he looked at Ye Yuan eagerly, waiting for his decision.

Ye Yuan remained silent all along, also not knowing what he was thinking about.

Jun Tian’s heart was fidgety to the extreme.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said, “Is there a method that can let a wisp of spiritual consciousness regather the divine soul in this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven?”

Jun Tian hurriedly nodded and said, “Of course! Of course, there is! The 33 Heavens is the pinnacle of myriad worlds, the most primitive of the land of rules! Forget about just a wisp of spiritual consciousness remaining, even a dead person can be revived too!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he was wildly ecstatic in his heart.

However, he did not show it. He just said calmly,?“Oh??Then how can one regather the divine soul?”

“This … This …” Jun Tian smiled bitterly and said, “I’m just Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, belonging to the lowest level existence in the 33 Heavens. How would I know how to regather the divine soul, this kind of heaven-defying means?”

“Oh??Then it’s no use keeping you, go to hell then!” Ye Yuan said very calmly.
