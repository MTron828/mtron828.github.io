Chapter 2580: Whole Audience Bursting Into Laughter!

“Now, is there still any problem? If there isn’t, continue!” The protector said coolly.

What problem could there still be?

Already being leapfrogged by someone and defeated, having any more problems was making trouble out of nothing.

In the crowd, Ye Yuan was slightly surprised too.

That Yun Qing’s strength was indeed ridiculously strong.

If in the same realm, Ye Yuan had to expend some effort to win him too.

Of course, Ye Yuan broke through to upper Lesser Sublime Heaven now. Beating him was as easy as blowing off dust.

But he also saw through that the good and bad of this aptitude did not seem to have much to do with cultivation realm.

Without objections, the testings at the back would go much smoother.

But with close to a hundred people went up in a row, only a scanty few five people passed the assessment.

This ratio made everyone take a beating.

The aptitude that the array formation tested, the vast majority was lower-middle, or upper-inferior.

Even average was very few.

“Cheng Qian, pre-natal grade three lightning spirit Dao physique, lower-superior aptitude, affinity 35 points, pass!” Suddenly, the protector shouted.

A superior aptitude suddenly appeared, the crowd burst into an uproar all at once.

Even the protectors on the grandstand could not quite hold themselves back too.

Pre-natal Dao physiques were different from post-natal Dao physiques. The cultivation speed was extremely fast and the comprehension of rules was also much stronger than post-natal.

Finally, that Cheng Qian was taken in as a disciple by a purple-wing protector, directly becoming an inner disciple.

This scene also aroused the envy of many ascenders.

Later, more and more disciples passed. An upper-middle aptitude grade four pre-natal Dao physique even appeared among them, causing a bout of snatching.

“Mu Yun, innate … grade five Five Elements Dao physique, aptitude … upper-superior! Affinity … 60 points!” The protector looked at the light screen and could not help being in a daze.

He also did not expect that such a heaven-defying disciple would actually appear!

This time, no one from the protectors on the grandstand came out to snatch.

Because they all knew that this Mu Yun no longer belonged to them!

Mu Yun looked at the light screen, a little smugness could not help surfacing on his face.

He swept across all the way in the Lower Realms, reaching Heavenly Stratum.

Now, he still laughed proudly among heroes!

The protector said, “Mu Yun! You come to my side! I’ll send someone to report to the sect master about your aptitude!”

“Yes!” Mu Yun answered and stood beside the protector, overlooking the ascenders below.

At this time, he already soared to the sky with one bound!

The people below were all ants!

Those ascenders looked up to Mu Yun and actually somewhat felt ashamed of their unworthiness.

“Next!” The protector said.

“Let me try,” Ye Yuan suddenly stepped out of the ranks and said.

“It’s him! Little Cloud Courtyard’s master!”

“I’m really curious, the guy who could devastate the inner sect’s top three, wonder how his aptitude is!”

“Being able to enter Little Cloud Courtyard, his status is extraordinary to begin with! Heard that he was personally guided by Lord Luo Yunqing! I guess that it’s at least middle-superior aptitude too!”

… …

The moment Ye Yuan came out, it immediately caused a great sensation.

Even the protectors felt rather baffled too.

They rarely intervened in the competition between disciples.

As long as there were no deaths, they normally would not care.

So he did not know why Ye Yuan’s appearance would cause such a big stir.

Lu Zhanyuan suddenly came beside the protector and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Mo, if he fails the assessment, I’ll execute him!”

Lu Zhanyuan was the personal disciple of a Jade Sovereign Heaven elder, so he was in the same generation as Protector Mo, and addressed each other and senior and junior apprentice brothers.

Protector Mo looked at Lu Zhanyuan with some surprise. Seeing Lu Zhanyuan’s murderous gaze, he understood something.

He nodded and said, “Can!”

These words did not shun away from those ascenders.

Everyone heard it.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, his gaze revealing a hint of coldness.

The matter previously was just a dispute caused by personal feelings.

Ye Yuan made Lin Lan take action and also showed mercy.

But now, Lu Zhanyuan wanted to kill him so outrageously without any scruples. The nature was different.

Lu Zhanyuan looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Punk, you’d best pray that your aptitude is enough! Otherwise, the humiliation that you gave me needs to be repaid with death!”

Yao Qing’s expression changed greatly when he heard that and said to Protector Mo with clasped hands, “Protector Mo, Ye Yuan was personally led over by Lord Luo!”

Protector Mo’s expression changed, but he shook his head immediately and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Luo probably just did it conveniently. This can’t be taken seriously! A mere Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum isn’t sufficient to make him serious yet. Not entering the sect, Junior Apprentice Brother Lu isn’t subjected to the sect’s rules. He can naturally kill people!”

“This …” Yao Qing was directly choked to death.

Protector Mo looked at Ye Yuan and said indifferently, “If you don’t want to die, just pray that your aptitude is sufficient then.”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “He wants to kill me, then if I kill him?”

Protector Mo’s gaze turned sharp and he could not help laughing as he said, “This joke isn’t funny at all!”

“He’s not joking! I’m … not his match! However, this guy is too despicable, he used poison to deal with me, it’s impossible to guard against!” Lu Zhanyuan’s face turned red as he quibbled.

Protector Mo was taken aback when he heard it, thinking to himself how strong a poison could a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum use?

Lu Zhanyuan said viciously, “Therefore, I specially went to invite Senior Apprentice Brother Han to do it on my behalf!”

The Senior Apprentice Brother Han that Lu Zhanyuan spoke of was a red-wing protector, Lu Zhanyuan’s fellow senior apprentice brother.

Protector Mo became somewhat curious, just what peculiar aspects did this Ye Yuan have?

“No matter what, wait until after he passes through the array formation before talking!” Protector Mo said.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and stepped into the array formation.

After ten breaths, Ye Yuan walked out of the array formation.

Very soon, the light screen displayed his aptitude.

Then, the whole audience was deathly silent.

Ye Yuan looked at the words on the light screen and could not help smiling bitterly.

Sure enough, as he expected!

Dao physique: none.

Aptitude: lower-inferior.

Affinity: four points.

Dao physique, aptitude, affinity, everything was the worst out of all present.

Not one of!

Terrible until it made one’s hair stand on end!

The others, the worst was also middle-inferior.

But he was lower-inferior aptitude!

Actually, Ye Yuan was mentally prepared before.

His background was seriously too lousy!

Suddenly, bursts of laughter erupted from the crowd.

Many people even tear up from laughing.

“Pfft! Hahaha?… I’m dying of laughter! I’m really dying of laughter! This guy is actually … is actually lousy to such an extent! I didn’t expect that Senior Apprentice Brother Luo also has times when he makes an error of judgment!” Lu Zhanyuan immediately burst out laughing when he saw this sight.

He laughed himself into fits, even tears came out.

This aptitude was really the worst in history! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He was still worried previously. Ye Yuan being able to be regarded highly by Luo Yunqing, he reckoned that his aptitude would be high.

But now, it was not a problem of whether it met the standards or not, but a question of how ridiculous it was.

“It’s really killing me! I didn’t expect that among ascenders, there’s actually someone with such a poor aptitude!”

“Hahaha?… to think that I thought that he was an expert who kept to his own counsel, didn’t expect that it’s actually terrible until like this!”

“This guy pretended to be mysterious. Actually, he’s afraid of losing face, right? This talent is really incredible!”

… …

Even those ascenders who were eliminated also jeered at Ye Yuan endlessly.

This kind of aptitude was not on the same level as them at all!
