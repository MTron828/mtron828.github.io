Chapter 2541: I’m Shielding the Tang Family!

“You’re betting with the lives of everyone in the Tang Family! Furthermore, it’s a sure-lose situation! As an ascender, what capital does he have to dare fight with the entire royal family??Heh,?maybe he already slipped away for good now!” Tang Jinhua shouted angrily.

This was a gamble without any chance of winning. He knew that Ye Yuan was strong, but Ye Yuan was too weak in front of the royal family!

One had to know, just the royal family’s Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouses were plenty!

A middle Lesser Sublime Heaven entering the palace at night and even wanted to meet Second Prince, wasn’t this a joke?

This was probably just Ye Yuan’s excuse!

Tang Yu shook his head and said, “No! Ye Yuan isn’t this kind of person! When he came out of Inklight Forest, Yang Xuezhen just took him for a ride and he helped Yang Xuezhen clear all obstacles!”

Tang Jinhua said with a cold smile, “That’s because his strength was sufficient! But, you tell me, what does he have to contend with the royal family?

Tang Yu fell silent!

This father and son two people argued endlessly, neither able to convince the other.

“Who is it?!”

Suddenly, Tang Yu shuddered and shot to his feet.

Only at this time, did he suddenly realize that there was an extra person in the room!

Focusing his eyes and looking, who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

“B-Big Brother? W-When did you come?” Tang Yu said in surprise.

“Came for some time already,” Ye Yuan slowly walked out of the shadows and said lightly.

While Tang Jinhua’s entire body trembled, thinking to himself if his words earlier were all heard by Ye Yuan.

How did this guy enter the room without a sound?

If not for Ye Yuan taking the initiative to reveal his figure, the two of them would not have been able to discover him at all!

Tang Yu’s expression was very ugly and he said, “Big Brother, Father is concerned about the safety of the Tang Family and was a little harsh with his words. I … I apologize on his behalf.”

Actually, Tang Yu did not understand Ye Yuan.

He only knew that Ye Yuan acted mercilessly.

After all, the lesson learned from the Gui Family was right there.

Therefore, he had more fear toward Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No need to apologize. I won’t do anything to the Tang Family. Alright, it’s getting late, rest early.”

Finished speaking, Ye Yuan’s figure directly disappeared into the night.

The father and son two people exchanged glances with horror on their faces.

“H-Has he left?” Tang Jinhua said with ragged breathing.

Tang Yu smiled bitterly as he shook his head and said, “Should have left?”

Tang Jinhua’s expression was ugly as he said, “Then … has he succeeded or not?”

Tang Yu smiled bitterly again and said, “I reckon that he came to find us to talk about this matter. But hearing the words earlier, he couldn’t be bothered to say anymore. It’s considered … a warning to us.”

“How on earth did he come in just now? I actually didn’t detect it at all!”

“If even you can detect it, how can he have the courage to barge into the royal palace alone? You also know that Second Prince’s master is that person!”

“Hence, I feel that he definitely failed! He can hide from us, but can he also hide from Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses? Let alone that there are also so many experts in the palace!”

Tang Yu’s expression flickered slightly. To be honest, he did not have any confidence himself.

In the end, he could only let out a sigh and said, “Forget it, it’s also useless to think so much. Wait for tomorrow!”

… …

The next day, before the morning sun rose, a sedan chair already stopped at the entrance of the Tang Manor.

After receiving the report, Tang Jinhua and Tang Yu both got a big shock and hurriedly went out to welcome.

“Tang Jinhua (Tang Yu), pays respect to Second Prince, Your Highness, and Master Yun!” The two directly gave a big bow as they said.

Second Prince’s expression was rather tired. Clearly, his frame of mind was not very good.

But, seeing the two people bow, he had a stomach full of anger that had nowhere to vent and could only say, “Get up, go in and talk!?Uh?… Master Yun wants to meet Ye Yuan!”

Tang Yu hurriedly said, “Yes, I’ll go and invite Big Brother right away!”

Finished saying, Tang Jinhua led the two into the study, while Tang Yu went straight to Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion venue.

The moment Second Prince took his seat, he directly opened his mouth and said, “Last night, Ye Yuan and I have met!”

Although he already guessed in his heart, when Tang Jinhua heard this sentence, he was still shocked speechless for a long while.

“This …How is this possible? Could it be that … Master Yun wasn’t in the palace last night?” Tang Jinhua said in shock.

Second Prince sneered and said, “Are you playing the fool here despite understanding??Heh,?your Tang Family really found a huge backer!”

Tang Jinhua was frightened until he directly knelt down and said, “Second Prince, please explain. This lowly one … really doesn’t know!”

Second Prince could not help feeling a little surprised when he saw Tang Jinhua’s appearance.

It seemed like he really did not know.

“Forget it, forget it! Get up! Jasper Regeneration Pill’s heavenly medicines, I’ve already ordered people to deliver them! Coming today is primarily because Master Yun wants to meet this Ye Yuan!” Second Prince said.

Just as he was talking, Tang Yu entered, his expression not too good.

Honestly speaking, he really did not want to offend Second Prince too badly.

But now, it was not up to him anymore!

“Your Highness, Big Brother said, have … have Master Yun go see him himself!” Tang Yu said awkwardly.

Making a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse go and see a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, what haughty airs!

But he had no choice!

Ye Yuan’s words, he did not dare to not listen.

But he knew in his heart that since Second Prince came, it showed that Ye Yuan really succeeded yesterday!

It was just that, he still felt that it was too incredulous thinking about it.

The moment Second Prince heard, he almost stomped his foot.

Rather, it was Lu Yun who was very calm. Holding Second Prince down, he said coolly, “Lead the way!”

Tang Yu heaved a sigh of relief and led Lu Yun to Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion venue.

“Big Brother!”

“Come in!”

Tang Yu pushed the door and entered, Lu Yun followed inside.

There was dim lighting in the house, it was not bright. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Big Brother?” After Tang Yu entered, he discovered that Ye Yuan was not there at all!

Lu Yun’s brows furrowed slightly. Going one round around the room, he did not discover Ye Yuan’s traces.

But the voice just now clearly came from inside the house!

“What a fine concealing art, looks like Yu Tang really didn’t lie! You wandered around in front of this old man and this old man actually didn’t even know!” Lu Yun said to the air.

But at this moment, on the seat not far away from Lu Yun, Ye Yuan’s figure appeared.

When Tang Yu saw this scene, his eyes went wide.

Only then was he absolutely sure that Lu Yun was really present at the place!

But even he did not discover Ye Yuan!

Furthermore, hearing Lu Yun’s words just now, Ye Yuan actually strolled around in front of him.

But Lu Yun still did not react at all.

This level of concealment technique was absolutely incredible!

If Ye Yuan really wanted to kill Second Prince, no matter how many experts he had protecting him, it was in vain too!

Seeing Ye Yuan reveal his figure, Lu Yun’s pupils constricted and he said in surprise, “Excellent spatial rule! Boy, your application of spatial rule is already transcendent! No wonder you have such haughty airs!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “It’s not that I have haughty airs. I just want to tell you, I’m shielding the Tang Family! If Second Prince has any devious thoughts, he might be gone someday. Of course, if you’re not sensible, maybe one day … you’ll be gone too!”
