Chapter 1496 King of Blood Battle

The Blood Battle Stage was a killing field, just like an underground boxing city.

The Blood Yama Hall had hauled in no idea how much money by relying on it.

Every day, hundreds and thousands of life-and-death battles had taken place here.

The aristocrats gambled here to seek amusement, the boxers earned money here with their lives.

Of course, there were also quite a few nobles who would personally take the field and fight, to hone themselves.

Some people died in battle just like that; while others carved out a bloody path.

Ka Xin was one of them!

In Capone Capital City’s Blood Battle Stage, Ka Xin was still a legend to this day.

Back then, when Ka Xin was not a prince yet, his reputation was not illustrious among his many brothers.

However, he was very ruthless to himself.

He came to the Blood Battle Stage alone by himself without even bringing along a guard, and he became a blood fighter.

Blood fighters were existences for people’s enjoyment.

They engaged in life-and-death struggles on the Blood Battle Stage every day, while the nobles gambled exorbitant amounts on the grandstand.

Since then, Ka Xin started his path of heaven-defying rise.

It was also this Blood Battle Stage that excavated his terrifying combat talent.

At first, Ka Xin’s dozen over battles in a row were all close shaves.

Each time, he would barely manage to escape with his life from under his opponent’s hands.

Virtually everyone all thought that he would not live long.

However, one battle after another, his improvement speed was rapid until it made people despair.

Ten years later, Ka Xin defeated countless powerhouse adversaries, sweeping across same-rank opponents.

From the earlier bitter fights to virtually having no opponent capable of lasting one exchange with him!

Experiencing countless life-and-death battles, Ka Xin’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds, daunting until it made his opponents despair.

However, this was not the end.

After that, the Ka Xin who was already the Blood Battle Stage’s king started jumping realms to challenge his opponents!

This crazed action made everyone all think that he was seeking death.

But he did not die. His name lived for a hundred years on the ring.

All the way until one day, no one dared to fight him anymore!

Starting from no idea when, Ka Xin had not lost before.

Later, the Blood Battle Stage looked over the records before discovering that Ka Xin had already won 800 over matches in a row!

One had to know that in this place where experts were plentiful as clouds, even winning a hundred matches in a row was an extremely extravagant matter.

But Ka Xin won 800 over matches in a row!

Furthermore, his opponents were virtually all powerhouses who were all a minor realm higher than him!

From then, Ka Xin had a nickname: the King of Blood Battle.

This was a legend!

The respect of Fan Yu and the rest toward Ka Xin was not because he was the City Lord Manor’s prince, but because they feared his strength!

They were very strong too, but they were absolutely not as crazy as Ka Xin.

The news of the ‘King of Blood Battle’ re-emerging immediately ignited the Blood Battle Stage, making everyone seethe.

‘Source Night’ this name had merely just circulated among the upper echelons of Capone Capital City.

But ‘King of Blood Battle’ this name, virtually no one did not know in Capone Capital City.

Source Night and Ka Xin would be carrying out a life-and-death battle at the Blood Battle Stage. As soon as this news spread out, the Blood Battle Stage crazily seized 30 billion low-grade fiend essence stones within three days!

90% of the people all bought the ‘King of Blood Battle’, Ka Xin’s victory.

Even if Ka Xin’s odds were only 1:1.

Of course, there were also quite a few speculators who wagered on Ye Yuan. His odds were too tempting.

1:15!

This was a 15 times profit!

Once won, then it was a huge profit.

When the positions just opened, Ye Yuan’s odds were 1:7.

But in three days, the people who bought Ye Yuan were few and far between. Ye Yuan’s odds also soared along with it, surging to 1:15.

To the Blood Battle Stage, Ye Yuan was an out-and-out newbie. He was completely without any battle achievements’ support.

The odds looked scary, but actually, not many people would go and bet on him at all.

The higher the odds, it indicated the less optimistic the Blood Battle Stage was about him.

People who bought Ye Yuan’s victory were all harboring the mentality of a trace of a fluke.

Even if they bought, they would not buy a lot too.

At this time, inside a room at the Blood Battle Stage, the Blood Battle Stage’s hall master, Bloodeagle, appeared somewhat irritated.

“You Ming, do you have confidence in this life-and-death battle or not? This position, I was originally not planning on opening it. No idea how upstairs is thinking, to actually insist on opening the positions! Now, it has staked so high. I already find it hard to dismount the tiger’s back! It’s just a few short day’s time and it’s already 30 billion. Most likely, on the closing day, the exposure risk will rise to 100 billion or even more! If that Source Night loses, our Blood Battle Stage’s three years of profits will all sink into the water!” Bloodeagle said in a solemn voice.

You Ming said coolly, “This kind of life-and-death battle, not reaching the last moment, who’d know who wins or loses?”

Bloodeagle nearly choked and said, “You Ming, your words are also said too irresponsibly! Ka Xin’s strength, you’re all too clear. It can be said to be invincible among the same-rank! The letter of challenge was issued by you, don’t you know that Source Night’s strength?”

You Ming gave Bloodeagle and glance and said coolly, “Bloodeagle, don’t be so agitated. I can only tell you that Ye Yuan’s chances of winning are greater than you imagine. As for who wins or loses between the two of them, it’s really very hard to predict.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

From a rational point of view, You Ming really could not see any chance of Ye Yuan winning.

But, when he recalled that calm expression of Ye Yuan’s, he also felt that Ye Yuan definitely had a plan.

This kind of contradictory psychology had already lingered in his heart for a year, making him very uncomfortable.

He believed that the other two guys were definitely the same as him.

Blood Battle Stage’s Bloodeagle was originally just an outsider. But this time, he was dragged down the water too.

The moment the positions opened, he had no way to back down anymore.

You Ming was also very perplexed why upstairs would want to send this order, making them open the positions.

Honestly speaking, Ye Yuan’s win-rate was really too small.

Unless, that packet of powder could greatly diminish Ka Xin’s strength.

However, Ka Xin had already eaten that packet of powder for several months. Right now, there was no problem at all, he was still brimming with vigor and vitality.

This showed that Ye Yuan did not bluff him. That powder really would not affect Ka Xin’s strength.

You Ming’s attitude made Bloodeagle about to stomp his feet. He roared at You Ming, “Win-rate greater than I imagine? You Ming, you’re a dotard, right?! If this Source Night’s realm was more or less the same as Ka Xin’s realm, then forget it. But he’s just a middle-rank Fiend General! Even when Ka Xin himself was at this realm, it’s also impossible to jump realms and defeat himself, right?”

You Ming rolled his eyes and said coolly, “It also wasn’t me who made you open the positions, what are you yelling at me for?”

Bloodeagle could not help choking up and immediately shriveled up.

You Ming gave him a glance and said, “Just three years of profit, it’s also not a big deal. You guys are the most profitable hall, it’s merely a little bit that leaked out at the seams of the pants. I reckon that upstairs is betting too. You think about it. Once Source Night wins, how much money will you all make!”

Bloodeagle gave a cold snort and said, “Said it lightly! Your halls only know how to burn money, don’t know our pains! I watched Ka Xin grow up with my own eyes. His strength, I’m all too aware. Even if that Source Night is a second Ka Xin, it’s also impossible to win him with his realm! These 100 billion essence stones will most likely sink into the waters this time!”
