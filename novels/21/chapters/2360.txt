Chapter 2366: Ancestor Lightning’s Promise!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets gave Ancestor Lightning a deep look but did not stop him.

A Dao Ancestor is this world’s apex existence. Even the divine race powerhouses did not dare to easily take action.

He had this qualification.

Although speaking up at this time, his manner of eating was a little ugly.

But who dared to comment about him?

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets would still give him this bit of face, as long as he did not interfere with the spot of the supreme inheritance.

But in the Primeval War Realm, it was already completely boiling over with excitement!

“Ancestor Lightning! It’s Ancestor Lightning who spoke in person!”

“Looks like Ancestor Lightning really regards Pang Zhen highly!”

“This Ye Yuan is really impressive, to actually force Ancestor Lightning to personally speak up! He could choose not to give face to Heavenly Emperor Myriad Spirit, but a Dao Ancestor’s face, he shouldn’t dare to not give, right?”

... ...

Being able to force a Dao Ancestor to intercede for a junior, this in itself was a talent of cosmic proportions.

At least, among these million unpredictable children, no one could do this except for Ye Yuan.

After all, Pang Zhen was a powerhouse who had a chance to compete for the supreme inheritance.

But hearing this, Pang Zhen himself almost wanted to vomit blood.

Humiliating!

“Didn’t expect that I, Pang Zhen, actually fell to the extent of needing Ancestor to speak up!” Pang Zhen secretly hated it in his heart.

When Ye Yuan heard this, he was stunned too.

He was still curious why Pang Zhen’s lightning law could be so strong. He did not think that he was actually Ancestor Lightning’s descendant.

Ancestor Lightning speaking up, Ye Yuan also fell into silence.

Everyone was watching him, waiting for him to speak.

After a long time, Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Letting him enter the top 11, I can do that. But I need a promise from Ancestor Lightning!”

Everyone opened their mouths wide, with looks of disbelief.

This guy was actually bargaining with a Dao Ancestor?

His guts were too plucky!

This time, it was Ancestor Lightning’s turn to be silent.

“Speak! As long as it’s not too overboard, this ancestor can agree to it!” Ancestor Lightning said after thinking about it.

Ye Yuan said, “I wish to ask Ancestor Lightning to help me retrieve a Tear of Life!”

When Ancestor Lightning heard this, he paused distinctly, and said, “A Tear of Life! Heh, brat, what high-sounding sentiments you have! Do you really know what a Tear of Life is?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I naturally know! Hence, that’s why I need to request Ancestor Lightning to take action!”

He was not that ignorant person from long ago anymore and naturally understood about the Tear of Life.

This thing was a product above rules; valuable until it made people’s hair stand on end!

It would only appear once every 100 million years.

And this thing had never flowed out to the outside world before either.

There were only legends in the outside world.

This thing only existed in the hands of Dao Ancestors!

Ancestor Lightning’s tone was somewhat cold and he said, “This can’t be done. Change to another one!”

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Sorry about it, this Ye has no other request, I only ask for the Tear of Life. Since Senior can’t do it, then this Ye won’t show mercy anymore either.”

As he said, he actually urged the sword formation again, planning on killing Pang Zhen.

Everyone was stunned!

This guy was really too impressive!

That was a Dao Ancestor! He actually did not give any face at all!

“Brat, you dare!” Above the void, came Ancestor Lightning’s furious voice.

Ye Yuan just said coolly, “These 17 people wanted to kill me. Pang Zhen and Yu Tanzhe were the instigators. Since the grudges are already formed, why should I let them get the inheritance? Although Senior might have a paramount status, you want this Ye to give in with all talk but no promises. Sorry, I can’t do it!”

As he said, Ye Yuan pointed at the void, countless sword lights rushed over towards Pang Zhen.

The million unpredictable children watched until they stared dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

Nine great Dao Ancestors, those were true sovereigns, supreme masters!

They were this Heavenspan World’s apex existences.

The population of the Heavenspan World was trillions upon trillions, but there were only nine people who were able to reach this realm.

Their words were the imperial decree. It represented Heavenly Dao.

Now, Ye Yuan was actually going to kill Pang Zhen in front of him!

Even Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets also had a glassy expression on his face.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually so unyielding.

The face of a Dao Ancestor, not giving face as he pleased. It was really mind-blowing.

One had to know, even he had to show Dao Ancestors some face!

Of course, while surprise was surprise, he also guarded against Ancestor Lightning.

If he dared to make a move, he would be taking action.

He started the battle of geniuses this time for the human race’s matter of fundamental importance, and not for Ancestor Lightning alone.

Now, Ye Yuan had clearly already obtained the position of the supreme inheritance. He would never allow Ancestor Lightning to break the rules.

Ancestor Lightning gave him a glance, seemingly knowing what he was thinking, and suddenly spoke up, “Stop! The Tear of Life might appear again within a thousand years! This ancestor can promise you that when the time comes, I can help you to take action once! As for whether it succeeds or not, it will depend on your own good fortune! This is already my bottom-line!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he smiled brilliantly and said, “Okay, deal! Senior, please swear a Heavenly Dao Oath! When taking action this time, you must do your best!”

Ancestor Lightning’s face was black, but he still swore the Heavenly Dao Oath.

After Ye Yuan finished hearing the Heavenly Dao Oath, he also finally set his mind at ease.

In order to revive Mu Lingxue, forget about offending Ancestor Lightning, even if it was poking a hole in the sky, he would go and do it too.

Obtaining Ancestor Lightning’s promise, Ye Yuan’s sword formation suddenly turned its spearhead around and rushed towards the others.

However, after killing one person, he killed Pang Zhen off without the slightest hesitation.

Finally, Pang Zhen was ranked 11th, obtaining the last inheritance spot.

When Ancestor Lightning saw this scene, his expression was livid with rage.

This brat really did not know life from death!

Couldn’t you let Pang Zhen lose a little more beautifully?

Getting a second place or a third place was good too!

The following battles already did not have the least bit of suspense. Ye Yuan rushed over one by one, killing off the 17 children very quickly.

Inside the huge cage, there was only Ye Yuan and Wan Zhen left.

“Huhu, I didn’t expect that in the end, it’s still Brother Wan and me facing off!” Ye Yuan said with a laugh.

Wan Zhen smiled bitterly and said, “I also didn’t expect that you actually used this kind of method to have a showdown with me in the end. In just a few days, I’m already far from being your match anymore!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Without fighting, who knows? Brother Wan is the most talented person that this Ye has ever seen!”

Wan Zhen felt touched, Ye Yuan was giving him face.

Actually, at this point, fighting or not was already not important anymore.

No one would think that he could win against Ye Yuan. Even he himself did not believe it.

But Ye Yuan was giving him face.

Ye Yuan did not even give a Dao Ancestor face, but Ye Yuan gave him face!

He suddenly discovered that Ye Yuan was someone who was extremely principled.

What he did not like, even if you pressed a blade against his neck, he would not shrink back too.

What he liked, even if you fought against the whole world, he would fight with you too!

This friend was worth making!

Suddenly, he was filled with lofty sentiments and laughed loudly as he said, “Okay, then let’s decide the victor! This time, don’t hold back anymore!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “As it should be!”

The two people’s great battle lasted for a whole day and night!

Ye Yuan did not go easy, Wan Zhen was well-deserving of being the most troublesome character among the unpredictable children.

All the way until the end, he whittled away Wan Zhen’s divine essence, before he slew him!

Coming this far, the curtains finally fell on the battle of geniuses!
