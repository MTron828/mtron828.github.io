Chapter 2346: Time Law Fragments!

Jiang Zhe’s pupils constricted, his eyes full of horror.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s spatial law was actually so formidable, catching up to him in a blink of an eye.

Puchi!

Sword light flashed, Jiang Zhe was directly killed.

Following that, Ye Yuan took another step out and caught up to another source powerhouse.

Once these few people’s strength was scattered, how could they be Ye Yuan’s match?

Ye Yuan killed four people in a row like chopping vegetables.

While the other three people were tied down by Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck, and they were unable to get away for some time.

Ye Yuan rushed back again and slew the three people together with Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck.

Eight great source powerhouses, there was actually not a single one who escaped.

In Cloudaid City, Jiang Zhe and the rest had lingering fear in their hearts, having horrified expressions on their faces.

“Really damn unlucky! To actually encounter such a freakish brat!” Jiang Zhe had a grim look as he said.

A source powerhouse said with a bitter smile, “Where did this kid pop out from? He’s also too monstrous, right? Other people spend their entire lives and only comprehend one power of source. But he’s too talented! One person comprehended two! That’s not all; he even comprehended spatial law to such a high boundary, and even comprehended Heavenly Dao True Word!”

Looking at his expression, it was obvious he suffered a tremendous blow.

Even though they gathered eight source powerhouses, source powerhouses were also extremely rare existences among the unpredictable children.

They could be said to be geniuses among geniuses, monsters among monsters.

However, they all, these geniuses, monsters, all became dim and full under Ye Yuan’s light.

“Damn it! Really stepped on dog shit when we went out! This kid’s strength can probably already rank in the top 4000! It’s also that his cultivation realm is too low; otherwise, even assaulting the God of War Golden List is also nothing difficult!” Lin Zhan said unhappily.

God of War Golden List, it was released once every 100 years.

This list only tabulated the unpredictable children within the top 3000.

Only people whose god of war points ranked in the top 3000 had the qualifications to be tallied in.

The unpredictable children who could enter the God of War Golden List, each one was an expert among experts, a genius among geniuses.

However, this so-called God of War Golden List was just Cloudaid City’s sub-list. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Forget it, forget it, when we see this kid in the future, directly make a detour! Encounter the Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck, also directly make a detour! Can’t provoke, we can avoid!” Jiang Zhe said helplessly.

... ...

Killing eight source powerhouses in one breath, Ye Yuan’s god of war points soared crazily and broke through 5000 points very soon.

Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck husband and wife two people were also stunned.

They said to protect Ye Yuan inside this Sun Moon Canyon. In the end, it was Ye Yuan who saved them.

When Ye Yuan was fighting with them before, he did not even take out half of his strength.

Otherwise, the result would be totally different.

“Young Friend Ye, it was us husband and wife two people who didn’t know what’s good for us. This time, thank you very much for lending a helping hand. We’re definitely becoming friends with Young Friend Ye! After going to the real world in the future, you must come and find the two of us to play,” Heaven Mandarin said.

Although the two of their personalities were peculiar, they were not unable to tell what was good for them.

Ye Yuan clearly did not want to stoop to their level. If they went from bad to worse, that would not be good.

The two of them did provoke many powerful enemies, but it was also not like they provoked everyone. Otherwise, they would have long kicked the bucket.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Definitely! This Ye still has to go cultivate and will take my leave here.”

Bidding farewell to the two, Ye Yuan headed toward the depths of Sun Moon Canyon.

In the dense woods, a lion-shaped fierce beast came out with a roar.

A Battle Xuan Beast! Ye Yuan found intel about this fierce beast from the information.

This Battle Xuan Beast’s strength was very strong and not weaker than source powerhouses.

What was even more terrifying was that this Battle Xuan Beast was able to control time law; extremely hard to deal with.

Ye Yuan expended some effort before killing it too.

“Killing such a powerful fierce beast and I only got three god of war points. Looks like the god of war points obtained from Jiang Zhe they all were too many. Mn? What’s this?”

Ye Yuan was currently lamenting about the god of war points when suddenly, he discovered that some mysterious and profound thing entered his body.

“That’s ... law fragment? A fragment of time law! Unfortunately, there are too few law fragments. I’m unable to comprehend them at all.”

Ye Yuan identified what this thing was very quickly and could not help being very excited.

But very soon, he felt dejected.

This law fragment was too small, it was simply impossible to be comprehended.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he said, “I wonder if the time laws in all of the Battle Xuan Beasts are the same or not. If they are not the same, then can one piece together a complete time law?”

Getting to work at once, he started searching for Battle Xuan Beast to proceed with hunting.

Battle Xuan Beasts were very rare, but one could always encounter them.

After more than ten days, Ye Yuan hunted another Battle Xuan Beast.

Then he became incomparably excited. It was because these two extremely tiny time fragments really merged together.

“Heh, excellent! This way, as long as I continue hunting Battle Xuan Beasts, I can always piece together a small piece of time law!” Ye Yuan said excitedly.

Feeling the flow of time here, Ye Yuan became very covetous of time law. He did not expect that there was really an opportunity to comprehend it.

Time law was very vague and insubstantial, but this small fragment was different.

It was tantamount to a reification of the power of law and could let martial artists directly view the mysteries of time law.

Of course, even so, wanting to comprehend time law was still as hard as ascending to heaven.

After all, this was the Heavenspan World’s hardest law to comprehend, not one of!

Even spatial law still had some disparity in front of time law.

Ye Yuan finally understood why there were so many source powerhouses here!

Looks like these geniuses obtained the other party’s law fragments after hunting fierce beasts, which allowed them to break through the shackle, reaching the realm of source.

Ye Yuan previously still found it strange. The source powerhouses here were a little too many.

“Starting from today, hunt Battle Xuan Beasts!” Ye Yuan immediately decided.

Arriving at the Primeval War Realm, even if he did not gain anything, merely a time law was also worth it.

However, Ye Yuan discovered very soon that the number of Battle Xuan Beasts was seriously too few. His efficiency of hunting was too low.

Hence, he simply returned to Cloudaid City and released a mission.

As long as someone could provide intel about Battle Xuan Beasts, after confirming it, he would give the other party 100 god of war points.

Very soon, the entire Cloudaid City knew that Ye Yuan was hunting Battle Xuan Beasts.

But what followed was everyone’s ridiculing.

“Heh heh, truly a fool who overestimates his own ability! Does he really think that time law is so easy to comprehend?”

“This kid actually released such a mission, what a moron. Who does he think he is? Something that even Wan Zhen doesn’t dare to touch, he dares to touch too!”

“I heard that Wan Zhen pieced together a whole piece of time law at that time and gained nothing after comprehending for several decades. In the end, he still gave up! This kid is also thinking too highly of himself.”

... ...

The Wan Zhen everyone talked about, was the number one major power on the God of War Golden List rankings.

To be able to rank first on the God of War Golden List, his talent could be imagined.

But even such talent also ended in failure. So what did Ye Yuan count as?
