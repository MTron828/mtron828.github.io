Chapter 2931: Smoking!

“Congratulations, Brother Qin! From now on, the skies will be vast with brilliant prospects, the seas wide for fishes to leap about!” Zhou Yu’s expression was somewhat unnatural as he said.

Merely several days ago, he and Qin Shitian were still almost on par.

But, a few days later, the two were already the difference between a firefly and the bright moon.

He Chen’s expression was awkward too, stepping forward to congratulate.

Who knew that Qin Shitian’s expression turned dark, a powerful surge of soul force exploding with a loud bang.

Zhou Yu and He Chen, two people, gave a muffled groan and were immediately blasted flying.

“Dog-like things! Who the hell do the two of you think you are to be worthy of addressing me as your brother?” Qin Shitian immediately fell out.

Being slapped in public, their soul bodies already sustained heavy injuries.

Zhou Yu two people felt ashamed and resentful, but they did not dare to flare up too. They could only crawl to their feet again and said with a bow, “C-Congratulations, Young Emperor!”

Ten wroughts had an extremely high status in the soul race. It was equivalent to a Great Emperor in reserve.

Therefore, they were respectfully called Young Emperor. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Shitian was surly in nature. In his eyes, only people with strength similar to him were fit to call him as their brother.

Previously, these two people had similar strength as him. He naturally did not think otherwise.

But now, this ‘Brother Qin’ sounded like sarcasm to him.

However, even if Qin Shitian was arrogant to this extent, no one dared to say anything too.

It was just that some people who originally wanted to come forward to congratulate did not dare to come forward anymore.

After all, his current strength and status were already completely different!

Before long, Qin Shitian would definitely enter the core of the soul race and go further and further away from them.

This was a heavenly figure!

Great Emperor Westdawn’s expression was also somewhat unnatural. Coughing dryly twice, he said, “Martial Nephew doesn’t need to get angry. You’re currently already someone above the clouds. Why is there a need to stoop to their level?”

Woodrelease was also slightly awkward as he said, “Right, right. Toward two kids who don’t know any better, Martial Nephew doesn’t need to be like this.”

Ten wroughts powerhouse was indeed the honor of Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall.

But, even if it was a Great Emperor, they did not dare to easily offend one too.

Qin Shitian gave Zhou Yu they all a slap each. How was it not slapping the two of their faces?

But they had no choice either.

From now on, Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall still needed Qin Shitian to help out.

The present Qin Shitian had truly soared to the heavens in one bound!

Qin Shitian gave a cold snort and said, “If not for looking on the account of two martial uncles’ faces, I’d definitely teach them a lesson!”

Suddenly, he seemed to have remembered something. Looking toward Ye Yuan’s Soul Refining Furnace, he could not help smiling. “He thought that he could use 42 kinds of Dao fires to entrap me to death. But he didn’t expect that it would help me to achieve my aim, right? In the end, he himself died inside! Actually, 35 kinds of Dao fires, even if he can’t break through to ten wroughts, there’s no problem coming out.”

Great Emperor Eastsun nodded slightly, and deeply felt that way too as he said, “Although he’s much worse when compared to you, he’s considered a genius too! It’s just a shame. He lost to himself.”

Qin Shitian laughed loudly and said, “Someone who is already dead, care about him for what! From now on, it’s my, Qin Shitian’s, era!”

The current Qin Shitian was full of high spirits.?Who else but me could do it?

Those examinees no longer had the qualifications to come forward and congratulate.

Nirvana Soul Hall’s Emperor Realm powerhouses came forward to give felicitations one after another.

Qin Shitian became everyone’s nucleus.

Even Great Emperor Eastsun was worse off compared to him too.

Great Emperor Eastsun did not mind. Qin Shitian was his disciple. He could not run away.

However, his gaze swept in the direction of the Soul Refining Furnace, and his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

This was because he saw the 34th kind of Dao fire descending!

“Eh,?strange, logically speaking, Ye Yuan is dead. Shouldn’t the Soul Refining Furnace’s Dao fires be extinguished? Why is the Dao fire still increasing?”

By the side, when Westdawn and the rest heard Great Emperor Eastsun’s words, they were extremely surprised, looking over one after another.

Inside the Soul Refining Furnace, Ye Yuan’s soul body had already completely disappeared.

Therefore, everyone thought that he was already dead.

But the 34th kind of Dao fire had truly descended!

“Could it be that he’s not dead yet?”

“How is that possible? His soul body has already completely dissipated. He’s clearly completely dead already!”

“But how do you explain why the Dao fires in the Soul Refining Furnace haven’t gone out yet?”

“There wouldn’t be some problem with the Soul Refining Furnace, right?”

… …

A phenomenon that they could not explain appeared.

Even the few Great Emperors were very perplexed too.

“Brother Eastsun, is there something wrong with the Soul Refining Furnace? Why don’t you cast a spell to interrupt the Soul Refining Furnace, let the Dao fires extinguish,” Great Emperor Westdawn said.

As the hall master, he naturally had the authority to control these Soul Refining Furnace projections.

When Eastsun heard that, he nodded his head and fired out one soul seal after another.

However, in the next moment, Ye Yuan’s Soul Refining Furnace suddenly erupted with a dazzling light.

Great Emperor Eastsun gave a muffled groan, his entire person falling several steps back in a row. His soul body became much more illusory too. Clearly, he had sustained considerable injuries.

The other people’s expressions changed one after another.

“What’s wrong, Brother Eastsun?” Westdawn asked.

Great Emperor Eastsun shook his head and said, “I don’t know. The Soul Refining Furnace has already broken away from my control. It gave me a backlash just now!”

Westdawn’s pupils constricted, and he said in astonishment, “How is this possible! You’re the hall master. You have the authority to control the Soul Refining Furnace!”

Great Emperor Eastsun smiled bitterly and said, “Now, it’s no longer what I can control! It can only depend on when the Soul Refining Furnace stops by itself. But I hope that nothing bad happens.”

Everyone started to panic.

Now, something that even the hall master could not control had appeared!

Qin Shitian’s expression was somewhat ugly.

This Ye Yuan really left no peace even after he died!

I’m a ten wroughts powerhouse now. Being Lord Young Emperor is right when one is like the noonday sun. Shouldn’t I be enjoying everyone’s admiration?

But all these were ruined by Ye Yuan!

Rumble?…

Suddenly, the Soul Refining Furnace started trembling intensely, as if it might explode at any time.

Everyone’s faces changed again, staring at the Soul Refining Furnace with vigilance looks.

Unknown things always made people afraid.

Very soon, four hours passed, the 44th kind of Dao fire descended!

Hence, the Soul Refining Furnace’s trembling became even more intense.

The current Soul Refining Furnace was like a machine that would never rest. Nobody could stop it.

45th kind, 46th kind, 47th kind, 48th kind, 49th kind!

In a twinkle, it was another day!

When the last Dao fire descended, the entire Soul Refining Furnace seemed to be boiling.

The cover on top of the furnace was actually going to be pushed off.

Everyone exchanged glances, feeling like the Soul Refining Furnace was about to explode.

“This … What’s going on here?”

“This Ye Yuan is also formidable, already dead and he can still cause new problems!”

“This guy wouldn’t have triggered some secret mechanism to blow this Nirvana Soul Hall up, right? I feel that with this power, once it blows up, none of us can run away!”

“Quickly look! The Soul Refining Furnace is emitting smoke! Wafts of hot air are actually emerging from the Soul Refining Furnace! Could it be that Ye Yuan was refined into smoke?”

… …

At this time, large quantities of cloud and mist emerged from the Soul Refining Furnace, looking extremely like water boiling.

Great Emperor Eastsun’s entire body trembled, his eyes revealing a look of astonishment as he cried out in alarm, “That … That wouldn’t be … wouldn’t be …”
