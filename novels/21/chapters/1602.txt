1606 Consecutive Breakthroughs in Realm

Up in the sky, not only the violent spiritual energy did not diminish, it had signs of becoming increasingly fiercer instead.

His aura was also rising steadily and burst through the middle-stage Origin Deity bottleneck very soon, breaking through to late-stage Origin Deity Realm.

Ye Yuan was like a bottomless hole, devouring the spiritual energy from all directions frenziedly.

These hundred years of deficient spiritual energy made him thirsty to the extreme, absorbing to his heart’s content in one shot.

When Zheng Qi saw this scene, his expression flickered repeatedly and he said in surprise, “Grandmaster, this Ye Yuan, could he ...”

Coldfeather slowly nodded and said, “If not for seeing with my own eyes, I also wouldn’t dare to believe in my dreams that someone can comprehend two-layered heaven spatial laws within a hundred years. No idea what kind of cultivation method this kid cultivates either, to actually be able to withstand such terrifying spatial laws. Tsk tsk, all in all, this kid is leaking strangeness everywhere on his body.”

Coldfeather said it flatly, but monstrous waves surged in Zheng Qi’s heart.

The two supreme laws were what everyone was dreaming after.

But apart from that predecessor of the Martial Tower, nobody was able to comprehend it anymore. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

So many years had passed, to say that Zheng Qi was not moved, that would be false.

But he did not have the courage to go and try his luck.

Over 100 thousand years ago, Coldfeather was known as the number one genius whose accomplishments surpassed ancient and modern times!

Even he ‘died’ inside the spatial inheritance, so who else dared to go and attempt?

Nobody would have thought that Ye Yuan actually succeeded!

...

Zhou Wei’s current emotions were in a jumbled mess. It was really bitter to the extreme.

The reason why he dared to treat Yue Mengli, White Light, and the rest this way, was because he was certain that Ye Yuan already died inside the spatial inheritance.

But reality gave him a resounding slap.

“This ... This is impossible! He ... Didn’t he die inside the spatial inheritance? Why would he show up here?!”

Zhou Wei’s entire person was flustered. The moment he laid eyes on Ye Yuan, he knew that he was finished.

A hundred years ago, Ye Yuan was already extremely domineering, even defeating Head Elder Ruo Xu.

Now, Ye Yuan actually comprehended spatial laws and returned domineeringly.

Ye Yuan who was exceptional in alchemy and martial arts would bound to be scalding hot to one’s touch in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

If he were to blame someone for something, nobody would be able to save the person!

“Hahaha, indeed worthy of being my big brother! Zhou Wei, didn’t you say that my big brother died inside? Open your dog eyes wide and see who that person is!” White Light said with a loud laugh.

These few years, they were brutally bullied by Zhou Wei.

Now, seeing his soft-shelled turtle-like appearance, he was incomparably liberated in his heart.

Zhou Wei’s face revealed a smile that was even uglier than crying. Kneeling down with a thud, he hugged White Light’s calves and cried bitterly as he said, “Lord White, it ... it was all this lowly one who had eyes but couldn’t see! This ... This lowly one was bewitched by others. That’s why I would do this kind of foolish thing! L-Lord White, please raise your hand high up in mercy and let me off!”

Yue Mengli and the rest all looked at Zhou Wei with scorn. This guy was a typical snobbish despicable person, bullying the kind and fearing the wicked, grass on top of a wall that swayed wherever the wind blew.

When Ye Yuan was not around, he created all kinds of difficulties.

Now that Ye Yuan returned, he immediately became a grandson.

This kind of person, others looked down on them from the bottom of their hearts.

“Heh, know to ask your Lord White to raise his hand high in mercy now? Already missed the chance! But it’s also useless for you to beg me now. This matter, better let Big Brother make a final decision.” White Light said with a cold smile.

“If you had long known this day would come, why act like that in the past! You and Song Qiyang acted in collusion, but you wait and watch properly. I want to see whether or not Song Qiyang will come and plead on your behalf!” Yue Mengli said with a cold snort.

Zhou Wei regretted it in his heart. He really did not expect it!

One should leave a ray of hope when conducting oneself in any action, but he pushed Yue Mengli and the rest to extermination.

“I ... I was wrong! Grandaunt, I really know that I was wrong! I had eyes but couldn’t see, I was blinded by obsession, I ...” Zhou Wei said, as he slapped himself viciously.

The strange gazes that others cast over, he could not care anymore as well.

He knew that if he could not get these people’s forgiveness, then his life would be ruined.

With his status, offending an elder, that was no different from seeking death.

Furthermore, with the talent that Ye Yuan displayed, his status in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, probably even Head Elder would find it hard to hold a candle to.

Zhou Wei jabbered a whole bunch, slapping his own mouth as he spoke, making it loud and clear.

In front of so many people, he, a dignified Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, was also considered to have utterly lost face all the way back to his granny’s house.

“Isn’t that Protector Zhou Wei? Why would he kowtow frantically toward a bunch of Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artists?”

“Those few people look like Elder Ye’s close kin. Zhou Wei this person is the most snobbish. These few years, everybody all thought that Elder Ye died. He definitely offended them to the core.”

“Heh, nobody could have ever thought that the spatial inheritance which no one succeeded before, Elder Ye actually succeeded!”

“Yeah, when a man attains the Dao, his fowls and dogs ascend to heaven too. Even if his kin is just at the Heaven Glimpse Realm, who dares to offend them?”

...

Bystanders discussed animatedly. But when it landed in Li-er’s and the others’ ears, it was rather grating on the ear.

A strange emotion spread out in everyone’s heart.

White Light was greatly enraged and said coldly, “You get lost for me, I don’t want to see you now! If you still pester endlessly, I’ll make Big Brother mess you to death, do you believe it or not?”

Zhou Wei jumped in fright and hurriedly said, “Yes, yes, yes, I’ll get lost! I’ll get lost!”

Finished talking, he scrambled and ran away.

...

No one would have thought that Ye Yuan’s breakthrough was for ten days and ten nights.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s martial artists even felt that the spiritual energy around them was much thinner.

Spiritual energies were all absorbed clean by Ye Yuan.

Even though everyone was cultivating normally, that was all a step-by-step process.

Even though the spiritual energy around was plenty, they could not suck it in at all.

How could it be like Ye Yuan? This was completely disregarding one’s life.

And Ye Yuan’s realm was also rising crazily.

“Elder Ye’s breakthrough is simply too crazy. These few days, he actually directly cultivated to peak late-stage Origin Deity from middle-stage Origin Deity.”

“Looking at this, he isn’t going to directly breakthrough to grand completion Origin Deity, right?”

“Very likely! You look, he broke through! Really broke through! My God, turns out that you can cultivate like this!”

...

Ye Yuan’s breakthrough gave people an extremely strong sense of impact.

Origin Deity Realm was not like when at the mortal realms back then. Each breakthrough of a minor realm, the spiritual energy required was an extremely horrifying number.

Even a more prodigious martial artist, even if the cultivation method they cultivated was of a higher level, it was also unheard of to break through two minor realms in a row within a few days.

But Ye Yuan did it!

At this time, Ye Yuan’s aura rose sharply, breaking through the bottleneck of late-stage Origin Deity in one stroke, reaching the grand completion realm of Origin Deity.

When Zheng Qi saw this scene, he was incomparably shocked in his heart.

But Coldfeather smiled and said, “This boy wants to make up for all of these 100 years of delayed cultivation! Looks like he’s ending soon. It’s also this old man’s turn now. Tsk tsk, if this old man can also break through like him, how good would it be!”
