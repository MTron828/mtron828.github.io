Chapter 1973: Changing Commander

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Ye Yuan rushed over, Qian Feng was already sucked dry.

And all this happened in just an instant.

Song Yu and the rest looked at Qian Feng’s corpse. All of their faces were deathly pale.

If that ghostly thing was following behind them, and if Ye Yuan did not discover it in time, the consequences were too dreadful to contemplate.

This speed of sucking blood was too fast. They actually could not react at all.

Furthermore, this guy followed by their side for so long, and yet they actually did not notice it at all.

It was just that, how did Ye Yuan discover it?

They did not see Ye Yuan at all just now and Ye Yuan could actually discover the ghostly thing following behind them.

How did this guy do it?

Everyone was anxious and doubtful, looking at Ye Yuan with a flustered face.

“Ye Yuan, did you see clearly what that thing was?” Song Yu’s complexion was somewhat pale as he asked.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I couldn’t see clearly. I only saw a green shadow. Its speed is too fast!”

After saying this, he inspected Qian Feng’s dead body and discovered that behind his neck, there was a very fine puncture, like it was poked by a needle.

As for others, there were no other wounds.

Currently, the other teams also encountered similar situations, all having someone being sucked dry.

Some teams even had several dead already before it was discovered.

But until now, no one saw what that was at all.

For some time, everyone felt imperiled.

Suddenly, Guo Jingyang said to Ye Yuan, “Y-Ye Yuan, why don’t ... you join our team?”

“Ye Yuan, previously, it was all our fault. But everyone came from Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital. I hope that looking on the account of being from the same hometown, you don’t leave us in the lurch!” Ma Chang also said with a terrified look.

They had long seen through that Ye Yuan was absolutely not as simple as he looked on the surface.

Along the way, many problems were already demonstrated.

He possessed two empyrean spirit treasures on him and could rival four great Third Firmament True God powerhouses. His defensive power was virtually without any weakness to exploit.

Now, that green entity, which others all could not see, Ye Yuan was the first to discover it and saw it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If not for Ye Yuan discovering it, when that green monster continued sucking one by one, it was likely that they would not realize it.

Seeking sanctuary with Ye Yuan was the wisest path currently.

With these two people taking the lead, the remaining three people, including Liu Yi, also spoke up one after another, hoping for Ye Yuan to join.

Song Yu, who was by the side, his expression was ugly to the extreme.

He was this team’s leader. Now, he was actually overlooked by the entire team.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. This Song Yu made things difficult in every way. Actually, he did not want to join a team.

But in the end, everyone came from Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital. If they all died here, he indeed could not justify it.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan could feel that inside this fog was indeed full of danger. If they grouped up together, it would be relatively safer.

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan could not help looking toward Song Yu.

Song Yu’s expression was like a chameleon currently, changing non-stop.

“Brother Song, you also saw the situation earlier. If Ye Yuan can join us, we’ll be akin to adding wings to a tiger! This Ancient God Battlefield is much more dangerous than we imagine. An additional person is also an additional portion of strength, isn’t it?” Guo Jingyang urged.

Song Yu knew that if he still did not agree, these people would probably be leaving with Ye Yuan.

At that time, he would become a loner.

“Heh, even if I agree, will he be willing to agree?” Song Yu said with a cold smile.

Him saying these words was equivalent to giving himself an out.

As long as Ye Yuan loosened his mouth, this matter would be considered a done deal.

Seeing Song Yu’s appearance of wanting face even in death, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Yeah, I don’t plan on joining Brother Song’s team. Moreover, right from the beginning, Brother Song also didn’t plan on bringing me, isn’t that so?”

Finished saying, he turned around and left.

You want face?

Why should I give you face!

Song Yu’s face turned to the color of pig liver.

Seeing that everyone’s faces were unfriendly, Song Yu hurriedly shouted, “Brother Ye, wait! P-Please join our team. After all, everybody came from the same place. The matter previously, it was all my fault! Brother Ye, please don’t mind it.”

This was considered an apology.

Song Yu practically used all the strength in his body to say out this sentence.

When had he, Song Yu, admitted his mistake to others before?

But right now, he was riding on a tiger’s back and found it hard to dismount. Not apologizing would not do either.

In this present situation, he did not have any confidence in himself.

Ye Yuan gave Song Yu a glance and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Want me to join, also can. But this method of dividing treasures will have to change.”

Song Yu’s face changed, but he became depressed very quickly and said, “How does Brother Ye want to change it?”

Ye Yuan said, “Whoever puts in more effort, gets more treasures.”

When the rest heard it, they were overjoyed in their hearts.

This method of distribution was clearly much fairer.

Song Yu nodded his head and said, “I have no objections.”

At this time, it was also no longer his turn to object.

Settling the storm, everyone continued advancing.

Along the way, everyone finally knew Ye Yuan’s prowess.

Each one of them managed to get quite a few treasures!

At times, the treasure was clearly very far from them, but Ye Yuan saw it with one glance.

Clearly, Ye Yuan could see much further than them.

Recalling when in the battle spirits army, they did not even pick up a strand of hair. This treatment was simply a world of difference.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s distribution was also very fair; practically everyone got a share.

The treasures that their squad obtained were several times those of other teams!

The intestines of these people were currently green with regret. If they had long followed Ye Yuan, how great would that be?

Furthermore, they discovered that screams would frequently sound out inside this fog, indicating that the other teams were still continuing to be attacked.

Only their team was without incident all the way.

That damn green thing never came to find them again.

“Heh, Brother Ye is indeed well-deserving of having an emperor surmounting aura! Not even those monsters dare to come close to us!”

“Yeah. Previously, it was all us who had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai, to actually look down on Brother Ye.”

...

In the current situation, each and every one of them was very satisfied, and also did not stint with their praises toward Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan was not as optimistic as them.

The calmer it was, the more intense the uneasiness in his heart.

“Everybody, be more careful, this fog is full of perils. There absolutely won’t be just this bit of danger,” Ye Yuan warned them.

As if in order to affirm his words, several black things suddenly shot toward them, the speed swift to the extreme.

Ye Yuan was naturally the first to discover the problem, his face could not help changing as he cried out in surprise, “Everybody, be careful! Brother Song!”

“Got it!” Song Yu answered in a solemn voice.

In the team, the two people’s strengths were the strongest, and naturally blocked at the forefront, and the rest supported through coordinated actions. This was also the best way of fighting that they discussed beforehand.

Seven to eight afterimages arrived with a howl, Ye Yuan utilized the Stellar War Banner without the slightest hesitation.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Those seven to eight afterimages were directly sent flying under Ye Yuan and Song Yu’s attacks.

However, they had yet to have time to be happy yet when those black shadows charged forward once more as if they were not affected at all.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he said, “Such powerful defense! Everybody be careful!”
