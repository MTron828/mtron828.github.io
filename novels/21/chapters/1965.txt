Chapter 1969: Beg me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Originally, everyone was on the same starting line.

Although Song Yu’s strength was strong, everyone gave it no heed.

They all felt that as long as they obtained a little lucky chance, breaking through to the Third Firmament True God would naturally be a cinch.

But now, they could not even step out of the door without forming a team. What to do now?

Dealing with these battle spirits, with Song Yu’s strength, he would naturally exert himself the most.

Fighting alone was no different from seeking death.

Hence, everyone had to ask Song Yu for help. The situation was naturally different.

The expressions on everyone’s face was very ugly. Song Yu getting 50% of the benefits alone, this was too wicked.

“Heh, since you’re not willing, then I’ll find others to form a team,” he said. Song Yu turned around and left.

Guo Jingyang’s face changed and he said, “Okay, I agree!”

“I ... I agree too!”

Song Yu’s move of allowing more latitude first in order to get a tighter rein achieved its effect very soon.

“Huhu, since that’s the case, then let’s set it like this. The treasures obtained, I get 50%. The remaining 50%, you guys distribute them yourselves,” Song Yu smiled and said.

The others had black faces, clearly feeling very gloomy.

The more treasures obtained, the more exuberant one’s destiny naturally would be.

With Song Yu’s talent, if he obtained so many treasures, he might be able to break through to the emperor surmounting aura in one go.

As for Song Yu, he was naturally unwilling to find other people to form a team anymore.

Forming teams with the powerhouses of other imperial cities, he naturally could not get so many treasures. Furthermore, he also would not be able to lead the team.

These children of destiny would rather be the head of a chicken than the tail of a phoenix. How could they be willing to be beneath others?

Hence, these children of destiny formed big and small circles.

Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s nine people, there were seven people who announced to join Song Yu’s team very quickly. There was only Ye Yuan and Liu Yi left.

“Heh, old man, are you planning on going out alone?” Song Yu looked at Liu Yi and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Liu Yi gave a wretched smile and said, “How can I! I ... I’ll join Sir Song’s team.”

Song Yu nodded his head and looked toward Ye Yuan with a smile that was not a smile, saying with a mocking face: “This sir with the emperor surmounting aura shouldn’t be joining our team, right?”

“Emperor surmounting aura? That kid is actually of the emperor surmounting aura!”

“Heh heh, so what if emperor surmounting aura? With his strength, even if he has emperor surmounting aura, it’s also dying until not even dregs remain. Based on this, he still needs to beg people.”

...

Song Yu’s words immediately drew quite a bit of focus.

After all, of these children of destiny, imperial auras were plentiful, while emperor surmounting auras were in the minority.

This kind of ratio was roughly the same as Empyrean Realm powerhouses and Heavenly Emperor Realm powerhouses.

Among a hundred Empyrean Realm powerhouses, there might not be one who could break through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm.

Toward the emperor surmounting aura, if their strength was strong, everyone naturally would not say anything.

But Ye Yuan’s strength was too poor. Everyone looked at him rather interestedly, looking at him being humiliated by the others.

This was also considered the mentality of hating and wanting to be wealthy, right?

Song Yu sneered coldly in his heart, so what if destiny was high? So what if he knew how to refine pills?

In this Ancient God Battlefield, everything still depended on strength!

When he obtained treasures and broke through to the emperor surmounting aura, he would fling this kid far away behind.

Arrogant for what?! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

During that time at Virtuous Wind Establishment, his face was utterly lost.

At that time, there were so many big shots around. So he naturally did not dare to say anything.

But now, the situation had reversed. Ye Yuan had to look to him for help. Song Yu naturally had to knead him well.

Beg me!

Beg me!

Whether I agree or not depends on my mood!

Song Yu was delighted in his heart.

Everyone’s gaze was cast on Ye Yuan, wanting to see if he would lower his head or not.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s right. I’m planning on working alone, you guys go ahead.”

Everyone was taken back, working alone?

Even if you wanted face, there was also no need to be like this, right?

Could it be that those people being dismembered by a flurry of blades earlier, he did not see it?

There were a series of question marks on top of everyone’s heads, all dumbstruck with astonishment by Ye Yuan’s words.

Song Yu was stunned first, then immediately laughed in spite of himself and said, “Working alone? Heh, our emperor surmounting aura expert is really domineering! Hahaha!”

The rest also roared with laughter, feeling that Ye Yuan was keeping up appearance to cover up his predicament.

As long as he went out, moving alone would definitely die until not even dregs remained; unless he was not planning to go out.

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not speak.

When Song Yu saw this expression, he felt as uncomfortable as having eaten a fly and said with a cold snort, “I want to see how you act alone! If you have the capability, don’t hide in here and not go out!”

The teams had an outcome very soon, it was mostly grouped with great imperial capital as the factor.

But there were also a small number of weaker ones who formed a small team.

Hence, one team after another started going out of the circle and heading into the depths of the Ancient God Battlefield.

The moment they went out of the circle, countless battle spirits started surrounding them.

However, the strengths of these children of destiny were not ordinary. With them cooperating together, they naturally did not fear these battle spirits.

Song Yu gave Ye Yuan a glance and said with a cold smile, “Child of emperor surmounting aura, why haven’t you gone out yet, scared? Heh, if you beg me now, I can consider taking you for a ride.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said coolly, “Many thanks for Sir Song’s good intentions, but there’s no need.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan leaped and actually went straight out of the circle.

The faces of Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s people changed, looking at this scene in shock.

Being suicidal for face?

This ... This was also too impressive, right?

This was not keeping up appearance to cover up his predicament. This was wanting to save face to the point it would really be fatal!

“This kid’s brain is spoiled, right?”

“What emperor surmounting aura? Simply a fool!”

“What’s the point of this dispute caused by personal feelings? Losing his life in vain!”

...

Extreme Luck’s people had mocking looks on their faces, very disapproving of Ye Yuan’s actions.

Only Liu Yi’s two eyes were narrowed slightly, staring fixedly at Ye Yuan’s figure. No one knew what he was thinking.

Suddenly, his gaze turned intent, revealing an astonished look.

Not just him, the other people’s faces similarly went from sneering to shock.

Especially Song Yu, the look on his face was ugly to the extreme.

Without the least bit of surprise, the moment Ye Yuan came out, he was surrounded by battle spirits that blotted out the skies and covered the earth very quickly.

But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of defending at all. He just walked leisurely like that.

When the attacks of those Celestial Deity Realm battle spirits landed on his body, it did not have any effect at all, not even causing an itch!

The perfect sixth transformation golden body Ye Yuan had once shattered a true god mystic treasure with one punch.

With his perverse defensive power, the attacks of mere Celestial Deity Realm battle spirits was nothing to him at all.

“This ... What’s going on?”

“This defensive strength is also a little too freakish, right?”

“Hang on, he’s a body cultivator! His fleshy body has already reached the sixth transformation golden body. The attacks of mere Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses can’t hurt him at all!”

...

When the children of destiny who had not let the circle yet saw this scene, each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths.

The defensive power of body-cultivating martial artists were all very perverse.

One should not look at how these martial artists cultivated to the True God Realm; their physical bodies might be inferior to Celestial Deity Realm body-cultivators.

Their defensive power was completely relying on divine essence protecting the body.

One or two Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses naturally would not hurt them.

But once the numbers went up, and there were even True God Realm martial artists tangling, their protective divine essence would be slowly whittled away.

Once it was weakened to a certain degree, the attacks of Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses would cause damage to them.
