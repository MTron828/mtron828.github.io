“Since you don’t want anymore, leave then!”

Ye Yuan brought Little Dragon Girl along and left proudly.

Everyone looked at these two people’s back view, their faces dumbfounded.

On the ground, Ironcore was thrashed until he was wailing endlessly.

Although the water dragons failed to kill him, it still made him suffer immensely.

“These two added together, they are simply the devil’s incarnate!” Cui Tong exclaimed.

Su Yi had a bitter smile on his face as he said, “Isn’t that so? That power just now, probably only if City Lord His Excellency comes, can he suppress it, right? The others will only get pummeled.”

“That’s Deputy City Lord, Ironcore, a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven overlord. He was actually pummeled at will. Seriously …” Sun Yunjing shook his head and said with a bitter smile.

… …

“Big Brother, you’re really amazing! Aren’t you a human? Why is your bloodline power so pure?”

“I have half dragon race bloodline.”

“Big Brother, you look, we’re also considered comrade-in-arms who have fought side by side already. I beg you, don’t send me back, alright?”

“You heard it too. If you don’t go back, I’ll have to die.”

“But is there no other way? I finally managed to come out. So I really don’t want to go back!”

“Very sorry. There isn’t any way at all.”

“Didn’t you sign an origin divinity contract with my brother? Later, you return the Emerald Sea Divine Conch to him, then you help me snatch it back, alright?”

… …

Along the way, Little Dragon Girl turned into a chatterbox, blabbering away non-stop in Ye Yuan’s ear.

It was just that at this time there was no longer the previous detest. She was looking at Ye Yuan with a worshiping face instead.

In her eyes, she seemed to really treat Ye Yuan as her elder brother.

Seeing Little Dragon Girl’s transformation, Ye Yuan sighed for a while too.

This girl was simply a child who had not grown up and did not have any thoughts of good or evil. She only did things based on temporary likes and dislikes.

Furthermore, Little Dragon Girl’s bloodline was pure and her strength was powerful. She had never met someone more powerful than her.

Therefore, this little girl was incredibly haughty.

But everything had its vanquisher. She was subdued by Ye Yuan.

First was teaching a lesson, then it was revealing his pure bloodline.

Hence, this little girl was thoroughly convinced.

Seashore, the sea race army gathered.

Ye Yuan left the huffy Little Dragon Girl and arrived.

When he saw Little Dragon Girl, Dragon Son Huining was greatly surprised too.

But very soon, his fury surged.

“Jingfei! You actually dared to run onto land! Do you know how worried Royal Father is about you?” Huining said in a solemn voice.

But Little Dragon Girl did not yield and made a funny face at him and said, “It’s boring to death in the Dragon Palace! It’s boring to death in the ocean! I just want to come on land! What can you do to me?”

“You!” Huining was furious.

Ye Yuan watched at one side, but he was amused.

Most likely, no one in the Thistle South Sea Region could subdue her.

“Alright, go back and settle the business between you brother and sister! This is the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, it’s returned to the original owner now! You take this stinking lass away too. The two of us are square.”

Ye Yuan took the Emerald Sea Divine Conch out and directly threw it to Huining.

Huining looked at Ye Yuan and even felt surprised in his heart.

He knew how wild this younger sister of his was.

Furthermore, with the Emerald Sea Divine Conch in possession, ordinary Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were not her match either.

This guy could actually subdue his younger sister and bring her over.

Looking at her appearance, his younger sister did not seem to be very resistant as well.

“Insolence! You dare to address the princess as stinking lass! Boy, do you really not know how the character death is written?” When the black shark general heard Ye Yuan’s term of address, he was immediately furious.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him, turning right around and leaving.

Behind Ye Yuan was the human army.

Huining’s brows furrowed, and he flicked his sleeves grandly and said indifferently, “Alright, withdraw the troops back to the capital!”

But right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

Little Dragon Girl suddenly formed a spell and gave a light cry, “Come!”

The Emerald Sea Divine Conch was summoned and directly broke free from Huining’s hands and flew toward Little Dragon Girl.

At the same time, her body was like an arrow that left the bow, fleeing like flying.

“Hehe,?Big Brother, the origin divinity contract has already been completed, no need to die anymore! Now, I escaped by myself again. Bring me to play on land, alright?”

In a blink, Little Dragon Girl already arrived beside Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was not very surprised. If she did not run over, that would be surprising instead.

However, Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “You play by yourself. I don’t have time to play with you.”

Little Dragon Girl said huffily,?“Humph!?Stinking big brother!”

“Jingfei! Come back for me! If you still don’t return, Royal Father will definitely kill his way to Heavenly South City!” Huining’s furious voice came from behind.

Little Dragon Girl made a funny face at him and said, “That’s his business. What does it have to do with me?”

Huining was angry, and then he turned toward Ye Yuan and said in a cold voice, “Boy, you cheated! You and Jingfei this lass ganged up!”

Ye Yuan looked at him like looking at a fool and could not help laughing as he said, “Are you stupid? If I colluded with her, could I clear the origin divinity contract, this obstacle? You can’t control your own sister, but you come to find trouble with me. Where’s the logic here?”

Huining’s old face turned red, knowing that what Ye Yuan said was the truth.

Origin divinity contract was witnessed by Heavenly Dao.

If Ye Yuan and Jingfei colluded, it could not hide from Heavenly Dao. The origin divinity contract would likewise be activated.

Furthermore, with Jingfei this girl’s mischievousness, it was not surprising to do such a thing.

“This … Little Brother, how about you and I work together to capture this girl?”

After coming to his senses, Huining’s tone softened and he said, “My Royal Father dotes on this girl immensely. Furthermore, you’ve seen this girl’s temperament too. If she goes onto land, God knows how much trouble she’ll cause!”

The moment Little Dragon Girl heard, she secretly thought to herself that it was not good and instantly wanted to slip away.

Except, it was already too late, Ye Yuan grabbed hold of her calf.

“Good big brother, I beg you, don’t let me go back, alright?” Little Dragon Girl begged.

Ye Yuan had an indifferent look and said coolly, “I feel that what Dragon Son said makes sense.?Uh?… if you don’t go back, there will probably be no peace on land for even a second. Moreover, your Royal Father will probably still launch a sea war for your sake. Therefore, you’d better go back obediently.”

“I don’t want to?”

“Mn?”?Ye Yuan shot a glare and Little Dragon Girl immediately withered up.

“Alright, alright, I’ll go back, okay? Stinking big brother, bad big brother!” Little Dragon Girl lost her temper.

She held Ye Yuan in great awe and veneration.

Furthermore, that look just now was so fierce, just like when he spanked her buttocks before.

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “You’d best go back obediently for me. If you dare to sneak back and get caught by me again, you know the outcome!”

Ye Yuan glared, she subconsciously touched her buttocks and said, “Alright, I got it!”

Over on the seafolk’s side, there were stunned people all around, including Huining.

This lawless and unbridled little girl actually feared Ye Yuan like a tiger!

In the 100 years that this lass was born, the entire Thistle South Sea Region was turned upside down by her.

Even Black Flood Dragon King could not do anything to her.

Now, she was actually obeying a human youth’s words!

“However, you have to promise me something! Otherwise, I’ll still sneak out!” As if afraid that Ye Yuan would refuse, Little Dragon Girl specifically emphasized it.

Ye Yuan felt a headache too and said with a nod, “Say it!”

Little Dragon Girl’s initial ill-humor turned into joy and she said, “I want you to come to Thistle South Dragon Palace to see me within a year! Otherwise,?humph humph!?My Royal Father will kill his way to Heavenly South City!”
