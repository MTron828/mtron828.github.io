1600 Short-lived?

Ye Yuan put away the Junyi Sword and leisurely walked one round everywhere, and discovered this place’s different aspect very soon.

This region of space seemed to be very stable, like ... a spatial node.

“This place is the spatial inheritance’s central point, and it is also the safest place. But arriving here means that you’ll never get out. Unless ... you can fully comprehend the first two levels of spatial laws.”

Seemingly realizing that Ye Yuan discovered something, that black-robed person opened his mouth and said.

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised. He knew that the black-robed person was not lying. This region of space was very safe, but the space outside was very chaotic.

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “Wonder what your esteemed self’s name is and how many years have you been trapped here?”

That black-robed person’s brows knitted slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Impudent! Junior, to actually dare talk to me like this! If not for this place’s spiritual energy being deficient, I would at least be the Martial Tower’s elder right now!”

In the view of the black-robed person, according to seniority, Ye Yuan at least had to respectfully address him as a senior.

But who knew that this kid was so ignorant of the rules, directly calling ‘your esteemed self’.

Even though he was trapped here, his pride was still there.

Being able to live until now in itself already indicated that he was an extremely formidable genius back then.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder, is it? I’m an elder too. So talking about being on equal footing doesn’t seem to have any problem?”

“Hahaha!”

When the black-robed person heard, he immediately let out a peal of hoarse laughter and said, “Kid, do you take me to be trapped here for too long and became muddle-headed, is it? Your hair isn’t even fully grown, elder? This joke isn’t funny at all!”

If not for seeing that Ye Yuan was a junior of the Martial Tower and the first person to enter this place in so many years, he would have long smacked Ye Yuan to death with one slap.

This kid actually dared to make fun of him!

But in the next instant, his gaze suddenly turned sharp, staring fixedly at Ye Yuan’s hand.

Ye Yuan’s hand really held a token!

An elder’s token!

The black-robed person’s pupils constricted and he revealed a disbelieving look as he exclaimed, “You ... Why would you possess the elder’s token? Pill Tower elder? A Three-star Alchemy God, how can you possibly become the Pill Tower’s elder? No, wait, this token of yours must be fake!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and directly threw the token to the other party.

The other party inspected it, his gaze revealing a look of astonishment.

This token was not fake!

“Ye Yuan! Pill Tower elder! You ... How did you do it?” The black-robed person looked at Ye Yuan with incredible shock and asked.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Becoming the Pill Tower’s elder, it’s naturally because my pill refining standard is passable. If you can go out, you’ll naturally know what’s up.”

The black-robed person’s gaze turned intent and he said with anguish, “Go out? Entering this place, you still want to go out? I, Coldfeather, have been trapped here for 130 thousand years already and can’t find the way to go out! Even if you’re a Pill Tower elder, you can forget about going out from here too!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “130 thousand years? I don’t have so much time to waste here! I’ll just need to be able to go out!”

Coldfeather snickered and said, “Overestimating your own ability! All of the people who enter the spatial inheritance feel that they can comprehend spatial laws. But they are all dead! Only I’m still eking out a meager existence till this date! This old man assessed his own ability at first. I feel that my talent is superior to others, but then I can only comprehend first-layered heaven spatial laws to late-stage too. Even if your talent far surpasses this old man’s, without several tens of thousands of years, could it be that you can still catch up to this old man?”

Ye Yuan took out the elder’s token and said with a smile, “Not trying, how would you know?”

Coldfeather suddenly calmed down and said coolly, “Back then, when this old man just entered, I was the exact same as you, also full of high spirits. When your drive is whittled away clean, you’ll know what’s called despair! Go then!”

Ye Yuan smiled and did not answer. He then started to meditate on the spot.

These three years, Ye Yuan comprehended spatial laws with Sword Dao laws. Now that he shattered space, he had some comprehensions.

He needed to calm his heart down and contemplate the gains of these three years of cultivation.

Gradually, Ye Yuan entered a state of emptiness.

As for Coldfeather, with Dustless keeping watch, he was not worried.

If Coldfeather attacked, Dustless would control the Purple Extreme Hall right away and pull Ye Yuan inside.

Coldfeather looked at the Ye Yuan meditating, his gaze full of disdain.

Coldfeather laughed mockingly and said, “An old person’s sayings are seldom untrue! When you bump until you’re battered and bruised, you’ll be able to experience this old man’s current state of mind.”

...

Time ticked away. This meditation of Ye Yuan had already taken half a year’s time.

On this day, there was suddenly a ripple in space.

Coldfeather suddenly snapped open his eyes, looking toward Ye Yuan with great surprise.

“This brat actually broke through to middle-stage first-layered heaven so fast? Turns out that he already comprehended spatial laws. So wonder he can reach until here! Looks like this kid’s talent is really extraordinary!”

Coldfeather was very sensitive toward spatial laws. The spatial undulations that Ye Yuan triggered were precisely first-layered heaven spatial laws’ middle-stage.

Through three years of comprehending Dao and also experiencing half a year of accumulation, Ye Yuan finally broke through the bottleneck.

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly got up, took out the Junyi Sword, and leaped, entering inside the chaotic space once more.

Coldfeather looked at Ye Yuan’s disappeared back view and could not help being somewhat puzzled.

“This boy, comprehending spatial laws, carrying a sword for what?”

Ye Yuan’s departure was several years’ time.

When he returned again, Ye Yuan was riddled with tons of gaping wounds, clearly being considerably wounded by the chaotic space.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan had many medicinal pills on him. After consuming medicinal pills, he sat quietly meditated once more.

After he fully digested these few years of comprehensions, he carried his sword and entered the chaotic space once again, rinse and repeat.

Coldfeather observed from the sidelines coldly but was disapproving in his heart.

In his view, Ye Yuan just happened to cultivate to a bottleneck previously, and only broke through successfully by coincidence.

But spatial laws, the more to the back, the more profound. The time expended would increase exponentially.

So much so that 10 or 20 thousand years and one would also be unable to advance an inch!

If spatial laws could be eked out by relying on time, Coldfeather also would not be trapped for 130 thousand years.

...

“Have you heard? Elder Ye had already fallen inside the spatial inheritance!”

“Such a major thing, how could it be possible to not hear about it?”

“Sigh, what a shame. Such an astonishing genius actually committed suicide, going to seek death!”

“Isn’t that so! There has never been anyone capable of coming out of the spatial inheritance. Who does he think he is, to actually do this kind of foolish thing!”

...

Three years after Ye Yuan entered the spatial inheritance, the light dot that represented him finally totally vanished.

This also represented that Ye Yuan already perished inside the spatial inheritance.

When this news came out of the Martial Tower, it immediately rocked the entire inner city.

The once dazzling genius flowered briefly like the broad-leaved epiphyllum just like this, forever remaining behind in the chaotic space.

Some people felt sorry, some people had sympathy, some people gloated over other’s misfortune.

But no one doubted that it was already impossible for Ye Yuan to come out of the spatial inheritance.

“Sniff, sniff ... I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Elder Ye will definitely come out, there’s no way he died inside!”

Ning Siyu threw herself on Second Elder’s shoulder and wept bitterly without ceasing.
