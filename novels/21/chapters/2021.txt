Chapter 2025: Not Treating Himself as an Outsider

“Ye Yuan, somebody sent an invitation over earlier. The person said to let you open it personally.” Ning Siyu handed an invitation to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan opened it and took a look, and his brows could not help knitting together.

Ning Siyu also had a curious face. Moving closer to take a look, she discovered that it turned out it was an invitation to an alchemy gathering.

“Your Excellency, these are all Empyrean powerhouses, Seven-star Alchemy Gods! Tsk tsk, grandmasters are grandmasters, even the treatment is different,” Ning Siyu smiled and said.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Grandmaster? Huhu, there’s probably an ulterior motive, right?”

Ning Siyu was stunned but reacted very quickly.

In her heart, Ye Yuan was a powerhouse on the same level as these Seven-star Alchemy Gods. So her first reaction when she saw the invitation was that Ye Yuan was very impressive.

But as long as one thought about it slightly, they would know that something was not right.

She thought so, but they did not think that way!

Could those Empyreans have a high opinion of Ye Yuan, this Six-star Alchemy God?

“Like that huh? Then we aren’t going?” Ning Siyu said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Go. Why aren’t we going? Being able to become a Seven-star Alchemy God, there’s bound to be some saving grace. Since that’s the case, what’s the harm in going to interact with them?”

Ye Yuan agreeing to come to the Cloudpill Summit was aiming at these Seven-star Alchemy Gods.

Reaching the realm of Seven-star Alchemy God Realm, each one could not be underestimated.

Ye Yuan had never doubted his alchemy talent, but he would also never be arrogant and conceited.

Back then, in Cloudmarsh City, he fought fiercely for several thousand matches. It was not in order to deliberately show off his talent but to learn widely from others’ strong points.

And after that, he indeed learned a lot from other people. His alchemy strength also improved at a tremendous pace.

Coming to Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital this time, his goal was also the same.

As for Luo Yue those people, they were not worth mentioning at all in Ye Yuan’s eyes. He naturally could not be bothered to take action.

What’s the point of making a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse and a Celestial Deity martial artist discuss about Martial Dao.

Wanting to converse with Ye Yuan as equals, they needed to be at the middle-stage Dao Realm at the very least.

Ning Siyu hesitated and said, “But these people are clearly harboring ill-intent!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Want to make things difficult for me, they at least got to reach Brother Flutterfeather’s strength too. Just the likes of them aren’t qualified enough.”

By the side, Ning Siyu had a besotted appearance.

This calm confidence seemed played down, but actually, that sort of might was established on the foundation of countless victories.

This kind of imposing momentum was even stronger than that kind of imposing momentum which showed disdain on all under the heavens.

And this kind of man naturally attracted women even more.

But Ning Siyu had long given up on this thought. She knew that His Excellency had fetters in his heart.

The current Ning Siyu was already very satisfied. As long as she could stay by His Excellency’s side like this, she was already very satisfied.

...

“Halt! Qiandan Pavilion is Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s important place. Miscellaneous personnel is not to enter!”

Ye Yuan came to a tall multi-storeyed pavilion according to the address and was immediately stopped by a Ninth Firmament True God powerhouse. His words were full of warning.

A Third Firmament True God dared to run here, was there a problem with his head?

Ye Yuan took out the invitation and said coolly, “Empyrean Lumen issued the invitation to me, written on it is this address. It should be correct, right?”

Seeing the invitation, the Ninth Firmament True God’s face changed, using suspicious eyes to size Ye Yuan up. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Why would Empyrean Lumen invite a True God Realm here?

Opening the invitation to take a look, the Ninth Firmament True God’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “You ... no ... Your Excellency, you’re Grandmaster Ye Yuan?”

“If there’s no second Ye Yuan, it should be me.” Ye Yuan took out his grandmaster token. The other party’s expression instantly became incomparably awkward.

He hurriedly returned the invitation to Ye Yuan and said in fear and trepidation, “Your Excellency please don’t blame this lowly one ... This lowly one really didn’t recognize Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Can I go in now?”

The Ninth Firmament True God squeezed out a smile that was uglier than crying as he said, “O-Of course!”

Looking at Ye Yuan’s back view, he had an impulse of wanting to cry.

This Ye Yuan was seriously too confusing, being simply a massive pit.

Currently, there were also 8000 True God Realm martial artists in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital if there weren’t 10 thousand. Who knew that one of them was a grandmaster!

Entering Qiandan Pavilion, Ye Yuan directly entered a transmission array and entered an area of space.

There were already more than ten people in the space. They were gathered together, seemingly discussing something.

These people’s auras were extremely strong. They were actually all Empyrean powerhouses!

Seeing Ye Yuan enter, the group of Empyreans immediately stopped discussing, looking toward Ye Yuan collectively.

Buzz!

One powerful aura after another came from head-on. More than ten Empyrean powerhouses, even if they did not release Empyrean pressure, this sort of imposing momentum was also not what a puny little True God Realm could withstand.

Among them were several gazes that were rather unfriendly.

“A mere True God Realm dares to barge into Qiandan Pavilion, are you tired of living?” An Empyrean stepped out, causing powerful aura crushing over toward Ye Yuan.

This person was none other than precisely Zheng Qiyuan.

He naturally knew that this one in front of him was Ye Yuan. This was deliberately taking Ye Yuan down a notch, wanting to see the appearance of Ye Yuan being frightened until he peed his pants.

Except, he was disappointed.

Ye Yuan stood there lazily just like that as if nothing happened.

What a joke! Empyrean Realm was powerful, but wanting to scare Ye Yuan just based on a bit of Empyrean pressure, Zheng Qiyuan was clearly thinking too much.

It was only to see Ye Yuan completely ignore Zheng Qiyuan. Sweeping a glance over everyone’s faces, he opened his mouth and said coolly, “Which one is Brother Lumen, I’m Ye Yuan.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s composed appearance, the group of Empyreans was all secretly surprised.

Forget about a Third Firmament True God, even if a Ninth Firmament True God entered here, they would not even dare to breathe loudly!

Let alone that Zheng Qiyuan even released his Empyrean pressure.

But Ye Yuan was not affected at all.

This kid was not simple!

This was the first impression that Ye Yuan gave everyone.

Zheng Qiyuan stood there awkwardly as if he was making a fool of himself.

In the middle, a middle-aged man with a stern gaze opened his mouth and said smilingly, “Huhu, turns out that it’s Grandmaster Ye! We’re currently discussing an ancient formula and just happen to be at a loss. Grandmaster Ye came right on time and can give us a pointer or two.”

As he said, he came forward in swift steps, pulling Ye Yuan to join everyone.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Dare not say give pointers. Everybody should discuss it a bit.”

This attitude made the group of Empyreans frown endlessly.

This behavior seemingly made himself as someone in the same generation as the group of Empyreans.

Did this kid not have any score in his heart about how much capability he had? Did he really take himself to be a grandmaster?

Zheng Qiyuan had just suffered a loss and currently had nowhere to vent his fury. Hearing this, he could not help saying with a cold smile, “Heh, truly boasting shamelessly! You, a mere Third Firmament True God, don’t even know if you can refine rank six divine pills or not, but you also dare to inquire about Seventh Firmament pill formulas?”

Calling Ye Yuan over, this idea was given by him

They were indeed also investigating the ancient formula. But this ancient formula was not that simple, they were also at a loss on what to do currently.

But Ye Yuan postured the moment he came up. He really was not treating himself as an outsider!
