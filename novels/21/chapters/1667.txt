Chapter 1671 No Such Thing!

“Your Excellency, I came from Heavenly Water Imperial Capital, my grandfather is ...”

Zhuo Han was just about to report his background when the old drunkard’s aura suddenly released. Zhuo Han’s complexion turned white all at once, kneeling on the ground with a thud.

The old drunkard said in a cold voice, “You dare to threaten me? Forget about Zhuo Shilong, even if Ji Xun came, he’d have to tuck his tail between his legs and behave here too!”

The old drunkard’s aura was too horrifying. Those Divine Lord Realm powerhouses all turned white as a sheet.

They could not withstand the old drunkard’s powerful pressure at all.

“Humph! Put away your pride, your pride is utterly worthless in front of this old man! Although one can’t make a move under the Heavenspan Mountain, dealing with little babies like you guys, just one look is enough!”

How did the old drunkard still have any drunkenness at this time? He had the solemn air of an expert.

Even Ye Yuan felt an enormous pressure.

Indeed, him killing Zhuo Han was as simple as pinching an ant to death. He did not need to make a move at all.

“Y-Your Excellency, we ... we’ll give them!”

Saying these few words, Zhuo Han seemed to have exhausted all the strength in his body.

The old drunkard withdrew his aura and said with a cold snort, “Little baby who doesn’t know any better! Didn’t Zhuo Shilong teach you how to behave before you go out?”

The pressure on everyone suddenly lightened, all looking at the old drunkard in horror.

Only then did they know how powerful this guy who guarded Southfoot Town was!

Zhuo Han gnashed his teeth in hatred inwardly but did not dare to show the slightest hint of dissatisfaction.

He could sense that this old drunkard would really kill people.

Furthermore, the other party did not attach any importance to his grandfather, Zhuo Shilong, at all!

Also, who was Ji Xun?

That was Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s city lord!

Regarding the background of these towns at the foot of the Heavenspan Mountain, there were different versions.

Some say that they were controlled by some transcendent heavenly emperors. Some also said that they were controlled by Dao Ancestors!

But without a doubt, behind them were existences that could not be provoked!

Those two Heavenly Water Imperial Capital’s disciples handed the wooden plaques to Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping extremely unwillingly.

Ning Tianping received the wooden plaque, waved it in front of Zhuo Han, and said with a smile, “You look, we have wooden plaques now.”

Zhuo Han was infuriated!

Be smug! You guys just be smug! See whether or not you’ll get crushed to death by Heavenly Dao after you go up the Heavenspan Mountain!

Zhuo Han could only use this kind of method to console himself. Actually, it was not considered consoling either. He felt that Ye Yuan would definitely be crushed into minced meat if he went up.

The old drunkard gave Zhuo Han a glance and said coolly, “To dare provoke the prestige of the guardian, these two people are not allowed to climb the Heavenspan Mountain within three years!”

Zhuo Han’s expression changed, opened his mouth, wanting to say something. But at the thought of the old drunkard’s horrifying strength, he forcefully swallowed the words back into his stomach.

The more he said, the more this old drunkard would definitely jest.

Zhuo Han was not stupid, he naturally knew propriety.

It was just that he did not understand why such a powerhouse would take care of an Origin Deity Realm like so.

Those two people had aggrieved looks, about to cry.

Two mighty gods fighting, the two of them little goblins suffered.

Yet, they did not even have a place to reason it out.

The old drunkard said coolly, “In this place, this old man is the law! Whatever I have you do, you just care about doing it obediently! Now, start climbing the mountain!”

Those two armored people stood at the forefront of the ranks and started letting people up the mountain.

Each person had to show their wooden plaques before they could pass through.

Ye Yuan said to the old drunkard with clasped hands, “Many thanks, Senior!”

The old drunkard took a swig of alcohol and waved his hand, indicating for them to go up.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s figure disappear into the passageway, a hint of worry flashed across the old drunkard’s eyes too.

Even though Dustless pledged in all seriousness that Ye Yuan would be fine, this was the Heavenspan Mountain after all, the world’s most powerful existence and also the most terrifying existence.

Ye Yuan was Lord Immortal Grove’s successor after all. If he died just like this, then hope would really be completely extinguished.

...

As soon as they entered the passageway, everyone seemed to have been stripped away of something, and could no longer fly.

A group of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses seemed to have returned to when they were mortals.

The entire Heavenspan Mountain was like an enormous prison.

While they were like birds in a cage.

Zhuo Han used a hateful gaze to look at Ye Yuan and said coldly, “Punk, don’t be smug too early! Entering this passageway, there’s no turning back. You’ll be crushed into minced meat by Heavenly Dao’s pressure!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said, “Idiot, you’d best take care of yourself first. Your jumping up and down appearance is really like a clown. Don’t use this kind of eyes to look at me, if you’re unconvinced, come and hit me!”

“You! I’ll tell you, the guardian can’t leave Southfoot Town. If you have the capabilities, don’t ever leave here!” Zhuo Han said angrily through gnashed teeth.

How could he dare to attack?

They had already entered the passageway now. Once he attacked and provoked heaven’s punishment, he would die until not even dregs remain.

In this place, there was no need for the guardian to come forward to suppress at all. These people, none of them dared to attack.

Very soon, everyone approached the passageway’s entrance. The pressure on everyone also suddenly increased.

The aura of Heavenly Dao became stronger and stronger.

That horrifying aura made people feel like they were restrained in a river of Heavenly Dao, unable to extricate themselves.

But the more it was like so, the more everyone was able to draw close to Heavenly Dao, feel Heavenly Dao’s aura, and also break through easier.

Of course, the Heavenspan Mountain was not almighty.

Some people could consecutively breakthrough realms here, while others could not break through at all.

This had to depend on the individual’s talent.

Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping walked at the back. Feeling the increasingly powerful Heavenly Dao aura, even Ning Tianping started to get worried too.

He was a little worried whether or not Ye Yuan could withstand this kind of Heavenly Dao pressure.

Everyone got out of the passageway one after another, but no one left.

They all wanted to see how Ye Yuan, this Origin Deity Realm martial artist, would be crushed into meat paste by Heavenly Dao.

Leng Qiuling’s hand clenched into a fist, showing the anxiety in her heart.

No idea why, she was very worried about Ye Yuan, worried about seeing that bloody scene appearing.

Zhuo Han and his junior apprentice brothers naturally wanted to see Ye Yuan get crushed into meat paste the most.

Zhuo Han had an excited expression as he kept saying while looking at Ye Yuan, “Die! Die! Die!”

His junior apprentice brothers also looked at Ye Yuan hatefully with excited faces.

“Reckless and blind thing, see if you don’t die!”

“Seeking death! Own-self wants to court death, nobody can stop!”

“Best if he dies until not even dregs remain!”

...

Amidst everyone’s curses, Ye Yuan’s foot finally stepped into the Heavenspan Mountain! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled. The Lesser Heavenspan Mountain within his body emitted a series of roaring sounds.

A burst of inspiration rushed to his head, making Ye Yuan have a feeling of sudden epiphany!

That shackle which stopped him for 300 years was finally unlocked by him at this moment!

At this moment, Ye Yuan practically wanted to sing at the top of his voice.

This invigorating feel simply could not be described using words.

The changes within Ye Yuan’s body, outsiders naturally could not feel it.

Zhuo Han only saw Ye Yuan’s entire body shudder as if he could not bear Heavenly Dao’s pressure.

He and his junior apprentice brothers had looks of anticipation, waiting for Ye Yuan to be crushed.

However, Ye Yuan still stood there.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes and said with a faint smile, “What are you guys looking at? Watching me get crushed into minced meat by Heavenly Dao? No such thing!”
