Chapter 1666 Blow You to Death!

“Isn’t that so? If I don’t vent it a bit, your father will become a crazy person!” Sun Qing said.

“Yoo, this kid actually broke through! A little interesting, abusing him like this will be more interesting,” Zheng Shan said with a cold smile.

A fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord and three fourth-layered heaven Divine Lords, such a line-up naturally would not be scared away by a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

But Huang Hai’s expression was slightly dark as he said, “Where’s Ye Yuan? That punk didn’t dare to come out and let you come and seek your doom?”

“Heh, seek my doom? Right, sending you all to death! Dealing with the few of you, this young master alone is enough. How is there a need for His Excellency to take action?” Ning Tianping said with a cold smile.

Ning Tianping’s words drew a burst of derisive laughter from the four.

“Hahaha, what did I hear just now? Brother Xiang, he’s dealing with the four of us alone! I’m so scared!” Sun Qing said with a loud laugh.

The other three people also had mocking looks. Clearly, they heard a very hilarious joke.

A fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord kid, dealing with even one of them was enough for him to choke on. To actually brag about going one-versus-four, this was clearly a joke.

Xiang Yunfei said with a smile, “Then let’s take a look at how much capability this kid has!”

Xiang Yunfei signaled the other three with his eyes. The three people understood and immediately closed in, surrounding Ning Tianping in the middle.

With this, he would be hard-pressed to escape even if he grew wings.

Ning Tianping did not have the intention of escaping at all, allowing them to surround him.

Xiang Yunfei laughed savagely. Suddenly, a palm struck Ning Tianping.

At the same time, the other three people were also waiting in full battle-array, not giving Ning Tianping a chance to dodge.

They were forcing Ning Tianping to clash head-on with Xiang Yunfei!

Fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord and fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord, this was very life-threatening.

However, Ning Tianping laughed coldly and advanced instead of backing down!

There was suddenly an additional bracelet in his hand. It was shockingly a middle-rank divine lord mystic treasure.

Xiang Yunfei’s gaze turned intent and he said in pleasant surprise, “Middle-rank divine lord mystic treasure!”

What Xiang Yunfei himself used was still an initial-rank divine lord mystic treasure. Seeing the middle-rank divine lord mystic treasure, he was naturally very moved.

Ning Tianping had a mocking look as he said, “You like it? Then it’s all yours! Explode for me!”

At this moment, Ning Tianping’s divine essence poured into that bracelet frenziedly. A horrifying aura instantly burst out!

Xiang Yunfei was still wildly ecstatic earlier. But in the next second, his hair stood on end.

“You lunatic, you’ll die too!” Xiang Yunfei roared.

However, it was already too late.

Rumble!

That bracelet was directly detonated by Ning Tianping. Half the sky was blown until it shook.

That horrifying aura could virtually flatten a mountain.

Xiang Yunfei was blown until he flew out backward, unable to maintain his figure in the air at all.

The other three people were also caught off-guard by this sudden change, being affected to a varying degree.

“This kid is simply a madman! He thinks that this way, it can blow this old man to death?” Xiang Yunfei vomited fresh blood wildly as he bellowed angrily.

He did not expect that Ning Tianping was actually so determined, exchanging for his serious injury at the cost of his life.

Detonating mystic treasure this kind of thing could be said to be the last resort.

Want to affect the other party, one must approach with his own body.

If you detonate at a place very far from him, by the time the explosive force affected the other party, he would had long vanished without a trace.

That was suicide, not mutual destruction.

Now that Ning Tianping detonated the mystic treasure, Xiang Yunfei naturally thought that he was already dead.

But right at this time, a cold voice sounded out in his ears.

“Can’t blow to death? Then one more time!”

Ning Tianping’s voice seemed very excited. Clearly, he detonated to his heart’s content just now.

No need for any flashy play, no need to practice whatever martial technique, just blow up, blow up, blow up!

Tycoons were awesome!

Rumble!

Another divine lord mystic treasure exploded. Xiang Yunfei had yet to react in time and was blasted flying again.

It was only to see his figure keep tumbling in the air, smashing onto the ground heavily, being knocked out cold.

A powerful fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord was brought down by two claps of thunder just like that.

The other three people’s scalps tingled, turning tail and running.

However, they already suffered considerable injuries. How could they be as fast as Ning Tianping?

“I detonate!”

“I’ll blow you to death!”

“Didn’t you guys chase to your heart’s content? Feels good now, right? Mn?”

...

Horrifying energy undulations came from the sky from time to time, akin to peals of muffled thunder.

Before long, Huang Hai three people were already blown into smithereens, not even leaving behind residue.

“Hahaha! It’s really too awesome! Your Excellency, this feeling of being a tycoon is really refreshing! Don’t care what cultivation method you have, don’t care what martial technique you have, blast one by one just like that, everything is leveled to the ground!”

Ning Tianping had lived for so long, it was his first time feeling what was called as a true tycoon.

Even in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City in the past, he also could not possibly scatter money like it was dirt in this manner!

Divine lord mystic treasures, even if you had hundreds of billions, you might not be able to buy so many too. How could he crush all the way like now?

Of course, if there wasn’t Ye Yuan acting in concert by the side, helping him avoid the explosions with spatial laws, one divine lord mystic treasure could blast him to death already, how could it be so refreshing? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Detonating five to six middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures in a row, it directly exterminated a group of middle-stage Divine Lord powerhouses.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Without middle-stage Divine Lord cultivation, you can’t even detonate a middle-rank divine lord mystic treasure. Therefore, cultivation is still the most important!”

Ning Tianping smiled and said, “Haha, what Your Excellency said is true, I was just making a joke. Seeing you use this kind of method to blow people up the last time, it felt incomparably refreshing. Now that I experienced it myself, it’s indeed freaking amazing! Hahaha!”

What jumping realms to battle? In front of detonating divine lord mystic treasures, it was really weak to the max!

To Divine Lord Realm powerhouses, divine lord mystic treasures were as precious as their lives.

However, Ye Yuan actually casually used them to detonate. It was truly extravagant to the extreme.

Swoosh!

Ning Tianping was currently being pleased with himself when suddenly, a figure on the ground dashed into the distance with extreme speed.

Ning Tianping’s expression changed and he said angrily, “That guy actually didn’t die yet! He was feigning death just now!”

That figure was none other than precisely Xiang Yunfei.

He suffered two waves of explosions in a row just now but did not know what to do.

Now, seeing Ning Tianping relax, he immediately cast a secret art to escape.

While talking, Ning Tianping was about to go and chase after, but Ye Yuan stopped him and said, “He used a secret art, so you can’t catch up. Leave him be.”

Ning Tianping was very remorseful and angry and said dejectedly, “It’s all my fault. I was too careless!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “He suffered heavy injuries and also cast a secret art. Even if he can recover, he’s unable to return to the peak anymore either, equivalent to being a cripple. Now that the trouble is resolved, let’s go!”

Ning Tianping nodded his head and returned to the Purple Extreme Hall dejectedly.

Purple Extreme Hall turned into a stream of flowing light and sped like the wind into the distance.

Without several Divine Lord Realm powerhouses restraining, the Purple Extreme Hall’s speed was swift to the extreme, vanishing at the end of the sky in a blink.

A baleful gaze looked in the direction the Purple Extreme Hall disappeared and said in a cold voice, “Looking at their direction, could it be that they are going to the Heavenspan Mountain? Really failed miserably at a simple task! I didn’t expect that this kid actually had such means! However, not avenging this enmity, I, Xiang Yunfei, is less than human!”
