Chapter 2095: Warning

“It’s actually a spatial node technique! This guy’s grasp over spatial law actually already reached such an extent?”

Empyrean Tian Jue was dumbfounded with amazement as he looked at this scene.

Originally thought that Loneswan two people were dead for sure, who would have thought that they suddenly used spatial node technique, escaping away.

Even if there was a late-stage Empyrean mighty expert like Empyrean Vast Wind, he also could not hold these two back.

Spatial node technique was an extremely profound application of spatial law. There were also scanty few Empyrean powerhouses that could grasp it.

The so-called spatial node technique was leaving behind a marker in some nodal point of space, and imprinting it onto some object with extremely complicated spatial secret art.

As long as one crushed this item, they would be able to trigger the spatial secret art and transport the person around it to that spatial node.

This kind of transportation was something instantaneous. Unless one’s spatial law attainments reached a certain realm, otherwise, it was very hard to keep the other party behind.

“Damn it! This spatial node technique can’t transport you two too far. After this Empyrean kills that wicked thing, I’ll come and take care of both of you!” Empyrean Vast Wind’s words appeared somewhat having become somewhat angry from embarrassment.

The other people were silent like cicadas in winter, all not daring to speak.

It was just that toward this scene just now, they were secretly startled.

In this Northernmost Steppe, there were few who could escape from under Empyrean Vast Wind’s hands so effortlessly.

“Tian Jue, Mie Yu, Zhen Huang, the three of you each lead a team and pincer Ye Yuan from three directions. If you guys let him escape, this Empyrean will exterminate your clans!” Empyrean Vast Wind said in a thunderous rage.

The three people’s faces were slightly fearful, nodding their heads and answering yes one after another.

Empyrean Vast Wint already planted a divine sense imprint on Ye Yuan, the three people chased after following the aura.

Empyrean Vast Wind gave a cold snort and took a step out.

“Brother Tian Jue, this kid’s spatial law is so impressive, but why is he hobbling slowly over there?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Empyrean Shen Luo sensed that Empyrean Vast Wind’s divine sense imprint speed of moving was not fast, and instead like it was sightseeing.

Empyrean Tian Jue’s brows furrowed and he said, “Humph! Conceited fool! No matter how great this kind of person’s talent is, it’s also impossible to rise up. Let’s hasten our footsteps! The southwest direction is the Demon Divine Region. Once let him escape to the Demon Divine Region, that will be like a fish entering the sea.”

Empyrean Shen Luo nodded slightly, the party’s speed increasing a little.

After half a day, above a stretch of wilderness, more than a dozen figures stepped out of the air.

Ahead, a youth in white stood with his hands behind his back, traveling leisurely and carefree.

When the youth in white saw Tian Jue and the rest, he flashed a smile and said, “Only came now. You guys are too slow.”

Empyrean Tian Jue’s two eyes narrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “You’re Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right, it’s precisely this Ye.”

“You knew that we were coming?” Empyrean Tian Jue’s brows furrowed, feeling puzzled in his heart.

In his view, Ye Yuan should be escaping in a panic right now.

But looking at Ye Yuan’s appearance, it seemed like he was sightseeing, deliberately waiting for them to come.

He only felt that Ye Yuan was foolish before, not knowing that they were pursuing.

However, the moment Ye Yuan saw then, his face did not have the slightest expression of surprise. It was as if he knew about them chasing him long ago.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “That Feng Tianyang fused three power of laws. No matter where he’s at, he’s a peerless genius. Empyrean Vast Wind naturally dotes on him dearly. I killed him, so it’s impossible for Empyrean Vast Wind to regard it like he didn’t see it.”

The moment Ye Yuan said it like this, Empyrean Tian Jue’s brows knitted even tighter.

Ye Yuan’s logic was extremely clear, not at all like a slow-witted person.

How could such a person possibly resign himself to death here?

“Then why didn’t you run?” Empyrean Tian Jue said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Although I’m proficient in spatial law, in front of a middle-stage Empyrean powerhouse, I can’t escape at all. Since I can’t run, then might as well don’t run anymore.”

Although Ye Yuan’s spatial law was impressive, in terms of speed, it was at most only comparable to the initial-stage Empyrean Realm.

In front of middle-stage Empyrean Realms, there was no possibility of escaping at all.

The Northernmost Steppe was a vast territory that was immense; sufficient for Empyrean Vast Wind to catch up to him.

Therefore, Ye Yuan never planned on escaping at all.

As for Empyrean Ice Cloud, she just forcefully increased her strength with a secret art and did not count as a true middle-stage Empyrean Realm at all. Hence, that was why Ye Yuan could catch up to her very quickly.

“In that case, you’re planning on surrendering without resistance?” Empyrean Tian Jue said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Surrendering without resistance? Huhu,

you’re thinking too much. Waiting for you guys here, I just want to tell Empyrean Vast Wind that he can’t kill me.”

Tian Jue laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “If you have the Heaven Shocking Lightning in your possession, he indeed can’t kill you. But you actually used such a precious treasure to kill one Ice Cloud. So what reliance do you have now?”

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back and said coolly, “How can my means be what you can imagine?”

Ye Yuan had a look of composure as if these Empyreans were all ants.

Right at this time, an astonishing aura descended. A middle-aged in azure robes slowly stepped out. Who could it be if not Empyrean Vast Wind?

His gaze fell on Ye Yuan, cold until it pierced the bones.

“You’re Ye Yuan?” Empyrean Vast Wind said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan sized Empyrean Vast Wind up for a bit and said coolly, “Well-worthy of being the extreme north’s number one person. The aura on your body is much stronger compared to them. No wonder you could groom a genius like Feng Tianyang.”

Empyrean Vast Wind was taken aback. This boy actually still had the mood to appraise him?

“Humph! You still have the gall to mention Tianyang! Since you got caught up by this Empyrean, I believe that you already came to understand, right?” Empyrean Vast Wind said coldly.

“Came to understand? What’s that? I stayed behind just to warn you that Feng Tianyang coveted Lu-er’s Profound Yin Divine Physique, his crime deserving more than death. This matter ends here. If you refuse to stop, bear the consequences yourself!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“You are warning this Empyrean?”

A hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of Empyrean Vast Wind’s mouth, seeming to find it very funny.

But Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right. It’s warning you.”

The other Empyreans’ faces all revealed very comical looks. Clearly, they all felt that Ye Yuan’s words were very hilarious.

“Heh, looks like you’re impenetrably thickheaded. Then ... this Empyrean will send you off! Relax, I won’t let you die so easily. This Empyrean will extract your divine soul and refine for 100 thousand years. I’ll let you know the taste of despair.”

Empyrean Vast Wind’s aura suddenly rose, gradually reaching the peak. Then, he pressed a palm over toward Ye Yuan.

The moment a Seventh Firmament Empyrean made his move, how shocking was the commotion.

The other Empyreans’ faces all changed, looking at this scene in incredible shock.

Too strong!

This palm virtually represented the apex of the Northernmost Steppe.

However, right at this time, a figure flashed out of the void.

That figure similarly smacked a palm out. The commotion was extremely shocking and actually roughly on par with Empyrean Vast Wind.

Bang!

A horrifying air billow came over. Even those Sixth Firmament Empyreans could not stand firm either, almost dropping down from the sky.

Empyrean Vast Wind’s figure flew out backward. He looked at this figure in great shock and said, “Huntwind, what’s the meaning of this? This is my human race’s internal affairs. If you intervene, it’s becoming enemies with the entire extreme north’s human race!”
