Chapter 1640 Besieged on All Sides

Backing out of the Selfless Realm, Ye Yuan’s eyes revealed a complicated look.

“Senior, it looks like ... there’s only this last path that can be taken!” Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said to Dustless.

Presently, Ye Yuan could already enter the Selfless Realm at any time.

However, under the Selfless Realm, Ye Yuan came up with various methods many times and was still unable to create the fourth layer cultivation method.

Over these 300 years, the methods that Ye Yuan derived were no less than several tens of thousands. But not a single one could work.

Dustless nodded and said, “It can only be like this! These few years, you’ve attempted countless times before, wanting to open up an inner world, but it just doesn’t work. Could it be that this fourth layer cultivation method really doesn’t need to open up an inner world?”

Ye Yuan’s journey of the heart these few years, Dustless naturally took it into his sights.

But the final result, Dustless was also very perplexed.

These few years, Ye Yuan had always been attempting to find ways to open up an inner world, but it would not work no matter what.

His divine sea seemed to be sealed, unable to open up a gap no matter what.

Regarding repeated failures, Ye Yuan had long already achieved being rippleless like a dried-up well. He said, “I have a feeling that I might really have gone the wrong direction these few years. It’s just that no opening up an inner world, how this path should be taken makes me very confused.”

Dustless said, “This old man is unable to imagine it. Without opening up an inner world, how can one break through to the Divine Lord Realm? The might of the Divine Lord Realm lies in world power. Without an inner world, where’s the world power? Even if you break through to the Divine Lord Realm, how can you fight with powerhouses at the same realm?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This is also the problem that has always troubled me. Most likely, the key to breaking through lies here!”

Dustless heaved a sigh and said, “Right now, you can only go to the Heavenspan Mountain. However, the Heavenspan Mountain isn’t some otherworldly paradise. Your strength going there is still rather insufficient.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it. No matter how tough this hurdle is, I have to make it through too!”

...

The moment Ye Yuan entered the hall, the atmosphere inside immediately became strange.

Originally, Ye Yuan was Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s rising star, gloriously resplendent, no one dared to slight him.

But now, the halo of a genius already faded. People’s perception toward Ye Yuan was also quietly undergoing change.

In this world where the strong reigned supreme, weaklings could only be eliminated.

A fallen genius was not sufficient to get their high regard, even if he had performed deeds of valor for Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

These few years, Ye Yuan used medicinal pills to groom no idea how many powerhouses for Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Even new Divine Lord Realm powerhouses also had close to 100 more out of nowhere in these 300 years!

And this number was virtually several times of normal circumstances.

These few years, Ye Yuan left behind hundreds of new pill formulas for the Pill Tower. It could be said to benefit all generations. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ning Siyu, Lu Yi, and the rest, their Alchemy Dao strength advanced by leaps and bounds under Ye Yuan’s grooming.

Ye Yuan revamped spatial laws anew for the Martial Tower, making it possible to comprehend spatial laws, similarly blessing for ages to come.

A period of 300 years might not be that long to a Deity Realm powerhouse, but Ye Yuan’s contributions to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was what these elders were unable to compare to.

But this was no use!

Not being able to break through to the Divine Lord Realm, Ye Yuan, this Three-star Alchemy God, was far less significant to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City already.

Above the high hall, an old man sat at the top, looking somewhat fleeting and ephemeral.

Celestial Deity Realm powerhouses rarely showed face. Ye Yuan had lived for 400 over years in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, it was still his first time seeing the Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse here.

And this time, he also truly felt the might of Celestial Deity Realm martial artists!

Over 300 years ago, the Celestial Deity powerhouses Ye Yuan met at the Fiend Calling Ridge had their realms suppressed. The pressure brought on him was far from as great.

Even returning above later, they were also seriously injured, their strength less than 10%.

This Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse was called He Chong, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s grand elder.

“I pay respects to Grand Elder!” Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said to He Chong.

He Chong nodded slightly and said, “Sit then.”

Coldfeather and Xuan Yu looked at Ye Yuan with complicated expressions, having unspeakable melancholy in their hearts.

The current situation was already not what they could control.

It was not just Ruo Xu their lineage’s people were kicking up a fuss. Right now, even the elders on their own side were also calling Ye Yuan, this elder, into question.

After all, a genius who could not break through to the Divine Lord Realm was nothing!

When all of the elders were seated, He Chong slowly said, “Ruo Xu, today’s elders meeting, you preside over it.”

Ruo Xu was delighted when he heard it and said, “Yes, Grand Elder!”

While talking, Ruo Xu was rather excited.

Back then, he utterly lost his face at Ye Yuan’s hands. Until now, he still had not recovered.

After many years, he finally found an opportunity to trample Ye Yuan away. So how could he not be excited?

As for Ling Zikun’s matter, it was merely a minor incident[1].

Now, many years had already passed, he naturally would not keep it in mind.

Ruo Xu swept a glance around and said, “Convening everyone here today, I presume everybody has a score in their hearts. Right now, quite a number of people in the city have quite a bit of veiled criticism towards one of our elders, thinking that his strength isn’t adequate to take on the role of elder. Originally, this was just a small number of people commenting. But in the course of time, the strength of this elder of ours did not advance an inch. The people talking behind his back also became more and more. As a last resort, the elders meeting this time needs to be conducted. So everybody should talk about their own views first.”

While talking, Ruo Xu signaled several confidants with his eyes. Those few elders immediately understood.

An elder spoke up, “There’s no denying that this elder had once amazed us! But, he has also deluded us, making us have a misconception, thinking that he can definitely soar to the heavens in one bound, even bringing our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to a higher level. But looking at it now, everything is a false impression! Letting a person who can’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm be an elder, this is simply the imperial city’s shame!”

The moment he finished talking, another elder followed up, “It’s really too ironic! My disciple only used 30 years and broke through from grand completion Origin Deity to first-layered heaven Divine Lord. This elder used a full 300 years, but couldn’t even breakthrough to half-step Divine Lord. How can this kind of mediocre talent take on the position of elder?”

Xuan Yu furrowed his brows and said in a solemn voice, “Huang Wenhao, do you want face saying this or not? Don’t you forget how your disciple broke through to the Divine Lord Realm!”

Huang Wenhao did not dare to rebut Xuan Yu, but said, “Head Elder, your words are wrong. Ye Yuan helped my disciple refine the Vastsun Universe Pill, but his talent is already there. Even if he didn’t consume the medicinal pill, he’d break through in at most 50 years too. Not like some people, unable to break through in even 300 years!”

Xuan Yu could not help choking when he heard that and was actually somewhat exasperated.

Huang Wenhao’s words made him unable to refute.

Coldfeather’s gaze swept around and he said in a cold voice, “You ungrateful things! These few years, how many of you didn’t benefit from Ye Yuan? Now, throwing a rock down the well, it’s not even veiled at all!”
