Chapter 2343: A Strange Couple

Just as Qin Hu two people were frightened until they did not dare to go out of the city, Ye Yuan had long already left Cloudaid City.

He naturally would not really accompany these two people and keep on playing. Furthermore, he knew that with those few times, those two likely did not dare to go out of the city anymore as well.

He had also earned enough god of war points from these two and there was nothing to mess with anymore.

However, those two were intimidated from killing and did not dare to gamble at all.

They would rather be killed by Heavenly Dao than be willing to give Ye Yuan god of war points anymore.

Sun Moon Canyon was a relatively dangerous place around Cloudaid City.

In the canyon, there were many middle-stage Heavenly Emperor Realm fierce beasts coming and going.

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, this place was clearly the most suitable cultivation place.

Before leaving, Ye Yuan made another trip to Spirit Treasure Hall and used Qin Hu two people’s god of war points, and exchanged for 36 low-grade Heavenly Emperor spirit treasures.

He made a slight modification to the sword formation, with 12 peak heavenly emperor spirit treasures as the core, 48 low-grade heavenly emperor spirit treasures as auxiliary, driving a thousand Empyrean spirit treasures.

This way, with the augmentation of peak heavenly emperor spirit treasures, the power of the sword formation grew even stronger.

In the Primeval War Realm, as long as one left the city, there was a possibility of encountering dangers at any time.

Of course, the closer to the cities the place, the weaker the fierce beasts. The further away from the cities the place, the stronger the fierce beasts.

Walking all this way, Ye Yuan killed many fierce beasts, but the god of war points obtained were not a lot.

Only all the way until now did he know how hard it was to obtain god of war points.

Killing low-level fierce beasts did not seem to have many gods of war points.

While killing high-level fierce beasts, after your ranking became high, the god of war points obtained would get lesser and lesser.

There would come a day where your bottleneck would arrive.

So in this place, you needed to keep on getting stronger, before you could surpass yourself.

“Eh, hubby, there’s a young fellow here!”

“You’re not allowed to look! Keep looking and I’ll kill him!”

“Hehe, hubby, I just like your jealous appearance! Why not, we kill him together?”

“Muack muack,

wifey, I also love your beautiful and charming appearance the most! However, this little fellow’s realm is too low, there’s also no benefit in killing him, spare him then.”

“Hehe, my hubby is the most, most kind! Love you!”

“Muack muack, wifey, I love you too!”

... ...

All of a sudden, a man and a woman walked over from not far away.

The two people’s conversation made Ye Yuan feel a chill.

This was clearly a pair of Dao companions. It was just that the two were chummy until it made people despair when they were talking.

Ye Yuan looked over, the man was unbelievably ugly, and the woman was well-matched with him.

Then the man said that the woman was beautiful and charming, while the woman said that the man was handsome and tall.

He really did not know where their courage came from.

These two people were really one family. Not entering the household door, they were quite a lively pair of living treasures.

But such a pair of ugly man and woman, they were actually unpredictable children too. It still made Ye Yuan quite surprised.

As the saying went, one should not judge other people based on their looks. It was probably like this.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to pay attention to the two either and planned on leaving straightaway.

If they were to really make a move, he was naturally not afraid either.

Who would have expected that he was about to leave when that woman suddenly said, “Little Brother, your strength is too low. Why not come together with us? Us husband and wife will protect you!”

The moment the man heard, he was immediately enraged and said, “Argh, infuriating me to death, you still said that you didn’t take fancy on this pretty boy!”

The woman rolled her eyes and said, “Silly darling! I saw that this babe is friendly and thought of our baby! If he was still alive, he’d probably be as handsome as him, right?”

As she said, the woman actually shed tears.

The moment the man heard, he also fell silent, and actually choked silently.

Ye Yuan originally did not want to care about the two but seeing the two get worked up, not seeming to be fake, he felt awkward to leave as well.

However, when he was just about to open his mouth to refuse, the man suddenly said, “Kid, you heard it, my wife sees that you’re pitiful. In this Sun Moon Canyon, stick around with us husband and wife then!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said with cupped fists, “Many thanks for your husband and wife’s kindness, but I’m used to traveling alone and won’t impose on you two.”

His words were said very courteously.

After all, they had good intentions. So Ye Yuan naturally maintained some respect.

It was just that the moment the man heard, he was indignant.

His face turned sullen, and he said in a solemn voice, “Asked you to follow, just follow. What’s with all the crap?”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he could not help shaking his head. They were truly a pair of weirdos.

The moment the woman heard, she hurriedly said, “Goodness gracious, you silly darling. What will you do if you frightened that kid? Little brother, this place is really very dangerous! Furthermore, there are also a lot of bad guys in Sun Moon Canyon. You should follow us. We can share some god of war points with you!”

This woman was really protecting him like protecting a calf.

However, Ye Yuan himself came to train in the first place. What the hell would it be if he followed these two?

Hence, he could only refuse this kind-intention.

Ye Yuan cupped his fists once more and said, “Madam, this Ye really appreciates your kind intentions. It’s just that this Ye came here to train. It’s seriously hard to follow you two. Farewell, the two of you.”

As he said, Ye Yuan turned around and was about to leave.

But right at this time, there was suddenly a blur in front of his eyes, that man blocked in front of him.

The man had a grim look, appearing very angry, and said, “You punk, don’t know how to appreciate favors! Since you’re not willing to follow us, then I can only use force!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan could not help being unable to stifle his laughter when he heard it. Heard before forcing a sale, never heard before compelling to follow and cultivate.

“This big brother, if you can keep this Ye behind, then there’s also no harm in this Ye follow you guys!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The man said, “Heh heh, punk, what high-sounding sentiments! You still don’t know the two of us husband and wife’s titles, right? The two of us are Heaven Mandarin and Earth Duck[1]. We’re very famous in the Heavenspan World too!”

Ye Yuan was aloof and indifferent and said coolly, “Senior Heaven Mandarin, please!”

Heaven Mandarin’s face turned black. A punch suddenly struck over.

But his attack clearly held back some strength. In his view, how could Ye Yuan’s small body withstand his one punch?

While Earth Duck smiled by the side and did not speak, an appearance of watching a show.

Facing this punch, Ye Yuan did not avoid it and similarly threw a punch over.

He understood that he could only talk to this Heaven Mandarin with strength!

Boom!

A loud bang came over, Ye Yuan did not budge an inch, while Heaven Mandarin fell several steps back.

A tremendous force transmitted into his bosom and he hurriedly revolved divine essence to dispel it.

This punch, Ye Yuan similarly did not use his full strength too.

But this husband and wife two people had surprised expressions, clearly not expecting that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so strong.

“Perfect eighth transformation! Kid, I couldn’t tell that you still have some real skills!” Heaven Mandarin said in surprise.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Heaven Mandarin, can this Ye go now?”

Who knew that Heaven Mandarin shook his head and said, “The two of us husband and wife mean what we say. Ask you to follow, you have to follow! Keep being long-winded and I’m going to be serious!”

Ye Yuan also had some anger aroused from being repeatedly harassed by these two people.

These two were clearly harassing with unreasonable demands.

“Is that so? Then this Ye will have to witness Senior Heaven Mandarin’s brilliant moves! Please!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

[1] A play on words, mandarin ducks mean an affectionate couple.
