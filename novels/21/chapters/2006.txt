Chapter 2010: Repeated Surprises

“It’s another two Empyrean powerhouses!”

“My God, is this a magic trick?”

“Sure enough, Lord Ye Yuan’s methods are inconceivable!”

...

Looking at those two figures above the void, the martial artists in the city seethed with excitement.

Their eyes were full of worship, already treating Ye Yuan as a godlike existence.

Back then, when Lu Ziyi came to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, how insufferably arrogant was she?

These Empyrean powerhouses were high and mighty, aloof from the world.

But now, their faces were slapped resoundingly by Lord Ye Yuan.

These martial artists, who were living at the bottom, were really satisfied to the max.

Everyone knew that Empyrean powerhouses could not be opposed, but no one could have thought that Ye Yuan actually magicked out three Empyrean powerhouses like a magic trick.

You send an army of 100 thousand, I annihilated all of your True God powerhouses.

You had three great Empyreans come, I’ll magick out three great Empyreans!

No matter what means you have, in front of Lord Ye Yuan, you could only be crushed dejectedly.

“Is an Empyrean very impressive?”

This sentence was still ringing in his ears!

It was not that Ye Yuan was arrogant, but that he really had the capital to look down on Lu Yan.

These two great Empyreans that suddenly appeared, one had an old figure, but was in good health; the other reached middle-aged, seemingly in high and vigorous spirit.

However, Deng Yunzai and Dai Chunhao’s current gazes were all gathered on that middle-aged person, full of disbelief.

“Duan Yi!” Two people cried out in surprise at the same time, gazes full of disbelief.

This middle-aged person, they all recognized him, it was precisely Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s tower lord, Duan Yi!

They were too familiar with Duan Yi. He had already been stuck at peak Ninth Firmament True God Realm for several hundred thousand years.

Barring no accidents, it was totally impossible to break through to the Empyrean Realm.

But the problem was, something impossible had occurred now!

“You ... You actually broke through to the Empyrean Realm?”

Deng Yunzai felt that this world was too crazy. Was the Empyrean Realm so easy to breakthrough to?

Duan Yi smiled and said, “A fluke, a fluke! For this Duan to be able to break through, it was all thanks to Elder Ye’s credit. If not for him refining a Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill for this Duan, this Duan can forget about breaking through to the realm of Empyrean in this lifetime.”

The pupils of Deng and Dai two people constricted, crying out in surprise, “H-Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill! How is this possible?”

Duan Yi just smiled and said, “What does the Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill count for to Elder Ye? His methods, you all can’t imagine it at all. Otherwise, how could he become our Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder?”

“H-Head Elder?”

These two people seemed to have been struck by bolts of lightning, standing transfixed on the spot.

They only thought that Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao strength was decent. How could they have imagined that Ye Yuan was actually the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder?

Alchemy Celestial Pavilion elders, they were all peak Six-star Alchemy Gods, and their strengths were exceedingly formidable.

Ye Yuan, a mere Third Firmament True God, actually overpowered a group of peak Sixth Firmament Alchemy Gods?

They suddenly discovered that their understanding of Ye Yuan was far too little!

In Martial Dao, Ye Yuan slew Lu Ziyi who comprehended the laws of five elements.

In Poison Dao, Ye Yuan refined a formation in the void, eradicating thousands of True God powerhouses.

In Alchemy Dao, Ye Yuan even refined the Heaven Seizing Good Fortune Pill, letting the Duan Yi who could not break through to the Empyrean Realm for several hundred thousand years, to now successfully break through becoming an Empyrean.

Living to a ripe old age, they had never seen before such a monstrous figure too!

Far away, the Lu Yan in the middle of a great battle was similarly incomparably shocked in his heart.

He never thought that the land he governed actually produced such an alchemy-martial dual unrivaled prodigy.

But, under this kind of circumstances, both parties already did not have room to salvage it!

“Stop talking nonsense with them! Those two people merely just broke through to Empyrean Realm. Hurry up and take care of them! Don’t you guys want to avenge Deng Wei’s and Dai Yang’s enmity?” Lu Yan said with a cold shout.

Dai Chunhao’s gaze turned to the other old man, his gaze cold as he said, “Who is your esteemed self? Why are you intervening in my Five Firmament’s affairs?”

It was only to see that old man said coolly, “This old man was originally Extreme Light Imperial City’s Profound Secrets Pavilion’s pavilion lord, Jian Hongxiao. Obtaining Ye Yuan’s help, I returned to Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital now and embarrassingly I am now a Stellar Hall’s elder!”

“What? You ... You’re Jian Hongxiao? Weren’t you a Celestial Deity Realm martial artist? Why ... Why did you also break through to the Empyrean Realm now?”

Deng and Dai two people were practically about to break down.

Information about this Jian Hongxiao, they naturally knew. After all, Extreme Light Imperial City was not considered far from Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital.

This Ye Yuan really seemed to be performing a magic trick, turning a Fourth Firmament True God into a Second Firmament True God in a short time, and similarly turning a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse into a First Firmament Empyrean.

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “This Empyrean got a backlash from Heavenly Dao back then. My strength greatly diminished. That’s why I would lay dormant in Extreme Light Imperial City. Now, obtaining Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill, not only did my strength recover full, it even improved a step further, breaking through to the Empyrean Realm.”

These two people were turning numb.

What kind of place was Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital?

That was the Jian Family’s territory!

They could not give Jian Hongxiao face, but could it be that they were not going to give face to Jian Sutao behind Jian Hongxiao?

Moreover, there was even a Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets that the entire Heavenspan World dreaded behind them!

Deng Yunzai and Dai Chunhao exchanged a glance. Suddenly, their gazes turned sharp.

“Gentlemen, Ye Yuan and our enmity cannot coexist under the same sky! Today, no matter what identity you have, those who dare bar us from capturing Ye Yuan, we’ll determine life and death!” Deng Yunzai said ferociously.

Asking them to stomach this grievance, they seriously could not do it!

It was just that their threat did not have any effect at all. Duan Yi just said coolly, “Ye Yuan is my Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder, so this Empyrean naturally has to ensure his safety. Want to fight, then fight!”

Jian Hongxiao also had a calm face as he said, “Ye Yuan and I are sworn friends for life. Want to kill him, step over this Empyrean’s corpse!”

As he said, Duan Yi and Jian Hongxiao two people turned their palms over, each taking out a weapon.

In Duan Yi’s hand was a bone sword.

In Jian Hongxiao’s hand was a war banner.

“E-Empyrean spirit treasures! You guys just broke through to the Empyrean Realm not long and you actually have empyrean spirit treasures already?” Deng Yunzai was practically going mad.

These two empyrean spirit treasures were naturally the bone sword and Stellar War Banner.

These two empyrean spirit treasures when placed in Duan Yi’s and Jian Hongxiao’s hands, the power was more than a magnitude stronger than in Ye Yuan’s hands.

“Want to fight, then fight! What’s with all these nonsense?”

Duan Yi laughed coldly. Thrusting a sword out, the wind and clouds changed colors.

The moment Jian Hongxiao’s Stellar War Banner unfurled, horrifying stellar energy swept over towards Dai Chunhao.

Four Empyrean powerhouses instantly clashed together.

Although Duan Yi and Jian Hongxiao two people just entered Empyrean, what they consumed were vast spirit divine pills. Their realm had long already consolidated. There was no way they looked like they just entered the Empyrean Realm.

Coupled with the empyrean spirit treasures in their hands, after both sides came into contact, they directly crushed Deng and Dai two people until they could not breathe.

Over there, Lu Yan became more alarmed the more he fought, and wanted to vomit blood the more he fought.

When Bai Tong made his move, he did not defend at all!

Only after several exchanges did Lu Yan discover that Bai Tong was actually wearing an empyrean spirit treasure on his body!

Bai Tong was holding an offensive-type empyrean spirit treasure in his hand, and he was wearing a defensive-type empyrean spirit treasure on his body. However, the two people’s cultivation realms were more or less the same. So how could Lu Yan fight against him?

After a few exchanges, Lu Yan could only defend passively. How was there still strength to counterattack?
