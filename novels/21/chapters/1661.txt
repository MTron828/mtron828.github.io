Chapter 1665 Unbelievably Stifled

“Spatial flying-type mystic treasure! Chase! We mustn’t let him escape!”

Xiang Yunfei’s expression changed greatly. Lifting his hand, it was a palm attack again, slamming solidly on the Purple Extreme Hall.

However, the Purple Extreme Hall did not budge an inch! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Huang Hai’s expression changed too, his figure moving swiftly, world power crushing over toward the Purple Extreme Hall crazily.

Four great middle-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouse attacking, how shocking was the impetus?

The berserk world power stuck to the Purple Extreme Hall tightly, slowing down its speed.

“Pummel it brutally for me! When their divine essence stones are exhausted, I want to see if he comes out or not!” Xiang Yunfei shouted loudly.

Therefore, the four people each executed their means, bombarding over towards the Purple Extreme Hall frenziedly.

Within the Purple Extreme Hall, Ye Yuan was completely unruffled, quietly recovering divine essence.

Rumble!

From the outside, massive booming sounds could be heard. Even Ning Tianping’s expression changed slightly too.

Four middle-stage Divine Lord Realms, among them, there was even a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse. This attack was too horrifying.

The divine essence stones supporting the Purple Extreme Hall’s defense were also being consumed wildly.

This time it was different from that incident at the Fiend Calling Ridge. At that time, it was the few Celestial Deity powerhouses who took the enemy too lightly and did not investigate carefully at all. That was how Ye Yuan smoked through.

But this time, the Purple Extreme Hall was right under Xiang Yunfei’s eyelids. Even if turned into a speck of dust, it was also impossible to hide from them.

Mo Lifei looked at this large hall with incredible shock as he said, “This ... Could this be a true god mystic treasure?”

Ning Tianping nodded and said, “That’s right! This is a spatial flying-type true god mystic treasure. But His Excellency hasn’t completely refined it yet. Right now, he can’t unleash its full functions. Otherwise, those few at the outside are nothing to be feared at all.”

Mo Lifei was speechless. He discovered that he could not see through this Ye Yuan more and more.

This guy’s trump cards were simply endless.

Each time he thought that it reached the most dangerous time, Ye Yuan always had a backup move to settle everything.

Mo Lifei suddenly said, “But, with the intensity of their attacks, can our divine essence stones hold out?”

Ning Tianping smiled and said, “Master, you don’t have to worry. His Excellency recently earned 400 billion divine essence stones at Riverluck Capital City. Although he spent 200 billion, there are still 200 billion left. If they want to use up the divine essence stones, let them deplete it then.:

Mo Lifei opened his mouth, shocked until he could not speak.

An Origin Deity Realm having 400 billion divine essence stones on him, this ... was too demoralizing!

...

After a bout of wild bombardment, the four people were tired until they were almost collapsing. But the Purple Extreme Hall still did not budge an inch.

“Damn it! Just how many divine essence stones do they have? To actually be able to hold on until now!” Xiang Yunfei said in a deep voice.

Huang Hai said, “I don’t know how many divine essence stones they have, but it’s a lot! This time, it was originally to help Eldest Young Master to purchase the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone, but it was intercepted by this kid. He spent 110 billion to buy this piece of Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone.”

The moment Sun Qing heard, he said gloomily, “Why didn’t you say so earlier?”

Huang Hai said, “What can be done if said earlier? This spatial flying-type mystic treasure is clearly extraordinary. I reckon that it’s at the very least celestial deity mystic treasure too. We can’t breach the defenses at all! Now, there’s only exhausting their divine essence stones entirely, and then use a powerful attack to shock them to death!”

Xiang Yunfei’s gaze stirred and he said with a nod, “What Old Huang said is right! The only plan now is to drag it out with him. This kid killed Young Patriarch, so we must capture him! Moreover, putting aside other things, this treasure is clearly extraordinary. As long as it can be brought back, it’s enough to compensate for this incident of Young Patriarch’s demise. No matter what, definitely can’t let him leave. We have to pester this flying mystic treasure endlessly and mustn’t let it break free of control!”

The few people nodded one after another when they heard it. Once the Purple Extreme Hall broke free of their control, it would be able to shake them off instantly.

The four people rested for a while, recovered divine essence, and bombarded the Purple Extreme Hall wildly again.

However, the Purple Extreme Hall’s stability made them somewhat despaired.

They unleashed all of their abilities, but they were still unable to deplete completely the Purple Extreme Hall’s divine essence stones.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan’s divine essence finally completely recovered.

“Your Excellency, you finally recovered! These few fellows are pestering the Purple Extreme Hall endlessly, we can’t escape!” Ning Tianping said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If they want to pester, let them pester then. Do you wish to experience the feeling of being a tycoon for once?”

Ning Tianping’s eyes swiveled and he said excitedly, “Of course I want!”

Ye Yuan said, “If you want, cultivate well and quickly break through to become a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord!”

Ning Tianping said with an excited look, “Alright!”

After converting to the Starry Night Vast Cloud Art, Ning Tianping already touched the threshold of fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Breaking through realm was just a matter of sooner or later.

The moment Ye Yuan said it, Ning Tianping immediately understood what Ye Yuan wanted to do.

He was also rather curious just how many divine lord mystic treasures Ye Yuan had on hand.

Detonating initial-rank divine lord mystic treasures previously, Ye Yuan’s divine essence could barely manage to accomplish it.

But middle-rank divine lord mystic treasures were far more stable than initial-rank. Ye Yuan and Ning Tianping could not do it.

But as long as Ning Tianping broke through to fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, everything would naturally happen naturally without extra effort.

Hence, Ning Tianping started closed-seclusion to cultivate, assaulting fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Outside, those four people clearly decided to drag it out with Ye Yuan too, taking turns to bombard the Purple Extreme Hall.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence stones were also being consumed at a rapid rate. But 200 billion divine essence stones were sufficient for them to exhaust for very, very long.

In a blink, more than half a year passed.

On this day, Ning Tianping suddenly opened his eyes. The surrounding spiritual energy gathered over wildly.

All around him were divine essence stones. They were sufficient for him to break through to become a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

“Hahaha, finally broke through!” Ning Tianping said excitedly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s right, even faster than I imagined!”

Ning Tianping said with a loud laugh, “Your Excellency prepared so many resources for me. Coupled with the cultivation method that Master gave me, if I still don’t break through, I can go hit my head and die! Come, these bunch of guys chased us for over half a year already, let’s vent this frustration properly today.”

Ye Yuan casually threw him a few divine lord mystic treasures and said with a smile, “Go on, feel free to detonate them. I’ll ensure your safety!”

Ning Tianping chuckled and said, “Alright!”

...

Xiang Yunfei they all actually almost could not hold on anymore.

But making them leave right now, they were unwilling to either.

“Do these two punks really plan on being cowardly turtles for the rest of their lives?” Sun Qing gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

“Just how much divine essence stones do they have? When will this come to an end?!” Zheng Shan said with a dejected look.

Xiang Yunfei’s gaze was grim as he said, “Truly damn it! With the intensity of our attacks, even hundreds of billions of divine essence stones should be depleted entirely!”

Suddenly, Huang Hai’s gaze turned intent, like he discovered a new continent, shouting excitedly, “Out! They are out! Hahaha, they finally can’t hold on anymore!”

The other three people focused their eyes and looked, and they were immediately greatly aroused!

Sure enough, Ning Tianping came out.

“Hahaha, kid, your divine essence stones are finally running out, right? This half a year’s time, the few of us brothers have been unbelievably stifled! Brothers, we must service this boy properly today!” Xiang Yunfei said with a hideous grin.
