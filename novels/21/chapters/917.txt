Chapter 921: Continuous Unexpected Events!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The fiend race’s act of possession was incomparably tyrannical. In a blink of an eye, there were several powerhouses swathed in fiendish qi from head to toe. Clearly, they were already successfully taken possession of.

The slaughter generals were mostly late-stage Phaseless Realm. After the fiend emperors succeeded in seizing possession, each and every one of their auras skyrocketed, directly breaking through to Dao Profound Realm.

“Je je, our fleshy bodies were suppressed until they rotted. How many years has it been since I’ve savored the taste of a physical body,” a fiend emperor said with a weird laugh.

When the fiend emperors obtained the fleshy bodies, their auras actually surpassed the group of Exalts’ all at once.

“You humans are seriously too weak! All of you, obediently become our fiend slaves!”

The fiend emperors that successfully seized possession rushed forward and clashed together with the Exalts. The Exalts’ pressure immediately soared.

Those Exalts were not some goody-two-shoes. They discovered very quickly that these fiend emperors were very fearful of Ye Yuan. Each and every one of them actually retreated as they fought, luring the fiend emperors over to Ye Yuan there.

“Despicable!” An Ren gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

“Blackwind, escort them away!” when Ye Yuan saw the situation, he said in a solemn voice.

“Yes! Master, be careful!” Blackwind brought everyone along and hastily retreated outwards.

Ye Yuan revolved the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood with all his power, his entire body erupting with powerful lightning powers. His entire person was seemingly a walking lightning ball. Areas that he passed through, all the fiend emperors would avoid like the plague.

Ye Yuan joined the group battle and pinned down quite a number of fiend emperors all at once, and actually turned the situation around in a short while!

“Mu Ta, still not done yet?” a fiend emperor said anxiously.

On the sideline, fiendish qi billowed toward the sky!

The fiend emperor called Mu Ta had just finished taking possession when he erupted with a strength that astounded people.

It was only to see him abruptly open both eyes and said with a hideous grin, “Done. Let these guys become our fiend slaves! That boy seems to be somewhat strange. Entertain him well!”

Mu Ta’s figure suddenly moved, his entire person seemed like a war chariot, abruptly smashing into the fight!

Bang!

An Exalt was directly hit by Mu Ta’s tremendous force, spewed out a large mouthful of blood, and flew out backward.

Seeing this scene, all of the Exalts’ faces changed drastically.

This Mu Ta had at least middle-stage Dao Profound Realm strength!

This guy had just finished taking possession and actually had such terrifying strength!

Netherkill’s eyes glinted, and he said in a deep voice, “Retreat!”

Finished talking, Netherkill’s figure retreated explosively and sped over towards the entrance.

When the group of Exalts saw that even Netherkill had retreated, how could they still dare to continue fighting? Each and every one of them was anxious to escape.

“Hahaha! Want to run? How can it be that easy! Stay behind obediently and be our fiend slaves!”

As Mu Ta laughed loudly, his figure suddenly vanished from sight. His speed was actually even faster than Netherkill.

Bang!

It was an extremely strong collision. Netherkill was actually struck by Mu Ta until he flew back. In one move, whoever was superior was immediately determined!

Even Netherkill was pushed back in one strike. The Exalts’ faces revealed looks of despair. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

These fiend emperors were too strong!

“ARGH!!”

“ARGH!!”

...

A series of miserable screams transmitted over. More and more fiend emperors successfully took possession.

The strength of the fiend emperors over here became stronger and stronger, while the Exalts’ side became increasingly weaker.

A fiend emperor came in front of that Exalt who was struck flying by Mu Ta prior to this and plunged a surge of fiendish sense into his sea of consciousness.

Before long, that Exalt actually stood up and gave a bow to that fiend emperor and said, “This fiend slave has seen Master!”

That fiend emperor laughed out loud and said, “Haha, good! Go and deal with that bunch of fellows for her. Remember, don’t kill them. I want to make them all become fiend slaves!”

“Yes, Master!”

Watching that Exalt become a fiend slave helplessly, the other 11 Exalts all could not help feeling a chill down their spines, having a feeling of the fox mourning the death of a hare.

The fiend race’s fiendish sense was too tyrannical. It did not permit them to resist at all before they were directly devilized.

At this rate, wouldn’t the fiend emperor side becomes stronger and stronger, while their side becomes weaker and weaker?

Unable to run even if they fled, unable to beat them if they fought too. What to do?

“Big Brother Netherkill, fight it out with them! At this rate, everyone is dead!” Blazing Fire shouted fiercely.

Netherkill’s gaze turned cold, and he said with a nod, “Fine! Now that the story’s played out like this, we can only take a final plunge!”

The Netherkill who prepared for a fight to the death suddenly erupted with a powerful aura. A surge of murderous aura that swept away all obstacles swept towards the fiend emperors.

Seeing this scene, all the Exalts felt a great boost in confidence.

Netherkill was the one who was the most unfathomable among these people. Once he brought out his true strength, it was only right that he would not lose to these fiend emperors at the very least.

Who knew that those fiend emperors thought nothing of Netherkill at all, and instead, they burst into laughter as one said, “Haha! This one’s strength is not bad. He’s qualified enough to be our fiend slave! Although the others are also Tier 9 strength, they are still a little lacking.”

Facing such a berserk murderous air, Mu Ta was not cowed in the least, and directly charged forward towards the murderous aura and was actually not affected at all.

Boom!

Under an attack, it was still Mu Ta who took the absolute upper-hand.

When Mu Ta attacked, the other fiend emperors did not idle as well, both sides directly tangling together in battle.

But the current situation was far from good. The people on the fiend emperors’ side became more and more and already occupied a crushing advantage.

It was just a matter of time for the Exalts’ side to lose.

But at the same time, a fiend emperor pestered Ye Yuan. He was clearly quite fearful of Ye Yuan and did not dare to approach too close. But if Ye Yuan wanted to leave, he absolutely did not allow it too.

Just like this, both parties were caught in a stalemate here.

Bang!

Another Exalt was injured, then taken control of by a group of fiend emperors.

Ye Yuan’s expression fell slightly too. He did not expect that there would actually be so many fiend emperor powerhouses here. Could it be that he must bring out the Sacred Dragon Token and Vast Heaven Pagoda now?

These two items were his final trump cards. Not reaching the eleventh hour, they must absolutely not be exposed.

Ye Yuan thought about it and still decided to wait and see.

The fiend race was seriously too difficult to deal with. Although these fiend emperors were not as powerful as Fiendgod Jia Lan, they had only experienced 100 thousand years of suppression. Furthermore, their treatment was completely different from Jia Lan’s. Therefore, each and every one of their deterioration was not that severe.

In contrast, these fiend emperors were more difficult to deal with.

Speaking of which, if not for Jia Lan looking for trouble and wanting to seize possession of Ye Yuan back then, he would not have been severely wounded and sent away in defeat either.

The Soul Suppressing Pearl’s damage to Jia Lan was too great.

Ye Yuan observed the battle by the side, his expression became increasingly ugly too. One Exalt after another was taken control of by the fiend emperors, and became the other party’s fiend slaves instead.

Furthermore, after becoming fiend slaves, the Exalts’ strength actually soared by a large margin again.

Under such circumstances, it was completely impossible for the Exalts’ side to reverse the situation.

Ye Yuan quietly revolved the incantation and was currently planning on bringing out the Sacred Dragon Token. Right then, an unforeseen accident occurred again!

Boom!

A violent explosion sounded out and actually directly blasted the entire group of fiend emperors flying! Even the strongest Mu Ta had no strength to retaliate in the slightest under this blow.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. Focusing his eyes and looking over, he was surprised. He did not know why Netherkill’s disposition changed drastically all of a sudden

And this sort of transformation gave people a feeling of heart palpitation.

“You guys are really useless! You can’t even deal with a few fiend emperors! Since that’s the case, it’s useless to keep you guys too!” Netherkill slowly said.
