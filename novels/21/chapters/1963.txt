Chapter 1967: Entering the Ancient God Battlefield

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Eh?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets who was currently casting a spell suddenly detected a trace of abnormality.

His eyes seemed to be able to see through the void, directly landing on the Ye Yuan inside the passageway.

“This young man, interesting! Rather interesting!”

Saying interesting twice in a row, for Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, that was absolutely encountering something that made him interested.

By the side, a middle-aged man said in surprise, “Lord Father, what thing made you so interested?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said, “With the Ancient God Battlefield opening this time, I discovered a very interesting little fellow.”

“Oh? Wonder what peculiarity this little fellow has, to actually be able to attract Father’s attention?”

He knew that the Ancient God Battlefield had opened for no idea how many times already, His father had never revealed such an expression before. It showed that this little fellow was really very interesting.

He understood that after his father reached his present realm, he had already reached the state of mind like an ancient well without ripples long ago. Extremely few things could make his mood have a change.

But today, his father’s mood clearly had a ripple. This made him extremely shocked.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets smiled and said, “It’s a little fellow who came from Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital. Father actually can’t see through his actual situation.”

The pupils of the middle-aged man shrunk, and he said in surprise, “Father calculates all of heaven’s secrets and knows about the matters under the heavens like the back of your hand. There’s actually someone that Father can’t see through in this world?”

Profound Secrets shook his head and could not help laughing as he said, “Calculating all of heaven’s secrets? That’s only what you all think. Father merely lived a little longer and understood a little more about this world than others.”

Profound Secrets stood with his hands behind his back, turned around to look towards that distant horizon, and said emotionally, “Everyone says that I, Profound Secrets, am omniscient and all-powerful. But they don’t know that the moment my Jian Family touches calculating rods, Heavenly Dao is laughing! The higher one stands, the more it’s akin to treading on thin ice, and the more one feels that Heavenly Dao is unfathomable.”

The middle-aged man was at a loss after listening. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s words, he could not comprehend at all.

In his eyes, his father always had everything under control.

In this world, there was nothing that he, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, could not calculate.

Even those Dao Ancestors who were too lofty to reach were also courteous toward Father.

His father was absolutely this Heavenspan World’s outlier, an existence above worldly considerations.

The things that he said, he could not understand at all.

Why would Heavenly Dao laugh?

“What Father said ... Yunxin doesn’t understand.”

“Huhu, perhaps one day, you’ll know. Go and inquire for me about the background of this little fellow,” Profound Secrets said with a laugh.

“Yes, Father.” Jian Yunxin received the order and left.

...

Inside the passageway, Ye Yuan’s brows suddenly furrowed.

“Senior, I seem to feel that someone was spying on me just now,” Ye Yuan said to Dustless.

Dustless was rather surprised as he said, “Spying on you? I didn’t detect it!”

Ye Yuan was rather stunned; even Dustless actually did not feel it?

“Maybe it’s my misconception,” Ye Yuan said.

Dustless frowned as he thought about it and said, “Might not be! Talk about your feeling just now.”

Ye Yuan said, “It was like ... Heavenly Dao’s overlooking; it was intangible.”

Dustless said, “This Ancient God Battlefield’s passageway was opened up by Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets with a great divine ability. Sending you all into the Ancient God Battlefield is also Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’s work. Could it be that ... it was him spying on you?”

When Ye Yuan heard that, his brows could not help furrowing.

Being noticed by such a powerhouse was not what he desired.

Although he looked forward to meeting Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets very much, he also knew that this kind of person was too ephemeral. That person was not what the current him could come into contact with.

Being noticed by Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was not some good thing.

“Forget it. It’s a blessing if not a calamity; if it’s a calamity, it can’t be avoided.”

Just as Ye Yuan was hesitating, Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes. A desolate aura hit him face-on.

In front of him, it was a boundless land with yellow sand all over the place, unable to see the end with a glance.

Suddenly, the winds and clouds changed.

Above the horizon, two powerhouses surged with mighty divine essence, fighting fiercely in close quarters, fighting until heaven rend asunder and the earth cracked.

Suddenly, an attack dispersed and headed straight toward their side.

The faces of Song Yu and the rest changed drastically as they cried out in surprise, “Goodness, quickly run!”

As he said, he turned around and ran!

At this time, the young powerhouses in this area were probably no less than several hundred people.

When everyone saw this horrifying energy undulation, each and every one of them was scared until their faces were ashen, turning tail and running like Song Yu.

But how could they escape?

That energy undulation arrived in an instant. However, there was no exploding sound like everyone imagined.

It evaporated into thin air just like that.

Lifting their heads and looking over again, those two powerhouses also disappeared into thin air. Their traces were no longer there.

“What the hell? Turns out that it was a false alarm!”

“Damn it, scared me to death! What’s going on here?”

“Don’t tell that those two powerhouses just now were both illusions?”

... ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Those young powerhouses all cursed angrily to no end, clearly feeling like they were made fun of.

At this time, Liu Yi suddenly appeared beside Ye Yuan and marveled with admiration. He said, “Little Brother is indeed not an ordinary person. Facing such a heaven-shocking energy undulation and your countenance didn’t even change.”

That unexpected turn of events just now, only a small number of people stood in place and not moved.

Ye Yuan was one of them.

Ye Yuan gave the wretched-looking Liu Yi a glance and said with a faint smile, “Playing a pig to eat a tiger, looks like Brother Liu has mastered the skill to perfection!”

Liu Yi was surprised in his heart, but he had a wretched look on his face as he said, “What’s little brother talking about? This Liu doesn’t understand!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You and I know in our hearts, that will do.”

Liu Yi getting snubbed, went over to the side to hide awkwardly.

But for Ye Yuan, he became alert instead.

Although Song Yu’s strength was strong, Ye Yuan did not take it to heart.

He was merely a young master who had not experienced tempering before. In a place like the Ancient God Battlefield, he would not even know what was going on after being schemed to death by people

But from the very start, Ye Yuan was very vigilant toward this Liu Yi.

He instinctively felt that Liu Yi was not simple.

An itinerant cultivator like him could actually rise rapidly all the way up, reaching imperial aura at this kind of age. This absolutely could not be summed up with a simple word like ‘destiny.’

Actually, since entering the Ancient God Battlefield, Ye Yuan had been observing Liu Yi.

Sure enough, when everyone turned pale with fright and was running away just now, Liu Yi pretended to look surprised and ran together with everyone.

The scared expression on his face was very fake. But at this sort of time, there naturally would not be anyone who would pay attention to him.

Even so, he still made such an expression. The depths of his cunningness could be seen.

Ye Yuan believed in destiny but did not believe in destiny entirely.

Human effort was a decisive factor. Defying the heavens and changing fate, this sort of thing was not just a legend.

For Liu Yi to be able to walk until today step by step, he definitely did not rely on just luck.

Right at this time, a deep voice rang in everyone’s ears. The person said, “That isn’t an illusion!”

“Who? Who’s talking?”

Everyone turned pale with fright because they could not find anyone at all.

That voice sounded out once more. The person said, “Don’t need to look for me. This emperor is in a closed-seclusion in the depths of the Ancient God Battlefield. You can’t find me. This emperor is the Ancient God Battlefield’s guardian. You all entering the Ancient God Battlefield, this emperor has a few things to warn you about.”

“This emperor! It’s ... It’s a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!”

When everyone heard that, their faces changed color due to feeling terrified.
