Chapter 2573: Green Bull Town

“I don’t know why you must go to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, but if you go now, it’s no different from seeking death,” Luo Yunqing said coolly.

Although the Five Great Heavenly Regions had existed side by side for a long time, the friction between them had never stopped before.

Especially the Five Light Heavenly Region and the other four great heavenly regions, they were practically incompatible like fire and water.

Back then, Yan Jadetrue suddenly emerged, sweeping across True Yang Heavenly Domain. He led Jadetrue Heavenly Sect to become True Yang Heavenly Domain’s number one great sect.

Later, Yan Jadetrue teamed up with the other three great heavenly regions to besiege Five Light Heavenly Region.

That battle was fought until floating corpses spanned ten thousand miles!

However, in that era, an even more monstrous genius emerged in the Five Light Heavenly Region, called Zhuo Bufan.

He led the Five Light Heavenly Region and killed until heaven and earth dimmed, and the sun and moon were without light.

Zhuo Bufan even overpowered Yan Jadetrue and the rest of the four great powerhouses with his power alone, and he severely injured his opponents.

Since then, the Five Light Heavenly Region finally stabilized under the pincer attacks of the four great heavenly regions.

Of course, after this matter, the Five Great Heavenly Regions suffered a great loss in vitality and entered the stage of recuperation and rest.

After Ye Yuan heard, he finally had some understanding of the history of the Rainclear Continent.

Presumably, the Heavenspan Mountain was seriously damaged after that battle, that was why Yan Jadetrue would nourish the Heavenspan Mountain with the Heavenspan World as fodder.

It was just that what happened later, one had no knowledge of it.

But no matter what, the Heavenspan World finally escaped this calamity!

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Alright, this matter, consider it that I owe Senior Luo a favor. When I have a chance in the future, I’ll definitely repay it!”

Luo Yunqing appearing at this time was equivalent to saving Ye Yuan’s life.

This favor, Ye Yuan naturally had to repay it.

After that battle, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect fell into decline, they naturally hated ascenders to the bones.

Luo Yunqing smiled and said, “Getting Brother Ye’s promise, this Luo feels overwhelmed by an unexpected favor! My Five Light Heavenly Region is severely lacking in heavenly alchemists. With Brother Ye’s ability, you’ll definitely be a big shot in the future!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior Luo is too kind! Wonder what’s the situation in this Five Light Heavenly Region?”

Mentioning this, a hint of melancholy flashed across the corners of Luo Yunqing’s eyebrows, and he said, “Actually, my Five Light Heavenly Region’s situation isn’t optimistic at present either! The Five Light Heavenly Region belongs to five great heavenly sects. Originally, under Lord Zhuo’s lead, the five great heavenly sects pooled their efforts and were of one mind, their strength astonishing! But after that battle, Lord Zhuo also disappeared, and the five great heavenly sects were without any leader. None could convince the others, each governing themselves. This Luo belongs to the western sect, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, in charge of the True Yang Heavenly Domain!”

Ye Yuan said, “In that case, after I enter Five Light Heavenly Region, I’ll be entering Martial Secure Heavenly Sect too?”

Luo Yunqing smiled lightly and said, “After ordinary ascenders are led over, they don’t have the qualifications to join a heavenly sect. They must go through the heavenly sect’s test before they can become an outer-sect disciple. Even more so, most people can only enter subordinate countries. Of course, with Brother Ye’s means, these cumbersome procedures are naturally not necessary.”

As he said, Luo Yunqing handed Ye Yuan a green-colored token and said, “My Martial Secure Heavenly Sect has blue, red, green, and purple, corresponding to four levels of protectors, with purple protectors having the highest status! This green-wing token represents the identity of a green-wing protector. When you hold this token, your status in Martial Secure Heavenly Sect will be second only to this Luo!”

Ye Yuan took the token rather surprisedly, not expecting Luo Yunqing to actually give him such a high status all of a sudden.

No need to think that he also knew that green-wing protectors definitely needed the strength of Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum before it could be granted.

But, he gave it to him, this Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “Many thanks, Senior Luo!”

Luo Yunqing smiled lightly and said, “This Luo has laid low for ten years and knows much about Brother Ye. I know that this green-wing token might be low. But your current cultivation realm is low. It’s hard to convince the masses if given too high a status too. This Luo is really looking forward to Brother Ye amazing the world with a single brilliant feat in Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! Alright, it’s getting late. Let’s hurry to the borders first. There will be someone there to send you guys into Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and followed Luo Yunqing and left.

Before departure, the two quietly sneaked into Eastward Country and fetched Lin Lan away.

… …

Green Bull Town, a small town on the borders of True Yang Heavenly Domain and Five Light Heavenly Region.

Ye Yuan three people trekked ten thousand miles and finally arrived here after half a year.

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect had set up many guide points at the borders. Green Bull Town was one of them.

Upon entering Green Bull Town, Luo Yunqing’s expression suddenly turned dark.

Green Bull Town was already a wasteland.

Inside the town, there were dead bodies everywhere with heavy casualties.

“L-Lord Luo! You … You finally came back!” At this time, a middle-aged man came up to greet them, having a look of excitement when he saw Luo Yunqing.

The middle-aged man was covered with wounds all over, looking very miserable.

Luo Yunqing frowned and said, “Yao Qing, what’s going on?”

Yao Qing complained tearfully, “I don’t know what’s going on either. Many of our guide points were exposed. Leng Dongyu brought a large number of experts and ransacked many of our guide points. We suffered heavy casualties! Just yesterday, a group of experts from Jadetrue Heavenly Sect suddenly attacked Green Bull Town. Lord Ding Shao died in battle. Of the several hundred ascenders in the town, the casualties are more than 70%! We … We can’t swallow this insult!”

Luo Yunqing’s gaze gradually turned cold.

Ye Yuan felt killing intent from his body!

“Leng Dongyu,?huhu,?very good!”

Luo Yunqing’s smile gave everyone a bone-piercing chill.

He said to Yao Qing, “You gather the remnants of the defeated troops and withdraw to the heavenly sect first! Let me handle the matters here!”

Yao Qing answered, “Yes!”

Luo Yunqing turned to Ye Yuan again and said, “Brother Ye, I was originally planning on sending you back to the sect personally. Looking at it now, it seems like it’s impossible! Along the way, Yao Qing will escort you all back to the sect.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Senior Luo just go ahead. This Ye isn’t so hypocritical. I have some little gimmicks here; they don’t have much effect on Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratums, but they might have some effect at critical moments! Senior Luo’s trip will be dangerous, why don’t you bring it along.”

Luo Yunqing was noncommittal toward this, but he could not brush Ye Yuan’s face aside. He took them and said, “Then it will be disrespectful for this Luo to decline! After this Luo returns to the sect, I’ll have a drink with you! I’m going!”

His voice had yet to fade when his entire person already turned into a wisp of green smoke, disappearing.

Hearing the two people’s conversation, Yao Qing was incredibly shocked in his heart.

Lord Luo actually addressed a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum as his brother!

Just what origin was this boy?

Yao Qing did not dare to be neglectful and said to Ye Yuan, “This little brother, this Yao will bring you to the resting area first. We’ll set off tomorrow morning.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I’ll have to trouble Brother Yao! Lin Lan, you follow Brother Yao and see if you can help with anything.”

Lin Lan bowed and said, “Yes, Master!”

Yao Qing was taken aback. Looking at Lin Lan strangely, he said in surprise, “You aren’t an ascender!”

Lin Lan said, “This Lin is a grade two heavenly alchemist. Maybe I can be of some help.”

The moment Yao Qing heard, he was even more surprised. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

An exalted grade two heavenly alchemist actually acknowledged an ascender as his master?

His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of doubts.

Just what kind of person was this guy?
