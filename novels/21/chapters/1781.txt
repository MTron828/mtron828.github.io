Chapter 1785 Beg Me!

A ray of cold light flashed past, the swift and fierce sword energy directly dismembered a late-stage rank four fierce beast.

Ye Yuan hugged both arms and was taking it easy with nothing to do by the side.

“Go take the heavenly demon crystal!” Baili Qingyan’s face was cold as frost as she ordered Ye Yuan.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s appearance, she would get angry.

Ye Yuan found it funny in his heart. This lass was still angry with him.

Ever since entering the Shadowmoon Mountain Range, Baili Qingyan had never shown Ye Yuan a good attitude.

But he did not refuse, walking over and retrieving the heavenly demon crystal neat and tidily.

After the demon core within divine rank demonic beasts evolved into heavenly demon crystal, inside the heavenly demon crystal contained the lifetime essence of the fierce beast.

Along the way, they already killed three late-stage rank four fierce beasts.

Seemingly intent on exhibiting her powerful strength, Baili Qingyan practically killed with one sword when she encountered fierce beasts.

She wanted to see shock from Ye Yuan’s eyes, but she was disappointed.

Ye Yuan’s performance was incomparably calm.

But this kind of composure became sitting idly and reaping the fruits of others’ labor in her eyes, sharing her achievements with no qualms of conscience.

This made Baili Qingyan very unhappy!

Look at you showing off. Do you really think that I can’t take care of you? Baili Qingyan sneered in her heart.

The next day, the two people ran into a late-stage rank four fierce beast very luckily once again.

Ye Yuan hugged both arms calmly, waiting to watch the show.

Baili Qingyan suddenly said, “I’m tired. I’ll leave it to you.”

This was merely a newly ascended late-stage rank four fierce beast, equivalent to a Seventh Firmament Divine Lord martial artist.

For Baili Qingyan to want to kill it, it was naturally very easy.

But now, she deliberately wanted to teach Ye Yuan a lesson.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you’re tired, rest for a while, I’ll be right back.”

Baili Qingyan was very disdainful in her heart and said with a cold smile, “Pretend! I’ll see when you can pretend until! Although this Zilong Cloudeye Beast has just entered late-stage rank four, Eighth Firmament Divine Lords also have to expend some effort to deal with it. In a while, I’ll watch you beg me to take action sobbingly!”

Swoosh!

Sword rose, sword fell!

That Zilong Cloudeye Beast was virtually cut down under Ye Yuan’s sword without the least bit of strength to resist.

When Baili Qingyan saw this scene, her gaze involuntarily turned sharp, revealing a look of surprise.

“How can this guy be so strong?”

If it were Baili Qingyan herself, she could naturally do it to this extent.

But Ye Yuan was just a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord!

This guy actually had the strength to jump realms and battle.

Ye Yuan retrieved the heavenly demon crystal, came in front of Baili Qingyan, and said with a faint smile, “Miss Baili, are you rested enough?”

Baili Qingyan’s expression was somewhat ugly and she said in a cold voice, “Have you seen before someone rest so fast? No!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Like this huh, then let’s rest for a while more.”

As he said, Ye Yuan sat down not far from Baili Qingyan and sized her up with interest.

Baili Qingyan’s brows furrowed slightly and she said with displeasure, “Looking at what?! Keep looking and I’ll dig your eyeballs out!”

Actually, Baili Qingyan normally did not have such a cold personality.

On the contrary, she was different from those iceberg beauties, her temperament was rather warm.

It was just that in her warmth, it exuded pride and keeping people a thousand miles away, making people unable to look directly at her.

But now, when she faced Ye Yuan, she was unable to be calm at all, and also could not display that kind of pride at all.

Toward Baili Qingyan’s threat, Ye Yuan did not take it to heart at all, but smiled and said, “Miss Baili, can I ask? So many examinees but why did you pick me?”

Baili Qingyan gave a cold snort and said, “I felt that you had quite the backbone, that’s why I picked you. I didn’t expect that you’re a despicable villain who takes advantage of others’ perilous state!”

Ye Yuan immediately understood when he heard that. Looks like when Song Ting threatened him, Baili Qingyan just happened to see it, that was why it would attract her attention.

“Taking advantage of others’ perilous state, is it? Miss Baili finding me, isn’t it in order to make use of me to shake off those people’s harassment? Your action mounted me onto the fire to barbecue and provoked that kind of powerful adversary at the same time. Do you think that it’s me who took advantage of someone’s perilous state, or was it you who harbored ulterior motives? Or is it that you feel that with your charms, I wouldn’t refuse you at all?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Baili Qingyan’s expression changed, she did not expect that Ye Yuan saw it so thoroughly.

Yes, if it were others, even if they clearly knew that they were being exploited, they would also agree to it willingly.

But Ye Yuan would not, that was why there was that scene of rejection.

“With me around, they naturally don’t dare to do anything to you.” Baili Qingyan defended herself through sophistry.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This kind of words, Miss Baili can use them to bluff a three-year-old kid. Your three major sects are powerful, for the two of them to want to kill me, they don’t need to personally make a move at all. Moreover, with Miss Baili’s horizons, would you care about the life and death of an insignificant character like me?”

Baili Qingyan looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly. She suddenly discovered that this fellow seemed to be quite different from the rest.

Although Ye Yuan’s age was not old, he was calm when encountering matters; totally different from the average young person.

Indeed, she might give a heads-up afterward because of today’s matter, but would not really be concerned with Ye Yuan’s life and death at all. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Duan Qinghong they all getting Ye Yuan killed afterward was also something within expectations.

“Heh heh, looks like this kid still has quite the self-awareness!”

The two people were just talking when suddenly, a cold laugh sounded out. A figure dashed out of the woods.

“Zhong Hanlin!” Baili Qingyan’s dark brows furrowed slightly as she said.

This guy appearing, he clearly did not have any good intentions.

Zhong Hanlin used a pair of greedy eyes to look at Baili Qingyang and said with a smile, “Junior Sister Qingyan, wait until I kill this toad, then I’ll come and catch up with you.”

Done talking, he turned to Ye Yuan and said, “Punk, you should never have ever formed a team with Junior Sister Qingyan. That instant when you agreed, you should have known your outcome, right?”

When Ye Yuan heard, he was speechless for a while and said, “I rejected her, it was her who insisted on teaming up with me.”

Zhong Hanlin smiled coldly and said, “That’s also one of the reasons you deserve to die! Junior Sister Baili’s invitation, you should feel overwhelmed by flattery and honor. But you actually made her unable to step down the stage in front of so many people. You deserve to die ten thousand times over!”

When Ye Yuan heard, he was amused for a while and said, “Your meaning is that no matter what, I have to die?”

Zhong Hanlin smiled slightly as he nodded and said, “Yes! That moment when Junior Sister Baili came to find you, you’re destined to die! Want to blame, blame your fate for not being good.”

Zhong Hanlin had a high and mighty appearance, pronouncing Ye Yuan’s death sentence.

Ye Yuan sneered coldly in his heart to no end. In the eyes of this kind of so-called geniuses, life was worthless.

As long as they were willing, they could determine other people’s life and death as they pleased.

Putting it bluntly, he was looking at Ye Yuan’s strength being meager and that he was easy to bully.

If Duan Qinghong was here, he absolutely would not dare to say so.

Ye Yuan’s gaze looked at Baili Qingyan and he said coolly, “You’re planning on looking on with folded arms?”

Baili Qingyan’s expression alternated between green and red. But at the thought of Ye Yuan’s hateful expression, she felt annoyed in her heart.

“Beg me! As long as you open your mouth, I’ll take action!” Baili Qingyan suddenly said.
