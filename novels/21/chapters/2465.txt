Chapter 2471: Disdain to Take!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You’re really mad as a March hare, to actually make a move against so many innocent people!” Ye Yuan looked at the Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy who was dispirited and inert and said with a cold smile.

Most of these alchemy path powerhouses had nothing to do with Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy.

This guy actually dealt killing blows to these people, his crimes were really too numerous to be recorded.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s gaze turned bleak and he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “On what basis do I have to be a dog for life? I refuse to give in! I’m … unwilling! Everyone treated me like a dog next to him! I, this eldest senior apprentice brother, am even less than a third-generation disciple!?Hahaha?… those so-called geniuses all deserve death! They are only fit to be the stepping stones on my road of ascent!”

With death knocking on the door, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy finally spoke up about the unwillingness suppressed in his heart.

At this time, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy already calmed down.

He was a clever man and knew that Ye Yuan would never let him off.

Hence, he did not do some meaningless pleading too.

.

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy and did not have the slightest pity.

Pitiable people definitely had detestable aspects.

Men should improve themselves. Lastingjoy’s ambition was not small. It was just that the method he used was wrong.

Of course, more importantly, he found the wrong person.

He never should have come to provoke him.

“Any other last words?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy laughed loudly and said, “Ye Yuan, you saw all those Alchemy Daos that I devoured, right??Hahaha,?as long as you draw reference from their Great Dao, with your talent, stepping into the realm of Dao pill will be easily accomplished! This emperor doesn’t have any last words. You’ll carry this emperor’s ambition and … live on!?Hahaha?…”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said, “That’s right. A myriad Great Daos is indeed heart-tingling. It’s just that you’re also looking down on this Ye too much! Do you feel that I really need these to break through to the realm of Dao pill?”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan reached his hand out and pulled. A black whirlwind immediately started spinning around Ye Yuan, giving off a series of whimpering sounds.

Ye Yuan’s body emitted a faint fluorescent light.

It was only to see him extend his hand and console the black whirlwind lightly. The berserk black whirlwind gradually became quiet.

The current Ye Yuan was like a divine buddha, expiating the world!

The black whirlwind was precisely formed by the resentful spirits devoured by Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy.

Although their divine souls were devoured, a trace of resentment after death still remained. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Unwilling, refusal to give in!

The buddha aura on Ye Yuan was like a life-giving spring breeze and rain, warmly nourishing these resentful spirits.

“Relax, I won’t use you all to cultivate. If that’s the case, what difference is there between me and him? Alright, all disperse then,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Those resentful spirits all revealed their figures and gave a bow toward Ye Yuan, incredibly grateful.

In the end, they turned and took a look at the dumbfounded Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy, a trace of release being revealed in their gazes.

Following that, they turned into motes of fluorescence, dissipating into the world.

“Many thanks, Your Excellency, for letting us enter reincarnation!”

“Thank you, Your Excellency. This lowly one is endlessly grateful!”

“Your Excellency’s grace, this lowly one will engrave it in my heart!”

… …

One figure after another emerged, bowing to Ye Yuan non-stop.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s black wheel was very terrifying. After being devoured by him, the remnant souls were imprisoned inside forever, unable to escape.

Ye Yuan freed them and expiated them, making them able to enter samsara.

This kindness, they had to receive it.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy opened his mouth wide, a look of disbelief on his face.

He could not imagine that there was actually someone capable of resisting such a temptation!

With Ye Yuan’s talent, after comprehending these Great Daos, breaking through to the realm of Dao pill would be a breeze to him.

But he actually gave it up just like that!

“You … You …” Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy wanted to say something but discovered that he could not say anything.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “There’s no denying, I was indeed rather moved just now. It’s just that using them to cultivate, I, Ye Yuan, am disdainful to do so! You want to use them to ruin my Dao heart. That is truly a little too naive! Moreover … with my talent, do you think that I need to borrow their strength to step into the realm of Dao pill?”

When he said these, Ye Yuan exuded powerful self-confidence.

What Ye Yuan was most proud of had never been Martial Dao, and also not the chaos origin divinity, but Alchemy Dao!

What supported him to walk step by step until today, was not his martial path talent, but alchemy path talent!

Back then, he entered Great Dao with Alchemy Dao. That was how he created the Chaos Heavenspan Canon.

His road to ascension could not do without the support of Alchemy Dao at every step!

Therefore, he had this confidence.

Moreover, his current alchemy path realm was only a step away from Dao pill too.

Stepping into the realm of Dao pill was just a matter of time.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s complexion was deathly pale. Suddenly, he felt that his conviction had collapsed completely.

These myriad Great Daos were the essence of his life, where his Great Dao lied.

He believed that if anyone in the Heavenspan World saw it, they would not be able to resist such temptation.

But Ye Yuan cast them aside like a pair of worn-out shoes.

This was the powerful confidence of a true genius!

Suddenly, his entire body trembled. A figure appeared.

Medicine Ancestor!

When Ye Yuan saw Medicine Ancestor, his gaze could not help turning intent too.

This man who had once stood at the top of the alchemy path, actually ended up in such a plight; lamentable and pitiable.

Medicine Ancestor looked at Ye Yuan, his expression complicated.

Finally, he opened his mouth and said, “Ye Yuan, thank you!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said coolly, “No need. Our grudge is written off once and for all.”

Medicine Ancestor nodded his head, but turned to look at Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy, and said with a slight sigh, “Silly boy! You were too anxious! After this old man broke through to the realm of Dao pill, I’ll naturally do all I can for you and help you step into the realm of Dao pill!?Sigh!”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy sneered when he heard that and said, “Stop being pretentious here! I’m merely a dog in your eyes, that’s all! For so many years, you’ve never looked me in the eye before at all! Now, you want to use these sorts of words to make me feel guilty? Heh heh, do you really take me to be a fool?”

Medicine Ancestor did not care and said coolly, “Do you think that you could really hide from my eyes when you were doing these things under my eyelids? Also, when you made a move against me in the end, do you think that I really didn’t have the strength to fight back? Also, if I didn’t value you, why did I only take you away during the Cloudheart Realm battle?”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s expression became a little unnatural, and he said with a cold smile, “In your eyes, it’s naturally an old dog that’s most handy to order about! Stop talking nonsense! No matter how glib your tongue in, I won’t believe it too!”

Medicine Ancestor said, “Silly child, you’re this old man’s son! Even a tiger wouldn’t eat its own children, why would this old man harm you?”

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy laughed loudly when he heard that and said,?“Hahaha?… old thing, are you teasing me?”

Medicine Ancestor said, “When you were young, you had a maple leaf-shaped birthmark on your abdomen area. You’ll often feel our abdomen heat up and your cultivation speed also far surpasses ordinary people. Later, you and your mother encountered danger, this maple leaf-shaped birthmark let you kill your opponent. But since then, the maple leaf-shaped birthmark disappeared …”

With each sentence that Medicine Ancestor said, Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s expression would change a little, bit by bit.

No one knew about these secrets!
