Chapter 2917: You’re My Lucky Star!

“Ancestor Ye was indeed sent by Patriarch to save us!”

“Too satisfying! The Soaring Cloud Sect has this day too!”

“Ancestor Ye is really impressive! Alchemy Dao, Martial Dao, Soul Dao, all of them are astonishing! No wonder he could be taken in as a disciple by Patriarch!”

… …

The Sublime Pill Sect’s disciples were agitated until they were almost crying.

Originally, they thought that the sect was going to decline henceforth.

But who knew that Ancestor Ye overcame the raging tides, saving the sect, and even conveniently trampled the Soaring Cloud Sect into the mud while he was at it!

Zhang Zuoshan left in disgrace. When he left, he was wailing bitterly.

Soaring Cloud Sect’s decline was virtually a certainty.

But Wang Jun and the rest of the Emperor Realm powerhouses were not so optimistic.

Ye Yuan had offended the soul envoy to the core!

The soul envoy represented the Nirvana Soul Hall. Ye Yuan beat Yan Jadetrue to this extent and even snatched his lucky chance. This was equivalent to slapping the Nirvana Soul Hall’s face.

Could this Nirvana Soul Hall be willing to drop the matter?

Nirvana Soul Hall was the organization used by the soul race to rule Day Cloud Continent. The powerhouses were plentiful as the clouds.

The place where the Sublime Pill Sect was located was Ning Lan Territory.

Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall was Ning Lan Territory’s supreme governing body.

All who offended the Nirvana Soul Hall did not have a good end.

“Ancestor Ye, hurry up and leave the Sublime Pill Sect! The soul envoy’s master, Emperor Sevenfeather, is the Nirvana Soul Hall’s elder, an Emperor Vast Heaven Realm Soul Emperor! He values this disciple a lot. If he finds out … he’ll definitely come and kill you!”

Wang Jun clearly knew quite a bit of inside information and immediately urged Ye Yuan to leave.

Yan Jadetrue was pleased with himself in his heart, but he did not dare to reveal it.

He knew about Ye Yuan’s means and could only secretly take delight in it.

So what if you, Ye Yuan, are formidable? I’m the soul race’s envoy now, just you wait for death.

“Are you thinking about, after your master comes, then kills me, and he’ll bring you away?” Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out, interrupting Yan Jadetrue’s beautiful dream.

Yan Jadetrue’s expression changed, and he said with an awkward smile, “H-How can that be!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Actually, these few years, I’ve always been waiting for the Nirvana Soul Hall’s people to come. Except, I didn’t expect that the one who came would actually be you.”

Yan Jadetrue’s expression changed again!

He was an extremely clever person. The moment Ye Yuan opened his mouth, he immediately connected it to many things!

No wonder he suddenly appeared in Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven. It turned out that his goal was actually the soul race!

Suddenly, he thought of something and cried out in surprise, “You … You want to borrow the power of the soul race to revive your beloved?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Talking with smart people saves effort. Therefore, you should know what I’m planning, right?”

Yan Jadetrue said, “This is impossible! You’re a human. How can you possibly enter the soul race?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly. Suddenly, his origin divinity split into two, one becoming a dragon soul, the other turning into the chaos origin divinity.

Following that, Ye Yuan gave a muffled groan, a trace of blood seeping out of his mouth.

The dragon soul tunneled into Ye Yuan’s body with a whoosh.

Now, it became two Ye Yuans.

One was a chaos origin divinity, and the other was Ye Yuan’s main body.

Yan Jadetrue’s pupils constricted, crying out in surprise once again as he said, “You … You are a mad man, to actually sever your twin origin divinities! But it’s useless! Concerning the soul race and the origin divinity, there is a fundamental difference! Even if you cut off your origin divinity, you can’t become a soul denizen too! I spent 150 years before completely transforming into the soul race! Do you feel that Master will wait 150 years for you?”

When he said this, Yan Jadetrue was full of mockery.

Origin divinity transforming into a soul denizen was a process.

This process was the process of completely cutting off the origin divinity from the physical body and purifying oneself.

Even if Ye Yuan forced him to teach him this purification technique, Soul Emperor Sevenfeather would not give him this time either.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “150 years? That’s too long … Yan Jadetrue, in my impression of you, you’re a genius. You actually used 150 years before transforming into a soul denizen?”

Yan Jadetrue smiled coldly and said, “Which origin divinity doesn’t have too many fetters while they were alive? Wanting to cut off the past and turning into the soul race, how can it be so easy? A period of 150 years is sufficient to rank into the top three in the Nirvana Soul Hall too! Ye Yuan, stop pretending in front of this seat. This seat will impart you the purification technique. I want to see how long you take!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “No need! I have a purification technique myself!”

While talking, Ye Yuan’s body emitted motes of light as if purifying himself.

Yan Jadetrue stared at Ye Yuan, his eyes going wide.

T-Too fast!

One breath, two breaths … a hundred breaths, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body already became exactly like him!

Ye Yuan … already transformed into a soul denizen!

“This … How is this possible?” Yan Jadetrue muttered.

Yan Jadetrue had never heard of this kind of transformation speed before.

Of course, with his level, he had no way of understanding what kind of existence Divine Emergence was at all!

One of the soul race’s three great sacred canons was not joking around. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It was not just Yan Jadetrue; Wang Jun and the rest were stunned too.

How could Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven’s humans not know the difficulty of transforming?

In reality, Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven’s origin divinities were beyond count. But those that were truly able to become a soul denizen were just in the minority after all.

But he had never heard before that someone could actually transform completely into the soul race in a hundred breaths.

Furthermore, when Ye Yuan cut off his fetters with his original body, he was clearly still heavily injured.

But in a blink, he became completely fine!

Everything before their eyes already subverted their understanding.

“Therefore, can we set off now? Senior Apprentice Brother Yan!”

Ye Yuan fired out a spell. Yan Jadetrue felt as if something had entered his soul body, and his expression could not help changing.

His meaning was very clear. He wanted to have Yan Jadetrue bring him into the Nirvana Soul Hall.

From now on, they might become apprentice brothers.

Tsk tsk,?truly, fate makes a mockery of men!

Yan Jadetrue’s eyes shrunk slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “I can bring you over! But, you have to swear a deadly oath to release me after the matter is done!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “No problem. I have a feeling that you’re my lucky star! With you around, my luck seems to be good every time! So, there’s no need to kill you.”

“Pffft!”

Yan Jadetrue nearly spurted out a mouthful of old blood.

Of course, he was a soul body and did not have blood.

In reality, if not for Yan Jadetrue, there really would not be today’s Ye Yuan.

Afterward, if not for Yan Jadetrue’s guide, it would have been impossible for Ye Yuan to find the Labyrinth Divine Palace too.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace’s treasures established a solid foundation for Ye Yuan’s rise later on.

This time, he delivered the Soul Recall Ring.

Tsk tsk, such a nice guy!

… …

About to part, there was thick concern all over the faces of Wang Jun and the others.

Severing fetters, infiltrating the soul race.

This sort of thing was too crazy!

The soul race has powerhouses plentiful as clouds. It was hard to predict the fortunes of this departure. Wang Jun could not help but worry.

“Alright, stop looking like your parents died! From now on, with Senior Apprentice Brother Yan and me in the Nirvana Soul Hall, you all can cultivate with peace of mind. Isn’t that so, Senior Apprentice Brother Yan?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

“Humph!”?Yan Jadetrue snorted coldly.

“Wang Jun, my main body will be staying in the Sublime Pill Sect. Help me look after it,” Ye Yuan said.

“Ancestor, rest assured. Even if Wang Jun dies, I’ll also ensure your safety!” Wang Jun patted his chest and said.
