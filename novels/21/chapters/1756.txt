1760 Try Saying It Again

“Elder Stonefeather, this ...”

Kong Yun was long already not as calm as before anymore.

Stonefeather, a Five-star High Priest actually lost composure like so. This was too abnormal.

Stonefeather waved his hand dismissively and said, “Don’t talk to me; let me calm down for a while!”

He held those ten storage rings repeatedly, looked at one, and put another one down, examining each one carefully continuously.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of them clicked their tongues in wonder.

However, their gazes when looking at Ye Yuan became different.

No idea how long had passed either, Stonefeather finally recovered from his shock.

He heaved a long sigh of relief, calmed his emotions down, and said to Ye Yuan, “I heard that you never received 3-star and above missions at all in this half a year, how are you able to complete 7-star missions all of a sudden?”

Same as everyone, Stonefeather was also very perplexed.

He knew that with Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao foundation and talent, he should pick up demon divine pill techniques very quickly.

But he completely did not expect that it would be fast to such an inconceivable extent.

When he checked these ten missions just now, they were all level seven difficulty demon divine pills! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, they were very high difficulty level seven difficulty medicinal pills!

Demon divine pills of this difficulty, even the elders did not have confidence in completing within one or two times.

Not only did Ye Yuan complete them, but he also completed them very perfectly.

Each kind of medicinal pill reached divine-grade!

Refining level seven demon divine pills to divine-grade, this was simply a fairytale-like thing.

Even they, these Five-star high priests, did not possibly have anyone able to do it too.

This was the reason why he was so shocked.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Understanding one aspect, understanding all aspects! Refining high difficulty medicinal pills might not need going up one level by one level when refining. As long as one lays down a solid foundation, they can naturally achieve mastery through a comprehensive study of the subject.”

Stonefeather’s gaze turned intent and he praised, “A fine ‘understanding one aspect, understanding all aspects’. It’s just that how many can do it to this extent? Ye Yuan, you indeed didn’t disappoint me!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks, Elder Stonefeather!”

Stonefeather nodded his head and said to the priest trainee, “Ye Yuan’s ten missions, give him 30 thousand contribution points for each one!”

“3-30 thousand? Elder Stonefeather, is ... is there a mistake?” Kong Yun said with a look of disbelief when he heard this.

What did 30 thousand points per mission mean?

He, Kong Yun, did not even have that many contribution points by taking on several dozen 5-star missions!

One should not look at how Chi Feng gave away several hundred contribution points to Ye Yuan in the psat. Actually, this was already not a small sum.

Accepting a 4-star mission, after completing it, one would only get several dozen to 100 contribution points.

For Chi Feng to want to earn several hundred contribution points, he needed to do quite a few 4-star missions.

As for 2000 contribution points, Chi Feng had to strive for at least quite a few years!

Now, Ye Yuan’s one mission was worth 30 thousand contribution points, this was too fake!

Kong Yun’s first reaction was that Elder Stonefeather did it on purpose, wanting to use Ye Yuan’s achievement as a contrast.

“There’s naturally no mistake! Ye Yuan’s 10 missions, each one was completed perfectly. Awarding someone according to a 7-star mission’s peak value, it’s 30 thousand for one,” Stonefeather said coolly.

Kong Yun’s expression changed drastically and he said in terror, “P-Peak value? How is this possible?”

Peak value, only under the circumstances of completing divine-grade, would the reward be given.

Could it be that Ye Yuan’s ten missions all reached divine-grade?

Missions that even elders could not complete, how was this possible?

Stonefeather’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Kong Yun, could it be that you’re questioning this elder?”

Kong Yun’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “D-Dare not! I just ... just ...”

Stonefeather gave a cold snort and said, “Rather than being jealous of men of talent, why not spend more time on cultivation! I hpe that today’s events will sound a wake-up call for you all!”

Finished talking, Stonefeather turned around and left.

Ye Yuan looked at Kong Yun and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Now, try saying the words you said yesterday loudly again?”

When Kong Yun heard that, his entire face became incomparably embarrassed.

He was still pledging in all seriousness yesterday, saying that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to complete the missions.

The reason why he dared to be so arrogant was that he was certain there was no way Ye Yuan could finish any of the ten missions.

But today, not only did Ye Yuan complete it, furthermore, he completed it in a terrifyingly brilliant manner, too perfectly.

Seeing Kong Yun’s appearance, Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and said disdainfully, “A coward who has the balls to say, but doesn’t have the balls to act! If you don’t have strength, don’t posture in front of others; you’ll get slapped! If you can complete 7-star missions, come in front of me to raise a hue at that time.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan swaggered off.

...

Coming out of Tianlu Pavilion, Ye Yuan was stopped by the white-haired old man again.

With the first time, there was naturally the second time, the third time.

Ever since that time, each time Ye Yuan came out of Tianlu Pavilion, he would be stopped by the white-haired old man who sat down and debated on the Dao with him.

Because he discovered that Ye Yuan’s insights were extremely unique and could often set people thinking.

Some areas of doubts and omissions he had in the past also had a feeling of becoming enlightened at once.

Before encountering Ye Yuan, the white-haired old man thought that he had already thoroughly understood the Tianlu Pavilion’s classics.

All the way until that time he tested Ye Yuan, he discovered that he actually still had many questions that he did not understand thoroughly.

Of course, Ye Yuan was also willing to approach it with this white-haired old man.

This old man’s attainments in demon divine pills were absolutely extraordinary.

To Ye Yuan, a novice, the white-haired old man’s guidance tend to give him a feeling of dispelling the clouds and seeing the moonlight.

This kind of exchange was naturally greatly beneficial to the two.

Ye Yuan’s improvement being so fast was not unrelated to this white-haired old man.

After a bout of intense discussions, the white-haired old man suddenly said, “I heard that this half a year, you questioned the various elders during their sermons, making them unable to step down?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That will depend on how you view the matter. Actually, I feel that raising questions when you have them, all can discuss together and improve together. This is a good thing. It’s just that to some elders who have already been famous for a long time, face is clearly more important than strength.”

The white-haired old man burst into laughter when he heard it and said, “Well said! Those fools think that they are number one under the heavens, but they don’t know that there’s heaven beyond heaven, and that there’s always someone better! Their Alchemy Dao is merely but some superficial knowledge!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Junior always felt that talent can have differences, but attitude can completely have no differences. Hiding your problems and not taking remedial measures, one can only come to a standstill. The disciple doesn’t need to be inferior to the master, the master doesn’t need to be inferior to the disciple. Some of the student’s insights can perhaps let the teacher have another bout of gains. It’s just that they insist that I’m causing trouble,so I also can’t do anything about it.”

The white-haired old man chortled with laughter and said, “You, brat, are really different from the rest! But I heard that they have already joined hands, planning to teach you a good lesson. You have to be a little more careful.”

Ye Yuan was rather surprised as he said, “Teach me a lesson? How so?”

The white-haired old man lightly stroked his beard and said with a smile, “Have you heard of the eternal chess game ‘Ask Not’?”

Ye Yuan shook his head, clearly not having the slightest clue about this.
