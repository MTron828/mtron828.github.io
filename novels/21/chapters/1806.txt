Chapter 1810 Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum

“Not good, Ye Yuan’s weapon is at too much of a disadvantage!”“Celestial Deity martial technique versus Divine Lord martial technique, furthermore, the two people’s martial techniques are both too strong, Ye Yuan’s weapon can’t withstand it anymore!”

Junyi Sword’s collapse made everyone worry about Ye Yuan.

Especially Baili Qingyan, her pretty face was already ashen pale.

“Hahaha, see if you still don’t die!”

When Qian Ye saw this scene, his face revealed a look of wild elation. Raising his long spear, his strength increased a bit more.

For some time, the long spear’s momentum was akin to a startled flock of ducks, thoroughly overwhelming Ye Yuan.

That violent spear momentum already arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan withstood the tremendous pressure, his expression very ugly. But he gave a cold snort and said, “You’re happy too early!”

As he said, a sword intent that was faintly discernible spread out from Ye Yuan’s body.

In virtually an instant, those shattered Junyi Sword fragments seemed to have been activated.

In midair, the pieces of fragments seemed to be stars that filled the sky; incomparably dazzling.

“Sword intent akin to silk!”

Jiang Hong and the woodcutter both blurted out, extremely surprised.

Clearly, this scene exceeded their expectations.

“Kill!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, those countless stars turned into flowing streams of light, rushing over toward Qian Ye.

Qian Ye’s expression suddenly changed. His world power could not stop the assault of those fragments at all.

For a moment, Qian Ye felt as if there were tens of millions of swords rushing over towards him from all directions.

Although his long spear was sharp, its momentum was already formed and could not be withdrawn at all anymore!

Qian Ye clenched his teeth and shouted fiercely, “Want to kill me, you have to die too! Arghh ...”

This sudden change exceeded everyone’s expectations. It naturally also included Qian Ye.

He was aware that he could not withstand it and planned to perish together with Ye Yuan.

Bang!

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Qian Ye’s long spear shook, shocking away countless fragments. But there were still many fragments and punctured right into his body, turning his entire person into a sieve.

However, Ye Yuan was not any better either. This spear was too domineering, Ye Yuan still could not block it completely in the end.

Golden light flickered on Ye Yuan’s body, blue patterns swimming, but he flew out backward under the tremendous impact.

After the intense showdown, both people fell to the ground, life and death unknown.

“Sword intent akin to silk, this kid ... actually reached such a realm!” Jiang Hong looked at the Ye Yuan on the ground, eyes full of shock.

Sword intent akin to silk was not some specially designated realm, but it was a sublimation of sword intent application.

After Sword Daw law reached a transcendent realm, it did not reach the end.

When a martial artist’s application of sword intent was sublimated once more, it could reach the realm of sword intent akin to silk.

Legends had it that when Sword Dao law was cultivated to the extreme, grass and vegetation could be used as swords, one did not need any mystic treasure at all.

With a wave of a hand, it was all sword intent.

Ye Yuan reaching the realm of sword intent akin to silk was already taking a solid step towards the Great Dao of Sword.

The woodcutter’s shock was no less than Jiang Hong’s.

He also did not think that not seeing for 200 years, Ye Yuan’s strength was actually already so daunting.

This kind of talent was truly rare in the world!

On the stage, Qian Ye’s entire person was convulsing.

His body was already riddled full of holes. But with the might of Celestial Deity Realms, it was naturally not so easy to die.

While at this time, Ye Yuan’s finger moved and he actually slowly got up, and walked over toward Qian Ye.

Jiang Hong’s expression changed, Ye Yuan was going to kill people!

Jiang Hong’s figure moved, blocked in front of Ye Yuan, and said in a solemn voice, “Enough, you’ve already enjoyed all the limelight today. Leave it at that! The crime of you killing Zhong Hanlin, I’ll ask the sect for leniency. I believe that with your talent, the sect won’t do anything to you.”

Qian Ye was Heavenly Bud Peak’s top genius, and existence who even had hopes of breaking through to the True God Realm, he could not allow Qian Ye to be killed.

A Zhong Hanlin already died today, if Qian Ye died too, Heavenly Bud Peak’s young generation would surely have a missing generation.

Although Ye Yuan’s talent made Jiang Hong covet endlessly, Jiang Hong also understood that wanting to let Ye Yuan belong under Heavenly Bud Peak was already impossible.

If Ye Yuan was really willing to come, forget about one Qian Ye, even ten Qian Ye, he would not bat an eyelid too.

Ye Yuan was full of injuries all over his body. Even lifting his arm was difficult.

But he stood stubbornly and said coldly, “I said before, he must die today!”

Jiang Hong’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “Kid, don’t go too far! This seat’s patience has a limit!”

Ye Yuan did not show any weakness. Looking straight into Jiang Hong’s eyes, he said with a cold smile, “Elder Jiang is a skill-imparting elder. Then pray tell, what kind of crime is it to do harm to fellow disciples during the entrance examination? Also, sending me to Firecloud Peak to die with despicable means, what crime is that?”

Jiang Hong’s expression could not help choking and he said with a frown, “But you’re still standing here perfectly fine now! Furthermore, Zhong Hanlin was already killed by you, this matter ... can stop here already!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Zhong Hanlin was merely a clown jumping around! If not for Qian Ye stopping me, I’d have killed him at Shadowmoon Mountain Range. The real culprit is Qian Ye!”

Jiang Hong felt that Ye Yuan was somewhat pestering unreasonably already and said angrily, “Enough! This seat is here today. Could it be that you still want to kill people with the likes of you?”

Ye Yuan smiled miserably and said, “If I hadn’t exhibited my strength, it serves me right to be toyed to death by Qian Ye, is that it? Their lives are more valuable than others?”

Jiang Hong said coolly, “Otherwise? This is a world where the strong reigns supreme. Without strength, you can only be eliminated! Withdraw, it’s impossible for you to kill him today!”

The woodcutter gave Ye Yuan a glance and said with a sigh, “Ye Yuan, forget it. Qian Ye is Heavenly Bud Peak’s lifeblood, Jiang Hong won’t let you kill him.”

The woodcutter could naturally tell that Jiang Hong was unshakable in his resolve to protect Qian Ye.

Even if he acted, it would not work too.

Moreover, even if this matter was escalated up the sect, it was also Ye Yuan’s fault.

Ye Yuan killing a Zhong Hanlin was already unjustifiable. Killing another Qian Ye would be too much.

Ye Yuan looked at Jiang Hong and suddenly smiled.

When Jiang Hong saw Ye Yuan’s smile, he suddenly had a bad feeling.

Ye Yuan seethed with killing intent as he said, “Huhu, I, Ye Yuan, will definitely carry out what I said! If I want him to die, he must die!”

Jiang Hong’s brows furrowed, feeling that Ye Yuan was rather unreasonable.

He flicked his sleeves grandly. Qian Ye’s body flew towards Elder Tao involuntarily who said lightly, “Bring him to go treat his wounds!”

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan, revealing rather reluctant looks.

He had done so much, but in the end, he still could not kill Qian Ye.

It can’t be helped. There was a True God powerhouse taking action. No matter how strong Ye Yuan was, he was also unable to change the outcome.

Jiang Hong looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Killing Qian Ye, you can give up on this! Just for your attitude, if Woodcutter wasn’t here today, no matter how great your talent is, this seat will also kill you!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze suddenly became sharp and he said coldly, “I heard that as long as someone sounds the Big Dipper Seven Stars Drum, they can request the sect to do one thing. Elder Jiang, I wonder if ... it can make the sect kill him like this?”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
