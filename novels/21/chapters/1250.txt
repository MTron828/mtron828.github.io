Chapter 1254: The Divine Realm Doesn’t Have the Fiend Race?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I just know that my ancestor guarded the World Suppressing Stele for generation after generation. All the way until one day, the World Suppressing Stele’s light is no more, becoming dim. Our stoneman clan’s calamity started then,” Shi Potian said.

Hearing Shi Potian’s words, Ye Yuan also sighed endlessly.

The human race virtually wiped out the stoneman clan because of their greed, while the fiend race brought the crisis of race extermination to the human race now.

Who was right and who was wrong, Ye Yuan was powerless to argue too.

One could only say that this was a world where the weak were prey and the strong feasts.

Although Ye Yuan was the human race’s leader, he could not represent the human race.

Perhaps there were still other races that were already utterly buried in oblivion in the annals of history.

But as a member of the human race, Ye Yuan had an unshirkable duty to resist the fiend race.

As for the stoneman clan, Ye Yuan could only do his best to ensure their safety and let them carry on.

Of course, if an opportunity arose.

“Patriarch Shi, regarding the human race’s actions, this Ye is very sorry. If I can quell the turmoil of the fiend race, this Ye will definitely open up a chunk of region in the Divine Realm and let everyone have a place to rest,” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

Although Ye Yuan was not of some character that bemoaned the state of the universe and pitied the fate of mankind, towards clan extermination this kind of behavior, he felt that it went against heaven and reason.

The human race suffering this calamity might not be without the reason of the stoneman clan.

“Fiend race? I remember that the Divine Realm doesn’t have this race,” Shi Potian suddenly said.

This shock of Ye Yuan’s was by no means insignificant!

Did not have this race?

He did not doubt Shi Potian’s words. He had slumbered here for no idea how many tens of thousands of years. It might even be as long as a million years!

That was also to say that in the era where Shi Potian was active, the Divine Realm did not have the fiend race, this race!

Then ... Where did the current fiend race come from?

Ye Yuan was somewhat perturbed!

“You ... You’re certain? The Divine Realm is so huge, could there be some races that you don’t know of?” Ye Yuan felt like he still had to confirm a bit.

After all, the Divine Realm was too large!

Apart from already known areas, there were still many unknown lands.

Perhaps the fiend race ran out from there?

However, Shi Potian still shook his head and said, “The Divine Realm isn’t as large as you imagine. The places that Deity Realm powerhouses can go are far more than you imagine! But, I’ve never heard before that there’s some fiend race.”

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and forcefully calmed his emotions at this time a little.

He suddenly thought of something and asked again, “Patriarch Shi, then have you heard before Immortal Grove Region this name?”

Shi Potian still shook his head and said, “Never heard before.”

“Then do you know if there are still higher realms above Origin Deity Realm? Or perhaps, breaking through to the Origin Deity Realm, would one ascend to a higher plane’s world?” Ye Yuan made a detailed inquiry.

“According to what I know, the Origin Deity Realm shouldn’t be the endpoint. My stoneman clan’s ancestors’ strength should ride above the Deity Realm. However ... seems like they didn’t ascend to a higher plane world either,” Shi Potian said.

The more he asked, the more puzzled Ye Yuan got.

The old ancestor once said before, the four symbols’ progenitors’ strength was unimaginable. It even rode above the Origin Deity Realm.

Ye Yuan still remembered the land of ancestral spirits in the White Tiger Clan back then. The White Tiger Sacred Ancestor turned its nose up at the Deity Realm.

This was also to say that even if one broke through to the Origin Deity Realm, they were also unable to ascend.

Then, where did the fiend race come from?

Ye Yuan felt a thousand confused thoughts to attend to, just like a ball of huge mess in his mind, completely unable to sort out.

“Forget it, forget it, since I can’t sort it out, then I’ll ignore it! Patriarch Shi, previously was all a misunderstanding. Ye Yuan had no intention of offending. We still have urgent matters on hand and will take our leave here,” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

“Where is Master going?” Shi Potian asked.

“We’re going to the god-forbidden region to find the Kunwu Divine Wood,” Ye Yuan did not hide it and said honestly.

Stonebrave could not help being shocked when he heard that and said, “You guys really want to go to the god-forbidden region?”

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Can it be fake still?”

Stonebrave even thought that Ye Yuan was boasting. He did not expect that it was actually true!

“We’ll go together with you!” Shi Potian suddenly said.

“This ... The god-forbidden region is very dangerous. Patriarch Shi, your clansmen are just these few already. No need to take the risk with me,” Ye Yuan froze and said.

But Shi Potian’s attitude was very firm and he said, “The stoneman clan’s mission is to guard the World Suppressing Stele. Since you’re the World Suppressing Stele’s master, we naturally have to follow you. Even if our bones are ground to powder, we’ll have no regrets too.”

Ye Yuan did not think that this Shi Potian’s attitude was actually so resolute. For a moment, he found it quite hard to choose.

This trip, he himself actually did not have much assurance either. If he implicated the stoneman clan and resulted in their clan being exterminated, Ye Yuan would find it hard to set his mind at east.

“How about this? You guys stay here temporarily. If I can come out of the god-forbidden region, I’ll bring you guys out. How’s that?” Ye Yuan thought about it and said.

If he was able to break through to Deity Realm, everything would naturally be resolved with the greatest of ease.

“Shi Potian’s strength is passable, perhaps I can lend Master a helping hand. Master, regardless of whether you agree or not, Shi Potian must follow you!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ye Yuan was helpless. This Shi Potian’s strength was probably even above his. If he really wanted to follow him, he was really powerless to do anything.

“Alright then, you guys don’t resist. In the future, you all will stay in my quasi-divine artifact. When I need you all, this young master will naturally call you guys out,” Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said.

Setting off from the stoneman clan’s territory was already not very far from the god-forbidden region.

In a twinkle, half a month passed. Ye Yuan’s party finally stepped into the boundaries of the god-forbidden region.

“Big Brother, this god-forbidden region is simply akin to a ghost city. It looks very bleak and desolate! I feel goosebumps breaking out all over my body.” White Light involuntarily shuddered and said.

In front of them was a stretch of desolation.

Surveying all around, waves of terrifying auras came over.

Not just White Light had this feeling, even Ye Yuan also had a feeling of almost suffocating.

It was as if every blade of grass and tree here had an extraordinary taste.

This place was seemingly a completely different world from the outside world!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s alarm bells went off!

“Be careful!”

Two streaks of terrifying blood light suddenly flashed past, sneak attacking them from behind.

Ye Yuan’s perception was extremely sensitive, but he only captured it when it was just about to arrive as well.

These two streaks of blood lights’ targets were precisely White Light and Li-er.

The two streaks of blood lights arrived too quickly. Li-er and White Light had no time to react at all.

The arrival’s strength was very powerful!

Domain of Sword!

Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art!

Ye Yuan blocked in front of White Light and Li-er with a lunge.

Rumble! Rumble!

The two streaks of blood line bombarded right onto Ye Yuan’s body without any deviation.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan directly spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood, his body flying out backwards.

Even the three great fiendgods’ Starburst Grand Art did not breach Ye Yuan’s defense. These two unassuming streaks of blood light actually wounded Ye Yuan then moment they attacked!

“Big Brother!”

“Big Brother Yuan!”

When White Light and Li-er saw this scene, they cried out in shock at the same time.

“Jeje, what a powerful defense! Looks like you learned that old tortoise’s Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art. But ... it’s far from perfect yet!”

A strange laugh sounded out. Zhuge Qingxuan’s figure appeared in the three people’s line of sight.
