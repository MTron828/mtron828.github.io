Chapter 1856: Empyrean Death

“Can’t go? Lass, do you know what you’re saying?”

Gu Tianque’s brows furrowed, clearly somewhat unhappy.

This kind of massive lucky chance placed in front of him, whoever stopped him would simply be like the great enmity of killing one’s father.

Even if the one who stopped him was his own disciple.

Leng Qiuling still had an icy-cold face as she said calmly, “Master, there’s something fishy about this Empyrean inheritance.”

Leng Qiuling repeated Ye Yuan’s words, Gu Tianque listened until his brows were tightly knitted.

“What can that mean? Do you know what an Empyrean legacy signifies to Master?” Gu Tianque was still unmoved.

The allure of an Empyrean legacy was seriously too great. Especially for Gu Tianque this kind, who basically had no hopes of making any more breakthroughs.

Leng Qiuling was rather anxious as she said, “Ten days, just ten days, alright?”

Gu Tianque’s gaze turned sharp and he said, “This isn’t your idea, right?”

Leng Qiuling did not hide it either and said, “It’s Ye Yuan’s!”

Gu Tianque’s face fell and he could not help ruminating.

Ye Yuan’s matters, Leng Qiuling naturally would not hide from her own master either.

His true identity naturally also aroused Gu Tianque’s speculations in all respects. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Musing for a moment, Gu Tianque nodded and said, “Alright, just ten days!”

Thousand Soar Imperial Capital’s commotion practically spread out at once.

A major incident that shook the entire imperial capital, it could not be concealed even if one wanted to hide it too.

From the second day onwards, the figures of many experts appeared in the vicinity of Thousand Soar Imperial Capital.

True God powerhouses could not be casually seen even in places like imperial capitals too.

But now, inside and outside of the imperial capital, the figures of True God powerhouses could be seen everywhere.

Some of their auras were very powerful, even not beneath Gu Tianque’s.

On the third day, Gu Tianque finally could not hold back anymore.

“Master, didn’t you promise me to wait ten days?”

Leng Qiuling had always been keeping watch over Gu Tianque and discovered it at the first moment.

Gu Tianque said, “Lass, Master can’t wait anymore! Move aside!”

Leng Qiuling said with a stubborn face, “No way, you can’t go!”

Gu Tianque’s face fell, his figure directly vanishing before Leng Qiuling’s eyes.

If a Seventh Firmament True God powerhouse wanted to leave, how could Leng Qiuling stop him?

Gu Tianque directly went out of Thousand Soar Imperial Capital with a flash.

The distance of a million miles was not considered far for True God powerhouses. In a few breaths of time, Gu Tianque arrived at Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.

Sensing the powerful undulations coming from on top of the mountain, Gu Tianque felt an upsurge of emotions and even somewhat trembled agitatedly.

Suddenly, he laughed in spite of himself and said, “No matter how impressive that brat is, he’s also merely an initial-stage Celestial Deity Realm. What knowledge or experience can he have? This Empyrean legacy, I, Gu Tianque, am determined to get it!”

Finished saying, his figure leaped and was about to jump into Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.

But right at this time, a rolling black mist came close from afar and arrived in an instant.

“All get further away for Your Father! Old Fart Immortal Grove’s abode is mine, Blackfiend’s!”

“Puhwark!”

Just a sentence and it injured the Seventh Firmament True God Gu Tianque.

And this was even just an area-of-effect attack!

At this time, the True God powerhouses who were similarly concealed in the mountain range were likely all the same as him, getting injured.

“Fiend race empyrean!” Gu Tianque’s face changed and he cried out in shock.

This black mist was clearly an Empyrean-level powerhouse of the fiend race!

Gu Tianque did not expect that there would actually be an Empyrean powerhouse moving out so quickly.

Furthermore, it was even a fiend race Empyrean powerhouse.

“Ye Yuan punk screwed me over!”

Gu Tianque smacked his thigh and said with endless remorse and vexation.

If he entered Heavenly Sun Mountain Range at the first moment, he would definitely be able to take the initiative.

Now, even an Empyrean powerhouse had taken action, what had it got to do with him still?

Hence, he wished to take apart Ye Yuan’s bones right now.

This kind of lucky chance could not be encountered at any time!

A single slip and it would bring everlasting regret!

He could only helplessly watch that black mist land onto the mountain range and lament in pity.

Very soon, that black mist submerged fully into the mountain range, Gu Tianque had a look of despair.

This lucky chance had nothing to do with him anymore.

But right at this time, a shrill scream rose straight to the sky.

That black mist previously billowed in torrents once more.

Gu Tianque’s face changed, When he looked again, that black mist already became dim and dark, forming a sharp contrast with that imposing momentum previously.

“Old Fart Immortal Grove, why are you still powerful when you’ve died already?” That black mist wailed miserably.

“Heh, fiend race dog, since you came, how can I let you escape! Die for me!”

A void that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life spread out, following that, a ray of light rose to the sky from within the mountain range, directly hitting that cloud of black mist.

Immediately, this world was silent.

One gaze after another looked towards the sky, incredibly shocked.

An exalted Empyrean powerhouse died in front of them just like this?

Gu Tianque swallowed his saliva, discovering that he was somewhat parched.

So close, if not for this fiend race Empyrean powerhouse, the one dead right now would probably be him, right?

It seemed like what Ye Yuan said was right. This was totally a setup, in order to draw some people over.

How could the real legacy be obtained so easily?

Didn’t they see that even an Empyrean powerhouse was instantly one-shotted?

This Immortal Grove was absolutely a daunting figure even to the extreme big-shots when he was alive.

...

Carrying the mood of having survived a disaster, Gu Tianque returned to Thousand Soar Imperial Capital.

When Leng Qiuling saw Gu Tianque, she also heaved a long sigh in relief.

“Master, are ... are you okay?”

Leng Qiuling saw Gu Tianque’s somewhat absent-minded appearance and could not help asking in concern.

Gu Tianque glanced at Leng Qiuling and said, “Master ... almost couldn’t come back anymore!”

Leng Qiuling’s face changed and she said, “What happened?”

Gu Tianque smiled bitterly and recounted the scene that happened previously, saying: “This time, it was all thanks to you and Ye Yuan. If not for you guys, this old life of mine would probably be lost at Heavenly Sun Mountain Range. You help me thank Ye Yuan well; no, you call him here, I want to thank him personally!”

Leng Qiuling listened until she felt lingering fear too.

An Empyrean powerhouse was exterminated in an instant, this sort of thing was simply unheard of.

Just how powerful of an existence was this Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove when he was alive?

Although Gu Tianque did not adhere to the ten days deadline and ran off in-advance, if not for these two days of delay, Gu Tianque would definitely be dead without a doubt.

This Empyrean abode was clearly not what the Thousand Soar Imperial Capital could devour alone already.

When Ye Yuan came over, Gu Tianque thanked Ye Yuan ardently.

Reaching his level, he regarded his life as the most important thing.

Ye Yuan’s one sentence saved his life, how could he not be moved.

But, when Ye Yuan heard the demise of an Empyrean, he knew that this was likely a retaliatory act of Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove against his enemies.

Sure enough, in the following days, Thousand Soar Imperial Capital was amidst the winds of change, and suddenly became the vortex of a storm.

Within a short half a month, there were actually three Empyrean powerhouses who died in Heavenly Sun Mountain Range.

Empyrean powerhouses, each one was a formidable existence that could make the Heavenspan World tremble with a stomp of their feet. Three actually died all at once.

As for those True God powerhouses that no one paid attention to, no idea how many had died already.

At this time, everyone finally realized that this abode was not easy to enter!
