Chapter 2551: Ye Yuan’s Business Sense

“B-Brother Tang, w-we were wrong. Please forgive us!”

A bunch of people knelt down before Tang Jinhua father and son.

These guards had already become one-armed men, but they still had to endure the severe pain to kowtow and admit their fault to the Tang Family father and son.

Looking at the group of guards in front of them who lowered their heads in admission of their crime, Tang Jinhua father and son felt very liberated.

None of these people went easy when they attacked just now.

If not for Second Prince and Master Yun arriving in time, they might have already been beaten to death!

The anger was pretty much vented. Tang Jinhua was just about to open his mouth and speak, but heard Ye Yuan suddenly point at Xie Hua and said quietly, “You, did you attack just now?”

Xie Hua’s entire body trembled, his expression changing wildly.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Looks like you attacked too! Why? Are you more special than them?”

Xie Hua immediately broke out in cold sweat and said fearfully, “I-I’m Nation Teacher’s disciple! Master, I …”

Lin Lan’s gaze turned dark and he said, “Ye Yuan, give this nation teacher face and spare his arm. This nation teacher will make him kowtow and apologize for his crime to the Tang Family, and I will show additional generous thanks!”

To a heavenly alchemist, severing an arm was equivalent to losing one’s alchemy career, equivalent to losing all glory!

These guards’ strengths were still there.

But it would be doubly difficult for Xie Hua to want to refine pills again!

Ye Yuan grinned and said coolly, “How much is your face worth?”

Lin Lan’s expression changed. Everyone sucked in a cold breath.

Even Second Prince and Lu Yun also broke out in cold sweat.

This was offending Nation Teacher to the core!

Of course, this was because they did not understand Ye Yuan.

He was actually a very amicable person. But don’t touch his reverse-scale!

Once his bottom-line was crossed, even if you were the Jade Emperor, he would not give face either!

The Tang Family father and son getting abused innocently, this was his bottom-line!

If he did it, he would have to pay the price!

Pleading?

It did not exist!

Lin Lan said in a cold voice, “Ye Yuan, are you trying to fall out completely with this nation teacher?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “So what if yes?”

Lin Lan laughed from extreme fury and said, “Good! Very good! It’s really been a long time since anyone has dared to treat this nation teacher like this in this Eastward Country! You’re very good!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Alright, stop posturing! You haven’t even passed your own hurdle yet!”

Lin Lan’s face turned black, and he almost vomited blood.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Why? Are you going to tear up the origin divinity contract? Our contract includes that whoever took action will cut off an arm!”

If Ye Yuan was willing, he could naturally exempt Xie Hua’s punishment.

But he was not willing. This would be Lin Lan violating the origin divinity contract, the consequences were extremely serious.

Lin Lan’s entire body shook and he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Xie Hua, cut off your arm!”

“M-Master!” Xie Hua was almost crying. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Master asked you to sever your arm, didn’t you hear it?” Lin Lan practically roared it out.

Xie Hua had a look of despair, but he still refused to sever his arm.

Lin Lan frowned and immediately turned into an afterimage, arriving in front of Xie Hua.

Puchi!

One of Xie Hua’s arms was actually forcibly torn off by Lin Lan.

Lin Lan suddenly turned around, glared at Ye Yuan fiercely, and said, “Are you satisfied?”

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled, and he said, “Doesn’t matter whether I’m satisfied or not. This is what he deserves!”

Lin Lan’s eyes were full of killing intent and he said in a cold voice, “Go! Kneel down and apologize!”

Xie Hua almost passed out from the pain. But he did not dare to defy Lin Lan’s order and could only come before the Tang Family father and son, and kowtowed in apology.

The Tang Family father and son exchanged glances and actually felt like they were sitting on pins and needles.

The delight from before already turned into alarm and horror.

Ye Yuan was too ruthless, this was not leaving any leeway in the slightest!

“Relax! If you can’t even withstand this bit of spectacle, don’t follow me in the future! If you guys feel that your anger isn’t vented, there’s no harm in killing a few for fun!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The Tang Family father and son trembled all over and steeled their hearts, immediately feeling much tougher.

Ye Yuan was really too domineering!

They could not lose face either!

The Tang Family already had no path of retreat, there was only following Ye Yuan all the way.

Furthermore, following someone who was loyal to friends like Ye Yuan seemed to be a pretty good choice too!

It was just that in the eyes of the onlookers, Ye Yuan was a complete and utter lunatic!

If enmity was not settled amicably, there would be no end to it!

Offending Nation Teacher to the core in Eastward Country, what benefit was there?

Ye Yuan’s gaze looked toward Lin Lan, and he said with a faint smile, “Lord Nation Teacher, it’s your turn!”

The killing intent in Lin Lan’s chest currently billowed to the sky, and he was long already overwhelmed with rage.

But he was restraint by the origin divinity contract and did not dare to make a move at all.

His eyes were fixed on Ye Yuan, and he opened his mouth and said, “This nation teacher asks you one last time, are you really going to offend this nation teacher to the core?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you must think of it this way, then let me tell you, yes!”

Lin Lan’s two eyes almost narrowed into a slit.

Suddenly, he turned around, arrived before the Tang Family father and son, gave a deep bow, and said, “Gentlemen, I’m sorry!”

Finished saying this, he did not wait for the Tang Family father and son to agree, and he was going to turn around and leave. “Let’s go!”

“Wait!” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Boom!

Lin Lan’s aura instantly rose to the peak, and he glared at Ye Yuan and said, “Brat, do you really think that this nation teacher doesn’t dare to kill you?”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Nation Teacher is advanced in age already. Your temper is still so bad! This Ye doesn’t have other meaning. It’s just that seeing so many people with severed arms, I can’t help but want to solicit some business.”

Finished saying, he said smilingly to those guards with severed arms, “Gentlemen, the Tang Family will launch an exclusive Jasper Regeneration Pill within five years! If you all want to recover your severed arm, remember to come and patronize the Tang Family’s business!”

Those guards trembled all over, looking at Ye Yuan with hopeful faces.

They were no strangers to the name Jasper Regeneration Pill.

In reality, this pill formula was not Gu Mao’s exclusive pill formula.

At least, there was this pill formula in Lin Lan’s hands.

But no one could refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill in Eastward Country!

Nation Teacher could not either!

If that the refining difficulty of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was entry-level, then the refining difficulty of the Jasper Regeneration Pill was demon-level!

The complexity of this heavenly pill exceeded imaginations.

It was hard for ordinary grade two heavenly alchemists to refine it too.

Lin Lan sneered and said, “What a joke! With just the likes of you, you can refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill within five years?”

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Lan with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Lord Nation Teacher, I feel that your gambling integrity is pretty good. Why not, let’s make another bet? I’ll give you another chance, if I can’t refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill within five years, I’ll be at your disposal, how about it?”

“I …” Lin Lan’s words reached his mouth and were forcibly swallowed back.

This ascender in front of him was seriously too bizarre!

Who knew whether he could really refine it within five years or not!

“Ha, if you don’t dare to bet, don’t talk nonsense here!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

Lin Lan exploded!

He said in a great rage, “Brat, this nation teacher will make this bet with you! If you can’t refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill within five years, this nation teacher will definitely make you die very horribly!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was amused and said, “Okay! If I can refine it, why don’t you give this position of nation teacher up to me? How about it?”
