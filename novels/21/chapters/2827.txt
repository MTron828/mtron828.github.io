Chapter 2833: Shocking Absolute Heaven!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Outside of the Absolute Heaven Barrier, on the distant Thundercry Continent, an army of several hundred thousand blood race members was awaiting eagerly for battle already, blood energy surging to the sky!

‘The Emperor Realm powerhouses present reached as many as several hundred!

A figure stood proudly in the void, covering the sky with only one hand!

The spatial passageway was slowly taking shape in precisely his hand.

This person was the blood race’s Hegemon Realm powerhouse, Bloodsky!

Beside Bloodsky, a youth in a blue shirt said with a smile, “Brother Bloodsky really has excellent means! The stabilizing of this spatial passageway is brought forward half a month earlier than expected!”

Bloodsky said proudly, “That’s of course! This seat’s spatial divine abilities can traverse the void like walking on flat ground! If not for that Heaven One Continent has dozens of Hegemon Realms joining forces, this seat only needs half a day to open up this spatial channel!”

Opening such a spatial passageway was really not easy.

Not only did one have to avoid the Absolute Heaven Barrier, it even had to be able to accommodate Hegemon Realms and countless blood race troops.

Without corresponding attainments in spatial rule, it was absolutely impossible to succeed.

Bloodsky, this blood race hegemon, had always been wandering the heavens and only came to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven recently.

Failing to conquer Heaven One for a long time, a restless mood also spread in the blood race.

Therefore, Bloodsky’s arrival immediately made him sought after like a myriad of stars surrounding the moon!

Of course, Hegemon Realm powerhouses proficient in spatial divine abilities were worthy of it!

There were many hegemons across the heavens, but those who were experts in spatial rule were scanty few.

Bloodsky was definitely worthy of being a major power!

The youth in the blue shirt gave a thumbs up and said, “Amazing, Brother Bloodsky!”

Bloodsky’s mouth curled, and he said, “A trivial matter! There are at most still three days, and then the passageway will be able to completely stabilize. The army will be able to march right in without resistance! Qing Yao, the hegemon blood that the clan promised this seat, you mustn’t go back on your

words!”

Qing Yao hurriedly said, “Brother Bloodsky is worrying too much! You’re our blood race’s spatial major power right now. How could the clan possibly go back on our word?”

Bloodsky snorted coldly and said, “I reckon that you all won’t dare either!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But right at this moment, Bloodsky’s expression suddenly changed.

“petite!”

Bloodsky seemed to have suffered a heavy blow, his entire person shooting backward, fresh blood spurting wildly from his mouth.

Rumble!

Before Qing Yao had time to think too much, he heard intense explosion sounds coming from the spatial passageway.

His expression changed wildly, and he roared loudly, “Retreat!”

It was only to see him flick his sleeves grandly. A gust of strong wind blew past. Tens of thousands of troops were directly sent flying out.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The spatial passageway directly exploded above the void, sweeping up terrifying air billows.

Of course, this air billow could not harm him. But his expression was incomparably ugly.

It was because the spatial passageway had completely collapsed!

In order to open up the spatial passageway, the blood race expended a huge amount of resources!

Now, it was actually all for naught?

“Brother Bloodsky, what’s going on?” Qing Yao said in a solemn voice.

Bloodsky suffered a backlash, sustaining considerable injuries too. He said in a solemn voice, “The spatial passageway was damaged by someone from inside! The other party is at least Hegemon Realm! This spatial passageway is completely ruined!”

Qing Yao’s expression changed, and he said, “How is that possible? Heaven One’s Hegemon Realms are currently all at the Absolute Heaven Barrier!”

Bloodsky shook his head and said, “It’s definitely a Hegemon Realm! Furthermore, the other party has extremely profound attainments in spatial rule! Otherwise, it’s impossible for the spatial rule that I constructed to completely collapse!”

The collapse of the spatial passageway and the spatial passageway being damaged, they were two completely different things!

This kind of caving style collapse could only be accomplished if one’s comprehension in spatial rule reached an extremely terrifying level!

If it was not a Hegemon Realm, Bloodsky would not believe it even if he was beaten to death too!

With regards to Bloodsky’s words, Qing Yao naturally would not doubt it.

He was proud, but it was impossible to lie about this kind of thing too.

“Could it be that Heaven One Continent has a new Hegemon Realm that appeared? No can do! This matter is extraordinary, I’ll go report to Lord Wang Zuo!” Qing Yao had a solemn look as he turned around and left.

Absolute Heaven Barrier, it extended for no idea how many tens of thousands of miles.

This place was Heaven One Continent’s final barrier and also Heaven One Continent’s last hope.

At this time, it appeared somewhat quiet in the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

“Divine Lord is heavyhearted today. Could it be that you’re worried about the war on the northern front?” In the Absolute Heaven Barrier, a voice suddenly came over.

Heaven One Alliance, the highest commander was revered as the common lord and addressed respectfully as Divine Lord.

Heaven One’s Divine Lord was Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s number one Hegemon Realm, Xue Ziming.

After a long time, a male voice that was full of energy said, “This seat has heard of Bloodsky’s name before. His spatial divine abilities are transcendent, catching up to Hegemon Mi Tian of back then. This time, if not for a little fellow taking the risk of death to deliver the message, our Grand Brightjade

Complete Heaven would be finished! But even so, this seat doesn’t harbor any hope for this last battle too. Everyone, be mentally prepared! Sigh, this seat has let the northern front’s warriors down!”

Inside the Absolute Heaven Barrier, it fell into silence for a moment.

These Hegemon Realms were all clear about the northern front’s war situation.

But they were unable to change anything.

‘These few days, the southern front experienced several great battles. Hegemon Realm powerhouses fought many times, and both sides had losses.

As for ordinary soldiers, the casualties were beyond count.

They could not leave!

Ahegemon powerhouse spoke up, “Divine Lord doesn’t need to blame yourself. Dan Fei they all have a fair idea about this in their hearts. Our Heaven One’s men don’t have any who clings to life and fears death!”

Divine Lord let out a sigh and said, “This seat can sense that the northern front’s war has already died down. Most likely … it has already ended!”

He did not continue saying the words at the back, but the others all understood that the northern front had most likely fallen completely already!

The Absolute Heaven Barrier’s Hegemon Realms fell silent again.

A Hegemon Realm suddenly sighed and said, “Sigh, the northern front being captured, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is in imminent danger! In the future, we can only take it one step at a time!”

“Reporting!”

Suddenly, a voice sounded out, reverberating throughout the entire Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Divine Lord’s heart went thump. He knew that the northern front’s outcome came!

Even if he was Hegemon Realm, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s number one person, he was also flustered at this time.

After all, the outcome of the northern front was too important!

Although he knew that there was not any hope, he still hoped that he could hear a not-so-bad news.

“Feihong, what’s the situation … over at Dan Fei there?” Divine Lord said in a solemn voice.

Zang Feihong, the number one person beneath Hegemon!

Heaven One Alliance, Hegemon Realms held down the fort at the Absolute Heaven Barrier!

And below the highest commander was Zang Feihong!

‘When Zang Feihong heard the northern front’s war report, he came to the Absolute Heaven Barrier straight away and informed the various great Hegemons through the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Hearing Divine Lord ask, Zhang Feihong forcefully suppressed the surging in his heart, and said loudly, “Replying Divine Lord, Your Excellency, the northern front’s Dan Fei won a great victory. The spatial passageway completely collapsed. The northern front no longer has any more worries! Killed May,

one of the Emperor Sakra Ten Heavens. Killed an Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouse, Lotuswearl. We completely wiped out the blood race’s northern front army! The dozen over Emperor Realm powerhouses that entered Heaven One through the spatial passageway and 30 thousand troops are completely

annihilated! Our Heaven One Alliance is mighty!”

Zang Feihong, this Emperor Sakra Heaven’s number one person, was currently excited until his arms and legs were waving around. It was as if a child who got praised by an adult.

But the Absolute Heaven Barrier fell into a death-like silence.

Without a doubt, the Hegemons were all shocked by this news!

This news was too shocking, shocking until it could not be surpassed!

“Feihong, this kind of thing can’t be joked around!” Divine Lord’s voice was practically trembling…
