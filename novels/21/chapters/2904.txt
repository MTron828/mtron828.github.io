Chapter 2910: Sublime Pill Sect’s Ancestor!

The moment these words came out, everyone could not help trembling all over.

Their ancestor was the senior apprentice brother of this bloodkin in front of him?

Believe my *ss!

Sect Master gave a cold laugh and said, “What kind of existence was that person? How can he possibly take you, a bloodkin, in as a disciple? Do you think that you can smoke your way through like this?”

Actually, the sect master already believed it 40%-50%!

Others did not know, but he knew that this place was where the barrier of heavens was at!

This person crossed worlds and even carried the tobacco pouch in his hand. This already indicated a problem.

It was just that the only confusing aspect was the blood race aura on Ye Yuan’s body. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Over 70 thousand years ago, my master crossed worlds and came …”

Ye Yuan was not long-winded either, repeating the events that Cloudmount told him about.

The expression on the sect master’s face became fascinating.

This secret, Ancestor would only tell it to the sect master!

And what Ye Yuan said was not the slightest bit off!

Although it was only a short five days, it was Ancestor Hang Yang’s astonishing fortuitous encounter.

It was also precisely these five days that opened up Ancestor Hang Yang’s path of cultivation, letting him reach Emperor Sakra Heaven later on!

It also let the Sublime Pill Sect, this measly little sect, rise like a comet!

Sect Master’s heart shook wildly, but the doubt in his eyes grew stronger, and he said, “That lord was born in the human race. Why would he take you in as a disciple? Moreover, you’re just a measly little lower True Sovereign Heaven!”

“I’m not of the blood race, as for this bloody aura …”

Ye Yuan did not conceal it either, recounting the background of the bloody aura.

It was just that when these disciples heard it, they all felt like Ye Yuan was boasting.

“Huhu,?who doesn’t know how to brag? I can even say that I’ve killed a Hegemon before!”

“Blood race’s Blood Divine Son! You might as well as that you’re Lord Wang Zuo, wouldn’t that be better?”

“You even transformed into a bloodkin and ran to the blood race to become their Blood Divine Son!?Huhu!?Is the blood race so easy to pass off? Do you think that their Hegemon Realms are all idiots?”

“I say, if you’re passing off as a human, can’t you find a better reason? Are you treating us as idiots?”

“Didn’t you say that you swept across the blood race? Then us, these people, you could find it a cinch, right? Come on, try sweeping us away!”

… …

Not seeing it with their own eyes, Ye Yuan’s experiences were indeed too fantastical.

When others heard it, it naturally became boasting.

But, Sect Master’s eyes flickered indeterminately, and he actually believed him a little more.

He knew what a terrifying existence that person was!

The more terrifying Ancestor’s strength became, the more he could feel the unfathomability of that person!

Maybe only such an incredible genius was worthy of being his disciple, right?

One shouldn’t look at how Ancestor Hang Yang professed to be a disciple; that was actually just gilding gold onto his own face.

That person completely looked down on Ancestor Hang Yang!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Alright! As long as the sect master doesn’t make a move, it doesn’t matter if tenfold more comes.”

Everyone was taken aback. This guy really dared to go along with it!

Blatant provocation!

Sublime Pill Sect’s disciples completely exploded, requesting to battle one after another!

One had to know that there were still three half-step Emperor Realms among the True Sovereign Heavens here.

There were as many as seven grand completion True Sovereign Heavens here!

As for those below True Sovereign Heaven, there were dozens of them!

Sect Master was also somewhat moved and said, “Fine. I won’t make a move!”

Hence, Sublime Pill Sect’s disciples each rubbed their fists and wiped their palms, wanting to eliminate Ye Yuan.

Since they were taking action, then life and death need not be discussed.

An hour later, the world was silent.

Apart from the three half-step Emperor Realms, the rest had all collapsed!

This was still Ye Yuan pulling his punches. Otherwise, those people would virtually have died out.

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with astonished faces. This guy’s strength was too terrifying.

Below grand completion, one punch each.

Grand completion realm, took a bit of effort.

Half-step Emperor Realm, by relying on the Wandering the Divine Space, the other party could not do anything to Ye Yuan at all!

At present, Ye Yuan’s bloodline power had already reached peak battle soul level after experiencing several baptisms.

Jumping realms and battling within True Sovereign Heaven was not much different from eating and drinking.

This time, they somewhat believed it.

It was because when Ye Yuan was fighting with them, he clearly still had strength to spare.

It was not impossible to sweep across the blood race!

When the sect master saw Ye Yuan’s strength, monstrous waves were set off in his heart.

This was a true genius!

Only this kind of genius had the qualifications to acknowledge that person as master!

Ye Yuan took out a heavenly pill and said to the sect master, “This is the Blood Imitation Pill. After consuming it, one will be able to simulate the aura of a bloodkin.”

At this time, the sect master already believed 70%!

He found a True Sovereign Heaven who consumed the Blood Imitation Pill. Sure enough, that disciple’s aura became exactly alike that of a bloodkin!

With this, everyone was convinced!

There was really such a miraculous heavenly pill!

At this point, the sect master drew a deep breath, prostrated on the ground, and said, “Disciple Wang Jun pays respect to ancestor! What are you all still in a daze for? You all pay homage to Ancestor every day. Now that you’re seeing his disciple, why haven’t you prostrated?”

The other disciples exchanged glances. In the end, they still went on their knees.

“Paying respects to Ancestor!”

Although he foresaw it long ago, Ye Yuan was still somewhat doubtful as he said, “Aren’t you afraid that I’m a spy of the blood race?”

Wang Jun shook his head and said, “During these few thousands of years, our Sublime Pill Sect’s powerhouses have dwindled repeatedly. From Ancestor Hang Yang to Emperor Vast Heaven, then to Emperor Cloud Heaven, then to me, this incompetent disciple, the sect master has changed three times! But Ancestor Hang Yang has passed down, if we see the Treasured Glass Tobacco Pouch one day, we’ll have to treat them with the manners of treating our forefather! For our Sublime Pill Sect to be able to have today, it was all thanks to Patriarch! Since Patriarch acknowledged Ancestor, then we’ll naturally treat you in accordance with the manners of treating our forefathers!”

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “It has also been hard on Hang Yang, this senior brother of mine! You all probably don’t know our master’s name yet, right?”

Wang Jun said excitedly, “Ancestor, please inform us!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “You all remember, our master is Cloudmount, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s Extreme Medicine Sect’s ancestor!”

Wang Jun’s entire body trembled, and he said with amazement, “It … It’s actually Ancestor Cloudmount!”

Cloudmount’s reputation was extremely resounding. Wang Jun had naturally heard of it before too.

It was just that he did not think that his own ancestor actually had such a great background!

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “You all didn’t go and cultivate but came here en-mass to pay homage to Master. What is it for?”

He had always been very curious!

Even if Hang Yang respected and honored his teacher, it was also not to such an extent of making the sect’s disciples pay homage every day, right?

Could it be that these guys all did not need to cultivate?

Wang Jun smiled bitterly and said, “Getting pointers from Patriarch, my Sublime Pill Sect soared to the heaven in one bound, and also became a top sect of Soul Awakening Continent, the disciples under our sect nearing ten thousand, powerhouses plentiful as clouds! It’s just a pity that several thousand years ago, the blood race came to invade, my Sublime Pill Sect’s powerhouses dwindled to zero. Now … there’s only me, one Emperor Realm, remaining!”

Speaking up to here, Wang Jun could not help quietly shed tears.

Over the years, too many people died!

Ye Yuan was secretly shocked in his heart. Was this Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven actually exactly alike Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven too?

But very soon, he realized that he was wrong!

In this Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven, the soul race was the well-deserved overlord.

Even the human race which spanned across all the heavens were unable to contend with them too.

There were how many races that could contend with the blood race. However, this soul race was precisely one of them!

It was just that when immortals fight, the little demons suffer!

At present, the soul race and blood race were at war, but there were not many real fights.

Both sides were driving out the humans, attacking each other.

Actually, the ones who died the most were the humans instead!
