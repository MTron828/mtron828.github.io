Chapter 2588: Humiliate Me!

At this time, Ye Yuan suddenly got up and said, “Old man, it’s time for us to go down and compete.”

Everyone roused themselves. This arrogant and flaunting guy was finally going to make a move!

Was this trash-like aptitude really impressive, or did he hold a position without qualifications? It was going to be revealed to the world.

The arrogance from before already whetted everyone’s appetites.

But in everyone’s view, the likelihood that Ye Yuan was posturing was higher.

Really arriving at this time, he should be nervous.

But now, Ye Yuan actually took the initiative to provoke. It seriously exceeded everyone’s expectations.

Qin Shun’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “Brat, you wouldn’t be thinking that you can beat me because that fellow won Jingxuan, right??Huhu,?this old man also wants to see how high the quality the heavenly pill refined by a four-point affinity can be!”

Ye Yuan gave him a deep look and suddenly turned to Sect Master and said, “Sect Master, this girl’s talent is very good. It’s too wasteful to be put in this old man’s hands. Why not let her come to me, how about it?”

Sect Master was stunned, Qin Shun was taken aback too.

They did not expect that he had not even competed in alchemy yet and Ye Yuan actually started to publicly poach people!

Qin Shun flew into a great rage when he heard that and said, “Brat, you’re also too impudent! Shouldn’t you think about passing this old man’s hurdle first before talking?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I think that this alchemy battle isn’t necessary anymore. It’s too troublesome.”

Qin Shun sneered and said, “Brat, what tricks did you think of again? Want to avoid this alchemy battle??Huhu,?let me tell you, you have to compete in this alchemy battle whether you want to or not!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re mistaken, what I mean is, you pick three kinds of grade one heavenly pills, I’ll refine first. After I refine finish, if you feel that you can surpass me, then you refine it. If there’s a heavenly pill that you surpass me in quality, consider it that I lose!”

“What?! This guy is also too arrogant, right?”

“Master Qin is, at any rate, a grade three heavenly alchemist, this guy doesn’t take him seriously at all!”

“Impressive! Really impressive! Your Father has grown so old and has never met such an arrogant fellow before! Got personality! It’s just that I don’t know whether he has this strength to support his arrogance or not!”

… …

Ye Yuan’s words caused a stir again.

Such arrogant words could simply be described as condescending.

A guy who was not even sure whether or not he was a grade one heavenly alchemist, actually completely ignored a grade three heavenly alchemist!

“Impudent! Arrogant! Ignorant! Who do you think you are?”

Qin Shun was completely filled with anger.

His lungs were about to explode from anger!

A second ago, Ye Yuan openly poached his disciple from him.

In the next second, he directly treated him as air!

How proud was he, this grade three heavenly alchemist? When had he been insulted by someone like this before?

But Ye Yuan had a smile on his face as he said to Qin Shun, “Actually, I’m saving time for everyone too! Old man, I say, if I ruin my first medicinal pill, wouldn’t you and Elder Shi be able to kill me right and properly? Moreover, there are so many grade one heavenly pills, you can make things difficult for me! You can take out your private pill formulas. All in all, you can use all means to humiliate me. This way, everyone also saves time, isn’t that right?”

Everyone was completely speechless.

Ye Yuan really let them witness what was called arrogant without limit.

What he said was in order to save everyone’s time.

But, as long as one was not a fool, they would be able to tell that Ye Yuan’s subtext was that no matter what means you employed, Your Father could completely crush you!

This kind of arrogance without limit was already not arrogance, but extremely conceited.

“Huhuhu,?your meaning is that even if I take out a pill formula that you’ve never refined before, you can refine it all the same?” Qin Shun laughed from extreme fury/

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “That’s right! If you stump me with your first pill formula, everyone can save time. How about it, consider it?”

“No need to consider, this old man agrees to you! This method is very good!”

Qin Shun suddenly calmed down, it was just that his words carried an icy-cold killing intent.

Everyone knew that there was a show to watch!

While Sect Master shook his head slightly. He felt more and more that this boy Luo Yunqing found was not reliable.

Young people could be frivolous, but being like Ye Yuan, it was not frivolous at all, but courting death!

Qin Shun took out a jade slip, threw it to Ye Yuan, and said, “This is Crimson Cloud Heavenly Pill’s pill formula. If you can refine it, consider it my loss!”

Wu Chengchao said in surprise, “You actually have the Crimson Cloud Heavenly Pill’s pill formula! I heard that these heavenly pills can cure myriad poisons under the heavens. It’s extremely powerful! I heard that this pill formula has already been lost. Furthermore, the refining difficulty is extremely high. I didn’t expect that you would actually have it in your hands!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Shun smiled coldly and said, “This old man has already obtained this pill formula for decades. To this date, I can only refine lower third grade! I really want to see whether or not this master can refine it.”

Everyone turned pale with fright when they heard it.

A medicinal pill that a grade three heavenly alchemist could only refine lower third grade, the refining difficulty could be imagined.

How could a grade one heavenly alchemist possibly refine such a pill formula?

Ye Yuan received the jade slip and said with a smile, “No, no, no, we’d best stick to what was said before! Three heavenly pills, as long as you can surpass me in one, consider it my loss!”

Qin Shun sneered and said,?“Huhu,?since you’re courting death yourself, then this old man will grant your wish! Come, men! Prepare the heavenly medicine!”

Ye Yuan’s figure floated down and he arrived in front of Wen Jingxuan and said, “Lass, how about it, consider my proposition.”

Wen Jingxuan smiled coldly and said, “Talk to me about this again if you can live!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and was not long-winded either, sitting down cross-legged and started studying the pill formula.

This pill formula was indeed extremely difficult. But ever since Ye Yuan obtained Zhong Jianchou’s three pieces of jade slips, he had already pretty much studied entirely these basic pill formulas during the past few years.

Ye Yuan achieved mastery through a comprehensive study of these basic pill formulas and already reached the grand completion realm of the first level of heavenly pill rule.

Refining extremely high difficulty medicinal pills on this foundation was not considered very hard.

Two hours later, Ye Yuan arrived in front of the medicine cauldron solemnly.

That appearance looked somewhat comical in the eyes of the others.

Many people had cold smiles, waiting to see Ye Yuan make a fool of himself.

However, the moment the extraction started, everyone’s expressions changed!

That transcendent, brilliant to the pinnacle fire controlling technique, that incomparably pure heavenly medicine, it all displayed Ye Yuan’s unparalleled strength without exception!

Before this, there had already been two masters who demonstrated their extraction technique.

But, if Ye Yuan’s extraction technique was a perfect score of 100, then Lin Lan’s extraction technique was only one point!

As for Wen Jingxuan, she did not even reach one point!

This was simply the difference in levels!

The refinement that followed even made everyone feel bedazzled and incredibly shocked.

Shi Feiyu, Qin Chao, Wu Chengchao, Shi Feiyu, even including Luo Yunqing, they were all shocked until they stared dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

“This … How is this possible? His affinity is only four points. So how does he feel the power of rule in the heavenly medicines? If he can’t feel the power of rule in the heavenly medicines, how does he refine heavenly pills?” Qin Shun opened his mouth wide, his face full of puzzlement and shock.
