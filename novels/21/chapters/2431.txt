Chapter 2437: Majesty of Saint Azure!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You’re asking me to receive a sword from you? Hahaha, Lord Saint Azure’s arrogance really makes Lin Huan admire you! It’s just ... don’t talk about one sword, so what if ten swords?”

After Lin Huan heard Ye Yuan’s words, he could not resist laughing out loud.

This kind of ridiculous ant-like pride was really hilarious!

Saint Azure was indeed admired by thousands, but so what?

In the end, Ye Yuan was merely a young eagle who had yet to take flight.

In front of a real powerhouse, this kind of pride appeared that laughable.

Even if you created an eternal prosperous age, so what?

Times were already different!

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “No need. One sword is enough! If you lose, scram for this saint. A good dog won’t block the path.”

Lin Huan’s gaze turned sullen and he said with a cold smile, “If I lose, I’ll naturally move aside!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Mn, well-behaved, a good dog!”

“Pffft ...”

Many people could not resist spraying out.

Lin Huan smiled coldly and said, “Don’t be so sure! Indulge in a contention of mouth and tongue again after you can hurt me!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Mn, then you receive it well. Don’t say that you didn’t prepare adequately when you lose.”

As he said, Ye Yuan slowly took out the Limitless God Killing Bow.

The might of a Dao artifact bloom once again!

However, this time, the aura emitting off of the Limitless God Killing Bow was stronger than any other time before.

That terrifying aura made everyone’s expressions change abruptly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At present, Ye Yuan was currently developing a myriad of lives in his small world and already stepped into the realm of Creation, his strength being much stronger than Deva First Blight.

Reaching this realm, Ye Yuan’s understanding of Heavenly Dao already reached an exceedingly terrifying level.

His cultivation realm, and strength, was already completely capable of unleashing the might of a Dao artifact.

A soft jade light emitted off the Limitless God Killing Bow.

That power seemed to be the might of heaven descending upon the world.

In the Origin Enlighten Hall, the imposing auras of the group of Dao Ancestors also curdled.

“That’s the Arrow God’s Limitless God Killing Bow! Didn’t expect that this thing actually landed in Ye Yuan’s hands!” Ancestor Water said in surprise.

“Arrow God’s arrow pierced the clouds back then, severely wounding Daymeld, before sealing him up. Looking at Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum, he’s already capable of completely unleashing the power of this Limitless God Killing Bow! Have you all noticed it? Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm seems like he just entered the Deva Realm, the thickness of his divine essence is already no less than a Deva Second Blight! I don’t know what cultivation method there is in this world that can be formidable to such a degree!” Lin Chaotian said calmly.

The few Dao Ancestors looked over in earnest and discovered that it was indeed as Lin Chaotian said. Ye Yuan’s divine essence was incomparably solid and vigorous.

Even Lin Huan, this level of power, was also eclipsed in front of Ye Yuan.

Although his aura was strong, the divine essence undulation was like a pile of loose sand in front of Ye Yuan!

A pile of sand and a wall!

This was the difference between the two person’s divine essence!

With such divine essence strength coupled with terrifying laws of time and space, it was really like mauling vegetables for Ye Yuan to deal with the Deva Third Blight Lin Lang.

“Sword, come!”

Ye Yuan called lightly, there was an undulation in space, and a light sword condensed in Ye Yuan’s hand.

The cold air was oppressive!

Breaking through to the realm of Creation, the power of the Sword of Spacetime was no longer comparable to when he was in World Realm.

A Dao artifact at full firepower, coupled with the Sword of Spacetime with its power multiplied, this was Ye Yuan’s powerful reliance!

Everyone was taken in by Ye Yuan’s astonishing imposing momentum.

No one could have thought that the Ye Yuan who just entered Deva Realm, could be so powerful.

The smile on Lin Huan’s face vanished bit by bit.

What replaced it was a hint of seriousness.

Indeed, this sword of Ye Yuan’s was not enough to kill him.

But a moment of carelessness, harming him could still be accomplished!

At this time, Lin Huan could not help regretting it a little. He felt that he was too careless.

It was just that how could he have thought that a mere junior who just entered Deva Realm could actually unleash such powerful undulations?

Ye Yuan arced the bow, notched the sword, and said coolly, “You seem to be a little scared? Give yourself two slaps, admit your fault, this saint can take it as nothing happened.”

Lin Huan’s expression changed slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “What a joke! Would I be scared of you? Bring it on!”

Done talking, the divine essence on Lin Huan’s body surged crazily.

Wood-attribute law erupted crazily on his body.

A powerful lifeforce power, as well as world domain, surrounded Lin Huan tightly.

He gave a loud roar, “Bring it!”

Everyone stared at this scene wide-eyed and tongue-tied. No one could have thought that Ye Yuan actually forced out Lin Huan’s full strength!

A Deva Fifth Blight defending at full power, what kind of terrifying defensive power was that?

At this time, they felt as if a huge mountain was lying in front of Lin Huan.

Wanting to break this enormous mountain and injure Lin Huan’s body itself, that was simply a joke.

Ye Yuan gave a light laugh and said, “Looks like you’re ready. Then, I’m coming!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan’s feet strode across the air, the bowstring was gradually pulled to a bend.

Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum became stronger and stronger!

Drawing a bow was gaining momentum to begin with.

When the bowstring was pulled fully, it would be when the arrow’s momentum was accumulated fully.

However, before this, Ye Yuan had never drawn the Limitless God Killing Bow fully before.

An astonishing aura rose up!

Even if Lin Huan had already made sufficient preparations, he also felt tremendous oppression at this time.

Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum was still rising.

Finally, the bowstring and bow body formed a perfect arc.

A full bow!

It was Ye Yuan’s first time drawing the Limitless God Killing Bow fully!

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan’s fingertip released lightly; the Sword of Spacetime directly disappeared.

Space was like a piece of paper, directly having a gap cut open.

This sword was too sharp!

Boom!

The void trembled. In virtually an instant, the Sword of Spacetime matched up against Lin Huan’s defense.

Lin Huan trembled all over, his figure involuntarily going backward.

One step, two steps, three steps ... a hundred steps!

The Sword of Spacetime plunged directly into Lin Huan’s world domain, suppressing his domain and wood-attribute law to the extreme.

“Power of Wood Spirit, birth!”

Lin Huan let out a loud roar. Rows of giant trees were born out of thin air, directly breaking out of the ground, rising up, and blocking in front of him.

It was just that in front of spacetime, these giant trees seemed like paper paste.

The giant trees kept growing non-stop, constantly neutralizing the impact of the Sword of Spacetime.

Lin Huan’s footsteps were still falling back!

Finally, when he fell back to a thousand steps, the Sword of Spacetime dissipated with a loud bang.

It was already a mess in front of the entire mountain pass gates.

The people who were watching the battle in secret were long already dumbstruck with amazement.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan could actually force the Deva Fifth Blight Lin Huan to such an extent!

Although it was only a brief instant just now, Lin Huan already achieved the ultimate defense.

Ye Yuan could actually rely on the power of one word and force a Deva Fifth Blight powerhouse to retreat a thousand steps.

This level of strength was simply terrifying!

“Is ... Is this the strength of Saint Azure? T-Too terrifying!”

“That’s the legendary Sword of Spacetime! Being swordless beats having a sword! Truly a stunning sword!”

“Saint Azure just entered Deva Realm and already has such combat power. If his wings are fully plumed up, why fear the divine race?”

... ...

In the dark, came a series of exclamations.
