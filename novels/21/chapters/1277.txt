Chapter 1281: Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Wildly arrogant!”

“Ignorant!”

Kunwu and Dustless virtually said it in unison.

This kind of word could only be spoken by ignorant people.

In the Heavenspan World, gifted powerhouses would boast exaggeratedly, saying that they could achieve Heavenly Empyrean, even Heavenly Emperor.

But, even for Heavenly Emperors, they also never dared to blow this kind of trumpet, about becoming a Dao Ancestor!

Ye Yuan’s gaze was an unprecedented firm, and he said lightly, “Ignorant is fine as well! Wildly arrogant also works! In this life, if I can’t save Lingxue, I’m willing to sink into depravity for all ages!”

Kunwu’s emotions finally calmed down a little. He was indeed given a fright by Ye Yuan’s words earlier.

Because in the Heavenspan World, Dao Ancestor this realm was more like a totem.

The ones active in front of the public were only Heavenly Emperors and Heavenly Empyreans.

But at this time, Kunwu still felt Ye Yuan’s powerful determination.

The resolve to put everything on the line to save his beloved!

“Forget it, you humans’ feelings, I’m unable to understand. Since you want to seek death, then I’ll tell you! The key to unlocking the World Locking Gate are the Four Symbols Spirits!” Kunwu said and heaved a sigh.

Ye Yuan was stunned. Only then did he understand the objective of Kanuo capturing the spirit of the white tiger back then. It was actually to unlock the World Locking Gate!

This way, back then when the dragon clan’s old patriarch brought the Sacred Dragon Token and left the dragon clan, as well as Long Zhan’s departure, it was probably all related to the World Locking Gate.

It was just that, don’t know if they passed through the turbulent spatial flow or not.

“Many thanks for Senior’s guidance! This junior still has some matters to deal with, and will take my leave first!”

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, returning to the dragon clan’s sky once more.

Kanuo was still in Ye Yuan’s imprisonment.

Ye Yuan did not say a word and directly nailed a Soul Locking Nail onto Kanuo’s body.

“HOWWLLL!”

A scream that sounded like ghosts wailing and wolves howling reverberated throughout heaven and earth, making everyone get goosebumps.

“No idea where Heaven Surmounting Divine King went to previously either. But his mood seems to be a lot better.”

“The Spirit Snow Divine King is gone. Maybe the Heaven Surmounting Divine King really has a way to save her! Sigh, hope that the Spirit Snow Divine King is fine.”

“No matter what, that Kanuo is dead for sure. Now, it’s time for him to suffer the wrath of the Heaven Surmounting Divine King!”

...

Ye Yuan did not say anything at all. He just nailed one Soul Locking Nail after another onto that cloud of black gas.

These Soul Locking Nails were all pulled off from Mu Lingxue’s body.

This cloud of black gas was similar to the fiend race’s divine soul. It was just that this kind of divine soul was exceedingly difficult to be killed.

Even though Kanuo was already very weak currently, these Soul Locking Nails still could not kill Kanuo.

However, it was plenty to make him wish he was dead.

“The pain that Lingxue suffered, I hope that you can savor it well for a bit,” Ye Yuan took his time and said.

Ye Yuan could maneuver the power of Heavenly Dao. Wanting to kill Kanuo was seriously too easy.

But how could killing him directly vent the hatred in his heart?

At present, the human race’s territory was virtually already a piece of scorched earth.

The humans who died in this war numbered more than billions.

All of these were caused by Kanuo single-handedly!

Including the grudge of murdering his father, Mu Lingxue on the brink of death was also Kanuo’s ‘meritorious deed.’

Ye Yuan’s killing intent towards him could practically burst through the clouds.

If Kanuo had ten thousand lives, Ye Yuan would definitely kill him ten thousand times!

“Ahh! Ye Yuan, spare me! I ... I can’t take it anymore! Ahh ...”

Kanuo howled like a pig being slaughtered and finally could not bear it anymore, opening his mouth and begging Ye Yuan for mercy.

Ye Yuan’s eyes were cold. Toward Kanuo, he only had a monstrous hatred, without a shred of compassion.

“The pain that you suffered is not yet one ten-thousandth of Lingxue’s, just this and you can’t stand it already? Rest assured, this is just the beginning. Before I leave the Immortal Grove Region, I’ll make you experience what is called true despair!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

Ye Yuan researched greatly into the divine soul path in the first place. Regarding methods of torturing people, he could be said to have it at his fingertips.

Now, he stepped into the Deity Realm and took control of Heavenly Dao. Dealing with Kanuo, he could switch things up and play for as long as several years.

It was just that normally, facing the enemy, he was disdainful to do so, that was all.

But toward Kanuo, it was an exception!

The crimes that Kanuo committed were too numerous to be recorded.

He must suffer endless agony and die.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, that cloud of black gas gave off a tremble, terrified to the extreme.

“Ye Yuan, I ... I was wrong! I really know that I was wrong! Ahhh ...”

“Since you know that you were wrong, then you have to make atonement. Now ... is the time where you atone for your crimes.” Ye Yuan said lightly.

“You ... You ... You’ll die a horrible death! Do you think that by breaking through to the Deity Realm, you can pass through the turbulent spatial flow? Ahh, ahhh ... You’re alone. It ... it’s impossible to pass through the turbulent spatial flow! You’re dead for sure! Ahh, ahhh ...” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“That I don’t need you to worry about. Before that, you’d definitely be dead already!”

Ye Yuan lightly threw down a sentence, but turned around and walked to another place, leaving Kanuo there howling miserably.

He already set up various means, taking turns one by one, it would make Kanuo ecstatic to the extreme until he wished he was dead.

Not far away from Kanuo, a beautiful woman was similarly shackled in the air.

This person was naturally Yue Ji.

Compared to Kanuo, Yue Ji’s treatment was much better. It was merely being imprisoned.

Seeing Ye Yuan walk in, a thick look of fear revealed in Yue Ji’s eyes.

She completely did not expect that this young man actually inherited this dilapidated world, taking control of Heavenly Dao!

Even if Ye Yuan really broke through to Deity Realm, by relying on the Fiendsource Bead, it was also not possible for Kanuo to be defeated so thoroughly.

But, under the Heavenly Dao, they did not have the least bit of strength to resist at all.

“Kanuo’s outcome, you saw it. Say the purpose of you guys coming here, I can give you all a quick death,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Under Ye Yuan’s means, they could not even commit suicide.

Hence, granting Yue Ji death was already the greatest grace to her.

That extremely pitiful voice of Kanuo’s still entered Yue Ji’s ears repeatedly.

Yue Ji’s face changed, falling silent.

Ye Yuan did not urge either, quietly waiting for Yue Ji to open her mouth.

He knew that Yue Ji would definitely capitulate.

Sure enough, before long, Yue Ji opened her mouth.

“We’re here for those two empyrean spirit treasures in your hands. Of course, we were even planning on cultivating a demonic skill with the help of the living creatures here, and break through to the Divine Lord Realm!” Yue Ji said.

When saying these, she secretly looked to size up Ye Yuan, fearful that he would suddenly rampage.

However, Ye Yuan did not reveal any expression on his face. She could not guess what Ye Yuan was thinking at all.

“Who sent you all here?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Yue Ji’s gaze turned intent, and she said, “It ... It was Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang!”

The expression on Ye Yuan’s face finally had a hint of change.

He never would have thought that behind Kanuo and Yue Ji, was actually a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, that was a powerhouse at the very apex of the Heavenspan World.

Originally, Ye Yuan was still planning on finding their main instigator behind the scenes. After he cultivated to a certain realm, he would then take revenge.

Looks like now, he had to give the matter further considerations.

“There’s enmity between Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang?” Ye Yuan asked again.
