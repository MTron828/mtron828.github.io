Chapter 2830: It’s So-so!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Tech!”

Lotuswear cried out delicately, a red light flashing on her dainty finger.

A terrifying force directly exploded in the air. Dan Fei, who was her opponent, was directly blown away.

Dan Fei vomited blood from his mouth. There was not an unblemished spot on his body from head to toe.

Facing a powerhouse like Lotuswear, he unleashed all of his abilities and was unable to gain any upper hand too.

“This seat knows your plan. You’re very hardworking, but just based on your strength, you can’t tie this seat down!” Lotuswear looked at Dan Fei, her words carrying a faint mockery.

She naturally knew about Dan Fei’s plans. It was just that since she came, there was no more hope for the Heaven One Alliance.

Dan Fei already used his final ultimate move, but he was still not Lotuswear’s match.

Li He was freed up. Zuo Chen and Lu Feng joined hands before they barely managed to resist him.

As for the rest, that went even more without saying.

The Heaven One Alliance’s Emperor Realm powerhouses had all fallen into a crisis.

In less than a moment after Dan Fei dies, Lotuswear would be free, and it would be even more hopeless for the others.

Dan Fei had a decisive look, and he said coolly, “It’s only death!”

Finished saying, he ignored the injuries on his body and broke through in the direction of the spatial passageway again.

His goal was not to kill Lotuswear. It was just to destroy the spatial passageway.

Unfortunately, he was unable to get past Lotuswear.

Suddenly, his figure stopped. Lotuswear also frowned slightly and said, “Mn? There’s a fish that escaped the net? Bloodspirit, this fellow, is really a good-for-nothing!”

Dan Fei’s heart stirred, knowing that it was Ye Yuan who rushed over!

Emperor Realm powerhouses could sense heaven and earth. Their divine sense covered an extremely vast radius.

The moment Ye Yuan came over, they discovered it.

Dan Fei roused himself, undoubtedly seeing hope amidst despair.

Seeing Dan Fei’s appearance, Lotuswear said disdainfully, “Are you thinking too much? A measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, even if he reaches the spatial passageway there, what can he do? Moreover, this seat has already sensed that Lord May is already not far from the entrance of the passageway!”

Dan Fei’s brows furrowed slightly. This was not good news!

‘Once May arrived, even if Ye Yuan had the ability to access the highest heavens, there was only death too! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Seeing the change in Dan Fei’s expression, Lotuswear said with a light smile, “Looks like you still harbored some hope in this little fellow. Forget it. This seat will end him and completely cut off your hope!”

Dan Fei’s expression changed wildly, but it was already too late!

Lotuswear attacked right away. She just flicked her fingers. A shocking force tore across the sky and flew straight for Ye Yuan.

Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses, even if it was just a casual strike, obliterating a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven did not take any effort at all too.

Dan Fei did not hesitate in the slightest, throwing a palm out fiercely. A similarly terrifying force flew out swiftly, wanting to intercept Lotuswear’s force.

Lotuswear did not stop it either, smilingly slightly. She said, “It’s no use. A measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven is no different from a mosquito. Even if you intercept it, the aftershock is sufficient to kill him several times over too!”

Boom!

Her voice had yet to fade when a loud boom came over from the horizon.

‘The terrifying energy undulation was seemingly like fireworks, exploding until all the spiritual energy in the sky was shaking incessantly.

“Lotuswear, you!”

Dan Fei was furious to the extreme. The hope that he just saw was throttled just like this!

He understood that no matter how heaven-defying the Saint Sovereign Heaven, it was also impossible to survive under this kind of aftershock.

“Hehe, alittle interesting. You’re very furious. It looks like you really cared about that Saint Sovereign Heaven little fellow. Now, do you feel very despaired?” Lotuswear had a rare laugh as she said.

Seeing her opponent’s despair gave her a great sense of accomplishment.

Not just Dan Fei, the other Heaven One Emperor Realms’ faces all had looks of despair.

It looked like this little fellow was indeed somewhat different from the rest.

However, there was already no point.

Suddenly, Lotuswear’s expression changed, and she cried out in surprise, “Mn? Not dead? How is this possible?”

Ye Yuan’s aura that had just disappeared actually reappeared after it disappeared!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s aura was already very close to the spatial passageway.

Such swift speed!

Ahint of wild elation appeared on Dan Fei’s face.

“Terrific lad, you’re great!”

Reaching the Emperor Realm, Dan Fei no longer had joy nor sorrow a long time ago.

But at this time, he really wished to clap his hands in joy!

He looked at the surprised expression on Lotuswear’s face and felt great!

Previously, he did not take Ye Yuan’s plan seriously at all.

But now, Ye Yuan was already his, the Heaven One Alliance’s last hope!

Lotuswear gave a cold snort, her figure moving and about to rush toward Ye Yuan. But, how could Dan Fei be willing to comply?

His figure moved, stopping Lotuswear.

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, the two people fought together once more!

Far away, Ye Yuan looked across the sky with lingering fear in his heart too.

‘That wave of energy undulation just now was too terrifying. Luckily, he utilized spatial rule in advance to escape by cunning maneuvering, escaping this calamity.

For Ye Yuan to dare pat his chest and say that he could destroy the spatial passageway, he was naturally not boating.

In reality, there were really not many in the 33 Heavens who could match up to Mi Tian in terms of spatial attainments.

Mi Tian was born from chaos. The moment he was born, he was Hegemon Realm!

At his prime, he had once cultivated spatial rule to the realm of grand completion, soaring to the sky and tunneling underground. He was capable of doing anything!

Destroying the spatial passageway was as difficult as ascending to heaven to others. But to him, it was as easy as turning his hand over.

He imparted Ye Yuan a few spatial secret arts. It was to be used to destroy the spatial passageway.

‘These few spatial secret arts were extremely profound. It was equivalent to analyzing spatial rule in-depth.

If the average person learned it, it would be hard to achieve results without hundreds of years of hard work.

However, Ye Yuan was similarly amazingly talented in the path of space. So learning it yielded twice the results with half the effort.

This move earlier was called transfiguring teleportation. He could directly open up a spatial passageway within a certain radius, achieving the effect of instantaneous shifting.

Ye Yuan studied and applied it with full vigor, avoiding Lotuswear’s blow nimbly.

In front of him was an enormous spatial door, perched above the sea.

Ye Yuan had long sensed its existence. It was just that when he arrived before it, he was still shocked by it.

Clearly, the person who opened up the spatial passageway had extremely terrifying strength!

Ye Yuan’s transfiguring teleportation only opened up a spatial passageway within a short distance. But, this person opened up a large-scale spatial passageway from outside of the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

When comparing the two, it was simply like an apprentice meeting a great sorcerer!

However, although the other party had exceedingly formidable abilities, the application of spatial rule was similar.

Just like how machine computations were extremely complicated, but in the end, it was merely ones and zeros.

As long as he knew that computational rules, he could always analyze them.

Of course, speaking of it was easy, but it was still too difficult for Ye Yuan.

But this was not an issue. Ye Yuan did not understand, but Mi Tian this hegemon understood it!

“How is it, Senior?” Ye Yuan asked.

“It’s so-so!”

Mi Tian said disdainfully, “This blood race Hegemon Realm’s understanding of spatial rule is also just the degree of superficial knowledge. If it was me, your Heaven One won’t have any chance to turn the tables at all!”

‘These words sounded arrogant, but Ye Yuan knew that Mi Tian was not bragging.

‘The spatial rule that he explained to Ye Yuan, that really cut with penetrating criticism. Even Ye Yuan also lamented at his inadequacy!

Since he said that it was so-so, then it was really so-so!
