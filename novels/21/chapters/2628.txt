Chapter 2634: Eruption! Hidden Worries!

Concerning the Primordial Star Astral Pill, being a grade two heavenly imperial pill, the medicinal effect was comparable to grade three heavenly pills!

A powerful heavenly pill that consolidated the small world and consolidated one’s cultivation realm.

Duan Yongchun was extremely talented, but his three grandsons had average aptitudes.

At present, these three people were all stuck at peak Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, and have been unable to break through.

True grade Primordial Star Astral Pill was simply a panacea to the three of them.

Duan Yongchun did not know how strong the medicinal effect of true grade was, but without a doubt, it would be unbelievably strong!

Therefore, when he heard that true grade Primordial Star Astral Pill, the self-slapping law activated.

He knew that when he said it at this time, it slapped his own face very hard.

But for the sake of his three grandsons, he was risking it all.

Sure enough, Yang Jie looked at Duan Yongchun with a smile that was not a smile and said smugly, “Elder Duan, didn’t you say earlier that you won’t take a single one no matter what?”

Duan Yongchun’s old face turned red, and he said, “Ye Yuan this boy really mustered up a big move! I also didn’t expect that he actually took out so many true grade heavenly pills all at once!”

Yang Jie nodded slightly, expressing agreement.

In reality, he was shocked by this list too.

Taking out several hundred true grade heavenly pills in one go, this was absolutely a big move.

Although these heavenly pills had little effect on Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, even Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, they held extraordinary significance.

This batch of heavenly pills could definitely create a large batch of powerhouses.

The world knew that Ye Yuan could refine true grade heavenly pills.

It was just that, the true grade that Ye Yuan refined back then was also just the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, this sort of basic heavenly pill.

There was still a huge gap from wanting to refine heavenly imperial pills to true grade.

However, they all did not expect that in a short 20 years, Ye Yuan’s improvement would actually be so big!

“In that case, you don’t have objections about the Pill Pavilion anymore?” Yang Jie said with a serious face.

Duan Yongchun chuckled and said, “No objections! Of course, no objections! That, Elder Qu, you have to buck up too!”

Qu Yan smiled and said, “Elder Duan, don’t panic. This old man also has some gifts here!”

The moment these words came out, Duan Yongchun and Yang Jie were both surprised.

As he said, Qu Yan also took out a list and passed it to Yang Jie.

After Yang Jie looked, he could not help turning pale from shock and said, “Elder Qu, these … these heavenly pills are all refined by you?”

Qu Yan nodded and said, “These few years, under Master Ye’s guidance, this old man’s strength had great advancements! Especially these two years, it even reached an eruption period!”

The heavenly pills on the list were all grade four heavenly pills. Furthermore, the quality was very high.

Although there was still a gap compared to the Pill Alliance’s grade four heavenly pills, the difference was already not big anymore.

After all, it was also impossible for the grade four heavenly pills that the Pill Alliance took out to sell to be the best. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At the rate of this progress, Qu Yan surpassing the Pill Alliance’s grade four heavenly pills within ten years could be easily accomplished!

Duan Yongchun opened his mouth wide, having a look of shock on his face.

Honestly speaking, he completely did not believe that Ye Yuan made Qu Yan’s strength reach this level within 30 years.

Grade four heavenly alchemists were not grade one heavenly alchemists, the latter having very obvious improvements if any.

Without the accumulation of time, how could wanting to improve be so easy?

It was just that he never thought that he was still questioning just now and Qu Yan already returned to slap his face.

Yang Jie even noticed that Qu Yan’s term of address for Ye Yuan already underwent a change.

A grade four heavenly alchemist actually called Ye Yuan as Master Ye, it could be seen that Qu Yan was really prostrating on all fours in admiration towards Ye Yuan!

Terrifying!

Seemingly seeing through the two people’s surprise, Qu Yan smiled and said, “Sect Master, Elder Duan, you guys rest assured. With the Pill Pavilion’s current strength, we’ll be able to stand up to the Pill Alliance as an equal before long! And currently, we completely don’t need to rely on the Pill Alliance anymore. In the future, when Master Ye breaks through to grade three heavenly alchemist, even grade four heavenly alchemist, a mere Pill Alliance will probably be merely thus too!”

These 20 years, Qu Yang had long already been brought into submission by Ye Yuan’s monstrousness.

In reality, after learning about Ye Yuan’s cultivation method, Qu Yan’s sense of mysteriousness toward Ye Yuan immediately reduced a lot.

After all, hard work this sort of thing was what anyone could do.

Even Wu Chengchao could reach that step. So it was naturally not a problem for him, Qu Yan.

But along with the passage of time, he discovered that it was not the case at all.

This cultivation path was easy to learn but hard to master!

Just like when he refined grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, he could reach grand completion ninth grade very quickly.

But, ninth grade perfection, he spent a tremendous amount of effort and had never been able to reach it.

Only at that time did Qu Yan know what kind of gap was there.

He could not even reach ninth grade perfection, let alone talk about true grade.

All the way until Ye Yuan came out of seclusion this time and took out a bunch of true grade heavenly pills, the Pill Pavilion was thoroughly stirred.

True grade was already not something that was far beyond reach to Ye Yuan.

Qu Yan thought that he could catch up to, even surpass Ye Yuan very quickly.

But 20 years had passed. Qu Yan understood that not only did he not surpass Ye Yuan, but he also opened up an even greater distance instead.

“Good! Good! Good!”

Yang Jie said three ‘good’s in a row and exclaimed, “Looks like us five sect masters didn’t misjudge him! The pleasant surprise that this kid gave to us is even bigger than imagined! Since even Elder Duan isn’t objecting, our Myriad Manifestation Heavenly Sect’s disciples will support the four sects from now on!”

… …

The heavenly pills outputted by the Pill Pavilion completely exploded!

For some of the five great heavenly sects’ core forces, their strength and combat power soared after taking the true grade heavenly pills.

Without any surprises, their combat power on the battlefield also increased crazily.

The strength of ascenders stood head and shoulders above all others to begin with. Now, with the help of true grade heavenly pills, they overwhelmed native powerhouses even more.

On the frontline battlefield, the four great heavenly regions steadily lost ground.

The morale of the Five Light Heavenly Region’s five great heavenly sects was unprecedentedly high.

Only at this time did people realize what a wise thing it was to decide to set up the Pill Pavilion back then.

But in the Pill Pavilion Ye Yuan’s brows were knitted tightly together.

When Feng Xuanyi saw his expression, he could not help being very puzzled and asked, “Ye Yuan, we’ve won a complete victory presently and killed the five great heavenly regions until they are filled with trepidation. The name of Pill Pavilion has also shocked the Five Great Heavenly Regions. Why are you still frowning like this?”

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Sect Master, you’ve witnessed the power of true grade too, right?”

Upon mentioning this, Feng Xuanyi immediately perked up and said with a smile, “Of course! True grade heavenly pills are truly remarkable! The strength of many of the five great heavenly sects’ Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratums soared after consuming your heavenly imperial pills! And they were also the main force of the great battle this time!”

True grade heavenly pill was not just increasing strength, being that simple.

Its improvement of ascenders was all-around!

That was equivalent to integrating Dao rule into the martial artist’s body.

This kind of power was unimaginable.

When Feng Xuanyi saw the power of true grade, he was incredibly moved too.

After Ye Yuan broke through in the future, he also had to sample the taste of this true grade heavenly pill!

But Ye Yuan was not as optimistic as Feng Xuanyi and said in a solemn voice, “Our five great heavenly sects’ disciples have soared in strength within a few short months! But, the Pill Alliance has possessed true grade heavenly pills for a long time! Then how strong is the strength of the Pill Alliance’s powerhouses? And how strong is the strength of the Pill Alliance’s leader?”

One sentence made Feng Xuanyi’s expression change suddenly!
