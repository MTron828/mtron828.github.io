Chapter 2909: Identifying Family in Another World

“That … seems like the true dragon clan’s Wandering the Divine Space, right? This kid actually even learned such a secret art!” Divine Lord saw through Ye Yuan’s secret art with one glance and was extremely shocked.

“It’s actually Wandering the Divine Space! Legends have it that when this secret art travels through the void, it will meet with no resistance as if entering an unpopulated land! Upon seeing it today, it’s indeed extraordinary!” Hegemon Blacksun said in shock.

“Heard that this secret art can only be grasped by chaos true dragons! This boy is just True Sovereign Heaven. His bloodline is already powerful to such a degree?”

… …

Seeing Ye Yuan tear across space, each and every one of the Hegemons was dumbfounded with amazement.

It was truly that this secret art was too miraculous.

Chaos true dragon, even among Hegemons, it was an extremely powerful existence too.

And Wandering the Divine Space, even Hegemon Realms were incredibly envious too.

With this secret art, one could travel to and fro freely between the various heavens!

Originally, Ye Yuan was unable to cultivate this secret art. But, after draining the blood pool twice and also having obtained the origin of blood, this greatly strengthened Ye Yuan’s bloodline power.

Following that, this Wandering the Divine Space was also successfully cultivated.

Of course, this kind of success naturally could not compare to Mi Tian’s style back then.

But, with Hegemon Cloudmount’s help, it was enough.

Seeing this bunch of Hegemons’ shocked appearances, Hegemon Cloudmount felt the delight of having taken revenge!

Your Father’s disciple is amazing!

You all, this bunch of fellows, I’ll take care of you all sooner or later!

… …

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan landed in a large hall with a look of surprise.

Within the great hall, a group of people seemed to be currently paying homage, and he rashly barged inside just like that.

The group of people also looked toward him with baffled faces.

Where did this guy pop out from?

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept over the hall. This place was an empty cave that was opened up into a great hall by someone.

Above the great hall, there was just a giant statue that was enshrined, looking valiant and thriving, with an imposing appearance.

This statue’s face was actually somewhat blurry.

However, Ye Yuan still felt that this statue looked somewhat familiar!

“Bloodkin! Kill!”

The powerhouses in the great hall finally reacted.

Following that, it was a frenzied killing intent!

The group of powerhouses rushed over indiscriminately.

The bloody aura on Ye Yuan’s body was too thick. It could not help from the people’s eyes and ears at all.

The strength of the cultivators in the hall was not weak. The strongest was a lower Emperor Cloud Heaven!

Just now, this roar was given off by him.

Apart from this Emperor Cloud Heaven, there were still many True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses in the great hall.

It could be seen that the strength of this sect was not weak.

Ye Yuan currently had a lot of means, but Sovereign Realm to Emperor Realm was a huge threshold, he was currently far from being an Emperor Realm powerhouse’s match.

Even if it was a lower Emperor Cloud Heaven.

Ye Yuan also did not expect that he would encounter such danger the moment he came out of the barrier of heavens.

This sect was clearly extremely hostile to the blood race. At this time, the pressure of Emperor Realm was fully released, rushing toward Ye Yuan crazily.

The other True Sovereign Heavens also followed closely behind, cutting off all of Ye Yuan’s escape routes.

Behind him, the barrier of heavens had already recovered. Ye Yuan entered a wolf den all of a sudden, with no path of retreat at all.

Ye Yuan felt his scalp tingle. Suddenly, his eyes landed on the statue and a flash of inspiration came to him. He yelled loudly, “Hang Yang!”

This yell was indeed useful!

That Emperor Cloud Heaven’s figure stopped, looking at Ye Yuan uncertainly as he said, “You should have came out of the barrier of heavens. Why would you know Ancestor’s name?”

Ye Yuan secretly let out a sigh in relief, thinking to himself that Old Man Cloudmount saved his life!

Of course, the danger had not passed yet.

If the bloody aura on his body could not be explained clearly, it would likely still be death.

Ye Yuan looked at that Emperor Cloud Heaven and said, “Hang Yang is your ancestor, then this place is still the Sublime Pill Sect?”

The Emperor Cloud Heaven’s suspicions grew stronger, and he said with a nod, “That’s right!”

“Sect Master, what are you being long-winded with this bloodkin for? Ancestor Hang Yang died at the hands of the blood race. Let’s kill him and avenge Ancestor!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“These few years, how many people from of our Sublime Pill Sect had been killed by the blood race? Sect Master, stop talking crap with him!”

“Kill him!”

… …

Ye Yuan’s appearance made these people burn with rage.

These also let Ye Yuan realize that most likely, the blood race was already wreaking havoc in Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven too!

But the sect master waved his hand and said, “Let him finish speaking!”

Seeing the sect master’s attitude, Ye Yuan’s heart calmed down significantly.

The moment he came out, he felt that this status looked very familiar.

At that time, he had not reacted to it yet. But, he suddenly recalled that before coming, Hegemon Cloudmount told him that he came to Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven 70 thousand years ago to travel. When he just came out of the barrier of heavens, he had once casually given pointers to a youth before.

That youth was Hang Yang.

The Sublime Pill Sect back then, the strongest person was merely Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum. It was unbelievably weak.

The Hang Yang back then was even just Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum Realm. He was also an outcast in the sect.

However, this Hang Yang was extremely diligent, hiding in this cave alone and practicing superfluous Dao techniques.

Hegemon Cloudmount had his interest aroused and casually gave Hang Yang some pointers.

What kind of existence was Hegemon Cloudmount? To a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, his casual giving of pointers was enough to benefit for life.

However, a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum was just an ant-like existence to a Hegemon Realm.

Hegemon Cloudmount naturally would not waste much time on him.

He stayed in the Sublime Pill Sect for five days, then directly left.

The events afterward, Cloudmount could not be bothered to care at all.

Before coming, Hegemon Cloudmount covered all details no matter how trivial, telling Ye Yuan about everything that he had seen and heard in Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan reacted quickly. Otherwise, he would already be dead.

As for this statue, it was actually greatly different from Cloudmount, so Ye Yuan did not recognize it for some time too.

A Lesser Sublime Hegemon Realm, even if a Hegemon Realm was standing in front of him, he could not see his features clearly either.

What Hang Yang saw was just a blur.

In reality, if Hegemon Cloudmount did not do it deliberately, even Ye Yuan would not be able to see his appearance clearly too.

This level of existence, every movement and action was Dao!

Not reaching Emperor Realm, one would not be able to see anything at all!

Clearly, just five days of guidance, but Hang Yang forged a path that led to heaven, letting a puny little Sublime Pill Sect become a major sect.

Judging from the sect master’s attitude, he knew some things.

Ye Yuan looked at the sect master, casually took out the Treasured Glass Tobacco Pouch, and said, “Since you know something, then you should know about this, right?”

The sect master’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “This … This is impossible! How can you have this tobacco pouch?”

Actually, Hang Yang’s strongest impression of Cloudmount was when he was smoking his tobacco pouch.

At that moment, Cloudmount was akin to a god from heaven; blasphemy was not tolerated.

Only all the way until many years later did he know what kind of existence Cloudmount was.

However, Cloudmount’s scene of smoking the tobacco pouch could not be sculptured even when Hang Yang was at his prime.

This statue did not have a tobacco pouch, but he replicated a tobacco pouch in addition, to pay homage.

The sect master knew about this.

The Treasured Glass Tobacco Pouch in Ye Yuan’s hand was identical with what Hang Yang replicated!

Therefore, the sect master was shocked!

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a sigh, “If my guesses are correct, Hang Yang … should be considered my senior apprentice brother!”
