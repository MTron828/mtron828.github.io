Chapter 2926: Slight Imperfection in an Otherwise Flawless Thing

“C-Cleared the stage.”

There were no heaven-shocking exclamations; there was only blankness.

Until now, they still did not dare to believe it.

Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall never had anyone who cleared the stage before.

Today, it was broken!

No one thought that the tortoise-like Ye Yuan actually created a myth in the end!

Cleared the stage!

“This is clearing the stage! He … How did he do it?”

“Still said that it was accidental … can this guy not be so demoralizing!”

“Just now, I still felt that Qin Shitian was unbelievably impressive. But, compared to Ye Yuan, he’s not even dregs!”

“Being able to witness a stage clear with my own eyes, I haven’t lived my life in vain!”

… …

All of a sudden, the crowd exploded!

Soul Controlling Avenue’s stage clear was a legendary grand occasion!

Some people were even agitated until they shed tears.

Witnessing the birth of a miracle was indeed a kind of honor too.

This matter could be boasted for life.

The embarrassment from before no longer existed a long time ago.

What was there to be embarrassed about?

Many examinees already treated Ye Yuan as an idol, prostrating on all fours in idolization.

People were like this. When your strength was more or less the same as him, they would be envious and would be jealous.

But, when you reached a height that was lofty and out of reach, there was no longer such a thing.

There was only admiration remaining!

Great Emperor Eastsun took a look at Ye Yuan, then looked at Qin Shitian, and let out a long sigh.

When the latter felt this gaze, he was ashamed and resentful until he wanted to die.

However glorious he was a moment ago, it was how embarrassing it was now.

All of his glory served as a foil to Ye Yuan’s glory.

To a genius, nothing was more demoralizing than this.

“Westdawn, if I didn’t remember wrongly, in the last 30 thousand years, there was only Hegemon Heaven Subduer one person who cleared the stage, right?” Great Emperor Eastsun suddenly said.

/

Great Emperor Westdawn said rather excitedly, “That’s right! Wu Yu Nirvana Soul Hall also became one of the ten great Nirvana Soul Halls based on this! I didn’t expect that we produced one too!”

But Great Emperor Eastsun let out a sigh and said, “How unfortunate. He’s merely nine wroughts when he made it through the tenth segment. Compared to Hegemon Heaven Subduer, he’s still much worse!”

Westdawn said, “Yeah, when Hegemon Heaven Subduer cleared the Soul Controlling Avenue back then, he achieved the Heaven Tyrant Soul Physique with ten wroughts! Later, he relied on the Heaven Tyrant Soul Physique and roamed the world unhindered, becoming a Hegemon! Ye Yuan’s ultimately a level worse than him!”

“A discrepancy of a hair’s breadth could lead to an error of a thousand miles! Even if it’s nine wroughts, wanting to step into the Hegemon Realm is incredibly difficult too!” Eastsun said rather disappointedly.

Not entering Hegemon, they would at most be about the same as him.

Even if they were more formidable than him, they would just be an Emperor Sakra Heaven in the end. That was not a big deal.

Only by stepping into the Hegemon Realm would it be considered to have really leaped over the dragon gate, soaring to the heaven in one leap!

Therefore, even if Ye Yuan’s performance was extremely breathtaking, Great Emperor Eastsun was somewhat waning in interest too.

When everyone heard, they could not help being enlightened.

It turned out that there was still such a thing!

Qin Shitian finally regained a trace of confidence.

Isn’t there still the third stage?

Ye Yuan could do it, so he could also do the same!

Who said that I, Qin Shitian, could not go against the wind and perform a reversal?

On the Scarlet Drill Battlefield, he was originally very inconspicuous.

How many times he was snatched from the jaws of death, how many times was he in adverse circumstances, he did not shrink back.

This time, he absolutely would not too!

He, Qin Shitian, used his life to fight for today!

Thinking up to here, Qin Shitian suddenly knelt down to Eastsun and said, “Master, this third round, this disciple will definitely go against the wind and reverse the situation, regaining all that I’ve lost!”

Great Emperor Eastsun saw an incomparably strong determination in Qin Shitian’s eyes.

This kind of resolve was tempered in the Scarlet Drill Battlefield.

Qin Shitian was not beaten down by Ye Yuan!

On the contrary, Ye Yuan’s heaven-defying rise ignited his fighting spirit even more!

The corners of Great Emperor Eastsun’s mouth curled slightly, and he said with a faint smile, “Good, Master thinks very highly of you! Perhaps Ye Yuan’s appearance is a good thing to you!”

Qin Shitian’s entire body trembled, immediately understanding Great Emperor Eastsun’s meaning.

These few years, he had become somewhat egotistical!

Especially just now, he virtually had one leg into the seventh segment. His life seemed to have reached its peak.

But Ye Yuan’s appearance gave him a direct blow, knocking him awake!

The so-called being toughened and hardened into steel, Great Emperor Eastsun knew that someone like Qin Shitian might have even greater potential than Ye Yuan!

After all, they were just True Sovereign Heaven. Everything was possible!

At this time, Ye Yuan floated down. Many people cast worshiping gazes over.

However, they also knew that there was likely still a battle between Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian.

This fight would very likely determine the two people’s future!

Seeing Great Emperor Eastsun’s gratified gaze, everyone naturally would not think that he was shooting at random.

Hall Master’s gaze had always been very sharp.

It was naturally not without reason that he picked Qin Shitian at one glance among the Scarlet Drill Three Sons.

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of deliberately showing off. He cultivated the Divine Emergence. If he could not even clear the stage, he could find a piece of tofu to commit suicide with. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

There was no comparison between him and Qin Shitian at all, and he had never treated him as an opponent before either.

However, Qin Shitian clearly did not feel that way.

He already viewed Ye Yuan as his lifelong enemy.

Seeing Ye Yuan come over, Qin Shitian snorted coldly and said, “Ye Yuan, don’t you be smug! The victor hasn’t been decided between us yet! The third stage, Soul Refining Furnace, is where we’ll have our final showdown! This time, I’ll completely defeat you! And you’ll become the stepping stone on my path to Hegemon!”

Ye Yuan had a baffled look.?I did not even posture when I cleared the stage. What did you run here to posture for?

Who was going to determine the victor with you?

From start to you, it had always been you performing by yourself, alright?

“Oh, Hegemon? Then very impressive! Buck up!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Qin Shitian could not help choking as if his punch had landed on cotton.

If Ye Yuan went tit for tat with him, he would have even greater fighting spirit.

But what the hell was this?

… …

Soul Refining Furnace was a chaos heavenly treasure with boundless power!

Of course, the Soul Refining Furnace in the Nirvana Soul Hall was just a projection of it.

This third stage, Soul Refining Furnace, was for the soul denizen to enter it and receive the tempering of 7 by 7,49 kinds of Dao fires!

These 49 kinds of Dao fire, each one was stronger than the last!

Only by being able to make it through the test of seven Dao fires was it considered to have passed the round.

Same as before, this round was a test and also a lucky chance.

The tempering of Dao fire was extremely harmful to the soul body.

But true gold was not afraid of being refined by fire. Tempering revival amidst Dao fire was the greatest significance of this round.

Someone transformed into a butterfly in the soul refining furnace, rising from the ashes, reaching the peak.

After two rounds of assessment, there were only 97 people remaining in this third round!

After passing the third round, one would be considered a true Nirvana Soul Hall’s disciple.

But this third round was also the most dangerous.

This was because this round could not be backed out of!

One must experience seven Dao fires before the Soul Refining Furnace would open again, and the examinee could then only come out.

Either succeed or die trying!

“This seat reminds you all. The Dao fires in the Soul Refining Furnace aren’t average Dao fires! These seven by seven, 49 kinds of Dao fires, are all chaos fires! Our soul race expended a huge price before collecting them! Of course, the main bodies of these Dao fires are all in the real Soul Refining Furnace. But even so, you all can’t underestimate it either. Now, if you want to withdraw, you can still pull out! Otherwise, once you enter the Soul Refining Furnace, there’s only passing the test before you can come out!” Great Emperor Eastsun said coolly.
