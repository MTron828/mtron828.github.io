Chapter 2567: A Few Pieces of Jade Slips

“Lord Envoy, we’ve investigated Deacon Jun’s matter for many years and didn’t find any leads either. But Yuqin found a trace of a clue recently!” Eldest Prince said.

“Oh??Speak!” Cheng Chongshan said with a frown.

“Yuqin feels that Deacon Jun very likely died at Ye Yuan’s hands!” Eldest Prince’s words were shocking.

Cheng Chongshan was greatly interested and said, “What does this mean?”

Eldest Prince said, “When Deacon Jun died, it was precisely when Ye Yuan ascended! Furthermore, he ascended from Inklight Forest! Yuqin knows that these words are somewhat fantastical, but Ye Yuan this person has too many mysteries to begin with! Ever since coming to Eastward Country, he has done too many impossible things! If Deacon Jun was careless, dying at his hands is also not something impossible!”

Cheng Chongshan revealed a pondering look and fell silent.

Eastward’s general situation had settled, but Qiao Yuqin’s heart was not dead!

He had the intention of curry favor with Cheng Chongshan, but these people’s minds were not on this at all. Their movements and traces were elusive and secretive.

Eldest Prince had long already investigated Ye Yuan inside out and already knew everything about the events after Ye Yuan ascended like the back of his hand.

He discovered a coincidence that made him wildly ecstatic!

That was that Jun Tian’s death just happened to coincide with the time Ye Yuan ascended!

Hence, he wanted to speak to Cheng Chongshan, wanting to borrow Cheng Chongshan’s hand to take Ye Yuan down.

As long as Ye Yuan fell, his chance would come.

However, Cheng Chongshan and co. went deep into the ancient tomb and only returned recently.

Who would have expected that after the few people came back, they would be injured and poisoned?

Let alone did he expect that a conflict actually happened between Ye Yuan and the envoy!

Eldest Prince felt that this was simply a godsend opportunity!

As long as he informed Cheng Chongshan about this matter, there was no need for him to say anything at all. Cheng Chongshan would also help me remove this obstacle.

To Cheng Chongshan, whoever killed Jun Tian was not important.

What was important was that there was an explanation to the sect!

Of course, not anyone had this qualification to be the sacrificial lamb.

Anyhow capturing a random person back, how could the sect possibly believe that this was the murderer?

Saying it out, it would be hard to convince the public too!

Previously, the most suitable one was naturally Eastward emperor.

But now, it was Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan’s prestige in Eastward was too high!

It was even higher than the emperor’s!

If he became the murderer and Cheng Chongshan killed Ye Yuan, killing the chicken to warn the monkeys, it could naturally deter the frontiers!

Even a coincidence was also not as coincidental as this!

As for whether or not Ye Yuan was really the murderer, it was not important at all!

Very soon, Cheng Chongshan figured out the crux involved, a hint of a smile revealing at the corners of his mouth.

He looked at Eldest Prince and said smilingly, “Qiao Yuqin, you’re very smart and know what this envoy needs! This news of yours is indeed very useful to this envoy! What you want, this envoy will give to you too. But, what should be done in the future, it shouldn’t need me to say anymore, right?”

The moment Qiao Yuqin heard, he was overjoyed. He prostrated on the ground and said, “Yuqin is envoy’s man in the future. I’ll dash my brains on the ground and lay down my life if need be!”

Cheng Chongshan said, “However, this boy is adept in spatial rule. His movement technique is extremely strange. He is not easy to deal with! I’ll send a message back to the sect and request the sect to send experts over to capture this guy! As for this period of time, lay low for me!”

Qiao Yuqin was wildly elated and hurriedly said, “Envoy, rest assured. Yuqin will definitely act in a low-profile manner!”

… …

On this day, Cheng Chongshan brought his junior apprentice brother and junior apprentice sister, and carried a large number of gifts, and arrived at Nation Teacher Manor.

Along the way, it caused a great sensation.

People naturally did not know that Cheng Chongshan and Ye Yuan were on bad terms. They just knew that Ye Yuan was Eastward’s nation teacher.

Even Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s envoy had to visit in person and seek medical treatment from Nation Teacher.

This was too impressive! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Tsk tsk,?our Eastward Country is really impressive this time! Even the envoy has to pay a visit for medical treatment!”

“I heard that the few envoys are very arrogant. Even the emperor has to be cautious when he sees them. But in front of Nation Teacher, they still have to put aside their ego!”

“On that day, Envoy Cheng was inflicted with a fierce poison, poisoning hundreds of people along the way! In the end, it was still Nation Teacher whose miraculous skill restored life, curing him!”

… …

The residents of the impressive, awesome all felt proud when they saw their own nation teacher’s awesomeness.

Furthermore, ever since Ye Yuan took office as the nation teacher, Nation Teacher Manor’s door had changed from the cold pride in the past and had become closer to the people.

Anyone who was sick or had a disaster could come for consultation.

Of course, the vast majority of the illnesses did not reach Ye Yuan here. There was naturally Lin Lan, Jiang Yu, and the Tang Family managing it.

But there were also some troublesome issues that Ye Yuan personally took action to resolve.

Therefore, even though Ye Yuan had not served as the nation teacher for a long time, he was very much loved and respected among the people.

When Cheng Chongshan saw Ye Yuan, he smiled and clasped his hands as he said, “Brother Ye, do you think this Cheng’s sincerity this time is sufficient?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Ye doesn’t care about this undeserved reputation. Is there anything practical?”

Cheng Chongshan had a smile hanging on his face but had immense hatred in his heart.

But he also knew that not taking something out this time, he could not pass this hurdle.

Feeling helpless, he took out a few jade slips and passed them to Ye Yuan with both hands, saying, “These few jade slips were obtained by this Cheng in the ancient tomb this time. They were hidden in a secret place. This Cheng almost lost my life on the spot in order to obtain them. It’s just that there are extremely powerful restrictions on the jade slips. This Cheng can’t crack it either. But I think that they should be extremely valuable things!”

Ye Yuan received the jade slips and sunk his divine sense into it. Sure enough, it was blocked by a vast force.

This restriction power was extremely strong, being unfathomable.

Most likely, the information inside was extremely important.

Ye Yuan naturally knew Cheng Chongshan’s thoughts. The things were good things, but one could not open them. So what was the use?

These few pieces of jade slips, Cheng Chongshan must have tried all kinds of methods already, and still could not open them.

Those that he could open, he definitely would not take them out either.

Hence, might as well do a convenient favor and give it to Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan had another idea.

The restrictions in the jade slips were a treasure to Ye Yuan.

As long as he could study them thoroughly, Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao attainments would definitely be able to go up a level.

And Ye Yuan was even more interested in the things hidden inside.

Ye Yuan was very satisfied with this gift!

It could be said that everyone was happy.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Cheng is thoughtful. This Ye likes this gift very much.”

Cheng Chongshan smiled and said, “Good that Brother Ye likes it!”

But he sneered endlessly in his heart.

This restriction was laid down by a Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum powerhouse. It was absolutely a grade-four restriction!

Just based on him, a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, he also wanted to open it?

Forget about Ye Yuan, even the elders in the sect most likely would not open it too!

Moreover, take ten thousand steps back and say that even if he could open it, it would be hard to escape death too!

Accepting the gifts, Ye Yuan naturally had to work.

Wu Shuang’s poison looked formidable, but actually, it was not considered very strong.

At least, that was the case for Ye Yuan.

When Ye Yuan took action, it was naturally accomplished with ease.

As for Cheng Chongshan’s junior apprentice brother’s injuries, that was even less of a problem.
