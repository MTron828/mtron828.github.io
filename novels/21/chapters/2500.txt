Chapter 2506: Number One Through the Ages!

Tian Qing’s expression was incomparably solemn.

The divine race that stood high above the masses was really trampled underfoot by someone this time!

Furthermore, it was being subjugated forever that kind!

After today, who could still be Ye Yuan’s match?

In the battle of the supreme, Ye Yuan fought one-versus-five, overpowering the divine race.

This battle completely shattered the myth of the divine race!

The divine race was not a mythical race.

They could be trampled underfoot too!

“Do we still have a way out?” Tian Qing’s words were full of bitterness.

He was somewhat unable to accept this current fact.

To Tian Qing, he had always been the strongest in this world.

He felt that he was this world’s apex, no one could surpass him.

But now, Ye Yuan, this peak, already completely surpassed him!

Ye Yuan nodded his head lightly and said, “Yes. Be more law-abiding in the future. Then I won’t do anything to the divine race. You remember this. In the future, no race is superior to the others! All life is equal! You restrain the divine race and put away that lame sense of superiority of yours. Of course, our human race also won’t pose with the bearing of a ruler.”

Tian Qing had a look of surprise and said, “Do you really mean this?”

Ye Yuan said, “Do you think that I have a need to crack jokes with you?”

Tian Qing’s expression became somewhat complicated.

Honestly speaking, the pride of their divine race was born in the bones.

That pride seemed to be deep etched in the depths of their soul, unable to change at all.

The divine race seemed to be feared by all races the moment they were born.

But now, Ye Yuan’s words were like a form of charity.

When had their divine race, or him, Tian Qing, ever faced such a humiliating moment before?

But Tian Qing was not a fool.

He knew that Ye Yuan was not pitying them.

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, he could absolutely make the human race tower above all races!

But he did not!

Ye Yuan had the qualification of a sovereign. His word was gold.

If he said that all life was equal, then all life would really be equal!

It was just that he did not understand!

“Why? My divine race should have an irreconcilable hatred with you!” Tian Qing said in puzzlement.

“You’ll understand very soon! Before long, I’ll go to the divine race! Now, you all go back!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Tian Qing’s expression changed. He recalled what Ye Yuan said before.

Could it be that Ye Yuan was really going to deal with the Eight Extreme Divinities?

But Ye Yuan no longer paid attention to him and turned to Long Yi and said, “Long Yi, you’ve led the eight clans to guard the Abyss World for hundreds of millions of years, toiling hard and rendering great merits. This rule crystal will be handed over to you! In the future, you’re Dao Ancestor Life!”

Long Yi’s entire body trembled, indescribable joy on his face.

By the side, the leaders of the eight clans were also happy for him.

With Long Yi becoming an ancestor, no one was unconvinced by it.

“Many thanks, Lord Progenitor!” Long Yi said respectfully.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and looked toward Ni Xuan and said, “Ni Xuan, you, as humanity’s chief commander, have rendered utmost contributions! Later, I’ll lay down the inheritance arrays anew. You’ll be the second person with the qualifications to enter the inheritance grand array apart from Wan Zhen!”

When Ni Xuan heard that, he was also wildly elated!

How could he not understand the significance of the inheritance grand array?

One had to know, the inheritance grand array created 18 Grand Ancestor-level powerhouses!

For him to be able to obtain this qualification, even if he did not enter Grand Ancestor Realm in the future, he would also surely be a supreme powerhouse among Deva Realms.

“Many thanks, Lord Saint Azure!” Ni Xuan said agitatedly.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, then surveyed the surroundings and said loudly to the powerhouses that filled the sky, “Heavenly Dao Samsara has already ended. From now onwards, the human and divine, two races, will stay out of the other’s business! If anyone deliberately provokes the two races to be antagonistic, I’ll kill without mercy!”

Ye Yuan’s words were said casually.

But the majesty in those words, no one dared to disobey.

The current Ye Yuan was the true-blue sovereign of the myriad races!

This myriad of races included the divine race!

None dared to defy his words!

Although they did not understand it.

… …

Very soon, the Heavenspan Mountain battle spread throughout the entire Heavenspan World like the wind.

The entire human race was boiling with excitement!

Especially Saint Azure battling five ancestors and overpowering the divine race.

Just listening to it made one feel their hot blood boiling.

This battle achievement, one did not even dare to think about it before today.

If Progenitor Tian Qing battled five great Dao Ancestors by himself, they would not be surprised.

But, a human suppressed the entire divine race.

This sort of thing was too heaven-defying!

“Too impressive! Really too awesome! Being able to see Lord Saint Azure once in my whole life, I can die without regrets!”

“The number one person through the ages! Lord Saint Azure is absolutely the well-deserved number one person through the ages!”

“Lord Saint Azure is really akin to the noonday sun, illuminating through the ages! He alone created three eras! Leaving legacies, suppressing the divine race, suppressing eternally, nobody is able to surpass this kind of feat anymore!”

… …

Following the divine race coming roaring into being, their might had long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people already.

Especially when Tian Qing returned back then, suppressing three ancestors by himself.

That kind of shock was truly unable to use words to describe it.

In everyone’s impression, Dao Ancestors were supreme existences. They were invincible powerhouses!

But suddenly, a person appeared who could actually suppress three people by himself. This impact was really too great.

But Ye Yuan suppressed five great divine race progenitors with his power alone, and it was even the progenitors after becoming Dao Ancestors.

In contrast, Ye Yuan was simply a god up in heaven!

That kind of power could no longer be described using words.

From now on, humanity would truly be able to live under sunlight.

They no longer had any more fears from the ‘rear’!

This huge mountain that suppressed two epochs, was completely suppressed by Ye Yuan!

Before this battle, people’s feelings towards ye yuan were more admiration and idolization.

But after this battle, Ye Yuan was thoroughly apotheosized!

He was the divinity above the clouds!

He was the god of war that suppressed all sides!

He was the sovereign who guarded the human race!

From now on, he was a figure that lived in mythology! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was just that, with regards to these, Ye Yuan himself did not have much awareness.

Not only that, the dark clouds in his heart grew denser and denser.

Because he knew that suppressing the divine race was just the beginning!

That Eight Extreme Divinities which created the divine race was the truly terrifying existence!

Facing this existence, he did not have any confidence at all.

Soon, he would be facing it.

But before this, he still had one more thing to do.

Saving Mu Lingxue!

He went through all kinds of hardships and difficulties, it was in order to obtain the Tear of Life.

Now, he finally got his wish!

But right before it, Ye Yuan’s emotions became perturbed.

The current Ye Yuan was no longer an ignorant person.

His Alchemy Dao already reached the acme of perfection, reaching the realm of rule.

He naturally knew how dreadful Mu Lingxue’s current state was.

Regarding a trace of spiritual consciousness not extinguishing, actually, it was already equivalent to a dead person.

Even he, this existence with invincible Alchemy Dao, was also at a loss on what to do!

Ye Yuan could refine Dao pills, but Dao pills could not save Mu Lingxue!

The Tear of Life was a rule item with a powerful life force.

This power was very magical and hard to describe.

But as for the specifics of whether it was useful or not, Ye Yuan was not sure either.

He was praying in his heart, praying for Mu Lingxue to be able to wake up.

Carrying extreme flustered emotions, Ye Yuan injected the Tear of Life into Mu Lingxue’s body.
