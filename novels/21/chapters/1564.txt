Chapter 1568 Battling Half-Step Divine Lord

“Goodness me, the fire is already catching the eyebrows, but you’re still in the mood to drink alcohol?” the shopkeeper said urgently.

Ye Yuan smiled and patted his shoulders as he said, “Already surrounded, also can’t run out now. We have to enjoy life to the fullest and not let the golden wine goblet reflect the moonlight alone. Come, cheers!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan clinked glasses with the shopkeeper and downed it in one go.

How could the shopkeeper be in the mood to drink wine? His entire person was flustered right now.

He hoped that Ye Yuan could run away, but he was more afraid at this time due to the army.

The army outside, just the aura could make people have a breakdown.

The hand he held the wine cup trembled incessantly, resulting in the wine spilling out a lot. Clearly, he was terrified to the extreme.

The moment the army moved, the entire Clearwind Inn would turn to ashes.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “Shopkeeper, your Clearwind Inn will keep on operating in Wu Meng Capital City. Don’t need to worry.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure flashed, directly jumping out from the window.

On the streets, soldiers dressed in armor looked powerful in neat ranks, gazes sharp, giving people a strong visual impact.

These soldiers were all the City Lord Manor’s elites, selected soldiers and powerful generals under Zhao Yi.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The moment Ye Yuan appeared, countless spears stabbed towards Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan just shook slightly and the long spears scattered away one after another, leaving behind a large stretch of open space.

Even in the fiend race army, Ye Yuan could come and go as he pleased. What did mere city guards count as?

If Ye Yuan wanted to go on a killing spree, not a single person here could escape.

However, his goal was Zhao Yi and Qin Zhaoyun, and not these ordinary soldiers.

When Zhao Yi saw Ye Yuan, his pupils involuntarily constricted and he cried out in shock, “You ... You actually broke through to the middle-stage Origin Deity Realm!”

Ye Yuan had several billion on him, his speed when cultivating was naturally extremely fast.

Just not long ago, he already broke through to the middle-stage Origin Deity Realm.

Recalling when Ye Yuan left back then, he had merely just broken through to the initial-stage Heaven Glimpse Realm. Less than 20 years had passed, he actually directly improved by a major realm!

This cultivation speed was simply terrifying to the ear.

Furthermore, Zhao Yi knew that Ye Yuan was not an ordinary Origin Deity Realm martial artist. He could jump realms to fight!

Back then, when he just entered the initial-stage Heaven Glimpse Realm, bringing along Gui Yun, he cut down five academy elite disciples.

Among them even included three grand completion Heaven Glimpse martial artists!

This kind of battle achievement was simply perverse and crazy.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Commander Zhao, how have you been? This welcome ceremony is rather special!”

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, the air of a sovereign spreading out.

His aura alone actually overshadowed everyone.

Zhao Yi could not help suffocating. Ye Yuan was no longer that academy disciple who could be kneaded as they pleased anymore!

Zhao Yi’s eyes narrowed and he said with a cold snort, “Looks like these few years, you really grew quite a bit. But you should know, you’re nothing in front of City Lord His Excellency!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “And then?”

Zhao Yi’s face turned slightly dark and he said, “Surrender without resistance, you have no chance!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “With just the likes of you?”

Zhao Yi said, “Looks like you’re very confident. I want to weigh just how powerful your strength is right now! All move aside for me!”

Under Zhao Yi’s word of command, those soldiers hurriedly backed away.

This level of battle was already not what they could take part in.

But they did not think that Lord Commander would lose to a brat still wet behind his ears.

A half-step Divine Lord would lose to a middle-stage Origin Deity?

Got to be joking!

“Is there a mistake? This Ye Yuan is also too freakish, right? It has only been 20 years, he actually directly improved by a major realm!”

“But even so, there’s also no way that he can be Commander Zhao’s match, right? After all, Commander Zhao is a half-step Divine Lord.”

“Although Ye Yuan could jump realms and battle when at Heaven Glimpse Realm, half-step Divine Lord already has a portion of a Divine Lord powerhouse’s strength. It’s not what Ye Yuan can deal with at all!”

“Sigh, Ye Yuan still has the temperament of a young man, he’s too anxious in taking revenge. With his cultivation speed, in probably less than 100 years, he can step into Divine Lord Realm. At that time, returning to take revenge again will be practically certain.”

...

On the street far away, seeing these two people confronting each other with swords drawn, they all started to lament one after another.

A genius like Ye Yuan was hard to come by once in 100 thousand years.

They did not expect that this time, he actually came to walk right into the trap.

Zhao Yi raised his long spear, the aura of a half-step Divine Lord displayed in its entirety.

Such a powerful aura was simply a god-like existence in Wu Meng Capital City, this kind of place.

Far away, everyone all marveled in wonder.

Half-step Divine Lord powerhouses taking action was extremely rare.

But the Ye Yuan opposite him still had a calm and collected appearance and was completely indifferent to this powerful oppressive force.

Zhao Yi was secretly alarmed in his heart. He actually could not find a dead angle of attack from Ye Yuan’s body!

As expected, this kid’s strength already can’t be mentioned in the same breath as before! This battle, absolutely cannot underestimate the enemy! Zhao Yi thought in his heart.

Reaching his realm, the perception toward functional activities of vital energy was very sensitive.

Although Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum was much weaker than him, no idea why, Ye Yuan gave him a very dangerous feeling.

This kind of feeling was very bizarre.

“Blazing Sun Heartseizing Spear!”

Finally, Zhao Yi could not resist, a spear suddenly attacked.

He knew that this first move, he already lost!

The moment this spear attacked, he totally did not have the confidence of certainty in the past.

Because he completely could not find where Ye Yuan’s weakness was at!

The mighty power of laws ruptured, virtually shattering the space.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan moved!

Zhao Yi’s gaze turned intent. Ye Yuan actually became blurry in his eyes.

Was this ... a misconception?

Hang on!

How could he, a half-step Divine Lord powerhouse, possibly produce this kind of misconception?

The next instant, alarm bells sounded out for Zhao Yi!

A feeling of immense danger welled up in his heart. A sword seemingly shuttled through the void, passing through his power of laws, arrived in front of his face!

Zhao Yu was greatly shocked in his heart. No time to think, he immediately raised his spear.

Clank!

The two people separated upon contact.

Zhao Yi looked at the Ye Yuan not far away, there was an unreal feeling.

“You ... You actually comprehended spatial laws!”

The shock in Zhao Yi’s heart could not be any greater. That blow just now was absolutely spatial laws!

He broke through to half-step Divine Lord. Although he did not comprehend spatial laws, he could already preliminarily utilize basic spatial laws.

That sword earlier was absolutely spatial laws integrated into Sword Dao laws!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This is the strength of half-step Divine Lord? Merely thus! Come, fight again!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure became indeterminate and fleeting.

Misty Sword Art! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zhao Yi was startled inwardly and hurriedly raised his spear to meet the enemy.

Facing the Ye Yuan who comprehended spatial laws, he did not dare to slight him in the least bit.

A moment of carelessness and that sword of Ye Yuan’s which was elusive as a ghost would claim his life.

At this time, another two figures were rushing over.

“Hahaha, Zhao Yi, you’re also too useless! Can’t even take care of a middle-stage Origin Deity!” When Qin Zhaoyun saw that Zhao Yi could not take him down after a long fight, he laughed loudly.
