1599 The Person Trapped in the Spatial Inheritance

Looking at the light dot become dimmer and dimmer, Ling Yun heaved a sigh and said, “What a shame! An alchemy genius is actually going to perish just like this!”

Once the light dot vanished, it meant that this person was forever lost inside the chaotic space, never able to return.

But Ruo Xu said disdainfully, “This is him courting death himself! He thinks that refining a void spirit divine-grade divine pill makes him exceptional, and doesn’t need to listen to other people’s advice anymore! Can’t even make it through a few days and he actually dares to enter the spatial inheritance!”

Ling Yun gave Ruo Xu a glance but did not dare to follow up.

The struggle of the upper echelons was not what he, this kind of small fry, could get involved with.

He also understood Head Elder’s intention of coming today, but he could not say anything no matter what.

Suddenly, Ling Yun’s eyes lit up and he said in surprise, “Mn? The light dot lit up again!”

Ruo Xu’s expression changed, discovering that that originally already dim light dot really lit up once more.

“Huhu, looks like got to disappoint Head Elder!” Suddenly, Xuan Yu’s voice sounded out from behind.

Ling Yun immediately felt his head swell. Two big shots coming here at the same time, it was really an unprecedented encounter!

But Elder Ye was also worthy of two great elders coming in person.

Ruo Xu snorted coldly and said, “Merely dragging out his feeble existence! The dangers of the spatial inheritance, it’s not like you are unaware of them!”

Xuan Yu gave Ruo Xu a profound glance and said, “Head Elder is quite moody huh! Elder Ye is our Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s pillar of society. If he dies inside, it doesn’t seem to have any benefits to the imperial city, right?”

Ruo Xu’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “This old man is exasperated at his failure to live up to expectations! He, a Pill Tower elder, run to the Martial Tower to join in what fun? Xuan Yu, if Elder Ye really dies inside, you also have the responsibility that can’t be shirked off!”

Xuan Yu could not help choking when he heard that. He discovered that when Ye Yuan was not around, he was indeed not Head Elder’s match.

Going one big circle, he actually trapped himself.

Ruo Xu gave a cold snort, flicked his sleeves, and left.

Seeing that Ye Yuan’s light dot actually lit up anew, his mood naturally could not be good.

Xuan Yu took a look at the light dot on the light screen, calming down slightly.

But the current Ye Yuan was rather wretched.

The chaotic space became more and more complicated. His spatial comprehensions were already insufficient to support him shuttling through space anymore.

Only after expending a Herculean effort, did he find a slightly more stable space that could let him catch his breath.

“Damn it, under this kind of environment, there’s no way to comprehend spatial laws at all! Does that predecessor want to leave behind an inheritance or kill people?” Ye Yuan said with remorse and anger.

Dustless said, “This chaotic space is indeed dangerous, but it should have that point just like the end of a thread. If you can find this thread end, you’ll naturally be able to open another door!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “I understand the logic, but wanting to find this thread end is easier said than done.”

Dustless smiled and said, “Do you think that spatial laws are cabbages? Those able to comprehend spatial laws are all one-in-a-million geniuses. Even though you drew parallels from inference and comprehended spatial laws, you know the how aspect now, but don’t know the why part. Even though you can barely preserve your life inside the chaotic space, comprehending spatial laws isn’t that easy.”

Hearing Dustless’s words, Ye Yuan had a flash of inspiration, seemingly grasping something.

“Senior, what did you say just now?” Ye Yuan asked with an anxious look.

Dustless froze and said, “I said, you know the how, but don’t know the why.”

Ye Yuan hurriedly waved his hands and said, “Not this sentence, it’s that sentence before!”

Dustless was full of puzzlement and thought about it and said, “Drew parallels from inference and comprehended spatial laws. Why, is there a problem?”

Ye Yuan slapped his thigh and said with delight, “That’s it! Why am I so stupid! I comprehended laws with Sword Dao, so why do I have to attend to the trivialities and neglect the fundamentals, forcefully relying on myself to comprehend it?”

Dustless froze and said in a daze, “That works too?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Of course it works! Senior, thank you very much for your reminder! Otherwise, I would still dodge until god knows when foolish!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan took out the Junyi Sword.

“Misty Sword Art!”

Ye Yuan’s long sword moved, immediately entering an ethereal state.

In the midst of the sword art, spatial laws automatically flowed.

In virtually an instant, the entire space became berserk.

However, Ye Yuan was completely clueless, still wrapped up in his sword art.

Crack! Crack!

Space shattered!

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s figure vanished on the spot, entering into another area of space.

Ye Yuan did not stop, continuing to brandish his long sword like changing venues.

The surrounding space continuously shattered, arriving at another region of space again.

Ye Yuan discovered that it was still when he was using the Misty Sword Art that he was the most unrestrained.

Compared to using spatial laws by itself, his perception towards spatial laws under this kind of state currently was a little higher.

But even so, spatial laws also could not be comprehended when one wanted to comprehend.

Fall went and spring came, there were no seasonal changes inside the chaotic space. In a twinkle, three years’ time passed.

These three years, Ye Yuan had been practicing the sword constantly.

Looking closely, Ye Yuan’s present sword art was much more exquisite than before, becoming even more erratic.

Clearly, his comprehension of spatial laws became even deeper.

On this day, Ye Yuan suddenly produced a hint of understanding in his heart. Stabbing a sword out, his entire person seemed to tear across the sky, directly shuttling through the void!

Boom!

This space was directly punched through by him, shattering into pieces!

Suddenly, the scenery before Ye Yuan’s eyes abruptly changed, arriving in an unknown space.

This region of space was clearly much more stable than those spaces he stayed at previously.

Ye Yuan’s gaze suddenly turned intent, titanic waves surging in his heart.

Because not far away, there was actually someone!

A living person!

That person was currently meditating. At this time, he slowly opened both eyes and looked over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan immediately revealed a vigilant look because he was currently holding the Junyi Sword in his hand.

The Junyi Sword was a divine lord mystic treasure. It was hard to guarantee that the other party did not have wicked designs aroused.

Ye Yuan could not see through the other party’s situation, but through Dustless, he already knew that the other party was a third-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse!

Even though Ye Yuan did not fear the other party, the necessary caution was still needed.

That was a man dressed in black, his face seemed aged, and his gaze was lacking in luster like he was already dead.

Ye Yuan understood very quickly, the other party was likely a Martial Tower genius from very long ago who attempted to enter and comprehend spatial laws like him.

Except, he was trapped here, unable to go out.

Ye Yuan completely did not think that there was actually still someone surviving in this space.

That person sized up Ye Yuan. Using a hoarse voice, he opened his mouth and said, “Another one who came to seek his own doom! Brat, you don’t need to be so guarded. Arriving here, you’ll never get out. There’s no use for me to want your divine lord mystic treasure.”

Feeling confused, Ye Yuan’s brows raised up and he said, “Why is that?”

That person slowly shut his eyes again and slowly said, “You’ll know very soon.”
