Chapter 1332: Casually Trampling

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The moment the contract happened, an inexplicable connection was established between Ye Yuan and the man.

“Gui Yun has met Master!” said the Two-star evil spirit in submission.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “En, the function of the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, I believe there’s no need for me to say anymore. You just work for this young master contentedly, and I’ll slowly impart them to you. If you can comprehend fully, becoming a Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperor isn’t impossible either!”

Gui Yun revealed a look of great elation and hurriedly said, “Gui Yun thanks Master!”

“Alright, I’ll take you into my carry-on space right now. You don’t resist it,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Having some spatial-type magic treasure on a Deity Realm powerhouse was very normal. It was not to the extent of making Chang Liang and the rest overly surprised.

Gui Yun did not feel anything off as well. It was just that when his figure appeared in the Soul Suppressing Space, he immediately felt the extraordinariness!

When he saw Dustless, that feeling of beholding a great mountain appeared uncontrollably.

“Huhu, little ghost, your luck is pretty good! To be able to give birth to intelligence when at Two-star, and even ran into this old man, perhaps you’ll be the next Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperor!” Dustless said with a smile.

The dignified Two-star evil spirit became a little ghost when it reached Dustless’s mouth. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“S-Senior, you are?” Gui Yun said carefully.

Dustless smiled and said, “This old man is Dustless, same as you, serving Ye Yuan as my master!”

Gui Yun suddenly discovered that his apprehension toward Ye Yuan probably originated from this old man.

“Senior Dustless, what is this place? Why do I feel that this place is very unusual?” Gui Yun said.

“This place is the inner-space of an empyrean spirit treasure, this old man is this place’s artifact spirit. In the future, you’ll live here together with this old man. As long as Ye Yuan allows it, this old man will naturally impart you the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes!” Dustless said.

Gui Yun’s mind buzzed as if being struck by a bolt of lightning, turning blank.

“S-Senior, you ... you’re saying that ... this place is ... an empyrean spirit treasure?” Gui Yun’s tongue could not even be straightened when speaking.

The astonishment that Dustless’s words brought him was seriously too intense.

This news was even more shocking that the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes!

Empyrean spirit treasure, with Gui Yun’s realm, he was totally unable to imagine this level of existence.

At this moment, he was incomparably thrilled that he did not carry out seizing possession on Ye Yuan. Otherwise, he would really not even know how he died.

If he carried out an attack against Ye Yuan’s physical body, Dustless would really be powerless to do anything.

But if he dared to seize possession of Ye Yuan, entering Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, then it was no different from seeking death.

No wonder Ye Yuan said he would only give him one chance. He really did not bluff him.

“That’s right, it’s an empyrean spirit treasure. Moreover, it’s a divine soul-type empyrean spirit treasure! Little Ghost, that’s why I said that you’re very lucky. If this old man’s strength recovers a little more, I probably won’t take fancy on you anymore! Even if you wanted to be Ye Yuan’s servant, there wouldn’t be a chance either,” Dustless said.

Two-star evil spirits were really just a little ghost in Dustless’s eyes.

If not because he was a tiger that descended onto the plains presently, how could he take fancy on this kind of rookie?

But Dustless’s one sentence made Gui Yun nervous.

His current strength was much higher than his master’s. But if his master’s strength advanced in the future and had no more use for him, would he kill the donkey the moment it had done its job?

Dustless clearly saw through his concerns and said with a smile, “You can put your heart back in place. Ye kiddo values ties of comradeship immensely. As long as you work diligently for him, even if he enters the rankings of Heavenly Emperor in the future, he won’t do anything to you either. He would even help you break through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor! You won’t believe it even if I say anymore. You follow him, and in the future, you’ll naturally know. Now, this old man will impart you the first Ghost Dao Hundred Runes!”

Ghost Dao Hundred Runes was a transcendent art for cultivating the Ghost Dao.

As the name implied, Ghost Dao Hundred Runes was a hundred runes!

These 100 runes contained the transcendent Ghost Dao Hundred Runes of Ghost Dao, exceedingly extensive and profound.

Legends had it that as long as one comprehended these 100 runes completely, they would be able to achieve the Ghost Dao Transcendent Heavenly Emperor, looking down upon the world!

This appeal to Gui Yun was seriously too strong.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was one of the Heavenspan World’s extremely powerful alchemists. He researched the divine soul Dao in detail.

This Ghost Dao Hundred Runes was obtained from a Ghost Dao empyrean, which he killed in the past. The research was also very thorough.

With Dustless’s strength, teaching Gui Yun was naturally nothing difficult.

...

At the outside world, Chang Liang five people were utterly dumbfounded.

The events did not develop in the direction that they expected at all. The result made their jaws drop.

That was a Two-star evil spirit, an existence that could casually eradicate them with a twitch of a finger. It was actually subdued just like this?

When they knew that Gui Yun was a Two-star evil spirit, they even thought that they were dead for sure this time. They did not expect that the final result reversed too quickly.

This Two-star evil spirit actually became Ye Yuan’s servant!

“Your ... Your Excellency, what was that you drew? Why did that Two-star evil spirit serve you as his servant the moment he saw it?” Chang Liang plucked up his courage and asked.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “You also won’t understand if I said it. That’s the thing that Ghost Dao powerhouses cultivate. You just have to know that me taking him in is giving him a lucky chance, that’s it. Since it’s a fortuitous chance, what reason does he have to not serve me, becoming his master?”

Chang Liang five people sighed from the bottom of their hearts and said, “Your Excellency, you’re really too formidable! The five of us brothers are convinced!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Stop flattering! Weren’t you all going to personally kill Wang Yutao? How you want to trample him now is up to you!”

Chang Liang five people trembled all over, their gazes revealing a look of wild elation.

Yeah, with a Two-star evil spirit by their side, this Yin Wind Den, they could roam as they pleased.

What did a mere Wang Yutao count as?

Thud!

Chang Liang five people knelt down collectively, and Chang Liang said, “Your Excellency taking revenge for the five of us, the five of our rotten lives will be sold to Your Excellency!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Get up, the Wang Family and I have already reached the point of irreconcilability. Even if not helping you all take revenge, Wang Yutao must die as well!’

...

“Second Brother, if they don’t come out, could it be that we’re really going to guard here for a year?” Wang Yugan asked.

Even with their strength, they also felt very uncomfortable in this place where Yin wind blew all year round.

Wang Yutao said solemnly, “Otherwise, what can we do still? No idea what kind of heretic skill that punk cultivated either, to actually be able to control evil spirits! Really damn it! No wonder he wanted to enter the Yin Wind Den at all costs. It was probably in order to cultivate the heretic skill!”

Wang Yugan thought about it and said, “Second Brother, why not ... invite Big Brother here! I feel that this kid is extremely abnormal. Continuing to guard like this isn’t the way!”

Wang Yugan’s suggestion made him very moved. But he shook his head again very quickly and said, “What kind of face do we have to go and meet Big Brother with our current appearance? Not killing that punk, it’s hard to dispel the hatred in my heart!”

“Oh? Second Elder wants to kill me so much? I wonder how this Ye provoked Second Elder, to make you detest me like so!” Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s voice echoed in the cave.

“Ye Yuan!”

Wang Yutao and Wang Yugan suddenly stood up, their gaze filled with killing intent!
