Chapter 1843 Essence Gathering Pagoda

Under that young man’s word of command, quite a few men sprang out immediately, directly surrounding Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan’s face turned cold. This guy was so unreasonable, not even asking, and then wanted to capture him indiscriminately. What logic was this?

“Your brother got drunk, so I sent him back. That’s all.”

Toward those family guards who surrounded him, Ye Yuan did not care and just explained nonchalantly.

Who knew that that young man gave a cold laugh and said, “Heh, you would be so kind? I think that you want to conspire a plot against Young Brother Xu, right? What are you still waiting for? Capture for me! If he dares to resist, capture and summarily execute!”

When those family guards received the order, they immediately attacked Ye Yuan.

When attacking, it was very vicious. How was this capturing a person? It was clearly to kill one!

Ye Yuan’s face turned cold, his figure immediately vanishing.

Several cold lights flashed past, that young man only saw a pile of hands fly into the air, tragic screams linking up together.

Within a breath, the family guards all had their hands cut off!

The young man’s face changed drastically when he saw the situation. He clearly did not expect that Ye Yuan’s strength was actually so strong.

Ye Yuan put away the sword and stood there, looking at the young man as he said coolly, “On the account of Leng Xu’s face, I won’t go on a killing spree today. But I warn you, don’t come and provoke me!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan swaggered off.

The young man’s face changed several times, his gaze finally landing on Leng Xu, and his brows could not help knitting tightly together.

“H-Haha, awesome! Brother Ye Yuan, come, let’s cheers again!” Leng Xu’s eyes were hazy from drunkenness and he suddenly exclaimed.

“Ye Yuan? Who was that guy, such formidable strength! Jun Hao, how does his strength compare to yours?”

A man in black suddenly appeared next to the young man and said with cupped fists, “This subordinate ... isn’t confident!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The young man said in a cold voice, “Presumably so. Otherwise, you would have made a move just now. Looks like the Black Smoke Twin Fiends failed. I didn’t expect that this good-for-nothing younger brother of mine actually found such an expert, really underestimated him. Originally thought that it was just a First Firmament Celestial Deity. I didn’t think that his strength was actually so formidable, and that even you don’t have the confidence either. Go and check for me. We must dig his details inside out.”

The young man gave Leng Xu a glance, full of disdain.

The man in black said, “Yes!”

...

Leaving the Leng Family, Ye Yuan went to the Essence Gathering Pagoda set up by the City Lord Manor.

Ye Yuan’s realm already reached peak First Firmament Celestial Deity. He planned to enter a retreat here for a period of time and assault Second Firmament Celestial Deity.

Presently, Ye Yuan’s law comprehension already far surpassed his realm. His realm became the greatest factor restricting his strength instead.

This Essence Gathering Pagoda was a self-service cultivation pagoda, anyone could come in to cultivate.

Of course, the prerequisite was that you had sufficient divine essence stones.

Furthermore, it was middle-grade divine essence stones.

In the imperial capital, low-grade divine essence stones were already unable to satisfy the requirements of martial artists’ cultivation.

Transactions here were all carried out with middle-grade divine essence stones.

The Essence Gathering Pagoda was divided into a total of nine levels. The cultivation rooms here were calculated according to days.

The first level required to pay ten pieces of middle-grade divine essence stones a day, which was also 30 thousand low-grade divine essence stones.

Further up, the middle-grade divine essence stones that each level required would increase several times over.

Reaching the ninth level, it needed 3000 pieces of middle-grade divine essence stones a day, which was a rather horrifying number.

One had to know, 3000 middle-grade divine essence stones were equivalent to 30 million low-grade divine essence stones.

And this was merely just one day’s cultivation expense.

Of course, the effect was completely different too.

Ye Yuan heard that the spiritual energy concentration of the ninth level cultivation room was much stronger than even the Obstructed Tillage Spiritual Eye.

Naturally, the number of divine essence stones required was also extremely frightening.

Ye Yuan entered the Essence Gathering Pagoda and went straight up to the third floor.

There were many cultivation rooms inside the Essence Gathering Pagoda. People entered and left from time to time. The place was very crowded.

When the third floor’s martial artists saw a First Firmament Celestial Deity come up, each and every one of them gave sidelong glances.

Logically speaking, First Firmament Celestial Deities normally trained on the first floor.

Coming to the third floor was purely wasting divine essence stones.

Because of the concentration of spiritual energy here, First Firmament Celestial Deities were unable to fully absorb it at all.

The third floor’s cultivation rooms needed to pay 50 middle-grade divine essence stones a day.

Ye Yuan went one round and finally found an empty cultivation room.

But he was rather curious why this cultivation room was not in use.

Ye Yuan did not think that much either, immediately gathering 4500 pieces of middle-grade divine essence stones and placed it into the card slot outside the cultivation room.

His action drew a series of weird looks.

A First Firmament Celestial Deity placed 4000 over middle-grade divine essence stones in one go, truly extravagant!

By the side, someone said with a sneer, “Heh, this kid is really a sucker!”

Rumble!

With a loud noise, the door of the cultivation room slowly opened.

Ye Yuan was just about to enter inside when a cold voice came from behind: “Boy, this is my cultivation room, who permitted you to enter?”

Ye Yuan turned around and saw a young man in fine clothing.

This young man looked at Ye Yuan, a mocking expression on his face.

“Your cultivation room? The cultivation rooms here don’t seem to register names, right?” Ye Yuan asked with a curious look.

That young man chuckled and said, “Aren’t you curious why this place is clearly empty, but no one came over to put divine essence stones?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Now that you said it, it’s really rather strange.”

The young man said smugly, “This is my, Han Xiao’s private territory. So, nobody dares to come!”

Ye Yuan looked at Han Xiao, curled his lips, and said, “Like that huh, I didn’t know. How about this? Either way, I didn’t go in, so you can just return the divine essence stones to me, then this cultivation room is yours.”

Han Xiao burst out laughing when he heard that and said, “Hahaha! You’re asking me for divine essence stones? What a hoot!”

All around, those martial artists also revealed mocking smiles.

“This kid wouldn’t be a fool, right?”

“Han Xiao has used this move to scam no idea how many people. Can’t be helped, this guy’s strength is too strong. Within the Third Firmament Celestial Deity Realm, nobody is his match at all.”

“This kid, a First Firmament Celestial Deity, actually dares to ask Han Xiao for divine essence stones. I reckon that he’ll suffer.”

...

Ye Yuan’s expression turned dark and he said, “In that case, you intentionally waited for me to put down divine essence stones before coming over?”

This Han Xiao, Ye Yuan naturally had an impression.

In reality, when he just came over, Han Xiao was not far away.

Han Xiao laughed loudly and said, “I did it on purpose, so what can you do to me? Now, get further away! Otherwise, you can be prepared to go out lying down!”

Bang!

Han Xiao’s voice had yet to fade when his entire person directly flew out backward, slamming heavily onto the wall of the opposite cultivation room, fresh blood spurting wildly.

This foot of Ye Yuan’s was kicked solidly.

“There are really self-righteous idiots everywhere! This time, take it as teaching you a lesson! Not anyone is who you can afford to provoke.”

Ye Yuan retracted his gaze that was like looking at a moron, turned around, and entered the cultivation room, leaving behind only the crowd who were starting dumbfoundedly with gaping mouths.

Rumble!

Following Ye Yuan entering, the door of the cultivation room slowly closed.
