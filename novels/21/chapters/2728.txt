Chapter 2734: This Place is My Hometown!

Tang Quan got up, the bull hoof print on his face clearly visible.

Many people were simmering with laughter, secretly laughing.

Half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, they were apex existences in the Five Great Heavenly Regions too.

But now, there was an additional bull hoof print on his face. Thinking about it felt hilarious too.

Of course, this was because Big Yellow did not use his true strength. Otherwise, it would not be as simple as leaving behind a mark.

Even if it was a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, this hoof would also make his head explode.

The Coquettish Profligate Hoof was no joke.

“Is this your Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s prestige? Looks like it’s nothing more than this! This time, I’ll let you all remember it better. If you don’t have sufficient strength, don’t posture in front of so many people. Big Yellow, help sink it into the Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s people’s memories.”

The moment these words came out, each and every one of the Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s people lost their souls.

However, they did not have time to react at all and Big Yellow already arrived in front of their faces.

Bang, bang, bang?…

Big Yellow kicked his hooves extremely fast. Ordinary Jade Sovereign Heavens could not react at all.

In a blink, each of the Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s Jade Sovereign Heavens had a bull hoof print left on their faces.

Of course, there were two on Tang Quan’s face.

He still failed to avoid this hoof.

Wei Yu was even depressed until the verge of vomiting blood. This was the third time!

Each and every one of the powerhouses present was dumbstruck with amazement.

They already overestimated Big Yellow’s strength as much as possible. Who knew that they still underestimated it.

But the problem was, Big Yellow clearly did not utilize any strength. How did he do it?

No matter what, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect’s face was considered to have been slapped ruthlessly once again.

As True Yang’s number one major sect, when had the Seven-star Heavenly Sect endured this kind of frustration before?

Yet, they did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Getting their faces slapped, they could only swallow the insult and humiliation silently, and follow the main force forward.

Hundreds of Jade Sovereign Heavens moved in a mighty contingent and marched for Inklight Forest.

Just arriving at Inklight Forest, Ye Yuan already saw a cluster of bloody light surging towards the sky.

This bloody light stirred the soul, giving people an extremely dangerous feeling.

When Ye Yuan saw this, his complexion could not help turning pale.

Getting close, Ye Yuan discovered that the origin of the bloody light was precisely the place that he sealed back then.

It was just that now, the seal had long already disappeared without a trace.

“Fellow Daoists, I wonder who’s willing to take the lead?” Chen Tai said.

“Big Yellow, let’s enter!” Ye Yuan said without thinking.

When Big Yellow saw Ye Yuan’s complexion, he had long already guessed something. At once, he did not say anything either, directly bringing Ye Yuan and rushing into the bloody light.

A terrifying power surged out of the bloody light as if going to grind Ye Yuan two people up.

But Big Yellow gave a cold snort and stomped with his bull hoof. That surge of power was immediately dispersed.

Swoosh!

The two person’s figure immediately vanished.

Everyone exchanged glances, uncertain what it meant.

But right at this time, there were several figures that rushed straight into the bloody light passageway again.

The others were not willing to fall behind too, following one after another.

In reality, the power of this bloody light had already diminished significantly now.

These people were all Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, going in was naturally not hard.

Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes, his body immediately having a feeling of fusing together in perfect harmony.

This feeling was very intimate.

This was the feeling of returning home!

Fortunately, the Heavenspan World was still the Heavenspan World. Apart from bloody light filling the sky, there did not seem to be too much of a change.

And this cluster of bloody light actually rose up from beneath his feet, teeming the entire Heavenspan World!

The place where Ye Yuan was standing at was none other than precisely the place where the Heavenspan Mountain was originally at.

Further up was the plane passageway that led to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

It was just that Ye Yuan did not expect that there was actually a passageway below the Heavenspan Mountain too!

“Interesting! I didn’t expect that this inconspicuous small chiliocosm actually connects to two major planes! Over there seems to be a dilapidated continent! Ye Yuan brat, is this your hometown?” In his sea of consciousness, came Mi Tian’s exclamation.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, his expression very ugly.

His divine sense already swept the entire Heavenspan World just now, but he did not discover the figures of Li-er and the rest.

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, the moment he released his divine sense, he would be able to instantly cover the entire Heavenspan World.

But he scanned several times after returning, and yet, there were no traces at all.

The people on intimate terms with Ye Yuan, Yue Mengli, White Light, Li-er, and the rest were actually all not around!

The present Heavenspan World no longer had any secrets to speak of to him.

He did not believe that there was anywhere that could deceive his divine sense.

Then, where did Li-er they all go?

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

One figure after another came out of the plane passageway and landed in the Heavenspan World.

“Eh,?it turns out that it’s a small chiliocosm! The ants here are all so weak! There’s actually not even a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse! This kind of ants are not worthy to live in this world, why don’t … I send them off!”

Boom!

His voice had yet to fade when a streak of sword light flashed past.

The person who was talking just now was already reduced to dregs.

Everyone’s faces turned apprehensive.

Because the one who unleashed this streak of sword light was none other than precisely Ye Yuan!

What he was holding in his hand was precisely the Dragon Spring Sword!

That person who was talking just now was an elder of one of the seven great heavenly sects, Dazzling Cloud Heavenly Sect. His strength already reached upper Jade Sovereign Heaven!

But, under Ye Yuan’s sword, he did not even last a single breath.

In everyone’s impression, Ye Yuan was merely a rookie that was hiding behind Big Yellow, that was all. No one really took him seriously. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

But the moment he made his move just now, everyone was shocked.

This punk was not a soft persimmon!

“Boy, are you crazy? My Dazzling Cloud Heavenly Sect’s elder merely said a sentence and you killed him?”

The one speaking was Dazzling Cloud Heavenly Sect’s head elder, Tang Yihe, who was similarly a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said in a cold voice, “I am the ant that he was talking about! He wants to exterminate ants like me, could it be that I, this ant, can’t kill him?”

Li-er and the rest disappeared, Ye Yuan was currently in a violent rage.

Yet, at this time, that person talked nonsense about exterminating the Heavenspan World’s ‘ants’; how could Ye Yuan not be furious?

Heavenly Stratum powerhouses coming to the Lower Realms would always have a huge sense of superiority.

Back then, Jun Tian was merely a measly little Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum and he was the same.

Let alone these Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratums that were standing high above the masses!

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept over all their faces and emphasized each word, “This place is my hometown! Whoever makes a move here, I’ll kill them!”

The moment these words came out, everyone revealed looks of disbelief.

No one expected that Ye Yuan actually ascended from here!

Because they felt it, this small chiliocosm was a small chiliocosm that had Heavenly Dao missing!

Or should one say, this was a small chiliocosm that had been altered by someone before.

It was impossible for someone to ascend from here!

But Ye Yuan emerged!

How could they not be surprised?

“Huhu,?a mere lower Jade Sovereign Heaven, truly arrogant to the extreme! Do you really think that no one can handle you?”

At this time, a young man who looked 17 or 18 years old walked out of the crowd.

With each step that the young man took, his imposing momentum rose frenziedly.

In the end, it actually reached the level of Saint Sovereign Heaven!

When Tang Quan and Wei Yu saw this person, their faces revealed a look of wild ecstasy and they yelled, “Saint Exalt Waycloud, you actually came!”
