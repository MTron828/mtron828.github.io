Chapter 901: Air Bubble

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before their eyes was a massive stone gate. Engraved on the stone gate was an enormous dragon.

The gigantic dragon exuded an archaic aura that had seen the many vicissitudes of life. Even if it had been through countless years of baptism, this pressure made everyone’s heart turned cold too.

There was a pond that was not large beside the stone gate. The pond’s water was an emerald green color.

“Lu Li, you go first.”

Exalt Heavenly Hedonist opened his mouth. A slaughter general under him fell out of the ranks and came beside the pond.

Lu Li bit his finger. A drop of fresh blood dripped into the pond and faded away very quickly.

Gurgle ...

The pond started to emit some azure-colored air bubbles. Counting it, it was merely just four or five of them.

One of the air bubbles flew in front of Lu Li. Right at the instant, it touched his body, the air bubble did not pop. It started to spread toward his entire body, forming a pale-azure light barrier!

Lu Li waved using his hand. The other air bubbles flew towards Exalt Heavenly Hedonist and the other slaughter generals.

Finally, including Lu Li inside, there were four people who obtained this light shield.

Seeing this miraculous sight, Ye Yuan could not help clicking his tongue in marvel too.

Shao Kai moved close to his ear and said softly, “Inside the Dragon Sovereign Territory has an extremely formidable killing array. One must have this light shield in order to not get obliterated by the grand array. But this Lu Li’s dragon race bloodline doesn’t seem to be very strong. He only summoned four light shields.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan revealed a look of realization. No wonder the Exalts were all finding people with dragon race bloodline. Turns out that it was actually this reason.

After Lu Li, there were another two dragon race bloodline martial artists who were called forward. But their bloodline density all did not seem to be very high. The one with the most merely summoned six air bubbles.

The air bubbles that these three people summoned were too little. They could not even cover their own camp’s people, let alone talk about the other exalts’ camps.

“Tch

... This degree of dragon race bloodline also dares to come out and display your inadequacy! Really not afraid of embarrassing yourselves!”

A youth fell out of the ranks. Looking at him, he should be under Exalt Graypupil’s command.

Lu Li and the other two people’s faces turned black. They said unhappily, “Long Yang, aren’t you just relying on that you’re the Sky Long Ridge’s junior? What’s there to be arrogant about?!”

Long Yang shot them an indifferent glance and said scornfully, “I’m relying on that I’m a junior of the Sky Long Ridge. Bite me then. If you guys have the capabilities, bring a few more people in!”

This Long Yang was very arrogant and also felt quite proud of his background.

When Ye Yuan heard Sky Long Ridge this name, he slightly revealed a surprised expression too.

The Sky Long Ridge family were the successors of true dragon bloodline. They had countless intricate ties with the Demon Region’s dragon clan and were also a Rank One Holy Land with exceedingly powerful strength.

It was just that because the Long Family violated the dragon clan’s taboo, so they did not dare to take the surname ‘Long.’ The entire clan could only change the surname to Long 1 .

Of course, this point was similarly the Long family members’ taboo. If anyone were to mention this point, it was embarrassing them.

Although Lu Li and the others were unhappy with Long Yang’s arrogance, they had no choice but to admit that the power of his bloodline was completely not what they were able to match. They could only keep their mouths shut and not talk.

Long Yang smiled even more smugly when he saw the three people shut up. Swaggering over to the side of the pond, he dripped in a drop of fresh blood.

Gurgle ...

The pond started to boil over very soon. All of a sudden, several dozen air bubbles surfaced!

Long Yang put on a light shield himself first, then controlled the air bubbles to envelope all of the slaughter generals under Exalt Graypupil’s command. Even so, there were still ten extra air bubbles.

It was just that the faces of the other camps’ martial artists all showed an expression of regret. They came here hoping for Long Yang to be able to bring them inside.

But now, ten spots was not enough to share!

“Heh heh, there are still ten spots. Who else wants to enter the Dragon Sovereign Territory? I’ll say it first. You must swear a Heavenly Dao Oath that upon discovering treasures after going in, you must let me pick one first!” Long Yang said smugly.

Counting in Ye Yuan, there was a total of just five Exalts with dragon race bloodline martial artists too. Which was also to say that there were still seven Exalts without slaughter generals able to enter the Dragon Sovereign Territory.

One could tell from the Exalts’ attitudes that inside this Dragon Sovereign Territory probably had quite a number of good stuff. Otherwise, these slaughter generals would not take such a huge risk to enter.

Except, if they wanted to go in, it would not do without the support of the light shield. The current Long Yang was undoubtedly hiking prices on the spot.

At this present moment in time, dragon blood martial artists were clearly very high-in-demand. Because blood could only be dripped once. Dripping anymore was useless. Furthermore, the air bubbles surfaced from the pond could only be allocated by dragon blood martial artists. Therefore, each spot appeared even more valuable.

“Humph! Long Yang, what are you being smug for?! Your light shields are valuable, but there’s still a dragon blood martial artist who hasn’t drip his blood yet!” Lu Li had an unhappy look as he voiced out.

With Lu Li saying this, everyone’s eyes all focused on Ye Yuan in unison.

Long Yang laughed loudly as he said, “What a joke! In terms of dragon race bloodline strength, who can compare to our Long Family’s members in the human territories? Lu Li, since you say so, looks like you guys don’t need these ten spots? Mmm ... It seems like everybody doesn’t care for these ten spots. In that case, I’ll destroy them!”

Long Yang assumed a posture like he was going to make a move. The other slaughter generals could not hold back anymore, and someone hurriedly spoke up, “Brother Long mustn’t act on impulse! Isn’t it just one treasure? I’ll give you!”

The one who spoke was precisely Wu He. Exalt Blazing Fire did not have dragon blood martial artists under his command. If Wu He wanted to enter the Dragon Sovereign Territory, he must agree to Long Yang’s condition.

Just ten spots, first come first serve. Furthermore, Wu He and Ye Yuan were mortal enemies. It was also not possible to go to Ye Yuan there to beg.

“Haha, it’s still Brother Wu who is wise!” Long Yang gave a loud laugh and said.

Wu He swore a Heavenly Dao Oath on the spot and Long Yang controlled the air bubble to wrap Wu He up.

With Wu He moving, the other Exalts could not sit still anymore as well. Even Exalt Netherkill opened his mouth and asked for a spot too.

Ten quotas were divided clean very quickly.

“Haha, everybody all done dividing? Then I’ll help myself!” Ye Yuan laughed carelessly and came onto the shore of the pond.

Long Yang’s face revealed a disdainful look. He knew that Ye Yuan’s dragon race bloodline was not weak, but to say that it surpassed his, that was something impossible.

Ye Yuan bit his finger and squeezed out a drop of fresh blood like squeezing toothpaste.

Drip!

The blood merged into the azure-colored pond.

One second passed, two seconds passed, three seconds passed ...

The pond had no reaction at all!

“Hahaha! Ye Yuan, are you here to play the fool? Are you sure that what’s inside your body is true dragon bloodline? This pond water actually doesn’t have any reaction at all!” Wu He burst into laughter when he saw the situation and said.

Long Yang had a contemptuous look too as he said, “Such faint bloodline actually dare to come out and make a spectacle of yourself too! Your dragon race martial technique wouldn’t all be imitated using essence energy, right?”

Si Yin’s expression was also very ugly. She had secretly observed his previous battle. That was absolutely true dragon strength. But why would the pond water not have any reaction at all?

But Ye Yuan did not care at all. A smile still hung on his face.

Gurgle ... Gurgle ...

Just as everyone was mocking Ye Yuan, the pond finally had a reaction.

Seeing this reaction, everyone’s faces revealed a look of disbelief.
