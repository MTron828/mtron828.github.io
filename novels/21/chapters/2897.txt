Chapter 2903 Hegemons Shocked!

“You Jin … is dead?” Divine Lord muttered to himself and did not come back to his senses for some time.

The Absolute Heaven Barrier that was still kicking up a great fuss earlier instantly became quiet.

Hegemon Blacksun even felt his face burn fiery hot. Just now, he condemned Ye Yuan the hardest, wishing to go down in person to smack Ye Yuan to death.

But now … You Jin was actually dead!

This was the first blood race Hegemon Realm that died since the Absolute Heaven Barrier was established!

This significance was too great!

“Dead! Dead until he can’t be deader! Hegemon You Jin died, Bloodpromise escaped with heavy injuries, killed more than 30 blood race Emperor Realms, and 130 thousand people below Emperor Realm! While we only lost less than 3000 men! This battle’s result is even more glorious than South Qi’s great victory!”

Zang Feihong’s entire body trembled agitatedly. When he received the war report, he thought that he had heard wrongly.

This was too miraculous!

Originally, South Qi’s great victory was already a battle result that he could not imagine.

But this time, a Hegemon was actually killed!

Killing a Hegemon, the significance was extraordinary.

Forget about 300 thousand troops; even if it was 30 million troops, 300 million troops, it could not match up to a Hegemon Realm in importance too!

How many Saint Sovereign Heavens did the blood race have?

In a Giant Net City, there were eight million taking part in the hundred sons battle!

Three continents, Saint Sovereign Heavens were calculated in hundreds of millions!

But, among so many Saint Sovereign Heavens, not a single Hegemon Realm could emerge too!

One had to know, in these few thousand years, the blood race merely produced five Hegemon Realms too.

It could be seen how much importance a Hegemon Realm held!

Now, a Hegemon Realm had actually fallen. How could Zang Feihong not be agitated?

Divine Lord felt that even his breathing had become ragged.

A powerhouse like him, what kind of violent storm and wave had he not seen before?

But this time, he was really shocked! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Less than 3000 people died? This … How is this possible? The blood race’s Light of Blood Eye is comparable to our city protecting grand array! S-So few people actually died?” Divine Lord felt that his worldview had been completely subverted.

Zang Feihong said agitatedly, “Ye Yuan obtained blood origin from god knows where. The moment his blood origin activated, the Light of Blood Eye was directly suppressed! Then … it was a massacre! Li Clearcloud faced-off against the heavily wounded You Jin, fought fiercely for a day and night, and finally cut him down!”

When all the Hegemons heard it, it was as if they were listening to a book from heaven.

Blood origin!

Directly suppressed!

You have got to be kidding!

“W-Where did he get blood origin? Furthermore, even if there’s blood origin, it can’t suppress the Light of Blood Eye too, right?” Divine Lord felt that his brain could not quite wrap itself around it.

Zang Feihong smiled bitterly and said, “About this, I don’t know. Your Excellencies had better go ask him personally.”

“Hahaha …”

Before Zang Feihong’s voice faded, Hegemon Cloudmount’s unbridled laughter spread out.

Too satisfying!

Just earlier, he even had the thought of running to the blood race to go and risk his life.

Who would have thought that there would be a turnaround!

His two disciples actually gave him such massive good news!

Hearing Hegemon Cloudmount’s laughter, the other Hegemons shut up sensibly.

This face-slapping was too freaking resounding!

Just now, everyone was berating Ye Yuan bitterly, saying it like Ye Yuan was a fool who was overambitious and unrealistic.

In the end, they were slapped wildly.

Overambitious and unrealistic?

Try killing a Hegemon Realm by being overambitious!

“You all, this bunch of fellows, you wished to drown Your Father in spittle just now! Now, do you have a feeling of getting slapped in the face? Which of Your Father’s disciples aren’t talents that shock the world? Forget about your disciples; you people assume airs every day. Have you killed an Hegemon Realm before? Mn? Sending troops out of South Qi, sweeping across Giant Net, satisfying! Satisfying! Hahaha …”

Hegemon Cloudmount felt refreshed to the extreme, wishing to slap the faces of the others.

It was just that he had forgotten, just now, he had rebuked Ye Yuan and Li Clearcloud too.

However, there was already no one who cared about this.

All the Hegemon Realms were shocked by this shocking great victory.

……

It was still Ye Yuan’s first time entering the Absolute Heaven Barrier. He could not help marveling in amazement.

Combining the power of dozens of Hegemon Realms, this Absolute Heaven Barrier was truly built with superlative craftsmanship, its power boundless.

If not for the Hegemons intentionally letting him in, even if it was an origin powerhouse, they would be ground to dust by this power too.

Suddenly, one illusory figure after another appeared around him, instantly giving him enormous pressure.

Dozens of Hegemon Realms, what kind of terrifying power was this!

Although, in reality, these were all a wisp of clones from the Hegemons.

Ye Yuan felt that even the Li Clearcloud and Feng Xiaotian next to him, their expressions became unnatural too.

Hegemon Realm and Emperor Realm, the gap was too big!

Ye Yuan swept a glance, 63 Hegemon Realms!

This should be all of Heaven One’s strength.

“Hahaha … Terrific lad, you really gained face for Master! Well done! Beautifully executed!” Cloudmount immediately let out a loud laugh when he saw Ye Yuan.

The expressions of the others all seemed rather unnatural.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You Jin was killed by Eldest Senior Brother. It’s him who gained face for Master!”

Li Clearcloud shot Ye Yuan a glare and said, “Don’t give me that! Could it be that I, this eldest senior brother, can still snatch credit with Little Junior Brother? It was you who advocated it strongly, mobilizing forces out of South Qi and attacking Giant Net! It was also you who suppressed the Light of Blood Eye, sweeping away all under Emperor Realm, that I could cut You Jin down. If he relied on the Light of Blood Eye, I really wouldn’t have been able to kill him!”

This was like Bloodpromise attacking South Qi in the past. Feng Xiaotian could resist three to five origin powerhouses by relying on the power of the grand array!

You Jin was a Hegemon Realm powerhouse to begin with. If he relied on the power of the Light of Blood Eye, blocking Li Clearcloud was still a cinch.

Listening to these two apprentice brothers declining modestly, the other Hegemons had indescribable feelings.

Consecutive great victories, the limelight had all been snatched away by Cloudmount’s lineage.

This fellow was really like the noonday sun currently.

Bringing up a Hegemon Realm, an origin powerhouse who could kill a Hegemon Realm, and also, an even more monstrous one that ran to the blood race and became the blood race’s Blood Divine Son.

This was too demoralizing.

“Alright, alright. Your contributions, the alliance will naturally make a judgment. Don’t need to argue any more. Ye Yuan, this lord asks you, what’s the deal with your blood origin?” Divine Lord asked

Mentioning this, Ye Yuan’s face revealed a hint of solemness.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression changed, the other Hegemons also felt a chill run down their backs.

After Ye Yuan finished talking about the Chaos Bloodstone, the expressions of the Hegemons all became solemn.

The joy of the great victory was also swept away clean. What replaced it was deep worry.

They thought that the blood race’s strongest person was Wang Zuo.

Who knew that the blood race was actually born from a Chaos Bloodstone!

Judging from what Ye Yuan described, once this evil stone hatched, it would surely be a calamity!

Hegemon Cloudmount looked at Ye Yuan and only said after some time, “You brat … you’re really messing around too much! Do you know that you’re treating your life as a joke?”

Although Ye Yuan played it down, what kind of character was Hegemon Cloudmount? How could he not know the dangers involved?

This Chaos Bloodstone was the mother stone of the blood race. Its power could be seen at a glance!

Playing schemes with this thing, it was equivalent to dancing on the edge of a knife.

Any slip-ups and that would be a fatal consequence.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually succeeded!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The arrow was notched on the bow and have no choice but to release it! Such a massive secret, how can it do if I don’t personally go and take a look? Although it was a little dangerous, there were some harvests when all things were considered. This wisp of blood origin rendered a great contribution.”

The group of Hegemons was speechless. A puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven actually conned a trace of blood origin from the blood race’s mother stone!

Too freaking impressive!

Divine Lord mused for a moment and said, “Ye Yuan, can you let this lord take a look at this blood origin?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, the origin of blood in his body suddenly erupting.

The expressions of all the Hegemons instantly changed.

Divine Lord’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, ‘This … What pure power of origin! No wonder, no wonder you can suppress the Light of Blood Eye! This Chaos Bloodstone is too terrifying!”

Those present were all Hegemon Realms. They were too familiar with the power of origin.

They had fought countless times with the blood race’s powerhouses and similarly understood the origin of blood extremely well.

But, even if it was Wang Zuo’s power of origin, it was also not as pure as this wisp!

This was the real origin power of blood!

Looking at a leopard through a tube, to see only one spot. They were able to imagine the horror of that chaos bloodstone.

“Once this Chaos Bloodstone is born, that will surely be the disaster of all the heavens! How can there be such a monstrous thing in this world? The blood race has really concealed things so deeply!” Hegemon Chaos Bloodstone said with an emotional sigh.

The other Hegemons nodded one after another. They felt pressure too.

But, following that, it was deep helplessness.

They were powerless to change this situation.

Ye Yuan said, “Seniors, if my guesses are right, Wang Zuo will definitely request the Chaos Bloodstone to take back this wisp of blood origin! I came here to request everyone to take action and help me to suppress this wisp of blood origin! Also, just nice, everyone can take this opportunity to gauge the Chaos Bloodstone’s strength.”

In reality, Ye Yuan also did not know the Chaos Bloodstone’s strength.

He only knew that it was very strong. But just how strong, his realm was too low, and he was unable to perceive it at all.

But these Hegemons could gauge it!
