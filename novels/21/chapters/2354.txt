Chapter 2360: Tried to Steal a Chicken Only to End up Losing the Rice

“I’m Jingnan City’s Tao Hanyi, seeking guidance from Brother Ye’s brilliant moves!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just as everyone was wavering and not advancing, a figure arrived not far in front of Ye Yuan and challenged Ye Yuan.

He was open and aboveboard and did not suddenly sneak attack.

He looked very much like an upright gentleman.

But Yu Tanzhi had a disdainful look as he said, “This hypocrite still made a move in the end! But it’s good like this as well. We can see this kid’s depths again.”

Many people who knew Tao Hanyi all had disdainful looks on their faces.

Making a move at this time was clearly wanting to take advantage of people’s predicament.

However, under this kind of life-and-death battle, it also did not seem to fail to conform with the rules.

Either way, this was a battle without any rules. As long as one put the opponent to death, it would do.

Regardless of whether you sneak attacked, or took advantage of others’ difficulties.

Ye Yuan opened his eyes, glanced at the other party, and slowly stood up.

“Okay, please condescend to teach,” Ye Yuan said with a light smile.

Tao Hanyi had a well-mannered appearance as he clasped his hands and said with a smile, “Brother Ye’s sword formation is transcendent, you have to show leniency!”

But in his heart, he sneered coldly to no end.

Tao Hanyi thought in his heart, he caused such a huge commotion just now. This kid’s divine essence expenditure must be huge! Dealing with him at this time, the timing is just right! As long as I kill him, I’ll be the genius who towers above Wan Zhen!

Ye Yuan was taken aback, feeling a little baffled.

Show leniency?

Are you joking?

Right now, this was a life-and-death battle!

But seeing the other party’s kind appearance, he could only smile and said, “Life and death are up to fate, each relies on one’s own abilities then!”

He did not kill Wan Zhen. Firstly, because they appreciated each other. Secondly, killing Wan Zhen needed to expend huge amounts of energy, the losses outweighed the gains.

But this did not mean that he would also do the same to the others.

Since he came to challenge, then he would have to be prepared to die.

Ye Yuan was also considered to have reminded the other party tactfully. But in Tao Hanyi’s eyes, it became sarcasm.

However, he still maintained his demeanor and said smilingly, “Haha,

that’s okay!”

A moment ago, he was still talking in a jovial manner.

The next second, he already dealt a devastating blow!

Virtually instantly, Tao Hanyi’s tempest-like attack already arrived.

As Jingnan City’s number one, Tao Hanyi’s strength naturally did not need to be elaborated.

Hundred Samsara Saber!

Tao Hanyi’s power of law was the fusion of the law of saber and samsara law, the power tremendous!

Heavenly Dao samsara, want you to live, you’ll live!

Want you to die, you’ll die!

The terrifying saber light instantly engulfed Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s entire person was submerged in the sea of blades.

Ye Yuan was naturally not some rookie. The True Nirvana Sword Formation was already in operation long ago, the four great power of laws transformed into thousands of light, clashing head-on with Tao Hanyi’s endless blade lights.

For a moment, saber lights and sword images, laws intertwined.

The terrifying energy undulation swept across the entire cage in virtually an instant.

But the more they fought, the more alarmed Tao Hanyi became.

Although his power of law was not as strong as Wan Zhen’s, among the top geniuses, it was very formidable already as well.

This guy battled with Wan Zhen and was clearly in a difficult position. So how did he still have such thick divine essence?

His saber images seemed to have fallen into a quagmire when being inside the True Nirvana Sword Formation, unable to cause any harm to Ye Yuan at all.

Only at this moment did he deeply understand, how powerful the guy who broke Wan Zhen’s development of myriad Dao was!

Pang Zhen and the rest had been paying attention to the battle here all this while. Seeing Tao Hanyi gradually losing ground, they could not help being incomparably shocked in their hearts.

He was sure that when Wan Zhen and Ye Yuan fought just now, they did not hold back at all.

That battle could be said to be the top level battle in the cage already.

The consumption of this level of battle could be described using horrifying.

Pang Zhen naturally would not think that Ye Yuan was not able to fight anymore.

But he never thought that Ye Yuan’s combat power could actually still maintain so vigorously.

One had to know, Tao Hanyi was not some random Tom, Dick, or Harry.

Each city’s first place, each one of them was an extremely powerful genius.

Although Yu Tanzhi and the rest were very scornful of Tao Hanyi’s behavior, this did not prevent them from acknowledging Tao Hanyi’s talent.

Prior to this, he did not experience any great battle either.

But now, he wanted to take advantage of Ye Yuan’s battle and let himself fall into passiveness instead.

Very soon, his saber lights were suppressed to the extreme by Ye Yuan.

From his limitless suppression in the beginning, to the current feebleness and dead luster, it did not last too long.

Life and death were already just on the line!

The shock in Tao Hanyi’s heart grew greater and greater, and he shouted loudly, “Brother Ye has excellent means. This Tao admits defeat! Brother Ye, please show mercy!”

But Ye Yuan did not buy it in the slightest and said coolly, “Sorry. In a life-and-death battle, whence the mercy? Moreover, the moment your esteemed self made your move, it was already a life-and-death showdown. Now, pleading for me to show leniency, don’t you find it too late?”

Ye Yuan was also not a fool.

Could sparring and wanting your life be the same?

This guy had that pose of risking his life the moment he came up. He clearly wanted his life.

Ye Yuan’s thoughts were meticulous. How could he not tell that this guy came to take advantage of others’ difficulties?

He thought that he had just experienced a great battle and felt that he was easy to bully.

Heh heh, how could there be such a bargain?

Tao Hanyi yelled out, “Brother Ye, this Tao is ...”

How could Ye Yuan listen to him talk nonsense? Urging the True Nirvana Sword Formation, he directly annihilated this guy.

“Turns out that this is Ye Yuan’s true combat strength!”

“His divine essence is too thick. After going through that kind of great battle, he actually still had such terrifying strength!”

“I know Tao Hanyi, even though he isn’t as strong as Wan Zhen, for Wan Zhen to want to beat him, it absolutely won’t be so effortless either. Ye Yuan is really too strong!”

“I finally understand how he surpassed Wan Zhen in ten years. With thick divine essence like his, coupled with his sword formation, it’s simply a killing machine!”

... ...

There was a shock in Cloudaid City. Only after experienced this great battle, did they finally fully believed that Ye Yuan relied on his own strength to surpass Wan Zhen.

He, this number one person, was fully deserving!

And this battle also truly shocked all of the geniuses in the cage.

Now, who still dared to be blind and come forward and attempt to take advantage?

Even the likes of Pang Zhen and Yu Tanzhi also did not dare to easily step forward.

They were confident that they would not lose to Ye Yuan, but what if they lost?

Their objective was the final supreme inheritance, and it was not to show off momentary bravery.

Therefore, everyone chose to ignore Ye Yuan with a very tacit understanding.

This time, Ye Yuan was really able to recover his vitality with peace of mind.

Along with the passing of time, the battle situation inside the cage also became fiercer and fiercer.

The numbers continuously decreased. From 500 to 400, then to 100.

Finally, there were only several dozen people left!

These remaining several dozen people were all the top-notch group of geniuses. Each person’s strength was extremely powerful.

Of course, of the people remaining, the vast majority were all people who ranked first place in their respective cities.

However, there were also upsets.

Some people were ambushed by someone, and then they died due to fatigue.

But of those who remained, there were clearly none who were weak.
