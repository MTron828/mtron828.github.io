Chapter 2680 - A Bunch of Pseudo-dragons!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Heh, this punk really doesn’t know how the word death is written, to actually dare fight with Muchen!”

“Muchen is strong enough to rank in the top 20 in our seven great royal clans’ junior generation!”

“Ignorant human! Think that he’s impressive for comprehending Great Dao Transformation? Muchen’s lightning chain is an extremely profound application of lightning rule. So how can it be what a mere human can compare to?”

… …

Seeing Ye Yuan attack, the group of young powerhouses all had disdainful faces.

Similarly a transformation powerhouse, but Ye Yuan was a major cultivation realm lower. This was tantamount to seeking death.

However, these two people’s commotion was huge. A single mishap and it would demolish the great hall.

Black Flood Dragon King extended his hand and beckoned, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch came into his hand.

Only to see him silently recite a spell, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch flew to the sky above the hall and emitted a light screen, covering Ye Yuan two people.

A temporary ring was created just like that.

However, before this light cover had formed, eight flying swords arrived with a howl.

The sword lights burst forth and actually directly severed the lightning chain!

“Pffft!”

Muchen was directly blasted flying!

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied again.

They all did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually still hiding so much strength!

With the eight transformed flying swords attacking, that attack power was simply akin to the distance between heaven and earth when compared to two.

In a couple of exchanges, Muchen was taken down.

The temporary ring that Black Flood Dragon King set up actually ended up useless.

A Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum instantly defeating a middle Limitless Sublime Heaven, this sort of thing simply subverted their understanding.

The people who were still mocking Ye Yuan earlier directly chose to shut up.

“Great Dao Transformation is naturally not invincible, but your Great Dao Transformation is a little too weak,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Muchen’s Great Dao Transformation was just a one law transformation. Furthermore, it even stopped at the second form, it was not considered very impressible.

This meant that his cultivation realm had gone up, but his power of rule still stayed at Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Want to say that it was impressive, it was also considered impressive. But, compared to Ye Yuan, it was far too lacking.

“Hehehe, I already said it, Big Brother Ye Yuan is very amazing! Big Brother Youqing, do you want to fight with him?”

Seeing that Mucheng was defeated, Little Dragon Girl was watching the show and did not find that the problem caused was too big, and she said those words to another young man seated on the left-hand side.

This young man had been drinking by himself all along and was not as agitated as the others.

From beginning to end, it was as if everything here had nothing to do with him.

Seeing Little Dragon Girl ask, he smiled and said, “Just a bunch of ants, that’s all; not worthy of me taking action. Younger Sister Jingfei, don’t make trouble.”

These words did not show any regard for Ye Yuan at all.

But Little Dragon Girl turned to Ye Yuan and said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, Big Brother Youqing is the most impressive one here! If you want to convince all of them, you’ll have to beat him down! Why don’t the two of you compete?”

Ye Yuan’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “You lass, that’s about enough. It looks like you’re asking for a beating again!”

Little Dragon Girl stuck her tongue out and said with a giggle, “Royal Father is here. I’m not scared of you!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “If you continue messing around, I’ll be leaving!”

Little Dragon Girl was finally defeated and hurriedly said, “Big Brother, don’t go! I’ll stop messing around, alright? I’m so bored in this dragon palace!”

This girl purely had the mentality of playing pranks.

But, each and every one of these sea race young powerhouses, they were all arrogant at heart and haughty in manner.

They clearly knew that Jingfei was sowing discord, but they just could not resist provoking Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan naturally could not be bothered to pay attention to this kind of provocation. Even if he was being looked down upon, he did not care either.

With his current state of mind, why would he care about how others viewed him?

It was just that, they could look down on him, but they could not humiliate him.

These young powerhouses’ words were very nasty earlier; that was why Ye Yuan would be so domineering.

This Youqing did not take part from beginning to end, Ye Yuan naturally could not be bothered to haggle over it with him.

As for looking down on people, that was your business, what had it got to do with me.

Moreover, Ye Yuan had a million ways to kill a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Seeing Little Dragon Girl’s attitude, the rest were all dumbfounded.

In fact, they were even more shocked than him defeating Muchen.

Jingfei this troublemaker did not just cause trouble in the Thistle South Sea Region.

In these seven great sea regions, which one had not been harmed by her before?

This lass made light of even Black Flood Dragon King, and yet she was actually so obedient to a human youth?

“Goodness gracious, was this young master hallucinating just now?”

“Jingfei this girl actually also knows to be afraid of people?”

“Strange! Peculiar! Could it be that the sun will rise from the west today?”

… …

Ye Yuan ignored the other people’s gazes and went straight up and said to Black Flood Dragon King coolly, “Black Flood Dragon King, your welcoming ceremony is really grand enough!”

With regards to Black Flood Dragon King’s attitude of staying out of it just now, Ye Yuan could understand, but he was not happy.

Therefore, he naturally did not have any good attitude.

It was just that when the others saw his attitude, each and every one of them, they flew into a great rage.

“Impudent! A mere human actually dares to be disrespectful to the Dragon King!”

“Who the hell do you think you dare, to actually dare directly the Dragon Lord’s name directly!”

When all of them on the right side and the left side heard this, they immediately scolded him.

Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and he said disdainfully, “Dragon Lord? Huhu, a black flood dragon attaining Dao also dares to call himself Dragon Lord? In this vast ocean, there’s probably no true dragon, right? This results in you all, these pseudo-dragons, to call yourselves as dragon lords!”

Although Ye Yuan was an ascender, he was an orthodox true dragon descendant.

Before ascending, his bloodline power was cultivated to the extreme too.

After ascending, his fleshy body similarly ascended to Heavenly Stratum!

Hence, although he was a human, he was indeed a dragon race true spirit too!

It was also precisely because of this that his true dragon power would be so vigorous.

As for those present, regardless of whether it was the black flood dragon clan or the coiling dragon clan, they were all pseudo-dragons.

Compared to the purity of Ye Yuan’s bloodline, it was worlds apart.

Speaking of bloodline power, the strongest among them was still Little Dragon Girl Jingfei.

It was just that Jingfei was likewise unbelievably weak in front of Ye Yuan.

This was still under the circumstances that Ye Yuan was only Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Once Ye Yuan broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, his true dragon power would be strengthened again.

Black Flood Dragon King did not have much reaction to Ye Yuan’s words, but Youqing’s eyelids jumped.

Clearly, these words had triggered him.

Even though Ye Yuan’s words were not directed at him.

“Huhu, such high-sounding sentiments! A mere human also dares to be presumptuous about my dragon race? Who the hell do you think you are?” Youqing said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan ignored him and still looked right at Black Flood Dragon King.

Youqing’s eyelids throbbed, fury looming between his eyebrows.

Clearly, he was genuinely enraged.

Previously, he did not care about Ye Yuan’s words at all. That was because, in his eyes, Ye Yuan was just an ant and not worthy of him getting angry at all.

But ‘pseudo-dragon’ this term deeply triggered him.

This was not just something that was his biggest taboo; it was also the thing that was the greatest taboo in the seven great sea regions.

Among the seven great royal clans, there were four great royal clans that belonged to pseudo-dragons.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Evolving into a true dragon one day was their greatest wish.

Except, this step was far too difficult!

Even if they stepped into Saint Sovereign Heaven, they would not be able to achieve this step either.

Ye Yuan’s words were only spoken to ridicule Black Flood Dragon King, but he did not know that he had already committed a taboo.

Of course, even if he knew, he would not care either..
