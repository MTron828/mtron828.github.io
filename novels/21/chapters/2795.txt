“Zi Cheng, the human blood that you got the last time was pretty good. Do you still have any, share a little with me! Zi Cheng? Mn?Zi Cheng?”

At the tail of the team, a Saint Sovereign Heaven was currently talking to the guy behind.

But he talked for a long time, and the other party ignored him.

Turning around to look, his hair could not help standing on end.

He was gone!

There were ten people behind him. Why were they all gone silently?

‘When did they disappear?

“Lord Zhao Ming! Lord Zhao Ming! Things are bad! Zi Cheng they all are gone!” That Saint Sovereign Heave cried out in alarm.

Lord Zhao Ming was their 100 man team’s captain, a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse.

‘When Zhao Ming turned around to look, sure enough, he discovered that ten people were missing, and his hair also could not help standing on end.

Ten people!

They were gone without even setting off any waves?

“Where are they?” Zhao Ming said in a cold voice.

‘That Saint Sovereign Heaven smiled bitterly and said, I don’t know either! We were still talking just now, but when I looked back, they were gone!”

Zhao Ming’s expression changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “It must have been done by those guys! They hid in this fog and secretly killed us! No way, we can’t go on searching like this. Otherwise, we’ll die out!”

Suddenly, Zhao Ming attacked abruptly, hitting into the void.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Very soon, there were two teams of 100 men each that felt this commotion and rushed over.

“Where’s the enemy?”

“Where are they? Zhao Ming, what are you doing?”

‘When the two captains came over and discovered that there were no enemies at all, they could not help feeling annoyed.

Zhao Ming said in a solemn voice, “You guys quickly check. How many people are missing in your 100 man squad?”

‘The two captains were taken aback and hurriedly checked their 100 man squads, and their faces could not help changing wildly.

‘The two teams were missing nine people when added up!

The scariest thing was that they actually did not notice it at all!

“This … What’s going on here?” One of the captains said in shock.

Zhao Ming said in a solemn voice, “It must be those guys who did it! We can’t continue searching like this. Quickly inform everyone, let’s gather together!”

The other two captains nodded one after another.

Very soon, the army was gathered together.

Upon checking the numbers, more than 300 were missing! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone had a gloomy look on their faces.

“Fu Hai? Where’s Fu Hai? Also … Also gone?” Suddenly, a blood race warrior shouted.

Ahint of strangeness showed on everyone’s faces.

The army was already gathered, and these few fellows were still stabbing them in the back!

F*ck!

We can’t do this!

“Quickly go! Can’t stay in this fog anymore!” Zhao Ming said in a solemn voice.

Everyone was very much in agreement.

Hence, the army of 5000 withdrew out of the fog.

Hearing the reports by Zhao Ming and the others., Han Guang’s expression was incredibly dark.

“Damn it! We might not necessarily have so many losses after experiencing a great battle too! These few humans, this commander will definitely kill them!” Han Guang said furiously.

Adding in the 100 man squad that was lost previously, this blood race Saint Sovereign Heaven army already lost close to 500 people before even engaging in war!

‘When their blood race fought with the Heaven One Continent, as long as Emperor Realm powerhouses did not appear, it was very hard for 500 people to die too.

One had to know, this army was a Saint Sovereign Heaven army!

Even when facing a 5000 strong human Saint Sovereign Heaven army, they completely crushed them too and absolutely would not suffer such heavy losses!

The recovery ability of the blood race was extremely strong. The greater the battle, the harder it was for them to be killed.

But, who knew that after encountering five Saint Sovereign Heavens, they actually had so many people being ambushed to death within a few short days!

Han Guang’s heart was dripping blood!

But now, he had already mounted the tiger and found it hard to dismount.

He was seriously injured. It would be hard to recover for a while. It would be to no avail if he entered too.

If he let Chile go in, he was afraid that Ye Yuan they all would directly run away.

After all, Chile’s divine sense was too weak and could not penetrate the fog too much as well.

Unless Ye Yuan they all showed up around Chile, he could not do anything to Ye Yuan they all either.

“Lord Commander, what should we do now?”

Han Guang’s gaze flickered, and he said, “All of you go to the other side and block off this fog! Once they come out, kill without amnesty!”

The subordinate’s expression changed, and he said, “That way, we are at risk of exposure!”

Han Guang said in a solemn voice, “Who cares! Chile alone might not be able to stop them! If even one of them escapes, it will be fatal to us! Commander Luo Chuan will be arriving in three days. After he arrives, it will be the time of death for these guys!”

In the fog, Yang Qing was as destitute as snow.

“These guys are really dumb! Under Saint Exalt Azuresky’s slaughter, they don’t even dare to enter the fog anymore!” Yang Qing showed off and said.

No one paid attention to him.

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “They seem to be waiting for someone here! This shows that this Saint Sovereign Heaven army isn’t all of it! We can’t wait anymore. Otherwise, not only will the news not be sent out, we’ll have to die here too!”

Ye Yuan felt that the blood race probably still had even more True Sovereign Heaven experts that would be arriving one after another.

No matter how weak Heaven One Continent’s human race was, it was also impossible for it to be conquered by two True Sovereign Heavens.

Therefore, they must be waiting!

“How many days do you still have before you can recover?” Yang Qing asked.

“Three days!”

‘Three days later, on the coastline, the 4000 over people blood race army were waiting in full battle-array.

Suddenly, several figures suddenly rushed out and charged right into the army.

The moment Ye Yuan unleashed his Universe Sword Formation, he immediately slew more than ten Saint Sovereign Heavens.

The others killed frenziedly under his cover.

Especially Yang Qing, when a spear rushed out, someone would definitely die!

Seeing Ye Yuan’s grand display of invincible might, Chile’s pupils constricted, and he exclaimed, “How is this possible?! This boy only used half a month to completely recover?”

However, he did not have time to be surprised. His figure flashed, and he rushed towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan five people’s speed was too fast. They instantly formed an opening!

The moment Chile’s True Sovereign Heaven pressure emerged, he charged straight for Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan laughed coldly and a Dao sword actually condensed in his hand!

Chile’s expression changed wildly, retreating ever faster than when he came!

Because this sword of Ye Yuan’s was already chopping down right at him!

He knew perfectly well that this sword directly crippled Commander Han Guang!

However, Ye Yuan suddenly grinned, the Dao sword in his hand directly disappeared without a trace. The terrifying pressure vanished right away.

“Scaring you! Goodbye!”

The five people turned into afterimages, flying straight for the continent.

On the other side, the void trembled, and one figure after another stepped out of the void.

Focusing one’s eyes and looking, there were actually more than 5000 people!

These 5000 people were shockingly all Saint Sovereign Heavens!

‘And the True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses in the forefront actually reached as many as five people!

“Commander Luo Chuan!” Han Guang immediately bowed to one of them.

Commander Luo Chuan was a grand completion True Sovereign Heaven level super powerhouse!

This ten thousand strong army was led precisely by him.

‘When Luo Chuan saw Han Guang, his brows could not help furrowing slightly, and he said in a solemn voice, “What’s going on?”

Han Guang hurriedly said, “Several divergent cultivators suddenly appeared at sea! One of them actually condensed a terrifying Dao sword and damaged my foundation with one sword!”

Luo Chuan said in a solemn voice, “Where are they?”

“Still in the fog. I’ve already ordered Chile to stop them at the coastline!”

Luo Chuan said in a solemn voice, “Useless trash!”
