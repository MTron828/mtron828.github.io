Chapter 2688: Divine Emergence!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The 33 Heavens are the rulers of myriad worlds! It is heaven, not a world! Each heaven is an independent existence, each performing its own duties, dictating the rotation of myriad worlds. There’s a clear distinction between heavens. The barrier of the heavens is a stretch of chaos, isolating all the heavens! True dragons are born of chaos and can travel through the heavens, soaring across myriad worlds! When your realm reaches it, you’ll naturally be able to cut through space. But right now, you’re far too weak!”

That mysterious voice spoke with fervor and assurance, talking tirelessly about the secrets of the heavens.

Only then did Ye Yuan know that the Rainclear Continent was merely a tiny corner of the 33 Heavens, that was all.

The current him was still too weak!

“So that’s how it is! But why should I promise you?” Ye Yuan asked.

Traveling through the heavens, this did not sound like some easy thing

One had to know, going out of a measly little Rainclear Continent was incomparably difficult, let alone talk about traversing the heavens.

“I can make you become stronger!” The mysterious voice said.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Do you have a mystic art to condense the divine soul?”

“Divine soul? You’re talking about people of the Lower Realms, right? People of the Lower Realms, as long as they don’t enter reincarnation, condensing the divine soul isn’t considered a very profound method. It’s just that your current realm is a little too low. So you can’t execute it at all.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes instantly erupted with a shocking light like the sun in the dark night.

He finally saw hope!

However, he forcefully suppressed the excitement in his heart and said in a solemn voice, “Words alone are no proof!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

That mysterious voice said, “This is easy. This divinity will impart you a soul race mystic art right now! After you cultivate it to the realm of major accomplishment, forget about condensing the divine soul; what’s difficult about condensing origin divinities?”

As he said, a set of mystic art actually appeared in Ye Yuan’s mind!

He could not help being greatly shocked. He actually did not have the slightest strength to fight back in front of this existence.

A set of mystic art, he actually instilled it directly into Ye Yuan’s consciousness!

It could be seen how terrifying the other party’s strength was!

He forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart and started studying this mystic art.

Upon cultivating it, he could not help being even more shocked inwardly.

How profound, what a powerful origin divinity mystic art!

This mystic art was called Divine Emergence.

This was a powerful mystic art that cultivated the origin divinity. When cultivated to the extreme, one could rely on the power of the origin divinity and confront Heavenly Stratum powerhouses head-on!

This kind of means was simply inconceivable.

Ye Yuan’s chaos origin divinity was undying and imperishable in the Heavenspan World.

But facing Heavenly Stratum powerhouses, his origin divinity was still too weak.

The origin divinity was similarly a weak link to Heavenly Stratum powerhouses.

But, if he successfully cultivated Divine Emergence, his origin divinity would become powerful to the extreme.

Even if his physical body was destroyed, his origin divinity would still be able to exist independently and continue cultivating to become stronger!

That mysterious voice said, “Speaking of which, chaos origin divinities are mostly naturally born. One such as yours, cultivating into chaos origin divinity post-natal, it’s in the minority! Your chaos origin divinity is extremely suitable to cultivate this Divine Emergence mystic art. With your talent, if you actually don’t cultivate soul techniques, it’s rather a waste!”

Regardless of whether it was ascenders or native powerhouses, each person’s origin divinity had its own attribute.

This attribute was closely related to how one broke through to Heavenly Stratum.

Some people’s origin divinity was lightning attribute; some were fire attribute too, so on and so forth.

Chaos origin divinity was an extremely seldom-seen existence among Heavenly Stratum powerhouses too.

Therefore, when Jun Tian saw Ye Yuan’s chaos origin divinity back then, that was why he would be so surprised.

The chaos origin divinity had no attributes, or should one say, it had well-rounded attributes; having extremely strong malleability!

For example, lightning attribute could only cultivate lightning soul techniques. When cultivating other methods, the effect would be greatly reduced.

But the chaos origin divinity would not!

Chaos could develop myriad things; regardless of which attribute soul technique, he could execute it.

Hence, Heavenly Stratum powerhouses that possessed the chaos origin divinity were actually most suited to walk the origin divinity path!

But origin divinity path cultivation methods and mystic arts were too rare in the Rainclear Continent.

Therefore, Ye Yuan had a treasure mountain, but he had no way of excavating it. Got to say, it was quite a regret.

But, if Ye Yuan successfully cultivated this Divine Emergence mystic art, it would be another trump card of his!

Obtaining the Divine Emergence mystic art, Ye Yuan behaved like he obtained a priceless treasure, and he started cultivating unconsciously.

Cultivation was timeless. No idea how long had passed either, and then Ye Yuan finally awake from cultivation.

He only felt that his origin divinity was almost emerging from his body!

His chaos origin divinity was actually several times stronger than before!

“What a powerful origin divinity mystic art! I didn’t expect that mastering the first level can make the origin divinity several times stronger! Now, I only need a single thought, and I’ll probably be able to effortlessly kill powerhouses at Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum and below!” Ye Yuan exclaimed with admiration.

Ye Yuan suddenly discovered that that mysterious voice actually did not respond, and he could not help being very curious.

“Senior?”

“Mn,?I’m here!”

Only hearing this voice, did Ye Yuan set his mind at ease.

That voice exclaimed in shock, “You, boy, are really a genius in cultivating soul techniques! You actually only used one month and mastered the first level! If not for seeing that you possess true dragon’s blood, I’d even think that you were born in the soul race! Back then, the soul race’s number one genius, Hun Qiansui, also used three full years before successfully cultivating the first level!”

In this one month, the mysterious voice had been in shock the whole time.

The progress of Ye Yuan’s cultivation was seriously too fast.

Ye Yuan did not know the origin of this Divine Emergence, but he was perfectly clear!

The soul race had three great soul canons, this Divine Emergence was one of them!

Back then, he killed a top powerhouse from the soul race before snatching away this secret canon from the other party.

It took him a hundred years to cultivate the first level of this Divine Emergence.

And back then, he was already an apex character who commanded the 33 Heavens.

But even so, it took him a hundred years to just cultivate the first level. The profoundness of this soul canon could be seen.

But Ye Yuan only used a month and finished cultivating the first level.

This speed was simply even more terrifying than the soul race!

The soul race’s secret canon was cultivated by a half-human half-dragon fellow, and the speed was actually dozens of times faster than the soul race’s number one genius!

Got to say, this was a kind of irony!

He naturally did not know that cultivating until this day, Ye Yuan’s understanding of the divine soul path was extremely profound in the first place.

Otherwise, how could Ye Yuan rely on his own strength and achieve the chaos origin divinity in a sealed Heavenspan World?

“Many thanks to Senior for imparting the Dao! Regarding Senior’s request, even if Ye Yuan’s bones are ground to dust, I’ll complete it too!” Ye Yuan said sincerely.

The Divine Emergence had a total of seven levels. As long as he cultivated to the third level, Ye Yuan would be able to perform a secret art in it, called Divinity Assembly!

This technique was precisely the method to condense origin divinity!

At that time, he should be able to truly revive Mu Lingxue!

Ye Yuan killed all the way to the 33 Heavens from the Heavenspan World. It was for the sake of today. So how could he not be agitated?

This mysterious powerhouse imparted to him this cultivation method. With Ye Yuan’s disposition, he would naturally fulfill his wishes even if his bones were ground to dust!

The mysterious powerhouse said,?“Mn,?it’s good that you have this heart! This divinity is really a little tired and wants to go back home! This divinity, Mi Tian, will follow you in the future!”
