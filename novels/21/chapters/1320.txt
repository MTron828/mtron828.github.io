Chapter 1324: Ye Yuan’s Provocation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This ... What’s going on?”

Wang Yugan’s had a stunned look, uncertain why the perfectly fine spectroscope would have this kind of thing happen.

But Wang Yutao’s expression changed, and he suddenly turned around, looking in the direction of the Yin Wind Den.

“Damn it! It must be that punk just now! We were all fooled by him!”

Wang Yutao reacted very quickly, furious until he thumped his chest and stomped his feet.

However, it was already too late!

The current Ye Yuan was long gone already.

The Yin Wind Den extended in all directions. Wanting to catch Ye Yuan was too difficult.

“Second brother, what on earth is going on?” Wang Yugan had yet to react and asked.

Wang Yutao’s face fell, and he said, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, this spectroscope was definitely spoiled by that punk who went in previously! That punk was definitely the Ye Yuan after altering his looks!”

Wang Yugan was stunned and said, “That’s impossible, right? When the spectroscope was testing, he was clearly a green color.”

Wang Yutao shot him a glance like looking at an idiot and said, “Still spectroscope? This spectroscope is merely a joke in front of that kid! No idea what method that punk used either, breaking the spectroscope. He’s provoking us here!”

Wang Yutao was livid with rage and wished to swallow Ye Yuan whole.

Not only did this guy slip away from under their eyelids, he even broke the Wang Family’s profound divine artifact.

Even though this place was the Heavenspan World, profound divine artifact, this sort of thing, was absolutely not some run-of-the-mill good.

The average Deity Realm powerhouse did not have divine artifacts at all.

An ordinary profound divine essence was worth at the very least several hundred thousand low-grade divine essence stones too!

And this spectroscope belonged to the auxiliary-type divine artifact. The price was even more ridiculous, close to a million low-grade divine essence stones!

Hearing Wang Yutao said so, Wang Yugan finally came to his senses. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Thinking about it, it was clearly that this possibility was the greatest!

“Second Brother, you’re saying that the kid deliberately broke the spectroscope to disgust us?”

“Otherwise? He could clearly go inside quietly, but broke the spectroscope! He’s clearly telling us that he has already gone in, and that if you all have the capabilities, come and catch me! What is this if it’s not taunting us?” Wang Yutao said furiously.

Anger was anger, but Wang Yutao was still extremely shocked in his heart.

The spectroscope was not what anybody could spoil!

Even if you let a Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouse come, it was also impossible for him to spoil the spectroscope under the circumstances of not making a sound.

Moreover, breaking it was breaking it, this spectroscope actually changed into all sorts of colors.

If not for seven people coming in one go, they might have made a massive blunder today.

“This ... Second Brother, then what should we do now?” Wang Yugan was also rather flustered.

He discovered that Ye Yuan’s methods emerged in endless streams; He was like a porcupine, making them unable to bite down.

The Wang Family’s initial-most judgment of Ye Yuan was that his pill refining talent was very high. But did not think that he also had such frightening talent in martial arts.

Furthermore, he even seemed to have very deep ties with the demon race.

Such an opponent really made their heads hurt to the extreme.

Wang Yutao swept a fierce glare. While staring at the Yin Wind Seven Heroes, he roared, “What are you looking at? Still not scramming for me?”

Chang Liang and the rest behaved like they were granted amnesty, running away like a puff of smoke.

This Chang Liang was a middle-stage Grotto Profound powerhouse too, his strength uncommon.

But in front of Wang Yutao, it was not enough to look at at all. How could he dare to provoke the other party?

“Big Brother, what the hell is going on here?” along the way, a brother asked Chang Liang.

Chang Liang saw that they had walked far away, that was why he said softly, “The Wang Family is catching no idea who. But don’t know why, he smoked his way through. Not only did he slip through, he even broke their spectroscope! You say, can they not be furious?”

Everyone was tongue-tied when they heard.

“Big Brother, how did you know that was the Wang Family’s people?”

Chang Liang said, “Heh, I’ve met Wang Yutao once before. But we’re minor characters, he doesn’t remember me, that’s all.”

“Goodness gracious, the Wang Family put out such a grand line-up and even deployed the spectroscope, wonder who they are catching?”

A glimmer of brilliance flashed across Chang Liang’s eyes, and he said with a cold smile, “Heh heh, who else can they be capturing? If I didn’t guess wrongly, it’s most likely that Myriad Treasure Tower’s newly-ascended guest alchemist! To be able to make the Wang Family take up arms like so, there’s also only him. Really have no idea what background this guest alchemist has, not only is his alchemy skills unparalleled, he can actually even spoil the spectroscope unbeknownst to god and ghosts! Truly remarkable!”

Turns out, Chang Liang had been feigning ignorance all along. He had long known that the other party was the Wang Family’s people and even guessed that they were here to capture Ye Yuan.

This sort of martial artist who flopped around at the bottom was much more tactful and slippery than ordinary people.

If they exposed the Wang Family’s true colors previously, they would probably have no way of leaving alive anymore.

But at this time, Chang Liang was filled with admiration towards Ye Yuan, this person whom he had never met.

To be able to toy with the entire Wang Family in the palm of his hand, there was likely only him, right?

The Myriad Treasure Tower’s Yang Rui and Wang Family fought for so long and did not gain any advantage at all.

“But honestly speaking, the Divine Essence Pill that that alchemist refined, really have nothing to say about the quality! It’s much better than the Wang Family’s!” said another brother.

Chang Liang nodded and said, “I also bought a few by pulling strings the last time, the quality is indeed excellent! If not for the case, the Wang Family would not go through such great troubles either. If I were Wang Lingbo, I’d also want to eliminate for good!”

Only when he saw Chang Liang and the rest went away did Wang Yutao said icily, “Yugan, immediately notify Yumin, have him hurry to the Yin Wind Den! He’ll guard outside, we’ll ... all go in! Isn’t he provoking us? Then this old man will let him see the price of provoking the Wang Family! Humph!”

...

Entering the Yin Wind Den, Ye Yuan felt a series of Yin wind blow from the depths of the cave, making him involuntarily shudder.

He hurriedly revolved his bloodline power, instantly blocking this gust of Yin wind outside.

The dragon race’s vitality was very powerful. For ordinary Yin wind to want to corrode Ye Yuan, it really could not be done.

In this peripheral, the human martial artists who went in and out were really quite a few.

But the further in you go, the lesser the people.

Suddenly, there was a shrill scream. An evil spirit rushed out of the corner, biting towards Ye Yuan.

The bite of an evil spirit targeted the divine soul, very hard to defend against.

When newbies enter the Yin Wind Den, if they did not have veterans leading, it was very easy to fall for it.

But when Ye Yuan saw that evil spirit, he was very spurred on. Those eyes were glossy and green, like a starving wolf.

“Heh, came right on time! This young master ... is already unable to hold back my hunger and thirst!” Ye Yuan laughed coldly and welcomed it.

Creak.

Ye Yuan’s claw extended out strangely, directly grabbing that evil spirit in his hand, like pinching his vital point.

That evil spirit only had time to emit a miserable cry and was subdued by Ye Yuan.

“Senior, your turn!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

“Heh, still need you, kid, to teach me?”

Inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, the Soul Suppressing Pearl suddenly activated. A surge of soul vortex opened up with Ye Yuan as the center.

That evil spirit was directly gobbled up by the vortex.
