Chapter 1963: It’s Been Hard on You These Few Years

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“J-Jian Hongxiao! This ... How is this possible?”

The current Jian Hongxiao had an imposing aura. He already reached peak True God Realm just like that, and he was even stronger than before he suffered Heavenly Dao backlash back then.

However, Jian Hao knew that for Jian Hongxiao to want to recover his strength, the Six Vein Stellar Pill was a must.

But in this Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, where to find the Six Vein Stellar Pill?

If one could find it, Jian Hongxiao also would not possibly have holed up in Extreme Light Imperial City for 100 thousand years.

The question was that what was going on right now in front of him?

Inside this Stellar Hall, quite a few people knew Jian Hongxiao.

Each and every one of them was dumbfounded, not quite daring to believe their eyes.

Was this peak True God Realm powerhouse before their eyes was really Jian Hongxiao?

Back then, after that incident happened, everyone thought that Jian Hongxiao was finished.

Who could have thought that 100 thousand years later, Jian Hongxiao returned to the peak anew and returned to the Stellar Hall once again, becoming a Stellar Hall elder?

“Hang on! Even if there’s really the Six Vein Stellar Pill, he also can’t possibly return to his peak state! Unless the Six Vein Stellar Pill can reach divine-grade!” Jian Hao suddenly recalled something and said in surprise.

When everyone heard that, they were even more surprised.

“The Six Vein Stellar Pill is a level nine medicinal pill. It is even high-grade, which is very hard to come across. Divine-grade ... how is this possible?”

“Could it be that he really obtained a divine-grade Six Vein Stellar Pill?”

“Didn’t expect, really didn’t expect that Elder Hongxiao could actually return to Stellar Hall one day!”

...

It had been 100 thousand years. Jian Hongxiao had always been staying in a tiny little imperial city.

Suddenly recovering to his peak this time, then there was only one explanation. He obtained the Six Vein Stellar Pill.

But this sort of thing happening was really too miraculous.

However, they did not know that Jian Sutao, who was beside the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere, the astonishment on his face was even thicker than theirs.

Just yesterday, he used the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere to divine things. He found that the Stellar Hall’s elders’ line-up was about to change.

And the person who would join them, it would be Jian Hongxiao.

Putting that aside, he naturally knew how Jian Hongxiao recovered.

Five years!

It really was only a short five-year period for Ye Yuan to refine the Six Vein Stellar Pill!

This ... Was this Medicine Ancestor possessing the body?

A Six-star Alchemy God! Furthermore, it was just a First Firmament True God Six-star Alchemy God. He only used five years and refined the Six Vein Stellar Pill?

Furthermore, looking at Jian Hongxiao’s current condition, he actually seemed to have touched that layer of bottleneck.

If it was really the case, Jian Hongxiao might break through to the Empyrean Realm at any time!

Empyrean Realm!

How many True God powerhouses sought after it all their lives but were unable to break through to this realm?

But Jian Hongxiao actually had a blessing come to him in the disguise of misfortune, touching this boundary.

Being able to do it and reaching this step, the medicinal pill that Jian Hongxiao consumed was absolutely not an ordinary Six Vein Stellar Pill.

Just what kind of existence was that kid?

Only all the way until today did Jian Sutao seemingly realize that he underestimated Ye Yuan.

Underestimated him too much!

This boy was absolutely not an ordinary emperor surmounting aura. No wonder even he did not dare to cast the aura viewing art on Ye Yuan too.

Returning to the Stellar Hall anew, Jian Hongxiao was also filled with vicissitudes of emotion.

When he failed in casting the heaven-defying and fate changing art, he thought that his whole life would be like this.

Hence, he holed up in a tiny little imperial city with his mind at ease.

All the way until one day, he divined that his fate had a change.

But the future was still so confusing and whirling, because he could not calculate why at all.

Later, Ye Yuan appeared in front of him! Everything changed!

Today, he could finally stand here again.

“Sinner Hongxiao returns!” Jian Hongxiao bowed down toward the depths of the great hall, his mind being agitated.

It was silent inside. Only after a long time did a voice slowly say, “Good that you’re back. Retake your seat.”

“Yes!”

Jian Hongxiao answered and walked toward the elders’ side.

Jian Hao was standing here, unable to leave nor stay, being extremely awkward.

“Younger Brother Jian Hao, it’s been hard on you these few years,” Jian Hongxiao looked at Jian Hao and said smilingly.

The corners of Jian Hao’s mouth twitched fiercely. His expression was ugly to the extreme. He wished to find a hole in the ground to crawl into.

He worked hard for 100 thousand years. In the end, he actually still could not beat Jian Hongxiao.

These 100 thousand years, he was just a temporary replacement.

Now that the real master was back, he was kicked aside with one foot.

He was not able to accept it.

But he had no choice.

In Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital, Jian Sutao’s words were the imperial edict. No one dared to defy him.

In Jian Hao’s view, so what if Jian Hongxiao recovered his strength?

He had once committed an unpardonable crime. Could it be that he could be forgiven after 100 thousand years had passed?

Who would those Stellar Hall disciples who died find to talk reason with?

But Jian Sutao did not seem to have the intention of explaining.

Just like that, this matter was decided.

He, Jian Hao, was back to being his protector.

Truly a joke!

“Congratulations to Elder Hongxiao’s return!” Jian Hao gritted his teeth and still moved out of the position in the end. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

All of the Stellar Hall disciples looked at this scene, not daring to even breathe loudly.

It was too awkward for everyone.

...

“I never dreamed that I actually still had a chance to step into the Stellar Hall in this lifetime! Ye Yuan, you showed this old man the grace of rebirth!” Jian Hongxiao looked at Ye Yuan and said with a multitude of feelings.

He deduced his own fate and just faintly felt that change would depend on Ye Yuan. But he did not think that he could return to the Stellar Hall anew for real.

Furthermore, it was extremely quick!

The Six Vein Stellar Pill, he knew that Ye Yuan should be able to refine it. It was just that he did not think that Ye Yuan directly gave him a vast spirit divine pill!

When he saw the medicinal pill, his entire person was dazed.

After eating the medicinal pill, his divine soul was practically about to float out.

It was just that at that time not only did his strength improve further, he actually even had a deeper level of comprehension towards the Profound Spirit Chaos Formula, touching the threshold of Empyrean Realm!

Everyone said give a plum in return for a peach. But now, the repayment that Ye Yuan gave him simply made him unable to bear it.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Hongxiao is doing it again, aren’t you? Is there still a need to be so courteous between you and me?”

“Haha, this old man ... this old man can’t help himself! Oh, right, the Ancient God Battlefield still has a dozen over years before it’s opening. Those children of destiny will be gathering in Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital very soon. Although your destiny is strong, inside this Ancient God Battlefield, destiny is completely useless. I heard that even Dao Ancestor powerhouses had perished there before,” Jian Hongxiao said.

Ye Yuan’s face changed and he said in surprise, “Dao Ancestor powerhouse? Aren’t they eternal and immortal?”

Jian Hongxiao shook his head and said, “As for the specifics, I don’t know either. How can that level of existence be what people like us can try to figure out? I only coincidentally heard Fengqi mentioned it once before very long ago.”

Presently, Ye Yuan had long learned that this ‘Fengqi’ was Jian Sutao’s daughter, while Jian Hongxiao was Jian Sutao’s son-in-law!

Back then, Jian Fengqi had a great tribulation in her life. Since then, she became confined to her bed and never left it again.

Jian Hongxiao loved Jian Fengqi deeply. Hence, disregarding his biological brother’s obstruction, he cast the heaven-defying fate changing art.

Who could have thought that apart from it falling short of success at the last stage, it even affected the All-encompassing Armillary Sphere, sucking the 36 disciples on duty and his biological younger brother all into human jerky.

This matter had always been the pain in Jian Hongxiao’s heart. So he was never willing to bring it up to people.

When Ye Yuan heard this, monstrous waves stirred in his heart.
