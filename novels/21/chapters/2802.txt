Chapter 2808: Reversal!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Logically speaking, Heaven One army’s numbers were 2.5 times that of the blood race. They should hold an absolute advantage.

But the actual battlefield situation was not like that at all!

The blood race army was completely overpowering the humans.

The blood race was undying and imperishable. They did not need to defend at all.

Their fights were simply a crushing-style battle.

The same attacks, Heaven One powerhouses would die immediately, but the bloodkins could revive.

Therefore, the blood race’s army of 20 thousand could completely be treated as 50 thousand troops, or even more!

The blood race’s Emperor level powerhouses guarded the surroundings of the spatial passageway tightly, unfolding an incomparably tragic fight with the Heaven One powerhouses.

In this battle, either you die, or I perish!

“Hahaha … You lowly humans can’t even withstand a single blow!”

Luo Chuan directly tore a human powerhouse apart, sucking the other party’s blood greedily.

In such a battle, the blood race could recover their strength through feeding on the other party’s blood.

Therefore, in battles between both sides, Heaven One’s side would often use several times the power to deal with the other party. But the result was still not optimistic.

“Blood dog, die!”

Dao Chen shouted fiercely, directly obliterating a bloodkin!

The Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples had extremely strong combat strength. Regardless of whether it was martial technique or cultivation method, it far surpassed powerhouses of the same rank.

Dao Chen’s combat strength was naturally extremely strong. It was strong until he could obliterate the blood race.

Song Miao’s opponent was an upper True Sovereign Heaven bloodkin.

The two people went back and forth, fighting fiercely without rest, unable to determine the victor.

Song Miao received the Extreme Medicine Sect’s treatment too, suppressing the blood corruption with the blood of true spirit. Therefore, his combat power when exerted at this time, virtually reached the peak.

In the army, there were no less than 5000 powerhouses who received the same treatment as him.

They had received the Extreme Medicine Sect’s treatment. Their conditions had long already recovered to the peak.

Therefore, they did not take Ye Yuan’s words in at all.

“Zhong Yue, we fought three times. This time, I’ll definitely avenge the enmity and kill you!” Song Miao said with a cold smile.

In the battle previously, Song Miao’s opponent was Zhong Yue.

However, he was struck by Zhong Yue’s palm and corrupted by Zhong Yue’s blood energy, growing weaker with each battle.

Now, his strength recovered to the peak. It was time to win back face!

With regards to Song Miao regaining his peak strength, Zhong Yue was very surprised too.

The blood race did not expect that Heaven One Continent’s powerhouses actually resolved the blood corruption power.

If that was the case, then the blood race’s advantage would be greatly diminished.

“Just the likes of you? You’re not qualified enough yet! If I can hurt you once, I can hurt you a second time!”

Zhong Yue was unrestrained and did not defend at all.

Even if Song Miao regained his peak strength, he found it hard to take him down for a while too.

The two people’s strengths were similar, and the battle was extremely fierce too. Both parties’ strengths were unleashed to the extreme.

Suddenly, Song Miao’s expression changed, his entire person’s aura suddenly became extremely unstable.

Zhong Yue naturally would not let this chance go and immediately rushed over in hot pursuit, not giving Song Miao any chance to catch his breath.

Bang!

Zhong Yue pressed a palm on Song Miao’s chest, sending him flying out.

Song Miao’s complexion turned deathly pale. The blood in his body was boiling.

He suddenly discovered that the true spirit blood that was injected into the body had completely gone berserk.

His divine essence could not control it at all.

‘When Zhong Yue saw the situation, he could not help laughing loudly as he said, “Hahaha … You really scared me badly just now. I even thought that you all really resolved the blood corruption poison! I didn’t expect that you’re simply a paper tiger! Song Miao, prepare to die!”

“Damn it! It turns out that what Ye Yuan said was right! Extreme Medicine Sect’s suppression method really has a huge hidden danger! Normally, it can’t be detected at all. But, once your strength erupts to the extreme, the balance within the body will be completely broken, and the true spirit bloodline

and blood corruption power will erupt at the same time! Now, it’s really a fate worse than death!”

Song Miao was bitterly remorseful in his heart.

It was because he discovered that what Ye Yuan said was completely right.

They had blind faith in the Extreme Medicine Sect and did not have any suspicions at all.

As for what Ye Yuan said, they thought it was naturally for the sake of talking big to impress people, in order to win more attention.

This type of people, he, Song Miao, simply looked down on them.

Swoosh!

Song Miao retreated while fighting, not daring to confront Zhong Yue head-on at all.

And in the army, the blood problem of thousands of powerhouses virtually erupted at the same time.

“ARGH! I’m not resigned to this!”

“Injecting true spirit bloodline, this is quenching thirst with poison! I died so wronged!”

“So what that Ye Yuan said was true!”

Many Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were killed by the blood race while holding strong unwillingness.

At this moment, they felt incomparably bitterly remorseful.

Although the blood corruption power was strong, they were not without the power to fight.

But, in this current situation, it was directly equivalent to sentencing them to death. They could hardly even fight anymore. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In the army, 5000 people were suddenly defeated. It was really being routed like a landslide.

‘The 50 thousand strong army actually directly collapsed in an instant.

‘When the blood race powerhouses saw this situation, each and every one of them was excited to the extreme, killing until the human army steadily lost ground.

“How can this be? How can this happen? The experiments previously clearly didn’t have any problems!”

Dao Chen panicked

How could he still not know that the problem lay with injecting true spirit bloodline?

But the experiments previously were clearly had no problems already. Why would such a major problem suddenly break out?

He could not figure it out after racking his brains!

“T-Tums out that what that guy said was actually right!” At this moment, he finally understood that what Ye Yuan said was true.

But it was already too late.

A rout was like a landslide!

The present Heaven One army had already directly collapsed. Countless powerhouses were killed by the blood race, blood flowing to form rivers!

At this time, five figures stepped out of the void.

The five people each carried a set of bow and arrows on their backs.

‘When Ye Yuan saw the scene in front of him, his brows could not help furrowing slightly.

Sure enough, what he was most worried about still happened!

“Lucky! Luckily it’s still not too late! Each of you, find a good angle! Don’t enter the battlefield. Shoot them with arrows!” Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said.

“Hehe, Big Brother Ye Yuan’s secret weapon, I really want to see just how formidable it is!’ Jingfei said with a laugh.

The four people did not talk nonsense either, finding their positions at the borders of the battlefield and started bending their bows and notching their arrows.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

One sharp arrow after another cut through the air with a strong whistling sound.

Pfft!

Ablood race Saint Sovereign Heaven immediately gave a miserable scream when he got hit by an arrow and his entire person’s movements actually stiffened up immediately.

‘Then he was immediately annihilated by a Heaven One powerhouse!

‘That Heaven One powerhouses’ expression changed wildly. It was because this bloodkin actually did not revive!

He did not have time to think too much, immediately joining the other people’s battles.

This scene was still happening in every corner of the battlefield.

One sharp arrow after another shot out. Blood race powerhouses fell down one by one!

In the wake of the sudden appearance of Ye Yuan five people, the originally defeated Heaven One army actually re-established superiority!

Allat once, the human army counterattacked the other party, killing until the blood race’s army was utterly routed.

Ina short dozen over breaths of time, Ye Yuan five people directly shot hundreds of blood race powerhouses to death.

This was true death!

Those blood race powerhouses actually did not revive!
