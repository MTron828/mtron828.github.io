Chapter 1756 Pries

In front of him was an old man with golden hair all over his face, looking ferocious and malicious.

That appearance was simply a golden-furred lion king.

Ye Yuan was somewhat perplexed. Could such a boorish fellow really refine high-grade medicinal pills?

The old man was also sizing Ye Yuan up, his gaze profound, no idea what he was thinking of.

After a long time, the old man suddenly opened his mouth and spoke in a voice akin to a great bell, “Young man, just what goal do you have joining the Priest Temple?”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Junior has long yearned for demon divine pills. Coming this time, I hope to be able to learn the demon race’s alchemy techniques, and let my Alchemy Dao improve further!”

The old man laughed loudly and said, “Haha, this old man believes your words, you and I belong to the same type of people! For the sake of alchemy, we can fling caution to the wind! However, your goal shouldn’t be just this, right?”

Ye Yuan discovered that this old man’s personality was candid and straightforward, going straight to the point without beating around the bush when talking. He naturally had no need to cover it up as well and said with a nod, “Actually, I came for my brother!”

Ye Yuan did not conceal anything, telling about the matter of finding White Light with the help of the Priest Temple.

After the old man heard, he laughed loudly and said, “I couldn’t tell that you’re still a lad who values friendship! However, don’t you feel that this old man will lose out a lot like this? You learned the demon race’s alchemy techniques and even deployed the Priest Temple’s power. In the end, what benefits can this old man and the terrific lad get?”

Ye Yuan knew that the other party was about to negotiate terms with him.

If the terms were not agreeable, he would be in danger.

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “What I can pull out is my alchemy skills. The reason why Senior is willing to discuss with me is probably that you had your eyes on this too, right?”

The old man laughed loudly and said, “Kid, you’re a smart person. I, Di Qiu, don’t like to beat around the bush either. You stay in the Priest Temple for 5000 years. This favor, I’ll help with it!”

Ye Yuan naturally understood that 5000 years was equivalent to selling himself to the Priest Temple.

This kind of thing, he naturally could not agree to it.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Lord Hall Master, this Ye has my own matters and likely can’t stay at the Priest Temple for long-term. If Lord Hall Master insists on making me stay, this Ye can only stay for at most 300 years!”

300 years was already the limit that Ye Yuan could give.

If Ye Yuan had no ties or attachments, there was nothing wrong with staying 5000 years here.

This place was adjacent to the Skydemon Mountain Range, the spirit medicines in abundant supply.

To Ye Yuan, this place was really a paradise.

But Ye Yuan knew that it was impossible for him to stay 5000 years here.

As expected, the moment Ye Yuan’s words came out, Di Qiu’s face turned dark and he said, “Kid, are you messing with me? 300 years, what do I want you for?”

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “300 years is sufficient to pay back the Priest Temple’s capital sunk!”

“Hehe, what an arrogant brat! To priests, 300 years is merely a snap of a finger. Your talent is pretty good, but giving you 300 years, what benefits can you bring to the Priest Temple? Or is it that you’re simply fooling this old man? Mn?”

Di Qiu glared: a terrifying aura was emitted out.

In an instant, Ye Yuan felt as if Mount Tai was bearing down from on top. Even breathing became very laborious.

This was not realm suppression, but the real deal!

Clearly, Di Qiu was really enraged.

He felt that Ye Yuan was playing with him.

300 years, in the eyes of the average person, it was indeed too insincere.

Under the tremendous pressure, Ye Yuan’s bones creaked and rattled, his complexion deathly pale.

But he said stubbornly, “300 years, I can create countless powerhouses for the Priest Temple! If you don’t believe it, we can sign a Heavenly Dao Oath with 300 years as the date!”

Di Qiu was clearly moved and said coldly, “That works too. After 300 years, if I see your contributions, I’ll help you find your brother then!”

Ye Yuan’s face changed when he heard that, this old fellow was clearly someone who did not commit until success was certain.

Not giving him some benefits, there was no way he would agree.

But with his current strength, he could not do it at all.

This was awkward!

Clearly, Ye Yuan overestimated this hall master’s patience.

Over 300 years’ time, to someone who had never come into contact with demon divine pills before, it was indeed just a very brief instant.

Even though Ye Yuan already displayed his talent, his Di Qiu clearly still did not believe that Ye Yuan could do anything in 300 years.

“Senior, isn’t there any room for further negotiation?” Ye Yuan said with a pale complexion.

Di Qiu smiled coldly and said, “What do you think?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, Di Qiu’s expression changed, imposing momentum suddenly disappearing, and he changed expressions and said with a smile, “Actually ... it can also be discussed!”

The pressure on Ye Yuan’s body suddenly disappeared without a trace, leaving him stunned for a while.

This old fellow still had a threatening and overbearing appearance just now, so why did he suddenly change?

Di Qiu looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “How about this, we each take a step back! I don’t need you to stay for 5000 years, but you have to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath to forever retain my Priest Temple’s priest status. If my Priest Temple needs you to refine pills, you mustn’t decline. If my Priest Temple is in danger, you also have to lend your assistance!”

Ye Yuan was stunned again when he heard this, instantly understanding something.

This Di Qiu was forthright and straightforward and could not think of such a roundabout idea at all.

This way, it was equivalent to tying him to the Priest Temple for life. It was much more worthwhile than staying behind for 5000 years.

Furthermore, this also gave him the maximum degree of freedom.

This kind of thing, Di Qiu’s brain definitely could not come up with it. Just now, there must have been an expert giving guidance, it was just that he did not detect it.

Inside this Priest Temple, talented men were living in hiding too!

But this condition, Ye Yuan did not find it unacceptable.

Ye Yuan had half of the demon race bloodline and was not averse toward the demon race.

Moreover, if he could learn demon divine pills, his Alchemy Dao strength would definitely make great progress.

This way, Ye Yuan would indeed owe the Priest Temple a huge favor too. Being the Priest Temple’s dharma protector for life also did not seem to have anything wrong.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said with a nod, “Okay, I promise you! But, if the Priest Temple is going to be detrimental to me, it’s not within the restrictions!”

Ye Yuan did not have a grin and bear it personality. The Priest Temple was a colossal system, Ye Yuan also did not dare guarantee that he could keep on being friends with the Priest Temple.

Once someone was going to harm him, could it be that he still could not fight back?

So before swearing the Heavenly Dao Oath, Ye Yuan naturally had to eliminate all hidden dangers.

Di Qiu agreed very readily too and said with a smile, “However, the 300-year agreement must be counted!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and swore the Heavenly Dao Oath in front of Di Qiu.

The constraints of Heavenly Dao Oaths were too great on martial artists. Unless it was a last resort, no one was willing to swear it.

But Ye Yuan had no choice but to do so in order to get White Light’s news.

Forget about swearing a Heavenly Dao Oath; even if it was being beaten until his bones were crushed into powder, Ye Yuan would not furrow his brows no matter what.

When Di Qiu saw Ye Yuan swear the Heavenly Dao Oath, he could not help laughing loudly and said, “Okay, from now onward, you’re the temple’s official priest! 300 years. This old man hopes that you won’t disappoint me!”
