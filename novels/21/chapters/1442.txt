Chapter 1446 Risking Their Lives

“I’m ... not ... willing!”

Qin Tian’s eyes gradually became lax, carrying intense unwillingness.

He was the most prodigious student of Wu Meng Capital City in 100 thousand years. If barring no accidents, he could even step into the Divine Lord Realm.

Until one day, a guy called Ye Yuan appeared, snatching away all of his light.

This rookie who was only the Grotto Profound Realm actually covered the light of him, this half-step Origin Deity!

Only a short while ago, Ye Yuan was merely an ant that could be easily crushed to death in Qin Tian’s eyes.

All the way until one day, he discovered to his surprise that this ant suddenly grew up.

Grew to the point where it was sufficient to threaten him!

Therefore, he did not scruple to sneak into the Sky Foothill World and also had to kill him.

But the final outcome concluded with his death.

A heaven’s chosen of his generation perished here and now!

“This ... In a blink of an eye, killed two might Origin Deity powerhouses! How did this guy accomplish it?”

“Too ... Too strong! He’s just at the initial-stage Heaven Glimpse Realm, to actually forcefully toy two mighty Origin Deity powerhouses to death!”

“It’s hard for Deity Realm powerhouses to jump realms! But this guy’s combat power just shoots up at least two minor realms! Simply inconceivable!”

“This Ye Yuan is likely a first-rate genius in the outside world too, right?”

...

In the midst of everyone’s cries of exclamations, Ye Yuan put away his sword and stood there, not the slightest bit of pity in his eyes.

The Qin Family had already used no idea how many means in order to put him to death.

If not for him having some trump cards, he would have long died until not even dregs remained.

The first time this Qin Tian laid eyes on him, he already viewed him as a dead person.

Killing him, Ye Yuan did not have any psychological burden at all.

Boom ...

A piece of enormous rock fell from the sky, directly smashing onto the lone island.

That lone island could not bear it anymore, slowly sinking down.

The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones scattered on the lone island actually slipped down, falling and dispersing into the magma.

He was in a fierce battle with Qin Tian just now. With his mind completely preoccupied, he did not notice this enormous rock.

Now, wanting to salvage it was already too late!

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan used the third Heavenly Thunder Swift Talisman, his body turning into an afterimage, speeding down below.

Ye Yuan urged the deploy within his body to the limit and actually reached first despite moving later, catching up to the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones that were currently falling in an instant.

Ye Yuan moved like lightning. In this split second, he collected seven to eight Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones.

The rest, he was already powerless to do anything.

His straight line dash did not hold back at all. There was simply no way to change directions anymore.

“Grand Elder!”

When Bai Xiu and the rest saw Ye Yuan’s figure rushing towards the magma with immense speed, each and every one of them turned pale with fright.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s speed was too fast. They did not have time to do anything at all.

Bang!

Ye Yuan knocked into the World Suppressing Stele at an extremely high speed.

The World Suppressing Stele kicked up a large cloud of magma because of the tremendous impact, scattering it everywhere.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan directly spewed out a mouthful of blood and did not recover for some time.

This blow was too fierce. Even if Ye Yuan’s fleshy body was strong, he suffered considerable internal injuries too.

It was equivalent to him suffering a full-powered impact of his own. If it were others, they could directly crash themselves to death!

“You punk, is life so worthless? If you keep playing like this, you’ll play yourself to death sooner or later one day ...”

In his sea of consciousness came Dustless’s roar.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s dangerous action, he was virtually almost going crazy.

This series of actions just now only happened in a twinkle.

Not only did Ye Yuan have to collect the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones, he even had to deploy the World Suppressing Stele. Once there was an accident and he dropped into the magma, he would thoroughly play himself to death. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Huhu, aren’t I fine? The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, I have to get it!” Ye Yuan forced a smile and said.

Ye Yuan struggled to his feet, ignored the injuries on his body, and leaped up.

“This place isn’t suitable to stay for long, leave!” Ye Yuan said to the White Night Sacred Palace’s group.

“But ... what about Palace Lord?” Bai Xiu said.

“He’ll be fine. Bai Chen will be safer in this place than the outside world instead,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The dome collapsed, revealing a large gap above.

Ye Yuan leaped up, flying toward that gap.

The faces of Bai Xiu and the rest changed, also hastily following after Ye Yuan.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

One figure after another flew out from underground.

But compared to the battalion when they entered, these figures appeared rather few and scattered.

“It’s Huo Tianyang! That damn fellow, we can’t let him run!”

The moment Bai Xiu came out, he saw Huo Tianyang currently fleeing at full speed.

When the White Night Sacred Palace’s group saw this scene, each and every one of them wanted to chase after him.

“Don’t chase!” Ye Yuan said in a clear voice.

Bai Xiu and the others’ actions stopped, saying with puzzlement, “Grand Elder, Huo Tianyang is our mortal enemy, how can we let him go?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Let him wander around at leisure for some time first! When Bai Chen leaves seclusion, he’ll naturally go and take his dog life.”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said in a solemn voice, “Quickly leave!”

Everyone’s hearts turned cold, speeding away like the wind.

Boom!

Not long after everyone left, raging magma spewed right out from underground, reaching the clouds!

That terrifying temperature, everyone could distinctly feel it from ten thousand miles away.

The magma was like a fountain, looking extremely spectacular.

When everyone saw this scene, their faces could not help changing as he said, “Grand Elder, this ... Will Palace Lord be fine inside?”

This magma was too frightening. It was not up for everyone to not be worried.

But Ye Yuan said coolly, “Relax! Eating the Dao Fruit, Bai Chen is Heavenly Dao! This magma is very dangerous to us, but won’t cause the slightest bit of harm to him.”

Only after hearing Ye Yuan’s words did everyone feel slightly more at ease.

They all knew that Ye Yuan would not harm Bai Chen.

Since he said so, it must be true.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan caught a familiar figure at his peripherals currently fleeing at a distance.

His figure moved and chased after.

“Brother Azurepeak, are you going to leave without saying goodbye when you see an old acquaintance?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

This person was none other than precisely the Divine Envoy Azurepeak.

There were two divine envoys who came together with Duan Fei this time.

But the other divine envoy already perished inside the grand array. Azurepeak’s luck was better, surviving by sheer luck.

He was afraid of being seen by Ye Yuan, so that was why he planned on secretly sneaking away.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan was so vigilant, to actually discover him.

Having his path blocked by Ye Yuan, Azurepeak’s expression was somewhat ugly as he said, “So, it’s Younger Brother Ye Yuan. Azurepeak’s eyes are dull and didn’t see previously. Please don’t take offense.”

How did the current Azurepeak still have any haughtiness of a divine envoy?

Ye Yuan had a grand display of invincible might, cutting down two mighty Origin Deity powerhouses on his own, leaving behind an indelible mark in the hearts of all the Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouses.

Actually, in Ye Yuan’s current condition, whether or not he was Azurepeak’s match was still very hard to say.

But Azurepeak did not know that Ye Yuan only had three Heavenly Thunder Swift Talismans in his possession and already used all of them.

After all, Ye Yuan’s current accumulated awe was too strong!

“Huhu, Brother Azurepeak, us straightforward people don’t resort to insinuations. You have to think clearly. If you go back to the Sky Foothill Divine Place now to inform them, that’s becoming enemies with the Sky Foothill World’s sovereign! When Bai Chen refines the Dao Fruit, it will be the hour where you perish, your Dao disappearing!” Ye Yuan said darkly.
