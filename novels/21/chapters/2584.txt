Chapter 2590: Since That’s the Case, Leave!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Everybody, listen up! I, Feng Xuanyi, immediately issue a sect master order and order Luo Yunqing and Ye Yuan two people to become Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s elders! A grand conferment ceremony will be held on another day!” Sect Master said in a loud voice.

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples!

Everyone was shocked.

“Elder! A Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum actually became an elder!”

“Sect Master has such breadth of spirit, it’s just that, is this position given a little too high?”

“This is probably an unprecedented thing for our Five Light Heavenly Region’s five great heavenly sects, right?”

… …

A grade one heavenly alchemist directly becoming a green-wing protector was already sufficiently shocking to begin with.

But Ye Yuan actually rose straight to elder, reaching the heavens in one step!

One had to know, in Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, only Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses could serve as elders!

There were more than two major realms between Lesser Sublime and Jade Sovereign Heaven.

Feng Xuanyi’s action truly shocked everyone.

“Yunqing thanks Sect Master!” Luo Yunqing said.

“Thank you, Sect Master!?Uh,?I also thank Protector Qin for bestowing the pill formulas!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s smile, Qin Shun’s expression became black as the bottom of a pot.

It turned out that this guy playing this move, it was actually in order to cheat his pill formulas!

This was really suffering a double loss.

It was just that who could have thought that this boy could even refine a heavenly imperial pill?

His gaze turned cold and he said, “Sect Master, a grade one heavenly alchemist taking on the position of elder, it’s not enough to convince the masses! If Sect Master insists on doing so, this Qin will withdraw from Martial Secure Heavenly Sect henceforth! Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, will only have either him or me!”

Everyone’s faces changed, not expecting that Qin Shun actually clashed with Sect Master.

But, one had to admit, this move was vicious!

No matter how high Ye Yuan’s talent was, he was also merely a grade one heavenly alchemist, that was all.

He could refine imperial grade heavenly pills, but could not refine grade three heavenly pills!

But Qin Shun was a living grade three heavenly alchemist!

Feng Xuanyi’s expression was very ugly too.

Being locked horns with by Qin Shun in public like this, it put him greatly on the spot.

His gaze turned dark and he said, “Protector Qin, you’ve been in my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect for many years and know what an extremely talented heavenly alchemist means to the sect! Moreover, Ye Yuan is different from the rest! This matter has indeed somewhat embarrassed you. But this sect master will compensate you afterward, alright?”

Those ascenders were all stunned.

The exalted sect master actually lowered his head to a protector?

Could it be that in this Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, one could come and go as one pleased?

Just a protector, even if Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s heavenly alchemists were extremely few, it was also not to such an extent, right?

Even Ye Yuan was very puzzled too.

Feng Xuanyi’s concession did not make Qin Shun stop. It was only to see him snort coldly. He said, “Sect Master, there’s no discussion about this matter! Either the sect sentences him to death, or I, Qin Shun, leave!”

Feng Xuanyi’s gaze turned intent, revealing unhappiness.

Qin Shun’s request was already not the position of elder, but to sentence Ye Yuan to death!

This was too much!

Disregarding how Ye Yuan’s talent was, if he really agreed, who would still take him, this sect master, seriously?

Your Qin Shun’s face was bigger than me, the sect master?

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s talent gave him a great shock.

Heavenly imperial pill, affinity growing, the significance of these two was too great!

If affinity could really be increased, wouldn’t that mean that ascenders could become heavenly alchemists too?

Therefore, even though Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was still low, his significance to the sect was extremely far-reaching.

Otherwise, how could he possibly hand such an important seat as an elder to a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum?

But what was damning was that Qin Shun’s identity and background were extremely not simple.

How to make his choice was something that gave him a headache.

If it was an alchemy battle in private, it was still fine. But now, he had to make a choice in front of the whole sect!

Was it Ye Yuan, or Qin Shun?

And at this time, Luo Yunqing’s figure suddenly swayed, landing beside Ye Yuan.

He did not speak, just stood there silently, quietly waiting for Feng Xuanyi’s ruling.

That meaning was already very clear!

He was standing together with Ye Yuan!

The whole audience was deathly silent, everyone’s eyes were staring at Feng Xuanyi, wanting to see how he made his choice.

While Qin Shun had a smug look as if victory was already within grasp.

He, a Qin Shun, was naturally nothing much. But the leviathan behind him, who on this Rainclear Continent dared to provoke?

Therefore, Ye Yuan would definitely die!

He was already furious to the extreme towards Ye Yuan.

Even at the risk of offending Feng Xuanyi, he had to doom Ye Yuan to death too!

Suddenly, Feng Xuanyi’s gaze turned intent, and he said to Qin Shun, “Since that’s the case, leave!”

Qin Shun was currently looking at Ye Yuan with a smug expression.

Hearing this, his smile immediately turned stiff on his face, and he said solemnly, “Feng Xuanyi, what did you say?”

Feng Xuanyi said in a solemn voice, “I said, to have you leave the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect! From today onward, you’re no longer my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s purple-wing protector!”

Everyone turned pale with fright, being shocked by Feng Xuanyi’s words.

Shi Feiyu said, “Sect Master, you mustn’t! Offending the Pill Alliance, how will we contend with the four great heavenly sects in the future?”

Protector Mo also said, “Sect Master, you mustn’t act on impulse! No matter how formidable this Ye Yuan is, he’s also merely a grade one heavenly alchemist! Whether or not he can grow up is still unknown! If we offend the Pill Alliance because of this, our Martial Secure Heavenly Sect will struggle to stride forward!”

Han Qianshan said, “As long as we kill Ye Yuan, Protector Qin will definitely be even more devoted to our sect!”

For some time, all the protectors present came out to urge.

Everyone supported Qin Shun one-sidedly.

“All shut up for me!”

Feng Xuanyi shouted coldly and said, “This place is Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, not the Pill Alliance! Although my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect relies on the Pill Alliance, it’s also not what a puny little grade three heavenly alchemist can order around! Qin Shun, you leave!”

Qin Shun’s expression was already gloomy to the extreme.

Hearing that, he smiled coldly and said,?“Huhu,?Feng Xuanyi, you’re very good! I, Qin Shun, am indeed just a measly little grade three heavenly alchemist, but don’t you forget who my master is! Fine, I’ll go! It’s just that today’s humiliation, I’ll return it to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect with interest! Jingxuan girl, let’s go!”

Luo Yunqing frowned and said, “Jingxuan is Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciple, not the Pill Alliance’s disciple, what right do you have to take her away?”

Qin Shun smiled coldly and said, “She is my, Qin Shun’s, disciple. Of course, she’s also the Pill Alliance’s disciple! I’m bringing her away today, see who dares to stop me! Jingxuan, come over!”

Wen Jingxuan had a look of struggle, she completely did not expect that things would actually become such a mess. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

One was the master who taught her cultivation, the other was the sect who provided for her, it was really very hard to make a choice.

But at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly blocked in front of Wen Jingxuan and said coolly, “She won’t go with you!”

Qin Shun said in a great rage, “Who the hell do you think you are! Is it your turn to come and tell me what to do with my apprentice?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile that was not a smile, “You don’t want to take her away for something just as simple as teaching an apprentice, right?”

Qin Shun’s expression changed and he said in a great rage, “Impudent! Jingxuan is a piece of uncut jade. Placing her in the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is a waste too! I’m bringing her to the Pill Alliance for the sake of her future! What else can there be?”
