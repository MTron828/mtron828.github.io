Chapter 2177: Is There Still a Need to Compete After Another Thousand Years?

At the Falling Maple Mountain Range in the Middle Realms.

This place was endowed with a beautiful scenic environment, immortal qi lingering in the air. The entire mountain range was hidden in the fog, unable to see the actual situation.

Powerful spiritual energy was akin to the spring rain, nourishing everything in the mountain range.

On a narrow winding trail, a man and a woman were walking shoulder to shoulder, moving along.

“Young Master, is Elder Sister Li-er really here?”

“That’s right! I’d once inquired from Jian Sutao before; Lin Changqing came from Fallen Maple Bodhidharma!”

“Is this Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple very strong?”

“Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple is Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor, an extremely famous powerhouse of the Middle Realms!”

“Then ... if he harms you?”

“He ... won’t dare!”

This one man and one woman were none other than precisely the Ye Yuan and Lu-er who came from afar.

After leaving Heavenly Dragon Mountain, Ye Yuan went back to release Long Xiao and the rest, and signed a soul contract with them, taking them in as servants.

Following that, he ordered Ning Tianping to bring along Long Xiao, Loneswan, Long Xun, and the rest to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

While he brought along Lu-er and directly came to the Middle Realms’ Fallen Maple Mountain Range.

Now that his strength was already sufficient, Ye Yuan could not wait a moment longer, directly rushing up to Fallen Maple Bodhidharma to find Li-er.

After the Divine Stele Injecting Spirit, Ye Yuan’s realm skyrocketed once more.

Presently, his realm was already comparable to a Second Firmament Empyrean.

After Chaos Realm, Ye Yuan’s realm was completely different from before.

Chaos Realm was divided into initial-stage, middle-stage, and late-stage. Before reaching the middle-stage, he would not encounter bottlenecks.

But according to the division of Empyrean Realm, his strength was currently roughly equivalent to a Second Firmament Empyrean.

While his chaos world also expanded to a distance of 5000 feet already.

“Halt!” The two people were currently walking when two people suddenly jumped out of the fog, blocking the two people’s path.

One of them said in a solemn voice, “This place isn’t a place that you guys should come to! Hurry up and leave!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Demon Clan’s Priest Temple’s Second Sage and Dragon Clan’s Heaven’s Chosen Son, Ye Yuan, came to keep the agreement with Lin Changqing!”

When the two people heard that, their faces could not help changing.

These two titles, either one could scare people to death.

The demon race’s Priest Temple was one of the demon race’s top factions.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest was an existence second only to the Medicine Ancestor in the Heavenspan World.

The Priest Temple’s Second Sage, what kind of existence was that?

As for the Dragon Clan, that was even more terrifying!

Although the Dragon Clan was reclusive, the Heavenspan World never lacked legends of the dragon race.

Major powers emerged from this clan, it was a genuine apex race.

The Dragon Clan’s Heaven’s Chosen Son ... Using one’s butt to think, they would also know that he was extraordinary.

“This guy looks very ordinary, saying that he has such a big background. He wouldn’t be bluffing people, right?”

“Are you stupid?! We can’t see through this guy’s depths at all! He’s likely at least an Empyrean class powerhouse too! The two of us can’t make the call for this matter. Better invite Lord Yufeng to make a decision!”

“Right, right! What you said is right!”

The two people discussed softly for a while and said to Ye Yuan, “This lord, you wait for a moment. We’ll go in and report!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and did not mind.

Before long, a middle-aged man wearing an exquisite long robe slowly walked out of the fog.

He sized Ye Yuan up and said with a frown, “This little brother, you said that you have an agreement with Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a nod, “That’s right! A life-and-death agreement!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The moment these words came out, the faces of Zheng Yufeng and the guards changed wildly.

They all did not think that Ye Yuan was actually here to cause trouble!

Zheng Yufeng said in a solemn voice, “Your esteemed self have such gall, to actually dare come to our Fallen Maple Bodhidharma to cause trouble!”

Ye Yuan flipped his palm over, a token appeared in his hand.

A profound and archaic aura hit him in the face.

Zheng Yufeng’s expression changed drastically. He could sense that the aura on this token was much stronger than even his master’s aura! It was absolutely not an ordinary item!

On the face of the token, two large, simple, and archaic characters were written on it, ‘Second Sage’!

This Second Sage Token was brought by Ji Mo back then. It was personally forged by Sacred Ancestor High Priest. It was used to symbolize Ye Yuan’s identity.

It was one of a kind!

“This token was given by Sacred Ancestor High Priest. I think that in this world, there shouldn’t be more than a few people who can imitate it, right? If you still have doubts, then take a look at this!”

As he said, Ye Yuan pulled aside his lapel, revealing the golden dragon imprint on his chest.

Seeing this golden dragon, Zheng Yufeng’s expression became even uglier.

That golden dragon was incomparably ferocious, as if it was a living thing; as if in the next instant, it was going to pounce over and bite him to death!

He was not aware of the Dragon Clan’s matters. But a Second Sage newly-emerging in the Demon Clan, cracking the eternal chess game, ‘Ask Not’, he had heard of it.

He previously still thought that some major power emerged in the Demon Clan. He did not expect that the so-called Second Sage was actually so young!

Even more so, he never expected that the Demon Clan’s Second Sage was actually a human!

Zheng Yufeng’s heart shook wildly. When did Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing provoke such a powerful existence?

At this time, Zheng Yufeng no longer doubted and said with cupped fists, “Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple’s disciple, Zheng Yufeng, pays respect to Second Sage! I wonder how Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing offended Lord Second Sage? Yufeng will apologize on his behalf!”

Behind the Second Sage stood Sacred Ancestor High Priest.

Even if it was Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple, he also had to give this face.

Let alone that behind this fellow also stood the Dragon Clan!

The reason why Ye Yuan flashed his identity the moment he came up was in order to make Heavenly Emperor Fallen Maple cautious in taking action and be wary of the forces behind him.

Presumably, with Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s and the Dragon Clan’s forces, it was sufficient to intimidate all sides.

So what if he was a Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “There’s no need to apologize! More than a thousand years ago, Lin Changqing suddenly appeared in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City and made a 2000 year life-and-death agreement with me! We signed a divine soul contract and will not rest until we’re dead!”

Zheng Yufeng’s expression changed again, secretly cursing to no end in his heart.

Could this Lin Changqing’s head be spoiled? To actually go and sign a divine soul agreement with Second Sage, never resting until they were dead?

He suddenly thought that something was not right and said in puzzlement, “Since it’s a 2000 year agreement, then the time shouldn’t be up yet as of today. Why did Lord Second Sage come here now?”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “Another thousand years and I’ll be able to kill him by huffing out a breath, will there still be a need to compete?”

A thousand years ago, when Lin Changqing descended upon Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, Ye Yuan was still only at the Celestial Deity Realm and did not even reach the True God Realm.

A thousand years later, Ye Yuan was already an exalted Empyrean, looking down upon the world!

A thousand years’ time was very short in other people’s eyes.

But to Ye Yuan, he took that short period to complete the transformation from Celestial Deity to being an Empyrean!

Presumably, when Lin Changqing saw him, he would definitely jump right out of his skin, right?

Zheng Yufeng naturally did not know this, his brows knitted tightly and he said unhappily, “Lord Second Sage’s status is noble, but you’re also looking down on our Fallen Maple Bodhidharma too much, right? With Junior Apprentice Brother Changqing’s talent, he might not be inferior to you, Second Sage, a thousand years later!”

He felt that this Second Sage was too condescending, so his tone also became blunt.

But Ye Yuan waved his hand and said smilingly, “Whether I’m looking down or not, you let Lin Changqing come out to meet me and you’ll know. I think that even if I lend him some guts, he also won’t dare to drag on any longer.”
