Chapter 2657: Emerald Sea Divine Conch’s Change!

“Heh,?being a grandmist treasure, I can’t imagine its power. If I return it to you guys now, wouldn’t it be tantamount to handing my own life to you?” Ye Yuan shook his head and said.

The ten days’ time that he fought for, it was actually for Heavenly South to gather troops.

If he returned the Emerald Sea Divine Conch and the other party went back on their word, it would be hard to guarantee that there would not be a big battle.

The dragon son frowned and said, “No matter what, there’s no way we’ll agree to your terms.”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “It looks like your goal isn’t just the Emerald Sea Divine Conch! Since that’s the case, then there’s no choice. Let’s showcase our true abilities then!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan stomped his foot. The power of a grand array suddenly rippled out.

When those seafolk saw this scene, their expressions immediately changed drastically and fled like crazy.

Even the dragon son’s expression turned slightly pale too.

He was only a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse and could not block Ye Yuan’s poison!

The dragon son said, “Consider yourself ruthless! We’ll withdraw! However, you have to make an origin divinity contract with this dragon son. If one party violates it, heaven and earth will destroy him!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “As it ought to be!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

… …

The torrential rain ceased and the tide receded.

On the city wall, everyone saw the sea race leave with the waves and felt like they just had a dream.

The Huang Haoyan who was beside Ye Yuan still had not wrapped his brain around it until now, his entire person feeling muddle-headed.

He actually came back alive!

This result was what he never expected.

When Su Peiyun saw him, she jumped directly into his arms.

“P-Peiyun, am I still alive? Am I dreaming?” Huang Haoyan said in disbelief.

Su Peiyun flicked him, having tears through her smile as she said, “You’re still alive! You’re not dreaming! It was Master Ye who saved you!”

“Right, right, right! Master Ye! It’s Master Ye!”

Huang Haoyan suddenly startled awake and directly knelt down to Ye Yuan and said, “Many thanks to Master Ye for your life-saving grace!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Alright, go back and rest. You take this Heavenly Tranquil Pill back. Refine it well.”

This kind of grand spectacle had a great impact on Huang Haoyan’s mind.

Right now, he was feeling ill at ease. It had a great impact on cultivation. He needed to adjust for a bit.

Heavenly Tranquil Pill was the best heavenly pill for calming the spirit and focusing your mind. The grade of ninth grade perfection would naturally help Huang Haoyan stabilize his mind.

Huang Haoyan received the Heavenly Tranquil Pill and felt incomparably touched and left with a thousand thanks.

“Master Ye’s means is truly astonishing! What you saved isn’t just Huang Haoyan, there’s also all of these nine cities’ civilians! This Cui thanks Master Ye on their behalf for your great kindness!”

Cui Tong gave a deep bow to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Now, not planning on capturing me anymore?”

Cui Tong’s old face turned red and he blushed and said, “Master Ye don’t blame me! It’s really that …”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said indifferently, “Your ulterior thoughts can’t be hidden from me. Rest assured, I’ll leave behind a legacy in the Land of Heavenly South. But that’s my business. It has nothing to do with you, understand?”

When Cui Tong and the rest heard that, they were immediately overjoyed and hurriedly said, “This Cui understands! Understands!”

At this very moment, only then did Cui Tong know how ridiculous his previous thoughts were.

Even the black shark general could not make Ye Yuan stay. Just the likes of them, three middle Jade Sovereign Heavens, how could they keep Ye Yuan behind?

Cui Tong could not help rejoicing for not making a move back then.

Otherwise, Ye Yuan would never have left behind his legacy.

Cui Tong’s eyes swiveled around and he said, “Master Ye, since you have such a fearsome poisoning method, can we wipe the sea race out in one fell swoop ten days later?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “Elder Cui, you’re thinking too much! How many hundreds of millions does the sea race living things are there? No matter how formidable my poison is, it’s also impossible to poison all of them to death!”

Ye Yuan naturally knew Cui Tong’s thoughts. He wanted to slaughter the Thistle South sea race completely to avoid future troubles forever.

It was just that, he was merely utilizing an empty-fort strategy previously.

No matter how powerful the poison, it was also impossible to kill an entire sea region of sea race true spirits.

Cui Tong opened his mouth wide and said with a shocked face, “You … You bluffed them?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The power of my poison formation is the strongest within ten miles! Outside of ten miles, it’s beyond my ability! That black shark commander’s strength is quite strong, if it really came to blows, do you feel that I’ll have the chance to poison all of the seafolk to death? Slaughtering all of the seafolk, forget about me, even if a Saint Sovereign Heaven came, they can’t do it too!”

“This … This …”

“Master Ye, you’re playing mind games!”

“Master Ye, once you get exposed, that’s dying without a burial ground! You’re really gutsy!”

… …

The city lord big shots present were all shocked until they stared at him dumbfoundedly.

Not only did Ye Yuan hide it from the dragon son, he even hid it from the powerhouses in the city!

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “This matter seems dangerous, but actually, it’s very safe! Anyone who saw me instantly killing ten miles of seafolk will find it impossible to not be shocked. As long as he’s afraid, I’ll naturally be safe. At least, you all also thought that I could kill all of the seafolk, right?”

Cui Tong and the rest were taken aback and actually could not find the words to refute it.

Yeah!

The impact of that scene was seriously too intense.

Even if it was a peak Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, it would also be impossible to instantly kill all of the powerhouses in a radius of ten miles!

But Ye Yuan did it!

Since he did it, that sort of psychological suggestion would be very strong.

The seafolk feared death too, especially the royal clan.

Therefore, the operation this time seemed dangerous but was actually very safe.

The gazes of Cui Tong and the rest when they looked at Ye Yuan again were already full of awe.

Forget that this boy was proficient in both alchemy and martial arts, he was also bold and meticulous, having everything under control.

Using there was a gully in his chest and a universe in his abdomen to describe Ye Yuan was all too apt.

Such a person was simply too monstrous!

… …

Ten days passed in a flash.

The sea race army retreated, and the ocean became land once again.

In ten days, Heavenly South City also completed the assembly of an army and rushed to Calm South City.

Heavenly South army’s commander-in-chief, was Heavenly South City’s deputy city lord, Ning Guangcheng.

Ye Yuan was not concerned about the changes in the outside world.

During these ten days, he had been in closed-seclusion all along.

After repeated battles, coupled with the help of heavenly pills, Ye Yuan’s strength already reached peak middle Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

In these ten days, he was currently breaking through to upper Greater Sublime Heaven.

Suddenly, one light halo after another suddenly lit up inside the secret chamber.

Ye Yuan felt that his entire body started burning.

“Mn??This is …”

Ye Yuan looked at the Emerald Sea Divine Conch in front of him and had a look of shock.

Ever since the battle outside the city, the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was being safeguarded by Ye Yuan for the time being.

He could not see through this item all along. It did not seem like a grandmist treasure at all.

Otherwise, even if he did not know the grandmist treasure, it would also not be to an extent of not recognizing it.

This conch was too ordinary.

But today, an undulation actually occurred.

Furthermore, its undulation actually affected him!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s expression changed, and he hurriedly calmed down.

Within the secret chamber, spiritual energy suddenly gathered.

In virtually an instant, Ye Yuan broke through the bottleneck and reached upper Greater Sublime Heaven!

And this was not the end yet!

Under the influence of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, the blood in Ye Yuan’s body started burning crazily.

His realm was soaring toward grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven!

“Hehehe,?really interesting! I didn’t expect to actually meet a clansman!” Suddenly, a silver bell-like laughter sounded out in the secret chamber.
