Chapter 3103: Chaos Heavenly Spirit List!

“Won! We … We won!”

“Really didn’t expect that we could actually still survive! Sniff sniff …”

“Heavenly Saint Ye will live for generations to come and be invincible under the heavens!”

…..

After a brief silence, thunderous cheers erupted in front of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s mountain pass gates.

This victory that was not easy to come by made many people weep with great joy.

Some people fell into wild ecstasy.

Some cried, some laughed, some were inspired, and some were dispirited.

A myriad of emotions exploded completely under the joy of surviving a calamity.

Ye Yuan looked at them but could not be happy no matter what.

This battle was too tragic!

Many people that he knew had already perished, their Dao dissipating. He could no longer see their figures, especially Feng Xiaotian.

After the wild ecstasy, the people gradually calmed down.

Ye Yuan made a hand gesture. The whole place was silent.

The current Ye Yuan was already a god-like existence in everyone’s hearts.

Ye Yuan said loudly, “Brother Feng’s battles shattered the firmament throughout his life, only to protect the Dao in his heart! Although dead, it’s glorious! Today, he’ll be canonized as a god of war, and a statue will be established here to be admired by all generations! He is everlasting! Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang followed the triumph. Their contributions are unparalleled. They will be conferred as the left and right protector celestial deities! Do you all have any objections?”

Everyone was respectful and said in unison, “We have no objections!”

If someone whose status was second only to Ye Yuan, that was bound to be Feng Xiaotian.

Although the god of war was dead, his power and influence did not drop!

Feng Xiaotian used his Dao to make everyone admire him endlessly.

Therefore, Ye Yuan conferred him as the god of war. The others did not have any refusal on this.

Swoosh!

Seven streams of flowing light flew out of Ye Yuan’s body and landed on the ground with a bang, turning into seven giant mountains!

These seven enormous mountains were naturally the Myriad Realms Mountains.

Seven giant mountains, the heights were different.

Three of them had uneven heights, but the other four were the same height.

When everyone saw the situation, they were uncertain about this, but then they heard Ye Yuan speaking. He said, “From now on, the Myriad Realms Mountain will have the name changed to Chaos Heavenly Spirit List, divided into heaven, earth, mystic, and yellow, these four lists. They will be situated here forever! I’ll engrave the fallen souls on it, recording their contributions for people to pay homage to them! From now on, those who rendered great contributions to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven can all get on the list and be worshiped by everyone! Those who offend the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List will be exterminated!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan took a drop of fresh blood from Feng Xiaotian’s body and flew to the highest peak.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Sword intent crisscrossed, Ye Yuan engraved Feng Xiaotian’s name on the highest level of the heaven list.

‘Feng Xiaotian,’ these three large gilded characters, appeared in the most eye-catching position very soon.

These three words actually had a soul-stirring feeling.

It was as if Feng Xiaotian had revived on the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List!

Following that, Ye Yuan engraved Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang’s names on the heaven list.

Ye Yuan was very patient, carving one name after another on the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List.

These people were all people that he had once known. But now, they were already separated by life and death.

The reason why Ye Yuan took this action was that he was inspired by the Extreme Light Pavilion.

Ye Yuan valued relationships. He did not hope for these heroic spirits, who shed their blood and laid down their lives, to be forgotten by people along with time.

.

Therefore, he would rather abandon the Myriad Realms Mountain, this chaos heavenly treasure that had just been successfully refined. He had to do something.

Ye Yuan’s engraved very seriously. Each stroke and each line, they showed his seriousness.

Everyone looked at him with respectful faces.

Many people’s faces had their eyes brimmed over with hot tears.

The names that Ye Yuan engraved, many of them were comrades who had once fought shoulder to shoulder with them.

When the names were engraved, it was as if they felt that that person had not gone far away yet.

But, what shocked them even more, was that Ye Yuan actually knew so many people!

Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was not high, he possessed a paramount position in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Even those whose strength reached Hegemon Realm might not be able to enter his eyes too.

They naturally would not extravagantly hope that Ye Yuan could remember their names.

But only at this time did they understand that Ye Yuan was actually very familiar with everyone. It was as if he was enumerating his family’s valuables!

“I really didn’t expect that Heavenly Saint Ye is actually so observant about the feelings of the masses!”

“Wang Dong and Li Xian and the few of us, we were just very unremarkable few people who followed Heavenly Saint Ye in the Labyrinth Divine Palace back then. Didn’t expect that he actually remembered us all!”

“In terms of contributions, no one’s contribution is greater than Heavenly Saint Ye’s! But he abandoned a chaos heavenly treasure and actually gave all the credit to others! He really is … a man of great talent and virtue!”

“Take care, brothers! You guys, rest assured. Your Father definitely won’t taint everyone’s awe-inspiring reputations! I only hope that one day, Your Father can enter the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List too!”

…..

Seeing Ye Yuan like this, everyone felt inexplicably touched.

Nearly ten thousand people entered the Labyrinth Divine Palace together with Ye Yuan back then.

Those who stood out among the rest and stepped into Hegemon Realm were just the minority after all.

But they did not expect that Ye Yuan actually even remembered those unremarkable people clearly.

This sort of thing, they believed that no leader in the 33 Heavens could do this!

What did this show?

This showed that Ye Yuan would not look down on anyone!

The achievements of a general were built on the dead bodies of countless soldiers. To the leaders, those weaklings were only the stepping stones on their path to corroborate their Dao.

No leader would take them seriously.

This was unless you were outstanding enough.

But Ye Yuan was different. He treated everyone equally.

Whether or not you were outstanding or mediocre, he would not look down on you.

These names were clear proof!

Forget about others; just talking about Mi Tian, could he even name the Dragon Clan’s Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses?

Impossible!

To Mi Tian, the level difference for Emperor Sakra Heaven was too great!

Mi Tian arrived next to Cloudmount and said with a sigh, “This boy, how does he not make people be ground to pieces for his sake? Following him, there will be no regrets in death too! I think that Feng Xiaotian thinks so too, right?”

Cloudmount nodded his head seriously and said, “What this old man is proudest of in this life is accepting this disciple! Lord Mi Tian, what on earth did you sense just now?”

Mi Tian’s expression flickered and he said with a sigh, “Heavenly Dao’s hidden anger. Ye Yuan’s tribulation of Hegemon will likely surpass everyone’s imaginations! Although he’s monstrous, but …”

But what Mi Tian did not say caused Cloudmount’s expression to become very ugly.

Very clearly, Mi Tian was very pessimistic about Ye Yuan.

The present Ye Yuan was able to kill the Peak Hegemon Bloodpromise with the Heaven Trampling Five Steps. It could be seen how monstrous he was.

But, even such a person like Ye Yuan, Mi Tian did not find it optimistic. What did this mean?

Cloudmount said worriedly, “What in the world will happen?”

Mi Tian shook his head and said, “The more one reaches my level of realm, the more one feels that Heavenly Dao is fleeting and ephemeral. Yi Xue and I merely sensed something, that’s all. Just how his tribulation of Hegemon will be like, nobody knows. This is because there has never been a divergent cultivator who has achieved Ye Yuan’s strength! Even Heaven is envious of his strength! However, the hidden anger of Heavenly Dao struck deep terror into me. If Heavenly Dao punishes me, I’m afraid that … I won’t have the slightest strength to fight back! Ye Yuan’s tribulation of Hegemon is likely fraught with grim possibilities!”

Cloudmount’s heart sank to rock-bottom. This piece of news was really terrible!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan was still carving names with each stroke and line.

But, from far away, Zhuo Bufan’s pupils constricted. He felt that the aura on Ye Yuan’s body changed!
