Chapter 2784: A Game!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Within the valley of the island, rumbling sounds lingered incessantly.

The expressions of the group of Saint Sovereign Heavens also changed slightly.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon was well-deserving of being a veteran Saint Sovereign Heaven. His strength was truly shocking and was actually even stronger than Waycloud!

After around two hours, Saint Exalt Bull Demon also came while panting.

“Ye Yuan, can this exalt’s strength still enter your sights?” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said in a solemn voice.

In order to show his strength, he risked his old life this time too.

The distance that he dashed forward was a great deal more than that of Saint Exalt Waycloud.

However, this stream of sword energy was really strong!

Rainclear Continent’s number one person back then, Zhuo Bufan, was really not for show!

Even if it was sword energy that had been left before for tens of thousands of years, he actually could not break through it!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Bull Demon’s strength is indeed extraordinary! I’m afraid that among this Rainclear Continent’s true spirits, apart from Big Yellow, you’re the strongest!”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon gave a cold snort but did not justify anything.

Ever since Big Yellow followed Ye Yuan, his strength advanced at a tremendous pace. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Especially that Coquettish Profligate Hoof. Although the posture was very strange, the power was really strong.

If Saint Exalt Bull Demon faced off against Big Yellow, he would most likely lose.

“Humph!?Don’t just be all bark and no bite! Ye Yuan, we’ve already gone down to play. Since you want to take us down a notch, shouldn’t you go down and play yourself too?” Waycloud said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan was not in a hurry either, saying with a smile, “Two fellow daoists, what do you think about this sword energy?”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon snorted coldly and said, “This sword energy is unparalleledly overbearing. The deeper you go, the stronger it becomes! Even if a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven comes, it’s impossible to make it through too!”

Waycloud smiled coldly and said, “Zhuo Bufan’s work is naturally extremely strong! Within Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm, no one can make it past this sword energy at all! However, what does that have to do with you? Don’t tell me that this sword energy was left behind by you!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head as he smiled and said to Luo Yunqing, “Brother Luo, let me borrow your sword!”

Luo Yunqing directly threw his sword to Ye Yuan without a word.

The Dragon Spring Sword had already been completely disintegrated when killing Li Changsheng.

Ye Yuan caught Luo Yunqing’s sword. No one saw him make any flashy moves either. It was just a light swing.

Boom!

The seawater directly had a large gulf being cleaved apart!

And this sword directly passed through the rift area of the island, joining together with Zhuo Bufan’s sword!

But very soon, the ocean healed, and everything returned to tranquility, as if nothing had happened.

The faces of everyone present changed abruptly.

The eyes of Luo Yunqing and Big Yellow and the others it up.

“What a powerful sword! This sword of yours actually directly replaced the sword energy left behind by Lord Zhuo! This shows that your sword is stronger than Lord Zhuo’s sword!” Luo Yunqing praised heavily.

“Huhu,?this sword has experienced several tens of thousands of years. It no longer has the sharpness of back then long ago! I’m afraid that seven parts out of ten parts of Zhuo Bufan’s sword is gone, with only 30% of its power left!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Ye Yuan was modest, but those present were all powerhouses. How could they not discern this sword’s fierceness?

Ye Yuan actually used his own sword energy and replaced Zhuo Bufan’s sword energy!

Yes, it was replaced!

This sword of Ye Yuan’s seemed casual. But actually, the angle of executing the move completely superimposed with Zhuo Bufan’s sword.

But the power was even stronger!

Not only did he erase Zhuo Bufan’s sword energy, he even replaced Zhuo Bufan’s sword energy with his own sword energy!

What was even scarier was that the two islands were not damaged in the slightest!

This sword move, the requirement toward the swordsman was hair-raisingly strict.

Even if one’s power was sufficient, if there was the slightest mistake, it could only incur derision too.

But Ye Yuan did it perfectly!

This was an extremely terrifying sword move!

The expressions of the Saint Sovereign Heavens present changed one after another.

Logically speaking, this sword could only be achieved by Great Dao Transformation powerhouses.

But Ye Yuan clearly did not transform Great Dao just now. How could he unleash such a frightening sword?

What was even more damning was that Ye Yuan was too effortless just now!

Who knew whether he used his full strength or not?

If he did not, then just how strong was his current strength?

Waycloud and the rest no longer dared to continue imagining.

In front of absolute strength, numbers were merely clay chickens and pottery dogs!

Back then, if not for Ye Yuan severely wounding Li Changsheng with Dao tribulation, even 60 Saint Sovereign Heavens would not be enough. Even if 80 came, it was no use either!

Now, this sword of Ye Yuan’s was enough to disregard numbers!

This opening gambit was really too big!

Ye Yuan threw the sword back to Luo Yunqing and said to Waycloud and the others smilingly, “Anyone else going down to play again? This Ye also doesn’t know how big the gap is between the sword energy that I left behind compared to Zhuo Bufan’s. I hope that someone can help me appraise it.”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces changed one after another.

What was this playing at?

Seeing that no one spoke, Ye Yuan smiled and said again, “Just playing a game! As long as you all make it into the rift, our grudges from before will be written off. How’s that?”

Waycloud’s expression turned dark, and he said, “Is this true?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This Ye has always kept my word!”

Waycloud’s gaze swept, looking at one of the Saint Sovereign Heaven, he said, “Ming Yi, you go!”

Ming Yi’s expression changed wildly, and he said, “Based on what that it’s me?”

Waycloud sneered and said, “Based on the fact that your strength is the weakest! Otherwise, you can try fighting us!”

Saint Exalt Ming Yi was the Saint Sovereign Heaven of a great heavenly sect too. However, he was just a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven. His strength was the weakest.

He looked towards the other Saint Sovereign Heavens and discovered that Skyfortune and the rest seemed to have this intention too.

With this, he had no choice!

Ming Yi gritted his teeth and said, “Alright!”

Finished saying, he leaped and charged over.

As soon as he entered the range of the sword energy, Ming Yi felt that something was not right.

This sword energy was too sharp!

The sword energy poured over from all directions, virtually leaving him unable to resist!

And this was still several tens of thousands of feet away from the rift area!

However, he was a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse at any rate. Completely unleashing his strength, he forcefully shook the sword energy off.

Ming Yi went all out and charged toward the rift area crazily.

Pffft!

Very soon, Ming Yi was directly minced by the countless sword energy!

Waycloud and Bull Demon exchanged a glance, their complexions deathly pale.

This sword energy seemed to be unusual!

No matter how weak Ming Yi was, that was a Saint Sovereign Heaven too!

Even if he could not rush over, it was also not to the extent of being garroted at such a far distance, right?

Just now, Ming Yi only rushed to 20 thousand feet and was annihilated.

They could not feel the sharpness of the swift and fierce at all outside.

But they were not dumb. The power of Ye Yuan’s sword energy was significantly stronger than Zhuo Bufan’s sword energy!

How did this guy do it?

“Huhu,?it looks like Saint Exalt Ming Yi’s strength is somewhat lacking! Brother Waycloud, are you interested in going down to play again? I think that with your strength, it’s just about able to make it into the rift,” Ye Yuan looked towards Saint Exalt Waycloud and said with a smile.

Waycloud’s expression changed wildly!

A distance of 20 thousand feet, could he be this much stronger than Ming Yi?

He had no confidence!

After entering, it was likely difficult to want to come out again!

Suddenly, Waycloud directly knelt in front of Ye Yuan with a thud, and he cried tearfully, “Fellow Daoist Ye, I was wrong! S-Spare my measly life!”
