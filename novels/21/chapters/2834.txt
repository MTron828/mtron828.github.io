Chapter 2840: Standing By and Watching People Die!

“Master Zuo, take care!”

“You brat, this seat is at any rate Emperor Realm too. Don’t make that face as if it’s a parting of life and death, alright?”

“Huhu, Old Man Zuo, you accepted a good disciple!”

“Humph! Don’t talk rubbish. Ye Yuan’s current identity isn’t the same anymore!”

Emperor Dan Fei became embarrassed and immediately shut up.

The matter of Ye Yuan becoming Hegemon Cloudmount’s disciple, they knew about it too.

‘When they learned about this news from Zuo Chen, they were naturally shocked to the extreme.

Hegemon Cloudmount had not taken disciples for more than 100 thousand years already. This time, he actually came over personally for the sake of a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven!

It could be seen how highly he valued Ye Yuan.

Just as Emperor Dan Fei said, Ye Yuan’s current identity was different!

In terms of seniority, they had to call Ye Yuan grandmaster!

On the contrary, it was Zuo Chen who did not need to call him like this.

At this time, it was already time to leave.

The southern front was strained. Dan Fei and the other Emperor Realm powerhouses had to head to the southern front immediately to fight.

Meanwhile, Ye Yuan and a few others were going to the Extreme Medicine Sect.

After this parting, he also did not know whether they would meet again. Ye Yuan was naturally sentimental.

Zuo Chen played it down, but he knew that the southern front was very dangerous. Forget about Emperor Realm; even Hegemon Realms might fall too.

“Kid, over at the sect’s side, this seat has already made arrangements for you. After arriving at the sect, your Senior Apprentice Brother Hua Zong will arrange everything. This matter of Ancestor Cloudmount accepting you as a disciple, you shouldn’t publicize this matter either. His identity is too exalted.

He’s the thom in the blood race’s side. Once exposed, the blood race will definitely kill you at any cost. Therefore, you’re still this seat’s disciple on the surface. Understand?” Zuo Chen exhorted.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This disciple understands!”

The two groups of people split up. Ye Yuan brought Yang Qing and the others, and they headed straight to the Extreme Medicine Sect.

The Extreme Medicine Sect was located at East Victory Mountain Range, east of the Heaven One Continent.

The landscape was endowed with natural spirits, gathering heaven and earth spiritual energy, being a holy land for cultivation.

The Heaven One Continent was extremely vast. Something as large as the Rainclear Continent was only one-ten thousandth as the Heaven One Continent.

The Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s three vast continents, plus the area of the ocean, was simply immeasurable.

On the three continents, there were originally seven great Hegemon level sects.

The Heaven One Continent had the most. It had three, and the Extreme Medicine Sect was one of them.

However, four out of the seven great sects had been destroyed. Now, there was only the Heaven Seeking Sect, Extreme Medicine Sect, and Nine Suns Sect left.

And the blood race marched north. Nine Suns Sect was the first to bear the brunt. Most of its territory was occupied by the blood race.

In the past, the seven great sects were divided. When it came down to race extermination, they had no choice but to join forces too.

It was also under this kind of circumstances that Hegemon Realm powerhouses joined forces to build the Absolute Heaven Barrier and resist the enemy.

In contrast, the blow that the Extreme Medicine Sect suffered was actually not considered great.

Therefore, the current Extreme Medicine Sect was still a prosperous scene.

‘When Ye Yuan and the rest passed through the transmission array and reached East Victory Mountain Range, it was already half a month later.

“Tsk tsk, truly well-deserving of being a Hegemon level sect! This magnificence, this aura, in the future, I, Hegemon Azuresky, will definitely dominate here!” Yang Qing looked at that magnificent hall that towered into the clouds and said passionately.

“Pfft!” Big Yellow and Jingfei two people both laughed at the same time.

Yang Qing’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “What are you guys laughing about? This sovereign has already stepped into True Sovereign Heaven. Within ten thousand years, this sovereign will definitely step into Hegemon Realm!”

Jingfei said gleefully, “Bullshit! If you want to say Big Brother Ye Yuan cultivating to Hegemon Realm, I’ll believe it. But you ... No chance!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Qing was furious and said to Ye Yuan, “Punk, come, come, come! Let’s fight one-on-one! If I don’t beat you until you kneel on the ground and beg for mercy, then I’m not called Sovereign Azuresky!”

Ye Yuan did not speak. Dao sword appeared indistinctly between his brows.

Yang Qing’s expression changed, and he hurriedly took a few steps back and said with a cautious look, “You’re acting shamelessly! What kind of hero are you considered by using the Dao sword?”

Ina frontal confrontation, after he stepped in True Sovereign Heaven, Ye Yuan was definitely not his match.

He was not an ordinary True Sovereign Heaven. In the previous great battle, he had once battled three people alone and even overpowered his opponents.

Although Ye Yuan was able to jump realms and battle, that also depended on who the target was.

True Sovereign Heavens were not to be trifled with.

But, if he used the Dao sword, that was completely different.

One had to know, back then, one sword from Ye Yuan cut down the middle True Sovereign Heaven Han Guang!

Therefore, when Ye Yuan utilized the Dao sword, Yang Qing immediately yielded.

When Jingfei saw the situation, she laughed herself even harder into fits and said, “What rubbish Sovereign Azuresky! You’re just relying on that your realm is a little higher. If you have the ability, fight with Big Brother Ye Yuan at the same realm! Big Brother Ye Yuan will give you a handicap of one hand.

Oh, no, give you a handicap of both hands and both legs and you’re not a match for him too!”

Yang Qing’s mouth curled, and he said disdainfully, “Humph! He’s just relying on that he’s a divergent cultivator. You rest assured. This sovereign absolutely won’t let him catch up! When he reaches Emperor Sakra Heaven, this sovereign would have already reached the Hegemon Realm! At that time, I’ll

ravage him then!”

Ye Yuan ignored Yang Qing and already drifted down, frowning slightly.

In front of the Extreme Medicine Sect’s gates, large batches of wounded people were gathering over from all directions, wails filling the land.

A youth who was injured all over carried another youth as he pleaded bitterly to an Extreme Medicine Sect disciple, “Extreme Medicine Sect’s living bodhisattvas, I beg you, let us enter! If my younger brother is still not saved, he’ll be dead for sure!”

The youth on his back was already on his dying breath, looking like he was about to kick the bucket.

But at this time, the Extreme Medicine Sect sent people to block his path and did not let these people go up the mountain at all.

‘The Extreme Medicine Sect disciple whom he was pleading with had an impatient look. Pushing him away, he said in a cold voice, “What’s the hurry? What’s the hurry? He’s merely a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven. Do you know how many people are waiting for treatment on the mountain now? Wait here.

If you dare to cause any more trouble, don’t blame us for not being courteous!”

‘When the youth who got pushed saw his younger brother’s appearance, his heart burned with anxiety, and he directly knelt down to that Extreme Medicine Sect disciple and said, “Your Excellency, I beg you, save my younger brother! He only became like this because of fighting with the blood race at

Absolute Heaven Barrier! You ... You can’t stand by and watch people die!”

‘The Extreme Medicine Sect disciple smiled coldly and said, “In that case, you’re all heroes? Open your damn eyes and take a look. Of those that the Extreme Medicine Sect is treating now, who isn’t a hero resisting the blood race? Go away! Keep causing trouble and you’ll be killed without amnesty!”

Clank!

That Extreme Medicine Sect disciple drew his blade, a cold aura swept out and made everyone’s expressions change.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Right at this time, the youth’s younger brother suddenly vomited large mouthfuls of blood, his eyes rolling up, looking as if it was hopeless for him.

The youth’s expression changed greatly and he said in a panic, “Zhang Yi, you ... you have to hold on! We ... We’re already reached the Extreme Medicine Sect. They will definitely save you!”

That Extreme Medicine Sect disciple’s expression was indifferent. Clearly, he did not have the intention of stepping forward to heal him.

All around, many people had looks of lament and resentment, all glaring at the Extreme Medicine Sect disciple angrily.

But they clearly did not care.

Just some ants, what could they do to them?

These days, the southern front had fallen into a frenzied great battle. The blood race launched wave and wave of assault, Heaven One’s side suffered heavy casualties.

As the number one alchemy sect, the people coming to the Extreme Medicine Sect to seek medicinal treatment naturally came and went in endless streams.

The entire Extreme Medicine Sect had already reached a state of full load operations. They seriously could not accommodate so many people anymore.

Hence, they naturally had to choose who to treat.

The army that the southern front formed, those were all the various major sects’ disciples, their strength far surpassing these itinerant cultivators.

But the real numbers were still these nameless itinerant cultivators.

They might not be strong, but they also formed all kinds of organizations and were killing the enemy on the front line.

These people in front of them were firstly without background, and secondly, they were without strength. They would naturally be stopped outside the mountain pass gates.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan arrived next to the youth’s younger brother with a flash.

It was only to see stars lit up. The Xuanji Nine Leaves suddenly activated.

One divine essence needle after another entered Zhang Yi’s body. Very soon, Zhang Yi stopped puking blood, and his aura also became much more uniform..
