Chapter 2935: Digging Your Own Grave!

In the passageway, light shone.

Two figures slowly walked out of the passageway.

“Eastsun leads Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall and pays respect to Lord Cloudneon! Paying respect to Young Hegemon Feng Rui!” Eastsun led Westdawn and the rest to bow to the two people.

The arrival was a woman who was peerlessly beautiful with an extraordinary temperament.

Meanwhile, the youth behind her had an arrogant and unyielding look on his face.

These Great Emperors in front of him seemed to be utterly worthless in his eyes.

Cloudneon nodded slightly and said, “Brother Eastsun has trained a lot.”

Eastsun repeated that he did not dare.

In the crowd, Ye Yuan sized Cloudneon up with interest.

He heard that this woman was hailed as one of the few people closest to Hegemon Realm in the soul race.

In the soul race, her status was extraordinary.

She seemed to be a heavenly fairy amidst the group of powerhouses, unable to be touched.

Arriving at Nirvana Soul Hall, the group of people sat down according to guest and host.

Cloudneon saw the Ye Yuan in the crowd with a glance and was rippleless like an ancient well as she said, “Is the one that’s suspected to be Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique that you talked about, him?”

Eastsun said, “Lord Cloudneon’s eyes are like torches. He’s Ye Yuan!”

“Master, don’t need to look anymore. It must be a Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique too! These guys from the outside world like to kick up a big fuss when they see a special soul physique every few thousand or tens of thousands of years. They don’t know that our Imperishable Soul Domain will have a special soul physique appear every 80 or 100 years. God knows how many Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physiques such as this have already appeared. Do these country bumpkins really think that Ancestor Imperishable’s soul physique is what everyone can awaken?” Feng Rui said with a disdainful look.

The moment these words came out, everyone present was extremely shocked.

Every 80 to 100 years, a special soul physique would emerge?

This rate was also too high, right?

Didn’t that mean that in the Imperishable Soul Domain, geniuses like Ye Yuan were everywhere?

They discovered that Feng Rui’s one sentence already subverted their worldview!

When Feng Rui saw their expressions, he had a disdainful look as he said, “What do 80 to 100 years count for? In the recent ten years, Imperishable Soul Domain gave birth to seven special soul physiques! There was even one that’s second only to Ancestor Imperishable’s Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!”

Everyone stared dumbfoundedly. Even Great Emperor Eastsun had a stunned look too.

Were special soul physiques so worthless?

In reality, they all, these Nirvana Soul Halls’ hall masters, knew extremely little about the Imperishable Soul Domain’s matters too.

Without special circumstances, they did not have the qualifications to enter the Imperishable Soul Domain.

They were merely tools that the Imperishable Soul Domain used to rule the world.

Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall was short on talents, so they were marginalized even more. They knew absolutely nothing about the Imperishable Soul Domain’s matters.

“But … But Hegemon Heaven Subduer he …”

“Heh,?do you all really think that Hegemon Heaven Subduer could corroborate his Dao and become a Hegemon Realm just by relying on his soul physique? If Hegemon Realm was so easy, Master would have long stepped into Hegemon Realm!” Feng Rui said with a cold smile.

Cloudneon said coolly, “Feng Rui isn’t bluffing you guys. Special soul physiques are indeed nothing in the Imperishable Soul Domain. Of course, soul physiques had weak ones and strong ones. Hegemon Heaven Subduer’s Tyrant Heaven Soul Physique is indeed extremely strong, that’s how it could help him step into Hegemon Realm. But the weak ones aren’t even as good as ten wroughts!”

Cloudneon did not say too much. Clearly, she felt that even if they knew these things, it was useless too.

These words seemed to have opened another door for everyone.

Only then did they know that it turned out soul physiques still had so many things involved.

It was just that special soul physiques were extremely far away from them to begin with.

As for Hegemon Realm and whatnot, it was even further beyond reach.

At this time, Great Emperor Eastsun let out a slight sigh in his heart. He no longer harbored any hopes that Ye Yuan was of the Imperishable Soul Physique.

They already said that this kind of pseudo soul physique was plentiful.

“So that’s how it is. Eastsun has received the teachings. However, Ye Yuan killed a ten wroughts powerhouse with just one look. His soul physique shouldn’t be weak, right?” Eastsun said.

“Pffft!”

Feng Rui could not resist laughing and said, “Does a mere ten wroughts from your outside world count as some powerhouse too? Just a thought is enough for me to kill a ten wroughts! Kid, display your soul physique and let Master take a look. As long as it isn’t a trash soul physique, you can go with us.”

That attitude was just like coming to put on a monkey show. Ye Yuan’s brows could not refrain from furrowing.

When Eastsun saw Ye Yuan frowning, he urged, “Ye Yuan, hurry up and display your soul physique. What are you still in a daze for? Lord Cloudneon has arrived. This is a rare opportunity!”

Ye Yuan still remained silent.

When Feng Rui saw the situation, he smiled coldly and said, “Put away that pitiful pride of yours! The more powerful the soul physique, the weaker the pseudo soul physique tends to be! If there are no accidents, you should be of the trashiest low-grade yellow rank soul physique! Gave you face and you still refused it! Don’t blame me for not warning you. With how you are, if you go to the Imperishable Soul Domain, apart from being beaten to death by people, there are no other paths to take!”

Ye Yuan still did not speak. He looked toward Great Emperor Cloudneon.

Great Emperor Cloudneon said coolly, “Rumors often tend to be false. You’d best display it.”

At this time, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said, “I wonder what rank Young Hegemon Feng Rui’s soul physique is?”

Feng Rui snickered and said proudly, “I knew that you’d ask this! Listen up. Don’t piss your pants in fear! Soul physiques are divided into heaven, earth, mystic, and yellow, four ranks. Each rank is further divided into upper, middle, and low, three grades. This young hegemon’s snickering is of the middle-grade heaven rank!”

The moment these words came out, the Nirvana Soul Hall instantly exploded.

Only at this time did they know that the disparity between special soul physiques was actually so great!

The division of soul physiques did not spread to the outside world.

It was because to the outside world, there was no need at all.

This time, everyone in the Nirvana Soul Hall finally broadened their knowledge.

However, what amazed them even more was that Feng Rui’s grade was actually so high!

“Sigh,?we even thought that Ye Yuan was already the soul race’s number one genius! It turns out that it was us who were ignorant and ill-informed!”

“Yeah, Ye Yuan is somewhat bringing disgrace on his own head.”

“Imperishable Soul Domain’s geniuses are indeed not what we can imagine!”

… …

At this time, they no longer harbored any hopes about Ye Yuan.

Previously, they thought that Ye Yuan’s soul physique was one of a kind. Furthermore, he killed Qin Shitian with one move. It naturally had a possibility of being the Imperishable Soul Physique.

But looking at it now, it was virtually certain that it was the Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique.

Furthermore, it was even a trash soul physique!

But Ye Yuan was aloof and indifferent, and he said coolly, “Is that so? Since Young Hegemon Feng is so formidable, then there’s no harm in verifying whether or not my soul physique is really trash.”

Didn’t you want to play monkey?

Then, come down and play together!

When have I, Ye Yuan, been scared of anyone before?

Even if it was a Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physique, so what? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Feng Rui’s gaze turned cold, and he said, “Boy, although you’re a trash soul physique, and it’s nothing in the Imperishable Soul Domain either. But awakening a soul physique in the outside world isn’t an easy matter after all! Letting this young hegemon come and verify, you probably can’t afford to bear the consequences!”

Ye Yuan was provoking his majesty as Young Hegemon!

Furthermore, he, Feng Rui, was an Emperor Realm powerhouse!

A mere ant dared to provoke his dignity too!

Ye Yuan just said coolly, “Relax. I can afford to bear it! Young Hegemon Feng, please make a move!”

Feng Rui gave a cold laugh and said, “Very well, since you’re digging your own grave, then this young hegemon will send you off!”
