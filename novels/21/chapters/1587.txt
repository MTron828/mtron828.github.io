1591 Undergo a Complete Change

This third round was naturally competing on pill refinement.

This round did not have any trickery to talk about. It was totally competing in raw power.

But Ye Yuan was not worried about Ning Siyu.

The current Ning Siyu was already no longer the past Ning Siyu.

She had experienced his Dao Realm pill refining several times altogether and also had his special training. If she could not refine a high-grade medicinal pill, then Ye Yuan would go and knock his head to death.

Of course, it was also that Ning Siyu had astonishing comprehension ability. That was why Ye Yuan would choose her.

If it were others, even if he let them observe his Dao Realm pill refinement, wanting to make rapid progress within a short time could not be done no matter what.

One had to know, the first time Ning Siyu saw Ye Yuan’s Dao Realm pill refinement, she could already refine high-grade Meridian Heaven Heart Pill.

“Qiyang, this round is your forte. You definitely can’t lose anymore.”

Ruo Xu could not sit still anymore. Making use of the resting interval, he personally went down the grandstand and called Song Qiyang to his side, personally instructing.

A hint of panic flashed across in Song Qiyang’s eyes. He did not think that he would lose so thoroughly today.

For so many years, his eyes had always been at the top of his head, totally looking down on alchemists in the same rank.

But now, he was utterly defeated at the hands of a little girl.

He started to doubt life!

“Master, I ... the first two were also my forte! Furthermore, the second round, I even practiced before in advance. But in the end ...” Song Qiyang said rather dispiritedly.

Ruo Xu’s face fell and he said, “Although I didn’t catch any evidence, the first two rounds, they definitely have suspicions of winning through unorthodox ways! But the third round is honest-to-goodness pill refinement. That punk absolutely can’t make Ning Siyu this lass undergo a complete change! You don’t need to think too much, this third round, as long as you perform as per usual, you’ll win for sure. Make sure not to be affected by before!”

Song Qiyang sucked in a deep breath and said with a nod, “I know what I should do, Master!”

“You know my ass! If you also lose this third round, don’t call me your master anymore in the future!”

Done talking, Ruo Xu flicked his sleeves and left, leaving behind Song Qiyang transfixed like a wooden chicken.

What kind of visual prowess did Ruo Xu have, how could he not see that Song Qiyang’s thoughts were wavering right now?

Hence, that was why Ruo Xu dealt this harsh action to him, making Song Qiyang pull himself together.

Ruo Xu spent a lot of effort on Song Qiyang, how could he bear to really chase him out of his tutelage?

“Third round, pill refining! The medicinal pill that you all have to refine is the Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill!” the deacon said.

The Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill was a thunder-attribute medicinal pill. The difficulty of refining was very high; virtually comparable to the Gale Celestial Stone Pill.

The difficulty of medicinal pill was an unprecedented challenge to everyone.

But in this third round, Ning Siyu was clearly at a disadvantage.

After all, she was just middle-stage Origin Deity. She was much worse in terms of divine essence.

These medicinal pills that are harder to refine, and the expenditure on divine essence was also enormous.

“I wonder if this third round, Ning Siyu can still create a miracle or not!”

“If there weren’t the first two rounds, I think that Ning Siyu definitely can’t! But now, I’m really looking forward to it!”

“I heard some time back that Ning Siyu assailed the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill bitterly and failed to get results. This Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill is much harder than the Meridian Heaven Heart Pill, can she really do it?”

“If Elder Ye can even teach pill refinement, then the front door of Ye Manor will definitely be packed until it bursts tomorrow.”

...

In the first two rounds, everyone was not optimistic about Ning Siyu. But they did not expect that Ning Siyu became the greatest dark horse, crushing the top seeded contestant, Song Qiyang, until he was black and blue all over.

This third round, everyone naturally also looked forward to it.

But some who knew the inside story heard before about Ning Siyu’s Alchemy Dao strength, and hence, started somewhat doubting it.

With the pill refinement round starting, everyone cast their whole attention into pill refinement, but Ning Siyu did not move.

Ye Yuan told her, don’t be impatient, before refining the pill, recall the many times of observations properly, carefully recall the Dao accumulations back then, and adjust your state to the pinnacle.

Ning Siyu readily obeyed Ye Yuan’s words, so she was not in a hurry to move.

“Mn? What’s this girl doing? She knows that she can’t refine it, so she’s deliberately disrupting my mind?”

Song Qiyang’s state of mind was unsettled and kept on not being able to let go of thinking about Ning Siyu.

Ning Siyu’s strange action naturally landed in his eyes very quickly.

He was already somewhat doubting life now. Seeing this scene, he was even more anxious and doubtful.

“Humph!”

Ruo Xu suddenly snorted coldly. Song Qiyang abruptly startled awake, and plunge into pill refining.

“Head Elder, this action ... is likely not compliant with the rules, right?” Xuan Yu suddenly opened his eyes and said coolly.

Ruo Xu’s face did not turn red, nor did his heart beat faster as he said coolly, “What did this old man do?”

He clearly made Song Qiyang calm his thoughts through this cold snort. Now, he actually refused to admit it without blushing.

The other elders also felt that this action was somewhat overboard. It was just that they dared to be angry, but they did not dare to speak.

Xuan Yu froze and immediately kept his mouth shut.

This guy’s skin was seriously too thick.

Ye Yuan glanced at Ruo Xu, but did not make a sound.

While at this time, Ning Siyu suddenly opened her eyes and started the pill refinement!

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, nodding his head to himself.

This girl’s comprehension ability was even better than he thought.

Only to see Ning Siyu’s actions akin to floating clouds and flowing water – natural and smooth, accomplishing things at one go, with quite the air of a master.

Quite a few elders emitted a light gasp, clearly being attracted by Ning Siyu.

The realm of the elders present were all very high and could discern the level of superiority at a glance.

Ning Siyu’s current state already reached a kind of ethereal state, no distractions in her mind.

Under such a state, pill refinement could clearly yield twice the results with half the effort.

“Siyu this lass seems to really be different!”

“Could it be that Elder Ye really has this level of means to turn something rotten into something magical?”

“If Siyu this girl really refines the Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill, that would be incredible!”

...

The group of elders gasped in wonder one after another. They knew that Ning Siyu really could not be compared to in the past anymore.

Regardless of the final result, Song Qiyang’s title of number one person among Three-star disciples would likely have to be handed over on a silver platter.

In contrast, even though Song Qiyang forcefully reigned in his thoughts, his state of mind was already flustered. It was very hard to unleash all of his strength.

His strength would likely be greatly reduced.

Time slowly trickled by, due to the reason of her realm being lacking, Ning Siyu was dripping with sweat, somewhat straining.

But, her entire person was in a mysterious state and did not detect it at all.

She only had one thought right now, that was to refine the medicinal pill.

Suddenly, she chirped.

“Condense!”

She was the last to take action among everyone, but the very first to finish!

Amidst the crowd, waves of exclamations came over.

They did not expect that Ning Siyu really refined the Crimson Thunder Heavenly Spirit Pill.

Even she herself looked towards Ye Yuan with an excited face.

She knew that all these changes were brought to her by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan flashed her a slight smile to show her affirmation, making Ning Siyu extremely agitated.

Before long, Song Qiyang’s medicinal pill was also about to congeal.

“Humph!”

But right at the critical moment, Ye Yuan suddenly emitted a cold snort from his nasal cavity. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Song Qiyang seemed to have his throat clutched, instantly suffocating.
