1575 I Understand Heaven Better Than You!

Heavenly Sin also had the intention of demonstrating his strength to Li-er. Pointing a finger out at this time, the winds and clouds changed colors.

Fang Tian was still in midair and felt as if the end of the world had arrived.

This was the genuine might of the Heavenly Dao!

Whatever heavenly tribulation, whatever soul tribulation, it totally paled in comparison in front of this finger.

“This ... What kind of power is this?!”

“Too terrifying. Even that battle between Ye Yuan and Kanuo back then, it’s also not enough to look at in front of this finger!”

“It’s over! This time, it’s utterly over! Our Immortal Grove Region is really plagued with misfortune. It’s just been 100 years and such a scrounge actually appeared again!”

The faces of the Law Enforcement Hall’s people all revealed looks of despair.

Back then, there was still Ye Yuan overturning the raging tides in an overwhelming manner.

But now, who else could block in front of them?

Fang Tian was the first. After that, there would still be a second, a third.

In front of this finger, Fang Tian could not muster up the thought to resist at all.

He could not even thought about surviving at all!

At this moment, he only wanted to return peace of mind to himself.

He knew that no one could escape a disaster today. He could not, Yue Mengli could not as well.

Hence, he at the very least could not helplessly watch Li-er die in front of him.

“Ye Yuan, I’m sorry, I have no way of protecting Li-er.”

Fang Tian slowly shut his eyes, waiting for the arrival of death.

In an instant, that breathtaking finger arrived in front of Fang Tian’s face.

Everyone shut their eyes. They could not bear to see the death of this Immortal Grove Region’s leader.

“En? This ... What’s going on?”

Right at this time, someone suddenly exclaimed.

Heavenly Sin’s finger carried the might of Heavenly Dao. When it arrived in front of Fang Tian, it actually disappeared directly.

At this moment, the three feet area in front of Fang Tian seemingly cut off to become two different worlds.

That world raged like a storm, heaven and earth changed colors. This world was calm and peaceful. There was tranquility.

Fang Tian suddenly felt that that horrifying pressure on his body actually vanished, and he couldn’t help it but to open both eyes.

He was stunned by this scene!

This ... What was going on?

Heavenly Sin’s gaze turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Who is it? Get out for this venerated self!”

At this moment, everyone’s face revealed puzzled looks.

Could it be that this Immortal Grove Region still had someone who could be Heavenly Sin Heretic God’s match?

“What’s going on here? Could it be Senior Kunwu taking action?”

White Light looked at Yue Mengli in surprise but discovered that her beautiful body was trembling incessantly. Her face revealed an excited red glow.

Just as White Light was completely bewildered, he heard Yue Mengli with an extremely excited voice saying, “He ... came back!”

White Light froze and said, “Who? Who came back?”

Yue Mengli said agitatedly, “It’s Big Brother Yuan! Big Brother Yuan came back!”

White Light’s entire body trembled. Right at this moment, there was a tremor in the void. Several figures stood in the air, facing Heavenly Sin Heretic God from afar.

That figure in the center, who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

Speaking of which was coincidental too, Ye Yuan and the rest were currently chatting idly above the East Sea when he felt the powerful undulation of Heavenly Dao.

This kind of undulation was what only the controller could have.

Virtually without the slightest hesitation, he immediately came here with a teleport and just happened to run into Heavenly Sin pointing a finger at Fang Tian, which he made a move to resolve.

Fang Tian’s entire body trembled and he said in disbelief, “Y-Ye Yuan! How is this possible?!”

Ye Yuan looked at Fang Tian and said with a smile, “Senior Fang Tian, I’ve let you get startled.”

After the astonishment, Fang Tian laughed loudly and said, “Good! Good! Good that you’re back! Haha!”

Everyone looked at that white-robed youth in the sky, full of shock.

Ye Yuan actually came back!

“Hahaha ... Ye Yuan came back! We’re saved!”

“Ye Yuan is really the Immortal Grove Region’s guardian god! With him around, we’re safe!”

“Ye Yuan always appears in the time of crisis. This time was not an exception either!”

“He ... He actually broke through to middle-stage Origin Deity! My god, he just left for 100 years and already broke through two major realms! This guy is really as freakish as ever!”

...

Ye Yuan’s appearance made everyone rouse themselves.

In their eyes, Ye Yuan was the savior!

However, not everyone was optimistic.

“Don’t be happy too early! Ye Yuan and Heavenly Sin are both controllers, but Heavenly Sin’s realm is two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan. This matter doesn’t bode well!” someone said with a solemn look.

With him saying so, everyone’s expression changed.

Heavenly Sin’s might, they had experienced it deeply. Was Ye Yuan really his match?

Seeing these people’s expressions and words, very quickly, Heavenly Sin understood just who this white-robed youth in front of him was.

“You’re the other Heavenly Dao controller? Looks ... so weak!” Heavenly Sin said with an evil smile on his face.

Although Ye Yuan’s appearance was somewhat unexpected, he was not worried.

The disparity between middle-stage Origin Deity and grand completion Origin Deity was too great!

Ye Yuan swept a glance over him and said icily, “Where are you, a trash, even from? To actually dare make a move against Senior Fang Tian?”

While talking, Ye Yuan’s gaze flitted to the Waveheaven Divine Carriage behind Heavenly Sin as well as those eight enormous dragons’ bodies. A surge of fury instantly combusted in his heart.

“Trash? An ant like you also dares to call this venerated self trash? Truly, the ignorant are fearless! Heh, you came just in time, this venerated self is going to take Li-er as my wife today. Since you came back, just nice, you can be a witness for us! Seeing your true love become somebody else’s wife, are you very furious? However, this venerated self just likes to see the appearance of other people angry, but helpless to do anything! Hahaha ... You rest assured, this venerated self won’t kill you today. This venerated self wants you to watch me and Li-er consummate our marriage!”

Talking until the exciting parts, Heavenly Sin could not resist letting loose a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan was very calm and did not blow his top like Heavenly Sin imagined.

But the people present were all too familiar with Ye Yuan. They all knew that Ye Yuan was truly enraged.

Furthermore, the wrath this time could probably burn the horizon!

This Heavenly Sin Heretic God was really too able to provoke! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Except, was Ye Yuan really Heavenly Sin Heretic God’s match?

Two minor realms might not count for anything when at the mortal realms.

But reaching Origin Deity Realm, this was two huge mountains; virtually unable to cross!

When Ye Yuan made a move to save Fang Tian, he did not know what happened. He even thought that the Law Enforcement Hall offended this great deity.

But with Heavenly Sin saying so, he completely understood.

Very good, there was actually someone who dared to provoke him like this!

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Sin calmly just like that and slowly opened his mouth and said, “Although I don’t know where you popped out from, but you’re really good! My wrath has already been suddenly ignited by you!”

Ye Yuan’s reaction made Heavenly Sin somewhat displeased.

He liked to see others be in a violent rage, then trample others underfoot.

Ye Yuan’s calmness made him lose some delight.

But no matter, he would make Ye Yuan really become enraged.

Heavenly Sin smiled evilly and said, “Brat, I know that you’re a Heavenly Dao controller too. But, there’s a gap in strength between controllers too! Remember, I understand heaven better than you!”
