1805 Kowtow and Apologize

“Are you all a bunch of pigs? Can’t even handle such a small matter! This time, you let Duan Qinghong that damn thing gets off cheap again!”

Inside a small room on Heavenly Bud Peak, Zhong Hanlin was currently bellowing at the Soaring Flower lineage’s disciples.

Clearly, he was very upset.

After 200 years of cultivation, Zhong Hanlin who had talent surpassing others already broke through to become a half-step Celestial Deity.

Just one more step and he could reach Celestial Deity Realm.

And he would also become the Soaring Flower lineage’s outer-sect number one person officially.

Duan Qinghong and he were running neck to neck, similarly becoming the Cloudsword lineage’s outer-sect number one person.

These two people had also been secretly competing all along.

Zhong Hanlin scolded the disciples fiercely. Suddenly, someone came to report, saying that someone outside was looking for him.

He gave a cold snort and said angrily, “You all just wait, you will all get it!”

The moment he went out the door, Zhong Hanlin saw Du Zichuan whose skin was flayed open, his flesh torn.

His face fell and he said, “Du Zichuan, who beat you until like this?”

Although Du Zichuan’s talent wasn’t much, he knew how to ingratiate himself to people very well and was also very reliable when doing things. So Zhong Hanlin liked him a lot.

One had to look at the master when beating a dog too. This Shadowmoon Sect actually still had someone who dared to touch his, Zhong Hanlin’s, people.

“It’s me.”

Behind Du Zichuan, a figure appeared.

Zhong Hanlin was just about to fly off the handle when he suddenly jumped up like he saw a ghost and said stammeringly, “Y-Y-You ... Why aren’t you dead?”

“You didn’t die, how could I dare die?”

Smack!

His voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan raised his hand like lightning and gave a slap.

Clear and resonant!

Caught off-guard, Zhong Hanlin was directly slapped by Ye Yuan until he looked for teeth on the ground.

Of course, even if he was prepared, it was also impossible to dodge this strike of Ye Yuan’s.

This scene immediately attracted a large group of disciples to surround and watch.

“Who is this person? To actually dare hit Zhong Hanlin, he doesn’t want to live anymore?”

“Never seen before! When did such a powerful existence appear among the outer-sect disciples?”

“Just now was just a sneak attack, right? With Zhong Hanlin’s strength, it’s impossible for him, a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, to be Zhong Hanlin’s match.”

...

Zhong Hanlin crawled to his feet and only felt the world spinning around, unable to find his bearing at all.

Only after swaying for a long time did he vaguely see Ye Yuan’s figure. He roared angrily, “You ... You actually dare to hit me? I’ll tell you very clearly, you ... you’ll die very miserably!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh, “These words, regardless whether it’s you, or Qian Ye, or Jiang Xueyan, you’ve said it many times already. But I’m still perfectly fine right now.”

Zhong Hanlin’s expression changed, his eyes swiveling around.

He knew that he was definitely not Ye Yuan’s match, so he could not muster up the thought to resist at all.

Back then when Ye Yuan was Sixth Firmament Divine Lord, he, a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, was already not a match.

The current Ye Yuan already skyrocketed, directly breaking through to become a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord. He, this half-step Celestial Deity, was not totally not enough to look at!

This bit, Zhong Hanlin was aware in his heart.

What he had to do right now was inform Qian Ye!

At this time, the Soaring Flower lineage’s disciples also all came out. He secretly made a hand gesture to one of his confidants.

That disciple understood and turned around and left.

How could this scene escape Ye Yuan’s eyes?

However, he did not stop him but allowed him to leave.

Today, Ye Yuan was hell-bent on blowing the matter up!

“Go, kowtow and apologize to my brother!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Zhong Hanlin was taken aback. Looking over in the direction Ye Yuan pointed, his expression could not help changing.

“Han Yong? You want me to kowtow and apologize to this trash? No way in hell! If you have the capabilities, kill me!”

Zhong Hanlin stuck his neck out, revealing an appearance of the situation being so bad that making it worse made no real difference.

Except, his words made everyone’s jaws hit the ground.

People around them were all outer-sect disciples, they naturally knew Zhong Hanlin’s might and also knew that he normally acted like a tyrant.

Today, being given a slap by someone, he actually did not even dare to resist!

Everyone used extremely shocked gazes to look at Ye Yuan. What kind of god was this unknown guy?

Smack!

Another slap!

The last time, it was the left side of the face. This time, it was the right side of the face!

Two slaps smacked out half of Zhong Hanlin’s teeth.

On his face, ten fingerprints could be seen clearly.

“Not going, slap until you go!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Zhong Hanlin gritted his teeth and said, “I’m not going! F*cking hell, do you really think that I am scared of you?”

Ye Yuan looked at Zhong Hanlin and smiled, smiled until his hair stood on ends, and he said, “If you feel that you can dodge, feel free and try!”

Finished talking, his hand raised up unhurriedly, Zhong Hanlin immediately went on full alert.

Then, Ye Yuan’s hand took his time to slap over.

Zhong Hanlin wanted to dodge, his movement technique swift as lightning!

At this moment, his half-step Celestial Deity strength was displayed in its entirety.

However ...

Smack!

Another incomparably clear slapping sound sounded out, Zhong Hanlin was smacked until he flew out horizontally.

“Going or not?” Ye Yuan asked again.

Not far away, Han Yong’s entire person was dumbfounded from watching.

Only all the way until today did he know how powerful Ye Yuan’s strength was!

In front of him, the Zhong Hanlin who was as powerful as a heavenly god actually did not have the slightest strength to retaliate under Ye Yuan’s hands.

He could not even dodge a slap from Ye Yuan.

These two people were not on the same order of magnitude at all.

That was a half-step Celestial Deity!

Even though half-step celestial deities were not as good as real Celestial Deity powerhouses, compared to Ninth Firmament Divine Lords, they were powerhouses from a totally different world.

But he was still like a fragile paper in front of Ye Yuan.

“Not talking, then I’ll take it as you’re not going!”

Ye Yuan said coolly and slapped again fiercely.

Zhong Hanlin was slapped until he saw stars, his entire head giddy.

Ye Yuan did not speak either, just smacking slap after slap like this.

Finally, Zhong Hanlin could not take it anymore.

He could not distinguish north, south, east, west at the moment. He quickly shouted, “Go! I’ll go!”

Zhong Hanlin knew that he could not hold out until Qian Ye arrived at all.

Now, there was only buying time.

When Qian Ye arrived, he would return it to Ye Yuan a thousand times over!

Being slapped four times in a row by Ye Yuan, Zhong Hanlin’s face swelled, turning into a pig’s head.

Only to see him stall for time step by step, practically shifting in front of Han Yong.

Ye Yuan’s gaze was sharp as he said in a cold voice, “Kneel down!”

Zhong Hanlin was beaten silly by Ye Yuan. Hearing these words, he could not hold on anymore and kneel down with a thud.

“What you should do, don’t need me to teach you, right?” Ye Yuan said coldly.

Zhong Hanlin hurriedly said, “No need, no need! Han Yong, I ... I’m sorry!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As he said, Zhong Hanlin apologized as he kowtowed.

Ye Yuan said coldly, “If I don’t make you stop, you’re not allowed to stop! Kowtow all the way until my brother is satisfied!”

How could Zhong Hanlin dare to stop? He kept on kowtowing just like that and kept apologizing.

When everyone saw this scene, all of them opened their mouths wide, eyes full of disbelief.

Since Zhong Hanlin entered the sect for over 200 years, it had always been him screwing with people. When was it other people’s turn to humiliate him like this?

But they also secretly broke into a sweat with fright for Ye Yuan. This was offending the Soaring Flower lineage’s people to the core!
