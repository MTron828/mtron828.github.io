Chapter 2340: Ye Yuan Who Keeps His Word

The spirit of the true dragon overlooked the world from above the firmament, showing disdain over everything in the world.

That kind of domineeringness carried the world before him!

Taking a step out, the world was shocked!

Boom!

Hills toppled and the earth quaked. The void trembled. Everyone’s countenances changed visibly.

These two people’s strength was really too fearsome.

This clashing of major moves was actually evenly matched!

Qin Hu’s strength was truly formidable, while Ye Yuan’s innate divine ability was a top-notch existence even in the Dragon Clan. Yet he actually only fought to a draw with him.

The strength of an unpredictable child was displayed to the fullest expression of its beauty and form on Qin Hu.

However, everyone’s shock was due to Ye Yuan.

The reason was very simple. Qin Hu was defeated!

The Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor Ye Yuan fought to a draw with the Fourth Firmament Heavenly Emperor Qin Hu!

This was enough to shock them.

“This innate divine ability is really terrifying! In the same rank, who can be his match?”

“This is a spatial-attribute innate divine ability, that’s one of the supreme innate divine abilities! Most likely, it’s a top existence in the Dragon Clan too!”

“Qin Hu even said that he was going to kill until this kid would not dare to leave the city. Looking at it now, it’s really a joke!”

“Looking at it like this, this newcomer kid, his strength should be ranked within 8000 at the lowest too!”

... ...

Just as everyone was exclaiming in amazement, Qin Hu suddenly spewed out a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his figure flying out backward.

Under the two people’s stalemate, it was finally still Qin Hu who was defeated!

This kind of confrontation had a tremendous impact force on the martial artist themselves to begin with.

It was true that Qin Hu was formidable, but how could he be as strong as Ye Yuan’s body?

Under the circumstances where their strength difference was not great, body-refining martial artists would almost certainly win!

With Ye Yuan gaining momentum in one move, he immediately chased after. He pursued in haste and pummeled fiercely.

Qin Hu was seriously injured. So how could he withstand this bout of beating? In a few blows, he was on his dying breath.

Everyone could not help feeling alarmed from watching. This kid was really vicious when making his move!

But in this place, everyone existed for god of war points, not being viscous would not do.

“Huhu,

thank you for your god of war points!” Ye Yuan looked at the half-dead Qin Hu and said with a light smile.

Qin Hu said with his dying breath, “Brat, don’t run if you have the capability! After I revive, I’ll come to find you to settle scores!”

He lost and was unconvinced!

His strength was clearly not weaker than Ye Yuan’s, but Ye Yuan relied on the advantage of his body to defeat him.

Moreover, with his god of war points, once he died once, the losses would be too great.

He could not swallow this insult!

Ye Yuan smiled slightly in his heart and was very satisfied with Qin Hu’s reaction.

As long as he employed the sword formation, annihilating Qin Hu would simply be effortless.

Fusing four kinds of power of laws was indeed powerful.

But no matter how strong, could it be stronger than the combination of two great source powers?

But why did he have to expend his strength and unfold a life-and-death struggle with Qin Hu?

He did it in order to make Qin Hu feel unwilling to submit!

It was in order to make Qin Hu come out to take revenge!

This way, he would be able to continue plundering god of war points.

Wasn’t he going to kill him until he did not dare to come out?

Fine then, I’ll kill you until you do not dare to come out!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan knew that Qin Hu definitely would not come out alone this time. He would definitely find a helper.

At that time, heh heh!

The current Ye Yuan could already predict the scene of god of war points rising rapidly.

“Okay, I’ll wait for you here!” Ye Yuan said with a calm expression.

Finished saying, with a bang, he finished Qin Hu off with a punch.

One cluster of runes after another entered Ye Yuan’s body, Ye Yuan’s eyes could not help lighting up.

So many god of war points!

Because Ye Yuan’s ranking was only 12,000 plus, but Qin Hu’s ranking was around 7000.

This huge difference let Ye Yuan obtain 40% of the other party’s god of war points!

Right now, Ye Yuan already had 1,480 points on him!

And his ranking already rose to rank 8,941 too.

Even Ye Yuan himself was also shocked by the points.

“Tsk tsk, really awesome!” Ye Yuan exclaimed.

Truly becoming a tycoon in an instant!

Seeing the expression on Ye Yuan’s face, everyone was incredibly envious in their hearts.

They knew that Ye Yuan definitely obtained a significant amount of god of war points!

In this Primeval War Realm, the stronger the opponent killed, the more the god of war points obtained.

But during these 100 years’ time, the rankings were actually already relatively stable.

Wanting to jump several thousand places to kill the opponent in front was simply a fool’s talk!

But Ye Yuan killed the formidable Qin Hu just like that and snatched so many god of war points like pulling a tooth from the tiger’s mouth.

However, Ye Yuan was currently meditating calmly on the spot and was actually really waiting for Qin Hu to come out. This made many people extremely surprised. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Was this kid a fool?

Could it be that he really thought that Qin Hu would fight one-on-one with him?

“Young man, hurry up and go! Qin Hu has a buddy in the city called Mo Xi. His strength is even a notch above his! You’re only waiting to die by being here!’ A kind-hearted person came forward to persuade him.

“Yeah, kid, don’t get too greedy! You waiting for him here is equivalent to waiting for death!”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept over and he said with a smile, “Many thanks for everyone’s warning, but this Ye said to wait for him, I won’t go back on my word and will wait here for him to come!”

When everyone saw that Ye Yuan did not listen to advice, they could not help shaking their heads and sighing.

This kid was really hopelessly headstrong!

It was useless even if he was strong, being brainless was too scary!

Except, the Yang Ke in the crowd was absorbed in thought.

“I really didn’t expect that this kid would be so formidable! However, heh heh, he’s a fool, to actually really wait here for Qin Hu to come back!” Peng Yang said.

But Yang Ke frowned and said, “Don’t you guys find it strange?”

Everyone was taken back, uncertain what it meant.

“What’s strange about it? This brat and Qin Hu are about on par. If add in Mo Xi, this kid will be dead for sure!”

“Yeah. His fleshy body is strong, but Qin Hu’s strength isn’t weak either! If he doesn’t leave now, it’s tantamount to seeking death!”

But Yang Ke shook his head and said, “I heard that he used all the god of war points that he snatched from us to buy swords! Furthermore, he bought over a thousand! But have you guys seen him draw a sword?”

The vast majority of the people neglected this problem!

Not that they deliberately overlooked it, but that the combat strength that Ye Yuan displayed made them believe in Ye Yuan’s strength strongly.

They felt that Ye Yuan’s strongest trump card should be the perfect rank eight golden body!

Ye Yuan relied on perfect rank eight and could already defeat the Qin Hu who fused four kinds of power of laws. It could be seen how monstrous he was.

Then did he still need other means?

But Yang Ke thought of this question!

He did not know how strong Ye Yuan’s sword arts were, but in this Primeval War Realm, there definitely would not be someone silly enough to spend all the god of war points on them to go and buy something useless!

Yang Ke’s followers could not help being stunned, also discovering this issue now.

But Yang Ke smiled strangely and said, “I’m somewhat curious now, just how strong his sword arts are!”

... ...

An hour later, two figures came out of the city with a howl, arriving in no time!

These two people were precisely Qin Hu and his buddy, Mo Xi!

The two people, one in front and one behind, blocked off all of Ye Yuan’s paths of retreat.

Qin Hu looked at Ye Yuan and said with a loud laugh, “Punk, you really keep your promises, to actually wait here to die! Hahaha ...”
