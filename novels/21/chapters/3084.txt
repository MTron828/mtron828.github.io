Chapter 3083: All the Heavens’ Catastrophe!

“Who comes? Could it be that you’re bullying my Zhoutian Emperor Palace for not having anyone?!” Zhou Tianyu said in a solemn voice to the blood race army that was galloping over at full speed.

Seeing the blood race’s powerful line-up, Zhou Tianyu was secretly alarmed.

This blood race army actually had close to 100 Hegemon Realm powerhouses.

The one leading was even an apex Supreme Hegemon!

Just in terms of aura, he was not beneath him.

However, no one answered him.

Boom!

The blood race army arrived with a howl. The slaughter directly started!

Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s disciples did not expect that the blood race was actually so straightforward.

For a moment, they were also caught off-guard.

And Zhou Tianyu also faced off against that blood race Supreme Hegemon.

Upon exchanging blows, he felt the other party’s strength.

“Humph!?Do you really think that this seat is scared of you?”

......

Zhou Tianyu saw that the other party completely could not be reasoned with and was also genuinely enraged.

It was only to see him release his origin, his strength shocking heaven and earth.

That blood race leader opposite was actually suppressed for some time too.

By the side, Ancestor Endless did not move.

Hearing the miserable cries of Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s disciples, his expression became more and more solemn.

The blood race army’s objective was not to occupy Zhoutian Emperor Palace at all.

Their objective was to kill!

The blood race powerhouses completely disregarded casualties. There were never survivors under their hands either.

Either you die or I perish!

A will that looked death calmly in the face, coupled with the powerful ability to revive endlessly, made the blood race’s combat power go off the charts.

While the present Zhoutian Emperor Palace was only left with some stragglers and disbanded soldiers, how could they be the other party’s match?

However, these bloodkins seemed to have automatically overlooked Ancestor Endless.

Ancestor Endless’s expression turned slightly dark, and he stared at a region of void and said coldly, “Come on out. You’re still showing your tail but hiding your face in front of this seat?”

The void trembled slightly. A figure appeared.

He held a tiny blood-colored pearl in his bead.

Only to see him toss lightly, the blood bead directly flew towards the sky and suspended above the sky of the battlefield.

One wisp of blood energy after another was currently converging towards the blood bead.

Seeing this scene, Ancestor Endless’ pupils constricted.

When the other party saw Ancestor Endless, he smiled and said, “A half-dead Great Beyond Realm, I haven’t taken you seriously yet. The reason why I didn’t appear is just that I was preparing the Blood Ward Bead. That’s all.”

Ancestor Endless was incredibly shocked in his heart. This bloodkin opposite was clearly not the Chaos Bloodstone.

But the other party was a true-blue Great Beyond powerhouse!

He could tell from the other party’s eyes that he did not take him seriously at all.

The moment this person appeared, dismay immediately welled up in Zhou Tianyu’s heart.

If there was no Great Beyond powerhouse, they still had a glimmer of hope.

But now, he was in despair.

Ancestor Endless snorted coldly and said, “Half-dead? This ancestor will let you see that the dignity of a Great Beyond powerhouse can’t be blasphemed!”

Boom!

Ancestor Endless stomped his feet. The Door of Eternal Life slowly opened up behind him.

An extremely powerful saint force flowed out of the Door of Eternal Life.

But his opponent still did not care because opening the Door of Eternal Life was tantamount to resorting to the last resort.

This was merely Ancestor Endless’ last struggle. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

With Great Beyond battle starting, the bloody smell on the battlefield grew thicker and thicker.

That Blood Ward Bead seemed to be extremely happy, absorbing that surging blood energy.

Furthermore, this Blood Ward Bead seemed like it would never be full and would not grow larger too.

Half a day later, Ancestor Endless slowly collapsed, endless reluctance and nostalgia in his gaze.

This Great Beyond powerhouse who commanded two eras had fallen!

“Father!” Zhou Tianyu’s voice carried the fury of despair.

But he himself was already an arrow at the end of its flight too.

Zhou Tianyu was very strong, but he was currently being besieged by more than ten Hegemons and already could not hold on anymore.

Ancestor Endless’ collapse became the last strand of straw that crushed him.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Several powerful origin attacks landed on his body.

Fresh blood spurted wildly from Zhou Tianyu’s mouth, and he was slammed onto the ground, looking like he was not going to make it.

On the battlefield, Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s disciples were in twos and threes and could no longer form large groups.

At Zhoutian Emperor Palace, corpses scattered everywhere.

The Blood Ward Bead was still greedily absorbing blood energy.

The Zhoutian Emperor Palace, humanity’s top major faction, collapsed with a loud bang.

That Supreme Hegemon said with a bow, “Lord Yi Yun, Zhoutian Emperor Palace has already been completely destroyed. There are no survivors!”

Yi Yun nodded slightly and said, “Clean up the battlefield. Let the Blood Ward Bead absorb sufficient blood energy! Progenitor coming into being this time, there can’t be any mistakes!”

“Yes!”

… . .

Similar scenes were playing out in all heavens.

The blood race came soaring into existence, shocking the entire 33 Heavens!

Everyone knew that the blood race was strong but did not know that the blood race was actually so strong.

Overnight, a large number of Great Beyond Realm mighty experts suddenly appeared in the blood race!

Furthermore, their numbers were abundant until it terrified people. They actually waged war across the 33 Heavens simultaneously!

Some low-level planes even completely fell into enemy hands within a month!

This was a catastrophe!

This time, the blood race would not talk any rubbish at all. What they brought was an endless slaughter.

The blood race did not accept surrender, only death!

Powerhouses in all heavens fell into a great panic all at once.

For some time, the casualties were beyond count.

Before this, everyone knew that the blood race had returned.

But no one expected that it would cause such severe consequences.

At Thundercry Continent, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Ye Yuan looked at the corpses all over the ground, his brows tightly knitted.

“Heh,?they really think highly of me! In order to kill me, they actually sent five Great Beyond powerhouses!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

By the side, Mi Tian sighed and said, “We all underestimated the blood race! I really didn’t expect that in these several hundred thousand years, the blood race actually accumulated such a terrifying force!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “This force should have only appeared recently! There are many blood race Hegemon Realms, but wanting to break through to Great Beyond Realm is absolutely no easy task! If my conjectures are right, the Chaos Bloodstone should have obtained the four great true spirit bloodlines. That’s how they created so many Great Beyond powerhouses!”

Mi Tian was shocked in his heart, and only then he came to realize the truth.

The Chaos Bloodstone schemed for a long time, acquiring the four great true spirit bloodlines.

Back then, Ye Yuan already said that even though his strength increased by so much, there was no reason that the Chaos Bloodstone would not be strong.

It was just that they did not expect that what came was actually so terrifying!

Mi Tian frowned and said, “The current situation isn’t optimistic! Several low-level planes such as Yuan Ming Wen Ju Heaven and Xuanming Gong Qing Heaven have already completely fallen into enemy hands. Those planes already became the brutal battlefield of the blood race. According to what I know, the situation of the human race’s three supreme heavens isn’t optimistic either! Zhoutian Emperor Palace has already …”

When he received the news, Zhou Xianchen directly passed out.

He locked himself in and only came out three days later.

Then, he brought Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s powerhouses and fought dauntlessly in bloody battles with the blood race.

Different from other heavens, the blood race encountered stubborn resistance in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

In this one month, the army that Mi Tian and Ye Yuan led had already repelled the blood race’s frenzied attacks four times.

In order to kill Ye Yuan, the blood race even sent five mighty Great Beyond powerhouses over.

It was just that sadly, the Chaos Bloodstone had times where he miscalculated too.

Long Jian, Bai Zhi, Luan Qinghe, Xuan Taiqing, four people, broke through to Great Beyond Realm in succession.

Joining hands with Mi Tian and Mi Zhen, two great apex powerhouses, they actually forcibly killed four out of the five mighty Great Beyond Realms!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven virtually became the only place in the entire 33 Heavens where results bore fruit!
