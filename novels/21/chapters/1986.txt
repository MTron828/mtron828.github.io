Chapter 1990: Different Appraisal

Zhou Yu’s complexion was somewhat pale. No one knew whether it was because he was somewhat nervous or because he was afraid.

Walking in front of the Empyrean bone devil, Zhou Yu took out that empyrean spirit treasure and drew a deep breath.

Suddenly, he swung his rod horizontally, with the aura on his body suddenly changing. A profound power of law wrapped around him.

“What powerful law undulations! It turned out that this is his true strength!”

“Those people previously are far too lacking compared to Zhou Yu!”

“Maybe he can really block this sword.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

...

When experts make their move, the genuine and the fake would become clear at a glance.

Although Zhou Yu was still accumulating momentum, the law undulations on his body clearly far surpassed those powerhouses of the same rank.

Him striking a powerhouse of the same rank dead with a blow, what he relied on was not just an empyrean spirit treasure.

When fighting with Ye Yuan previously, he did not use his full strength either.

The Empyrean bone devil still stabbed indifferently, sweeping away all obstacles in the way.

Zhou Yu gave a loud cry and suddenly slammed his rod out.

At the places where the rod passed by, fine cracks would appear in space.

“One Staff Questioning the Heavens!”

Two formidable forces collided together directly, immediately stirring up a horrifying air billow, blowing until everyone’s face hurt.

A muffled groan came out of Zhou Yu’s mouth as if being hit by a sledgehammer, directly being struck to the ground. He was wildly spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood.

Zhou Yu’s complexion was white as paper, already sustaining heavy injuries.

However, he did not have despair on his face. Instead, he had a look of joy.

He blocked this sword, completing this impossible task.

Up to this point, he was the first genius martial artist to perform to this step.

He had reason to be proud!

But right at this time, the bone devil lightly spat two words out of his mouth, “Too weak!”

That tone seemed to be rather disappointed.

Zhou Yu’s expression turned stiff. The joy from a moment ago immediately evaporated into thin air.

This ... This was weak?

Then how strong was the power that the other party was comparing with?

Everyone drew a mouthful of cold air. Someone as powerful as Zhou Yu actually could not receive this Empyrean bone devil’s sword move either.

Just how strong was this sword move?

In their eyes, the Zhou Yu who was already close to being invincible actually became too weak when reaching the Empyrean bone devil’s mouth.

This appraisal made people breakdown!

“Senior displayed this sword with Empyrean cultivation realm but appraised me as too weak, I ... I’m unconvinced!” Zhou Yu gritted his teeth and said.

To them, these proud children of heaven, this kind of humiliation was even more uncomfortable than killing him.

Hence, even though he knew that the Empyrean bone devil was exceedingly powerful, Zhou Yu still expressed his refusal to give in.

The Empyrean bone devil looked at him and said coolly, “The geniuses in our era, they should be able to easily defeat me with regards to the first sword move.”

When these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar.

Such a horrifying sword move, it could easily be defeated?

Just how horrifying were the geniuses of that era?

They did not doubt the truth of these words, because the Empyrean bone devil completely did not have a need to lie about this sort of thing.

“Next one.”

The Empyrean bone devil ignored everyone’s astonishment, raised his bone finger, and actually pointed at Song Yu.

Song Yu’s complexion was deathly pale. With his strength, he absolutely could not block this sword.

Suddenly, a figure blocked in front of him and said coolly, “Senior, let me try.”

Looking at this back view, Song Yu’s eyes were full of gratitude. Somewhat choking, he said, “B-Brother Ye.”

Ye Yuan turned his head and said smilingly, “This sword is rather interesting, I want to give it a shot. Let me do it.”

Song Yu had a touched expression, and with a nod, he said, “Be careful, Brother Ye!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, turned to look at the Empyrean bone devil, and said, “Senior, make your move.”

The bone devil did not say a word and stabbed another sword out.

Directly facing this sword move, Ye Yuan finally experienced the might of this sword.

The Empyrean bone devil launched this move with Second Firmament True God divine essence. But the power of this move was sufficient to instantly kill Fourth Firmament True Gods.

Within the same realm, it was simply an invincible existence.

Feeling the piercing cold sword intent, Ye Yuan immediately drew his sword and made his move.

“Sword ... Hollow ... Etch!”

A space annihilating aura instantly spread out.

All of the children of destiny, their faces changed drastically.

Too terrifying!

Feng Xiaotian’s pupils constricted and he cried out in shock, “It’s here! It’s this move!”

This was his first time seeing Ye Yuan display this sword from start to finish. That breathtaking feeling was like he saw a beautiful girl, causing his heart palpitating with excitement.

This sword was peerless among its contemporaries!

The last time, he only saw the conclusion and did not see the process.

This time, he saw it all.

He was really unable to imagine that there was actually someone in this world who could display such a perfect sword.

After witnessing Zhou Yu’s One Staff Questioning the Heavens, he knew that if there was someone capable of truly blocking this sword, it would be none other than Ye Yuan.

Originally, he did not know Zhou Yu’s trump card.

He knew that perhaps Zhou Yu could have the strength to rival Ye Yuan. After all, his realm was much higher than Ye Yuan.

But now, he knew that even if Zhou Yu displayed One Staff Questioning the Heavens, he was likely not Ye Yuan’s match either.

Because he had seen Sword Hollow Etch’s terrifying power with his own eyes before.

One Staff Questioning the Heavens could not do it.

But now, the Empyrean bone devil was displaying this sword at Second Firmament True God. Facing the same rank Ye Yuan, he might not be able to win!

Zhou Yu looked at Ye Yuan’s proud figure and actually felt ashamed of his unworthiness.

It turned out that this was Ye Yuan’s true killing move!

Compared to Ye Yuan, he was nothing!

“Go!”

Two swords were akin to two comets, colliding in the air in a blink of an eye.

Bang!

Sword Hollow Etch smashed the bone devil’s sword like crushing dead leaves, carrying an imposing momentum that pressed forward with an indomitable will, aiming straight for the bone devil’s main body.

But right at this time, the bone devil casually waved, like chasing away flies.

Sword Hollow Etch evaporated into thin air as if it had never appeared before.

The power of an Empyrean was unbelievably formidable!

The crowd was silent.

No one could have thought that such a conclusion would actually occur.

Suddenly, the Empyrean bone devil slowly opened his mouth and said, “Not bad, you’re ... very strong!”

Everyone turned pale with fright. This appraisal was extraordinary!

About Zhou Yu’s breathtaking rod move earlier, the Empyrean bone devil’s evaluation was that the former’s move was too weak.

But now, his appraisal of Ye Yuan was actually very strong!

“How can this Ye Yuan be so strong?”

“According to the Empyrean bone devil’s criteria, can Ye Yuan’s strength already rival their era’s geniuses?”

“Is ... this a true genius?”

...

Hearing this evaluation, all of the children of destiny were dumbstruck with shock.

Each one of them grew up amidst praises. Their strength had also always overpowered their peers.

But now, their brilliance was overshadowed under the Empyrean bone devil’s one comment.

The only dazzling light was Ye Yuan!

Zhou Yu’s pupils constricted. He wished to find a hole in the ground to tunnel into right now.

He had always viewed Ye Yuan as an enemy. Only now did he understand that he did not have the qualifications to become Ye Yuan’s enemy at all.

Ye Yuan’s complexion was rather pale. This sword practically drained his divine essence dry.

“Thank you very much for Senior’s praise!” Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said.

“Do you still want to continue?” The bone devil asked.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said firmly, “Continue!”
