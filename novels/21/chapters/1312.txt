Inside the World Suppressing Stele, time slowly passed quietly. In a twinkle, it was already close to a hundred years.

Dustless looked at the divine-grade medicinal pill inside the array formation, overflowing with medicinal fragrance, and was speechless for a long time.

Divine-grade one-star Heavenly Mark Pill!

Ye Yuan really did it and only used less than a century!

Dustless still did not quite dare to believe it until now, that Ye Yuan completed something which even Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove could not do.

He already did his best to overestimate Ye Yuan’s talent, but he discovered now that his estimations were a complete joke. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This boy in front of him could not be judged with common sense at all.

“Senior, it’s finally formed!”

Ye Yuan was also very excited. He knew that he completed a remarkable achievement.

“Yeah, it’s done! You, kid, are simply born for the sake of alchemy! If it were somebody else, a hundred year’s time to comprehend these spirit medicines’ medicinal properties isn’t even enough,” Dustless said with an emotional sigh.

Ye Yuan comprehending these rank one divine rank spirit medicines could simply use enlightening to describe.

Ever since entering the Selfless Realm at that time, after learning the rudiments, his speed of comprehending medicinal properties could simply use outrageous to describe.

Each kind of spirit medicine, the medicinal properties were different, but it was not to say that they were completely different.

Ye Yuan was always able to draw parallels from inference, learning by analogy and inferring other things from one instance.

After that, he learned the medicinal properties fully very quickly.

The array formations path, even though Ye Yuan’s improvements were not as good as with alchemy, it also made rapid advancements.

The array formation to refine the divine-grade one-star Heavenly Mark Pill was a thousand times, ten thousand times more complicated than the Lesser Divine Essence Formation.

But Ye Yuan only used 20 years’ time and thoroughly comprehended it!

“Didn’t Senior also say that because I entered Selfless Realm and had a correspondence point with Heavenly Dao, that’s why it would be so smooth,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

“That might be the case, but being able to enter the Selfless Realm in itself is also the manifestation of strength and comprehension ability. You, boy, really made me too surprised,” Dustless said.

“Huhu, many thanks for Senior’s praise, I’d best consume this medicinal pill first! Divine sea being damaged for 10 years, not a trace of essence energy within the body, I’m already about to collapse.”

Ye Yuan already could not wait. These few years of becoming a ‘cripple’ really made him aggrieved to the max.

Medicinal pill entering the abdomen, a majestic medicinal strength instantly scoured all the limbs and bones in his body.

Very soon, Ye Yuan sensed that his divine sea was being repaired bit by bit.

Divine-grade one-star Heavenly Mark Pill indeed lived up to its reputation!

This century of painstaking effort finally paid off at this moment.

Even though the divine-grade one-star Heavenly Mark Pill was just a Tier 1 divine pill, the refining difficulty was not an ordinary kind of great.

How much effort Ye Yuan put in these close to a hundred years, only he and Dustless knew.

“This one-star Heavenly Mark Pill is indeed miraculous, to actually be able to trigger Heavenly Dao to repair the divine sea!” Ye Yuan exclaimed in surprise.

Dustless said, “That is, of course! No matter what medicinal pill, once it reaches divine-grade, that’s being recognized by Heavenly Dao Laws! With your injuries, only by refining a one-star Heavenly Mark Pill can it not leave behind sequela.”

Ye Yuan nodded, indicating understanding.

Him refining heaven-grade Heavenly Mark Pill had no meaning at all.

Even though a heaven-grade one-star Heavenly Mark Pill was likewise able to repair the divine sea, it would cause an irredeemable impact on his future cultivation.

But the divine-grade one-star Heavenly Mark Pill would not.

This refinement was ten days and ten nights!

The one-star Heavenly Mark Pill was just like a refining master, sculpting Ye Yuan’s divine sea with the utmost care.

Finally, a trace of spiritual energy entered Ye Yuan’s body. After refining it, it turned into divine essence and flowed into the divine sea!

Ye Yuan felt that the feeling of controlling divine essence was really great!

...

“Tower Lord, Ye Yuan’s seclusion has already been 10 years! The medicinal pills that he left behind are too sought after and were long exhausted clean. These two years, our performance has been declining continuously! The Wang Family pulled through the most difficult period and is showing signs of raising their heads again now.”

Ever since Liang Wanru’s incident 10 years ago, the Myriad Treasure Tower was really glorious for some times, suppressing the three great families.

One could say that they outshone others already.

Especially the Divine Essence Pills and Detoxification Pills that Ye Yuan left behind, no matter what grade, they were all very popular.

The quality of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills were all higher than the same-grade medicinal pills. Furthermore, they were martial artists’ running stock medicinal pills, which were naturally very popular.

The quantity of medicinal pills that he left was considerable. But it could not hold up to the Myriad Treasure Tower’s boom in business.

Towards the end, the medicinal pills that he left behind were even hiked to a very high price.

Even so, it could not stop the buyers’ booming enthusiasm either.

There would always be those people who did not lack money.

Finally, the medicinal pills that Ye Yuan left behind were completely exhausted two years ago.

At that time, it became the turning point of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s business. Their performance started to decline.

The other three families finally grasped this opportunity and counterattacked strongly, reoccupying the market.

Ye Yuan did not exit seclusion all along, filled Su Linpu with anxiety.

But Yang Rui was not anxious at all and said with a smile, “Oh, Old Su, your gaze is too narrow and shortsighted! If they want to jump around, just let them go jump around!”

Su Linpu smiled bitterly and said, “I say, Tower Lord, why aren’t you nervous at all? With the current trend, we’ll return to that sort of situation previously again before long.”

Yang Rui said smilingly, “So what then? Don’t you forget how Ye Yuan refined the divine-grade Detoxification Pill back then! At that time, he only used two months’ time! Now, he entered seclusion for close to ten years, you think about it, once he leaves seclusion, what level will his alchemy strength attain?”

Su Linpu’s eyes lit up. Only then discovering that he was indeed shortsighted and only saw the immediate benefits.

He forgot that what brought them this transformation was Ye Yuan!

As long as Ye Yuan was around, the Myriad Treasure Tower could rise up anew at any time!

Moreover, he entered seclusion 10 years in one go. Who knew what level his alchemy strength would reach.

Su Linpu said, “Tower Lord, do you think ... Ye Yuan can refine the one-star Heavenly Mark Pill or not?”

Yang Rui shook his head and said with a smile, “You’re an alchemist, this question, you should be clearer than me, right? Ten years’ time, how can it possibly refine the one-star Heavenly Mark Pill? However ... we can wait!”

Su Linpu also felt that his question was rather laughable. The difficulty of the one-star Heavenly Mark Pill could be said to be demon-level.

Even for Two-star Alchemy Gods, extremely few people could refine it too.

It was true that Ye Yuan’s talent was abnormally high, but wanting to reach this step, it absolutely could not be done in ten year’s time.

“Tower Lord, then Su Linpu will take his leave.”

Finished talking, Su Linpu backed out.

“Manager Su!”

Su Linpu was just about to enter the Myriad Treasure Tower’s lobby but was stopped by a voice.

He turned around and could not help being overjoyed, “Ye Yuan, you finally exited seclusion! If you still didn’t exit seclusion, our Myriad Treasure Tower can close shop for good already!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Manager Su’s joke is overdone. Before this Ye came, wasn’t the Myriad Treasure Tower very lively too? Without Ye Yuan, could it be that the Myriad Treasure Tower can’t operate anymore?”

Su Linpu chortled with laughter. Suddenly, his countenance changed drastically, and he said stammeringly, “Y-Y-You ... Your divine sea ... already recovered?”

The current Ye Yuan, his body faintly emitted powerful undulations, becoming like a different person from before closed-seclusion. It was clear at a glance!

Ye Yuan’s divine sea was repaired!
