1442 Do You Think You“ll Be Fine If You Don“t Move?

“Wonder what it will look like when divine essence is compressed to the limits! The Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s continuation is really worth looking forward to!”

Feeling the boundless divine essence undulations within his body, Ye Yuan felt like every pore in his whole body opened up.

Although this path of cultivation method self-creation was arduous, it was clearly worth it.

Currently, although he had just broken through to initial-stage Heaven Glimpse, the thickness of divine essence already did not lose to peak initial-stage Heaven Glimpse martial artists.

Coupled with the powerful Chaos Heaven Opening Sword Art, it practically took no effort for Ye Yuan to one-shot middle-stage Heaven Glimpse martial artists now.

Even late-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses, he had the strength battle it out too!

Ye Yuan leaped, bringing along the World Suppressing Stele, and flew back to the platform.

“Master, you’re really too incredible! Even breaking through was also so eclectic!” Bai Chen went up to greet and exclaimed.

“Yeah, Grand Elder. The cultivation method that you cultivate is actually so overbearing that you can even tame the spiritual energy in the magma too!” Bai Xiu also exclaimed in surprise.

If it were even, even if he could survive in the magma, the violent spiritual energy would also burn his meridians into a crisp.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This is also something that couldn’t be helped. The Sky Foothill World’s spiritual energy is too thin. Fortunately, it’s inside the Divine Ruins. If it was in the outside world, it might cause a massive commotion.”

If Ye Yuan cultivated at the outside world, most likely, the spiritual energy within a circumference of 10 thousand miles would be absorbed clean by him!

Such a large commotion, it was hard to ensure that it would not draw the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s attention.

Suddenly, many holes appeared on this giant ring platform!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

One figure after another was transported out of the holes in various ways.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s expression could not help turning grim, instinctively having a foreboding premonition.

“Dao Fruit! It’s actually the Dao Fruit! Hahaha ... I obtained it without any effort at all! Really obtained without any trouble at all!”

When Qin Tian saw the Dao Fruit suspended on the lone island, he was in a state of extremely ecstasy.

He also did not expect to actually find the Dao Fruit here!

That was a Celestial Deity Dao Fruit!

As long as he obtained the Celestial Deity Dao Fruit, he could reach Celestial Deity Realm within a very short time!

At that time, however vast the world, what place could he still not go?

Regarding the Divine Lord Realm, Qin Tian was still somewhat confident. But regarding Celestial Deity Realm, he never thought of it before.

Hard!

Too hard!

But now, this enormous cake was placed in front of him, how could he not be agitated?

Upon laying eyes on the Dao Fruit for the first time, he swore to obtain it at all costs!

Suddenly, he sensed something and looked in Ye Yuan’s direction, his pupils involuntarily constricting and he drew a cold breath.

Just how long had it been, Ye Yuan actually broke through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This was not some good news!

When Ye Yuan was half-step Heaven Glimpse, he already almost killed him.

Becoming a genuine Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse now, his strength improved by God knows how many times.

Unleashing that sword one more time, his Heavenly Feather Flexible Armor would not work anymore too!

“Dao Fruit? What is that thing?” Duan Fei said.

He could tell from Qin Tian’s expression that this thing was definitely extraordinary.

“Good stuff! Heh heh, with this Dao Fruit, we can discuss things now! The precious treasures on Ye Yuan’s body and this Dao Fruit, you pick one!” Qin Tian said coolly.

He did not conceal it either, briefly introducing this Dao Fruit’s effect, making Duan Fei’s countenance change visibly.

Controlling Heavenly Dao, becoming the sovereign of a world!

Such a thing, how could he not be moved?

“This Dao Fruit, I’m taking it!” Duan Fei forcefully suppressed the agitation in his heart and said.

As long as he swallowed the Dao Fruit, he would control the Sky Foothill World.

At that time, the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s palace lord would also have to grovel and lick under his feet!

Thinking about it made people excited!

“Alright, then it’s settled! But because of this, we’d better settle the problem first!” Qin Tian said coolly.

Regarding Duan Fei’s decision, Qin Tian did not have much objections.

He was indeed very moved by the Dao Fruit. But he had a feeling that the precious treasures on Ye Yuan were probably even more incredible that the Dao Fruit!

The talent that Ye Yuan displayed was too terrifying. If say Ye Yuan did not have a heaven-defying lucky chance, that was impossible.

Wu Meng Academy’s resources were utterly insufficient to nurture such a freak.

Moreover, how could Qin Tian possibly give away the Dao Fruit on a silver platter?

Finishing off Ye Yuan, Qin Tian’s next target would be Duan Fei!

“Azurepeak, Zuo Yun, Huo Tianyang, the few of you attack together! The White Night Sacred Palace’s people, don’t spare a single one!” Duan Fei said solemnly.

Hearing Duan Fei’s orders, Azurepeak’s face revealed a complicated look.

Those who charged out of the Giant Flame Stonemen there were all powerful people.

Right now, the various major sacred palaces, the one that was the most intact was the White Night Sacred Palace.

“Kill!” Duan Fei bellowed. A group of people encircled over towards the White Night Sacred Palace from both sides.

This was a ring-shaped platform. Ahead was endless magma. The White Night Sacred Palace’s people already had no way to escape!

“You all listen well to me! In a while, no matter what happens, all don’t anyhow take action! Stay on the spot and don’t move! I’ll do my best to protect you all!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

Everyone’s expression turned austere and they nodded one after another.

They also discerned that Duan Fei and Qin Tian joining hands, and Huo Tianyang also glaring like a ravening tiger by the side, they already had no way out.

Now, there was only listening to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s face fell. Raising his hand, it was a Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!

However, his target was not Duan Fei they all, but ... the direction of the Dao Fruit!

A massive azure dragon phantom flew straight for the Dao Fruit.

“Ye Yuan, you dare!”

When Qin Tian and Duan Fei saw this scene, they virtually cried out in shock in unison.

They thought that Ye Yuan was going for broke here.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth. This bunch of fools really thought that the Dao Fruit was so easy to obtain?

Boom!

When the azure dragon phantom reached the lone island, it seemingly ran into a giant barrier, shaking until the entire dome started quaking violently.

Qin Tian and Duan Fei both heaved a sigh in relief, rejoicing that the Dao Fruit was okay.

However, very soon, the expressions on their faces changed.

Rays of faint-yellow light floated up, filling the entire dome very quickly.

Boom!

A pale-yellow light ball suddenly condensed and formed, bombarding right onto a Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm elder.

“ARGH!!”

That elder let out a shrill scream and was directly blown flying.

After that, his entire person turned into a fireball and started burning.

This scene made everyone break out in cold sweat.

“All stand still and don’t move! This damn guy set off the grand array! Right now, all of us have fallen into the grand array!” Duan Fei gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

This grand array was too formidable. A Heaven Glimpse Realm elder only withstood for several breaths of time and turned into a cloud of flying ash.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene and said with a cold smile, “Do you think you’ll be fine if you don’t move?”

His voice had yet to fade when another light ball suddenly condensed and formed, roaring toward another Heaven Glimpse Realm elder once again!
