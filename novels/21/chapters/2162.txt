Chapter 2166: Still Too Weak

“Hehe, what did I say? Ye Yuan brought him down with one hand!”

Long Xiaochun hid behind Morningstar, having a smug look on her face.

She had personally judged Ye Yuan’s strength before. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In the same rank, there was basically no chance of wanting to beat Ye Yuan.

Let alone that Long Zheng who was not considered the strongest in this batch of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon.

A hint of surprise also flashed across Morningstar’s eyes. Clearly, Ye Yuan’s strength far exceeded his imagination.

In the fog, Long Zheng crawled to his feet, a look of alarm and anger on his face.

His thoughts were the same as Long Yuan, that this punk was just a braggart.

But it was this braggart who defeated him without even using a martial technique.

A proud genius could not endure such a humiliation!

Long Zheng gritted his teeth and roared furiously, “Punk, you forced me! I’ll let you take a look at my true strength!”

On his glabella, the Heavenly Dragon Mark started burning like a blazing fire.

An enormous true dragon phantom with its gaping maws wide open appeared behind Long Zheng.

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, and he revealed a look of amusement as he said with a light smile, “Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter! Huhu, a little interesting! But this move being unleashed in your hands, it is too weak!”

The same move, when used by different people, the power was totally different.

Differences in bloodline power, differences in Heavenly Dragon Mark, different strength of the physical body, it would all affect the move’s power.

This Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter move was the dragon race’s innate divine ability. It could summon the spirit of a true dragon to attack the opponent, the power immense.

It was just that Long Zheng’s move was not brilliant the way Ye Yuan looked at it.

Long Zheng had always been proud. Apart from Long Yuan, and Long Qian who was ranked second in Heavenly Dragon Stronghold, he did not place anyone in his sights.

Today, he was actually being looked down upon by his opponent like so. How could he not be furious?

“Punk, the outcome of looking down on the Heavenly Dragon Stronghold’s Son of the Heavenly Dragon is death!” Long Zheng was greatly enraged as he roared.

Ye Yuan chuckled and took a step out. The image of a dragon also surfaced behind him.

This move was shockingly precisely the True Dragon Trampling the Heavens that Long Zheng used before earlier!

“So what if innate divine ability? Today, I’ll let you see that the same move in different people’s hands, the power is totally different!”

Ye Yuan laughed lightly and suddenly struck a palm out.

The dragon image behind him practically turned corporeal, flying over toward Long Zheng with a roar.

Ye Yuan’s dragon image had a fundamental difference from Long Zheng’s Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter.

Innate divine abilities, those were blessings from a true dragon. It was summoning the origin power of the dragon race to battle.

While the dragon image that True Dragon Trampling the Heavens summoned was merely condensed with Ye Yuan’s own vital energy.

The two were on completely different levels in terms of quality.

Long Zheng’s Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter completely beat Ye Yuan in terms of quality.

But when the two powerful moves collided together, Long Zheng immediately felt a force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas transmitting over from the other party.

Bang!

Ye Yuan’s dragon image crushed the Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter like crushing dead leaves, then it bombarded against Long Zheng’s body.

Long Zheng spurted fresh blood wildly, directly being blasted beneath the earth.

At the outside world, the faces of all the heavenly emperors changed drastically.

“True Dragon Trampling the Heavens defeated Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter? My ... My eyesight isn’t failing, right?”

“This is too illogical! No matter how strong True Dragon Trampling the Heavens this move is, it’s also impossible to deal with Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter, right?”

“How could it be like this? How could it be like this!”

... ...

The heavenly emperor powerhouses all felt that it was hard to understand. Innate divine ability being stronger than ordinary martial techniques, this was universally acknowledged.

After all, ordinary martial techniques could be cultivated, while innate divine abilities could only be comprehended by relying on oneself.

Weak dragons were unable to comprehend a single innate divine ability for life.

Only Sons of the Heavenly Dragon could comprehend one or two.

In everyone’s understanding, only innate divine abilities could deal with innate divine abilities.

Unable to comprehend, there was only being crushed all the way.

But now, the innate divine ability that everyone viewed as a sharp weapon was actually defeated by Ye Yuan with an ordinary martial technique!

True Dragon Trampling the Heavens was strong, but in front of innate divine ability, it was too weak.

But Ye Yuan relied on this martial technique and defeated the innate divine ability, Dragon Tyrannical Evanescent Slaughter!

This result shocked people too greatly.

Morningstar’s eyes glimmered and he suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Girl, is this boy ... of the perfect seventh transformation golden body?”

Long Xiaochun giggled and said, “It’s still Grandpa Morningstar who has keen eyes! How is it? He’s impressive, right?”

“What? P-Perfect seventh transformation!” Long Zifeng had a look of shock, disbelief written all over his face.

A perfect sixth transformation was already incredibly rare, while a perfect seventh transformation was practically extinct!

The group of heavenly emperors was shocked until they could not close their mouths, looking at that figure on the light screen in disbelief.

A hint of surprise flashed across Morningstar’s eyes and he said with a slight nod, “No wonder! No matter how trashy the martial technique, when executed with perfect seventh transformation, the power will also skyrocket, let alone talk about the dragon race’s supreme martial technique, Universe Dragon Claw!”

“A perfect seventh transformation! How many years has a perfect seventh transformation not appeared in my Dragon Clan? This brat actually achieved a perfect seventh transformation at a young age!” Long Tianyu said with surprise.

“Long Tianyu, looks like your Heavenly Dragon Stronghold has met its match this time!” Black Dragon Stronghold’s elder said with a smile.

Long Tianyu’s mouth curled, and he said disdainfully, “You all will witness Long Yuan’s true strength very soon, so what if ... it’s the perfect seventh transformation?”

The moment these words came out, the group of heavenly emperors had strange expressions.

It seemed like Long Yuan’s strength was really very strong!

Morningstar’s gaze was indifferent as he said, “Long Zheng is heavily injured and already doesn’t have combat capability. Stripping the Heavenly Dragon Mark and withdrawing from the Mist Battlefield.”

Finished talking, he fired out a seal. A light beam flew out of the Mist Battlefield and landed on the platform.

Long Zheng was full of wounds and was already completely unconscious.

And the Heavenly Dragon Mark on his head also vanished without a trace already.

Battle of Dragon Sons, only the ten people that remained in the end could continue to possess the Heavenly Dragon Mark.

The others were stripped of their Heavenly Dragon Marks without exception, recovering their normal identities.

Battle of Dragon Sons was a huge lucky chance, and similarly also a cruel elimination tournament.

Weaklings could only fade into the crowd.

In the Mist Battlefield, Ye Yuan continued to search for dragon origin crystals according to the Heavenly Dragon Mark’s effects.

Ordinary Sons of the Heavenly Dragon were not opponents that could last one exchange with him at all.

Very soon, Ye Yuan found many dragon origin crystals.

While in another place, the Ao Yu who was currently meditating suddenly snapped open both eyes, his gaze revealing a look of wild elation.

Ao Yu gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said, “Hahaha ... the Mist Battlefield is indeed a superb place to increase one’s strength! My Heavenly Dragon Mark has already awakened a second time and even awakened my second innate divine ability. My strength became more than a magnitude stronger! My current strength is already adequate to squeeze into the top ten, even top five! Ye Yuan, pray that I don’t run into you, otherwise ... your hour of doom will have arrived! Blood debts need to be paid in blood!”

The Heavenly Dragon Mark was a mark that could be steadily promoted.

Each awakening, the strength of the dragon would obtain a significant advancement.

It was also precisely because so that the potential of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon was tremendous, and also why they would be respected like so.

They were people chosen by Heavenly Dragon Mountain, the Dragon Clan’s future.

Ao Yu refined quite a few dragon origin crystals and already underwent the second awakening.

The current him was brimming with confidence and wished to encounter Ye Yuan right away.
