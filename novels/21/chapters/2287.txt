Chapter 2291: Sit and Debate on Dao

Ye Yuan sat and debated on Dao with Sacred Ancestor High Priest. The group of disciples by the side listened like they did not fully understand.

Among them, there were some who were long already Deva Realm supreme powerhouses and had also already reached grand completion Ancestor Realm in alchemy too.

But without taking the step of refining a Dao pill, one would never be able to take part in the two people’s discussion.

They discovered that the things Master and Ye Yuan debated on already exceeded their understanding and reached another level.

Medicinal pills were different from other cultivation practices. It was a Dao with spirit medicines as the foundation, and it needed to be expressed through specific materials.

Furthermore, heaven and earth spirit medicines had different attributes. It could be said to be all-encompassing.

To the vast majority of alchemists, their pill refinement all stopped on the material level.

This path was especially difficult to go from the metaphysical and reach the level of Dao.

Reaching this level, it was all about understanding spirit medicines at the level of Dao. The perspective was totally different.

The 11 disciples’ understanding was from bottom to top.

But Ye Yuan’s and Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s understanding was from top to bottom.

It was an awe-inspiring view from a high place.

Even though the two of them were not truly towering at the summit, it was not a height that the average person could reach.

Gradually, above Feather Mountain, Dao melody reverberated, lingering incessantly.

On the entire Feather Mountain, it reverberated with the lingering charm of Dao.

Even though the 11 disciples were unable to fully understand things, their strength also stood at the pinnacle of the mortal realm. This level of Dao debate naturally benefited them a lot.

“Hahaha

... Brilliant! Truly brilliant! Ye Yuan, your view really let this emperor become enlightened at once!” Wing said with a big laugh.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Likewise, Senior Sacred Ancestor’s brilliant ideas made this Ye also have a feeling of being enlightened.”

Suddenly, Wing reined in his expression, and said seriously, “Ye Yuan, although your Dao is still very immature, it has already revealed its sharpness! As long as you keep walking all the way, you might walk even further than me and the Medicine Ancestor!”

With this round of Dao debate, the shock in Wing’s heart could not be greater.

The depths of Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao, the incisiveness of his insights, all of them were not like what a fledging kid should have, but rather he seemed to be like an expert with deep accumulations.

Even though this was also within reason, he discovered that he still underestimated Ye Yuan.

Especially when Ye Yuan talked about his 60 years of Dao enlightenment, gathering the essence of a myriad Alchemy Daos, making him be re-molded thoroughly anew.

Often, some of the insights that Ye Yuan said were all things that he had not even thought about before.

At a young age, he could actually have such profound insights, it was simply inconceivable.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Foods need to be eaten bite by bite, ever since comprehending the source of Alchemy Dao, my Alchemy Dao progress has evidently slowed down.”

The moment these words came out, the faces of each and every one of the disciples revealed strange looks.

These words were too pretentious!

Other people cultivating Alchemy Dao, which one did not calculate in tens of thousands of years?

Your 2000 over years of Dao enlightenment already beat other people’s tens of millions of years of comprehension, you were still not satisfied?

The hardest thing in Alchemy Dao was comprehending the power of source this step.

This punk already opened the gates and actually still complained that it was too slow!

Wing laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “You punk, if these words are said on Feather Mountain, then it’s fine. If you go outside and say it, you will probably drown in saliva!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This time, I came precisely to spar with the Heavenspan World’s top powerhouses. It’s just, I don’t know if that person will lower himself and have a match with me, this junior.”

Wing smiled and said, “That will have to depend on your ability, whether or not you can force him out! But you don’t look down on the heroes of the world too much either. This Heavenspan World isn’t just a Medicine Ancestor and a Sacred Ancestor High Priest. Although the people who comprehended Alchemy Dao source are very few, it’s also not like there aren’t any.”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Senior, rest assured, this Ye has an idea in my heart.”

Wing nodded and said, “Mn, I naturally feel assured about you. If you were short-tempered and had a personality that doesn’t know the proper way to act, you also wouldn’t have today.”

With the two people’s Dao debate coming to an end, both parties benefited a lot.

Ye Yuan was originally only muddleheaded about Dao pills. But Wing’s Dao debate opened up another door for Ye Yuan.

These things were sufficient for him to digest for some time.

Finished chatting about these, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and asked curiously, “Senior, may I be so bold as to ask what’s your realm?”

Towards the realm division above Deva Realm, Ye Yuan was not clear about it.

Seeing Wing this time, he naturally had to resolve the doubts in his heart.

Wing smiled and said, “This emperor has already transcended four blight tribulations, and is Deva Fourth Blight Realm.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “With Senior’s strength, you’re only Deva Fourth Blight?”

Wing laughed in spite of himself and said, “Deva blight tribulation isn’t as simple as you imagine. The further to the back, the more terrifying! Deva Realm powerhouses obtain eternal life and violate Heavenly Dao, resulting in Heavenly Dao sending down blight tribulations. The goal is to kill martial artists. Therefore, many people can transcend the first blight tribulation, second blight tribulation, but after the third time, there are very few. Even the Medicine Ancestor is also merely Fourth Blight Realm, that’s all.”

Ye Yuan’s mind was in upheaval. Turns out that the existence of the blight tribulation was actually such a purpose!

He had always thought that Wing and Medicine Ancestor were both Deva Fifth Blight supreme powerhouses. Did not expect that they were only just Fourth Blight.

“This ... Then just how strong are Deva Fifth Blight powerhouses? Can they rival Dao Ancestors?” Ye Yuan asked. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Wing shook his head and said, “Dao Ancestors control the rules in a region. That’s bestowed by Heavenly Dao! Even after transcending Deva Fifth Blight, it’s also impossible to be their match. Of course, among Deva Fifth Blights, there are still some extremely terrifying existences. Their strength might only be a hair’s breadth away compared to Dao Ancestors.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “There’s actually still this kind of powerhouse! Does Senior know which powerhouse in the Heavenspan World has such strength?”

Wing smiled and said, “This emperor knows that your relationship with the Jian Family is pretty good. The Jian Family’s ancestor, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, is such a terrifying existence! The present Deva Fourth Blight, Fifth Blight powerhouses, were mostly only gradually born after the Doomsday Battle. But I heard that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets is an old monster who survived from the previous epoch, his strength unfathomable. Of course, nobody has seen him take action before either. As for whether or not he can really rival Dao Ancestors, there’s no way of knowing.”

Ye Yuan felt a chill as he listened to it!

In his understanding, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, Medicine Ancestor, and Sacred Ancestor High Priest should be existences on the same level.

Who could have thought that he was actually so terrifying?

Ye Yuan’s heart stirred and he said, “Then ... does Senior know of the existence of the divine race?”

Wing nodded and said, “Heard of it, but I don’t know about the details.”

Ye Yuan heaved a sigh and said, “Then does Senior know that the new Doomsday Battle is about to arrive very soon?”

The Sacred Ancestor High Priest, who had always been calm and collected, his complexion finally changed. He said in surprise, “There’s actually still such a thing? How did you know?”

Ye Yuan recounted the events of the Abyss World and divine race, making everyone present have grim expressions after listening.

An invisible pressure echoed in the hall.

“Senior, the divine race prepared for an epoch. They will surely come down on us like a ton of bricks this time! The Sacrificial Temple still needs to take precautions early!” Ye Yuan said.

Wing let out a deep sigh and said, “Doomsday Battle ... Is this another samsara? No wonder I’ve been restless recently. It turns out that the reason is actually this!”
