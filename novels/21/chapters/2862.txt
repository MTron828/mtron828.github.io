Chapter 2868 Divine Battle! Great Victory Without Equal!

In the sky above South Qi Giant City, it was densely filled with figures.

Feng Xiaotian took the lead, his face full of solemnness.

There was only an army of 60 thousand behind him!

These few years, the blood race’s powerhouses grew more and more, and South Qi Giant City’s expenditure increased more and more.

The troop replenishment also gradually slowed down.

The blood race’s battle tactic was very simple: use numbers to swarm you to death!

This time, there were only five short days, South Qi Giant City seriously had no time to replenish the troops.

With 60 thousand versus 100 thousand, this was a very awkward comparison!

The blood race was strong to begin with. Even fighting one-on-three was normal.

But now, they used 60 thousand troops to face the blood race’s 100 thousand!

Without the enhancement of the grand array, it was really hopeless this time!

In the army of 60 thousand, the people’s faces all carried a solemn and tragic expression, as if brave warriors who would never return.

They did not know that the grand array was already almost finished repairing.

Feng Xiaotian told them that the grand array was already completely crippled.

It was useless!

The 60 thousand strong army could only forcefully resist the blood race’s 100 thousand elite soldiers!

Therefore, these people were all already harboring the determination of certain death to fight to the death with the blood race.

But actually, the grand array was only a step away from restoration! As long as these thousands of people unleashed the Lesser Origin Restoration Art simultaneously, the city protecting grand array would be finished repairing instantly.

Not repairing it was suggested by Ye Yuan.

Seeing as how the grand array was about to be finished repairing, everyone including Feng Xiaotian were beside themselves with joy.

But Ye Yuan suddenly suggested to stop repairing the grand array.

Because once the grand array was repaired, that tremendous undulation could not be concealed.

At that time, the blood race would be on guard.

With the Lesser Origin Restoration Art, letting the grand array be completely repaired was merely a blink of an eye.

So at this time, making them suffer from their own scheme was the best strategy

I

Want to win, win a big one!

Listening to Ye Yuan’s words, Feng Xiaotian instantly calmed down. His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of shock.

What a formidable boy!

When everyone fell into a frenzy, he could maintain his cool and plot to maximize the fruits of the battle.

Furthermore, this kind of operation was without the slightest flaws!

Even if the blood race racked their brains, they absolutely could not think that they could completely repair this near-collapsed city protecting grand array within a short two days!

“Hahaha ... Feng Xiaotian, looks like you already have some awareness! This seat has coveted your blood for a long time already!”

Two armies standing facing each other, Bloodpromise’s heroic spirit surged to the sky!

Around him, just the Emperor Sakra Heaven experts were more than 30 people!

And on Feng Xiaotian’s side, there were only eight people! For the sake of this great battle, the blood race could be said to have brought out all their elites.

Different from the Heaven One Alliance, the blood race had as many powerhouses as clouds!

They were blocked by the Absolute Heaven Barrier and unable to devote their full combat force at all.

In the great battle five days ago, the blood race lost more than 10 Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses, finally destroying the city protecting grand array. And this time, Bloodpromise transferred over all of the elites that could be mobilized!

In this battle, he was determined to succeed!

Feng Xiaotian said disdainfully, “Vanquished foe, how dare you speak bravely!”

The two people had fought no idea how many times. Feng Xiaotian firmly suppressed Bloodpromise. It was just that because of the blood race’s special characteristics, Feng Xiaotian could not kill his opponent at all.

Bloodpromise did not get angry either and said with a snicker, “Feng Xiaotian, you’re also just relying on the city protecting grand array to indulge in a contention of mouth and tongue! Now, the city protecting grand array has already been destroyed. This seat wants to see what you still have to be arrogant!”

Feng Xiaotian stood proudly in the air and shouted, “Even if we fight until the last soldier, we absolutely won’t let you all take half a step into the Absolute Heaven Barrier too! Brothers, what should we do?”

“The city exists if the people exist! The city dies if the people die!”

“The city exists if the people exist! The city dies if the people die!”

“The city exists if the people exist! The city dies if the people die!”

... ...

The air teemed with the aura of slaughter.

They no longer had any paths of retreat. There were only risking their lives to kill a path out! This murderous aura that surged to the sky. Even Bloodpromise was visibly moved by it too.

He suddenly realized that this would likely be an unprecedentedly tough battle today! In the past, the South Qi army had the city protecting grand array and would not be hopeless like today.

But today, they only had the path of cutting all means of retreat to take!

Feng Xiaotian looked at Bloodpromise and said with a cold smile, “You saw that, Bloodpromise? Wanting to open up the Absolute Heaven Barrier, step over our dead bodies!”

Bloodpromise’s gaze turned dark, and he flicked his sleeves grandly and said, “Then we’ll step over your corpses! Children, follow this seat and trample South Qi!”

Under his word of command, the 100 thousand strong army had blood energy surging to the sky, dying the sky red!

In this 100 thousand strong army, they were all elites among elites. How shocking was that commotion?

Feng Xiaotian did not move!

This was because the blood race army had not entered the range of the grand array yet!

Heavenly Stratum powerhouses moved extremely fast.

Even if it was an army of 100 thousand people, rushing to the city was merely an instant too!

In a blink, both sides clashed together in close quarters!

And in the next second, Ye Yuan lightly made a hand gesture. Over 1000 heavenly formation masters started using the Lesser Origin Restoration Art at virtually the same time.

Rumble!

The city protecting grand array was finished repairing!

The time was grasped perfectly!

The city protecting grand array instantly gave off a dazzling light, enveloping the 100 thousand strong army fully. Feng Xiaotian’s pupils constricted!

The power of the city protecting grand array had increased!

As South Qi Giant City’s city lord, Feng Xiaotian was all too familiar with the city protecting grand array!

After years on end of warfare and the grand array being constantly repaired, the power was actually already less than one-tenth of its heyday! But now, the grand array had recovered at least 70% of its power! This was too terrifying! The Lesser Origin Restoration Art was too impressive!

Ye Yuan was too awesome!

Because Feng Xiaotian knew that even if Ye Yuan imparted the Lesser Origin Restoration Art to everyone, his efficiency was still dozens of times higher than the others!

The load of Ye Yuan’s sole restoration could match 100 people’s amount!

He alone practically did nearly 20% of the workload!

Without Ye Yuan, even if there was the Lesser Origin Restoration Art, it was also impossible to completely repair it, and it was even less likely to let the grand array recover 70% of its power!

Bloodpromise’s face turned green!

He lifted his head to look at the sky in disbelief, his eyes full of shock.

The city protecting grand array was fully repaired within two days?

Furthermore, the power of the grand array increased by a great deal!

Was this a miracle?

How did Feng Xiaotian do it?

How many blood race powerhouses had fallen in order to wear down the power of the grand array? Just the origin realm powerhouses had no less than 100 people who died! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Now, you’re telling me that the grand array was completely restored?

Didn’t that mean that all of our people who died for so many years had all been in vain?

I-I’ll fuck you!

Countless painstaking effort, countless battles, countless deaths!

In the end, it was actually all for naught?

Bloodpromise was going crazy!

However, he no longer had time to be shocked!

No one was more clear than him about the power of this interlinked grand array!

He felt that all the blood in his body was about to explode!

It was over!

In the next second, countless flames, lightning, ice, falling rocks ... fell from the sky!

Bang! Bang! Bang! In the grand array, these terrifying attacks seemed to have eyes, all landing on the bloodkins.

Suddenly, miserable cries were continuous!

No matter how strong these low-level bloodkins were, they died upon contact!

Under such power, they did not have time to revive at all and were directly obliterated!

South Qi Giant City became a purgatory once more!

The 60 thousand strong Heaven One army looked at this scene before their eyes muddle-headedly, completely stunned.

Wasn’t it agreed upon to fight to the death?

Wasn’t it agreed upon that the grand array was crippled? Wasn’t it agreed upon to drain the last drop of blood?

We had not even freaking made a move yet, and the blood race already had more than half dead or injured!

But in the next instant, everyone went crazy!

They looked at Feng Xiaotian, their gazes full of fanatical worship!

Indeed, this is our omnipotent god of war!

Two days!

We only used two days and completely restored the city protecting grand array?

This is simply a miracle!

“City Lord is mighty! Heaven One Alliance is mighty!”

“City Lord His Excellency is omnipotent! Mowing down all resistance!”

“Miracle! Divine battle! This is Heaven One’s most brilliant victory ever!”

......

Heaven One army had already gone completely crazy!

It was just that the hero in their eyes, their gazes landed on another person at this time, their gazes full of fanaticism!

Ye Yuan created an unprecedented miracle!

This time was different!

Outside the grand array, the blood race could continuously deplete the grand array and wear down the army.

But, once they fell into the grand array, what awaited them would be a massacre!

Heaven gave the blood race a powerful bloodline power. Then it would also strip them of other abilities.

The blood race was extremely weak in Formation Dao and Alchemy Dao, these Great Daos!

Otherwise, they also would not have spent several thousand years in front of the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

Boom!

A terrifying bolt of lightning fell, directly bombarding on Bloodpromise’s body.

His aura instantly withered significantly.

At this time, he was breaking out of the encirclement frenziedly, wanting to charge out of the grand array crazily.

His strength was too strong! Origin powerhouses, even if it was the city protecting grand array, it was hard to obliterate him too.

Feng Xiaotian’s gaze turned intent. Flicking his sleeves grandly, he shouted, “Brothers, let’s create an unprecedented divine battle together! Follow me and kill together!”

“Kill!”

The battle cry of the 60 thousand strong Heaven One army shook the heavens!

Grade nine heavenly formation master, Weng Fan, brought a group of grade eight heavenly formation masters and were currently controlling the grand array vigorously.

The Heaven One army was like fish in water inside the grand array!

They did not show the slightest leniency, killing the blood race powerhouses wantonly.

“Motherf*cker! Your Father has never killed so satisfyingly before! Hahaha ...”

“Awesome! Awesome! How is this killing people? This is simply killing pigs!” “Blood race bastards, you guys have today too! Hahaha ... Your Father is going to kill all of

you!”

... ...

Heaven One army’s powerhouses were all satisfied to the extreme.

Under the cooperation of the grand array, the blood race powerhouses could not stand up to a single blow at all!

They had never killed the blood race so satisfyingly before!

This was a massacre to their heart’s content!

In the past, even if there was the help of the city protecting grand array, they were unable to obliterate the blood race thoroughly too.

So each great battle, the blood race would have many wounded but few deaths.

Could not beat, just directly retreat. They could not do anything at all. While on Heaven One’s side, if they died, they would really be dead!

But today was completely different!

This was a one-sided slaughter!

Feng Xiaotian slammed a punch out, directly killing an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse!

Awesome!

Too satisfying! Killing Emperor Sakra Heavens like killing dogs! Ye Yuan, you’re really too remarkable!

“Bloodpromise, didn’t you want to drink my blood? Don’t run!”

Amidst the loud laughter, Feng Xiaotian chased after him!
