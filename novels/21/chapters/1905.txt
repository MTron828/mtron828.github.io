Chapter 1909: Crazy Idea

“Disciple?”

Ye Yuan frowned and could not come up with anything after thinking for a long time. When did he take in a disciple?

But, thinking about it, it also seemed like no one dared to come and impersonate as his disciple currently, right?

“Let him come in,” Ye Yuan instructed.

Not long after, Ning Tianping led a young man in, his handsome face like carved jade, elegant and natural.

“Master!” When the young man saw Ye Yuan, he had a look of wild elation on his face, pressing his head onto the ground.

Seeing the other party, Ye Yuan also finally recalled who this disciple was and was immediately overjoyed.

“Bai Chen!”

This young man was precisely the disciple that Ye Yuan took in back then in the Sky Foothill World. It was White Night Sacred Palace’s palace lord, Bai Chen.

Parting for close to a thousand years, Ye Yuan did not expect that he actually came to find him, and immediately felt very warm.

The Ning Tianping and Zuo Shujie by the side both had strange expressions when they saw this scene.

This peak Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse actually called master when he saw Ye Yuan. It seemed somewhat strange no matter what.

They naturally did not feel that Ye Yuan did not have the qualification. It was just that the disciple’s realm was even higher than the master’s, this was indeed rather unusual.

Furthermore, this Bai Chen was also too young, to actually already have peak Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity cultivation. It made them feel very odd.

“Tsk tsk, Your Excellency is Your Excellency, even taking in a disciple is so incredible!” Ning Tianping said with vicissitudes of emotion.

“You followed His Excellency for so long, have you seen His Excellency accept disciples before?” Zuo Shujie asked.

Ning Tianping shook his head and said, “Never seen before.”

Zuo Shujie’s pupils shrunk and he said in surprise, “Then doesn’t that mean that His Excellency already accepted this disciple before coming to Heavenly Eagle? This disciple ... is also too heaven-defying, right?”

Bai Chen’s age was even younger than Ye Yuan, how could he have such horrifying cultivation speed?

“Haha, quickly get up! I didn’t expect that what you refined was actually a peak Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity Dao Fruit, your present realm is actually above mine!” Ye Yuan had a rare bout of hearty laughter.

It could be said that he watched Bai Chen grow up.

To be able to have such accomplishments presently, he was naturally happy.

Peak Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity, although it did not count as some impressive big shot, it was also considered a powerhouse of a region already.

When Ning Tianping and Zuo Shujie heard this, only then did they come to a realization. Turned out that Bai Chen actually refined a Celestial Deity Dao Fruit to cultivate so quickly.

Bai Chen blushed with shame and said, “Master, don’t make fun of me anymore. Master’s cultivation speed is simply terrifying. In less than a short thousand years, you cultivated from Grotto Profound Realm to your present realm; it’s seldom-seen universally! Furthermore, Master still has infinite potential, but I no longer have the possibility of breaking through!”

Talking up to here, a hint of dejection flashed across in Bai Chen’s gaze.

To the him back then, Celestial Deity Realm was an existence too lofty to reach, a realm impossible to reach throughout his entire life.

But now, he was the master of Sky Foothill, a Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse. His horizons were already different from normal.

In this Heavenspan World, there was still an entirely different world!

Back then, Ye Yuan also warned him before. But at that time, on the one hand, he was forced by the circumstances. On the other hand, he acknowledged that he could not reach his present realm.

But now, when he really fully refined the Dao Fruit, he somewhat felt a sense of loss.

The road was chosen by him, he did not regret it. But the sense of loss in his heart could not be avoided.

Especially after seeing Ye Yuan, this kind of feeling became increasingly stronger.

Seeing Bai Chen’s appearance, Ye Yuan also sighed.

Bai Chen’s talent was pretty good in the Sky Foothill World. But with his talent, it was very hard to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm.

Refining the Dao Fruit was indeed a very decent choice for him.

But human desire was ever expanding. Who could be willing to never make progress for all their lives?

Moreover, Bai Chen was still so young.

Thinking up to here, a crazy idea suddenly appeared in Ye Yuan’s mind.

Did people who refined Dao Fruits really had no hopes of advancing ranks anymore?

Perhaps, perhaps he could invent a medicinal pill that could let people who refined Dao Fruits advance ranks?

As soon as this idea was born, it could not be stopped no matter what.

“Bai Chen, heaven doesn’t seal off all paths! Maybe there’s still a way. Coming to find me this time, what plans do you have?” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

Bai Chen thought that Ye Yuan was consoling him and just forced a smile.

After Bai Chen refined the Dao Fruit, he discovered that he was unable to comprehend Heavenly Dao anymore. His cultivation also would not have any growth.

No matter how hard he worked, it could not change this result either. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Only then did he know that his master did not bluff him.

There was really no hope at all!

He was different from those people on their deathbeds snatching for Dao Fruits. He was too young.

He was unwilling, so he ran out of the Sky Foothill World, wanting to come to the Heavenspan World to seek out lucky chances.

He came to find Ye Yuan before, but at that time, Ye Yuan already left Heavenly Eagle, his whereabouts not known.

Hence, he started drifting around in the Heavenspan World.

But the more he came into contact with, the more he despaired.

He knew that once refined a Dao Fruit, there was no more possibility of breaking through. Unless one refined an even stronger Dao Fruit.

But this difficulty was too great!

The higher Dao Fruits went, the rarer they got. The chances of appearing were too low.

Furthermore, each time they appeared, there were countless powerhouses who went to snatch it.

Hence, Bai Chen became more and more in despair.

“Master, I wish to stay by your side. If you have anything that you need this disciple to do, this disciple will carry out my obligations!” Bai Chen said.

Bai Chen was very grateful toward Ye Yuan. Without Ye Yuan, he would have long died, let alone become Sky Foothill World’s sovereign.

Now, his cultivation realm could still do a little something for Ye Yuan. Another few more years, he probably would not even have the opportunity to do miscellaneous chores for Ye Yuan anymore.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Tianping, go and call them together, I’ll introduce to them this disciple of mine.”

Ye Yuan introduced Heavenly Eagle’s Celestial Deity Realms, everyone also became acquainted with this disciple of Ye Yuan’s.

It was just that in their hearts, everyone still looked down on him, this Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity. It was just that no one expressed it.

Among these people included Ning Tianping, White Light, as well as Leng Qiuling and the rest.

Martial artists who refined Dao Fruits, everyone would have some discrimination in their hearts.

Firstly, this was something earned without any labor toiled. Secondly, this kind of person’s potential was already exhausted and it was impossible to break through anymore.

If Bai Chen went to an ordinary imperial city, everyone naturally would not have this kind of thought. But following by Ye Yuan’s side, everyone had limitless futures.

Only Bai Chen would never be able to improve.

Hence, even though Bai Chen was presently the highest cultivation realm in Southridge Ten Cities, the number two powerhouse in martial prowess, everyone actually more or less had scorn in their hearts.

This kind of subtle atmosphere, Bai Chen could also feel it himself.

But, for Ye Yuan’s sake, he endured it.

Ye Yuan could naturally see it clearly too, but he did not say anything.

This matter, he did not dare to say for certain either. Hence, he did not say it to anyone.

Furthermore, right at this time, Nine Pledge Imperial Capital that side also sent people.

On this day, Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s City Lord Manor sent several martial artists, detaining a prisoner, arriving at Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

The one in the front was a young man.

This young man was a little older than Yu Jinsong, but he had some similarities with him between his eyebrows.

Seeing Ye Yuan, that young man bowed in salute and said, “I’m Yu Changyun. I come here specially to pay respects to Lord Patrolling Inspector on Father’s command.”
