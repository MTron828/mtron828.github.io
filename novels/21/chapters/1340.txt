Chapter 1344: Giving It to You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Did you guys hear? The Myriad Treasure Tower already let out the word. They are going to launch a new kind of medicinal pill called ... called what again?”

“Essence Cultivating Pill!”

“Right, right, right! It’s Essence Cultivating Pill! Goodness gracious, it’s remarkable! I heard that this Essence Cultivating Pill’s medicinal effects are double that of the Essence Increasing Pill!”

“You believe that too? Do you think that it’s selling cabbages at the market? Do you know what kind of concept double is?”

“Makes sense. I reckon that it’s the Myriad Treasure Tower can’t sustain anymore, deliberately coming up with this gimmick to attract customers. Honestly speaking, our Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower is indeed a little weak.”

“Mm, but in order to compete with the Myriad Treasure Tower, the Wang Family benefited us, these bottom-level martial artists. Whether or not the Myriad Treasure Tower can stir up any wave, we’ll just wait and see.”

...

The word that the Myriad Treasure Tower let out continued brewing in Jewelhill City.

But the majority of the people were not optimistic about the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Essence Cultivating Pill, this medicinal pill, nobody had heard of it before at all.

At least, within the entire Wu Meng Capital City’s area, no one had heard of such a heaven-defying medicinal pill before.

Even when Yang Rui heard Ye Yuan’s words, he had a look of disbelief, let alone these ordinary martial artists.

At the Wang Family’s residence, numerous high-level members were all scoffing at this matter.

“Elder Xuan, in your opinion, how great are the chances of the Myriad Treasure Tower being able to bring out this Essence Cultivating Pill?” Wang Su asked.

Wang Xuanfeng stroked his beard and smiled, saying disdainfully, “In my view, not even 10%! The Essence Increasing Pill’s formula has been circulated in the Heavenspan World for no less than a hundred million years. It had long been developed to the limits already. How can a medicinal pill even stronger than it possibly appears? Take ten thousand steps back, even if that kid really has the ability to defy the heavens and improve the pill formula, increasing 5% on top of the current foundation is already reaching the acme of perfection. Double the medicinal efficacy, hur hur, nonsense!”

Hearing Wang Xuanfeng’s words, the last trace of doubt in everyone’s hearts also dissipated into nothing.

“Since that’s the case, then it’s the Myriad Treasure Tower that’s at the end of its ropes?” Wang Yuxiang said.

Wang Xuanfeng smiled and said, “I think they should be failing already. All these years, they have probably reached the limit already.”

Wang Xuanfeng’s words made everyone heaved a long sigh of relief.

This fierce battle that had lasted for close to 30 years could finally end.

Finally, it still ended with the Myriad Treasure Tower’s defeat.

Wang Yuxiang said joyfully, “Squeezing away the Myriad Treasure Tower, it was all thanks to Sir Su and Elder Xuan! Once the Myriad Treasure Tower leaves, Sir Su and Elder Xuan’s cultivation resources will be fully covered by Jewelhill City’s branch family!”

“Huhu, Elder Yuxiang don’t need to be courteous, Jewelhill City’s branch family and Brightraise City’s main family are of the same breath and branch, bound together for good or ill,” Wang Su said with a laugh.

Wang Yuxiang was slightly fearful in his heart, secretly alarmed by this Wang Su’s experience and cunningness.

These words sounded like it was refusing, and also like accepting, leaving you scratching your head. It was equivalent to not saying anything.

But not saying was equivalent to saying it.

Brightraise City’s main family’s young generation, the competition was very fierce too.

For Wang Su to want to charge out of the heavy encirclement, it inevitably could not dispense with the support of resources from all around.

Therefore, saying these words were actually equivalent to accepting Jewelhill City’s branch family’s drawing closer.

Wang Yuxiang was a figure who became shrewd with age as well. He naturally would not fail to discern the meaning of Wang Su’s words.

“Sir Su, Elder Xuan, once the Myriad Treasure Tower falls, our Jewelhill City branch family’s grudge can be avenged!” A glimmer of cold light flashed across in Wang Yuxiang’s eyes.

Wang Xuanfeng smiled and said, “That is, of course! That kid is merely a guest alchemist. With the two of us around, Yang Rui won’t dare to be impudent too.”

Once the Myriad Treasure Tower withdrew, Ye Yuan would be a rootless duckweed.

How he was to be kneaded, wasn’t it still up to others?

The Wang Family had two mighty Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses. Wasn’t dealing with a Ye Yuan capturing with ease?

...

Half a month later, Ye Yuan exited seclusion.

When Yang Rui saw Ye Yuan, he could not help jumping in fright, an expression like having seen a ghost.

“You ... How did you break through?”

Half a month ago, Ye Yuan was clearly still a long way off from middle-stage Grotto Profound.

Half a month later, he broke through?

This kind of speed was also a little too fast, right?

Ordinary martial artists cultivating, from initial-stage Grotto Profound to middle-stage Grotto Profound, it needed several thousand years no matter what.

Even geniuses with exceedingly good talent, extremely powerful cultivation methods, under the accumulation of large quantities of medicinal pills, it also needed to expend several hundred year’s time.

Before leaving seclusion the last time, Ye Yuan’s cultivation speed was not so astonishing yet.

But this time, it was truly a bit too fast.

Breaking through in 15 days, could it be that there was no bottleneck?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Had some enlightenment during the previous closed-seclusion. The closed-seclusion this time, broke through the bottleneck in one shot. Tower Lord knows it. Not only do I have divine-grade Divine Essence Pills on me, but also there are even divine-grade Essence Cultivating Pills.”

Yang Rui trembled all over, and he said in surprise, “You really refined the Essence Cultivating Pill?”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Could it be that tower lord really thought that I was joking with you? You look!”

A small medicinal bottle appeared in Ye Yuan’s hand. Upon opening, medicinal fragrance overflowed.

Such plentiful medicinal strength!

Yang Rui received the medicinal pill with pleasant surprise and examined it carefully.

When laying eyes on this Essence Cultivating Pill for the first time, Yang Rui was incomparably certained in his heart that the Myriad Treasure Tower would survive!

Even though it was impossible to judge the strength of the medicinal strength from the appearance, that abundant medicinal strength filled him with confidence.

“Younger Brother, can ... can I try it?” Yang Rui asked with some agitation.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course you can!”

Yang Rui sent the medicinal pill into his mouth with a slight fluster. Once the medicinal entered the mouth, a surge of majestic medicinal strength instantly filled the whole body.

He clearly felt his divine essence that had not moved for a long time actually have a slight trace of increase!

This discovery made Yang Rui incomparably shocked.

Logically speaking, with his realm, this level of medicinal pill was already completely useless to him.

Even if Ye Yuan claimed that this medicinal pill’s medicinal efficacy was double of the Essence Increasing Pill!

But that sort of feeling absolutely would not be wrong.

His divine essence really had a slight trace of increase!

When the Su Linpu by the side saw that the expression on Yang Rui’s face was extremely fascinating, he could not resist asking, “How is it, Tower Lord?”

Yang Rui ignored him, but turned towards Ye Yuan with a look of wild ecstasy and said, “Younger Brother Ye, you’re really exceptional! I can be sure that as soon as this medicinal pill is rolled out, probably the entire Heavenspan World will go crazy because of it! This Essence Cultivating Pill truly brings benefits to the entire Heavenspan World’s bottom-level martial artists!”

Su Linpu’s expression changed, sighing with amazement.

The weight of Yang Rui’s words were too heavy! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Benefiting the entire Heavenspan World, it could be seen that this medicinal pill was absolutely heaven-defying to the max.

This evaluation was too high!

But Ye Yuan smiled and fished out a jade slip, saying with a smile, “This is the Essence Cultivating Pill’s pill formula, I’ll give it to Tower Lord. These few years, this Ye received the Myriad Treasure Tower’s great grace. I have nothing to repay it with. I’ll use this Essence Cultivating Pill’s pill formula as payment.”

Yang Rui’s entire body trembled, using an extremely skeptical gaze to look at Ye Yuan and said, “Younger Brother Ye, you ... you aren’t joking, right? Do you really not know what this Essence Cultivating Pill means?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s precisely because I know it. Hence, that’s why I’m giving it to Tower Lord.”
