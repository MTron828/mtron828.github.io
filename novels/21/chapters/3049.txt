Chapter 3048: Perfect!

“This ... It has already been three days. His divine essence doesn’t have the slightest sign of dying up!”

“Not only is his divine essence fine, but it also seems like there are no signs of too much mental malaise. Is this guy really Emperor Vast Heaven?”

“Could it be that he can really successfully refine these 2000 heavenly pills? If that’s really the case, then it will really be incredible!”

... ...

Three days passed in a blink of an eye. Things did not go as Zhou Xianchen and the rest expected.

Fatigue was a certainty, but Ye Yuan did not show overly obvious symptoms.

Zhou Xianchen’s expression became uglier and uglier.

But there was more uncertainty.

“Could it be that this guy is forcibly holding out? Actually, he has long already ruined the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills? Right, it must be like this!” Zhou Xianchen said with certainty.

Because apart from this possibility, he could not think of other possibilities.

...

“That’s right. In my view, the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills have long been ruined already! This boy is merely holding out for face; that’s all. Otherwise, with his realm, how can he possibly sustain for such a long time?” Jinnan said.

Hence, everyone regained confidence, waiting to see Ye Yuan become a joke.

On the fifth day, some people became impatient.

“Boy, are you going to refine until heaven and earth get old?”

“If you can’t, admit defeat earlier! It will only be more embarrassing like this!”

“To refine 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills, you’re still calm and relaxed until now. Do you take all of us to be fools?”

... ...

At this time, practically everyone felt that Ye Yuan was just performing.

They believed those heavenly medicines had long already been ruined.

Because up till now, Ye Yuan was still rather relaxed.

This kind of performance was seriously too clumsy in their view.

Yang Qing smiled coldly and said, “Zhou Xianchen, I remember when you refined 300 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills, you spent five days too, right? Ye Yuan is refining 2000, he’ll naturally take longer than you! Keep yelling, and Your Father will stab you with a spear!”

Zhou Xianchen’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “With my strength, refining 300 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills is rather taxing too. This punk is refining 2000 pills and still so calm and relaxed. Isn’t he fooling everyone?”

Yang Qing said disdainfully, “How can a foolish person like you understand the methods of a genius?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Xianchen was furious!

His Alchemy Dao talent reigned supreme across the 33 Heavens. He was a distinguished talent among the junior generation.

When had he been called a nincompoop by someone before?

Yang Qing this guy really deserved death!

But sadly, Yang Qing had already broken through to Emperor Sakra Heaven. He was not Yang Qing’s match at all.

On the seventh day, everyone already lost patience.

“Liar, when are you guys going to drag it out until?”

“Can’t take it anymore. We request to forcefully interrupt!”

“Kid, without genuine ability, don’t go and do what you can’t accomplish! Is it very interesting to puff yourself up at your own cost?”

... ...

Many people were cursing away. Some people even tried to interrupt Ye Yuan’s refinement.

Yang Qing snorted coldly and put his spear horizontally as he said, “Try moving! Ask the spear in your Grandpa Yang’s hands whether it agrees or not first!”

Then these people shut up.

One Yang Qing was not scary.

But 50 thousand people were standing behind Yang Qing!

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s aura suddenly swept, and he gave a cold cry “Go”!

The nirvanic rebirth fire instantly dissipated. One heavenly pill after another tore through the air, flying straight into the hands of those Emperor Vast Heavens.

Before this, he had already selected 2000 people.

Vertical Heaven Stairs and Thousand Souls Hall, Ye Yuan had actually been observing a group of people besides explaining Dao too.

These 2000 people were all very promising.

Hu Gaoshan was one of them.

He had already reached grand completion Emperor Vast Heaven too, but he did not reach the peak and was still short of a final push.

Logically speaking, he was the same as Yang Qing, not suited to assault Emperor Sakra Heaven.

Without full preparations, assaulting Emperor Sakra Heaven rashly would have very severe consequences.

The Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill in his hand was naturally origin grade without a doubt.

But, even if it was origin grade, there was also no guarantee that he could succeed.

After all, not everyone was a freak like Yang Qing.

But at this time, the entire audience was already in an uproar.

Because these 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills were all origin grade!

The quality of each one was not inferior to what Zhou Xianchen refined.

However, even Zhou Xianchen’s 300 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills, there were occasionally some defective products too.

Although the quality of these defective products did not drop out of origin grade, it was still quite poor compared to the others.

There were differences in origin grade too.

But the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills in these 2000 people’s hands seemingly came out of the pipeline. The quality of each one was perfect and flawless!

Those present were all experts. The quality of the heavenly pills was clear at a glance.

Hence, everyone was shocked.

“He ... He actually really did it! How is this possible?”

“It’s hard to imagine! Those 2000 heavenly pills, the quality actually doesn’t err by a hair’s breadth! How perfect a refinement is needed to achieve this!”

“What’s even more damnable is that he actually refined 2000 heavenly pills with plenty of room to maneuver! Didn’t Young Master Zhou say that only grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven can have such strong divine essence?”

“His effortlessness before was actually not feigned! This is also too freaking impossible, right?”

... ...

Those people who were originally mocking all fell into an incredulous shock at this time.

They racked their brains and also could not figure out how Ye Yuan completed an impossible matter!

Right under their eyelids!

Zhou Xianchen was already dumbfounded. He was stunned by this spectacular scene.

Each Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill in those 2000 people’s hands were seemingly perfect replicas.

Reaching his realm, he was even more able to understand what astonishing control power this required!

With regards to divine essence, refinement technique, origin divinity, all of it could not make the slightest oversight and mistake.

This sort of thing, forget about Emperor Vast Heaven; even if it was a Hegemon Realm expert, they might not be able to do it too.

But Ye Yuan did it!

How could there be such a monstrous person in this world?

He could discern at a glance that the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills Ye Yuan refined, the quality did not lose to his in the slightest.

In fact, it was a fraction stronger.

But Ye Yuan refined 2000 at the same time!

This disparity, as long as one was not blind, they could be able to tell!

“I, Zhou Xianchen, was actually crushed by an unknown kid?” Zhou Xianchen said somewhat blankly.

Jinnan and Chu Fang were stunned too!

They had long already been confident that Ye Yuan was definitely putting on a show.

But at this time, Ye Yuan used powerful strength to slap their faces hard!

Made them understand that there was always someone better, heaven beyond heaven!

“Hahaha ... Dumbfounded, right? I told you long ago that you morons can’t understand the methods of a genius! Ye Yuan, this guy, is just that tiny bit worse than this emperor. Wouldn’t suppressing you fooling guys be an effortless thing?” Yang Qing said with a loud laugh.

Everyone exchanged glances and actually had nothing to say in response.

Yeah, those who came here were all geniuses among geniuses.

But they were nothing in front of Ye Yuan and Yang Qing!

Yang Qing swept away the geniuses from all heavens, dominating the All-Heavens List and Thousand Souls List by himself, shocking the 33 Heavens.

Ye Yuan refined 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills simultaneously, crushing the alchemy path geniuses from all heavens!

Even Zhou Xianchen, this alchemy path’s number one genius, was completely crushed too!
