Chapter 1511 I Have “Yielded“

After Ye Yuan left, Yi Han’s figure appeared.

“Lord Heavenstar, I didn’t expect that you actually employed the Blood Soul Curse!” Yi Han said with some surprise.

The Blood Soul Curse was extremely powerful. Even if it was a Fiend Lord powerhouse, once succumbed, they would wish that they were dead too, without any room to resist.

Using it to deal with Ye Yuan was simply using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken.

Moreover, the materials to prepare the Blood Soul Curse originally needed to expend a lot of manpower and material resources before it can be successfully refined.

Just a pot of Bloodgod Tea was a priceless treasure.

Even the Blood Yama Hall would rarely use it too.

Blood Soul Curse was normally in order to deal with some very troublesome characters.

Heavenstar smiled faintly and said, “Using the Blood Soul Curse to deal with a major figure who might become the Medicine Ancestor, it’s definitely worthwhile!”

Yi Han was still rather worried as she said, “This kid is someone who would rather break than bend. Is the Blood Soul Curse really effective?”

Heavenstar laughed loudly and said, “Effective? Take away the question mark! There was once a half-step Fiend King’s existence. After falling under the Blood Soul Curse, he laid prone in front of Lord Hall Master like a dog, begging for mercy. This kid is merely a Fiend General. Do you think it will be effective or not?”

Yi Han’s gaze turned intent, clearly incomparably shocked.

Half-step Fiend King, what kind of powerful existence was that?

In front of the Blood Soul Curse, he actually did not have any ability to resist at all!

Yi Han only knew that the Blood Soul Curse was powerful, but did not know how powerful the Blood Soul Curse was.

The example that Heavenstar gave let her have an intuitive understanding.

Heavenstar continued, “The Blood Soul Curse won’t kill. But the curse power of countless resentful souls, that agony of the soul being devoured, no matter how powerful the person’s mind, they can’t withstand it too. Tonight, let this boy experience it a little. I think that he’ll take the initiative to come and find me very soon, hahaha ...”

Talking about the exciting part, Heavenstar could not refrain from letting out a big laugh.

For the Blood Yama Hall to be able to solicit an alchemy genius who could trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody, how could Heavenstar not be happy?

“But, does he know that we’re playing tricks?” Yi Han asked.

“Heh, although this boy is stubborn and unruly, he’s incredibly smart! As long as he gets hit by the Blood Soul Curse, he’ll know that it’s definitely related to us,” Heavenstar said.

...

It was nighttime. Ye Yuan continued to meditate and visualize in front of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, deducing the Chaos Heavenspan Canon’s third level cultivation method.

Suddenly, the Soul Suppressing Pearl in his sea of consciousness moved strangely.

“Heh, indeed came! That old punk thinks of himself to be clever, but he doesn’t know that it became a wedding gift for this old man!”

Dustless laughed coldly. The Soul Suppressing Pearl exited Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness silently and suspended on top of his head.

The Soul Suppressing Pearl emitted rays of dark-red light, appearing very strange.

But inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl, Dustless started chortling with laughter, “The soul force curse of the Blood Soul Curse is simply a great tonic! With this soul force curse, I should be able to recover to Tier 3!”

Ye Yuan was still immersed in the visualization and was completely oblivious to the outside world’s events.

Dustless told him not to bother about anything and just care about cultivating.

Amidst the dark-red light, the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s aura became stronger and stronger.

Dustless’s entire person was also coiled up by the dark-red light, his entire person looking seemingly somewhat strange and demonic.

But his aura gradually became stronger.

In the secret room, sweat gradually seeped out on Heavenstar’s forehead.

“This brat is also too able to hold out, to actually still not yield until now!”

Activating the Blood Soul Curse had to use one’s soul force as a guide to lead the resentment in the Soul Refining Lamps out.

The person being cast on naturally would not give in obediently. The other party would definitely use their soul force to resist the power of the curse.

When the other party utterly gave up resisting, Heavenstar would be much more relaxed and not need to expend so much soul force.

Heavenstar completely did not think that a puny little Fiend General could actually resist for so long.

How could he know that his opponent was not Ye Yuan at all, but an old monster who had lived for goodness knows how long.

Furthermore, this old monster was even the Blood Soul Curse’s jinx.

The current Dustless was simply feeling way too good.

While Ye Yuan was currently immersed in creating the cultivation method and unable to extricate himself.

“Indeed worthy of being a genius able to trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody. This willpower, this soul force, it’s not what a Fiend General should have at all,” Heavenstar also secretly praised.

Finally, Heavenstar felt the soul force ease up. Clearly, the other party had given up resisting.

A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Heavenstar’s mouth and he said, “Heh, even if your talent is outstanding, under the Blood Soul Curse, you can only submit obediently too! Forget it, I will only torture you for two hours tonight. If you don’t come tomorrow, I’ll continue again tomorrow!”

Two hours later, Heavenstar withdrew the technique contentedly.

In his mind, after Ye Yuan was brought to the limits, he should be lying prone on the ground right now, without any strength at all.

The second night, Heavenstar expended a Herculean effort again before ‘settling’ Ye Yuan.

Five days passed consecutively, even Heavenstar himself felt like it was a little more than he could bite off. But he still did not see Ye Yuan coming over to submit.

But Yi Han was somewhat anxious already and said to Heavenstar, “Lord Heavenstar, could this boy have played some trick and didn’t get hit by the Blood Soul Curse at all?”

Heavenstar’s face fell and he said, “Nonsense! This old man watched him drink the Bloodgod Tea with my own eyes. Could it be that a puny little Fiend General can play sleight of hand in front of me?”

Yi Han thought about it and also felt that it was not too likely.

But a measly little Fiend General was actually able to hold out for five days. This made the two of them feel unimaginably queer.

“I don’t mean that. What I meant was ...”

“No need to say anymore! This boy can trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody, he can’t be judged with common sense in the first place. Tonight, I’ll increase the Blood Soul Curse’s power, let him know what’s truly called agonizing until he wished he was dead! I don’t believe that he can still not yield!” Heavenstar said in a cold voice.

But inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl’s space, Dustless had a satisfied look.

Absorbing the soul force curse these few nights already let him recover to the state of Tier 3.

“Gui Yun, advantages can’t be taken up by me alone. Today, your turn. This power of curse is similarly a great tonic to you. One night should be enough for you to break through to Three-star!” Dustless said with a hearty laugh.

Gui Yun’s strength had long reached peak Two-star already.

Now, with Dustless’s help, breaking through to Three-star was something that would happen without extra effort.

The moment Gui Yun heard, he was overjoyed and said, “Many thanks, Senior!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Dustless smiled and said, “Still saying this to me for what? It’s here! You prepare yourself, assault Three-star!”

...

Another full night passed, even with Heavenstar’s soul force, he was somewhat collapsing too.

But it was also precisely because of this that he was even more confident in Ye Yuan’s prospects.

A genius with hopes of reaching the Medicine Ancestor’s heights was naturally extraordinary!

The second day morning, Ye Yuan withdrew from within the World Suppressing Stele’s space.

“Master!” Gui Yun bowed down to Ye Yuan and said.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said in surprise, “You broke through?”

Gui Yun also smiled and said, “All thanks to Senior Dustless. Last night, I borrowed the power of the curse and successfully broke through to Three-star!”

Ye Yuan laughed out loud when he heard that and said, “This old man really gave us a big gift! Uh, it’s time to go and ‘yield’. Otherwise, that old boy will probably go crazy!”
