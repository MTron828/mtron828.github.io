Chapter 1922: Darkpine Courtyard

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This sleep, Ye Yuan slept very well, sleeping all the way for ten days and nights.

To Deity Realm powerhouses, they already did not need sleep to recover their state.

But this time, Ye Yuan’s mental strength was exhausted too greatly, and needed deep sleep before he could recover his state.

On this day, Ye Yuan finally woke up. He discovered that a pair of large eyes were currently staring at him.

A pig nose was currently pressed against his nose.

“Treasure Pig? Tong’er went into closed-seclusion?” Ye Yuan came to a realization very quickly.

“Grunt! Grunt!”

Treasure Pig nodded its head repeatedly. Ye Yuan had a revelation.

“Your Excellency, you finally woke up! Tong’er consumed the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill and already returned to the Purple Extreme Hall to go into a closed-seclusion.” Ning Tianping said.

These few days, Ning Tianping few people had always been keeping watch over Ye Yuan.

Seeing him wake up at this time, they also let out a long sigh in relief.

Ye Yuan slowly got up and said with a nod, “Delayed for a very long time, it’s time to do proper business.”

Xiao Feng’s gaze turned intent and he said, “What do you want to do?”

Ye Yuan said, “Isn’t it said that Empyrean Flutterfeather set up an Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, using alchemy battles to determine the rank of the alchemy god? Then let’s go take a look!”

When Xiao Feng heard that, his eyes could not help lighting up. Slapping his thigh hard, he said, “Man, I’m really stupid, why didn’t I think of this? With your strength, wouldn’t everyone still fight to cooperate with us when the time comes? This matter brooks no delay. Let’s quickly go over!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No rush! The pill refinement this time, I had some gains. Wait for me to sort it out. Tomorrow morning, we’ll go to the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion.”

Meditating in closed-seclusion, Ye Yuan really had many thoughts and feelings.

What Tong’er said was right, the pill refinement this time was indeed the greatest challenge that he encountered in his life.

Even when refining the Dao Defying Pill back then, it was also not as painful and exhausting as now.

Ye Yuan spent more than 20 days to deduce the medicinal properties and to continuously compare the spirit medicines, finding errors and omissions and re-deducing.

Deducing entirely the medicinal properties, Ye Yuan started deriving the pill formula.

Just like that, one month’s time, Ye Yuan was immersed in extremely intense deductions.

How could he not be tired?

But he was extremely satisfied with the final results.

To be able to refine the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill into vast spirit divine-grade, Ye Yuan himself also felt very accomplished.

And this also made him have a deeper understanding of the medicinal properties of spirit medicines.

The medicinal properties of spirit medicines did not exist in solitary. There were very deep connections intrinsically too. It was just that this kind of connection was too complicated. The deductions were naturally not as direct as directly comprehending them.

But, after really deducing it, the benefits were naturally immense.

Although this could not help Ye Yuan to break through to the Ancestor Realm, it consolidated his alchemy foundation.

A night quietly passed.

On the second day, Ye Yuan went out of the pill refining room, settled the bill, and left the Hundred Herb Gathering.

The Hundred Herb Gathering’s pill refining room’s rent was extremely high. Renting the pill refining room for more than 40 days in a row, Ye Yuan also spent a considerable fee, making his flesh hurt.

The party was currently walking on the streets when suddenly, a manservant-looking young man blocked Ye Yuan’s path.

The manservant asked, “May I ask if it’s Lord Ye Yuan?”

Ye Yuan was somewhat puzzled, but still nodded and said, “That’s right, I’m Ye Yuan, looking for me for?”

The manservant said, “Just now, someone had me pass a word to you. If you want to see Elder Jiang Yuan, you can go to Linnan Street’s Darkpine Courtyard.”

When Ye Yuan heard that, his two eyes narrowed slightly and he said smilingly, “You go back and tell him that I’m not interested.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought everyone and directly left.

The moment this manservant spoke, Ye Yuan knew that this person must have been sent by Jiang Hua.

Although everyone hoped to request an audience with Jiang Yuan back then inside the gatehouse, it might also be those people. But the greatest likelihood was still Jiang Hua.

This Jiang Hua felt that he definitely could not find the connections, so he deliberately found someone to draw his attention, so as to make a move against him.

Ye Yuan sneered coldly in his heart, Jiang Hua was bullying him depending on the latter being young, green, and inexperienced. Did he feel that using this kind of method could lure Ye Yuan to a remote place to dispose of?

He was also looking down on him too much!

Disregarding that he had seen through Jiang Hua’s thoughts, even if he did not see through, Ye Yuan also did not plan on going to ask Jiang Yuan again.

A good man did not backtrack.

Even if Ye Yuan found Springwind Hall to cooperate in the end, that would also be Jiang Yuan coming to beg him, and not him going to beg Jiang Yuan.

...

At Darkpine Courtyard, when Qin Guan heard the manservant’s report, his brows could not help furrowing.

“Could it be that this punk doesn’t wish to request an audience with Elder Jiang Yuan?”

Jiang Hua smiled coldly and said, “This punk has some backbone! But him not coming doesn’t mean that I can’t take care of him! You go and make another trip, tell Ye Yuan in this manner, he’ll definitely follow you here!”

Jiang Hua said a few sentences to the manservant, the manservant immediately received the order and left.

Qin Guan listened by the side and could not help giving a thumbs up, praising, “Heh, impressive! Indeed impressive! Younger Brother Jiang Hua is well-deserving of being the favorite in front of Family Head!”

Jiang Hua smiled with narrowed eyes as he said, “If I can’t even take care of a Celestial Deity Realm brat, I, this steward, would also have been alive in vain. Elder Brother, I’ll leave this place to you. Family Head still had me run some affairs. I’ll leave first.”

Qin Guan smiled faintly and said, “You go and work; leave this kind of trivial thing to me.”

Not long after the manservant left, he indeed led Ye Yuan over.

Furthermore, there was just Ye Yuan alone.

Entering Darkpine Courtyard, Ye Yuan felt that he got caught in an array formation.

It was just that this level of array formation, Ye Yuan did not place it in his sights at all.

With his present spatial law strength, wanting to escape was not a difficult thing.

Entering the courtyard, a middle-aged man was currently pouring himself a cup of wine and drinking himself.

The manservant said respectfully, “Master, Ye Yuan is brought over.”

Qin Guan waved his hand, the manservant immediately left.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed slightly. Looking at Qin Guan, he said, “It was you who used Brother Xiao’s life to threaten me?”

That manservant found Ye Yuan again and told Ye Yuan that Xiao Feng was Springwind Hall’s disciple.

If he did not come to Darkpine Courtyard, then Xiao Feng would die very horribly!

Indeed, with Jiang Hua’s status, dealing with a puny little low-level deacon was truly too easy.

Even though he was just a measly steward.

With Jiang Yuan’s power and influence, as long as Jiang Hua casually opened his mouth, he could doom Xiao Feng beyond redemption.

Qin Guan looked at Ye Yuan and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Brat, indeed arrogant enough! Arriving at my place here, you actually still dare to talk like this?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Where’s Jiang Hua?”

Qin Guan smiled and said, “You offended Younger Brother Jiang Hua and should know that you’d have today’s outcome. Either you die, or Xiao Feng dies! Of course, since you came here, it shows that you’ve already made the choice.”

Ye Yuan looked at Qin Guan and said coolly, “With just the likes of you?”

Qin Guan drank another cup of wine and said with a smile, “Already on your deathbed and you’re still being stubborn! If I can’t even take care of a puny little Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity, so many years of cultivation would also have been all for naught.”

Done talking, his gaze turned cold, a horrifying surge of world power suddenly erupted, enveloping the entire courtyard inside.

Qin Guan naturally did not dare to make a move on the streets, so he forced Ye Yuan into this Darkpine Courtyard in order to make it convenient to kill.

Ye Yuan looked at him like looking at an idiot, and said coolly, “Originally wanted to dispose of Jiang Hua, this trouble, but since he isn’t around, then you can only blame that you’re unlucky.”
