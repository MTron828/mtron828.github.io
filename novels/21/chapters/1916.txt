Chapter 1920: Obscure Medicinal Pill

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Chen Chang’s face revealed a hint of pity.

An alchemist capable of refining such a high-quality Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill was absolutely an extremely formidable figure.

Reaching his realm, being able to exchange pointers with such a character was much more important than an Earth Qilin.

Chen Chang looked at Ye Yuan and said with a nod, “Lad, following such a formidable figure, you have to cultivate well! Being able to learn 10%-20% of his abilities is sufficient for you to benefit for life.”

Ye Yuan’s attitude of acknowledging his fault made his impression of Ye Yuan become a little better.

A fault confessed was half-redressed.

It was just that he did not notice how odd the expressions of Bai Chen and Ning Tianping behind Ye Yuan were.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard this and said, “Yes, Junior will definitely work doubly hard from today onwards. Then ... can this junior put away this Earth Qilin?”

The corners of Chen Chang’s mouth twitched slightly. Waving his hand, he indicated for Ye Yuan to keep it.

This Earth Qilin was too precious. It could not be bought just by having money.

If not obtaining it this time,then no idea when he would have the chance to encounter it again next time.

Ye Yuan naturally would not be courteous either, lightly flicking his sleeves, he put away the Earth Qilin.

“Lad, I wonder what’s the name of your family’s grown-up? Where are you from?” Chen Chang clearly did not give up yet, wanting to inquire about Ye Yuan’s background.

It was just that how could Ye Yuan go and make up a background. So he just brushed it off by saying, “Master, my family repeatedly exhorted that I mustn’t reveal my background when traveling outside. Otherwise, I’ll be served with family punishment. I’m really sorry.”

When Chen Chang heard that, he could only heave a sigh with a helpless look, turned around, and left.

The middle-aged man in the felt hat kept the medicinal pill and said to Ye Yuan, “Little Brother, although this middle-age wasn’t personally refined by you, it’s a great help to me. The value of your medicinal pill already far surpassed the Earth Qilin. Whatever conditions that need to be added on, feel free to speak up.”

Originally, the value of a level nine difficulty rank five divine pill naturally far exceeded a rank five spirit medicine.

It was just that an Earth Qilin was too rare. That was how the middle-aged man in the felt hat could hike the price on the spot, using it to exchange for a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill.

Although he was a True God powerhouse, if really made him buy a divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, even if he smashed his iron pots and pans to sell as scrap iron, he could not afford it either.

A divine-grade Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill, even Chen Chang could not refine it, it could be imagined how valuable it was.

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “No need, just a medicinal pill. It doesn’t count as much. Just take it as making a friend.”

The middle-aged man in the felt hat was slightly taken aback, clearly not expecting that Ye Yuan was actually so generous,

But thinking about it, he also felt at ease.

With Ye Yuan’s background, he probably completely did not care for that bit of compensation, right?

“Little Brother, I’ll become friends with you! This time, just take it as me owing you a favor. If you need any help from me, Huo Zhen, feel free to open your mouth.” The middle-aged man in the felt hat cupped his fists, turned around, and left.

...

Inside the Hundred Herb Gathering’s pill refining room, Bai Chen and Ning Tianping both had reluctant looks on their faces.

Tong’er hugged Treasure Pig; a hint of dissatisfaction flashing across in his eyes. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I think that that old punk was clearly looking for a way out, truly preposterous!” Bai Chen said.

“That old man couldn’t refine the medicinal pill himself and yet, he still measured using the yardstick of a petty man, not believing that the medicinal pill was refined by you, what a joke! Ignorant!” Ning Tianping said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not vying, is vying. Your own strength only belongs to yourself, no need for other people’s recognition. That moment when they witness your power, why would there be a need to provide any explanations?”

Ning Tianping and Bai Chen’s pupils constricted, ruminating over Ye Yuan’s words.

Even Tong’er also looked at Ye Yuan in surprise.

He had lived for a long time and thought that he had long seen through the emptiness of the material world already but discovered that he was actually inferior to a child.

Ye Yuan’s state of mind had long transcended worldliness already. It was also no wonder that he could have his present accomplishments.

Ye Yuan looked at Tong’er and said, “It’s also that you’re lucky, and it’s also considered that my luck is decent. All in all, the spirit medicines are already gathered. This medicinal pill can begin to be refined.”

Tong’er said, “No matter whether it succeeds in refining or not, I owe you a favor!”

To an Empyrean powerhouse, becoming like Tong’er was clearly not reconciled to it.

This feeling of powerlessness, no one would like it.

Even if they gathered the spirit medicines, Tong’er also maintained a conservative attitude toward whether or not Ye Yuan could succeed in the pill refinement.

It was naturally not that Tong’er did not believe in Ye Yuan’s strength. The Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill was indeed not an ordinary medicinal pill; the refining difficulty was tremendous.

Even among level nine difficulty medicinal pills, it was also extremely difficult to refine.

This kind of medicine belonged to the extremely obscure kind. Barely anyone in this world heard of it before, and no more than a handful of people knew how to refine.

The spirit medicines used in this medicinal pill also belonged to those extremely obscure kinds.

Obscurity represented that the usage was extremely limited.

Never even heard of it before, how to refine it?

This kind of obscure medicinal pill was a huge challenge to every alchemist.

Forget about Ye Yuan, even when Tong’er himself was at his prime, he totally could not refine it as well.

If not for Ye Yuan reaching grand completion Dao Realm, he also would not request for Ye Yuan to refine this medicinal pill.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “You guys wait in the outer-room. I need to go into seclusion for a few days to understand the medicinal properties of these spirit medicines. After all, there’s no second chance.”

When the few people arrived in the outer-room, Tong’er’s expression suddenly became nervous.

“Lord Tong’er, my lord taking action, what are you still worried about? Since I started following him, I’ve never seen a medicinal pill that he can’t refine!” Seeing Tong’er’s nervous look, Ning Tianping found it rather funny as he said.

Tong’er rolled his eyes and said huffily, “What the hell do you know!”

The weight of the Earth Qilin was only sufficient for Ye Yuan to refine once, there was no opportunity for a second attempt.

Hence, Ye Yuan was extremely prudent as well.

Tong’er understood the difficulty of refining. He naturally understood it even more so than the others.

Being able to refine the level nine difficulty Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill did not mean being able to refine the similar difficulty Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill.

Pill refinement was another form of cultivation.

If say comprehending alchemy was inner-strength, then an understanding of pharmacology was external-strength[1].

Only by cultivating inner and external together that one could achieve a high-quality medicinal pill.

But the chances of Ironwood Ash, Blackheart Seaweed, Earth Qilin, these spirit medicines appearing, was far too low.

Ye Yuan only had one chance. To what degree he could refine the medicinal pill, that would be determined on to what degree he could understand these spirit medicines.

He sliced a very tiny piece from the spirit medicine, and carefully experienced the medicinal theory of these spirit medicines.

This approach was extremely unilateral.

Because each portion of the spirit medicine, the law fragments contained was different. Ye Yuan could only deduce the medicinal properties of the entire spirit medicine through this tiny piece.

Then, he even had to deduce the entire pill refining process according to the pill formula.

This process was complicated to the extreme.

Even with Ye Yuan’s present soul force, he also felt that it was too much for him to bear.

But he had no choice.

Any more and it would affect the refinement of the medicinal pill.

Furthermore, among these spirit medicines, there were half that Ye Yuan had never come into contact with before!

Each kind needed him to go and experience it carefully.
