Chapter 3109: Wills Unite Like a Fortress!

When Mi Tian and the rest heard, their hearts went thump.

The first thing that Heavenless did after leaving seclusion was actually to find Ye Yuan to take revenge!

A hint of smugness flashed across the corners of Yi Xue’s mouth.

With this, it did not need Progenitor to personally take action anymore!

“Old Man Mi Tian, this ancestor is talking to you. Didn’t hear me?” Heavenless said coldly.

Speaking of which, Mi Tian was still his senior.

But his strength had long already surpassed Mi Tian. There was also not the slightest bit of respect in his words.

Mi Tian frowned and said, “Heavenless, Ye Yuan is currently in closed-seclusion, preparing to transcend the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse! Looking at this old man’s face, how about withdrawing for the time being?”

But when Heavenless heard, his brows went up. He closed his eyes, seemingly feeling something carefully.

Suddenly, his eyes snapped open, and he laughed loudly as he said, “Haha, it’s indeed the 33 Tribulations of Apocalypse! However, it’s not strange either. If he doesn’t call down this tribulation, that would be strange! However … Mi Tian, your face isn’t that big! Since this ancestor has corroborated my Dao and returned, I don’t plan on letting him die under the apocalypse tribulations! After this ancestor kills him, it will also be considered carrying out justice on behalf of heaven!”

When everyone from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven heard that, their faces changed. If Heavenless forcibly broke in, they could not stop him at all!

The current Heavenless was seriously too strong!

Meanwhile, Yi Xue and the others had gloating faces. This kind of situation was precisely what they were pleased to see and hear.

However, they were also secretly shocked by Heavenless’ power.

They only barely managed to perceive a trace when Ye Yuan was using the Heaven Trampling Five Steps, but Heavenless could feel it without basis.

Mi Tian drew a deep breath and slowly said, “Since that’s the case, let’s fight then! Want to see Ye Yuan? Sure! But you’ll have to step over our dead bodies!”

Heavenless laughed loudly and said, “Just the likes of you all, these ants, you also want to stop this ancestor? It looks like you all still don’t have a clear understanding of this ancestor’s strength yet!”

Mi Tian said coolly, “So what? Our Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven only has heroic souls that die in battle; there are no cowards who fear death! You’re very strong. This old man is far from being a match. But in this realm, no one fears you! If you don’t believe, you can ask them behind me!”

“Fight to the death without retreating!”

“Fight to the death without retreating!”

“Fight to the death without retreating!”

…..

Behind Mi Tian, the voices of those Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven powerhouses were orderly, shocking the sky.

Everyone had steadfast faces, without any looks of fear at all.

From top to bottom, even if their cultivation realms did not even reach Emperor Realm, they did not shrink back at all either.

Heavenless had a dark expression, feeling like his majesty had been seriously provoked.

He thought that having returned domineeringly, the myriad worlds should be submitting themselves to his rule.

But clearly, he found the wrong target!

“Humph! Old thing who refuses face when it’s given! Since you wholeheartedly seek death, then this ancestor will grant your wish!”

Heavenless flipped his palm. A shocking aura rose up.

In heaven and earth, it was as if everything was within his control.

When everyone saw this scene, they were all incredibly shocked.

It was just like they saw the end of Great Dao.

Yi Xue’s expression was apprehensive as he said, “What a terrifying power! I feel like there’s nothing in this world that can surpass this power anymore! Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is finished!”

Mi Tian had a somber expression. Under this power, he did not even have the strength left to resist.

It was only to see Heavenless press a palm down. Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall was crushed until it deformed!

One had to know that the blood race army bombarded indiscriminately and only barely managed to damage Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall too.

But at this time, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s boundary wall was seemingly about to collapse immediately.

Zhuo Bufan, Yang Qing, and the rest could not even move a muscle under this pressure!

At this moment, they finally understood how strong Heavenless was!

When this palm landed, what it killed would not only be Mi Tian. None of the people present could escape!

Meanwhile, Mi Tian himself directly gave up struggling, closing his eyes and waiting to die.

He knew that under this power, all efforts were futile.

Heavenless smiled coldly and said, “Look closely. This is the outcome of provoking this ancestor! Let all the living things in this world be buried in death for your ignorance!”

With this palm pressing down, it was actually going to slaughter a world!

But right then, inside the world, the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List seemed to have sensed something, suddenly releasing a dazzling light.

When Mi Tian and the others saw the situation, they trembled all over, their eyes revealing the light of hope.

“Is this … a summoning? It’s calling us to protect Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven together?”

Mi Tian sensed that the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List seemed to be beating to some kind of mysterious tempo.

And his heartbeat actually started beating along this rhythm.

He immediately realized that the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List seemed to be calling something.

Hence, his entire person began to enter a mysterious state.

Beat, beat!

Beat, beat!

Mi Tian felt that there were more and more heartbeats sounding out around him.

He and the others were actually connected together under the spurring of the Chaos Heavenly Spirit List.

At this time, everyone from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven actually felt a kind of bloodline connection.

At this moment, regardless of race, regardless of cultivation, everyone seemed to be on the same frequency.

An invisible barrier rose up from the boundary wall, meeting Heavenless’ shocking palm.

Heavenless gave a cold laugh and said, “A bunch of ants; mantis blocking a chariot! Exterminate for me!”

While talking, a palm pressed onto the barrier.

Boom!

The void trembled heavily. That invisible barrier was directly dispersed.

But Heavenless’ figure was actually knocked flying out backward.

Although it was not far, he was indeed knocked back!

Everyone was dumbfounded with shock!

“A-Actually blocked it! This … How is this possible?”

“That’s a palm that controls heaven and earth! It … It was actually blocked?”

“Just what did Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven that group of people do?”

…..

The blood race powerhouses looked at this scene with shocked faces, only feeling incredulity.

It was undeniable that the power that Heavenless displayed was extremely strong. Therefore, they completely never thought that Heavenless would fail.

Let alone would they think that this barrier that appeared from God knows where actually really blocked Ancestor Heavenless! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this time, Mi Tian and the others had fresh blood hanging from the corners of their mouths. The power of this palm was too great!

Although the barrier blocked this blow, their minds were still traumatized.

However, they were incomparably excited.

The invincible Heavenless was actually blocked by them!

“Hahaha, Heavenly Saint Ye is really impressive! The Chaos Heavenly Spirit List has probably already surpassed the domain of chaos heavenly treasure!”

“That’s a powerhouse that surpassed Great Beyond! We … We actually blocked it!”

“Impressive! Really impressive! Our wills unite like a fortress; Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven won’t be finished!”

…..

Ancestor Heavenless’ expression was as ugly as it could get.

He thought that after he attained Dao, he would be able to summon rain and wind, suppressing the myriad worlds!

Now, he actually could not even subdue a measly Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

The big talk that was boasted just now was simply face-slapping!

“What a terrific power of will! This treasure can actually condense the willpower of the people of a world and protect this world! Remarkable! Truly impressive! But it ends here too! Do you all really think that this lousy thing can block this ancestor?”

Suddenly, Ancestor Heavenless raised both palms up. A storm that was even more terrifying than just now directly howled!

The faces of everyone from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven changed!
