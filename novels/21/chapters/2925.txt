Chapter 2924: I Understand!

“Good! Good! Good! This seat indeed didn’t make an error of judgment! Are the two of you convinced this time?”

Great Emperor Eastsun said good three times in a row. His satisfaction with Qin Shitian could be seen.

In the Scarlet Drill Battlefield, Great Emperor Eastsun took fancy on Qin Shitian at a glance and felt very optimistic about him.

Otherwise, he also would not have specially come to watch the temper entrance assessment.

A mere True Sovereign Heaven was not yet worthy of the master of a hall to raise a big rumpus and specially come to watch.

Great Emperor Westdawn and Great Emperor Woodrelease’s faces did not look good.

These three great hall masters were secretly competing when choosing disciples too.

Actually, in the Scarlet Drill Battlefield, Qin Shitian three people’s performances were virtually on par.

But now, the gap was pulled apart all of a sudden.

Zhou Yu and He Chen two people, their performance was actually already very good.

But, compared to Qin Shitian, the difference was too big.

“Congratulations, Hall Master, for finding a fine disciple!” Great Emperor Sevenfeather came forward to congratulate.

“Congratulations, Hall Master! Felicitations, Hall Master!”

“Our Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall finally has a six wroughts powerhouse too! Qin Shitian this boy’s future is limitless!”

... ...

The other Emperor Realms also came forward to give their felicitations one after another.

When Great Emperor Eastsun heard, he was naturally very happy.

Between the soul race’s various major Nirvana Soul Halls, there was naturally competitions with each other too. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Nirvana Soul Hall needed to send geniuses to the clan. This way, what the geniuses obtain in the future would also be enjoyed by the Nirvana Soul Hall.

It was just that Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall rarely had heaven-defying geniuses appear.

Now that they had, Great Emperor Eastsun was naturally very happy.

At this time, Qin Shitian already exited the Soul Controlling Avenue too. Arriving before Great Emperor Eastsun, he knelt and said, “This disciple admits my mistake and asks for punishment from Master. I was just one step away, or else I’d have been able to step into the seventh segment. But unfortunately, it failed just a step short of success!”

He was naturally not here to apologize and ask for punishment. He was posturing and telling everyone that he was just a step away from reaching the seventh segment!

He, Qin Shitian, did not know what was called modesty.

Sure enough, the moment quite a number of people heard it, they wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into, especially Zhou Yu two people.

You’re peak sixth segment, and you’re even apologizing and asking for punishment. Wouldn’t we have to end ourselves?

Great Emperor Eastsun smiled and said, “Get up. You’re already very good! Making it to this step, your six wroughts soul body has already reached grand completion. After tempering in the Soul Refining Furnace, you’ll be able to step into the realm of seven wroughts! In the future, when you enter the clan, it will be when you soar to the heaven in one bound!”

As he said, Great Emperor Eastsun casually waved his hand. A powerful soul force directly fired into Qin Shitian’s soul body.

Qin Shitian’s soul body immediately recovered to its peak state.

Qin Shitian felt an upsurge of emotion from what Great Emperor Eastsun said just now.

Soul clan, that was the holy land in his heart!

“Eh? That Ye Yuan actually entered the third segment!” Right at this time, no idea who said that, shattering this happy atmosphere.

Everyone was stupefied and could not help turning their heads to look. Sure enough, they discovered that Ye Yuan already entered the third segment.

This guy actually passed the test unknowingly?

The moment Qin Shitian saw, he was amused.

“This guy said whatever talk again after passing. In the end, after messing around for half a day, he only barely managed to pass the stage! I really want to see how this punk postures after coming out,” Qin Shitian said smugly.

His result could already press Ye Yuan onto the ground and beat him.

Looking at how each of Ye Yuan’s steps was very difficult, the third segment was already the limit.

The humiliation that you gave to Your Father, Your Father will definitely make you repay it twofold!

At this time, he was already planning how to humiliate Ye Yuan.

“Huhu, why does Brother Qin need to stoop to the level of a piece of trash? You’re the proud son of heaven!”

“Just a clown jumping around, that’s all. He’s not even fit to carry shoes for Brother Qin!”

“Sure enough, he’s a useless trash, struggling so hard to even enter the third segment! Just this bit of ability and he also dares to be arrogant and overestimating himself!”

... ...

With Qin Shitian soaring to the sky in one bound, there were naturally many people who came over to lick his boots.

In the future, everyone would still be a member of the Nirvana Soul Hall. Getting into good terms with this big shot would have many benefits.

Jiang Hao also could not help laughing as he said, “This is the so-called eyesight that you talked about? Good! Indeed good! This kid doesn’t have much strength, but his ability to posture is monstrous! Most likely, even Qin Shitian is greatly inferior when compared to him!”

Yan Jadetrue had a black face and did not know what he should say.

He felt that Ye Yuan should be more than this, but Ye Yuan’s performance was clearly so. He had no way of refuting.

Ye Yuan did not have much self-awareness, he was currently like a fish in the water.

Either way, the Soul Controlling Avenue had no time limit either, he could make use of these divine soul attacks fully to temper his soul body.

Making it through the second stage, Ye Yuan’s soul body already reached middle three wroughts.

Presently in the third segment, the difficulty soared to another level.

The effect of the tempering got even better!

Time slowly trickled by, Ye Yuan seemed to be struggling with every step, but he just did not withdraw.

Qin Shitian was very anxious from waiting. He already mustered up a big retort, just waiting for Ye Yuan to come out.

But Ye Yuan just did not come out.

Ye Yuan’s soul body seemed to be in a precarious situation under the divine soul attacks.

But he just did not dissipate.

Just like that, Ye Yuan approached the fourth segment step by step.

When he stepped into the fourth segment, everyone seemed to swallow a gulp.

How did this kind of weakling enter the fourth segment?

If perseverance had a use, then wouldn’t we have long been tenth segment?

Really seeing ghosts, this guy entered the fourth segment already.

The fourth segment was already a very decent result.

Looking across those who entered Nirvana Soul Hall, powerhouses, who managed to enter the fourth segment, belonged among those with superior aptitude too.

No one expected that Ye Yuan could actually walk until this step too.

“This punk can really hold out! Sure enough, the function of Dao heart is still great! However, it ends here too! The fourth segment’s number and power are double that of the third segment’s. The power is already extremely terrifying! He’ll surely withdraw within ten thousand feet!” Qin Shitian said with certainty.

Many people who made it to the fourth segment nodded their heads one after another.

Many top geniuses all suffered a crushing defeat at the fourth segment.

This round was indeed a watershed.

Wanting to clear it was incredibly difficult.

Apart from Qin Shitian three people, the best result was also merely peak fourth segment.

Very soon, ten thousand feet was reached.

Amidst the swaying in the midst of a raging storm. Ye Yuan crossed ten thousand feet.

Qin Shitian’s expression was very ugly.

Slapped again!

However, he was currently lording it over others. Although everyone found it funny, they did not dare to show it.

He was the disciple that Hall Master regarded extremely highly!

This time, Qin Shitian became wiser. He stopped talking.

But in his heart, he was still sneering endlessly.

This way of perseverance, having his divine soul be destroyed by the divine soul attacks in the end, was the only outcome!

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan arrived at the threshold of the fifth segment.

No idea why, everyone’s hearts leaped to their throats again.

This guy teetered, teetered, and actually surpassed everyone apart from the Scarlet Drill Three Sons in the end!

Inconceivable!

Suddenly, Great Emperor Eastsun’s pupils constricted, and he exclaimed, “Four wroughts! I understand. This boy is using the divine soul attacks to temper his soul body!”
