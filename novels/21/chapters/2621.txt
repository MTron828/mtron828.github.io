Chapter 2627: An Opponent Worthy of Respect!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Dao rule!” Yang Jie’s gaze turned intent and he cried out in surprise.

“This is Alchemy Dao rule! But who brought this down?” Hua Ziyou said with a frown.

At this time, the entire Cloudarch Great Nation was in a stir!

The sky was normal, but the air pressure over Cloudarch Great Nation was low until it was depressing.

Everyone felt as if the sky was pressing down.

People started to realize that the victor of this drawn out pinnacle showdown was finally going to be determined!

It was just that, who on earth brought down this Alchemy Dao rule?

Or maybe, they both attracted it.

On a watchtower in the city, two men were currently watching this alchemy battle from afar.

Noticing the descend of the Dao rule, one of them, a white-robed middle-aged man, had a hint of a smile revealed at the corners of his mouth.

“Looks like the die is cast, our arrangements are no longer necessary! Feibai, looks like your day of becoming famous worldwide will be postponed again.” The white-robed middle-aged man looked at the man with a cold expression beside him as he said smilingly.

The identities of these two men were extraordinary.

The white-robed middle-aged man was the Pill Alliance’s deputy alliance chief, Huangfu Cloudthink.

And the man with a cold expression was the Pill Alliance’s Heavenly Martial Hall’s Hall Master, the number one swordsman, Xiao Feibai!

It was naturally impossible for this alchemy battle that swept throughout the entire Rainclear Continent to not arouse the Pill Alliance’s attention.

In reality, the Pill Alliance’s attention to this alchemy battle exceeded the five great heavenly sects’ imagination!

The Pill Alliance’s deputy alliance chief and number one swordsman turned up in person!

It was just that their whereabouts were very secretive. Plus, no one saw them at all, it was naturally not easy to be exposed.

Furthermore, listening to the meaning in Huangfu Cloudthink’s words, the Pill Alliance even made considerable arrangements targeting this alchemy battle!

Xiao Feibai stood with his hands behind his back and said with a frosty expression, “To this Xiao, becoming famous or not isn’t important! What’s important is pursuing the limit of Sword Dao! I heard that the five great heavenly sects’ sect masters have formidable strength. This Xiao had the intention to fight! But unfortunately, the opportunity has yet to arrive.”

If these words were heard by others, it would definitely set the world on fire.

The meaning in his words was actually to challenge the five great sect masters at the same time!

Such words were seriously too arrogant!

What kind of powerhouses were the five great sect masters?

One could say that similarly heavenly sects, the sect masters of the five great heavenly sects, were much stronger than the likes of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect!

These were ascenders!

Huangfu Cloudthink smiled and said, “Relax, there will be a chance! It’s just that, a shame about Ye Yuan this boy! If he can join my Pill Alliance, it will definitely be like adding wings to a tiger!”

Even someone as cold as Xiao Feibai also nodded in agreement and said, “A grade two heavenly alchemist and even an ascender, being able to force Cang Yongning to such a situation … remarkable!”

His face did not have any expression, but the word remarkable was already sufficient to prove his approval of Ye Yuan.

Cang Yongning’s strength, regardless of whether it was Xiao Feibai or Huangfu Cloudthink, they were well aware of it.

Furthermore, Cang Yongning’s character was level-headed and he was absolutely not a flippant person.

Otherwise, even if he was the holy son, he could not have persevered through three months of alchemy battles too.

Facing Ye Yuan’s entanglement and being able to proceed steadily, without making the slightest mistake for three months, this in itself explained everything!

But it was also precisely because of this that it exhibited Ye Yuan’s amazingness even more!

Just as Cang Yongning said, Ye Yuan was just an ascender, just a grade two heavenly alchemist! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Huangfu Cloudthink smiled and said, “It’s just a pity, he’s destined to be a dead man!”

It was not just the two of them from the Pill Alliance that came in.

They already had more than ten assassins lie in ambush in front of Cloud Leisure Establishment!

If Ye Yuan won, Huangfu Cloudthink would give the order immediately to kill Ye Yuan!

The implications of this battle were too great.

Even the Pill Alliance could not afford to lose too.

If they let the Pill Pavilion rise, it would cause tremendous losses to the Pill Alliance’s interests.

It was impossible for the Pill Alliance to sit by and watch the Pill Pavilion rise up!

… …

Dao rule was invisible. No one knew who caused it the moment it dropped down.

But in the view of the vast majority of the people, this was likely brought down by Holy Son!

Although this alchemy battle was deeply worrying, wanting to reach true grade just based on an alchemy battle, it was a little too ridiculous.

True grade, since it was called a legendary grade, it was naturally difficult to the extreme.

Didn’t you see that even Holy Son was unable to refine it after being disturbed by Ye Yuan for so long?

The appearance of this scene caused many people to sigh.

A rising alchemy overlord actually fell just like that!

Cang Yongning and Ye Yuan had clearly felt the appearance of this Dao rule too.

After three months of fierce fighting, it was finally time to show true ability.

A hint of excitement and smugness flitted across Cang Yongning’s face.

This battle was the most difficult to win since he made his debut!

When the Pill Alliance sent him out, he absolutely never thought that this opponent would actually be so difficult!

In these three months, he did not dare to relax the slightest bit, his entire person forced until he almost went mad.

But he still did not dare to slack off.

This was a test of will, he understood that even if there was any slacking off, the one who dies would be him!

Fortunately, the clouds were dispelled and the bright moon could be seen, the Dao rule finally came!

Cang Yongning knew that this battle was very hard-won, but the benefits obtained were unimaginable too.

This kind of tenacious and formidable opponent could only be encountered with luck but not by searching for it!

He could feel through the aura that even at this moment, when the Dao rule had already descended, Ye Yuan was still completing the refinement fastidiously.

This opponent was worthy of respect!

The Dao rule descended little by little.

People could feel its existence, but could not see it.

But they could feel that the falling speed of the Dao rule was currently getting faster and faster.

The two people’s refinement reached the most critical moment.

“Condense!”

At virtually the same time, the two people yelled out this word.

Then, the Dao rule suddenly accelerated and dove down!

Cang Yongning laughed loudly and said, “Boy, you’re an opponent worthy of respect! To be able to force this holy son to this point, you can be sufficiently proud of yourself! But, you’re destined to become a stepping stone on this holy son’s alchemy path! You can go with peace of mind!”

“Sigh,?three months! To actually lost just like that, really not resigned to it!”

“This Dao rule is indeed brought down by the Pill Alliance’s Holy Son?”

“Us ascenders finally had a chance to rise, but I didn’t expect he is going to be defeated just like that!”

… …

A series of lamenting came from all around.

As ascenders, they naturally hoped for Ye Yuan to win.

It was just that sadly, no!

There was only one Dao rule that fell!

If it was two, Ye Yuan still had hopes of drawing.

The result was already destined.

At this time, the invisible Dao rule rushed faster and faster, falling straight to the mortal world!

Boom!

There was an intense tremor on the ground, everyone was stunned.

Among the dumbfounded people, it naturally included Cang Yongning too.

Because this Dao rule did not fall into his medicine cauldron, but it landed in Ye Yuan’s medicine cauldron!

The whole place was deathly silent!

In the royal palace, the five great sect masters had stupefied faces.

On the watchtower, Huangfu Cloudthink and Xiao Feibai had shocked faces.

Also, the various factions’ big shots all had disbelief written all over their faces too.

Ye Yuan won!

Fighting fiercely for three months, Ye Yuan actually broke the shackles and suppressed the Pill Alliance’s holy son, refining true grade!

Ye Yuan looked at Cang Yongning and said with a slight smile, I’ll return those earlier words to you! You’re indeed an opponent worthy of respect!”
