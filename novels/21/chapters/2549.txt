Chapter 2555: Waiting for Your Apology!

“Xiao Qi pays respect to His Highness, Eldest Prince!”

In the private room of a wine shop, Xiao Qi kowtowed respectfully to Eldest Prince.

Eldest Prince smiled and said, “Get up, you’re my sister-in-law now. You don’t need to be so formal!”

Xiao Qi slowly got up and said respectfully, “Xiao Qi thanks Eldest Prince for taking care of Big Sister!”

Xiao Qi’s elder sister worked as a maid in the royal palace.

But now, she became Eldest Prince’s concubine. This was equivalent to transforming from a swallow into a phoenix.

This favor, Xiao Qi had no choice but to accept it.

Eldest Prince had always wanted to make his way into the Tang Family and spy on the progress of Ye Yuan’s cultivation.

Who would have expected that the Tang Family had long already become a monolithic block? Even if he made his way in, he could not come into contact with Ye Yuan too.

Later, Eldest Prince found another path and actually discovered that Xiao Qi’s elder sister was a palace maid in the palace. Furthermore, her life was not easy.

Hence, he simply married Xiao Qi’s elder sister!

Eldest Prince knew that Xiao Qi was in charge of serving Ye Yuan.

Once this layer of relationship was established, would he still be scared of not knowing Ye Yuan’s movements?

“Xiao Qi, you’re a clever person. You should know what this prince wants! This prince can let your sister live. Of course, I can also make your sister die! Her life and death, it lies with only a thought from you!” Eldest Prince said with a faint smile.

With regards to an ant like Xiao Qi, Eldest Prince could not be bothered to talk rubbish at all.

Threatening was the best weapon!

Xiao Qi’s expression changed slightly, and she said respectfully, “Xiao Qi understands! I wonder what Eldest Prince wants to know?”

Eldest Prince smiled and said, “Three years have already passed since Ye Yuan and Nation Teacher’s wager! I want to know which heavenly medicines has Ye Yuan formulated in these three years?”

Xiao Qi was responsible for allocating the heavenly medicines that Ye Yuan needed.

Therefore, whatever medicinal pills Ye Yuan was refining, one would naturally know through Xiao Qi directly.

Xiao Qi’s gaze flickered and she said, “In the first year or so, Master Ye has basically been refining all Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pills! As for the next two years, he asked for the Dragonscale Flower, Heavenly Star Origin, Purplecloud Drifting Incense …”

With regards to the heavenly medicines that Ye Yuan requested for, Xiao Qi naturally enumerated it like her family’s treasures, listing them one by one.

However, the Xie Hua beside Eldest Prince started frowning.

After Xiao Qi finished speaking, Xiao Qi opened his mouth and said, “Are you sure that he only wanted these heavenly medicines?”

Xiao Qi nodded and said, “How can Xiao Qi dare deceive Eldest Prince and Lord Xie Hua? Actually, not only Your Excellency has this doubt, but the Tang Family is also currently in a state of panic from top to bottom.”

Xie Hua frowned and said, “What the hell is this Ye Yuan selling in his gourd?”

Eldest Prince did not understand alchemy and asked, “Why? Is there something wrong?”

Xie Hua said, “What these heavenly medicines refine are all some basic heavenly pills. In terms of difficulty, they are not much higher than the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill. His Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill has clearly already reached the realm of seventh grade. Yet, he actually still wasted a year’s time on it! At this rate of progress, forget about five years, even if it’s 50 years, it’s also impossible for him to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill!”

When Eldest Prince heard that, he said in surprise, “Is this guy courting death? There are still two years remaining. Can he refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill?”

Xie Hua said, “This is also the thing that I’m most perplexed about! What on earth does this boy want to do?”

Eldest Prince smiled and said, “This is great news to us! Refining a Jasper Regeneration Pill in five years is something impossible in the first place! He only knew how to refine the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill in the past. So he likely doesn’t know how terrifying the Jasper Regeneration Pill is! Now, it’s probably going to be a vicious cycle!”

Xie Hua thought about it and thought in his heart that there was only this possibility.

“You go back then. This king doesn’t need you to do anything either. You just have to report the heavenly medicines that Ye Yuan uses in his cultivation to this prince at all time! Understand?” Eldest Prince said to Xiao Qi.

Xiao Qi replied respectfully and withdrew.

… …

For the next two years, Ye Yuan still did not touch the Jasper Regeneration Pill.

It was as if he had completely forgotten about this!

Initially, Ye Yuan refined another batch of grand completion ninth grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill in an attempt to increase his affinity.

But the effect was not good.

The second heavenly pill, the effect was drastically reduced.

After the fifth Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, there was almost no effect anymore.

In the end, Ye Yuan’s affinity did not reach four points either.

Putting aside the regret, the improvement of these four points to Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength was all-round.

When he practiced other basic heavenly pills, his speed was much faster!

His remaining thought was practically all on studying the basic heavenly pills.

Even if it was a slightly more advanced heavenly pill, he did not dabble in them in the slightest too.

Looking as time drew closer little by little, the Tang Family father and son were anxious like ants on a hot pan.

But they also did not dare to go and disturb Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion.

On this day, the five-year agreement came to an end. Ye Yuan finally came out of closed-seclusion. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Big Brother! Nation Teacher has already set up the venue at Sky Gathering Establishment and sent someone to invite you over!” Tang Yu said anxiously.

Ye Yuan smiled and said,?“Oh,?let’s go then.”

Tang Yu was speechless and said, “I say, Big Brother, you’ve never touched the Jasper Regeneration Pill’s heavenly medicines in these five years! Forget about the Jasper Regeneration Pill; even some of the higher level heavenly pills, you’ve never dabbled in them too! You’re going over just like this now?”

Ye Yuan countered with a question, “Otherwise?”

Tang Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Big Brother, I know that you did it for the Tang Family back then! Why not let’s run away together! Let’s drop the Tang Family’s foundation!”

“Hahaha,?isn’t it too late to only think about running now? Don’t forget, Ye Yuan and Nation Teacher even signed an origin divinity contract!” Eldest Prince strolled over with a burst of roaring laughter.

Eldest Prince arrived in front of Ye Yuan and said smilingly, “Master Ye, this prince came to invite you personally! Today, Royal Father will be there in person to witness your bet! If you win, Royal Father will crown you the position of nation teacher in public! Of course, I don’t think that you have this chance.”

When the Tang Family father and son heard, their faces could not help changing drastically.

This scale was too high!

Once Ye Yuan failed, the Tang Family would be completely finished!

But Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a smile,?“Oh??Why is that?”

Eldest Prince laughed and said, “In these five years, you spent a year to cultivate the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill bitterly, and then you spent another four years to study other basic heavenly pills. You’ve never even touched high level heavenly pills! This prince wants to know, what basis do you have to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill?”

When Tang Yu heard that, his expression could not help changing greatly and he cried out in surprise, “How does Your Highness know so clearly?”

Suddenly, his entire body trembled and he looked towards Xiao Qi and said in a cold voice, “Xiao Qi, my Tang Family treated you well! Why did you betray the Tang Family?!”

Xiao Qi said indifferently, “The Tang Family is already finished! Do you want us, these servants, to all be buried in death?”

Tang Yu roared angrily, “I’ll kill you!”

However, his figure had just moved when a gust of wind came over, directly sending him flying.

One move and Tang Yu was seriously injured!

Huang Zhaoyu, who was behind Eldest Prince, made a move!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and killing intent immediately arose.

Huang Zhaoyu smiled faintly and said, “Young man, don’t need to look at this old man with this sort of eyes! If you succeed today, this old man will naturally pay a visit and apologize! It’s just that you don’t have that chance anymore!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh and said, “Is that so? Then this Ye will wait for your apology!”

Finished speaking, Ye Yuan helped Tang Yu up and brought him along to Sky Gathering Establishment.
