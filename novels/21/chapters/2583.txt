Chapter 2589: Imperial Grade Heavenly Pill!

“Pretending to be mysterious! He must be purposely misleading people by being deliberately mystifying!” Shi Feiyu said in a solemn voice.

“That’s right! It must be deliberately mystifying things! With a four-point affinity, if he can refine this Crimson Cloud Heavenly Pill, then wouldn’t we, these heavenly alchemists, become jokes!” Qin Shun said with a cold smile.

“It looks like that, but inside must already be a pile of paste!” Shi Feiyu said.

These two people chime in one after another, continuously cheering themselves up.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan finished condensing the pill!

Everyone held their breaths, staring fixedly at the medicine cauldron.

Whether it was a mule or a horse, it was time to verify it!

“Open!”

The moment the medicine cauldron opened, a golden light dazzled until people could not open their eyes.

“Ninth grade golden pill!”

“This is impossible! Such an obscure heavenly pill, could it be that he has refined it before in the past?”

“Furthermore, he only has four points of affinity! Four points! This … This is also too fake!”

“Freaking hell, this is also too impressive! Settling the matter in one go, how can Master Qin still compete?”

… …

The audience exploded!

Everyone fell into fervent shock!

They had thought of ten thousand possibilities. The only thing that they never thought of was that it was a ninth grade golden pill the moment Ye Yuan made his move!

Only at this time did they suddenly come to a realization why Ye Yuan dared to ‘spout a stream of empty rhetoric’, saying that Qin Shun did not need to take action anymore!

Freaking hell, how to do it still?

Qin Shun said it before too, he studied this Crimson Cloud Heavenly Pill for decades and only barely refined lower third grade.

Even if he were to refine until he vomited blood, he could not refine ninth grade too!

“Hahaha?… beautiful! The moment Brother Ye takes action, it crushes all sides! With this, everyone has to shut up, right?” Luo Yunqing stroked his palm and laughed loudly as he said.

Even he also did not expect that the moment Ye Yuan made his move, it would actually be so breathtaking, directly settling the matter in one go.

By the side, Sect Master’s eyes were full of shock.

Such a heaven-defying four-point heavenly alchemist, he really only saw it once in his life.

Ye Yuan looked at Qin Shun and said, “Old man, why don’t come down and give it a try too? This is my first time refining. There were still some flaws during the refining process. If you can reach grand completion ninth grade, you can still beat me.”

Qin Shun’s face turned black, wishing to tear Ye Yuan to shreds.

Try your sister!

Already ninth grade, was Your Father going down to make a spectacle of myself?

And at this time, Ye Yuan’s arrogant remarks did not arouse the full audience’s ridicule.

At this moment, all of Ye Yuan’s arrogance became a matter of course.

The strong naturally had the capital to be arrogant!

Did you not see that even Qin Shun shut up?

Wen Jingxuan looked at Ye Yuan, her cherry lips opened until she could not close her mouth.

The fox’s tail was revealed!

But this tail was too big!

She prided herself on being extremely talented and had never placed anyone in the sect in her sights before.

However, a four-point affinity Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum trampled her into the dust with one foot.

Not, it was her and her master together!

Originally, Ye Yuan was just a jumping clown in her eyes!

But now, Ye Yuan’s image became incomparably tall.

As if a lofty mountain, crushing her until she could not breathe.

“Why are you not speaking anymore? No rush. You just underestimated the enemy this time. You still have two chances. Buck up! You can do it!” Ye Yuan looked at Qin Shun and said with a smile.

Qin Shun’s face turned black, this guy was too arrogant!

He gritted his teeth, fished out another jade slip, and said, “This is the pill formula for the Fish Dragon Nine Transformation Heavenly Pill! If you can refine it, this old man will admit defeat immediately!”

Ye Yuan hurriedly said, “Don’t say that. You need to be careful, or you might just slap your own face! Better stick to what we said. Three times!”

Everyone was rendered speechless.

However, Qin Shun taking out the Fish Dragon Nine Transformation Heavenly Pill’s pill formula caused a stir once again.

This pill formula was even more monstrous and freakish than the Crimson Cloud Heavenly Pill. Not only was it extremely obscure, but the refining difficulty was also even greater.

It could be seen that Qin Shun really put forth the blood capital this time.

But unfortunately, Ye Yuan’s refinement went rather smoothly.

Several hours later, the heavenly pill came out of the furnace.

Ninth grade!

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied!

If Ye Yuan happened to have refined the Crimson Cloud Heavenly Pill previously before,

Then what was going on with this Fish Dragon Nine Transformation Heavenly Pill?

Such an obscure heavenly pill, forget about in the Five Light Heavenly Region, even in the four great heavenly regions, there were extremely few people who grasped it too.

But Ye Yuan seemed to have refined it countless times before. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The moment he made a move, it was ninth grade!

Ye Yuan looked at Qin Shun and said with a smile, “Already said it. Don’t be so sure. It’s easy to get slapped!”

Qin Shun’s face became as black as the bottom of a pot.

He said in a great rage, “This old man doesn’t believe that you can refine this!”

Finished talking, he took out another jade slip and threw it right at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s divine sense swept and his eyes could not help lighting up.

This pill formula was pretty good!

He did not say another word either, immediately started deducing.

The others had curious looks too, not knowing what pill formula Qin Shun took out this time.

But they knew that it must be Qin Shun’s ultimate pill formula this time!

Several hours later, the furnace was opened.

Still ninth grade!

“That … That’s the legendary Yu Qi Dust Cleansing Heavenly Imperial Pill! Imperial grade heavenly pill! N-Ninth grade imperial grade heavenly pill!”

Wu Chengchao suddenly stood up, looking at that medicinal pill with an astonished face; incredibly shocked!

He had always harbored the mentality of watching Qin Shun make a fool of himself. But this time, he could not sit still anymore.

Ye Yuan refining an imperial grade heavenly pill to ninth grade directly made him explode!

Imperial grade heavenly pill was the highest grade among heavenly pills!

Each grade had a top-notch kind of heavenly pill, that was the imperial grade heavenly pill!

Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums were unable to withstand the medicinal properties of grade two heavenly pills at all.

Once consumed, they might very likely be blown up by the grade two heavenly pill’s medicinal properties.

However, imperial grade heavenly pills would not!

The medicinal properties of grade one imperial grade heavenly pills did not lose to grade two heavenly pills!

But its medicinal properties were very gentle, Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums could consume them too.

But imperial grade heavenly pills had the most terrifying aspect. It was that the refining difficulty was exceedingly high!

Whatever Jasper Regeneration Pill, whatever Fish Dragon Nine Transformation Heavenly Pill, all were weak to the max in front of an imperial grade heavenly pill!

Therefore, to the vast majority of heavenly alchemists, imperial grade heavenly pills were just a legend.

Because even if they obtained the pill formula, they could not refine it at all too!

But Ye Yuan refined it!

Not only did he refine it, furthermore … it was ninth grade golden pill!

Ninth grade imperial grade heavenly pill!

“Sect Master, I wonder if this Brother Ye of mine can take on the position of a green-wing protector?” Luo Yunqing said with a light smile.

He was similarly extremely shocked in his heart.

But at this time, he actually had a feeling of exaltation upon fulfillment.

Ye Yuan’s breathtakingly explosive performance proved that his eyesight was correct!

Honestly speaking, he also did not expect that Ye Yuan could actually be fearsome to such an extent.

That was an imperial grade pill!

Furthermore, it was a ninth grade heavenly imperial pill!

Sect Master’s entire body trembled and he nodded his head deeply and said, “Yes! Of course, he is worthy of it! No, becoming a green-wing protector isn’t enough!”

Luo Yunqing smiled lightly and said, “Actually, when I went to guide him back then, I wanted to give him the authority of a purple-wing protector. But unfortunately, my greatest authority was also just giving him the status of a green-wing protector. Brother Ye has a lofty heart and must be treated with sincerity! Otherwise, he could not care even if given the position of elder. For this reason, I laid low in Eastward Country for as long as a decade!”

Sect Master slowly said, “Yunqing, you did very well! This matter, you’ve made great contributions to the sect! It’s just that I can’t give him this green-wing protector!”
