Chapter 1298: A Man Without Money Is No Man at All

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hey, don’t be happy too early! The World Suppressing Stele can only activate the first layer space right now. The time ratio is only one-to-ten. Your talent is indeed pretty good, but the Heavenspan World’s talents are way stronger! Immortal Grove was one of them! Even for him, reaching this step took a thousand years too! Even if your talent is greater than his, 800 years is already the limit too. Which is also to say that you only have 80 year’s time. These 80 years, you still have to divert attention and learn Formation Dao. 10 years, it’s absolutely impossible for you to succeed!” Dustless struck down without showing the slightest bit of mercy.

In this world, how many dared to say that their talent was even greater than Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove?

That was an existence closest to Heavenly Emperor!

While Ye Yuan was just a native of the Immortal Grove World, with innate deficiencies.

Wanting to surpass Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, that was nigh impossible.

Dustless’ estimations were already regarding Ye Yuan infinitely highly!

80 years was the limit that Ye Yuan could reach already.

This was already an achievement that surpassed Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove.

But Ye Yuan could not wait 80 years. He only had 10 years’ time!

And within 10 years, it was absolutely impossible for Ye Yuan to succeed!

However, Ye Yuan completely did not have the look of being beaten down on his face. He smiled and said, “Not trying, how would you know?”

To Ye Yuan, the most frightening was not difficulties but having completely no way.

As long as there was a way, he could face the difficulties and advance!

Wasn’t this road crossed this way?

Even the Deity Realm, which no one had achieved in 100 thousand years, he succeeded too!

Nothing in the world was difficult for one who set his mind to it!

If Ye Yuan was scared from beginning to end, it would also be impossible to trigger Heavenly Dao and become the controller.

Talent was one aspect, but determination and hard work were just as important!

Dustless did not think that Ye Yuan was actually not the least bit dispirited.

On the contrary, the current Ye Yuan’s gaze was sharp, filled with fighting intent from head to toe.

Dustless discovered that his understanding of Ye Yuan seemed to be too little.

If Long Teng was here, he absolutely would not say this kind of words.

Dustless let out a sigh and said, “Fine then. At this point presently, it seems like there’s no other way as well.”

Although he said so, Dustless did not harbor much hope in Ye Yuan.

Reaching initial-rank One Star Alchemy God within 10 years, this was indeed pushing people a little too much beyond their power.

“But, the first difficulty put in front of you right now isn’t Alchemy Dao and Formation Dao, but ... divine essence stones,” Dustless continued.

Ye Yuan froze, also discovering the severity of the problem.

He had Dustless mentioned that the Heavenspan World’s universal currency was divine essence stones.

Furthermore, divine essence stones were not that anybody could have. On mortals, under ordinary circumstances, it was impossible to have divine essence stones.

Martial artists cultivating, deducing Formation Dao, all could not dispense with divine essence stones.

But now, Ye Yuan was penniless. Even if he wanted to cultivate Formation Dao, there was also no way to start practicing.

When at the Immortal Grove World, Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao reached the acme of perfection. Casually refining a few medicinal pills could exchange for money.

Therefore, he had never worried about money before.

But now, he could only even refine the most basic Tier 1 divine pill, use what to exchange for money?

Don’t count on the Liang Family, it was already pretty good that Liang Mingyu did not drive him out.

Ye Yuan suddenly discovered that it was truly a penny stumping a hero!

“This ... This is really a problem!” Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile.

“En?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed. A knocking sound suddenly sounded out outside the door.

Opening the door to take a look, it was an unfamiliar little girl. Looking at the appearance, it should be a maidservant.

That maidservant was also sizing Ye Yuan up and said doubtfully, “You’re Ye Yuan?”

When Ye Yuan heard this tone, it seemed like the arrival was somewhat unfriendly.

“It’s precisely this Ye, may I ask for Miss’s name?”

“I’m called Lan Qing, Miss Wanru’s personal maidservant.”

Ye Yuan brows raised and he said, “So, it’s Miss Lan Qing. Is Miss Wanru well?”

Lan Qing looked at Ye Yuan and rolled her eyes as she said, “Well my *ss! Miss has been grounded!”

Ye Yuan frowned and asked, “What’s going on here?”

“What’s going on? You still have the cheek to ask! It’s all because of you that Miss was grounded by that shrew! Furthermore, she even docked her three years of divine essence stones!” Talking to the back, Lan Qing suppressed her voice and said.

That shrew was an existence which she could not provoke.

If it was heard by someone, she was dead for sure.

Ye Yuan reckoned that the Liang Family probably did this in order to stop him from meeting her, that was why it was like this.

He only came to the Liang Family in order to protect Liang Wanru. But he suddenly discovered that he seemed to be a little too weak and could not help at all.

Musing for a moment, Ye Yuan opened his mouth again and said: “Could it be that Miss Lan Qing came to find this Ye in order to denounce me for my crimes?”

Lan Qing had already long seen through that Ye Yuan was merely a good-for-nothing who could not cultivate. She did not understand why Miss was so worried about him.

She snorted coldly and unwillingly threw Ye Yuan a storage ring, finally muttering to herself, “I really don’t know what Miss thinks, clearly a cripple.”

As she said, she turned right around and left, and could not be bothered to even give Ye Yuan another look.

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not mind.

He could tell that this Lan Qing was standing up for Liang Wanru, feeling indignant on her behalf.

Furthermore, she did not say wrongly either, wasn’t the current him a cripple?

The storage ring was an owner-less item. Ye Yuan sunk his divine sense inside and discovered that inside the storage ring, there were a hundred milky-white stones.

“This lass is really delivering charcoal in the snow, to actually send you divine essence stone!” Dustless said in surprise.

Ye Yuan was stunned and said in surprise, “These are divine essence stone? Such thick spiritual energy!”

Ye Yuan had never seen before divine essence stones. Only when he heard Dustless’ gasp, did he know that these milky-white stones were divine essence stones.

Divine essence stones were completely different from essence crystals. When martial artists absorbed the energy inside, they could directly convert it into divine essence. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Deity Realm martial artists’ cultivation could not get away from divine essence stones.

The Heavenspan World’s heaven and earth essence energy was not called essence energy but called spiritual energy.

The energy concentration of spiritual energy was more than goodness knows how many times higher than essence energy, completely another level of energy.

And divine essence stones would only be produced in regions with an extremely high concentration of spiritual energy.

“Unfortunately, these are merely low-grade divine essence stones. Furthermore, the quantity is too little, completely not enough for you to cultivate,” Dustless said.

But Ye Yuan said rather happily, “Having is better than nothing! Senior, this matter brooks no delay, where do we start from?”

Dustless also knew that time was pressing and did not hesitate at once, saying, “Start from the Divine Essence Pill then, this is the most basic divine pill already! Extract and refine the divine essence inside spirit medicines, condensing to form a pill, and providing for martial artists to cultivate. This is the pill formula, you go and buy some spirit medicines back first.”

Ye Yuan had an additional pill formula in his mind. The spirit medicines that this pill formula needed were not many, looking very simple.

Ye Yuan knew that this Divine Essence Pill should be similar to mortal-grade medicinal pills, the likes of the Essence Gathering Pill and Explosive Yuan Pill.

Of course, this was completely the medicinal pills of two worlds.

Ye Yuan already made up his mind to definitely comprehend the Divine Essence Pill within the shortest time.

As long as he could refine the Divine Essence Pill, he would be able to rely on selling medicinal pills for a living.
