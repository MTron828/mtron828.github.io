Chapter 2807: Great Battle Begins!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Dao Chen came over, swept a glance over Ye Yuan, and said disdainfully, “You’re that kid who called down heavenly punishment? Hulu, a trash who was spurned by Heavenly Dao also wants to talk big to impress people? Your meaning is that my Extreme Medicine Sect is setting everyone up? What

malicious motives!”

Ye Yuan sized Dao Chen up with a glance and could not help being speechless.

He did not expect that he would make contact with the Extreme Medicine Sect so quickly!

He knew that Li Changsheng was a member of the Extreme Medicine Sect.

Of course, to a Hegemon level holy land, a Saint Sovereign Heaven disciple was simply unimportant.

“A countryside bumpkin also dares to question a Hegemon level holy land, really ignorant!”

“Huhu, this kid really takes himself to be the savior. How laughable!”

“The Extreme Medicine Sect roams Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven unobstructed. It’s the number one alchemy path sect. This kid really ate the wrong medicine, to actually dare question them.”

The mocking voices lingered on incessantly. To these people, the Extreme Medicine Sect was the absolute authority and could not be questioned.

Both parties’ statuses were totally not equal.

Even Song Miao was also very disapproving of Ye Yuan’s questioning.

It was true that you, Ye Yuan, rendered great contributions. But, this was not your confidence to question authority.

“Senior Song doesn’t believe me too?” Ye Yuan looked towards Song Miao and said.

Song Miao smiled and said, “Young Friend Ye has just arrived. You might not know the Extreme Medicine Sect’s strength. The suppression method that they devised shouldn’t have a problem!”

Dao Chen laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Heard that, kid? In Heaven One Continent, my Extreme Medicine Sect is the absolute authority in alchemy! Questioning us? Ignorant!”

“Bullshit! If Master Ye says that there’s a problem, then there’s definitely a problem! You these people can’t tell good from bad and still speak sarcastically to Master Ye, what a bunch of fools!”

Before Ye Yuan said anything, he heard Big Yellow’s furious voice come over.

He heard that Ye Yuan woke up and immediately came over to find him, and just happened to hear these people making digs at Ye Yuan, and immediately could not continue listening anymore.

In his heart, Ye Yuan was an omnipotent god.

Especially in the alchemy path, it was even more so.

Other people might think that Ye Yuan’s martial arts were extremely strong and that his Alchemy Dao was merely thus.

But Big Yellow knew what Ye Yuan was truly incredible in. It was Alchemy Dao!

“That’s right! My Big Brother Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength absolutely crushes your Extreme Medicine Sect!” Jingfei also said.

The moment Dao Chen heard, he could not help sneering as he said, “A bunch of frogs at the bottom of a well, ignorant!”

Big Yellow still wanted to say something, but Ye Yuan interrupted him with a hand gesture and said, “Alright, no need to say anymore. Let’s go.”

As he said, he brought the two and left.

Looking at the few people’s back views, Dao Chen was pleased with himself as he said, “Just this bit of capability and he also dares to step into the limelight and talk big to impress people! Being exposed by me, he ran away in disgrace! City Lord Song, these few punks hunger for fame and reputation, I’m

afraid that they harbor ulterior motives!”

Song Miao frowned slightly and did not speak.

No matter what, Ye Yuan rendering outstanding contributions was an undeniable fact. But regarding Ye Yuan’s ‘posturing’ personality, he disliked it.

“Dao Chen said.

“Huhu, ignore this kind of fools! The powerhouses from all sides have already arrived one after another. They will be able to launch a general offensive on the spatial passageway! This matter is the most important thin;

To a proud son of heaven like Dao Chen, Ye Yuan, this kind of existence, was simply insignificant.

At present, the general offensive on the blood race’s spatial passageway was the most important.

Saint Sovereign nodded and said, “Younger Brother Dao Chen, rest assured. The northern front has dispatched an army of 50 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens this time. The blood race absolutely won’t gain any advantage!”

“Master Ye, these bunch of guys really don’t know what’s good for them! Could it be that you’re letting it go just like that?” Big Yellow said indignantly.

He currently had a feeling like his good intentions were fed to a dog.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “To them, we’re outsiders. Heaven One Continent is one of the main continents. The Extreme Medicine Sect is even a Hegemon level holy land. To them, we’re merely ants! If not because of the war with the blood race, we probably can’t enter their sights at all. Even now, the words

that I said have encroached on the authority of the Extreme Medicine Sect too. It’s naturally not tolerated by them.”

Ye Yuan’s heart was like a clear mirror. He was aware of what Dao Chen they all were thinking in their hearts.

He knew that he could not convince these people at all, so he could not be bothered to argue.

Only by suffering a big loss would they know how severe the consequences were.

“Hehe, they are going to have a great battle with the blood race tomorrow. At that time, they will suffer a loss!” Jingfei said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “There’s going to be a great battle tomorrow?”

Big Yellow nodded and said, “Heaven One Continent this side has already accumulated an army of 50 thousand Saint Sovereign Heavens. They will be attacking the spatial passageway tomorrow.”

Ye Yuan had just woken up and did not expect that there was going to be a big battle tomorrow.

He said in a solemn voice, “From a certain degree, this battle is even more tragic than the southern front. Tomorrow’s great battle will probably be extremely fierce. The Extreme Medicine Sect’s method is indeed able to suppress the blood race’s blood energy from corrupting. But this method can only

treat the symptoms and can’t treat the root cause. Under such circumstances, it’s very easy for the Extreme Medicine Sect’s method to cause a large-scale collapse!”

‘When putting it like this, the few people’s expressions became ugly too.

They wanted to see Dao Chen and the other get deflated, but if the blood race gained a firm foothold at the northern front, then the consequences would be too severe. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“But they didn’t take Master Ye’s suggestion in at all. What can we do?” Big Yellow said unhappily.

After a moment of silence, Ye Yuan said, “There’s only one night. I hope that I can make it in time!”

The next day, 50 thousand troops were gathered on the coastline, majestic and mighty.

The commander-in-chief of the army was a half-step Emperor Cloud Heaven powerhouse, You Ming.

The war with the blood race was divided into three levels.

The first level was the showdown of Hegemon Realm powerhouses.

Regarding this level of powerhouses, the moment they took action, the sky would rent asunder, and the earth would split apart.

The second level was the showdown of Emperor Realm powerhouses.

This level of showdown similarly caused a huge commotion.

However, the battles of these two levels were few in numbers but large in scale. The casualties were not high instead.

But, the third level, the battles below Emperor Realm, was the most tragic.

Soldiers against soldiers; generals against generals.

Saint Sovereign Heaven and True Sovereign Heaven this level of battle, they would often kill down to the last soldier.

And this battle for the spatial passageway was clearly a fight to the death; neither could back down.

“Brothers, this battle concems the life and death of all races on Heaven One Continent! Once the spatial channel stabilizes, it will be our doomsday! Therefore, only victor is allowed for this battle. Defeat is not allowed! Are you all ready?” You Ming said in a loud voice.

“To live and die together with Heaven One Continent!”

“To live and die together with Heaven One Continent!”

“To live and die together with Heaven One Continent!”

The battle cries shook the heaven!

“Set off!”

Under You Ming’s word of comman4, the 50 thousand strong army set off!

Above the sea, a black hole-like spatial passageway was currently giving off light.

The army of 20 thousand bloodkins was waiting in full battle-array before the spatial passageway.

This was a frontal confrontation without the slightest strategy.

The two armies clashed head-on together just like that!

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

The two armies met in close quarters!
