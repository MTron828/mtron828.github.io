Chapter 1620 Not This Price

the moment these words came out, the scene became quiet.

but very soon, someone came forward to concur.

“yeah! we’re all giving river eternal imperial city a helping hand. what right does he have to not bring us down?”

“we’re fighting for the human race right now. if he doesn’t bring us, that’s rising universal condemnation!”

“the fiend race is glaring like a ravening tiger, every additional person we have, it’s an additional portion of strength! if he doesn’t bring everybody down because of a little selfish motive, that’s too beneath contempt!”

...

these people suddenly discovered that gao yuan fought for an excellent reason for them.

hence, they started agreeing one by one.

at this time, each and every one of them was righteous and awe-inspiring, as if they incarnated to become the messengers of justice, seemingly all becoming the heroes of the human race.

they all believed that under this kind of pressure, forget about ye yuan, even heavenly eagle imperial city would also put pressure on ye yuan and force him to give in.

no imperial city dared to shoulder such a crime.

sure enough, zheng qi’s face changed several times. he opened his mouth, but he did not know how to start talking.

rather, there was an elder who could not hold back and said, “elder ye, why not ... just bring them along! this ... this isn’t a joke.”

“yeah, elder ye, this crime, our heavenly eagle imperial city can’t bear it!”

gao yuan watched his scene, sneering in his heart to no end.

make him come and beg ye yuan?

no chance!

he was secretly pleased with himself in his heart. i only used a slight trick. at the end, wouldn’t you still have to submit obediently?

ye yuan remained silent the whole time, quietly watching these people perform.

they all seemed to be here to help river eternal imperial city resist the fiend race, but actually, they were all here to fish in muddy waters.

this point, ye yuan was well aware long ago.

these people were in a state of disunity, they were not as united as the fiend race at all.

really encountering the fiend race, they might do something.

after a while, when the surrounding voices gradually became quieter, only then ye yuan took his time to say, “all done posturing?”

everyone’s faces became stifled when they heard this. then they heard ye yuan slowly say, “mn ... looks like you’re done posturing. then let me say a few words. firstly, don’t take the human race’s righteous cause to come and pressure this little lord. the things that this little lord has done for the human race, you all can’t even catch up by whipping your horses. secondly, don’t hope to use heavenly eagle imperial city to come and pressure me. my temper isn’t too good. if really push me into a corner, i’ll withdraw from heavenly eagle imperial city right now. none of you can think about going down!”

gao yuan smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “without the protection of heavenly eagle imperial city, do you think that you can walk out of here?”

ye yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “old thing, this little lord, i, am not bringing your people down today. come bite me if you have the capabilities!”

gao yuan’s face fell and he said, “kid, you really take it as this old man doesn’t dare to touch you?”

ye yuan did not have the slightest fear and said hatefully, “you feel free to come and give it a try!”

ling zikun saw that the situation was not good and hurriedly became a mediator.

if really fell out, the one suffering a loss would still be them, river eternal imperial city.

“goodness me, for everybody to be able to come to fiend calling ridge, it’s giving my river eternal imperial city face. brother gao yuan, younger brother ye, let’s all simmer down first, alright?” ling zikun said.

ye yuan did not care about him either and continued, saying, “thirdly, this little lord, i, can be persuaded by reason, but not cowed by force! just now, those who use whatever human race’s righteous cause to come and pressure me, each and every one of you, i’ve remembered it! if you guys want to go down, can. each person, one billion divine essence stones! not a single one less! don’t tell me that you all can’t take it out, and also don’t think about bargaining, this little lord isn’t a three-year-old kid. the rest, i can bring you guys down for free.”

those people who concurred with gao yuan earlier immediately felt as uncomfortable as having eaten a fly.

the price of one sentence of one billion divine essence stones!

however, gao yuan, ling zikun, zheng qi, and the likes, were all incomparably shocked in their hearts.

they were all high-ranking figures who wield authority, they were the most proficient in this kind of stratagem.

they never expected that ye yuan actually resolved all of the previous awkwardness with a beautiful tai chi push.

he threw his temper, and also brought the people away, and even made a big killing.

this ... was simply mind-blowing!

want to go?

can, but pay up!

actually, the people who concurred with gao yuan just now were mostly those middle-stage divine lord realm powerhouses.

their strengths were inadequate to go down, but they also wanted face, and also wanted to curry favor with gao yuan, this half-step celestial deity powerhouse. that was why they would say those kinds of words.

while those slightly weaker initial-stage divine lord realm martial artists mostly did not make a sound.

even though ye yuan’s strength was weak, he was a true-blue elder.

with their status, they could not afford to offend at all. they naturally did not dare to speak out.

at this time, each and every one of them rejoiced greatly. luckily, they did not throw a rock down the well just now. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

you stepped on me and still wanted to make me bring you down?

how could ye yuan let them do as they wished?

not dying, i also have to make you lose a layer of skin!

ye yuan uttering one billion this number, naturally he had a score in his heart.

these middle-stage divine lord realm powerhouses, most were some imperial city’s major families’ powerhouses, their status extraordinary. they were naturally much wealthier compared to those itinerant cultivators.

one billion this sum, they could definitely take it out. but it would absolutely make them lose a layer of skin.

“why? nobody wants to go down? head elder ling, not that i’m not giving face, it’s that they themselves don’t want to go down! those who didn’t posture earlier, all stand on this side. i’ll bring you all down right away,” ye yuan said coolly.

the moment his voice faded, a large group of people rushed over to this side, for fear of falling behind.

before long, close to a hundred people stood behind ye yuan.

the ones who spoke up to squeeze ye yuan were just the minority after all.

at this time, they stood in the wind like lone flowers swaying; lonely to the extreme.

while talking, a burst of spatial laws surged. ye yuan was really going to directly bring these people down.

how could those people still carry on waiting? they immediately loosened up.

“elder ye, one billion, i pay! just now ... i’ve offended you just now. i’m truly sorry about it.”

a sixth-layered heaven divine lord powerhouse ran over in a hurry and stuffed the storage ring holding divine essence stones into ye yuan’s hand.

ye yuan weighed the storage ring and said with a smile, “mn, everything can be arranged if there’s money. go to that side then. one billion divine essence stones to buy a lucky chance, you don’t lose out! huhu.”

that person was akin to being granted amnesty, hurriedly standing behind ye yuan.

with someone taking the lead, how could the others still endure it? all handed divine essence stones onto ye yuan’s hands in great haste, afraid of ye yuan going back on his words.

zheng qi was long already dumbfounded at ye yuan’s side.

in this short while, ye yuan already collected over ten billion divine essence stones!

this ... this was simply opening a divine essence stone mine!

was earning money so easy?

different from zheng qi, gao yuan’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

“h-head elder, what should we do?” gao yuan’s subordinates asked weakly.

clearly, they were anxious too.

gao yuan’s expression flickered incessantly. ye yuan’s move really checkmated him, embarrassing him to the extreme.

now, their utmost peace imperial city was already being isolated.

gao yuan gritted his teeth and said, “go!”

utmost peace imperial city’s powerhouses were akin to being granted amnesty, heading over to ye yuan’s side one after another, wanting to pay divine essence stones.

however, ye yuan did not receive it and said coolly to gao yuan, “old man gao, if your men want to go down, can as well. but ... it’s not this price!”
