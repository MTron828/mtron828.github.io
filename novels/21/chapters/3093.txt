Chapter 3092: Gaining Enlightenment on Dao With Battle!

“There are still 16 moves. Execute them, and I’ll receive them all!” Ye Yuan looked at Chi Shang and said coolly.

Chi Shang’s expression turned slightly dark. At this time, he could no longer care about face.

“Attack together! This boy is likely trying to gain enlightenment on Dao with battle, can’t let him succeed! Kill him!” Chi Shang said in a solemn voice.

You Lei and Meng Jin’s hearts turned cold. How could they still dare to be neglectful?

Ye Yuan’s monstrousness far exceeded their expectations.

Everyone said that reputation was not as good as meeting in the flesh. At this time, they finally understood why Progenitor and Lord Yi Xue would regard an Emperor Sakra Heaven so highly.

In fact, in order to deal with him, they did not scant to consume a Blood Ward Bead!

One had to know that the Blood Ward Bead was extremely valuable to Progenitor.

Cultivating the supreme Great Dao with the blood from all the heavens was the function of the Blood Ward Bead.

Each Blood Ward Bead could only be cultivated with the fresh blood of hundreds of millions of living things.

When they learned that they had to use the Bloodcloud Grand Array against Ye Yuan, they all felt that it was using a cannon to kill a mosquito; a waste of talent on trivial tasks.

But only now did they deeply realize that it was not overboard at all!

“No wonder Yi Xue would send you here. You’re a clever man! That’s right. I’m indeed thinking of gaining enlightenment on Dao with battle. It will have to depend on whether you kill me first or whether I gain enlightenment on Dao first!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Right now, it was a little too taxing for Ye Yuan to face off against Chi Shang, let alone to deal with three great Hegemons.

Therefore, this was a path of no return.

Either you die or I perish!

At this time, Chi Shang three people no longer held anything back.

The three people formed a triangle, surrounding Ye Yuan in the middle.

The moment they made their move, the commotion was shocking.

“Nine Consecutive Kills!”

“Heaven Splitting Axe!”

“Dark Night Blood Explosion!”

With Chi Shang three people joining forces, that power was shocking to the extreme.

Ye Yuan’s expression was solemn, urging saint force to the extreme, pouring it into the Myriad Realms Mountain.

“Array formation, Universe!”

The Myriad Realms Mountain turned into seven small mountains again, forming the Universe array formation, clashing together with the three.

With each blow, Ye Yuan had to suffer a tremendous impact, his entire person feeling like his frame was being knocked apart.

The Myriad Realms Mountain separating, it was naturally not as powerful as combining into one.

But, facing three great Hegemons, he could only do so too.

Not only were Chi Shang three people powerful, but their attacks were also even enhanced by the origin of blood in the Bloodcloud Grand Array!

The three people combining powers, the offensive power was too terrifying.

Ye Yuan was struggling bitterly under these three people’s bombardment.

Chi Shang was shocked in his heart. Ye Yuan was able to withstand it!

If it were him, he could not have withstood it long ago.

“This boy almost can’t make it anymore. Double up! 15th move, True Sun Blood!”

It was only to see Chi Shang unleashed a sword, the long sword turning into a blood-colored setting sun as if it was going to swallow everything up.

This move smashed onto the Universe Array formation brutally.

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s mind shook heavily, fresh blood vomiting wildly out of his mouth, his innards virtually shattered.

Chi Shang’s Blood Drawing Sword Technique had already been executed until the 15th move. The power was despairingly strong.

This sword technique indeed had great power, but the further in, the pressure on him was enormous too. It could be said to be harming people and himself.

Therefore, the 15th move was already his limit.

Continue executing it and he was going to hurt himself.

Chi Shang also did not expect that a puny little Emperor Sakra Heaven could actually force him to such an extent.

However, only when he saw that Ye Yuan’s aura was getting weaker and weaker did he feel slightly more at ease.

Inside the Bloodcloud Grand Array, only a series of indiscriminate bombarding sounds could be heard.

Ye Yuan was seriously wounded. If it were someone else, they would have long already collapsed.

Gaining enlightenment at this kind of despairing moment, no one could do it at all.

But at this time, Ye Yuan was frighteningly calm.

Under the fierce fighting, he could feel the undulation of the Bloodcloud Grand Array even more distinctly!

This was the strongest origin of blood in this world!

Within Ye Yuan’s body, four kinds of true spirit bloodlines were being controlled by his origin of blood and operating in a special way.

The four great true spirit bloodlines seemed to have a resonance.

Although Ye Yuan had intercepted the Chaos Bloodstone’s origin of blood, his understanding of the origin of blood was already completely different.

The Chaos Bloodstone’s origin of blood was very tyrannical and evil, and it pursued the limits of power.

But Ye Yuan had tread out his own Dao after assimilating the origin of blood.

And at this time, Ye Yuan corroborated his own Dao with the Bloodcloud Grand Array one by one, learned from others’ strong points while overcoming the weak points, and gradually had a new comprehension.

“Blood, the feeling that it gives people is always ominous.”

“Blood, it represents getting injured, represents death.”

“But it represents flesh and blood living things! In this world, all living things with flesh would have blood! It is a part of life! Furthermore, it’s a very important part!”

“The Chaos Bloodstone drew the purest power of flesh and blood living beings in all the heavens to strengthen himself, and let himself transcend the Great Beyond. But he can’t represent the origin of blood!”

“Chaos, origin of blood, bloodline power! What lets bloodline return to the earliest phase is chaos!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes grew brighter and brighter. The bloodline power in his body was already boiling over.

The four great true spirit bloodlines had always been operating within his body but had clear distinctions from each other.

Four kinds of bloodline power, they were equally powerful but incompatible like water and fire.

But at this time, they actually showed signs of fusion!

With this fusion, the strength within Ye Yuan’s body seemed to have exploded!

Boom!

A terrifying power erupted from his bloodline.

“Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Behind Ye Yuan, the four symbols phantoms emitted shocking furious roars at the same time, and the overwhelming auras actually started to skyrocket!

And their bodies also became more solid. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

At this time, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, these four phantoms, seemingly became four genuine chaos true spirits!

Seeing this shocking transformation, Chi Shang’s expression changed drastically, and he cried out in alarm, “This … This is chaos grade true spirit bloodline! How is this possible? How can a mortal body possibly change qualitatively into an innate chaos true spirit bloodline?”

You lei was similarly incomparably shocked as he said, “Innate chaos true spirits, there were a total of five that were born in this world! Three of them died in Progenitor’s hands! It’s simply impossible for chaos grade bloodline to change qualitatively post-natal! How did he do it?”

After the shock, Chi Shang felt his scalp tingle, and he bellowed, “Quick! Use your trump cards! We can’t let him succeed in transforming!”

Chi Shang did not dare to imagine how terrifying a power would be produced if four great chaos true spirit bloodlines gathered in one body at the same time.

Therefore, he did not dare to wait anymore!

Even if he injured himself and his strength declined greatly, he had to risk it all too!

Only to see bloody light on his body surging to the sky, the blood sword in his hand becoming incomparably scarlet, looking unbelievably sinister!

And Chi Shang’s aura actually suddenly broke through the limits, becoming incomparably close to Peak Hegemon!

The current Chi Shang was akin to a fiendgod!

“18th move, Wrath of the Blood God!”

On the other side, You Lei and Meng Jin’s expressions similarly changed wildly. At this moment, they no longer held anything back and used their strongest blow.

After executing this kind of trump card ultimate technique, it would either be a huge drain, leaving them powerless to fight anymore, or it would harm themselves, making it very difficult to recover.

Chi Shang’s Wrath of the Blood God belonged to the latter, while You Lei and Meng Jin’s moves belonged to the former.

But without a doubt, after they used it at this time, even heaven and earth trembled because of it!

Three terrifying to the extreme attacks arrived in an instant, converging at where Ye Yuan was standing.
