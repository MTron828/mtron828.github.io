Chapter 2332: Ancestor of Alchemy Dao!

“Ancestor Ye started the paradigm of Alchemy Dao, and is a man of great talent and virtue through the ages! Today, he shall be conferred the status of an ancestor!”

“Today, spreading Dao and blessing all ages! If Ye Yuan isn’t conferred the status of an ancestor, heaven will not tolerate it!”

... ...

Regarding Ye Yuan being an ancestor, no one had objections.

Perhaps those people with meager strength did not understand the meaning of this spreading of Dao. But they all, these progenitors, were deeply aware of its profound impact.

Prior to this, regardless of whether it was the human race’s or demon race’s Alchemy Dao, it was all scattered and disorderly.

One could say that it was an act of hit-or-miss.

You comprehend your Dao, I refine my pill.

Even Medicine Ancestor was not able to distill it into a mature cultivation system.

But Ye Yuan did it!

Not only did he do it, he even spread his cultivation gains to all life, demonstrating it to everyone.

This merit was unprecedented since time immemorial!

A year of spreading Dao, the merit led to a thousand years’ contribution.

Among these progenitor-level powerhouses, each person’s gains were simply immeasurable.

As long as they went into closed-seclusion for some time, their strength would advance by leaps and bounds.

Especially the Sacred Ancestor High Priest, Ye Yuan’s spreading of Dao opened up a new door for him.

Given time, as long as he digested the Dao that Ye Yuan preached on, he had confidence on surpassing Medicine Ancestor!

The tens of millions of alchemy path powerhouses present had tens of thousands who broke through.

Some Eight-star Alchemy Gods who had been stuck at peak Ancestor Realm for many years even faintly showed signs of touching Dao pill.

Before long, a large group of alchemy path powerhouses would appear among these people!

Ye Yuan glanced downwards and could not help sighing emotionally in his heart.

Oh, time!

What he lacked the most right now was time!

He needed time to grow up, these alchemy path powerhouses also needed time to grow up.

But the divine race would not give him this time.

At this time, Sacred Ancestor High Priest clasped his hands to the sky and said in a clear voice, “Demon race’s Priest Temple will revere Ye Yuan as the ancestor of Alchemy Dao today!”

“The human race’s Sky Billow Realm respects Ye Yuan as the ancestor of Alchemy Dao!”

“The human race’s Ninereign Realm respects Ye Yuan as the ancestor of Alchemy Dao!”

... ...

These progenitors’ voices shook the sky, reverberating throughout the whole world.

All of the progenitor-level powerhouses actually revered Ye Yuan as an ancestor!

After the progenitors, it was peak Eight-star alchemy path powerhouses.

“Purple Sandalwood Bodhidharma reveres Ye Yuan as the ancestor of Alchemy Dao!”

“Enlighten Day Bodhidharma reveres Ye Yuan as the ancestor of Alchemy Dao!”

... ...

Each one that opened their mouth was a big shot of the alchemy world. The weight of their words was extremely heavy.

With so many supreme powerhouses respecting Ye Yuan, it could be seen that this spreading of Dao already brought the entire alchemy world into submission.

Those alchemists with meager strength still did not understand what was going on until now.

But so many big shots suddenly respecting Ye Yuan as an ancestor, this matter made them incomparably shocked.

“My God, what’s going on here? So many heavyweights are actually collectively revering Second Sage as an ancestor!”

“Second Sage merely just entered Heavenly Emperor not long, he’s actually conferred the status of an ancestor just like this?”

“Furthermore, this still isn’t an ordinary conferring as an ancestor! Even Medicine Ancestor didn’t have this kind of treatment either!”

... ...

Ye Yuan being conferred the status of an ancestor was different from the other progenitors.

Powerhouses who were able to become progenitors were at least Deva Third and Fourth Blight sovereigns too.

Even Deva First Blight and Second Blights did not have the qualifications to be called ancestors too.

But Ye Yuan just entered Heavenly Emperor not long ago. At present, his strength was only comparable to Heavenly Emperor Second Firmament. Yet, he was actually collectively revered as an ancestor by so many sovereigns!

It was being commonly revered as an ancestor!

This was also to say that all alchemy path powerhouses, including Sacred Ancestor High Priest, were a status lower in front of Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan this ancestor of Alchemy Dao, surmounted above all progenitors!

This scene ... The vibe of ritual was extremely strong.

Powerhouses able to be called progenitors all had their own pride.

These progenitors all admitted that Medicine Ancestor was strong, but would not revere him as the ancestor above progenitors.

You are strong, that’s your business, nothing to do with me.

But today, they put aside the pride of a progenitor towards Ye Yuan.

This sort of thing could be said to be unprecedented since time immemorial!

A mere Heavenly Emperor actually towered above all progenitors.

This sort of thing, even thinking about it felt terrifying.

They did not understand, but they knew that these progenitors were not fools.

Being able to make these proud progenitors lower their heads, Ye Yuan’s spread of Dao definitely held extraordinary significance.

Their realms were too low and they were unable to detect the profundities within.

But they understood that they had witnessed the arrival of a new era of the alchemy path world!

Henceforth, Medicine Ancestor shall become a cloud that passed by, and what replaced him was the ancestor of the alchemy path: Ye Yuan!

In the crowd, Pilljade sighed despondently and said to the Yun Yi beside him, “Yi-er, this old man apologizes to you! Circumstances change with the passing of time. Facts have proved that your choice is right! It’s me whose eyesight was too shallow.”

Cloudheart Realm’s battle, under Ye Yuan’s protection, Pilljade escaped with his life by a fluke.

He and Ye Yuan fought for a thousand years. Only now when Ye Yuan was conferred the status of an ancestor did he know what a ridiculous thing that was.

Even when Ye Yuan spreading Dao, with his realm, he could not fully comprehend it.

But he faintly understood that Ye Yuan really did a major thing that shocked heaven and earth.

Forget about Ye Yuan. Even this descendant of his, he had also surpassed Pilljade all-round in Alchemy Dao presently.

He personally saw those big shots whose fame shook a region, looking humble in front of Yun Yi.

This level of existence, he did not even dare to think about it in the past.

Yun Yi gave him a glance and said with a smile, “What’s Great Grandfather say? You raised Yi-er, groomed Yi-er; Yi-er remembers it in my heart. Yi-er has never blamed Great Grandfather, you don’t need to worry about it. Actually, I followed Master just to seek out a higher level Alchemy Dao too. It’s just that I also didn’t expect that Master could actually walk to this step presently, it’s really like a dream!”

Pilljade blushed with shame in his heart.

He knew that if not looking on the account of Yun Yi’s face, Ye Yuan would have long destroyed Great Imperial Capital Pilljade.

With Ye Yuan’s present strength, destroying Great Imperial Capital Pilljade was nothing at all.

Heavenly Emperor Zhuo Yun probably would not even dare to let out a fart! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Above the void, Ye Yuan’s expression was calm, remaining indifferent whether granted favors or was subjected to humiliation.

Regarding the actions of the group of progenitors, he was indeed a little surprised. But he knew that he could shoulder it.

What he was surprised by was that these progenitors would actually let go of their pride and revere him as an ancestor.

A hundred years of alchemy battle with Medicine Ancestor, Ye Yuan had truly scryed the power of law.

Even though that trace of power of law was extremely vague, it benefited him endlessly.

At that moment, he finally integrated all that he learned and achieved mastery through a comprehensive study of the subject. That was how there was today’s spreading of Dao.

Ye Yuan glanced below and said coolly, “That day, in Cloudheart Realm, I believe that everyone has some understanding too. The human race’s Alchemy Dao has declined for a long time already, even the divine race looks down on it! Since everyone reveres me as an ancestor, then put aside sectarian views, and spread what you’ve learned to all life, and let everyone improve together!”

The divine race was extremely apprehensive of the human race’s Alchemy Dao. But in the last epoch, those alchemy sovereigns all perished for the human race.

Now, even Originguard this fellow could look down on the human race’s Alchemy Dao already.

As long as the alchemy path rose, it would definitely play a key role in the war between the human and divine, two races.

What he lacked was still time!

“This old man will follow what Ancestor Ye says! After Ancestor Ye leaves, I’ll spread the Dao!” Sacred Ancestor High Priest clasped his hands and said.

“We honor what Ancestor Ye says!”

“We honor what Ancestor Ye says!”

... ...

Regarding what Ye Yuan said, the group of progenitors concurred one after another.
