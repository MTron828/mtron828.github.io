Chapter 2321: Killing God Ye Yuan!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Take his life while he’s down!”

“Kill this guy! He’s currently completely drained like a lamp without oil!”

“Don’t give him the chance to recover! Quickly kill him!”

... ...

The current Ye Yuan was emaciated like a stick, seemingly like a dry corpse, looking alarming to the eyes.

Releasing more than ten sword moves in a row, even if Ye Yuan swallowed quite a few medicinal pills, he was still squeezed dry.

Even the flesh and blood of his body was practically sucked dry by the Limitless God Killing Bow.

When many divine race powerhouses saw this scene, they immediately commanded abyss monsters to besiege Ye Yuan.

Clearly, this was the optimal time to kill Ye Yuan.

For a moment, countless powerhouses charged over toward Ye Yuan.

The divine race powerhouses pouring over toward Ye Yuan this side immediately alleviated the pressure on the surrounding human powerhouses.

Many human powerhouses heaved a sigh of relief one after another.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence was already exhausted. He had no way of dealing with these divine race powerhouses and abyss monsters at all currently.

But this did not stump him. It was only to see him snap his fingers repeatedly. A powerful protective array formation formed in virtually an instant.

Bang, bang, bang ...

Countless attacks landed on the array formation, emitting incomparably intense rumbles.

The array formation gave off a dazzling light, blocking the attacks from all directions.

Ye Yuan’s array formation was extremely stable. Even when facing such strong attacks, it was still incredibly stable.

But more and more divine race powerhouses poured over toward his side, making the powerful array formation start faltering too.

Inside the array formation, Ye Yuan built an array formation once more and started refining pills.

This time, his speed clearly slowed down significantly, beginning to pursue quality.

Those divine race powerhouses attacking the array formation were all very anxious.

At this time, the advantage of alchemy path powerhouses was demonstrated.

Ye Yuan, this terrifying alchemy path powerhouse, actually directly refined pills on the battlefield to recharge.

This way, his ability to fight continuously was seriously too fearsome.

Before the alchemy path declined, in the last Doomsday Battle, alchemy path powerhouses clearly unleashed tremendous capabilities, bringing huge problems to the divine race.

Therefore, that was why Originguard did not scruple to pay a huge price to come to Cloudheart Realm and kill the alchemy path powerhouses here.

But the commotion at Ye Yuan this side was seriously too great, drawing more and more divine race powerhouses and abyss monsters.

Ye Yuan’s grand array also started to be in a precarious situation.

After all, this was not a one-person battle, but a battle between populations, a super battle implicating tens of millions of people.

“Everyone, let’s go and protect Second Sage! With him around, our survivability will greatly increase.”

“That’s right! Second Sage’s combat power is extremely shocking, even above the divine race powerhouses. As long as he recovers his strength, our combat power will increase greatly.”

“Everybody, attack together! Alleviate Second Sage’s pressure! Let him be able to refine pills calmly.”

... ...

The human powerhouses clearly realized the seriousness of the problem.

If they allow Ye Yuan to attract the others’ attention at this time, after Ye Yuan was defeated, they still could not escape the fate of being killed.

Hence, many human powerhouses swarmed over spontaneously, and they faced off against the divine race powerhouses and abyss monsters, alleviating Ye Yuan’s pressure.

Inside the array formation, Ye Yuan sensed something, slowly opening his eyes.

There were many human powerhouses around currently defending him tightly. Many people were even directly blown up by divine race powerhouses.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s countenance also could not help to visibly change because of this.

In his impression, human powerhouses were all selfish and did not care about others.

He did not expect that today, under a life-and-death situation, they actually took the initiative to come and help him.

Sure, it was them doing it for their glimmer of hope. But at this time, them being able to let go of their sectarian views indeed broadened Ye Yuan’s horizons.

Ye Yuan forcefully reined his mind and devoted his entire mind and body to the pill refinement process.

At this time, him refining the medicinal pill at the fastest speed was the greatest repayment to the others.

After several hours, a medicinal pill solidified inside the array formation.

This was a Dao pill!

While at this time, dead bodies were already lying all over the ground around Ye Yuan’s array formation.

Many human powerhouses perished in order to protect him.

Ye Yuan directly swallowed the medicinal pill without the slightest hesitation.

After consuming the medicinal pill, Ye Yuan’s emaciated body immediately seemed to be filled with air, recovering to its original form very quickly.

And his aura also skyrocketed, his cultivation realm directly rising by a lot.

After a hundred years of accumulation, Cloudheart Realm’s powerful spiritual energy, plus the astonishing energy inside this Dao pill, Ye Yuan’s realm rose once more.

His current realm was already equivalent to Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

Ye Yuan walked out of the formation, a thousand over flying swords danced around him, the killing intent awe-inspiring.

“You guys have worked hard. Leave the rest to this Ye. You all follow this Ye, this Ye will take you all out!”

While talking, the sword formation flew out. The places that it passed by reaped the lives of divine race powerhouses and abyss monsters without restraint.

With Ye Yuan’s current realm coupled with his various powerful means, he looked down completely on middle-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

Ye Yuan took the lead, opening up the way ahead, and the rest of the human powerhouses followed closely behind.

With Ye Yuan opening up the path in front, the human powerhouses’ pressure fell sharply.

After all, even if it was the divine race and abyss fiend race, the powerhouses that could reach late-stage Heavenly Emperor could be counted on one’s fingers too.

This level of powerhouses, they all had their own opponents and could not divert too many people to deal with Ye Yuan and the people on his side.

Furthermore, in this large-scale battle, the vast majority of the martial artists were all people with very low strength.

The truly high-level combat power experts were just a minority after all.

Originguard launching this war, the ones he was truly targeting were still the high-end combat powers like Medicine Ancestor and Wing. After all, their threat was much, much greater than Ye Yuan.

Targeting Ye Yuan with the extravagant combat power of two squads was already thinking extremely highly of him.

But very clearly, Originguard still underestimated Ye Yuan’s combat power. He borrowed the power of a Dao artifact and forcefully killed all of these two squads.

Right now, the places where Ye Yuan passed through were akin to no man’s land.

More than a thousand flying swords were like one sickle after another, reaping lives everywhere.

The current Ye Yuan had long hair fluttering while killing people, akin to a killing god descending personally.

The powerful divine race and abyss monsters were like lambs awaiting slaughter in front of Ye Yuan. They were unable to withstand the power of his one sword at all. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ye Yuan brought the humans guarding him and plugged into the divine race army like a sharp knife. Very soon, he slaughtered his enemies until the divine race army was in chaos.

“This guy is simply a killing god! He’s too strong! We can’t stop him!”

“Retreat! Quickly Retreat! This person is invincible!”

“This guy is too strong! We’re not a match at all! Quickly go request for the lords to come over!”

... ...

More and more humans gathered around Ye Yuan, following him to break through.

In the previous battle, the human powerhouses suffered heavy losses, casualties nearing half.

But at present, after Ye Yuan joined the battle royale, the situation instantly reversed.

Ye Yuan alone was like a fighting machine, steamrolling over all the way.

His strength was sufficiently strong and he would not be overly cautious because of the other party’s strength.

For a moment, the balance of the war actually started leaning toward the humans!
