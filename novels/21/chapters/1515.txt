Chapter 1519 Catching up From Behind!

The seventh round’s opponent was clearly much stronger than the previous six rounds.

But Ye Yuan himself similarly made great strides in strength and did not feel too great a difficulty.

Pfft!

After several hundred moves, Ye Yuan’s sword passed right through the opponent’s body.

Seventh round, cleared!

Ye Yuan’s sword art became more and more erratic. His entire being gave people an illusionary and ephemeral feeling.

At times, Ye Yuan’s sword was clearly still very far away but suddenly appeared in front of his opponent. It was impossible to guard against.

And all these were attributed to his comprehension of spatial laws.

Two great laws combining together was not a simple one plus one equals two.

“Heh, I didn’t expect that you already comprehended spatial laws at just Heaven Glimpse Realm. Really an unexpected surprise!” Dustless said with a laugh.

“Roughly what is the level of my spatial laws comprehension currently?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

He could sense that spatial laws were too extensive and profound, far more difficult than Sword Dao.

These few days, he cultivated inside the Death Cultivation Space. Coupled with the closed seclusion this time, his improvement was already very big. But he still did not feel the bottleneck of the law. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The more it was like so, the more Ye Yuan felt the difficulty of spatial laws.

“You’re still early! Your current level isn’t even grand completion for spatial laws first-layered heaven initial-stage!” Dustless said.

“So weak huh!” Ye Yuan said speechlessly.

“Weak? Heh heh, right now, your comprehensions in spatial laws are already stronger than the vast majority of half-step Divine Lords! Even if it’s a true Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, he’s also merely able to use spatial laws first-layered heaven. Spatial laws aren’t as simple as you think.”

Ye Yuan could not help being very surprised when he heard. Him comprehending spatial laws was entirely because he drew parallels from inference.

Just how powerful this law was, he was utterly clueless.

Now, hearing Dustless said so, only then did he have an intuitive feeling.

In the past, Ye Yuan only just touched a smattering. But now, after Ye Yuan went through a bout of bitter cultivation, the improvement of spatial laws seem to show a trend of advancing by leaps and bounds.

“Spatial laws are actually so hard!” Ye Yuan exclaimed with a sigh.

“Heh, more than just hard! Time laws and spatial laws are the two most fundamental laws. In the entire Heavenspan World, don’t talk about being able to comprehend, even learning the rudiments is also very rare. You don’t look at how those Divine Lord Realm powerhouses all fly in the sky and tunnel into the earth. Actually, they don’t understand spatial laws at all. Being able to accomplish this is entirely because the power of the world itself contains a portion of spatial laws. Even with this innate advantage, the vast majority of Divine Lord Realm powerhouses are unable to learn the rudiments of spatial laws for all their lives too! While you have already opened this door!” Dustless said.

“Like this, I’m very remarkable?” Ye Yuan said rather surprisedly.

He really did not know that the spatial laws he comprehended were actually so formidable.

But Dustless said solemnly, “Very impressive! However, I can’t help you with spatial laws either. How much you can comprehend will depend on your fortunes.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head. Suddenly recalling something, he said, “Oh, right, inside the World Suppressing Stele, it can actually alter the time flow, could it be ...”

Dustless nodded and said, “That’s right! Back then, Immortal Grove comprehended a trace of time laws by chance. However, he only comprehended a bit of superficial knowledge.”

Indeed so!

The time that Ye Yuan came to the Heavenspan World was not short anymore too. He had never heard of changing the flow of time, this kind of thing.

It turned out that it was actually Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s unique secret technique.

Just comprehended a trace of superficial knowledge and he could change the time flow ratio of one to ten. If one completely comprehended time laws, how terrifying was that?

Ye Yuan felt terrified thinking about it.

Gathering his thoughts, Ye Yuan continued to clear the rounds, challenging the eighth guardian.

While at this time, Di Fan and the eighth guardian’s battle was already drawing to a close.

Boom!

Once more, Di Fan blew his opponent up with a punch.

“Hahaha, awesome!”

Di Fan was covered all over with wounds and scars, virtually not an intact spot on his physical body.

But he still killed his opponent and succeeded in clearing the round.

When he was recovering his strength, Di Fan murmured to himself, “It’s a shame, definitely can’t pass the ninth round! But my battle achievement should be number one among the 12 arena lords, right? Those few people’s strength can at most only make it to the sixth round. Heh, number one or not doesn’t matter. The challenges this time caused a tremendous improvement for my strength!”

Di Fan was completely unaware of the outside world geniuses’ shock.

Ye Yuan actually even cleared the seventh round easily!

“I remember that Di Fan fought roughly more than 2000 rounds with the seventh guardian, right? This Source Night settled it in three or four hundred moves?”

“This ... This is simply unimaginable. Source Night actually caught up from behind.”

“Wonder what kind of expression Di Fan will have when he comes out and sees Source Night.”

...

At the state, Ye Yuan’s clearing speed was very slow. It could be described using turtle speed.

But unknowingly, Ye Yuan actually caught up to Di Fan’s speed!

They saw from Di Fan’s state, his limit was also just the ninth round.

But they completely could not see where Ye Yuan’s limit lay.

In the seventh round, the time Ye Yuan used, it seemed almost the same as in the first round.

The time was only a quarter of Di Fan’s!

This kind of strange situation made these geniuses even feel somewhat afraid.

Finally, Di Fan was defeated in the ninth round.

Afterward, he was transported into a foreign space, chose a fiend lord mystic treasure, and was transported back.

But after he came out, he discovered that everyone was using a strange gaze to look at him.

Di Fan even thought that everyone was stunned by his battle record and said with a big laugh, “All using this kind of expression to look at me for what? Haha, the challenge clears this time is really to my heart’s content! Making it to the ninth round in one go! Even if the mystic treasure is given to the Blood Yama Hall, this trip was also worthwhile!”

He still had a young person’s temperament in the end. The cheerfulness in Di Fan’s heart inevitably had to be expressed.

He seemed to be afraid that others did not know that he made it to the ninth level and showed off a bit without leaving a trace.

But he discovered that everyone did not seem to have the intention of pandering to him.

Among the six sons, Ba Tu and Di Fan’s relationship was pretty good.

Seeing the situation, Ba Tu said with a strange look, “Di Fan, stop showing off. You’ve met your match this time! Come over and take a look!”

Di Fan’s expression turned struck dumb with amazement, looking over in the direction Ba Tu pointed at, and involuntarily shuddered all over, his gaze revealing a look of astonishment.

Regarding Di Fan’s gaze, everyone did not feel surprised.

After each of the Eminent Orchid Six Sons came out, they practically all had this expression.

Pfft!

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s long sword was sent into the other party’s chest once more.

Eighth round, cleared!

Di Fan was seemingly electrocuted by something, his entire person shuddering, as he said in disbelief, “This ... How is this possible? He, a grand completion Fiend General, can actually make it to the ninth round? No, wait, there’s something fis-”

“Shut up!” Ba Tu suddenly shouted coldly, cutting off Di Fan’s words.

Di Fan was taken aback with fright and was just about to fly off the handle, but then he heard Ba Tu say with a cold bellow, “If you don’t want to die, shut your mouth!”
