Chapter 1629 Killing People at a Word of Disagreemen

“roar, roar!”

absolute magnetism black tortoise was smashed flying and immediately fell into a berserk state.

a figure leaped and arrived, standing with his hands behind his back, with the air of a grandmaster.

when everyone saw this figure, they all turned pale with fright.

a half-step celestial deity!

under the situation where realm was suppressed and still have half-step celestial deity’s boundary, plus being able to withstand the powerful forcefield and fly in the air, what was it if not a celestial deity powerhouse?

“second grand elder!”

“song yu!”

ling zikun and gao yuan virtually shouted in unison.

it was just that ling zikun had a happy look while gao yuan’s expression was very ugly.

this song yu and gao yuan were roughly powerhouses of the same generation, so gao yuan recognized at a glance.

it was just that song yu’s talent was greater than gao yuan’s and already broke through to celestial deity realm several tens of thousands of years ago.

his appearance made gao yuan have an impulse to swear.

hearing ling zikun’s yell, everyone’s faces could not help becoming ugly.

“song yu, what’s the meaning of your river eternal imperial city? since there’s a celestial deity powerhouse acting personally, still finding us to be cannon fodders?” gao yuan said in a solemn voice.

this time, apart from river eternal imperial city, the other people’s faces all revealed indignant expressions.

clearly, gao yuan’s words hit the bottom of their hearts. this feeling of being exploited made them very displeased.

that second grand elder song yu maintained very well, looking just like a middle-aged person.

he gave gao yuan a glance and said coolly, “gao yuan, you don’t make wild accusations! divine lord realm has divine lord realm rules, celestial deity realm also has celestial deity realm rules. getting you guys over is firstly, to render assistance. secondly, it’s to gift you all a lucky chance. if you all can obtain the lucky chance, this seat naturally won’t intervene. but now, do you feel that you still have hope? this lucky chance is already not what you all can have a finger in.”

not just gao yuan, the expressions on the other people’s faces became ugly.

what song yu said was right. with this absolute magnetism black tortoise blocking the path, they did not have hopes of passing through at all.

forcefully rushing through was no different from courting death.

song yu continued, “gao yuan, you wouldn’t naively think that i’m the only celestial deity here, right?”

gao yuan’s entire body trembled, his eyes revealing a look of despair.

actually, when he saw this absolute magnetism black tortoise, gao yuan already knew that this lucky chance was not what he could have a share in.

but he still harbored the mentality of getting lucky, hoping to be able to charge inside.

the other people’s thoughts were similar to his. it was just that reality was very cruel.

done talking, song yu said in a clear voice, “already came, come on out. don’t need this seat to personally invite you all to reveal yourselves, right?”

the surroundings were still silent, no one responded to song yu’s words.

song yu gave a cold snort and casually fired out two rays of sword light.

whoosh!

the sword lights tore through the air, directly shattering the rock walls into smithereens.

a sinister-looking fiend race powerhouse stepped out of the air and said in a cold voice, “heh, song yu brat, you dare to make a move against this old man, are you tired of living?”

when qiao an saw this fiend powerhouse, he could not help being greatly roused as he said, “lord ka suo!

by the side, ye yuan’s gaze turned cold, staring fixedly at that fiend race powerhouse.

this guy was the main culprit who instigated kanuo to invade the immortal grove region!

ye yuan also did not expect to actually meet him here.

it was just too bad, his current strength was not sufficient to kill the other party at all.

“humph! you, this old fellow, lived to a ripe old age and is also merely first-layered heaven celestial deity, what are you being cocky for?” song yu said with a cold snort.

ka suo sneered and said, “brat, old ginger is spicier than young ones! you enjoyed success since young. but a moment of carelessness and you’ll suffer a big loss!”

song yu said coolly, “enough crap, let’s showcase our true abilities! lei yi, what do you say?”

at this time, another person stepped out of the void. it was precisely the other direction of song yu’s sword finger.

this person was a human powerhouse, his face seemed quite aged. he was shockingly a half-step celestial deity powerhouse too.

lei yi gave song yu a glance and said coolly, “i’m only here for the xiantian mystic treasure. the rest has nothing to do with me!”

song yu snorted coldly and said, “selfish and egotistic person! enough nonsense, take care of this beast first before talking!”

lei yi darted him a glance and did not refute, seemingly very disdainful.

the moment three great celestial deity powerhouses appeared, the others did not even dare to breathe loudly.

even though these three people were all first-layered heaven celestial deity cultivation, they were god knows how many times stronger than gao yuan, this half-step celestial deity.

even though their realms were suppressed too, it was also merely suppressed to the realm of half-step celestial deity.

“heh, at least you’re sensible! everything, wait until seeing the xiantian mystic treasure before talking. this old man is very much looking forward to this treasure!” ka suo said with a smile.

“roar, roar, roar!”

the absolute magnetism black tortoise seemed to have heard the three people’s words and started roaring crazily.

only to see him open his gaping maws. a series of incomparably massive spiritual energy cannons blasted towards the three people.

this power was even greater than before.

“hump! ignorant beast!”

song yu gave a cold snort. lifting his hand, an enormous sword fired out.

the other two people did not hold back either, each displaying their abilities.

for a moment, spiritual energy flew everywhere in this canyon.

bang! bang! bang!

how could the absolute magnetism black tortoise be the three people’s match, directly being badly beaten?

however, he did not suffer overly severe injuries.

ka suo’s face fell and said, “this large tortoise has coarse skin and thick flesh. we can’t budge it at all. we’d best not tangle with him and directly rush over!”

the other two people nodded their heads and did not object.

but right then, ka suo’s gaze suddenly swept over toward ye yuan.

ye yuan’s entire body tensed up as if being stared at by a venomous snake.

without the slightest hesitation, ye yuan turned around and fled!

ka suo laughed coldly and said, “kid, no matter what grudge you have with me, this old man doesn’t wish to leave a disaster alive in this world!”

done talking, ka suo pointed a finger. a burst of force tore across the sky, virtually catching up to ye yuan in an instant.

ka suo just casually attacked, but to ye yuan, it was a fatal killing move!

everyone could not react. when zheng qi reacted to it, this force already arrived in front of ye yuan.

“ye yuan!” zheng qi roared.

the corners of ka suo’s mouth curled slightly as if already seeing the scene of ye yuan being blasted into dregs.

he knew that ye yuan knew spatial laws, but so what?

in front of a celestial deity realm powerhouses, spatial laws were not easy to use either!

rumble!

sparks flew everywhere, this burst of power directly exploded in midair.

the smoke disappeared, ye yuan’s figure was long gone already.

the corners of ka suo’s mouth curled slightly and he said, “brat who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, to actually dare inquire about this old man’s intel from the blood yama hall! courting death!”

with song yu’s strength, he could naturally stop ka suo, but he did not. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

because he felt that ye yuan was a latent threat to river eternal imperial city.

such a monster was seriously too terrifying.

good that he died!

“this kid is rather interesting. so many people, it seemed like only he discovered us,” song yu said coolly.

ka suo smiled coldly and said, “so what if discovered? playing with fire in front of celestial deity powerhouses, isn’t it a very normal thing to burn themselves to death? old punk, what are you looking at? keep looking and you believe this old man will kill you too?”

the latter half of the sentence, ka suo was talking to zheng qi.

zheng qi’s gaze when looking at ka suo now was full of rage.

ye yuan was actually killed right under his eyelids just like that!
