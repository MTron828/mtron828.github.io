Chapter 2032: Battling a Group of Heroes

A good show was starting! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the plaza, everyone’s gazes were gathered on Ye Yuan.

“It’s Empyrean Wenlan! His alchemy strength is also a top five existence among the group of Empyreans. Making him accept his position under Ye Yuan, he’s likely unwilling to submit!”

“I didn’t expect it! The curtains of the Cloudpill Summit has just drawn and gunpowder smell came out!”

“I heard that Empyrean Wenlan and the Zheng Family’s ancestor are best friends. This is coming to uphold justice for him!”

...

Empyrean Wenlan who spoke was ranked fifth among the Empyrean seats.

This was also to say that below grandmaster, he was ranked fifth!

This kind of strength was also not at all inferior compared to grandmasters.

The moment he opened his mouth, those Empyreans all looked at Ye Yuan with looks of amusement, wanting to see how he faced the crisis in front of him.

Those present could be said to be the entire Southern Border’s alchemy world.

If Ye Yuan revealed his true colors in front of so many people, he would probably have no face to meet people in the future.

At this time, another person opened his mouth and said, “What Brother Wenlan said is right. Even a mere True God Realm is riding on top of our heads. What face do we, these old fellows, still have to meet our children and grandchildren when we go back?”

The moment this Empyrean opened his mouth, someone immediately cried out in surprise, “It’s Empyrean Daogan, the rank eight big shot! There’s a good show to watch now!”

No one would have thought that these Empyreans would directly launch an attack in the opening address.

Furthermore, observant and conscientious people also saw through that when Empyrean Pilljade was introducing Ye Yuan, it was clearly different from the rest.

He only said that Ye Yuan was a genius that Empyrean Flutterfeather invited. This cut himself away cleanly.

It was Empyrean Flutterfeather making fun of everyone, nothing to do with Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital. Empyrean Pilljade implied this meaning.

Right at this time, the rank three old man on the Empyrean seats also slowly opened his mouth and said, “Ignorant brat, what capability do you have to dare sit on the grandmaster seat? Brother Flutterfeather, are you joking with the Southern Border’s alchemy world?”

“Hiss!”

The sounds of cold air being sucked in came from below.

“Rank three Empyrean Remotenight, rank fifth Empyrean Wenlan, rank eighth Empyrean Daogan. My God, Ye Yuan is in trouble now!”

The Cloudpill Summit had just started. Ye Yuan had yet to take his seat and three great Empyreans already directly put him on the spot.

By the side, Empyrean Pilljade had his head lowered, looking straight down, as if all this had nothing to do with him.

Empyrean Flutterfeather did not seem to mind and said with a faint smile, “Why does Brother Remotenight say so? Since this Empyrean gave the grandmaster token to Ye Yuan, I naturally acknowledge his strength.”

Empyrean Remotenight smiled coldly and said, “A mere thousand over years old snotty brat, what strength can he have? I heard before that he completed one of Brother Lumen’s ancient formulas. It’s just ... can this prove his strength? I also heard that he didn’t even dare to accept the challenge of a group of juniors. How can such a person sit on a grandmaster seat?”

Empyrean Wenlan said coolly, “Want to seat on that position of grandmaster, one naturally has to bring out the corresponding strength. Looking at his age, being able to refine rank five divine pills is already considered pretty good.”

An Empyrean said with a loud laugh, “Hey, kid, do you dare to accept this Empyrean’s challenge? If you don’t dare, hurry up and get down! The seat of a grandmaster isn’t so easy to sit!”

“Yeah, if even we can’t win, what qualifications do you have to sit on a grandmaster seat?”

With three great Empyreans taking the lead, it immediately made many Seven-star Alchemy Gods join in.

Although Empyrean Lumen already spread the news of the exchange meet, Ye Yuan did not take action after all.

Wanting to make these Seven-star Alchemy Gods completely accept a True God Realm, this was virtually something impossible.

At this time, Empyrean Pilljade suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Grandmaster Ye, looks like everyone has some doubts about your strength, why don’t ... you display a little?”

Empyrean Pilljade instructing, everyone’s gazes collectively gathered on Ye Yuan once more.

Quite a few people revealed amused expressions, all waiting to see Ye Yuan make a spectacle of himself.

Under the watchful gazes of the people, how would Ye Yuan respond?

From appearing on the stage until now, Ye Yuan was silent and did not speak all along.

Currently, Empyrean Pilljade asking questions, Ye Yuan’s two eyes suddenly narrowed, sweeping over the faces of the group of Empyreans.

“You, you, also you, just now, you said that you want to challenge me?” Ye Yuan casually pointed at a few people, they were all Empyrean powerhouses who hooted at Ye Yuan the loudest.

“Haha, it’s this Empyrean! Why? Is Grandmaster Ye going to accept this Empyrean’s challenge?” One of the Empyreans said with a big laugh.

Ye Yuan ignored him and said coolly, “Who else is there? Since everyone is doubting this Ye’s strength, fine. I’ll give you all a chance! Any of you who wants to challenge me, this Ye will accept it all! If this Ye loses a match, I’ll hand over the grandmaster token and withdraw from this Cloudpill Summit!”

One sentence stunned everyone.

“What a domineering declaration! He wants to challenge all the Seven-star Alchemy Gods below grandmaster with his power alone!”

“Heh heh, domineering also have to have the strength to be domineering! Forget about those at the bottom, those Empyreans ranked near the top, their strengths are virtually not weaker than the invited grandmasters. How much ability does he have, to dare challenge all of the Empyreans?”

...

A hundred Seven-star Alchemy Gods, their strength was naturally not uniform either.

The weak ones only had the strength of initial-stage Seven-star, initial-stage Dao Realm.

The strong ones were the likes of Empyrean Remotenight and his ilk, alchemy strength virtually not inferior to grandmaster powerhouses.

Ye Yuan, a puny little Six-star Alchemy God, these words were also too arrogant, right?

“Hahaha, truly unbridled on the account of your young age! When did our Southern Border’s alchemy world produce such an arrogant junior? Do you know that those seated here today are all the leading authority figures of the Southern Border’s alchemy world? You actually dare to challenge everyone?” Empyrean Remotenight could not help laughing out loud when he heard that.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Since this Ye is sitting in this grandmaster seat, if I can’t even win you guys, what qualifications do I have to sit here still?”

Empyrean Remotenight’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “What a conceited brat! This alchemy battle, this Empyrean accepts it! This Empyrean wants to see whether or not you’re really a heaven-defying talent!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes did not even blink as he said coolly, “Okay, this Ye accepts! Who else is there?”

“Me!”

“This Empyrean will also challenge you!”

“Humph! Arrogant punk, this Empyrean will let you know that the majesty of Seven-star Alchemy Gods cannot be provoked!”

...

How could the group of Empyreans stand Ye Yuan being so arrogant? Each and every one of them stepped forward and challenged Ye Yuan one after another.

On the second Empyrean seat, Empyrean Purplewing’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said to Empyrean Flutterfeather, “Brother Flutterfeather, this ... is likely not proper, right?”

But Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled faintly and said, “Relax, Ye Yuan has his sense of propriety.”

Empyrean Purplewing could not help choking when he heard that. Flutterfeather’s confidence in Ye Yuan was also a little too high, right?

In just a short while, there were 50 over Empyreans challenging Ye Yuan. Their rankings went from the third place Remotenight to the 100th.

Empyrean powerhouses capable of sitting on the platform were at least Dao Realm powerhouses too.

Those second-rate Seven-star Alchemy Gods, the Cloudpill Summit would not invite at all.

Therefore, even those Empyreans’ rankings were toward the back, their strength could not be underestimated.

Right at this time, a thin and emaciated old man beside Empyrean Purplewing opened his mouth and said nonchalantly, “Why don’t you count this old man in as well?”
