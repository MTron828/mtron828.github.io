Chapter 1390 Not yet Complete

Clank!

Ye Yuan pointed a sword finger out, directly tapping Qin Shao’s long sword flying.

“Ye Yuan, what’s the meaning of this? If I want to die, could it be that you can stop it?” Qin Shao roared at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Can’t even suffer this bit of setback? The Heavenspan World is so large. Young geniuses stronger than me and you are more than schools of carps crossing a stream! If everyone is like you, a thousand lives is also insufficient to die. The martial path is arduous, not reaching the end, who knows what would happen? Speaking lightly of life and death, that’s the action of cowards. I know what you will face in the future. How much vilification you can stand up to is how many commendations you can bear. This Ye will say until here, life and death is your own business. Want to live, want to die, you decide yourself.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan turned around and left.

Qin Shao’s entire body trembled. Clearly, he was currently struggling violently inside.

He slowly walked in front of his long sword, gripped the sword handle, but delayed in taking any action.

No idea how long had passed either, the martial arena was long stark empty already. He finally picked up the long sword and left desolately.

A figure blocked his path.

“You’re cowardly! Someone who failed has no reason to live on this earth.” Qin Tian’s cold voice came over.

Qin Shao did not look at him. He just said calmly, “To live on requires even more courage! I ... I want to become strong!”

“Weaklings are forever weaklings! The path of a powerhouse is always to never stop advancing, while you, you have run ashore!” Qin Tian said.

Qin Shao slowly raised his head, met Qin Tian’s eyes, and said calmly, “There will come a day where I’ll surpass you!”

Qin Tian smiled faintly and said, “This day will never arrive. You ... conduct yourself well!”

Seeing Qin Tian off with his eyes, Qin Shao’s gaze was a never-before firm.

Since young, it was his first time daring to look Qin Tian in the eyes like this.

Qin Shao had never been so eager to defeat Qin Tian before!

He fought for the Qin Family, but what he got was a ‘trash.’

He wanted to let the Qin Family’s people see that their choice was wrong!

...

At the Qin Family’s residence, Qin Nantian was currently in a thundering rage.

“That trash actually didn’t commit suicide! In my view, he colluded with that Ye Yuan!’ Qin Nantian roared furiously.

When Wang Song heard that, he hurriedly said, “Uncle Qin, there isn’t without this possibility! Otherwise, why would they make this three years agreement? Likely, they have long planned it out already and want to embarrass the Qin Family! Qin Shao feels that his talent doesn’t lose to Brother Qin Tian’s, and feels that the family’s resource allocation isn’t fair. Hence, he harbored hatred in his heart, it’s not impossible too!”

In the eyes of despicable people, other people’s mindsets were naturally filthy too.

Wang Song caught this opportunity and directly dropped a stone down the well.

But his words were really convincing, especially the latter half.

Qin Nantian’s expression changed, and he was even more livid with rage.

He said icily, “Starting from today, immediately cease all resource supply to Qin Shao, and banish his parents to Wu Xiang City! Living off us while secretly helping others, the Qin Family expended so many resources to nurture him in vain!”

Qin Tian’s gaze flickered by the side but did not say anything.

Wang Song continued talking, “Uncle Qin, this Ye Yuan is really a troublesome character. If we allow him to grow unchecked, there will probably be no one capable of restraining him in the future!”

Qin Nantian nodded his head, deeply feeling that way too.

Regardless of whether or not Qin Shao lived off them while secretly helping others, that Sundering Stars move of Ye Yuan’s really astounded everyone.

Among them included him, Qin Nantian!

Before today, Wu Meng Capital City’s number genius was his son, Qin Tian.

But after today, this title of number one genius will likely have to change owners!

Qin Nantian gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “This Ye Yuan must die!”

Wang Song thought about it and said, “Want to kill Ye Yuan, the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial is the best chance! Otherwise, we can only wait for him to ascend to the inner-court, and take action when he goes out to carry out missions. It’s just that at that time, Ye Yuan’s strength would have risen to no idea what kind of extent again.”

Watching finish this battle, Qin Nantian only felt annoyed, but Wang Song was scared silly.

Wang Song and the Qin Family walked close together, Qin Shao’s strength, he was very clear.

Ye Yuan only used five years’ time and surpassed Qin Shao in all aspects.

Once he broke through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, dealing with him, Wang Song, was simply capturing with ease.

Qin Nantian’s eyes lit up, and he said, “I forgot about it if you didn’t mention it! There are still a few years, and it’s time for the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial again. Want to kill this punk, this is the best timing! However, Ye Yuan’s matters will need to be eased up. You all tell the Qin Family disciples in the academy not to go find trouble with Ye Yuan these few years. These two years, the Qin Family and Ye Yuan has become the talk of the town. Want to take any action, we’ll definitely be targeted. I’ll arrange this matter. You all go!”

These few years, Ye Yuan could be said to have shot to fame.

Defeating Qin Shao this time, Ye Yuan’s fame was unparalleled for some time, becoming the man of the hour at the height of his power in Wu Meng Academy.

The top dog being pulled down, this sort of thing, it was not that it did not happen before in the past.

But as fast as this season, it was still the first time in history.

“I really didn’t expect that not only is this Ye Yuan’s background solid, his own strength is actually so powerful too!”

“That Sundering Stars move is simply incredible! At that time, separated by the grand array, I could even feel that might of that move!”

“One sword forcefully defeated two supreme academy skills. I say, will this move of his be recruited by the academy as the seventh supreme academy skill?”

“Very likely! Once it becomes the seventh supreme academy skill, Ye Yuan will likely be the youngest hall of fame member in Wu Meng Capital City’s history!”

...

At this time, in front of Ye Yuan was a very sagacious elderly man.

This old man was not an ordinary person. He was Wu Meng City Lord’s right-hand man, Wu Meng Academy’s actual helmsman, Wen Yiyang!

Wu Meng City Lord was just the academy’s nominal head. Normally, he did not run things.

While this Wen Yiyang was the figure responsible for the academy’s operations.

“Ye Yuan, actually, when you were in the entrance examination, I already noticed you! You have great potential!” Wen Yiyang said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for the academy head’s praise!”

Wen Yiyang was slightly stunned. He was somewhat surprised by Ye Yuan’s indifference to favor and disgrace.

If ordinary students obtained such praise from him, they would definitely be excited until they did not know what to say.

But Ye Yuan did not appear the least bit excited.

Wen Yiyang discovered that for Ye Yuan to be able to create Sundering Stars, this kind of martial technique, it was indeed not a fluke!

“Huhu, that Sundering Stars move was what you comprehended from the Sword Tomb?” Wen Yiyang did not beat around the bush either, asking straight away.

“That’s right. Disciple bitterly comprehended at the Sword Tomb’s first level and second level for five years, finally created this martial technique, naming it Chaos Heaven Opening Sword Art! This Sundering Stars is the first move. However, it’s not yet complete.”

Wen Yiyang’s gaze turned intent and he said in surprise, “Not yet complete?”

One sword defeating two supreme academy skills, and it was actually still an incomplete version.

When this move was completed, how great would the power be?

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “The Sword Tomb is indeed a superb place to comprehend the sword, extensive and profound. This Ye Yuan bitterly comprehended for five years and only reached the second level too. There’s still a considerable distance to grand completion Sword Dao first-layered heaven.”
