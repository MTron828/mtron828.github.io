1419 Taking the Initiative to Meet the Attack

“S-So strong!”

Bai Chen drew a mouthful of cold air, being stunned by the Nether Ghostclaw’s power.

One claw bringing down nine great Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm powerhouses, this strength was simply too heaven-defying.

“That ... That is a late-stage Heaven Glimpse Ghost Dao powerhouse, right? Such a powerhouse, why would he follow this guy?”

“Deputy Palace Lord Bai Xiu and this Ghost Dao powerhouse’s strength is more or less the same, but he was actually defeated so badly!”

“The aura of that ghost claw just now was too terrifying. I felt that my soul was taken away. Just what the hell was that?”

...

When the few young masters saw this scene, each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths.

Gui Yun’s appearance was seriously too astonishing, mowing down nine great Heaven Glimpse powerhouses in one move.

The key was that this kind of powerful Ghost Dao powerhouse actually submitted under Ye Yuan’s rule!

Each and every one of them was incredibly envious. If they had a hired thug like this, wouldn’t becoming the palace lord be a cinch?

In the end, a large fist was the absolute principle!

Whatever legitimacy, whatever schemes and intrigues, one could only submit in the face of absolute strength.

Ye Yuan looked at the nine great elders in a sorry plight and said coolly, “I wonder if now, Young Lord Bai Chen has the qualifications to succeed the position of palace lord or not?”

The nine great elders’ faces were all incomparably ugly, but nobody said anything.

“If you all are not talking, I’ll take it as you guys agreed! Bai Chen, sit on the seat that belongs to you in the first place!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

At this time, Bai Chen started trembling all over because of agitation.

Even after Ye Yuan yelled out, he still stood there in a daze, at a loss on what to do.

Mo Yun was incomparably joyful too. Giving him a pat on the back, he said with a smile, “Go on, what are you still in a daze for?”

Only then did Bai Chen suddenly wake up fully, walking step by step over toward that seat belonging to the palace lord.

“Hang on!” Bai Xiu struggled to stand up as he stopped.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over him indifferently and said, “Why? You still have objections?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Bai Xiu said in a solemn voice, “Bai Chen, this guy’s origins are unclear. Your act of simply acknowledging a master, are you going to push the White Night Sacred Palace into an abyss of eternal doom?”

At this time, Mo Yun spoke up, “Lord Ye Yuan is a reclusive powerhouse. As for the thing that you’re worrying about, that’s impossible! Bai Chong that treacherous villain colluded with the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace, wanting to besiege Young Lord Bai Chen in the Wilderness Forest. Lord Ye Yuan annihilated over a dozen Deity Realm powerhouses, including Wu Xin, with one sword, only then, rescuing us! It’s precisely because Lord Ye Yuan’s strength is formidable, that I let Young Lord Bai Chen acknowledge him as master, assisting Young Lord Bai Chen to defend the foreign enemy together!”

When Bai Xiu and the eight great elders heard this, their expressions changed once more.

They still thought that Ye Yuan’s might was entirely dependent on this Ghost Dao powerhouse. They did not expect that his own strength was actually so formidable too!

More importantly, they actually could not fathom Ye Yuan’s depths!

Wu Xin’s strength, they were naturally very clear. It was evenly-matched with Mo Yun.

One sword annihilating over a dozen Deity Realm powerhouses, even they could not do it too.

With this, no one had objections anymore.

No matter how the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace used a ruse of inflicting self-injury in order to win the confidence of the enemy, it was also impossible to give away the lives of over a dozen Deity Realm powerhouses in vain.

Although the sacred palace’s Grotto Profound powerhouses were quite a few, over a dozen Grotto Profound powerhouses was already a force that could not be ignored.

No matter how foolish the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s palace lord was, he would not do this kind of thing either.

“If nobody has objections, then I’ll invite the Elders Association to announce to the world. Young Lord Bai Chen will take over the position of palace lord from this day forth! Deputy Palace Lord Bai Xiu, I wonder if you still have objections?”

Ye Yuan used a very indifferent gaze to look at Bai Xiu. No idea why, Bai Xiu involuntarily shuddered.

“I ... I have no objections! Young Lord Bai Chen taking over as palace lord is right and proper to begin with!” Bai Chen said with some unwillingness.

Even Bai Xiu had no objections, the others naturally had no objections too.

Just like this, Bai Chen successfully became the White Night Sacred Palace’s new palace lord!

The matter was urgent, the Elders Association announced to the world on that day, proclaiming that Young Lord Bai Chen succeeded the position of palace lord.

Having come this far, the struggle to become the palace lord finally settled down!

“Master Ye Yuan, what should my next step be?”

Although he became the palace lord, Bai Chen had no plans at all.

Right away, he fought Ye Yuan to inquire about the plan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re the palace lord. What should be done, you need to have a score in your heart! I can help you be the palace lord, but I can’t possibly help you for life. Those old fellows are all not to be trifled with. If you don’t grow up as soon as possible, you’ll be eaten by them until not even bone residue is left.”

Bai Chen’s expression changed, suddenly recalling Ye Yuan’s, identity.

He would eventually leave one day. It was impossible to keep on helping him by his side.

Once Ye Yuan left, what he would be facing was a horde of savage beasts!

Mo Yun’s expression turned slightly grim too and he said, “Palace Lord, what Lord Ye Yuan said makes sense! In the past, you had the old palace lord protecting you, so the others don’t dare to do anything to you. But now, everything can only rely on yourself!”

Bai Chen’s expression flickered incessantly and he said rather jittery: “But I ... I ...”

Ye Yuan said, “Just go do what you want to do! With me around, you can be unrestrained! What you have to do is to grow up within the shortest time!”

Bai Chen’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan with a strange gaze.

Meeting Ye Yuan’s calm gaze, not knowing why, Bai Chen’s originally flustered thoughts calmed down a lot suddenly.

“Teacher Mo Yun, summon all of the White Night Sacred Palace’s Deity Realm powerhouses. Tomorrow morning, set off for the frontiers, we’ll take the initiative to meet the attack! I’m going to let the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace’s people know that our White Night Sacred Palace is not easy to bully!” Bai Chen said in a solemn voice.

At this moment, Bai Chen’s body inexplicably had an additional trace of domineeringness.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he could not help smiling slightly.

It seemed like a series of setbacks finally made this greenhouse flower grow up.

At this time, Ye Yuan threw out a small medicinal bottle and said, “Take this thing. The effect shouldn’t be inferior to the Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit. In the Elders Association, we need our own elder too.”

Mo Yun’s entire body trembled, looking at Ye Yuan with great surprise, and looked at the medicinal pill in his hands again.

“Lord Ye Yuan, Mo Yun ... is forever in debt!”

At this time, the excitement in Mo Yun’s heart truly could not be greater.

He was stuck at half-step Heaven Glimpse Realm for no idea how many years already. But kept being unable to break through this hurdle.

The Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit, this sort of thing, was too precious. Not everybody could obtain it.

The old palace lord also only had that one in his hands. It was left to Bai Chen.

And now, Ye Yuan casually gave him a medicinal pill that could break through this heavenly chasm. How could he not be agitated?

This medicinal pill was called Jade Dragon Heaven Glimpse Pill, a pill formula in Dustless’s hands.

When Ye Yuan was practicing medicinal pills, he casually refined it.

This medicinal pill was a pinnacle-most existence among Tier 1 medicinal pills, capable of increasing the chances of a martial artist’s breakthrough.

This was especially true for half-step Heaven Glimpse powerhouses. They already had a certain understanding of Heaven Glimpse Realm. Consuming the Jade Dragon Heaven Glimpse Pill, the effects were naturally greatly increased.

As long as Mo Yun’s talent was not too poor, breaking through to Heaven Glimpse should not be an issue.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a faint smile, “Presumably, you guys also know, I’m not devoid of desires or requests by helping you all. Just take this as a bit of repayment.”

Mo Yun and Bai Chen trembled all over, their gazes revealing a complicated look.
