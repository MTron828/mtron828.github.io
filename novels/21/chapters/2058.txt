Chapter 2062: Overwhelmingly Defeating the Southern Border With His Power Alone!

Standing at the right side and looking at Ye Yuan who had a smile that was not a smile, Empyrean Proudcloud felt uncomfortable as if having eaten a fly.

After twists and turns, he finally still stood in front of Ye Yuan and was forced to admit his fault!

If he had long known it would be like this, might as well directly take a step back at that time. It would also not be to an extent of like this right now.

“Grandmaster Ye, Proudcloud is here to apologize to you!” Empyrean Proudcloud said with a solemn face.

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said coolly, “Do you feel that I’ll accept this kind of insincere apology? If you can’t swallow your pride, why not Brother Proudcloud go back right away and prepare for another battle?”

Empyrean Proudcloud’s face alternated between green and white. So many people were looking at them the moment, and yet he had to apologize to a True God Realm junior in public. This was simply unprecedented humiliation.

The most important thing was that he apologized and the other party was still not satisfied!

It was just that he did not see his own expression. How was that an apology? It was clearly coming to demand repayment of a debt.

Empyrean Windrider also could not endure the sight of it anymore. His brows were furrowing slightly as he said, “Proudcloud, if you still have no regard for what’s important, this Empyrean can’t protect you anymore after this!”

Proudcloud’s face changed and he gritted his teeth and said with a bow, “Grandmaster Ye, the matter previously was all Proudcloud’s fault. I hope that you raise your hand high in mercy and don’t carry on fighting with the Southern Border Alliance anymore!”

This time, although they could still hear his unwillingness, his attitude was clearly much more sincere.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Forget it. Looking at your reluctant and unwilling appearance, I won’t make things difficult for you. But you wouldn’t be thinking of apologizing to this Ye with a single sentence, right?”

Proudcloud gritted his teeth and said, “Of course not! This Empyrean is willing to take out 20% of his territory to give to Grandmaster Ye!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “If you had long known what would happen today, why behave like that back then?”

Proudcloud was virtually about to explode, but right at this time, he heard Ye Yuan said faintly, “However ... that was the price for ten years ago. Back then, you invaded and occupied my territory. So this Ye wants an explanation. If you took out 20% of your territory, everything can naturally be discussed. But you all bullied people by taking advantage of your power and forced this Ye and Brother Flutterfeather out of the Southern Border Alliance. At this present time, you want to dismiss us with a mere 20% of your territory?”

Proudcloud’s territory was not considered big among all of the factions in the first place.

20% of the territory was sufficient to make his flesh hurt for a long time.

But hearing Ye Yuan’s words, he knew that this matter was likely unable to be settled anymore.

“I wonder just what Grandmaster Ye wants before you’re willing to drop matters?!” Empyrean Proudcloud closed his two eyes and got ready to risk it all.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Back then, those factions that took part in fighting for the territory all took out 40% of their territory. While you, Empyrean Proudcloud, took out 50% of your territory. If we do like in the past, this matter will be considered dropped.”

Empyrean Proudcloud’s expression changed wildly and he said furiously, “You ... You’re bullying people too far!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, his aura suddenly changing as he said in a cold voice, “I’m bullying people too far? Back then, the agreement was just decided and you all reneged on your words, snatching this Ye’s territory! Yet, you all still felt zero shame and wanted to settle things without even a word of apology. How can there be such a bargain in this world? Later, your Southern Border Alliance sowed discord between Brother Flutterfeather and me in order to deal with this Ye. Later, we were even forced out of the Southern Border Alliance. After that, you all invaded the Myriad Treasure Tower’s territory in a massive invasion and joined forces with a hundred forces to carry out a campaign against the Myriad Treasure Tower. This one event after another, this Ye hasn’t said anything yet. Now, when it came out of your mouth, it came out that this Ye bullying people too far?”

Each sentence Ye Yuan said, he took a step forward, the momentum astonishing.

Someone was powerful as Empyrean Proudcloud was actually repeatedly forced back by Ye Yuan.

When Windrider and the rest saw, they could not help feeling dumbfounded in their hearts.

A mere True God Realm actually forced back an Empyrean powerhouse!

But they had to admit that Ye Yuan’s grandmaster air was already formed, the imposing momentum on his body surmounting above all life.

This aura did not lord over others, but it gave people a feeling akin to that of the mighty ocean, causing them not daring to look straight at him!

Empyrean Windrider heaved a slight sigh. He knew that Proudcloud was already thoroughly suppressed by Ye Yuan and had no way of negotiating at all anymore.

“What Grandmaster Ye said is true. It’s just that ... your demands are a little too harsh, right?” Windrider spoke up.

Ye Yuan gave another cold laugh and said, “Brother Windrider, this is just me and Proudcloud settling some scores. My score with Brother Pilljade and the Southern Border Alliance hasn’t been calculated yet! Don’t put things nicely. This Ye is standing here with the bearing of a victor today. If this Ye was defeated, your methods will likely be ten times fiercer than this Ye, right?”

Empyrean Windrider’s face changed, but he still said with an awkward smile, “This ... How can this be possible?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Whether it’s possible or not, you and I have a score in our hearts. So saying anymore is pointless. I’m only asking you, can my demand be satisfied or not?”

Empyrean Windrider nodded and said, “Okay, the alliance agrees on their behalf! Whatever conditions Grandmaster Ye still has, why don’t you say it out together.”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “The rest can still be discussed. The Southern Border Alliance will compensate Heavenly Eagle ten million high-grade divine essence stones. In addition, I’ll give a list later. You guys prepare the natural treasures on it and my hurdle will be considered cleared. However, don’t you all think about this being settled all in one go. Only after the divine essence stones and the natural treasures on the list have fully arrived that Brother Flutterfeather will start his negotiations with you all.”

Empyrean Windrider’s face alternated between green and white. He felt like he was negotiating with an old monster, and not a thousand over years old young man.

This guy advanced gradually and entrenched himself at every step, not giving you any chance to play tricks at all.

He just planned to drag it out when Ye Yuan directly throttled him.

Ten million high-grade divine essence stones were nothing. It was just a single hair from nine oxen to a colossal giant like the Southern Border Alliance.

But the list that Ye Yuan pulled out would definitely far exceed ten million high-grade divine essence stones.

Furthermore, these spirit medicines must be very rare. Even if the Myriad Treasure Tower took action, they might not be able to collect them fully.

This kid was really a bloodsucker!

But Empyrean Windrider was also clear that Ye Yuan here was merely the small end. The real largest share was still at Empyrean Flutterfeather there.

The negotiation with the Myriad Treasure Tower was the major thing that had important consequences.

Empyrean Windrider mused for a while and said, “Alright, this matter, this Empyrean will agree on behalf of the alliance.”

...

After Empyrean Windrider reached the Myriad Treasure Tower, the news of the Southern Border Alliance suffering a miserable defeat and lowering their heads swept throughout the entire Southern Border like the wind.

Not only did it cause a great sensation in the alchemy world, it similarly caused a stir in the entire martial arts world.

Those who were well-informed all understood that the Southern Border Alliance did not lose to the Myriad Treasure Tower but lost to a genius alchemist called Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s great fame instantly spread throughout the entire Southern Border.

...

At the Luo Family residence, the Luo Family’s ancestor had an appearance of bitter resentment and being let down.

He pointed at Luo Tianqi’s nose and scolded him severely, “You fool! An utter fool! If you enter Grandmaster Ye’s tutelage and achieve the grand completion Dao Realm in the future, you’ll be a great power of this Southern Border! A god-sent opportunity like this, you actually ran in front of Grandmaster Ye to flaunt your prowess? Was your head kicked by a donkey?”

Luo Tianqi did not give in. He said, “Ancestor, how could Tianqi have known back then that he, a salted fish, could also gain a new lease on life? Moreover, our Luo Family is backed by a heavenly emperor. So why is there a need to lick his smelly feet?”

“You!” The Luo Family’s ancestor was angered until he blew smoke from all seven orifices, and he roared furiously, “Scram! Get lost for me! Starting from today, you’ll be confined for 500 years and not permitted to take one step out of your room!”
