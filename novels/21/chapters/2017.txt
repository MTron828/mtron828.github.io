Chapter 2021: Challenging in Public

“Number one alchemy genius? Huhu, what high-sounding sentiments. At his age, even if he started refining pills in his mother’s womb, his accomplishments will also be limited, right? Let alone that I heard that his martial arts are very formidable,” Yun Yi said with a disdainful look.

“Yeah, I saw with my own eyes. He sent the Fifth Firmament True God Commander Gan flying with one move,” Zheng Buqun said.

Yun Yi could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, he’s probably a martial genius that came from Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma, carrying Empyrean Flutterfeather’s signboard and coming to Cloudpill Summit to bluff and swindle people. It’s just a shame that he made the wrong calculations!”

The moment Zheng Buqun heard, his face could not help revealing a look of great joy as he said, “Is Brother Yun Yi taking action?”

Yun Yi waved his hand and said, “Do you think that the Cloudpill Summit’s grandmaster tokens are all for show? As long as one comes with a grandmaster token, those are all the Cloudpill Summit’s most noble guests. We must treat them with courtesy.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Hearing this, everyone had disappointed looks.

Those present were all alchemy geniuses, so how could they stand a martial arts genius riding on top of their heads and flaunting his prowess?

Moreover, slapping the face of a grandmaster was also something very delightful.

But him holding a grandmaster token was like holding an imperial sword; you could not do anything about it!

“Brother Yun Yi, could it be that there’s no other way?”

“Yeah, a little brat also dares proclaim to be the number one alchemy genius, is his hair fully grown?”

“Could it be that at this Cloudpill Summit, we have to keep on watching him continue to be arrogant?”

...

The alchemy geniuses present were all filled with righteous indignation, faces revealing indignant expressions.

But they saw Yun Yi’s face reveal a hint of a ruminating smile and said coolly, “My Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital is the number one holy land of the Southern Border Alchemy Dao. How can we allow such a person to exist? So what if it’s the grandmaster token? People who hold a position without qualifications are absolutely not allowed to stay and humiliate the Cloudpill Summit.”

When everyone heard that, they all revealed knowing smiles.

...

What Empyrean Flutterfeather said was right. The Cloudpill Summit indeed did not let Ye Yuan down.

These few days, Ye Yuan brought Ning Siyu along and bought many rare rank six spirit medicines.

The places that Ye Yuan liked to shop the most were some big and small marketplaces.

At those places, one could frequently pick up some pretty good spirit medicines.

These marketplaces had every strange and peculiar thing. There were even quite a few obscure pill formulas.

Although the Myriad Treasure Tower’s power and influence were tremendous, they also could not get every single spirit medicine. This Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital gathered the entire Southern Border’s top alchemists. It naturally could not come into existence without people who came to do business.

With countless alchemy powerhouses gathering in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital, this kind of business opportunity naturally could not be missed.

At this time, Ye Yuan two people were currently strolling idly in the eastern-street marketplaces, but then they heard a wave of discussions.

“Did you guys hear? A True God Realm grandmaster actually came to the Cloudpill Summit this time. It already raised a huge uproar in the entire city.”

“What? Six-star Alchemy God grandmaster? You aren’t joking, right? This bit of strength can’t even compare to me. Yet, he e also dares to be a grandmaster?”

“Heh heh, I heard that he came from some Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda. It was probably applying pressure on the grandmasters through the Heavenly Emperor, and that’s how the grandmaster token was given.”

“This is also treating things too trivially! The Cloudpill Summit is the Southern Border’s grandest event. It’s also not what one or two Heavenly Emperors can influence!”

“Wait and see! The grandmaster token isn’t so easy to get! That punk will definitely make a big spectacle of himself when the time comes!”

...

Hearing everyone’s discussions, Ning Siyu used a peculiar expression to look at Ye Yuan and discovered that Ye Yuan was expressionless like they were not talking about him at all.

Ning Siyu sometimes suspected whether or not an old monster’s soul lived inside Ye Yuan’s body.

This guy was also too capable of keeping his cool.

“Your Excellency, if I were you, I’d show my skill for them to see. I’ll let them know that you’re worthy of this grandmaster token!” Ning Siyu said indignantly.

In reality, they could hear this sort of discussion everywhere these few days. He already became the greatest topic of conversation for the alchemists in the city.

There were even quite a number of people who put out the word that they wanted to challenge this grandmaster and trample him underfoot.

It was just that they did not know that that so-called Six-star grandmaster was beside them.

Clearly, this Six-star grandmaster already became the stepping stone for these Six-star Alchemy Gods to make a name for themselves.

One had to know, defeating a grandmaster, what sublime glory that would be!

Ye Yuan just smiled. He did not speak.

Reaching his present realm, Ye Yuan had long already passed the time of seeking to prevail over others.

Those able to enter his arcane sights were only peak-existence big shots like Empyrean Flutterfeather.

Was there any meaning to contend with a bunch of rookies over this?

The two people were currently talking when a group of people suddenly rushed over in a haste, directly surrounding the two people in the middle.

Ning Siyu’s face changed and she said, “What do you guys want to do?”

A young man bowed in salute towards Ye Yuan and said, “I’m Qiannan Great Imperial Capital’s Luo Yue. I want to ask Grandmaster Ye to give a pointer or two.”

“I’m Eastpride’s Wu Family’s Wu Zhan. I have some confusion in alchemy and want to ask Grandmaster Ye to resolve them.”

“I’m ...”

...

With a rush, these young geniuses all reported their backgrounds, all identifying Ye Yuan by name and making Ye Yuan give pointers.

Of course, giving pointers was fake, challenging was real.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s identity was exalted, so they could not very well say explicitly.

But their eyes did not have any intention of seeking guidance at all. The flavor of provocation was thick.

The actions of these young geniuses made the eastern-street marketplace burst into an uproar.

They all used extremely surprised gazes to look at Ye Yuan. They did not expect that he was that Six-star grandmaster!

“Goodness gracious, he’s that Six-star grandmaster? This is also too young! Looking at the age, he’s probably also just a thousand over years old, right?”

“Terrific lads! Every one of these young geniuses, all have deep backgrounds! Qiannan Great Imperial Capital, Wu Family, each one is an alchemy holy land. Behind them are all Seven-star Alchemy God existences.”

“Heh heh, there’s a good show to watch now! I’m really very curious what this lad relied on to get the grandmaster token!”

...

After exclaiming, everyone all had gloating expressions.

Especially after seeing Ye Yuan’s age, they were even more indignant and discontented. This kind of age, how could he be worthy of the grandmaster token?

They did not feel that they were worthy of the grandmaster token. But past grandmasters were all god-like figures. Ye Yuan holding this token, they felt that it sullied its meaning.

There were likely 20 over young geniuses present. They were all Six-star Alchemy Gods.

Ye Yuan swept through with an amused look and said smilingly, “You all ... want to challenge me?”

Luo Yue smiled coldly and said, “Since Grandmaster Ye took the grandmaster token, then you’re naturally a heavenly figure. It’s just ... don’t know if you dare to accept our challenge or not?”

Luo Yue was intentionally using the grandmaster token to force Ye Yuan. If Ye Yuan dared to avoid the battle in broad daylight, they want to see what face he still has to use the grandmaster token to bluff people.

Ye Yuan’s expression did not change as he said coolly, “You already said that I’m a heavenly figure. How are you all, these mortals ... worthy of challenging me?”

Luo Yue laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “You really went along with it! You don’t even dare to accept our challenge, don’t you find it scalding to hold the grandmaster token?”

Ye Yuan’s face was not red and his heart did not race as he said coolly, “It’s also not that you guys can’t challenge me, but ...”

The eyes of Luo Ye and the rest lit up, revealing smiles of their plan succeeding.
