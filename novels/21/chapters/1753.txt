Chapter 1757 This Priest Is a Little Impressive

“Elder Li, I have a question!”

On the high platform, an old man was currently giving a sermon to a group of priests when someone below the stage suddenly stood up to say.

The priests below the stage were no less than a hundred people. At this time, gazes looked over in unison.

This person was wearing a priest’s long robe, four stars hanging on his chest. Who was it if not Ye Yuan?

Seeing this scene, the faces of all the priests revealed knowing smiles.

The scalp of the Elder Li on the stage tingled and he waved his hand and said, “If there are any questions, wait until after the sermon before asking, don’t need to say anymore right now.”

These few years, Ye Yuan already became the most troublesome ‘problem student’ of all the elders.

Practically during each sermon, Ye Yuan would interrupt many times to raise his doubts.

When it was many, it even reached more than 10 or 20 times!

If it was just causing trouble, these elders giving sermons would just fling a slap over.

But the problem was, each time Ye Yuan raised his doubts, it was all very reasonable!

Each time would stump the elders until they were left tongue-tied.

In the beginning, there were still some elders who were unconvinced and started intense arguments with Ye Yuan.

But in the end, they were all disputed until rendered speechless by Ye Yuan.

With a few incidents, when these elders were giving sermons, they were afraid that Ye Yuan would be present.

As long as they saw Ye Yuan, they would be like mice seeing a cat, hearts drumming away.

Ye Yuan completely ignored Elder Li and asked without caring, “Zi Shou Long Qin Pill has a neutral temperament. When refining it, one should control the temperature, basing the Five Elements Rules inside the spirit medicines as the foundation ... Elder Li, don’t you think this should be the case?”

Ye Yuan’s talking speed was very fast, pointing out the problems in the sermon that Elder Li talked about just now.

When the other priests heard Ye Yuan’s words, they all revealed thoughtful expressions.

These priests all had their experiences too. At the start, they were all harboring the mentality of watching the show, watching Ye Yuan argue with the elders.

But later on, they discovered that what Ye Yuan said was indeed very reasonable.

After going back and experimenting, the quality of the medicinal pills really improved significantly.

Hence, later on, as long as Ye Yuan opened his mouth, they would give their full attention to the lecture, and benefited a great deal instead.

Elder Li said furiously, “Ye Yuan! Are you the elder, or am I the elder?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course you’re the elder!”

Elder Li snorted coldly and said, “You still know that I’m the elder? I’m preaching and you’re causing trouble. Where’s the sense of propriety?”

But Ye Yuan said, “Elder Li, can’t say it like that. The more truth is debated, the clearer it gets. Since there’s a problem, I naturally have to point it out. Could it be that you wish to let everyone go refine pills according to the wrong method?”

Elder Li was angered until his face was livid and he said angrily, “Why don’t you come and preach to them then?”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a smile, “I don’t have that ability! I came to learn and casually raised his own questions. Haha, Elder Li, you continue!”

Elder Li finally could not hold back and flicked his sleeves grandly and said, “Not preaching anymore!”

Finished talking, he left in a huff.

Putting on the priest robes, Ye Yuan started his days of learning demon divine pills in the Priest Temple’s halls.

Even though he was very worried about White Light in his heart, he also knew that he could only wait right now.

And Ye Yuan’s capital to gain a foothold in the Priest Temple was Alchemy Dao. Hence, he urgently needed to increase his strength currently.

First time entering the Tianlu Pavilion, Ye Yuan learned a lot of knowledge about demon divine pills.

But the refinement of demon divine pills, Ye Yuan still lacked a great deal.

Hence, he was absorbing knowledge frenziedly every day right now.

Ye Yuan was naturally not deliberately making trouble. But these elders preaching on Dao, the areas that they missed out were too many.

Ye Yuan posing his own queries was also within reason.

It was just that some of his questions were too tricky. Even those elders could not answer them too, so it was easy to anger the other party.

“Ye Yuan, you’re quite capable! Now that you angered Elder Li away, are you happy?”

At this time, one of the priests stood up to question Ye Yuan. Who was it if not Chi Feng?

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “Then you say, was I right or not?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Chi Feng could not help choking when he heard that. Ye Yuan said it very reasonably, he could not refute at all.

If it could be refuted, Elder Li also could not leave in a rage.

Even Elder Li could not do it, he, Chi Feng, naturally could not even more!

“Humph! Even if what you said was reasonable, you also have to pay attention to the ways and means! You screwing like this, everyone doesn’t get to learn anymore!” Chi Feng said with a cold smile.

Sure enough, with him instigating, the other people’s unhappy emotions all came out.

Although Ye Yuan’s words were reasonable, now that even the elder was angered away, who would still come and preach to them in the future?

This way, wouldn’t Ye Yuan become a plague god?

“Ye Yuan, you’re a genius, we’re all mediocre, alright?”

“You’re capable, don’t come and listen to the elders preach together with us!”

“Now that the elder left, are you going to come and preach to us?”

...

Everyone clamored to get a word in, all expressing dissatisfaction towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Uh, if it’s just up to Elder Li’s standard, it’s also not impossible for me to preach to you guys!”

One sentence made everyone stare dumbfounded with their mouths agape.

This guy was bragging, right?

The moment Chi Feng heard, he smiled coldly and said, “Alright then, you try preaching! Everyone, all come and listen to whether or not our temple’s number one genius can spout about some profound things!”

Some shallow truths, everyone naturally all knew.

Even if there was a gap between those sitting here, it also would not be too ridiculous.

Therefore, Chi Feng completely did not believe that Ye Yuan could spout out some profound things.

Being able to raise questions did not mean being able to preach to everyone!

They were all Four-star priests, who could be much better than anyone?!

Ye Yuan smiled, walked up the high platform, and said in a clear voice, “Then next, I’ll carry on talking from the place Elder Li stopped just now ...”

Hence, Ye Yuan started to speak eloquently without ceasing.

At the start, everyone’s faces all revealed disdain.

But the more he said, the more serious the expressions on everyone’s faces got.

They finally knew that Ye Yuan was not joking around!

The things that Ye Yuan said were even clearer and easier to understand than Elder Li, and he also went straight to the point.

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s understanding of the Zi Shou Long Qin Pill was far from what they could compare to.

Even though Ye Yuan’s refinement of demon divine pills was still lacking, to talk about the understanding of pill formulas, 100 Elder Lis could not catch up to him even by whipping their horses.

Moreover, medicinal pills of level four difficulty were still nothing in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Otherwise, he also would not have refined a peak superior-grade Baqi Leiyin Pill so easily.

It was just that some specifics of the refining methods, as well as proficiency and specific application areas of demonic attraction art, Ye Yuan was still lacking in some level of skill.

What was truly difficult were level seven and above medicinal pills!

The group of priests was wholly enraptured listening. Their eyes became brighter and brighter. Clearly, they all had considerable gains.

Even Chi Feng had long already forgotten to look at the joke too. He was focused on Ye Yuan’s preaching.

“Uh, that’s about it. These are some of the easy to fall into mistake areas that I sorted out myself. As long as you all practice hard, you should be able to increase the grade of the medicinal pills considerably,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.
