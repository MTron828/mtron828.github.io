Chapter 2230: Three Great Blood Pools!

“Eh, Mo Sha, you’re actually not dead yet! That human powerhouse let you go just like that? Where is he?”

Heavenly corpse Mo Sha did not leave, he really wanted to see what kind of confidence this human had to dare invade a Heavenly Emperor’s manor.

At this time, quite a few people also came after hearing the news. Seeing that Mo Sha was actually not dead, they could not help feeling surprised.

They even thought that Ye Yuan killed him long ago.

Mo Sha’s deadpan face squeezed out a trace of an ugly smile and said, “He went in!”

“Went in? He wouldn’t have ... entered just like this to ask for people, right? Huhu, when was Yin Huai Manor so easy to enter?”

Mo Sha smiled bitterly again and said, “He killed his way inside!”

“Puhwark!”

The few Ghost Dao powerhouses by the side directly spat out. One of them said, “Killed his way in? This human brat’s brain wouldn’t be spoiled, right?”

“Huhu, he was so cocky just now. Right now, I reckon that he’s already being divided up and eaten by Empyrean Chi Jue they all, right?”

“Even if he’s a peak Empyrean, forcefully barging into Yin Huai Manor is also a one-way ticket to ... C-Came out!”

This Ghost Dao powerhouse’s words were said halfway when he opened his mouth wide, looking at Yin Huai Manor’s gates with incredible shock.

The rest had doubtful faces. Turning their heads and looking, they were instantly dumbfounded on the spot.

It was only to see a human and a ghost, one in front and one at the back, strutting out of Yin Huai Manor’s front door!

They even saw some Empyrean powerhouses that they normally would not come into contact with at the back, watching the two people leave like sending away the god of plague.

Seeing Ye Yuan bringing Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade away, those Empyreans let out a long sigh in relief.

Outside, the ghosts had shocked faces, not understanding the situation. But they felt that it was very impressive.

That Ghost Dao powerhouse who was speaking earlier said stammeringly, “C-Came out just like that?”

“No way, right? Could it be that this human kid is a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse?”

Mo Sha stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, shook his head, and said, “No, he’s just an Empyrean! But how could an Empyrean bring Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade away? Could it be that ... Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge watched him act unbridledly just like that?”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge naturally would not watch Ye Yuan act presumptuously. But making the Yin Huai Manor suffer heavy losses for a measly little Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade was not worth it.

Hence, he still compromised in the end.

.After all, Ye Yuan gave him face too

Although this face was somewhat unpleasant.

Following behind Ye Yuan, titanic waves surged in Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade’s heart.

When he saw Ye Yuan in the Immortal Grove World, Ye Yuan was still only at the Celestial Deity Realm.

At that time, the small and weak Ye Yuan still needed him, this Ghost Empyrean’s protection.

But now, only a thousand over years passed, Ye Yuan brought him, this captive prisoner, out from a Heavenly Emperor’s manor.

What was even more terrifying was that when he was brought out, he even saw Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge!

At that time, Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge’s expression was really fascinating to the extreme.

Then, Ye Yuan brought him away in front of Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge’s face.

Before he left, Ye Yuan even said, “Thank you for Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge’s face.”

What the hell was that?

If that Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge was not around, then it was still alright.

Yet, Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge was still around!

Furthermore, looking at the situation, Yin Huai Manor had just experienced a great battle.

Then ... how in the world did Ye Yuan do it?

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade understood that no matter how Ye Yuan did it, this young man in front of him was no longer that kid who sought protection under his wings back then anymore!

The two people had just walked several streets when suddenly, a bunch of ghosts and monsters rushed over head-on.

When they saw the Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade behind Ye Yuan, they were immediately frozen on the spot.

“Wild Blade, how ... how did you come out?” When a Ghost Dao Empyrean in the lead saw Wild Blade, he had an expression like a ghost had seen a ghost; very fascinating.

Wild Blade’s face revealed a moved look and said smilingly, “You Fang, it’s Young Lord who rescued me.”

Empyrean You Fang’s eyes landed on Ye Yuan’s body and he said in surprise, “Young Lord? It’s this kid? Didn’t you say that your young lord was a Celestial Deity Realm? Just based on him, he can rescue you out of Yin Huai Manor’s ghost prison?”

Wild Blade’s face fell slightly, and he said, “You Fang, don’t be impudent! Young Lord is no longer that weak youth long ago, he’s currently already an Empyrean powerhouse! Even Heavenly Emperor Ghostridge is somewhat afraid of him!”

Empyrean You Fang had a look of disbelief, sizing Ye Yuan up and down.

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered to be long-winded with them and said coolly, “Wild Blade, go!”

“Yes, Young Master!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Wild Blade answered and left with Ye Yuan.

Arriving at Wild Blade’s residence, Ye Yuan directly opened his mouth and said, “Wild Blade, do you know where in Shinra Ghost Region has Silvernet Blood Essence?”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade said in surprise, “Silvernet Blood Essence is an extremely precious rank eight natural treasure. It’s also very rare in Shinra Ghost Region. What does Young Lord want it for?”

Ye Yuan said, “The Soul Suppressing Pearl is seriously damaged. Dustless fell into a slumber. I urgently need the Silvernet Blood Essence to let Dustless recover his strength!”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade turned pale with fright and said, “What? Lord Dustless he ... he’s so strong! Who could send him into a slumber? Could it be ... a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse?”

In my memories, Dustless’s might left no room for doubt.

A Heavenly Emperor not emerging, no one could do anything to him at all.

It was just that Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade did not know that the Soul Suppressing Pearl had long already reached the level of a heavenly emperor spirit treasure. Dustless’ strength advanced even further than before.

Ye Yuan just nodded his head and did not say anything.

Nineorigin was not just a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse so simple.

That was a supreme existence that could forcefully contend with Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperors!

Recovering from his shock, Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade frowned and said, “Silvernet Blood Essence is a great tonic item to divine soul type powerhouses. When each piece of Silvernet Blood Essence comes into being, it will attract Heavenly Emperor powerhouses to take action. There will even be situations where some Heavenly Emperors being killed because of the battles for the Silvernet Blood Essence. In the course of time, the majority of them are controlled in the hands of middle-stage Heavenly Emperors, maybe even those above them.”

Ye Yuan listened until his brows furrowed tightly too.

He knew that Silvernet Blood Essence was very popular, but he did not expect that it was actually popular to this extent.

Snatching a Silvernet Blood Essence from the hands of a middle-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, it could not be done, unless he was tired of living.

“Is there no other way?” Ye Yuan frowned and said.

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade said with difficulty, “There is a way, but it’s also extremely dangerous. This Silvernet Blood Essence is produced in Shinra Ghost Region’s three great blood pools! The three great blood pools are respectively Hell Blood Pool, Extinction Blood Pool, as well as Asura Blood Pool! Legends have it that the three great blood pools were gathered and formed by the blood of ancient supreme powerhouses. Not only is there massive resentment, but there are also remnant souls of supreme powerhouses appearing and disappearing from time to time. Of course, this place is also a superb cultivation land for Ghost Dao powerhouses. There will be countless Ghost Dao powerhouses and corpse path powerhouses being there all year round. In there, there will be many Empyrean powerhouses breaking through every year, but also many Empyrean powerhouses dying! Some Heavenly Emperor powerhouses also never come back after entering the depths!”

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath. Sure enough, this Silvernet Blood Essence was an extremely troublesome thing!

But no matter how troublesome, he had to go too.

His time was very tight. He already could not afford to dawdle.

At this rate, Dustless and Mu Lingxue would both be in danger.

His gaze turned intent and he said, “Where’s the nearest blood pool from here!”

Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade was startled inwardly, knowing that Ye Yuan already resolved himself. He then said, “Asura Blood Pool!”
