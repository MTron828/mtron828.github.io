Chapter 2751: Fourth Form, Counterattack!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Insurmountable opponent? Huhu, you’re thinking too highly of yourself!” Ye Yuan said with a light laugh.

Qiu Chen looked at Ye Yuan coolly and said, “The pride of a weakling doesn’t have the slightest use. Even if you don’t admit it, it’s impossible for you to last more than 20 moves in my hands. This is an undeniable fact!”

“Is that so? Then watch closely!”

As he said, Ye Yuan sat down cross-legged and instantly entered a meditative state.

Qiu Chen curled his mouth and turned his nose up at this.

It was not just him. Saint Exalt Purplesun and the rest who were by the side also could not help shaking their heads.

They acknowledged that Ye Yuan was peerlessly talented.

But, compared to this one in front of him, he was still far too lacking.

Saying this sort of words at this time did not have the slightest meaning apart from puffing himself up at his own cost.

Saying ruthless words if you had the strength, that was called a counterattack.

Saying ruthless words if you did not have the strength, that was called keeping up appearance to cover up the predicament.

Clearly, the current Ye Yuan belonged to the latter.

But this time, Ye Yuan was not in a hurry to regulate his breathing.

Around him, three kinds of rule power were gradually spreading out, converging, and combining.

A bud broke out of the ground in front of Ye Yuan.

The bud grew up at a speed visible to the naked eye and germinated very quickly, growing into a sapling.

Qiu Chen was the first to discover the anomaly and his brows could not help knitting together tightly.

Saint Sovereign Purplesun and the rest of the Saint Sovereign Heavens also gradually detected the unusualness.

The power of rule around Ye Yuan was currently growing strongly as if continuous heavy rain nourishing the sapling to grow.

“Could it be ...” Saint Exalt Purplesun’s pupils constricted slightly as he said.

As if affirming his guess, the sapling continued growing and became a half-human height small tree.

This was the third form!

Many tender green branches grew on the young tree.

Very soon, the power of rule around Ye Yuan reached a bottleneck.

The young tree sapling also stopped growing. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone knew that Ye Yuan reached the final juncture of breakthrough.

“Shatter!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan roared, his eyes snapping open. His aura suddenly skyrocketed.

Sword, Formation, Space, three great power of rules, they seemed to have breached the floodgate all of a sudden, flooding out frantically.

The three power of rules broke through to the fourth level at the same time!

Saint Exalt Purplesun’s entire body trembled and he cried out in surprise, “Really broke through! Furthermore, it’s three great rules breaking the walls at the same time! It’s just that, the fusion of the fourth level of rule power ...”

Rule power breakthrough was one thing.

Fusion was another thing.

After breaking through, the balance of Great Dao Transformation was broken and needed to be fused anew.

In Sublime Realm, the power of rules was far from as powerful as Sovereign Realm. Fusing it was relatively easier.

But, reaching Sovereign Realm, the difficulty of fusion was not an ordinary kind of hard.

But the three great power of rules circled around Ye Yuan rapidly, forming a large-scale grinding disc.

That grinding disc linked the three great rules from end to end and started spinning.

The small tree that had originally stopped growing started growing wildly again.

This time, the young tree grew very crazily.

Very soon, it grew to a human height small tree.

The branches also gradually grew out and the tree leaves became lush.

“This ... It fused?” Saint Exalt Purplesun stared dumbfoundedly.

“How on earth did this guy do it? This talent is also too monstrous!” Saint Exalt Skyfortune swallowed his saliva and said.

They were still looking down on Ye Yuan earlier. But in a blink of an eye, they had their faces slapped.

Not only did Ye Yuan not crumble under Qiu Chen’s powerful pressure, but he also broke the fourth level barrier instead and broke through.

Breaking through was fine, Ye Yuan even fused it right away

“He didn’t comprehend the rules one at a time, but he comprehended three together! This kind of comprehension method, the difficulty is more than a hundred times of comprehending three independently on their own! But the advantage is that once he broke through, he can fuse it right away and reach the transformed fourth state!” Qiu Chen suddenly opened his mouth at this time and said.

Everyone was extremely shocked when they heard.

Comprehending three at the same time, what kind of monstrous comprehension ability was this!

What was even more frightening was that this guy’s comprehension speed was also too fast.

In just a short half a month, this guy actually broke through to the fourth form already!

Finished fusing, Ye Yuan slowly stood up. The All-Encompassing Sacred Tree’s fourth form immediately turned into one flying sword after another and revolved around Ye Yuan.

The fourth form, the flying swords that Ye Yuan was able to control directly rose to 108!

Furthermore, the power of each flying sword rivaled heavenly spirit treasures too!

At this time, his essence, energy, and spirit, immediately rose to the peak.

Qiu Chen looked at him and said coolly, “Even if you broke through to the fourth form, you’re not my match either.”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and similarly said coolly, “So what? You’re merely my sparring opponent, that’s all. I’ll eventually surpass you!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan guided with his divine essence, 108 flying swords charged toward Qiu Chen in an instant.

At this time, the power of the sword formation increased more than ten times compared to just now!

Even Qiu Chen’s face revealed a solemn look too.

Only to see his palm tense up, five flying knives shot out fiercely and clashed together with Ye Yuan’s 108 flying swords.

This time, Qiu Chen was going all out!

This was also the powerful aspect of the Labyrinth Divine Palace!

The opponent of this training ground was highly intelligent. They would attack according to the opponent’s strength.

Actually, it was more like guiding and sparring with the younger generation.

It was just that Purplesun and the rest were seriously too weak. Hence, they were unable to force out all of the heaven’s chosen’s strength at all.

Otherwise, with the strength of these heaven’s chosen, Purplesun they all would have long died.

This battle was clearly fought much more trepidatiously.

Both sides fought all the way beyond a hundred moves before Qiu Chen breached Ye Yuan’s sword formation with his flying knives and defeated Ye Yuan.

This was absolutely a huge improvement.

Before this, Ye Yuan did not even make it past 20 moves.

However, this was just the beginning.

Having just broken through, Ye Yuan’s application of the fourth form and his control over the sword formation had not been mastered to the extent of perfection yet.

Hence, he continued challenging Qiu Chen over and over again.

From a hundred moves, fighting until 200 moves, then onto 500 moves!

Both sides’ battle became more and more tense.

Purplesun and the rest wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into as they watched by the side.

This improvement was really too fast!

Ye Yuan’s improvement speed was like a straight line; it would never turn a corner!

Three months later, Ye Yuan fought Qiu Chen again!

After more than 300 moves, a streak of sword light that Ye Yuan controlled broke through the blockade of the five flying knives bizarrely and pierced right through Qiu Chen.

Ye Yuan won!

Ye Yuan looked at Qiu Chen and said with a smile, “Insurmountable opponent, I’ve surpassed you today!”

Qiu Chen’s haughty face seemed a little sullenly angry.

The words that he said more than three months ago, he had his face ruthlessly slapped at this moment!

What was even more aggravating was that Ye Yuan’s current fourth form had merely just reached the realm of minor accomplishment.

While his five laws transformation was already perfected!

Which was also to say that it was actually equivalent to Ye Yuan jumping realms and defeating him.

His pride was completely crushed at this moment.

Three months ago, Ye Yuan was still a weakling that could not last more than 20 moves at his hands.

Three months later, Ye Yuan already thoroughly completed the outperforming.

In Jade Sovereign Heaven this realm, he was no longer Ye Yuan’s match!

Purplesun and Skyfortune and the rest exchanged glances, shocked until it was incapable of increasing further.

This also meant that as long as Ye Yuan reached grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven, his combat power would no longer be inferior to theirs!
