Chapter 1452 Wang Song in Despair

“So strong! What happened just now? I only felt a blur before my eyes and Jia Chong exploded!”

“That Jia Chong is Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm too. Furthermore, he was even this season’s runner-up. Why is the disparity from him so great?”

“There was no news about Ye Yuan in these ten years. I didn’t expect that the moment he came back, his strength became even more terrifying.”

“But even if his strength is very powerful, it’s impossible to be Wang Song’s match too, right? After all, Wang Song is also an inner-court’s genius. Furthermore, he’s already late-stage Heaven Glimpse, two minor realms higher than Ye Yuan!”

...

The Clearwind Inn’s business was excellent. Ye Yuan’s punch blew up the door, causing such a great commotion. It naturally drew a large group of people to surround and watch.

Over there, Gui Yun battled three mighty grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouses alone by himself and actually did not fall into a disadvantage in the slightest, making everyone click their tongues in wonder.

The four people’s great battle already turned the entire box room upside down, blowing up a corner of the Clearwind inn.

“Heh, you don’t think that you’re my match by killing a good-for-nothing, right? Punk, you came to seek death yourself today. Just nice, we’ll settle old grudges and new enmity together! Wang Su, Big Brother is going to avenge you today!”

Talking until the end, Wang Song gnashed his teeth in hatred.

Wang Su’s death had always been pressing on his heart, making him unable to get over it.

The last time he wanted to kill Ye Yuan, it was forcefully stopped by Xiao Feng.

This time, Ye Yuan delivered himself to the door, just as he wished!

“Taiyi True Dipper Fist! Die for me!”

Wang Song shouted fiercely, giving no chance to explain, directly smashing a fist over toward Ye Yuan.

The powerful fist wind made everyone exclaim in shock.

“This fist intent has clearly already reached the Fist Dao third-layered heaven!”

“The Taiyi True Dipper Fist is an academy supreme skill in the first place. Wang Song also cultivated this move to Fist Dao third-layered heaven, how to fight still?”

“This Ye Yuan is too impulsive. This bit of strength and he dared to come and challenge Wang Song!”

“Heaven Glimpse Realm can’t compare to Grotto Profound Realm. The difficulty of jumping realms to battle is too great.”

...

The higher the realm, the greater the difficulty of jumping realms to battle.

Moreover, it was even leaping across two minor realms!

If the difficulty of jumping realms in Grotto Profound Realm was 10 points, then the difficulty of Heaven Glimpse Realm jumping realms was 50 points, even 80 points!

Although Wang Song was not considered top-notch in the inner-court, he was a first-rate genius too.

His strength was not considered weak.

For Ye Yuan to want to leap two minor realms to defeat him was too difficult.

However, Ye Yuan did not have any visible change in countenance regarding this punch of Wang Song’s.

When his fist wind condensed and formed, and rumbled over towards him, only then, did Ye Yuan slowly raise the Evil Extermination Sword.

“Sundering Stars!”

A light sound of tearing through the air happened in a flash, colliding together with the Taiyi True Dipper Fist’s fist wind.

Boom!

It was only to see Wang Song’s figure like a cannonball, directly flying toward the house opposite the street.

Wang Song smashed through several walls before gradually stopping his figure.

Everyone was dumbfounded!

How could this Ye Yuan be so strong?

This move of Ye Yuan’s, everyone could not fathom its actual situation at all.

An ordinary and plain slash, looking like it did not have any power at all. Even the spiritual energy did not have any undulation.

But the power was so formidable!

For the first time, it was the appearance of the complete version Sundering Stars in the Heavenspan World.

Previously when Ye Yuan used this move, he slew a Heaven Glimpse powerhouse while being at the Grotto Profound Realm.

Now, Ye Yuan broke through to initial-stage Heaven Glimpse. This power of this move could not be compared even more.

Defeating Wang Song in one move was nothing remarkable.

In reality, his Chasing Moon move was not unleashed yet.

“Real or fake? Initial-stage Heaven Glimpse and he can trash late-stage Heaven Glimpse. This strength is also too frightening, right?”

“Everyone said that Ye Yuan’s talent surpassed Qin Tian’s. Previously, I didn’t believe it. Now, I really believe it!”

“This is too monstrous! That sword, I completely could not fathom at all! To actually have such formidable power, how did he do it?”

...

Ye Yuan’s strength could not be estimated with his realm on the surface at all.

His Chaos Heavenspan Canon coupled with the Chaos Heaven Opening Sword Art, just how much potential he had, only his opponent could experience it.

Now, Wang Song experienced it.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, an afterimage dashed out of the wall, speeding over in the direction of Wu Meng Academy with incredible speed.

This scene was too unexpected. Everyone all did not react to it.

“Puhwark!”

As he fled, Wang Song vomited blood in large mouthfuls.

At this time, how could he still care about the injuries on his body? He even used every last ounce of strength, the goal was Wu Meng Academy!

As long as he could escape into Wu Meng Academy, Ye Yuan would not dare to kill him anymore.

“Too strong! How can this guy be so strong? He’s just initial-stage Heaven Glimpse! Back then, when Qin Tian broke through to initial-stage Heaven Glimpse, he could contend with middle-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouses. But it’s merely just contending with! But Ye Yuan, he really ...”

Monstrous waves surged in Wang Song’s heart. He was really unable to imagine that Ye Yuan after breaking through to Heaven Glimpse Realm was actually terrifying to this kind of degree.

In his heart, there was still half a sentence that had not been said.

With Ye Yuan’s current strength, killing him was really like killing a dog!

Wang Song fled desperately. He stimulated the exertion of his body to the limit.

At this very moment, he wished that his parents gave him an extra pair of legs, or gave him a pair of pairs. He wanted to fly into the Wu Meng Academy!

Fly ...

Suddenly, a figure dropped from the sky ahead, flying ... in front of him.

An emotion called despair instantly filled his entire body.

How could he forget that Ye Yuan knew sword maneuvering flight?!

“Sword maneuvering flight! It’s really sword maneuvering flight! All along I heard that Ye Yuan knew sword maneuvering flight, but I have never seen it before with my own eyes. Today, it really broadened my horizons!”

“With this, Wang Song is screwed! Wonder if Ye Yuan will really kill him or not. Behind Wang Song is the Qin Family and Wang Family, two great families.”

“Heh, what do you think? Qin Peiyu that little girl, Ye Yuan killed without even batting an eye. Do you think that he’ll let Wang Song off?”

...

Thud!

Wang Song directly knelt down, weeping until tears cascaded down.

“Lord Ye, Grandpa Ye, I was wrong! I was really wrong! This matter was all instigated by Qin Zheng and Qin Pei, and Lin Xiu is an accomplice! It really has nothing to do with me!”

A matter of life and death, how could Wang Song still have any moral integrity? With an inordinately crying manner, he betrayed Qin Zheng and Qin Pei.

Ye Yuan just sneered when he heard that and said, “Wang Song, I’ve already given you the chance, it’s you who challenged my bottom line time and again! Now, you can go to hell!”

“Puhwark!”

Sundering Stars tore through the air and arrived. Wang Song was the same as Jia Chong, directly exploding into a cloud of blood mist.

On the streets, everyone all looked at this scene with immense shock.

Today, Ye Yuan was probably going to poke a hole in the sky!

Killing Wang Song, Ye Yuan did not stay, directly riding his sword and going to Clearwind Inn again.

Gui Yun and the three people were currently in the midst of fierce fighting and already fought from the Clearwind Inn onto the streets. Everyone all clamored to give a wide berth.

Lin Xiu’s strength was indeed very formidable, already forcing Gui Yun to use ghost energy possession, before barely managing to fight to a draw with the three people.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, figure charging out like lightning, going straight for Qin Pei!
