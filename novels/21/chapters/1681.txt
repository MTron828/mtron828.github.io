Chapter 1685 Power of Chaos

“I ... I’m not too sure either, I just feel that I seem to have touched something. Maybe ... I can already break through to become a half-step Celestial Deity.”

As the two medicinal pills gradually melted, there seemed to be some mysterious thing that fused into his body, making him have a feeling of sudden epiphany. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zheng Qi had already stopped at the ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord Realm for several thousand years, failing to touch the threshold of Celestial Deity Realm.

This step was too difficult for ninth-layered heaven Divine Lords!

Zheng Qi never dreamed that at his most hopeless, Ye Yuan’s two medicinal pills let him touch this threshold.

Forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart, Coldfeather said, “The opportunity can’t be missed! You must go into seclusion properly! Your injuries are already 50%-60% recovered. So you already don’t need my help anymore.”

Zheng Qi nodded his head and continued to close his eyes and refine the medicinal pills, while Coldfeather quietly backed out of the hidden chamber.

Exiting the hidden chamber, Coldfeather went straight for Ye Yuan. He wanted to figure out just what mystery was in Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills.

At this time, Ye Yuan and Xuan Yu were currently chatting.

Xuan Yu looked at Ye Yuan and said with a bitter smile, “Ning Zhiyuan is at any rate the head of a family. Are you really not going to give him face like this?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Face is earned by one’s self, not given by others. This Ye isn’t someone who is extremely petty, but I also detest people who kick others when they are down. If not looking on the account of Ning Tianping’s face, even if he stood guard at the door for a lifetime, I won’t meet him either.”

Xuan Yu let out a sigh and said, “Among the numerous family clans in the imperial city, actually, the Ning Family received the greatest favor from you back then. I didn’t expect that he did such a thing at the elders meeting. It indeed chills people’s hearts. Forget it, just a Ning Family. With your current strength, even those two upstairs also have to do things according to your mood.”

Just as they were talking, Coldfeather rushed over in a hurry. Upon seeing Ye Yuan, he asked, “Ye Yuan, what mystery is in your medicinal pills? Why is Zheng Qi actually going to breakthrough after refining it?”

The moment Xuan Yu heard, he looked at Ye Yuan with a face full of shock.

Those two medicinal pills, he was all too clear. How could it possibly help Zheng Qi breaking through?

Could it be that ... Coldfeather made a mistake?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “These few years, I have some comprehensions toward medicinal pills again. I discovered that refining pills according to this kind of method will let the medicinal pill produce some change. I didn’t expect that it can actually help Brother Zheng to break through. It’s also considered an unexpected surprise.”

When Xuan Yu and Coldfeather heard that, their entire bodies trembled violently. Divine-grade medicinal pills were already extremely impressive. Coupled with this kind of change, the medicinal pills refined were simply priceless treasures!

Actually, Ye Yuan had long discovered that ever since breaking through to the Divine Vortex Realm, his divine essence seemed to have some changes.

It actually produced a sort of mysterious power!

Regardless of whether it was using martial techniques or refining pills, there would be a very large degree of amplification.

Even though Ye Yuan broke through to rank four, he did not have world power. But he had this kind of mysterious power.

Ye Yuan called it ... the power of chaos!

He could feel that chaos power seemed to be even more profound and mysterious than world power.

Very clearly, having this chaos power, not only would Ye Yuan’s strength be no weaker than those at the Divine Lord Realm, it would also be a magnitude stronger instead!

But these things were strictly a secret.

Hence, for these two people, Ye Yuan could only say that he used special pill refining methods, that was why it would make the medicinal pills produce a mutation.

Actually, what truly made the medicinal pills produce a change was his chaos divine essence.

But the chaos divine essence was Ye Yuan’s greatest secret. He could not tell others.

Even in combat, Ye Yuan would also use the power of chaos to simulate the effect of world power, lest others see through the flaws.

Ye Yuan discovered that his chaos power was all-encompassing. Just like when he imitated a fiend race powerhouse back then, no one could tell at all.

This also let Ye Yuan have a guess that his chaos power should be a power that was of a higher level than world power.

Ye Yuan could feel that this divine essence’s mutation should be due to those mysterious patterns.

But Ye Yuan’s words were sufficiently astounding already.

Xuan Yu said in immense shock, “You’re truly an Alchemy Dao’s peerless genius! In my view, even if it’s the Medicine Ancestor, when at your age, it’s also impossible to be more impressive than you!”

Coldfeather sighed with admiration and said, “You, kid, are simply a freak! I really can’t imagine how in the world you cultivate! Heh heh, back then, when you, kid, couldn’t break through, those guys all dropped rocks down the well. Now, I want to see how they are going to grovel and lick your feet now!”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “Isn’t that so! There’s already one groveling outside and already waited for seven days at the Zheng Manor’s front door! I reckon that the news of Ye Yuan returning can’t be hidden for long.”

Coldfeather was stunned and said, “Who is it? To actually get the news so quickly?”

Xuan Yu smiled and said, “Who else can it be? Of course it’s Ning Zhiyuan that old fox!”

Mentioning Ning Zhiyuan, Coldfeather’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Serves him right!”

...

Finally, on the 15th day, Ye Yuan met Ning Zhiyuan.

This half a month’s time, Ning Tianping had always accompanied him at the gatehouse and did not go and find Ye Yuan.

Regarding Ning Tianping’s performance, Ye Yuan was still very satisfied.

This guy was very smart. He knew that speaking up for the Ning Family would only be counterproductive, so he might as well say nothing.

But him constantly accompanying at the gatehouse also showed the Ning Family’s standpoint.

Loyalty and staunch but also had a sense of propriety.

This Ning Tianping, Ye Yuan really could not find any fault.

“Elder Ning, truly sorry. Head Elder Zheng’s body was deteriorating with each passing day and seriously couldn’t be delayed, resulting in neglecting Elder Ning. I hope that Elder Ning doesn’t blame me!”

Everyone still had to meet in the future, they still had to put on an act on the surface.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s words sounded very perfunctory. Clearly, it was intentional.

But this half a month, Ning Tianping revealed to him a corner of Ye Yuan’s iceberg. Ning Zhiyuan also deeply realized that this great god could not be offended.

Therefore, there was absolutely no way he dared to offend Ye Yuan.

“True, true, Brother Zheng’s body concerns the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s safety. It should naturally be a top priority. I wonder how Brother Zheng’s situation is now?” Ning Zhiyuan asked without leaving a trace.

Coldfeather gave a cold snort by the side and said, “No need for you to be concerned! What’s the point of coming? When he was injured, I didn’t see any of you come to see him until today!”

Ever since that elders meeting, Coldfeather had never shown Ning Zhiyuan a good attitude.

His seniority was exceedingly high and his strength was also powerful. In this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, there were really not many who could do anything to him.

Ning Zhiyuan also had an awkward look having met with a rebuff.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since this Ye broke through, Brother Zheng is naturally fine. Elder Ning can rest assured.”

The few people were currently talking when a figure came in from outside the door. Who could it be if not Zheng Qi?

The current Zheng Qi had a robust physique and was light on his feet, agile and nimble. How was there still the slightest hint of being heavily injured on the verge of death?

The moment Ning Zhiyuan saw Zheng Qi, he could not help getting a shock!

Not only did the other party’s strength fully recover, it actually improved a step further, breaking through to half-step Celestial Deity Realm!

“Hahaha, Younger Brother Ye, your alchemy strength is truly getting more and more transcendent!” Zheng Qi entered with a big laugh.
