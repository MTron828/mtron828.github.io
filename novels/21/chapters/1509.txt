Chapter 1513 Heading for the Ancient Ruins

Outside the Fan Family’s front door, Fan Lin, Fan Yu, and Li Ji were all sending Ye Yuan off.

“Family Head, please go back! This period of time, many thanks for Family Head’s care,” Ye Yuan said with cupped fists.

Fan Lin hurriedly smiled fawningly and said, “What’s Master Source Night saying? It’s my Fan Family that benefited from you!”

These few years, the Fan Family could be said to be like the noonday sun, their limelight even pushing down the City Lord Manor’s.

Seizing this opportunity, the Fan Family expanded its forces without restraint and obtained tremendous benefits.

Furthermore, the Fan Family already faintly had the momentum of Capone’s number one clan because of coming into contact with the Blood Yama Hall, this leviathan.

Fan Lin understood in his heart and all of this was thanks to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Family Head is too courteous. Taking the king’s salary, sharing the king’s burden. Since I’m a retainer of the Fan Family, I naturally have to contribute to the Fan Family.”

Fan Lin smiled and said, “This Fan knows that the Fan Family’s bit of salary, Master holds it in contempt. For Master to be able to keep on staying in the Fan Family, this Fan is endlessly grateful! Li Ji, Master Source Night is leaving. Why aren’t you sending him off?”

As he said, he winked desperately at Li Ji.

Learning the news that Ye Yuan was leaving, Li Ji’s entire person was listless, dispirited these few days.

Her heart was long dedicated to Ye Yuan, but who knew that in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan became an existence that she looked up too.

The gulf between the two became bigger and bigger.

Now, Ye Yuan was about to leave straight away, Li Ji’s entire person was flustered.

“S-Source Night, have ... have a pleasant journey.”

Holding in for a long time, Li Ji only squeezed out this one sentence.

Suddenly, she discovered that there was already no common language with Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Miss Li Ji, take care. Mountains and water will meet, perhaps we’ll still meet again. Alright, it’s getting late. Source Night will take his leave.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought Long Zhan and turned around and left.

With his current status, bringing away a slave was naturally nothing.

Li Ji looked at Ye Yuan’s back view foolishly, a row of clear years quietly falling.

Fan Lin looked at this scene and said with a sigh, “My good daughter, you’re a person from a completely different world from him. He’s like the sun in the sky, blinding until people can’t open their eyes, while we’re destined to be ordinary.”

Although the matter of the Great Dao Heavenly Melody did not leak out, for him to be able to preach on Dao for several hundred capital cities’ alchemy elites, this kind of strength was simply inconceivable.

The imperial city was Ye Yuan’s stage to display his talents.

...

“Haha, Younger Brother Source Night actually didn’t bring that lass from the Fan Family, very surprising!”

Seeing Ye Yuan, Heavenstar went up to welcome with a big laugh.

Li Ji and Ye Yuan’s ambiguous relationship, Heavenstar was naturally aware.

He even thought that Ye Yuan would bring along Li Ji. After all, that little girl was indeed alluring.

“Huhu, to me, cultivation is the most important thing. Others will only distract me,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Heavenstar could not help being secretly shocked when he heard. For Ye Yuan to be able to have such accomplishments at a young age, what he relied on was not just talent!

According to his understanding, Ye Yuan indeed secluded himself all year round. The majority of the time was used on cultivation.

“Haha, Younger Brother really makes me perspire in shame! No wonder Younger Brother can achieve such accomplishments at a young age!”

Ye Yuan smiled. Suddenly, he discovered that Heavenstar’s attire was somewhat weird. It was a servant’s attire.

Furthermore, Heavenstar concealed his aura. One could not tell the actual situation from the exterior at all.

“Ye Yuan Heavenstar, you’re ...” Ye Yuan wondered.

Heavenstar smiled and said, “Although the ancient ruins trip this time is led by our Blood Yama Hall, dragons and fishes are jumbled up together. There are forces from everywhere. Your existence is of great significance to our Blood Yama Hall. If we let them know that I personally went into action, it will surely arouse a lot of speculations.”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he came to a realization.

Yi Han did not scruple to let him finish off Ka Xin in order to pick him out.

The ones entering the ruins this time were definitely the various major capital cities’ top geniuses.

The lousiest were probably also Ka Xin’s level.

There were even quite a number of geniuses who were probably already Fiend Commander Realm. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

For this, the Blood Yama Hall probably also used up quite a few favors.

Expending such a great cost, seemed like the ancient ruins this time were extraordinary!

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Let’s go then. Long Zhan, you go to the imperial city first and help me clean up a bit.”

Long Zhan bowed and said, “Yes, Master.”

The current Long Zhan already broke through the bottleneck, becoming an Origin Deity powerhouse.

Ye Yuan naturally would not let Long Zhan really go to Eminent Orchid Imperial City. These words were just in order to set Heavenstar’s mind at ease.

He already instructed Long Zhan to make a detour to Tiderain City halfway and wait for him.

Ye Yuan would go and meet up with him after shaking off Heavenstar and Yi Han, these two troubles.

Sure enough, when Heavenstar heard Ye Yuan’s words, he revealed a look of relief.

Long Zhan was just a slave, he naturally would not put him in his sights.

What was important was Ye Yuan’s attitude.

Looks like the Profound Yellow Cauldron really had a considerable effect. Ye Yuan seemed to have already accepted the fact of joining the Blood Yama Hall.

After Long Zhan left, the party boarded the flying boat.

Ye Yuan was also alarmed by the Blood Yama Hall’s strength, one mystic treasure after another.

This flying boat was a middle-grade fiend lord mystic treasure. When flying, it had the effect of shuttling through space, its speed extremely fast.

Along the way, Heavenstar fawned on Ye Yuan in every possible way. How was there any airs of a Fiend Lord?

Ye Yuan naturally could not hide his inadequacies by keeping too quiet as well. Occasionally giving Heavenstar a pointer could make him happy for half a day.

Although Heavenstar’s realm was high, in terms of foundation skills solidness, Ye Yuan flung him more than ten streets behind.

Just like that, the three people rode the flying boat for more than half a month before arriving where the ruins were located.

The ruins were near Eminent Orchid Imperial City’s west side’s Trace Light City. The date was approaching, the various major capital cities’ elites were also hurrying on the way.

When the three people arrived at the vicinity of the ruins, a large group of people already gathered here.

The three people’s arrival did not cause too big of a disturbance.

Ye Yuan swept a glance, his gaze suddenly stopping on a group of people in the middle.

Six young men, gazes sharp, auras extraordinary. One look and obviously they were experts.

Seemingly sensing Ye Yuan’s gaze, those six people actually collectively looked over at Ye Yuan.

But after they discovered that Ye Yuan was only grand completion Fiend General Realm, they immediately lost interest, all going to do what they should be doing.

Those six people were all initial-rank Fiend Commanders. Clearly, their strength was very powerful.

“What keen perception. I merely swept a glance and they noticed me,” Ye Yuan was secretly shocked.

“Those six people are conferred as Eminent Orchid Six Sons. Their strength looks down on everyone among Eminent Orchid Imperial City’s young generation. They are the same as Ka Xin, all killing their way out from a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. But they are stronger than Ka Xin!” Yi Han said.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “So that’s how it is. An imperial city’s resources are indeed not what a capital city can compare to.”

Although Ka Xin was formidable, when placed in the imperial city, it was not quite enough to look at.

Right now, there were roughly one to two hundred young geniuses present. Each one of these people was not inferior to Ka Xin.

“Yo, isn’t this our Master Source Night? Tsk tsk, both an alchemy genius and also a martial arts genius. It really makes people admire him! Azure Phoenix, if you were to encounter Master Source Night, you have to greet him properly!”
