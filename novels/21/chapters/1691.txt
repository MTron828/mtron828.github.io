Chapter 1695 Nowhere to Put Face

“Invite here? Hahaha! In my view, it should be being carried over!” Yang Fan laughed loudly as he said with a mocking look.

A wave of loud laughter sounded out at Utmost Peace’s side.

They all knew that because Zheng Qi used the Crazed Sword Evanescent. He lost too much essence and was already not long for the world.

Now, he must be in a half-dead state.

This kind of trash, still need to go and invite him?

Yang Fan looked even smugger. The feeling of stepping on Zheng Qi’s face was really too awesome.

He and Gao Yuan could not be said to be very close in the past.

With Gao Yuan’s personality, how could he possibly sink in the capital on his own disciple without holding anything back?

However, Yang Fan’s potential being lacking was a fact. He had always been chastised because of this as well.

As someone in the same generation, Zheng Qi was respected as Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s head elder, but he was just a small elder.

The disparity between the two was too great.

Hence, taking revenge for his master was merely a cover. He wanted to borrow this to give vent to the dissatisfaction and resentment in his heart.

Yang Fan understood that having him take action as merely in order to find an excuse that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City could not refuse.

But so what?

Being stifled for too long, he had got to release it!

Hence, Yang Fan was like a jumping clown, talking drivel there, his words being very disdainful toward Zheng Qi.

“Hey, Zheng Qi this cowardly turtle, why haven’t you come out yet? I say, your Heavenly Eagle Imperial City wouldn’t deliberately want to shield him, right? Since he’s already dying, then hurry up and get him out so that this Yang can send him off!”

Yang Fang talked in high spirits over there but did not detect that a hint of ripple surfaced in space.

Qiao Anshan and the rest were powerful and had long detected something amiss, faces involuntarily changing slightly.

At this time, a figure slowly walked out. Qiao Anshan and the rest suddenly changed countenance.

Yang Fan’s haughty voice suddenly stopped, just like a duck with its throat squeezed, emitting a strange cry.

“Z-Z-Zheng ... Y-You ... Impossible! I ... My eyesight must be failing!”

Yang Fang was frightened by the scene in front of him until his entire face turned purple.

He rubbed his eyes hard, discovering the Zheng Qi was still standing there perfectly fine, his aura shocking!

At this time, Zheng Qi’s eyes were profound, aura shocking. How was there still any hint of his essence being in a deficit, an appearance that he was not long for this world?

Of course, what they were shocked at was far from this!

Even though Zheng Qi did not deliberately release his realm pressure, the aura faintly given off his body was God knows how many times stronger than people in the Divine Lord Realm.

Even a fool could also tell that Zheng Qi was currently a true-blue Celestial Deity powerhouse!

On Utmost Peace Imperial City’s side, each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They scratched their scalps till it hurts and also could not understand why a dying man suddenly became a Celestial Deity powerhouse?

Back then, about Yang Fan beating down Zheng Qi with one palm, Wen Yilin saw it with his own eyes.

Just how long had passed, not only did Zheng Qi come back from the dead, he even broke through the massive shackle and became a Celestial Deity powerhouse?

The faces of Wen Yilin and Zuo Shujie revealed a look of wild elation when they saw Zheng Qi’s breakthrough was successful.

Ye Yuan this boy truly turned something rotten into the magical!

It also could not be blamed that Qiao Anshan they all opened their mouths wide, not daring to believe. Even they themselves were affected, so how did the others not also feel like they were dreaming?

“City Lord, I heard that ... someone wants to find me to take revenge?” Zheng Qi said coolly.

One sentence, Yang Fan’s face turned pale with a whoosh.

Take revenge?

Finding a Celestial Deity to take revenge?

My head f*cking burned out, right?!

Yang Fang wished to find a hole in the ground to bore into at this time.

He finally realized that he was simply a clown jumping around just now.

He wanted to send Zheng Qi off?

Zheng Qi sending him off was more like it!

Zuo Shujie had a broad smile and said by nudging his mouth, “There, it’s that person, Gao Yuan’s disciple! He said that he has the enmity of killing his master with you and cannot live under the same sky as you. He even said to let everyone be a witness, he wanted to help his master, Gao Yuan, take revenge. Why don’t you grant his filial piety!”

“Hahaha!”

The powerhouses in the city finally could not hold it in anymore, all letting out wild laughter.

This scene was simply comical to the extreme.

“It’s really killing me! A Divine Lord Realm actually wants to find a Celestial Deity powerhouse to take revenge! His head was kicked by a donkey, right?”

“You look at his cocky appearance just now, he probably only knows how to bully the old, weak, sick, and disabled, right?”

“Is this guy really Utmost Peace Imperial City’s elder? This is clearly a clown! Hahaha!”

...

The entire city roared with laughter. This scene was simply wonderful to the extreme.

Yang Fan’s face simply had nowhere to put.

“City Lord, I ...” Yang Fan had a bitter look, looking at Qiao Anshan anxiously.

Qiao Anshan’s expression at this time was not much better than Yang Fan’s.

This was Yang Fan losing face, could it be that he wasn’t losing face?

“Scram to one side! Disgraceful thing!” Qiao Anshan said in a solemn voice.

Yang Fan felt akin to being granted amnesty and hurriedly retreated to the back of the group.

But at this time, how could Zuo Shujie be willing to yield?

“Don’t go! Just now, it was you all who were shouting and wrangling, calling to have Zheng Qi come out, saying to find him to take revenge. Now that I called him out, why don’t you all take it! Yang Fan, where’s your filial piety?”

Zuo Shujie pressed on relentlessly. Now, it was turning one’s spear against himself, even Qiao Anshan also did not know how to dodge it for a while.

Qiao Anshan gnashed his teeth in hatred and said in a low voice, “Who can tell me what’s going on?”

Wen Yilin still had not come back to his senses until now. Hearing Qiao Anshan questioning people, he answered, “This ... might be that the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City obtained a natural treasure of heaven and earth recently, this punk hit the jackpot, breaking through by a fluke!”

Another Celestial Deity powerhouse, Peng Zhi, also said: “It must be so! Celestial Deity Realm isn’t as common as cabbages, being able to break through when one wants to break through. Zheng Qi was just lucky! A first-layered heaven Celestial Deity who just broke through, there is nothing to fear at all!”

Qiao Anshan nodded slightly. He also felt that this was the most likely scenario.

Hence, he gave a cold snort and said, “Zuo Shujie, do you still want face or not? Forcing a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse to seek revenge on a Celestial Deity Realm powerhouse? Since Zuo Shujie already broke through, then he’s someone of our generation. How can he go and get involved in the matters of Divine Lords again?”

When these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar.

This degree of shamelessness was unparalleled.

It was clearly you all who pushed people too far. Now, you even played the blame game, saying the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was shameless.

Zuo Shujie clasped his hands and said with a look of admiration, “Qiao Anshan, this Zuo got to hand it to you today! Your face is even thicker than my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s city walls! Even if this Zuo brings out 100% of my power, it probably can’t breach the skin of your face either!”

Qiao Anshan’s face turned black and was just about to flare up when another horrifying aura descended from the sky.

A middle-aged man in azure clothing slowly stepped out of the void.

The horrifying aura exuding off his body made the faces of Heavenly Eagle’s powerhouses change greatly.

This aura was much stronger than even the two great city lords!

Zuo Shujie’s and Qiao Anshan’s face changed at the same time, saying to the middle-aged man in azure clothing respectfully, “Paying respects to Lord Inspector!”

The middle-aged man in azure nodded slightly and said coolly, “Southridge Ten Cities has already not activated the Golden Sword Token for several tens of thousands of years. What is it for this time?”
