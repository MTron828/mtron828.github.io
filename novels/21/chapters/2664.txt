Chapter 2670: Heavenly South’s Number Two Genius!

A small family’s patriarch said with a face full of excitement, “Third Hall Master, you mean … all the families present?”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. It’s all of the families! If the various major cities have suitable candidates, they can send them over too! But I’ll say the unpleasant things first, this hall master has my own standards in selecting people. If they can’t meet the standards, they will be sent back without exception! But, as long as I take them in, presumably it won’t be a problem for them to step into grade four heavenly alchemist in the future.”

The whole audience was in an uproar!

These words were really too domineering.

It was just that, many people expressed skepticism about this.

“Huhu,?ignorant fools. Do you think that grade four heavenly alchemists are all cabbages? A puny little grade two heavenly alchemist is spouting a stream of empty rhetoric here; what a joke!” Min Nanshan said with a cold laugh.

Although these words were somewhat unpleasant when coming out of his mouth, they represented what everyone was thinking in their hearts.

Those able to reach grade four heavenly alchemists were already feudal kings of a region in this Heavenly South City!

Not anybody could reach grade four heavenly alchemist.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Whether or not it’s cabbages, has nothing to do with you anymore! Family Head Min, you’ve already withdrawn from Heavenly South Pill Hall. Isn’t it somewhat inappropriate for you to be telling people what to do here?”

Min Nanshan’s face flushed red, immediately feeling somewhat ashamed to show his face.

He was actually being isolated now! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhao Xun also spoke up at this time, saying, “Min Nanshan, the real idiot is you! Even this hall master also needs to ask for advice with an open mind in front of Ye Yuan! Whoever can obtain his guidance, becoming a grade four heavenly alchemist in the future is probably the most basic threshold!”

“What? How is this possible?”

“Head Hall Master means that Third Hall Master is giving pointers to him?”

“Could it be that in the future, grade four heavenly alchemists will really become cabbages?”

… …

Zhao Xun personally admitted that he was inferior to Ye Yuan. This made the big shots from everywhere incredibly shocked.

It was true that Ye Yuan could refine true grade heavenly pills. But that was just grade two heavenly pills.

A grade two heavenly alchemist giving pointers to a grade four heavenly alchemist, it sounded somewhat fantastical no matter.

Even Min Nanshan’s expression changed abruptly too.

“Humph!?Then, let’s wait and see!” Min Nanshan’s face fell, and he flicked his sleeves and left.

Zhao Xun’s gaze looked toward Ironcore, and he said in a cold voice, “Ironcore, from today onwards, my Heavenly South Pill Hall absolutely won’t refine a single heavenly pill for your lineage! Take your leave!”

Ironcore’s expression changed wildly, feeling like he shot himself in the foot.

Why was Heavenly South Pill Hall so impressive?

It was because they monopolized all the supply of Heavenly South’s heavenly pills!

However, before this, factions stood in great numbers in Heavenly South Pill Hall, each with their own interests.

Even Zhao Xun two people were no exception either.

Therefore, wanting to boycott a certain faction was actually very difficult.

But now, Ye Yuan shocked all of the alchemy path families with lightning means.

Then, who still dared to show face to him, Ironcore?

Ironcore gritted his teeth and also left in resentment.

Zhao Xun said in a solemn voice, “From tomorrow on, this hall master and second hall master will go into closed-seclusion! All of Heavenly South Pill Hall’s matters will be taken charge of by Third Hall Master! In addition, if anyone dares to sell Ironcore’s lineage heavenly pills, they will be immediately expelled from Heavenly South Pill Hall!”

Everyone was inexplicably shocked!

No one thought that the two hall masters were actually going into closed-seclusion!

Then in the closed-seclusion period, the real hall master would actually become Ye Yuan!

They naturally did not know that Ye Yuan’s pointers in the past few days gave these two people a feeling of grand awakening.

It even overthrew their inherent understanding of Alchemy Dao over the years.

Therefore, they needed to go into closed-seclusion to reorganize the accumulation of so many years.

If not for this feast today, they would have long gone into closed-seclusion.

… …

In less than three days, the disciples carefully selected by the various major families, have already been sent to Heavenly South Pill Hall!

Obtaining the legacy of true grade, how could they let such an opportunity slip by?

Carrot and stick, this was a management method that proved effective every time!

Wanting to make these families submit wholeheartedly, deterrence was a must. There naturally could not dispense with benefits too.

Ye Yuan’s personal guidance was the greatest benefit!

Especially that even Zhao Xun personally admitted that he was inferior to Ye Yuan. This made Ye Yuan become even more mysterious in front of the factions from all over.

This estranged feeling would make people give rise to a sense of awe.

Over 200 disciples were brought into a very big pill refining room.

After entering, the guards went out.

There were only these disciples left in the pill refining room.

In Heavenly South City, these major families’ disciples mostly knew each other and naturally started to engage in small talk.

One of them was immediately being lauded like a myriad of stars surrounding the moon.

“Congratulations, Brother Wenhao! You’re Heavenly South’s number two genius to begin with. This time, being personally guided by Master Ye, you’ll definitely be able to achieve true grade heavenly pill! When the time comes, the Song Family will be Heavenly South’s number one family clan!”

“Still Heavenly South’s number two genius? Master Jiang Li has already advanced to grade four heavenly alchemist. He’s already considered a senior. How can he be called a genius? Brother Wenhao is the well-deserving Heavenly South’s number one genius now!”

“Right, right, right, number one genius! Number one genius!”

… …

Song Wenhao was the Song Family’s number one genius. At the same time, he was also reputed as Heavenly South’s number two genius after Jiang Li!

But he had made quite a bit of accomplishment in alchemy at a young age.

His strength overpowered those in the same rank in Heavenly South!

This time, the Song Family reined in at the brink of the precipice and similarly obtained the right to roll in elite disciples. Song Wenhao naturally occupied a foremost position.

Although Song Tianyang’s strength was not as good as Min Nanshan’s, the Song Family saw hope in Song Wenhao, and they naturally focused on grooming him.

Being praised by everyone, Song Wenhao smiled calmly and said, “True grade heavenly pills have been spread until they seem miraculous. In my view, it’s merely nothing more than this! The Land of Heavenly South just doesn’t know the right method. That’s why true grade will seem precious! As long as this young master learns the method of refinement, wouldn’t true grade heavenly pills still be easily accomplished?”

He never felt that he was worse than Jiang Li in any way.

He had actually always been unconvinced by the title of number two genius.

As for true grade, although he knew that it was impressive, he did not care.

It was nothing more than the method of inheritance!

He, Song Wenhao, had always been incredibly fast in cultivating heavenly medicine refining arts.

As long as he grasped the method of inheritance, he felt that he would definitely be able to refine true grade heavenly pills.

Time slowly trickled by. Nobody came to this pill refining room.

They were forgotten for the greater part of the day.

Many people started to get irritated.

Some paced back and forth, some were restless, and others were full of complaints.

“Humph!?What’s the deal with hanging us out to dry here? These three hall masters are also taking Heavenly South’s noble families too lightly!” Song Wenhao was the most impatient and could not refrain from grumbling.

“Isn’t that so! Looks like he didn’t call us over to teach us at all. It’s purely to give a blow to Heavenly South’s noble families!” Someone immediately echoed.

“Third Hall Master is dissatisfied with our families’ previous actions. This is deliberately giving us a blow to take revenge!”

… …

Along with the passage of time, similar complaints grew more and more.

These genius disciples also became even more impatient and restless.

However, there were exceptions too.

One of the young men came before the furnace fire and practiced fire controlling techniques.

“Huhu,?Song Minzhe, with your paltry skills, don’t make a spectacle of yourself! Making a frantic last-minute effort, do you think that Third Hall Master will pick you?” Song Wenhao looked at him and said with a sneer.
