Chapter 2685: Dying Before Achieving Success!

“Roar!”

The blood dragon circled around for a while, then tunneled back into Ye Yuan’s body again. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Yuan felt that his bloodline power was stronger than before.

“Huhu,?it looks like Young Friend Ye is really fated with this Land of Dragon Slumber! Congratulations, Young Friend Ye, for advancing to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!”

Black Flood Dragon King was all smiles, a sincere look on his face as he came up to congratulate.

If it were before, Ye Yuan would definitely have a better impression.

But now, he was full of disgust in his heart.

But, at this time, it was clearly not the time to lose all decorum. Ye Yuan smiled too and said, “Many thanks, Black Flood Dragon King.”

Black Flood Dragon King smiled and said, “This Land of Dragon Slumber has been here for no idea how many years already. It’s never been heard of that anyone could feel the summoning from inside! Young Friend Ye really surprised this king! It’s just, don’t know what kind of summoning Young Friend Ye felt?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. I just feel a mysterious power.”

Everyone naturally did not believe these words.

In reality, it was indeed a lie too.

It was indeed a mysterious power, but Ye Yuan felt that this mysterious power seemed to be calling him to go in.

Seemingly … somewhat too impatient to wait.

Of course, this was purely a feeling, Ye Yuan also did not know whether it was real or fake.

In fact, this could be a kind of danger.

Ye Yuan had entered God knows how many mystic realms before. He naturally could not be naive enough to think that this Land of Dragon Slumber was opened by him and that he could come and go as he pleased.

This sort of mystic realm was often accompanied by great danger.

But right now, the expressions of Youqing and the rest were surprisingly ugly.

They could not quite maintain their face anymore.

Rumble?…

Right at this time, there was a tremor.

The seabed was shaking violently.

The entire sea region seemed like mountains were crying out and the sea was howling.

Right then, the restrictions in front of the cave collapsed with a loud bang.

An aura of a dragon slowly flowed out of the cave.

“There’s no rule for the opening of the Land of Dragon Slumber. But, each time it opens, it will trigger a tsunami! Right now, a large area on land has already been submerged,” Black Flood Dragon King explained.

“Hehe,?the Land of Dragon Slumber seems to be very fun. I’m going in first!”

Little Dragon Girl giggled and did not wait for everyone to react either, and she already turned into a wisp of green smoke, burrowing into the cave.

Black Flood Dragon King’s expression changed, and he said angrily, “This lass is really too worrisome! The Land of Dragon Slumber is filled with dangers. Does she really think that it’s her own backyard? Young Friend Ye, hurry up and go in. I’ll entrust this girl to you!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and also leaped and entered the Land of Dragon Slumber.

Youqing and the rest were naturally not willing to fall behind others and followed after in succession.

… …

Ye Yuan only felt a blur in front of him, as if he had arrived in another world.

There was no sea water in the Land of Dragon Slumber. The surrounding cliffs showed a red-black color, giving people a strange feeling.

Ye Yuan surveyed the surroundings, there were actually no traces of Little Dragon Girl anymore, and he could not help frowning slightly.

This girl was too wild, wanting to control her would really expend some effort!

However, after entering the Land of Dragon Slumber, that mysterious summoning seemed to have gotten stronger.

As if there was someone who kept calling softly in his ear.

“Hurry up, I’ve been waiting a long time for you!”

This feeling was very magical.

Ye Yuan forcibly suppressed the impulse to enter the depths and took out a small conch.

It was precisely the Emerald Sea Divine Conch’s clone body!

Ye Yuan recited a spell, the small conch became bright and started flying.

The urgent matter on hand was still finding Little Dragon Girl first.

As for this Land of Dragon Slumber’s secret, take it slowly, there was no rush.

But right then, several figures suddenly dashed out, surrounding Ye Yuan.

Who could it be if not Youqing and the others?

There were even three Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses following by his side!

There was also Muchen and the rest nearby, and beside them, there were many Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses too.

Facing a group of seafolk, the current Ye Yuan immediately became a public enemy.

There were no fewer than ten Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses present!

“Heh,?boy, we meet again! Now that we’ve entered the Land of Dragon Slumber, I want to see how you can still be cocky! That day, you made me lose all face. Today, I want you to pay back a hundredfold!” Youqing said with a cold smile.

Muchen also had a proud look as he said, “Punk, weren’t you very arrogant? Now, are you still arrogant? Come over and kneel down for this young master. This young master can consider sparing you from death!”

“Idiot!” Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and said.

The moment Muchen heard, he became furious and said in a cold voice, “Go, capture this punk for me, I want him alive! I want him to experience what’s called a life worse than death!”

“Yes, Lord Dragon Son!”

The Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse that Muchen brought immediately responded, erupting with a powerful strength all over his body, and pouncing towards Ye Yuan.

Although Ye Yuan already broke through to Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, facing so many Jade Sovereign Heavens at the same time, it was clearly beyond his means.

However, he did not pay too much attention.

If he could not beat them, escaping was still not a problem.

But, just as he was about to activate his movement technique, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

A drop of scarlet liquid suddenly fell from the top of the cave, dripping onto that Jade Sovereign Heaven accurately.

“Ahhh!!”

That Jade Sovereign Heaven let out a tragic scream, then, his body shriveled up rapidly.

In virtually a blink of an eye, all the blood in his body seemed to have been drained, becoming a human jerky.

This bizarre scene made the faces of everyone present change abruptly.

That was a Jade Sovereign Heaven!

In a blink of an eye, he became a human jerky!

What on earth was that strange liquid?

Ye Yuan’s brows also furrowed.

This scene was too coincidental.

That drop of liquid dripped precisely onto the Jade Sovereign Heaven who attacked him without any deviation!

As if this was all planned.

Ye Yuan was shocked in his heart. Could it be that that mysterious power was protecting him?

What on earth was this guy summoning him for?

Ye Yuan suddenly felt like he had fallen into a pit!

He understood that wanting to get away now probably could not be accomplished anymore.

Entering the Land of Dragon Slumber, he would have to follow the path set by that mysterious power!

However, while he was shocked, Ye Yuan naturally would not show it.

He looked at Muchen and said with a grin, “You only brought this one Jade Sovereign Heaven??Tsk tsk,?this is called dying before achieving success, right? The journey has only just started. I find it very hard to imagine how you’ll be walking the road at the back by yourself.”

The corners of Muchen’s mouth twitched slightly, his expression being ugly to the extreme.

He was not like Youqing, able to bring three Jade Sovereign Heavens by his side to protect him.

He only brought one person, and the person died immediately.

How aggravating!

Just as Ye Yuan said, this Land of Dragon Slumber was full of dangers. Relying on himself for the road at the back, it was a little too lacking in strength.

At this time, Ye Yuan looked towards Youqing and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Why? Are you still planning on watching the show? Don’t you want to kill me very much? Why aren’t you attacking?”

Youqing’s brows furrowed slightly. He also felt that it was a little too coincidental!

Hence, he did not act hastily.

But at this time, he was cornered by Ye Yuan.

His expression suddenly turned dark and he said to the three Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses beside him, “The three of you, attack together!”

“Yes!” Those three people answered without knowing the inner reason and went up.

But, just as they pounced toward Ye Yuan, three drops of liquid hit them accurately.

Another three human jerkies!

The expressions of everyone present changed wildly!
