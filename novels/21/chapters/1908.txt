Chapter 1912: Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan instinctively felt that this Rong Xiyue was not simple.

This kind of bizarre enchantment art, Ye Yuan seldom saw it in his lifetime too.

If she really exerted herself to the utmost, probably Yu Jinsong this kind of powerhouse would find it hard to ward off too.

It was just that there was still a True God Realm powerhouse behind Yu Jinsong, that was why Rong Xiyue was very observing of proper restraint.

“Then ... why would Your Excellency still refine pills for her?” Ning Tianping asked puzzledly.

He rarely saw Ye Yuan’s solemn appearance and could not help being secretly surprised.

When Ye Yuan faced True God powerhouses, he had a calm look too.

“This woman isn’t simple. That Linghua Pavilion is likewise not simple. Since they sent Rong Xiyue here, it shows that they don’t wish to lose all decorum with us for the time being. Of course, we aren’t their match right now as well. Hence, everyone had best stay in our own lanes and mind our own business,” Ye Yuan said.

This Linghua Pavilion always gave Ye Yuan a mysterious and unfathomable feeling.

Compared to Yu Wenfeng and the others, that Pavilion Lord Linghua was clearly much harder to speculate his strength.

But, borrowing this chance to demand an exorbitant price, Ye Yuan was happy about it too.

...

Along the way, Rong Xiyue was indeed very restrained.

She used a secret art to completely cover up the immortal qi on her body, looking much more ordinary to bystanders.

Ye Yuan did not send people to keep an eye on her, but it was precisely because of this that she dared to be unbridled even less.

Returning to her residence and shutting the door and windows, rays of light suddenly emitted from Rong Xiyue’s body.

It was only to see her mumbling away, and then those light dots finally turned into a light cover, enveloping the whole house.

Following that, a ray of yellow light flew out from her glabella and turned into an illusory black-robed man, landed on the opposite side.

If Ye Yuan was here, he would be able to recognize that this black-robed man was precisely that mysterious Pavilion Lord Linghua.

“Paying respect to Protector Witheredwood.”

Rong Xiyue gave a deep bow to the black-robed man.

The black-robed man nodded slightly and said, “This boy is really impressive!”

A hint of surprise flashed across in Rong Xiyue’s beautiful eyes as she said, “Even you, Protector Witherwood, aren’t his match either?”

The black-robed man said, “I originally wanted to secretly observe him, but don’t know why, I keep having the jitters. I have a feeling that as long as my wisp of divine sense left your glabella, it will definitely be eradicated by him!”

Rong Xiyue’s expression changed slightly and she said, “My Immortal Dream Art doesn’t have any effect on him at all. This is still my first time encountering it! In the past, even True God powerhouses couldn’t possibly detect it too.”

Rong Xiyue’s Immortal Dream Art was greatly different from ordinary enchantment arts.

It was not a spell that directly targeted other people’s divine souls, but a kind of divine soul reflex technique, affecting the other party’s senses, being extremely undetectable.

As long as she did not take the initiative to go and make contact with the other party’s divine soul, it was simply impossible for the other party to discover it.

Since Rong Xiyue learned it, she had never failed before.

Did not expect that today, it was directly cracked by Ye Yuan.

“Originally still wanted to probe his background, but looking at it now, this kid is even more troublesome than this old man imagined!” The voice of Witheredwood hidden in the black robes carried some gloominess.

Rong Xiyue’s brows furrowed slightly and she said, “He put forth a condition, refining pills for us will be five times more expensive than the other two forces! Protector Witheredwood, what ... should we do?”

The black-robed man mused for a moment and said, “Agree to him! This kid’s appearance thoroughly disrupted our set up. Now that he’s willing to stay out of the way, that’s for the best. As long as he doesn’t come and provoke us, we don’t provoke him either, and can even ingratiate to him. Everything is for the grand plan.”

Rong Xiyue bowed slightly and said with a nod, “Xiyue understands.”

...

Three groups of people let Ye Yuan make a huge killing.

Furthermore, Southridge’s great commotion already spread throughout the entire Nine Pledge Imperial Capital at this time too.

The news of Southridge becoming an independent country astounded the four directions.

Of course, the most important thing was still Ye Yuan’s alchemy skills!

Those Celestial Deity powerhouses of the middle-order imperial cities and high-order imperial cities all went into action without delay.

A Five-star Alchemy Emperor capable of refining vast spirit divine pills, in a place like the Nine Pledge Imperial Capital, that was absolutely in high-demand.

Not only did more and more Celestial Deity powerhouses came to Heavenly Eagle, more and more alchemists also gradually gathered at Heavenly Eagle.

Actually, many of the Pill Tower’s alchemists including Xuan Yu were personally taught by Ye Yuan. After several centuries of tempering, their strength was no longer what it used to be since long ago.

Especially the Ning Family’s Ning Siyu, her talent was pretty strong and was long already a Four-star Alchemy God who was known far and wide.

Coupled with Ye Yuan’s current fame that was at the height of its prosperity, Heavenly Eagle because of the holy land of alchemists.

After Southridge’s situation settled down, a year’s time already passed.

In this one year, Ye Yuan’s realm also unknowingly broke through to Sixth Firmament Divine Vestige.

Of course, under Ye Yuan’s magic-like medicinal pills assault, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City gave birth to a large batch of Celestial Deity powerhouses.

The power of the present Heavenly Eagle Imperial City already surpassed the vast majority of high-order imperial cities.

However, following everyone’s strength becoming stronger and stronger, Bai Chen became more and more awkward here.

He discovered that everyone around Ye Yuan, their strengths were all advancing by leaps and bounds. Only he remained forever at a standstill.

In other imperial cities, everyone’s cultivation speed was very slow, easily calculated with tens of thousands of years.

But in Heavenly Eagle, ten thousand years was too long; they were all seizing every minute they can!

With extremely high-quality medicinal pills, everyone’s cultivation speed was too fast.

Every day, Bai Chen was living in torture.

In this one year, Bai Chen also became familiar with Ning Tianping and the people around Ye Yuan.

Except, he kept on being unable to integrate into that circle.

Not that because everyone was not fond of him, but because everyone knew that he would be eliminated in the end!

At the rate of this progress, Heavenly Eagle’s Ninth Firmament Celestial Deities would be as worthless as cabbages.

On this day, Bai Chen finally could not endure it anymore and went to find Ye Yuan.

“Master, I ... the time that I came out is too long, I ... want to go back to Sky Foothill to take a look.”

Bai Chen discovered that right now, only returning to Sky Foothill could calm his state of mind.

After all, in that place, he was the sovereign.

How could Ye Yuan not understand what he was thinking in his heart? He smiled and said, “Going back, are you reconciled to it?”

As the controller, he could indeed do as he pleased in the Sky Foothill World.

But that was under the prerequisite of not knowing that there was a huge world outside. Once they knew, who could be willing to be mediocre?

Bai Chen smiled bitterly and said, “What can I do even if I’m not reconciled to it? Miss Leng’s strength is likely almost catching up to mine already. As for the others, in a few more years, they will also surpass. I ...”

Ye Yuan patted his shoulder and said smilingly, “This one year, Southridge has just stabilized. There was a multitude of things to attend to, so I’ve never been able to settle down. Now that the overall situation has preliminarily settled down, I finally have time to consider your problem!”

Bai Chen was taken aback when he heard that and said, “My problem? What problems do I have?”

In Heavenly Eagle, he was the most free person, because he did not need to cultivate at all. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I want to research a new kind of medicinal pill and need your cooperation!”

The moment Bai Chen heard, he said in pleasant surprise, “I wonder what new medicinal pill Master wants to research?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “Soul Driving Dao Fusion Pill!”
