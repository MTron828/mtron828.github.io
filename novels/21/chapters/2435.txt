Chapter 2441: Utterly Shameless!

“Utter nonsense! Dao Ancestors are the strongest in the Heavenspan World. This is everyone’s consensus. You want to use this to absolve from your crime, simply laughable!” Lin Chaotian said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan similarly repaid with a cold smile as he said, “You had Lin Huan and Lin Lang test my depths in front of the mountain pass gates. Wasn’t it in order to measure my strength? How is it, are you satisfied or not?”

Actually, on the way here, Ye Yuan thought of many possibilities.

But he did not understand Lin Chaotian and also did not know how his character was.

Li-er rescued Daymeld, this matter was indeed easy to set off denouncing. Dao Ancestors launching an attack was also not incomprehensible.

But, encountering Lin Huan and Lin Lang in front of the mountain pass gates, it suddenly dawned upon Ye Yuan in his heart.

Ye Yuan knew that that was probing, but so what?

You want to see it, then I’ll show you!

He knew that his cultivation method probably really aroused observant and conscientious people’s coveting.

Regarding this point, Ye Yuan was actually long already mentally prepared.

After all, walking along the way, his performance was too monstrous. If it aroused the attention of some observant and conscientious people, wanting to find clues was not hard.

Let alone that with Lin Chaotian’s strength and status, investigating one Ye Yuan was seriously too easy.

As long as he was willing, he could investigate Ye Yuan inside out.

Now, Lin Chaotian was being overbearing, attempting to infuriate him, confirming his idea even more.

Conceirng Lin Chaotian coveting his cultivation method, Ye Yuan was not surprised about it.

It was just that his method was a little too despicable.

Lin Chaotian just smiled lightly and said, “Looks like Lord Saint Azure is destined to betray the human race! Since that’s the case, then this ancestor can only carry out justice on the behalf of Heavenly Dao, and take you down!”

While talking, the horrifying aura on Lin Chaotian instantly covered the entire Origin Enlighten Mountain Range.

Once a Dao Ancestor was enraged, floating corpses will span hundreds of millions of miles!

Their power was simply unimaginable.

This level of powerhouse attacking, could rent the sky asunder and split the earth open, even causing the entire world to fall into collapse.

Otherwise, it would also not have been called Doomsday Battle.

Now, this level of powerhouse actually wanted to deal with a martial artist who just entered Deva Realm, how could it not make people’s expressions change?

Even if situated outside of the mountain pass gates, Pang Zhen and the rest also felt as if the apocalypse had arrived.

This kind of terrifying power was what they had never witnessed before.

Dao Ancestor powerhouses had already not displayed their power in front of the world for far too long.

But today, Lin Chaotian made a move against Ye Yuan!

Wan Zhen’s expression changed wildly and he said, “Not good! Is ... Is this the power of rules? Really too terrifying! Dao Ancestor Life actually really dares to risk universal condemnation, and make a move against Lord Saint Azure!”

Pang Zhen gritted his teeth and said, “How can this be?! With His Excellency’s loftiness, how can he possibly betray the human race? Could it be that these Dao Ancestors don’t distinguish black from white?”

The warriors of the unpredictable legion were all filled with righteous indignation.

In their hearts, Ye Yuan was a god-like existence!

The astonishing battle of Eight Void Mountain already completely subdued them.

That kind of loftiness, that kind of devising strategies in a command tent, that kind of life and death struggle, was etched deeply in each person’s heart.

But now, the Dao Ancestors were actually going to make a move against their spiritual leader, they were unable to tolerate it.

It was just that they also knew that this sort of thing was not what they could intervene in at all. They could only wait here anxiously.

Terrifying wood-attribute power of rule enveloped the entire Origin Enlighten Hall.

The space here was directly locked down by the power of rule!

Reaching the realm of rule, one already touched the origin of Heavenly Dao, arriving at the same destination via different means.

Lin Chaotian’s power of rule could completely affect spatial law, not letting Ye Yuan escape.

How could the power of rule of the number one Dao Ancestor be of the common sort!

Lin Chaotian’s strength had long already reached an inconceivable realm.

Even for those Deva Fifth Blight powerhouses, apart from those few pinnacle-most progenitors, the others could not even move a muscle!

This kind of terrifying power made their faces change abruptly.

Everyone knew that Dao Ancestors were strong, but today, it was their first time witnessing the true power of a Dao Ancestor.

Too horrifying!

With Lin Chaotian’s strength, killing Deva Fifth Blights was simply effortless!

Lin Chaotian looked at Ye Yuan, an attitude of looking down from a height, as he said coolly, “Saint Azure, this ancestor honors that you toiled hard and rendered great merits. So I won’t kill you today. I’ll only imprison you in Origin Enlighten Bodhidharma! After quelling the divine race, this ancestor will naturally let you leave! I believe that you don’t have any objections, right?”

These words carried strong sympathy.

As if him not killing Ye Yuan was a great bestowal on Ye Yuan.

He was strong, so his words were natural law!

Ye Yuan’s matter had no final verdict at all.

Especially that Ye Yuan threw out a speech on breaking the shackles. It added an additional trace of conspiracy to Lin Chaotian’s actions and behavior even more.

It was just that at this time, who would come forward and speak up for Ye Yuan.

Who dared to step forward and speak up for Ye Yuan?

Facing Lin Chaotian’s powerful pressure, Ye Yuan was composed and collected. He just smiled coldly and said, “Lin Chaotian, you showed your true colors, right? If you’re really doing it for the good of the human race, and if you really suspect that I’ll betray the human race, shouldn’t you directly kill me now? Imprisoning me in Origin Enlighten Bodhidharma, are you planning on subjecting me to torture, to ask about the secret on me? Come on, kill me if you have the ability!”

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, they had never heard of such a request before!

But they also perceived it, Ye Yuan was mocking Lin Chaotian! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Lin Chaotian did not want to kill Ye Yuan at all.

Lin Chaotian had experienced the vicissitudes of ten billion years. How could he be goaded by a sentence?

He just said coolly, “Saint Azure is worrying too much! You created the human race’s flourishing age through the ages, merits outweighing demerits! If this ancestor kills you, wouldn’t I become someone who’s ungrateful and forgets kindness? You rest assured. This ancestor will keep my word. After quelling the divine race, I’ll definitely let you go!”

“Enough! Lin Chaotian, put away your disgusting face! Saint Azure was brought here by this emperor. Sp if you want to make a move against him, step over this emperor’s dead body! Heh heh, if you take care of Saint Azure himself and Saint Profound’s descendants today, you’ll be able to laugh overlooking the world tomorrow!” Right at this time, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets completely exploded.

The more he thought, the more he felt that Lin Chaotian’s motives were not pure.

If Ye Yuan did not say, he would not have imagined it.

But Ye Yuan already put it so clearly. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets came from that era too. So how could he not understand Lin Chaotian’s scheme?

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s words were extremely believable!

Lin Chaotian gave Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets a glance and said coolly, “Us nine great Dao Ancestors control the Heavenspan World together! Since you say so, then this matter will be decided together by the nine great Dao Ancestors! Everyone, how do you all think that this matter should be dealt with?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ expression changed wildly!

One Dao Ancestor Life, although the weight of his words was heavy, he dreaded the name of Azure and Profound Dual Saints.

But nine great Dao Ancestors joining hands, this weight was too terrifying!

These nine people joining hands could pierce a hole in the sky!

“Saint Azure’s talent is too strong, if he defects to the divine race, probably even us Dao Ancestors won’t be able to suppress too! This ancestor feels like for the safety of the human race, we should imprison him temporarily!” Dao Ancestor Destruction said indifferently.

“This ancestor concurs!”

“This ancestor concurs too!”

... ...

As they spoke, seven great Dao Ancestors spoke one after another, their statements were actually surprisingly unanimous!
