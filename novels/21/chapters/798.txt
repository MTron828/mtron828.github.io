Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“One who comes is a guest. Show yourself,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Huhu, what an impressive boy, to actually be able to detect this Emperor’s arrival!” An aged and hoary voice sounded out.

Ye Yuan was startled inwardly when he heard that. In the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, the only one able to proclaim himself as this Emperor was the Crimson Afterglow Holy Lord!

Did not expect that the Crimson Afterglow Holy Lord actually descended here.

Ye Yuan sensed that the arrival’s strength was extraordinary through the array formation previously, but did not think that it was actually the Crimson Afterglow Holy Lord.

All of a sudden, there was an undulation in the space within the house. The Crimson Afterglow Holy Lord actually directly appeared inside the house.

But regarding this sort of means, Ye Yuan did not have much surprises.

Those Dao Profound Realm experts could already sense the Heavenly Dao. This bit of means was nothing strange.

“Turns out it’s the Holy Lord. Ye Yuan failed to receive you,” Ye Yuan gave a slight bow and said neither obsequiously nor haughtily.

Tu You waved his hand and said, “No need to be overly courteous. This Tu came uninvited. You wouldn’t mind, right?”

Ye Yuan criticized inwardly for a bit. You already said it like this, can I say that I mind? But in truth, your esteemed self interrupted my closed-seclusion. I really mind a lot!

But Tu You saying this sort of words was already dropping his own attitude very low. If Ye Yuan still did not give face, that was not knowing how to appreciate favors.

Ye Yuan could tell that this Holy Lord in front of him was not his real body. But his strength was sufficient to instantly kill Ye Yuan.

“I wonder what Holy Lord is finding Ye Yuan for?” Ye Yuan did not follow up on the words. It was also considered to have expressed his attitude.

Tu You sized up Ye Yuan, but he was even more pleased with Ye Yuan in his heart.

Such temperament was someone who did great deeds.

Not like some people cracking themselves up to be geniuses, but were short-tempered and brash, unable to take on major duties.

“Ye Yuan, do you know what is inside that Crimson Afterglow Valley?” Tu You ignored what was asked.

Ye Yuan’s eyes flickered, secretly cursing sly old fox.

One had to first give in order to take. This sort of logic, how could Ye Yuan not understand?

Tu You did not do anything the moment he came and just whetted up his appetite. Clearly, there was nothing good.

But speaking of which, he succeeded.

Tu You’s one sentence made Ye Yuan’s heart squirm itchily.

He was indeed very curious just what thing was inside this Crimson Afterglow Valley, to actually be able to give birth to a Ten Great Divine Kings class expert.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s struggling look, a hint of a smug smile flashed past the corners of Tu You’s mouth.

Ye Yuan mused for a moment, and then he opened his mouth and said, “Holy Lord best talk about your intentions for coming first. If the matter is too difficult, Ye Yuan would rather not enter the Crimson Afterglow Valley.”

Tu You’s expression froze. He did not expect that Ye Yuan would actually speak such words.

“Facing such temptation and you’re actually able to control your own desires. You, this youth, are indeed not simple! Fine then, actually, there isn’t anything hard to say out either. Actually, I came to find you, is to wish to entrust the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land to you!”

A few words, Tu You already discovered that Ye Yuan’s conduct was too slick and sly, impervious to everything. Talking with him, it was better to beat around the bush less. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Beat around the bush too much, it would incur the other party’s aversion.

It was just that Tu You’s words frightened Ye Yuan.

He was just a Divine Traversing Realm martial artist and Tu You actually wanted to entrust a holy land to him!

What did that have to do with this?!

Ye Yuan said with a bitter smile, “Holy Lord, you’re joking with me, right? I ...”

Tu You stopped Ye Yuan’s words with a hand gesture, but said, “This Emperor is naturally not joking with you! You don’t have to be in a hurry to reject. Listen to this Emperor’s terms first before giving a reply again. As long as you promise to take over the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, all of the resources in the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land will be up to you to allocate! Furthermore, within three years after entering the Crimson Afterglow Valley this time, this Emperor will personally take action to send you into the Crimson Afterglow Valley once more!”

Ye Yuan knew that the Crimson Afterglow Valley could only open once every 300 years. If he forcefully sent him into the Crimson Afterglow Valley, Tu You would probably pay an unimaginable price.

In order to make him agree to become the next Holy Lord, this Tu You was also going plenty all out.

“Just what is inside the Crimson Afterglow Valley?” Ye Yuan still could not refrain from asking.

“Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool!” Tu You did not keep him in suspense this time and answered immediately.

“Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool ... What is that?”

Ye Yuan was also considered to be experienced and knowledgeable. But this Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool, he really had not heard before.

“Wait until you go in, you’ll know! The liquid in this Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool can cleanse the marrow and let the martial artist cast off their old self and undergo a complete transformation. The longer a martial artist stay inside, the greater the harvest, and the greater the future accomplishments as well! I know that your physical body is powerful. This Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool can temper your physical body to be even stronger! Furthermore, inside this Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool contains extremely titanic amounts of essence energy. As long as you have the ability, it can let you directly breakthrough to Dao Profound Realm!” Tu You said.

“Oh? It actually has such a miraculous effect?” Ye Yuan said curiously.

He was turning it over in his mind secretly that this Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool’s effects seemed to have some similar aspects with true dragon’s blood.

Except, it sounded like this Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool seemed to be more impressive.

After Ye Yuan refined the dragon blood, he obtained tremendous benefits too. The present Ye Yuan could forcefully receive a profound artifact bare-handedly just with his physical body; simply a human-form lethal weapon.

Ye Yuan had reached the important juncture of breaking through to the Boundless Realm at present. This Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool seemed to be an excellent breakthrough site.

Tu You nodded and said, “It will only be stronger than you imagine! But this pool water is extremely tyrannical. Ordinary people can’t walk far at all. Therefore, the benefits obtained are limited too. This Emperor only walked 80 feet out back then too.”

“Oh? What’s there to pay attention to?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

“In this Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool, every 70 feet is a threshold. The deepest area is a full 490 feet far out. Since the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land was established, only the first generation Holy Lord walked to the deepest part. And his accomplishments was also the highest in history, with strength comparable to the Ten Great Divine Kings! But a genius like him, only a single one appeared in the history of the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land. Back then, the people who entered the Crimson Afterglow Valley together with this Emperor, only I walked to 80 feet out, which is also within the second threshold’s scope. Therefore, I became the Holy Lord!” Tu You explained.

When Ye Yuan heard, he developed a thick interest in this Desolate Ancient Drip Essence Pool.

Seemed like this pool was indeed rather different.

Ye Yuan mused for a moment and said to Tu You, “Ye Yuan thank Holy Lord’s great kindness. It’s just that taking over the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, it’s completely out of the question for Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan has something hard to disclose and definitely has to leave the Crimson Afterglow in the future.”

Tu You said solemnly, “No worries! I know that a measly little Crimson Afterglow definitely can’t keep a genius like you. But I already don’t have much time left. If I can’t find someone able to take on the huge responsibility, the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land is bound to be swallowed up by the other holy lands. This sort of conclusion is what this Emperor doesn’t wish to see. This Emperor finding you is to hope to preserve a hint of incense fire 1 from extinguishing. In the future, when you find a good man, passing the position of Holy Lord to him is good too. Before this, I’ll make Chen Qin they all do everything in their power to groom you and let you achieve the Dao Profound Realm as soon as possible! This Tu is already someone about to die. I don’t have other requests and only hope that the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land can carry on existing. Ye Yuan, please accept a bow from me!”

As he said those words, Tu You actually gave Ye Yuan a deep bow!
