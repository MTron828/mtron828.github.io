Chapter 1995: Burning Hot

“Oh? Say it! Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said curiously.

“When that Ye Yuan received Empyrean Vast Universe’s third sword move, Ye Yuan actually forced him to raise his realm to Ninth Firmament True God Realm before defeating Ye Yuan. And after that, Ye Yuan seemed to have a great change in disposition, heading to Crape Myrtle Cave all by himself.”

Jian Yunxin clearly knew about Ye Yuan’s affairs like the back of his hand.

When Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets heard, he indeed revealed an astonished expression.

“The Ninth Firmament True God Realm? What formidable means! Even this emperor also wasn’t this heaven-defying back then. Just what kind of deity is this kid? However, a great change in disposition also shows that his cultivation method has a problem. Furthermore, the problem isn’t small. Whether or not he can achieve greatness in the future, it is something unknown,” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets exclaimed with admiration.

Jian Yunxin nodded and said, “This child feels this way too. However, if Father is interested in him, why not do a divination?”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets laughed in spite of himself and said, “Do you think that I didn’t perform a divination before? This child can’t be fathomed!”

Jian Yunxin’s pupils constricted, incredibly shocked in his heart.

“Alright, this matter ends here. The world shall soon change. I hope that my Jian Family can tide over this tribulation safely.” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets sighed lightly and walked away with his hands behind his back.

...

Inside Virtuous Wind Establishment, Jian Sutao looked at Ye Yuan five people, being rather surprised in his heart.

With the Ancient God Battlefield opening up this time, their Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital actually had more than half return!

In the past years, being able to have two or three people returning was already pretty good.

Being completely wiped out was also not something impossible.

In reality, with the Ancient God Battlefield opening up this time, many great imperial capitals’ children of destiny did not have a single one come back.

This time, not only did five return, furthermore, each and every one of these five had great improvements in strength.

Especially Song Yu, he already reached peak Fourth Firmament True God.

The other three people also all broke through to Fourth Firmament True God.

Even Ye Yuan also broke through two minor realms in one go.

One could say that it was a happy ending situation.

“Looks like you all had considerable harvests in the Ancient God Battlefield this time!” Jian Sutao said.

Song Yu smiled and said, “It was all thanks to Brother Ye along the way. If not for him, we’d likely have been completely annihilated. Oh,

right, when we’re coming back, that Lord Heavenly Emperor said that our destinies all had changes. I wonder if City Lord can take a look for us?”

Jian Sutao nodded his head and said, “Naturally can.”

As he said, he mustered up the aura viewing art and looked towards Song Yu and the rest.

Of course, he deliberately avoided Ye Yuan.

He did not dare to look. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was alright if he did not look, but one look and he jumped in fright.

When Song Yu saw Jian Sutao’s expression, he asked doubtfully, “What’s wrong, City Lord?”

Jian Sutao clicked his tongue in wonder and said, “Strange! Really strange! Making a trip to the Ancient God Battlefield, you all actually advanced to emperor surmounting aura? Let me take a look again.”

As he said, he mustered up the aura viewing art again and examined them closely again.

The four people’s destinies had indeed broken through to the emperor surmounting aura.

This was incredible! Within the entire great imperial capital, four emperor surmounting auras actually appeared all at once. This was one of its kind.

As for Song Yu and the rest, each and every one of them was extremely excited.

Song Yu originally had a peak imperial aura. He was an existence only a step away from reaching the emperor surmounting aura.

Breaking through to the emperor surmounting aura was something within reason.

But the rest made Jian Sutao greatly surprised.

Of course, they themselves were also extremely surprised.

Among the three people, Guo Jingyang and Middle-stage both had late-stage imperial auras. Hu Fei merely had a middle-stage imperial aura.

Who could have thought that even Hu Fei became emperor surmounting aura?

Although the Ancient God Battlefield is a good place to change one’s destiny, such a big transformation wouldn’t occur too! Emperor surmounting aura isn’t some cabbage. More often than not, 100 great imperial capitals can’t produce one emperor surmounting aura too. But now, four popped out all at once. Counting in Ye Yuan, it’s five! This ... Hang on, could it be that ... the problem lies with Ye Yuan? Jian Sutao was speculating about this in his mind.

Thinking like this, he felt that it was very likely.

Jian Sutao discovered that all the people who got close to Ye Yuan seemed to have massive changes to their destinies.

Just take Jian Hongxiao for example; he originally should not have the chance to return to the Stellar Hall already.

Who knew that not only did he come back, he even broke through to the Empyrean Realm!

This destiny was simply heaven-defying.

The more Jian Sutao thought, the more he felt that the probability was very high.

One had to know, their ancestor, Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, was such an existence with extremely heaven-defying destiny.

Hence, the Jian Family became one of this Heavenspan World’s top major family clans.

Even those Transcendent Heavenly Emperors also had to give some face when seeing the Jian Family’s members.

Could it be that Ye Yuan was actually such an existence?

The more Jian Sutao thought, the more alarmed he got, and the more curious he became. Just what kind of magical power did this Ye Yuan have on him, to actually be able to have such tremendous influence?

Except, he did not dare to look!

Whenever he gave rise to the thought of viewing Ye Yuan’s aura, a feeling of immense danger would well up in his heart.

“City Lord, I ... I really broke through to the emperor surmounting aura?” Hu Fei said with an upsurge of excitement.

Jian Sutao said in a solemn voice, “Why? Do you doubt this empyrean?”

Hu Fei hurriedly said, “Dare not, dare not! It’s just ... I don’t quite dare to believe it. Thank you very much, City Lord!”

Jian Sutao nodded his head and said, “You all go out. Ye Yuan stay.”

Song Yu and the rest knew that Jian Sutao did it for the emperor bone and left very sensibly.

After the few people left, Ye Yuan took out the emperor bone. A powerful aura immediately teemed the entire Virtuous Wind Establishment.

Jian Sutao’s gaze turned intent, and he said agitatedly, “It’s indeed the Qilin emperor bone! You ... You actually really brought it out!”

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Sutao and said with a cold smile, “City Lord really knew how to plan things! Don’t you tell me that you didn’t know who was watching over this Qilin emperor bone?”

On this trip, Ye Yuan could be said to have had a narrow shave.

This Qilin emperor bone was not what True God Realm martial artists could get at all.

This Jian Sutao was simply digging a pit for him.

It was not just him. Those children of destiny who went to the Bone Devil Ridge also fell for the scheme.

If they knew that there would be an Empyrean bone devil guarding the Qilin emperor bone, they would not go even if beaten to death.

Therefore, Ye Yuan was very angry right now.

Him being able to get the Qilin emperor bone did not mean that he was not angry.

Jian Sutao’s face was also thick. He just said coolly, “What? Do you want to go back on your word?”

Ye Yuan looked at Jian Sutao and said calmly, “Not to the extent of going back on my word. I, Ye Yuan, am a man of my word. This Qilin emperor bone is naturally for you. It’s just that I don’t know if you have that ability to take it or not.”

Jian Sutao smiled and said, “You don’t need you to worry about this. Just an emperor bone, so how could this Empyrean fail to suppress it?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and casually threw the emperor bone to the other party.

Jian Sutao reached his hand out to catch, his state of mind agitated.

But soon enough, his expression changed.

“Ouch!”

Jian Sutao cried out strangely, directly throwing the emperor bone out.

A charred smell came over. It turned out that his palm was already burned into black charcoal.

This Qilin emperor bone was burning hot!
