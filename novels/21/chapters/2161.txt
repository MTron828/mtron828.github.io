Chapter 2165: Really Weak!

Among the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, a youth with thick eyebrows said with a light laugh, “Heh, Brother Long Yuan, you seem to have been looked down upon!”

A hint of disdain flashed across the eyes of the youth with an impressive presence beside, and he said coolly, “The ignorant are fearless, that’s all! My Heavenly Dragon Stronghold’s awe-inspiring reputation isn’t from talking about it. Long Jingyuan, you have no chance too.”

Long Jingyuan laughed and said, “Our score, talk about it again later. But this brat is so arrogant. I’m very annoyed!”

Long Yuan said coolly, “Just a completely useless person! When I run into him in the Mist Battlefield, I’ll end him with one punch!”

Long Jingyuan smiled and said, “Hope that he doesn’t run into you or me, otherwise ... hehe.”

By the side, there were quite a few Sons of the Heavenly Dragon who heard the two people’s discussion, and all responded with cold smiles.

Long Yuan and Long Jinyuan, one came from Heavenly Dragon Stronghold, one came from Black Dragon Stronghold.

These two great heaven strongholds were universally recognized as the strongest bloodline and also the strongest heaven strongholds.

Ye Yuan’s unintentional words clearly already provoked their anger.

Seeing Ye Yuan convinced Long Xiaochun, Morningstar was greatly comforted, and he could not help laughing as he said, “I didn’t expect that you, this lass, actually also have times when you yielded to people.”

Long Xiaochun shot him a fierce glare and hid at one side to restrain her anger.

“Alright, it’s almost time. This emperor will send you all into the Mist Battlefield. I wish you all good luck!”

Done talking, Morningstar pointed a finger, a large hole was torn open in the void.

Ye Yuan felt the Heavenly Dragon Mark on his forehead suddenly heat up, and his body flew toward the large hole involuntarily.

After all of the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon flew into the Mist Battlefield, a huge image appeared above the void.

On the screen, all the figures of the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon could be seen clearly.

The group of Heavenly Emperors was on tiptoes in anticipation, all hoping for their Son of the Heavenly Dragon to be able to show a good performance.

Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes and he arrived in a cloud of fog.

In the fog, north, south, east, west, could not be distinguished.

Ye Yuan mustered up his ocular art and was barely able to see clearly the situation within a hundred feet.

“This is the Mist Battlefield? It looks like a maze! However ... dragon origin crystals makes me look forward to it very much!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

In the Mist Battlefield, the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon would meet randomly.

Sons of the Heavenly Dragon were able to rely on the Heavenly Dragon Mark to sense nearby dragon origin crystals.

Dragon origin crystals were a special product of the Heavenly Dragon Mountain, and also the Dragon Clan’s priceless treasure!

Refining dragon origin crystals could evolve bloodline power and let the dragon race bloodline become purer. Cultivation would naturally speed up as well.

Furthermore, dragon origin crystals were also the key to activating the Heavenly Dragon Mark.

As long as one absorbed a certain amount of dragon origin crystals, they would be able to activate the Heavenly Dragon Mark.

But how much one absorbed varied from person to person.

Suddenly, a surge of powerful law power descended. Ye Yuan felt that his vital energy was suppressed to initial-stage rank seven by this power of law.

When the realm was different, the disparity was too great.

Similarly a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, this kind of gap could not be made up for at all.

Hence, in this Mist Battlefield, it would suppress the power of vital energy, making the group of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon be at the same level.

However, even if the realm was suppressed, the strength of the Sons of the Heavenly Dragon still had some differences.

Sons of the Heavenly Dragon whose cultivation realms were high clearly had more advantage.

“But sadly, this kind of suppressing power is completely useless to me!”

Ye Yuan revolved his own chaos world power and easily blocked this law power outside.

His chaos world power was not within the five elements and did not get affected by outside forces at all.

Ye Yuan’s current realm was just newly into Chaos Realm, but his chaos world power was far stronger than those in the same rank. It was roughly equivalent to middle-stage First Firmament Empyrean Realm.

This difference of half a rank was sufficient for him to crush his peers.

Let alone that he was even of the perfect seventh transformation golden body.

At this time, Ye Yuan felt his glabella heat up. Very soon, he sensed the location of dragon origin crystals.

Winding around for a while, Ye Yuan saw a piece of white crystal growing on the ground very quickly. It was precisely a dragon origin crystal.

Ye Yuan slowly walked over and plucked off the dragon origin crystal.

Feeling the powerful bloodline power in the dragon origin crystal, Ye Yuan could not help feeling an upsurge of emotion.

“Put down the dragon origin crystal! You can scram already!” Right at this time, a haughty voice came from the opposite. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ye Yuan focused his eyes and looked over, but it was an unfamiliar Son of the Heavenly Dragon.

“If I don’t put it down?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

The other party said with a cold smile, “Heh, refusing face when given! Do you know who I am?”

Ye Yuan put away the dragon origin crystal and shook his head as he said, “Don’t know, and not interested in knowing either.”

When the other party saw that Ye Yuan did not take him seriously at all, his gaze could not help turning cold, and he said in a cold voice, “To dare make light of someone from Heavenly Dragon Stronghold, courting death!”

He was called Long Zheng, Heavenly Dragon Stronghold’s number three person, his strength being rather formidable.

Furthermore, he already unlocked the Heavenly Dragon Mark too!

At the outside world, the group of heavenly emperors responded with cold smiles.

“Huhu, this kid is so rampant, suffered retribution now, right? The first one and he bumped into Long Zheng,” Long Zifeng could not help laughing as he said.

A heaven stronghold’s elder said, “Long Zheng’s strength should be able to rank in the top ten among this batch of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon, right? This kid really struck the jackpot!”

Heavenly Dragon Stronghold’s protector elder, Long Tianyu, said nonchalantly, “This kid boasted pretty big. I wonder how much ability he has.”

Clearly, he was 100% confident in Long Zheng.

His Heavenly Dragon Stronghold’s bloodline was extremely strong. The Sons of the Heavenly Dragon in the clan, their strength far surpassed other heaven strongholds.

Long Zheng was ranked third in Heavenly Dragon Stronghold, but when placed in other heaven strongholds, he absolutely had the strength to contend for first place.

“Tsk! Just you watch, Ye Yuan will take him down with one hand!” Long Xiaochun was indignant and immediately retorted Long Tianyu.

Long Tianyu could not help choking. Giving a cold snort, he did not say anymore.

Long Xiaochun’s status was clearly not ordinary, so he did not dare to easily get angry either.

But with regards to Long Xiaochun’s words, Long Tianyu did not believe it at all.

Ye Yuan just broke through to the Empyrean Realm not long ago. He definitely did not even awaken his innate divine abilities. So how was he to fight?

“True Dragon Trampling the Heavens!”

Under Long Zheng’s fury, it was the Universe Dragon Claw’s second form with a raise of his hand.

It was only to see his glabella mark flashed. The power of True Dragon Trampling the Heavens actually skyrocketed a fold!

This power could virtually sweep across those in the same rank.

Ye Yuan looked at this move and could not help finding it funny.

“This is your reliance? Really weak!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and sighed. Long Zheng did not see him make any incredible move either. Ye Yuan just threw a punch out indifferently.

Seeing Ye Yuan treat him without proper respect like this, a hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Long Zheng’s mouth.

“Courting death!”

Then there was a bang.

The true dragon phantom that Long Zheng fired out directly broke apart, while his chest seemed to have been struck by a sledgehammer, directly spurting out a mouthful of fresh blood, flying out backward.

All of the heavenly emperors’ bodies virtually quivered at the same time.

“This ... This is impossible!”

“He didn’t use any martial technique and defeated Long Zheng just based on the power of the fleshy body?”

“Too fake! Could it be that this boy used some evil art?”

... ...

The group of heavenly emperors was full of disbelief. Ye Yuan clearly did not use any martial technique but defeated his foe with one punch.

This kind of thing would only happen when someone at a higher realm crushed a lower realm.

Similarly a Son of the Heavenly Dragon, furthermore, everyone’s realm was at the same level, so how could Ye Yuan do it to this degree?
