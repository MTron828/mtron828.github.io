Chapter 2237: Repaying Great Kindness

Within a massive karst cave, several dozen figures were above the dome.

Above the dome, there was a densely packed swarm, blotting out the sky and covering the sun.

The Ghost Dao Empyreans were currently undergoing a bloody battle with a bunch of blood-red bats.

On the other side, the seven great Heavenly Emperors were currently in a fierce battle with three gigantic Bloodwing Bats.

Fortunately, space was heavily distorted here, the undulations of their battle, the majority of it was transmitted away.

The three Bloodwing Bat Kings were all Heavenly Emperor Realm, with their combat strength being extremely formidable. Even if there was Heavenly Emperor Ninelives, this Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor taking part in the battle, they were still unable to do anything to them within a short time.

A blood-red lotus flower was growing upside down above the dome, emitting heart palpitating undulations.

That was shockingly a rank eight spirit medicine!

On the battlefield, came Ninelives’s alarmed and furious voice.

“This group of fools actually can’t even take care of a bunch of bats! So many people added up isn’t as good as that kid alone too! Really a bunch of good-for-nothings!”

At this time, he actually somewhat missed Ye Yuan.

This group of people walking all the way, encountered this Blood Lotus Flower before long.

Rank eight spirit medicine, these Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were naturally moved.

But who would have expected that this Blood Lotus Flower actually had a large group of Bloodwing Bats protecting, and there were even three Heavenly Emperor Realm Bloodwing Bat Kings!

Even though seven great Heavenly Emperors joining hands practically overwhelmed the Bloodwing Bats, they could not take them down in a short time either.

The living things in this blood pool all had their methods against soul bodies.

Among them, one of the Bloodwing Bat Kings was already a peak First Firmament Heavenly Emperor. Coupled with its strange sound wave attack, even Heavenly Emperor Ninelives would find it hard to ward off too.

While on the other side, those Bloodwing Bat numbers were tremendous.

Although the majority of these Bloodwing Bats were only rank six, the numbers of rank seven were not a lot, but their numbers were too many.

After a bloody battle, the Bloodwing Bats and Ghost Dao Empyreans this side suffered heavy casualties.

“Damn it, if I’d long known this, I would have let that punk live a while longer! These fools, they simply don’t have any use at all.” Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn gnashed his teeth in hatred.

Only at this time did they know the significance of Ye Yuan’s existence.

At this time, it was too late to repent.

“Brother Ninelives, this isn’t a solution. Until when are you planning on holding back?” Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather said in a solemn voice.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives let out a sigh and said, “Forget it. I originally wanted to save some strength, but these three fellows are indeed somewhat troublesome.”

Finished talking, his fingertips curled lightly. A black lantern appeared in his hand.

The black lantern emitted an incomparably strong aura, it was shockingly a heavenly emperor spirit treasure!

When the Heavenly Emperors saw this scene, each and every one of them was overjoyed.

“Youluo Ghost Lantern!” Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn said with a pleasant surprise.

This Youluo Ghost Lantern was Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s lifeblood heavenly emperor spirit treasure. Its power was immensely powerful.

One could say that the Heavenly Emperor Ninelives with the Youluo Ghost Lantern was the real Heavenly Emperor Ninelives!

It was only to see Heavenly Emperor Ninelives hold his palm out. Youluo Ghost Lantern exuded a sinister ghostly energy, making the entire karst cave’s temperature drop by a few degrees.

“Voracious Ghost Face, devour for me!”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze turned intent, crying out coldly. A behemoth-like ghostly figure emerged from the Youluo Ghost Lantern.

This ghost face opened its gaping maws and guzzled over towards the three Bloodwing Bat Kings.

Sensing this terrifying ghost face, a hint of viciousness flashed across the eyes of that strongest Bloodwing Bat King’s eyes.

Suddenly, bloody light shone brightly, the three Bloodwing Bat Kings opened their gaping maws.

A sound wave that could obliterate heaven and decimate the earth vibrated out.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Far away, quite a few Ghost Dao powerhouses were affected by this horrifying sound wave and directly exploded.

The faces of the seven great Heavenly Emperors changed greatly, not expecting that these Bloodwing Bat Kings were actually so strong.

No time to think too much, they unleashed all of their trump cards, meeting with the Bloodwing Bat Kings one after another.

The great battle escalated once more!

The seven great Heavenly Emperors had the advantage in numbers in the end. Gradually, the three Bloodwing Bat Kings finally could not hold on anymore.

The seven great Heavenly Emperors were incomparably excited. Their injuries were not light either, but obtaining the Blood Lotus Flower, everything would be worth it.

“Yo, very lively huh!”

Right at this moment, a discordant voice suddenly sounded out.

The Heavenly Emperors’ gazes turned intent, looking at that figure which suddenly appeared with horrified faces.

Who could this figure be if not Ye Yuan?

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s eyes shrunk and he exclaimed, “This boy is actually not dead? No, wait! Why doesn’t he have any injuries on his body at all?”

Being pursued by a peak Empyrean Souleater Beast, Ye Yuan actually did not have injuries on his body!

How did this guy do it?

The seven great Heavenly Emperors all had astounded faces. It was also because of this that they were almost finished off by the Bloodwing Bat Kings.

They had no time to think too much, immediately recollecting their mouths and focusing on dealing with the Bloodwing Bat Kings.

Actually, Ye Yuan had arrived long ago and was concealed in the void all along, observing the great battle between the Bloodwing Bat Kings and the Heavenly Emperors.

At this time, the timing was apt, that was why Ye Yuan revealed his figure.

“How is this possible? Boy, what do you want to do?” Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn said in alarm and anger.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Do what? In order to repay Lord Heavenly Emperors’ great kindness, this Ye is naturally going to pluck this Blood Lotus Flower away.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Done talking, Ye Yuan did not hesitate either, striding out and flying straight for the Blood Lotus Flower.

The number of Bloodwing Bat was a lot. The moment they saw Ye Yuan rush over, there were immediately several Empyrean Realm Bloodwing Bats that rushed over, attempting to stop Ye Yuan.

But, the places that Ye Yuan’s sword light arrived at, these Bloodwing Bats were not opponents that could last one exchange with this sword move at all!

His combat power was even stronger than these Ghost Empyreans added together!

But the moment he joined the battlefield, there were immediately even more Bloodwing Bats that came to surround him.

Ye Yuan brandished his sword and slaughtered them, akin to entering a no-mans-land.

No one noticed that when Ye Yuan was killing the Bloodwing Bats, he was quietly laying down an array formation above the dome.

Over there, when the Heavenly Emperors saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely alarmed and enraged.

They cursed fervently, but Ye Yuan completely ignored them and got closer and closer to the Blood Lotus Flower.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze turned intent and he suddenly smacked the Youluo Ghost Lantern.

A thick to the extreme black gas gushed out, enveloping his whole body.

“Vajra Ghost Body! Explode for me!”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives seemed to have draped on a layer of battle armor, his combat power suddenly going off the charts.

Those three Bloodwing Bat Kings were long already arrows at the end of its flight. How could they resist the Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives, rampaging once more?

Rumble!

Rumble!

Rumble!

The horrifying energy undulation made the entire karst cave’s space become several degrees more distorted.

The three great Bloodwing Bat Kings were finally finished off by Heavenly Emperor Ninelives.

While at this time, Ye Yuan already charged to the vicinity of the Blood Lotus Flower.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’ gaze was incomparably cold as he said with a sneer, “Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk; hell has no gate yet you want to barge inside! Since you’re seeking death, then this Heavenly Emperor will send you off!”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn also smiled coldly and said, “Brat, you survived a calamity and actually still dared to come and court death! This time, I’ll see where you can hide! Kill!”

A measly little Empyrean actually dared to covet the treasure that they expended great efforts to obtain.

The seven great Heavenly Emperors were incomparably enraged and actually joined forces and charged over.

Seven Heavenly Emperors, how astonishing was the power?

When the other Ghost Dao powerhouses saw this scene, each and every one of their complexions turned deathly pale.

While right at this time, a hint of a strange smile suddenly flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

When Heavenly Emperor Ninelives saw this smile, all the hair on his body stood up.
