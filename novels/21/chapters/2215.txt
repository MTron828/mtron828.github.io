Chapter 2219: Work Things Out!

A Heavenly Emperor was like a heavyweight bombshell or a nuclear bomb, being a deterrent.

The destructive force of a Heavenly Emperor was too strong. Secular cities were not much different from toys to a Heavenly Emperor.

Furthermore, the survivability of a Heavenly Emperor was extremely strong. They were exceedingly difficult to kill.

Once a Heavenly Emperor was determined to seek vengeance, even if he was only a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor, his destructive power would also be extremely astonishing.

Hence, there was this unspoken agreement between heavenly emperors to not intervene in worldly affairs.

Once the Heavenspan World becomes depraved, then the Heavenspan World would wail in sorrow.

Now, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City produced a Heavenly Emperor. They had sufficient capital to play with other Heavenly Emperors.

They could take a share of the loot from the Southern Border, this large cake!

The Southern Border Alliance army slipped away with their tails between their legs. Empyrean Pilljade did not dare to even let out a fart.

From this day onward, Southern Border alchemy world’s arrangement would have massive changes!

A new peak Alchemy Dao holy land suddenly emerged!

Previously, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City could be said to exist by depending on the Myriad Treasure Tower. It was only because their strength was not strong enough.

But now, Heavenly Eagle had a Heavenly Emperor holding down the fort. This caused the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to join into the ranks of the Southern Border’s top factions.

No one dared to not give Heavenly Eagle Imperial City face anymore.

Let alone that after this battle, Ye Yuan’s fame surpassed even the new Heavenly Emperor, making the entire Southern Border hear about it like the sound of thunder.

A Seven-star Alchemy God was capable of refining the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill!

From this day forth, Ye Yuan became the well-deserved number one person among Seven-star Alchemy Gods!

The impact of this title was too great.

The medicinal pills that you could not refine, I could refine!

Powerhouses that you could not create, I could create!

Injuries that you could not treat, I could treat!

With how vast the Southern Border was, who dared to say that they would not need to ask Ye Yuan for help?

What if someday, an Empyrean was heavily injured on the verge of death and needed medicinal pills to save their life?

If one day, a Bodhidharma’s direct lineage disciple needed an extremely hard to refine medicinal pill to break through?

Nobody dared to say for certain!

In the past, Ye Yuan was just a Seven-star Alchemy God and was unable to refine rank seven divine pills. His value was naturally not great.

But now, Ye Yuan’s status was already totally different.

He already truly became a figure of authority in a region!

No one dared to not give him face!

Not long after, the Southern Border organized a four-party talk.

Southern Border Alliance, Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma, seven great ancient families as well as ... Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma!

“I want 60%!” The moment Ye Yuan sat down, he nonchalantly tossed out a heavyweight bombshell.

Empyrean Pilljade shot to his feet and berated angrily, “Brat, your appetite is also a little too big! Careful you don’t burst!”

The representative of the seven great ancient families, Beitang Li, also frowned and said, “Little Brother Ye, show mercy whenever possible! The incident this time, even if we were in the wrong, we also restrained ourselves for a long time for Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s sake. Isn’t that so?”

Empyrean Flutterfeather remained silent.

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, got up, and said, “Is that so? Then ... there’s nothing to discuss. Gentlemen, let’s showcase our true abilities then!”

Done talking, he was actually going to leave the meeting.

The few great Empyreans almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood. Who negotiated like this? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

What the hell ... Did not even talk yet and you were going to dust your bottom and leave?

You directly threw 60% the moment you came, we only said a sentence and you wanted to showcase our abilities.

This ... Still discuss for what?!

Shouldn’t negotiations be push and pull, all parties playing a seesaw game?

Why did it totally change here?

This brat was also too tyrannical!

“Hold on! Lets ... work things out, can’t we?” Empyrean Pilljade did not have a temper anymore and could only speak up.

Beitang Li also hurriedly got up and pulled Ye Yuan and said, “Dear me, Little Brother Ye, everything can be discussed! Let’s sit down first and talk properly. How about it?”

Ye Yuan did not sit down and just said coolly, “Nothing to discuss! Right now, our Heavenly Eagle is the victor. You guys ... are the defeated ones! 60%! I’ve already made a huge sacrifice. If can, you guys carry on discussing. If can’t, you guys can carry on discussing too.”

Domineering!

Tyrannical!

Not giving the other three parties any leeway to turn around at all.

Ye Yuan this time was simply like a different person from back then.

In the negotiations back then, Ye Yuan did not show face at all. A large portion of the profits was even given to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City merely just became an appendage to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

But today, Ye Yuan was too domineering. He was simply unparalleled and tyrannical!

I set the price. You guys can discuss the rest. It has nothing to do with me.

Then Ye Yuan turned around and left just like that.

The other few people exchanged glances. Baffled looks could be seen on their faces.

Bustling around for such a long time, in the end, Ye Yuan came over and dropped a single sentence, and he was done?

Empyrean Pilljade looked at Empyrean Flutterfeather. He said with a sneer, “Flutterfeather, the good brother that you made! You did not stint to fall out with Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure and also had to help Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. In the end, he’s treating you like this!”

Flutterfeather looked at him and said with a faint smile, “This Empyrean is this Empyrean. The Myriad Treasure Tower is the Myriad Treasure Tower! He isn’t targeting this Empyrean. He is targeting the Myriad Treasure Tower! It’s the Myriad Treasure Tower that abandoned Heavenly Eagle first! Younger Brother Ye’s heart is like a clear mirror and naturally has his considerations. Rather, it’s you who ought to consider the things afterward properly. Otherwise, toward Heavenly Emperor Wanzhe there, it will be hard to give him an account.”

Empyrean Pilljade’s gaze turned intent, his expression instantly becoming incomparably ugly.

This four-party talk was facilitated by the Southern Border Alliance in the first place.

But currently, this sort of situation could not carry on negotiating at all.

Could it be that they were going to start a war again?

But if they started a war, the Southern Border Alliance would not have any chips on hand at all!

The Southern Border Alliance that had the greatest influence and strongest strength in the past, currently it was the party with the fewest chips presently!

They were the party with the weakest power and influence.

The Myriad Treasure Tower had pill formulas!

The seven great reclusive ancient families also had pill formulas!

Heavenly Eagle was even the master of the pill formulas!

Only the Southern Border Alliance had nothing!

Of course, it was also not that they had nothing.

They had territory!

... ...

Very soon, someone came to visit.

But the one who came this time was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

Empyrean Flutterfeather led the Myriad Treasure Tower’s Heavenly Emperor Riverback and approached Ye Yuan.

“Huhu, Elder Brother Flutterfeather, I was just about to find you, but I didn’t expect that you came personally.” When Ye Yuan saw Flutterfeather, he had an enthusiastic look.

As for the Heavenly Emperor Riverback who was in the leading position, it was like Ye Yuan did not see him at all, treating him like air.

It was so awkward!

To dare treat a Heavenly Emperor as air, Ye Yuan was probably the first person in the Southern Border.

Flutterfeather could only toughen his scalp and answered, “Younger Brother, this is my Myriad Treasure Tower’s Third Manager, Heavenly Emperor Riverback!”

The Myriad Treasure Tower’s power and influence were tremendous. There was naturally more than one Heavenly Emperor.

In the Southern Border, Myriad Treasure Bodhidharma’s power and influence were extremely powerful. Otherwise, how could their business span across the Southern Border?

Heavenly Emperor Riverback put aside his embarrassment and said fawningly, “Little Friend Ye’s battle shocked the Southern Border and became the Southern Border Seven-star Alchemy Gods’ number one person! It really broadened people’s horizons!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “About this, speaking of which, I still have to thank Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure very much for giving me this opportunity.”

Heavenly Emperor Riverback almost choked to death. He could only cough dryly twice to resolve the awkwardness.

“Little Friend Ye, this matter was indeed my Myriad Treasure Tower’s fault. But then again, for Little Friend Ye to be able to have today’s accomplishments, my Myriad Treasure Tower also made great contributions. Are our two families really going to make distinctions between each other?” Heavenly Emperor Riverback asked.
