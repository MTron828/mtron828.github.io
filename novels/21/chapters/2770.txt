Chapter 2776: One Versus Sixty!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What’s going on with this astonishing aura?”

“This seems like it’s all the auras of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses! How many Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses there needs to be before they can give off such terrifying power?”

“It’s the direction of the Martial Secure Branch. Something big must have happened!”

... ...

One figure after another stood in the air, glaring like ravening tigers.

With 60 Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses gathering together, the imposing momentum was surging. This was a grand event that had never happened on the Rainclear Continent!

The impact was clear at a glance!

This imposing surging momentum spread extremely far and wide, causing countless powerhouses to be shocked!

Each and every one of the Pill Alliance’s Saint Sovereign Heavens’ eyes went wide!

When were there so many Saint Sovereign Heavens on the Rainclear Continent?

“Competing in numbers? Huhu, I’m really not afraid that you’re competing in numbers!” Ye Yuan looked at Li Changsheng and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Li Changsheng’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

He had secretly operated in the Rainclear Continent for more than ten thousand years and merely accumulated this much resources.

Who knew that Ye Yuan actually created 60 Saint Sovereign Heavens in a short hundred plus years!

A Saint Sovereign Heaven army!

Was this fellow still human?

What was even more damnable was that this guy just broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Each of his subordinates had looks of despair on their faces.

That expression was incredibly similar to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciples back then!

Every dog had its day. This time, it was their turn to despair!

Including Ye Yuan, there were 61 Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. This was nearly four times as many as the Pill Alliance!

“Waycloud, why are you rebelling? What Ye Yuan can give you, this exalt can give you as well! Withdraw now. This exalt can swear a Heavenly Dao Oath to definitely assist you in stepping into upper Saint Sovereign Heaven in the future!” Li Changsheng looked towards Saint Exalt Waycloud and shouted fiercely.

He could tell that these Saint Sovereign Heavens were scraped together, completely different from those he groomed.

Scraping together meant that they were not of one heart!

Therefore, as long as he made the other party disintegrate on their own, then there would be nothing to worry about.

Saint Exalt Waycloud looked at Li Changsheng and could not help laughing as he said, “Li Changsheng, your head isn’t spoiled, right? These few years, you rear us Saint Sovereign Heavens in pens like pigs. Do you really think that we can’t tell? That’s right. You’re a grade five heavenly alchemist. But now, Ye Yuan stepped into Saint Exalt Heaven and is similarly a grade five heavenly alchemist! Why should this exalt work for you?”

Saint Exalt Purplesun sneered and said, “Li Changsheng, put away these ulterior motives! We aren’t three-year-old children. How can we change our minds because of one sentence from you? Moreover, you take a look at this sky filled with Saint Exalt Heavens. Do you really think that you’re stronger than Ye Yuan?”

These Saint Sovereign Heavens did not buy Li Changsheng’s promise at all!

Every word uttered also pricked the heart.

Li Changsheng’s face turned pitch black from listening.

This was seriously too unexpected. He was completely unprepared.

Who could have thought that so many Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses could actually appear on this resource-poor Rainclear Continent?

Ye Yuan looked at Li Changsheng and said with a cold smile, “Li Changsheng, stop wasting your energy! A just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds little support! You possess powerful strength but want to enslave the Rainclear Continent. At this point, you still want to make them stand on your side?”

“I’ve already made an agreement with all of the Saint Sovereign Heavens. After destroying the Pill Alliance, I’ll re-establish the Pill Pavilion and pass down the Dao teachings, letting everyone get the benefits of Alchemy Dao! Alchemy Dao is the king’s way. It should benefit the world and not become a tool to satisfy your ambitions! Moreover, in terms of Alchemy Dao ... I’ve already completely surpassed you!”

When transcending the tribulation earlier, Li Changsheng took quite a few grade five heavenly pills too. Ye Yuan naturally took it into his sights.

Although the quality of those heavenly pills was decent, it was as easy as blowing off dust for the present Ye Yuan to refine that quality of heavenly pills.

He broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. Although he was unable to refine true grade heavenly pills for the time being, ninth grade heavenly pills were not far beyond reach for him!

Meanwhile, Li Changsheng was at the very most just the strength of seventh or eighth grade too.

“Hahaha ...”

Li Changsheng suddenly burst out laughing and said, “You aboriginals, do you really think that after breaking through to Saint Exalt Heaven, you’re this exalt’s match? This exalt’s background is big until you all can’t imagine it! Even 17 versus 61, do you all really think that this exalt has no chance of winning anymore?”

After he was done talking, Li Changsheng’s aura suddenly skyrocketed.

Around him, two power of rules fused into one, gradually condensing into a small golden sword!

This small sword was identical with the Lichang Sword.

Great Dao Transformation fourth form!

The faces of the Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses present indeed changed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven who comprehended Great Dao Transformation was no joke!

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said with a faint smile, “You’re mistaken. It’s not 17 versus 61. It’s one versus 60! Big Yellow, I’ll leave this guy to you all. Regarding the others ... I alone will suffice!”

Li Changsheng’s expression changed wildly, and at this moment, Ye Yuan had already moved!

It was only to see his figure sway. A compact to the extreme sword light chopped towards Zhao Jian.

Zhao Ding’s expression changed wildly, only feeling that this sword was simply unavoidable!

Too strong!

The Ye Yuan who broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, his strength was simply fearsome until it made people’s hair stand on end!

Pffft!

Without the slightest surprise, Zhao Jian was directly split in half by this sword!

Zhao Ding was dead!

Li Changsheng was greatly enraged and was just about to make a move when Big Yellow had already arrived!

If these 60 people were all lower Saint Sovereign Heaven, Li Changsheng naturally would not be afraid.

But unfortunately, there was still Big Yellow and Bull Demon, this kind of powerful Saint Exalt powerhouses.

Especially Big Yellow, he killed his way into the top 1000 in the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s cultivation room.

Being able to reach this level, Big Yellow was not the least bit inferior to the Hegemon level holy land’s Li Changsheng!

No, one should say that he had already surpassed Li Changsheng by a lot!

Because the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s might was far from what a measly little Extreme Medicine Sect could compare to.

Therefore, he was equipped with the ability to jump realms and do battle too!

In addition, Li Changsheng was implicated by Li Changsheng and suffered more than ten bolts of Dao tribulation. At this time, he was already seriously injured.

With 60 fighting one ... it could not be described.

At the same time Big Yellow made a move, Saint Exalt Bull Demon, Saint Exalt Waycloud, and the rest of the powerhouses also took action one after another.

Saint Exalt Waycloud these people already broke through to middle Saint Sovereign Heaven too. Coupled with each person having a grandmist treasure, their combat power was not weak!

With 60 people attacking at the same time, how shocking was the commotion!

Li Changsheng only felt surges of power that could topple mountains and overturn the seas smash towards him.

He wanted to run, but Big Yellow’s Coquettish Profligate Hoof was truly boundlessly coquettish. He had nowhere to run at all!

Boom!

Forcefully taking a hit, Li Changsheng was directly slammed flying out.

Then one big move after another greeted him.

Those powerhouses who were brought in from everywhere could not breathe for a long time when they saw this terrifying scene.

Too strong!

With 60 Saint Sovereign Heavens targeting one person at the same time. Even if you had exceedingly formidable means, what could you do?

“This scene is truly unforgettable!”

“60 Saint Exalts! This picture is too beautiful. I don’t dare to look away!”

“Gang fight, it looks satisfying! This scene is much more enjoyable than whatever powerhouses exchanging moves!”

... ...

Seeing Li Changsheng getting pummeled, each and every one of these people, they were incredibly excited.
