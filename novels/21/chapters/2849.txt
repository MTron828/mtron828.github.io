Chapter 2855 Yang Qing’s Rise!

I eliminated you, but it had nothing to do with you.

This was a tragic story!

The outside world raged wildly in a violent storm, but it did not have the slightest to do with Ye Yuan; although it was all because of him.

Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion was ten years long! For ten years, Ye Yuan seriously studied the alchemy records that he could read on the sixth level.

He gleaned considerable benefits!

Profound grade was indeed another realm!

Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao had already taken shape a long time ago.

One pill, one world.

But worlds had distinctions of superiority too. Just like the 33 Heavens and the planes across the heavens, they were not worlds on the same level.

Profound grade heavenly pill, the heavenly pill was still that heavenly pill, but the level was already completely different.

It was just like, forcefully raising their original small world by a level!

The medicinal properties of the heavenly pill naturally could not be mentioned in the same breath.

After Ye Yuan exited seclusion, the proud son of heaven, Lu Daoyi, from ten years ago, had long already faded into the crowd.

Of those True Sovereign Heavens who were once defeated by him, someone had already stepped into Emperor Realm!

Many of his peers had also broken through to True Sovereign Heaven and stepped into the ranks of grade six heavenly alchemist.

However, the piece of news concerning Ye Yuan breaking through to profound grade was still limited to within a certain scope in the end.

Why?

It was because no one took him in as a disciple.

Logically speaking, this kind of amazingly talent genius, there would at least be Extreme Light Pavilion pavilion elders, or even Hegemon Realm powerhouses who took them in as a disciple.

But there were none!

The reason was very simple. Ye Yuan was a divergent cultivator!

Someone who was destined to die, someone who was destined to be unable to step into Hegemon Realm, was not worth paying attention to. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

No matter how genius you were!

The people of the outside world naturally did not know that all the upper echelons in the sect had once fought to take him in as a disciple.

They were even more unaware that Hegemon Cloudmount had long already taken him in as a disciple.

Hence, in many people’s view, the sect was deliberately suppressing Ye Yuan!

Because of this kind of unprecedented major event, the sect actually did not have any movements at all.

Thinking about it, it made sense too. You, a trash who was unable to break through to Hegemon Realm, actually turned a genius who had extremely high potential to become Hegemon Realm into a good-for-nothing.

Preposterous! Therefore, the moment Ye Yuan exited seclusion, he drew all manners of strange gazes. “This guy is clearly occupying the latrine and not taking a dump!” “Isn’t that so? He can’t become Hegemon himself but caused others to be unable to become Hegemon. This is making others have no alternative path to take after he reached the end of his rope!” “Lu Daoyi is completely crippled. He didn’t make any advancement for ten years! Sigh, an originally good sapling for Hegemon Realm got ruined by him just like this!”

Hearing these discussion voices, Ye Yuan was stupefied too.

Who was Lu Daoyi?

What did him getting crippled had to do with him?

In Ye Yuan’s eyes, Lu Daoyi was just an insignificant minor character. He could not be bothered to remember him at all.

“Ye Yuan, you finally exited seclusion! Hahaha, you don’t know how awe-inspiring I, Lord Qing, have been in these ten years!” Just as Ye Yuan was absent-minded, a loud laughter sounded out. No need to look and one would also know that Yang Qing had arrived.

Sure enough, hearing that Ye Yuan exited seclusion, Yang Qing brought Big Yellow, Xiao Qing, and Jingfei immediately came over.

Yang Qing entered the Extreme Medicine Sect too and became the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciple.

As for Jingfei the three of them, because they were of the true spirit lineage, they only stayed on Xuan Yang Peak with the identity of servants.

Yang Qing was still as show-offy as before.

Ye Yuan ignored him but asked, “They all said that I ruined Lu Daoyi. Who is Lu Daoyi?”

The moment these words came out, the whole place fell into a dead silence.

It turned out that you crippled him, but you didn’t even know who he was?

You’re too much!

Yang Qing had a strange look too as he said, “Do you really not know? Or are you feigning ignorance?”

Ye Yuan was speechless as he said, “I entered closed-seclusion as soon as I entered the sect. It’s also not that you don’t know. When did I ruin Lu Daoyi?”

Yang Qing was speechless as he said, “Have you forgotten? Before you went into closed-seclusion, Qin Shan’s lineage came to challenge you once before?”

Upon saying that, Ye Yuan remembered it.

It seemed like there was really such a thing.

“Oh, it’s him? But I didn’t agree to compete in alchemy with him either. How did I cripple him?” Ye Yuan said speechlessly. Yang Qing laughed loudly and said, “Wasn’t it still because you broke through to profound grade? You don’t know how stirred the entire sect was when you broke through to profound grade ten years ago! Lu Daoyi had always believed that he was number one in grade five, and even wanted to catch up to Ancestor Pinespring. In the end, he was given a direct blow by you! Hearing that when he got the news that you broke through to grade five, he vomited blood on the spot and used two years’ time before getting off the bed. During these remaining eight years, he has also been like a walking corpse, without making any improvement in ten years! If this isn’t your fault, who else can you blame?” The muscles on Ye Yuan’s face twitched. What did this have to do with him?

Just this bit of psychic, he still wanted to catch up to Senior Apprentice Brother Pinespring?

Although Ye Yuan did not know about Zhou Pinespring’s past, he believed that Zhou Pinespring absolutely would not be so fragile.

The stronger the opponent was, the stronger you should be.

Your Father had not even made a move, and you already fell down. With just this, you still wanted to break through to Hegemon Realm?

Ye Yuan waved his hand and directly filtered Lu Daoyi out. Turning to size Yang Qing up, he said, “It looks like you’re living pretty well these ten years!”

Many Extreme Medicine Sect disciples around immediately fell down.

This guy was too posturing! Could you freaking not feel any guilt at all? You ruined a Hegemon Realm sapling!

The moment Yang Qing heard about himself, he immediately had a look of exultation and said, “That’s right! Elder Brother, I, am an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse’s personal disciple now! In terms of seniority, you still have to call me martial uncle!”

Ye Yuan’s expression was strange as he said, “Oh? Which Emperor Sakra Heaven is blind? To actually take you in as a disciple?”

It was dead silent all-round again.

Are you freaking courting death?! You were clearly just a puny little Saint Sovereign Heaven. You actually dared to say that an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse was blind?

Yang Qing snorted coldly and said, “Lord Qing, I, swept across True Sovereign Heaven Realm these ten years! At present, I’ve already fought into the top 50 on the True Sovereign List! Even grand completion True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses have been challenged by me! Elder Brother’s superior performance has moved a bunch of Emperor Realm powerhouses. Many Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses wanted to take me in as a disciple but were intercepted by Great Emperor Jia Ze!”

Great Emperor was the honorary name for Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses.

Speaking of Yang Qing’s ranking, it was originally not so heaven-defying that it could obtain the favor of a Great Emperor.

But, during these ten years, his improvement was the fastest among the sect’s martial arts powerhouses.

Not one of!

Yang Qing’s talent was indeed extremely terrifying

The Rainclear Continent limited his talent.

Entering a Hegemon level sect like the Extreme Medicine Sect, his talent revealed itself very quickly!

In these ten years, Yang Qing’s Great Dao rule improved extremely fast.

From the initial-most zero interest shown by everyone, to rising up prominence later on, then to sweeping across True Sovereign Heavens, he only used ten years!

In ten years, his cultivation realm only increased to peak middle True Sovereign Heaven, but his combat power was off the charts!

Grand completion True Sovereign Heaven Realm powerhouses were virtually swept away by him!

His ranking in True Sovereign Heaven also jumped straight up to the top 50 from a few thousandth place!

One had to know, in a huge sect like the Extreme Medicine Sect, how terrifying was it to rank in the top 50!

Hearing these, Ye Yuan was not surprised.

He knew that Yang Qing was tremendously talented. In terms of martial arts talent, he was not even much worse than him.

Of course, he did not have his great destiny, so his combat power was significantly worse than his.

But, entering the Extreme Medicine Sect made up for the inadequacy in his destiny.

In this place, there was no shortage of heavenly pills, no shortage of cultivation methods, no shortage of martial techniques, no shortage of opponents, nothing was lacking!

Hence, his talent started showing.

Yang Qing liked to brag, but sometimes it was also not really bragging. “Yang Qing, you still have the heart to show off to a good-for-nothing here! Huhu, if I were you, I’d hurry up and pack my things up and make a run for it! This way, maybe there’s still a glimmer of hope.” When Yang Qing had a look of exultation, a mocking voice sounded out in their ears.
