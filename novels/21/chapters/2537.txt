Chapter 2543: Great Sensation!

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! How did things develop until like this!”

In a courtyard in the imperial city, Gu Mao flew into a thunderous rage.

The development of things completely exceeded his expectations!

Originally, he was harboring the idea of watching a show, wanting to see how Ye Yuan and the Tang Family were destroyed.

The next day, he went to the Tang Family to watch a good show. He discovered that not only was the Tang Family completely intact, but Tang Jinhua and Tang Yu were also in a never-before-seen state of being fired up with boundless enthusiasm, giving him a good scolding.

In the end, they even chased him out of Whiteheart Hall!

Gu Mao was dumbfounded at that time. Without him, the Tang Family would be equivalent to losing half the country!

Back then, he let out a whole bunch of tough words, making it so that the Tang Family would not be able to survive in the imperial city.

But who would have expected that on the same day, another famous alchemy path star of the imperial city, Jiang Yu, sat garrison in the Tang Family!

Jiang Yu was only stronger and not weaker than him, Gu Mao, in the imperial city’s alchemy world.

Furthermore, Jiang Yu also had a special identity. He was Second Prince’s personal heavenly alchemist!

This weight was completely different!

This action was also another signal that Second Prince released to the outside world. The Tang Family was his, Second Prince’s, ally. No one was allowed to touch them!

The Tang Family’s prestige had no equal for some time.

And Jiang Yu holding down the fort also let the Tang Family shake off Gu Mao’s influence thoroughly.

Whether he left or stayed had no impact on the Tang Family at all!

After a period of time, not only did the Tang Family not decline, it faintly showed signs of surpassing the other families instead.

Gu Mao was depressed!

A partner of Gu Mao’s completely abandoned him today, and he defected to the Tang Family’s arms.

Only then did Gu Mao fly into a thunderous rage.

Suddenly, his expression changed. His face flushed bright red.

Gu Mao’s body started trembling violently.

The fire poison erupted!

He hurriedly mustered up the Iceheart Jade, attempting to suppress the fire poison.

But this time, the fire poison’s eruption was extremely fierce, akin to a fierce beast that broke out of the cage. He was actually … unable to suppress it anymore!

Suddenly, he remembered Ye Yuan’s words.

The harder you suppress, the fiercer the eruption in the future!

The meridians within his body were suffering the ravaging of the fire poison, overwhelming to the extent where he wished that he was dead.

“Quick! Quickly help me to the Tang Family! Go to … the Tang Family!” Gu Mao shouted.

His men carried him to the Tang Family, but Ye Yuan avoided seeing him. He just passed a sentence to him. “People can be proud, but can’t be arrogant, especially incompetent arrogance! Some opportunity, once missed, they are gone. There won’t be a next time!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In the midst of despair, Gu Mao’s fire poison erupted. Not only was he no longer able to continue being a heavenly alchemist, but also his cultivation realm even fell greatly.

The fire poison was much fiercer than he even anticipated.

A heavenly alchemist of his generation fell here.

In reality, Ye Yuan did not need to become a heavenly alchemist to save him at all.

With Ye Yuan’s divine essence that was delicate until it made people’s hair stand on end, combing his meridians once and it would be able to completely get rid of the fire poison.

It was just a pity that Gu Mao put on haughty airs time and again, and finally suffered the consequences.

… …

As for Ye Yuan, he went into closed-seclusion again after the storm.

He had too much to do but too little time.

He was desperately honing his instinct. He wanted to let his instinct replace affinity!

But now, with Jiang Yu’s help, Ye Yuan had a direct understanding of the medicinal properties of all kinds of basic heavenly medicines.

Training with a purpose, his improvement speed became even faster.

Speaking of which, after Jiang Yu came to the Tang Family, he could not bear to leave anymore.

He and Ye Yuan quickly became friends who talked about everything.

Ye Yuan was thirsty for knowledge and had an immense desire to understand the medicinal properties of heavenly medicines.

Therefore, he frequently asked Jiang Yu for advice.

Before coming, Lu Yun instructed him to definitely build good relations with Ye Yuan.

Whatever questions Ye Yuan had, he naturally said all that he knew.

However, along with the passing of time, Jiang Yu went from having the initial dealing with him attitude to having admiration for Ye Yuan.

From the initial-most unilateral asking for advice from Ye Yuan, it turned into intense discussions.

Jiang Yu discovered that Ye Yuan had a penetrating view and an almost freakish instinct for alchemy!

Although he did not know much about heavenly medicines, by relying on his alchemy ability that was engraved in his bones, he could often dispel Jiang Yu’s clouds and let him suddenly see the light with a few words.

This way, Jiang Yu naturally behaved like he obtained a priceless treasure.

As long as Ye Yuan was free, he immediately dragged Ye Yuan to discuss alchemy.

Ye Yuan still did not know much about the refining system of heavenly pills and naturally would not refuse either.

Back and forth like this, although Ye Yuan had not started refining heavenly pills yet, he already had confidence in his heart with regards to the refinement of heavenly pills.

Both parties took what they needed.

While on the other side, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s disciples led by Cheng Chongshan, exerted great pressure on the royal family.

Emperor Eastward was also utterly exhausted from overwork because of this matter.

Inklight Forest was too big, there was no way to investigate this matter at all.

He already employed all of the royal family’s power. But in a blink, three years passed, and there were still no leads.

Helpless, Emperor Eastward even gave their princess to Cheng Chongshan to be a concubine, and also gave many precious treasures to the other two. Only then did it settle the three people down.

Actually, how could Cheng Chongshan not tell that Jun Tian’s death probably had nothing to do with the royal family.

But they finally managed to come out. So they were not willing to return just like that too.

The death of an outer-sect deacon was not considered a big deal to the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

The Jadetrue Heavenly Sect persisting in finding the murderer was more for the sake of face.

But this matter was akin to finding a needle in a haystack; not easy to investigate.

Therefore, the three of them simply stayed in Eastward Country and tyrannically abused power, becoming overlords.

Rather, it was the eldest prince who saw through the three people’s intentions and constantly tried his best to curry favor with them.

This idea of sending the princess to be a concubine had been come up by him.

Because he knew that these three people’s words would have a decisive effect on Father’s influence.

Another five years passed in a blink. And right at this moment, an event that caused a great sensation in the entire Eastward Country happened!

A one point heavenly alchemist was really born!

After 26 years, Ye Yuan finally refined his first heavenly pill!

The quality of this heavenly pill was extremely poor; furthermore, it was the most basic Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill. Even so, this was indeed a heavenly pill!

This matter immediately caused a great sensation in the entire Eastward Country.

The entire imperial city was discussing this matter!

“Have you guys heard? That ascender with only one point affinity from the Tang Family really refined a heavenly pill!”

“My God, this is an unprecedented major event! The 33 Heavens’ alchemy world might even change because of this incident!”

“I can’t figure it out. His affinity is only one point. How on earth did he refine a heavenly pill?”

… …

One point affinity, this was completely an affinity that was cut off from being a heavenly alchemist.

But Ye Yuan finally achieved it after 26 years of hard work!

This matter could be rated as having caused a great sensation.

When Jiang Yu witnessed his scene, his entire being was stunned for 15 minutes before recovering to his senses.

It was not just him. After the entire Tang Family heard about this matter, everyone’s reaction was exactly the same!

Having hope was one thing but really refining it was another.

One had to know, refining a heavenly pill was ten thousand times harder than extracting the Dragonbone Grass!
