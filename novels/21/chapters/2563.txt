Chapter 2569: You Know Again?

“Big Brother! Things are bad! Things are bad! The experts in the royal palace have all moved out and surrounded Nation Teacher Manor! Eldest Prince is currently clamoring outside, asking you to go out and die!” Tang Yu ran over with a panicky look, shouting at the top of his voice.

Ye Yuan walked out of the secret chamber and said coolly,?“Oh??What’s going on?”

Tang Yu said in a panic: “I-It’s the Lord Envoy! Eldest Prince borrowed Lord Envoy’s strength and launched a coup d’etat! Right now, Eldest Prince has controlled the royal palace and sent out all of the powerhouses, surrounding Nation Teacher Manor until not even water can seep through!”

Ye Yuan did not reveal a look of surprise and said, “So that’s how it is! Since Cheng Chongshan has made a move, then is it that reinforcement has arrived?”

Tang Yu was stunned and said, “How did you know?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “With Cheng Chongshan’s personality, if he had confidence in killing me, he wouldn’t have waited until today! The reason why he kept maintaining a decent relationship with me, isn’t it for the sake of waiting for reinforcements?”

Tang Yu said in surprise, “Since Big Brother knows that he’s going to harm you, why didn’t you leave earlier? The one he invited this time is Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s inner-sect ranking’s top ten, Zhao Kun! His strength is extremely formidable! Most likely, it’s to target you, Big Brother!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “If I leave, you’ll be dead for sure, your Tang Family, including Second Prince they all, none will be able to survive!”

Tang Yu was stunned, he did not expect that Ye Yuan actually stayed for their sakes!

An inexplicable feeling welled up in his heart, tears almost burst out.

Following such a big brother was really great!

Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and said decisively, “Big Brother, there are too many experts outside, even if your movement technique is incredible, it’s likely hard to escape too! Have Master Lin protect you and charge out from the side door, I’ll cover the rear!”

Pah!

Ye Yuan directly gave him a slap and scolded with a laugh, “Cover your ass! Your bit of strength isn’t even enough to fill the crevices between Cheng Chongshan’s teeth, and yet still want to cover the rear! Come, go out and take a look.”

Finished speaking, he walked straight towards the door.

Seeing Ye Yuan come out, Eldest Prince immediately went up to welcome, and said smugly, “Ye Yuan, you’re done here! Surrender obediently without resistance, otherwise, the entire Nation Teacher Manor will have to be buried in death with you today!”

Pah!

Only to see a figure sway, Eldest Prince directly flew out.

“Who the hell do you think you are, is there the right for you to speak here?” Ye Yuan said disdainfully.

The royal palace’s experts had blank faces.

This guy was too arrogant!

Already reaching this situation, he actually still dared to make a move first!

Zhao Kun smiled and said,?“Huhu,?got some character! Brat, heard that you ascended from Inklight Forest, Jun Tian … was killed by you, right?”

Ye Yuan ignored him and said to Cheng Chongshan, “Cheng Chongshan, you guys are treating your savior like this?”

Zhao Kun’s face instantly turned black.

Freaking hell, got ignored!

Could it be that this boy was blind?

Couldn’t he tell that he was the biggest one standing in the middle?”

Cheng Chongshan sneered and said, “Savior??Heh heh,?the entire Eastward Country under my Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s rule! Eastward emperor’s life, my Jadetrue Heavenly Sect can decide it with one word! You, a mere Eastward’s nation teacher, shouldn’t saving the envoy be your duty?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said with a nod, “So that’s how it is. Then what are you besieging my Nation Teacher Manor this time for?”

Zhao Kun had a black face and said in a solemn voice, “Boy, are you deaf? I’m asking you whether it was you who killed Jun Tian!”

Ye Yuan looked at Cheng Chongshan and still smiled as he said, “Cheng Chongshan, you should know that you can’t kill me!”

Ignored again!

Cheng Chongshan was awkward to the extreme by the side.

This guy definitely did it on purpose!

The others were also silent like cicadas in winter.

Zhao Kun’s fury had practically already burned throughout the entire Nation Teacher Manor.

Everyone could clearly feel his wrath.

Everyone knew that Zhao Kun was the person in charge here. Yet, Ye Yuan completely ignored him and kept on conversing with Cheng Chongshan.

This ignorant attitude was simply superb.

“Huhu,?boy, looks like you won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin!”

Zhao Kun took a step out, the aura on his body instantly rose to the peak. The faces of everyone present suddenly changed.

Upper Greater Sublime Heaven!

Such an existence was virtually invincible in Eastward Country!

When Cheng Chongshan saw Zhao Kun fly off the handle, he smiled coldly and said, “Ye Yuan, I can’t kill you. But Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao can kill you like killing a dog! You really ate a bear’s heart or leopard’s gall, to dare provoke him!”

Ye Yuan was still indifferent as he said smilingly, “Cheng Chongshan, you seem to be very pleased with yourself. But do you know that the poison in your body hasn’t been completely cured? If I’m killed, even immortals will find it hard to save you too. I dare to bet that no one in your Jadetrue Heavenly Sect can cure the poison of Silent Rupture!”

Cheng Chongshan’s expression changed wildly, but he immediately sneered and said, “Boy, who are you scaring! The poison in my body isn’t cured, don’t I know it myself? My strength has long already recovered to the peak and even faintly shows signs of breaking through!”

Ye Yuan revealed a look of sudden realization and said with a smile that was not a smile,?“Oh,?you know again?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This smile was like carefully concealing a secret.

When Cheng Chongshan saw it, he could not help feeling uncertain in his heart.

He suddenly remembered how Ye Yuan said that he was poisoned back then.

At that time, he did not believe it either.

As a result, he almost died.

Ye Yuan’s smile clearly pointed at something.

He said in a solemn voice, “What do you mean? Could it be that you did something to my body back then?”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “The poison you’re inflicted with is called Silent Rupture! This poison is invisible and colorless. It can incubate in the body for a long time. But once it erupts, it’s incomparably violent! Even Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses will find it hard to escape death too! On that day, I had indeed forced out all the toxins in your body. But that can only treat the symptoms and not cure the root cause. There’s still a small part of the toxin that’s hidden in your body. It might erupt again at any time!”

Cheng Chongshan’s legs turned soft when he heard it, almost falling to the ground.

Didn’t that mean that a time bomb was placed in his body?

“Humph!?How can you, an ant who just ascended, possibly know such a high-level poison? Want to come up with a lie to bluff me, do you think that I’m so gullible?” Cheng Chongshan said threatening in manner, but inwardly shaky.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This still have to thank you! If not for the jade slips that you gave me, I naturally wouldn’t know these. But now, I know.”

The moment these words came out, Cheng Chongshan and Zhao Kun trembled all over at the same time, their eyes revealing a look of astonishment.

“Y-You cracked the jade slips’ restrictions? That’s impossible! Boy, do you take me to be dumb?” Cheng Chongshan said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan smiled and did not speak. Zhao Kun converged his aura and suddenly said, “Junior Apprentice Brother, when you got poisoned, did you feel like there was a volcano erupting within your body, every pore in your body from head to toe seeming like it’s rupturing? No matter how you revolve your divine essence, it would be instantly burned by the poison energy?”

Cheng Chongshan’s gaze revealed a look of astonishment and he cried out in surprise: “S-Senior Apprentice Brother, how did you know?”

Zhao Kun took a deep breath and said, “Sure enough, I think that he shouldn’t be bluffing you! This poison is indeed called Silent Rupture! Furthermore, this poison has no cure!”
