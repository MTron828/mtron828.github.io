Chapter 2490: Dual Polarity

When Ancestor Water saw this scene, he could not help being overjoyed as he said with a loud laugh,?“Hahaha?… Did you see that, Ye Yuan? This is the power of Dao Ancestors! Death is the outcome of you provoking Dao Ancestors!”

“Ye Yuan, you looked down on us eight great progenitors too much! Have you forgotten how many grand ancestors died under our Heavenly Dao True Martial back then?” Yi Feng also said with a cold smile.

In reality, among these five people, the combat strengths of the two great progenitors were even above the three Dao Ancestors.

When they unleashed their full strength, the power was truly boundless.

Only then did the three Dao Ancestors know that previously, Yi Feng two people did not use their full strength at all.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan finally forced out these two people’s hidden strength fully with his formidable strength.

When the Deva powerhouses saw this scene, they could not help sighing heavily.

“Sigh!?Lord Saint Azure was still overly confident!”

“Each of these ancestors is an old monster who has lived for ten billion years. Who doesn’t have some trump card?”

“Lord Saint Azure played too big this time. Not only did he fail to get the fire rule crystal, but also probably even the water rule crystal can’t be protected!”

… …

With regards to the current situation, everyone felt pity for him.

Ye Yuan’s might naturally could be seen clearly.

It was just that, facing the strongest few people in this world, he was a little too overbearingly haughty.

But currently,Ye Yuan who was inside Universe had a calm look. He did not feel panic.

Facing Ancestor Water and Yi Feng’s cynicism, he just said coolly, “You all seem to be very pleased with yourselves! Is this all you have? But I haven’t even used my full strength yet!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of the five great Dao Ancestors changed wildly.

But very soon, Ancestor Water smiled coldly and said,?“Huhu,?did we grow up being intimidated? This move of yours already exerted Sword Dao to the extreme, breaking the joint efforts of Lin Chaotian and Ancestor Fire! This ancestor doesn’t believe that you still have an even stronger move!”

Yi Feng also said, “You’re also looking down on us, these few old fellows, too much!?Huhu,?if you still have some trump card, feel free to use it!”

Not that they did not believe it, but that Ye Yuan’s Universe move was indeed too strong! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

They simply could not imagine what kind of level a sword move that was even stronger than this move would reach.

Ye Yuan nodded slowly and said, “Rest assured, you’ll be able to see it right away!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s Universe actually started spinning.

The originally invulnerable Universe suddenly had an extremely large hole appeared after it started spinning.

When the five great Dao Ancestors saw this scene, their entire bodies shook!

Courting death!

They were currently like flies.

Suddenly seeing a crack on the egg, how could they let it go?

Immediately, their big moves all rumbled towards that gap.

But at the same time, Ye Yuan’s body radiated with a resplendent golden light!

Terrifying dragon might instantly rippled out!

True Dragon Profound Armor!

Ye Yuan’s body was actually covered by a layer of powerful dragon scales.

These dragon scales were all transformed from blood vitality.

Boom!

The five great Dao Ancestors’ big moves bombarded onto this True Dragon Profound Armor in their entirety.

Ye Yuan tasted sweetness at his throat, his innards already sustaining serious injuries.

But he forcefully suppressed his injuries.

The divine essence within his body poured out crazily, injecting into Universe!

Right as Ye Yuan was under attack, Universe already converted into two blades.

The two blades started rotating crazily at this time.

The terrifying cutting edge of the swords directly split the fog into two!

A scent of death instantly diffused in the air.

Originally, the five great Dao Ancestors all had delight on their faces for having inflicted serious wounds on Ye Yuan.

But very soon, their expressions became very ugly!

This was the scent of death!

Ye Yuan really still had a final hit move!

The originally rock-solid and calm Universe revealed its sharp edge at this time, the murderous aura without restraint!

The swift and fierce sword intent was exerted to the extreme at this moment!

Reaching Ye Yuan’s realm, the sword was the intent in his chest, there was no need to deposit it inside a material object.

His divine essence could similarly be a sword!

“Dual Polarity! Kill!” These three words popped out of Ye Yuan’s mouth[1]!

Those crazily spinning two blades cut straight through the air, carrying an incomparably sharp edge!

At this moment, the cutting edge intent of the sword was practically going to slice this Heavenspan Mountain’s cage completely apart!

And this sword was heading straight for Ancestor Water.

Ancestor Water’s heart was almost jumping out. The scent of death hit him head-on.

How many years had it been?

How many years had he not faced the threat of death already?

Ever since corroborating his Dao and becoming an ancestor, death this word seemed to have already left him.

But at this moment, he seemed to have found it again!

How could he dare to have the slightest hesitation? Ancestor Water revolved his divine essence and power of rule madly, attempting to block Dual Polarity.

A Turn of the Tide!

Continuous without ceasing!

Pffft!

Pffft!

No matter how he blocked, Dual Polarity was like a cutting machine. Wherever it passed through, it mowed down all resistance!

Dual Polarity gradually enlarged in his eyes!

Finally,?bang!

Dual Polarity breached his domain and broke through his final layer of defense, completely garroting him!

Places where it passed through, no corpse or bones remained!

Ancestor Water, dead!

“Puhwark!”

Only now did Ye Yuan spurt out a mouthful of fresh blood.

However, he did not care. He said indifferently, “Now, I’m collecting the fire rule crystal. Who else still has objections?”

Each and every one of the remaining four great Dao Ancestors’ complexions turned deathly pale.

They were frightened by this scene earlier!

Ye Yuan killed someone under the siege of five great Dao Ancestors!

Just now, in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, Ye Yuan forcibly resisted the ultimate moves of the five, and executed the swift and fierce to the extreme big move, Dual Polarity!

This kind of strength made people daunted at the sight of it!

The current Ye Yuan was akin to an undefeatable god of war, giving people a feeling of invincibility.

The four great Dao Ancestors actually took several steps back without prior agreement.

“Very well. It seems like nobody has any objection!”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, walked in front of the fire rule crystal, and put it away.

From start to end, not a single one of the four great Dao Ancestors dared to step forward to stop him.

Putting away the fire rule crystal, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Do you all want to continue, or … scram?”

The current Ye Yuan was full of energy when speaking.

Although his aura was somewhat unstable, he did not seem to have suffered too much damage.

Yi Feng’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

Although he was a divine race progenitor and his power was boundless, wanting to kill a Dao Ancestor was not an easy matter.

Defeating and killing were two completely different things!

Dao Ancestors had experienced the baptism of rule crystals. Their strength was more than a magnitude stronger when compared to Grand Ancestors.

“You … You’re really a freak!” Yi Feng gritted his teeth and turned around, merging into the gray fog.

The other person also followed closely behind.

Ancestor Lightning’s expression was ugly as he said, “The five of us struck with our full power, and yet you … you actually only suffered light injuries! C-Consider yourself ruthless! This ancestor will stay a respectful distance from you in the future!”

Finished saying, he also turned around and merged into the gray fog.

When Dao Ancestor Destruction saw Ancestor Lightning leave, he also did not bother to speak, hurriedly running away.

The feeling that Ye Yuan gave them was really extremely monstrous.

Corroborating one’s Dao and becoming an ancestor, this signified eternal life!

To the nine of them, death was already a distant noun.

But now, Ye Yuan had the strength to kill Dao Ancestors.

Furthermore, it was killing Ancestor Water under the besiegement of five great Dao Ancestors!

How strong was this impact on them?

[1] I translated this as Dual Polarity, but it actually means Yin Yang without using the words Yin Yang.
