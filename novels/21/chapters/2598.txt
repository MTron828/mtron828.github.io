Chapter 2604: Great Dao Transformation!

“Between Life and Death!”

Boom!

A domineering saber fell down, Ye Yuan was slammed heavily onto the ground.

Although his saber could not breach Ye Yuan’s defense, it already shocked Ye Yuan until he was seriously injured.

At this rate, Ye Yuan’s defeat was only a matter of time.

Changsun Xingyu’s aura was somewhat chaotic. Wanting to break Ye Yuan’s tortoiseshell, he had to go all out too.

But, seeing Ye Yuan getting abused, his dignity was finally recovered.

Felt awesome!

“Brat, weren’t you very arrogant? Didn’t you want to leave me with an intact corpse? Just based on your wretched appearance currently, you want to defeat me?” Changsun Xingyu looked at Ye Yuan and said full of delight.

He raised his saber again, killing intent piercing cold as he said, “This saber cut is my strongest saber cut! It’s called Illusory Clutch, and I’ll use it to send you on your way!”

Carrying the pinnacle saber intent, Changsun Xingyu rushed over again.

When this saber attacked, everyone’s countenance changed.

This was not an ordinary saber cut, this was a saber cut when Changsun Xingyu’s saber momentum had accumulated to the peak.

This saber cut was the great achievement of his rule comprehension!

The several dozen cuts previously were all just accumulations.

This saber cut was the fatal blow!

Everyone realized that Ye Yuan’s ‘tortoise shell’ was about to be broken!

He Yunxiang shook his head slightly and said, “The difference of a margin, separated by life and death! This saber cut, it should end the battle!”

Everyone nodded one after another, expressing approval.

No one thought that Ye Yuan could still survive under this saber cut.

This one saber cut, it would definitely split a person into two!

A hint of cruelty hung at the corner of Changsun Xingyu’s mouth, arriving in front of Ye Yuan in an instant.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s Universe Sword Formation suddenly withdrew, disappearing.

Changsun Xingyu was stunned.?This guy gave up?

However, he did not hesitate!

When he unleashed his saber, he would not hesitate!

No one realized that a young sprout was currently breaking out of the soil in front of Ye Yuan.

The bud grew very quickly, growing two tender green tree leaves that were very lifelike.

Seemingly sensing Changsun Xingyu’s piercing cold saber intent, one of the green leaves on the sapling actually turned into a sharp sword and stabbed toward Changsun Xingyu!

Boom!

Changsun Xingyu was caught off-guard, only to feel a sword intent that could pierce through the firmament shattered his saber intent and penetrate his body!

“Pffft!”

Changsun Xingyu spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his figure shooting out backward.

This sudden turn of events left everyone stunned.

Changsun Xingyu’s certain-kill saber cut was actually broken just like that?

“This … What’s going on here? That tiny sprout actually defeated Changsun Xingyu’s strongest attack?”

“This guy is too monstrous! At this point, he actually still has a hidden trump card?”

“Are you freaking dumb? That boy clearly comprehended it in the middle of the fight! Really monstrous!”

… …

Just a second ago, no one felt that Ye Yuan could survive under Changsun Xingyu’s saber.

But in a blink, Changsun Xingyu was actually defeated!

They could tell that just based on the power of that strike, Changsun Xingyu already no longer had the power to fight!

The few dozen saber cuts that he hacked Ye Yuan with before were not as strong when compared to this sword of Ye Yuan’s.

It was just that they were very surprised. This sword intent transformed into a tiny sprout. So why would it have such formidable power?

Changsun Xingyu landed on the ground with a loud bang, the frenzied sword intent wreaked havoc within his body.

It was just that he could not care about the injuries on his body. Seeing that young sprout in front of Ye Yuan, he was inexplicably shocked!

“Great Dao Transformation! You … You actually comprehended Great Dao Transformation!” Changsun Xingyu roared wildly[1].

“Yeah. If not for your pressure, my rule fusion would not have been able to achieve the realm of grand completion yet; naturally let alone talk about breaking the cocoon to become a butterfly, Great Dao taking form!” Ye Yuan wiped the bloodstains at the corners of his mouth and said with a faint smile.

Sure enough, under the heavy pressure, he finally still broke through.

Being in the state of life and death, it was easier for people to comprehend certain Great Dao maxims.

Ye Yuan was like that, the powerhouses of this Land of Exile were similarly like so.

It was just that each person’s talent was different; their speed of comprehension and limit were naturally different too.

Changsun Xingyu’s talent was strong. He could perfectly fuse Life and Death Great Dao into his saber intent.

But Ye Yuan’s talent was even stronger than Changsun Xingyu’s!

After his three power of rules was perfected, reaching the realm of harmony and resonance, it broke the cocoon and became a butterfly in the end, comprehending Great Dao Transformation!

“What the hell is Great Dao Transformation?” Everyone was puzzled.

He Yunxiang also had an extremely shocked expression on his face as he said, “Great Dao Transformation is the high-level form of the power of rules! Perfectly fusing the Heavenly Dao that you comprehended into the power of rules, exhibiting Great Dao in some form. This is Great Dao Transformation! You can understand it as the power of rules borrowing the power of Heavenly Dao to release! The power is boundless!”

When everyone heard that, they were incredibly shocked.

The high-level form of the power of rules!

Hearing these few words, they gave a sophisticated and top-grade impression when one heard them!

And they saw the power too.

A young sprout that was seemingly too weak to stand up to a breeze defeated Changsun Xingyu, this supreme powerhouse!

He Yunxiang sucked in a deep breath and said, “Great Dao Transformation, the form varies! Some transform into true spirits, some transform into plants, some transform into celestial phenomena, so on and so forth! Their power is also different! But, even the lousiest Great Dao Transformation, would crush same rank powerhouses too! If not for Changsun Xingyu being too strong and also a minor realm higher than Ye Yuan, he would likely have already been torn limb from limb with that attack just now!”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they heard it.

No one could have thought that this tiny little sprout was actually so terrifying!

Finally, He Yunxiang’s eyes shot out rays of brilliance as he said, “However, I feel that Ye Yuan’s Great Dao Transformation is very strong!”

Even Great Dao Transformation had distinctions of superiority and inferiority too.

Some people transformed into a fierce tiger, seemingly fierce. But their growth ability was actually limited.

While some people transformed into a true dragon, their growth potential was naturally more than a level stronger. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

But Ye Yuan only transformed a tiny stalk of a young sapling, looking too weak to stand up to a breeze, but it was unbelievably strong.

One had to know, Changsun Xingyu was not an ordinary opponent!

His comprehension of the power of rules was only a step away from Great Dao Transformation too!

Cultivation realm plus the power of rule, Changsun Xingyu had practically already reached the limit of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

But Ye Yuan was a minor realm lower than him.

Even if he comprehended Great Dao Transformation, it would be easy to defeat him.

But killing him would not be easy.

However, He Yunxiang saw it clearly.

This blow of Ye Yuan just now did not use his full strength at all!

He only utilized one green leaf and completely defeated Changsun Xingyu!

Then, if he unleashed two green leaves?

Right at this time, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said, “In order to thank you for helping me to comprehend Great Dao Transformation, as well as to fulfill my promise previously, I’ll let you experience the strongest strike of the first form of the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree of the Universe’s first form before you die!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s expressions turned somber.

Changsun Xingyu’s eyes revealed an even more desperate expression. He urged his movement technique, turning into an arrow that left the bowstring, attempting to escape.

And right at this time, Ye Yuan urged the young sprout. Two green leaves shot out in unison!

Puchi!

Changsun Xingyu was directly cut into three pieces!
