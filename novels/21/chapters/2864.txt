Chapter 2870 Blood Imitation Pill!

“Old Fogey Cloudmount, you really accepted a fine disciple!”

“Old Thing, this time, Your Father really has to hand it to you! This battle is satisfying!”

“Old Fogey Cloudmount, this time, you can show off however you like!”

In the Absolute Heaven Barrier, the Hegemons felt an upsurge of emotion too. This kind of unprecedented great victory had never been experienced since the rise of the blood race.

Too satisfying!

These 100 thousand blood race elite soldiers were absolutely not expendable to the blood race too.

After this battle, the blood race had to dial it back too.

“Who said that Your Father is going to show off? Humph! This punk just came to Heaven One Continent for a few years. The contributions that he rendered are even greater than Your Father, this Hegemon Realm! No can do. Your Father has to go beat him, in case he becomes cockier than ever!”

Swoosh!

A stream of flowing light flew out, Hegemon Cloudmount’s clone flew straight for South Qi Giant City.

The faces of the group of Hegemon Realms immediately turned black. This was called not showing off?

If I couldn’t beat you, I’d definitely press you, this old thing, on the ground and rub up and down!

“Ye Yuan? You’re saying that we lost at the hands of a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven? Hang on! Why is this name … a little familiar?”

In the Blood God Temple, Lord Wang Zuo’s face was somewhat stunned.

Clearly, he did not expect that the truth would actually be so surprising.

Originally, South Qi Giant City finally opened up a passageway, and Lord Wang Zuo was very

happy.

Who could have thought that 100 thousand elites actually went and never returned!

He was somewhat unable to accept this result.

A battle that was a certain win actually ended being defeated so thoroughly in the end.

The important thing was that the blood race completely did not know whose hands they were defeated at.

Feng Xiaotian?

Absolutely not!

The blood race was too clear about how much capability Feng Xiaotian had.

Hence, the Blood God Temple activated Heaven One Continent’s intelligence system and finally knew everything.

Ye Yuan!

This name appeared in front of Lord Wang Zuo.

The blood race’s intelligence chief said, “Lord Wang Zuo remembered correctly. The defeat in the battle of Northern View City was precisely because this Ye Yuan came in between. That’s why we fell short of success at the last step! Lord Bloodsky is also seriously wounded and haven’t recovered because of him.”

Lord Wang Zuo’s gaze turned cold, revealing some killing intent!

These two times were both the blood race’s strategic victory. It was actually ruined in the hands of a Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Unprecedented humiliation!

The chief knew that Lord Wang Zuo had killing intent aroused!

“Have you figured out why South Qi’s city protecting grand array would suddenly recover?” Lord Wang Zuo said in a solemn voice.

The chief said, “We figured it out. It was Hegemon Luo Tian’s Lesser Origin Restoration Art! It’s said that this Lesser Origin Restoration Art landed in the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s hands in the end. So this subordinate guessed that this boy might have very likely obtained the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s inheritance!”

Lord Wang Zuo’s pupils constricted, his gaze full of shock.

Labyrinth Divine Palace’s inheritance, these few words seemed to have magical power!

The super great sect that swept across the heavens back then!

Even he, this royal bloodkin, was extremely moved by the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s inheritance too!

“In addition, Heaven One Alliance has already imparted the Lesser Origin Restoration Art all-round to the 108 cities! In the future, if we want to open up a passageway, it will likely … be even harder!” The chief could not help feeling a headache.

Originally, the blood race had already seen the dawn of the Absolute Heaven Barrier being breached.

Who knew that they would actually return to before liberation overnight because of Ye Yuan’s sudden emergence!

Freaking hell … Who to reason this out with?!

Lord Wang Zuo mused for a moment and said in a solemn voice, “Inform the Dark Night to kill Ye Yuan at any cost!”

The chief’s gaze turned intent, being extremely shocked.

Dark Night consisted of bloodkins lying low in Heaven One Continent. It was also him who was responsible for liaison with Dark Night

His information also came from Dark Night.

It was too difficult for the blood race to want to slip into Heaven One Continent through the Absolute Heaven Barrier!

Hence, each one in Dark Night was very precious.

Lord Wang Zuo was actually disregarding all costs for the sake of a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven?] If Ye Yuan strayed outside, that would still be fine. But, if he kept hiding in South Qi Giant City, the price of wanting to kill him would be too great!

Feng Xiaotian was not to be messed with!

……

“What? You … You want to go out of the Absolute Heaven Barrier?”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Hegemon Cloudmount nearly bit his tongue off.

Are you freaking kidding? Your Father doesn’t even dare to go out, and you want to go out?

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “It’s been a few thousand years. The blood race is getting stronger and stronger! But we know nothing about them. At this rate, it’s very bad for us! If my guesses are right, you all are already under tremendous pressure now, right?

More than tremendous!

It was simply Mount Tai crushing down from above!

Having obtained two continents, the blood race acquired countless blood. This was their capital to become strong!

In these few thousand years, the blood race gave birth to five Hegemon Realms!

Heaven One Alliance did not have a single one!

Not only did they not have any, three Hegemon Realms even fell in these few thousand years!

With one declining and the other rising, the Absolute Heaven Barrier was actually in a precarious situation already.

At this rate, the blood race’s Hegemon Realms would get more and more. Even if Heaven One’s Hegemons joined hands, they would not be the blood race’s match anymore as well. At that time, it would be true despair!

Hegemon Cloudmount had a black face as he said, “This has nothing to do with you! What you have to do now is to devote yourself to cultivation and grow your strength! Even if you break through to Emperor Sakra Heaven, it will be of tremendous help to the alliance too!”

This boy was already unbelievably impressive at just Saint Sovereign Heaven.

When he reached Emperor Sakra Heaven, Cloudmount simply did not dare to imagine it.

Perhaps he would be the blood race’s nightmare! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Know yourself and the enemy, and you can fight a hundred battles without danger of defeat. We know absolutely nothing. It’s very dangerous! Only I’m the most suitable to infiltrate the blood race!”

Hegemon Cloudmount’s mouth curled, and he said, “The blood race’s aura is very unique. After you go out of the Absolute Heaven Barrier, you’ll immediately get recognized. The blood race must have already learned about South Qi Giant City’s matter. I think that they would love to have you walk right into a trap at this time.”

Ye Yuan smiled, and suddenly, the aura on his body changed.

A bloody and evil aura emerged from his body.

This aura was actually identical with the blood race!

Seeing ghost!

If not for that Ye Yuan was still chatting with him earlier, he would definitely have smacked Ye Yuan to death with one slap right now!

Hegemon Cloudmount’s eyes became wide saucers and he said in disbelief, “You … How did you do it?”

The blood race’s aura could not be imitated at all.

That kind of aura was derived from bloodline, derived from each cell.

Even if it was a Hegemon Realm, they would not be able to sneak into the blood race too.

Otherwise, the alliance would have long sent people to infiltrate the blood race.

But Ye Yuan actually did it!

A heavenly pill appeared in Ye Yuan’s hand, and he said with a smile, “This is called Blood Imitation Pill. After taking it, one will be able to change their aura from the inside out. Even the blood race will find it hard to discern too. Tsk tsk, the blood race’s blood essence is indeed good stuff!”

During these few years, Ye Yuan collected some blood race blood essence. He naturally would not give up on the research. The Blood Imitation Pill was one of the results!

Hegemon Cloudmount stared at the pill dumbfoundedly. There was indeed only Ye Yuan who could do this!

But sadly, this thing was useless to him.

His cultivation realm was too high! “Alright. Since you’ve already decided, I won’t stop you. However, the blood race is different from Heaven One. You have to be careful!” Hegemon Cloudmount said in a solemn voice.
