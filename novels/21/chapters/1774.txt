Chapter 1778 Heavenly Ghost Incarnation

“You just said earlier that demon races are inherently lowly beings?”Ye Yuan’s eyes turned sharp, his gaze looking at the gray-robed man was icy-cold.

The gray-robed man’s expression changed and he said in a cold voice, “So what? If you dare to kill me, it’s absolutely impossible to escape out of the sundered boundary! I, Sikong Xiu, am the Spirit Controlling Sect’s core disciple! If you dare kill me, the Spirit Controlling Sect won’t let you off!”

At this time, the gray-robed man could only rest his hopes on that the Spirit Controlling Sect’s prestige could suppress Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan said coldly, “Who cares who the hell you are? If you dare to humiliate my brother, there’s only one outcome, and that’s death!”

While talking, Ye Yuan’s thought stirred, that evil spirit’s aura suddenly erupted.

A chill that penetrated to the bones instantly made the temperature in the cave plummet to freezing point.

“Kid, do you really think that we’re lambs waiting to be slaughtered? Our Spirit Controlling Sect is far stronger than you imagine!”

Sikong Xiu gave a cold laugh, powerful soul force spewing out.

When his fellow disciples saw the situation, their expressions became incomparably ugly.

“Senior Apprentice Brother Sikong, we really have to use this move?”

“Yeah, Senior Apprentice Brother Sikong. Using this move, we’ll fall back several minor realms!”

Clearly, the side-effect of this move was immense. Otherwise, Sikong Xiu also would not wait until now before using it.

Sikong Xiu gave a cold laugh and said, “If cultivation realm is gone, it can be cultivated again. Losing your lives, can you all still revive? At this point, do we still have a choice?”

It was not that the rest did not understand this logic. It was just that their own strength was cultivated bitterly. Once it fell, wanting to cultivate it back would have to expend countless times again.

This undoubtedly needed immense courage for them. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

But at this time, they clearly had no options already.

The group of Spirit Controlling Sect disciples’ soul forces virtually burst forth at the same time. These soul forces actually produced a strong resonance.

Ye Yuan looked at this scene with a cold face and said coolly, “Kill!”

The evil spirit emitted a shrill screech, pouncing over toward the Spirit Controlling Sect disciples.

A hint of a cold smile flashed across the corners of Sikong Xiu’s mouth and he said, “How can the might of my Spirit Controlling Sect be what an ant like you can imagine? A measly evil spirit, do you really think that you can take down us? Oh guardian of the sect, Spirit Controlling Sect disciple, Sikong Xiu, offers a sacrifice with soul force and divine essence, to summon the guardian sacred beast!”

The other disciples and Sikong Xiu were the same, chanting away.

Those divine souls dispersed in the air underwent a bizarre change at this time.

An enormous claw that seemingly came from great antiquity probed out of the void!

This enormous claw gave off a powerful aura. It was actually a level stronger than even the evil spirit!

Rumble!

Two mighty rank five powerhouses directly collided together.

But that enormous claw was clearly a notch greater, directly smacking the rank five evil spirit flying with one claw.

That evil spirit’s aura immediately withered significantly.

Then, an enormous beast covered in silver scales all over slowly stepped out of the void.

The behemoth’s body gave off an unfathomable aura.

Ning Tianping’s face changed and he said, “This ... This is the beast soul of a Silverscale Single-Horned Beast! What a powerful beast soul!”

The auras of Sikong Xiu and the rest immediately wilted considerably after this behemoth appeared.

But Sikong Xiu was incomparably excited and said with a big laugh, “Punk, you forced me! This Silverscale Single-Horned Beast is our sect’s guardian sacred beast, a former rank seven powerful existence! Now, suffer his wrath well!”

Tigerheart actually started shuddering in front of this Silverscale Single-Horned Beast’s beast soul.

Even White Light was also deathly pale, akin to facing a great enemy.

“Your Excellency, this ... this Silverscale Single-Horned Beast is too powerful, it’s not what we can rival at all!” Tigerheart said tremblingly.

Ye Yuan looked at that beast soul and said with a cold smile, “Guardian sacred beast? A rank seven powerful existence, but you guys actually wiped away the consciousness of his beast soul and imprisoned him inside the sect, making him unable to reincarnate for all of eternity, guarding the sect generation after generation. This kind of sect, how vicious!”

Dustless saw through with one glance that this beast soul was merely a small portion of the main body.

Clearly, with the strength of these people in front of them, summon at this kind of power was already the limit.

However, the baleful aura on this beast soul was very strong, it did not willingly defend the sect, but it was the Spirit Controlling Sect that imprisoned it in a certain place with a special method, offering it up for the sect disciples to control.

This kind of method was extremely cruel, the beast soul would never reincarnate for all of eternity!

Rank seven divine beast, that was a powerful existence comparable to heavenly empyreans. Each one was an incomparably proud existence, to actually be controlled by a bunch of trash.

This was simply the trampling of dignity to a rank seven divine beast.

Sikong Xiu gave a cold laugh and said, “So what? In the eyes of our Spirit Controlling Sect, fierce beasts and divine beasts are merely slaves provided for martial artists to control! They only need to obey our orders and do things! So what if a rank seven divine beast, isn’t it still a brutish animal?”

Sikong Xiu was not ashamed in the slightest but took pride in it instead.

A rank seven divine beast, what kind of proud existence was it? It actually became a brutish animal out of his mouth.

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, revealing a hint of a chill and he said in a cold voice, “Survival of the fittest in natural selection, this in itself has no cause for much criticism. But your Spirit Controlling Sect’s conduct is too cruel, going against nature and reason, being worse than even animals! You deserve death!”

Sikong Xiu burst into laughter when he heard it and said, “It’s just too bad that you can’t kill me! That evil spirit of yours is too weak!”

Ye Yuan pursed his lips and said with disdain, “Although this divine beast is strong, it’s just a pity that you guys are too weak. The beast soul summoned is merely just initial-stage rank five!”

Sikong Xiu smiled and said, “Heh, dealing with that trash evil spirit of yours, it’s enough! Guardian sacred best, tear that punk into pieces for me!”

“Roar!”

An earth-shaking roar echoed out. That Silverscale Single-Horned Beast raised its enormous claw and smack over towards Ye Yuan.

This claw carried a realm suppress that shocked the soul, powerful to the extreme.

Even though it was just initial-stage rank five, he was once a rank seven powerful existence after all.

That kind of pressure that came from the depths of the soul made people shudder.

Even First Firmament Celestial Deity martial artists absolutely could not survive by a fluke under this claw!

In comparison, Ye Yuan’s evil spirit was much weaker.

“Hahaha, go to hell! A fool who overestimates his ability!”

Ye Yuan looked at this scene coldly, his face not having the slightest change in countenance.

Right at this time, an even more powerful soul force than the Silverscale Single-Horned Beast suddenly burst forth.

“Ghost Dao Hundred Runes, 21st Dao, Heavenly Ghost Incarnation!”

That evil spirit’s body suddenly expanded more than ten times, raised a ghost claw, and smashed over toward the Silverscale Single-Horned Beast.

Bang!

Sikong Xiu’s expression changed drastically, looking at this scene in disbelief.

Only to see the guardian sacred beast that they took great pains to summon dissipate with a loud bang under this punch!

This evil spirit was suddenly more than ten times stronger than before!

“Puu, puu, puu!”

With the guardian sacred beast being defeated, these Spirit Controlling Sect disciples suffered great damage to their minds, all spurting fresh blood wildly, bodies flying out backward.

Sikong Xiu’s expression was struck dumb with amazement as he looked at this scene and said, “This ... This is impossible! How can this evil spirit be so strong?!”
