Chapter 3040: True Labyrinth Divine Palace!

“C-Cleared the stage?” Wang Ningyan looked at the Thousand Souls List and felt blown away.

Yang Qing defeated the Thousand Souls Hall’s 1000 people and cleared the stage!

This battle result seriously made people too proud.

The second place Kong Tan fell in the 934th round.

The third place Feng Qingxuan fell in the 933rd round.

The fourth place Qin Baichuan fell in the 930th round.

The battle results at the back were all very close.

Only Yang Qing’s battle results swept everyone away.

If one still could not tell the difference at the Vertical Heaven Stairs, then in this stage, the gap had already been widened!

“After 900 rounds, those people were all powerful to the extreme. Each round was deadly! How can this guy possibly make it through a thousand rounds?” Zuo Qingyang’s face was full of disbelief.

He also made it to the 913th round, ranking at the 12th place.

But he felt that clearing the stage was an impossible mission.

However, Yang Qing completed it.

Only at this point did these geniuses experience the might of the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Those who entered the Thousand Souls Hall were all the top geniuses of all the heavens. Each one was an exceptional powerhouse.

But none of them could make it to the top 60 of the Thousand Souls Hall!

This was also to say that even if they were in the Labyrinth Divine Palace, they did not count as top-notch too!

The combat power list accumulated over the years was indeed not for show.

But there was one exception.

Yang Qing!

This guy actually defeated everyone and left people far behind in the dust!

This result made everyone feel awful to the extreme.

“On what basis? Based on what that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, this kind of trashy plane, can clear the stage?” Even if it was Qin Baichuan, he was also full of unwillingness to submit at this time.

At this time, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s Thousand Souls Hall.

Yang Qing, who had already been viewed as the chosen rival of the geniuses in all heavens, was currently fired up with boundless enthusiasm.

He used his spear to point at Ye Yuan from afar and said with a loud laugh,?“Hahaha,?Ye Yuan, Emperor Azuresky, I, have finally cleared the stage! Come, fight with me!”

Bang!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, taking several steps back in the row.

Yang Qing’s spear light was directly shattered, being sent flying out,

Yang Qing was defeated!

Ye Yuan said with a sigh of admiration, “You’re really amazing! Right now, if the geniuses of all the heavens meet you in the same rank, they will probably be directly one-shotted by you.”

Yang Qing jumped up and said with a black face, “You’re really despicable! You want to say that you’re more formidable than the other geniuses, is that it?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Yeah! Who asked me to grasp saint force in Emperor Vast Heaven??Uh,?this thing is really useful.”

Yang Qing was speechless.

At this time, Yang Qing’s Myriad Dao Annihilation Spear was more than ten times stronger than before!

Even if Ye Yuan used saint force, it was not as effortless as before anymore too.

But Yang Qing was still not a match.

The methods of Great Beyond powerhouses were really too strong.

If the geniuses from all the heavens were here, their jaws would definitely hit the ground from shock.

This Yang Qing who swept them away was actually being crushed underfoot by another guy! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

A figure condensed in the Thousand Souls Hall.

Heavenless appeared again!

He looked at everyone and said with a smile, “Looks like you guys have a clear understanding of my Labyrinth Divine Palace’s might! Of course, you all don’t need to belittle your own capabilities either. Your talents are indeed pretty good. It’s just a shame that you weren’t born in my Labyrinth Divine Palace! The Thousand Souls Hall stage. It’s still Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven that won the top spot! They have a total of 55,621 people that passed the Thousand Souls Hall’s assessment!”

“What?! T-This is impossible!” Wang Ningyan cried out in surprise.

“This is impossible! How can Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven possibly be more than ten times of us!” Kong Tan did not believe it either.

Someone said, “Ancestor Heavenless, did you make a mistake? Or maybe Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven cheated!”

Thousand Souls Hall this stage was much harder than the Vertical Heaven Stairs.

Even if it was just defeating ten people, it was also not what the average genius could accomplish.

Each round guardian of the Thousand Souls Hall, even if it was Ouyang Fangde, their strength was powerful to the extreme too.

Wanting to win them was easier said than done.

But, a puny little Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, the number that passed was actually more than ten times than theirs!

This number was too scary!

Heavenless said coolly, “This ancestor doesn’t look at the process. I only look at the results! If you guys aren’t convinced, you’ll naturally have a chance to meet them after entering the true Labyrinth Divine Palace! At that time, you all can even have a showdown!”

But Feng Qingxuan’s gaze gradually became bright.

“It must be that guy! Apart from Ye Yuan, nobody can accomplish this! This guy is always able to create miracles.”

By the side, Long He deeply felt that way too and said with a nod, “Apart from him, there should be no one else. He’s probably unranked on the lists in order to bring these people into the Labyrinth Divine Palace.”

“All right. You all don’t need to guess. You’ll be able to meet after entering the passageway at the end of the Thousand Souls Hall!” Heavenless said coolly.

At this time, there was already an additional transmission door since god knows when in the corner of the Thousand Souls Hall.

This transmission door was naturally the passageway to enter the true Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Everyone’s breathing became ragged.

The true treasure was still in the Labyrinth Divine Palace!

So what if they fell behind a little in the Thousand Souls Hall?

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

One figure after another moved. They were too impatient to wait, entering the passageway.

… …

“That’s … Divine Citron Fruit! Swallowing one is equal to 3000 years of bitter cultivation!”

“That’s Mystic Sand Nine Sun Weed, the core ingredient for the Great Trichiliocosm Heavenly Fate Pill! It already can’t be found at all in the outside world!”

“That is …”

A series of exclamations came from the crowd.

It was simply a land of treasures under this sky.

Many heavenly medicines and precious treasures that could not be seen in the outside world could be seen everywhere here!

When the geniuses from all the heavens saw these, each and every one of their eyes turned red.

“Hahaha?… The Labyrinth Divine Palace is indeed well-deserving of being the number one sect! This place is simply paradise!”

“Cultivating here, why worry about not being able to reach Hegemon Realm?”

“This trip indeed wasn’t in vain! Rich! Rich!”

… …

Everyone seemed to have gone crazy. Many people directly rushed towards those treasures.

Boom!

Those who charged right at the front were directly killed.

Kong Tan’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces, and he said coldly, “This fiend hasn’t even opened my mouth. When is it your turn?”

Kong Tan naturally did not come alone. The fiend race powerhouses behind him reached as many as a thousand people.

When the others saw the situation, they immediately withered up.

Kong Tan laughed coldly and said, “Go. Collect all the heavenly medicines in this area!”

“Hur hur,?with so many heavenly medicines, it’s enough to even cultivate to Supreme Hegemon! Kong Tan, aren’t you too greedy?”

A peerlessly beautiful figure appeared. Who could it be if not Feng Qingxuan?

There were similarly one to two thousand true spirits following behind her.

Long He and the rest were shockingly in the ranks.

Kong Tan said coolly, “Feng Qingxuan, my fiend race has always been overbearing! We’ll be taking these heavenly medicines! If you’re not convinced, talk again after fighting.”

Feng Qingxuan sneered and said, “Kong Tan, do you think that you’re invincible because you’re second on the Thousand Souls List?”

Kong Tan smiled and said, “At least I’m a little stronger than you, this number three!”

Feng Qingxuan smiled and said, “We’re about on par. But you probably don’t know that my relationship with Yang Qing isn’t ordinary!”

Kong Tan’s pupils constricted, revealing a look of vigilance.
