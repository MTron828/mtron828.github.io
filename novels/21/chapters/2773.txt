Chapter 2779: Immense Wealth

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On Flowing Cloud Peak at Martial Secure Heavenly Sect.

Ye Yuan stood in the air, three rules revolving around him indeterminately.

But these three power of rules became distinct from each other and were unable to merge.

Buzz!

The three power of rules dissipated with a loud bang. Ye Yuan looked into the distance, his eyes somewhat in a daze.

Sure enough, it still could not work!

“Master Ye, it still doesn’t work?” Big Yellow said with a guilty look.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “There seems to be an invisible barrier between the rules. Furthermore, I’m unable to sense the power of rules anymore.”

Being unable to sense the power of rules meant no longer being able to cultivate!

A peerless heaven’s chosen of his generation was actually unable to cultivate. How great a blow did this have to be!

Big Yellow’s expression changed, and he said, “Master Ye, it … it’s all Big Yellow’s fault for being useless!”

Ye Yuan looked at Big Yellow and said with a smile, “This enmity is my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s enmity. It has nothing to do with the Myriad Demons Mountain. This Ye is already endlessly grateful that you all could act to help me. This has nothing to do with you all.”

“B-But, Master Ye, you …” Big Yellow felt his heart ache.

He desperately wanted to follow Ye Yuan’s footsteps, but in the end, Ye Yuan blocked the deadly blow for them, resulting in him sustaining serious injuries.

If not for this, Ye Yuan also would not have gone so far as to kill Li Changsheng with the transformation sword as the price.

Martial Secure’s battle shocked the continent!

With Ye Yuan killing Changsheng with one sword, this was passed from mouth to mouth with approbation in the entire continent.

It was also this sword that ended the Pill Alliance’s rule, completely liberating the various major sects.

For some time, Ye Yuan’s prestige had no equal.

But, extremely few people knew that after this battle, Ye Yuan could no longer cultivate.

Losing Heavenly Dao’s approval, one would be a cripple!

Ye Yuan was not discouraged and smiled, saying with boundless heroism, “I, Ye Yuan, have always been going against heaven throughout my life! My Dao doesn’t need anyone to approve it!”

Big Yellow looked at Ye Yuan in a daze, somewhat absent-minded for a while.

Ye Yuan’s performance was far from what he imagined. There was actually no decadent at all.

The more one was a heaven’s chosen, the harder it would be to bear it after encountering this sort of blow, never to recover henceforth.

But Ye Yuan behaved like it had nothing to do with him.

It was not just that. He felt that Ye Yuan seemed to have more drive and was more spirited than before!

Could it be that this guy did not know that he could no longer cultivate?

“What did they all say about my proposal?” Ye Yuan did not care about this and asked Big Yellow.

But Big Yellow frowned and said with displeasure, “This bunch of guys are really ingrates! If not for Master Ye, they would have long died! Now, they actually don’t even agree to this little request!”

Ye Yuan seemed to have long expected it and said coolly, “What did they say?”

Big Yellow said indignantly, “They said that ascenders are ascenders. They are bumpkins! Now, the five great heavenly sects exist only in name. They can give them a place for the sects. The rest have to be handed over! Furthermore, they will strictly control ascenders!”

After the great battle, Ye Yuan proposed that the Rainclear Continent no longer be divided into native factions and ascenders in the future.

Ascenders could enter the major heavenly sects to cultivate.

Presently, of the Five Light Heavenly Region’s former five great heavenly sects, there was only Luo Yunqing, one Saint Sovereign Heaven left.

Ascender Saint Sovereign Heavens only had a scanty three people too.

And native Saint Sovereign Heavens occupied an absolute advantage.

Therefore, they did not want to share with ascenders the benefits at all, wanting to take the opportunity to completely throttle ascenders dead.

It was also that they were somewhat apprehensive of the Myriad Demons Mountain behind Ye Yuan. Otherwise, they would have probably directly shed all pretenses of cordiality.

Once Li Changsheng died, all parties lost the common enemy. These Saint Sovereign Heavens started pursuing their own interests one after another.

Of course, the more important reason was that they knew that Ye Yuan had already become a cripple.

Although the current Ye Yuan was still Saint Sovereign Heaven Realm, he was unable to execute Great Dao Transformation, his combat power being greatly reduced.

They were no longer afraid of Ye Yuan.

A genius with no future, then there was nothing to fear.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Have you found the Pill Alliance’s headquarters?”

Big Yellow said, “Found it!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Come, go take a look!”

… …

A group of people landed among green mountains and blue waters with unstoppable momentum.

Saint Exalt Waycloud, Saint Exalt Skyfortune, Saint Exalt Bull Demon, and many top powerhouses were shockingly present.

The place was called Chilian Gorge, a very remote place.

No one thought that Li Changsheng actually set the headquarters up here.

However, at this time, the gazes of Saint Exalt Waycloud and the rest when looking toward Ye Yuan was somewhat strange and a little … contemptuous.

The atmosphere was a little awkward.

“Tsk tsk,?Li Changsheng this fellow is really capable, setting up such a large formation, completely covering up the mountain pass gates. If not for fumbling over through the transmission array, we couldn’t have found it at all!” Saint Exalt Waycloud said.

With regards to Li Changsheng’s means, they still rather admired it.

Regardless of whether it was alchemy or the Eight Legions War Generals, or currently this mountain pass gates, all of them demonstrated his power.

Saint Exalt Skyfortune said, “We raided 14 Pill Alliance’s branches and obtained great benefits! However, over these ten thousand years, most of the wealth that Li Changsheng accumulated is likely hidden in this place. Most likely … it’s an astronomical figure!”

With the Pill Alliance being destroyed, the 14 branches had no leader and could naturally be at other people’s mercy.

The group of saint exalts were not courteous either, completely wiping out the 14 branches, obtaining tremendous benefits.

But everyone knew that the real treasure was here!

The group of Saint Sovereign Heavens was brave due to their great ability, and they directly barged into the mountain pass gates.

With Saint Sovereign Heavens being completely wiped out, everyone in the Pill Alliance had long since dispersed.

At this time, it was a wasteland at the mountain pass gates.

The group of powerhouses turned the Pill Alliance upside down and finally found a cave in the back mountain.

Powerful restrictions were placed outside of the cave.

Breaking these restrictions were nothing to the Saint Sovereign Heavens present.

The party entered the cave, and each and every one of them was immediately stunned.

As far as the eyes could see, there were countless precious treasures in the cave!

Countless heavenly crystals were piled up everywhere!

The wealth here could really be described using astronomical numbers!

When the Saint Sovereign Heavens saw these treasures, their eyes turned green. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The powerhouses present had never seen before so much fortune in their lives.

“This Li Changsheng is really unscrupulous, to have actually accumulated such a frightening wealth!” Saint Exalt Waycloud exclaimed.

Everyone nodded one after another. This wealth added up was even more than the ones obtained in the Labyrinth Divine Palace!

Using this wealth to nurture another several dozen Saint Sovereign Heavens was more than plenty!

“Now, shouldn’t we discuss how to allocate these fortunes?” Saint Exalt Skyfortune said.

Saint Exalt Waycloud gave Ye Yuan a meaningful glance and said with a smile, “Although these fortunes are Li Changsheng’s, they are actually all plundered from our various major heavenly sects! Therefore, I suggest to distribute these fortunes with the strength of the sects!”

Saint Exalt Skyfortune smiled coldly and said,?“Huhu,?Waycloud, you really calculated well! In this place, your Seven-star Heavenly Sect is the strongest. You mean that you’re taking the largest share?”

Apart from Saint Exalt Waycloud, the Seven-star Heavenly Sect still had another Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

Therefore, they were the strongest!

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s distribution method was naturally the Seven-star Heavenly Sect gaining a big advantage. How could the others be willing to comply?
