Chapter 2771: Fighting Against Zhao Ding!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Is Guo Huai a pig? A living person actually fumbled until he reached the transmission array, and Guo Huai didn’t even discover him!” Within the Pill Alliance’s main hall, Li Changsheng appeared somewhat exasperated.

With the transmission array being destroyed, they were unable to support in time no matter how fast they were.

By the time they rushed to Bright Sun Branch, there was only a dilapidated mountain pass gate left there already.

Bright Sun Branch being leveled to the ground, this was not just the loss of a branch.

The greater significance was affecting the rule of the Pill Alliance!

It was not that the Five Great Heavenly Regions did not have Saint Sovereign Heavens. It was just that these people were all deterred by the Pill Alliance’s might and did not dare to take any action. That was all.

But now, Ye Yuan’s face-slapping action already shook the foundation of the Pill Alliance’s rule.

Once danger erupted all-round, it would not be easy to control!

Below, a group of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were silent like cicadas in winter, not daring to make a sound.

Each and every one of them was extremely shocked too!

No one expected that Ye Yuan could actually fumble his way to where the transmission array was located without a sound.

One had to know, in this process, Ye Yuan had to face the mountain protecting grand array, had to face countless patrolling powerhouses, and even had to face many trigger restrictions.

Any slip-ups and it would be impossible to accomplish.

Yet, Ye Yuan did it!

“Search for me! Even if you dig three feet below the ground, you also have to find this punk for this chief!” Li Changsheng said with a cold yell.

“This … General Alliance, that brat is all alone by himself and also proficient in spatial rule, he … can’t be found at all! After that boy destroyed the Bright Sun Branch, he completely vanished. We’ve already sent people out, but there isn’t any news at all!”

The one who spoke was the Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse that was in charge of the Pill Alliance’s information gathering. He also had a massive headache now.

Ye Yuan destroyed the Bright Sun Branch all alone by himself. Randomly burrowing into some mountain or forest, it would be like searching for a needle in a haystack for them.

Unless Ye Yuan willingly exposed himself, otherwise, they had no way of taking action at all.

Li Changsheng’s expression turned cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “Then you all stay in the transmission array passageways for me! As long as that punk shows his face, everyone immediately provides assistance! If there are any more accidents, you all will be held accountable!”

… …

A month later, Ye Yuan’s figure appeared in the sky above Martial Secure Branch again.

He was even carrying the dead-dog-like Guo Huai in his hand. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In this one month’s time, Ye Yuan had been preparing to transcend the tribulation!

He had confidence in transcending the tribulation, but he must prepare amply.

“H-Hahaha,?little bastard, see if you still don’t die this time!” Guo Huai had blood in his mouth as he laughed miserably.

In this one month, he had been by Ye Yuan’s side. That sort of vague sense of danger made him close to despair.

Even he, this outsider, felt the horrifying crisis.

It went even more without saying for Ye Yuan himself.

Bang!

Ye Yuan ignored him and directly threw Guo Huai to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

He even conveniently sealed his throat, making him unable to speak.

“Zhao Ding, come out and prepare to die!” Ye Yuan shouted loudly.

Swoosh!

Zhao Ding appeared in front of Ye Yuan right away.

Seeing Guo Huai’s miserable appearance, the corners of Zhao Ding’s mouth could not help twitching slightly.

Guo Huai was very strong. Breaking through to middle Saint Sovereign Heaven in the future was virtually a sure bet.

Now, he was actually directly crippled.

“Ye Yuan, you actually still dare to come!” Zhao Ding said in a solemn voice.

“Is there anywhere in this world that I don’t dare to go to? Since I came once, I naturally dare to come a second time. What can you do to me?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Zhao Ding smiled coldly and said, “In front of this exalt, you can only cover your head and scurry away! You’re merely a gutless coward!”

Ye Yuan was goading Ye Yuan, buying time.

During this period of time, all the Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses had been guarding beside the transmission arrays.

When he came out just now, he had already sent the news out.

Right now, all of the Pill Alliance’s Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were currently gathering over here.

As long as Ye Yuan was surrounded, even if he had exceedingly formidable abilities, he would definitely die beyond a doubt too!

Ye Yuan seemed to be unable to stand the goading and said with a cold smile, “Such a clumsy goading technique, do you think that I can’t tell??Huhu,?today, I’ll fight with you! So what if middle Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

Zhao Ding laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Brat, you dare to face this exalt head-on?! This exalt will kill you in ten exchanges!”

Facing Ye Yuan, he did not dare to shoot his mouth off either.

Ye Yuan’s movement technique was too fierce. Even in a frontal battle, he could forget about killing Ye Yuan in a few moves.

To be able to make Zhao Ding say such words, the Martial Secure Branch also exclaimed in amazement at Ye Yuan’s strength.

One had to know, Jade Sovereign heavens were like ants in front of a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven!

However, seeing that Ye Yuan did not have the intention of escaping, Zhao Ding was overjoyed in his heart.

This brat really had no idea of death or danger!

There was no need to have too many. As long as five Saint Sovereign Heavens arrived, even if Ye Yuan had spatial rule, he could forget about escaping too!

Zhao Ding was secretly rejoicing, but Guo Huai in front of the mountain pass gates was struggling endlessly.

He wanted to inform Zhao Ding to hurry up and retreat. But he struggled until his face turned completely red, and he could not speak either.

At present, he was already a cripple. No one from the Pill Alliance came to acknowledge him. He could only be anxious but unable to do anything.

“Huhu,?is that so? Zhao Ding, you and I have a deep enmity like the sea. Today, I’ll kill you in front of Martial Secure’s mountain pass gates to pay homage to the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s dead souls that had passed on!”

Ye Yuan had his palm out. The Myriad Realms Mountain already appeared in his hand.

Feeling the powerful undulations coming off of the Myriad Realms Mountain, Zhao Ding revealed a solemn expression too.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan was not long-winded either, arriving not far from Zhao Ding with a flash, his movement technique even faster than thought!

“True Soul Explosion!”

Ye Yuan roared loudly, casting an origin divinity attack straight away.

Buzz!

Zhao Ding was on guard long ago and already activated the Vajra Dharma Body.

But, even so, his origin divinity still felt the explosion-like attack, his entire person coming to a standstill for an instant.

What Ye Yuan wanted was this instant!

At this time, the Myriad Realms Mountain in his hand had already accumulated momentum and was awaiting release.

At the first moment he executed the origin divinity attack, it smashed toward Zhao Ding.

After a momentary lapse, an intense sense of crisis welled up in Zhao Ding’s heart.

Virtually instinctively, he escaped into the void.

Boom!

The place where Zhao Ding was standing, the void exploded!

The terrifying undulation shocked the Martial Secure Branch’s disciples until they fell flat on their backs.

And at the same time, Ye Yuan’s expression changed greatly too, an extremely dangerous aura coming from behind.

He immediately escaped into the void without turning his head back.

Bang!

The place where Ye Yuan was standing exploded with a loud bang!

Ye Yuan tasted sweetness in his throat and immediately spurted a mouthful of fresh blood, already sustaining serious injuries.

A jade ornament emitted a faint light in Zhao Ding’s hand.

This jade ornament was precisely a grandmist treasure!

Zhao Ding had long already hidden the jade ornament in the void in order to plot against Ye Yuan.

After Ye Yuan came over, he suddenly launched a sneak attack.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan’s reaction was extremely fast. Otherwise, he would have directly kicked the bucket with this!

However, Zhao Ding felt awful too.

His aura was very disorderly. Clearly, he had suffered light injuries too.

Even if he evaded the Myriad Realms Mountain’s blow, the power of a grade two grandmist treasure transmitted into the void too, injuring Zhao Ding.

It was just that the two people’s realms were different. Their defensive strength naturally had a great disparity too.

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, the two people exchanged a blow.

They were evenly matched!
