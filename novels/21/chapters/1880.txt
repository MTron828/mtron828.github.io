Chapter 1884: Stubborn Child

“Heh, then polish your move a bit more, see what I’ve prepared for you!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove kneaded seals with both hands, the other World Suppressing Stele below him suddenly erupted with an incomparably horrifying energy.

That imposing momentum was actually not the slightest bit weaker than Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s!

When Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang saw the situation, he smiled faintly and said, “Just this bit of strength? Indeed much stronger than peak Empyrean. But you wouldn’t think that this kind of strength can kill me, right?”

“Is that so?”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laughed coldly, the seals in his hands moving once more.

Suddenly, that World Suppressing Stele rose up from the ground and suspended in the air, emitting an incomparably dazzling light,

That World Suppressing Stele’s power was actually strengthening at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s expression turned slightly dark and suddenly released his aura. A terrifying might of Heavenly Dao suddenly descended.

Dense blue patterns reverberated in the air!

Seeing those blue patterns, Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted.

This thing, he was too familiar!

Divine vestiges!

Turns out that Heavenly Emperor powerhouse could actually control Heavenly Emperor divine vestiges!

While at the same time, blue divine vestiges similarly burst forth from inside that World Suppressing Stele.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s face finally produced a trace of visible change in countenance.

“Haha ... Jiu Shang, didn’t expect it, right?! On this empyrean’s deathbed, I already glimpsed Great Dao and controlled divine vestiges! It’s just a shame that my body at that time was already a heavy burden on me. Otherwise, how could there still be the you today?”

Amidst Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s laughter, it was filled with unwillingness and full of indignation.

He was well-deserving of being a peerless genius among Empyreans, to actually be able to touch the threshold of Heavenly Emperor before death; only a step away from attaining Heavenly Emperor.

What kind of existence were Heavenly Emperors?

The realm of Dao Ancestors could not be fathomed, while the realm of Heavenly Emperor was the ruler of this Heavenspan World!

This was a transcendent existence, an existence that towered above all life!

He was of course unwilling!

“This Empyrean extracted the primordial energy within two empyrean spirit treasures, hoarding five million years worth of world power, for the sake of this strike today! You, prepare to die!” Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laughed wildly and said.

Rumble!

Dense fissure started appearing in the entire Immortal Grove World. Endless spatial turbulent flows started pouring into the Immortal Grove World frenziedly through these rifts.

The Immortal Grove World was currently walking towards death,

These horrifying energies aren’t what the Immortal Grove World can withstand at all.

Countless mortals were devoured by the spatial rifts in this instant, losing their lives.

Once a Heavenly Emperor was enraged, corpses would float for ten thousand mils!”

This kind of rhetoric already could not describe the tragedy of this moment.

Ye Yuan’s heart was dripping blood. He already could not use words to describe the feelings in his heart at this moment.

With his current strength, he could not stop the confrontation of these two mighty Heavenly Emperor powerhouses at all!

Suddenly, his gaze turned sharp and he said to Dustless, “Senior, can I communicate with the Immortal Grove World through the World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl now?”

Dustless nodded and said, “Of course you can! But ... right now at this time, it’s too dangerous! Once the world crumbles, your divine soul will also be torn to shreds!”

“Can’t care that much anymore! If the Immortal Grove World is destroyed, I’d rather die!” Ye Yuan said with the slightest hesitation.

Dustless had spent a long time together with Ye Yuan and naturally knew his temper. He heaved a sigh and said, “Fine, I’ll help you! But, promise me, once the matter cannot be done, you must get away in time!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, consciousness directly sinking into the two great empyrean spirit treasures.

The World Suppressing Stele and Soul Suppressing Pearl, these two treasures, had long already become an inseparable part of the Immortal Grove World.

Under Dustless’s help, Ye Yuan’s entire consciousness merged into the Immortal Grove World very quickly.

At this very moment, his entire person became a part of the Immortal Grove World.

That sort of feeling was very magical, as if he was this world.

“Ugh ...”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, a wave of sharp pain immediately transmitting over to his consciousness.

It was as if his entire divine soul was being torn into countless pieces.

Inside Ye Yuan’s divine sea, chaos divine essence and blue divine marks crept out, entering straight into the sea of consciousness!

...

Fang Tian looked at the dark sky, looked at those endless spatial cracks, a look of despair on his face.

“Looks like Ye Yuan can’t save us again this time! The Immortal Grove World is going to be destroyed!”

Skydistant had an ashen look as he said, “We’re really too useless. Every single time, we need Ye Yuan to come and save! I also have no idea how he is right now.”

Fang Tian said helplessly, “That level of fight, Ye Yuan probably can’t intervene at all too. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be this current situation. How are Ye Yuan’s parents?”

Skydistant said, “Relax, arrangements have long been made. As long as the Immortal Grove World isn’t destroyed, they will be fine.”

Fang Tian let out a sigh and said, “Currently, this degree of destruction, the Immortal Grove World’s casualties have likely already reached above 50%, countless lives turning to ashes! Destruction is likely an irrecoverable thing already. Once the world utterly crumbles, even you and I have no possibility of surviving too!”

The two people were just talking when that intense tremor of the earth actually gradually showed signs of stabilizing.

Those continuously growing spatial cracks actually started gradually recovering!

Fang Tian’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in shock, “This ... What’s going on here?”

Skydistant had a look of pleasant surprise as he said, “Hahaha! It must be Ye Yuan! It must be Ye Yuan! Looks like we still have hope!”

Fang Tian’s face also revealed an expression akin to being relieved of a heavy burden. He sighed and said, “It’s really been hard on Ye Yuan!”

Everyone’s faces all revealed looks of pleasant surprise.

Except, they did not know what kind of anguish Ye Yuan was enduring at this moment.

...

“Puhwark!”

A horrifying undulation came over, Ye Yuan immediately spewed out a large mouthful of fresh blood.

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang glanced sideways and said smilingly, “Huhu, this disciple of yours is really a stubborn child! For the sake of your small world, he actually doesn’t even want his life anymore!”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove gave a cold laugh and said, “Want to use him to make this empyrean waver? It’s no use! You must die today!”

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang laughed and said, “That might not be so! As long as I can obtain the World Suppressing Stele, so what if I pay some price?”

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laughed wildly and said, “Is that so? Jiu Shang, savor well this big gift that this Empyrean spent five million years to prepare for you!”

“Heaven ... Sundering ... Finger!”

In front of Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, Dao vestiges revolved, condensing to form the appearance of a finger; incomparably corporeal.

That horrifying aura, heaven and earth trembled from it!

Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang’s face finally revealed a hint of solemnness.

His aura also finally rose to the peak.

“Old Fart Immortal Grove, this emperor really admires you! I didn’t expect that you’re already dead and can actually still leave behind such a terrifying contingency plan! However ... it’s probably not enough for you to want to use it to kill me!” Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang said with a solemn expression.

Only to see him knead seals with both hands. A ring on Jiu Shang’s hand suddenly erupted with a berserk energy, boundless black gas surrounding his body.

And the Dao vestiges around him immediately flourished significantly as well.

“Brahma True Fiend! True Fiend Dharma Idol!”

An enormous black shadow blocked in front of Jiu Shang.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s face changed and he cried out in shock, “H-Heavenly emperor spirit treasure! You actually have a heavenly emperor spirit treasure!”
