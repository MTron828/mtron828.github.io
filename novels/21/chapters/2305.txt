Chapter 2309: Dao Heart Collapse!

“What’s going on here? A world that already collapsed actually recovered anew!”

The few great ancestors suddenly stood up, looking at that medicinal pill with shocked faces.

The medicinal pill that had originally already had its shape fixed actually burst forth with a terrifying power once again.

This surge of power seemed like it rose up from ruins, radiating with youthful vitality anew.

This kind of method achieved the same wondrous effect as Heavenly Emperor Distantbook birthing spirit medicines bare-handedly with different means.

However, it was no idea how many times more advanced!

This was a broken world being bestowed vitality anew.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s entire body trembled, looking at that medicinal pill in a daze.

The medicinal pill shattered from the inside, remolded, shattered again, and remolded again.

A complete world gradually outlined and formed.

Finally, a spherical and transparent medicinal pill was re-displayed in front of the world.

Medicinal pill, not some shocking medicinal pill, but a down-to-earth Dao pill that gave off a world power that shocked people to the core.

Everyone was shocked speechless!

This kind of means was simply inconceivable!

“How is this possible? Heavenly Emperor Distantbook clearly occupied a tremendous advantage! How can it become like this?” Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove could not figure it out after racking his brains.

Suddenly, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook trembled all over, gaze staring fixed at Ye Yuan and he said, “Fine means! Indeed a good method! You avoided the sharp edge and didn’t confront this emperor head-on, integrating your Great Dao into the Dao pill under this emperor’s eyes! You planted a seed in the Dao pill, but after everything settled down, it broke through the earth and emerged again! During the battle, you could perform such minute manipulation and have such a brilliant idea, this emperor ... admires!”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s realm was not what others could compare to.

When everything erupted, he understood Ye Yuan’s method very quickly.

It was just that understanding was one thing. But to defeat Ye Yuan? He was already powerless to stop it.

With his strength, if he discovered Ye Yuan’s means during the alchemy battle, he could naturally crush it effortlessly.

But there were no ifs in this world.

That moment when he won, he was actually already defeated!

Moreover, talking about it was easy, but doing it was difficult to the extreme. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook knew all too clearly that being able to perform such a hair-raising operation under his eyelids, one really could not find a second person in this world!

The title of Second Sage was well-deserved!

Hearing Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s words, the group of ancestors was horrified.

There was actually still such a play?

“J-Just what is this guy’s brain made out of?” Ancestor Yi Xian said in shock.

“Heh, this isn’t just a matter of brain! If it were you and me, even if we can think of this method, can you hide from Distantbook’s eyes and ears? Even if you hid from his eyes and ears, do you have the ability to perform such subtle manipulation?” Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove said with a solemn look.

Ancestor Yi Xian opened his mouth but did not say anything. He did not know how to follow up.

Just as Old Fart Maplegrove said, he could not do it!

Only then did they understand that even if Ye Yuan’s comprehension of Dao pill realm was almost the same as them, they were absolutely not Ye Yuan’s match either.

This guy was too strong!

No one expected that Ye Yuan defeated the strong as the weak, defeating such a powerful Heavenly Emperor Distantbook.

Cloudheart Realm’s powerhouses collectively shut up.

Just now, they were screaming the most spiritedly, but who could have thought that in a blink, their faces would be slapped resoundingly.

In the crowd, Zou Rui had a dazed look.

Just earlier, he was still mocking Yun Yi two people endlessly.

That imposing momentum was all too arrogant.

But in a twinkle, an astonishing reversal happened to the situation.

His grandmaster was defeated!

This reversal came too quickly, swift until he could not react in time.

As the young generation’s number one person, he was also someone who wanted face.

The words that one said were like water that was splashed.

So awkward!

Zou Rui could not resist sneaking a glance at the two, but then he discovered that the two people were currently looking at him meaningfully.

With a rush, his face instantly turned red.

Yun Yi two people did not answer back sarcastically, it was just that their smiles, the lethality overwhelmed thousands of words.

“What are you guys smiling at? Using this kind of opportunistic method, what ability does it count as!” Zou Rui turned angry from embarrassment as he said.

“Ohhh ...” Yun Yi two people exchanged a glance, deliberately dragged the tone out, making it even more sarcastic.

Zou Rui was greatly embarrassed. If these two had a war of words with me, it was still fine. Yet, this cynical way of speaking that dripped with sarcasm made him virtually go crazy!

“You guys ... you guys! Humph!

Just you guys wait and see!”

“Ohh ...”

“... ...”

Zou Rui was utterly defeated. He secretly swore in his heart. As long as he ran into these two fellows, he would definitely teach them a lesson.

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Emperor Distantbook and said with a faint smile, “I know that you’re unconvinced in your heart and feel that you definitely won’t lose to me if you go again, isn’t that so?”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook gave a cold snort and did not speak.

In reality, he meant exactly that. It was just that he was embarrassed to open his mouth.

Losing was losing. Saying whatever fight again could only lower one’s own status.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’re stronger than me; this point is irrefutable. This Ye also admits that going again, I absolutely won’t be your match. But so what? Your Dao lost to my Dao. Isn’t that so?”

“Your Dao is unparalleledly domineering, looking down on everything and everyone! Therefore, it’s not that you were careless, but that it’s your Dao which destined that you won’t notice it! Because you won’t pay attention to a stalk of measly little spirit medicine. Because it’s just a tool in your hands, a tool to defeat me. Even if it’s created by you!”

“But I can bestow it new life and give it what it wants! How do you know that it wasn’t it that helped me to hide from you? A solid dyke can collapse because of an ant hole in it, something that you tend to not pay attention to could give you a fatal blow. Timing, geographical, and human conditions, you don’t occupy a single one. So how can you beat me?”

Ye Yuan’s words were loud and clear, trampling Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s pride onto the ground ruthlessly.

Nobody could find any fault with his words.

Losing means losing!

Competing again did not have any meaning at all.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook being strong was just because his accumulations were stronger than Ye Yuan, that was all.

But Ye Yuan’s Dao indeed surmounted above Heavenly Emperor Distantbook.

As long as his accumulations were sufficient, catching up, even surpassing Heavenly Emperor Distantbook in the future, was not something impossible.

No, it was for sure!

The height of Dao determined the height of achievement.

Ye Yuan’s Dao was stronger than Heavenly Emperor Distantbook, surpassing him in the future was a sure thing.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s expression flickered incessantly, staring at Ye Yuan fiercely, surging with killing intent.

Ye Yuan was destroying his Dao heart!

He understood, but he could not stop it!

A flaw still showed in his Dao heart.

Every person was extremely devout toward their own Dao.

But once you had doubts about it, that was the start of one’s Dao heart collapse.

Everyone held their breath, including the ancestors.

Ye Yuan’s guts were really too big, to actually destroy the number three person’s Dao heart in Cloudheart Realm so openly and brazenly.

But everyone also understood that Ye Yuan doing so had no cause for much criticism.

Because the objective of Heavenly Emperor Distantbook making a move was obviously to strike at Ye Yuan’s Dao heart!

Now that Ye Yuan won, he had no need to show mercy.

Be that as it may, this place was Cloudheart Realm, the bodhidharma of the Medicine Ancestor!
