Chapter 2548: Please Start Your Performance!

Everything was ready. An alchemy battle without any suspense officially started.

Actually, everyone including Lu Yun and Tang Yu did not have much confidence in Ye Yuan.

This brag was too over the top!

If it was just refining a heavenly pill to prove the Tang Family’s innocence, they still had some confidence.

But the opponent was Nation Teacher, Eastward alchemy path’s number one person!

This difficulty was too great!

However, at that moment when the origin divinity contract was signed, Tang Yu father and son almost shed tears.

They knew that Ye Yuan only did this in order to vent his frustration for him.

He even wagered his own life!

Ye Yuan could naturally escape, but he did not.

He fought to the bitter end with Nation Teacher in order to help the Tang Family seek justice!

How could they not be moved?

As distance tested a horse’s strength, time revealed a person’s heart! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was talking about this, right?

“Brat, you say that you’re a heavenly alchemist. Then what heavenly pill do you want to compete in?” Lin Lan said with a cold smile.

“I only know the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!” Ye Yuan said calmly.

He said it so naturally and righteously.

Everyone had stunned faces. Following that, they burst into another wave of roaring laughter.

Lin Lan saw that Ye Yuan had always had a calm and collected appearance. He even thought that Ye Yuan really had some heaven-defying ability.

After a farce, he actually only knew how to refine the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill!

Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was the most basic heavenly pill. The refining difficulty was the lowest.

To a grade two heavenly alchemist like Lin Lan, refining a Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was like playing around.

Furthermore, his quality was several times stronger than grade one heavenly alchemists!

Ye Yuan competing in the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill with him, wasn’t this looking for abuse?

“It’s over! This time, it’s really over!” A look of despair was revealed in Tang Yu’s eyes.

Second Prince gritted his teeth, and he said in a low voice, “Master Yun, is this the person that you bet on? How will he win now? Even if he can really refine a heavenly pill, how can he possibly beat Nation Teacher?”

Lu Yun also had a stunned look and actually had nothing to say in reply.

He also somewhat doubted whether he bet wrongly or not.

As for the rest, they hugged their bellies and laughed loudly.

“Hahaha?… It’s really killing me! I really didn’t come in vain today! This kid’s ability to amuse is superb!”

“He was so cocky just now. So I thought that he knew how to refine some heaven-defying heavenly pill. After a long time, he’s going to compete in the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill with Nation Teacher!”

“Tsk tsk,?really a gimmick! It’s still my first time hearing that someone dares to compete in Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill with Nation Teacher! Doesn’t he know that Nation Teacher’s Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is the strongest in Eastward Country?”

… …

Ye Yuan’s composure previously became forced posturing in everyone’s eyes.

Now, his true colors were revealed!

Lin Lan could not help laughing as he said,?“Huhu,?Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill?huh??You really scared this nation teacher. Alright, compete in the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill then. Master Ye, you have to show mercy in a while!”

Roaring laughter sounded out everywhere. Everyone was tickled by Nation Teacher’s humor.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Then, please start your performance, Nation Teacher!”

Lin Lan smiled and said, “Alright, after this nation teacher finishes refining, I want to see how you still continue posturing!”

Lin Lan arrived before the pill furnace. Everyone quietened down.

Such a major incident happening to the Tang Family, many heavenly alchemists also rushed over when they heard the news.

Seeing Lin Lan take action, each and everyone held their breaths.

Lin Lan already had not displayed his strength in front of people for a long time.

Observing Nation Teacher’s pill refinement, even if it was the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, it would be a good learning opportunity for them too.

Arriving before the pill furnace, Lin Lan’s aura changed. The disposition of a grandmaster rose leisurely.

Feeling this aura, everyone registered profound respect.

How could an ordinary person become the nation teacher?

Lin Lan held his palm out, a dark-red Dao fire emerged.

Grade two Dao fire!

Red Lotus Wood Heaven Dao Fire!

Compared to grade one Dao fires, this Red Lotus Wood Heaven Dao Fire was clearly much purer. The damage to heavenly alchemists was also significantly lesser.

It was only to see Lin Lan beckon with his hand. A Dragonbone Grass arrived on his palm.

Dragonbone Grass was precisely one of the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill’s heavenly medicine.

The Dragonbone Grass gradually turned into paste form, being crystal clear without the slightest blemish!

Cries of wonder rose and ebbed!

“Tsk tsk,?the nation teacher is really the nation teacher. He is really too strong! This extraction technique has reached the acme of perfection!”

“I heard that Nation Teacher’s affinity reached a horrifying 48 points! Refining an entry-level heavenly medicine like Dragonbone Grass, isn’t it at his fingertips?”

“Haha,?I’m somewhat looking forward to it now. How a one point heavenly alchemist refines these heavenly medicines!”

… …

When experts make their move, the genuine and the fake would become clear at a glance.

The moment Lin Lan got started, it was completely not what Gu Mao that level of heavenly alchemist could compare to.

Regardless of whether it was heat or skill level, it was not on the same level at all!

Tang Yu and the rest had also never seen a grade two heavenly alchemist take action before.

Seeing this scene, they despaired to the extreme.

The nation teacher was still the nation teacher!

Too strong!

They already could not care about their injuries anymore. They only hoped that Lin Lan would make some mistakes when refining.

Otherwise, Ye Yuan would not have a chance to win at all!

However, time slowly trickled by. Lin Lan did not make any mistakes at all.

Not only that, but Lin Lan also seemed to have gotten serious, and actually showed signs of gradually entering an ideal state.

Lin Lan’s performance was like bullets, shattering the hearts of the Tang Family father and son to pieces.

No idea how long had passed either, Lin Lan withdrew his Dao fire and urged with his palm. A medicinal pill fell onto the table.

One look and the quality was extremely high!

“Huhu,?I haven’t practiced the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill for many years. I’ve become a little rusty. Fortunately, I gradually found some feeling back. Come, men, bring forth the Cloud Mount Mother Stone!” Lin Lan said with a laugh.

In reality, he was serious from the start.

Ye Yuan’s repeated provocation upset him greatly. He was naturally unwilling to be neglectful.

Taking action this time, he went all out!

As for being rusty, he had indeed not refined the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill for some years already, but it definitely would not affect his strength!

Just like a mathematics professional, he had not done elementary school problems for many years already.

If he went back to do the problems now, would he be rusty?

Obviously not!

Of course, he would not say that.

Very soon, someone brought a white rock up.

This rock was called Cloud Mount Mother Stone, it was specifically used to determine the quality of heavenly pills.

The Cloud Mount Mother Stone was the most sensitive to the quality of medicinal pills. A Heavenly Stratum powerhouse carved restrictions on it, once it reacted, it would give birth to a beam of light.

The more sections the light beam had, the higher the quality.

The quality of heavenly pills was divided into nine grades. First grade was the weakest, and ninth grade was the strongest!

The Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that Ye Yuan refined previously did not reach a grade at all.

Lin Lan reached his hand out and beckoned, that Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill suspended above the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.

Suddenly, light shone.

A light beam lit up on the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

Following that, the second beam of light, the third beam of light.

Only all the way until the fifth beam of light was more than half completed did it stop.

“Nation Teacher’s Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is of the upper fifth grade!”

Lin Lan nodded his head slightly, expressing satisfaction.

However, everyone was already boiling with excitement!

“Upper fifth grade! Just a bit more and it can reach sixth grade!”

“Nation Teacher is Nation Teacher, far from what some random Tom, Dick, or Harry, can compare to!”

“Heh,?Nation Teacher is simply demeaning his own status by competing in alchemy with that ascender!”
