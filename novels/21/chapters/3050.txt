Chapter 3049: Keep It Up!

Before today, people’s understanding of geniuses was generally regarding the likes of Zhou Xianchen and Kong Tan.

Even if some geniuses came roaring into existence, they would not surpass this scope by too much as well.

But today, this upper limit was clearly being refreshed by a lot.

It was like breaking a record.

If refining 300 heavenly pills simultaneously was a record, Ye Yuan forcibly raised this record by close to seven times!

This concept was an absolutely terrifying record in this circle of geniuses.

Reaching this level, even increasing the record by 5% was incredibly difficult.

Let alone to increase it by as much as seven times!

It could be imagined how shocked everybody currently was.

But Zhou Xianchen clearly would not admit defeat so easily.

After the shock, he smiled coldly and said, “What are you being smug for? The medicinal effect of the heavenly pill is the most important! The heavenly pills that I refined, 80% have already broken through to Emperor Sakra Heaven! I really want to see how many people you can let break through!”

Yang Qing laughed loudly and said, “You won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin! Brothers, let this moron see how strong the medicinal effect is!”

Without the slightest hesitation, Hu Gaoshan swallowed the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill in one gulp.

All of a sudden, he felt all the divine essence in his body start seething.

The Door of Eternal Life immediately appeared.

Hu Gaoshan felt that he had never been so powerful before!

Only to see him raise a fist and suddenly smash towards the second seal.

Boom!

The second seal trembled, then it started cracking.

The cracks grew bigger and bigger. Finally, it collapsed with a loud bang!

Hu Gaoshan, who had yet to reach grand completion, directly broke through to Emperor Sakra Heaven!

Although it was not done in one breath like Yang Qing, it was already shocking enough.

Hu Gaoshan’s aptitude was merely so-so in the eyes of normal people.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

One Door of Eternal Life after another was smashed open without the slightest obstacle.

In fact, there were even some who had barely reached grand completion Emperor Vast Heaven that also directly broke through to Emperor Sakra Heaven!

The 2000 people that Ye Yuan picked, regardless of which aspects you looked, they were all inferior to Zhou Xianchen’s 2000 people.

But the breakthrough numbers completely crushed Zhou Xianchen’s!

These 2000 people all broke through to Emperor Sakra Heaven without exception!

100%

The whole audience was in a stir!

“How is this possible? Some of these people were not suited to break through to Emperor Sakra Heaven at all, and they actually broke through too!”

“When did breaking through to Emperor Sakra Heaven become so easy?”

“The quality of Ye Yuan’s Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill seems to be roughly the same as Zhou Xianchen’s. Why is the medicinal effect so different? This is impossible!”

… …

Attentive people had already realized the difference.

On the surface, the quality of Ye Yuan’s heavenly pills was not higher than Zhou Xianchen’s.

But the medicine effect spoke for itself!

Those people who consumed Zhou Xianchen’s heavenly pills were basically all peak Emperor Vast Heaven, unable to rise anymore.

But the 2000 people that Ye Yuan picked, there were roughly half who did not meet the conditions to break through.

However, everyone broke through to Emperor Sakra Heaven without any exceptions!

This was terrifying!

One had to know that medicinal effects of heavenly pills were not the same for each person.

Same quality heavenly pill, when consumed by martial artists of the same cultivation realm, the difference was huge!

Some people would directly break through their realm.

But some would have a very small growth or even nothing.

This was determined by the individual’s aptitude.

Of course, origin grade heavenly pill, no matter how lousy, it would not be zero growth too.

In terms of aptitude, the 2000 people that Ye Yuan picked, people with discerning eyes knew that they were far worse than Zhou Xianchen’s 2000 people with one glance.

But the breakthrough rate was 100%!

What kind of concept was this?

This showed that the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills that Ye Yuan refined, the medicinal effect was significantly stronger than Zhou Xianchen’s!

A total of 2000 Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses instantly appeared among the 50 thousand people!

Zhou Xianchen could not bear it anymore. All of his glory was shattered to pieces at this moment.

Ye Yuan’s Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill completely crushed him!

“H-How can this be? This is impossible! Even if Father was here, it’s impossible to do it so flawlessly too! How can there possibly be someone who doesn’t make any mistakes?” Zhou Xianchen was somewhat falling apart.

His father was Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s Supreme Hegemon, and he was also a chaos heavenly master.

But, even if it was his father, he could not do it so perfectly like Ye Yuan too.

An Emperor Vast Heaven did something that even a Supreme Hegemon could not accomplish!

Boom!

Just as everyone was shocked, the nirvanic rebirth fire started again!

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of ridiculing Zhou Xianchen at all. After resting briefly, he directly started refining the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill.

Furthermore, it was refining 300 together!

Everyone who had not woken up from the shock yet, fell into a frenzy once more.

“Got to be kidding! He’s going to refine the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill?!”

“Refining 300 together, is he mad? The refining difficulty of the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill is at least 100 times that of the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill”

“Furthermore, he has just refined 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills. His condition shouldn’t have recovered to the peak yet, right? Can he stand this kind of refinement?”

“Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill, the divine essence and soul force consumed is absolutely more than a hundred times that of the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill! How can this possibly be completed?”

“If he can even succeed in refining this, Your Father will pluck my head off to feed dogs!”

… …

Those who knew the profession all knew that 300 Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pills and 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills, the difficulty was not on the same level at all.

Regarding the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill, even refining one would take a tremendous effort.

This level of heavenly imperial pill, it was an issue of whether or not it could be refined, and not an issue of quality.

In the end, Ye Yuan was going to refine at the same time!

Just this action, it represented boundless scorn for Zhou Xianchen.

But, even if Ye Yuan successfully refined 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills, they also did not believe that Ye Yuan could successfully refine these Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pills.

This sort of thing was a little too bizarre.

While they did not believe it, this time, people were not so impulsive anymore.

Ye Yuan had already exhibited unparalleled strength. No matter what the result was, him crushing the juniors of the three great alchemy path factions was already an undeniable fact.

Nobody could deny this.

But, if Ye Yuan really succeeded, that would be climbing up to another summit!

Currently, Zhou Xianchen still had the qualification to compete with him.

But, if Ye Yuan succeeded, Zhou Xianchen would not even have the qualification to compete with him anymore.

The two people would already be on completely different levels. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was also where the significance of the refinement this time lay.

Hence, everyone put away the shock in their hearts and paid close attention to Ye Yuan’s refinement.

Compared to the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill, Ye Yuan’s refinement this time did not have such a great commotion.

That cluster of nirvanic rebirth fire was much smaller.

But people with discerning eyes would know at a glance that the power of the flames was several times stronger than before!

This time, a tense expression finally appeared on Ye Yuan’s face.

Fine beads of sweat also started seeping out on his forehead. But very soon, it was evaporated by the nirvanic rebirth fire.

In the void, Heavenless’ pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, “Terrific lad, to actually still be hiding a card up his sleeves! Impressive! Impressive! Such a refinement, it’s not overboard to describe using reaching the acme of perfection! Even if it was this ancestor back then, I was far worse than him too! I didn’t expect that after many years, such a monster would appear in the world again!”
