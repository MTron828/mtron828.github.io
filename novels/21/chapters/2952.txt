Chapter 2951: I’m of the Real Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!

Loser?

He simply did not dare to believe his own ears. A genius who could fuse with a Supreme Hegemon’s origin was actually called a loser by someone.

Did the world already become so crazy?

“Hur,?brat who’s surnamed Bai, don’t think that with your family’s ancestor protecting, you can engage in wild talk in front of this seat! Do you really think that origin is so easy to fuse? This seat thinks that it’s clearly you guys who couldn’t fuse the origin, calling the grapes sour because you can’t eat them, right?” Mountain Goat looked at Bai Cuishan and said with a cold laugh.

“Hahaha?…”

Mountain Goat did not expect that the moment the words came out of his mouth, it immediately incurred hooting waves of laughter.

The Pseudo Imperishable Physiques that entered the Seven-Colored Pagoda all laughed!

Although Mountain Goat was a Great Emperor whose reputation shook the Imperishable Soul Domain, he felt somewhat ashamed and angry at this time too.

I was actually being laughed at by a bunch of Pseudo Imperishable Physique trash?

You trash have been laughing all the way from just now.

Laugh my *ss!

“All shut up for this seat!” Mountain Goat said in fury.

The moment an origin powerhouse was enraged, everyone shut their mouths one after another and did not dare to laugh anymore.

However, Mountain Goat also finally realized that the matter seemed to be different from what he imagined!

“Wang Qian, you say, what on earth happened inside the Seven-Colored Pagoda!” Mountain Goat said in a solemn voice.

“Lord Shan Yang, I …” Wang Qian stammered.

“Huhu,?Lord Shan Yang, although Wang Qian is already very shameless, he’s probably still ashamed to talk about the events inside the Seven-Colored Pagoda! Why don’t I tell you?” Bai Cuishan said with a laugh.

Seeing that Wang Qian still had a stammering appearance, Mountain Goat gave a cold snort, which was considered to have tacitly agreed to it.

The few Great Emperors were long already full of suspicion and could not help perking their ears up to listen attentively.

The more everyone listened, the more shocked they became.

Even if they had vast experience and knowledge, they also did not think that such terrifying things actually happened inside the Seven-Colored Pagoda.

And the initiator of evil for all these was Ye Yuan!

Including Cloudneon, their gazes when looking toward Ye Yuan were like looking at a monster.

They thought that the Seven-Colored Pagoda this time, the most optimistic estimation would only be one person who could come out.

But who would have expected that more than 100 people actually came out!

Furthermore, these over 100 people all made great progress in strength.

The likes of Bai Cuishan even thrashed the Wang Qian, who fused with the origin!

“Loser!” Mountain Goat was angered until he billowed smoke from all seven orifices.

Wang Qian was really an out-and-out loser!

Fused with origin and he was actually still being trampled by people.

His Central Soul Region’s face had been utterly lost!

“Senior Apprentice Sister Mu, you said that … Ye Yuan is a joke?”

“Senior Apprentice Brother Ming Jian, you said that … Ye Yuan was rotten mud that can’t even hold a wall up?”

“Brother Shan Yan, you were showing off in front of me about how impressive Wang Qian is?”

Suddenly, the Cloudneon, who had been icy-cold all along, opened her mouth.

The three people’s faces immediately felt a fiery heat.

This one month plus, they had scolded Ye Yuan plenty.

Cloudneon did not make a sound the entire time. Who knew that she endured for more than a month, but now, she finally launched an attack!

It was not that she did not care. It was just giving you a fatal blow at the critical moment!

What a resounding slap!

Ye Yuan was also dumbfounded from listening. Sure enough, women could not be provoked! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Furthermore, this woman was well-versed in the Dao of Posturing.

Let you guys jump around first!

After you guys finish posturing, I’ll posture!

Furthermore, it was a one-hit-certain-kill!

Ye Yuan was currently marveling but saw Cloudneon’s gaze look toward him as she said coolly, “Since Wang Qian has already fused with the origin, then you’re useless! You can go and die already!”

Cloudneon’s words were devoid of any emotion.

In an instant, Ye Yuan felt a piercing cold killing intent. He was virtually going to asphyxiate.

This woman was not kidding!

She had doubts about his motives and was really going to silence him to prevent divulgence of secrets!

That meaning was, that you had no more value to exploit; you can go and die already!

Even if Ye Yuan was currently extremely strong, he did not have the slightest strength to fight back in front of Cloudneon either.

This woman was too strong!

Ye Yuan’s scalp tingled. This woman fell out at the drop of a hat. It really caught him off-guard!

Of course, Ye Yuan also knew that his actions had angered Cloudneon.

I asked you to go and integrate with the origin, but you’re good, directly throwing the origin to someone else!

This Imperishable Origin held extraordinary significance to the five great regions.

Whoever fused with the origin was equivalent to being Progenitor Imperishable’s direct lineage disciple.

After Hegemon Imperishable returned, that region’s status would not be the same anymore.

Well done, I regarded you so highly. You sold me with a flip of your hand.

If I don’t kill you, won’t I let you down?

Ye Yuan’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, “Hold on! Although Wang Qian fused with the origin, he might not be able to find Progenitor Imperishable! Maybe I can help you guys!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of the five great origin powerhouses changed.

The Pseudo Imperishable Physiques present were in an uproar.

“Find Progenitor Imperishable? What’s going on?”

“Did something happen to Progenitor Imperishable?”

“Ah!?No wonder they sealed the Seven-Colored Pagoda. It turns out that it’s because of this!”

… …

Ye Yuan and Wang Qian both had a tacit agreement to not say the truth.

At this time, Ye Yuan blurted it out under desperation; everyone exploded at once.

Something happened to Progenitor Imperishable!

This was an earth-shattering major thing!

When Progenitor Imperishable was around, the Imperishable Soul Domain was around!

If Progenitor Imperishable died, the Imperishable Soul Domain would perish!

This was what everyone knew.

Mountain Goat said angrily, “Ye Yuan, you’re courting death! The origin has already been integrated by Wang Qian. It has nothing to do with you anymore! Since Junior Apprentice Sister Cloudneon wants to kill you, you go to hell then!”

The five great powerhouses were all in a thunderous rage at this time, wishing to kill Ye Yuan off for good.

Mountain Goat even directly cleaved a palm knife over without giving a chance to explain.

He had long found Ye Yuan displeasing to the eye. At this time, he naturally had to strike first to gain the advantage!

Although Mountain Goat casually struck, it was a cataclysmic crisis to Ye Yuan!

It was like he was hit by a paralyzing hex, unable to move at all.

An origin power was too strong!

Boom!

Mountain Goat’s expression changed. His sneak attack was actually terminated by Cloudneon without extra trouble!

“Let him speak!” Cloudneon said lightly, not giving Mountain Goat face at all.

Although it was a soul body, Ye Yuan still felt cold sweat run down his back.

He drew a deep breath and said, “Finding Progenitor Imperishable through this trace of origin, that’s just your speculation! You guys also can’t guarantee that Wang Qian can find Progenitor Imperishable, right? But, I can!”

Mountain Goat was somewhat angry from embarrassment and said with a cold smile, “Even Progenitor’s origin can’t find him; what right do you have!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Based on that I’m of the real Imperishable Soul Physique!”

Mountain Goat laughed loudly and said, “What a joke! The 33 Heavens have already existed for god knows how many years. It has also only produced Progenitor Imperishable, one Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique! You dare to boast shamelessly. Do you really take us, these Great Emperors, to all be fools?”

The old woman also sneered and said, “In these countless years, no idea how many Pseudo Imperishable Soul Physiques have appeared before, all saying that they are of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique! But, they were all not! What right do you have to say that you are?”

Ye Yuan looked toward Mountain Goat, like he was saying:?Yes, you look just like a fool!

Without waiting for Mountain Goat to fly off the handle, Ye Yuan said: “Before entering the Seven-Colored Pagoda, I didn’t dare confirm that I’m of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique too! But now, I’m incomparably sure! I’m of the real Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!”
