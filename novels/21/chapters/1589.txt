Chapter 1593 Overwhelming Aura

“You want to compete in the Vastsun Universe Pill with me? Huhu, young man, I’m somewhat doubting it now. Do you really know alchemy?” When Ruo Xu heard that, he could not refrain from laughing in spite of himself.

“Know or not, you’ll know in a while. Why is Head Elder going back on your words?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Heh, since you’re looking for a trashing yourself, then wouldn’t it somewhat be letting you down if this old man doesn’t help you achieve your purpose?” Ruo Xu said with a cold smile.

To talk about Ruo Xu refining the Vastsun Universe Pill, that was indeed a special ability of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

There was even one time when he refined a peak heaven-grade Vastsun Universe Pill and just missed a little bit more to reach the realm of divine-grade. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

For the Vastsun Universe Pill, this was simply a miracle.

There was a saying that circulated among alchemists, the Vastsun Universe Pill was the hardest in rank three!

For a rank three alchemist to want to refine the Vastsun Universe Pill, it was undoubtedly a fool’s talk.

One could say that the Vastsun Universe Pill was the taboo of Three-star Alchemy Gods.

Even though it was just a rank three divine pill.

Only by experiencing the baptism of Great Dao, opening up one’s inner-world and increasing one’s comprehension, could one refine this medicinal pill.

It could be seen from this how great the difficulty of refining this medicinal pill was.

However, when everyone heard that Head Elder was going to refine the Vastsun Universe Pill, each and every one of them became incomparably excited.

Especially those alchemists, this was a rare chance to learn and observe to them.

“It’s really too great! To actually be able to personally see Head Elder refining the Vastsun Universe Pill, this is a chance that only happens once in a blue moon!”

“Even though Elder Ye is unreliable, he obtained benefits for us, these bottom-level alchemists, this time!”

“Elder Ye is really an ignorant person who doesn’t fear anything, to actually want to compete in the Vastsun Universe Pill with Head Elder. Isn’t this simply looking to be abused?”

“Maybe he feels that such a difficult medicinal pill, even if he can’t refine it, it wouldn’t be too embarrassing either. This way, he can continue to fish in troubled waters in the future.”

...

The spirit medicines required for refining the Vastsun Universe Pill were very rare. But with the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s strength, collecting a few sets of rank three spirit medicines was still doable.

It was just that this medicinal pill was too precious. Extremely few people could afford the price to invite Head Elder to take action.

Before long, someone prepared two sets of spirit medicines and delivered them to the Pill Tower.

“Elder Ye, these spirit medicines were gotten by the Martial Tower’s disciples at the risk of their lives. Giving you to refine is really too wasteful!” Ruo Xu pointed at those spirit medicines and said.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “Head Elder’s words aren’t correct. Wasted or not, we’ll only know after refining. If your medicinal pill’s quality is worse than mine, you’re the one who really squandered it!”

Ruo Xu snorted coldly and said, “Razor-tongued! I don’t believe that you can really refine the Vastsun Universe Pill.”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said coolly, “It’s useless to say anymore, let’s get started! Uh ... Head Elder go first, let me plagiarize first.”

Ruo Xu laughed coldly and said, “Then you have to watch carefully!”

Done talking, Head Elder’s two hands drew a circle. The aura of Great Dao surged to the sky on the plaza, the commotion extremely shocking.

Reaching the realm of Four-star Alchemy God Realm, each pill refinement would trigger the power of Great Dao. But those who could be deep and vigorous like Head Elder, they were one of a kind.

Xuan Yu’s gaze turned sharp and he muttered to himself, “Looks like his strength improved again!”

The two people fought for so many years and had always been secretly contending.

Regarding Ruo Xu’s strength, Xuan Yu was the clearest.

From this imposing momentum, he could sense that Ruo Xu’s strength was a little stronger than before again.

Reaching their realm, every tiny bit of improvement was exceedingly hard to come by.

Head Elder’s strength improving, he could originally shake him off by some distance.

It was just too bad ... he ran into Ye Yuan!

Observing Ye Yuan’s pill refinement the last time made Xuan Yu glean considerable gains.

These few days, Xuan Yu’s Alchemy Dao level had considerable improvement.

This kind of learning actually had the best effect during the first time.

Because Ye Yuan’s pill refinement opened another door for them.

“Indeed worthy of being the head elder. The moment he made his move, it’s heaven-shocking!”

“I don’t know if Head Elder can break through the fetters this time and refine a divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill!”

“If Head Elder can break through the fetters, then all the major families present will probably go crazy!”

“Isn’t that so! Divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill virtually represents a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse. Which family can be calm?”

...

Head Elder’s alchemy technique was dignified and complex, yet incomparably steady.

The Alchemy Dao powerhouses present, even elder-class, were also ashamed of their inferiority.

This was the strength after endless tempering and training. There was no way to rock it at all.

Ye Yuan watched by the side and also praised endlessly.

“Tsk tsk, indeed worthy of being the head elder. His strength isn’t ordinary!’ Ye Yuan had an appearance of finding fault.

The others could not help being speechless when they saw. How bold was this guy to actually not start yet?

Or was it that he could not refine it at all, and directly chose to give up?

“Hey! If you can’t refine, admit defeat as early as possible. You simply look like a clown right now!” an elder in Head Elder’s faction said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan did not get angry either, saying with a smile, “No rush, let him refine a while first. Whether I’m a clown or not, you’ll know in a while!”

That elder snorted coldly and said, “I’ll see what trick you can play!”

Ruo Xu entering pill refining state, his entire person was fully focused on the medicinal pill.

Ye Yuan and the elder’s conversation, he naturally could not hear it.

The original contest became Head Elder’s solo performance.

Very soon, everyone was drawn by Head Elder’s transcendent alchemy technique. No one paid attention to Ye Yuan anymore.

They were definitely super certain that Ye Yuan was an out-and-out swindler who did not know alchemy at all!

However, right at this time, Ye Yuan moved!

An even more majestic Great Dao aura suddenly surged to the sky, giving everyone a fright.

“This ... What’s going on?”

“This Great Dao aura was emitted by Ye Yuan?”

“How is that possible?! His aura is actually so much stronger than Head Elder!”

“My God, my eyesight must be failing! How can a Three-star Alchemy God possibly trigger such a terrifying Great Dao aura?”

...

When the pill refinement started, that cynical and flippant state thoroughly disappeared from Ye Yuan’s body.

What replaced it was an incomparable focus.

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with dumbfounded gazes and slack jaws. That dream-like alchemy technique, that continuously fluctuating Great Dao aura, was making it clear to all that this was an existence whose Alchemy Dao already reached a consummate realm!

Head Elder’s pill refinement paled in comparison in front of Ye Yuan!

After the astonishment, everyone was completely drawn over by Ye Yuan very quickly.

Especially those alchemists, each and every one of them watched like they were intoxicated.

Currently, Ye Yuan refining pills was just like triggering Great Dao Heavenly Melody back then, capable of making the surrounding people immerse inside, unable to extricate themselves too.

They discovered that Ye Yuan’s alchemy technique was what they had never heard of before.

His technique was exceedingly profound, they could not understand at all.

Especially those elders, each and every one of them were akin to having obtained a priceless treasure. They seemed to have had a good rain after a long drought, learning from Ye Yuan hungrily.
