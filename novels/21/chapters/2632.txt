Chapter 2638: No Escape from Fate!

This cold cry finally made the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciples wake up.

They flung caution to the wind and started breaking out of the encirclement.

Under the protection of Ye Yuan’s Hundred Poison Formation, the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciples mowed down all resistance.

Seeing this scene, Huangfu Cloudthink’s gaze revealed a chill.

“Humph!?This alliance chief felt that you’re a talent. That’s why I kept showing mercy. Since that’s the case, then this alliance chief can only resort to force!”

A powerful to the extreme aura instantly locked onto Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan felt as uncomfortable as if his throat was being clutched.

Huangfu Cloudthink was actually a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

Feeling Huangfu Cloudthink’s strength, Ye Yuan was shocked in his heart too.

A deputy alliance chief actually had grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven strength, then what about the Alliance Chief?

Could it be that fleeting and ephemeral Saint Sovereign Heaven?

If that was the case, then the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect would really be finished!

Huangfu Cloudthink did not look very awe-inspiring either. He just struck a palm over so lightly.

Ye Yuan felt a lofty mountain-like force come at him head-on!

Ye Yuan’s mind shook heavily. This palm seemed unremarkable, but actually, its utilization of rule was brilliant to the max!

Virtually without hesitation, Ye Yuan executed spatial rule to try and avoid this blow.

Ye Yuan’s speed was quick to the extreme!

But Huangfu Cloudthink sneered and said, “It’s useless! If I can’t even take care of you, a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, I can forget about being the deputy alliance chief!”

Ye Yuan was greatly shocked!

That invisible force seemed to be like a bone-infesting maggot, chasing after.

Furthermore, the speed was even several times faster than him!

In a blink of an eye, it caught up to Ye Yuan.

He could not escape!

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth and silently recited a spell.

Suddenly, a giant mountain suddenly rose sharply in front of him!

The small and exquisite Heavenspan Mountain grew into a giant mountain as high as the sky all of a sudden.

Boom!

That force just happened to arrive, directly landing on the giant mountain.

The force penetrated the huge mountain!

Ye Yuan felt a surge of huge force transmit right into his four limbs and bones.

His body flew out backward involuntarily, fresh blood spurting wildly!

This Huangfu Cloudthink was too strong!

Ye Yuan had some guesses in his heart; Shi Feiyu was utterly not worth mentioning in front of Huangfu Cloudthink!

In fact, probably even Sect Master Feng Xuanyi was not his match.

This person’s combat power was not the least bit inferior to Xiao Feibai!

Another sect master level powerhouse! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This Pill Alliance actually possessed two sect master level powerhouses all at once. This was simply terrifyingly powerful.

More importantly, that mysterious alliance chief never showed his face from start to finish.

“A puny little Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum could actually block my Windrise Ethereal Palm, truly incredible! Not only is your alchemy path talent extremely high, but your martial path talent is also frighteningly strong! Are you really not considering joining the Pill Alliance?” Huangfu Cloudthink looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly.

In reality, Huangfu Cloudthink had long seen through. It was impossible for Ye Yuan to join the Pill Alliance.

If he did not even have this bit of ability to discern people, he, this deputy alliance chief, would also have an undeserved reputation.

But he still did not give up.

A talent like Ye Yuan was absolutely hard to come across in a million years.

Even he felt ashamed of his inferiority in front of Ye Yuan too.

He relied on the Pill Alliance’s profound foundation to have today’s achievements.

But what did Ye Yuan have?

Nothing!

Ye Yuan forcefully reached the realm of true grade with his strength alone and started a Pill Pavilion, even causing a huge impact to the Pill Alliance.

This was a grandmaster level figure!

In time, Ye Yuan would absolutely be a Zhuo Bufan level existence!

There was no doubt about this.

Ye Yuan was heavily injured, but his face was very resolute as he said coolly, “You know the answer. Why bother to waste your breath?”

Huangfu Cloudthink sighed slightly and said, “I know the answer, but I’m also earnest in my love for talents! In my eyes, a Martial Secure Heavenly Sect is less important than you!”

These words made the faces of many Pill Alliance powerhouses change.

Even when Holy Son came into being back then, Alliance Chief Huangfu did not give such a high evaluation either!

Ye Yuan smiled brilliantly and said, “But in my eyes, a hundred Pill Alliances isn’t as good as a fraction of Martial Secure Heavenly Sect!”

It was hard to come across a bosom friend in life!

Luo Yunqing laid low for ten years just in order to move Ye Yuan.

After entering the sect, Feng Xuanyi overrode all objections. This trust deserved Ye Yuan’s repayment!

It was undeniable that there was a scum like Shi Feiyu in the sect.

But there was more warmth.

“Humph!

?Don’t know how to appreciate favors! Since that’s the case, then this alliance chief will send you off!”

Huangfu Cloudthink’s expression was frosty, a palm wind arising again!

This palm was even fiercer than before.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence was lacking. He was already unable to urge the Heavenspan Mountain anymore.

Being a sect master class powerhouse, his strength was not what the current Ye Yuan could resist at all.

Even if he had a heavenly spirit treasure like the Heavenspan Mountain in his hand, it would not work either!

If the disparity in cultivation realm could be made up for by just using a treasure, then wouldn’t cultivation be a joke?

The force carried the sound of the wind, making Ye Yuan’s clothes flutter wildly.

But, facing this outrageous palm, Ye Yuan had a calm and collected look.

Far away, Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciples already broke out of the encirclement, fleeing in all directions.

On top of the mountain, Feng Xuanyi and Luo Yunqing were soaked in blood, killing their way in and out, practically already exhausted.

Facing more than 180 Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratums, and also Xiao Feibai, this kind of sect master class powerhouse, it was useless no matter how strong he was.

For the first time, facing death, Ye Yuan felt that he was very powerless.

He could not even struggle!

The Pill Alliance was too strong!

No, it was him who was too weak!

Even if he had Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum strength, he would not be so powerless too!

Boom!

There was a loud noise.

Ye Yuan only felt a blur before his eyes, that fearsome palm actually disappeared into thin air.

A black-robed old man appeared out of thin air in front of Ye Yuan, leaving him in a trance.

This black-robed old man gave him an indescribable feeling.

A kind of fleeting and ephemeral feeling!

Arriving at Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, Ye Yuan felt like he had returned to the feeling when he had just been reborn again.

Everything was without bluster and ostentation.

All powers were operating under the shackles of this Heavenly Dao.

But, this old man in front of Ye Yuan shattered his understanding.

This old man seemed to have broken away from the shackles of Heavenly Dao, becoming a god who could fly up to heaven and tunnel into the earth.

“Boy, take it!”

The black-robed old man did not even turn his head back, a streak of white light arrived with a howl.

Ye Yuan reached his hand out to grab it and discovered that it was a fragmented piece of jade.

“Senior, this is …” Ye Yuan said uncertainly.

The black-robed old man said coolly, his tone being very calm, “This is the Heavenly Phoenix Jade Penannular Pendant that Lord Zhuo passed down, each of the five great heavenly sects holds one of them! Lord Zhuo said that when the five great heavenly sects reach the brink of life and death, we can combine these five incomplete jade pendants together and tide over the hurdle. But sadly, it seems like it can’t be used it anymore. Take this piece of jade pendant and go!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Senior is Saint Sovereign Heavenly Stratum, right? With you around, could it be that you can’t stop the Pill Alliance too?”

The black-robed old man laughed loudly and said, “Boy, you’re a clever guy. Can’t you see through it? It’s impossible for the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect to escape its doom!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent!

The black-robed old man’s meaning was very clear. There was indeed a Saint Sovereign Heavenly Stratum powerhouse in this Pill Alliance too!

Furthermore, the black-robed old man seemed to lack the confidence to win!
