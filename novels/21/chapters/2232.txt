Chapter 2236: Too Late

The Ghost Empyreans were incredibly shocked!

Ye Yuan’s strength was clearly only Fifth Firmament Empyrean, but his combat strength was not the slightest bit inferior to a Seventh Firmament Empyrean.

Furthermore, his sword was extremely bizarre. It actually disregarded the Souleater Beasts’ spatial law!

No matter how swift like lightning these Souleater Beasts were, he could kill them with one sword move.

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s gaze turned slightly dark and said, “This kid is fishy!”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’ eyes were sharp and said with some surprise, “This boy knows some spatial law too. Furthermore ... he fused Sword Dao law and spatial law. His offensive power is very sharp. I didn’t expect that he’s also adept at restraining Souleater Beasts.”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn sneered when he heard that and said, “Human genius martial artist is it? Jeje, dying here is also pretty good!”

The other Heavenly Emperors also had gloating expressions on their faces.

But when the Empyreans heard it, they felt surprised.

This punk’s soul force was so strong. So they did not expect that he was also such a terrifying genius in martial arts.

No wonder he could actually block Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s attack previously.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak ...”

Suddenly, ear-piercing screams were emitted in the caves by the side.

Three enormous Souleater Beasts scurried out, pouncing straight for Ye Yuan!

“Hiss ... There are actually still several Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beasts hiding!”

“Luckily this brat lured them out! Otherwise, we’d be dead for sure!”

“However, this boy’s strength is genuinely strong. Placed among human martial artists, he’s absolutely a first-rate genius too! What a shame, he’s going to die here.”

... ...

When the group of Ghost Empyreans saw these three Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beasts, each and every one of them felt their scalps tingle.

This level of Souleater Beasts was virtually one bite each for them!

After Ye Yuan killed more than a dozen Souleater Beasts in a row, these three Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beasts finally could not hold back anymore.

With three Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beasts joining in, Ye Yuan’s pressure immediately skyrocketed.

But he relied on his movement technique’s superiority and could barely manage to tangle with the Souleater Beasts.

When the group of Empyreans saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely shocked.

Ye Yuan’s combat strength was too fearsome. He was simply a human-shaped monster.

These three Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beasts, each one facing a human Eighth Firmament Empyrean could definitely win too.

But, under the pincer attacks of so many Souleater Beasts, Ye Yuan could actually still hold out.

Even though Ye Yuan’s body had quite a few injuries added, the number of Souleater Beasts was still slowly reducing.

The faces of the group of Heavenly Emperors finally revealed solemn expressions.

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said, “This brat was actually still hiding his strength previously! If not for these three Souleater Beasts taking action, we’ve all have been deceived by him!”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze also turned slightly dark and said, “Hiding his strength is nothing much, but these Souleater Beasts are a huge threat! I reckon that there might even be peak Empyrean Realm Souleater Beasts hiding nearby!”

The moment these words came out, the Heavenly Emperors turned pale with fright!

Peak Empyrean Souleater Beasts were absolutely horrifying existences to Ghost Dao powerhouses.

Peak Empyrean and Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beasts hiding, what were their targets?

Was there still a need to say?

At this time, they were rejoicing greatly for Ye Yuan’s existence.

If not for Ye Yuan, they might really have been tricked by these Souleater Beasts.

While Heavenly Emperors were invincible existences, Souleater Beasts and Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperors were different.

Peak Empyrean Souleater Beasts similarly posed tremendous threats to Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperors!

Encountering a natural enemy, the disparity in cultivation realm was no longer disparity sometimes.

If these Souleater Beasts sneak attacked by taking advantage of the chaos, the final result would really be hard to say.

If a peak Empyrean Souleater Beast could eat a Ghost Dao Heavenly Emperor, breaking through to become a Heavenly Emperor would practically not have much suspense anymore.

This kind of temptation was worth Souleater Beasts taking the risk.

However, all their plans were disrupted by Ye Yuan.

His strength was too strong and actually forcefully contending with the Souleater Beasts horde by himself!

Currently, even Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beasts were forced out, and they were still unable to do anything to Ye Yuan.

Sure enough, not long after, a green shadow tore through the blood colors and flew straight for Ye Yuan.

Rumble!

Ye Yuan’s reaction was extremely fast. With a backhand, it was a sword.

However, this Ninth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beast was too strong. Ye Yuan vomited a mouthful of fresh bloody violently and was blasted flying out.

How could Ye Yuan still dare to remain still? His figure flashed, tunneling into one of the nearby passageways.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak ...”

The Ninth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beast cried out strangely and turned into a streak of green light to chase after.

The Souleater Beasts were already enraged. How could they be willing to let Ye Yuan go?

Several dozen Souleater Beasts were in hot pursuit, chasing Ye Yuan into that passageway.

A hint of amusement flashed across the corners of Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’ mouth and he said coolly, “Alright, let’s go then!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn laughed loudly and said, “This brat finally met his match. This time, see if he still doesn’t die!”

Ye Yuan luring away the Souleater Beasts, the Empyreans could finally heave a sigh in relief.

But following that, there was no one to block the spear for them anymore, they could only hope for the best.

In the crowd, Wu Jiang’s expression flickered incessantly. Finally, he still followed everyone and left.

... ...

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Ye Yuan turned into a streak of flowing light, speed swift to the extreme.

Behind him, several dozen Souleater Beasts were quick as lightning, in hot pursuit.

This passageway’s blood light was a little dimmer, clearly, it was not the most important passageway.

In a blink, they arrived in an open area.

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly stopped!

The group of Souleater Beasts also abruptly stopped, enclosing Ye Yuan in the middle.

The Souleater Beasts’ leader looked at Ye Yuan, a hint of balefulness in its gaze.

These Souleater Beasts had extremely high intellect. Furthermore, their guts were massive, to actually dare ambush Heavenly Emperors!

However, all these plans were ruined by Ye Yuan. So how could they not be furious?

Ye Yuan looked at the Souleater Beast leader and said with a light smile, “Alright, there’s no one here anymore, can send you all on the way already!”

The current Ye Yuan, his entire person’s aura was incomparably sharp and fierce, just like a sharp sword that was drawn from its sheath. How did he look like he was heavily injured earlier?

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives they all thought that Ye Yuan was already forced to his limits. Actually, all this was within Ye Yuan’s calculations!

Souleater Beasts were very clever. Seeing Ye Yuan’s appearance, they immediately became vigilant, eyes revealing wary looks.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak ...”

The Souleater Beasts suddenly cried out strangely, turning into bolts of lightning, and they were about to escape.

“Too late ... Immobilize!” The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly as he opened his mouth and said coolly.

Time Freeze!

Several dozen streaks of sword light flashed by and disappeared. How much stronger was the power compared to before?

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Several dozen Souleater Beasts were directly killed by Ye Yuan!

The Eighth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beast was already heavily injured on the verge of death, without the slightest strength to resist.

While the Ninth Firmament Empyrean Souleater Beast’s strength was formidable and was not thoroughly dead yet.

“Seal!”

Ye Yuan moved like lightning, instantly laying down an array formation, and imprisoning these few Souleater Beasts.

Ye Yuan took out a small bottle and said with a faint smile, “I didn’t expect that there are actually still fierce beasts like you guys. This really greatly exceeded my expectations. Heh, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives, since you think so highly of this Ye, then this Ye also can’t be stingy and will send a big gift to you later!”
