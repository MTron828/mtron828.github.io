Chapter 2730: Coquettish Profligate Hoof!

“You restore your true dragon form, I’ll teach you!” Mi Tian said.

When Ye Yuan heard that, the dragon might in his body billowed to the sky.

Very soon, he transformed into an azure dragon form that was several hundred feet long.

The moment the true dragon appeared, Big Yellow’s bull eyes directly became wide-saucers and he said in alarm and terror, “Y-Y-You … how can you … true … true dragon!”

True dragons were chaos true spirits, being extremely rare.

True dragons had never appeared on Rainclear Continent before.

Now, he actually met a true dragon. How could he not be shocked? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He never dreamed that not only was Ye Yuan a remarkable heavenly alchemist, he was actually also a true dragon!

“No need to make a fuss. I have half dragon race lineage, so transforming into a true dragon isn’t a big deal,” Ye Yuan said.

“Y-You said it too lightly! Chaos true spirits are the darling of heaven. Each one is an incomparably formidable existence! You … You’re actually of the dragon race!” Big Yellow said speechlessly.

Swoosh!

Right at this time, a figure actually dashed out of the boundary wall.

The arrival said in shock and anger, “Who is it? To actually dare trespass my Jadetrue’s forbidden land!”

When Ye Yuan saw it, he was shocked in his heart too.

He did not expect that a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse was actually hidden in the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s forbidden land!

In front of him was an old man in tattered clothing, looking thin and emaciated like he was about to kick the bucket. He looked very terrifying.

“Eh,?there’s actually a three tribulations Saint Sovereign Heaven here! This little bull is likely not his match!” Mi Tian was a little surprised as he said.

Ye Yuan was even more surprised when he heard it. This old man was actually a three tribulations Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Although transcending tribulations would not increase the strength of Saint Sovereign Heavens, wanting to successfully transcend tribulations required powerful strength in itself.

So Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses often used the number of tribulations to differentiate strength too.

This old man could transcend the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation three times, his strength could be seen at a glance!

Big Yellow had not even transcended a Dao Tribulation once. Hence, he was naturally not a match.

When the old man saw Ye Yuan, he could not help but get a shock too and said, “True dragon! A true dragon actually appeared in Rainclear Continent!?Hahaha,

?this exalt just happened to be lacking a mount, since you delivered yourself to the door, then this exalt won’t be courteous!”

After the surprise, the old man’s first reaction was actually to capture Ye Yuan and use him as a mount!

A true dragon as a mount, not only would it gain face, there would be a great helper in the future!

It just so happened that Ye Yuan’s current strength was not strong, it was just right to capture.

But before Ye Yuan said anything, the Mi Tian in his sea of consciousness was already beyond furious.

Ye Yuan only felt a heinous fury almost wanting to immolate him completely in his sea of consciousness.

“Ignorant fool, truly monstrous audacity! My dragon race is of a supreme true spirit, you actually dare to have this idea, prepare to bear my wrath!”

With this sentence, Mi Tian did not communicate it with Ye Yuan’s through divine sense, but he said it to the old man.

That voice was furious to the extreme.

When this voice appeared, it gave the old man and Big Yellow a fright at the same time.

“Little Bull, listen to my command! Pummel this old man into a patty for me!” Mi Tian’s voice appeared again and said to Big Yellow.

Big Yellow suddenly came to his senses and said worriedly, “Master Ye, c-could it be that you were taken possession of?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “This is a senior that’s residing in my body. Him being willing to give you pointers, that’s your lucky chance!”

The moment Big Yellow heard, he could not help breathing a sigh of relief.

But he also understood that this senior dwelling in Ye Yuan’s body was definitely a true dragon as well.

To dare talk about giving pointers to a Saint Sovereign Heaven, this senior’s strength was likely extremely terrifying!

It was just that, the old man was disapproving and said disdainfully, “Some guy who doesn’t even have a physical body, you also want to deal with this exalt? This exalt’s three Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulations weren’t transcended in vain!”

“Heh,?a Saint Sovereign Heaven little fellow on a remote continent actually dares to speak to this old man in this manner, you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!” Mi Tian said with a cold laugh.

The old man sneered and said, “Is that so? Then … let this exalt witness it!”

It was only to see the old man’s palm move slightly. A terrifying force condensed and formed in his hand.

This was the power of a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. With every movement and action, it was Heavenly Dao rules!

The moment the old man moved, Big Yellow’s face revealed a solemn expression.

This old man’s strength was not the slightest bit weaker than Saint Exalt Bull Demon!

“Relax, listen to me! Bloodline power is hidden in Shen Que, Guan Yuan, activate Heavenly Dao rule …”

Mi Tian talked extremely fast, guiding Big Yellow to revolve bloodline power.

Big Yellow did not dare to be neglectful, immediately complying.

Suddenly, rules shook in the cave.

The Heavenly Dao rule inspired in Big Yellow’s body actually surpassed the old man’s very quickly!

When the old man saw the situation, his expression suddenly changed.

However, it was Big Yellow’s first time in the end. He was not as skilled as the old man.

The old man completed his move very quickly.

Without the slightest hesitation, he smacked the palm over.

Mi Tian was unhurried and said coolly, “Alright, kick your hoof!”

Big Yellow’s body became very contorted at this moment.

That appearance looked very coquettish, very profligate!

But the power was very strong!

Big Yellow’s bull face turned red from holding it in. It was as if boundless power had been suppressed within his body.

“ARGH!!”

Big Yellow let out a cry very unrestrainedly and kicked a hoof out extremely coquettishly.

The old man cried out miserably, directly smashing and embedding in the boundary wall by this hoof, spurting fresh blood out of his mouth.

Succeeding with one strike, Big Yellow was not excited, but looked at Ye Yuan with a resentful look and said, “Senior, must you perform the move like this?”

The movement earlier was seriously too coquettish. Even he felt a little embarrassed.

But the power was really strong!

Big Yellow could feel that the old man’s palm earlier was extremely powerful.

But, under a head-to-head confrontation, he was actually directly sent flying.

Mi Tian laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… comparing depravedness, you’re still far from it! Back then, Heavenly Bull’s Coquettish Profligate Hoof was really profligate! His Coquettish Profligate Hoof even directly pierced through the boundary wall! His posture was a thousand times more euphoric than yours! Practice it well. If you practice this move well, it will be enough for you to benefit for life!”

“Pfft!”?When Ye Yuan heard, he nearly spurted out a mouthful of old blood and said, “How can there be someone who could create such a coquettish move?”

Rather, when Big Yellow heard it, his expression changed drastically and he said in surprise, “H-Heavenly Bull? Could it be that Senior was a Chaos Heavenly Bull?”

Mi Tian smiled and said, “Being able to be friends with this old man, he was naturally a Chaos Heavenly Bull!”

Big Yellow drew a deep breath, his heart astonished to the extreme.

Chaos Heavenly Bull was their lineage’s supreme bloodline!

The ultimate goal of them working hard to transform was the Chaos Heavenly Bull bloodline.

It was just that Chaos Heavenly Bulls were like true dragons; extremely rare.

To the Rainclear Continent, it was naturally something impossible.

Big Yellow did not expect that this senior dwelling in Ye Yuan’s body was actually such a level of existence!

It was truly shocking to the extreme.

“Alright, you’ve already displayed this ‘Coquettish Profligate Hoof’ before. Although there’s still a long way from learning the rudiments, it’s enough to deal with this moron. I’ll leave the rest to you.”

As he said, he ignored Big Yellow, but turned to Ye Yuan and said, “Alright, urge your true dragon power to the extreme and place your dragon horn on the boundary wall. Use your heart to feel, feel Heavenly Dao rules! My true dragon race is born from chaos. Hence, we can naturally merge into chaos..”
