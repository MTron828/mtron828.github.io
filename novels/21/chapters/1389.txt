Chapter 1393 Hundred Cities Smelting Trial

“Ye Yuan, not good! Things are bad! Uh, Teacher Chi?”

Little Fatty rushed into Ye Yuan’s residence very impatiently. He discovered that Ye Yuan was sitting opposite Chi Fang.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Isn’t it just releasing a list? Is there a need to kick up such a fuss?”

Little Fatty was stunned and said, “You knew?”

Ye Yuan said, “Teacher Chi already told me. Why? You were chosen too?”

The moment Little Fatty heard, he said gleefully, “That is, of course! This Lord Fatty already made it to the sixth level in Rockwind Cave! That’s an absolute elite disciple!”

This time, it was Ye Yuan’s turn to get a shock. The Rockwind Cave was the same as the Sword Tomb; both are places to clear challenges.

It was just that the Sword Tomb was a place for cultivating Sword Dao, while the Rockwind Cave was a place to cultivate laws of wind.

This Little Fatty never said it in front of him before all this while. Ye Yuan did not expect that he actually already cleared to the Rockwind Cave’s sixth level!

One had to know that even Qin Shao was also merely Sword Tomb sixth level’s strength right now.

Little Fatty’s talent in the aspect of wind laws was truly seldom-seen.

Six years had already passed since Ye Yuan entered the Hall of Fame.

These six years’ time, Ye Yuan passed it very peacefully. Virtually no one came to find trouble with him.

Since then, the Qin Family was low-profile in front of Ye Yuan to the extreme. No one came to provoke him before.

This way, Ye Yuan’s six years were also devoted to cultivation.

He got a large batch of Tier 1 divine rank spirit medicines from the Myriad Treasure Tower and Wu Meng Academy in batches to study medicinal properties.

Ye Yuan researched for 30 years in the World Suppressing Stele and finally thoroughly grasped the medicinal properties of Tier 1 high-grade medicinal pills, and created a new batch of medicinal pills.

The Myriad Treasure Tower that obtained the pill formulas naturally made a huge fortune again.

For this, the Myriad Treasure Tower gave Ye Yuan 50 million low-grade divine essence stones again as a reward.

The remainder of the three years’ time, Ye Yuan continued to endure in the Sword Tomb to be abused, continuously perfecting Sundering Stars.

A few days ago, Ye Yuan already passed through the Sword Tomb’s third level and entered the fourth level.

Right at this time, Chi Fang came over, telling him that the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial was about to start.

And he was selected as one of the students participating in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial.

This was originally a very normal thing. The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial in itself was choosing the most outstanding students to go and take part in.

Ye Yuan’s performance was so eye-catching, there was no reason not to choose him. This had no areas for people to criticize.

But among the two teachers leading the team this time, one of them was a Qin Family’s member!

“These few years, the Qin Family has been very quiet. I didn’t expect that their goal was actually the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time! I went to find the academy head, even he can’t do anything about it either! Ye Yuan, you have to be careful on this trip!” Chi Fang said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan said, “I didn’t expect that the Qin Family’s power is so great, to actually be able to influence the decision-making of the academy!”

Chi Fang nodded and said, “The Myriad Treasure Tower is an outside force after all. Its influence in the academy is too weak. But the Qin Family is different. They have operated in Wu Meng Capital City for God knows how many generations already. Regardless of whether it is in the academy or in the City Lord Manor, their power is deeply rooted, their influence tremendous. Although they don’t dare to contend with the academy on the surface, pulling some underhanded tricks in secret is really impossible to guard against.”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Looks like the Qin Family still doesn’t know how to the word ‘pain’ is written. Then I’ll have to teach them well!”

Chi Fang gave a sigh and said, “Ye Yuan, this time ... it’s Qin Tian personally taking action! The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time, you don’t think about scoring any achievements anymore. After entering the mystic realm, best to find a place to hide and come out again when the trial ends. I’ve also arranged for an inner-court disciple this time. At that time, he’ll take care of you.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks, Teacher Chi!”

...

The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial was a joint trial carried out by a hundred capital cities in order to train the disciples under them.

Those taking part in this trial were all the pinnacle-most disciples of the various major capital cities.

Hence, Ye Yuan being selected was also something within reason.

It was just that Ye Yuan got to know from Chi Fang that the Qin Family’s descendants during this trip were as many as three people.

The Qin Family did not only have Qin Tian, one single genius.

It was just that his light was too dazzling, making others seem rather mediocre.

Apart from Qin Tian, the Qin Family disciples participating in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time also had Qin Pei and Qin Zheng, two heaven camp geniuses.

These two were also grand completion Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouses.

While outer-court disciples still had Qin Shao as well as two other Qin Family disciples.

The trial this time only selected a total of 30 disciples to take part. The Qin Family occupied six spots.

The might of the Qin Family could be seen at a glance.

In front of them was an octagonal altar. Wu Meng Academy’s students already all finished assembling, transporting from this altar into the mystic realm.

When Wen Yiyang saw that everyone was here, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Those present are all my Wu Meng Capital City’s young generation’s distinguished talents! The Hundred Cities Smelting Trial concerns my Wu Meng Capital City’s prestige. After you all enter the mystic realm, you have to make a united effort and strive for the best! But most importantly, it’s still returning safely! The academy advocates competition. Among you all, there are more or less some grudges. I don’t wish to hear some news of internecine fighting when everyone returns. Otherwise, the academy will punish the people involved with due severity!”

Finished talking, Wen Yiyang’s gaze swept over everyone’s faces. The students all felt fearful in their hearts.

Wen Yiyang’s words were actually said for the Qin Family’s people to hear.

Ye Yuan’s talent was clearly a notch above Qin Tian’s. He did not wish for Ye Yuan to have any mishap.

It was just that this time, the Qin Family exerted pressure through the Elders Association, making the Qin Family’s Qin Yuanlong lead the team, adding many variables.

Wen Yiyang had no choice and could only give a warning or two verbally.

The rest will have to depend on Ye Yuan himself.

“Academy Head, rest assured. Yuanlong definitely won’t fail the mission this time!” Qin Yuanlong immediately expressed his attitude. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Wen Yiyang nodded his head but did not say much. He just said coolly, “Alright, set off.”

The group stood on the altar. But when Ye Yuan turned back, Little Fatty’s figure was already gone, and he involuntarily started searching in the crowd. Ye Yuan discovered that he already ran to a very delicate and pretty looking girl’s side since goodness knows when.

The normally casual Little Fatty actually became bashful at this time, rather like a lady.

“X-Xiu-er,” Xie Jingyi said shyly.

Ye Yuan came to a realization. It turned out that this senior apprentice sister was the Xiu-er in Xie Jingyi’s mouth, Lin Xiu!

This kid really hid deep enough, to actually not even mention it to him until now.

Ye Yuan thought all along that Lin Xiu should still be in Brilliant Peace City. Did not expect that she was actually an inner-court heaven camp disciple.

Seeing Xie Jingyi said hello, Lin Xiu’s brows furrowed, and she said, “Call me your senior apprentice sister!”

Xie Jingyi’s expression changed, and he said stammeringly, “S-Senior Apprentice Sister!”

Lin Xiu’s brows spread out slightly. Her tone also eased up a little, and she said, “I didn’t expect that you actually really passed the entrance examination! Furthermore, you even obtained the qualifications to participate in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial!”

Xie Jingyi had a look of joy and said, “That is, of course! I am a grown man. If I can’t even do this, how can I be fit to be Xiu-er’s man?”
