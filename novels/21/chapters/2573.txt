Chapter 2579: Talent Testing!

On Tianhui Peak, more than 2000 ascenders were gathered here.

Want to talk about the number of ascenders in ten years, it was naturally much more than this.

But among ascenders, there were scanty few who were able to hold on until the arrival of guides.

Therefore, in the massive True Yang Heavenly Domain, only these 2000 over ascenders were gathered.

On the grandstand halfway up the mountain, several old men were currently whispering to each other.

“Brother Qin, Jingxuan that lass was forcefully snatched by you the last time! This time, if there are any good saplings, you can’t fight with me!”

“Heh,?Old Man Wu, each entrance examination, there are only those few whose affinity meets the standard. Whether or not you can snatch depends on your ability! I can’t yield on this!”

“You! Good! You old thing, let’s not rest until we’re dead this time!”

“Huhu?… Old Man Wu, comparing pill refining, you’re still a little lacking. Who asked you to not have our unique skill!”

That Old Man Wu was angered until he billowed his beard and glared but was powerless to do anything.

The two people talking, one was called Qin Shun, the other was called Wu Chengchao

The two were both Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s purple-wing protectors, their statuses even a level higher than Luo Yunqing’s.

No reason other than because the two were grade three heavenly alchemists!

In Five Light Heavenly Region, grade three heavenly alchemists were extremely scarce talents.

Only in Martial Secure Heavenly Sect, this kind of major sect, could one see grade three heavenly alchemists!

The statuses of these two could be seen at a glance.

However, grade three heavenly alchemists were few, but there were even fewer heavenly alchemist talents!

The innate condition of ascenders was seriously too weak. Those who could reach 30 point affinity this boundary, was even rarer.

And 30 points was just the threshold to becoming a heavenly alchemist!

Want to reach grade three heavenly alchemist, without 50 and above affinity, one could forget about it.

The sect assessment ten years ago, a genius disciple whose affinity reached 59 appeared, called Wen Jingxuan.

Her appearance naturally caused a fierce competition between these two people.

For this, the two almost came to blows.

But in the end, Wen Jingxuan still chose the aboriginal heavenly alchemist, Qin Shun.

This Qin Shun was an aboriginal heavenly alchemist.

Martial Secure Heavenly Sect naturally spent a lot of thought and price in order to poach him.

At this time, a protector said loudly, “You all will pass through that array formation ahead one by one, the array formation will automatically discern your talent! There are nine aptitude qualifications, lower-inferior is the lowest, upper-superior is the highest! If there’s anyone among you all whose aptitude is superior, then congratulations, the sect master will personally accept you as a disciple! Of course, this is virtually impossible! Those who are judged as upper-middle and above after passing through the array formation can all enter the next round! Or, if your affinity can reach 30 points, you can also enter under the Alchemist Hall. The rest, descend the mountain! Now, the entrance assessment begins!”

To ascenders, there were scanty few whose affinity reached 30 points and above.

But, it was also not absolute.

In the Lower Realms, some people’s physiques were special, approaching pre-natal physiques. Their affinity would reach 30 or more too.

And these people’s talent in comprehending Dao tend to similarly be outstanding too.

Hence, ascender heavenly alchemists were often martial path powerhouses.

Furthermore, every few years, some heaven-defying figures would also appear among these ascenders, their affinity very abnormal.

Just like the Wen Jingxuan in the previous period, her affinity even reached a terrifying 59 points!

Even many native heavenly alchemists were not as high as her too.

This kind of person could be said to be the darling of heaven.

And this sort of people often did not cultivate in the Lower Realms for a long time, virtually crushing all the way and ascending to the 33 Heavens.

Of course, a monstrous genius like Wen Jingxuan was extremely rare!

It was also precisely because of this that Qin Shun had always treated her as a treasure.

One had to know, Qin Shun’s own affinity was also merely 56 points!

“I’ll go first!”

A burly man took the lead to step out of the ranks.

This burly man held two axes in his hands and did not deliberately deploy, but the show in strength was extremely shocking.

One look and it was clear that he was not to be trifled with.

He arrived in front of the array formation and said with a chuckle, “Your Father’s two axes slaughtered until the Void God World’s sun and moon dimmed! Arriving at Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, I’ll also kill gods if gods block, and kill Buddha if Buddha blocks! My aptitude has to be high-level no matter what, right?”

The group of ascenders nodded their heads one after another. This burly man gave people a strong deterrent at a glance, he was definitely not to be trifled with.

If his aptitude did not reach high-level, it would not be justified.

But that protector gave an enigmatic smile.

The burly man was also not long-winded, directly entering the array formation.

The grand array lit up, emitting rays of light.

Testing the aptitude was very fast, in just less than ten breaths of time, the big man was out.

After coming up, he looked at the light screen in front of the grand array with a look of anticipation too. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Very soon, a row of words appeared on the light screen.

Dao physique: post-natal Dao physique.

Aptitude: upper-inferior.

Affinity: 17.

Everyone was dumbfounded!

“This … This is impossible! How can Your Father’s aptitude possibly be so bad? There must be something wrong with this array formation!” The burly man said with a look of disbelief.

That protector said coolly, “Regardless whether you came from a great trichiliocosm or small chiliocosm, that place is a completely different level of plane from the 33 Heavens! Here, no matter how powerful you were before, it’s all useless! You might still not be able to differentiate the relative superiority or inferiority among yourselves yet. But once you enter the heavenly sect, the gap will soon be widened! Even if you’re not willing to admit it, it won’t do either! Alright, descend the mountain!”

The burly man gritted his teeth and said, “Your Father isn’t convinced! There must be something wrong with this array formation!”

The protector did not get angry. Clearly, he had encountered this kind of situation too often.

He just smiled slightly and said, “Yun Qing, you go.”

At this time, a young man dressed in outer-sect disciple attire floated down and arrived in front of the burly man.

The protector said coolly, “He entered the heavenly sect ten years ago, his talent is only upper-middle. His current realm is also only middle Lesser Sublime Heaven! You’re a minor realm higher than him, if you can beat him, there’s no harm in accepting you into the sect too.”

The burly man’s gaze turned sharp and he said with a chuckle, “This is what you said!”

The protector nodded lightly and said, “I said it!”

The burly man looked at Yun Qing, like a tiger looking at a baby.

He chuckled and said, “This senior apprentice brother, if I hurt you anywhere, don’t blame me!”

Yun Qing smiled slightly and said, “Feel free to make a move!”

Whoosh!

His voice had yet to fade and the ax already chopped out.

That momentum felt like he was going to split the earth in half.

The ascenders were all gloating over others’ misfortune, thinking to themselves that this protector was really funny.

Which of them had not experienced many battles, how could they be leapfrogged in cultivation realm and be defeated?

Clank!

Yun Qing’s sword came out of its sheath and actually clashed head-on with that terrifying ax.

What was even more frightening was that he actually caught it deftly!

Everyone had stunned faces!

So strong!

The following battle made all of the ascenders’ jaws drop.

When the burly man’s one move was defeated, he was completely suppressed by Yun Qing.

Ten moves later, signs of defeat already appeared.

With 13 moves and the axes were directly sent flying!

The burly man lost!

“How could this be? That Yun Qing is actually so strong!”

“I’ve fought with that burly man before, he’s extremely strong! He actually only lasted 13 moves!”

“Could it be that this is the difference in talent?”

… …

Each and every one of the ascenders was in disbelief.
