Chapter 2450: You Hurt Me and Laughed It Off!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Stepping into this valley, Ye Yuan felt tremendous pressure.

This kind of pressure, Ye Yuan did not even feel before on the nine great Dao Ancestors’ bodies.

On both sides, were rows of statues of different shapes and colors.

The oppression emanating off each statue was actually no less than late-stage Nine-marks powerhouses!

Ye Yuan had seen the appearance of these statues before. It was precisely those eight statues that he saw at the Hidden Lineage.

It was just that the statues here were of different shapes, but much more complex than the Hidden Lineage.

Passing through this corridor of statues, Ye Yuan arrived at the entrance of a huge cave.

The terrifying undulation that he felt came from precisely here..

Ye Yuan knew that this place was where the divine race’s truly powerful secret lied!

Two figures appeared at the entrance of the cave, making Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly turned stiff.

“You came?” Yue Mengli opened her mouth and said. Her tone was still indescribably distant.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Mn, I came to see what turns you into like this.”

Yue Mengli said coolly, “This is how I am originally. In the past, it’s just that I didn’t awaken.”

Ye Yuan’s heart felt pain without any cause, but he still said, “I’ll bring you home.”

Yue Mengli did not speak, but her expression was indescribably contemptuous.

At this time, the old man next to her smiled and said, “You’re Ye Yuan? Hoho, this old man waited for ten billion years in order to see you!”

The old man’s smile was very contorted. The aura on his entire person was very messy.

A little ... hideous and unsightly.

He looked like he suffered very serious injuries.

However, Ye Yuan did not remember that he had met him before.

“Oh? Why do you want to see me?” Ye Yuan asked doubtfully.

The old man’s expression suddenly became extremely savage and he said with a strange smile, “Why do I want to see you? Jeje ... It’s you who made this old man suffer ten billion years of torment in the ancestral land! It’s you who made this old look neither like a human nor a ghost! Why do you think this old man wants to see you?!”

A terrifying aura instantly spread out, locking onto Ye Yuan instantaneously.

That imposing aura was actually not much weaker than Originsmile!

This old man was actually an existence close to a progenitor!

However, Ye Yuan’s countenance did not change when facing the nine great Dao Ancestors. So why would he fear an old man?

He just shrugged and said coolly, “How would I know? What does the torment you suffered have to do with me?”

Ye Yuan’s expression triggered the old man deeply.

He suddenly became incomparably berserk and said with a furious roar, “You caused this old man to become like this and still dare to laugh it off? Because you and that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets hid from this old man’s surveillance, this old man suffered the agony of being sliced into thousands of pieces here for ten billion years because of self-condemnation! You dare say that it has nothing to do with you?”

The current old man had bloodshot eyes and was incomparably maniacal, almost rampaging.

Clearly, he hated Ye Yuan to the extreme!

And Ye Yuan finally discerned a clue.

He revealed a faint look of enlightenment and said, “So, you’re Celestial Master Miluo!”

Ye Yuan had once heard of this Celestial Master Miluo from Jian Rufeng.

Back then, although Jian Rufeng and Celestial Master Miluo did not have a frontal confrontation, they had crossed swords secretly for countless years.

It was just that Celestial Master Miluo himself was not aware.

However, Jian Rufeng also had the greatest esteem for this Celestial Master Miluo, lauding his divination arts with praises unceasingly.

Jian Rufengw was also merely a hairsbreadth stronger than Celestial Master Miluo.

Hence, he had to borrow the power of 100 Jian Family powerhouses before he could shield heaven’s secrets!

Ten billion years ago, Ye Yuan had once appeared before and had also once attracted Celestial Master Miluo’s attention.

It was just a pity that Ye Yuan traveled across time and space, heaven’s secrets were fleeting and ephemeral. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Coupled with that Ye Yuan himself was incomparably unpredictable, therefore, Celestial Master Miluo could not find him at all.

Furthermore, the time that Ye Yuan appeared was extremely short. Later on, he even disappeared. Therefore, Miluo never met Ye Yuan before at all.

However, it was precisely these two guys that he had never seen before who made him suffer endless humiliation, making him suffer the agony of being sliced to a thousand pieces in the ancestral land!

This misery, only he himself understood it.

What was even more infuriating was that he was defeated without rhyme or reason!

He did not even know who his opponent was!

Only all the way until recently, when the legend of Azure and Profound Dual Saints came to light among the human race, did Celestial Master Miluo woke up like a dream!

Combining with the Heavenly Dao that he divined back then, it was not difficult for Celestial Master Miluo to divine that Ye Yuan was precisely that person that he kept looking for back then but could not find!

Today, when he saw Ye Yuan, this fury could not be contained any longer and erupted!

“Jeje ... Brat, turns out that you know this old man huh! You caused this old man to have no peace for ten billion years. Today, you actually delivered yourself to the doorstep. You can’t be forgiven!” Celestial Master Miluo said with a strange laugh.

Ye Yuan had a sad expression on his face as he said, “Sorry about it, causing you to become like this. I blame myself very much in my heart.”

Celestial Master Miluo sneered and said, “It’s too late to blame yourself now!”

Ye Yuan hurriedly waved his hand and said excitedly, “Not too late, not too late. I blame myself that you’re not miserable enough yet! To actually run into you today, it’s really great!”

Celestial Master Miluo’s expression changed wildly, and he roared, “Courting death!”

A terrifying aura instantly erupted. Celestial Master Miluo raised his hand and it was a punch, the entire space started trembling.

The horrifying power of Heavenly Dao directly constricted the space where Ye Yuan was standing to the extreme.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled and his figure flashed, instantly disappearing from where he was!

Boom!

Celestial Master Miluo’s punch missed and his expression could not help changing wildly.

“Brat, I see where you can run to in my divine race’s ancestral land!”

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Celestial Master Miluo completely erupted, hitting until the void trembled.

However, this ancestral land’s space seemed to be protected by some inexplicable power, it actually did not collapse.

It was just that no matter how hard Celestial Master Miluo attacked, he could not touch a corner of Ye Yuan’s sleeves.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Celestial Master Miluo, you surveyed the world for the divine race. Have you counted how many have died at your hands directly and indirectly? The crimes that you’ve committed are too numerous to be recorded! These ten billion years aren’t even enough to redeem your crimes! Do you feel pain now? Then those myriad races’ geniuses who died in your hands, do you understand their pain?”

Ye Yuan’s words were full of disdain.

Celestial Master Miluo surveyed the world and was also the most notorious executioner at that time!

The myriad races’ geniuses that died at his hands were simply beyond counting!

How could these crimes be what ten billion years could redeem?

Ye Yuan felt that it was not enough!

Celestial Master Miluo roared angrily, “Rubbish! My divine race towers above the myriad races! Those ants actually dared to rebel against my divine race, death isn’t regrettable!”

But Ye Yuan laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Is that so? Looks like you hate me very much, then I appeared in front of you, and you also can’t finish me off. Does it feel very uncomfortable? Is the divine race very impressive? You, a progenitor class powerhouse, can’t even take care of me, this new Deva Realm? Really disgraceful!”

Sure enough, Celestial Master Miluo was driven crazy by Ye Yuan’s words. His so many years of humiliation finally found a place to vent.

Now, he actually could not do anything to the other party!

Nothing was more maddening than this.
