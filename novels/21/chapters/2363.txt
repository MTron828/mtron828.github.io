Chapter 2369: Return to Zero!

The old man said with shock in his heart, “Disregarding talent, the tenacity of this boy’s heart isn’t beneath this old man’s!”

Just as Sacred Ancestor High Priest said back then, temperament was the key to becoming a supreme powerhouse.

For the old man to be able to achieve a supreme position, mastering two supreme laws at the same time, the strength of his temperament naturally went without saying.

But he never thought that Ye Yuan actually had such terrifying tenacity!

He understood that the agony of being sliced into thousands of pieces was not what ordinary people could endure at all.

Especially those so-called geniuses, their hearts were loftier than the sky. So how could they bear this kind of inhumane torture?

Furthermore, it was not even one time!

It was over and over again!

Ye Yuan was clearly already afraid to the extreme, scared until he was unable to even walk normally.

But he still forced himself to jump down again and again!

In this place, there would not be true death.

But this agony was a thousand times, ten thousand times, even scarier than death!

What was most terrifying was not death, but clearly knowing that the process of death was extremely terrifying, but had no choice but to face it.

Could Ye Yuan choose not to face it?

Of course he could!

However, he resolutely chose to face it!

Would death become numb?

No!

Each time he went down the spacetime vortex, the pain of each blade was reminding Ye Yuan that this was another samsara!

He was not able to be numb.

Not only would he not be numb, but that sense of fear would also increase along with the number of times, and grow with each passing day.

Ye Yuan’s body also went from the starting slight trembling to the spasming-like shaking later on.

He did not want to tremble, but he could not control himself.

Each time he jumped, he had to exhaust all of his strength.

But once he jumped down, he would die.

Then, it was another samsara.

“Kid, what is it that supports you to do things to this extent?” Three days later, the old man finally could not resist asking Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan stood on the edge of the vortex, turned to the old man, and said smilingly, “I have a reason that leaves me no choice but to become strong! Some people are still waiting for me to go and save! Of course, I also won’t passively watch the human race go extinct!”

The old man was moved and said, “Those people must be very important to you.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “The love of my life!”

The old man let out a sigh and said, “Pray ask what is love, guiding people till death do them apart! Kid, you’re very determined. It’s just that a thousand years’ time is too short! With your talent, you probably can’t comprehend the spacetime inheritance!”

Not that the time was too short, but that spacetime law was too hard.

Such a supreme inheritance, how could it be comprehended in a short thousand years?

Forget about comprehending, even standing in the vortex for an hour was harder than ascending to heaven.

Ye Yuan ignored the old man’s lamentation, and he leaped once more, jumping down.

Of course, the conclusion was always surprisingly similar.

Along with the passage of time, the time that Ye Yuan stood outside the vortex also became longer and longer.

To him, taking the last step required tremendous courage.

In this blink of an eye, it was 30 years!

During these 30 years, Ye Yuan already could not remember how many times he died.

But he could never last for long inside the vortex.

Which was also to say that he did not cross the threshold.

Using 30 years’ time to make a futile effort, it looked like a very foolish action in the eyes of bystanders, but Ye Yuan did not think so.

What he believed in, was that as long as time was sunk in, an iron rod could be ground into a needle.

“Kid, do you really still want to persist? At this rate, your mind won’t be able to bear the breakdown! At that time, even though your physical body won’t die, you can only be an idiot too! Young Man, why be so persistent?” The old man could not resist persuading again.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How can there be a smooth-sailing thing in this world? Want to obtain the supreme inheritance, but not be willing to take the risk, how can there be such a good thing in this world? Senior, you don’t need to persuade me again!”

Finished saying this, he turned around and wanted to jump.

His foot had just stepped out but withdrew again.

The moment the old man saw, he smiled and said, “Kid, finally gave up? Not that this ancestor is looking down on you, but it’s truly that you don’t have this strength.”

But Ye Yuan smiled radiantly and said, “I seem to have understood something! Many thanks, Senior!”

The old man’s expression changed, but saw Ye Yuan leap, entering the vortex once more.

But this time, Ye Yuan did not employ spacetime law!

He jumped into the vortex without any obstruction just like that.

When Ye Yuan returned to the shore again, the old man had a blank look as he said, “What did you understand?”

He still thought that Ye Yuan comprehended, but in the end, there did not seem to be any changes.

Was this kid purposely misleading people by making things look mysterious?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior said that I’m too stubborn. It’s indeed the case! I’ve always been thinking about using my spatial law to resist the spacetime vortex here. The two aren’t powers on the same level at all, so what comprehension is there to talk about? Furthermore, Senior said before that my spatial law was born because of Sword Dao. It deviated from the power of source to begin with. I used a deviated path to go and comprehend the right path, so how can it possibly succeed? Therefore, I simply returned my spatial law to zero, to go and feel the mighty torrent power in the vortex without the least bit of obstruction, maybe ... it will have a miraculous effect.”

As he said, Ye Yuan walked toward the vortex once more.

Although this time, he was still trembling.

While the old man had a look of astonishment, he also had a feeling that Ye Yuan seemed to have found the right path!

Even he did not expect that Ye Yuan kept on failing to comprehend spacetime was actually because of this reason.

But his unintentional words gave Ye Yuan great inspiration.

However, the shock in the old man’s heart grew even stronger.

One had to know, Ye Yuan’s spatial law was already comprehended to the boundary of rank eight.

People all had thinking derived from experience, reaching rank eight, it was naturally going a step further to go and comprehend source.

But Ye Yuan could let go of the obsession in his heart, and think of returning to zero, this method. It was absolutely rare in this world!

“Could it be that this kid is really an extraordinary talent?” The old man exclaimed.

Hence, Ye Yuan set off anew and fell into the endless cycle of samsara again.

Finally, around 100 plus years, Ye Yuan stepped into the spacetime vortex for the first time!

However, the power of law in the outer-peripherals was already so terrifying, let alone inside the vortex?

Ye Yuan just entered the vortex and was ground to dust by the terrifying spacetime turbulent flow.

The old man opened his mouth wide as if he had seen something beyond comprehension.

The old man said in shock, “He actually really entered it! This ... This has just been only over 100 years!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Reviving back at the shore, Ye Yuan had an excited expression.

In one hundred years of samsara, he had to die countless times every day!

This sort of thing, even thinking about it felt terrifying.

But he pulled through!

This endless pain, this endless effort, was worth it!

“Hahaha ... finally entered! Senior, I really have to thank you! If not for you, I would have probably never been able to enter the spacetime vortex in this lifetime!” Ye Yuan said to the old man excitedly.

But the old man’s expression was somewhat ugly.

What did I do?

I did nothing at all!

This kid wouldn’t be intentionally making a dig at me, right?
