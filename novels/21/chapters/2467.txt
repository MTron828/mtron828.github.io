Chapter 2473: The Man on the Same Level as Heaven!

“No! It’s still not right! Could it be that the way we’re studying is wrong?” Ancestor Fire said a little anxiously.

Dao Ancestor Destruction frowned and said, “It’s impossible! In terms of comprehending Great Dao, who understands it better than us?”

Ancestor Lightning said, “It’s really strange! What method did Ye Yuan use to comprehend the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain? In what way is his approach being completely different from ours?”

The few great Dao Ancestors spoke up one after another, all feeling rather agitated and fretful.

They had already studied the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain for close to three years’ time.

Without a doubt, each of their strengths had increased greatly.

It was just that, it had not met their requirements yet.

Studying according to this method could certainly increase their strength and consolidate their realm.

But there was no hope of wanting to break the fetters of Dao Ancestor at all!”

These few years, they mutually shared the things that they had understood, discussing with each other.

But the results yielded were negligible.

Their objective was to break the shackles of Dao Ancestor.

It was just that no matter how they cultivated, that shackle was still locking them tightly, not letting them break through.

This sort of feeling made them feel despair.

They even compared their cultivation comprehensions with Ye Yuan’s cultivation method and martial techniques.

As a result, the more they compared, the more bitterly disappointed they were.

The strength and potential that Ye Yuan displayed was completely not what they could hold a candle to!

In the end, the conclusion that they got was that … Ye Yuan was different from them!

It was just that they racked their brains and also could not figure out just what was different.

Lin Chaotian was silent. No one knew what he was thinking about either.

The nine of them were the Heavenspan World’s strongest nine people, and also the nine people who understood Heavenly Dao most profoundly.

Logically speaking, having obtained such a priceless treasure, the things that they comprehended should also be beyond other people’s capacity.

But sadly, they still could not reach Ye Yuan’s height.

No matter how they studied, it would not work!

When Ancestor Fire saw that Lin Chaotian did not speak, he could not resist asking, “Brother Chaotian, say something!”

Only then did Lin Chaotian slowly say, “I think that it might be the way that we’re comprehending is wrong!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s eyes lit up.

“Oh??Then how should we comprehend?” Ancestor Fire said with a look of excitement.

“Go to Heavenspan Mountain!” Lin Chaotian said.

… …

In a blink of an eye, another three years passed. Above a million miles up on Heavenspan Mountain, the nine great Dao Ancestors were very dispirited.

A feeling called sense of defeat spread out among the nine people.

“Damn it! Just where does the problem lie?”

“The Heavenspan Mountain and Lesser Heavenspan Mountain mutually corroborate and reference each other, but why can’t we find the way to break through yet?”

“God damn it! This ancestor can seemingly see Ye Yuan’s mocking laugh!”

… …

The expressions of the few Dao Ancestors were very ugly.

That mocking smile when Ye Yuan left seemed to be dangling in front of them.

Ye Yuan had said this before more than once. Even if he gave the treasure to them, it was useless too!

They all could not comprehend it! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The nine great Dao Ancestors were outstanding talents of the present era, figures standing at the summit. How proud were they?

Hence, they naturally did not believe it!

They thought that Ye Yuan being able to have today’s accomplishments, it was him relying entirely on the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

But now, reality slapped their faces fiercely.

They really could not comprehend it!

Combining the power of the nine great Dao Ancestors and they still could not comprehend it too!

After six years of hard work, they could not find a trace of clue!

Breaking the shackles was far away and not within the foreseeable future.

The reality was so cruel.

Lin Chaotian’s brows were tightly locked when he suddenly said, “Ye Yuan this guy indeed makes people unable to figure out! But did you all notice, when he broke through to Deva Realm, he actually didn’t transcend the Deva blight tribulation! This sort of thing is too inconceivable!”

Ancestor Water’s intelligence was second only to Lin Chaotian.

Seeing Lin Chaotian talk about it, he nodded and said, “Originally, we all thought that he relied on the power of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. That’s how he shielded from the Deva blight tribulation! But looking at it now, it wasn’t the case!”

Lin Chaotian nodded and said, “That’s right! I also used to think so. But thinking about it carefully now, it doesn’t seem to be the case!”

The two people chimed in one after another, Ancestor Fire said rather impatiently, “Then you guys say, just where does the problem lie?”

The two people said in unison, “Cultivation method!”

The group of Dao Ancestors was stunned, uncertain what it meant.

In terms of cultivation method, who in this world could compare to the few of them?

Moreover, what kind of cultivation method could avoid the Deva blight tribulation?

“I say, the two of you, stop leaving us hanging and hurry it up!” Ancestor Fire said.

Lin Chaotian’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Studying the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain these few years, I faintly have a feeling that Ye Yuan might have comprehended an astonishing cultivation method from it! This set of cultivation methods might be on the same level as heaven! Hence, that’s how he could avoid the Deva blight tribulation!”

The more Lin Chaotian talked, the more shocked everyone was.

It was only to see him continue explaining it. He said, “Do you all still remember what I said, the Heavenspan Mountain cast a projection back then and the spiritual energy revived? I always thought that that was a precious treasure coming into existence. That’s why that kind of phenomenon appeared! But thinking back on it now, that isn’t the case at all! It should be Ye Yuan comprehended successfully a set of cultivation methods back then, alarming Heavenly Dao. That’s why such a phenomenon would descend! There should exist some kind of connection between the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain and Heavenspan Mountain. Back then, the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain should have been refined by him, stirring the Heavenspan Mountain. That’s why it made spiritual energy revive!”

“Therefore, we were wrong from the start! The crux of the problem doesn’t lie with the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain at all, but on the person who comprehended the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain!”

When the group of Dao Ancestors heard this analysis, each and every one of them was dumbstruck with amazement.

They really wanted to find a reason to refute it, but they discovered that they could not find it at all!

What Lin Chaotian said made too much sense!

Ancestor Fire said unhappily, “Based on what? He could comprehend a cultivation method, so can’t we do it? Combining the nine of our strengths, can it be that we still can’t create an astonishing cultivation method?”

Lin Chaotian shook his head and said, “Comprehending a cultivation method isn’t hard! With the few of our capabilities, comprehending eight or ten top cultivation methods from the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain is very easy! It’s just that wanting to comprehend a cultivation method that’s on the same level as heaven is as hard as ascending to heaven! I can confirm that Ye Yuan is absolutely not the first person who obtained the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. But he’s the only one who can create such a terrifying cultivation method! I’m afraid that even if the cultivation method that Ye Yuan created is placed in front of us, we might not be able to fully comprehend it too! Hence, that’s why he handed the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain over so readily. Because he’s confident that even if the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain is handed over to us, it’s impossible for us to surpass him too!”

Talking until the back, Lin Chaotian’s words actually exuded some bitterness.

Several years of hard work made him become increasingly conscious of his insignificance.

Dao Ancestors were very strong, but also very weak!

In front of Heavenly Dao, Dao Ancestors were too weak!

But Ye Yuan was a man on the same level as heaven!

This sense of setback was too strong.

The Dao Ancestors were extremely shocked, being not quite able to accept this fact.

Combining the powers of nine great Dao Ancestors actually could not beat a single Ye Yuan?

This sort of thing was truly hard to accept to the high and mighty Dao Ancestors.

“Damn it! We have to think of a way to find him and force him to hand over the cultivation method!” Ancestor Fire gritted his teeth and said.

Lin Chaotian looked up to the sky and let out a long sigh and said, “Too late! His wings have already formed now! Wanting to capture him is simply impossible!”
