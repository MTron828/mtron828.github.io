Chapter 2560: The Best One Naturally Has to Be Saved for My Own People!

“No way, right? Gave it away! It’s the Jasper Regeneration Pill, but he actually gave it away!”

“What the hell! He gave it away, rather than giving it to Xie Hua! Ruthless!”

“Ye Yuan is being unfair! Tang Yu still has a severed arm, he actually gave the Jasper Regeneration Pill away!”

… …

This action of Ye Yuan’s immediately caused a hubbub.

Of course, the ones who were the most displeased were still the Tang Family.

Tang Jinhua’s brows furrowed slightly. Clearly, he was somewhat unhappy.

He refined the Jasper Regeneration Pill, and it actually was not given to Tang Yu straight away. He found this unacceptable.

How much risk the Tang Family shouldered for Ye Yuan, fussing around him, he actually gave the heavenly pill to an irrelevant person!

That person obtained the Jasper Regeneration Pill and was immensely grateful to Ye Yuan.

He was afraid that someone would snatch it, so he swallowed it right away.

At this time, the emperor brought Second Prince and came down from the second floor.

Behind them, Eldest Prince’s figure was gone. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Clearly, the die was cast!

The joy on Second Prince’s face could not be concealed no matter what.

The emperor gave Lin Lan a glance and could not refrain from sighing.

He seriously did not expect that this old brother of his would also have times where he stumbled.

But the origin divinity contract was already signed. If he did not carry it out, Lin Lan would be dead for sure!

The emperor arrived in front of Ye Yuan and said with a frown, “Since the victor has been decided, then We will confer the position of nation teacher to you!”

Ye Yuan gave a hand gesture and said smilingly, “Your Majesty, you don’t need to be anxious. It’s such a fine occasion today. I see that there are many people with missing limbs. Since this Ye is going to be the nation teacher, I naturally have to share in Your Majesty’s worries. Why not this Ye refine pills in public for sale? What does Your Majesty think?”

The emperor said in surprise, “You’re already like this. Can you still refine?”

In his view, this Jasper Regeneration Pill being able to become a pill was more of a coincidence.

But the origin divinity contract was placed there.

If it was done, it was done. He could not go back on his words too.

One heavenly pill already drained Ye Yuan.

With another one, could this guy bear it?

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I think that Nation Teacher is unconvinced by his loss. Since that’s the case, I’ll make more a little more convinced! Your Majesty, please deploy a batch of heavenly medicines over. Leave the severed limbs of these guards to this Ye.”

In the royal family, these guards with severed limbs were not in the minority.

But Ye Yuan saying this was a generous move.

Furthermore, it was even free!

Got to admit, this was a big gift to the emperor.

The emperor mused for a moment and said in a solemn voice, “Yu Tang, you go and make arrangements!”

Second Prince gladly accepted the order!

Xie Hua suddenly gave a cold snort and said, “He’s already struggling heavily to refine one! In my view, you’re making fun of His Majesty!”

His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of hatred!

The action just now, Ye Yuan had humiliated him greatly.

Ye Yuan rather gave the pill to a guard for free than give it to him!

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “If I were you, I’d shut up right now! You have to know, the nation teacher isn’t your master now, but me! It’s just a matter of a word to kill you!”

Xie Hua’s body trembled, full of fear, and sure enough, he shut up.

Before long, Second Prince brought a large number of heavenly medicines over.

The royal family’s treasures were naturally not what the Tang Family could compare to.

At this time, Ye Yuan was pretty much done resting. He was not long-winded, directly getting to work with refining the pills.

People all thought that Ye Yuan would be like the last time, collapsing from exhaustion in the end.

However, they were disappointed!

This time, Ye Yuan refined very smoothly.

Although it was still very strenuous, those signs of exhaustion previously did not appear.

This made everyone incredibly surprised!

“This … What’s going on here? Could it be that he was performing previously?”

“There’s no need! Being exhausted until like that, even if it’s a performance, it’s also too much, right?”

“I say, guys, it wouldn’t really be his first time refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill previously, right? Because there’s experience now, so it’s going a lot smoother this time!”

… …

Seeing this situation, everyone naturally speculated heavily.

Honestly speaking, they did not believe a single one of Ye Yuan’s words.

Refined five years of basic heavenly pills and one would be able to refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill?

Then heavenly alchemists would also be too worthless!

Ye Yuan must have deceived everybody through some method in these five years and bitterly trained in high level heavenly pills in secret!

But the expression on Lin Lan’s face became incomparably solemn.

Because he discovered that Ye Yuan’s refining technique was far more mellow and smooth than before.

Although the refinement before was enough to serve as an example, there were clearly many areas that were not mellowed and smooth.

And this also resulted in the situation of divine essence being insufficient in the end.

But now, Ye Yuan’s allocation of divine essence as well as the use of his technique was obviously much more reasonable.

What did this show?

This showed that Ye Yuan was improving!

It was just that this improvement speed was too terrifying!

The second heavenly pill was worth more than ten years of his hard work!

Could it be that it was really this guy’s first time refining the Jasper Regeneration Pill?

First time refining such a high difficulty heavenly pill and he succeeded in one go?

This was too bloody freakish, right?!

Lin Lan could not find any words to describe the shock in his heart currently.

Could a person’s alchemy talent actually be strong to such an extent?

No, absolutely impossible!

Lin Lan furrowed his brows and racked his brain for ideas, wanting to find where the problem lay.

Suddenly, his entire body trembled, and he thought of a certain possibility.

Basic heavenly pills!

Could there really be something fishy about these basic heavenly pills?

Could one really refine the Jasper Regeneration Pill after mastering basic heavenly pills?

“Condense!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry and the Jasper Regeneration Pill was done!

This time, the quality was obviously much better than last time!

The guard who obtained the heavenly pill swallowed it happily.

Following that, Ye Yuan rested for a while and continued to refine pills.

One after another, people’s shock also grew more and more!

Because Ye Yuan’s speed of improvement was seriously too fast!

Second Prince had long already ordered someone to fetch the Cloud Mount Mother Stone. For each heavenly pill that Ye Yuan produced, there would be someone who would check the quality.

From the starting lower second grade to upper third grade, then to upper fourth grade, and reaching the terrifying upper sixth grade in the end!

The quality of the Jasper Regeneration Pill jumped up grade after grade!

Those guards who received the heavenly pills before were almost crying.

The higher the quality, naturally the more compatible the new limb grown would be with the body.

“Too terrifying! This kind of improvement speed is simply too heavenly defying!”

“F*cking hell, it’s my first time hearing that the Jasper Regeneration Pill can be refined like this!”

“Nation Teacher is simply weak to the max in front of Ye Yuan! Looks like this wager, Nation Teacher didn’t lose unjustly!”

… …

Amidst the cries of exclamations, people were long already prostrating on all fours in admiration towards Ye Yuan.

This kind of improvement was definitely not an act.

Maybe you could not see with one or two, but putting so many medicinal pills together, that sort of continuous improvement was clear at a glance!

While the emperor’s eyes were sparkling.

The pleasant surprise that Ye Yuan brought to him was too strong, making him feel like he obtained a priceless treasure.

The sense of loss because of losing Lin Lan previously had long already been swept clean!

Lin Lan was simply dust on the ground when compared to Ye Yuan!

“Condense!”

Another Jasper Regeneration Pill was done. Ye Yuan threw it to Tang Yu and said with a smile, “The best one naturally has to be saved for my own people!”
