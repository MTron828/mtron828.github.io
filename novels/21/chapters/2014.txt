Chapter 2018: Does This Work?

“Such an exquisite fire controlling technique! Burned a head full of hair but the person is completely fine.”

“That young man is really capable! I even thought that he was bragging!”

“Looks like tigers are crouching and dragons are hidden in the Cloudpill Summit this time!”

...

After the loud laughter, everyone finally came to realize the truth about the prowess of Ye Yuan’s fire controlling technique.

Even the bald Zheng Qian also felt lingering fear.

His experience was more vivid than others. The fire burned on top of his head, not leaving him a single strand. It was as if it was shaved using a razor blade.

But he did not feel any heat at all.

This fire controlling technique was simply inconceivable.

Most likely, even Big Brother Qun also could not do it to this extent either, right?

Zheng Qian thought in his heart.

Looking at the direction Ye Yuan left, Zheng Qian gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Damn fellow, don’t let me run into him again! To dare humiliate my Zheng Family, this young master will definitely teach you a lesson!”

...

“Your Excellency, you were really too cool just now! Hehe, that snotty brat actually still wanted to challenge you, really overestimating his own ability,” Ning Siyu said with an excited face.

Ye Yuan shot her a fierce glare and said crossly, “You still have the cheek to say? What number one alchemy genius? You’re also not scared of spraining your tongue! Talented people remain in concealment in this Heavenspan World, so who dares to claim to be number one?”

Ye Yuan was very confident, but he was never arrogant.

This Heavenspan World was too big; geniuses were also akin to schools of carps crossing the river.

This title of number one was too big!

Even reaching Medicine Ancestor that kind of realm, didn’t he also encounter an opponent like the High Priest?

If he was not apprehensive of the High Priest, why would he say ‘Ask Not’ two words?

Ning Siyu stayed for a long time with Ye Yuan and knew his temper. She giggled and said, “I don’t care. Either way, you are the number one alchemy genius in my heart! Moreover, among the young generation, who can reach your boundary? Even in the entire Heavenspan World, it also can’t be found, right?”

Ye Yuan was rendered speechless and waved his hand, feeling lazy to talk anymore.

Bringing Ning Siyu and strolling one round in the outer-city and having purchased some rare spirit medicines, the two planned on heading for the inner-city.

The passageway leading to the inner-city, there was currently a group of soldiers guarding it. Each person had to go through stringent screening.

The two were just about to go over but saw a group of people currently coming over from another direction.

One of them was extremely eye-catching. Who was it if not the bald Zheng Qian?

When Ning Siyu saw Zheng Qian, she could not refrain from laughing out loud with a snigger again.

His Excellency was also such a troll. He burned Zheng Qian’s hair and even did not let him grow it out.

A fine handsome youth became a little bald donkey. How to let him go and find a girl in the future?

Zheng Qian also just happened to look over. Noticing Ye Yuan, he immediately yelled out.

“Big Brother Buqun, it’s this fellow who claims to be the number one alchemy genius! You have to take revenge for me!”

Beside Zheng Qian, a slightly older youth was sizing Ye Yuan up with an unfriendly expression.

He slowly walked toward Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “A brat whose hair isn’t even fully grown also dares to claim to be the number one alchemy genius? It was you who burned Young Brother Qian’s hair?”

“Haha, this punk probably came from some countryside and has never seen much of the world. Think that having a bit of ability, he can be number one under the heavens. In this Cloudpill Summit, even Brother Zheng doesn’t dare claim to be the number one genius. This little brat actually dares proclaim to be the number one genius.”

Another young man stepped forward and looked at Ye Yuan with a contemptuous look.

Zheng Qian also stepped forward and looked at Ye Yuan as he said with a cold smile, “Big Brother Buqun, this brat is ridiculously arrogant and even said want to compete with him, invite our Zheng Family’s ancestor out.”

When the others heard, they all revealed amused smiles.

This brat did not even know how to come up with a draft before boasting!

The young man beside Zheng Buqun said with a disdainful look, “Haha, kid, do you know what kind of person the Zheng Family’s ancestor is? That’s a Seven-star Alchemy God, Dao Realm expert. Just the likes of you, this snotty brat, dares to challenge the Zheng Family’s ancestor?”

These few people each threw a sentence in, deriding Ye Yuan non-stop. Ning Siyu was indignant.

She said with a scornful look, “So what if Seven-star Alchemy God? Even Empyrean Flutterfeather addresses my lord as his brother too! Could it be that your family’s ancestor is stronger than Empyrean Flutterfeather?”

The moment everyone heard, not only were they not intimidated, but the look of ridicule on their faces also grew thicker. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

That young man said with a big laugh, “Empyrean Flutterfeather? Huhu, little girl, Empyrean Flutterfeather is one of the Cloudpill Summit’s grandmasters. How exalted is his position? This kid addresses him as his brother? Stop joking around with me, alright?”

Zheng Buqun shook his head and laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and said, “Turns out that it’s two braggarts who don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. I was wondering which genius. This kind of ignorant fool, there will always be some in each Cloudpill Summit.”

“Hahaha!”

The two people’s discussion aroused a series of mocking voices from all around.

What kind of identity did Empyrean Flutterfeather have? That was an important character that was on par with Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s Empyrean Pilljade.

Beneath Heavenly Emperor, they were practically the pinnacle-most existences.

This kind of powerhouse would address a True God Realm junior as a brother?

You have got to be kidding!

Ye Yuan raised his brows slightly and said coolly, “Done talking? If you’re done, get lost for me.”

Zheng Buqun’s brows raised up and he said, “You want to enter the inner-city? Kid, do you have the Cloudpill invitation?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Cloudpill invitation? What’s that?”

The young man who was surnamed Duan could not help laughing as he said, “You don’t even know what’s the Cloudpill invitation and you dare to come and take part in the Cloudpill Summit? I’m telling you, only alchemists holding the Cloudpill invitation have the qualifications to enter the inner-city. As for you, go back where you came from.”

The bald Zheng Qian laughed loudly and said, “I was wondering what expert and where you were from. Messing around for half a day, you don’t even have the Cloudpill invitation!”

At this very moment, Zheng Qian was even more certain that Ye Yuan was some martial arts ancient family’s descendant. Although his Martial Dao strength was very strong, he was completely clueless about Alchemy Dao.

As for fire control, martial artists adept in fire-attribute cultivation methods would likewise be very formidable in controlling fire.

He admitted that Ye Yuan was a martial arts genius. But this place was an alchemy summit. What did it have to do with martial artists?

Geniuses alchemists able to come to the Cloudpill Summit would not care about martial artists at all.

Because the statuses of these alchemists were much higher than ordinary martial artists.

Zheng Buqun waved his hand and said, “Hurry up and get lost, kid. Stop making a spectacle of yourself here. Do you see their eyes? You’re currently just like a clown jumping around. This place is the world of alchemists, it’s ... fateless with you!”

The young man surnamed Duan turned his head and said to a soldier, “Commander Gan, looks like this kid’s skin is very thick, I’ll have to trouble you to send him off!”

That Commander Gan was amused from watching for a long time by the side. Hearing this, he slowly walked in front of Ye Yuan, reached his hand out, and said with a sullen face, “Leave, please! If you don’t go, then this commander will be personally taking action and sending you out of the city!”

This Commander Gan was a Fifth Firmament True God powerhouses. There was naturally power when he spoke.

Ye Yuan looked at Commander Gan, slowly took out a token, and said coolly, “I don’t have whatever Cloudpill invitation, but wonder if this thing can go in or not?”
