Chapter 2654: I’ll Accompany You!

“Huang Haoyan, take that conch out and let everyone see it,” Ye Yuan said.

He did not recognize it, but it did not mean that these Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses did not know it either.

After all, they had been dealing with the sea race for many years. It was also not strange to recognize the royal clan’s treasures.

Huang Haoyan complied with his words and took the conch out.

“Elder Cui, I wonder if you all recognize this object?” Ye Yuan asked.

When Cui Tong saw the conch, his expression changed wildly and he said, “This … Could this be the legendary Emerald Sea Divine Conch?”

“Emerald Sea Divine Conch?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Cui Tong’s expression became unprecedentedly solemn, and he said, “The Emerald Sea Divine Conch is the ultimate clan treasure of the Thistle South Sea Region Royal Clan. Its power is boundless! I heard that it’s a low-grade grandmist treasure!”

“Grandmist treasure?” Ye Yuan had a puzzled look. He had not heard of grandmist treasure before.

When the Pill Alliance’s Alliance Chief took out the grandmist treasure, he had already been sent into the void.

But Cui Tong had a solemn look as he said, “Above heavenly spirit treasure is grandmist treasure! Grandmist treasure. That’s the weapon of Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. Its power is unimaginable. There’s no mistake. The appearance of this sea conch is exactly the same as what this old man heard about! It’s just that this old man can’t feel its power, but I don’t know why.”

Huang Haoyan and Su Peiyun’s faces turned deathly pale. Only then did they know that they had gotten into big trouble.

No wonder back then the merfolk tribe would actually pursue so relentlessly.

Presumably, the merfolk tribe knew the importance of it. That was why they reported it to the Thistle South Royal Clan, resulting in the sea war this time.

The moment Su Yi heard, he said in a great rage, “Huang Haoyan, look what you’ve done!”

He did not expect that Huang Haoyan and his daughter actually got into such big trouble.

Now, he wished to smack Huang Haoyan to death with one slap.

Huang Haoyan’s complexion turned ashen. Kneeling on the ground with a thud, he cried bitterly as he said, “C-City Lord Your Excellency, I really didn’t know! If I had long known that the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was in the merfolk tribe, I wouldn’t have dared to take it even if I had ten times the courage!”

Su Yi gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “What’s the use of saying this now? If you have the capability, go and talk to the Thistle South Royal Clan!”

The other people’s faces were also unfriendly.

Clearly, they were very displeased with Huang Haoyan.

After all, the implications of this matter were too great!

The entire Land of Heavenly South would probably be swept into this war.

“Father, it has nothing to do with Big Brother Yan! It was Daughter who took this Emerald Sea Divine Conch out from the merfolk tribe’s Treasure Depository Pavilion!” Su Peiyun also knelt down and said.

“You!” Su Yi was angered until he almost vomited blood.

Just now, when he blew his top, it seemed like he was in a thundering rage, but actually, he had the intention of taking his daughter out.

Su Yi knew that going to the merfolk tribe was led by Huang Haoyan.

Since that was the case, let him bear the responsibility then.

He did not expect that his daughter actually jumped out herself!

Under the watchful gazes of the people, how could he still defend her?

Huang Haoyan’s gaze suddenly turned intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “City Lord Your Excellency and seniors, this matter was orchestrated by me alone. It has nothing to do with others! Peiyun only used the Water Concealment Pearl to sneak into the merfolk tribe after listening to me! This matter, Haoyan will bear it all myself! I’ll bring the Emerald Sea Divine Conch now and go explain it clearly to the Thistle South Royal Clan!”

The current Huang Haoyan, the cowardly look in his eyes had disappeared.

What replaced it was the responsibility that a man assumed!

The moment Su Yi heard, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.

He did not expect that Huang Haoyan would actually say something like this.

It seemed like this boy had genuine feelings for his daughter.

However, between Huang Haoyan and his daughter, he would obviously choose his daughter.

“Okay! The trouble that you caused, resolve it yourself!” Su Yi said in a solemn voice.

The others did not stop him and just observed with cool detachment.

Causing this kind of catastrophe, doing so was ought to be.

“Father!” Su Peiyun had tears in her eyes as she said shrilly.

Huang Haoyan received the Emerald Sea Divine Conch and said to Su Peiyun with a smile, “Peiyun, don’t mess around! This matter was caused by me in the first place. It should naturally be shouldered by me! City Lord Su isn’t wrong, don’t hate him!”

“But …” Su Peiyun said in tears.

“There’s no but! If there’s a next life, we’ll still be together!” Huang Haoyan kissed Su Peiyun in front of everyone.

This scene should have been beautiful, but at this time, it seemed very bleak.

Everyone knew that when Huang Haoyan left, he would definitely die beyond a doubt. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Whether or not the sea race would still continue to launch the sea war after accepting the Emerald Sea Divine Conch was hard to say.

But Huang Haoyan would definitely die.

Finished saying, Huang Haoyan turned around and left.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up. He said, “Hold on!”

Huang Haoyan was taken aback and gave a bow toward Ye Yuan and asked, “What advice does Master Ye have?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’ll accompany you.”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s expressions changed abruptly.

Facing the sea race army, even a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse would not dare to go out too, let alone a puny little Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum?

Was Ye Yuan tired of living, accompanying Huang Haoyan to go and die?

“No! You mustn’t at this time!” Before Huang Haoyan spoke, Cui Tong immediately turned it down.

Jiang Li also urged, “How noble is Master Ye’s status? How can you risk your life?”

There was the secret of true grade heavenly pill on Ye Yuan!

This held extraordinary significance to the Land of Heavenly South.

But he was actually going to send himself to death!

The group of city lords spoke up one after another, stopping Ye Yuan from going out.

Just one sentence and the warmth in Huang Haoyan’s heart could not be described using words at all.

Although the trouble was caused by him.

But at this time, he hoped that someone could come forward and speak up for him.

He did not do it on purpose!

He just made an unintentional mistake!

But no!

The people present all treated him like he was a jinx, casting him aside like a pair of worn-out shoes.

If a Jade Sovereign Heaven came forward at this time and accompanied him, his hope of surviving would greatly increase!

But there was no one!

He did not expect that at this time, Ye Yuan would come forward!

“Master Ye, Haoyan appreciates your good intentions! But your status is noble and can’t accompany me to go and die! It’s better for Haoyan to go alone for this!” Huang Haoyan said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Who told you and I’m accompanying you to go die? This Ye hasn’t lived enough yet! Alright. This matter is settled like this. You all don’t need to persuade anymore.”

But Cui Tong said in a solemn voice, “Young Master Ye, this absolutely won’t do! You can’t go!”

He looked like if Ye Yuan insisted on it, he would definitely use force.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder Cui, you can’t make me stay! We can make a bet. If you make a move against me today, it will be impossible for a true grade heavenly pill to appear in the Land of Heavenly South anymore! If you don’t believe me, feel free to make a move.”

He naturally knew Cui Tong’s thoughts. The reason why these people were so polite to him, was naturally in hopes that he would pass down the method of true grade.

Therefore, this was what they cared about most, and not him.

In contrast, Huang Haoyan was much more sincere.

Cui Tong’s gaze turned intent, a look of struggle appeared in his eyes.

How could a puny little Greater Sublime Heaven possibly escape from the hands of a Jade Sovereign Heaven?

But Ye Yuan’s calm appearance made him somewhat lacking in confidence.

If he really pushed Ye Yuan into a corner but failed to control him, then the consequences would be severe.

Ye Yuan ignored Cui Tong and said to Su Yi, “City Lord Su, prepare some heavenly medicines for me according to the list in this jade slip. The more the merrier!”
