Chapter 2792: If This Exalt Says That I’ll Protect You, Then I’ll Protect You!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Xiao Qing, didn’t you say that the sea is full of dangers? Why does it seem to be just like that when we walked all the way?”

“Reputation isn’t as good as meeting in the flesh. Maybe the true spirits in the sea are all very friendly?”

“Mn,?what you said is right.?Sigh,?this exalt has been invincible in the Yuchi Continent far too long and is seriously a little bored. Otherwise, I really couldn’t quite bear to leave.”

“Master is amazingly talented, your aptitude reigning the present era! A tiny little Yuchi Continent can’t accommodate Master anymore! Being able to follow Master to take a look at the world outside is Xiao Qing’s paramount honor!”

“Huhu,?Xiao Qing has discerning eyes like burning torches. This exalt just likes this about you! Xiao Qing, do you think that Master, I, can also reign the contemporary era when I go outside?”

“That’s a certainty! Master will definitely find lucky chances very soon and break through to True Sovereign Heaven. Then you’ll ascend to the summit again and look down proudly on the present era!”

“Haha,?I think so too!?Uh?… It’s just that this sea is vast and a little boring!”

… …

A youth in an azure shirt rode a black ox and was currently strolling on the surface of the sea, enjoying it very pleasantly like he was on a vacation.

The youth in a green shirt had a look like only he was invincible, and the loneliness of an expert.

However, his aura was indeed very powerful. He was actually a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse.

The black bull under his seat was also initial-stage upper Saint Sovereign Heaven.

This kind of strength, even when placed in the sea, it was rather strong too.

Therefore, it was still considered peaceful traveling all this way.

The youth was called Yang Qing, the Yuchi Continent’s strongest powerhouse, similarly to the Zhuo Bufan back then.

However, he no longer had room for improvement on Yuchi Continent. That was why he would leave to search for the opportunity to break through to True Sovereign Heaven.

Suddenly, there was an undulation in the void far away. The lethargic Yang Qing suddenly became excited.

“There’s someone!?Heh,?traveled for a year already, finally met a living person!?Uh?

… Only lower Saint Sovereign Heaven and he actually dares to come to the sea. That’s pretty gutsy! Xiao Qing, go over!”

Yang Qing patted Xiao Qing. Xiao Qing understood, and his figure moved, going up to greet.

Very soon, a figure appeared in Yang Qing’s field of vision. It was a young man in a white shirt.

“Little Brother, the sea is vast. How about we become companions?” Yang Qing called out loudly.

Ye Yuan, who was currently flying away swiftly, his expression could not help becoming a little strange when he heard the call.

This guy wanted to become buddies and travel together with him?

Tired of living, right?

“No need! Each goes his own way!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Yang Qing was not angry either, keeping up with Ye Yuan’s footsteps and said with a smile, “Little Brother, I see that your strength isn’t strong. If you come with me, your safety will be guaranteed too.?Uh?… But your speed is pretty fast.”

Ye Yuan gave Yang Qing a glance rather surprisedly too. This guy could actually keep up with his speed.

However, he was also very surprised to run into a human here.

Looking at the other party, he also guessed a little. He probably set out to sea to look for lucky chances.

“If you’re not afraid of death, just follow me,” Ye Yuan said indifferently. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Afraid of death??Haha?… Little Brother, you must be joking! I, Saint Exalt Azuresky, am invincible under the heavens! Unless a True Sovereign Heaven acts, otherwise, this exalt will keep you safe!” Yang Qing said with a loud laugh.

The large black bull also said, “Young one, relax! Master’s strength sweeps across the present era. Even if five grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens come, they’re not his match either! Protecting a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven like you is too effortless.”

Ye Yuan could not resist rolling his eyes. This guy was overly confident, right?

Was this hypnotizing himself, that he was really invincible under the heavens?

If there wasn’t a group of troops in pursuit behind me, I could slap you to death right now. Do you believe it or not?

Ye Yuan did not pay attention to these two living treasures and flew without any care, urging his speed to the extreme.

“Huhu,?Little Brother, this sea is so vast. Why are you in such a hurry? Why not slow down and enjoy the scenery of nature a little? It’s conducive to the improvement of realm too,” Yang Qing said with a smile.

Ye Yuan was speechless.

“Little Brother, you’re very cold! Let this exalt tells you. It’s very hard to achieve Great Dao with this kind of mentality! There aren’t as many dangers as you think in the sea. Even if there are, you should also look at it with a smile.”

Ye Yuan was speechless.

“Little Brother …”

Yang Qing was also bored for too long. Finally having found someone to talk to, his entire person became a chatterbox.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to pay attention to him, but he was also somewhat surprised at the other party’s strength.

Even if it was grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven, there were not many capable of keeping up with his speed too.

Suddenly, his expression changed. Five powerful auras ahead came to intercept.

He detected it. Yang Qing naturally perceived it too.

“Eh??Are these sea race powerhouses? After traveling for so long, it’s still this exalt’s first time encountering sea race powerhouses. Let’s go and say hi,” Yang Qing said rather excitedly.

Ye Yuan was speechless again.

How exhausting!

How did this guy cultivate to his current realm?

In virtually a blink of an eye, the five auras already arrived with a howl.

These five people were shockingly all general-level powerhouses!

Yang Qing did not wait for the other party to speak either, directly going up to greet as he said with a smile,?“Huhu,?gentlemen are sea race powerhouses, right? This exalt is Yuchi Continent’s number one person, Saint Exalt Azuresky! Today, I’m fortunate to get acquainted with you …”

“You’re together with this punk?” A sea race powerhouse in the forefront directly interrupted Yang Qing’s words and asked coldly.

Yang Qing smiled and said, “Of course, we’re together!”

Ye Yuan could not let out a single word.

He was really speechless. This guy was really bold enough. Couldn’t he tell whether it was good or bad words?

“Kill!” The sea race powerhouse roared, five people directly going all out and suppressing Ye Yuan two people.

Yang Qing was taken aback. Before he could react to what was going on, the other party already acted.

However, he was well-deserving of being Yuchi Continent’s number one person. He suddenly slammed a punch out and actually reached first despite launching later, directly repelling the two people in front.

And Ye Yuan also released the Universe Sword Formation and clashed together with three people.

How could the large black bull dare to take part in such a grand battle? It ran away with a whoosh.

“My goodness, is there some misunderstanding, gentlemen?” Yang Qing fought as he said.

“No misunderstanding!” That general in the forefront yelled.

“But this exalt didn’t provoke you all!” Yang Qing said in puzzlement.

“You didn’t, but he did!”

“Hey, Little Brother, just how did you provoke them?” Yang Qing could not resist looking towards Ye Yuan and could not help getting a shock.

Ye Yuan fought one-on-three and actually suppressed the other party!

These three people were all transformation experts!

Just now, he actually looked down on this kid?

A lower Saint Sovereign Heaven actually suppressed three great transformation powerhouses!

This boy was actually even more monstrous than him!

“It’s nothing. I just killed a few people,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The moment Yang Qing heard this, he said,?“Oh,?it’s merely five transformation experts. There won’t be a problem if we join forces! This exalt says that I’ll protect you, then I’ll protect you!”

After saying this, Yang Qing released his aura and beat the two people until they steadily lost ground.

But in this short delay, several dozen powerful auras in the rear arrived with a howl.

All of them were grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven experts!

When Yang Qing saw the situation, his scalp could not help tingling, and he cried out strangely, “Kid, just how many freaking powerhouses did you provoke?”
