Chapter 2320: Fatal Burst!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This is impossible! How can he be so strong?”

“A Deva Fourth Blight is a sovereign-level powerhouse! Two great sovereigns joining hands are actually not the match of the divine race powerhouse?”

“No wonder they said that the divine race was once the Heavenspan World’s ruler. Looking at it now, it isn’t fake! This kind of strength is simply appalling!”

... ...

Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses were god-like existences in their hearts, dominating the entire Heavenspan World.

However, the appearance of the divine race progenitor completely subverted their understanding.

In just this short while, they already believed that the divine race was the race chosen by heaven.

Wing spat a mouthful of blood and said with a smile, “Old thing, this guy is really strong, let’s not hold back anymore and bring out our true ability.”

Medicine Ancestor nodded slightly. Suddenly, the bones all over his body made clicking sounds.

The originally emaciated like a stick and short Medicine Ancestor actually slowly turned into a handsome young man.

“Hahaha, you, this old thing, conserved strength and stored up energy, looks like you’re still not confident in passing Deva Fifth Blight.” Wing smiled brightly.

Medicine Ancestor gave him a glance and said coolly, “Deva Fifth Blight is a life and death tribulation. How many people are confident in being able to transcend it? Originally, after this battle, this ancestor planned on comprehending Dao afterward and planned to transcend the tribulation!”

This battle had greatly benefited Ye Yuan, but it was likewise greatly beneficial to Medicine Ancestor.

With Medicine Ancestor’s talent and strength, gaining enlightenment on Dao was not impossible.

“Old dog, your turn!” Medicine Ancestor looked at Wing and said.

Wing laughed loudly, his entire person suddenly became smaller.

Under the watchful gazes of the people, Sacred Ancestor High Priest actually turned into a large black dog!

The large black dog had shiny fur, two large ears drooping down. But the two eyes were brimming with radiating vigor, revealing a murderous light.

Only then did everyone know that it turns out that Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s original body was actually a large black dog.

But after transforming, Sacred Ancestor High Priest seemed to be even more aggressive.

Originguard’s gaze was scorching as he said, “Turns out that it’s the descendant of a Dragon Dog. No wonder you have such strength. The Dragon Dog Clan back then was an existence on par with the demon race’s Eight Great Sacred Lineages. Except, they rebelled against the divine race together with the human race, and they were crushed. I didn’t expect that there are still remnant spawns existing in this world.”

Large black dog Wing’s entire body trembled, and he said in alarm and anger, “I was wondering why the Dragon Dog Clan declined until like this, turns out that it was actually done by your divine race! Then today, just nice, I’ll settle this score!”

After he was done talking, people saw a black light fly through the sky and smash toward Originguard.

At the same time, Medicine Ancestor also made a move in time, fighting together with Originguard.

After these two people transformed, their strength indeed increased greatly.

It was just a pity that Originguard’s strength was too strong. The two people teaming up still could not do anything to him.

The three people fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open, and the void shattered!

Within a few rounds, Cloudheart Mountain this region of space already completely collapsed. Countless spatial turbulent flows swept inside.

The originally pristine and beautiful Cloudheart Realm with mountains and rivers already turned into an asura battlefield. Countless Cloudheart Realm powerhouses perished, their Dao dissipating.

But even so, Originguard still suppressed the two great Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses domineeringly.

His strength was clearly a magnitude stronger than the two. Under the two people’s transformation, he could still handle the job with skill and ease.

There was not just these three people’s peak battle; there were also many Deva Realm powerhouses among the progenitors present. Their great battle with the divine race similarly fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open.

But the divine race prepared extremely well for this fight. It could be said that experts were abundant, the numbers were even more than the humans.

This great battle was virtually one-sided. The human powerhouses fell one after another. The battle situation was extremely tragic.

Ye Yuan’s side similarly fought extremely hard.

His side could be said to be heavily focused. The experts besieging him were too many!

What kind of concepts were these two squads?

A small team of over 20 people was more than plenty to kill 50 same realm human powerhouses!

Yes, it was to kill, not defeat!

Killing and defeating were two completely different concepts.

But it was such two squads that were used to deal with Ye Yuan alone. It could be seen how much importance the divine race attached to him.

Ye Yuan’s sword formation danced seamlessly, it was just that the defensive circle got smaller and smaller.

The opponent was seriously too strong, his realm was also too low.

“Double up, this kid almost can’t hold on anymore!” Yuan Xiu said in great joy.

The abyss monsters all became even more berserk. Ye Yuan’s pressure suddenly increased.

“No way! This bunch of guys are too strong. If I keep holding back, I’m afraid that the consequences will be hard to predict!”

Ye Yuan’s heart sunk slightly, and Time Freeze suddenly erupted.

“Immobilize!”

At virtually the same time, the Limitless God Killing Bow was already in his hand.

The power of a Dao artifact made the faces of Yuan Xiu and the rest change suddenly.

Bow arched, sword notched!

20 over streaks of sword light disappeared in a flash, exploding on the bodies of Yuan Xiu and the rest.

Bang, bang, bang ...

The intense explosions instantly seriously wounded them.

However, Yuan Xiu and the rest were too strong. Even though the Limitless God Killing Bow was strong, it was not enough to kill them.

Ye Yuan did not stop, drawing the bow and notching his sword once more!

The second attack was released again!

Bang, bang, bang ...

Yuan Xiu and the rest did not have time to react and were hit again!

Shooting twice, the Limitless God Killing Bow practically depleted his divine essence empty.

A powerful strength naturally consumed a lot.

Ye Yuan’s current divine essence thickness was comparable to a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

But even so, these two shots almost drained him dry too.

However, it was not over yet!

These divine race members and abyss monsters could not be disposed of with a few strokes.

Ye Yuan pointed at the void repeatedly and actually directly refined a pill in the void!

He scoured many spirit medicines from the Hidden Lineage. Using it to refine rank eight medicinal pills now was just nice.

Ye Yuan did not bluff Medicine Ancestor. He really glimpsed the power of law in the battle this time!

Refining rank eight divine pills at this time were accomplished with even higher proficiency.

Between breaths, a medicinal pill formed!

At this critical moment, Yuan Xiu they all would not give Ye Yuan the chance to refine pills at all.

However, Ye Yuan directly gave up on the quality of the medicinal pills and simplified many refining techniques. They took shape in virtually a blink of an eye.

But even so, the rank eight medicinal pills that he refined also reached purple spirit divine-grade.

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan directly swallowed the medicinal pill and drew the bow and notched his sword one more time!

Intense explosions sounded out once more.

He refined again, shot again! Refined again, shot again!

But even so, his speed of recovery could not keep up with the speed at which the Limitless God Killing Bow siphoned his strength too.

After more than ten swords, Ye Yuan’s entire person became like a vampire, emaciated like a stick.

Of course, Yuan Xiu’s two squads were virtually completely annihilated!

The abyss monsters were completely eradicated. Yuan Xiu and Yuan Shi were seriously injured and on the verge of death.

This scene shocked countless powerhouses!

“Matching the sword of source with a Dao artifact, unleashing more than ten sword moves in a row, jumping realms to kill more than 20 abyss monsters, and seriously injuring divine race members! What ... What kind of combat power is this?!”

“Instantly refining rank eight divine pills! I really don’t know what kind of realm he reached to be able to reach this level!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Too strong! Too strong! It’s just a shame that Second Sage’s strength is too weak! If he had Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor strength, he might really be able to bring us out!”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s combat power did not just shock the humans, it even shocked the divine race powerhouses.

The Divine race fighting against the humans, the battle had always been fought shorthanded.

But Ye Yuan annihilated more than 20 abyss monsters alone and seriously injured divine race members.

This combat power was too terrifying!
