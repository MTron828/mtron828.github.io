Chapter 1775 Fierce Fighting With Fierce Beasts

Ye Yuan’s pupils shrunk!Among the hundreds of fierce beasts, there was one with an extremely ferocious imposing momentum. It actually already reached peak late-stage rank four!

This kind of strength was an existence rivaling a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord.

Currently, Ye Yuan was already at the Fifth Firmament Divine Vortex Realm. Even facing Eighth Firmament Divine Lord powerhouses, he did not fear in the least bit too.

At this time, a Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast had an outer-appearance similar to that of a reckless bull, but its aura was comparable to that of a Ninth Firmament Divine Lord.

With Ye Yuan’s movement technique, if he really wanted to escape, this Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast might not be able to catch up.

It was just that right now, Tigerheart was currently at a critical juncture of breaking through. Once he left, the other fierce beasts would definitely attack and chomp on him until not even dregs remained.

If it were others, their first thought at this time would be to run away.

But this was Ye Yuan!

Seemingly feeling the powerful pressure from the surrounding fierce beasts, Tigerheart’s aura became disorderly.

His breakthrough had reached the most critical juncture. Once something went wrong at this time, his realm would fall if it was minor. If severe, his foundation would be damaged and it would be hard to recover to the peak again.

“Right now, you don’t need to think about anything. Focus on breaking through, and leave the rest to me! The sooner you break through successfully, the sooner we can break free.”

Ye Yuan’s words were transmitted into Tigerheart’s ears. Very soon, his aura became much more stable.

Ye Yuan looked at ferocious fierce beasts and let out a sigh as he said, “Looks like I can only risk it and wait for Tigerheart to break through successfully!”

Suddenly, a figure appeared beside Ye Yuan. It was precisely Ning Tianping.

Following the increase of Ye Yuan’s strength, the times when Ning Tianping could help Ye Yuan were already not much.

These few years, he had always been cultivating in closed-seclusion inside the Purple Extreme Hall.

Under Mo Lifei’s devoted training and with the help of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, he already broke through the bottleneck presently. He successfully became a Seventh Firmament Divine Lord.

“Your Excellency, this ...”

The moment Ning Tianping came out and saw such a shocking scene, he could not resist changing expression agitatedly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You stand guard over this guy! Don’t let fierce beasts come close. Leave the rest to me!”

Ning Tianping’s face changed and he said, “But Your Excellency, that fierce beast is too strong!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’m not risking my life with it either, so afraid of what?”

“Yes, Your Excellency!” Ning Tianping gritted his teeth and said.

Facing such a perilous scene, but he could only support from the sidelines, how unwilling!

Ye Yuan brandished his long sword, figure shooting out like lightning, becoming erratic in the air.

The moment he attacked, it was the certain-kill Spirit Concealing Sword!

Puchi!

That black wolf previously was directly cleaved into two halves by Ye Yuan’s sword, dying until he could not be deader.

While his attack also successfully aroused the wildness of all of the fierce beasts.

“Roar, roar, roar!”

In the silent wilderness, hundreds of fierce beasts bellowed frenziedly, appearing extremely horrifying.

Ye Yuan attracted all of the fierce beasts all at once.

In the beast horde, Ye Yuan’s figure flickered indeterminately, shuttled back and forth in space.

The moment he made his move, a fierce beast was killed.

But right at this time, that peak late-stage rank four fierce beast attacked.

“Roar!”

It was only to see that Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast roared. The surroundings immediately turned into a sea of lightning.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. This lightning was too strong and actually had the effect of freezing space, making his spatial law unable to execute smoothly.

One had to know, Ye Yuan’s greatest reliance was spatial law.

If his movement technique was being restricted, he would really be dead.

This Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast was clearly not so simple.

“Roar!”

With another roar, that Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast took a step, figure turning into an afterimage, butting over toward Ye Yuan.

This fierce beast was incomparably fast, arriving in front of Ye Yuan in a blink of an eye.

Puchi!

Those sharp bull horns directly stabbed two large holes in a late-stage rank four demonic beast.

At the critical moment, Ye Yuan broke free from the restraints of the lightning and escaped into the void.

Far away, when Ning Tianping saw the scene just now, he turned pale with fright.

Only after seeing Ye Yuan dodge this horrifying blow did he let out a sigh in relief.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan directly spewed out a large mouthful of blood. Clearly, that blow earlier, he was still injured by the power of laws.

Ye Yuan did not dare to stay, fighting as he left, avoiding that area of lightning.

He believed that this kind of horrifying lightning power, it was impossible for that Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast to release it frequently too.

Ning Tianping’s complexion was white as a sheet, his heart almost jumping out.

He had not seen Ye Yuan take action for very long. So many years had passed, and Ye Yuan’s strength had become increasingly terrifying.

A Divine Lord Realm who still had the strength to counter-attack under the encirclement of so many fierce beasts, one likely could not find a second person, right?

Suddenly, his face changed, a handful of fierce beasts sprinted over toward his side.

Immediately, Ning Tianping raised his long sword and guardedTigerheart.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan restrained the vast majority of the fierce beasts’ attention. Those that headed over here were merely some of the weaker fierce beasts.

Presently, under Mo Lifei’s guidance, Ning Tianping’s strength also grew with each passing day.

Wandering among more than a dozen fierce beasts, he did not fear in the slightest too.

Even though he could not accomplish Ye Yuan’s casual killing, ordinary fierce beasts could not get close to him as well.

At Ye Yuan’s side, the fierce beasts could not be killed finish.

Those that he could casually kill off were all some of the weaker fierce beasts.

But those fierce beasts whose strength surpassed late-stage rank four. Hence, wanting to kill them was not so simple anymore.

But even so, there were also seven to eight dead bodies of late-stage rank four fierce beasts at this time collapsed on the ground.

As for weaker fierce beasts, even more collapsed on the ground.

Falling into a heavy encirclement, Ye Yuan also felt unprecedented pressure.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan discovered that there were two late-stage rank four fierce beasts that already rushed to Ning Tianping’s side.

He could not help being greatly alarmed. With Ning Tianping’s current strength, he absolutely could not block those two late-stage rank four fierce beasts’ assault.

Moreover, he was already quite occupied with things.

Whoosh!

Two terrifying sword lights arrived with a howl. Two fierce beasts fell to the ground at the sound of it.

But right at this time, that Sky Thunder Raging Ox Beast also shot an electric ball out of its mouth.

In order to kill those two fierce beasts, Ye Yuan opened the gates wide at this time. It was already too late to want to avoid.

But this scene, Ye Yuan had long expected it.

Blue patterns flashed on his body, golden light erupted.

Bang!

Ye Yuan forcefully suffered this blow, his entire body akin to being struck by lightning, fresh blood spraying wildly as he directly flew out several thousand feet away.

Right at this time, Tigerheart’s breakthrough finally completed!

Seeing the corpses of the fierce beasts all over the ground, Tigerheart’s heart was greatly shaken.

“This ... This was all done by Lord Ye Yuan? Just how terrifying is his strength?!”

Tigerheart had never thought that a human’s strength could actually be daunting to such an extent.

Facing the encirclement of a peak late-stage rank four fierce beast as well as a large number of fierce beasts, he was actually still able to counter-attack so sharply.

Lord Ye Yuan’s strength was really too horrifying.

One had to know, he was just a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord!

“You dumb tiger, what are you still stoning for? Quickly go save His Excellency!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ning Tianping’s eyes could not help turning bloodshot when he saw Ye Yuan getting injured.

Seeing that Tigerheart was actually in a daze there, he could not refrain from bellowing loudly.
