Chapter 2499: Was There Your Contribution?

Outside of the Heavenspan Mountain, the eighth passageway already opened.

The eighth Dao Ancestor, that was Dao Ancestor Life, was ultimately obtained by the divine race’s World Lineage’s progenitor, Cheng Kui.

So far, out of nine great Dao Ancestors, the divine race occupied five of them!

Humanity only had a scanty three people!

However, due to Lin Chaotian’s sudden emergence to the fore, although the human race was weak, the divine race did not take advantage of the situation to enter.

But on humanity’s side, it was very chaotic.

Under Wang Cheng’s feet, laid a group of powerhouses who collapsed on the ground, their appearances very miserable.

These people were all people who followed Ye Yuan.

Long Yi, Bai Chen, Ni Xuan, and the rest were all beaten until they were severely wounded and vomiting blood.

Some people had all the bones in their bodies broken, white bones visible at the wound areas, the whole course very miserable.

However, this group of people was surprisingly silent.

Even when seriously injured and dying, these people all did not make a sound.

Wang Cheng also felt very bored after he finished teaching these people a lesson.

He did not experience the pleasure of teaching people a lesson.

He tried to force these people to beg for mercy, but no one begged him for mercy.

Rather die than surrender!

“Pooh!?A bunch of madmen!”

Wang Cheng spat and said with a sneer, “You fools, still counting on Ye Yuan to be able to save you guys??Heh,?when he comes out, he’ll probably be unable to even fend for himself! The era of Saint Azure will become the past very soon!”

After he came out, he already had an understanding of Lin Chaotian’s strength.

Lin Chaotian actually fought to a draw with Tian Qing after corroborating his Dao. This made him have extremely strong confidence in Lin Chaotian.

“Pooh!?Shameless villain! If you have the ability, go and act wildly to the divine race! Only know how to show off your power to your own people! Such an impressive Dao Ancestor!” Ni Xuan spat.

He was someone with great integrity. Otherwise, he also would not have become humanity’s chief commander back then.

Now, seeing Wang Cheng’s shameless face, his lungs almost exploded from anger.

Crack!

Wang Cheng broke Ni Xuan’s arms like lightning, causing him to howl with pain.

Seeing Ni Xuan’s painful expression, Wang Cheng had a look of delight as he said,?“Heh,?stubborn mouth! When Ye Yuan that fellow comes out, let you all take a good look at his dead dog appearance! At that time, I’ll send you all off together!”

Suddenly, the last passageway suddenly lit up.

The ninth Dao Ancestor was born!

Everyone’s gazes focused on the ninth passageway.

The last Dao Ancestor Watersource, wonder who has this great destiny!”

Very soon, a figure slowly walked out.

“It’s him!”

“Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets! He … He finally became a Dao Ancestor!”

“Not good! With Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets becoming a Dao Ancestor means that Saint Azure didn’t become a Dao Ancestor! Lin Chaotian won’t let him off!”

… …

Profound Secrets becoming ancestor was in favor with the general public.

The powerhouses present all knew the contributions he made to the human race over the years.

However, after the pleasant surprise, there were deep concerns.

Lin Chaotian currently had aggressive arrogance that billowed to the sky. Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was Saint Azure’s people. Hence, Lin Chaotian definitely would not let him off.

Seeing Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets appear, a hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Lin Chaotian’s mouth.

This Ye Yuan was really a stubborn child!

He probably did not know how strong he had become after he became Dao Ancestor Firespirit, right?

Before this, Lin Chaotian was actually still a little worried.

If Ye Yuan fused with the water rule crystal and became Dao Ancestor Watersource, he would really pose a considerable threat to him.

It was just that when he thought back, with Ye Yuan’s character, since he said that, it was definitely not shooting at a nonexistent target.

Currently, it was indeed the case.

At this very moment, Lin Chaotian’s last bit of worry also dissipated with the wind.

What remained was settling the scores!

The moment Profound Secrets exited the passageway, his gaze could not help turning intent. A piercing cold killing intent surged straight to the sky.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest was seriously injured on the verge of death!

Long Yi had a large hole in his chest, seriously injured!

Bai Chen had an arm that went missing!

Ni Xuan’s arms were forcefully broken!

… …

Ye Yuan’s line of people was all extremely miserable at this time.

Not needing Lin Chaotian to instruct, Wang Cheng welcomed Profound Secrets, saying with a jeer, “Profound Secrets, you’re also a Dao Ancestor now! Go over and pay respects to Brother Chaotian, and then apologize. Swear to be loyal to him. Maybe if he’s happy, the events in the past will be considered over. If you refuse to come to your senses,?heh heh,?they will be your outcome!”

Profound Secrets glared at Wang Cheng and spat,?“Kapoot!?Wang Cheng, you also became a Dao Ancestor powerhouse now, to actually be willing to be a dog! You’re barking really happily!

Wang Cheng did not get angry and said smilingly, “He who understands the times is a wise man! Profound Secrets, you’re a clever man too! Brother Chaotian corroborating his Dao and becoming a Dao Ancestor a second time, his strength is already exceedingly formidable. Even Progenitor Tian Qing can’t do anything to him either! When Ye Yuan comes out, his death date will be approaching!”

When Profound Secrets heard that, his heart thumped.

Hearing Wang Cheng, this meant that Lin Chaotian and Tian Qing had already fought. Furthermore, neither side had the better of the other?

This was impressive!

One had to know, Tian Qing also corroborated his Dao and became an ancestor a second time!

Seeing that Profound Secrets’ expression changed, Wang Cheng was even more pleased with himself and said,?“Huhu,?are you scared? That Sacred Ancestor High Priest couldn’t even last three moves under Brother Chaotian’s hands! Similarly being a Dao Ancestor, the disparity is too great! Therefore, following Brother Chaotian is the only way out! You’re a clever man, you should know how to choose, right?”

“Choose your mum!”

Profound Secrets suddenly flew into a rage and could not resist bursting into a swear and said, “Shameless thing! Get lost to one side for Your Father!”

When Lin Chaotian heard that, he frowned slightly and said with a cold snort, “Looks like you also won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin!”

Finished talking, he was about to make a move to deal with Profound Secrets.

Rumble?…

Right at this time, the Heavenspan Mountain was in upheaval.

One figure after another was transported out of the Heavenspan Mountain.

Those nine passageways also turned into nothing after Profound Secrets came out.

“Heavenly Dao Samsara ended! With nine great Dao Ancestors returning to their positions, the new epoch has begun!” Tian Qing looked at this scene and said with an emotional sigh.

Suddenly, a familiar figure landed in everyone’s eyes.

When Lin Chaotian saw the arrival, the corners of his mouth could not help curling slightly, revealing a hint of playfulness.

This person was precisely Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan returned, swept a glance over, and discovered the tragic states of Sacred Ancestor High Priest and the rest.

A surge of fury welled up from his heart.

“Ye Yuan, this ancestor has waited very long for you! Huhu, if not for letting them witness your death, this ancestor would have long sent them on their way!” Lin Chaotian stood with both hands behind his back as he said with a confident smile. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“You deserve death!” Ye Yuan glared angrily as he said in a cold voice.

“Hahaha?… in this world, there’s nobody who deserves death or doesn’t deserve death! The weak is the original sin! You’re too weak! So, the one who deserves death is you!” Lin Chaotian said with a loud laugh.

“Heh heh,?Ye Yuan, Heavenly Dao Samsara ended, your era has also completely ended! From now on, it’s the dualistic era where Progenitor Tian Qing and Brother Chaotian exist side by side. You’re already behind the times! Originally, you had the opportunity to touch the sky. But unfortunately, you were too conceited and weren’t willing to refine the rule crystal. Now, you already have no chance!” Wang Cheng burst into laughter when he saw the situation.

At this time, it was clearly the best timing to pick sides.

Hearing this, Ye Yuan turned to look at Wang Cheng, pointed at Ni Xuan and the others, and said in a cold voice, “Was there your contribution in this?”
