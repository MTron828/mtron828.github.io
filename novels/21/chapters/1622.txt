Chapter 1626 Kill

one man and one beast, they fought intensely in the wilderness.

facing the deboning great rat’s world power, ye yuan did not fall into a disadvantage in the slightest.

his thick and profound sword energy actually faintly had signs of breaking through the space.

everyone’s shock could not be any greater, but ye yuan secretly sighed in his heart.

him coming out this time, treasure hunting was just on the way. his real objective was still searching for the turning point of breakthrough.

these deboning great rats’ appearance just nicely gave him the chance to hone himself.

having a life-and-death battle with these powerful fierce beasts might be able to trigger his inspiration, and comprehend the fourth level cultivation method.

but now, he threw a stone to find the path, but in the end, the stone fell into the sea.

unleashing the misty sword art with the chaos heavenspan canon was indeed able to make him a match for rank four powerhouses.

but he still could not find where the problem was.

the current ye yuan seemed to have lost his bearings in the vast ocean.

seemed strong, but actually, his future was bleak.

if he could not find the direction forward, then the strongest opponent that he could face in the future was also just first-layered heaven divine lord.

“misty sword art, space rift condensed edge!”

ye yuan gave a light cry, powerful fused laws were akin to an ice-breaking tip, instantly gouging through the world power of the rank four deboning great rat, pinning it firmly onto the ground.

this space rift condensed edge move was the amalgamated strongest attack of ye yuan’s sword dao and spatial laws, and also ye yuan’s current strongest trump card.

he fused spatial laws into his sword art. within the sword energy was adulterated with powerful spatial rift force. it could be said to be a full display of his ability.

coupled with the attack augmentation of the junyi sword, this divine lord mystic treasure, that was why ye yuan could penetrate the defenses of a rank four fierce beast. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

that rank four deboning great rat laid on the ground, convulsing non-stop. it was apparent that it could not survive.

when everyone saw this scene, their eyeballs almost popped out.

the sharp edge of that sword actually made them feel their hearts somewhat palpitate.

especially first-layered heaven divine lord martial artists, their gazes when looking at ye yuan currently actually became somewhat fearful.

an origin deity realm martial artist actually killed a rank four fierce beast. this was simply inconceivable.

one had to know, when they faced a rank four fierce beast, they also did not dare say that they could definitely win!

this was also to say that ye yuan similarly had the ability to kill them!

ye yuan put away his sword and stood there, that slightly skinny body became incomparably tall and big in everyone’s eyes.

“elder ye is so ... so strong!”

“origin deity slaying divine lord, it’s simply unheard of!”

“turns out that origin deity realms can actually be powerful to such an extent!”

“spatial laws is indeed a supreme law, to actually have such power! if i can comprehend a trace of superficial knowledge, it would be good!”

...

those deacons and protectors all marveled with amazement, being deeply astounded by ye yuan.

zheng qi’s gaze flickered and he slowly said, “for ye yuan to be able to kill a rank four fierce beast, what he relied on wasn’t just spatial laws! his cultivation method is incomparably profound. that’s why it could support that kind of martial technique! i feel that ye yuan’s truly formidable aspect is still the cultivation method that he cultivates!”

when everyone heard that, they could not help getting a shock.

what kind of cultivation method inheritance could let an origin deity realm defeat a rank four fierce beast?

this cultivation method was a little too perverse, right?

zheng qi’s eyes were like torches. seeing the hint of disappointment on ye yuan’s face, he could not help being secretly surprised in his heart.

combat strength so overwhelming, could it be that this kid was still not satisfied?

this kind of disappointment was not deliberately displayed.

ye yuan clearly wanted to hide this kind of dejection but was perceived by zheng qi.

what in the world was this boy pursuing?

gu han had long forgotten about the matter of saving his master to the ninth sphere of the heavens.

he was shocked by ye yuan’s might until he was a mass of bruises.

ye yuan’s return could not avoid being clustered around by everyone. he just smiled, appearing somewhat forced.

bang! bang! bang!

suddenly, a series of explosions came from amidst the beast horde, blasting those deboning great rats all over the sky.

swoosh! swoosh! swoosh!

a series of figures suddenly charged out from the encirclement of the beasts.

the person in the lead was precisely gao yuan!

currently, he was bathed in blood, clearly having suffered considerable injuries.

these deboning great rats were nothing to ye yuan, but they were very fatal to others.

furthermore, these variant deboning great rats even had a strange forcefield, catching people off-guard.

“master!”

when gu han saw ling zikun rushing out of the heavy encirclement, he could not help being overjoyed, and hurriedly sprinted over to support him.

when gao yuan saw ye yuan, his eyes immediately turned bloodshot from anger, his face contorted, wishing to devour him whole.

however, he just roared loudly, “quickly go! there’s a middle-stage rank four rat king chasing after behind!”

zheng qi’s expression could not help changing when he heard that and he said in a solemn voice, “everybody, quickly go!”

a large group of people took off madly, unleashing even their strength to suckle at the teat.

suddenly, they discovered that there was no more sound behind them, that was why they stopped.

a series of great battles, plus this while of mad sprinting, the group was already dead tired.

originally, the two races, their teams had mighty contingents of several hundred people. at this time, it was already less than half.

clearly, there were quite a number of people who fell in the deboning great rat swarm. even their bones probably could not be found anymore.

with this halting, the gazes of heavenstar, di en, gao yuan, and the rest, all landed on ye yuan.

they were naturally not some well-intentioned looks. those were looks that wanted to flay ye yuan alive and swallow him whole.

these people pulled out even their coffin money in order to escape. it could be said to be heavy losses.

looking at ye yuan again, not even a trace of dirt could be found from head to tie!

this strong contrast made them feel very unbalanced in their hearts.

“gao yuan, our fiend race agrees to form an alliance with you! our current target is this punk!” heavenstar said in a solemn voice.

when gao yuan heard that, a hint of a hideous smile flashed across the corners of his mouth and he said, “okay! ling zikun, how about you? this kid deliberately saved your disciple, but left you there! you wouldn’t want to defend him still, right?”

ling zikun revealed a conflicted look. glancing at gu han, he suddenly said, “forget it, ye yuan save my pupil, it’s equivalent to saving this old man! this time, this old man is standing on his side!”

ling zikun was somewhat regretting it now. if he also stood on ye yuan’s side firmly before, their river eternal imperial city also would not have suffered grievous losses.

since ye yuan brought gu han out, he would definitely also bring them out.

gu han was the disciple that he valued the most, he poured in a great deal of painstaking effort.

if not for ye yuan, if gu han fell into the deboning great rats’ encirclement, he would definitely die without a burial ground.

therefore, now, he wanted to stand on ye yuan’s side.

gao yuan’s expression was livid, not expecting that it was actually this outcome.

“humph! ling zikun, since that’s the case, then let’s each go our own way now! you’ll take the open road and i’ll walk my single log bridge! this battle likely can’t be avoided anymore!” gao yuan threatened.

ling zikun drew a deep breath and said, “fight then! gu han, you retreat to one side.”

zheng qi looked at gao yuan and said in a cold voice, “gao yuan, you despicable villain! to actually want to collude with a different race to slaughter your own compatriots! today, let’s settle old scores and new together!”

done talking, zheng qi held his sword out and stepped forward, charging over toward gao yuan.
