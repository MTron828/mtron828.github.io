Chapter 3095: I Dye The Blue Sky With My Blood!

“Zicang, Mingjiang, you guys take care!”

The current Feng Xiaotian was unusually calm.

His whole life was a lifetime of fighting and conquering. He had seen too many partings of life and death.

Being entrenched in the besieged South Qi Giant City in the past, God knew how many fellow officers around him had left him. He had long already become indifferent to it.

However, this did not mean that he was not furious!

Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang were his left and right arms. They were extremely close to him.

These two people also made tremendous contributions in blocking the enemy outside South Qi Giant City.

Jin Yu was already seriously wounded by these two people’s desperate attacks and virtually did not have the strength to fight anymore.

This was exchanged by Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang with their lives!

They only did it for that steadfastness in their hearts.

...

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was their home. Even if they risked their lives, they had to protect this hot soil too.

Feng Xiaotian was the same!

“Feng Xiaotian, it looks like you already have some awareness!” Bloodpromise looked at Feng Xiaotian and was immensely pleased with himself.

The people around Feng Xiaotian got fewer and fewer.

Apart from Zhou Zicang and Song Mingjiang, the other people’s combat power was clearly much worse.

This bone that was difficult to bite down on was finally chomped down by him!

This group of powerhouses that Feng Xiaotian led was clearly Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s core force.

If they died, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven would be tantamount to being finished!

Looking at this scene, a hint of decisiveness flitted across Feng Xiaotian’s face.

“Humph!?I, Feng Xiaotian, have fought with the blood race for thousands of years. I’ve long already left life and death out of my consideration! Why should we rejoice over life, and why should we be bitter about death? However, if you want me to die, you all will have to pay a great price too!”

Boom!

It was only to see Feng Xiaotian snort coldly, the aura on his body suddenly erupting!

Behind him, the Door of Eternal Life appeared.

Feng Xiaotian’s life force started burning crazily!

“I dye the blue sky with my blood! Wind! Thunder! Transformation!”

All of a sudden, Feng Xiaotian’s body spurted wildly with fresh blood, wind and thunder, two great origins, were wandering around him frenziedly.

Fresh blood rippled in heaven and earth, and it actually gave birth to another Feng Xiaotian!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

… . .

Suddenly, dozens of Feng Xiaotians appeared above the void!

These dozens of Feng Xiaotians, each one was a peak ordinary Hegemon!

Furthermore, the auras were exactly the same! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Bloodpromise’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, “E-Each one is real?”

The other blood race Hegemons also felt their scalps tingle one by one.

Reaching their level of realm, illusion attacks were simply useless skills.

Each person had a unique origin aura on their bodies. Hegemon Realms could easily differentiate which was the real self.

No matter how realistic the illusion was, it could not imitate the aura of the main body too.

But Feng Xiaotian’s illusions were different!

These illusions were all condensed and formed by him cooperating with origin aura with blood essence. They were created by him at the expense of him burning his life as the price.

This move could only be used once in a lifetime.

This was the last time!

Bloodpromise knew Feng Xiaotian too well, and he knew all of his moves. But he had never seen before this move.

Too outrageous!

Above the void, dozens of Feng Xiaotians had cold eyes and stark murderous intent.

As if hundreds of wild beasts were staring at the blood race’s powerhouses.

“Kill!”

Dozens of Feng Xiaotians shouted angrily in unison, their voices shaking the sky, charging towards the blood race’s Hegemons!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Above the sky of Extreme Medicine Sect’s main peak, it suddenly exploded!

Feng Xiaotians had unstoppable momentum, akin to one proud sun after another, blowing through the sky!

Those blood race Hegemons originally held the absolute advantage.

But this advantage was reversed in an instant!

Three Feng Xiaotians charged straight for Jin Yu, fury surging to the sky!

The three people’s fist winds fluttered, bombarding the severely injured Jin Yu without pulling his punches in the slightest.

He wanted to take revenge for his brothers!

Jin Yu was severely damaged by the two ordinary Hegemons. He had not caught his breath yet, and Feng Xiaotian had already come.

Seeing the situation, Jin Yu was in horror.

He was currently greatly weakened. How could he be the enraged Feng Xiaotian’s match?

“Save …”

Before yelling out ‘save me’ these two words, the three Feng Xiaotians had already arrived.

Fist images permeated, slamming down like a storm, directly engulfing Jin Yu.

At the same time, 20 Feng Xiaotian clones counter-checkmated Bloodpromise and five top Hegemons instead.

Feng Xiaotian corroborated his Dao with battle. Even if his clones only had the strength of ordinary Hegemons, his combat power was strong to the extreme too!

These 20 Feng Xiaotian clones directly suppressed the five great Peak Hegemons.

Woo, woo, woo?…

The sound of wind blew across the sky, emitting a series of whimpering sounds. It was as if lamenting the Hegemons who died.

In the encirclement of three great Supreme Hegemons, Zhuo Bufan’s sword energy crisscrossed, standing rock-solid.

But at this time, he let out a sigh and said sorrowfully, “Have a safe trip, brother!”

Cloudmount was also in the heat of battle with two great Supreme Hegemons. Feeling Feng Xiaotian’s aura, he had hot tears in his eyes as he said, “Fine lad, got guts! Rest assured, us old fellows will definitely kill off the blood dogs and avenge you!”

Mi Tian’s gaze turned dark, feeling his heart aching, the strength in his hands growing a little heavier.

After coming to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, this place left an extremely deep impression on him.

Having fought against the blood race for thousands of years, the Heaven One Alliance’s unyielding and hot-bloodedness was what he had never seen before despite wandering through all the heavens.

Unknowingly, he was infected too.

The geniuses here might not be that monstrous, but they all had a stubborn and tenacious spirit!

Feng Xiaotian was even above average among them.

Regarding Feng Xiaotian, Mi Tian thought very highly of him and personally gave him guidance many times too.

Today, Feng Xiaotian’s blood spilled in the sky, using his hot blood to fight until the last moment!

Opposite Mi Tian, Yi Xue’s face also revealed a hint of respect.

“Although we’re enemies, you all have earned our respect! Mi Tian, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is different from the others!” Yi Xue lamented.

That tone was as if chatting with an old friend.

Yi Xue dominated the blood race army and swept across all the heavens.

But not a single place was as tenacious as Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Even in an absolute inferior position, no one stepped back too.

Every single one was willing to lay down their lives and spill their hot blood for this hot soil!

Even until now, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army was already more than half lost, their combat power greatly reduced. But they did not show the slightest signs of collapse too.

Feng Xiaotian even pushed this solemn and stirring fighting spirit to the pinnacle!

Those powerhouses who were still fighting dauntlessly in bloody battles, at this moment, it was as if their blood was immolated.

Many people’s eyes had hot tears but became even more valiant and vigorous.

The four great true spirit clans’ powerhouses had already completely integrated into this collective at this time too.

As if Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had become their second home.

An astonishing imposing momentum condensed and formed!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

The rumbling sounds lingered incessantly, but the auras of the Feng Xiaotians became weaker and weaker.

Finally, the illusions dissipated one by one, and the fighting sound became weaker and weaker.

Above the sky of the main peak, it was in ruins.

The dozens of blood race Hegemons originally were actually more than half dead and injured at this time.

The remaining ones similarly had disorderly auras, their strength greatly diminished.

Above the void, a figure stood proudly!

Feng Xiaotian stood proudly in the air, glaring ahead, his entire body covered in blood!

That fighting spirit that billowed to the sky still had not dissipated!

But the current Feng Xiaotian no longer had any aura on his body.

His life force was already burned out.

An era’s god of war had fallen!
