Chapter 2773: Nine Laws Dao Tribulation!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Run?!

These Saint Sovereign Heavens had baffled faces.

Transcend Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation?

This guy wouldn’t have been beaten silly by Ye Yuan, right?

What Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation would a Jade Sovereign Heaven be transcending?

“Guo Huai, you go and take a rest. Your head is beaten until it’s spoiled!”

“Ye Yuan, he said that you’re going to transcend Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation. Why don’t you transcend it and broaden our horizons?”

“Hahaha?…”

The Saint Sovereign Heavens laughed loudly without ceasing.

They could tell that Guo Huai had already completely become a cripple and could not be saved anymore.

If it were not for this, they also would not have failed to discover Guo Huai until now.

There was naturally no one who dared to make fun of a powerhouse.

But now … no one would care about him.

When Guo Huai heard everyone’s derision, he struggled endlessly on the ground in a panic and roared wildly, “He’s really going to transcend tribulation! When he fought with me, he was going to break through already! The reason why he wanted to suppress his realm is to lure you guys out and use the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation to perish together with you all! Fools! Why haven’t you hurry up and run!”

Hearing Guo Huai’s roar at the top of his voice, some people started frowning.

Those present were not fools. Although what Guo Huai said was inconceivable, it still aroused some people’s vigilance.

Previously, they all felt that Ye Yuan was too impulsive, coming to seek revenge after acquiring a precious treasure.

But thinking carefully now, something did not seem to be quite right.

However, Ye Yuan did not let them hesitate for too long.

“Huhu,?since you guys want to broaden your horizons, then … I’ll satisfy you all!”

At this moment, he completely released his realm suppression. A horrifying aura shot straight to the sky!

Auspicious omens orbited above the void!

But at the same time, tribulation clouds that made people’s hearts palpitate soon condensed.

Crisis!

Huge crisis!

The Dao tribulation aura coming from above the sky made their expressions change abruptly.

The Saint Sovereign Heavens present, apart from a minority, had virtually all transcended Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulations before.

But no one among them had ever brought down such a terrifying Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation!

Lightning was hidden above the clouds. They already felt asphyxiated!

“This … This is really the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation! How is this possible!”

“He has incurred Heaven’s envy! This Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation will definitely be earth-shattering!”

“What a terrifying aura, I feel like … I almost can’t breathe anymore!”

“Just how many law tribulations did this guy call down …”

… …

In reality, Ye Yuan was also greatly surprised by the power of this Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation.

The terrifying aura coming from above the ninth heaven also shocked him quite a bit.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

An illusion true dragon was traversing back and forth above the ninth heaven.

The blood in Ye Yuan’s body all started boiling at this moment.

In virtually an instant, his fleshy body directly crossed this major hurdle and reached the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven.

While his divine essence also skyrocketed at this moment!

Ye Yuan’s inner world seemed to have fused into one with heaven and earth at this moment!

One Great Dao rule after another was displayed in front of Ye Yuan.

Breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was a sublimation and also a great lucky chance!

At the time of the breakthrough, it was an opportunity to come into contact with Heavenly Dao at close range.

This feeling was indescribably mysterious.

Ye Yuan felt that his soul had completely sublimated!

What it brought was a surge in strength!

“Damn it! How can this boy be so monstrous! Bringing down Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation when breaking through? It’s unheard of since ancient times! Quickly run! What are you still in a daze for?” Zhao Ding bellowed, his figure suddenly disappearing from where he was!

Only then did the others recover from the shock, feeling a chill run down their spines.

Without the slightest hesitation, everyone fled swiftly at the same time!

“Only know how to run now? Too late!”

It was only to see Ye Yuan take a step out, catching up to Huangfu Cloudthink virtually in an instant!

Huangfu Cloudthink’s head went buzzing, and he was completely dazed! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Freaking hell, don’t chase me!

He wished to give himself two tight slaps now.

Why did he provoke Ye Yuan earlier? Why did he have to attract attention among so many Saint Sovereign Heavens?

If he had kept a lower profile, maybe Ye Yuan would not have chosen him!

But it was too late to say anything now!

It was because the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation had already descended!

Crack!

A bolt of lightning cut across the sky as if splitting the sky into two!

Ye Yuan felt his scalp tingle too. Without the slightest hesitation, he took out the Myriad Realms Mountain.

Boom!

Lightning fell, an indiscriminate attack!

The attack range of this lightning tribulation was extremely broad. Those Saint Sovereign Heavens had not escaped very far and were directly squeezed out of the void by the oppression of Great Dao.

“Puu, puu, puu …”

Even if they were not in the center of the storm, the group of Saint Sovereign Heavens also felt their mind trembling heavily, fresh blood spurting wildly from their mouths.

The Huangfu Cloudthink, who was nearest to Ye Yuan, was miserable.

He did not enter Saint Sovereign Heaven for a long time to begin with. His strength was not considered very strong in Saint Sovereign Heaven.

This strike directly knocked him down from midair.

Only to see fresh blood rushing out of his mouth wildly like a waterfall.

While on this side, the faint earth-yellow halo emitted from the Myriad Realms Mountain wrapped Ye Yuan up.

Boom!

Lightning fell. Ye Yuan was directly slammed underground like a cannonball.

Ye Yuan felt his eyes spin, his entire person feeling like his skeletal frame had fallen apart.

The power of this Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation was a little too strong.

However, he had the protection of the Myriad Realms Mountain and was much better than Huangfu Cloudthink.

Huangfu Cloudthink did not die, but his entire person was curled up on the ground, twitching incessantly.

With one strike, he only had half his life remaining.

Zhao Ding took a look at the void in astonishment and then looked at Ye Yuan, muttering under his breath, “N-Nine laws Dao tribulation!”

“Nine laws Dao tribulation! It’s the legendary nine laws Dao tribulation! F*cking hell, too terrifying!”

“This boy actually brought down nine laws Dao tribulation!”

“Quickly run! If you’re caught up to by this brat, you’ll be dead for sure!”

… …

In Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, Mi Tian was cursing Ye Yuan heavily too, saying, “You scoundrelly brat, you’re messing around too much! Who transcends a nine laws Dao tribulation like you? Do you not want your freaking life anymore?”

Mi Tian suddenly felt that this boy might just torment him to death one day.

His dream of returning home likely could not come true anymore!

“That … What’s nine law Dao tribulation?” Ye Yuan said blankly.

He really had no concept of Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation.

Mi Tian snorted coldly and said, “That lightning tribulation just now, how many kinds of rule undulations did you feel?”

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said, “It seems to be … nine!”

The reason why the lightning tribulation earlier was terrifying was that it fused nine kinds of power of rules!

Ye Yuan wielded the Myriad Realms Mountain. Logically speaking, transcending the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation was like playing.

But now, he was seriously wounded with one strike.

Clearly, this Dao tribulation was extraordinary!

“The first time ordinary Saint Sovereign Heavens transcend their tribulation, what they bring down is all one law Dao tribulations! Some stronger ones will bring down two laws Dao tribulations. Even in a major sect like the Labyrinth Divine Palace, the top Saint Sovereign Heaven disciples can at most only bring down seven laws or eight laws Dao tribulations too. You actually … f*cking brought down nine laws! Nine is the extreme of numbers, each Saint Sovereign Dao tribulation, the power of rules that descends won’t exceed this number. But, those who reach this number are all monsters among monsters, prodigies that even Heavenly Dao is jealous of! You scoundrel, you really incurred Heaven’s envy!”

Mi Tian gnashed his teeth hatefully and could not refrain from swearing.

He knew that this boy was monstrous but did not think that he was monstrous until such a degree!
