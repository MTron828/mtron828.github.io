Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Splendor Cloud Mountain’s Heavenly Strength King is here!”

“Feng Ji Mountain’s Jade Fox Fairy is here!”

… …

One powerful true spirit after another appeared on Bull Demon Mountain.

After the six great Saint Sovereign Heavens emerged, Saint Exalt Bull Demon summoned all the powerhouses above Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum on Myriad Demons Mountain to gather at Bull Demon Mountain and hold a Myriad Spirits Summit!

This Myriad Spirits Summit was an unprecedented grand occasion!

However, different from the past was that the Myriad Spirits Summit this time was not jointly convened by Saint Exalt Bull Demon, Saint Exalt Giant Ape, as well as Saint Exalt Great Roc, three great Saint Sovereign.

Instead, it was announced by Bull Demon Mountain!

This was somewhat intriguing.

After the six great Saint Sovereign Heavens broke through, some true spirits also came to their senses.

The six great true spirits that broke through to Saint Exalt this time were actually all the half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens within Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s territory!

Although Lord Saint Exalts did not care about worldly affairs; their status aloof. Actually, there were divisions of territory among themselves too.

Even a fool would also know that the breakthrough this time was unusual!

Especially those peak Jade Sovereign Heaven and half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, they paid even more attention to this.

Because they also wanted to know just what was the secret to this breakthrough?

Who did not want to step into Saint Sovereign Heaven?

At this time, those half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens seated on the left-hand side also started whispering to each other.

“You guys, even Wild Lion that fool can break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven. So why can’t this king?” Heavenly Strength King said gloomily.

By the side, Snow Wolf King said in a low voice,?“Hush!?Heavenly Strength, you don’t want your life anymore? Wild Lion is a Lord Saint Exalt now. With his temper, if he heard it, you’ll have to die ten times over! It’s fine if you’re courting death yourself, but don’t drag us to it!”

Heavenly Strength was filled with fear, only then coming to his senses. He hurriedly said, “Apologies, apologies, this king still couldn’t quite get used to it in a short while! This king’s talent and strength are clearly not inferior to the six of them. Yet I keep failing to break through. I really can’t reconcile with this!”

Surprise was surprise, but Heavenly Strength King’s words uttered what all of the half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens were thinking.

The fellows who used to be similar in strength to them broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven suddenly. This sort of thing was indeed somewhat hard to accept.

If it was one, that was still fine.

After all, this sort of thing required a massive lucky chance in the first place.

But six broke through all at once. They became somewhat unable to accept it.

This kind of gap made them go crazy!

But the more it was so, the more they scratched their heads, wanting to find the secret of the six people breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Since the six could break through, then it should also naturally be a cinch for them!

“Bright Tiger Mountain, Saint Exalt Bright Tiger is here!”

Following this roar, everyone’s hearts immediately leaped up.

Everyone looked towards the entrance and saw Saint Exalt Bright Tiger walking over valiantly and spiritedly.

Feeling everyone’s eyes focusing on him, Bright Tiger was indescribably full of high spirits!

The feeling of breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was amazing!

Walking past his peers of former days, he felt everyone’s complicated gazes and felt even more pleased.

He no longer needed to seek Saint Sovereign Heaven out bitterly anymore!

But his gaze swept across the seats of honor and there was only Big Yellow Bull alone.

Bright Tiger went over and cupped his fists slightly as he said, “Brother Big Yellow!”

Big Yellow nodded slightly and said, “You came? Sit!”

But Bright Tiger did not sit, he smiled and said, “I wonder where Master Ye is? Bright Tiger wants to go and pay respects to him first!”

Hearing this, everyone felt baffled.

“Who is Master Ye?”

“The first thing Saint Exalt Bright Tiger did when he came over isn’t to pay respects to Saint Exalt Bull Demon, but it was to actually to pay respects to this Master Ye?”

“Never heard before that the Myriad Demons Mountain had such a person! Could it be that this Master Ye is actually even stronger than Saint Exalt Bull Demon?”

… …

Although Bright Tiger had stepped into Saint Sovereign Heaven, in terms of strength, he was naturally significantly worse compared to Saint Exalt Bull Demon three people.

So in everyone’s view, the first thing Bright Tiger had to do should be to pay respects to Saint Exalt Bull Demon three people.

But who on earth was this Master Ye?

But Big Yellow laughed and said,?“Huhu,?forget about you, even this exalt hasn’t seen him in a long time too! But today’s true spirit summit, Master Ye should exit seclusion! At that time, it won’t be late for the few of you to pay respects.”

Bright Tiger said with reverence and awe, “So that’s how it is! Master Ye going in closed-seclusion, there must be a major move! Then Bright Tiger will quietly wait for him to leave seclusion!”

Finished saying, Bright Tiger came to his seat and sat upright.

But ‘Master Ye’ this name started to be discussed heatedly by everyone.

Very soon, Myriad Elephant King arrived too. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

After he greeted Big Yellow and Bright Tiger, the first thing he did was also to inquire about Ye Yuan’s whereabouts.

The five of them had just exited seclusion not long and had not paid respects to Ye Yuan yet.

So the first thing was naturally to thank Ye Yuan who bestowed upon them the lucky chance.

After getting Big Yellow’s answer, Myriad Elephant King sat down idly too.

But the name of ‘Master Ye’ started to get discussed even more heatedly among all the true spirits.

“Master Ye again! Just what kind of person is this Master Ye?”

“The first thing that two great saint exalts did when they came here, is actually to look for this Master Ye!”

“The other three Lord Saint Exalts wouldn’t also want to meet Master Ye when they come over, right?”

“There’s something odd! Could it be that this Master Ye is a transcendent erudite? The breakthroughs of the six great saint exalts were all his work?”

… …

The smart ones already guessed some clues.

This was not hard to guess!

And following the arrival of Saint Exalt Wild Lion and the rest, it confirmed their guesses even more.

As expected, the first thing they did after they came was similarly to pay respects to Master Ye!

Hence, ‘Master Ye’ became the most mysterious existence in everyone’s eyes.

There were even some people who already guessed Ye Yuan’s heavenly alchemist identity.

Of course, in their eyes, ‘Master Ye’ was definitely a powerful grade five heavenly alchemist existence!

Being able to create six great Saint Sovereign Heavens at the same time, this sort of astonishing means could only be accomplished by a legendary grade five heavenly alchemist!

These half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven and grand completion Jade Sovereign heaven existences all started to become restless.

They really wanted to know just what kind of god this legendary ‘Master Ye’ was!

“Saint Exalt Giant Ape is here!”

“Saint Exalt Great Roc is here!”

Hearing these two calls, everyone was shocked.

They did not expect that these two actually came too!

One had to know, the Myriad Spirits Summit this time was Saint Exalt Bull Demon acting on his own without consulting others!

This was equivalent to challenging these two!

Everyone guessed that these two people’s arrival was most likely to cause trouble!

If this Myriad Spirits Summit succeeded, who would still take them, these two great Saint Exalts, seriously in the future?”

This time, Big Yellow also got up to greet heartily, saying with a smile, “Saint Exalt Giant Ape, Saint Exalt Great Roc, the two of you arriving really honors the humble Bull Demon Mountain with your presence!”

Giant Ape leaned on the walking stick, smiling radiantly as he said, “What’s Younger Brother saying? At present, if this Bull Demon Mountain is considered humble, then wouldn’t the two of our residences become ragged?”

Saint Exalt Great Roc also smiled and said, “I haven’t congratulated Younger Brother Big Yellow yet, for becoming our peer!”

Big Yellow hurriedly smiled and said, “I dare not, dare not! Two brothers are Big Yellow’s dear elder brothers!”

This conversation made everyone stare in bewilderment.
