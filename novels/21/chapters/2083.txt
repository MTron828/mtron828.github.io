Chapter 2087: This is Your Martial Dao?

“Wang Ning, Zhou Qianhui, Su Xinyu! My God, those ... those are all the various Empyreans’ head disciples!”

“It’s over this time, Master Ji is dead for sure! These head disciples, the weakest is also an initial-stage Ninth Firmament True God! How to fight?”

“Apart from He Xiangyun who had already died and Master Song Cao, Jiu Luo Ji’s young generations’ top experts are all gathered here.”

... ...

There was a wave of exclamations all around. Clearly, this line-up gave them a fright.

These head disciples were all very powerful existences even among Ninth Firmament True Gods. There was no problem at all crushing those in the same rank.

Master Ji was still a little away from late-stage True God Realm, so how was he going to fight them?

Feng Tianyang had a proud look as he turned to Loneswan and said coolly, “Loneswan, the affairs of the younger generation will be left to us. You’d best not meddle in it. Otherwise ... don’t blame this Feng for not being courteous!”

Empyrean Loneswan’s two eyes narrowed slightly, and he said, “Relax, this Empyrean won’t take action.”

Wang Ning looked at Ye Yuan with a disdainful look and said coolly, “Brother Feng, dealing with a trash like this, Wang Ning alone is more than enough. Why is there a need to mobilize everyone?”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “A trash like this? If I didn’t see wrongly, you recently consumed the Yi Qing Pill that I refined. That’s how you broke through to peak Ninth Firmament True God, right?”

Wang Ning said coolly, “So what? Didn’t you hear Brother Feng? Martial Dao is the Great Dao! In front of our martial prowess, you’re as fragile as an ant.”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he grinned and said, “Very good! Looks like I’ve underestimated the northern people’s degree of shamelessness! Jiu Luo Ji’s Empyreans really made me have a completely new appraisal of them. The few of you, attack together then!”

Ye Yuan could tell that these few people had all consumed the medicinal pills that he refined, their cultivations all having an overnight transformation.

This kind of favor, Wang Ning actually summed it up in a few words and said it out simply. How shameless was it?

Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills were hard to exchange for using money.

Even if it was a tiny bit of improvement, it saved hundreds, even thousands of years for these people.

“Attack together? You haven’t gone delirious from fear, right?” Wang Ning and the rest could not help laughing as they said.

In their view, no matter how strong Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao was, it was merely becoming a wedding gown for others. How much strength could he have?

Ye Yuan did not even reach the late-stage True God Realm, but he actually boasted shamelessly about wanting to fight one-on-seven. He was truly ignorant until it was laughable in their eyes.

“Huhu, looks like this punk is normally kept aloof from the masses and already forgot what’s called awe and veneration. Since that’s the case, let’s teach him,” Su Xinyu said proudly with a faint smile.

Finished talking, the seven people had amused looks on their faces as they sped over towards Ye Yuan.

Regarding this kind of battle, they were all somewhat unconcerned.

Too lacking of a challenge.

It was just that they did not detect that an amused expression similarly showed on Empyrean Loneswan’s face.

Ye Yuan and Feng Tianyang, who was more formidable, he did not know. But for Ye Yuan to dare let these people attack together, then he definitely thought nothing of them.

These people were stronger than He Xiangyun, but they were also not much stronger.

Ye Yuan suppressed He Xiangyun with a slap, he reckoned that dealing with them would also be a cinch.

“Brothers, play with him well!”

Wang Ning said with a smile and already flashed behind Ye Yuan, his speed extremely fast.

A hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of his mouth and he raised his hand to deal a palm.

The others also all had amused expressions as if already seeing that panicky expression of Ye Yuan being toyed with.

Talking about it was slow, but actually, Wang Ning’s speed was just a matter of a blink of an eye.

However, just as this palm of his was about to land on Ye Yuan’s shoulder, Ye Yuan seemed to have grown eyes at his back, slightly leaning his body to one side, dodging it lightly.

“This is the Martial Dao that you spoke of? Claiming so solemnly about what Martial Dao, I was wondering how formidable you were. Truly disappointing,” Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh.

Wang Ning’s face instantly turned the color of pig liver.

This time, it was a huge loss of face.

“Haha, Wang Ning, didn’t you say that you wanted to play with him? Why were you toyed around?” Zhou Qianhui said with a big laugh.

“Wang Ning, can’t even take care of a middle-stage True God Realm! You’re really losing face for us, these head disciples!” Su Xinyu said with a loud laugh.

When the other head disciples saw the situation, they also ridiculed away. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Among the few great chiefs, there were naturally secret competitions too.

Seeing Wang Ning get deflated, they naturally could not dispense with a bout of sarcasm.

It was only to see Wang Ning’s expression turning cold, and he said in a solemn voice, “Just now was just a moment of carelessness, kid, don’t you get cocky!”

“Oh? Is that so?” Ye Yuan stood with both hands behind his back, having a meaningful expression on his face.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Wang Ning immediately became angry from embarrassment and said in a great rage, “Punk, you actually dare to underestimate me!”

Wang Ning’s aura immediately rose to the peak. A strange but crafty sword stabbed over towards Ye Yuan.

Whoosh!

The speed of Wang Ning’s sword was extremely fast, practically arriving in an instant.

It was just that Ye Yuan still leaned his body to one side slightly, and dodged it again lightly.

“Damn it, h-how did he do it? I don’t believe that I can’t even take care of a middle-stage True God Realm!”

Wang Ning gritted his teeth, brandished his sword, and attacked again.

It was just that no matter how hard he worked, he still could not touch the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves.

He talked about playing with Ye Yuan, but the end result was being toyed with by Ye Yuan.

In the beginning, everyone was all still mocking Wang Ning, feeling that this chief was too trash.

But along with the passage of time, everyone could not laugh anymore.

Once or twice could still say that it was lucky. But they were very clear about Wang Ning’s strength. No matter how lacking, it was also not to the point of being toyed in circles by a middle-stage True God Realm.

Zhou Qianhui and the rest exchanged glances, all seeing shock from each other’s eyes.

“Attack together! This boy is strange!” Zhou Qianhui said in a deep voice.

Six great chiefs immediately used their means and rushed forward together.

It was just that them joining the battle was still useless. No one could touch the corners of Ye Yuan’s sleeves at all.

The seven people had a threatening manner, but no matter how hard they worked, they still could not do anything to Ye Yuan.

The more they fought, the more alarmed they got. The more they fought, the more shocked they became.

Ye Yuan’s movement technique was too bizarre, just like a loach, being unable to catch it at all.

Far away, Feng Tianyang’s expression likewise became more and more serious.

Ye Yuan’s move was clearly extremely brilliant spatial law.

This kind of supreme law, comprehending even a little was tremendous luck. Ye Yuan clearly comprehended to an extremely high realm.

Those few fools did not detect it at all.

“This ... Just what’s going on here? A Sixth Firmament True God is toying with seven Ninth Firmament True Gods in the palm of his hand?”

“Could it be that ... Master Ji isn’t just an alchemy master, he’s similarly a martial arts expert?”

“Too strong! Just don’t know if Master Ji has the means to retaliate or not!”

... ...

A Sixth Firmament True God toying with seven Ninth Firmament True Gods, this scene was overly shocking, incurring a series of exclamations.

Everyone thought that Ye Yuan would definitely be made fun of. Who knew that the result was totally the opposite.

“Huhu, this is your Martial Dao? Truly laughable, to actually not even be on par with me, this minor Dao’s alchemist. You guys also dare claim to be chief disciples?”

High up in the sky, came Ye Yuan’s bantering laughter.

Suddenly, a fearsome power of vitality soared to the sky. Everyone’s faces changed.

“Forget it, you all let me down too much, let’s end this game!”

Ye Yuan’s lazy voice spread out nonchalantly.
