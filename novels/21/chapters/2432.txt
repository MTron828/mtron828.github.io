Chapter 2438: Nine Great Dao Ancestors!

Everyone was in extreme shock.

But Ye Yuan slowly retracted his bow, his aura being slightly in disorder. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The power of this sword was already his strongest strike!

Even with the thickness of his divine essence, he also felt slightly overwhelmed.

“Hahaha, Ye Yuan, you lost! A guy who overestimates his own abilities! How can this degree of attack possibly harm Third Grandpa!” Seeing that Lin Huan was safe and sound, Lin Lang said with a big laugh.

Although the scene just now was extremely shocking, Ye Yuan could not do anything to Lin Huan in the end.

There were already many people sighing endlessly in secret.

This strike earlier was already sufficiently shocking.

It was just a pity that it was lacking a little power.

If Ye Yuan’s opponent was not Lin Huan but replaced with other Deva Fifth Blights, the other party would probably have already been injured.

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Lang like looking at a fool and said calmly, “Is that so? You try having him say a word.”

Lin Lang smiled coldly and said, “Forget about a word, so what if ten sentences or a hundred sentences? How can the majesty of a Deva Fifth Blight be what you can provoke?”

Many people secretly shook their heads, somewhat pitying Ye Yuan.

“Sigh, he should have gone to provoke a Deva Fifth Blight, isn’t this seeking humiliation?”

“Lost then lost, why bother holding on strong?”

“Didn’t expect that Saint Azure is actually someone who keeps up appearances to cover up his predicament.”

... ...

The name of saint azure illuminated through the ages.

This reputation was indeed impressive. It also propped Ye Yuan very high.

In their view, Ye Yuan had clearly lost but was hellbent on saving face at his own cost.

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him and said to Lin Huan coolly, “Hey, try saying a word.”

Lin Huan did not answer.

But Lin Lang satirized to his face as he said, “Hey, is this Saint Azure? Clearly lost, but can’t bear a loss?”

Secretly, many people looked toward Lin Huan, feeling that he was a little weird.

He clearly won. So why was he refusing to speak?

Ye Yuan curled his mouth and said disdainfully, “Still repressing it? Keep suppressing and you’ll repress internal injuries out. Even if it’s Origin Enlighten Bodhidharma, there aren’t many quasi-Dao pills either, right?”

Lin Huan still did not answer.

“Humph! What bullshit Saint Azure, simply a guy who can’t bear a loss!” Lin Lang said in a great rage.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned dark, grabbing Lin Lang’s neck like lightning as he said in a chilly voice, “You’re very cocky huh! Do you really think that this saint doesn’t dare to kill you?”

A piercing cold killing intent was akin to materialized, making Lin Lang virtually unable to breathe.

He knew that Ye Yuan really had killing intent aroused.

When Lin Huan saw this scene, he finally could not resist moving.

But the moment he moved, the injuries on his body could no longer be concealed, spurting a mouthful of blood out.

Everyone stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, looking at Lin Huan in surprise.

Lin Huan was actually really injured!

“This ... How is this possible? A Deva First Blight hurts a Deva Fifth Blight!”

“Regarding the matter Lin Huan was being weird just now, it turns out that he was actually afraid of affecting his injuries even more!”

“Looks like Lin Huan’s injuries aren’t light. Otherwise, with his strength, he wouldn’t have been overwhelmed by it.”

... ...

Lin Huan getting injured immediately caused a mighty uproar.

A martial artist who just broke through to Deva Realm actually hurt a Deva Fifth Blight sovereign!

This kind of thing was too fantastical.

In Origin Enlighten Hall, the group of Dao Ancestors was shocked too.

“This guy is also too strong, right? He just broke through and his attack power is actually already capable of hurting a Deva Fifth Blight!” Ancestor Lightning exclaimed.

“Hiss ... if wait until he reaches Deva Fifth Blight, wouldn’t even we not be his match too?” Ancestor Fire sucked in a breath of cold air as he said.

Lin Chaotian was startled and also delighted, and said with a slight smile, “The stronger he is, the more it proves that this ancestor’s judgment wasn’t wrong! He must have a secret that can break the shackles on him! I made Lin Huan go in order to test his depths.”

With this, Ye Yuan’s strength was completely exposed in front of them.

Nothing was more convincing than this.

At this time, the eight great Dao Ancestors no longer had doubts, standing firmly on Dao Ancestor Life’s side.

Among them, included Ancestor Lightning.

No one could resist this kind of temptation.

Ye Yuan casually threw, throwing Lin Lang to one side. Slowly arriving in front of Lin Huan, he said nonchalantly, “Good dog, don’t get in the way.”

Lin Huan looked at Ye Yuan with a gloomy face, gnashing his teeth in hatred.

But in the end, he still got out of the way unwillingly.

Profound Secrets looked at this scene with a shocked expression on his face. He only came back to his senses after a long time, and hurriedly chased after.

He suddenly somewhat understood why Lin Chaotian was targeting Ye Yuan.

... ...

Inside Origin Enlighten Hall, it was long already packed full.

Ye Yuan stepped into the hall, the eyes of the group of powerhouses looked over towards him collectively.

Among them, there were many who were even his former subordinates.

Ye Yuan looked straight ahead, arriving in the center of the hall.

There were nine seats above the hall, they were clearly prepared for the nine great Dao Ancestors.

These nine people were supreme existences of the human race.

Dao Ancestor Life, Dao Ancestor Watersource, Dao Ancestor Firespirit, Dao Ancestor Storm, Dao Ancestor Lightning, Dao Ancestor Earth, Dao Ancestor Light, Dao Ancestor Darkness, and Dao Ancestor Destruction!

These nine great Dao Ancestors stood at the top of the Heavenspan World, overlooking the world!

Suddenly, the void trembled.

Nine figures were already seated on the seats at some point.

Although they were already seated, they gave people an indistinct feeling.

The rule undulations emanating from their bodies made them seem particularly fleeting and ephemeral.

As if what they represented was Heavenly Dao!

But Ye Yuan saw these nine people’s faces clearly.

As far as comprehension towards Dao was concerned, he was even more advanced than the few seated.

How could these few people pretend to be unfathomable in front of him?

Ye Yuan looked at that old man wearing a gray crown in the middle, seeming like they had met before.

Lin Chaotian also looked at him and said with a light smile, “Lord Saint Azure, parting for ten billion years, I didn’t expect that when you and I meet again, it actually is the situation of reversing the chaos of spacetime.”

At that time, they were still just out-and-out juniors in front of Ye Yuan.

Even Shang Hang that kind of major power was also unbelievably weak in front of Ye Yuan.

A slight commotion came from within the great hall.

With regards to the talk about Ye Yuan creating an eternally prosperous age previously, it was all just a legend.

But Dao Ancestor Life was the only remaining great achievement from the last epoch.

He personally acknowledged Ye Yuan’s title of Saint Azure, clearly indicating the truth of this matter.

This young man before their eyes was really a legend!

Ye Yuan looked at Lin Chaotian and said with a frown, “So, it’s you! That time, I already felt that the wood-attribute power of law in your body was extremely exuberant. I didn’t expect that later on, you actually became a Dao Ancestor!”

Lin Chaotian was precisely one of the members who went to Inquire Heavenly Palace back then together with Shang Hang to find trouble with Ye Yuan.

At that time, Ye Yuan’s attention was mostly on Shang Hang and did not have too deep of an impression of Lin Chaotian.

But Lin Chaotian was one of the geniuses that Ye Yuan did not have much contact with.

At that time, he was the Saint Azure far removed from the masses and reality. Lin Chaotian was merely a puny little genius disciple.

Circumstances change with the passing of time, that puny little disciple was already standing at the top of the Heavenspan World, becoming the number one Dao Ancestor.

But Ye Yuan was still just a junior who just entered Creation Realm.

Got to admit, the god of destiny makes a fool out of people.

Lin Chaotian smiled and said, “What Lin Chaotian has today, it is thanks to the credit of Saint Azure’s inheritance grand array. This Lin is endlessly grateful. It’s just that times have changed. With me inviting Saint Azure here today, please give the world an explanation as to why you let Daymeld go.”

The atmosphere in the great hall instantly dropped to freezing point.

While talking and laughing, swords and bows were already drawn!
