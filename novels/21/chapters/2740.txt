Chapter 2746: Peerless Heaven’s Chosen!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Younger Brother Ye, we really made a killing this time! These cultivation method secret books are enough to let us cultivate to True Sovereign Heaven!” Saint Exalt Waycloud grinned, almost laughing until his mouth was crooked.

The grudges with Ye Yuan previously, he had also long flung it beyond the ninth heaven.

He had entered many mystic realms in this lift before, but the harvest was also not as great as this time when added up!

Cultivation methods, martial techniques, grandmist treasure, heavenly pills, it was simply unbelievably amazing.

Reality proved that following Ye Yuan would have meat to eat, while opposing Ye Yuan would lead to the result of dying faster.

“Younger Brother Ye, you really don’t want these cultivation method secret books?” Saint Exalt Purplesun still did not dare to believe it as he said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I don’t lack these; you all keep them for yourselves.”

“Oh,?alright then. Thank you, Younger Brother Ye!” Saint Exalt Purplesun said with an excited look.

Mi Tian said that the cultivation method secret books here were supreme scriptures to ordinary folks.

But it did not hold a candle to the Wordless Heavenly Skill.

If it was where the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s true mountain pass gates were, those cultivation methods would be the real treasures.

However, even if Ye Yuan obtained them, he had no need to cultivate either.

The Wordless Heavenly Skill was also at the top level even if placed in the Labyrinth Divine Palace!

Furthermore, the cultivation method that Ye Yuan cultivated was of the same lineage. There would be no benefits to change to other cultivation methods.

As for martial techniques, Ye Yuan had always walked the path of pioneering.

Unless it was some powerful auxiliary secret art, otherwise, Ye Yuan rarely practiced them.

These books were divided up very quickly.

Of course, if not for Ye Yuan presiding over the overall situation, this bunch of guys would have long started killing.

“Younger Brother Ye, where are we going next? Continue advancing or going out?” Saint Exalt Waycloud asked.

They were already following Ye Yuan’s lead now.

At least in this Labyrinth Divine Palace, if Ye Yuan made them head east, they definitely would not dare to go west.

Leaving Ye Yuan was too dangerous!

Ye Yuan said, “I’m going to cultivate now. Are you all going together or going out first?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud was taken aback and said, “Cultivating? In here?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Walking past this corridor, there’s a venue for training disciples. Since we came, we naturally can’t waste it.”

Cultivating here was naturally Mi Tian giving pointers.

In the past few decades, Ye Yuan devoted himself to closed-seclusion cultivation, his realm and alchemy path strength advancing by leaps and bounds. But he fell behind in the aspect of rule comprehension.

At present, Ye Yuan’s three great rules still remained at the third level.

The eruption previously was also by relying on the sharpness of his weapon.

“Disciple? Younger Brother Ye, what’s there to cultivate at the disciples training venue?” Saint Exalt Waycloud said disdainfully.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Saint Sovereign Heavenly Stratum is the threshold for the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s disciples. No matter how talented the Jade Sovereign Heaven, they aren’t qualified enough either.”

The moment everyone heard, their eyeballs almost popped out.

“What? Younger Brother Ye, this joke … is too much!” Saint Exalt Waycloud said with a look of disbelief.

“Yeah, Saint Sovereign Heavens are rulers of a region no matter what. When they arrive at the Labyrinth Divine Palace, they are just gate-guarding disciples?” Saint Exalt Purplesun also said in disbelief.

These Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were aloof from worldly affairs in Rainclear Continent, their status being loftly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

They naturally knew that there was a mountain beyond mountain, and that there was always someone better. There was still True Sovereign Heaven above Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But even so, they also did not feel that they only had the fate of being a disciple.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Whether to believe it or not is up to you guys. Are you all going out now or going to cultivate together with me?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud snorted coldly and said, “This exalt wants to see just how this Labyrinth Divine Palace trains disciples!”

Saint Exalt Purplesun nodded and said, “This exalt wants to witness it too!”

The other saint exalts also nodded one after another, clearly all very unconvinced.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since that’s the case, come with me then.”

Over time, many powerful dangers naturally bred within the palace.

However, with Mi Tian’s guidance, Ye Yuan made use of the power of the restrictions and eradicated many dangers.

The group of Saint Sovereign Heavens followed Ye Yuan in shock and anxiety, their expressions changing again and again.

Passing through a gloomy and dark corridor, a row of massive training grounds appeared in front of everyone.

Ye Yuan brought everyone to a training ground. After fumbling, he discovered that there were several grooves not far away from the door.

Ye Yuan took out a bunch of heavenly crystals and fitted them into the grooves.

Very soon, this training ground lit up like a machine being activated.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he smiled and said, “Luckily, the training ground wasn’t wrecked.”

Light lit up in the training ground. However, no overly soul-stirring scene appeared.

Everything was as usual!

But at this time, a light screen suddenly appeared on the wall of the training ground.

Rows of names appeared on it.

“Labyrinth Divine Palace outer-sect, number one Saint Sovereign Heaven in history, Jun Tianxiao!”

“Labyrinth Divine Palace outer-sect, number two Saint Sovereign Heaven in history, Zuo Wentian!”

… …

“Labyrinth Divine Palace outer-sect, number one hundredth Saint Sovereign Heaven in history, Sun Qi!”

100 names were displayed on this light screen.

The names were not very soul-stirring, but the ‘in history’ two words appeared particularly eye-catching!

Others did not know, but Ye Yuan knew how powerful the Labyrinth Divine Palace was when it was glorious.

At its peak, it was known for having a million disciples!

And Mi Tian said that the Labyrinth Divine Palace had been passed down for dozens of generations, for as long as a million years!

This kind of behemoth, being able to rank in the top 100, what kind of heaven’s chosen were they!

Not talking about these dozens of generations, just the last generation of disciples.

Ranking in the top 100 among a million Saint Sovereign Heavens, that was a terrifying to the extreme character!

“Heh,?kid, these hundred people won’t bully people. You only have Jade Sovereign Heaven strength. They will face-off against you with their strength when they were at Jade Sovereign Heaven! If you can take down these hundred people, then your talent can absolutely rank in the top 100 of the 33 Heavens!” Mi Tian was somewhat gloating over others’ misfortune as he said.

The meaning of his words was very clear. It was that he did not feel that Ye Yuan could beat these hundred people.

In fact, he was not even a match for the hundredth place.

“Senior, you’re … not optimistic about me at all!” Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself.

Mi Tian smiled and said, “Kid, don’t think that I’m looking down on you! My words are actually already flattering you a lot! Not everyone has the qualifications to challenge these hundred people! Those guys don’t even have the qualifications to challenge at all!”

“You don’t know how many overwhelmingly talented people had once appeared in the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s generations of disciples before! Being able to rank in the top hundred, their combat power doesn’t just reign supreme in their era! In the long river of history, they can laugh proudly across all the heavens too!”

“Among these people, as long as they didn’t fall, they basically all became Hegemon Realm super powerhouses later on! They roamed all the heavens unhindered, no one dared to provoke! Otherwise, how could the Labyrinth Divine Palace have the capital to want to unify all the heavens?”

Ye Yuan knew that Mi Tian’s words were actually very objective.

But Ye Yuan’s desire to excel was already stimulated by Mi Tian.

Was he really inferior to these peerless heaven’s chosen?

He, Ye Yuan, defied heaven step by step walking all the way, casting so many heaven’s chosen into the shade.

Today, would he be bested by these former heaven’s chosen?
