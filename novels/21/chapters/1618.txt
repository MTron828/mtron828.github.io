Chapter 1622 Falling Into Heavy Encirclemen

Back then, when Ye Yuan went down this bottomless abyss, what he relied on was the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood.Presently, he no longer needed it.

With his comprehension of spatial laws, going down was not something hard.

But even so, their large group of people still went down for a day and night before coming into contact with the bottom.

“Not good! My ... My realm is being suppressed!”

“Mine is being suppressed too! I ... Currently I only have first-layered heaven Divine Lord strength!”

“Do you all notice it? The forcefield here is too strong! There’s no way to fly at all!”

...

Upon landing, everyone’s cry of horror transmitted over.

Clearly, this situation was completely different from what they imagined.

Divine Lord Realm powerhouses could not fly, their realms were suppressed. This kind of situation made them too uncomfortable.

Furthermore, the forcefield here was too strong, making them feel that even breathing was somewhat difficult. They were not used to it.

Gao Yuan’s expression was very ugly, because his realm was similarly being suppressed. Currently, it was only merely the likes of a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Such a suppression made him a little more worried about the expedition this time.

However, when his gaze turned to Ye Yuan, his expression became darker.

Ye Yuan’s realm was actually no different from before. It seemed like there was no suppression force at all.

This discovery made him extremely displeased.

Rather, everyone from Heavenly Eagle Imperial City had long been mentally prepared because of Ye Yuan’s reminder and did not kick a big fuss like the rest.

Ye Yuan’s Origin Magnetic Field quietly released, diminishing a large portion of the forcefield below.

That bit remaining did not affect him too much.

“Alright. Everybody, don’t panic. This realm suppression isn’t just targeted at us only. The fiend race powerhouses will likewise have their realms suppressed. It’s just that we don’t know what dangers this place has. So everybody best be more careful, and take care not to get separated,” Ling Zikun said.

These people had also experienced grand spectacles before. After experiencing the initial-most panic, they accepted the reality very soon and calmed down.

Apart from River Eternal Imperial City, there were people from a total of three great imperial cities who came to support them this time. They were respectively Utmost Peace Imperial City, Deersun Imperial City, and Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Among these three great forces, it was clearly Utmost Peace Imperial City’s strength that was the strongest, followed by Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

And Deersun Imperial City only sent an eighth-layered heaven Divine Lord elder over, he was considered the weakest one already.

While River Eternal Imperial City sent a total of 30 over people this time. Apart from Ling Zikun and this ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord expert, there were still two eighth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses.

This line-up was considered rather impressive already.

It was just that now, apart from Gao Yuan, this half-step Celestial Deity being suppressed to fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, the other ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouses were all suppressed to third-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Middle-stage Divine Lord Realms were all suppressed to second-layered heaven Divine Lord. Initial-stage Divine Lord Realms were all suppressed to first-layered heaven Divine Lord.

This result was clearly unexpected before they came down.

The group of people advanced in groups. Surrounded by jagged rocks of grotesque shapes, not even a blade of grass growing, light very dim, everyone lit divine fires before they could barely manage to make out the path.

“We haven’t discovered the fiend race’s traces even until now. Could it be that they couldn’t find a way down?” Ling Zikun suddenly said, his words faintly exuding excitement.

Gao Yuan’s eyes lit up when he heard that and said, “If it’s like this, then the chances of us getting the lucky chance will greatly increase!”

Deersun Imperial City eighth-layered heaven Divine Lord, Zuo Qing, said, “I don’t believe that the fiend race also has a powerhouse who understands spatial laws. Those who can come down are probably not many. We have so many people, eradicating them is easily accomplished!”

But Ye Yuan said, “You guys are thinking too much! A hundred years ago, the fiend race already created flying boats that can suspend above the natural chasm. With the strength with Divine Lord Realm powerhouses and going together with that flying boat, the fiend race powerhouses might have long come down before.”

Ye Yuan’s words were akin to a bucket of cold water splashing on their heads, instantly making them feel a chill.

“Haha ... it’s still this kid who’s smart!”

“What’s the use of being smart? Doesn’t he still have to die here?”

“These humans are really a bunch of fools, to actually still hope that we’re not coming, hahaha ...”

...

At this time, a series of unbridled voices suddenly sounded out all around, making everyone’s faces change drastically. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The ones who said this could only be the fiend race’s powerhouses.

Nobody would have thought that they were suddenly surrounded.

Most importantly, they looked in all directions and could not find traces of fiend race powerhouses at all.

Only hearing the voices, not seeing the people!

“Fiend dogs, scram out here for this father of yours! What kind of ability is it to sneak around furtively?”

“If you have the capabilities, have an open and aboveboard fight! A bunch of cowardly turtles!”

...

The human powerhouses’ roars seemed rather ferocious in appearance but feeble in essence.

They wanted to goad the fiend race powerhouses out, but how could the fiend race powerhouse do as they wanted?

Ye Yuan suddenly said, “Don’t shout anymore. We’ve already fallen into the grand array that the fiend race set up. They are not far from us right now, it’s just that you guys can’t see.”

The moment everyone heard, their faces could not help changing.

These fiend race powerhouses had clearly long laid in ambush, just waiting for them to walk right into the trap!

A voice dripping with sarcasm said sneeringly, “Heh, this kid has some ability, to actually be able to realize that they have already fallen into an array formation. But it’s no use! This Soul Devouring Devil Cloud Formation is a peak rank four divine formation. Even if ninth-layered heaven Divine Lords get caught inside, it’s certain death too. Moreover, you all have your realms suppressed currently!”

Gao Yuan’s expression became incomparably ugly. He did not expect that he had not seen the treasure yet and already got caught in a desperate situation.

Peak rank four divine formation, if he did not have his realm suppressed, wanting to escape was naturally no problem.

But now, he was only fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord. How to run away?

Could it be that he was really going to die first before achieving success in the expedition?

“You all savor the power of the Soul Devouring Devil Cloud Formation well! This xiantian mystic treasure will belong to our fiend race!”

Done talking, clouds of red fog actually appeared out of thin air, surrounding everyone inside.

The red fog filled the air, it was so dark that you could not see your hand in front of you at all. Everyone already lost traces of their companions.

“Kill, kill, kill! Kill you, this fiend dog!”

Suddenly, someone among the humans screamed, chopping over toward a companion beside him with a sword.

Puchi!

That person was caught off-guard, his head directly being chopped flying, and already died until he was deader than dead.

This Soul Devouring Devil Cloud Formation was able to take effect on the martial artist’s divine soul, making them produce illusions, and kill each other.

For a moment, the companions that they saw all became fiend race powerhouses,; incomparably sinister.

These people attacked brutally, betting life-for-life with each other, just like they became mortal enemies.

A hint of red light flashed across Ye Yuan’s eyes, seemingly seeing through this stretch of red fog.

Immediately after, his figure moved, disappearing from the people’s line of sight.

Among the fiend race’s battalion, Heavenstar’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said to Di En, “Did you feel that that kid just now looked a lot like someone?”

With a xiantian mystic treasure coming into being this time, Blood Yama Hall and Eminent Orchid Imperial City formed a tacit agreement, sending large groups of powerhouses over.

Heavenstar and Di En were precisely among them.

Di En was not familiar with Ye Yuan, but Heavenstar’s impression was Ye Yuan was very deep.

At this time, Heavenstar finally discovered a hint of something amiss.
