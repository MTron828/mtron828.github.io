Chapter 2043: Peak Alchemy Meet

In the plaza, several tens of thousands of genius alchemists were in the midst of fierce battles.

The Cloudpill Summit was an alchemy grand gathering. Each time, there would be a batch of geniuses that flooded forth, becoming everyone’s focal point.

This time was no exception either. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The moment Yun Yi took the stage, it made the group of geniuses pale in comparison.

With his strength that just entered Dao Realm, it was akin to like a crane standing out among chickens in this kind of alchemy battle. The opponent did not have any strength to fight back at all.

“Tsk tsk, barring no accidents, Yun Yi will be the number one of this Cloudpill Summit’s Six-star Alchemy God group. He’s well-deserving of being Empyrean Pilljade’s great-grandson, calling him the number one alchemy genius isn’t in vain!”

The moment Yun Yi made his move, the onlookers were not stingy with their praises.

It was just that these words sounded so ear-piercing in Yun Yi’s ears.

Number one genius?

Truly satire!

Did you all forget Grandmaster Ye? He isn’t even half of my age!

Although Yun Yi understood that there was already no one who put Ye Yuan in this generation to appraise, his proud heart seemed to be pricked. He was unable to feel at ease.

Actually, his pressure was not just Ye Yuan but also involving another person.

This person was Ning Siyu.

Ning Siyu did not participate in the Five-star Alchemy God group, but she took part in the Six-star Alchemy God group!

Her strength already had no need to take part in the Five-star Alchemy God group anymore.

Since the start of the matches, Ning Siyu left people far behind in the dust and already cut down numerous Six-star Alchemy Gods.

Many of them were all seeded contestants that were fixed before the match.

Including Yun Yi, all the Six-star Alchemy Gods felt a never-before pressure.

This Ning Siyu was just a measly little maidservant of Ye Yuan’s!

Could it be that a maidservant was also going to replicate her master’s battle achievement that looked down upon the world?

“My God, truly incredible! That Ning Siyu actually defeated Hua Tianqiang! That’s the Qiunan’s Hua Family’s number one genius!”

Suddenly, a series of exclamations came from the crowd.

Clearly, there was a new battle report that came over again.

Upon hearing Ning Siyu’s name, Yun Yi’s breathing blocked up, some unsteadiness actually appeared in his control of the flame.

The opponent was currently being pressured until he could not catch his breath. This interval immediately let him see a trace of hope.

It was just that he did not know how intense the shock in Yun Yi’s heart was currently.

Hua Tianqiang was the alchemy ancient family, the Hua Family’s top genius. In terms of strength, he was an existence that could rank in the top ten in the Six-star group too.

Now, he actually lost to a Five-star Alchemy God little girl!

“Grandmaster Ye is truly remarkable. A little maidservant of his actually has such terrifying strength.”

“Heh, I’ve already understood the situation, this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City is merely a barren land. Its rise is also merely something that happened in the recent several hundred years. How can this kind of place have any genius? This is also to say that Ning Siyu only used a few short hundred years under Grandmaster Ye’s guidance, and then she reached grand completion Initial Realm! This kind of means is simply inconceivable!”

“What did you say? Several hundred years to groom a grand completion Initial Realm? Then given time, wouldn’t this Ning Siyu surpass Young Master Yun Yi?”

...

Before this, no one would go and pay attention to what kind of place Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was at all.

But many days had passed, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s background was dug out very quickly.

Southridge, this kind of remote place, normally, no one would go and pay attention at all.

They also did not believe that Southridge would produce what unparalleled genius.

It was absolutely impossible for Ning Siyu this kind of bumpkin to have much strength before encountering Ye Yuan.

But in just a short few centuries, a grand completion Initial Realm powerhouse already rose up.

Giving Ning Siyu another few hundred, or even a thousand years’ time, surpassing Yun Yi this Southern Border’s number one genius might not be impossible.

What did this show?

This showed that not only was Grandmaster Ye’s own strength fearsome to the extreme, his ability to teach disciples was also rarely seen in the world!

A barren Southridge, Ye Yuan even brought up Ning Siyu this kind of powerhouse. Then if it were these geniuses?

Thinking up to here, everyone’s goosebumps welled up.

For some time, hearts rippled.

...

Ye Yuan naturally did not know the thoughts of the several tens of thousands of alchemists outside, he was currently participating in the Peak Alchemy Meet at this time.

The Peak Alchemy Meet was the main show of the titans.

Bang!

Empyrean Pilljade suddenly smacked the table and stood up, saying furiously, “Brat, your appetite is also too big! Even if you’re half-step Ancestor Realm, you’re also merely a Six-star Alchemy God. You actually asked for 50% the moment you open your mouth?”

One had to know, the share that Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital controlled was also merely 40%.

The other Empyreans also revealed unhappy looks, clearly feeling that Ye Yuan’s appetite was too big.

It was only to see Ye Yuan saying coolly, “With our Myriad Treasure Tower’s strength, what’s the problem with occupying 50%? Since this Cloudpill Summit has always determined the victor with alchemy battles, then why don’t we each place our bets and carry on battling in alchemy?”

The group of Empyreans could not help nearly fainting in anger when they heard that. Your Myriad Treasure Tower had an Ancestor Realm and a half-step Ancestor Realm, who could beat you guys in alchemy battles?

Empyrean Pilljade smiled coldly and said, “Is that so? Then if ... this Empyrean doesn’t agree?”

Ye Yuan looked toward Empyrean Pilljade and said expressionlessly, “If you don’t agree, then why not dissolve the partnership then? At that time, every one of us, each will rely on their own ability. It also wouldn’t be to an extent of quarreling endlessly like now.”

“You!” Empyrean Pilljade nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

Before the Cloudpill Summit appeared, the Southern Border’s alchemy world could be said to be in the warring states era, feudal kings in a tangled warfare.

Several dozen medicinal pill shops would even appear in the same place, belonging to different factions.

At that time, everyone unleashed everything in their arsenal in order to vie for territory. Things naturally could not dispense with price wars.

In the end, everyone made huge losses.

Only all the way until the holy land alliance appeared was there today’s situation.

Everyone had their own territories and developed with peace of mind, and could all earn divine essence stones, everyone was happy.

If the partnership was dissolved, then the Southern Border would definitely enter the warring states era once more.

At that time, who could block the Myriad Treasure Tower’s footsteps?

One had to know, the Myriad Treasure Tower was like a parasite, setting up all over the entire Heavenspan World.

It was precisely this contract that restricted the Myriad Treasure Tower’s development.

Of course, this was also because the Myriad Treasure Tower did not have Ancestor Realm alchemists.

But now, the Myriad Treasure Tower had an Ancestor Realm alchemist. Furthermore, there was even an additional alchemist who was about to step into Ancestor Realm.

If the partnership was dissolved, the consequences would be too dreadful to contemplate.

“Our Myriad Treasure Tower has one Ancestor Realm and a half-step Ancestor Realm, but only occupy 50% of the share, is it very overboard? If we really dissolve the partnership, I believe you all also know the consequences. Moreover, I still have more than ten kinds of new medicinal pills in my hands. The medicinal effects are at least 30% stronger than the medicinal pills on the market. Once I throw them in, what will you all use to block?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept, overflowing with overbearingness.

This Peak Alchemy Meet was a bunch of alchemists lining up and dividing the fruits here.

How to allocate, it was naturally distributed according to strength.

“More than ten kinds of medicinal pills? Heh, who are you scaring?”

“Do you really think that new pill formulas are a wholesale market, a big bunch with one grab?”

...

The group of Empyreans snickered unceasingly.

But a hint of glimmer flashed across in Empyrean Lumen’s eyes. He sighed and said, “What Grandmaster Ye says is likely the truth! With his understanding of Alchemy Dao, remodeling the current medicinal pills is likely ... as easy as turning his hand over!”

“WHAT?!”

Everyone was stricken with fear!

Empyrean Lumen naturally would not talk through his hat. Those present also all knew that Ye Yuan had once reconstructed a pill formula.

Could it be that this kid still had such terrifying deducing ability?
