Chapter 2690: Reaping What One Has Sown

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, they all said that you couldn’t come out. But I knew that you’d definitely come out!?Hehe,?see, I guess correctly, right?”

Little Dragon Girl dashed into Ye Yuan’s arms at once and raised her head as if showing off.

Black Flood Dragon King also came up and said with a smile, “Just now, seeing that Young Friend Ye didn’t come out, this king was very worried. Young Friend Ye is indeed a lucky one!”

Although the father and daughter two people were pleasantly surprised, it was quite different on the inside.

Little Dragon Girl was sincerely blessing him, but Black Flood Dragon King was hiding a dagger in his smile.

Ye Yuan stroked Little Dragon Girl’s head and flashed her a slight smile.

Ye Yuan looked towards Youqing and said with a faint smile, “Since everyone came out, then we should also settle some scores!”

Youqing was taken aback and said with a cold smile, “Settle scores??Huhu,?it’s time to settle scores! In the Land of Dragon Slumber, there was that mysterious power protecting you, letting you escape a calamity by a fluke! Now, I want to see who can still save you!”

Coming out of the Land of Dragon Slumber, Ye Yuan’s aura did not increase much, he was still a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven.

While his strength had skyrocketed.

Let alone that those three Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratums also had a sharp increase in strength.

Wouldn’t dealing with a mere Ye Yuan be easily accomplished?

Before Ye Yuan said anything, Little Dragon Girl immediately said, “Big Brother Youqing, if you dare to make a move against Big Brother Ye Yuan, I’ll help him beat you!”

Little Dragon Girl’s words made Youqing’s expression change.

This lass was not to be trifled with!

Especially the Emerald Sea Divine Conch in her hand, it was simply a dreadful thing.

Even three Jade Sovereign Heavens attacking together was not a match as well!

Youqing’s face fell and he looked towards Black Flood Dragon King and said, “Dragon Lord, is your Thistle South Sea Region really going to intervene in our personal grudge?”

Black Flood Dragon King just said coolly, “You and Ye Yuan are both my Thistle South’s guests. As long as you’re in my Thistle South Sea Region, you naturally can’t attack. If you insist on making a move against him, then this king can only take action.”

Youqing’s face turned black, immediately feeling that life was murky gray.

He shot Ye Yuan a fierce glare and gritted his teeth and said, “Punk, consider yourself lucky, let’s go!”

Now that he had already made great gains, Youqing naturally did not have the need to continue staying here anymore.

He brought his people and was just about to leave, but heard Ye Yuan say coolly, “Did I say that I let you go?”

Youqing turned to look at Ye Yuan and could not help laughing as he said, “Why? What can you really do to me? Just based on your middling skills, do you really think that you’re somebody of note?”

Buzz!

Youqing’s voice had just faded when he felt as if his origin divinity was struck by a bolt of lightning.

His origin divinity actually started to disintegrate under this bolt of lightning.

His eyes started to turn slack, his consciousness gradually blurring.

Finally, he fell softly to the ground.

“Dragon Son!”

Those three Jade Sovereign Heavens turned pale with fright and hurriedly went up to check, but they discovered that Youqing had already breathed his last.

One exchange and Youqing was dead!

Ye Yuan was quite satisfied with the power of this Heaven Illuminating Divine Lightning move.

Many origin divinity mystic arts were recorded in the Divine Emergence, the power being extremely shocking.

Ye Yuan was also just trying his hand against Youqing. He did not expect that the power was pretty good.

A grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse was actually one-shotted in an instant!

At this time, Ye Yuan also deeply felt the power of this soul race mystic art.

“Origin divinity attack! What a powerful origin divinity attack!” Black Flood Dragon King’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise.

Regarding this scene earlier, even he did not react in time.

A lower Limitless Sublime Heaven actually used an origin divinity attack to one-shot a grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum. This was not what ordinary origin divinity attacks could accomplish!

Moreover, Youqing was not an ordinary person.

Although Youqing was a pseudo-dragon, his origin divinity was still much stronger than the average human martial artist.

But Ye Yuan still one-shotted him!

One of the Jade Sovereign Heaven suddenly raised his head and said angrily, “You dared to kill Dragon Son! Today, you must die!”

In an instant, three Jade Sovereign Heavens arrived at the same time.

Ye Yuan was not the slightest bit afraid and roared loudly, “Heaven Illuminating Divine Lightning!”

Three origin divinity attacks were launched at the same time!

The lower Limitless Sublime Heaven Ye Yuan actually took the initiative to attack three great Jade Sovereign Heavens!

Buzz!

The three people only felt their heads become muddled. Their origin divinities were actually directly paralyzed!

The origin divinity of a Jade Sovereign Heaven was incomparably powerful. But Ye Yuan’s Heaven Illuminating Divine Lightning still dazed them for a short time.

At the same time, Ye Yuan’s Heavenspan Mountain suddenly burst forth, turning into a streak of black smoke, smashing towards one of the Jade Sovereign Heavens.

“Pffft!”

That person spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, flying out backward.

This scene struck deep terror in everyone!

Ye Yuan’s combat power refreshed their understanding over and over again!

A lower Limitless Sublime Heaven actually confronted three great Jade Sovereign Heavens at the same time, and even seriously injured one!

“This guy is really too strong!”

“Origin divinity attack being coupled with a heavenly spirit treasure, there’s simply no weakness to exploit!”

“It’s also that the three of them are all Jade Sovereign Heavens. Otherwise, that origin divinity attack would probably have been able to instantly kill three people! What kind of lucky chance did this guy obtain inside?”

… …

No matter how weak a Jade Sovereign Heaven was, it was a Sovereign Realm powerhouse too, they were on completely different levels from Sublime Realm powerhouses.

But Ye Yuan broke this law and actually severely wounded the other party!

However, after this bout of attack, Ye Yuan appeared very weak too, his complexion a little pale.

After all, it was Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. This bout of origin divinity attacks was still rather taxing for him.

But right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

“Roar, roar, roar!”

More than ten peak Jade Sovereign Heaven water dragons suddenly rampaged, attacking the weakened Ye Yuan. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The power of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch suddenly bloomed!

Little Dragon Girl’s expression changed wildly, and she exclaimed, “Royal Father, why did you attack Big Brother Ye Yuan?”

This attack was launched precisely by Black Flood Dragon King deploying the Emerald Sea Divine Conch.

Black Flood Dragon King taking action, the power of the water dragon was not what Little Dragon Girl could compare to.

The strength of these water dragons was all peak Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Against more than ten peak Jade Sovereign Heaven water dragons, even if they encountered a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, it would be a cinch too.

But now, it was actually used to deal with a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Of course, Black Flood Dragon King did not attack with his full strength.

If he exerted his full strength, he would be able to launch several half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven super water dragons!

That level of existence, even other royals would have to keep a wide berth too!

It was also precisely by relying on the power of the Emerald Sea Divine Conch that Black Flood Dragon King showed completely no regard for the other royal clans in the seven great sea regions.

When those three great Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses saw this scene, they had wildly ecstatic expressions too.

They did not expect that Black Flood Dragon King actually made a move to deal with Ye Yuan!

This sudden turn of events was what everyone did not expect.

Furthermore, it was even taking advantage of his predicament!

It was just that at this time, no one detected that a hint of disdain showed at the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth.

A dark-red imprint suddenly lit up at his glabella.

Those over a dozen water dragons already arrived in front of him, but suddenly turned around and pounced over toward the Black Flood Dragon King himself.

When everyone saw this scene, they were immediately dumbfounded.

What was going on?

Black Flood Dragon King’s expression changed too, suddenly bursting forth with a surge of dragon qi.

“Flood Dragon Goes to Sea!”

Black Flood Dragon King threw both fists out, a terrifying undulation smashed towards those water dragons.

Rumble!

Black Flood Dragon King fell back several thousand feet, his complexion becoming very pale.

He looked toward Ye Yuan, eyes full of shock..
