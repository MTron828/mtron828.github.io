Chapter 1351: Ruthlessness Is the Mark of a Great Man

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang!

In his rage, Chen Yongnian’s one palm smashed the few case files in front of him into fine powder.

The humiliation that Ye Yuan brought to him today was something that he had never experienced before.

“Brother Chen, this Ye Yuan is really too much! You’re the exalted city lord, he actually didn’t give you any face at all!” Wang Su fanned the fire by the side.

Truthfully speaking, he also felt an immense threat of death just now.

He clearly saw Ye Yuan’s gaze sweep over toward him, imperceptibly.

That look seemingly saw through everything.

However, Ye Yuan still did not attack in the end. Maybe he was wary of the Wang Family behind him.

The Wang Family was a second to none great family clan in Brightraise City, the experts in the clan as abundant as clouds.

His elder brother, Wang Song, was even Brightraise City’s deputy city lord!

Thinking up to here, Wang Su felt proud of himself in his heart.

One shouldn’t look at how that punk had an appearance of fearing nothing and no one. He was still somewhat apprehensive in the end.

“Humph! Not avenging this grudge, I, Chen Yongnian, am less than human!” Chen Yongnian said with a livid expression.

Wang Su had an appearance of wanting to speak but swallowing the words back by the side.

Chen Yongnian immediately understood and said to the Lu and Lin two family heads, “Today’s matter, I hope that only the few of us know. I don’t wish for it to spread to other people’s ears!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lu and Lin, the two family heads were startled and hurriedly said, “City Lord rest assured. Even if you lend us several galls, we wouldn’t dare either!”

Chen Yongnian waved his hand impatiently. The Lu and Lin two family heads hastily took their leave.

They knew that Chen Yongnian and Wang Su were probably going to plot to harm Ye Yuan.

But they did not have any objections towards this. After all, their faces were also utterly lost today.

They originally thought that they could reap a huge deal. They did not expect to almost lose their old lives here.

After the four people left, Wang Su said, “Brother Chen, that punk has a middle-stage Two-star evil spirit guarding. Wanting to kill him in Jewelhill City probably won’t be easy anymore!”

Although Chen Yongnian had unwillingness in his heart when he heard that, he also knew that what Wang Su said was the truth.

“What brilliant ideas do Younger Brother, you, have? If this boy doesn’t die, this Chen will probably be unable to cultivate in peace anymore!” Chen Yongnian said and gnashed his teeth in hatred.

The corners of Wang Su’s mouth revealed a trace of a strange smile and said, “This boy has a great sense of propriety when doing things. He had a good pretext for killing Wang Lingbo and Wang Yuxiang. We really can’t do anything to him! But ...”

Wang Su whispered a few words in Chen Yongnian’s ear. Chen Yongnian similarly revealed an odd smile.

“Heh, Younger Brother, you’re indeed a resourceful person! It’s just that ... this way is truly a bit too vicious, right?” Chen Yongnian said.

“A small mind makes not a gentleman, ruthlessness is the mark of a great man! As long as we can kill this boy, what does this count as?” Wang Su said without a care.

...

Now, even the Wang Family was declining. The Liang Family had naturally lost its former glory.

These few days, Wang Pianran brought her daughter, Liang Wanrong back to her parents’ home for a distraction.

Suddenly, she received a message passed on by a servant, saying that the main family’s Sir Su invited her to make a trip over.

Wang Pianran came to the Wang Family’s main hall without knowing the inside story, but she discovered that inside the main hall was long packed full of people already.

Dividing the crowd, Wang Pianran saw a piece of shroud placed on the ground.

Below the white cloth, it was uncertain who was dead.

Wang Su said on the seat of honor, his expression grim.

Wang Pianran was not a dumb person. Her heart thumped, immediately sensing something off.

“Sir Su, this ... What’s going on here?” Wang Pianran could not resist asking.

When Wang Su saw her, he slowly stood up and said with a sorrowful look, “Everyone is here. Now, Wang Su has something to tell everybody.

Finished talking, he bowed deeply towards everyone and said, “Wang Su is incompetent and failed to protect the family head and Elder Yuxiang!”

While talking, he pulled away the shroud. That frozen corpse of Wang Yuxiang’s appeared before everyone’s eyes.

“Dad!”

That shrill voice of Wang Pianran’s instantly spread throughout the entire Wang Family.

“Dad! Why have you gone! Who struck this vicious blow! You tell Pianran, Pianran will definitely wreak vengeance and redress hatred for you!”

Wang Pianran shrieked and howled, but she was also pouring out her true sentiments.

All along, she was a missus, being spoiled by her father and big brother.

Now, her backing had collapsed, how could she not be mournful?

When the rest of the clan members saw the Wang Family’s biggest backer died just like this, all of their faces were grief-stricken.

“Sir Su, my father was still fine in the morning. Why did he pass away? W-Where is my big brother?” After a bout of bitter crying, Wang Pianran pulled Wang Su and asked this question.

Wang Su was disgusted with this fat sow, but at this moment, it was inconvenient for him to have a fall out with her. At once, he said mournfully, “Elder Brother he ... suffered a vicious blow too, his corpse no more!”

Wang Pianran’s entire body trembled, nearly passing out.

“Sir Su, who was it? Just who in the world was it? I ... I’m going to kill him!” At this time, Wang Pianran’s entire person was only left with rage.

Wang Su said with a sorrowful face, “It ... It was the Myriad Treasure Tower!”

Wang Pianran’s gaze revealed an extremely vicious look as she gnashed her teeth in hatred and said, “Myriad Treasure Tower! Ye Yuan! You all just wait, I’ll definitely make you all die a horrible death!”

Seeing Wang Pianran’s fury, a hint of an imperceptible faint smile flashed across Wang Su’s face.

...

“Ye Yuan, you offended all of Jewelhill City’s major forces this time!” Yang Rui sighed and said.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “Why? Does Tower Lord blame me for being meddlesome?”

Yang Rui was stupefied and scolding laughingly, “You punk, checkmating me, is it? If it’s done, it’s done, would I, Yang Rui, be that kind of person who fears to get involved? Today was originally they all going overboard. You doing so was naturally a great satisfaction! It’s just ... that Chen Yongnian and Wang Su are both not people to mess with. I’m afraid that they will be detrimental to you!”

But Ye Yuan said without care, “Heh, it’s fine if they don’t come and provoke me! Come and provoke me again, it wouldn’t end carelessly like this today!”

Ye Yuan’s careless killing intent faintly exuded out, giving Yang Rui a shock.

He had always thought that Ye Yuan was just an alchemist harmless to man and beast, but he did not expect that Ye Yuan still had such decisiveness in going for the kill side!

“Furthermore ... I already can’t stay for much longer in this Jewelhill City. If they want to find me to take revenge, they also got to be able to find me!” Ye Yuan suddenly said with a smile.

Yang Rui was first stunned, following that, his expression changed, and he said, “You ... You’re leaving?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Jewelhill City is too small after all. If I want to become strong, I must walk out! Huhu, Brother Yang Rest assured, I believe your Myriad Treasure Tower’s high-level alchemy god is already on the way. When I teach him how to refine the Essence Cultivating Pill, there naturally won’t need to worry about a situation where the Essence Cultivating Pill lacks continuation.”

Yang Rui was stunned again and said, “High-level alchemy god? Coming to Jewelhill City? This ... This isn’t possible, right?”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Do you think that this Essence Cultivating Pill is really what anyone can refine? I reckon that your Myriad Treasure Tower has to send a Three-star Alchemy God over at the minimum.”

Yang Rui drew a cold breath when he heard that!

All along, they only cared about selling Essence Cultivating Pills and really did not know how great the refining difficulty of this medicinal pill was.

But hearing Ye Yuan say so, it was also overly exaggerating things to raise the alarm, right?

Refining a Tier 1 middle-grade divine pill needed a Three-star Alchemy God to come and learn?
