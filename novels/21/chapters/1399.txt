Chapter 1403 The Brave Wins When Meeting on a Narrow Path!

Qiu Shuisheng’s brows furrowed, looking at the arrival.

“You’re a fellow disciple of Ye Yuan?” Qiu Shuisheng asked.

Qin Shao nodded his head and said, “His vanquished foe!”

Qiu Shuisheng did not reveal a surprised look. To be able to be evenly-matched with Jin Yu, this one in front of him could not possibly be Ye Yuan’s match no matter what.

“In front of Jin Yu, nobody can hold back! Furthermore ... Jin Yu didn’t exert his full strength as well!” Qiu Shuisheng said indifferently.

Qin Shao gave him a glance and said, “Your experience doesn’t work on Ye Yuan. He is a person born to create miracles!”

Qiu Shuisheng could not help laughing and said, “You have some jitters from imaginary fear after being defeated under Ye Yuan’s hands, right? Martial artists mustn’t lose their own heart of Martial Dao!”

Qin Shao said nonchalantly, “You’ll know when you keep watching.”

Hearing the news of Ye Yuan battling heroes alone, Qin Shao was inexplicably amazed at first too.

But very soon, he felt at ease.

He knew what Ye Yuan was thinking, no occasion was more suitable to temper oneself than this place.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s method to temper himself was too capricious. Even Jin Yu did not dare to do so either.

This guy was really crazy!

Qin Shao was also considered to know Ye Yuan very well. Back then, him agreeing to a life-and-death battle seemed very reckless. Actually, he had absolute confidence in himself.

Hence, he knew that this time was no exception too!

Ye Yuan and Jin Yu, the two people, deconstructed moves upon seeing them, being tangled up in a fierce struggle, making everyone dumbfounded.

“This Ye Yuan is actually so strong, to be able to fight to a draw with Jin Yu!”

“When did such a formidable figure emerge from Wu Meng Capital City? We actually don’t even know!”

“Vaulting into prominence in one battle! This battle, regardless of whether win or lose, Ye Yuan’s name shall spread throughout the hundred cities!”

...

In these hundred cities’ area, Jin Yu was a benchmark. It was completely impossible for anyone to beat him.

Qiu Shuisheng could not either!

But today, Ye Yuan was actually able to be locked in battle with him!

It was just that they did not know, the current Jin Yu was the same as He Ning, actually depressed to the extreme.

It looked like the two of them were about on par, either able to do anything to the other.

In reality, when he exchanged moves with Ye Yuan, it was completely relying on all-round surpassing in realm and laws that he could barely manage to fight to a draw.

The more Jin Yu fought, the more alarmed he got. He had long seen through that Ye Yuan’s sword art was only that one move back and forth.

No matter how he made his move, it was all a ‘chop’ word.

The sword was the king of a hundred weapons, with a myriad of variations!

People who used the sword would also mostly pursue the limits of variation, using it to subdue the enemy and win.

But Ye Yuan acted in a diametrically opposite way, forcefully changing the sword into a chopper, only knew chop chop chop!

But Jin Yu had no choice but to admit that Ye Yuan already utilized a ‘chop’ word to a transcendent realm.

Furthermore, no idea why, Jin Yu kept feeling that the divine essence gushing out from Ye Yuan’s move was grand and boundless, with a feeling of unable to overcome with force.

His divine essence was seemingly a small rowboat in the ocean in front of Ye Yuan; he might capsize at any time.

Hence, similarly one move, he had to use much more divine essence than Ye Yuan before he could barely manage to suppress Ye Yuan.

This kind of feeling, he had never encountered it before.

All in all, clearly his strength was much greater than Ye Yuan’s. Yet, he could not gain the slightest bit of advantage!

This sort of feeling made him depressed until he wanted to vomit blood.

In a twinkle, the two people fought for a thousand moves. You deconstruct my move, I deconstruct your move, shaving off a large chunk of the entire hilltop.

“Can’t carry on like this anymore! Ye Yuan’s divine essence is endless, as if a boundless sea, unable to see the slightest hint of drying up! No wonder he said that no need to rest earlier! Carry on expending like this, the first to fall will definitely be me.” Jin Yu was considering this in his mind as he fought.

If outsiders knew his thoughts, they would definitely get a huge shock.

A half-step Heaven Glimpse Realm powerhouse actually lost to a late-stage Grotto Profound in divine essence. This was simply too inconceivable.

Clank!

Jin Yu deliberately opened up a flaw and was slashed by Ye Yuan’s sword, his body flying out backward.

Jin Yu’s body hung in midair, without anywhere to borrow strength. How could Ye Yuan let go of such a chance? He followed up with Sundering Stars once more!

Seeing this scene, a hint of a smile flickered across the corners of Qiu Shuisheng’s mouth and he said to Qiu Shuisheng, “Ye Yuan is losing!”

Qin Shao was stupefied, not quite certain what it meant. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiu Shuisheng smiled and said, “Ye Yuan is indeed very strong. But this move, Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels, I’m unable to crack it no matter what. Under this sort of circumstance, it’s even more impossible for Ye Yuan to resolve it.”

Ye Yuan was currently in the midst of pursuit when suddenly, his expression changed. An incredibly dangerous aura hit him head-on!

Jin Yu’s body drew a perfect arc in midair, his longsword sweeping off the ground, his body flying up once more.

This series of actions was done in one breath. Jin Yu’s entire person seemingly transformed into a sharp sword, charging over towards Ye Yuan.

“Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels!”

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, discovering that Jin Yu really achieved unison of man and sword!

This move, Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels, had an indomitable imposing momentum, not stopping without seeing blood!

Under this sword, everything was eclipsed!

This was the true strength of the hundred cities’ number one person!

“It’s Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels! Ye Yuan will definitely lose without a doubt!”

“This move, Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels

“To be able to force Jin Yu to use Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels, Ye Yuan can be sufficiently proud!”

...

Under the situation where everyone thought that it was impossible, Jin Yu used his ace in the hole, Roaming Qi Returning to Bowels.

Ye Yuan already did not have room to maneuver. The only path of survival was to crush the jade pendant!

But right then, everyone’s faces changed once more!

“He ... What’s he trying to do?”

Out of every one’s expectations, under the situation where the initiative was already lost, Ye Yuan did not retreat, but he advanced instead!

Every fraction he advanced, Ye Yuan’s aura would be a fraction stronger!

“Sundering Stars!”

The Evil Extermination Sword in Ye Yuan’s hand was not sluggish in the slightest, still chopping down with an indomitable will!

The two swords had yet to intersect when two surges of overwhelming auras collided together, stirring up the surrounding divine essence into an upheaval.

One pressed forward with an indomitable will, one had an overwhelming imposing momentum!

It was truly a meeting on a narrow path!

Boom!

Two surges of refined to the extreme power of laws collided together violently.

The air billows stirred up shook until everyone could not open their eyes!

Two figures each flew out backward like kites with broken strings.

Slam!

Slam!

The two people each fell onto the ground, smashing a deep pit in the ground.

Everyone all held their breaths, not knowing just who won and who lost in this fight.

Qiu Shuisheng sucked in a cold breath. He did not expect that under that kind of circumstance, Ye Yuan could still release that kind of domineering counterattack!

Not only was Ye Yuan’s strength overpowering, but his battle will was also unyielding and dauntless.

“Huuuu ...”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan slowly crawled out from inside the deep hole, bleeding all over his body, his aura chaotic, looking very miserable.

Qin Shao gave Qiu Shuisheng a glance and said, “I wonder if after today, you still have the courage to fight with Ye Yuan or not?”
