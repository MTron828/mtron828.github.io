Chapter 2737: I’m Familiar with This Place!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Labyrinth Divine Palace!”

Hearing this name, Mi Tian could not help exclaiming in surprise.

Ye Yuan was also surprised. A place that could make Mi Tian cry out in surprise was definitely not a simple place.

Up until now, there was only the Myriad Realms Mountain that could truly surprise Mi Tian.

Of course, Ye Yuan remained unmoved on the surface.

“Senior, you know the Labyrinth Divine Palace?” Ye Yuan asked.

Mi Tian did not answer Ye Yuan, but muttered to himself, “I didn’t expect that where this place connects to is actually the Heaven Fragmented Continent! Kid, promise him first.”

That tone carried a strong sense of nostalgia.

“But …” Ye Yuan somewhat hesitated as he said.

At a conservative estimate, Yan Jadetrue had middle Saint Sovereign Heaven strength back then too.

Furthermore, he was not an average middle Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Something that even Yan Jadetrue could not get, could he, a puny little Jade Sovereign Heaven, get it?

“I’m familiar with the place!” Mi Tian did not explain too much and just said these four light-sounding words.

But Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, and he opened his mouth and said, “Okay!”

Yan Jadetrue smiled and said, “Very good! He who understands the times is a wise man! There’s something in the Labyrinth Divine Palace called Voidsnap Immortal Condensation! You bring it out, and this exalt will naturally let your sweetheart go.”

“Alright, deal!” Ye Yuan did not waste his breath either, agreeing readily.

Of course, he had no choice either.

That Yan Jadetrue smiled strangely and immediately fell softly to the ground.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly, arriving at the entrance to the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm with a teleport.

Ye Yuan had his own judgment about Yan Jadetrue too.

That guy must have been seriously injured back then, even being on the verge of death. That was why he lay dormant in the Heavenspan World.

With his Saint Sovereign Heaven strength, even if Ye Yuan broke through to Heavenly Stratum, it was impossible to find him too.

Probably until now, Yan Jadetrue had not recovered to his peak state either.

“Senior, what’s this Voidsnap Immortal Condensation?” Ye Yuan asked.

“Voidsnap Immortal Condensation, it’s a chaos variant with the ability to seize heaven’s good fortune. That little fellow probably wants this item in order to break through to the realm of True Sovereign Heaven!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed slightly and he said, “In that case, he’s already grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

Mi Tian chuckled and said, “If you know what the Heaven Fragmented Continent is, you wouldn’t be making such a big fuss. Come on. Go in first. In this world, your every action and movement can’t escape his surveillance.”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and took a step out, entering another space.

Suddenly, abundance landed in Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Thick spiritual energy even made Ye Yuan feel a little short of breath.

“Such rich spiritual energy!” Even Big Yellow could not resist exclaiming in surprise too. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This space is so weird! It’s actually even richer than Rainclear Continent’s spiritual energy! The power of rules here is also the 33 Heavens’ rules!” Ye Yuan frowned and said.

This was clearly an independent space that looked like a small world.

But Ye Yuan felt like he had returned to the 33 Heavens!

Furthermore, this place gave Ye Yuan an extremely dangerous feeling.

It was really hard to imagine that the Heavenspan World was actually connected to such a strange space.

“Huhu,?it’s indeed the Heaven Fragmented Continent! That fool is giving you a lucky chance!”

Arriving at this world, Mi Tian was no longer acting in a secretive manner either, directly making a sound.

“Lucky chance?” Big Yellow was taken aback.

Mi Tian smiled and said, “Do you all know what the Labyrinth Divine Palace is?”

Ye Yuan did not speak, waiting quietly for Mi Tian to continue.

“The Labyrinth Divine Palace was once a major force that covered all the heavens, powerhouses plentiful like clouds, flourishing for a period of time! They were once Crimson Bright and Yang Heaven’s strongest sect, and not one of! But sadly, this sect was too ambitious, to actually want to unify the 33 Heavens! However, their strength was really strong too. The Labyrinth Divine Palace expanded continuously and virtually swept across more than half of the 33 Heavens’ territory!”

“In the end, it finally provoked the hegemons of the heavens to move out, triggering the All Heavens War! That battle fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open, all the heavens collapsing! This isn’t a description. It was really that heaven was rent asunder and the earth cracked! Labyrinth Divine Palace’s sects along with an entire continent were directly shattered, drifting into chaos! This is also the origin of the Heaven Fragmented Continent. I didn’t expect that it actually fell here!”

Ye Yuan and Big Yellow listened, and they could not help drawing a breath of cold air.

How stable was the 33 Heavens’ space?

Not entering Jade Sovereign Heaven, one could not even fly for a long time.

But the All Heavens War actually drove an entire continent into the void.

That level of battle, how grand and torrential was it? How abnormally tragic was it?

“Hegemons of the heavens …”

Ye Yuan muttered and said, “Senior, hegemons of the heavens … what kind of strength is that?”

Mi Tian smiled and said, “The strength of hegemons of the heavens isn’t what you can imagine currently! You just have to know, they can access heaven and penetrate the earth, reverse heaven and earth, and are omnipotent! In your Rainclear Continent, Saint Sovereign Heavens can be called Saint Exalts. But, in front of a faction like the Labyrinth Divine Palace, Saint Sovereign Heavens doesn’t even have the qualifications to guard the door! Rainclear Continent is merely a corner of the 33 Heavens where spiritual energy is scarce, that’s all.”

“You guys should have felt the spiritual energy here. At its heyday, Heaven Fragmented Continent’s spiritual energy was a hundred times of this place! Under such an environment, what does mere Saint Sovereign Heaven could as?”

Ye Yuan felt an upsurge of emotion as he listened. Only then did he realize his insignificance. He was sitting in the well and looking at the sky!

“Senior, could it be that you … were a hegemon of the heavens too?” Big Yellow asked curiously.

Mi Tian said coolly, “True members of the Dragon Clan are born in chaos and equal to heaven! They are Hegemon Realm when born, what do you think?”

Big Yellow opened his bull eyes wide, opening his mouth wide, a dumbfounded look on his face.

Born as a Hegemon!

This was really too demoralizing.

All sentient beings went against heavens, going through countless tribulations, before they could corroborate their Dao as Heavenly Stratum.

But some people were already born at the finish point.

Was it aggravating or not?

But Ye Yuan’s gaze flickered and he suddenly said, “Senior, you said that Hegemon Realm can access heaven and penetrate the earth and reverse heaven and earth! Then, if I reach the realm of Hegemon, can I resurrect the dead?”

He suddenly remembered that hint of undulation in front of his father’s grave after he killed Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang with his own hands and asked with a hint of hope.

“That will depend on who it is! It’s true that Hegemon Realm reverses heaven and earth, but everyone’s ability is different. However, I know that the Lord of Samsara indeed has the ability to revere Yin and Yang. Of course, he’s also not omnipotent. He can revive some people, but others, he can’t,” Mi Tian said.

Mi Tian said it lightly, but Ye Yuan’s eyes radiated a brilliant light.

Looks like that hint of undulation that he had once felt, was not an illusion!

Maybe, his father really had hopes of resurrecting!

However, he had to have adequate strength first.

Otherwise, how could he talk to the Lord of Samsara, this level of powerhouse?

“Many thanks to Senior for clarifying my doubts! The Labyrinth Divine Palace trip this time, I’ll have to trouble Senior!” Ye Yuan said.

“No need to thank me, the faster your strength improves, the sooner I can go home! However, this Heaven Fragmented Continent has really withered! That bunch of fools, they have already started to take the road to ruin.. Those 13 Saint Sovereign Heavens, do they regard themselves as infallible? Come on, let’s go and join them,” Mi Tian said with a smile.
