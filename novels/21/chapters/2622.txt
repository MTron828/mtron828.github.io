Chapter 2628: True Grade Emerges! Holy Son Defeated! A Storm Arises!

Cang Yongning was indeed an opponent worthy of respect.

This was Cang Yongning’s most difficult battle. So how was it also not Ye Yuan’s most difficult battle?

Although this guy was haughty, one had to admit, he was absolutely an alchemy path genius!

In alchemy, Ye Yuan had never been unduly humble, he knew that he himself was a peerless genius.

But Cang Yongning was no less inferior to him from any angle.

This guy was remarkable!

But that was also more worthy of victory.

This battle, the harvest that Ye Yuan obtained was inestimable!

Three months of fierce fighting had stimulated all the potential in his body.

If he still could not break through like this, then Ye Yuan would also be too much of a failure.

In reality, what was hard was not refining true grade.

The truly difficult thing was refining true grade under the suppression of your opponent!

That needed your strength to truly overwhelm your opponent!

After three months of fierce fighting, Ye Yuan’s and Cang Yongning’s improvements were tremendous.

It was just that, the two of their suppression on their opponents, kept maintaining the results at ninth grade perfection, that was all.

If Cang Yongning refined a pill by himself now, the chances of refining true grade would likely greatly increase.

Actually, during the 26th match, Ye Yuan already felt that he had broken through.

And all the way until now, the two had already fought 47 matches. Only then did Ye Yuan completely suppress Cang Yongning in terms of strength and bring down the Dao rule!

Of course, these were all internal. Only Ye Yuan himself knew about it.

Even Cang Yongning himself did not detect it either.

Therefore, he thought that this Dao rule was attracted by him.

The entire process was like boiling the frog slowly in warm water.

By the time the frog realized the truth, he could not jump out anymore.

Shock and disbelief were written all over Cang Yongning’s face.

“You … You … This is impossible! This isn’t possible!” He had never had such a setback in alchemy before.

After three months of fierce fighting, he was actually surpassed by Ye Yuan in all aspects!

This sort of thing should not have happened in his understanding!

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and fired a stream of divine essence into the medicine cauldron.

Buzz!

The moment the medicine cauldron opened, an aura of Great Dao instantly spread out.

A crystal-like medicinal pill flew onto Ye Yuan’s palm quietly.

There was no dazzling brilliance of a ninth grade golden pill and also no medicinal fragrance that greeted the nose.

There was nothing other than the simple and unadorned of returning to one’s original simplicity!

That was a crystal. It looked just like an ordinary glass ball. But it gave people an extraordinary feeling at a glance.

On the watchtower, Huangfu Cloudthink’s eyes turned sharp as he said, “Great Dao unembellished, returning to one’s original simplicity! It’s indeed true grade! If this boy isn’t eliminated, he’ll surely be my Pill Alliance’s mortal calamity!”

Xiao Feibai nodded slightly, his figure flashing and disappearing on the spot.

True grade grade two Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, it suspended on Ye Yuan’s palm quietly just like that.

After Cang Yongning saw it, his expression could not help changing greatly, his eyes full of horror!

True grade!

It was really true grade!

He was defeated!

“It’s also my first time refining this. Since you’re the Pill Alliance’s holy son, you should be able to tell whether it’s true grade or not, right?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

He was not afraid of Cang Yongning lying, even if Cang Yongning lied, Heavenly Dao would not lie.

The two of them swore an origin divinity curse to Heavenly Dao. Regardless of whether or not Cang Yongning admitted it, Heavenly Dao would judge it by itself.

Cang Yongning’s expression was ashen, and his lips turned purple.

Suddenly, he raised his head to the sky and gave a long howl, and fell down in pain.

The origin divinity curse erupted!

Heavenly Dao backlash was immensely painful.

And this scene also confirmed that the heavenly pill in Ye Yuan’s hand was indeed true grade!

True grade heavenly pill, it showed its true face in front of the world for the first time!

“This is a true grade heavenly pill? It’s pure like white snow!”

“Too incredible! Really too impressive! The spring of us ascenders is finally coming!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Master Ye is mighty! Master Ye is mighty!”

… …

No one paid attention to the loser. The ascenders present were all cheering joyfully.

In the royal palace, Feng Xuanyi almost jumped up. He had an excited face as he said, “True grade! It’s really true grade! This guy really did it!?Hahaha?…”

After the other four great sect masters’ shock, they were also extremely envious when they saw Feng Xuanyi’s appearance.

But sadly, Ye Yuan was born in the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect!

If he was born in their sect, how great would that be?

Although the Pill Pavilion would not restrict the background of the disciples, as Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s subsidiary force, the benefits obtained by the sect were self-evident!

“Go, quickly go to the scene! The more commotion it is at this time, the more careful we have to be!” Yang Jie suddenly said.

Everyone was shocked and hurriedly put away their excitement and rushed to Cloud Leisure Establishment.

The entire Cloudarch Great Nation was seething with excitement.

All of the ascenders were cheering joyfully.

Ye Yuan’s victory was not just his own victory; it was also the victory of ascenders!

His victory would usher in a new era and bring glad tidings to ascenders.

In a sense, the significance of Ye Yuan’s victory even surpassed Zhuo Bufan!

The cheers even drowned out Cang Yongning’s painful groans.

Amidst these cheers, Cang Yongning’s voice gradually weakened and finally quietened.

An alchemy genius of his generation fell here.

“Hahaha,?Ye Yuan, I indeed didn’t misjudge you! You vented my Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s frustration for the past 20 years!”

Amidst the loud laugh, Luo Yunqing headed straight for Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

In the crowd, several dozen piercing cold killing intent suddenly lit up.

All of a sudden, corpses flew about randomly around Ye Yuan.

At the same time, there were actually several dozen figures that charged towards him.

Each one of them, their strengths were so powerful that it was suffocating the people around them.

Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Dozens of Jade Sovereign Heavens!

Yes, dozens of people more than the assassins arranged by the Pill Alliance!

The ones who wanted Ye Yuan dead were not just like Pill Alliance.

The other four great heavenly regions’ heavenly sects did not want Ye Yuan to live either!

The sensation caused by this matter was seriously far too great.

It was naturally impossible for the four great heavenly regions to stay aloof from the affair.

The rise of the Pill Pavilion did not just threaten the interests of the Pill Alliance, there was even the safety of the four great heavenly regions.

Therefore, Ye Yuan must die!

Luo Yunqing’s expression changed wildly, immediately feeling his scalp tingle.

In just an instant, he felt it.

31 people!

31 Jade Sovereign Heavens!

In order to kill a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, 31 Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratums were dispatched at once!

The Pill Alliance really put down the blood capital!

However, he did not have time to think too much either, his entire person immediately turned into a sharp sword and rushed toward Ye Yuan.

At this moment, he only had one thought: to protect Ye Yuan from dying!

Even if he died, Ye Yuan could not die!

The significance of Ye Yuan’s existence was too great!

But he just moved and Uncle Wen moved already!

Uncle Wen, Cang Yongning’s follower, was a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse too.

Furthermore, his strength was only stronger and not weaker than Luo Yunqing.

“Get lost!” Luo Yunqing’s eyes turned bloodshot from anger and he roared furiously.

Uncle Wen was expressionless and said with indifference, “Give up. Even if immortals come today, they can’t save Ye Yuan either! He must die!”

Bang, bang, bang?…

In virtually an instant, Uncle Wen and Luo Yunqing exchanged more than ten moves.

But Luo Yunqing could not shake Uncle Wen off!

And those 31 Jade Sovereign heavens already rushed over!

Ye Yuan was in grave danger!
