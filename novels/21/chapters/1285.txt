Chapter 1289: Mute Girl Wanru

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The noon-day sun high in the sky, spiritual power was plentiful.

On a field overgrown with weeds, a group of carriages and horses with several dozen people were currently advancing slowly.

“Second Miss, there’s another half a month’s journey, and then we’ll reach the Myriad Beast Forest! After the Myriad Beast Forest, we won’t be far from Jewelhill City anymore.”

The one talking was a middle-aged man dressed as a guard. In front of him was a pretty-looking woman.

Looking at that appearance, she should be the leader of this company.

“En, instruct everyone to be a little more careful. The Myriad Beast Forest has been rather tumultuous recently. After passing through the Myriad Beast Forest, this young lady will give everybody double the pay,” the woman said with a nod.

The middle-aged man was overjoyed and said, “Thank you very much, Second Miss!”

He turned around and called out to the group of guards: “Did everybody hear that? Second Miss wants to double our pay, so all buck up and be smart about it! Do you hear me?”

The group of guards were also overjoyed and said, “Thank you very much, Second Miss!”

The woman smiled slightly and nodded her head to give a signal. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Her gaze inadvertently looked over toward the woman at the rear, a hint of disdain showing at the corners of her mouth.

That woman was weak as a willow, her spirit appearing slightly haggard. But in terms of looks, it was several points above that second miss.

Toward the second miss’ display, the girl did not express much. Clearly, she was indifferent by favor or disgrace.

Suddenly, her brows knitted, and she suddenly drew the reins of her horse and turned off the main road.

When the second miss saw this, she frowned and berated, “Liang Wanru, what are you going to do1?”

The girl ignored her and got down her horse, entering into the grassy growth.

In the thicket, there was a man covered in wounds and scars, too ghastly to look at.

The woman frowned hard, her face revealing a look of lament.

She turned around and beckoned to the middle-aged guard. That guard was just about to move, but then he heard the second miss said coldly, “Zhang Shun, you’re not to go! A dead man, bring along for what? If she wants to take alone, let her carry him over herself.”

Zhang Shun hesitated for a bit, and finally still retreated to one side, and did not go over.

Liang Wanru sighed slightly and actually really took it upon herself to go and support that ‘dead man.’

The ‘dead man’ was not very heavy. But there were dried bloodstains all over his body. He had already basked under the blazing sun for god knows how many days, with his body emitting waves of unbearable smell.

The ‘dead man’ was none other than precisely the Ye Yuan who escaped with his life by a fluke from inside the spatial storm!

He was naturally not really dead, but he was also not far from death.

Ye Yuan did not have an intact spot from head to toe. The skin and flesh on his body were turned out, scorched under the blazing sun for quite a long time, giving off a nasty smell.

Even with the Tyrant Dragon Regeneration Art, it was also unable to recover the injuries on his body.

Moreover, Ye Yuan did not have a trace of essence energy undulation from head to toe at this time; he was no different from a mortal and was just left with one last breath.

Continuing to bask under this blazing sun, this final breath probably would not be ensured anymore as well.

Liang Wanru endured the stench on Ye Yuan’s body and carried him onto a carriage.

On the carriage was full of goods giving off a faint medicinal fragrance.

But Ye Yuan was completely oblivious at this time, allowing Liang Wanru to fiddle as she pleased.

The second miss slowly came to the carriage’s side. Looking at the Ye Yuan lying on the carriage dead to the world, her brows involuntarily knitted together tightly.

Liang Wanru’s ethereal and refined body was also made very messy by Ye Yuan at this time.

But she did not seem to mind.

“Heh, my good elder sister, even though this person is still hanging in there with one last breath, he’s already no different from a dead person. Our trip hasn’t been too smooth. Aren’t you adding more to the disarray by bringing him along? Let me tell you, if we run into any dangers in the Myriad Beast Forest, nobody will care about his life and death!” the second miss said coldly.

Liang Wanru did not speak and actually used her hand to gesture something.

This beautiful Liang Wanru was actually a mute!

The second miss clearly understood Liang Wanru’s hand gesture. With a look of disgust on her face, she said with a cold snort, “Saving a life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda? My good elder sister, are you feigning a heart of gold again? Yeah, you’re a living bodhisattva, we’re all heinous sinners! Huhu,

with the way he looks, you got to save him first before talking! This stinky man’s divine sea is damaged, and his fleshy body has already suffered irreversible damage. Even if Elder Fan is here, he’s also powerless to turn the tables!”

Liang Wanru’s expression dimmed, giving Ye Yuan a sympathetic glance. Suddenly, she fished out a bright red medicinal pill and was going to give Ye Yuan to consume.

The second miss’s gaze turned intent, and she looked at Liang Wanru in disbelief as she said, “Are you mad? This Profound Essence Pill is a high-grade Tier 1 divine pill. It’s a relic that Father left for you. You actually want to take it out to save a person who has nothing to do with you? When we go back, I must tell this matter to Father!”

Not just the second miss, even those guards’ faces also revealed a look of astonishment.

High-grade Tier 1 divine pill, each one was incomparably precious.

They, these guards, could not afford it even if they bankrupted themselves!

Liang Wanru looked at her and smiled slightly, but did not hesitate in the slightest, stuffing that Profound Essence Pill into Ye Yuan’s mouth.

She brought over some water for Ye Yuan to drink, guiding the medicinal pill in.

When the second miss saw this scene, she snorted coldly and said, “Liang Wanru, it’s fine that you yourself are a good-for-nothing. But now, you still want to bring along a good-for-nothing! We’re not here to sightsee. If we really encounter any danger, nobody will care about you guys!”

Liang Wanru looked at her and still smiled slightly.

This smile was like a spring breeze blowing past, warming people’s hearts.

Except, it could not warm the second miss’ heart.

The group of people continued on their way. No one bothered with Liang Wanru and Ye Yuan at all.

Clearly, Liang Wanru was a marginalized figure.

However, Liang Wanru did not complain about anything, taking the utmost care of Ye Yuan along the way.

She endured the stench and helped Ye Yuan clean up the rotten flesh on his body, helping him clean his wounds.

Apart from that Profound Essence Pill, Liang Wanru took out some more medicinal pills, giving Ye Yuan to eat every other two days.

Seeing this scene, the second miss, Liang Wanrong, just watched differently, with a look of disdain.

She and Liang Wanru were biological sisters. It was just that Liang Wanru was born of the legal wife, while she was a concubine’s child.

Their father, Liang Mingyu, loved Liang Wanru’s mother very much and treated Liang Wanru very well as well. But Liang Wanru suffered many setbacks in life. Her mother passing away prematurely, and she was innately unable to talk.

Later on, Liang Mingyu remarried. That was how there was Liang Wanrong.

Liang Wanrong’s mother was another large family clan’s daughter in Jewelhill City. Marrying Liang Mingyu was marrying to someone of a lower status, and she had always been very domineering in the Liang Family.

Liang Wanrong mother and daughter found Liang Wanru displeasing to the eye no matter how they looked at her, so they caused her hardship in all manners.

Liang Mingyu lacked power and could only turn a blind eye to this.

Fortunately, he had some conscience and compensated his eldest daughter a little in private. That was how it let Liang Wanru have an easier time.

The Liang Family was in the medicinal herbs business. This time, the two daughters were sent to import a batch of medicinal herbs. At this time, it was already on the way back.

When Liang Wanrong saw her elder sister’s busy appearance, suddenly, a wicked thought lingered in her heart and did not go away for a long time.

At this time, it had already been over ten days since Liang Wanru saved Ye Yuan.

Under her meticulous care, Ye Yuan finally woke up from his coma.
