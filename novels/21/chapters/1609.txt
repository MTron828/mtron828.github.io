Chapter 1613 So-called Genius

Ye Yuan opened the furnace very leisurely, retrieved the pill. Naturally, Gu Han was shocked, not daring to believe it.

“D-Divine-grade! How is this possible!” Gu Han said in shock.

“Why can’t it be possible?” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Gu Han pointed at Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill and said, “You’re just a Three-star Alchemy God, so how can it be possible to refine a divine-grade Unbosom Immortal Cloud Pill?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since it’s a rank three divine pill, why can’t a Three-star Alchemy God refine divine-grade? You can’t do it. It’s just because your cultivation is lacking.”

Gu Han was rendered speechless. His expression flickered non-stop and he gritted his teeth and said, “I don’t accept it! L-Let’s compete again!”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said coolly, “Alright, your turn to choose this time then.”

Gu Han gritted his teeth and said, “I want to compete in the Mystic Moon Qi Condensing Pill with you!”

Mystic Moon Qi Condensing Pill was Gu Han’s current maximum ability.

If categorizing it according to difficulty, it should belong to peak level six.

With Gu Han’s present ability, even refining low-grade was only through brute force and with difficulty.

But at this time, he already could not care.

Compared to other geniuses, Gu Han’s age was already considered very young. Till this date, he was also merely 500 to 600 years old.

But today, he was completely defeated by someone at the same rank who was less than 300 years old. He could not endure this grievance.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I even thought that you’d pick some level seven difficulty. I didn’t expect that choosing here and there, it’s still level six. Forget it, don’t need you to refine either. You just watch by the side. When I finish refining, if you feel that you can surpass me, then it’s not too late to make a move then.”

Gu Han was so angry!

He had never been underestimated by someone like this before since he became famous in River Eternal Imperial City until now.

Ye Yuan’s words were clearly despising that his pill refinement speed was slow!

A sense of humiliation rose in Gu Han’s heart.

These few days, he virtually swept across all the way, sweeping away Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s young geniuses.

Now, it was his turn.

But before waiting for him to agree, Ye Yuan already started refining the pill.

The more Gu Han watched at one side, the more alarmed he got. He was utterly dumbfounded by Ye Yuan’s alchemy skills. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A Three-star Alchemy God could really do it to this extent?

The dull and boring pill refinement actually became beautiful in Ye Yuan’s hands, making people have the jubilation of comprehending Great Dao.

There was actually still this kind of performance?

Gu Han finally understood it. He was not in the same order of magnitude with Ye Yuan at all!

An hour passed in a flash. When Ye Yuan successfully condensed the pill, Gu Han could not even quite dare to believe his own eyes.

A peak level six difficulty medicinal pill, he actually only needed an hour and it was done?

How in the world did this guy do it?

Ye Yuan was not long-winded, directly opening the furnace.

Gu Han looked at the divine-grade Mystic Moon Qi Condensing Pill, his eyeballs almost popping out.

“Well? If you can refine a void spirit divine-grade Mystic Moon Qi Condensing Pill, I’ll admit defeat,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

When Gu Han heard, the corners of his mouth could not refrain from twitching heavily.

Void spirit divine-grade?

You’re messing with me, right?!

“Hahaha, my Lord Gu Han, weren’t you very cocky just now? Continue being cocky then!”

“My Lord Gu Han, didn’t you claim that my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City has no one?”

“My Lord Gu Han, now, you’re defeated. Who will your River Eternal Imperial City be sending over?”

“Hey, you lost. Quickly bow to our Elder Ye!”

“What genius?! What undefeatable in the same rank?! In front of Elder Ye, all are trash!”

...

The onlookers eating melon seeds had long been unable to hold it in, all erupting at this time.

They called ‘my Lord Gu Han’ again and again, speaking sarcastically to the extreme.

Holding back for a month, they could finally hold their heads up high now!

Originally, comparing notes and sparring among young geniuses, this was no big deal.

But this Gu Han was too tyrannical. People lost and they still had to bow, and even call him Lord Gu Han.

Him acting like that, it would be weird if the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s people could be happy.

At this time, if they did not give Gu Han hell, then when would they wait until?

Ye Yuan looked at Gu Han and said with a smile, “What’s the meaning of not talking? Is this not admitting defeat? River Eternal Imperial City’s young genius is merely thus!”

Gu Han’s entire person was dazed at this time and had yet to react to Ye Yuan’s identity of elder.

There was not only Gu Han alone present, but there were also still several of his senior apprentice brothers.

At this time, a youth holding a sword slowly walked out of the crowd, his gaze scorching as he looked at Ye Yuan and said, “This brother, I wonder what they are calling you Elder Ye for?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Calling me elder is naturally because I’m a Pill Tower elder.”

The faces of the youth holding the sword and Gu Han changed, their eyes full of shock.

In front of so many people, it was naturally impossible for Ye Yuan to lie.

Then, this young man before their eyes was actually really an elder of the Pill Tower?

Too ridiculous, right?

After the shock, the youth holding the sword gave a bow to Ye Yuan and said, “Since you’re a Pill Tower elder, coming forward to deal with my junior apprentice brother now seems to be somewhat bullying the weak as the strong, right?”

Ye Yuan looked at the youth grasping the sword and said coolly, “If your junior apprentice brother has my strength, he can naturally become an elder too. The crux isn’t my identity but strength! Didn’t he say that he wanted to challenge Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s geniuses? This Ye is untalented. Touching my heart and examining my conscience, I should be considered of the same age as your junior apprentice brother. Our realms are similar too, so it shouldn’t be bullying the weak as the strong, right?”

Ye Yuan’s words made the two people choke.

Yeah, Ye Yuan relied on his strength to become an elder.

But in reality, Ye Yuan was just the same age as them, even younger than them!

Him coming to accept the challenge, nobody could say any complaint.

The sword-grasping youth said in a solemn voice, “No matter what, Elder Ye’s status is also put there and originally shouldn’t join in our junior generation’s sparring.”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching as he said, “Then your meaning is, only you guys are allowed to win, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City isn’t allowed to win?”

The sword-grasping youth had an embarrassed look. He discovered that this Elder Ye did not seem easy to deal with.

However, Gu Han was young and aggressive. Ye Yuan’s words deeply triggered him.

His head heated up and he said in a clear voice, “Elder Ye, is it? I admit that you’re of the same age as me, I also admit that I can’t match up to your Alchemy Dao! But I’m still unconvinced! To me, Alchemy Dao is merely auxiliary, while Martial Dao is the right path! Elder Ye, this Gu is untalented and wants to challenge Elder Ye! I wonder if you dare to accept the challenge?!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces revealed odd looks.

If it were before, they naturally felt that Ye Yuan could not beat Gu Han.

But now, Ye Yuan was known as the Martial Tower’s number one person!

Two years ago, he became the one and only martial artist capable of coming out of the spatial inheritance.

Such monstrous talent, who could compare?

This Gu Han, really giving up until he reached the Yellow River, not shedding tears until he saw the coffin!

The sword-grasping youth also said coolly, “Elder Ye, a so-called genius should be exceptional in both alchemy and martial arts! Since you’re Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s elder, I presume that you also have some achievements in martial arts. If you can defeat my junior apprentice brother in martial arts too, we’ll naturally be wholeheartedly convinced!”

Gu Han said, “Elder Ye, if you can best me in martial arts too, I’ll kowtow to you three times!”

Ye Yuan gave these two people a glance and said helplessly, “Since you guys said so, then this elder will accept deferentially than to decline courteously.”
