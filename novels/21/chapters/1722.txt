Chapter 1726 Epiphany

“As I said before, as long as Senior can help me find my loved ones, I’m willing to pay any price. What does this small matter count for?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Jian Hongxiao smiled and said, “Little Friend is really someone who values relationships. Since that’s the case, then let’s start! But ... this old man doesn’t have full assurance either. I can only say I’ll try my best.”

Ye Yuan’s expression turned somber and he suddenly became a little nervous as he said, “Senior just do your best, and that will do. Ye Yuan is endlessly grateful.”

Ye Yuan knew that regardless of success or failure, Jian Hongxiao would definitely suffer Heavenly Dao’s backlash.

Just this alone, he owed Jian Hongxiao a massive favor.

Jian Hongxiao nodded his head and said, “Come with me.”

Finished talking, Jian Hongxiao went with his hands behind his back, turning around and entering the inner-room.

Ye Yuan hurriedly got up and also followed in.

Upon entering the door, Ye Yuan seemed to have arrived at a mysterious world again.

Inside here, gave him a feeling of stirring up the soul.

In the center was a massive Tai Ji diagram, Yin and Yang blended together on the Tai Ji diagram.

All around, Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Zhen, Xun, Gen, Dui, the eight positions were clearly marked.

The Tai Ji diagram revolved on its own, giving birth to rays of soft light, filling the entire space.

It was as if this space was derived from the diagram.

Regarding the Tai Ji diagram, Ye Yuan was not foreign to it.

Back then, when he was still in the Immortal Grove World, he had once refined a pill with Great Dao. It condensed a Tai Ji diagram at that time.

This Tai Ji diagram was extremely profound. The feeling that it gave Ye Yuan was as if it was chaos.

His own Great Dao pill refinement condensing a Tai Ji diagram, this derivation of heaven’s secrets similarly used the Tai Ji diagram.

Could it be that there was some connection between the two?

For a moment, Ye Yuan’s mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts and ideas, and started thinking about the origin of Great Dao.

Very clearly, there was a hint of vague connection between the Tai Ji diagram and Heavenly Dao.

Very soon, Ye Yuan entered a mysterious kind of state.

“Little Friend, what are you standing outside the Tai Ji Eight Diagrams, ruminating quiet- ...”

Jian Hongxiao’s words were said halfway when he discovered that Ye Yuan walked toward the Tai Ji Eight Diagrams. He could not help getting a big shock.

He wanted to pull him, but it was already too late.

“Can’t enter ...”

Jian Hongxiao’s words were said halfway when his eyes suddenly opened wide, looking at this scene in disbelief.

This Tai Ji Eight Diagrams was set up in his heyday. It contained his lifetime’s understanding of Heavenly Dao.

Even if Celestial Deity Realm martial artists entered inside, they would also be seriously injured and vomit blood from being unable to withstand Great Dao’s pressure.

However, Ye Yuan actually leaped in just like that and entered effortlessly.

Ye Yuan stood in the center of the Tai Ji diagram, both eyes tightly shut. It was as if he was oblivious to outside things.

Jian Hongxiao’s gaze revealed a look of shock as he said, “This kid ... had an epiphany? His understanding of Heavenly Dao actually already reached such a degree?”

Jian Hongxiao was incomparably shocked in his heart. One had to know, he studied for a million years before he had his present accomplishments.

How old was Ye Yuan?

Suddenly, Ye Yuan started moving.

It was only to see Ye Yuan hold a ball with body hands, the shape of the Tai Ji image condensed and formed in front of him.

Then, Ye Yuan’s two arms started to wave rhythmically. That Tai Ji picture also started to slowly turn.

This tempo was akin to the scene of his Great Dao pill refinement back then.

Jian Hongxiao’s entire body trembled and he cried out, “Great Dao pill refinement! He’s deducing Alchemy Dao! This kid ... his Alchemy Dao actually already reached such a boundary, truly inconceivable!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

For Jian Hongxiao to be able to derive such a profound Tai Ji Eight Diagrams, his horizons were far from what the average Celestial Deity Realm could compare to.

Ye Yuan Tai Ji image had the ingenuity of achieving the same goal via different means with his Tai Ji picture but was also greatly different.

What Ye Yuan walked was the alchemy path, while what he walked was the profound path. The two were poles apart but also arrived at the same goal through different means.

The moment Ye Yuan saw the Tai Ji picture, it immediately made his Alchemy Dao produce a resonance, letting him enter the state of sudden epiphany.

Back then, Ye Yuan performed Great Dao pill refinement in the Immortal Grove World. But that did not mean that he could still refine pills with Great Dao when he reached the Heavenspan World.

There was a huge difference between the Immortal Grove World and Heavenspan World.

After Ye Yuan reached the Heavenspan World, even though his Alchemy Dao strength advanced by leaps and bounds, he was also still unable to reach the level of Great Dao pill refinement.

Presently, after seeing this Tai Ji picture, he finally reached it.

Jian Hongxiao was incomparably shocked in his heart. He knew that alchemists that could refine pills with Great Dao in the Heavenspan World could be counted on one hand.

Those people were all existences whose fame shook the Heavenspan World.

Even transcendent Heavenly Emperors had to be polite and courteous in front of them too.

Of course, all of those people were old monsters who had lived for no idea how many years.

Ye Yuan, this young man who was less than a thousand years, actually already reached such a level, how could he not be shocked?

After the shock, Jian Hongxiao was wildly elated in his heart!

Under Ye Yuan’s deduction, that Tai Ji picture started to gradually become solid from the initial illusoriness, and also became more and more profound.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan’s two arms pulled back, the Tai Ji image dissipated into nothing.

He slowly opened both eyes, his face revealing a delighted smile.

After Dao Realm, his Alchemy Dao had been unable to make breakthroughs.

Now, he finally got his wish.

He looked at Jian Hongxiao and said slightly apologetically, “Senior, really sorry about it. This junior barged inside involuntarily when I saw this Tai Jia picture.”

Jian Hongxiao waved his hand and said with a big laugh, “This old man finally knows what kind of heaven-defying existence emperor surmounting aura is! Hahaha ... Little Friend, you really broadened this old man’s horizons! Great Dao pill refinement! This old man lived to this ripe old age, but it’s still my first time seeing it! Truly impressive!”

Ye Yuan slowly walked out of the Tai Ji diagram and said with a smile, “Alchemy Dao is too fleeting and ephemeral, this junior has been wanting to find a breakthrough these few years, but I didn’t expect to break through here. Speaking of which, this junior owes you another big favor.”

Jian Hongxiao stroked his beard and said with a smile, “This old man doesn’t dislike your favors, the more the merrier, hahaha. Alright, enough nonsense, let’s get started! You go sit on that mat and write their names on the papers on the desk. This old man will infer for you.”

Beside the Tai Ji diagram, a mat and a desk were placed there.

On the desk, there was a cinnabar pen and several pieces of paper placed.

Ye Yuan walked over and wrote several names on the paper: Yue Mengli, White Light, Lu-er, and Fiery.

Jian Hongxiao slowly walked into the Tai Ji diagram, sat down cross-legged in the center, and opened his mouth to say, “In a while, this old man will divine them one by one. Whoever’s name lights up, you silently read their name, understood?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, appearing slightly nervous as he said, “Understood!”

Experiencing many grand spectacles, Ye Yuan had always kept a straight face and a steady heartbeat.

But now, he was very nervous.

He was very worried. If by chance someone among the four of them suffered an accident, how should he face it?

Ye Yuan could kill all the powerful enemies in the world and could be crushed into dust. Only toward the people around him that it was hard for him to let it go.

Jian Hongxiao seemed to have seen through his nervousness and said with a smile, “It’s a blessing if not a calamity; if it’s a calamity, it can’t be avoided. Your destiny is overwhelming, so the people around you will naturally also have fortune shine on them. Them leaving you might not be a bad thing.”
