Chapter 1558 Drag Over Here for Me

At the Pill Tower, the proud looking Wu Feng appeared very respectful in front of this slightly fat old man.

“How has Master been?” Wu Feng bowed down deeply.

This old man was the Pill Tower’s high-level deacon, a middle-stage Four-star Alchemy God, Deercry.

Deercry was considered a senior deacon in the Pill Tower. His disciples spread all over the inner and outer city.

Wu Feng was one of his disciples.

As a disciple of the Pill Tower, Wu Feng naturally had the authority to enter the inner city.

Regarding this disciple, Deercry was still quite satisfied.

Although his talent was a little poor, having no hopes of breaking through to Four-star Alchemy God, he was at least very filial to Deercry and very sensible.

Such a person building his own influence in the outer city seemed to be a pretty good choice.

“Mn, you had a good intention. What ... interesting thing that you bring again this time?” Deercry said coolly.

Wu Feng pulled out a jade flask and handed it to Deercry respectfully and said fawningly, “Master, this is an Iceheart Jade Flask that this disciple obtained recently. It’s incomparably delicious.

Deercry took it and opened the flask lid. An enticing aroma instantly filled the room.

Deercry’s eyes lit up and he praised, “Fine wine! Fine wine! You had the heart!”

Wu Feng’s heart was dripping blood. One should not look at how this flask was not bit. It cost him several tens of millions of divine essence stones to buy it.

A tiny flask of wine, the price was comparable to the consultation fee for treating Huang Qian’s illness!

Deercry was a Four-star Alchemy God, so how could the things that could move him be ordinary items?

Each time he entered the inner city, Wu Feng would rack his brains.

Just as the Thunderclap Gang showed him filial respect, the tribute that he offered up to Deercry each time similarly cost a lot.

But with Deercry’s support, the divine essence stones that he earned every year was also an astronomical figure.

No loss!

Even the Dongfang Family did not dare to be disrespectful toward him.

Deercry put away the jade flask, gave Wu Feng a glance, and said coolly, “Did you ... run into some problems recently?”

Wu Feng smiled and said, “Master can see through everything! Recently, a junior appeared in the south city. He simply has no respect for anyone, incomparably arrogant! He actually dares to claim to grant all requests, turning the south city upside down!”

Deercry raised his eyelids slightly and said with a smile, “It’s that little medicine shop called Miracle Hand Parlor, right? Will grant all requests! Heh heh, I also heard about it. Truly high-sounding sentiments!”

Wu Feng hurriedly said, “Master has no idea! This punk’s tone is more than big, it’s simply huge without borders! Does Master remember a patient that I brought back then, even Master couldn’t find the cause of the illness?”

Deercry thought about it for a moment and said in shock, “You’re talking about that living dead person? Is it possible that ... that punk actually found it?”

Wu Feng nodded and said, “Heh, this punk blindly stumbled upon it and he actually really cured him!”

Deercry’s shock was by no means insignificant. A cause that even he could not find out, a Three-star Alchemy God actually cured it?

His gaze turned intent and he said in a solemn voice, “Then it looks like this brat really has some ability!”

Wu Feng was delighted inwardly, aware that his master was already somewhat unhappy. Immediately, he said with a cold smile, “Ability my *ss! He merely stumbled upon it blindly! What’s even more infuriating is that that subordinate of mine actually sold you out, saying that his nephew had once been treated by Master Deercry before and didn’t even find any problem. You guess what that kid said?”

Deercry’s gaze turned cold and he said in a low voice, “This seat doesn’t like to play this kind of guessing game! Speak!”

Wu Feng hurriedly put on an incomparably indignant front and said, “Yes, Master! That hateful brat actually said ‘Is this Master Deercry very amazing? A Four-star Alchemy God is also merely so!’ Don’t you find it infuriating?”

Wu Feng gave embellishment to it, angering Deercry until he turned livid with rage.

Bang!

The tea table beside Deercry directly shattered into dust.

The flesh on his face was convulsing. It could be seen how furious he was.

“A mere Three-star Alchemy God actually dared to utter such wild ravings! Could it be that ... you’re going to let them carry on surviving?” Deercry’s gaze was sharp as he stared at Wu Feng and said coldly.

Wu Feng put on an appearance of being bullied and said, “Master is unjust! How could I let this punk defile master like so? At that time, I sent people to go smash the Miracle Hand Parlor. Who knew that this Miracle Hand Parlor’s foundation is deep and found a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse from no idea where. Disciple ... Disciple really isn’t a match!”

Divine Lord Realm’s gaze turned cold and he said icily, “Just a Divine Lord Realm and he dares to vilify a Pill Tower’s senior, humph! This seat wants to see how hard their bones are!”

Deercry slowly got up, summoned a middle-aged man, and said in a solemn voice, “Tang Rui, take a trip with Wu Feng. Tear down that whatever Miracle Hand Parlor for me! Drag that punk called Ye Yuan here for me! As for that Divine Lord Realm, send him to the Martial Tower with interfering in the outer city’s affairs as the reason!”

Tang Rui bowed and said, “Yes, Lord Deacon!”

...

Hearing Huang Qian’s words, Ye Yuan sighed too, while Ning Siyu and Liang Wanru two people were extremely indignant.

“This Wu Feng is simply inhumane! Saved him before that it’s a big deal? He can be so unscrupulous and unbridled? A-Angering this young lady to death!” Ning Siyu was enraged until her chest heaved up and down, almost about to rush out to take revenge for Huang Qian.

“Big Brother Ye, this Wu Feng is indeed too infuriating. Their uncle and nephew two people were loyal and staunch. But in the end, they got this kind of ending. You have to stand up for them!” Liang Wanru also said.

Ye Yuan patted Huang Qian’s shoulder and opened his mouth to say, “My condolences. Don’t think so much first, stay here first and heal your injuries before talking.”

Huang Qian was stunned, his eyes revealing a look of despair.

If even Master Ye did not care, then he would really have no hope of taking revenge.

Wu Feng’s power in the south city was not something he could shake.

“M-Many thanks, Master Ye!” Huang Qian gritted his teeth and answered.

After Huang Qian left, the two ladies’ gazes when looking at Ye Yuan was full of unhappiness. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Ye Yuan, I really misjudged you! Didn’t expect that you’re so cowardly and afraid of getting into trouble!” Ning Siyu had an appearance that abhorred evil as if it were her enemy as she said.

“Big Brother Ye, are you really the Big Brother ye that I know? That Huang Qian is already so tragic, you actually don’t even help him!” Liang Wanru questioned Ye Yuan for the first time.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Didn’t I already take him in? How else do you want me to help him?”

“You ... Shouldn’t you go and capture that Wu Feng to bow his head and admit his guilt in front of Huang Qian?” Ning Siyu said indignantly.

Ye Yuan smiled, but did not answer Ning Siyu, and went out the door.

His attitude angered Ning Siyu until she stomped her feet and said, “Hey, what’s with your attitude?! A-Angering this young lady to death! This young lady wants to break off all relations with you!”

Ye Yuan was just about to go out the door when a benevolent-looking old man entered the Miracle Hand Parlor.

“May I ask if Master Ye is around?” said that old man.

Ye Yuan glanced at him rather surprisedly. He actually could not fathom the other party’s depths.

Could it be ... another Divine Lord Realm powerhouse?

“I’m Ye Yuan. I wonder why is Senior looking for this Ye?” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

When the old man saw that Ye Yuan was so young, he could not help getting a huge shock and said, “This old man is Xuan Yu from the Pill Tower. I heard that Master Ye is an alchemy expert, so I purposely came to compare notes with you, exchanging views.”
