Chapter 1443 Well Within Reach!

The result did not give the least bit of surprise. That elder was similarly burned to a crisp!

Swish!

Another fireball condensed and formed. It was just that the target this time was a Grotto Profound martial artist beside Ye Yuan.

Seeing this scene, Qin Tian’s face revealed a look of wild elation.

Although this fireball was not targeting Ye Yuan, to be able to make their side suffer heavy casualties, he was happy too.

Weren’t you doing unnecessary stuff?

Screwed your own people, right?!

Seeing the fireball draw near, that Grotto Profound martial artist was instantly drenched in sweat.

He was just about to take off and run when a voice sounded out beside his ear.

“Don’t resist, I’ll bring you to a safe place.”

This voice was simply like a heavenly melody, incomparably wonderful.

He only felt a blur before his eyes and a figure already pulled him along and escaped into the yellow light.

This action of Ye Yuan, he seemingly stepped on a land mine, triggering more and more fireballs to follow on their tails.

“Hahaha, you wouldn’t die if you didn’t look for trouble! Ye Yuan, let me see how you escape!” Qin Tian laughed wildly as he said with excitement.

But Ye Yuan paid no attention to it, bringing that person and teleporting, and actually scurried straight into that fireball!

When that Grotto Profound martial artist saw the fireball brush past his cheek, all the hair on his body stood on its end. He only felt his crotch become wet. He was actually scared until he peed.

At this time, everyone was watching Ye Yuan’s action.

The miraculous thing was that when he shuttled back and forth between the fireballs, not a single fireball actually touched him!

Qin Tian’s smile became stiffer and stiffer, finally freezing on his face.

Ye Yuan moved like the wind, changing no idea how many positions.

Suddenly, that Grotto Profound martial artist only felt a blur before his eyes. All of the fireballs vanished without a trace!

“Stay here and don’t move! Otherwise, an immortal can’t save you either!” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

“O-Oh!” That Grotto Profound martial artist nodded his head mechanically, only then, coming to a realization.

Just now, Ye Yuan brought him like dancing on the edge of a knife. That taste was really awesome.

“Four steps away, add three steps ...”

Inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, Dustless was currently swiftly explaining to him the footwork.

This grand array was incomparably profound. It was likely personally arranged by Celestial Deity Sky Foothill. With Ye Yuan’s current realm, it was naturally impossible to crack it.

But, he still had Dustless, this senior with vast experiences, along with him.

The moment this grand array activated he recognized this array formation.

This array formation was called the Flame Wandering Universe Grand Array of the Eight Desolates. It was a Five-star Divine Dao grand array, and its power was boundless.

But the grand array in front of him was clearly less than one-ten-thousandth of its peak.

Otherwise, these people in front would long have died out.

The instant when Ye Yuan saw the rest, he knew what was going to happen.

This was probably a plot set up by Celestial Deity Sky Foothill, wanting to replenish the continuously weakening Dao Fruit with the fresh blood of Deity Realm powerhouses.

Hence, that was why everyone would be transported here.

Very soon, Ye Yuan returned to his original position, grabbing Bai Chen and directly flying away.

He did the same, sending all of the White Night Sacred Palace’s people to a safe place.

Qin Tian and Duan Fei’s expressions were ugly to the extreme. This grand array was so powerful, but only Ye Yuan alone could come and go freely. This was not good news!

Duan Fei looked towards Qin Tian and said coldly, “Still don’t think of a way, we’d all have to die here! Aren’t you all outsiders very powerful? Why are you so useless?”

Qin Tian was livid with rage and said in a deep voice, “I told you long ago, this brat has precious treasures on him! This array formation’s rank is extremely high. If its power wasn’t significantly diminished, we’d have long died out!”

Duan Fei snorted coldly and said, “This doesn’t change the fact that you’re useless too!”

Qin Tian said angrily, “If you have any use, rush the formation for me to see!”

The two people were currently arguing when two fireballs flew over towards them.

The two people’s expressions changed, attacking brazenly at the same time!

Boom!

Boom!

Those two fireballs were actually directly annihilated!

However, their faces did not have the slightest expression of joy. Because this kind of attack consumed too much divine essence.

They could block one, two, but once the grand array activated, it would not stop. How many could they block?

“Heh, strength is all pretty good! After I retrieve the Dao Fruit, I’ll come and settle scores with you guys again!” Ye Yuan looked at this scene and said with a cold laugh.

Finished talking, his figure moved, and actually moved in the direction of the Dao Fruit.

Qin Tian’s entire body trembled, his gaze full of unwillingness.

Watching Ye Yuan draw closer to the Dao Fruit step by step, Qin Tian could not endure it anymore, his entire body’s aura skyrocketing.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, looking over in Qin Tian’s direction in surprise.

“Ye Yuan, you forced me! Today, I’ll definitely kill you! Want to obtain the Dao Fruit? Dream on!”

Qin Tian shouted fiercely. His hand had an additional ice cube-like object.

A powerful spiritual energy undulation instantly swept across the entire dome.

“It’s Ten Thousand Year Mystic Crystal! This small piece of Ten Thousand Year Mystic Crystal is sufficient for him to break through to the Origin Deity Realm! This guy actually still had such a thing in his hands!” Dustless said in surprise.

Boom!

Qin Tian’s aura released fully. An overwhelming pressure instantly enveloped the entire place.

He was going to break through to the Origin Deity Realm!

“I’ve been suppressing my realm all along in order to comprehend Sword Dao! Today, for your sake, I’m going to break through to the Origin Deity Realm! You can be proud of this!”

Qin Tian laughed ominously, swallowing the Ten Thousand Year Mystic Crystal in one go.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. The speed of his feet accelerated, speeding over towards the Dao Fruit.

Qin Tian’s aura was in the midst of rising crazily. Finally, he made his move and stepped right into the grand array.

Whoosh!

A fireball shot straight for Qin Tian.

Qin Tian did not even look, a sword directly flying out.

Boom!

That fireball was directly annihilated.

With the support of the Ten Thousand Year Mystic Crystal, Qin Tian did not care about the consumption of divine essence within his body at all.

Actually, with Qin Tian’s talent, he could have broken through to the Origin Deity Realm long ago.

These few years, he had been suppressing and not breaking through all along in order to comprehend Sword Dao in the Sword Tomb.

As the saying went, thick accumulations burst forth. Him breaking through to the Origin Deity Realm now was virtually something that happened without extra effort.

Breaking through this sort of thing was all too easy for a genius like Qin Tian.

Duan Fei had a visible change in countenance watching by the side. He finally knew the disparity between him and Qin Tian, this kind of trial-takers.

Back then, he spent a full 50 thousand year’s time in order to break through to the Origin Deity Realm!

But he broke through so casually.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Qin Tian drew his sword like the wind, obliterating all of the fireballs that the grand array condensed.

Ye Yuan’s footwork was walking in a roundabout manner.

While Qin Tian walked straight ahead in the direction of the Dao Fruit!

Very soon, Qin Tian rushed in front of Ye Yuan instead.

When Duan Fei saw the two people snatching the Dao Fruit, he finally could not hold back any longer.

“Damn it! Risk it all!”

Duan Fei gritted his teeth, figure flying out hastily, also rushing over toward the Dao Fruit.

Three figures broke through the grand array’s layers of blockade, all wanting to be the first to obtain the Dao Fruit.

However, along with them getting closer and closer to the Dao Fruit, the fireballs around them also became more and more, the power increasingly horrifying.

Qin Tian’s powerful strength was displayed in its entirety without a doubt at this moment.

His aura was still rising non-stop and already infinitely approached Origin Deity Realm. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Tian had a look of joy. The Dao Fruit was already well within reach!
