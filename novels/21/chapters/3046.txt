Chapter 3045: Pig Teammate

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s over 50 thousand people were expressionless.

Zhou Xianchen originally had the intention of sowing discord. He believed that no one would not be tempted in front of benefits.

Even if it was their Zhoutian Emperor Palace, these heavenly medicines were not his alone too.

Benefits had to be balanced out.

But very sadly, these 50 thousand people seemed to be indifferent. Not one person expressed doubt with regards to Ye Yuan’s action.

So awkward!

The stomach full of words that Zhou Xianchen prepared could not be used anymore.

“If Heavenly Saint Ye needs it, so what even if he takes these heavenly medicines? Don’t you all agree?” Gao Hushan suddenly said.

“Yes!”

“We have no objections!”

“Our lives are all Heavenly Saint Ye’s. Some heavenly medicines are not worth mentioning!”

Everyone immediately answered without hesitation.

It was not just Zhou Xianchen, Kong Tan, and Wang Ningyan who were shocked; they were all shocked.

Were these people idiots?

Or was it that these over 50 thousand people were all controlled by Ye Yuan?

But was this possible?

They were naturally unable to understand how great Ye Yuan’s prestige in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was.

These people’s lives were all saved by Ye Yuan. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was also all Ye Yuan’s credit that they could stand here.

Could these not be more valuable than a few heavenly medicines?

Moreover, Ye Yuan was famous for being selfless. Back then, when he entered the Extreme Medicine Sect, he presented all of his precious alchemy path records to the sect.

Later, he also advocated for releasing resources and benefiting everyone.

Would such a person covet some heavenly medicines?

Even if he did, that had a reason too!

At this time, Ye Yuan slowly got up and said loudly, “Everyone, I’ll pick 2000 Emperor Vast Heavens out of you all and refine the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill for you all, and help you all break through to Emperor Sakra Heaven! Also, I’ll refine Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill for 300 Emperor Sakra Heavens and help you all comprehend origin! Apart from this, another portion of heavenly medicines is prepared for those mutated bloodline warriors that follow me.”

Although the heavenly pills here were abundant, being able to support two to three hundred people was already the limit.

After all, no matter how many the grade eight heavenly medicines, they were not cabbages too.

An Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill was the best heavenly pill to assault Emperor Sakra Heaven.

It was just that the heavenly medicines that this pill required were extremely seldom-seen in the outside world. Hence, it was very precious too.

Previously, those Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses were also mostly requesting Zhou Xianchen they all to refine this pill.

But the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill was a grade eight imperial pill. It could help martial artists attain clarity of mind and increase the chances of comprehending origin.

To an Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouse, it was an extremely precious grade eight heavenly imperial pill.

Of course, the difficulty was also hell level.

“Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill??Hur hur,?Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven this sort of place, there’s someone who can refine the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill too? Kid, bragging isn’t done like this!” Chu Fang said with a disdainful look.

“Even if he refines it, it will most likely be a useless pill too! Ye Yuan, I’ll give you one last chance; 2000 stalks of heavenly medicines! This Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill, I’ll refine to origin grade for you!” Zhou Xianchen also said.

The refining difficulty of the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill was extremely high. Even origin grade powerhouses would find it very hard to refine into origin grade too.

In Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, only Cloudmount master and disciples, three people, were able to refine this pill.

The others, even if they were origin realm grade nine heavenly alchemists, they could not refine it at all either.

Because this heavenly pill already touched upon the secrets of Hegemon!

Without reaching Hegemon Realm, how could one pry into Hegemon Realm and attain clarity of mind?

Among Zhou Xianchen, Chu Fan, and Jinnan, three people, only Zhou Xianchen had the confidence to refine it to origin grade smoothly.

This was because there was a Great Beyond powerhouse standing behind Zhou Xianchen!

In terms of foundation, his was even deeper than the other two.

“Young Master Zhou can actually refine the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill! If I had long known this, I’d have spent a huge price just now to find him to refine!”

“A miscalculation! Origin grade Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill is even a hundred times better than my Zhoutian Brightheart Pill!”

“That boy didn’t even dare to take action for three months. He clearly doesn’t have the confidence. With just his bit of strength, he also dares to pick a fight with Young Master Zhou?”

… …

The moment Zhou Xianchen opened his mouth, everyone yelled out their regrets.

Those Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses also did not expect that Zhou Xianchen could actually refine such a heaven-defying grade eight heavenly imperial pill.

Zhou Xianchen was very pleased with himself. The Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill should be the peak of Alchemy Dao below Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill.

In Martial Dao, he was worse than Yang Qing, Kong Tan, and the rest.

But regarding Alchemy Dao, he was absolutely the most high-profile focal point.

“Moron!” What answered him was Yang Qing’s nonchalant words.

Zhou Xianchen’s gaze turned cold, and he said, “What did you say?”

Yang Qing smiled and said, “I said, you’re a moron! What does Ye Yuan refining pills have to do with you? Don’t you find it funny that you’re jumping up and down here?”

Zhou Xianchen smiled coldly and said, “Yang Qing, do you really think that you’re impressive? You have to know, the consequences of offending a Great Beyond powerhouse are very serious!”

Yang Qing said disdainfully, “Screw off! You can’t do it. So you’ll be bringing out your ancestor? How old are you? Aren’t you ashamed?”

In terms of rebutting, Yang Qing did not lose to anyone.

Zhou Xianchen was angered until his face flushed red, and he shouted angrily, “I can’t do it??Hur hur,?in terms of martial arts, maybe I’m inferior to you. But in Alchemy Dao, who dares to fight with me?”

Yang Qing said coolly, “Stop bragging. Let’s make a bet. If Ye Yuan loses to you, our heavenly medicines will all be yours. However, if Ye Yuan wins against you, your Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s heavenly medicines will all be ours! Calculating it, it’s definitely you who’s in an advantageous position. Do you dare to bet or not?”

Finished speaking, Yang Qing even winked at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled. He naturally welcomed free heavenly medicines.

The reason why he shared the heavenly medicines with the other forces was also due to circumstances.

Otherwise, Ye Yuan would not be so generous either.

It was not that Zhou Xianchen could not stand being provoked. It was that he was too confident in himself.

There was a saying that was circulated in the 33 Heavens: Alchemy Dao in the world originated from the Emperor Palace!

It could be seen how strong Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s alchemy path strength was.

As the new generation’s outstanding talent, how could Zhou Xianchen possibly lose to others?

After Yang Qing said this, Zhou Xianchen calmed down instead and said with a sneer, “In Alchemy Dao, there hasn’t been an opponent that I, Zhou Xianchen, don’t dare to compete against! However, since you want to compete, then we naturally have to compete in medicinal effects! How about this? We’ll send out 2300 people too and compare the effects of the medicinal pills that we each refined. We’ll see which of us has more breakthroughs in the end! Speaking of which, this is still you all getting off cheap. The medicinal effects of the heavenly pills that I refine aren’t as good as the Hundred Fate Heavenly Aperture Pill. Do you all dare?”

Although he said so, actually, the aptitudes of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s martial artists were far worse than the other few factions.

Humanity’s three supreme heavens, this was not said for fun.

Even if it was the other races, those who came were top geniuses too.

In contrast, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s so-called geniuses were simply not enough to look at.

With Zhou Xianchen saying so, Yang Qing hesitated instead.

He naturally knew the quality of those who came from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Seeing Yang Qing’s expression, Zhou Xianchen smiled coldly and said, “Why? Don’t dare?”

“Not at all. I agree,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

A hint of cunningness flashed across Zhou Xianchen’s face, and he said with a smile, “Good, gutsy enough! This Zhou will kindly accept your heavenly medicines!”

He felt that Yang Qing was really a pig teammate, putting Ye Yuan on the fire to roast.

Now, in Zhou Xianchen’s mind, Ye Yuan had lost for sure!
