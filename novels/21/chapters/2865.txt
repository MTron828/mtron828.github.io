Chapter 2871 Delivering Heads!

The South Qi Giant City after the battle entered a rare period of peace.

On a dark night with strong wind, several figures floated into the city lord manor.

The black-clothed person asked in a solemn voice, “You are sure that Ye Yuan is in the courtyard?”

A human knelt as he said, “Yes, Master! Ye Yuan has frequently been coming in and out of Feng Xiaotian’s manor these few days. Just in the evening, this slave saw with my own eyes that Ye Yuan entered the courtyard and never came out! That large yellow bull would never leave his side. Today’s no exception either!”

The black-clothed person said with a strange laugh, “Jeje, after this boy dies, he can be sufficiently proud! In order to kill him, a measly little Saint Sovereign Heaven, our Dark Night mobilized four Emperor Vast Heavens and seven Emperor Cloud Heavens this time!”

“Master is wise! Feng Xiaotian seemed to have calculated that we’re going to ambush Ye Yuan. So he sent a Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouse to protect Ye Yuan closely,” the human said.

The man in black said with a laugh, “Heh, Feng Xiaotian calculated everything and also can’t calculate that we actually planted so many blood slaves in South Qi Giant City!”

The black-clothed person, Blueash, was an Emperor Sakra Heaven upper echelon of Dark Night!

In Dark Night, every powerhouse was extremely precious!

Each time they sent these Dark Night members into Heaven One Continent, they would have to pay a terrible price.

This was because the grand array in the cities was connected to the Absolute Heaven Barrier.

If they wanted to enter, they had to go through the cities.

Therefore, wanting to supply Dark Night, they must launch a large-scale war. Imagine how great the difficulty it was for Dark Night to break through the city protecting grand array and Heaven One army!

The blood race had clear distinctions from other races.

Although the human race was unable to imitate the blood race’s aura, it was similarly difficult for the blood race to imitate the aura of humans too.

But the blood race could plant blood marks in humans, turning them into blood slaves.

These Dark Nights gathered intelligence through one blood slave after another.

However, South Qi Giant City’s screening was extremely strict. It was very hard for blood slaves to get in.

South Qi Giant City did not have many blood slaves. In order to let these blood slaves into the city, Dark Night spent a huge amount of effort.

However, these blood slaves’ strengths were not strong, and their status was not high. They were unable to gather some core secrets.

But this time, they were finally put to use!

Blood slaves could directly summon bloodkins into the city through a special array formation, avoiding the inspection of the city protecting grand array.

Of course, they would not use this kind of method unless it was a last resort.

Once exposed, they would die without burial grounds!

Therefore, in order to kill Ye Yuan, Dark Night really put forth blood capital this time.

One Emperor Sakra Heaven, four Emperor Vast Heavens, and seven Emperor Cloud Heavens, they were just for the sake of ensuring a certain kill in one strike!

This was the full power of a hidden branch!

Blueash made a hand gesture; 11 Emperor Realm powerhouses quietly headed for the courtyard that Ye Yuan was staying at. Ye Yuan’s courtyard was quiet.

In a side room, a powerful aura covered the entire courtyard.

Blueash gave one of the Emperor Vast Heavens a wink, making them go to the side-room to tie down that Emperor Vast Heaven.

Meanwhile, the other three people would launch a certain-kill strike against Ye Yuan.

As for Blueash, he was here to let these people make a full retreat!

Although his strength was not as good as Feng Xiaotian, bringing these people and escaping after killing Ye Yuan was an easy job.

Three!

Two!

One!

“Do it!”

Blueash shouted coldly. Three great Emperor Vast Heavens immediately erupted with all their strength.

With Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses taking action, how shocking was the commotion?

Before the strike landed, the entire courtyard already turned into a pile of dust.

The Emperor Vast Heaven protecting Ye Yuan was directly bogged down.

Boom!

Blueash’s strike directly leveled the courtyard to the ground!

But in the next moment, his eyes went wide.

This was because Ye Yuan was actually standing there perfectly safe and sound!

His full-power blow actually did not even harm a hair of his!

“This … How is this possible!” Blueash said in disbelief.

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, looking at Blueash with a smile that was not a smile as he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Dark Night really made an extravagant display! One Emperor Sakra Heaven, four Emperor Vast Heavens, seven Emperor Cloud Heavens, if you all die here, Dark Night will feel great pain too, right? Wonder whether Lord Wang Zuo will stomp his feet in anger or not?”

As he talked, Ye Yuan’s appearance and aura underwent an upheaval change.

That aura even rose rapidly and actually directly reached Emperor Sakra Heaven! Blueash’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, “F-Feng Xiaotian! This is impossible! What I felt earlier was clearly … was clearly …”

“Clearly Ye Yuan’s, right?” Feng Xiaotian smiled and his fingertips bent lightly. A little void sword suspended in his palm. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The aura of that little sword was exactly the same as Ye Yuan’s!

Reaching Blueash’s realm, it was naturally impossible to identify the other party by their appearance, but it was possible through the unique aura of each person.

Each person’s Dao was different. So the aura on everyone’s body was also completely different.

Completely simulating another person’s aura, this was impossible.

But Ye Yuan could!

Before leaving, Ye Yuan forced out a wisp of Dao sword and handed it to Feng Xiaotian. This Dao sword could perfectly conceal Feng Xiaotian’s own aura and let him turn into Ye Yuan!

It was for the sake of paying them back in their own coin!

Sure enough, Blueash fell for it.

Blueash’s entire body trembled as he said in disbelief, “How … Can this be?”

For the sake of the assassination this time, he had already been doubly cautious.

He did not expect that it still fail!

He never dreamed that Ye Yuan could actually let others perfectly disguise as himself!

Just how many tricks and trump cards did this guy have?

Feng Xiaotian smiled and said, “Your current expression is exactly the same as mine back then! Huhu, since you came, stay behind!”

… …

“What in the world is going on? Who can tell me what the hell is this!”

In the Blood God Temple, came Lord Wang Zuo’s bellow.

Yes, he was furious!

The entire hidden branch was completely annihilated!

One Emperor Sakra Heaven, four Emperor Vast Heavens, seven Emperor Cloud Heavens!

In order to let these people enter Heaven One, how much price did he pay?

But now, it was directly gone!

The key thing was that Ye Yuan was not dead!

The next day, Ye Yuan swaggered around in South Qi Giant City again.

That appearance was clearly telling the blood race, I’m not dead!

Even being hundreds of millions of miles away, Wang Zuo had a feeling like he had been slapped too.

This was because the order to kill Ye Yuan was given by him!

If not for his order, it was impossible for Blueash to have moved out in full force.

But in the end, all were completely wiped out!

What was even more aggravating was that after the second day, Ye Yuan was even more arrogant until he directly went out of the city!

Furthermore, he only brought one Emperor Vast Heaven guard.

He seemed to be saying: come on, kill me!

Wang Zuo’s order had not been rescinded yet. Of course he had to be killed!

Hence, several more waves of Dark Night members came to raid Ye Yuan.

In the end, still completely annihilated!

However many came, however many died!

In a short half a month, Dark Night lost two Emperor Sakra Heavens, 20 Emperor Vast Heavens, and more than 70 Emperor Cloud Heavens!

Lord Wang Zuo was completely mad!

He had no choice but to have the chief send the order to stop the raid on Ye Yuan. This was freaking simply delivering heads!
