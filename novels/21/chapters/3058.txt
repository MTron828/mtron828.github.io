Chapter 3057: That’s How Confident!

Next to a pile of strange stones, Ye Yuan’s figure appeared.

While everyone had a look of shock, looking at this scene in disbelief.

Could it be that what Ye Yuan said was real?

They had actually all fallen into the terrifying Heaven formation and were not aware?

“Want to kill you all or not, it’s merely a matter of a single thought from me. If I want to kill, you all would be long dead. If I don’t want to kill, it’s naturally because I don’t want to kill you guys yet,” Ye Yuan looked at Zhang Hexin and the rest as he said coolly.

Shock was written all over Zhang Hexin’s face.

The six of their eyes all turned to Yun Xiang.

“Yun Xiang, what’s going on here?”

“This … This might very likely be the Heaven formation!” Among the seven people, the most shocked was naturally Yun Xiang.

Zhang Hexin’s face fell, and he said, “What’s called likely? Could it be that you, a Hegemon Realm, is actually inferior to him, an Emperor Vast Heaven?”

Yun Xiang’s face turned black, and she said in a solemn voice, “Likely means not certain. Are you stupid?”

Zhang Hexin also realized that he had somewhat lost composure.

Which Hegemon Realm did not want face? His words put Yun Xiang on the spot.

......

“Cough cough,?Younger Sister Yun Xiang, don’t get agitated. Brother Zhang is also somewhat anxious. That’s why his words were not appropriate.” At this time, another Hegemon Realm came forward to be a mediator.

Yun Xiang snorted coldly. The atmosphere seemed a little awkward.

“A grand array that even this seat can’t detect, apart from Heaven formation, I can’t think of a second one! Brat, could it be that you’ve already grasped Heaven formation?” Yun Xiang looked at Ye Yuan and said with an unfriendly expression.

In reality, Yun Xiang was extremely shocked in her heart.

Not only did Ye Yuan see through it, he even acquired the treasures.

While she, this Hegemon level heavenly formation master, actually did not even detect a trace. What a complete loss of face.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How profound is Heaven formation? How can it be grasped so easily? I just saw everyone challenging the formation and felt some changes, and then I had some comprehension. That’s all. So, do I have the qualifications to negotiate the terms with you all now?”

The seven Hegemons had black faces, all falling silent.

Clearly, it was considered to be tacitly approving.

But it was too hard for these words to come out of these Hegemon Realms’ mouths.

Ye Yuan said, “Among these treasures, I want three things, Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear, Huan Dragon Root, and this Myriad Magnetism Mountain!”

Huan Dragon Root was that chaos heavenly medicine. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Yuan naturally had no use for this.

But, to Cloudmount, this thing was a priceless treasure!

His fading life force could only be restored using chaos heavenly medicines.

But chaos heavenly medicines were extremely rare when looking across the 33 Heavens too.

Ye Yuan did not expect to see it here!

However, Cloudmount’s injuries were extremely serious. A Huan Dragon Root was far from enough.

As for whether or not he could find others, he could only try his luck.

The moment the words came out of his mouth, Zhang Hexin exploded.

Among these treasures, the most precious were the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear and Huan Dragon Root. Ye Yuan actually wanted them in one breath.

Then would they, these Hegemons, become a joke?

“Haha,?boy, you really dare to open your mouth! Do you think that we’ll agree?” Zhang Hexin laughed from extreme rage.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior, I heard that back then, the fire spirit race’s Progenitor Flamebright had a great battle with Ancestor Sevenway. In the end, he brought numerous Hegemons and inflicted heavy wounds on Ancestor Sevenway. Ancestor Sevenway knew that it was impossible to escape his doom, so he derived the Heaven formation with his essence, energy, and spirit, cutting down the fire spirit race’s progenitor inside this formation. The fire spirit race also never recovered from this setback because of this. Progenitor, Progenitor Flamebright’s ‘Sunchaser’ should still remain inside this formation, right?”

The moment these words came out, the faces of the seven great Hegemons changed!

Progenitor Flamebright was once a greatly renowned Great Beyond powerhouse.

His lifeblood treasure Sunchaser had a great reputation in all the heavens.

Sunchaser was a superior grade chaos heavenly treasure!

These treasures were utterly worthless in front of ‘Sunchaser’.

Therefore, hearing that Sunchaser might have remained inside the Heaven formation, the seven great Hegemons were no longer calm.

“Boy, what do you mean?” Zhang Hexin asked in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What I mean is, dozens of Hegemons died here. The treasures are too many to enumerate! There are still many treasures later at the back. Rather than getting entangled here, it’s better to have a longer term perspective; we cooperate to retrieve treasures!”

Zhang Hexin said disdainfully, “A mere Emperor Vast Heaven, what right do you have to cooperate with us?”

Ye Yuan said, “Based on that I can understand Heaven formation.”

Zhang Hexin could not resist looking over at Yun Xiang. The latter sneered and said, “Boy, you’re too self-confident! Since this seat knows that I’ve fallen into this formation, won’t I know to comprehend it myself? You wouldn’t think that I, this Hegemon level heavenly formation master, is someone who only knows how to eat and do nothing, right?”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said indifferently, “Sure, I’ll teach you everything that I learned. When we encounter treasures later, let’s have a fair competition, and see who comprehends it first. If I can’t match up to you, not only will I not take a single treasure, but I’ll also hand these three treasures over with both hands. What do you all think?”

“Is this for real?” The seven great Hegemons virtually said in unison.

This boy was too arrogant!

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “If I really lose, it won’t be my turn to speak anymore, isn’t it?”

The seven great Hegemons exchanged glances, all deeply feeling the same too.

As long as Yun Xiang grasped the Heaven formation, what did it still have to do with Ye Yuan?

What shocked them was that Ye Yuan was actually willing to share what he learned with Yun Xiang!

This boy was also too self-confident, right?

Being able to become a Hegemon level heavenly formation master, how could Yun Xiang’s comprehension ability be ordinary?

Did this boy really think that he could crush a Hegemon?

Ye Yuan naturally did not want to do so. But he needed to borrow these people’s strength to go and assault the Heaven formation.

Otherwise, it would be very hard for him to understand Heaven formation on his own too!

In the end, both sides reached an agreement.

Everyone present was shocked.

“This boy is really drunk with confidence! He actually doesn’t even place Hegemon Realms in his eyes!”

“Hur hur,?this is handing his life over to other people’s hands. This boy really has a unique train of thought!”

“Emperor Vast Heaven challenging a Hegemon, there’s a show to watch!”

… …

Amidst everyone’s shock, Ye Yuan started imparting Yun Xiang what he learned.

Of course, what Ye Yuan comprehended was just some smattering of the Heaven formation.

If you compared the Heaven formation to a skyscraper, then what Ye Yuan comprehended was at most a small kitchen inside the large building.

It was insignificant in front of this tower.

When Yun Xiang listened, the fascinating expression on her face was unceasing.

What Ye Yuan comprehended opened a new door for her and let her know that it turned out Formation Dao could still be like this!

But even so, Yun Xiang was still somewhat laboring to comprehend these.

Only after spending several months’ time did she barely manage to understand it.

Actually, she still had many areas in which she only had half-baked knowledge. But due to status, she did not ask Ye Yuan in detail.

Too humiliating!

She, a Hegemon Realm, would not admit to being inferior to an Emperor Vast Heaven.

Yun Xiang believed that as long as she studied carefully later, she would be able to digest the content very quickly.

Four months later, everyone set off again.

Getting three treasures, Ye Yuan was also fully satisfied and content.

The Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear was prepared for Yang Qing.

After he acquired this spear, it was even more like a tiger gaining wings.

And the Myriad Magnetism Mountain was part of the Myriad Realms Mountain!
