Chapter 2720: Paying Respects to Master Ye!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No one expected that Saint Exalt Giant Ape and Saint Exalt Great Roc would actually be so polite.

Big Yellow was these two people’s junior. Even if he became a Saint Exalt now, he still did not have the capital to be proud in front of the two of them.

But they were courteous!

When these two were talking, they completely put Big Yellow on the same level of footing as them.

“Huhu,?the people have pretty much already arrived, why hasn’t Younger Brother Bull Demon shown himself yet?” Saint Exalt Giant Ape said.

His voice had yet to fade when a powerful aura arrived with a howl.

The expressions of Giant Ape and Great Roc changed abruptly, looking at the arrival in shock.

“This old bull … actually broke through!” Great Roc said with a look of disbelief.

Saint Exalt Giant Ape’s eyes were also glimmering as he said, “Looks like this exalt’s guess was right!”

“Haha,?old ape, damn bird, it’s still this exalt who took this step first!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon landed on the ground and looked at the two smugly as he said.

The three people had fought for many years and had always been running neck to neck.

Now, he took this step first out of the three, he naturally had the intention of showing off a little.

Hearing this, the faces of the two great Saint Exalts became black as the bottom of a pot, but they did not dare to express anything.

After Saint Sovereign Heaven, wanting to advance a step was seriously far too difficult.

The three of them spent several tens of thousands of years and only reached peak lower Saint Sovereign Heaven too.

But now, Saint Exalt Bull Demon already broke through from lower Saint Sovereign Heaven to middle Saint Sovereign Heaven first!

Saint Exalt Bull Demon was already the well-deserving king of the Myriad Demons Mountain!

Giant Ape and Great Roc also looked forward to the grade five heavenly alchemist behind Saint Exalt Bull Demon even more because of this.

No matter how great a price they had to pay, they would also have to cozy up to this ‘grade five heavenly alchemist’!

“Bull Demon, you don’t have to be so pleased with yourself! It isn’t that your talent surpasses the two of us. It’s just that you were lucky and encountered a grade five heavenly alchemist; that’s all! As long as this master is willing to take action, could it be that the two of us can’t break through?” Great Roc said with a cold snort.

“Grade five heavenly alchemist?” Saint Exalt Bull Demon was taken aback and immediately, his face revealed a playful smile.

These two guys did not know the inside story and actually thought that Ye Yuan was a grade five heavenly alchemist!

However, it was not strange either. There were probably many grade five heavenly alchemists who could not even match up to Ye Yuan’s means!

Seeing Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s expression, Saint Exalt Giant Ape sneered and said, “Why? Do you take the two of us to be fools? Already at this point, do you still want to hoard it for yourself?”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon laughed loudly and said, “You two old things, even if I were to really hoard it for myself, what can you guys do to me? That’s right. It’s indeed not easy for this exalt to kill you guys. But, if you really piss this exalt off, you guys probably won’t be able to remain on Myriad Demons Mountain anymore, right? Could it be that you guys can still break through and come back to take revenge?”

The words made the two great Saint Exalts very depressed.

Although Saint Exalt Bull Demon broke through, it was not easy if he really wanted to kill the two of them.

But, with Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s current strength, they would not be able to remain in the Myriad Demons Mountain if they wanted to.

Seeing the two people’s deflated expressions, Saint Exalt Bull Demon was very pleased with himself.

“Heh,?you guys rest assured, I, old bull, isn’t that kind of narrow-minded person! Without you two old things, this exalt will also find it a lot less fun. Younger Brother Ye is currently preparing to exit seclusion. He’ll come over right away! As for whether or not you can let him take action, it will depend on yourselves!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon said with a laugh.

Younger Brother?

When Giant Ape two people heard this, they carried some doubt amidst their excitement.

This old bull actually dared to address the other party as a younger brother?

But Saint Exalt Bull Demon ignored the two people’s doubtfulness. Flicking his sleeves grandly, he said in a loud voice, “I believe that everyone also knows that six Saint Exalts have broken through in succession within a few days on our Myriad Demons Mountain! Therefore, the arrangement of this Myriad Demons Mountain will naturally have to undergo a huge change. Convening everyone today, it’s to address this!”

The words made everyone become nervous.

The size of one’s territory was not just the manifestation of one’s status, there were many genuine benefits.

Coming here today was clearly to break the original rules and reestablish new rules.

This way, it would change everyone’s interests.

It concerned each of their true spirit’s interests!

Giant Ape two people wanted to say something but shut their mouths sensibly.

Now, it was already not what they could order people to do.

“From today onwards, all Saint Exalts will no longer have any territory, only their own fiefdoms! All of the Myriad Demons Mountain’s territories will be distributed to those below Saint Sovereign Heaven!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s words immediately caused huge waves.

Myriad Demons Mountain, the three great Saint Exalts occupied close to 70% of the territory.

Now, they were actually going to take out all 70% of this territory for everyone!

The expressions of Giant Ape and Great Roc two Saint Exalts were indescribably ugly.

However, they also knew that Saint Exalt Bull Demon definitely still had something else to add on.

This guy did not run a charity.

Sure enough, Saint Exalt Bull Demon continued, “From now on, the Myriad Demons Mountain will set up an All-Saint Temple. All saint exalts will belong to the All-Saint Temple! Those whose strengths reach half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven can enter the All-Saint Temple and become guest retainers. From now on, no matter which territory, you all have to hand over resources that are grade three and above to the All-Saint Temple, and the All-Saint Temple will distribute them uniformly.”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of all the true spirits changed.

All-Saint Temple this move was too ruthless!

This was equivalent to monopolizing all of the high-level resources!

Rather, it was the saint exalts whose eyes suddenly lit up. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This was tantamount to concentrating the resources of the entire Myriad Demons Mountain to support the few great saint exalts!

This was absolutely a great thing for saint exalts!

Many true spirits showed dissatisfied expressions.

But in this jungle, whatever a Saint Exalt said, that was it, they were not allowed to refute it.

Right at this time, a human figure suddenly appeared in everyone’s field of vision.

“Human! Why would there be a human here?”

“A lower Jade Sovereign Heaven actually barged into the true spirit summit, is he courting death?”

… …

This human was naturally the Ye Yuan who had just exited seclusion.

These few days, his Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist had some insights again, so he went into closed-seclusion for a few days.

Seeing Ye Yuan, Saint Exalt Bull Demon smiled and said, “Didn’t you guys want to meet the expert behind me? He’s already here!”

Saint Exalt Great Roc was taken aback and said with a black face, “Old bull, do you think that having broken through, you can toy with us? How can a mere lower Jade Sovereign Heaven possibly be a grade five heavenly alchemist?”

Giant Ape also had an unfriendly expression as he said, “Bull Demon, you’re going too far! Randomly finding a human to brush us off?”

Jade Sovereign Heavens were powerhouses of a region in the Myriad Demons Mountain too.

But they were nothing at all in the eyes of the two great saint exalts.

So the first thing the two of them felt was that Saint Exalt Bull Demon was toying with them!

But just as they flew into a thunderous rage, the six great saint exalts that just broke through left their seats in unison and dashed over toward Ye Yuan like the wind, scrambling to be the first.

“Newly ascended Saint Exalt Bright Tiger specially came to pay respects to Master Ye!”

“Newly ascended Saint Exalt Big Yellow specially came to pay respects to Master Ye!”

… …

The six great saint exalts surrounded Ye Yuan, directly bowing all the way down.

That appearance was incomparably devout.

This entire mountain of true spirit powerhouses, plus Giant Ape and Great Roc two saint exalts, were utterly stunned.
