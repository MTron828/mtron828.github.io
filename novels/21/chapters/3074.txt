Chapter 3073: Unparalleled Under the Heavens!!

This was naturally not the Universe scroll, but it was too close to the secret compartment’s mechanism!

Ye Yuan took a few looks. These were some essays and poems.

Feeling bored, he put it back where it was.

A large rock landed on the ground in Heavenless’ heart! What a close shave!

Immediately, he sneered incessantly.?“Heh,?what wielder of great destiny, you even bluffed this ancestor! In the end, didn’t you still brush past it? This boy, when he’s on his deathbed and this ancestor tells him that here is where the Universe scroll was placed, would the expression on his face be very fascinating?”

Heavenless could not help somewhat looking forward to him. In fact, he was really scared half to death just now.

However, he also knew that at this time, he absolutely could not give anything away.

This boy was too sharp. Once he revealed any hints, he would definitely see through something.

From start to end, his face was placid without any ripples.

Right at this time, a cluster of Extreme Dao True Fire rose up, pouncing straight for Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan casually waved his hand. A burst of chaos divine essence was fired out, directly dispersing it.

Coincidentally, this attack’s aftershock was not exhausted, and it actually directly slammed onto the mechanism.

Click!

The secret compartment opened, revealing the lambskin scroll inside.

Ancestor Heavenless who was still gloating just now was staring dumbfoundedly.

S-So coincidental?

This cluster of Extreme Dao True Fire was really divine!

The position, the angle, they were just right.

As if it was opening the mechanism for Ye Yuan!

His Extreme Dao True Fire followed like a shadow, but Ye Yuan was too powerful.

With the power of the Extreme Dao True Fire presently, it was unable to harm him at all.

The Extreme Dao True Fire previously, Heavenless saw it too, Ye Yuan could crush it with a wave of his hand.

Chaos divine essence was no joke, unless he could divert his energy to specifically target Ye Yuan.

Otherwise, he completely could not do anything to him at the moment.

But coincidentally, this cluster of Extreme Dao True Fire was really too timely!

A myriad of profanities galloped across in Ancestor Heavenless’ heart.

Ye Yuan also looked at the secret compartment rather surprisedly and suddenly smiled. “Senior Heavenless, I didn’t expect that it’s really so coincidental. This lambskin scroll wouldn’t be the Universe volume, right?”

Actually, he already knew the answer. Ancestor Heavenless’ expression already landed in his eyes.

His dumbfoundedness clearly showed that this was the Universe volume!

Uh … the Extreme Medicine Sect’s ancestors, you all are really too awesome!

Destiny was indeed foreordained by the unseen!

Ye Yuan casually picked up the lambskin scroll. Upon looking, what could it be if not the Universe scroll?

“Hur hur,?I said it before; my luck has always been pretty good. However, without Senior Heavenless’ Extreme Dao True Fire, I’d really have walked past the Universe scroll! Many thanks!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Ancestor Heavenless’ heart was already filled with shock and depression.

He did not expect that it was actually this damn Extreme Dao True Fire that helped Ye Yuan find the Universe scroll!

A holder of great destiny!

Was this the holder of great destiny?

This brat’s luck was a little too good, right?

It was not that he did not believe in destiny. It was just that he never thought that someone could use this kind of unusual method to find the Heavenly Dao Painting!

“Kid, consider yourself ruthless! Hope that you can comprehend spatial origin before this ancestor exterminates them!”

Ancestor Heavenless’ figure directly dissipated without leaving even a word behind.

No more face!

In addition, he also had to speed up refining those powerhouses!

At this time, his apprehension towards Ye Yuan was no less than that of Hegemon Samsara and Chaos Bloodstone.

Obtaining the Universe scroll, Ye Yuan did not get too entangled either, injecting chaos divine essence and directly started gaining enlightenment on Dao!

He also knew that it was not the time to be pleased with himself at present.

How this farce would end, no one knew either.

But Ye Yuan did not want to see Ancestor Heavenless return to the 33 Heavens.

This might not be a good thing for the 33 Heavens.

However, making use of Ancestor Hegemon to inflict heavy wounds on Hegemon Samsara and Chaos Bloodstone was a pretty good choice.

It seemed like he could set the snipe and clam at each other and take advantage of them both.

The present situation was rather delicate.

If Hegemon Samsara and the Chaos Samsara Pill were refined, and Ancestor Hegemon really refined them into the strongest Chaos Heavenly Pill in history, he might really be able to transcend the Great Beyond!

With Ancestor Heavenless’ temperament, the consequences were seriously hard to predict!

But, if Hegemon Samsara and the Chaos Bloodstone’s clones were seriously wounded and Ancestor Hegemon was not able to refine them.

This way, the three great supremacies would all be hurt!

These two great clones were very important existences to Hegemon Samsara and the Chaos Bloodstone.

Once heavily injured, the main body would definitely be greatly implicated. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, this angle had to be grasped well!

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan already had a plan in his heart!

Of course, the prerequisite for all these was comprehending spatial origin first!

Hegemon Samsara and the Chaos Bloodstone’s clones were almost despairing.

At this time, including them, they no longer had the strength left to attack the Labyrinth Divine World anymore.

They were very strong, but they were just clones in the end.

The entire Labyrinth Divine World was Ancestor Heavenless’ main body!

This was no joke.

“Damn it! I didn’t expect that I was actually schemed against by this sly old fox! Losing this clone, this progenitor’s strength will reduce by at least 30%! Once Old Man Heavenless really succeeds in refining the pill and re-condenses a physical body, transcending the Great Beyond, then the consequences will be too severe!”

Hegemon Samsara was bitterly remorseful in his heart. The temptation of the 12 Heavenly Dao Paintings was too strong!.

It was just that he did not expect that not only did Ancestor Heavenless not die, but furthermore, he transformed into chaos and refined himself together with the Labyrinth Divine World.

Such means were too fantastical.

He was originally very confident. With this clone’s strength, obtaining the 12 Heavenly Dao paintings would be effortless.

Who knew that he still walked into a trap!

Everyone knew that Old Man Heavenless did not have good intentions.

But no one expected that Old Man Heavenless’ boldness was actually so great.

He schemed against all the 33 Heavens’ top powerhouses!

There was also the Chaos Bloodstone who had the same idea as him.

The blue-robed youth said with regret,?“Heh,?this progenitor thought that I schemed against all the heavens. Didn’t expect that in the end, I’m still less skilled than Old Man Heavenless! Old Man Samsara, I didn’t expect that this progenitor would fail to exchange blows with you. I was actually defeated under Old Man Heavenless’ hands in the end!”

Hegemon Samsara sighed and said, “In the end, this progenitor still underestimated him! Looks like of the three of us, it’s still him who won in the end! Yours and my clone being refined into a heavenly pill, it will be equivalent to losing 30%-40% of our strength. It will simply be impossible to be his match anymore!”

The blue-robed youth suddenly remembered someone and said, “Where’s Ye Yuan that boy? Is he dead?”

Samsara smiled lightly and said, “You seem to have quite a deep resentment toward that boy!”

The blue-robed youth snorted coldly and said, “That’s because you didn’t become his opponent. Otherwise, your resentment will be very deep too! Back then, he made this progenitor suffer a huge loss at True Sovereign Heaven Realm! This isn’t what the average person can accomplish! If he didn’t die yet, maybe … this situation can still have a sudden turn of events!”

Samsara shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “You’re thinking too much! This progenitor admits that that boy is very impressive! But Old Man Heavenless isn’t a worthless wretch like you! Being able to scheme against the two of us at the same time, his intelligence is truly unparalleled under the heavens! Resign yourself to fate!”
