Chapter 1240: Four Great Elders Moving out Simultaneously!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan asked everyone very amiably, but the other party was fearful as if they were facing a tiger. They were actually collectively scared until they fell back several steps.

“You ... You ... Don’t come over!”

Long Zhen was pissing his pants in fear. Ye Yuan really had a psychological shadow on him.

The matters back then caused an indelible impression on him.

Originally, he thought that he could already get over it. He did not expect that this devil appeared once more!

This person was simply his nightmare.

Seeing these fellows’ expressions, Ye Yuan could not help being speechless.

He was really very curious about whether or not this place was really the space behind the Dark Forest.

It was just that these guys were clearly frightened by his strength.

But he really did not have ill-intent!

“Hey, you’re called Long Zhen, right? Can you tell me whether or not this place is the Dark Forest? Can one pass through to the Endless World from here?” Ye Yuan asked with a radiant smile.

He took a step forward. Those guys were like startled rabbits, finally could not bear the psychological pressure, and escaped with their tails tucked between their legs.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan could not help feeling helpless.

“Come on, am I so scary? This young master hasn’t even made a move yet, alright?” Ye Yuan said speechlessly.

White Light chortled with laughter and said, “These guys are really cowards, throwing away our Four Symbols Family Clans’ face.”

Li-er smiled and said, “Big Brother Yuan, you didn’t attack, but they got badly frightened by your strength. The peak Tier 9 young patriarch could not even last past one move under your hands. How could they not be scared?”

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Looks like I can only use force.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan’s figure moved, vanishing from where he originally was.

The young patriarch was currently fleeing speedily when suddenly, a surge of terrifying sword intent locked onto him.

The young patriarch’s hairs stood on its ends. He seemed to have seen the death god currently beckoning to him.

But unexpectedly, he was even more like a bird startled by the twang of a bowstring, wanting to escape.

“Keep running and die!”

Ye Yuan’s words seemingly came out from the underworld, shattering his fantasies.

The young patriarch’s footsteps abruptly stopped. He discovered that a young man was currently looking at him coldly.

As for the rest, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care at all, allowing them to leave freely.

In Ye Yuan’s view, the things that this young patriarch might know was a little more.

...

“H-H-Head ... Head Elder, things are bad!”

When everyone returned to the clan, there was immediately hysteria, startling the entire clan.

“Shouting and wrangling, where lies the sense of propriety! With this seat around, even the sky can’t fall!” Head Elder Long Yan said with an unhappy look.

Hearing Head Elder’s steady-as-Mount Tai voice, everyone’s hearts settled down a little.

“Head Elder, it’s really that things are bad! There ... There’s a human that broke into our Divine Beast Realm! Furthermore ... Furthermore ...” Talking to the back, Long Zhen became hesitant in speech.

Long Yan’s expression also changed. Humans breaking into the Divine Beast Realm had not happened in god knows how many years.

“Furthermore what, speak!” Long Yan said solemnly.

“Furthermore, he captured Young Patriarch!” Long Zhen said hesitantly. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The young patriarch was Long Yan’s grandson.

Sure enough, the moment Long Yan heard, he could not help flying into a great rage.

“What an arrogant human, trespassing my Divine Beast Realm, and even dared to detain my grandson, this is seeking death! Who’s the other party? Could it be that he barged in through the Lower Realms’ spatial channel?” Long Yan gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Long Zhen shook his head and said, “N-No idea. But he came from the direction of the Peach Blossom Forest.”

Long Yan’s eyes glared and he said in disbelief, “What? This is impossible! The Peach Blossom Forest was an array formation that Ancestor personally laid down. Unless it’s a Deity Realm powerhouse who came personally, otherwise, there’s absolutely no way to pass through!”

Long Zhen said with a bitter smile, “Head Elder, I don’t know either! Maybe he barged in from the Lower Realms. It’s just, I don’t know how he walked to the Peach Blossom Forest that side. Mm, it should be like this. After all, he had once entered the Endless World’s God Prohibited Demon Region before.”

Head Elder was stunned and said, “You know him?”

Long Zhen nodded his head and briefly recounted the grudge with Ye Yuan. Only then did Head Elder come to a realization.

“Humph! No matter who he is, to dare detain Chun-er, it’s a one way ticket to hell! Go, bring me to go see him!” Long Yan said.

The moment Long Yan went out, three other figures came up to welcome.

“Why are the three of you here too?” Long Yan said.

In this Divine Beast Realm, the four great clans lived together. But each clan was managed separately.

These three people in front were precisely the other three major races’ head elders.

“We heard that there’s a human who broke into this place. Furthermore, his strength isn’t weak and even detained Long Chun, so we were planning to go take a look. We know that you want to go, so we came over together to find you,” the tiger clan’s head elder said.

Long Yan did not hesitate either and said with a nod, “May as well, come on!”

...

Ye Yuan tried both hard and soft tactics and finally learned the information that he wanted from Long Chun’s mouth.

It turned out that this place was actually really behind the Dark Forest!

Back then, he and White Light had once investigated the peripherals of the Dark Forest before. But the undulation coming from the Dark Forest made them unable to cross at all.

Therefore, the idea of wanting to come in and take a look was also grounded.

He did not expect that after a time interval of many years, they actually used this sort of method and entered the Dark Forest.

This place was actually another space. Furthermore, there even lived another group of Four Symbols Family Clans!

What Ye Yuan did not expect even more was that not only was this place connected to the Lower Realms, it was even linked to the Divine Realm’s Godsfall Mountain Range.

This Divine Beast Realm was simply too magical.

Ye Yuan got to understand from Long Chun that the Divine Beast Realm did not just link to the Endless World, there were even quite a number of other small worlds.

The demonic beasts inside the God Prohibited Demon Region were originally all living in the Divine Beast Realm.

But following the propagation of the various races, the Divine Beast Realm could not accommodate so many clansmen anymore.

Hence, the Divine Beast Realm’s demon race connected their space to the Lower Realms’ space with a great divine ability. They then banished some impure demon species to the Lower Realms’ God Prohibited Demon Region.

Just like this, no idea how many years had passed, the outside world’s God Prohibited Demon Region had already completely forgotten that they had once originated from the Divine Beast Realm.

Toward the trial-takers that came out from inside the Dark Forest, they held them in awe and veneration.

Hence, it developed into this current situation.

From Long Chun’s mouth, Ye Yuan even got to know that this Divine Beast Realm still had an extremely mysterious ancestor.

Ye Yuan was very curious about this mysterious ancestor. It was just a pity that this ancestor, even Long Chun had not seen before either.

So much so that he even doubted the ancestor’s existence.

However, Long Chun said that this Peach Blossom Forest was personally set up by the ancestor, in order to cut off from the Godsfall Mountain Range.

For so many years, no one had entered the Divine Beast Realm from the Godsfall Mountain Range before.

Long Chun did not think that today, Ye Yuan actually passed through the Peach Blossom Forest and arrived here!

As for this Divine Beast Realm’s origins, it was no longer possible to investigate. Even Long Chun, this young patriarch, had no way of knowing too.

But Ye Yuan felt that the demon race of the Divine Beast Realm and the Divine Realm were most probably closely related!

Hearing these contents, Ye Yuan and White Light were both deeply shocked.

Both of them did not expect that the Divine Realm actually still had such a mysterious land.

Looks like this Divine Beast Realm was also filled with secrets!
