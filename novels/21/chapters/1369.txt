Chapter 1373: Watch a Good Show!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Su Yuecang, 13 scale lines, obtained 120 points!”

“Xiang Zhuang, 12 scale lines, obtained 115 points!”

“Wu Yang, 12 scale lines, obtained 115 points!”

“Qin Shao, 17 scale lines, obtained 180 points!”

...

Qin Shao’s results set off an upsurge in the crowd once more.

Because his results basically already locked in the top dog this time!

Even if Qin Shao was calm, when he obtained this result, his body was trembling incessantly too.

For the sake of this day, he paid far too much.

“Qin Shao is really ridiculously strong! I originally thought that Jia Chong can overpower Qin Shao in this round, but I didn’t expect that he actually tied with him!”

“Yeah! Qin Shao’s overall strength is seriously too strong! Other people can only look at his back!”

“With this, the outcome is a foregone conclusion! If it was past years, Jia Chong was bound to crush the capital city’s geniuses. Unfortunately, he ran into Qin Shao.”

“Next, Ye Yuan!”

Just as the people were discussing animatedly, it was finally Ye Yuan’s turn to take the field.

Everyone also did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually queued up so behind. He was considered to have been called out after a great many times.

But everyone already did not have much interest in him. Everyone already sentenced him to death. It was impossible for him to pass the assessment.

Wu Meng Wargod Formula, this kind of pinnacle cultivation method, he only used three days, and he could have some comprehensions?

You have got to be kidding!

If Ye Yuan really succeeded in clearing the round, where would these geniuses’ faces be put?

“Heh, a good show is about to happen! Let us see how Ye Yuan crushes us one million geniuses! Haha ...”

Jia Chong’s voice was very loud, immediately incurring a wave of roaring laughters.

17 scale lines was already a lot higher than previous years’ average.

Even the top dog, Qin Shao, only fought to a draw with him too. It could be seen how praiseworthy this was.

For Ye Yuan to want to win Jia Chong, there was no possibility at all.

When Ye Yuan passed by Jia Chong, he smiled and said, “Then open your eyes wide and watch a good show!”

Jia Chong smiled coldly and said, “Okay, I’ll wait and see!”

Ye Yuan came before the jade pillar and slowly put his palm on it.

The next instant, the originally noisy waiting area immediately became dead silent.

The audience was silent!

It was only to see the jade pillar instantly light up. In virtually a blink of an eye, it charged past five scale lines!

Under normal circumstances, the luminance of the jade pillar would get increasingly slower as it went up.

However, Ye Yuan did not have the slightest trend of slowing down, directly charging up to the 10th scale line!

Then, it was the 15th scale line, 16th scale line, 17th scale line.

A draw!

Everyone drew a cold breath, their eyeballs almost popping out.

This scene happened too quickly, swiftly until everyone could not react to it.

But just as everyone thought that it would still continue to charge up, the lighting speed of the jade pillar suddenly slowed down.

Then, it slowly crawled past the 18th scale line.

It stopped!

After continuing a while, Ye Yuan slowly put down his palm and discovered that the old men on the platform were still in the midst of shock.

“Teacher?” Ye Yuan said.

Lei Dong’s entire body trembled. Only then did he come to his senses and said, “Ye Yuan, 18 scale lines, obtained 195 points!”

Lei Dong’s words made everyone all come to their senses.

“This ... What’s going on here? What in the world happened just now? I feel like it went up with a whoosh all at once!”

“My God! I even thought that my eyes were failing me and looked for quite a few times before discovering that it’s real!”

“18 scale lines! He actually really surpassed Qin Shao and Jia Chong, ranking first!”

“Why do I feel like ... he still has strength to spare? Could it be that ... this is my delusion?”

...

The waiting area was immediately in an uproar. Everyone did not dare to believe the scene that happened just now.

Others unleashed even the strength used to suckle milk in order to make the jade pillar light up a bit.

But Ye Yuan only lightly placed his hand on it and directly reached 17 scale lines. There was not the slightest bit of pause in the middle!

Only when it reached the 18th scale line, did it abruptly stop.

From motion to stillness, it gave people a feeling of longing for more.

Everyone all felt that Ye Yuan still had strength left.

He deliberately stopped on the 18th scale line!

Of course, Ye Yuan did it on purpose.

Want to win, he should win beautifully!

But he also did not wish to be overly shocking and let people know that he directly comprehended the Wu Meng Wargod Formula.

As for where his limits lay, let everyone go and guess.

Lei Dong and Mu Sen exchanged glances, both seeing the deep shock in the other party’s eyes.

They were certain that Ye Yuan absolutely held back strength!

As for how much, they really did not dare to say.

Maybe ... Maybe ... even higher than 23rd!

This was already the limit that they could imagine!

They naturally could not guess that if Ye Yuan went all out, he could blow this jade pillar up.

“Hahaha! Punk, didn’t expect that you were so impressive! You made Lord Fatty, I, worried for nothing!” Xie Jingyi excitedly gave Ye Yuan another punch.

He was really too happy!

When he faced Jia Chong, he had always felt very inferior, inferior until he did not even dare to breathe loudly.

This time, Ye Yuan really helped him to vent this grievance.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan even helped him regain confidence and helped him to miraculously pass the test!

Although Ye Yuan was just a scale line higher than Jia Chong, in front of his startling performance, this one scale line was amplified infinitely!

Ye Yuan clearly still had a great deal of strength to spare, it was just that he was unwilling to be high-profile.

In front of Ye Yuan, Jia Chong’s light was overshadowed.

The test afterward appeared dull and boring.

The ones who passed the test, in the end, were only 300 over people.

The rest were all transported out of this space.

“I said before, winning against you is too easy! Uh ... Thank you for your points,” Ye Yuan said and shrugged.

Jia Chong’s fury was almost bursting forth from his chest.

The humiliation that Ye Yuan gave him was too strong!

Looking back now, his provocation previously appeared so ridiculous!

And the points that he worked hard to earn were actually reset all at once!

That was 440 points!

This was not just 440 points, it was also testimony to his 100 over years of hard work.

Now, it was all gone!

Jia Chong knew that without points, one could not advance an inch in the Wu Meng Academy.

With these points, he could be a step faster than people.

He did not expect that now, it was like drawing water with a sieve, having not a single point left!

“Ye Yuan, 220 points have already been transferred to your wooden tablet. Your current points are a total 520 points! However, your gambling agreement isn’t counted in the test. The top dog this time is still Qin Shao!”

Lei Dong transferred the points in Jia Chong’s wooden tablet into Ye Yuan and Xie Jingyi’s wooden tablets, respectively.

Ye Yuan’s points were originally not considered outstanding, just above-average standard. Now, it charged to first place all of a sudden, even 25 points more than Qin Shao!

Xie Jingyi held the wooden tablet, his heart still somewhat racing.

Although it was satisfying this time, he also offended Jia Chong badly.

In the past, Jia Chong did not take him seriously at all. Now, he would definitely think of ways to send him to his doom.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
