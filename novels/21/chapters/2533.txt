Chapter 2539: Another Wager!

Ye Yuan looked at the two people coldly and said coolly, “I, this ‘Big Brother’, didn’t let you guys down, right?”

Zhao Yu two people had horrified looks on their faces. How could they still dare to talk back?

Second Prince’s complexion even turned pale. He never could have thought that Ye Yuan was actually so strong!

Zhao Yu and Jiang Zhu two people were both elites in the royal family. Their strength, even ordinary upper Lesser Sublime Heavens were not a match either.

But Ye Yuan actually put them down with one move!

Ye Yuan could not be bothered to care about Second Prince, but he looked toward Gu Mao and said coolly, “Are you going to make me mutilate you and take it myself? Or are you offering it up on your own?”

The corners of Gu Mao’s mouth twitched slightly, his face revealing a look of fear.

He was an upper Lesser Sublime Heaven too, his combat strength could not even compare to Zhao Yu two people, how could he possibly be Ye Yuan’s match?

“I … I’ll hand it over!”

Gu Mao fished out several jade slips unwillingly, those were all the essences of his Alchemy Dao!

Hanging it over to Ye Yuan, he felt his flesh ache.

Ye Yuan inspected the jade slips and said with a cold smile, “Just these? If I didn’t guess wrongly, these are all very ordinary pill formulas, right? As a heavenly alchemist who is renowned in the imperial city, you only have this bit of secret stash? Looks like you’re not very honest!”

Who was Ye Yuan?

The Heavenspan World’s alchemy path was single handedly created by him!

Although he did not know much about heavenly pills, he still had good judgment. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Mao was very clever, taking out some obscure pill formulas.

But these pill formulas were all some inconsequential pill formulas.

Wanting to use these to smoke his way through in front of Ye Yuan was easier said than done.

The corners of Gu Mao’s mouth twitched slightly, only then did he take out a few more pieces of jade slips extremely unwillingly.

Only after Ye Yuan inspected it, did he nod his head slightly.

“These few pill formulas, you can’t refine them either. So what’s the use of cherishing your own belonging that’s of little value?” Ye Yuan swept a glance at Gu Mao and said coolly.

Gu Mao’s face turned black, and he almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

One of the pill formulas was called Jasper Regeneration Pill. It was precisely the heavenly pill to regrow severed limbs!

If Gu Mao could refine it, Tang Yu would have long begged him for it.

Clearly, this guy could not refine it at all.

“I can’t refine. Could it be that you can refine it? These few pill formulas’ refining difficulty is extremely high. Master Lin might not be able to refine them too. So just the likes of you can do it?” Gu Mao said with a sneer.

Ye Yuan ignored him. He turned to Second Prince and said smilingly, “Second Prince, Your Highness, I know that you won’t be willing to drop the matter, but I advise you, better drop this idea.”

Second Prince’s face revealed a fearful look, but he smiled coldly and said, “You’re threatening this prince? If you have the capability, kill this prince! As long as you don’t dare to kill this prince, after returning to the palace, it will be the end of you and the Tang Family!”

When Tang Jinhua father and son heard that, their expressions changed.

But Ye Yuan was not concerned and said with a smile, “Second Prince, Your Highness, why don’t we make a bet too?”

Second Prince had a look of disdain and he said with a cold smile, “On what basis should this prince bet with you?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Not betting is fine too, then you’ll die right now!”

Second Prince laughed loudly when he heard that and said,?“Hahaha?… Bring it on! Come and kill me!”

Boom!

His voice had yet to fade when Ye Yuan’s terrifying aura bloomed again.

Dual Polarity turned into a light wheel, cleaving straight for Second Prince.

At first, Second Prince still did not believe that Ye Yuan dared to kill him.

But that light wheel did not slow down in the least bit, heading straight for his face.

An aura of death hit him head-on!

He finally knew that Ye Yuan was not joking!

“I’ll bet!” Second Prince practically yelled these two words out.

The light wheel dissipated with a loud bang as if nothing had happened.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “The Tang Family is your dog. But isn’t your royal family a dog of Jadetrue Heavenly Sect too? Therefore, don’t think that you’re very noble. In this world, there are always some people who can think nothing of you.”

Second Prince’s back was already drenched in sweat.

Having made a trip to the gates of hell and back, he had long already lost his previous composure.

“W-What do you want to bet on?” Second Prince asked.

Ye Yuan said, “I’ll let you return. You don’t be in a hurry to deal with the Tang Family first. Tonight, I’ll make a trip to the royal palace and meet with you. You can use all sorts of methods to stop me from meeting you! If I can’t meet you, the Tang Family will be at your disposal. But, if I meet you, you don’t need you to do anything either. Just deliver the heavenly medicine for the Jasper Regeneration Pill tomorrow. It’s that simple.”

Second Prince’s pupils constricted, and he said in a solemn voice, “You’re trying to tell me that as long as you want to kill this prince, it wouldn’t work even if this prince hides in the palace?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly and said, “Smart, that’s what it means.”

Everyone exchanged glances, shocked expressions on their faces.

This Ye Yuan was a little too arrogant, right?

He actually did not put the royal family in his eyes at all!

What kind of place was the palace?

That was the most heavily guarded place in the entire Eastward Country, and it was also the place with the most experts.

Disregarding that the likes of Zhao Yu and Jiang Zhu were everywhere in the palace, there were also a whole bunch of them.

As for grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven powerhouses, there were naturally quite a few too.

And in the palace, there were even Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses!

Ye Yuan dared to provoke the royal family, this was simply a joke!

Especially Gu Mao, he was gloating over others’ misfortune.

This brat was courting death himself, could not blame others!

… …

That night, at Second Prince’s palace.

An old man with white hair and beard sat in front of Second Prince.

Second Prince gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Master Yun, you must help me this time! That boy doesn’t place this prince in his eyes at all, and even thinks nothing of the royal family! He actually said that he can come and go as he pleases in the royal palace!”

This Master Yun was a retainer of the royal family called Lu Yun, a lower Greater Sublime Heaven super powerhouse!

He was the initiation teacher of Second Prince, his strength being extremely powerful.

After returning to the palace, Second Prince immediately went to find Lu Yun without saying anything.

He had also once thought of directly finding Lu Yun to go kill Ye Yuan.

But he did not dare!

The feeling that Ye Yuan gave him was too strange.

He did not dare to wager with his life!

If Ye Yuan really had the ability to enter and leave the palace at will, then wouldn’t he be in danger all the time in the future?

He was very certain that Ye Yuan really dared to kill him!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan really dared to release him!

After much thought, Second Prince still decided to give it a try.

As long as he discovered Ye Yuan, Second Prince reckon that he could not escape Master Yun’s palm either!

Lu Yun smiled and said, “Yu Tang, you’re becoming more and more overcautious and indecisive! Being so timid, how can you beat that big brother of yours?”

Second Prince did not dare to talk back and said, “Master Yun, this boy is indeed a little strange! I suspect that he might have something to do with that Jun Tian’s death too!”

Lu Yun chuckled and said, “Alright, don’t give this old man that! No matter how weak that Jun Tian was, he’s also Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s outer-sect deacon! Although this old man is a cultivation realm higher than him, I really don’t have the confidence to dare say that I can definitely beat him. How can he die at the hands of an ascender? Tonight, I’ll be in the side room next door. If he dares to come, I’ll naturally make sure he doesn’t return!”

The moment Second Prince heard this, he could not help being overjoyed.

“Thank you, Master Yun! It’s still Master Yun who dotes on Yu Tang!” Second Prince said agitatedly.
