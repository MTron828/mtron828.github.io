Chapter 2517: Look at My Mouth Shape!

“Heh!?Transforming Dao, this step, is the most dangerous. But you achieved the chaos origin divinity by chance. This step became very easy instead! You, boy, really have a heaven-defying destiny!” Jun Tian marveled with amazement.

Originally, Transforming Dao was the most dangerous in the process of breaking through to Heavenly Stratum.

Not knowing the right way, it was very likely to suffer a backlash and lose yourself.

Heavenly Dao was heartless. This was not said for fun.

But Ye Yuan achieved the chaos origin divinity by coincidence.

This was also to say that Ye Yuan’s divine soul already reached the level of Heavenly Stratum!

Therefore, this step became the easiest for him actually.

While surprise was surprise, Jun Tian did not seem to pay attention to Ye Yuan’s breakthrough.

Someone who just broke through to Heavenly Stratum, furthermore, it was even a lower realm ant. Why would he take him seriously?

Hence, he did not stop it at all. He watched with interest instead.

Everything was still under his control!

Ye Yuan’s physical body was recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

At this time, virtually the entire Heavenspan World’s spiritual energy was being used by him.

Ye Yuan only felt that his divine soul was almost leaving his body.

That refreshing feeling made every pore in his body relax.

At this time, when he looked at the Heavenspan World again, the feeling was already totally different.

It was like he was standing in the sky, looking at everything in the mortal world.

Whatever Dao Ancestor, whatever Deva, whatever Heavenly Emperor, they were insignificant like ants on the ground.

It was also no wonder that Jun Tian would be so scornful.

Beneath Heavenly Dao, all were ants!

He was heaven!

This kind of feeling was too wonderful!

“Huhu,?do you feel unprecedentedly great?” Jun Tian said with a smile. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Yes, really unprecedentedly good!”

Jun Tian nodded his head and said, “Therefore, the current you should be able to understand how I feel, right? The lives of ants aren’t worthy of respect.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, seemingly somewhat agreeing with it.

Seeing this scene, the smile on Jun Tian’s face grew stronger.

While the expressions of the others changed slightly.

Especially those Heavenspan World powerhouses in the distance, their hearts sunk to rock-bottom.

“Lord Saint Azure he …”

They were scared to the extreme. If Lord Saint Azure became a person like Jun Tian, then the Heavenspan World would really be finished.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan opened his mouth and said with a serious expression on his face: “I understand … my ass! Is a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse very impressive? Why don’t you take a piss and look at your own reflection? Who the hell do you think you are? You’re definitely an ant-like existence in the outside world too, right? Otherwise, why would you come to the Heavenspan World to find a sense of existence? A piece of trash like you can only bully people of the Lower Realms, right?”

Ye Yuan deliberately dragged out the tone. Jun Tian revealed a look of amusement.

But suddenly, Ye Yuan’s tone changed and his words shot out like a machine gun, hitting Jun Tian until he did not come back to his senses for a long time.

But very soon, his expression turned dark.

“Huhu, very good! Looks like you’ve become high after you became a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse!” Jun Tian said with a cold smile.

“Yeah, I’m very high right now! But very soon, you’ll be high too! You’ll go high up into the sky!” Ye Yuan similarly responded with a sneer.

When Heavenspan World’s people heard Ye Yuan’s words, their hearts finally settled down.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s words made them feel very liberated.

Recollecting the aftertaste, they felt that Ye Yuan’s words make a lot of sense!

True powerhouses did not deign to bother with ants.

Only those people who failed to achieve their ambitions would look for a sense of existence in front of weaklings.

Just like Ye Yuan, he would never take the initiative to go and bully the weak.

His opponents were always those existences stronger than him!

A hint of an amused smile showed on Jun Tian’s face, and he said,?“Huhu,?do you know why I didn’t stop you when you broke through just now? Among Heavenly Stratum powerhouses, there is a vast difference in strength! Just like you now, you’re a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum. But, the disparity between Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum and Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum is huge too! For example, I can kill a lower Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum like you with a flip with my hand, understand?”

“Idiot!”

Jun Tian said a whole bunch, but Ye Yuan was expressionless and replied with a word coolly.

Jun Tian was taken aback and said in a solemn voice, “What did you say?”

Ye Yuan pointed at his own lips and said, “Don’t understand? Look at the shape of my mouth, iiiiidiot! Now, do you understand?”

This time, Jun Tian was really enraged.

The muscles on his face were twitching.

An ant like Ye Yuan provoked him time and again. He already reached the limit of patience.

“Very good! Looks like … you really don’t know what’s called fear! Then … I’ll let you know now!”

Jun Tian flipped his palm over, that world-destroying power appeared once again!

The horrifying to the extreme power made everyone’s faces change.

Ye Yuan swept his sleeves grandly and directly swept Yue Mengli and the others away.

“Take them away! The further you run, the better! If there are any losses, you all will be held accountable!”

These words were said to Wei Feng.

Wei Feng’s entire body trembled, knowing that an apocalyptic great battle was about to start.

This was the true Doomsday Battle!

People like them, even if they watched the fight from afar, it was also impossible to be spared.

“Lord Saint Azure, rest assured. I definitely won’t fail you!”

After he was done talking, Wei Feng brought the group of wounded people and sped away.

Jun Tian did not stop this scene. Being merely a bunch of ants, he could annihilate them with a turn of his hand.

The most important thing right now was to make this ant in front of him know fear!

Above the sky, the cloud layer was extremely low, giving people an extremely constrained feeling.

A blue ball emerged on Jun Tian’s hand.

On the ball, electric light flashed, shocking to the core.

“Ants are ants. Even if you broke through to Heavenly Stratum, you’re still an ant!”

Jun Tian’s figure flashed, instantly arriving in front of Ye Yuan.

That light-ball was directly pressed toward Ye Yuan.

The void around the two people directly turned into a mass of nothingness.

A hint of a cruel smile flashed across the corners of his mouth.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly gave a big slap.

Without deviating to the left or right, it landed right on Jun Tian’s body.

This slap landing, it was as if the entire sky had fallen down!

The power of this slap was actually much stronger than even Jun Tian!

Bang!

Jun Tian’s body was directly smacked into the ground.

Being extremely far away, the figures of Wei Feng and the others suddenly paused, looking into the distance with shocked faces.

Then, everyone exchanged glances, their gazes revealing wild elation.

“You all felt it, right?” Wei Feng said.

“F-Felt it! The aura of the person from behind is definitely Lord Saint Azure! S-So strong!”

“But how can he be so strong? Even if he broke through to Heavenly Stratum, it’s also impossible to be stronger than the outside world’s powerhouses, right?”

The severely wounded Originsmile suddenly said, “It’s the power of the Heavenspan World! Ye Yuan borrowed the power of the Heavenspan World! Fighting against that Heavenly Stratum powerhouse with the power of a world!”

He remembered that Ye Yuan had once executed it in the divine race before.

One word repelled Heavenly Dao!

Now, he definitely borrowed the power of the Heavenspan World!

“Excellent! We’re finally saved! Lord Tian Qing, you didn’t die in vain! The Heavenspan World is saved!” Tears rolled down Originsmile’s old face.
