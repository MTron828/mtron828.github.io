Chapter 2510: Eight Extreme Divinities’ Shock and Terror!

The beating was naturally not in vain.

The first time they exchanged blows, Ye Yuan felt that this power was not the Eight Extreme Divinities’ own power.

He extracted the power of the Heavenspan World through some mysterious power.

That was also the so-called power of Heavenly Dao.

This power was merely a drop in the ocean to the Heavenspan World.

But to martial artists, it was akin to heaven’s might!

It was just that, this kind of means could hide from others, but how could it hide from Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan refined the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain. At present, he was even standing at the summit of the Heavenspan Mountain already.

The undulation of Heavenly Dao could not hide from his perception at all!

He took the beating actually to figure this out.

The means to mobilize the power of Heavenly Dao!

Thankfully, he did not fail the mission. He did it!

These eight statues were more like an array formation. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Each time they executed that energy, they would emit a kind of mysterious undulation.

At the same time, the Heavenspan Mountain seemed to be able to feel this undulation, and lend him its power.

Ye Yuan was in possession of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, he naturally sensed this undulation even more distinctly.

After many times, he finally grasped this undulation!

Hence, that was why there was the scene of repelling heaven’s might with one word!

And this scene was really explosive to the extreme. It gave the divine race powerhouses a feeling of beholding a great mountain.

Boom!

Terrifying sword intent instantly covered a radius of a thousand miles.

Universe Sword Formation!

The eight statues were directly enveloped in the range of the sword formation.

The Eight Extreme Divinities said in terror, “You … What do you want to do?”

“Don’t you know what I want to do?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Y-You dare?! These eight statues are deposited with a wisp of my true self’s origin divinity! If you dare destroy the statues, my true self will detect it! If he descends, you’ll die without a burial ground!” The Eight Extreme Divinities threatened.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes narrowed, thinking to himself that he indeed guessed correctly!

There was indeed an extremely terrifying existence behind the Eight Extreme Divinities!

It was just that Ye Yuan did not know just how strong this existence was!

Ye Yuan’s silence made the Eight Extreme Divinities think that he was afraid.

Hence, he led him on skillfully with patience as he said,?“Huhu,?young man, you’re an ant, but you’re a powerful ant! Presumably, you already have some guesses that this world isn’t the end point! The outside world’s powerhouses aren’t what you can imagine at all! As long as you let this god plant an origin divinity will and become this god’s slave, then in the future, this god has a possibility of bringing you to leave this world! Do you know, without this god’s guidance, no living thing in this world can leave?!”

The Eight Extreme Divinities felt that this temptation was too great. Ye Yuan definitely would not be able to resist.

Reaching Ye Yuan’s realm, what other pursuits were there still?

Since he knew that there was an even grander and magnificent world outside, how could Ye Yuan not be moved?

Ye Yuan was still silent!

“Huhu,?I know what you’re thinking! However, you’re probably thinking too much, you can’t imagine my true self’s might at all! You think about it! To be able to toy with all of the Heavenspan World’s living creatures in the palm of his hands, how great is his power?! Therefore, give up on this! If he descends, this world will be annihilated!” The Eight Extreme Divinities increased the weight again as he said gloomily.

At this time, he recovered to that high and mighty appearance again, seemingly already regarding Ye Yuan as his servant.

And right at this time, Ye Yuan opened his mouth!

“Want me to become a servant, it’s also not that you can’t! But I have a condition!” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

The moment the Eight Extreme Divinities heard, he was overjoyed. But he still suppressed his emotions and said indifferently, “There’s nothing that can’t be done to my true self! Based on your worldview, he’s god! An omnipotent god! He is a true god! Not false gods like you all! What conditions do you have? Feel free to state them. With your insights, he can accomplish it with utmost ease!”

The Eight Extreme Divinities said it very calmly and collectedly as if everything was under control.

This attitude gave people an extremely convincing feeling.

Ye Yuan said calmly, “I have a friend whose soul had disintegrated, only left with a final wisp of spiritual consciousness that isn’t extinguished! Wonder if your true self can help her to regather her divine soul?”

The moment these words came out, over on the Eight Extreme Divinities’ side, he paused briefly.

But very soon, he said very calmly,?“Heh,

?this god said before, my true self is a real god, there’s nothing that can’t be done! Regathering the divine essence is harder than ascending to heaven to you all, lower realm ants. But to my true self, it’s merely a matter of lifting a hand! Boy, open up your origin divinity and await this god to plan my origin divinity will. I’ll naturally be able to help you!”

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s expression suddenly turned cold, and he said with a cold snort,?“Humph!?You don’t know what’s good for you, really take this Ye to be so easy to hoodwink? Looks like you don’t be honest! Since that’s the case, I’ll use force then!”

That slight pause betrayed the Eight Extreme Divinities.

Ye Yuan deliberately baited his words to inquire indirectly whether or not that person behind the Eight Extreme Divinities could regather the divine soul.

But unfortunately, it disappointed him again.

The Eight Extreme Divinities’ attitude clearly showed that that person could not do it!

A piercing cold sword intent suddenly erupted.

The Eight Extreme Divinities’ voice sounded extremely horrified, and he said, “D-Do you not want to live anymore? If you destroy the statue, all of you will have to die without a burial ground! My true self will really descend!”

The current Ye Yuan already could not be bothered to talk with him anymore.

He was in a bad mood!

“Is that so? If he comes, then I’ll make sure he doesn’t return!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

Right at this time, Universe Sword Formation suddenly launched!

That sword intent that pierced the horizon rushed toward the eight statues frenziedly.

The eight statues were not easy to deal with either. Their material was extremely tough, even the sword intent which fused four great rules was actually unable to break them within a short time too!

“Hahaha … lower realm ant! Do you think that based on your bit of strength, you’ll be able to break the statues? Dream on!” When the Eight Extreme Divinities saw the situation, he could not help being overjoyed.

He was very fearful of Ye Yuan. But at this time, he calmed down again.

As long as Ye Yuan could not breach the statues’ defenses, he would consume the power of the origin divinity and break the barrier of the world, transmitting the news back to his true self there!

At that time, Ye Yuan would definitely die without a burial ground!

The threat that Ye Yuan brought to him was too great, it already escaped his control!

Therefore, he had to request for his true self to descend!

But right at this time, Ye Yuan said indifferently,?“Oh??Is that so? Dual Polarity … Sword Formation!”

As soon as his voice faded, the Universe Sword Formation that was originally neutral and calm suddenly became unparalleledly swift and fierce!

Bang, bang, bang?…

One streak after another of terrifying sword intent directly ruptured the void, bombarding onto the statues crazily.

Universe Sword Formation was born from Universe. It could naturally evolve into Dual Polarity Sword Formation too!

The offensive power of Dual Polarity Sword Formation increased more than ten times when compared to Universe Sword Formation!

It was only to hear a series of terrifying sounds transmit over. Under the countless bombardments, the eight statues finally could not endure it and cracks began to appear!

“You … How did you do it? This … This is impossible! How can an ant possibly touch the boundary of a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse? This … This is absolutely impossible!” Eight Extreme Divinities’ voice carried an extremely horrified emotion.
