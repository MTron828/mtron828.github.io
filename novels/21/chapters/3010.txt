Chapter 3009: Unexpected Conclusion!

“Bai Zhi, Xuan Taiqing, the two of you stay for a while.”

The Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise, the three clans were just about to leave, but Mi Tian suddenly said.

Bai Zhi and Xuan Taiqing’s hearts tightened, immediately having a foreboding premonition.

Luan Qinghe let out a sigh of relief and did not care to look at the other two, directly slipping away.

“P-Progenitor Mi Tian, I wonder what you’re keeping the two of us behind for?” Bai Zhi clenched his teeth and asked.

“Oh,?it’s nothing, just asking a drop of blood essence from each of you.” Mi Tian said nonchalantly.

Bai Zhi was stupefied and said, “Progenitor, that’s overboard!”

A drop of blood essence was naturally nothing to a Hegemon Realm powerhouse.

But, to the true spirit race, this was a true spirit.

Each true spirit race had very strict control over blood essence, especially heaven qian grade bloodline.

Mi Tian directly asking for blood essence was actually violating a taboo of the true spirit race.

Mi Tian naturally was not asking for blood essence for himself. The true spirit race was unable to refine and fuse bloodlines with each other at all.

But, for Ye Yuan’s sake, Mi Tian did not care at all.

Mi Tian said coolly, “If there’s any problem, have Bai Ling and Xuan Qing come and find this progenitor. Or, do you guys want to make this progenitor do it myself?”

Bai Zhi’s expression was very ugly. He knew that he could not get through this today.

A drop of blood essence floated towards Mi Tian. Bai Zhi said in a cold voice, “Progenitor, you’ve just returned. It’s better to keep a low-profile in doing things! Hundreds of thousands of years have passed. The present situation is very different now!”

Mi Tian smiled and said, “Nothing is different. Whoever finds this progenitor displeasing to the eye, just bring it on. This progenitor will receive it all!”

Bai Zhi snorted coldly and immediately left.

After Xuan Taiqing handed over the blood essence, he left the Dragon Clan too.

“Progenitor, you … you’re actually still alive! That’s great! It’s really too great!” Long Jian was agitated until hot tears ran down his face, wishing to run up and hug Mi Tian.

The person that he idolized the most was not Mi Zhen, but this handsome middle-aged man in front of him.

In reality, the vast majority of the Dragon Clan was the same as him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Dragon Clan’s spiritual leader had never been Mi Zhen, but it was Mi Tian!

These people were all agitated until their faces turned red, virtually unable to speak.

Mi Tian smiled and said,?“Mn,

?I’m considered to have died once. Being able to come back, this progenitor feels pretty good too. Mi Zhen, it’s been hard on you for so many years.”

Mi Zhen’s gaze turned cold, and he said, “It’s Ye Yuan who brought you back?”

The expressions of all the Hegemons turned somber, immediately feeling that the atmosphere was not quite right.

Originally a moment where everyone was happy, why did Progenitor Mi Zhen have this attitude?

Mi Tian still had a light smile as he said, “You’re still so clever. But sadly, you’re a victim of your own cleverness!”

Mi Zhen snorted coldly and said, “I didn’t expect that even the ambush of three mighty Great Beyond Realms failed to kill you. Heaven really has no eyes!”

Mi Tian smiled and said, “If I didn’t run into Ye Yuan, I’d pretty much be a dead man now too. Or should I say, this is called Heaven took pity, letting me see your hypocritical face.”

The group of dragon clan members was confused from listening. Why were they ready to jump at each other’s throats all of a sudden?

The two great chaos true dragons had always been affectionate brothers. Why did it become like this after not seeing each other for several hundred thousand years?

Mi Zhen was too astute. The moment he laid eyes on Mi Tian, he knew that he had been exposed.

It was because Mi Tian came out of the Eternal River’s space!

And the moment he came out, he offended many powerhouses across the heavens for Ye Yuan’s sake.

Why would a Great Beyond Realm super overlord protect a junior like this?

Coupled with Blood Dragon Island’s matter, the truth was basically out already.

Mi Tian returned but used this kind of veiled method to get on the island. What did this indicate?

Who was he guarding against?

Of course it was him, Mi Zhen!

Hence, there was no need to continue pretending anymore.

This battle could not be avoided.

“Everyone back away,” Mi Tian said coolly.

Two astonishing auras rose up from Heavenly Dragon Island.

The expressions of the dragon race Hegemons changed greatly, knowing that this battle could not be avoided anymore, withdrawing one after another.

Mi Tian and Mi Zhen did not need to explain anything, nor did they put forward any proof.

As long as they understood in their heart, it would do.

“Your life is really tenacious! The blood race’s three mighty Great Beyond Realms joined hands and actually failed to kill you!” Mi Zhen said in a cold voice.

“It’s not that my life is tenacious, but that I’m strong enough! In this world, you know me the best. So you know my weakness. But you still underestimated me” Mi Tian said lightly.

“So what? Do you think that I’m still the old me?”

“Hur hur,?even Dragonsand had a foot stepped into Great Beyond. Of course you obtained more benefits than him. However, you used countless clansmen to become stronger. Will your heart really not ache?”

“Humph!?You suppressed me for countless tens of thousands of years. I’ve long grown impatient! You were merely born a million years earlier than me, that means that you can keep on pressing down on top of my head? I’m not willing!”

“So, you colluded with the blood race and lured a wolf into the house?”

“So what if it’s the blood race? We were merely making use of each other, that’s all!”

Mi Tian shook his head and said with a sigh, “You know too little about the blood race! The blood race is even more terrifying than you imagine!”

Mi Zhen laughed loudly and said, “Mi Tian, are you scaring me? Do you really think that by rebirthing in the Eternal River, you’ve cornered me?”

While talking, someone walked out of the island.

Every movement and action of this person transcended into sainthood and was vague and ephemeral.

When Mi Tian saw the arrival, his pupils could not help constricting: “It really is you!”

The arrival nodded and said with a smile, “Looks like you already know who I am.”

Mi Tian drew a deep breath and said, “You concealed so deeply!”

The arrival smiled and said, “That kid is very formidable! Even I am even somewhat apprehensive of him too.”

Mi Tian’s gaze turned cold, and he said, “You won’t have the chance!”

The arrival smiled. He did not speak.

Mi Zhen could not understand what they were talking about. But it did not matter anymore.

“Blood Two, join hands with me and kill him!” Mi Zhen said with a cold smile.

The arrival nodded his head and said, “Attack together!”

Mi Zhen laughed loudly and said, “Mi Tian, you shouldn’t have come back! The present me is no longer who I used to be a long time ago! Moreover, if I join hands with Blood Two, you won’t have a chance!”

Mi Tian did not express anything and was silent.

Crack, crack, crack?…

In the sky above Heavenly Dragon Island, lightning rampaged!

Two great chaos true dragons; what Mi Tian walked on was the path of space.

And what Mi Zhen walked on was the path of lightning.

His current overwhelming aura was not the slightest bit weaker than Mi Tian.

For so many years, he received the help of the blood race. His strength had long already advanced by leaps and bounds.

At the same time, Blood Two suddenly erupted.

Two mighty Great Beyond Realm powerhouses charged toward Mi Tian with astonishing momentum.

Mi Zhen laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha,?today, I’ll let you die again! The Dragon Clan’s only ruler is me, Mi Zhen!”

However, right at this time, Blood Two suddenly turned in the air. A terrifying to the extreme aura of eternal life smashed toward Mi Zhen.

Mi Zhen’s entire mind was placed on Mi Tian. How could he have expected such a sudden turn of events?

Boom!

The void shattered, and Mi Zhen’s colossal body directly smashed onto the ground, fresh blood spurting wildly.

Regarding this strike, Blood Two practically used his full strength. In addition, Mi Zhen was not guarding against him at all. The damage was too great.

Mi Zhen collapsed in the pool of blood, looking at Blood Two full of resentment.
