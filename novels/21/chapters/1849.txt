Chapter 1853: Seeking Battle

“Really didn’t expect that Younger Sister Qiuling actually spoke up for us at the last minute. Just now, I was really frightened badly. It doesn’t matter to me, but if I implicated you, I can’t forgive myself in this lifetime.”

Returning to the courtyard, Leng Xu felt lingering fear.

Previously, on the stage, saying that it was hanging on by a thread was also not over the top.

Even though Ye Yuan had spatial shift, facing a True God powerhouse, it was also impossible to easily escape.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “They won’t do anything to me.”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s indifferent look, Leng Xu said huffily, “You’re really reckless! Uncle he’s a True God powerhouse! But speaking of things, it’s also strange. My relationship with Young Sister Qiuling isn’t considered close. Why would she refute her own father’s face in front of so many people?”

Just as they were talking, a servant came to report, saying that Leng Qiuling came. This made Leng Xu stupefied again.

Leng Qiuling came leisurely, like a moving iceberg, emitting a proud and cold aura from head to toe.

Not seeing for several hundred years, Leng Qiuling’s transformation was very big.

It was not just the increase in strength, her disposition also underwent a drastic change.

Leng Qiuling back then was still just a junior.

But now, she already faintly had the bearing of someone in the upper echelons.

This was portrayed most vividly during the battle for young patriarch.

A casual sentence, but no one dared to refute it.

When Leng Xu saw Leng Qiuling, he went up to greet, saying: “Many thanks to Younger Sister Qiuling for helping us out of our predicament today. Otherwise, Ye Yuan and I would be in danger.”

Although he did not know why Leng Qiuling would come forward and speak up for him, thanks still had to be said.

It was merely a sentence to Leng Qiuling, but to him, it was a life-saving grace.

Faced with Leng Xu’s thanks, Leng Qiuling just said nonchalantly, “Big Brother Xu doesn’t need to be courteous. I was just saying a word of fairness.”

But her gaze went past Leng Xu and looked at the Ye Yuan behind him.

Leng Xu detected Leng Qiuling’s gaze and could not help being taken aback, turning his head and looking toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and opened his mouth and said, “Parting for years, Fairy Leng’s elegant appearance is even more radiant than back then!”

Leng Qiuling smiled faintly and said, “A scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes. Young Master Ye really broadened my horizons today! I want to apologize to Young Master Ye and take back the words I said back then.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s all past matters, mention it for what? Today, this Ye still have to thank Fairy Leng for resolving my predicament!”

Leng Qiuling shook her head and said, “I believe that there is no need for me to get you out of the fix. Young Master Ye also has a way to get out of trouble.”

Although she did not know Ye Yuan’s means, if Father wanted to keep Ye Yuan behind, it likely would not be that easy.

Ye Yuan was not that kind of reckless person. Since he mixed into the Leng Family’s dispute, he definitely had some reliance.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Although I only had the pleasure of meeting Fairy Leng once, Fairy Leng seems like this Ye’s old friend of many years, knowing me like the back of your hand. However, I still have to thank you.”

By the side, Leng Xu was long dumbfounded from listening.

It turned out that Leng Qiuling and Ye Yuan were actually old acquaintances.

It was just that he was very curious, the two people’s conversation sounded very familiar, but was also not very familiar.

It seemed like they merely only happened to have met once.

But this brief one-time encounter could actually make Leng Qiuling behave contrary to her normal behavior, and refute her own father’s face?

Furthermore, Leng Qiuling actually smiled!

She smiled at Ye Yuan!

In Leng Xu’s impression, he had never seen Leng Qiuling smile at a guy before.

The shock in Leng Xu’s heart could be imagined.

“Then Young Master Ye’s thanks, Qiuling will accept it. Qiuling has a presumptuous request. I wonder if Young Master Ye can agree or not?” Leng Qiuling said.

Ye Yuan nodded and smiled as he said, “Fairy Leng’s request, how can this Ye dare to not agree?”

Leng Qiuling’s gaze suddenly became sharp and she said, “Qiuling wishes to have a battle with Sir. I hope that Sir will agree to it.”

Hearing this, Ye Yuan and Leng Xu were both taken aback.

Leng Xu was incomparably surprised. As the Thousand Soar Mansion’s peerless genius, Leng Qiuling could not find an opponent among peers at all.

Her opponents had always been those very senior disciples in Thousand Soar Mansion, their realms were also mostly higher than hers.

Now, she actually wanted to challenge a Second Firmament Celestial Deity.

Of course, Ye Yuan’s strength, Leng Xu admired it greatly too.

At least, he was not his match.

But, to face Leng Qiuling, it was still not enough.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Okay!”

...

“Roar of Ice!”

“Ice Dragon Howling Sky!”

“Spirit Concealing Sword!”

On the stage, two figures fought fiercely without rest. For some time, it was actually hard to distinguish who was superior or inferior.

Ye Yuan relied on law fusion and actually forcefully managed to fight to a draw with Leng Qiuling.

Below the stage, Leng Xu watched until he was dumbfounded, mouth gaping.

“Turns out that Ye Yuan’s strength is actually powerful to such a level already! When he was practicing his sword on me, he didn’t even use 10% of his strength!” Leng Xu murmured.

For him to be able to have a breakthrough in power of laws within ten days, it was entirely because of Ye Yuan’s wringing-style training.

Back then, Leng Xu felt that Ye Yuan was very strong, but did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually strong to the extent where he could battle with Leng Qiuling.

Although Ye Yuan was at a disadvantage, he had just entered Second Firmament Celestial Deity!

Such a monstrous Leng Qiuling was actually leapfrogged and battled by someone.

By the side, Leng Hongxiu was similarly incomparably shocked.

His daughter’s position in the Thousand Soar Mansion, he knew it like the palm of his own hand.

It had always been his daughter jumping realms and challenging others. It was still his first time seeing someone jump realms to challenge his daughter.

Seeing this scene, he was even more certain of Leng Qiuling’s speculation.

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Two figures separated upon contact, each retreating away.

Fine beads of sweat actually seeped out on Leng Qiuling’s forehead.

And Ye Yuan also had a rare episode of panting.

Fighting Leng Qiuling was still too forceful to the current him.

Leng Qiuling’s expression was icy-cold, but the shock in her heart could not use words to describe at all.

For the first time in her life, she knew what was called a feeling of setback.

Recalling when she met Ye Yuan back then, she had once said that Ye Yuan and her were destined to not be people in the same world.

But several hundred years had passed, this sentence appeared so feeble. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Although he was still somewhat inferior in terms of strength, without a doubt, Ye Yuan already arrived at her world.

This was indisputable!

Furthermore, developing in accordance with this trend, Ye Yuan surpassing her was merely a matter of time.

It was just that Leng Qiuling could not figure out no matter what, why such a peerlessly talented character would be stuck at grand completion Origin Deity Realm for as long as 300 years.

Thinking about it now, this was simply something beyond comprehension.

“Fairy Leng is indeed well-deserving of being a peerless genius. This Ye concedes defeat!” Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said.

This fight just now, he had indeed lost.

However, Leng Qiuling shook her head and said, “Young Master Ye didn’t go all out, so how can you say that you’re defeated? If it were a deathmatch, who will emerge victoriously is not yet known!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Isn’t Fairy Leng the same too? In the end, it’s still that I’m not strong enough.”

Not a life-and-death match, everyone normally would not bring out their 100% strength.

Really reaching that point, that would be the moment of either you die or I perish already. Wanting to pull back would be very difficult.
