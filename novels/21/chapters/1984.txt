Chapter 1988: Storming the Bone Devil Army

With Ye Yuan leading the charge, the team’s advancing speed was extremely fast.

In places where the Stellar War Banner arrived at, there were piles of broken bones.

Those people who entered with Zhou Yu before, they felt like the situation was completely different.

It was too easy along the way!

Although it was still very dangerous, it was way too different compared to the last time.

With Ye Yuan overpowering the enemies all the way, the pressure that went onto every person’s body did not have much left.

With 70 Fourth Firmament True Gods, this force was absolutely powerful enough, practically advancing unreasonably all the way.

“If we knew long ago, we’d have waited a while and entered with Brother Ye!”

“Brother Ye’s strength is really too terrifying! Doesn’t he know fatigue?”

“Hahaha, awesome! We were pursued badly by this bunch of skeletons the last time. This time, I can finally hold my chin up high.”

...

In the last battle, Zhou Yu wanted to use others as shields and naturally refused to charge in front.

Hence, everyone was the point of attack.

Those bone devils attacked without discrimination; they naturally collapsed in disorder.

But this time, Ye Yuan attracted the vast majority of the firepower. They only supported through coordinated actions from the sides, it was naturally much easier.

In addition, this time, the strength in numbers had a very large increase compared to last time.

Hence, they naturally did not feel much pressure all the way until now.

At the back of the team, Zhou Yu’s rod was brandished like the wind, but the shock in his heart was unable to be described using words at all.

In the beginning, he harbored the attitude of gloating over others’ misfortune. This degree of consumption, Ye Yuan could not hold out for very long at all.

But more than two hours passed in a blink. Ye Yuan still seemed like he was on stimulants. He seemingly was at his peak state, without the slightest sign of declining at all.

Zhou Yu was aware of this; if he continued this level of fighting, he could not sustain for such a long time at all.

Was this fellow still human?

However, it was also not smooth-sailing along the way.

The further in, the stronger the bone devils. Fourth Firmament True God bone devils became more and more.

By then, some bone devils’ strengths were already extremely close to Fifth Firmament True God.

Even Ye Yuan also felt rather strained.

The speed of the team’s advancement slowed down, casualties also slowly started appearing.

Those children of destiny also did not have the composure from before anymore.

In the end, Ye Yuan simply gave up on the Stellar War Banner and directly fired out one Life and Death Seal after another.

Although the Stellar War Banner was an empyrean spirit treasure, it was unable to unleash its true power in Ye Yuan’s hands at all.

His realm was too low!

In terms of power, the power of the Life and Death Seal was a great deal stronger.

Of course, the Life and Death Seal’s consumption of divine essence was also enormous.

Even with his divine essence purity, it was still somewhat struggling to make ends meet.

Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately swallowed several divine essence recovery medicinal pills.

“Everyone, don’t hold back anymore! Hurry up and use whatever moves you have! Otherwise, we’ll all have to die here! There’s only a distance of several thousand feet away from the bone mountain already. Everyone, double up!” Ye Yuan said in a clear voice.

He understood in his heart that apart from their squad, this team were all harboring ulterior motives.

Many people did not use their full strength at all. They were still saving their killing move, waiting to snatch the emperor bone at the end!

A quick glance around, they already rushed to the foot of the bone mountain. The surroundings were virtually all Fourth Firmament True God bone devils.

It was already impossible to want to turn back.

In their current states, there was no divine essence to let them kill their way back at all.

No path to retreat, then there was only advancing!

Those one Life and Death Seal after another of Ye Yuan made everyone stare dumbfounded with their mouths agape.

There was actually still such a play?

When everyone fought, they normally would not release big moves unless it was an absolute last resort.

But Ye Yuan threw out one big move after another like it was free. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The key thing was that Ye Yuan could actually really release so many.

Was this guy ... really a Second Firmament True God?

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

Tragic screams rose and ebbed, the casualties in the team were exacerbating.

The speed that the team was advancing became slower. The bone devils that they had to face naturally became more and more.

Furthermore, the strength of the bone devils got stronger and stronger, many people could not bear it.

Even Ye Yuan also gradually started to despair.

He did not think that the strengths of these bone devils at the back were actually powerful to such an extent.

Even if he used Sword Hollow Etch, it was also impossible to eradicate clean all at once!

“What to do, Brother Ye?” Song Yu forced back a bone devil and gritted his teeth and asked.

“What else can we do? Continue charging!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

This distance of several hundred feet in front of them was simply as far as the horizon despite being so near.

It was just that, so what even if rushed up the bone mountain?

Could it be that these bone devils would not chase after?

After reaching on top of the bone mountain, it would be even more hopeless!

100 feet!

90 feet!

...

30 feet!

20 feet!

10 feet!

Ye Yuan’s divine essence was being rapidly depleted. Finally, he suddenly fired out a Life and Death Seal, directly blasting away the bone devils in front of him.

Ahead was the bone mountain!

Ye Yuan suddenly dashed, rushing straight out of the bone devil army, and climbing up the bone mountain.

But he did not go up the mountain himself, but turned around and fired out a few more Life and Death Seals, helping Song Yu they all to charge out.

“Assist everyone!” Ye Yuan said without thinking after saving Song Yu.

Ye Yuan was not a goody-two-shoes, but he had his own principles.

Without these people, he could not barge through this bone devil army by himself too.

Now that he stormed over himself, he naturally could not stand by and not rescue those in danger.

Following that, one child of destiny after another charged out.

After the last person charged out, Ye Yuan already made the preparations to make one last desperate effort.

Who knew that at this time, that endless bone devil army actually scattered into piles of bones at this time.

The originally incomparably noisy wilderness suddenly became incomparably quiet.

This transition from commotion to quiet was extremely sudden, making everyone extremely not used to it.

But very soon, everyone’s faces revealed looks of wild elation.

“Hahaha! We finally cleared it! Damn! I even thought that I’d be dead for sure this time!”

“Isn’t that so? Facing many same realm bone devils at the same time, this kind of battle is really exhilarating!”

“All thanks to Brother Ye. If not for him resisting the vast majority of the bone devils by himself, we’d probably have long died out.”

...

They faced quite a few alone, while Ye Yuan practically faced more than a dozen, or even more, by himself.

He kept on charging at the forefront. It was equivalent to being a sharp blade. The enemies encountered were naturally also the most.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan’s fighting style without regard for his life also repelled a large group of bone devils.

It was because of this that there were only some remaining bone devils left for the others to handle. The pressure naturally reduced significantly.

Everyone understood in their hearts that if not for Ye Yuan, they would have long been completely annihilated. No one could think about getting out alive.

There was a wave of laughter and gaily chatting.

But Ye Yuan did not smile.

On the contrary, he had a solemn look on his face right now.

“What’s wrong, Brother Ye?” Song Yu asked. He was currently rejoicing, but then he saw Ye Yuan’s solemn look, immediately reining in his smile.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “These bone devils were clearly controlled by the emperor bone. If this is his last measure, he should stop us at all costs. But ... this bone devil army completely scattered!”

One sentence made everyone’s heart turn cold.

And right at this time, on top of the bone mountain, another skeleton ... slowly stood up.

Yes, just one!

But everyone’s eyes immediately became wide-saucers. The feeling called despair was spreading in everyone’s hearts.
