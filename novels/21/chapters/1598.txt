Chapter 1602 Hundred Years of Dao Enlightenmen

The prime of youth easily passed. Time flashed by. In a blink, over ten years passed.

On this day, a spatial ripple occurred in the spatial node once again.

Coldfeather’s entire body trembled all over, suddenly snapping open both eyes and staring fixedly at Ye Yuan.

“Impossible! It’s just been over ten years, and he actually already comprehended late-stage first-layered heaven spatial laws?”

Coldfeather kind of doubted whether just now was a misconception or not. One had to know, he was also merely late-stage first-layered heaven currently!

Back then, he spent over ten thousand years and comprehended to this step, and even patted himself on the back, feeling quite satisfied.

After all, entering the spatial inheritance, there was only him who could survive.

However, this guy in front of him whose hair was not even fully grown yet was actually already keeping up with him!

Coldfeather was instantly flustered.

These few years, he had no lack of reproving Ye Yuan.

It was not that he wanted to scheme on something, but it was just that he felt that Ye Yuan was wasting his life.

He felt that Ye Yuan would come to regret it one day.

But now, he discovered that he was so ignorant.

He only used over a decade’s time and went from middle-stage to late-stage!

This disparity could only use the difference like cloud and mud to describe it.

What was this called?

There would not be harm without comparison!

Finally, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes. His eyes also faintly revealed excitement.

Spatial laws were indeed entirely different from the laws that he comprehended in the past; too difficult!

The Heavenspan World’s spatial structure was on a completely different level from the Immortal Grove World.

Space was the foundation to give rise to myriad life. It was one of the forms of this world’s most fundamental source.

If there wasn’t space, whatever Sword Dao laws, whatever laws of fire, whatever laws of wind, they would not have the foundation to exist at all.

The more he comprehended, the more Ye Yuan felt its extensiveness and profoundness.

“You ... You broke through?” Although he knew the answer, Coldfeather still could not resist asking.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “So many years of hard work finally wasn’t in vain! But what you said is right. The difficulty of spatial laws indeed exceeded my imaginations! Most likely, I can’t go out within a short time.”

Ye Yuan did not fear the danger of the chaotic space. It was just that not going out within a short time, he was rather worried about Li-er they all.

But Ye Yuan was still reassured of things with Xuan Yu around. This person’s personality was warm, and both master and disciples also received considerable benefits from him. Presumably, he should take care of Li-er they all.

Coldfeather swallowed his saliva, feeling rather parched as he said gloomily, “This is spatial law, even if one’s talent is heaven-defying, I’ve also never heard before being able to breakthrough within such a short time! How did you do it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Actually, it’s also an accident that I could comprehend spatial laws. It’s because I cultivated Sword Dao laws to a transcendent realm that I drew parallels from inference, and accidentally comprehended spatial laws.”

Coldfeather’s gaze turned intent and he said in surprise, “So ... each time you enter the chaotic space, it’s actually entering the space to comprehend spatial laws with Sword Dao?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, considered to have tacitly acknowledged it.

Coldfeather never thought that there was actually someone capable of comprehending spatial laws through this kind of method.

Drawing parallels from inference, he naturally knew. But comprehending other laws with this kind of method was normally all lower-level laws.

It was still his first time hearing of someone being able to comprehend a higher-order law through a lower-order law!

Although Sword Dao laws were formidable, compared to spatial laws, it was a long way off.

Ye Yuan smiled and said to Coldfeather with clasped hands, “Brother Coldfeather, I’m going in. If I can comprehend it one day, I’ll bring you out!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan took out the Junyi Sword, leaped, and entered the chaotic space once more, leaving behind Coldfeather with a dazed look.

Suddenly, Coldfeather’s entire body started trembling. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

What did he say just now?

I ... I can go out?

I, Coldfeather, actually have a day where I can still go back!

In these hundred over thousand years, Coldfeather had long given up on hopes of going out already.

He thought that he would slowly grow old inside this cold space and slowly die.

But one day, a young man ran in front of him and said, “I’ll bring you out!”

This kind of agitation, who could understand?

If Ye Yuan said these sorts of words when he just came in, Coldfeather would definitely turn his nose up in contempt and ridicule the other party’s ignorance.

In reality, he also did so.

But now, Coldfeather really saw hope!

If he developed according to this momentum, perhaps Ye Yuan could really comprehend spatial laws?

Coldfeather discovered that he, this so-called genius, was on a completely different level from Ye Yuan.

Not just comprehension ability, also tenacity and heart of Martial Dao!

Coldfeather knew that this kind of cultivation was completely dreary and tasteless.

Being able to go up a level, one would definitely somewhat relax their thinking.

But Ye Yuan did not even stop for a second and plunge into training once more.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan narrowly escaped death inside the chaotic space. After treating it, he would enter the chaotic space once more without hesitation.

But him?

He was still afraid!

He had come to terms with death!

But Ye Yuan became more courageous in the face of setbacks. He could defeat his heart of fear.

...

Time flew by quickly. In a twinkle, another 20 years passed.

Inside the chaotic space, Ye Yuan’s figure was akin to an illusion, flashing erratically.

Suddenly, he stopped in a region of space, his brows tightly locked.

“My first-layered heaven spatial laws had already been perfected for quite a while now. But this second-layered heaven, I keep failing to find the breakthrough point. Second-layered heaven, just what is it?” Ye Yuan muttered to himself.

Spatial inheritance, the inheritances left behind were exceedingly few. The people who knew its profundities were even in the minority.

Ye Yuan entered first-layered heaven spatial laws by stumbling about blindly.

But this second-layered heaven, he kept failing to comprehend it.

Ye Yuan’s gaze suddenly landed on the space above his head.

There was his reflection.

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up, a hint of understanding flashed across in his heart.

...

A hundred years in a flash, this was an extremely short time to any Deity Realm powerhouse.

But to Ye Yuan, it was like the sea had changed into a mulberry field.

After rebirthing, all of his cultivation time added together was also merely a short hundred over years.

But comprehending spatial laws actually used a hundred years of his time.

On this day, Ye Yuan was in closed-seclusion in the spatial node.

All of a sudden, the entire space started trembling.

The originally incomparably stable spatial node actually had signs of collapsing too.

Coldfeather was greatly alarmed and said, “What happened? Mn? Ye Yuan he ... he comprehended the laws?”

Coldfeather looked over towards Ye Yuan and discovered that Ye Yuan was clearly right in front of him, but was so unreal.

This kind of feeling was contradictory to the extreme.

In these 100 years, Ye Yuan’s growth, he took it all into his sights and had long prostrated on all fours in admiration already.

He finally knew that there was an insurmountable gulf between him and Ye Yuan.

Genius was already insufficient to describe this young man.

But even so, he also did not think that this day actually came so quickly!

Rumble ...

The spatial node started collapsing, fragmenting into countless pieces. A terrifying energy undulation squeezed over toward Coldfeather.

Coldfeather’s expression changed and he cried out in alarm, “Ye Yuan ... s-save me!”
