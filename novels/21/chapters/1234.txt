Chapter 1238: You Guys Move Aside, Let Me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Big Brother, where should we go this time?”

Seeing Ye Yuan come out of comprehending the array formation, White Light could not resist going up to ask.

While at this time, three days had already passed since they entered this second space!

This second step, Ye Yuan actually used three times the time of the first step.

Actually, the way White Light and Yue Mengli saw it, the scenery before their eyes was exactly the same as the first step. There was no difference at all.

But it was precisely because so that the difficulty of studying the array formation was even greater.

“Center!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan walked in from that path in the middle without the least bit of hesitation.

White Light and Yue Mengli did not dare to dawdle, following closely behind.

For the third step space, Ye Yuan used six days’ time before comprehending fully.

But fourth step space, Ye Yuan used a full half a month’s time!

White Light did not dare to interrupt Ye Yuan’s comprehension and could not resist grumbling to Li-er softly, “My God! At the rate of this speed, when we get out, the fiend race would probably have long unified the Divine Realm already!”

Actually, Li-er was also weighed down with worry. It was just that she did not express it out like White Light.

A month’s time had already gone by now, they had not even walked out of the fourth step space.

This kind of speed was not much faster than a tortoise crawling either.

At this rate, it was really as White Light said, even if they went out, it would also be too late already.

But she also knew that the Formations Dao profundities that this divine rank grand array contained was too complicated and disorderly. Wanting to thoroughly comprehend was not so easily achieved.

One could tell from the first step space, who knew how many traps were hidden inside this grand array.

Ye Yuan needed to identify carefully before he could ensure the safety of the next step.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan, who was currently meditating with his eyes closed, opened both eyes and walked over towards a cluster of peach blossoms.

Fifth step space, Yue Mengli duo thought that Ye Yuan needed to spend even more time to ascertain the next step’s action.

However, they did not expect that Ye Yuan only used two hours and took action.

“Big Brother Yuan, what’s happening here? Could it be that ... you’ve already cracked the array formation?” Yue Mengli said in astonishment.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “How can cracking the array formation be easy? But wanting to pass through this peach blossom forest shouldn’t pose a problem anymore!”

This one month plus of comprehension could be said to be advancing by leaps and bounds for Ye Yuan’s Formations Dao attainments.

Divine Dao array formations were hard to understand. If somebody else was here, they probably could not even accomplish learning the rudiments.

But Ye Yuan’s Formations Dao level had long already reached the threshold of Divine Dao.

Lu Linfeng’s Formations Path Nine Scripts’ ninth level was a true Divine Dao array formation!

That was why Ye Yuan and Lu Linfeng’s Formations Dao great battle that day, when Lu Linfeng was prepared to use the ninth level, Ye Yuan took the initiative to admit defeat.

This time, Li-er was almost killed by the grand array. But it thoroughly stimulated Ye Yuan, maximizing his potential to the greatest limits.

This one month’s time, Ye Yuan devoted his entirety to comprehending and finally took that last step, comprehending Divine Dao array formation laws.

Although extremely shallow, it opened up a brand new world to Ye Yuan.

This way, the speed of Ye Yuan cracking this peach blossom array formation was countless times faster than before.

Ten days later, the three people only felt a blur before their eyes. The scenery before their eyes finally changed for the first time.

This one month plus time, it was peach blossoms as far as their eyes could see. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

No matter how beautiful the scenery, aesthetic fatigue appeared too.

Moreover, even though the peach blossoms were beautiful, it concealed killing intent.

Especially White Light, he was almost about to puke from looking at the peach blossoms.

“This damn peach blossom forest, this little lord, I, am never entering inside again! In the future, as long as I see a peach blossom forest, this little lord will definitely burn it!” White Light said with a gloomy look.

This one month plus time, he was really almost going insane.

Because the scenery of every space was all completely identical.

No matter which space he walked to, it was all those three paths in front of him.

This guy who laid down the formation was simply a pervert.

“Eh, what’s this place? It’s so beautiful, simply like a paradise!” Yue Mengli suddenly said in surprise.

Puhwark!

White Light finally could not resist and vomited large mouthfuls.

Ye Yuan and Li-er exchanged a glance, and both could not resist laughing out loud.

Logically speaking, it was absolutely impossible for White Light this kind of powerhouse to vomit. But the psychological impact this one month plus had on him was seriously too great.

White Light rolled his eyes and said unhappily, “You guys are still laughing! I’m warning you, you’re absolutely not allowed to say ‘peach blossom,’ these two words, in front of me in the future ... Bleurgh!”

After a bout of joking around, the three people finally sized up this area in front of them.

This place was indeed like a paradise; green hills and clear waters, beautiful scenery.

Most importantly, this place was full of essence energy. It was not inferior to the Divine Realm’s super holy lands.

“Big Brother Yuan, this place doesn’t look like the Godsfall Mountain Range! Could it be that we returned to the Divine Realm?” Li-er said curiously.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Doesn’t look like it! I feel that this place is another independent space, just like the Soul Refining Sect space; independent outside of the Divine Realm.”

“Is it possible that this place is also a certain Divine Dao sect’s ruins? Looking at this appearance, it’s not that kind of heretic path sect. It shouldn’t be dangerous, right?” White Light finally stopped puking and came up to interject.

“That’s not necessarily. The more beautiful the place, the more dangerous it may be. This one month plus, haven’t you experienced it as well?” Ye Yuan said.

White Light’s expression changed, the optimism from before swept clean immediately.

Yeah, inside this Godsfall Mountain Range, would there be a not-dangerous place?

“Big Brother, how about we go back?” White Light said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If we could go back, why would I spend one month plus to barge through the formation? This array formation is one-directional. Being able to walk out is already a miracle. Want to turn back, not unless the person who laid down the formation personally lead the way.”

“This ... What to do here?” White Light said depressedly.

“Since we came, might as well stay and make the best of it. Why not go in and take a look. Maybe there are some unexpected harvests,” Ye Yuan said.

The party moved carefully between the mountains and rivers, but they did not encounter any dangers. This made the three people’s hearts relaxed slightly.

Moving past a mountain, what surprised them was that there were actually several figures that intruded into their sights.

“Big Brother, there are people! Seems to be ... demon race! Odd, why would there be demons here?” White Light said wonderingly.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he was similarly incomparably bewildered.

Far away, several demons were currently sparring with each other, fighting in full swing.

This independent space actually still had the demon race that existed!

Those few people clearly also discovered Ye Yuan and co. on top of the mountain, their figures moving, speeding over here.

Ye Yuan and the rest were just thinking of going up to say hello, but they did not expect that those few demons’ faces changed. They said fiercely, “It’s humans! How can humans appear?! Kill!”

Those few people gave them no chance to explain and actually directly chose to attack.

White Light and Li-er were just about to make a move but was stopped by Ye Yuan.

“Let them hit. Not being aware of this place’s depths, better not to make a move. You guys move aside. Let me deal with this,” Ye Yuan said coolly.
