Chapter 2504: Taking Advantage of the Situation to Profit?

Everything seemed to have already settled down.

But right at this time, Tian Qing moved!

The divine race’s five great Dao Ancestors flashed and surrounded Ye Yuan tightly!

Regarding this, Ye Yuan did not seem to care and said indifferently, “You guys can’t make me stay!”

Tian Qing said in a solemn voice, “I know! But this ancestor will use your human race’s trillions of lives as a bargaining chip to force you to have a battle with the five of us! If you don’t fight, the five of us will go on a killing spree!”

The air suddenly went quiet!

The human race powerhouses had not caught their breath yet and their nerves were immediately wound up tightly again.

Tian Qing’s asphyxiating killing intent made everyone understand that this was not a joke!

If Ye Yuan refused, Tian Qing would definitely go on a killing spree!

The divine race’s five great Dao Ancestors combining forces, this line-up was too terrifying!

Especially that there were also two great Ten-marks powerhouses among them!

“This … What to do here? If it’s Tian Qing alone, it’s still alright. But they have two great Ten-marks Dao Ancestors!”

“Despicable! Shameless! How … How can they use such a shameless method to force Lord Saint Azure?”

“It’s over! This time, it’s completely over! To fight is to die; not fighting is also death!”

… …

From start to end, the divine race’s pressure had always been there.

The two great Ten-marks Dao Ancestors, no one could ignore their existence.

The divine race’s top powerhouses were too strong!

But no one expected that the divine race actually used such a despicable method to force Ye Yuan to answer the challenge.

When Lin Chaotian saw this scene, he could not resist letting out a wild laugh as he said,?“Hahaha?… Ye Yuan, this time, I see how you’ll still be arrogant! Aren’t you very arrogant? Aren’t you very condescending? Aren’t you known as the number one person through the ages? Hahaha …”

Lin Chaotian seemed to be in a crazed state, his face was full of delight.

Ye Yuan crippled him, crippling all of his hopes!

He hated Ye Yuan!

He wished to eat Ye Yuan whole!

Now, Ye Yuan aroused the divine race’s dread, not scrupling to use the common people of the world as a bargaining chip to force Ye Yuan to face the enemy head-on!

This result was what he would like to see the most.

He was not Ye Yuan’s match, but the divine race’s five ancestor added together was!

The strengths of these five ancestors were above Dao Ancestors to begin with.

Now that they corroborated their Dao to become ancestors, their strength could not be mentioned in the same breath even more.

Ye Yuan would have to die!

“Noisy!” Tian Qing gave a cold snort and conveniently flung a slap over. Lin Chaotian was directly struck until his mouth was full of blood.

He wanted to laugh but could not laugh anymore.

This scene seemed very comical.

But nobody laughed.

Because they could not laugh.

The pressure brought by the five ancestors was too great.

Right now, as long as Ye Yuan said a word of ‘no,’ the five ancestors would definitely go on a massacre!

Being surrounded by five ancestors, Ye Yuan was still very calm and said indifferently, “Human and divine, two races, each occupying half of the world like this now. Is it not good?”

Tian Qing frowned and said frankly, “You make this ancestor afraid! Each day that you’re around, this ancestor will find it hard to eat and sleep!”

After becoming Dao Ancestor, Tian Qing’s imposing aura that showed disdain for all under heaven had returned anew.

He was confident that there was no one who could threaten him in this world anymore.

Even if Lin Chaotian was conferred ancestor a second time, Tian Qing’s strength also skyrocketed. Lin Chaotian dreaded the latter too.

But now, Tian Qing could not sit still any longer!

The strength that Ye Yuan exhibited had somewhat gotten out of his control.

He did not know whether Ye Yuan would become even stronger or not!

At that time, it would simply be a devastating blow to the divine race!

Ye Yuan turned to Yue Mengli and said, “You want to fight too?”

Yue Mengli hesitated for a bit, but in the end, she still nodded her head slowly.

She was very agonized being caught in the middle.

But she still chose to fight.

Ye Yuan heaved a long sigh and said, “Since that’s the case, let’s fight then!”

Ye Yuan answering the challenge, the group of powerhouses heaved sighs of relief one after another.

Sure enough, Lord Saint Azure’s name of sainthood was not in vain.

But it was also merely letting out a sigh of relief.

Not that they had no confidence in Ye Yuan, but that the strength of the five ancestors was too strong!

“No way! Are you bullying our human race for not having anyone? Since it’s a group battle, then count this ancestor in too!”

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets suddenly spoke up, his eyes sweeping toward the crowd and he said with a cold snort, “When are the few of you going to be cowardly tortoises until?! If Ye Yuan is defeated, can you all stand aloof without paying attention to others?”

The direction that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was looking at was precisely where the few former Dao Ancestors were at!

They had their auras converged all along, hiding in the crowd.

Among the previous generation Dao Ancestors, Ancestor Fire was dead, Ancestor Water was dead, and Lin Chaotian was crippled.

In the Heavenspan Mountain, because of fighting for the rule crystals, Dao Ancestors Earth, Light, and Darkness were killed.

But there were still three people there.

They did not have that fate and failed to be conferred ancestor again this time. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

But they were former Dao Ancestors after all. Furthermore, after undergoing the baptism of the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, they were Dao Ancestor-level powerhouses too.

At this time, how could they keep out of the affair?

In the crowd, the few great former Dao Ancestors were all silent.

Suddenly, Dao Ancestor Destruction stepped forward and said smilingly, “Want this ancestor to take action? Can! But I have a condition! The fire rule crystal is mine! Furthermore, you must swear a Heavenly Dao Oath that after this, you’ll forgive this ancestor’s past misdeeds!”

Dao Ancestor Destruction was not stupid either. He knew that even after obtaining the fire rule crystal, he was not Ye Yuan’s match too. So he took a preventive measure in advance.

With him saying that, Ancestor Lightning and Ancestor Wind lost composure.

While the human race powerhouses were in an uproar.

“Shameless! Really shameless! This guy is actually taking advantage of the situation at this time to profit!”

“Heh,?really our fine Dao Ancestors! Why don’t he and Lin Chaotian go and die?”

“Taking a look now, it’s better for Dao Ancestors to be arranged by Lord Saint Azure! After all, the people that he brought out are all loyal and brave individuals!”

… …

Dao Ancestor Destruction’s actions immediately attracted a wave of scorn.

It was just that he did not care!

As long as he could be conferred ancestor a second time, he did not care what others thought at all!

While Ancestor Lightning and Ancestor Wind were a little hesitant.

After all, there was only a fire rule crystal that was vacant.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ expression was livid as he shouted angrily, “Hou Sheng, you despicable villain! Already at this point and you actually still wanted to loot a burning house!”

Dao Ancestor Destruction smiled and said, “Every man for himself! Moreover, this ancestor taking action is also for humanity’s cardinal principles of righteousness in itself too! Why not give consideration to both?!”

When Hou Sheng was talking, his face did not turn red and his heart did not race, he was actually not the least bit ashamed.

His world outlook was different from Ye Yuan and the rest in the first place.

The dissidence of opinion made it useless to talk!

He was dead sure that Ye Yuan had to give in. That was why he said this.

After all, no matter who it was, facing the divine race’s five ancestors, there was only the path of retreating.

A fight to the death would only be you dying!

“No need! None of you guys need to take action!”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan who was in the midst of the five ancestors spoke up calmly.

And his figure also instantly left the encirclement, arriving in front of Hou Sheng.

He looked at Hou Sheng with a mocking look and said with a smile, “You want the fire rule crystal?”

Hou Sheng’s expression changed drastically and he fell back repeatedly and said stammeringly, “I-If you dare to harm this ancestor, you absolutely won’t be the five ancestor’s match!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Is that so? To be able to put such vile and despicable words in such a dignified and high-sounding way, you’re really impressive! Therefore, you can die already!”

A sword light flashed past. Blood sealed the throat!
