Chapter 1770 Set Up

“Hahaha, Brother Ye’s alchemy skills have truly reached the acme of perfection! In my view, with your strength, there’s no problem passing ‘Ask Not’!”

In the restaurant, a demon race youth faced Ye Yuan, a flattering look on his face.

Ye Yuan took a sip of wine and said coolly, “Brother Blackpupil’s words are flattering a little too over the top. During these 50 million years, only 11 people have cleared ‘Ask Not.’ Your words are pushing me into the fire pit!”

Blackpupil seemed slightly awkward as he laughed and said, “Haha, no matter what, Brother Ye’s alchemy standards are the most formidable that I, Blackpupil, have seen to this day! If not for you, it’s probably impossible for me to break through to late-stage rank four within a short time!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Blackpupil is too modest. With your talent, I was merely adding flowers to embroidery.”

Ye Yuan made a compliment very deftly. Blackpupil was indeed very pleased with himself.

“Heh, to talk about talent, if I, Blackpupil, admits to being second in Tiger Bright Imperial City, no one will identify as first!” Blackpupil said with a proud face.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said in strong agreement, “This Ye just arrived here. But I heard that there’s still a pretty talented one in the city? What’s he called again?”

Blackpupil’s expression changed, but he still said, “White Light!”

“Right, right, called White Light! I heard that that punk overestimated his own ability and actually wanted to compete with Brother Blackpupil!” Ye Yuan said with an unhappy look.

Blackpupil’s expression was slightly unnatural as he shook his head and said with a sigh, “What’s Brother Ye saying? White Light is my close brother! He’s currently thrown in prison. I’m also very pained about it!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard this, he was unhappy. His face turned sullen as he said, “Heh, Brother Blackpupil is treating me as an outside! Forget it, forget it, don’t talk about this at this time. This wine is also pretty much drunk, this Ye will take his leave first.”

As he said, Ye Yuan was really going to get up and leave.

Blackpupil got a fright and hurriedly pulled Ye Yuan and said, “Don’t, don’t! Brother Ye, it was all Blackpupil’s fault, let’s sit down and slowly talk, slowly talk!”

Ye Yuan sat down with an unhappy look and said, “Blackpupil, I felt that your talent is pretty good. That’s why I made friends with you. Do you think that just anybody is qualified to become friends with me?”

Before coming, Ye Yuan already had Jin Hua spread that word, saying that he could refine level nine medicinal pills.

Prior to this, Ye Yuan already refined a medicinal pill and helped Blackpupil successfully break through his bottleneck, reaching late-stage rank four.

In reality, when Ye Yuan heard about this incident, he felt that there was something very fishy.

If they were really close brothers, how could he possibly watch Heavenly Tiger King capture White Light away passively?

If it were Ye Yuan, he would rather die himself than let Heavenly Tiger King capture White Light away.

This matter, it was pronounced to the outside world that it was all done by White Light.

But the news held by the Priest Temple clearly did not stop there.

Even though the temple did not care about the affairs in the city, with their standing, the eyes and ears in the city naturally could not be avoided.

Hence, the moment Ye Yuan came out of the Transmission array, he asked about it. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Setting up this plot today was in order to bait him.

In terms of cunningness, ten Blackpupil was not Ye Yuan’s match too.

With a few interactions, Blackpupil already took Ye Yuan to be a good friend that could be confided in.

Coupled with Ye Yuan intentionally or unintentionally saying that he wanted to help Blackpupil refine the Cloud Pendant Heavenly Sunbow Pill, he naturally became even more docile and obedient towards Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan never mentioned the matter of White Light all the way until today, did he casually mention it.

If Blackpupil really took White Light to be a brother, then it was Ye Yuan who misunderstood. White Light standing up for a brother, he naturally had nothing to say.

But, if there was really something fishy in-between, then he would not be courteous.

Blackpupil knew that Ye Yuan had the ability to refine the Cloud Pendant Heavenly Sunbow Pill and was naturally willing to make friends with Ye Yuan.

Even if they did not become friends, he could not offend either!

One had to know, one medicinal pill from Ye Yuan could let him break through to rank five.

How could this sort of person be offended?

Sure enough, Blackpupil had an ingratiating look as he said, “Brother Ye, calm your anger. One look and you’re a clear-headed person! Either way, that brat is already dead, so there’s nothing that can’t be said. That punk indeed didn’t know how to appreciate favors. That’s why I did a small trick and eliminated him.”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he could not help saying with great interest, “Oh? In that case, that son of Heavenly Tiger King, it was you who deliberately took action to severely injure him?”

Blackpupil smiled and said, “That’s of course! I originally wanted to directly kill him, but I didn’t expect that this guy had coarse skin and thick flesh, and actually didn’t die! White Light that fool actually really stood up for me and shouldered this matter.”

While talking, Blackpupil had a contemptuous look on his face.

Ye Yuan had already inquired before, this Blackpupil normally addressed White Light as his brother and took on quite a number of things for White Light.

Quite a few demons in this city found White Light an eyesore. As long as Blackpupil ran into them, he would definitely cuss the other party out.

Looking at it now, these were probably arranged by Blackpupil.

Ye Yuan had a smile that was not a smile when he heard it and said, “Brother Blackpupil, you treated your own brother like that. You wouldn’t stab me in the back one day too, right?”

The moment Blackpupil heard, he hurriedly said, “What’s Brother Ye saying? I, Old Black, am not this kind of person! Actually, I’ve hinted to that White Light to leave many times and not compete for the position of young city lord in Tiger Bright Imperial City with me. But he wouldn’t listen. I only came up with this scheme out of helplessness! Brother Ye, you opened your heart up to me. I, Blackpupil, only take you as a friend in this lifetime!”

The smile on Ye Yuan’s face grew increasingly thicker, making Blackpupil feel a chill run down his back.

“B-Brother Ye, what’s with you?”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Then do you know that White Light and I are also close brothers who stand or fall together?”

Blackpupil’s expression changed when he heard it and said with an ugly expression, “This ... How is this possible?”

Ye Yuan’s face recovered tranquility and he said coolly, “White Light has stuck together with me and depended on each other for survival from birth! Now, you actually stabbed him in the back. What do you think ... I should do?”

Blackpupil’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “You ... You deliberately tricked me?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’re not considered too dumb yet! White Light he’s pure-hearted and really took you, this kind of venomous person, to be a friend. But how can I, his big brother, let you get off scot-free?”

Blackpupil’s expression changed several times. Finally, it turned into a cold smile and he said, “With the likes of you? You’re as dumb as that brother of yours! Since you suspect me, you actually still helped me to refine medicinal pills and helped me break through! Heh heh, go die!”

While talking, Blackpupil’s aura skyrocketed. The strength of late-stage rank four erupted in its entirety, him pouncing over toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan stood there and pointed a finger out very calmly.

Bang!

Blackpupil’s body was akin to being struck by lightning, suddenly flying out backward. Fresh blood was spewing wildly in the air.

Landed on the ground, he looked at Ye Yuan in horror, face revealing a panicky look as he said in disbelief, “This ... How is this possible?”

Ye Yuan looked at Blackpupil coolly and said, “White Light doesn’t like to show off, so he definitely didn’t tell you why he’d leave my side and come to Tiger Bright Imperial City from afar. The strength that you rely on isn’t worth mentioning in front of me at all!”
