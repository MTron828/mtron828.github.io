Chapter 2754: Battle Spirit Level Chaos True Spirit!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Roar!”

Above the void, the phantom of an enormous dragon soared into the sky and traversed above the clouds, glimmering and fading indeterminately.

That giant dragon seemed to have come out of ancient times, its aura boundless.

When Big Yellow saw it, he actually had an impulse to prostrate in worship!

One had to know, he was a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. No matter how strong Ye Yuan’s bloodline power was, it should not give him this kind of feeling too.

“Huhu,?this kid finally returned to chaos!” Mi Tian could not help laughing.

Big Yellow’s expression changed, and he said in shock, “Senior, could this be … chaos true spirit?”

Mi Tian said, “That’s right! This boy’s bloodline power is extremely strong, but he was still a hair’s breadth away from chaos true spirit. Now, he finally crossed over!”

Big Yellow sucked in a breath of cold air.

Others did not know what chaos true spirit meant, but he knew!

In their lineage, the Chaos Heavenly Bull was a genuine chaos true spirit!

But, even if he cultivated to Saint Sovereign Heaven now, there was still a huge gap away from the bloodline power of a chaos true spirit.

Bloodline power represented potential. It represented the future!

A mature Chaos Heavenly Bull’s strength could reach the realm of Hegemon!

And for Big Yellow, without Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill that triggered Great Dao and helped him to improve bloodline power, it was impossible for him to reach Saint Sovereign Heaven in this life too. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This was disparity!

Ye Yuan awakened his chaos true spirit bloodline. As long as he cultivated according to routine, becoming a Hegemon in the future was virtually a sure bet!

When Mi Tian saw how Big Yellow looked, he smiled and said, “You’re thinking too much! Chaos bloodline has different levels too. What Ye Yuan awakened is merely the lowest level battle spirit level chaos bloodline. Of course, even if it’s the lowest rank battle spirit level chaos bloodline, there’s virtually no bottleneck in him cultivating to True Sovereign Heaven anymore. Furthermore, if he uses the dragon race martial techniques now, the power will be more than ten times stronger than before! Under his full power eruption, it won’t be much weaker than his power of rules.”

Big Yellow opened his mouth wide and could not help being speechless.

True Sovereign Heaven!

Even if he broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he really did not dare to think about this realm before.

That was too distant.

What all of the Saint Sovereign Heavens on this Rainclear Continent were thinking was transcending Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation a few more times.

True Sovereign Heaven?

That was not possible!

Boom!

That illusory giant dragon suddenly rushed down from above the ninth heaven and smashed right into Ye Yuan’s body.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm broke through the bottleneck in one stroke, reaching upper Jade Sovereign Heaven.

The bloodline power within his body was surging crazily. His aura was still rising crazily.

Finally, it stopped at peak upper Jade Sovereign Heaven.

However, Ye Yuan’s greatest harvest was still his physical strength.

His physical body already reached the realm of half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, sufficient to accommodate the origin divinity that exceeded his body’s limits.

Ye Yuan felt that every pore on his body was currently teeming with power.

“Big Yellow, come fight!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan erupted and rushed toward Big Yellow.

Big Yellow could not help laughing when he heard that and said, “Master Ye, you aren’t my match no … mn?”

With regards to Ye Yuan’s action that overestimated his own ability, he was disdainful in his heart.

But very soon, his expression changed.

Ye Yuan threw a punch out. The void actually brought out strong undulations. A powerful to the extreme Great Dao undulation erupted from his fist.

This was the unique aura belonging to Saint Sovereign Heavens!

Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist!

But at this time, the power of the Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist actually made even Big Yellow feel threatened!

This punch could kill a Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Big Yellow’s expression changed wildly, and a pair of bull horns suddenly thrust out.

Surging Bull Fury!

Boom!

In a flash, the two had a frontal confrontation!

Ye Yuan felt a tremendous force transmit over, and his body shot back involuntarily, withdrawing ten thousand feet away.

“Hahaha,?again!”

Amidst the loud laughter, Ye Yuan did not rest either, rushing in again.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Two afterimages fought from the ground to the sky, the speed being inconceivably fast.

Each of the two people’s punches met with flesh, fighting until the void trembled heavily.

Big Yellow was immensely shocked in his heart. Was this the power of a chaos true spirit?

One had to know, although he did not employ the Coquettish Profligate Hoof, after these three years of tempering, his combat power improved by more than a level!

He was sure that he was absolutely an apex existence among lower Jade Sovereign Heavens.

But now, he actually could not take Ye Yuan down!

Furthermore, he discovered that Ye Yuan was using him for practice, familiarizing himself with the control of power.

Ye Yuan’s fist force, each punch stronger than the last, was indicating that he was currently swiftly familiarizing himself with his own power.

Boom!

One punch and one hoof separated upon contact.

The two people’s movements stopped abruptly.

“Is this the power of a chaos true spirit? Each of your punches seemed to be sent out from chaos! Ordinary lower Saint Sovereign Heavens aren’t Master Ye’s match at all!” Big Yellow said with a sigh.

This improvement was also too fast!

Ye Yuan had not truly reached Saint Sovereign Heaven yet, but already possessed the combat power of Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Such powerful strength took people’s breath away in wonder.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Indeed! With the augmentation of bloodline power, the power of the Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist is at least dozens of times stronger than before! This kind of power already doesn’t lose to Great Dao Transformation’s power of rules. After I break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, I might not be without the strength to have a battle with Li Changsheng!”

Saint Sovereign Heaven, the span was huge. Jumping realms to battle also became extremely difficult.

A Lower Saint Sovereign Heaven being able to jump realms and fight with a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven was already extremely hard to come across.

Fighting with an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven was virtually something impossible.

Otherwise, those Saint Sovereign Heavens would not have been so in despair.

But Ye Yuan felt that when his three Daos reached the realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven at the same time, he might not be without the strength to have a fight!

At that time, it would be the day of the decisive battle!

“Alright, everything is prepared, it’s also time to go and meet this ‘old friend’ who has been hiding for so many years! I don’t believe that I can’t entrap him to death!” Ye Yuan gave a cold snort, his killing intent frosty.

… …

Entrance of the passageway, the moment Ye Yuan showed himself, a shadow blocked his way.

When Ye Yuan saw the other party, his pupils could not help constricting.

The arrival was wearing a long red gown, his face very ferocious.

The most important thing was that this guy’s body was actually an origin divinity body!

However, the other party was extremely strong, powerful until it was suffocating!

Even if Ye Yuan’s origin divinity broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, he was very weak in front of the other party too.

The shadow said with a strange laugh,?“Jeje,?you seem very surprised when you saw this exalt!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Indeed, a little surprised. No wonder you’ve been hiding behind the scenes all along these few years. It turns out that you’ve long lost your physical body!”

This shadow was naturally the Heavenspan Mountain’s original master, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s ancestor, Yan Jadetrue!

Yan Jadetrue said, “Back then, we seven great Saint Sovereign Heavens discovered the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm. Apart from Zhuo Bufan, we all died under the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s restrictions! This exalt couldn’t escape this calamity too! However, this exalt relied on the Heavenspan Mountain and left behind a wisp of remnant soul in the end! However, being able to recover to my present realm, I really have to thank this world’s fools! Of course, including you too!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold, and he said, “It turns out that the one truly controlling the Doomsday Battle was you!”
