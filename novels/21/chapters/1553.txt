Chapter 1557 Hit! Hit Ruthlessly

“Y-Y-Your Excellency, this lowly one had eyes but couldn’t see and offended Your Excellency! This ... This lowly one will get lost right away!”

Guo Xingwang originally thought that Ye Yuan was a soft persimmon. He did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually a metal plate.

“Halt!” Ye Yuan suddenly said in a cold voice.

Guo Xingwang’s body turned stiff. Squeezing out a smile that was even uglier than crying, he said, “What ... What instructions does Master Ye have?”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “What’s wrong with him?”

Huang Qian was his patient. Ye Yuan had just treated him and he was immediately beaten by people until like this. He was also quite enraged in his heart. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Although their standpoints were different, his impression of this uncle and nephew two people were still considered pretty good.

Most importantly, Huang Qian was his proud achievement.

That Purple Quill Marrow Extermination was indeed very troublesome. It was extremely hard to come by test for him too.

If not for this, he also would not spend four hours to diagnose Huang Qian’s pulse.

Actually, Deyi Hall’s shameful deeds, he already guessed more than half when he saw Huang Qian.

It was nothing more than Wu Feng feeling that he had a great loss of face and cast the fire on this uncle and nephew two people.

Huang Qian’s appearance probably meant that Huang Haoran was fraught with grim possibilities already.

Ye Yuan was not some goody-two-shoes. These two people did not have much relationship with him. He did not need to stand up for them.

But Deyi Hall actually pursued it until they made him very upset.

“This ... This ...” Guo Xingwang stammered, not knowing how he should answer.

Ye Yuan said coldly, “If you all caught him outside, I don’t care and can’t be bothered to care either. But you guys actually beat my patient until like this in the Miracle Hand Parlor, and then you want to walk away just like that?”

Guo Xingwang’s expression was ugly to the extreme and he said awkwardly, “Master Ye, this ... this lowly one knows my mistake!”

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Death penalty can be spared, but it’s hard to escape punishment!”

Guo Xingwang cried bitterness in his heart. But a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse was there, so he really did not dare to be insolent and could only say, “What does ... Master Ye want?”

Actually, Guo Xingwang heaved a slight sigh of relief in his heart. At the very least, he preserved his life.

Ye Yuan swept a glance at his subordinates and said coolly, “You guys, beat him up ruthlessly! Don’t be too severe, let him return lying down and that will do.”

“Pfft!”

Ning Siyu and Liang Wanru both could not resist laughing out loud.

Ye Yuan was too bad.

Opposite of them, everyone’s faces turned stiff. The subordinates used strange gazes to look at Guo Xingwang.

Guo Xingwang said in a solemn voice, “I’ll see which of you dare to make a move!”

“If nobody makes a move, then I can only invite Brother Xiao to take action,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Guo Xingwang simply wanted to curse and swear, but he did not dare!

Straight away, he could only have a bitter face and pointed at himself as he said, “Hit! H-Hit ruthlessly!”

The subordinates exchanged glances, nobody dared to make a move first.

Looking as Ye Yuan’s expression was becoming increasingly grimmer, Guo Xingwang immediately flew off the handle.

“F*cking hell, asked you all you hit, did you hear it or not? You all want to die, is it? Hit!” Guo Xingwang put on a brave front and said viciously.

Looking at Guo Xingwang’s behavior, the two girls covered their mouths and smiled. Even Xiao Feng was smiling too.

Ye Yuan this boy, his lousy ideas were really a lot.

When the subordinates saw that the boss was already like this, they could only grit their teeth and hit!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A series of punches and kicks, Guo Xingwang was beaten until he rolled on the ground, already beaten black and blue.

Even though his subordinates’ strengths were inferior to his, he did not dare to resist at all right now. He naturally could not avoid the agony of the flesh.

However, Ye Yuan was still not satisfied and said with a cold snort, “I said before, I want him to go out lying down! You all don’t forget who I am, how bad his injuries are can’t hide from my eyes!”

“Puhwark!”

Hearing this, Guo Xingwang immediately spewed out a mouthful of old blood and shouted, “Did you all not f*cking eat rice? Put in some effort for me! Hitting like this, do you all want to hit until tomorrow morning?”

While it hurt, how could the subordinates dare to deal a heavy blow?

Whoever used too much divine essence and got hated by the half-step Divine Lord boss, they would not even know how they died.

Hence, while they hit, it was impossible to cause real damage to Guo Xingwang at all.

But hitting like this, Guo Xingwang was even more painful instead.

The feeling of fists punching onto the flesh was not that comfortable.

With him roaring, the subordinates also knew that they could not be spared today and could all only burst forth with divine essence, greeting onto Guo Xingwang’s body.

Before long, Guo Xingwang was at death’s door and could not even speak.

“Alright, get lost then!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

The group of subordinates was akin to having been granted amnesty. Carrying Guo Xingwang, they left like a puff of smoke.

When the neighbors who did not know the truth saw this scene, they could not help being surprised.

“Isn’t that Deyi Hall’s chief protector, Guo Xingwang? I seem to have seen his subordinates beat him up just now?”

“It really seems so! Does this guy have a tendency for self-masochism? His own subordinates hit him and he actually still did not retaliate?”

“Hang on! They came out of the Miracle Hand Parlor. Could they have ... offended Master Ye?”

“Master Ye is merely initial-stage Origin Deity, so why is this bunch of people so scared of him? Tsk tsk, Master Ye is really unfathomable!”

...

Ning Siyu and Liang Wanru two people had long laughed themselves into fits already.

“Hehe, Master Ye, you’re really too bad! How do you want him to lift his head up in front of his subordinates in the future?” Ning Siyu laughed hard and said.

Ye Yuan smirked and said, “What does that have to do with me? They came to provoke me first! If people don’t offend me, I don’t offend people! If people offend me, heh heh!”

Ye Yuan let the shopkeeper tidy up and brought everyone into the inner hall.

Ye Yuan sent a trace of divine essence into Huang Qian’s body. Very soon, he slowly woke up.

“Your second uncle is already poisoned to death by Wu Feng?” Ye Yuan asked.

The moment Huang Qian heard Wu Feng’s name, his two eyes turned blood-red, the muscles on his face started convulsing.

“Wu Feng this brute! I ... I must kill him!” Huang Qian said and gnashed his teeth in hatred.

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and reached his hand out to press on Huang Qian’s head. A wave of gentle soul force invaded Huang Qian’s sea of consciousness.

Gradually, Huang Qian quietened down and became less maniacal, his entire person much more peaceful.

Ye Yuan took his hand away and said, “Talk, say it out, it will feel better.”

...

When Wu Feng saw Guo Xingwang’s miserable state, the corners of his mouth could not help twitching.

Too miserable!

This guy was already almost beaten until he did not have human form anymore.

“Who did it?” Wu Feng said in a solemn voice.

The group of subordinates looked at each other, not knowing what they should say.

“We ... We were the ones who hit!” a subordinate said softly.

“Mn? What’s going on? Made you all go out to capture a person, how did you all return like this?” Wu Feng said in a solemn voice.

That subordinate recounted the incident that happened at the Miracle Hand Parlor. Wu Feng’s brows furrowed together.

“This boy clearly just came from outside the city. But why would there be a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse backing him up? Humph! So what if Divine Lord Realm powerhouse? Could it be that ... I don’t have a backer? This punk opposed me time and again. Does he really take me, Wu Feng, to be easy to knead?! This time, I must tear down your signboard and chase you out of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!” Wu Feng said with a cold snort.
