Chapter 1880: Mysterious Tang Yan

Bang!

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean did not hesitate at all, Innumerable Ghost Shadows was executed once more, directly bombarding a blade over.

One blade directly blasted Zhao Min flying.

“Cough, cough!”

Zhao Ming was struck by the blade and already sustained serious injuries, coughing vigorously.

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s Innumerable Ghost Shadows, even Qiao Yuan and Eymond joining hands, was not a match for it. So how could a measly Zhao Min alone possibly block it?

“Hahaha! Zhao Min, is your brain spoiled? Didn’t even figure out the situation and you dare to threaten Ye Yuan?” When Qiao Yuan saw the situation, he could not resist laughing loudly.

The two of them fiend race mighty Empyreans did not even dare to attack Wild Blade after joining hands.

Zhao Min, alone and without backing, actually dared to use Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital to coerce Ye Yuan. Did he really take Ye Yuan to be a soft persimmon?

When those True God powerhouses saw this scene, each and every one of their hearts leaped to their throats.

That was an Empyrean powerhouse, and yet Ye Yuan sent him packing with one word.

It was also that the space here was not stable enough. Otherwise, Ye Yuan would likely deal a fatal blow.

But this attack already gave Zhao Ming a serious injury too.

Zhao Min crawled to his feet, his expression ugly to the extreme. No idea whether was it because he got injured, or was it because it was humiliating.

“Those who came here are all aiming for the treasures. You used Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital to threaten me? I think that you really didn’t bring your brain out when you left the house!” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

“C-Consider yourself ruthless!” Zhao Ming gritted his teeth and stopped talking.

Under this situation right now, the most domineering one was not the few mighty Empyrean powerhouses, but Ye Yuan, this puny little Celestial Deity Realm!”

This was because Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s strength far surpassed the other Empyreans.

And Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean obeyed Ye Yuan’s every command!

Zhao Min, this major faction’s Empyrean powerhouse, was insufferably arrogant because he was used to playing the tyrant.

Because of Ye Yuan’s conflict with Ji Kang, Xu Xing, and the rest, he felt that it provoked Vast Heaven Great Imperial Capital’s face. That was why he blurted out those words.

Except, he never thought that Ye Yuan would actually be so decisive in going for the kill, making a move at a word of disagreement.

Ye Yuan’s words and actions were not like a junior’s at all, but a fierce and ambitious person who ruled a region.

“Heh, since these two cowardly turtles came out too, then we can discuss how to enter the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace, right?”

These words, Qiao Yuan said them to Ye Yuan.

Currently, Ye Yuan undoubtedly had the greatest right to speak.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “How to go in is your business. If you have the ability, go in to seize the treasures. If you don’t have the ability, keep watch outside! Senior Wild Blade, let’s go!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan brought Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean and entered inside the restriction with a stride.

Qiao Yuan’s pupils constricted, this brat’s guts were also too plucky, to actually go in just like this. Wasn’t he scared of death?”

“Humph! Blind and reckless thing!” When Zhao Min saw the situation, he said with a cold snort.

At the same time, he cursed non-stop in his heart, cursing for Ye Yuan to be directly exterminated by the restriction.

However, he was disappointed.

After Ye Yuan walked into the restriction, the restriction did not have any reaction at all!

It was only to see him shift positions, directly arriving outside the palace’s front door. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Creak ...

The door was lightly pushed open by Ye Yuan.

Qiao Yuan’s face changed, and he said with a furious roar, “Turns out that this kid knows restrictions! Damn it!”

“Can’t let this boy go in! Otherwise, the treasures inside will be swept clean by him alone!” Zhao Min also said anxiously.

Ye Yuan turned around and said with a smile, “You guys take your time. No rush. I’ll go in to explore the way first.”

Done talking, he stepped right into the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace.

“This ... What to do here? Old Fart Immortal Grove’s restrictions are extremely formidable. Based on our strength, forcefully barging won’t work at all!” Eymond said anxiously.

The others also had looks of despair. No one would have thought that at the final juncture, everyone would be played by Ye Yuan.

When everyone was at a loss on what to do, he swaggered his way in.

“Everyone, I think that I can bring you all in.” Just as everyone lost all hope, a voice sounded out like heavenly music.

Looking over to where the voice was, everyone discovered that it was actually a Celestial Deity Realm young man.

“You? You’re sure that you can?” Zhao Min used doubting eyes to look at him.

The young man smiled brightly and said, “I can go ahead first.”

Everyone exchanged glances, Qiao Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Okay! You go!”

The young man slowly walked out, akin to strolling idly in a courtyard, and really made a round trip.

Except, his speed of clearing the restriction was much slower compared to Ye Yuan.

When everyone saw the situation, they immediately revealed wildly ecstatic looks.

No one would have expected that this Celestial Deity Realm young man could actually crack such a profound restriction.

Qiao Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said with pleasant surprise, “What’s your name called?”

The young man smiled and said, “Tang Yan.”

This young man was none other than precisely Tang Yan!

Even Ye Yuan also did not think that apart from him, this place actually still had someone capable of passing through the restriction.

“Hahaha, truly, heaven didn’t fail me! Quickly, you lead the way!” Qiao Yuan said impatiently.

But Tang Yan smiled and said, “Senior don’t be anxious, Tang Yan don’t have other abilities, but have done some research on restrictions. However, this junior has a presumptuous request.”

Qiao Yuan’s face changed, but he recovered back to normal very quickly and said smilingly, “Speak!”

At this time, if Tang Yan did not raise any requests, it would be abnormal instead.

Tang Yan smiled and said, “Seniors have to do everything in your power to ensure my safety after entering this Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove. I hope that everyone swears a Heavenly Dao Oath! Don’t use this kind of eyes to look at me. With Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s attainments, there is still no idea what kind of restriction exists inside. Ensuring my safety, seniors will only earn and not lose out. By now, this junior already has no other requests and only asks to be able to go out safely.”

The few mighty Empyrean powerhouses exchanged glances, agreeing to Tang Yan’s request very quickly.

Just as Tang Yan said, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s restrictions were too terrifying.

This place was Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s lair, what kind of restrictions were inside was still not known.

With Tang Yan around, it was indeed a pretty good choice.

After swearing the Heavenly Dao Oath, Tang Yan started to bring everyone into the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace.

...

After entering the heavenly palace, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean said with a cold laugh, “Heh, how would those fools have thought that Young Master is Lord Immortal Grove’s successor? With this, they can only wait blankly outside.”

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “That might not be so!”

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s face changed and he said, “Young Master, what does this mean?”

Ye Yuan said, “Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove laying down such a big set up, it was in order to lure these people in. Now that they already arrived at the gate, how can they possibly be turned away at the gate?”

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean’s face changed, and he said, “This ... What in the world does Lord Immortal Grove want to do?”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “That can only ask him to know! Either way, it’s definitely not some good thing to the Immortal Grove World! Mn?”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, sensing a wave of undulation in the Purple Extreme Hall.

His thoughts stirred and Little Tong appeared hugging the pink Treasure Pig.

“Snort snort ...” Treasure Pig grunted at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s eyebrows raised up and he said with a smile, “Okay, we’ll follow you!”

Little Tong let his hand go. Treasure Pig immediately scurried into the depths of the great hall like lightning.
