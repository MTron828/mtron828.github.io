Chapter 2155: Battling a Hundred Empyreans!

“Coming!”

Ye Yuan currently had his eyes shut to rest, ignoring the chirping of the Long Xiaochun by the side.

Suddenly, a ripple in space was keenly detected by him.

Long Xiaochun was taken aback at first, following that, she grumbled, “Hey, you’re still using this kind of low-level method to bluff me, do you think that I’d believe?”

But Ye Yuan ignored her and slowly got up. His gaze seemed to have seen through the dense woods, a solemn look on his face.

In the distance, some powerful auras were currently coming over here!

There was a series of rustling noises in the dense woods. Several dozen figures revealed their figures.

The person in the front had thick bushy brows, a pair of eyes as sharp as an eagle’s. The scar at the corner of his eye drew all the way to the chin; extremely terrifying.

The scarred man said in a cold voice, “Everyone, guard your positions well. This boy is proficient in spatial law. Don’t let him run!”

“Yes, Lord Long Xiao!” Everyone answered.

When this group of people appeared in front of Long Xiaochun, she was utterly stunned.

Each and every one of these people’s auras was very powerful, they were actually all Empyrean powerhouses!

The scarred man in the front even reached middle-stage Empyrean!

Ye Yuan was long mentally prepared and was very calm as he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Did Ao Xu send you guys here?”

Long Xiao laughed loudly and said, “Kid, want to bait me? However ... it doesn’t matter, because you’re dead for sure today! That’s right, it was indeed Lord Xu who sent us here! Looking at your appearance, you actually don’t feel surprised?”

In Long Xiao’s eyes, Ye Yuan was already a turtle in one’s jaws. He would be dead for sure.

Although spatial law was formidable, as long as there were sufficient precautions, the opponent could not run at all.

They were merely a thousand feet away from Ye Yuan right now.

At this distance, Ye Yuan did not have the chance to execute spatial law to escape at all!

But regarding Ye Yuan’s reaction, Long Xiao was very surprised.

Since Ye Yuan was waiting here obediently, he shouldn’t have known that this was arranged by Lord Xu. But why was he so composed, like he knew long ago?

This could not be explained!

If he knew that it was Long Xiaochun’s assist, he would probably be beside himself with joy long ago.

Hearing Long Xiao’s words, Long Xiaochun was completely dumbfounded.

Long Xiaochun did not believe this as she said, “Impossible! This ... How is this possible? Lord Ao Xu is so nice. It must be you guys framing him!”

Ye Yuan could not help being speechless and said, “That old man has probably lived for no less than ten million years. Wouldn’t pretending to be a kind grandpa be easily accomplished?”

Long Xiaochun could not quite accept this truth. When she looked at Ye Yuan, her heart felt like it was being pricked. Lowering her eyes, she felt very guilty inside.

“Sorry, I ... I was wrong! You ... You run away! Don’t worry about me!” Long Xiaochun was simple, but she was not dumb.

She knew that she really misunderstood Ye Yuan.

Ao Xu was completely and utterly a big liar!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What a joke. You’re my little sister, how can I possibly leave you and escape by myself?”

Long Xiao laughed loudly and said, “Escape? Kid, you seem to not have realized your situation yet! In front of this Empyrean, you still want to run?”

Long Xiaochun suddenly recalled something, looking at the scarred man, she cried out in shock, “Eagle eyes, scar, you ... you’re Long Xiao!”

Long Xiao laughed loudly and said, “Looks like this Empyrean’s name is still somewhat resounding!”

Long Xiaochun said anxiously, “Ye Yuan, quickly run! This guy is famous for killing people without batting an eyelid! Furthermore, he’s extremely strong, being unrivaled in the same rank! He committed numerous crimes in Purpledragon Stronghold and suffered the pursuit of several dozen black strongholds. Later, it alarmed an earth stronghold. Legends say that when he was still Third Firmament Empyrean, he had once encountered the pursuit of five great Third Firmament Empyreans before. In the end, those five great Empyreans were all killed by him!”

If Long Xiao was just Second or Third Firmament Empyrean, Long Xiaochun would not be so nervous. She knew Ye Yuan’s combat power.

Even if he could not win, there was still hope of running away.

But this Long Xiao was a Fourth Firmament Empyrean mighty expert. Furthermore, his combat strength was extremely strong. Her assurance in Ye Yuan was not that big anymore.

Long Xiaochun liked to pester Long Zhi, making him talk about some of the interesting things of the East Suppression Pseudo World and the outside world.

Long Xiao’s fame in the boundary of Purpledragon Stronghold was very great. Long Zhi had mentioned it once before, so that was how she knew.

“Heh heh, since you know this Empyrean’s battle achievements, then you should know that you’re dead for sure today, right? In order to deal with you, this father of yours has brought out all the elite troops!” Long Xiao said with a cold laugh.

Among the dozen over Empyreans present, just the Third Firmament Empyreans were as many as three!

There were also seven to eight Second Firmament Empyreans. First Firmament Empyreans likewise had seven to eight people.

Coupled with Long Xiao, this Fourth Firmament Empyrean super powerhouse, this was practically a certain-kill trap.

Ye Yuan’s expression also had a rare show of seriousness.

His current strength facing off against a First Firmament Empyrean was virtually insta-skill.

Facing a Second Firmament Empyrean, he could also fight and win.

But facing off with a Third Firmament Empyrean would be somewhat taxing.

After all, each minor realm of Empyrean Realm, the span was tremendous; difficult to go beyond. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Yuan broke through to Chaos Realm, fused essence, energy, and spirit three paths, coupled with outstanding combat strength, that was how he could jump realms and battle.

But dealing with so many Empyreans at the same time, furthermore, it was even all Empyreans whose realms were higher than him, it would naturally not be that easy for him anymore.

As for the Chaos Essence One Breath Sword, that was his final trump card.

Whether this move could kill the Fourth Firmament Empyrean Long Xiao or not was really hard to say.

If the one strike failed, the consequences would be dangerous.

This kind of move, even he could not randomly execute it.

“It looks like Ao Xu really put in the blood capital in order to deal with me! However ... do you all think that killing me is that easy?” Ye Yuan said with a cold smile.

Long Xiao smiled and said, “Of course this Empyrean knows that you’re not easy to kill! Otherwise, could you, a First Firmament Empyrean, require this Empyrean’s grand presence? Since this Empyrean came, I’ve naturally readied everything! Brothers, kill for me!”

Under the word of command, roughly 17 to 18 Empyrean powerhouses attacked together!

This commotion was truly earth-shaking.

Empyrean powerhouses, those were all major powers that could move mountains and empty seas. With 17 to 18 Empyreans, what kind of line-up was that?

Especially the three Third Firmament Empyreans, three blade images directly cut through the void, arriving in front of Ye Yuan instantly.

“Be careful!”

Ye Yuan shouted coldly, directly pulling Long Xiaochun and escaping into the void, dodging those blade images.

Incredibly dangerous!

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised in his heart. These three great Empyrean’s combat strengths far exceeded his imagination.

Their laws were not considered too outstanding. But these three people, one look, and it was clear that they were veterans of a hundred battles. Their application of laws already reached the acme of perfection.

Coupled with the pressure from their cultivation realms, as well as the three people’s tacit cooperation, it was troublesome to the extreme!

It seemed like these guys had long already mastered their abilities under the pursuit of the Dragon Clan.

Not just them, the other Empyrean powerhouses were all not amateurs too!

Ye Yuan reckoned that if those so-called geniuses matched up against these people, they probably would not even know how they died!

Ye Yuan was startled, but he did not know that Long Xiao who was watching the fight from the sidelines was more shocked than he was!

He understood the strength of these brothers too well. Putting a Third Firmament Empyrean here, in less than three exchanges, they would definitely die grievously.

But Ye Yuan’s application of spatial law was too terrifying.

More than ten rounds had passed, they actually did not even touch the corners of his clothes!

Let alone that Ye Yuan was even bringing along Long Xiaochun, who was being a burden.
