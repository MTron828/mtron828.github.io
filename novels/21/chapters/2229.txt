Chapter 2233: Forming Enmity

“Heavenly Emperor Zhao Hun!”

“Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather!”

“Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn!”

... ...

“That’s ... Heavenly Emperor Ninelives! He’s a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!”

One powerful figure after another appearing in succession. There were actually as many as seven people!

Everyone sucked in a mouthful of cold air, clearly not expecting that there were actually still so many Heavenly Emperors in hiding.

Wu Jiang looked at Ye Yuan in surprise, not knowing how he discovered these Heavenly Emperors.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze swept across the whole place and said in a cold voice, “All Empyreans are not to take action without authorization! Those who defy, die!”

The faces of the Empyreans present changed drastically, immediately realizing that they were designated as cannon fodder!

First Firmament and Second Firmament Heavenly Emperors were at the bottom of the barrel among Heavenly Emperors. They were not as confident as before.

Naturally, the places that Third Firmament Heavenly Emperor and above wanted to go, these cannon fodders were no use at all.

The abnormality this time was very strange, these First and Second Firmament Heavenly Emperors were rather cautious too. Finding Empyreans to be cannon fodders became a pretty good choice.

In the various major mystic realms, powerhouses making weaklings go be cannon fodders frequently appeared too.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Suddenly, several figures sprinted wildly, heading for the opening of the Asura Blood Pool.

How swift were the movements of Empyrean powerhouses!

They were fast, but Heavenly Emperor Ninelives was faster!

It was only to see a hint of a cold smile flash across the corners of his mouth, his finger flicking lightly. Several streaks of light dots arrived in an instant.

Bang, bang, bang ...

Those scurrying Empyrean powerhouses were instantly slaughtered by him without missing a single one!

Among them, there were even several late-stage Empyrean powerful experts!

“Who else wants to leave?” Heavenly Emperor Ninelives said coolly, not carrying the slightest compassion.

The others were silent like cicadas in winter.

In front of Heavenly Emperors, they were akin to ants!

Only Heavenly Emperors could confront Heavenly Emperors!

Wu Jiang’s deadpan face became several shades whiter.

He involuntarily looked over towards Ye Yuan but discovered that Ye Yuan had a look of composure, seemingly not looking too worried, and immediately felt slightly calmer.

Seeing no one jump out, Heavenly Emperor Ninelives said coolly, “Very good. Since nobody is leaving, enter then.”

Got to admit, Asura Blood Pool attracted countless powerhouses.

Just the Empyrean powerhouses here were in the hundreds.

This force was already immensely powerful.

Just as everyone was planning on entering the blood sea, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn suddenly gave a light cry of surprise and said, “There’s actually still a human bug! You, come over!”

While talking, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn extended his hand and pointed at Ye Yuan.

Wu Jiang’s expression changed and could not help looking at Ye Yuan nervously.

Ye Yuan slowly stepped forward and said coolly, “What instructions does Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn have?”

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s brows furrowed and he said unhappily, “A brat who’s so ignorant of the rules! A mere human bug also dares to encroach on my ghost race’s treasure?”

Finished talking, his finger flicked. A streak of white light shot right at Ye Yuan.

The horrifying energy undulation made all of the Empyrean’s faces change, all clamoring to dodge.

Ye Yuan was also surprised in his heart. He did not expect that this Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn would actually kill people at a word of disagreement.

But although he was surprised, he did not panic. His figure retreated explosively, the bone sword attacking fiercely.

Bang, bang, bang ...

In an instant, Ye Yuan released thousands of incomparably swift and fierce sword lights, rumbling over toward that streak of white light.

Falling back several tens of thousands of feet in a row, that streak of white light was utterly dissipated by Ye Yuan in the end.

And between them, an enormous ravine was also blasted out.

Ye Yuan put away the sword and stood there, glaring at Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn.

While the Empyreans looked at Ye Yuan with astonished faces.

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives’s gaze flickered slightly, revealing a hint of surprise.

This scene earlier happened too suddenly, quick until everyone did not react to it.

But seeing Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn taking action, they all thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

They did not expect that Ye Yuan actually unleashed thousands of sword lights in a single breath, directly neutralizing Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s attack.

Even though this attack was merely a casual strike of Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s, it was also not what any Empyrean could block.

This attack was more than enough to kill an Eighth Firmament Empyrean!

At the very least, among the Empyreans present, those able to block it did not surpass ten fingers.

“Huhu, Ghostmourn, you’re really becoming promising, can’t even take care of a human race Empyrean Realm brat.” Heavenly Emperor Zhao Hun said gloatingly.

“Ghostmourn, I don’t know you! Seriously too disgraceful!” Heavenly Emperor Brutalfeather also had a look of being unable to bear to look at it.

Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn was stunned at first, following that, there was boundless fury.

In front of a bunch of Heavenly Emperors, it was really a major loss of face with this!

“Damn human brat, this Heavenly Emperor will kill you!”

Done talking, Heavenly Emperor Ghostmourn’s terrifying pressure suddenly erupted and was about to unleash a heaven-shocking strike.

When the Empyreans felt this terrifying pressure, each and every one of them had ashen faces.

The might of a Heavenly Emperor was too terrifying!

At this time, Ninelives suddenly spoke up. He said, “Ghostmourn, spare this boy’s life. His strength is decent. Killing like this is somewhat a waste.”

Heavenly Emperor Ninelives was a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor. Ghostmourn had no choice but to give face.

He gave a cold snort and said, “Boy, consider yourself lucky!”

Ninelives’s gaze was indifferent as he said, “Go in!”

The Empyreans opened up their domains and isolated the bloody light outside, and slowly entered the Asura Blood Pool.

Ye Yuan forcefully suppressed his fury and followed everyone into the cave.

There were seven Ghost Dao Empyreans in front. Becoming enemies with them was clearly not a wise move.

His objective for coming here was the Silvernet Blood Essence, there was no need to do this kind of pointless fight.

Of course, this enmity, he noted it down.

Wu Jiang scooted over and said in surprise, “Brother Ye, are you alright? Just now, I even thought that you were dead for sure. Heh, your strength is pretty good, I, Wu Jiang, indeed didn’t make an error of judgment.”

Wu Jiang was somewhat surprised by Ye Yuan’s strength. But his overtones were that he could also receive this strike.

How could Ye Yuan not understand? This Wu Jiang was clearly not an ordinary Empyrean either.

Entering the cave entrance, it was a stretch of bloody light before their eyes. This place was an enormous underground cavern.

Along the way, there were big and small blood pits everywhere, flowing with dark red blood inside. Blood bubbles even bubbled from time to time.

“Don’t touch these blood bubbles, once touched, even Empyreans will have their souls dissipate too!” Wu Jiang warned.

Ye Yuan was slightly startled in his heart and nodded his head in response.

Apart from this, Ye Yuan discovered that the space here was extremely distorted. Ordinary Empyreans were unable to traverse through space at all.

This Asura Blood Pool was like a giant spatial cage, constraining everyone in here.

Furthermore, the deeper in, the more terrifying the degree of spatial distortion.

Even Heavenly Emperors were unable to escape too.

Of course, this was no big deal to Ye Yuan.

His spatial law attainments were not what ordinary Empyreans could compare to.

This group of people was extremely strong. At first, they did not encounter any danger.

But very soon, they ran into problems!

“Ahhh!!”

A tragic cry came over. A Second Firmament Empyrean Ghost Dao Empyrean was directly sucked into a blood pool, vanishing without a trace.

With this, the hairs of all the Empyreans stood on ends.

They did not see the opponent at all and this Empyrean was gone. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned dark, and he said to Ghost Empyrean Wild Blade, “Wild Blade, get a little closer. Don’t get separated from me.”
