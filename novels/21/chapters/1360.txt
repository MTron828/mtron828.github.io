Chapter 1364: Heaven’s Might

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Heh, looks like you just know a little something, but that is not enough for it to count!” Xie Jingyi deliberately beat around the bush.

“Pray tell!” Ye Yuan said.

Ye Yuan knew that the test’s three hurdles were Heaven’s Might, Earth Carnage, Illumination, and he also knew that each checkpoint wiped out a lot of people. But as for the specifics, he did not know.

Regardless of whether it was the Xiao Feng or Yang Rui, they all intentionally or unintentionally avoided this topic.

Ye Yuan knew their motives, so he did not force it either.

“Each entrance examination affects tens of millions of people, how to evaluate? This first hurdle, Heaven’s Might, is used to scrub away people! This round will eliminate the vast majority of people. Those able to make it through are all geniuses among geniuses!”

Actually, those with the qualifications to come and take part in this entrance exam could originally be called geniuses already.

But Heaven’s Might this round, the objective was to wipe out the vast majority of geniuses!

Ye Yuan’s heart stirred, and he asked, “Roughly eliminate how much?”

The little fatty smiled bitterly and said, “Over 90%! Basically, after this round is done, only the outstanding ones among grand completion Grotto Profound and late-stage Grotto Profound will be left. The rest basically have no hope of passing!”

But Ye Yuan was incredibly shocked when he heard. He also did not expect that this first hurdle would be so brutal.

No wonder this little fatty said that he and Ye Yuan were all here as extras.

“Like this huh, then ... actually, you already gave up?”

Being surprised was just being surprised, but Ye Yuan did not have much visible change in countenance.

This first hurdle, he still had some confidence in passing!

This hurdle’s name was Heaven’s Might. Actually, it was scouring the will. It was similar to cultivation realm coercion but also somewhat different. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

But this kind of test was simply child’s play in front of him.

This Wu Meng Capital City, no matter how formidable the willpower scouring, it was also impossible to surpass the Divine Lord Realm.

The Ye Yuan who refined the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, forget about a measly little Divine Lord Realm, even a True God’s will could forget about making him waver in the slightest too.

This was where his confidence lay!

Except, Ye Yuan did not plan on using the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain’s will. He would use his own will to resist.

If he seriously could not keep up anymore, he would cheat.

But he knew that if he gave up this round, then there was really no hope anymore.

Ye Yuan felt that this friendly little fatty was rather interesting; that was why he asked this.

“I naturally don’t wish to give up. But my strength is just that tiny bit stronger than yours, there’s no hope,” the little fatty said rather dispiritedly.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Heaven’s Might this round is related to the realm, but also not absolute. If people on the martial path don’t have the determination to die, it’s hard to accomplish anything great! I think this is the original intention of Wu Meng Academy setting up this round, right? The vast majority of people fear death and don’t dare to compete with heaven, that’s why they are eliminated. But in reality, this round being named Heaven’s Might, it isn’t Heaven’s Might.”

Xie Jingyi looked at Ye Yuan in surprise, the cynical look on his face gradually fading away. He did not expect Ye Yuan to actually say these words from his mouth.

This youth whose realm was even lower than his actually had such insight!

“What you said is right, I can’t give up! I want to let my Xiu-er know that her man is a man of indomitable spirit!” Xie Jingyi said with a rare solemness.

It was just that this excuse made Ye Yuan at a loss whether to cry or laugh.

At this time, an old man walked up the platform in front of the plaza and said in a clear voice, “Quiet!”

The voice was akin to rolling thunder, making the millions of people in the plaza hear clearly.

“The first round, Heaven’s Might, is starting right away. This round tests your Martial Dao will! If anybody can’t hold on under Heaven’s Might, you just have to shatter the wooden tablet in your hands, and will be transported out. Of course, that way, your test will also be a failure. You’ll directly be eliminated! Heaven’s Might will last 30 days without ceasing. Furthermore, it will become more and more powerful! I’ll get the unpleasantness out of the way first, if somebody discovers that something is wrong, better hurry up and crush the wooden tablet. Otherwise ... there will be deaths!”

The old man’s words were akin to a sledgehammer, crushing everyone until they could not breathe.

Especially the last few words, it made people even more fearful in their hearts.

This willpower scouring would become more and more horrifying towards the last few days. Once someone could not bear the heavy pressure, they would be overwhelmed and get killed by the powerful will.

Hence, the old man’s words were not exaggerating things to raise the alarm.

As powerful as Divine Lord Realm, exterminating low-level martial artists with Martial Dao willpower was as easy as flipping one’s hand.

“Now, Heaven’s Might begin!”

The moment the old man’s voice fell, a tidewater-like willpower crushed toward all of the martial artists on the plaza.

That kind of feeling was like facing the scouring of a waterfall.

However, this initial waterfall was not very powerful. Apart from those whose realms were too low finding it somewhat strenuous to handle, the others were all very relaxed.

It was just that this scouring was continuous and not just a while.

Just like a person who was carrying a bag of things; at the start, it might not feel heavy. But along with the increase in time, you would feel heavier and heavier.

A mere hour passed, and someone could not hold on anymore.

The only threshold for the entrance examination was 200 years old skeletal age. Hence, the very large portion in the plaza were all initial-stage Grotto Profound martial artists.

Some people were just a few decades old. They just came to try their luck or experience it a bit.

These people still had a second chance to join the entrance examination.

A hundred years later, their strength would naturally improve further.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

...

On the plaza, there were people spewing blood non-stop, and then directly transported out of this space.

Ye Yuan sat on the lotus seat, holding steadfast.

This degree of willpower scouring was not worth mentioning to him.

Even if he did not borrow the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, Ye Yuan was very confident in himself too.

Along the way, Ye Yuan had experienced far too much. Life and death trials were already no idea how many times.

Disregarding the path of defying the heavens in the Immortal Grove World, just the encounter inside the spatial storm was not what ordinary people could imagine.

His Martial Dao willpower was long firm as a rock already.

This so-called Heaven’s Might was just targeting Grotto Profound Realm martial artists. It was not possible to really be so powerful.

It was just that to Grotto Profound Realm martial artists, it was rather powerful.

Ye Yuan examined himself, on this aspect, he was not inferior to those so-called geniuses!

A day’s time passed in a blink. The moment the second day’s hour arrived, a surge of even stronger willpower than yesterday suddenly descended.

Under the impact of this surge of willpower, a large swathe immediately fell down. One figure after another disappeared on the plaza in succession.

However, this was just child’s play.

The truly large-scale elimination appeared on the fifth day and the sixth day!

On just the fifth day alone, 200 thousand people were transported out!

The remaining people, their faces were all no longer as relaxed as before.

When it reached the sixth day, fine sweat beads already seeped out on little fatty Xie Jingyi’s head.

Just as he expected, he could at most just last five or six days.

“Think about your Xiu-er, think about why you want to become strong! Since you have a reason to become strong, why give up halfway?”

Right at this moment, a voice reached Xie Jingyi’s ear.

He discerned it; it was Ye Yuan’s voice.

This voice of Ye Yuan’s was akin to a clap of thunder, enlightening the benighted, letting Xie Jingyi’s mind tense up all at once.

Xiu-er’s beautiful figure kept emerging in his mind.
