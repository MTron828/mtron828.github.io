Chapter 2266: Bullying the Divine Race for Having No One!

Face slapping!

A blatant face slapping!

Ye Yuan viciously dealt a slap in front of a group of divine race Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses.

The divine race was incomparably proud and completely did not place other races in their sights.

But now, there was a human that they looked down on who jumped a major realm and defeated a divine race powerhouse.

What else was more ironic than this?

Ru Feng’s expression was very ugly and he endured his anger as he said, “This young friend, no matter how heaven-defying you are, you’re also merely just at the Empyrean Realm! It’s still not your turn to come and act wildly in my Divine Clan!”

Ye Yuan shot him a glance and said with a cold smile, “You’re one of the nine Hidden Clan elders, right? Stop posing in front of this Ye! It’s not like this Ye hasn’t exchanged blows with someone like you before. Wasn’t he still forcefully knocked down a major realm by me and almost died?”

Ye Yuan was not someone who liked to flaunt his prowess, but his heart was currently very tumultuous, with his belly full of evil fire with nowhere to give vent. He needed to find an outlet to vent out.

The divine race was the best relief outlet.

Let alone that what he said was the truth.

Even if it was the nine elders, what qualifications did they have to posture in front of him?

When he fought with Nineorigin, Nineorigin was at his peak state but was forcefully knocked down a major realm by Ye Yuan.

Now that Ye Yuan’s strength was no idea how many times stronger than that time, at the risk of seriously damaging his small world, it was not like he had no chance of finishing Ru Feng off.

How exalted was Ru Feng’s status? When had he been opposed by people like this before?

He gave a cold snort and said angrily, “Brat, it’s got to go through your head when you’re bragging too! If not for having misgivings with regards to Divine Daughter, you’d already be a dead man now! Come, men! Bring that imprisoned human here!”

“No need, I’ll go personally!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

Ru Feng said in a cold voice, “No way! How can my Hidden Clan’s sacred land be blasphemed by you, a human?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “That’s not up to you!”

Ru Feng was angered until his beard billowed, and he glared as he said furiously, “Brat, don’t think too highly of yourself! Could it be that you think my divine race doesn’t have alchemists?”

Ye Yuan said with a disdainful look, “I’ll give you a chance. You bring Rong Xiyue to go and detoxify the poison, and I’ll go and meet Ning Tianping. If you can resolve Rong Xiyue’s poison, what’s the harm in me and Ning Tianping staying here?”

Arrogant!

Showing contempt!

Ye Yuan was bullying the divine race for having no one!

Ru Feng said with a cold smile, “Ignorant and impudent! This old man will let you die wholeheartedly convinced! Kong Ming, you bring this boy to go meet that human, I’ll bring Divine Daughter to go detoxify the poison!”

Kong Ming bowed and said, “Yes, Third Elder!”

Rong Xiyue looked at Ye Yuan rather surprisedly, not knowing why he would suddenly have a great change in temperament.

She could feel that Ye Yuan was extremely averse toward the divine race.

Furthermore, he had even fought with divine race powerhouses before.

Could it be that he had his closed ones die in the hands of the divine race?

Sending Ye Yuan away with his eyes, Ru Feng said to Rong Xiyue, “This brat’s arrogance is even greater than his strength! This old man hasn’t had killing intent aroused for so many years. It’s the first time today!”

Rong Xiyue smiled bitterly and said, “He originally wasn’t like this. No idea why just now, he suddenly became like this!”

Ru Feng waved his hand and said, “Doesn’t matter anymore. Either way, he’s already a dead man! Come, go with me to detoxify the poison.”

After talking, Ru Feng brought Rong Xiyue and returned to the clan.

The divine race had many alchemy powerhouses too. Logically speaking, Rong Xiyue should be very confident.

But no idea why, she kept feeling that it would not be so easy.

For Ye Yuan to dare come with her, it showed that he was very confident in this poison.

Was Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength really even more formidable than those Eight-marks powerhouses in the clan? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

... ...

A Hidden Clan’s medicinal hut.

It was the place where the Hidden Clan’s alchemy path powerhouses normally studied medicinal pills.

The divine race’s alchemy path was a unique school of thought, but they were mostly from various races. Hence, the essence of alchemy path was mostly the same.

At this time, inside the medicinal hut, the Hidden Clan’s numerous Eight-star Alchemy Gods were gathered together, planning on detoxifying Rong Xiyue’s poison.

Even though Ye Yuan considered everything and everyone beneath his notice, his strength was placed there, Ru Feng really did not dare to underestimate.

Therefore, those he called over were all the Hidden Clan’s alchemy bigshots.

“Lin Yi, you’re the most proficient in detoxifying poison. You help Divine Daughter to take a look!” Ru Feng said to an old man.

The old man nodded slightly and said with disdain, “Leave it to me! A human Empyrean Realm child, what powerful poison can he refine? Third Elder, I think that you can go and execute that punk right now! I heard that that punk was very arrogant.”

Ru Feng frowned and said, “Better take a look first. Divine Daughter said that this boy is very formidable. It is best to be careful.”

Lin Yi had a disdainful look and placed his hand on Rong Xiyue’s wrist, and he started reading her pulse.

Everyone quietened down, casting their gazes toward Lin Yi.

Lin Yi’s face originally had a look of contempt.

But gradually, even he did not notice that his look of disdain gradually faded away, and what replaced it was a solemn expression on his face.

Following that, his brows furrowed tighter and tighter, becoming heavily wrinkled.

The mood of the surrounding crowd also became increasingly more tense along with his brows.

“How can it be? How can it be?” Lin Yu repeatedly shook his head and said.

Seeing Lin Yi let go, even though he knew that there was no hope, Ru Feng still asked.

“How is it?”

Lin Yi shook his head and said, “This poison is so formidable! This old man ... can’t cure it! This toxicity has already fused into one with Her Highness Divine Daughter’s fleshly body. Unless Her Highness Divine Daughter abandons her fleshly body, otherwise, there’s no way to cure it at all!”

At this time, an old man who was sitting at the side said with a disbelieving look, “What a joke! Can there still be a poison that can’t be cured in this world? No matter how powerful the poison, there’s a method to cure it!”

After talking, he also started to diagnose Rong Xiyue’s condition.

When Lin Yi saw this, he said, “Zhao Cheng’s medicinal path is extremely strong. He might have a way.”

Ru Feng nodded his head and could only wait for Zhao Cheng’s diagnosis.

But the change in expression on his face was virtually cut from the same cloth as Lin Yi’s.

Finally, it turned into a long sigh and he shook his head and said, “This poison, this old man can’t cure it!”

Ru Feng naturally did not give up and had these alchemy experts take turns to diagnose Rong Xiyue.

But the final outcome was exactly the same.

Toward this poison, they were all at a loss on what to do.

In the beginning, Ru Feng was still brimming with confidence. But later, he finally understood how terrifying this poison was.

The poison that a human Empyrean refined, no one in the entire Hidden Lineage could cure it!

He was previously still pledging in all solemnity in front of Ye Yuan, who knew that he had his face slapped in a blink of an eye.

Rong Xiyue’s expression also dimmed. But compared to the rest, she was mentally prepared long ago.

Having these people look was merely looking for psychological comfort.

She knew that Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills were already hiked to a sky-high price in the Southern Border. The price was even higher than heavenly emperor spirit treasures!

Even rank eight divine pills were not as valuable as Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills too.

How could the poison that such an alchemy expert refined be easy to resolve?

If it was really easy to cure, would Ye Yuan be silly enough to take the initiative to come to the Hidden Clan with her?

Ru Feng’s expression was very dark. At the thought of Ye Yuan’s gloating face, he almost wanted to vomit blood.

He gathered the alchemy powerhouses in the entire clan, attempting to slap Ye Yuan’s face.

Who knew that in the end, he was slapped resoundingly!
