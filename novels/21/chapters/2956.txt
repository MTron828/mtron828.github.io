Chapter 2955: Nirvanic Soul Clan’s Great Crisis!

“Ancestors, actually, this disciple even discovered this at the entrance area!”

Wang Qian took out a very, very small white crystal. When Yu Tian and the rest saw it, their pupils could not help constricting.

“Spatial origin crystal fragment!”

Yu Tian exclaimed: “Progenitor Imperishable must have entered the Sea of Evil. There’s no mistake!”

Wang Ning also nodded and said, “Progenitor has already searched for this thing for several tens of thousands of years! Didn’t expect that it would actually appear in the abyss rift! This also becomes understandable; Progenitor Imperishable won’t easily brave dangers. No need to hesitate anymore, enter!”

The others responded one after another, already very certain that Progenitor Imperishable entered the Sea of Evil.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed even harder.

The more this was the case, the more he smelled a hint of danger.

Cloudneon, who was by the side, also became aware of Ye Yuan’s expression, her expression stirring slightly.

However, she did not say anything in the end.

Now, all the evidence showed that Progenitor Imperishable was in the Sea of Evil!

Furthermore, with their strength, even if there was really an ambush, they could retreat unscathed too.

Regardless of whether it was Yu Tian or Wang Ning, they were all not ordinary Hegemon Realms.

Their strength was not at all inferior to Hegemon Cloudmount!

There was only Progenitor Imperishable, this level of powerhouse, who could threaten them.

The party stopped hesitating, entering the Sea of Evil!

Upon entering the Sea of Evil, Ye Yuan felt an extremely uncomfortable feeling.

In fact, even soul force was circulating somewhat sluggishly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The turbid air here seemed to have a great suppressing effect on soul bodies.

Ye Yuan felt that in this place, the soul body could only unleash 70% to 80% of its strength.

Even those Hegemon Realms were no exception either.

But, unexpectedly, after entering the Sea of Evil, the surroundings seemed to have become quiet.

Along the way, they actually did not run into a single evil creature!

With this, even Yu Tian they all felt something amiss too.

“Something isn’t right! Wang Qian, are you sure that there’s still the aura that Progenitor Imperishable left behind here?” Yu Tian said with a frown.

Wang Qian nodded his head and said, “Yes! After entering the Sea of Evil, Progenitor’s aura became even thicker. I don’t even need to sense carefully anymore.”

Yu Tian looked toward Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan nodded slightly, expressing approval with Wang Qian.

Indeed, the enshrouding mist origin’s aura here was already very thick.

It looked like this place seemed to have experienced a great battle. Otherwise, the origin aura would not be so thick.

“Brother Yu Tian, this place has already entered that pincer worm’s sphere of influence. But I can’t feel that pincer worm’s aura at all! Something isn’t right here!” Wang Ning said.

But Yu Tian’s gaze looked toward Ye Yuan, his expression somewhat ugly.

Could it be that this guy really hit the mark?

Judging from this situation now, it was very likely!

“Brother Yu Tian, we wouldn’t … have really been schemed against, right?” North Soul Region’s leader, Hegemon Wu Wen said.

Yu Tian’s gaze turned intent, and he spat a word out of his mouth: “Retreat!”

But right at this time, there was a tremor in the void. One figure after another poured out from all directions. There were as many as a hundred people!

Each and every one of the Nirvanic Soul Clan’s powerhouses’ expressions changed drastically.

“Haha, Brother Yu Tian, you finally managed to make a trip to the Sea of Evil. You’re going to leave without even drinking a cup of tea?”

The one speaking was an enormous pincer worm.

Naturally, it was this region’s king.

“Brother Yu Tian, we haven’t met for many years. Why? Not saying hello?”

Yu Tian’s pupils constricted, and he said, “Bloodmourn! Your blood race actually colluded with the abyss rift!”

Bloodmourn, blood race Hegemon, Yu Tian’s old rival.

His strength was not beneath Yu Tian!

Yu Tian never expected that the blood race and abyss rift colluded together.

This was undoubtedly massive bad news to the Nirvanic Soul Clan.

Bloodmourn smiled and said, “The enemy of an enemy is a friend! Yu Tian, such a simple logic, there’s no need for me to tell you, right? However, your old friends aren’t just us. Brother Jun Yi, not coming out to say hello?”

Hearing this name, Yu Tian and the group of Nirvanic Soul Clan Hegemons all trembled all over, their eyes revealing a look of astonishment.

Hegemon Jun Yi, who was wearing azure-colored long robes, slowly walked out. Yu Tian’s eyes had an additional trace of despair.

“Jun Yi! The Qi Soul Clan and Nirvanic Soul Clan belong to the same ancestry no matter what! You guys actually allied with the blood race to deal with us?” Yu Tian gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

With the blood race and abyss joining forces, although he was surprised, he was not angry.

But Jun Yi was the Qi Soul Clan’s powerful hegemon. He actually colluded with the blood race too. This made him incredibly furious.

Jun Yi said coolly, “Same ancestry? Yu Tian, you’re thinking too highly of yourself! Your Nirvanic Soul Clan is our Qi Soul Clan’s dog to begin with! In all the heavens and myriad worlds, there’s only one soul race, whatever Qi Soul Clan doesn’t exist! Imperishable that old thing, he should have died long ago!”

Yu Tian’s entire body trembled, and he said worriedly, “You all … What the hell did you all do to Progenitor Imperishable?”

Jun Yi smiled and said, “Although Imperishable this old thing is known as imperishable, with three great Supreme Hegemons joining hands, even if he doesn’t die, he’ll lose a layer of skin too! Moreover, this time, it’s scheming against the unguarded. He should be having a very bad time now. He might already be dead!”

The Nirvanic Soul Clan members present all sucked in a cold breath.

Three great Supreme Hegemons joined forces!

Without a doubt, these three great Supreme Hegemons were the abyss’ Hegemon Evil Dragon, the blood race’s Hegemon Bloodsong, as well as the Qi Soul Clan’s Hegemon Heavenly Soul!

These three people actually joined forces!

These three great Hegemons joining forces, they could practically sweep across a world!

Although Hegemon Imperishable was strong, under the joint forces of these three people, his life or death was really hard to say!

An atmosphere of despair spread in the Nirvanic Soul Clan.

Even the Hegemons suffered a huge blow to morale at this time too.

Hegemon Imperishable was the Nirvanic Soul Clan’s strongest person and also their totem, their spiritual leader.

Now, Hegemon Imperishable might be dying. Their blow could be imagined.

Bloodmourn smiled and said, “Brother Yu Tian had better worry about yourself. In order to lure you all out, we paid a considerable price! However, as long as you all, these five great regions’ leaders are dead, the Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven will basically be finished. From now on, our blood race will share control of Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven with the soul race!”

Yu Tian glared at Jun Yi and said, “You all are asking a tiger for its skin! The blood race’s ambitions, all the heavens know! You all are actually working with them!”

Jun Yi smiled and said, “The soul race and blood race are both chaos races, the top species in all the heavens! We are of the same kind!”

The Qi Soul Clan had always been high and mighty.

They looked down on the Nirvanic Soul Clan, but because of Hegemon Imperishable’s existence, they could not do anything to the nirvanic soul clan.

All the way until the blood race found them, they discovered that the opportunity had arrived!

Of course, the blood race naturally paid a huge price in order to join forces with the Qi Soul Clan.

And the abyss rift were of one body and two faces with the soul race; natural enemies.

The matters of the world mutually promoted and restrained each other.

And the abyss species was the nemesis of the soul race.

In this situation, the Nirvanic Soul Clan had already reached the juncture of life and death survival!
