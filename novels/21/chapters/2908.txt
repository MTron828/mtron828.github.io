Chapter 2914: It’s Really a Small World!

Each and every one of the Sublime Pill Sect’s disciples was bound by a common hatred for the enemy, wishing that they could perish together.

Bullying people too far!

This soul envoy did not give the Sublime Pill Sect any way out!

“Die in glory rather than live on in dishonor. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Right, we’re not scared of death! At most, we’ll fight it out to the death!”

“Sect Master, we’ve had enough a long time ago! These few years, we’ve lived worse than dogs! Fight it out with him!” As he talked, this newly advanced Emperor Realm powerhouse was looking at Zhang Zuoshan.

… …

Thousands of years of accumulated resentment had completely erupted at this moment.

The soul race did not give any way out at all. This was wiping out their True Sovereign Heavens and above in one fell swoop.

Without even True Sovereign Heavens, was the Sublime Pill Sect still the Sublime Pill Sect?

Zhang Zuoshan stood behind the soul envoy with a smile that was not a smile.

The Sublime Pill Sect bringing about their own destruction, he was happy to see it happen.

Thinking back then, he was like a dog in front of the Sublime Pill Sect.

Now, he finally felt exaltation upon fulfillment.

“All shut up for me!” Wang Jun roared angrily, suppressing everyone’s voices.

In the Sublime Pill Sect, Wang Jun’s prestige was still extremely high.

He forcefully suppressed the fury in his heart and said in a solemn voice, “What can mutual destruction achieve? My Sublime Pill Sect has a lineage of tens of thousands of years. It can’t be cut off just like that! We’ll … go!”

Wang Jun virtually depleted all of his strength to utter the word ‘go.’

He knew that if he went, the Sublime Pill Sect would be completely beaten into the dirt.

But there was no choice!

What could resisting do?

The four of them Emperor Realms added up might not be Zhang Zuoshan’s match too!

Rather than dying in vain, it was better to leave some descendants behind for the Sublime Pill Sect!

Presumably, the True Sovereign Heavens would have all died out. The soul race would not go so far as to target some Saint Sovereign Heavens, right?

After all, if these people went, they would only be cannon fodders too.

“Liu Xin, from now on, you’re the Sublime Pill Sect’s sect master!” Wang Jun looked at a grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven and said.

Liu Xin’s eyes were filled with tears, kneeling down with a thud.

Life-and-death parting

The soul envoy smiled and said, “That’s right. This is the wise move! Moreover, going to the Scarlet Drill Battlefield might not be a road that leads to death. Maybe it will be your lucky chance too! In that place, there are many people who break through the fetters and break through realms repeatedly, becoming overlords of a region! You all don’t need to be so pessimistic. Alright, whatever you have to hand over, hurry up and hand it over. And then we’re leaving.”

… …

Half a day later, the soul envoy escorted a group of Sublime Pill Sect powerhouses, and they were prepared to leave.

The entire Sublime Pill Sect was in a state of misery.

At this time, Wang Jun already recovered calmness. He instructed Liu Xin, his gaze sincere as he said, “Liu Xin, I only have one request for you. No matter how hard it is, you have to let the Sublime Pill Sect survive too!”

When he said this, Ye Yuan’s figure appeared in Wang Jun’s mind.

With him around, the Sublime Pill Sect would not die!

So what if there were no True Sovereign Heavens?

With him around, before long, the Sublime Pill Sect would have a large batch of True Sovereign Heavens appear again!

Emperor Realms would absolutely not be far beyond reach too!

Ye Yuan was in a closed-seclusion. From the start until now, nobody in the Sublime Pill Sect mentioned Ye Yuan’s name.

Firstly, they were grateful to Ye Yuan and could not drag Ye Yuan into the water.

Secondly, they all tacitly felt that with Ancestor Ye around, the Sublime Pill Sect still had a tomorrow!

Of course, Wang Jun they all did not feel that Ye Yuan appearing could change anything.

It was true that he was a genius.

But, facing a behemoth like the soul race, a genius could not change anything.

Ancestor Hang Yang was Emperor Sakra Heaven, something that even an Emperor Sakra Heaven could not change, what could a measly little True Sovereign Heaven change?

When Liu Xin heard that, he knelt down again with a thud and said in tears, “Liu Xin remembers Sect Master’s teachings! Sect Master … take care!”

Zhang Zuoshan smiled lightly and said,?“Tsk tsk,?what a touching scene! Lord Soul Envoy, the Sublime Pill Sect is so ignorant about what’s good for them. Can you send them to Tiankui Front?”

The soul envoy nodded slightly and said,?“Mn,?Tiankui Front there is indeed short on people.”

One sentence made the expressions of Wang Jun and the rest change again.

Tiankui Front was the Scarlet Drill Battlefield’s most dangerous place.

The cruelty did not lose to South Qi Giant City!

Going there was virtually certain death!

Ancestor Hang Yang died at the Tiankui Front.

If looks could kill, Zhang Zuoshan would have already died God knows how many times.

The soul envoy did not care about these gazes in the slightest. He just said coolly, “Alright, stop talking crap. Set off!”

Everyone was just about to leave, but two figures blocked their path.

Seeing the arrival, Wang Jun’s pupils constricted.

He glared at Li Jianshen, who was next to Ye Yuan, and said with an angry roar, “Li Jianshen! Ancestor Ye has treated you with kindness. Why are you harming him!”

The arrival was precisely Ye Yuan.

Next to him was a Saint Sovereign Heaven disciple, Li Jianshen.

This Li Jianshen had a very outstanding alchemy talent. Ye Yuan found him very promising.

During these few years, he frequently gave guidance to Li Jianshen. His strength also advanced rapidly.

Just like that, he already became the number one person under Liu Xin.

Wang Jun did not expect that this guy actually secretly went to find Ye Yuan!

The moment Ye Yuan appeared, he could not escape anymore!

Hence, when he saw Ye Yuan appear, Wang Jun was beyond furious.

The moment Zhang Zuoshan saw Ye Yuan, he could not help smiling.?“Yo,?it turns out that there’s still a True Sovereign Heaven hiding! Wang Jun, what gall you have! Lord Soul Envoy, looks like if we don’t teach them a lesson, this bunch of guys won’t be obedient!?Mn??Lord Soul Envoy?”

The soul envoy ignored Zhang Zuoshan, but his pair of eyes were glued on Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was extremely surprised too and was currently sizing the soul envoy up, a hint of a smile surfacing at the corners of his mouth.

“Huhu,?it’s really a small world! I didn’t expect that I could actually meet an old friend in Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven! Yan Jadetrue, how have you been?” Ye Yuan said with a beam.

That was right. This lord soul envoy was precisely the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s ancestor who schemed against Ye Yuan back then and was sent packing by Ye Yuan, Yan Jadetrue!

After the farewell back then, Ye Yuan never saw Yan Jadetrue again.

He never expected that he crossed a world to arrive at Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven and actually met Yan Jadetrue!

Furthermore, he even became the soul race’s soul envoy!

To talk about this Yan Jadetrue, he was really fated to not die.

Originally, he was severely wounded by Ye Yuan and also inflicted with the soul poison, it was very hard to recover his peak strength again.

Furthermore, in his condition, he could not cross the sea and go to Heaven One Continent at all.

In the sea, he similarly suffered a frenzied pursuit.

But who could have expected that when he fled to the bottom of the sea, he actually discovered a mystic realm.

That mystic realm was even left behind by an Emperor Realm soul denizen.

Not only did Yan Jadetrue obtain an Emperor Realm’s legacy, he even entered the realm passageway between Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven in an accident arising from many causes, finally arriving at Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven!

Later, by relying on that Emperor Realm inheritance as well as his own intellect, not only did he enter the soul race, he even became a soul envoy.

It was just that he never expected to actually bump into his sworn enemy, Ye Yuan, in this Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven!

After being taken aback, Yan Jadetrue came back to his senses very quickly. Looking at Ye Yuan with a smile, he said, “This envoy is well, very well! Ye Yuan, since you appeared in the Sublime Pill Sect, then follow them to the Scarlet Drill Battlefield!”
