Chapter 2707: Brothers Infighting!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The golden eagle older brother’s heart shook wildly!

His Apocalyptic Storm actually could not quite block Ye Yuan’s Dragon Spring Sword!

Each of Ye Yuan’s sword slash carried an unstoppable power, making his blood vitality churn.

Only at this time did he realize how terrifying the power of this grandmist treasure was!

He even felt like who he was facing seemed to be a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

“This grandmist treasure’s power is too strong. Continue fighting like this, there’s no chance of winning at all! Leave!”

The golden eagle older brother saw through the actual situation. How could he still dare to stay, turning around and fleeing?

When this scene landed in the eyes of the numerous Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum leaders, they could not help feeling stunned.

The golden eagle older brother was driven away?

A dignified Jade Sovereign Heaven was actually driven away by a Limitless Sublime Heaven!

For a moment, the morale of the troops was lost.

Even the Jade Sovereign Heaven was sent packing, what was the use no matter how many people they had?

After Ye Yuan rushed over later, wouldn’t they still be stretching their necks out for the executer’s blade?

What the golden eagle older brother comprehended was the rule of wind, his movement technique swift to the extreme.

In an instant, he escaped ten miles away!

But all of a sudden, he felt a chill coming from behind, making his hair stand on end.

In the air, he forcibly turned directions and moved laterally.

Boom!

A fissure that was several hundred feet long was directly cleaved apart on the ground.

When the golden eagle older brother saw this scene, he lost his soul.

If not for him cultivating the rule of wind and his movement technique being extremely fast, this sword earlier would have definitely taken his life!

Turning around to look, he discovered that Ye Yuan was currently looking at him not far away, his face full of mockery.

“Brat, we don’t want this Three Saint Ridge anymore! Just take it as if today’s matter didn’t happen!” Boss Golden Eagle gritted his teeth and said.

He wished to devour Ye Yuan whole. But circumstances were stronger than people. He was not Ye Yuan’s match and could only yield.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “Going back on your word so fast? Just now, didn’t you say that you were going to slice me into thousands of pieces to avenge your younger brother? Why? Not taking revenge anymore?”

The golden eagle older brother secretly hated him in his heart, but he said, “Old Second only had himself to blame for underestimating the enemy. This enmity, I’m not avenging anymore! Little Brother, don’t pester me. Let’s stay out of each other’s business from now on, alright?”

But how could Ye Yuan be so easy to hoodwink? He smiled coldly and said, “Staying out of each other’s business, do you really take me to be a greenhorn? You want to leave, sure, cripple your own cultivation.”

Golden eagle older brother’s gaze turned cold and he said in a chilly voice, “Brat, don’t push people too far! If a Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouse really wants to fight it out to the death, it’s not what you can bear!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Is that so? Then I want to see how strong a Jade Sovereign Heaven’s desperate blow is!”

“Humph!?You forced me!” The golden eagle older brother naturally would not surrender without resistance. He gave a cold snort, his aura erupting once more.

But right at this time, a pale yellow figure rushed out of the forest, his speed being swift to the extreme.

The golden eagle older brother was currently launching a martial technique and was caught off-guard by this figure that suddenly dashed out.

Puchi!

The golden eagle older brother’s throat was directly bitten by a gaping maw, fresh blood flowing.

Being bitten, the golden eagle older brother seemed to have lost all the strength in his body, his breath suddenly dissipating.

Very soon, he stopped moving and breathed his last.

Ye Yuan’s expression became serious.

What bit the golden eagle older brother to death was a pale yellow leopard!

This leopard emitted an extremely powerful aura, it actually reached middle Jade Sovereign Heaven!

The leopard flicked its neck and threw the golden eagle older brother’s corpse to one side. Opening its ferocious-looking mouth, it said disdainfully, “These two fools, they can’t even handle a Limitless Sublime Heaven! Really useless!”

At this time, fresh blood was still flowing from the leopard’s mouth, looking very ferocious and terrifying.

There were rustling sounds in the dense forest again. Several figures walked out slowly again.

Without exception, they were all Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

Ye Yuan swept a glance over, nine great Jade Sovereign Heaven experts actually appeared!

Two of them were even middle Jade Sovereign Heaven!

The directions that these nine great true spirits appeared were very particular, blocking all of Ye Yuan’s path of retreat.

The leopard looked at Ye Yuan, gushing with a bloody breath as it said, “Boy, leave behind the grandmist treasure in your hand, and then end yourself!”

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said in a solemn voice, “Nine Jade Sovereign Heavens! I didn’t expect that Shuoyan’s nine older brothers actually joined forces to deal with him!?Heh heh,?really good brothers!”

Ye Yuan took every conceivable possibility into account but was ultimately not a prophet.

He could foresee that this trip was dangerous and even guessed that Hefeng would divulge information to the enemy. But he did not expect that Shuoyan’s nine older brothers actually all sent out Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses to kill him!

A puny little Shuoyan was naturally not worthy of the nine of them going to war.

The only explanation was that Hefeng was very apprehensive of him. Hence, he united with the other eight people to doom him to death!

Such great work!

These nine Jade Sovereign Heavens were definitely not Bright Tiger King’s subordinates, but they were the private armies of the nine of them.

These few guys really put down the blood capital.

The leopard said coolly, “Boy, you’re very smart! However, it’s also useless no matter how clever you are! Third Young Master wants you dead!”

This leopard was naturally the Eight-spotted Leopard that Hefeng spoke of.

Ye Yuan was very wary of this Eight-spotted Leopard. Because judging from the scene of him killing the golden eagle older brother earlier, this guy’s movement technique was absolutely not beneath his!

The Eight-spotted Leopard’s comprehension was the same; rule of wind. But his rule of wind was much stronger than the golden eagle older brother’s.

It even touched spatial rule!

Therefore, his speed was so fast that even the golden eagle older brother was killed before he could react.

Apart from him, that Purplelight Battle Wolf similarly posed a huge threat to Ye Yuan.

The others, their auras were not the least bit weaker than the Golden Eagle Dual Fiends too.

In an instant, Ye Yuan actually fell into a desperate situation.

Got to admit, Shuoyan was very brave and good at fighting. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Following the Golden Eagle Dual Fiends’ defeat, he actually led his army and killed the few great leaders until they fled in all directions.

When those few great leaders saw that the golden eagle older brother was killed too, they did not have the courage to fight anymore. Each and every one of them was running away madly.

When Shuoyan saw that Ye Yuan was surrounded by numerous Jade Sovereign Heavens, his tiger eyes suddenly changed too.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan! I’ll come and save you!” As he said, Shuoyan led the army and was about to rush over.

But Ye Yuan shouted coldly, “Leave me alone, hurry up and run!”

How could Shuoyan be willing to listen, still insisting on rushing over?

But right at this time, one wave of army after another charged out of the dense woods again, surrounding Shuoyan’s army tightly again.

When Shuoyan saw this scene, his eyes could not help revealing a look of despair.

He could tell that this true spirit army’s combat power was even higher than the previous wave!

“Why?! Why is this?! Do my elder brothers want me dead so much?” Shuoyan roared at the Eight-spotted Leopard.

Eight-spotted Leopard sneered and said, “Young Master Saint Sovereign, this place is the Myriad Demons Mountain! Your Royal Father also killed his way out from his brothers, and then he achieved half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven in the end! In this jungle, there are no brothers. There is only slaughter! Whoever is stronger, whoever can become the true king! Your threat is too great.. Hence, your older brothers are all very fearful. So … they can only kill you before you grow up!”
