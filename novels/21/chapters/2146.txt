Chapter 2150: What a Great Fortuitous Encounter!

Above the void, several figures were akin to moths flying into the fire, pouncing over toward the powerful existence.

Long Chi had an impatient look on his face, clearly very annoyed.

The restriction of Heavenly Dao Oaths on Martial Dao powerhouses was extremely great. Lu-er and the rest were currently unleashing suicide attacks against him. It would naturally be fatal to him.

At this time, if other people made a move to kill Lu-er and the others, it would be the same as him violating the oath, and he would likewise be erased by Heavenly Dao.

Being restricted by the Heavenly Dao Oath, he did not dare to actually deal a killing blow either, being annoyed badly by Lu-er and the rest.

At this time, Loneswan, Ning Tianping, Yang Fei-er, and Loneswan, were covered in blood all over, already having sustained extremely heavy injuries.

A casual wave of Long Chi’s hands was simply a destructive blow to them.

However, this was precisely what they desired!

Use the Heavenly Dao Oath to kill him!

Hence, even if their injuries were extremely severe, they also dragged their weary bodies and unleashed suicide attacks.

“Humph! A bunch of ants, do you really think that this Emperor can’t do anything to you?”

Long Chi grabbed with one hand, an unrivaled domain force directly imprisoned everyone.

Even Loneswan, this Empyrean, was unable to move a muscle too.

The might of a Heavenly Emperor was displayed in its entirety!

Ning Tianping’s eyes turned bloodshot from anger and he roared furiously, “F*cking Long Chi! If you have the capabilities, kill this father of yours! Otherwise, I will tear you to shreds one day!”

Long Chi had a disdainful look as he said, “Wildly arrogant and ignorant! The more you cultivate, the more you’ll understand the disparity between True Gods and Heavenly Emperor! It’s impossible for you to be this Emperor’s match your whole life!”

“Long Chi, you despicable villain! There will come one day when I’ll settle this score with you!” Lu-er yelled at the top of her voice.

The current Lu-er’s eyes were full of hatred.

She secretly swore to definitely cultivate properly after today, to avenge Young Master.

Long Chi’s brows furrowed slightly, his heart somewhat rippling.

He thought nothing of the others, but Lu-er was a little special.

With his vision, he could naturally perceive Lu-er’s talent.

Although the realm of Heavenly Emperor was extremely difficult, Lu-er had hopes of breaking through.

If allowed to take its own course, this lass might be a great enemy in the future.

“Damn it! That brat dug a pit for me! Really troublesome! I didn’t expect that this Emperor was clever for a lifetime, but I’m actually scammed by a dead person in the end!”

Only at this time did Long Chi come to realize the truth. When Ye Yuan forced him to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath, he actually secretly dug a pit.

He could not kill Lu-er they all, but Lu-er could kill him! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Right now, Lu-er they all were naturally ants in Long Chi’s eyes.

But, ten thousand years later, 100 thousand years later, a million years later?

With Lu-er’s talent, breaking through to be a Heavenly Emperor might also not be impossible.

If there was really that day, it would be troublesome.

Long Chi felt gloomy in his heart, wishing to dig Ye Yuan out of his grave and pummel brutally.

“Humph! Do you think that this Emperor can’t do anything to you like this? Right now, this Emperor will seal your divine sea and imprison you forever in Raindragon Stronghold! I want to see how you guys still plan to take revenge!” Long Chi said with a cold smile.

Everyone’s faces changed drastically, clearly not expecting that this guy was so vicious.

Seeing the expressions of Lu-er and the others, Long Chi had a smug look as he said, “Heh heh, weren’t you all very cocky just now? Lift your heads and take a look at this blue sky! This will be the last time that you’ll be seeing it!”

Finished talking, Long Chi’s finger lightly tapped. A powerful force tore through the air and was about to seal Lu-er’s divine sea.

Yet, right at this time, a change suddenly occurred!

Layers of ripples emerged in the air, Lu-er’s figure disappeared bizarrely.

Long Chi’s pupils constricted and he said in a thunderous rage, “Who is it? Get out for this Emperor!”

The void rippled, a figure emerged. Who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

“Do you still want face or not, old dog?” Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and looked at Long Chi, full of killing intent.

“Your Excellency!”

“Master!”

When Ning Tianping and the rest saw Ye Yuan, they could not help being pleasantly surprised.

While on the other side, Long Chi’s eyeballs were almost popping out.

He had an expression like he had seen a ghost as he said in shock, “Ye Yuan! You ... You came out of the Dragon Eye Cave? This ... This isn’t possible!”

Ye Yuan narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, “What’s impossible about it? Am I not standing perfectly well in front of you?”

In Ye Yuan’s embrace was the extremely weak Lu-er. But currently, she had a happy look.

Originally, hearing Long Chi’s description of the Dragon Eye Cave, Lu-er already completely lost all hope.

She already made the resolve to take revenge for Ye Yuan.

But in a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan actually appeared in front of her alive and well. There was really nothing more blissful than this.

“Young Master, it’s really great that you’re fine!” Lu-er hugged Ye Yuan tightly as she said in surprise.

Ye Yuan’s face revealed a hint of a smile and said, “Silly girl, so desperate for what? Didn’t Young Master promise you that I’ll definitely return within ten years?”

Lu-er nodded her head hard, a blissful look on her face.

Long Chi had not recovered from his shock yet when suddenly, his pupils shrunk again.

“You ... You broke through to the Empyrean Realm? This ... This is impossible! A short ten years, you broke through to be an Empyrean in a place like the Dragon Eye Cave?”

The aura exuding from Ye Yuan’s body clearly already surpassed True God Realm, reaching the level of Empyrean Realm.

In fact, the aura on Ye Yuan’s body was even more than a magnitude stronger than ordinary First Firmament Empyreans.

A short ten years, going from Seventh Firmament True God to First Firmament Empyrean, Long Chi doubted whether he saw wrongly or not.

Furthermore, the current Ye Yuan actually gave him a feeling of absolute secrecy, as if it was a dense fog in front of him.

Logically speaking, when a Heavenly Emperor looked at an Empyrean, that was seeing through at one glance. Why would this kind of illogical feeling appear?

The commotion here already attracted quite a few people to surround and watch.

Feeling the aura on Ye Yuan’s body, the Dragon Clan’s powerhouses burst into an uproar all at once.

“Wasn’t it said that one can’t cultivate in the Dragon Eye Cave, and that it’s a hopeless land? How ...How did he cultivate?”

“This is too fake! Forget about the Dragon Eye Cave! Even on the Heavenspan Mountain, it’s also impossible to break through to the Empyrean Realm from Seventh Firmament True God in ten years too!”

“Just what kind of freak is this fellow? Not only did he break through to be an Empyrean, he even came out of the Dragon Eye Cave!”

... ...

The things that happened to Ye Yuan were seriously too illogical, making them incredibly shocked.

At this time, the other Raindragon Stronghold heavenly emperors also arrived one after another. Seeing the ‘Empyrean Realm’ Ye Yuan, each and every one of them was shocked until their jaws hit the ground.

Wasn’t the Dragon Eye Cave a hopeless land?

Wasn’t it without chances of returning?

Wasn’t one unable to cultivate?

But what was with this scene before their eyes?

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Speaking of which, really have to thank you for giving me a lucky chance! If not for you forcing me into the Dragon Eye Cave, it would really not be that easy for me to break through to be an Empyrean!”

Long Chi opened his mouth wide, wanting to say something, but could not speak at all.

At this very moment, he wished to give himself two tight slaps.

Although he did not know what Ye Yuan experienced inside the Dragon Eye Cave, the strength of his Empyrean Realm was real.

Giving good fortune, this sort of thing, was simply a divine stroke by the gods.

He clearly wanted to doom Ye Yuan. In the end, after ten years, Ye Yuan returned domineeringly, becoming an Empyrean!

Such a blessed lad!
