Chapter 1694 Jumping Clowns

Qiao Anshan never dreamed that the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, which only had two Celestial Deity powerhouses, actually dared to have a battle with him!

After guarding bitterly for ten years, every important communication route of Heavenly Eagle’s yielded nothing, making Qiao Anshan badly depressed.

One had to know, he paid a considerable price in order to seal off Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

After all, he, a powerhouse from Utmost Peace Imperial City, had no way of completely covering Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

But the final result was pointlessly wasting ten years.

“City Lord, the day of the Golden Sword Pact is getting closer and closer. Zuo Shujie that guy wouldn’t really want to fight to the bitter end with us, right?” Wen Yilin asked rather anxiously.

Qiao Anshan had a feeling like his heart was dripping blood. Hearing that, he said in a cold voice, “Since Zuo Shujie himself wants to seek death, then this seat will fulfill his wishes! This time, we’ll wipe out Heavenly Eagle Imperial City while we’re at it, turning it into our puppet!”

Wen Yilin nodded and said, “This is them courting death, then we can’t be blamed!”

Between imperial cities, if it was not a last resort, they would not exterminate the other party.

Killing a thousand of the enemy, losing 800 of your own. Although Qiao Anshan’s strength was strong, if he really wanted to kill Zuo Shujie, he would pay a terrible price too.

The truly weak ones had long been eradicated.

Now, those able to survive were clearly all not weaklings.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was just relatively weaker.

And Zuo Shujie was the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s sea-stabilizing needle.

But the situation this time was somewhat different. Qiao Anshan finally could not hold back anymore.

“As long as this seat refines the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, I’ll be able to break through to become a third-layered heaven Celestial Deity! At that time, our Utmost Peace Imperial City will be sufficient to rank in the top three among the Southridge Ten Cities! Therefore, even at the risk of severe injuries, we have to obtain the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain this time too!” Qiao Anshan said in a solemn voice.

...

On this day, the cloud and winds above Heavenly Eagle Imperial City suddenly changed erratically.

Over a dozen powerhouses stepped over through the air. The commotion created was astonishing! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The faces of the powerhouses in the city all changed drastically. They knew that the moment of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s life and death had arrived!

Receiving the Golden Sword Token, it must be announced to the whole city.

Everyone in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City had long known that Utmost Peace Imperial City was going to activate the Golden Sword Pact already.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s powerhouses all looked up to the sky. That powerful line-up virtually made them despair.

“Four great Celestial Deity powerhouses! This ... is finally coming?”

“Wonder whether or not Heavenly Eagle can make it through the crisis this time!”

“Fighting two-on-four, this ... I completely can’t see hope!”

“Sigh! Utmost Peace Imperial City’s action is too fast! If give Head Elder Ye Yuan some more time, perhaps it wouldn’t be today’s situation!”

...

In these ten years, everyone in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City felt the danger.

But this was also Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s most united ten years.

The various major families gave up internal friction, putting more effort into cultivation.

Under the catalyzing of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City gave birth to a large batch of powerhouses.

Presently, in the city, just the ninth-layered heaven Divine Lords were as many as three people.

Except, ninth-layered heaven Divine Lords were completely useless to battles at Celestial Deity level!

In front of Celestial Deity powerhouses, forget about ninth-layered heaven Divine Lords, even half-step celestial deities were ant-like existences.

“Zuo Shujie, get out for this seat!”

A thunderous voice instantly reverberated throughout the entire city.

Qiao Anshan’s shout, the commotion was extremely shocking.

He was deliberately demonstrating his strength, awing the powerhouses in the city.

At this time, two figures arrived high up in the air. They were precisely Zuo Shujie and He Chong.

Zuo Shujie looked at Qiao Anshan and said coldly, “Qiao Anshan, the hour hasn’t arrived yet. Lord Inspector hasn’t arrived as well. Flaunting your prowess like this, are you really bullying that my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City doesn’t have anyone?”

Qiao Anshan laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Zuo Shujie, the Golden Sword Token has already been issued. We’re naturally avenging grievances if there are, taking revenge if there’s grudge! Lord Inspector hasn’t arrived yet, so let’s settle the previous scores!”

Zuo Shujie’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said in a cold voice, “What trouble do you want to stir up again?”

At this time, a figure on Utmost Peace’s side stepped out of the ranks and said in an angry voice, “It’s me! The enmity of killing my master is irreconcilable! The last time, City Lord was in closed-seclusion. That’s how you forcefully stopped it! This time, I must take revenge for Master! Hurry up and let that Zheng Qi guy come out to die!”

This person was none other than precisely Gao Yuan’s disciple, Yang Fan!

Celestial Deity powerhouse Wen Yilin was Gao Yuan’s master, while Gao Yuan was this Yang Fan’s master.

Speaking of which, Wen Yilin and Coldfeather were considered people of the same generation.

This Yang Fan’s talent was clearly limited. Until now, he was merely an eighth-layered heaven Divine Lord, being far worse than Zheng Qi.

If not for knowing that Zheng Qi’s essence was lost, even by lending Yang Fan a few galls, he also would not dare to come to challenge Zheng Qi.

However, after Zheng Qi recovered, he rarely showed face. Hence, Utmost Peace Imperial City that side did not know that Zheng Qi had actually long gone up a level already.

This attitude was struck too dazzlingly!

At this time, in everyone’s eyes, this Yang Fan was like a jumping clown.

Clearly, someone who bullied the kind and feared the wicked, yet, still wanted to put on eagerness to take revenge for his master.

Bluffing who?

One had to know, back then, when Zheng Qi went to take revenge, he went to Utmost Peace Imperial City all by himself!

Zuo Shujie did not know it beforehand. When he found out, he rushed to Utmost Peace Imperial City straightaway, only then saving the seriously injured Zuo Shujie who was dying.

But this Yang Fan?

That was Wen Yilin leading him over!

With Wen Yilin around, could it be that Heavenly Eagle Imperial City really dared to do anything to him still?

Prating on and on about taking revenge, it was truly a bit too fake.

Putting it bluntly, it was bullying that he was injured!

The great battle was about to commence, getting a jumping clown to come out made the powerhouses on Heavenly Eagle’s side relax a little.

Zuo Shujie had the intent to mess with Qiao Anshan. At once, his brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Yang Fan, you’re harassing with unreasonable demands! Last time, Zheng Qi was already beaten to severe injuries by you. What do you want still?”

Yang Fan sneered and said, “Zheng Qi this guy wanted to harm Master many times! Now, he finally succeeded! Humph, not killing him, I’m not worthy as a man!”

Zuo Shujie gave a cold snort, flicked his sleeves grandly, and said, “Zheng Qi is currently in closed-seclusion and isn’t convenient to accept the challenge!”

At this time, Qiao Anshan said with a broad smile, “Zuo Shujie, back then, Zheng Qi came to find Gao Yuan to take revenge, this seat didn’t stop it! What’s with your deal now? Yang Fan and Zheng Qi are of the same generation and can be said to have irreconcilable enmity! This kind of enmity, how can we intervene? If you don’t let him come out, then this seat will take action and destroy his manor first before talking! Even if Lord Inspector came, he wouldn’t say much either!”

Zuo Shujie felt great in his heart, but he had rage on his face as he said, “Qiao Anshan, you don’t push people too far!”

Qiao Anshan smiled and said, “Blood debt is paid for by blood, how is this called pushing people too far?”

Zuo Shujie’s expression changed several times and he shouted to the city below, “Send people! Go and invite Head Elder Zheng Qi here!”

“Yes, City Lord!” A deacon received the order and left.

Actually, Zheng Qi was really in closed-seclusion. Even Zuo Shujie did not know his current situation as well.

His current mood was also in a mess. Success or failure lay in this one fell swoop as well.

If Zheng Qi was unable to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm, then Heavenly Eagle Imperial City will really perish this time!
