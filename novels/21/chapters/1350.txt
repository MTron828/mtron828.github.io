Chapter 1354: Utterly Devoid of Conscience!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bean-sized sweat beads seeped out on Wang Xuanfeng’s forehead. He did not doubt Ye Yuan’s words in the slightest.

Originally, their understanding of Ye Yuan was an alchemist harmless to men and beasts.

Now, that gentle image of Ye Yuan’s had long collapsed with a loud bang already. A smile of his currently gave people a feeling of terror.

Everyone knew the terror of Brightraise City’s Wang Family, but Ye Yuan killed Wang Su without the slightest hesitation!

This guy was too crazy!

“I ... I’ll say! I’ll say!”

Wang Xuanfeng could not withstand Ye Yuan’s oppression, finally loosening his mouth.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Remember to swear a Heavenly Dao oath.”

Wang Xuanfeng nodded his head helplessly, the last trace of hope leaving with it too.

Swearing a Heavenly Dao oath, Wang Xuanfeng said everything that happened in the City Lord Manor, making everyone fear-stricken.

The reality was totally opposite of what Wang Su said!

The City Lord Manor allied with the three great families to coerce the Myriad Treasure Tower and sit idly and reap the fruits of others’ labor, simply shameless to the extreme.

It was just that they did not expect Ye Yuan actually had such strength and did not fear their coercion at all!

Only at this time did people know why Ye Yuan was so calm and collected.

Not doing things that went against one’s conscience, one did not fear ghosts knocking at the door!

The Wang Family courting death themselves, so how could others be blamed?

Moreover, the Wang Family even sent three great elders to hunt Ye Yuan down previously. This enmity was long sowed already.

Ye Yuan taking revenge was perfectly justified. Nobody dared to say anything.

Rather, when that Wang Pianran heard finish these, her entire person stood transfixed there.

She completely did not dare to believe that the truth of the matter was actually like this!

Disregarding that Wang Su joined hands with Chen Yongnian to kill her father, they even wanted to instigate her group of people to come and frame the Myriad Treasure Tower!

At this time, Ye Yuan suddenly said to Wang Xuanfeng, “Is that all? Wang Pianran, this fat woman, coming here, it’s probably not just splashing dirty water so simple, right?”

Wang Xuanfeng’s entire body trembled. He deliberately left a segment unsaid just now, out of fear of inciting public wrath.

The Heavenly Dao oath he swore was also very clever, only saying that events that happened at the City Lord Manor on that day.

He even thought that he could hide from Ye Yuan, but did not expect that Ye Yuan actually detected it keenly.

“N-No more!”

The stammering Wang Xuanfeng immediately aroused everybody’s suspicions.

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “Really no more? Since there’s no more, then you have no value in being alive anymore as well. I’ll send you on your way here!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching, staring at Wang Xuanfeng sternly.

Wang Xuanfeng trembled, and he said stammeringly, “Still ... Still have. Wang Su and Chen Yongnian came to an agreement to send people to exterminate the entire Wang Family tonight, then count this score on Ye Yuan’s head! This way, Brightraise City’s main family will have sufficient excuse to send a punitive expedition and forcefully kill Ye Yuan!”

Wang Xuanfeng’s words were even more bone-piercingly cold than that gust of Yin wind Gui Yun brought just now.

This Wang Su was simply utterly devoid of conscience, to actually want to exterminate his branch family!

It was not too much for this kind of person to die a hundred times!

When Ye Yuan killed people just now, they still felt that Ye Yuan killed people without batting an eyelid.

Looking at it now, well done!

Liberating!

Wang Pianran was quivering at one side, afraid, but even more so, it was anger.

Not only did this Wang Su deceive them and make use of them, he even wanted to exterminate every last one of them!

Her father requesting help from their main family was simply inviting a wolf into the house!

Wang Su’s actions made her have a feeling akin to falling into an ice cellar.

“I ... I said all that I know, so can ... you can let me go?” Wang Xuanfeng asked weakly.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Since you’ve restored my innocence, you can naturally go.”

Wang Xuanfeng felt akin to being granted amnesty and was just about to leave, but had the exit blocked by the Wang Family’s people. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Wang Family’s people all wore mourning attires, glaring at Wang Xuanfeng.

The Wang Family’s people were long burning with rage already.

They were sold by Wang Su and even had to help him count the money.

This feeling of being cheated, this sense of humiliation, already made them lose their reason.

Unfortunately, Wang Xuanfeng had his divine sea sealed currently, unable to utilize divine essence at all.

Wang Xuanfeng’s expression changed, falling back several steps, but discovered that the path to the rear was already blocked by people.

“You ... What are you guys trying to do? Every injustice had its perpetrator, every debt its debtor! All of this was done by Wang Su, it had nothing to do with me! If you all let me leave, I’ll tell the main family and let them come and assist you!” Wang Xuanfeng said with a fearful look.

“Humph! Let you leave, then bring a group of people to come and eradicate our Jewelhill City’s branch family?”

“Even if this thing was done by Wang Su, you’re an insider! You didn’t stop him from doing so as well, it’s tantamount to acquiescence!”

“You’re a member of Wang Family too! Passively watching members of the same clan killing each other, your conscience is eaten by dogs!”

...

The Wang Family’s people were all furious to the extreme, wishing to swallow Wang Xuanfeng whole.

Wang Xuanfeng was a lamb awaiting slaughter at this time. He shouted to Ye Yuan in despair, “Ye Yuan, I already said everything I know. You promised to let me go!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I already let you go. Right now, it’s the Wang Family not letting you go. It has nothing to do with me!”

Wang Xuanfeng howled in despair: “Ye Yuan, you ... you’re despicable!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Compared to you all, my this bit of so-called despicable is really child’s play! Alright, today’s farce is over. Everybody, all scatter!”

Just as the Wang Family’s people said, even if Wang Xuanfeng did not take part in the planning, he was an insider at the very least.

He could completely stop Wang Su, but he did not.

This kind of utterly devoid of conscience person, Ye Yuan did not plan on letting him go at all.

Finally, the Wang Family’s people directly hauled Wang Xuanfeng away. When they left, they even did not forget to bring along Wang Su’s corpse.

As for how to deal with Wang Xuanfeng in the end, that was the Wang Family’s business.

Presumably, he did not have any good ending too.

It was night, a series of heart-wrenching cries came from the Wang Family’s manor, lasting a whole night before ceasing.

The second day, quite a number of people circled around the Wang Family’s manor curiously but discovered that the Wang Family’s front door was wide open, inside long devoid of people already.

The bold ones entered to take a look and directly vomited out stomach acid.

Wang Xuanfeng’s death state need not be said, even Wang Su, this dead person, was also rendered without a human form.

The Wang Family’s members’ wrath could be imagined.

But what made people surprised was that the Wang Family seemed to have disappeared into thin air, thoroughly vanishing from Jewelhill City.

...

“Ye Yuan, you were too reckless! You killed Wang Su, buried Wang Xuanfeng alive. Brightraise City’s Wang Family definitely won’t let this matter go! I heard that Wang Song isn’t to be trifled with!” Yang Rui said to Ye Yuan in earnest.

But Ye Yuan said without a care, “The grudge is long sowed already! You saw it too. Even if I don’t kill him, he won’t let me go either. This kind of person will never know to be grateful!”

Yang Rui sighed and said, “Makes sense! But this time, the Wang Family is considered to have thoroughly stumbled! Really didn’t expect that they actually had such courage, mobilizing the entire clan. It’s just, I can’t figure it out, the Wang Family’s formidable people are all dead. Who presided over this exodus, leaving the city? One has to know that they did not even startle the City Lord Manor!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, it’s probably that fat woman!”

Yang Rui said in surprise, “Wang Pianran? How is that possible?”

“Huhu, people will grow up! That woman isn’t stupid. In the past, there were Wang Yuxiang and Wang Lingbo protecting her. She could act arbitrarily and recklessly. But yesterday, outside the Myriad Treasure Tower’s door, I noticed that the expression in her eyes changed!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.
