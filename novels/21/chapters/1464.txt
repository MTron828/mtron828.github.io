Chapter 1468 Cutting off the Path of Retrea

“Heh, your strength is indeed not bad; it’s not to the extent of making me too bored! Now, I can send you all on your way.”

Ye Yuan’s voice sounded out faintly, sounding the funeral bell of this hundred-man team.

Only to see Ye Yuan’s figure become a blur. They actually could not sense Ye Yuan’s traces!

Too fast!

Ye Yuan who broke through to middle-stage Heaven Glimpse, his strength immediately soared by a great margin.

Those fiend race soldiers originally still could contend a little, but now, they were completely too weak to stand up to a single blow.

The centurion had a horrified look. How could he still care about his subordinates? His figure moved, speeding into the distance.

“Heh, can you escape?”

Ye Yuan laughed coldly, his figure turning into a wisp of light smoke. That centurion did not even emit a scream and was directly annihilated. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The others ran helter-skelter, but Ye Yuan would not give them the chance at all, sword drawing like the wind, wiping out this hundred-man team clean very soon.

Right then, a flying boat slowly approached.

On the flying boat, someone just happened to see the scene of Ye Yuan massacring the hundred-man team and shouted loudly, “What are you doing?! Human, you’re courting death!”

The arrival’s aura was very powerful. He was actually an Origin Deity Realm fiend race powerhouses; he was likely a high-ranking military officer.

Ye Yuan looked at the other party from afar. Suddenly, a hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of his mouth and he said, “The ones courting death ... are you all!”

Then, under everyone on the fly boat’s dumbfounded gazes, Ye Yuan suddenly took a step forward.

Ye Yuan was already standing on the edge of the cliff at this time. Another step forward and he would fall into the natural chasm.

“What is he doing? Does he know that he can’t escape and is going to kill himself?”

“This human isn’t a fool, right? To actually want to jump off the cliff to commit suicide!”

“Goodness me, my heart is somewhat thumping from watching! Fell down! Fell down!”

...

However, the reality was not like they imagined.

Ye Yuan, his step was taken very solidly, akin to flat ground!

Just like this, Ye Yuan stepped on the air and came.

All of the fiend race warriors had their eyeballs pop out, looking at this scene in disbelief.

This person could actually step on the air and fly?

You have got to be kidding!

Under such a terrifying gravitational field, there was actually someone capable of flying in the air!

“Not good! What ... What does he want to do?”

That Origin Deity Realm military officer suddenly startled awake. He discovered that right now did not seem to be the time to be shocked.

Ye Yuan stepped on the air and came, what on earth was he going to do?

“Kill him! Don’t let him approach the flying boat! Mustn’t let him draw close to the flying boat!

The Origin Deity Realm military officer’s voice revealed exhaustion from shouting at the top of his voice and fear!

He used all of his strength and struck a palm towards Ye Yuan through the air.

The palm of an Origin Deity Realm, the power was naturally incomparably terrifying.

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly plummeted but directly avoided this palm.

“Where is he? Where did he go?”

“Could it be ... fell to death?”

“Hahaha ... Lord Li Kong is mighty! That brat still wanted to play tricks. Now, see how he plays!”

Creak.

The voice had yet to fade when an intent tremor occurred on the flying boat and it actually tilted a little. All of the fiends staggered as if struck.

“Wh-What happened? Why did the flying boat slant?”

“Damn it! It’s that human punk! He ... He wants to turn the flying boat over!”

“Impossible! This flying boat was forged with Dark Gold Heavy Metal. Even an Origin Deity Realm powerhouse can’t push it. How can he, a Heaven Glimpse Realm martial artist, possibly turn it over?”

“H-Help! I ... I don’t want to die yet!”

...

On the flying boat were screams of despair everywhere.

To these fiend race soldiers, right now was simply the end of the world.

On the flank, a place where the group of fiend soldiers could not see, rays of golden light flooded on Ye Yuan’s body. At the same time, a forcefield poured out in torrents.

This heavy flying boat actually slanted a little again.

“HAH!”

Ye Yuan gave a huge shout, using all of his strength to push. The flying boat was directly pushed to a 90-degree angle.

“Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!”

Tragic screams came over one after another. Each and every one of the fiend soldiers started screaming frantically.

The moment the flying boat tilted, that horrifying gravitational field directly pulled those fiend soldiers, falling into the 100 thousand foot deep abyss.

No matter how they screamed, it was of no avail.

Even that Origin Deity Realm officer also fell into the abyss swiftly, disappearing very quickly.

Ye Yuan stood on the flying boat, looking at this scene coldly.

Above this natural chasm, Ye Yuan was like a fish that entered the water, while these fiend soldiers were like a bunch of land ducks that had never been in the water.

No matter how high your realm, how formidable your strength, there was only being drowned to death.

Ye Yuan waited patiently for a while. Sure enough, another flying boat came over again.

The two banks were extremely far apart. With the visual prowess of Deity Realm powerhouses, they could not see the situation on the opposite bank too.

This flying boat’s product was very crude. It could only be sent over one-way, then launch the array formation to return, the mobility exceedingly poor.

As long as it was intercepted in midair, it could only be a lamb awaiting slaughter.

This kind of flying boats’ usage was extremely narrow and limited. Without this kind of powerful gravitational field, it had no place to display its ability at all.

Furthermore, the fiend race was anxious to throw it into the battlefield and did not have time to develop meticulously at all too.

Hence, it benefited Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan waited by a tree stump for a hare to dash itself against it on this side of the shore. Half a day’s time, he flipped over a total of five flying boats.

Among this, just the Origin Deity Realm experts were as many as three.

Once they got on the flying boat, they were simply lambs awaiting slaughter; without the slightest strength to retaliate at all.

Once the flying boat was tilted, the horrifying gravitational field would immediately pull them into the abyss!

...

Xiu Lie’s face was incredibly grim, his entire person appearing restless and uneasy.

“What the hell are they doing? Why haven’t the people at the back arrived yet?!” in the dense forest, Xiu Lie roared.

Ahead was Tiderain City’s northern city gates. They had been lying in wait in the dense forest all this while, awaiting an opportunity to attack the city.

Except, just as they expected, Tiderain City had indeed strengthened the northern city’s defenses.

At this time, a soldier rushed over at top speed, knelt in front of Xiu Lie, and said, “Your Excellency, Centurion Tong Huai and his hundred-man team had already gone missing. This subordinate waited for very long at the edge of the cliff, but not one flying boat came over!”

“What did you say?!” Xiu Lie’s expression changed drastically as he yelled coldly.

Not just Xiu Lie, the faces of those generals by his side were all white as a sheet.

This news was simply a bolt out of the blue to them.

Without the flying boats, they were equivalent to an isolated force.

Although they could circle around from inside the forest, this dense forest was not suitable for their large-scale army to advance at all.

There were many powerful fierce beasts inside the dense forest. Once they startled the beast herds and set off a beast tide, none of them could escape.

Therefore, the region Ling Feng they all patrolled could occasionally run into small-scale fiend race squads. But large-scale marching could not be done at all.

“Those two spies are already dead, could it be that there are still human powerhouses lying in ambush nearby? Impossible! Over a 50-mile radius has been searched through, there aren’t others at all! Who the hell did it? Even if Tong Huai they all ran into an Origin Deity powerhouse, it’s also impossible for not a single person to escape, right?”

Xiu Lie racked his brains, but he could not figure out what was going on no matter what.
