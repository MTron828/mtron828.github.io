Chapter 2487: Heaven-defying Luck!

In the gray fog, on many narrow, winding trails, hundreds of Deva powerhouses had all already entered the Heavenspan Mountain.

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was clearly not unfamiliar with this place and said, “These narrow, winding paths all lead above one million miles. Each small path, you’ll encounter all sorts of different lucky chances. But further up, these small paths will merge randomly, and eventually lead to nine exits. At that time, you all will encounter other martial artists. The killing will also kick off at that time!”

The breathing of the numerous powerhouses also became quicker.

Stepping onto this path, they would be opponents!

In order to become a Dao Ancestor, the final fight would be extremely tragic.

There were no friends on the path of becoming a Dao Ancestor.

Everything was all for the sake of obtaining the rule crystals.

“Now, you guys each choose a path and set off!” Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets said.

The moment his voice faded, the six to seven hundred powerhouses rushed away one after another.

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets, Sacred Ancestor High Priest, as well as Pang Zhen, Wan Zhen, and the rest, and said, “Are you all with me, or setting off by yourselves?”

Heavenly Dao Samsara, there would be all kinds of lucky chances on this road, just like the Tear of Life.

Previously, the Tear of Life had never appeared. But under Heavenly Dao Samsara, it would definitely appear.

Hence, that was why Ye Yuan would come to the Heavenspan Mountain.

“Your Excellency, we want to try it ourselves!” Pang Zhen and Wan Zhen said in unison.

Ye Yuan smiled and nodded his head and said, “Go on!”

The two were overjoyed and also each chose a small path.

As for Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets and Sacred Ancestor High Priest, their strength was even stronger. They naturally had to personally tackle the Heavenspan Mountain.

To them, following Ye Yuan could naturally ensure their safety.

But it was impossible for Ye Yuan to always be by their sides protecting them.

At times, people had to face things themselves.

Furthermore, walking together with Ye Yuan was equivalent to that they would not be able to encounter lucky chances belonging to themselves.

After everyone left, Ye Yuan brought Treasure Pig and also set foot on a narrow, winding trail.

Ye Yuan walked very carefully, looking very meticulously, not willing to miss a single detail.

Ye Yuan had never seen the Tear of Life before. The people around him also had not seen it before.

Only the nine great Dao Ancestors had seen the Tear of Life before.

Therefore, Ye Yuan would rather be slower than to miss it.

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

All of a sudden, one gray shadow after another dashed out of the fog, heading straight for Ye Yuan.

Each of these gray shadows was extremely powerful; comparable to Deva Fourth and Fifth Blight powerhouses!

When there was an opportunity, there would naturally be danger.

On this Heavenspan Mountain, apart from the ever-present blue lightning, there were also other lurking dangers.

For example, these gray spirits.

Their names were called gray spirits, a creature unique to the Heavenspan Mountain during the Heavenly Dao Samsara period.

These gray spirits were extremely powerful, the weakest was also Deva First or Second Blight.

To powerhouses who entered the Heavenspan Mountain, it was naturally incredibly dangerous.

But currently, the strengths of these gray spirits that dashed out were far from just Deva First and Second Blight.

Among them, the weakest was Deva Fourth Blight too!

Furthermore, it was a large group!

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “I’ve just started, how come I encountered so many gray spirits? Seems like … something isn’t quite right!”

“Roar!”

Right at this time, the Treasure Pig in Ye Yuan’s arms suddenly gave an angry roar.

The gray spirits that were originally trying to attack Ye Yuan actually trembled all over in the air, suddenly stopping.

Treasure Pig directly flew out of Ye Yuan’s embrace with a?whoosh.

Then he swallowed a gray spirit in one mouthful.

Each and every one of those gray spirits trembled heavily, fleeing frantically into the gray fog.

Treasure Pig had clearly discovered the deliciousness. So how could he be willing to let them go?

It was only to see him?whoosh?again, burrowing into the mist.

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not suppress his laughter.

This Treasure Pig was really becoming more and more gluttonous.

Ye Yuan could feel that although these gray spirits had intelligence. They were extremely pure energy bodies.

They were absolutely great tonics to Treasure Pig.

And Treasure Pig’s strength was extremely terrifying, it was virtually equivalent to two great Dao Ancestors joining forces.

There were really not many existences capable of harming him in this fog.

Therefore, he was also very at ease.

“Roar!”

“Roar!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Roar!”

In the mist, Treasure Pig’s angry roar came from time to time, from varying distances and different directions.

Clearly, he was hunting down those gray spirits crazily.

No idea how long had passed either. The roars in the fog became thinner and thinner.

Suddenly, a pink shadow rushed into Ye Yuan’s arms.

He was still holding a white sphere in his mouth.

“Eurrp!”

Treasure Pig burped contentedly and the white ball also dropped in Ye Yuan’s palm.

Then he went to sleep on his own.

Clearly, he ate until he was very full.

But Ye Yuan’s eyelids twitched wildly!

“This thing … it wouldn’t be such a coincidence, right?” Ye Yuan looked at the white ball in his hand and could not help smiling bitterly as he said.

An extremely strong water-attribute rule was emitting off of the white ball.

That was right, it was precisely the power of rule!

This power of rule surged like the bright moon in the dark night, unable to hide at all.

Even if Ye Yuan was a fool, he also guessed what this was.

Rule crystal!

Ye Yuan did not expect that he just went out of the gates and already encountered the rule crystal that everyone yearned after even in their dreams!

Judging from the power of rule coming from the rule crystal, it should be the water source crystal.

He looked at the water source crystal in his hand and could not help being speechless.

Intentionally planting flowers but not blooming. Unintentionally planting a willow tree and the willow tree became a shade.

He was originally not inclined to the position of Dao Ancestor, but he encountered the rule crystal right after he left the house.

How could one make sense of this sort of thing?

The rule crystal could appear in any corner of the Heavenspan Mountain.

But encountering it at this location was extremely rare.

Even the Dao Ancestor Light back then also only encountered it above 10,000 miles.

But Ye Yuan just stepped out of the house, being less than a mile out!

This luck was simply heaven-defying!

Treasure Pig was also impressive. Entering the gray fog and wandering around leisurely, he returned with a rule crystal in his mouth.

Ye Yuan could not help feeling helpless. He looked at Treasure Pig and said, “You this fellow, if you brought me a Tear of Life back, how great would that be?”

Treasure Pig seemed to have felt something in his heart and opened his sleepy eyes and gave Ye Yuan a disdainful look.

Posturing was not done like how you’re doing it!

Treasure Pig was not stupid. On the contrary, he was extremely intelligent.

How great the value of a rule crystal was, he naturally knew.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly. Who could understand his pain?

However, he was not pretentious either. After all, it was a seat of Dao Ancestor. Since he acquired it, it was naturally impossible to throw it away.

He put the water source crystal away. But no matter what he did, he was not able to suppress the water source crystal’s power of rule.

When he carried this thing on him, it was like carrying a lighthouse.

On the lighthouse, there was even a sign stating it’s here!

Ye Yuan could not help being speechless again and grumbled, “No wonder in the last struggle for Dao Ancestor, of the few remaining human race powerhouses, another large group died. How is this thing some rule crystal? It’s simply a death-hastening crystal!”

No matter who it was, having obtained this thing, they were bound to suffer the besiegement of everyone.

The allure of the position of Dao Ancestor was seriously too strong, nobody could resist it!

Therefore, this was simply a death-hastening talisman!
