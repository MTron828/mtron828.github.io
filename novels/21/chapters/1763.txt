Chapter 1767 Powerful Opponen

“Congratulations, Master! After eight million years, someone finally cleared ‘Ask Not’ again! Wonder what kind of talent this little junior brother of ours has!”

In front of Sacred Ancestor High Priest, a middle-aged in blue appeared very respectful.

But his face had a look of joy.

Clearing ‘Ask Not’, this was a great joyous matter in the Demon Divine Region.

Because anyone knew that clearing ‘Ask Not’, the Sacred Ancestor High Priest would take them in as a disciple!

This was absolutely a great event in the demon race’s alchemy world!

The Sacred Ancestor High Priest slowly opened his mouth and said, “You haven’t publicized this matter, right?”

The middle-aged man in blue froze. Master’s attitude seemed to be somewhat off!

“No. When Ji Mo got this new, I came to report to master straight away and haven’t had time to tell the others yet.”

Wing said coolly, “This matter, don’t publicize it anymore. Just take it as if nothing happened.”

Ji Mo could not help being taken aback when he heard it and said in surprise, “Master, why ... why is this?”

Wing smiled and said, “He’s different from you all!”

Ji Mo froze when he heard that and said with uncertainty, “Different?”

He could not figure out, didn’t they all clear ‘Ask Not’? What was different?

Master selected disciples with ‘Ask Not’ as the standard, attempting to be able to groom an existence that surpassed the Medicine Ancestor one day. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This matter, the entire Demon Divine Region knew about it.

Now, there was another such genius, but Master did not seem to plan on taking him in as a disciple.

This made him very puzzled.

Wing slowly got up, walked to a chessboard in the corner, and said coolly, “Ji Mo, you all think that I cut out and simplified this ‘Ask Not’ chess game in order to find a talented person. Then have you all thought before whether I found him or not?”

Ji Mo was caught off-guard by this sudden question.

Suddenly, his expression changed drastically and he said, “Master’s meaning is that ... actually us 11 fellow apprentices aren’t ... aren’t considered to have passed your test at all?”

Wing slowly turned around and looked at Ji Mo as he smiled and said, “The 11 of you are indeed my demon race’s Alchemy Dao geniuses that are hard to come by in a million years. It’s just a pity that with your talents, it’s very hard to surpass Master!”

Ji Mo was incredibly shocked in his heart. His understanding in these few million years was suddenly subverted.

The 11 of them fellow apprentices had always viewed Master as their goal.

But, over 50 million years passed, even Eldest Senior Brother was also unable to reach Master’s height!

Just as Master said, for them fellow apprentices to want to surpass Master, it was virtually impossible.

This was not something willing or not, but can or cannot!

Could not even surpass Master, let alone talk about surpassing the Medicine Ancestor who towered above all life.

“Master, your meaning is that ... he can surpass you?” Ji Mo said with his eyes full of shock.

Wing smiled and said, “Can surpass or not, I don’t know. After all, who can say for sure what will happen in the future? But, at least up to this point, he’s stronger than you all!”

This time, Ji Mo was not shock.

His gaze was full of unwillingness to submit.

One had to know, the 11 of them fellow apprentices, each of them was someone who had the ability to rule the world.

After all, in 50 million years, only 11 of them emerged.

But hearing Master’s tone, they were completely not worth mentioning in front of this kid.

The pride of a genius made him very unconvinced in his heart.

“Master, just where is he strong?” Ji Mo asked.

Wing gave him a glance and said smilingly, “I know that you’re unconvinced in your heart, but he did what all of you couldn’t accomplish!”

Ji Mo’s face changed and he said, “Could it be that he shouldered all of your will?”

Wing laughed in spite of himself when he heard that and shook his head as he said, “All of my will? That isn’t my true test for you all! Among the 11 people, your talent is the highest, shouldering 90% of this seat’s will, completing ‘Ask Not’! But even all of it isn’t what I desire too! My true intention is ... shattering my will and replacing it!”

“Shattering Master’s will? In ... In this world, apart from the Medicine Ancestor, how can someone possibly do it?”

Ji Mo’s expression suddenly changed. The words that Master said made him very perplexed!

His master was the demon race’s strongest alchemist, not one of.

Being able to shatter his Alchemy Dao will, what kind of heaven-defying thing was that?

Apart from the Medicine Ancestor in his youth, who could still accomplish it in this world?

Who knew that Wing just said coolly, “If he can’t even crush my will, what qualifications does he have to go and challenge the Medicine Ancestor? Since the Heavenspan World’s ancient times, only a Medicine Ancestor emerged to this date. I can surmount all of the human race’s alchemists, but can’t surpass the Medicine Ancestor!”

Titanic waves surged in Ji Mo’s heart!

Honestly speaking, he had never thought about this before.

In fact, the more he cultivated, the more he felt that Master was too lofty beyond reach.

But Master being inferior to the Medicine Ancestor was an incontestable fact.

Then just how horrifying was the Medicine Ancestor’s strength?

Could it be that in this world, there was actually really someone capable of shattering Master’s will?

“Then Master’s meaning is that ... he did it?” Ji Mo drew a deep breath and said.

Wing’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said with a smile, “Not only did he do it, he even defeated the Medicine Ancestor! Even though that Medicine Ancestor isn’t worth mentioning at all, in regards to his realm, he’s an undefeatable existence! However, he won!”

Wing ignored the great shock in Ji Mo’s heart and continued, “What I’m looking for has never been some disciple, but ... a powerful opponent who can stand on par with me! Powerhouses look down upon the world, but who would know that the more one reaches my level of realm, the more fuzzier it actually is! Why did the Medicine Ancestor say ‘Ask Not’ two words to me? Because those two words are the true gap between me and him! If I can see clearly this ‘Ask Not’ two words, I might be able to be his match! It’s just that talk is cheap, but doing it is even harder than ascending to the heavens.”

Speaking up to here, Wing’s two eyes revealed rays of brilliance, and was boundlessly heroic for a moment!

“Invincibility is the loneliest! I think that the Medicine Ancestor’s thoughts are the same as me, right? Therefore, I need a powerful opponent! Only a powerful opponent can let me improve further! Understand?”

Ji Mo was completely unable to use words to describe his emotions. This place was too crazy!

The world was envious of the 11 of them. But who could have thought that the 11 of them were merely Master’s abandoned pieces!

They only barely managed to have the qualifications to be Master’s disciples.

But what Master needed was an opponent!

Ji Mo was shocked for a long time. Finally, it turned into a bitter smile and said, “Master, then have you never thought before, what if ... you lose?”

Wing smiled, smiled very brightly, and said, “This seat won’t lose!”

Ji Mo looked at Wing with great surprise, feeling that this master before his eyes was totally different from the one he knew.

The master in the past, that was an existence high above the clouds.

Nothing could move him.

But now, he was like a hot-blooded young man, bursting with youthful vigor anew.

Master’s spirit was burning!
