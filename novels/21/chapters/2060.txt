Chapter 2064: Glory to Live in Heavenly Eagle!

This young man in front of him was the fellow who killed his precious daughter and slaughtered thousands of his subordinates.

Now, he actually had to show such solemn respects to the other party. He had no way to describe how uncomfortable this was.

But he also understood that with Ye Yuan’s present status in the Southern Border, even if ten Lu Yans added up, he would also be inferior.

If not being backed by a heavenly emperor, Ye Yuan could plow Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital ten times over by randomly calling a few Empyreans.

Think about what kind of people Ye Yuan was associating with now?

Empyrean Flutterfeather, Empyrean Chaoyuan, and it was said that there were also the seven great reclusive alchemy ancient families’ super powerhouses.

Any one of these people was not an existence that he could provoke.

Although the present Ye Yuan was still True God Realm, he already made him unable to look up to him.

“Empyrean Lu Yan coming to find this Ye, it really surprises me greatly!” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Lu Yan had an awkward look as he said, “This ... The matters in the past was all this Lu who had eyes but couldn’t discern Grandmaster Ye’s true face, resulting in affronting Grandmaster. I hope that Grandmaster Ye is magnanimous and don’t haggle over it with us.”

Being under people’s roof, there was no choice but to lower one’s head.

At this time, how could an Empyrean’s face still be wanted?

Moreover, even the Southern Border Alliance’s big shots all lowered their heads and admitted their fault to Ye Yuan. What’s wrong with him, a mere Second Firmament Empyrean, lowering his head?

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “If apologies have any use, then what do we still cultivate for? Lu Yan, back then, you commanded an army of 100 thousand martial artists and several thousand True God powerhouses. If this Ye’s strength was lacking, this Heavenly Eagle would likely have not even dogs or fowls left anymore. You want to let matters go with this one light and fleeting sentence? Moreover, these few years, you all drove out the Myriad Treasure Tower. It’s clearly remnant hatred that’s outstanding. Why do you all feel that ... this Ye should help you guys?”

Ye Yuan was not a narrow-minded person. However, the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital had an appearance of showing disdain on everyone and everything starting with Lu Ziyi, deciding people’s life and death at the drop of a hat, making him extremely unhappy.

Later, Lu Yan even dispatched an army of 100 thousand, claiming that he was going to slaughter the city.

If not for Ye Yuan killing several thousand True Gods with ruthless means, how could there still be any Heavenly Eagle Imperial City currently?

Lu Yan three people had awkward faces. At that time, both parties were akin to fire and water. Even now, they still had a blood feud.

It was just that circumstances were stronger than people. Lu Yan three people had to implore Ye Yuan and had no choice but to lower their heads!

“What Grandmaster Ye says is true. Back then, our hearts were blinded. That’s why we’d be like that. In order to express our apology, we brought some gifts over. We hope that Grandmaster Ye will kindly accept them,” Lu Yan said.

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself when he heard this. He then said, “Lu Yan, it’s not that this Ye is looking down on you, but can your Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital take out something that moves this Ye?”

When the three people heard that, they could not help choking.

That was true. With Heavenly Eagle’s present power and influence, they would be controlling 10% of the Southern Border’s medicinal pills market very soon. How astonishing was this wealth?

A mere Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital, even if these three great Empyreans took out all of their assets, Ye Yuan would completely turn his nose up at it too!

The three people exchanged glances and were like eggplants hit by frost; actually at a loss on what to do for a moment.

Although they were of noble Empyrean bodies, it was too insignificant in front of the present Ye Yuan!

Just as the three people lost all hope, Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up, “You all coming to find me, it’s simply to get the Myriad Treasure Tower to rejoin the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital. I’ll give you all a chance, but whether you do it or not is up to you guys.”

The moment the three people heard, they could not help being overjoyed.

But very soon, Lu Yan’s face fell again.

He knew that the thing Ye Yuan was making them do definitely would not be that easy.

“Brother Lu Yan, what are you still in a daze for? Grandmaster Ye already said to give us a chance!’ Deng Yunzai urged.

He already could not endure the present days anymore, the Deng Family had already run out of resources for as long as several years.

If there were still no medicinal pills provided, all of their Deng Family members’ cultivation would probably get delayed.

So the moment he heard Ye Yuan’s words, Deng Yunzai agreed without thinking.

Lu Yan’s face changed several times. Ye Yuan did not urge either, just quietly waiting for a response.

Suddenly, Lu Yan’s face turned intent, seemingly making up his mind, and said in a solemn voice, “Whatever orders Grandmaster Ye has, this Lu will definitely do it!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Good, I want the three of you to extend a formal apology in front of everyone in the city! Also, swear a solemn oath in front of everybody to never invade Heavenly Eagle in this lifetime. Don’t use this sort of expression to look at me. It’s not this Ye intentionally making things difficult for you all, but that you owe them an apology!”

When the three people heard that, their faces changed rapidly.

Inside this tiny little City Lord Manor, the three of them lowering their heads to Ye Yuan. Although this was humiliating, it was actually nothing much.

With Ye Yuan’s present identity and status, he could bear their apology.

But, making them apologize to those ants with their Empyrean bodies, that was another matter altogether.

With this apology, it would be known to millions. Where would their old faces go in the future?

Reaching their level of realm, forfeiting their integrity was minor, losing face was huge! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Looking at the three people whose faces were flickering intermittently, Ye Yuan slowly stood up and left with his hands behind his back.

“You all have three days’ time to consider. After three days, if you haven’t replied, you all can leave on your own.”

Beside the three people’s ears came Ye Yuan’s drawn-out voice.

...

Five days later, at Heavenly Eagle’s Pill Tower square, countless martial artists and alchemists were gathered here.

Among the people present, some people had been through that earth-shaking great battle. There were also people that joined Heavenly Eagle afterward and knew absolutely nothing about this.

But very soon, they learned the whole story of that earth-shaking great battle from other people’s mouths and was immediately shocked speechless.

Only then did they know that Grandmaster Ye still had such a brilliant battle record!

Annihilating several thousand True Gods with his power alone, creating three great Empyreans with alchemy, six great Empyreans coming to help out from all over the land, forcing a heavenly emperor to give in.

This kind of battle record was truly fascinating.

But they also learned at the same time why the martial artists in the city loved and respected Grandmaster Ye so much.

Grandmaster Ye became furious to the extreme not for his lover, but it was merely for a nameless kid called Jiang Ming.

This kind of benevolent master, was he not worthy of following?

Of course, many people present were very disdainful.

“Tsk, what does this count as? Presently, Grandmaster Ye defeated the Southern Border with his power alone; that is a truly heaven-shocking battle!”

“Hahaha! Reasonable, reasonable!”

Everyone burst into laughter.

“But today, Grandmaster Ye still made three great Empyreans apologize to the whole city for our sakes!” The eyes of the martial artists that had experienced that battle brimmed over with hot tears.

“Recalling back then, it was really like a dream. At that time, these three great Empyreans were gods in the sky in our eyes, crushing until all of us could not catch our breath. But now, a word from Grandmaster Ye can make them bow their heads in submission! It’s glorious to live in Heavenly Eagle!”

Unknowingly, the horizons of Heavenly Eagle’s martial artists also broadened significantly.

The originally incomparably mysterious Empyreans in their eyes already became normal.

They all understood that it was not that they got strong, but that Grandmaster Ye became powerful!

This one sentence stirred up the sense of identity of all the martial artists. Everyone raised their hands and started shouting.

“Glory to live in Heavenly Eagle!”

“Glory to live in Heavenly Eagle!”

“Glory to live in Heavenly Eagle!”

...

On this day, three great Empyreans apologized in public. The Southern Border was shocked.
