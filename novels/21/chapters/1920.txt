Chapter 1924: Silver Alchemy Celestial Alchemist

“Senior, I want to become an alchemy celestial alchemist and enter the Alchemy Battle Arena.”

The old man in front of Ye Yuan was the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s examiner.

For many years, the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion had a resounding reputation. Alchemy celestial alchemists, even the lowest grade copper alchemy celestial alchemist, their status outside were also much higher than ordinary alchemists.

This was because alchemists that came out of the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion had all been through fight after fight. Those that charged out, their strength far surpassed ordinary alchemists.

Hence, wanting to become an alchemy celestial alchemist naturally needed stringent checks.

It was not that you could enter the Alchemy Battle Arena because you could refine medicinal pills.

This old man in front of him was the examiner responsible for verifying the stand of alchemists.

The old man looked at Ye Yuan and waved his hand and said, “Lad, this place isn’t the place to play house, go away.”

He saw that Ye Yuan was too young and felt that it was simply impossible to pass the test, and he naturally felt rather impatient.

Ye Yuan’s age, possessing Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity strength, although it was rare, it also would not make people too astonished.

But wanting to become a Five-star Alchemy God at his age, was extremely rare. As for whether or not he could pass the assessment, it was even more impossible.

Even though this test was not some very profound thing, it was also not what everyone could pass.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior won’t test my strength?”

The old man said, “This old man has been in charge of this Alchemy Celestial Pavilion for many years and has seen before no idea how many alchemists. Whether or not you can pass the test, I’ll know at a glance.”

This old man was an experienced Five-star Alchemy God himself, so his Alchemy Dao strength not weak.

With Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s popularity, there were too many alchemists who wanted to enter the Alchemy Battle Arena. The alchemists that he had seen before were indeed many.

As a result, he had long formed his own set of experiences already.

Ye Yuan did not dispute this either. He just smiled and said, “Then can Senior give Junior a chance, let Junior measure his own strength?”

“Brat, don’t waste our time, the alchemists that Elder Ping has seen before are more than the salt you’ve eaten. He already said that you’re out of the game, so there’s no chance for you.”

“Brat, your hair isn’t even fully grown yet. Do you know what’s called pill refinement?”

“Hahaha!”

Everyone burst out laughing, full of disdain for Ye Yuan.

Even if disciples from great alchemy families wanted to reach the strength to enter the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion, they at least had to be three to five thousand years old too.

At Ye Yuan’s age, it was simply impossible to have a chance.

Elder Ping saw that Ye Yuan’s attitude was sincere, not arrogant like members of aristocratic families. Stroking his beard, he nodded and said, “Forget it, give it a try!”

Ye Yuan was overjoyed and said with clasped hands, “Thank you very much, Elder Ping!”

Elder Ping waved his hand and said, “Don’t be in a hurry to thank me first. This divine fire is very wild, so don’t burn yourself.”

The assessment was very simple, control the flame to refine pills.

One should not look at how it was simple; many Five-star Alchemy Gods could not do it well.

This flame was not an ordinary divine flame, but a fire without a master. It was very wild.

Wanting to control it to refine pills had very high demands on the alchemist’s fire control.

A cluster of turquoise flame trembled endlessly inside the brazier.

“Heh, in a while, look at how embarrassed this brat becomes!”

“The Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire is notorious for being difficult to subdue. At his age, how can he possibly control an ownerless Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire?”

“This is called overestimating his own ability.”

...

Those people waiting for the test felt that Ye Yuan was wasting time, all appearing very annoyed.

Ye Yuan slowly came in front of the brazier and lightly pointed a finger out. Following that, that cluster of flame flew towards the medicinal cauldron extremely obediently.

The entire process was natural and smooth. It did not pause in the slightest at all.

The originally bored to death Elder Ping suddenly stood up from his seat, looking at Ye Yuan’s actions in shock.

Inside the hall, it was dead silent, only seeing Ye Yuan’s actions skipping erratically.

Following that, it was the pill refinement.

That Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire was extremely obedient in Ye Yuan’s hands, and it actually faintly emitted howling sounds of a wolf.

Inside the medicinal cauldron was a false pill, specifically used in alchemist assessments.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

...

Inside the medicinal cauldron, nine exploding sounds resounded in a row.

“Awoo!”

A wolf’s howl transmitted over. The Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire returned to the brazier once more, and actually somewhat had the intention of having not given full expression to its views.

Bang!

The Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire that returned to the brazier actually flew out once more under the situation where no one was manipulating it.

But it was blocked by the restriction power around the brazier.

Everyone looked at this scene dumbfoundedly with astounded faces.

“Nine booms, this probably already has the strength of a silver alchemy celestial alchemist, right?”

“Also, that fire controlling art is truly transcendent!

“The Cloudheart Heavenly Wolf Fire actually wants to burst out of the restriction, that means ... could it be that it wants to have Ye Yuan subdue it?”

...

Ye Yuan’s assessment was completed extremely quickly, merely several dozen breaths from start to end.

But in these several dozen breaths, it let people see his power.

Tempering the false pill, the number of detonating sounds given off was the assessment criteria.

As long as it could give off a detonating sound, it was considered passing the test.

But the detonating sounds only had at most nine, Ye Yuan actually made it emanate fully!

Under normal circumstances, being able to reach nine booms already had the level of silver alchemy celestial alchemists.

It was just that, people who came to take part in the alchemy celestial assessment rarely had people capable of doing it to this extent.

Unless it was those major powers who had already been famous for a long time and had never participated in the alchemy celestial assessment before, would there be such a performance?

But how old was Ye Yuan?

When these people were a thousand over years old, they were still bitterly training basic skills under the whip of their masters!

With this, it was truly astounding everyone with his skill!

“Elder Ping, I’m done with the assessment,” Ye Yuan came in front of Elder Ping and said coolly.

Elder Ping was startled, only then, coming back to his senses.

He looked at Ye Yuan and said with a bitter smile, “This old man apologizes to you. This old man didn’t expect that there would actually be a time where I would make an error of judgment.”

Everyone was incredibly shocked; Elder Ping actually apologized to this kid!

Elder Ping was a gold alchemy celestial alchemist, he actually apologized to a junior.

But thinking about it, they also felt at ease.

Ye Yuan had such strength when he was so young, so his future accomplishments were limitless!

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Elder Ping is too serious! I wonder if this junior is counted as having passed the assessment?”

“Of course you passed!”

As he spoke, Elder Ping fished out a silver-color token, passed it to Ye Yuan, and said, “Nine booms, your strength already reached the standard of silver alchemy celestial alchemist. From today onward, you’re a silver alchemy celestial alchemist!”

Ye Yuan received the token, feeling rather surprised. He did not expect that he actually directly advanced to silver alchemy celestial alchemist.

He found out earlier that alchemists who passed the alchemy celestial assessment were just gradeless alchemists.

They must go through a hundred, even hundreds of alchemy battles, before they could advance to copper alchemy celestial alchemist.

Similarly, for copper alchemy celestial alchemists to want to advance to the silver level, they also had to experience many alchemy battles. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This process tended to be several decades, several centuries, even several thousand or tens of thousands of years.

Ye Yuan only guided according to the laws inside the medicinal cauldron and did his best, but did not think that he actually directly advanced to silver grade.
