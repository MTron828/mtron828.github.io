Chapter 2127: The Moment to Witness a Miracle!

“This is not possible! You ... Just how did you do it?”

Inside the void, came Medicine Ancestor’s astonished voice.

And just as the Tai Ji diagram dissipated with a loud bang, the entire Ask Not world emitted a dazzling light, and it actually started gradually contracting.

That endless world transformed into one thick cyclone after another and started drawing in.

The phantoms of the two great sovereigns also gradually started dissipating.

“Hahaha ... the young ones are to be feared! The young ones are to be feared! After ten million years, there’s finally someone that can take part in our two people’s game of chess!” Although the Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s figure started dissipating, he laughed loudly without ceasing.

Finally, the entire world turned into an enormous chessboard, it was precisely Ask Not!

Except, a heaven-shocking transformation already happened to the chess game on the chessboard currently.

“This ... How is this possible?”

“A draw! It’s actually a draw!”

“This Empyrean has once researched the Ask Not chess game in detail before. No matter how hard one works, it will always be the outcome of defeat in the end. So how is this possible?”

“A miracle! This is the moment of a miracle! I’ve witnessed the birth of a miracle!”

... ...

The entire place was in shock. The outcome of this Ask Not chess game actually became a tie!

Those present were all major powers. So they naturally would not be unfamiliar with Ask Not.

This Ask Not chess game, the Medicine Ancestor who played white occupied a tremendous advantage. The Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s declining trend already could not be salvaged.

Saying that it was an eternal chess game, it was actually Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s defeat.

But now, the chess game on the chessboard was already totally different.

Black and white, two sides, each occupied half of the map.

Not a piece more and not a piece less.

The entire situation was extremely harmonious: there was you in me, me in you, and actually gave people a feeling of gladdening the heart and pleasing the eye.

Perfect!

This word sounded out in everyone’s hearts at the same time.

Ji Mo looked at that chess game blankly and was speechless for a long time.

Such a scene truly came too shockingly.

To talk about the understanding of Ask Not, who could compare to him?

Or perhaps, who could beat Sacred Ancestor High Priest?

Sacred Ancestor High Priest had devoted himself to studying it and was also unable to crack this eternal game.

Presently, in Ye Yuan’s hands, it actually transformed the rotten into the magical, reaching such a perfect and harmonious realm.

Ye Yuan perfectly outlined the Ask Not world with his own Dao, forming the present situation.

He was merely a Six-star Priest. So how did he do it?

“Hahahaha ... Eternal game! This is the true eternal game! Turns out that Ask Not’s final phase is actually like this!”

Above the void, Ji Mo laughed loudly without ceasing.

His mood had never been so free from inhibitions before.

Ask Not was the sore point of his master for tens of millions of years. Now, it was finally solved.

He knew that his master was definitely paying attention to this event. Right now, he must also be laughing heartily.

In this world, the most terrifying thing was not a powerful opponent, but the loneliness of an expert.

Now, his master finally found an Alchemy Dao sovereign that met his match. He must be very delighted and pleased.

“Zixu, did you find Second Sage’s game satisfactory to the eyes?” Ji Mo looked toward Heavenly Emperor Zixu and said with a smile that was not a smile.

The Qilin Clan’s powerhouses were long already dumbfounded.

Even if they did not understand alchemy, they also knew that Ye Yuan had accomplished a remarkable major thing.

This eternal game, Ask Not, the Qilin Clan also knew that this was the game between two great sovereigns.

This game was an eternal puzzle.

For tens of millions of years, no idea how many supreme powerhouses had attempted to solve this puzzle but failed to do so.

But now, it was solved by a measly little Six-star priest. How could they not be surprised?

It was solved!

Completely solved!

And not walked out of the chess game!

These two concepts were totally different.

For others, being able to protect themselves after entering the game and walking out of the puzzle safely was already a very impressive thing.

But Ye Yuan shattered the world that the two great sovereigns structured with a heaven-shocking will, and also refined the pill anew with Great Dao together with a great divine ability and the two people, building a perfect world.

This was a chess game and also a medicinal pill.

This kind of situation was simply fantastical.

Just based on this game, Ye Yuan’s name could go down in history! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

They had truly witnessed the moment of a miracle!

What was laughable was that they were still jeering and making cutting remarks before this, thinking that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

But now, they had their faces slapped blatantly.

Being questioned, Heavenly Emperor Zixu’s expression flickered incessantly, being very ugly.

Suddenly, Zixu clasped his hands and said to Ye Yuan, “The title of Second Sage lives up to reality as well as in name! Zixu has offended Second Sage previously, please pardon my offense!”

No matter how unwilling he was to admit it, the moment this game ended, no one could treat Ye Yuan as a junior any longer.

He was a powerhouse that could genuinely compete with the two great sovereigns!

Perhaps his current strength was still weak, but in the future, he had limitless possibilities!

This point, no one was able to refute it.

Maybe another Medicine Ancestor would really appear again in this world.

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Emperor Zixu and said coolly, “Now, do you still want to take the Qilin Emperor Bone?”

Zixu’s expression turned stiff and he said, “Not anymore! Second Sage, Lord Stardrive, Zixu takes his leave!”

After he was done talking, Zixu brought Shaoyun and the rest along, and they quietly withdrew.

They truly could not stay on in this place any longer. They also had no face to stay on.

Originally thought that Ye Yuan was just a junior, snatch then snatch.

But they discovered in the end that Ye Yuan was a future titan.

The actions previously simply became a joke.

“A miracle! Really miraculous!”

“I finally understand why Sacred Ancestor High Priest would confer him as Second Sage!”

“Seeing this game today, I can brag for 100 thousand years!”

... ...

There was a series of marveling in the city. They felt honored to have witnessed the moment of miracle.

And those Priest Temple’s Seven-star Priests had abashed looks on their faces.

Ye Yuan had once said to them that he was the opponent that Sacred Ancestor High Priest designated. At that time, they turned their noses up in contempt.

Now, they finally understood that what Ye Yuan said was not false!

Ye Yuan absolutely had the qualifications to become Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s opponent!

In front of Ye Yuan, Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s disciples appeared to be cast into the shade.

“Incredible! Truly too impressive! I ... I want to take him as my master!” In the city, Long Xiaohai waved his hands about agitatedly. His complexion was flushed red.

“Hehe, I’m afraid that Ye Yuan will find you too stupid! Hang on, if you acknowledge him as master, wouldn’t I become his junior? No way!” Long Xiaochun immediately denied it.

But Long Xiaohai ignored her and was still immersed in the midst of excitement.

He already completely became Ye Yuan’s fan, his ardent worshiper.

Long Zhi who was by the side was also speechless for a long time.

He also did not expect that this young man was actually so heaven-defying.

“Second Sage, this emperor also has to apologize to you. Prior to this, I also had many suspicions about Second Sage. Now, I’m wholeheartedly convinced!” Ji Mo bowed in salute and said to Ye Yuan.

This bow came from the bottom of his heart.

Even following by Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s side, Ji Mo also found it very hard to understand his master’s actions and profound meaning behind them.

But today, he witnessed Ye Yuan’s miracle and finally understood his master’s painstaking effort.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “My realm is too low. Causing people to give birth to underestimation is normal. As for apologizing, there’s no need. With High Priest Stardrive delivering Ask Not personally, this Ye is endlessly grateful.”
