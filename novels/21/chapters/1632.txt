Chapter 1636 Domineering Killing

Ning Tianping was first incomparably surprised, but seeing that large mountain on Ye Yuan’s hand, he was shocked until his jaws could not close.

What the hell was this?

Elder Ye carried a mountain over?

This scene seemed extremely comical. Ye Yuan’s body appeared extremely incongruous with the enormous mountain, yet, he was not crushed.

Quite a few people all saw this scene, including those fiends.

“Hahaha, is this kid here to make a joke? Carry a small hill here for what?”

“Is this here to scare us? Haha, I’m so scared!”

“What a large mountain! My goodness, I’m going to be crushed to death!”

...

To Origin Deity Realm martial artists, carrying a small hill of this scale was a very effortless thing.

Therefore, even though Ye Yuan’s state looked very comical, everyone did not feel anything strange.

If it were them, they could also hold it up easily.

This kind of small hill to smash people would not cause any harm at all. Hence, that was why they would mock Ye Yuan like this.

The fiend race already had victory within grasp and did not think that an Origin Deity Realm Ye Yuan could change anything. Even if he had first-layered heaven Divine Lord combat power, nothing would change.

Ning Tianping they all also did not feel so, and shouted at Ye Yuan, “Elder Ye, don’t care about us, quickly go!”

Ye Yuan flashed a smile at him. The latter was stunned for a while, then saw Ye Yuan lightly raise his arm, and pushed the enormous mountain.

Then, he saw that enormous mountain draw a beautiful arc, landing on Heavenstar’s head.

Heavenstar had long seen Ye Yuan, but he was very disdainful toward Ye Yuan. Seeing that Ye Yuan actually used the enormous mountain to come and smash him, he could not help sneering as he said, “A lousy mountain and you want to injure this seat? Do you really take this seat to be a piece of paper?”

Heavenstar fished out a large hammer, it was shockingly a high-level fiend lord mystic treasure.

Only to see him smile scornfully, brandish his hammer, a smashing over toward the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain.

At this time, the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain just happened to be falling. All of a sudden, a terrifying forcefield enveloped the entire battlefield.

The originally disdainful-looking Heavenstar suddenly changed his expression drastically, finally discovering the terror of this enormous mountain.

He instinctively wanted to run, but it was like his feet grew roots, unable to budge at all!

“ARGH!!”

A shrill yet despairing scream suddenly cut off.

The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain’s falling speed was too fast, fast until everyone could not react.

They did not even have time to blink their eyes and Heavenstar was gone.

“Puhwark!”

Fresh blood flew everywhere!

Di En and Ling Zikun who were not far away from him got blood splattered all over their faces.

Di En could not resist shuddering, looking at this scene in disbelief.

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned, the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain returned to his hand once more, and was held up lightly just like that.

This time, nobody could laugh anymore.

Everyone ceased fighting, looking at the Heavenstar who was smashed into a meat pancake in endless horror.

His fiend soul already dissipated with the wind, unable to even find a trace.

A fiend powerhouse said in shock, “N-No way, right? What is this thing, how ... how is it so strong?”

His face was very black, but at this time, it actually had signs of turning pale. Clearly, he was frightened badly.

To be able to quash a third-layered heaven Fiend Lord powerhouse at once, the power of this enormous mountain was too terrifying.

“O-Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! The precious treasure born this time is actually an Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! Q-Quickly run!”

Talking to the back, Di En’s voice changed pitched, clearly terrified to the extreme.

How could he still dare to stay, taking off and running!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t be in a hurry to leave, I’ll send you off!”

Done talking, he pushed the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain once more. The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain caught up to Di En with incredible speed.

Rumble!

A loud noise transmitted over, another third-layered heaven Fiend Lord powerhouses was gone.

Those fiend powerhouses were all overwhelmed by terror, wetting their pants in fear. How could they still dare to remain behind at this time? All of them unleashed every single bit of their strength, running away desperately.

They could only pray, pray that Ye Yuan would not set his eye on them.

Even Di En and Heavenstar, these two mighty powerhouses, were casually quashed. How could they get lucky?

“R-R-Run! Quickly run!”

“Quickly run! This human is a devil!”

“Everybody quickly run! Being smashed by this small hill and you’ll be dead!”

...

For some time, the fiend race’s powerhouses fled in all directions, scattering like birds and animals. How could they still care about slaughtering the human powerhouses.

The current Ye Yuan was a malefic star in their eyes.

The human powerhouses were all dumbfounded. They were shocked by this scene before their eyes until it could not be any greater.

They could not understand it no matter what. How did Ye Yuan become so strong all of a sudden, squashing two third-layered heaven Fiend Lord powerhouses with a few casual moves.

One had to know, Heavenstar and Di En were genuine ninth-layered heaven Fiend Lord powerhouses!

Actually, they misunderstood, this Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain only had such power inside this abyss.

This abyss was a natural magnetic field. As long as Ye Yuan controlled the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain and made it create an attractive force with this massive magnetic field, forget about fiend lords, even a fiend king would be squashed by him too!

This Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain’s density was very horrifying. If not for refining it, even Ka Suo, this kind of Celestial Deity powerhouse, could forget about budging it in the slightest.

Once this kind of thing crushed down, even divine lord mystic treasures would be crushed into dust too, let alone talk about a person.

However, Ye Yuan’s current strength could only refine a small portion, and could not unleash its full power at all.

If fully refined, quashing Celestial Deity powerhouses would be like playing.

Just as Song Yu they all said, the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain’s grade could not be determined at all. It might be even more formidable than xiantian celestial deity mystic treasures!

Ye Yuan’s figure moved, throwing the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain out once more

Rumble!

Rumble!

Rumble!

Ye Yuan tossed very casually, quashing one fiend race powerhouse after another.

He specifically picked those powerful fiend powerhouses to kill, hitting one target after another without missing his shot.

Those fiend powerhouses wailed miserably as if the end of the world had come, crying out in despair.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan’s tossing needed some time, it was also impossible to kill everyone. That was how quite a few fiends escaped.

Even so, in this short while, the fiends also lost over a dozen powerhouses. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Among them, there were quite a few powerhouses who were originally sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord and above.

With this, it was sufficient for Eminent Orchid Imperial City and Blood Yama Hall to suffer.

The human powerhouses were all dumbfounded, all incredibly shocked at the back.

“This is the precious treasure that was born this time? This power ... is insane!”

“This is also too fake, right? With this Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, wouldn’t one make a clean sweep after going out?”

“Yeah, whatever third-layered heaven Divine Lord, fifth-layered heaven Divine lord, whoever irks his eyes, he can simply throw that enormous mountain out and smash them accurately!”

...

Chasing away the fiend powerhouses, Ye Yuan put away the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain and found Ning Tianping.

Ning Tianping watched until his blood boiled at one side, saying in surprise, “Congratulations, Elder Ye! Obtaining this precious treasure, Elder Ye can do whatever you please in the future!”

Ye Yuan just smiled and suddenly discovered that Zheng Qi was not around, and could not help asking, “Where’s Head Elder?”

Upon mentioning Head Elder, Ning Tianping’s eyes turned red and recounted the matter that happened previously. Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed when he heard and said, “This Gao Yuan is a bag full of tricks, Head Elder is likely not his match. You all wait here! I’ll go find them!”
