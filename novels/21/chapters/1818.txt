1822 Upper Groove Cour

“You ... .What did you feed him just now?” Du Rufeng asked with a surprised look.

This Treasure Pig was notoriously difficult to serve.

During this period of time, he racked his brains and was also unable to satisfy Treasure Pig.

Just now, in order to refine pills, he even directly exploded the furnace upward, even blowing off the roof.

But who would have thought that a kid who popped out of no idea where casually fed a little something and made Treasure Pig satisfied to the max.

Ye Yuan was speechless as he said, “Of course it’s medicinal pills. Didn’t this snotty brat say just now that this piggy likes to eat medicinal pills? I just happened to have on hand some medicinal pills that I refined in the past and fed them to him conveniently.”

Hearing Little Tong’s words, Ye Yuan had some guesses in his heart.

This Treasure Pig might have smelled the smell of medicinal pills on his body, that was why he would tunneling into his bosom desperately.

With an attempt, it was indeed like so.

But Ye Yuan was very surprised, this Treasure Pig’s nose was really sharp enough.

Looking at its appearance, it did not smell the medicinal fragrance after seeing him but smelled it from a very far away place.

This little pink pig was very unusual!

“Humph! Don’t think that you’re off the hook by feeding Treasure Pig to its fill! Du ... Grandpa, kill him for me! This punk actually dared to hit my buttocks! Ouch!” Little Tong pointed at Ye Yuan and said furiously.

Du Rufeng’s face fell and he immediately exuded a murderous air.

Xu Yan’s face changed and he immediately felt a big headache.

Du Rufeng’s strength was far above his.

Furthermore, even if he was worse than him, with Du Rufeng’s identity, he did not dare to make a move either.

Ye Yuan this brat was really courting death!

When Zhu Wen saw this scene, he was excited until he was practically about to jump up.

But right at this time, Treasure Pig suddenly startled awake and broke free of Little Tong’s embrace with a whoosh, and blocked in front of Ye Yuan, showing its teeth at Du Rufeng. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Grunt! Grunt!”

This Treasure Pig was very human-like. Everyone could see that he was venting his dissatisfaction.

When Du Rufeng saw this scene, his originally imposing momentum immediately disappeared into thin air.

When Little Tong saw this scene, he said in a great rage, “You stupid pig, ungrateful and forgetting my kindness! Come over here for me!”

Treasure Pig shook its head and directly turned its head away, the appearance very arrogant.

Little Tong jumped up angrily and said, “Angering me to death! Angering me to death! If you have the capabilities, follow this brat in the future. Don’t come and find me anymore!”

It was just that he spoke in a childish voice and did not have any deterrence at all.

He originally thought that Treasure Pig would be scared. Who knew that Treasure Pig leaped and bored right into Ye Yuan’s bosom, and even shook its head at Little Tong like putting on a show of force, cute to the extreme.

The moment Little Tong saw, he said angrily, “You ungrateful fellow, we’re cut off!”

Done talking, Little Tong walked off acting like an elderly, with his hands behind his back.

Du Rufeng was frozen there. Looking at Treasure Pig and looking at Little Tong again, he had a difficult look on his face.

Suddenly, he saw Zhu Wen by the side. His expression turned somber and he said, “You’re the disciple in charge of the Shadowmoon Sect’s daily living?”

Zhu Wen hurriedly said, “Yes, it’s just that ...”

Zhu Wen did not know what Du Rufeng wanted and was just about to lodge a complaint when he was immediately interrupted by Du Rufeng, “Arrange for them to stay in Upper Groove Court. Whatever requests they have, satisfy them to the best of your ability, especially that kid! If Treasure Pig were to suffer any inconveniences in this period of time, I’ll hold you accountable!”

Zhu Wen’s expression was instantly ugly to the extreme.

Upper Groove Court was the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm’s top residence.

Putting aside the extravagant facilities, it was also the place where spiritual energy was the most abundant.

Even the rank one High Clarity Sect among the dozen over True God level sects also did not have the qualifications to be hosted in the Upper Groove Court.

Elder Du actually let the Shadowmoon Sect be hosted in Upper Groove Court for a pig.

On what basis?!

Forget that they were staying in Upper Groove Court, he even wanted him to handle all demands.

Zhu Wen wished to hit his head and die right now.

Except, Du Rufeng’s status, he was well aware.

At this very moment, he could only swallow the knocked-out teeth into his stomach.

“This disciple obeys!” Zhu Wen bowed and said.

Du Rufeng completely ignored Zhu Wen and immediately turned around to go chase after Little Tong.

Shadowmoon Sect’s people all used strange expressions to look at Zhu Wen.

Just now, this guy still wanted to use his position to get even with a personal grudge, putting them in the woodshed to humiliate them. Who knew that in a blink of an eye, the situation had a big reversal.

Jiang Xueyan came in front of Zhu Wen with an amused look as she opened her mouth and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Zhu, lead the way!”

Zhu Wen’s face became black as the bottom of the work and he said in a solemn voice, “What are you being smug for? A villain intoxication by success!”

Jiang Xueyan giggled and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother Zhu, you have to pay attention to your words. You scold us villains, Ye Yuan won’t be happy. If he’s not happy, Treasure Pig won’t be happy. If Treasure Pig isn’t happy ... you know the consequences!”

Seemingly affirming Jiang Xueyan’s words, Treasure Pig grunted twice in Ye Yuan’s bosom and fell asleep again.

Zhu Wen’s face changed, stifling back a breath, almost exploding.

The temple’s disciples had always been high and lofty in front of True God level sects.

But today, he had to compromise out of consideration for the general interest, truly aggrieving!

Forcefully enduring the humiliation, Zhu Wen sucked in a deep breath and said, “Follow me then!”

...

Upper Groove Court compared to the woodshed was really like heaven and earth.

This place was like a miniature palace, pavilions with flowing water, houses and courtyards, extremely ingenious.

Upon entering Upper Groove Court, a burst of thick spiritual energy hit head-on, making the few people perk up considerably instantly.

“There are a dozen over courtyards here. You all pick yourselves. If there’s anything, call me again.”

Finished talking, Zhu Wen was about to head outside.

This place, he did not wish to remain for a moment.

“Hang on!” Ye Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and said.

Zhu Wen’s face changed and he said in a solemn voice, “Anything else?”

“Mn?” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, revealing a displeased look.

Zhu Wen hated him in his heart immensely, but he could only soften his tone and say, “May I ask if Junior Apprentice Brother Ye has anything else?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s more like it! You wait for a moment, I’ll give you a list, you go and prepare a batch of rank five spirit medicines for me.”

The rank five spirit medicines in Ye Yuan’s hands were not many, it could not stand up to the consumption at all.

Bamboo Groove Divine Temple was the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s top faction. Mere rank five spirit medicines shouldn’t be a problem.

Such a good opportunity to practice now, if he did not take advantage of it, wouldn’t it be too regrettable?

However, Zhu Wen’s face could not help turning black when he heard it and was just thinking of flaring up when suddenly, his eyeballs swiveled and he said with a nod, “Okay, I’ll wait for you!”

Upper Groove Court was very big, the five people each picked a courtyard and Ye Yuan went to make a list.

Before long, Ye Yuan handed the list to Zhu Wen. The moment Zhu Wen took it and looked, his eyeballs almost popped out.

This kid was really demanding an exorbitant price!

On the list, several hundred types of rank five spirit medicines were listed.

Unless it was an elder level existence, otherwise, who had the authority to mobilize so many rank five spirit medicines?

Did he really think that a pig could let him act recklessly without fear of anybody in the Bamboo Groove Holy Realm?

One had to know, this place was the temple’s territory, the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s supreme ruler!

Leaving Upper Groove Court, Zhu Wen said with a cold laugh, “Heh, the status of Elder Chai who is in charge of the Spirit Medicines Hall isn’t beneath Elder Du! I want to see whether or not you can rely on a pig to bear his wrath!”
