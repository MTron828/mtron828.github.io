Chapter 2714: Big Yellow, Be Obedient!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bright Tiger King’s territory was long already in upheaval.

Currently, the other four half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens brought their armies and were currently locked in a struggle with Bright Tiger King.

Bright Tiger King fought one-against-four, and it could be seen that it was rather difficult.

However, his strength was indeed fearsome too. He actually managed to resist for some time.

While his subordinates also fought dauntlessly in bloody battles, killing until their eyes turned red.

“Are the four of you really going to fight to the death?” Bright Tiger King roared angrily.

“Humph!?You’ve cut off our hope and are still talking big here! Ye Yuan was only placed with you for a year and you’ve killed him. What’s the point of talking about it now?” Myriad Elephant King said in a solemn voice.

“The son that I’m most proud of has died too!”

“One son died, you still have nine! But Ye Yuan is dead, how will we break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven? Enough said! Your territory is going to disappear from the Myriad Demons Mountain today!” Heavenly Rat King cried out.

Bright Tiger said angrily, “Want me dead, the few of you have to pay the price in blood too!”

Both sides fought fiercely without resting, either you die or I perish.

The great battle of Three Saint Mountain touched the nerves of the five factions very quickly.

When Bright Tiger received the news from the front, he was immediately dumbfounded.

Three Saint Mountain was just a small faction. Going over with Ye Yuan’s strength, it was very easy to protect himself.

Who could have expected that more than ten Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses suddenly appeared there?

The true spirit army that Shuoyan brought over was completely wiped out, corpses scattered everywhere. The five parties all thought that Ye Yuan was already dead.

This was equivalent to saying that their hope of breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven had been completely cut off!

How could they not be angry when they got this news?

Myriad Elephant King they all naturally pinned this matter on Bright Tiger.

Bright Tiger completely did not know that those Jade Sovereign Heavens sent out to kill Ye Yuan and Shuoyan were actually his own nine sons!

Of course, Hefeng they all would not tell Bright Tiger too.

In reality, they all also did not expect that it would cause such grave consequences.

Currently, Hefeng nine people were fighting dauntlessly in bloody battles, killing extremely tragically.

The battle on both sides kept on escalating and becoming increasingly fiercer and already reached the extent of being irreconcilable till death.

Bright Tiger King’s combat power was top-notch among the five people, the strength of his subordinates was naturally the strongest among the five people too.

But, no matter how strong his strength was, it was also impossible to surpass the sum of the four.

If Myriad Elephant four people wanted to eradicate Bright Tiger’s faction, they naturally had to pay a heavy price.

If hope was not really cut off, they would not be so furious too.

Boom!

Suddenly, the earth quaked and mountains swayed.

The expressions of everyone on the battlefield changed one after another.

“Stop!” A thunderous voice entered everyone’s ears.

Everyone looked over following the voice and discovered a white-robed youth riding a large yellow bull, walking over leisurely.

In an instant, countless eyes focused on that white-robed youth.

The way that he took the stage was seriously too attention-grabbing!

As for Shuoyan who was behind Big Yellow, he was directly overlooked by everyone.

“Who is this white-robed youth? To actually be riding a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven old yellow ox, it’s too impressive!”

“It’s a human! I heard that the four kings and Bright Tiger King are fighting in a life-and-death struggle because of a human. It wouldn’t be him, right?”

“No way, right? Isn’t he dead?”

… …

A Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum riding on a grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven old yellow bull, this image was too impactful.

Grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven, what kind of proud existence was that?

Even in death, they would not be other people’s mount too!

Unless the other party was a Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse!

But, a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum actually did it!

“Ye Yuan! He actually didn’t die??Mn??That … That … How is this possible? How is this possible?” When Bright Tiger saw Ye Yuan, his eyes genuinely brimmed over with hot tears.

Ye Yuan appeared too timely. If it dragged on, he would have definitely died without a doubt!

But, when his gaze landed on the old yellow bull under Ye Yuan, his entire person was immediately petrified!

Those small fries naturally did not recognize the large yellow bull, but as an existence with half a foot into Saint Sovereign Heaven, how could he not recognize it?

“Bright Tiger, that wouldn’t be … be …” Wild Lion King said with his eyes full of shock.

“There’s no mistake. It’s him!” Bright Tiger said with absolute certainty.

He had seen General Big Yellow Bull in front of Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s seat when he entered the Saint Exalt’s territory!

It was also precisely because of this that Saint Exalt Bull Demon made Big Yellow Bull come over.

Although Big Yellow Bull’s strength was not as strong as Bright Tiger they all, who he represented was Saint Sovereign Heaven. Who dared to not give face?

Bright Tiger never dreamed that Ye Yuan would actually ride on Big Yellow Bull and return to Bright Tiger Territory!

Getting a confirmed answer, the four people trembled all over, their eyes full of shock.

What kind of status did the big yellow bull have?

Although they were half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens, they absolutely did not dare to offend the big yellow bull. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

But Ye Yuan actually rode him as a mount!

More importantly, the big yellow bull was actually willing to let him ride!

This was simply inconceivable!

“How can he? How dare he!” Wild Lion King said puzzledly.

In reality, there was a myriad of curses galloping across Big Yellow Bull’s heart currently.

He was considered to have completely lost his face today!

Who knew that at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly patted his head and said with a smile, “Be obedient, Big Yellow. Seeing that your performance is pretty good, I’ll award you this thing.”

As he said, Ye Yuan threw a Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill into Big Yellow’s mouth.

Big Yellow did not see clearly what that was either, but he knew that it was a heavenly pill. Either way, it would not be detrimental to him.

It was just that he did not harbor much hope about the effect of this heavenly pill.

What rubbish effect could the heavenly pill taken out by a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum have?

But as soon as the heavenly pill entered his mouth, he immediately felt something different.

He felt as if the top of his skull was opened up!

That huge door that he always wanted to touch, but could not touch, seemed to have a gap pushed open!

Saint Sovereign Heaven!

That was the feeling of Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Big Yellow’s heart was in an upsurge, excited to the extreme.

How many years had he waited for this day?

When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not help smiling as he said,?“Tsk tsk,?Big Yellow, you look dumb as hell. I didn’t expect that you’re still pretty smart. Didn’t think that this one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill let you gain enlightenment.”

He knew that this was the effect of Big Yellow’s immense accumulations erupting.

Although the true grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was incredible, it was impossible to really play a role in breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

Most of it was due to Big Yellow’s own accumulations.

Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was equivalent to an ingredient added to enhance the efficacy of a medicine.

This kind of state was about the same as Jiang Li breaking through to Jade Sovereign Heaven back then.

Of course, it was naturally impossible for one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to knock open the door of Saint Sovereign Heaven.

But after taking this step, Big Yellow was only half a step away from Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Big Yellow continued walking forward, but the imposing momentum on his body became stronger and stronger.

The mountain full of true spirits looked at Ye Yuan, their eyes full of shock.

He fed the big yellow bull a grade three heavenly pill, then the big yellow bull broke through!

Gradually, there was an additional fleeting and ephemeral aura on Big Yellow, exactly alike Bright Tiger and the rest.

This kind of aura was precisely the hallmark of a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Big Yellow forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart and opened his mouth and said, “Big Yellow thanks Master Ye for bestowing the pill!”

At this moment, he finally understood what Lord Saint Exalt’s words meant.
