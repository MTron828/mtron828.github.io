Chapter 1352: Wu Meng Academy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Yuan, if you want to become strong, why not officially join the Myriad Treasure Tower! You’re also aware, the Myriad Treasure Tower is Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s business. He is the wealthiest among all of the heavenly emperors. As long as you join the Myriad Treasure Tower, there definitely won’t be any issues with cultivation resources!” Yang Rui said.

“Many thanks for Brother Yang’s good intentions, but ... this Ye already has his own plans.” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Yang Rui could not help being disappointed.

With Ye Yuan’s alchemy talent, he was bound to be able to be put in an important position in the Myriad Treasure Tower.

However, Ye Yuan had his own plans.

He could mobilize the Myriad Treasure Tower’s spirit medicines. Firstly, Yang Rui was open-minded. Secondly, it was because what he mobilized were all Tier 1 spirit medicines.

Even the Immortal Grove Region in the Divine Dao Era, Tier 1 divine rank spirit medicines were not to say they were everywhere, but at the very least, they were not lacking.

But the spirit medicines that Ye Yuan’s pill refinement required in the future, Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower could not afford it. The Myriad Treasure Tower upstairs probably would not give in to his endless demands either.

Ye Yuan did not believe that the Myriad Treasure Tower was a monolithic block.

Where there were people, there would be the Jianghu. In the future, if somebody tripped him up, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s identity would be a burden instead.

Just in this Jewelhill City, didn’t Feng Ping appear?

Yang Rui’s eyes suddenly lit up and said, “Since Younger Brother, you’re not willing to join the Myriad Treasure Tower, why not go to the Wu Meng Academy!”

“Wu Meng Academy?” Ye Yuan said rather surprisedly.

“That’s right! Wu Meng Academy is Wu Meng Capital City’s official academy. Chen Yongnian and Wang Su’s elder brother, Wang Song, were from Wu Meng Academy! That place has over half of the young geniuses within Wu Meng Capital City’s boundary. Furthermore, there are cultivation methods capable of cultivating to grand completion Origin Deity!” Yang Rui said.

Hearing Yang Rui’s words, Ye Yuan understood very quickly.

Wu Meng Academy was equivalent to Wu Meng Capital City’s talent reserves. The various major counties’ city lords probably all came from the Wu Meng Academy.

This way, Wu Meng Capital City’s control over those counties below would be very secure.

As for cultivation methods, Ye Yuan did not really care.

He already made up his mind to walk his own path. Ordinary cultivation methods, he naturally held in contempt.

Rather, over half of the young geniuses gathered here. This made Ye Yuan very moved.

The rise of a powerhouse could not dispense with sparing with other powerhouses.

Shutting oneself in a room to make a cart made it difficult to take its place in higher circles.

“Oh? Then how does one join this Wu Meng Academy?” Ye Yuan asked.

Yang Rui said, “Wu Meng Academy recruits a batch of students every 100 years. As long as the martial artist’s strength reached Grotto Profound Deity Realm, a skeletal age under 200 years old, they all can join the entrance test. As long as one passes the test, they will be able to become Wu Meng Academy’s outer-court disciple. Three years later, it’s just nice the period for Wu Meng Academy to recruit students.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise when he heard that, “There are no less than a thousand counties under Wu Meng Capital City. How many people are going to participate in the entrance test?”

Grotto Profound Deity Realm martial artists could be said to everywhere in the Heavenspan World.

Even if one county just produced a hundred people, that was 100 thousand people too!

In reality, even Jewelhill City, this kind of small city, the Grotto Profound martial artists under 200 years old were far from 100 people too.

Let alone those large counties.

Yang Rui smiled and said, “Indeed, each time Wu Meng Academy recruits students, there are no less than 500 thousand taking part. However ... those able to pass the first round of assessments are only less than 10%! Those able to pass through all three rounds of assessments are also merely around a hundred people. Among these, the vast majority are all late-stage Grotto Profound martial artists. There is even a small portion ... that is grand completion Grotto Profound Realm.”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “So difficult?”

Yang Rui nodded and said, “Hence, those able to pass through the test are all geniuses among geniuses! In the past, at its lowest number, it was just over 30 people passing the assessment!”

Hearing Yang Rui’s words, Ye Yuan also felt immense pressure.

Of course, even more, it was anticipation!

Truly as Yang Rui said, this Wu Meng Academy, he had to go.

Without comparing with other geniuses, he would forever not know where his shortcomings lay.

Being able to cultivate to late-stage Grotto Profound before 200 years old, even grand completion, it could be said that everyone was exceedingly talented.

Ye Yuan crushed everyone when at the Immortal Grove World. But in the Heavenspan World, he really did not have this confidence.

Ye Yuan’s skeletal age was merely over a hundred years old. But he cultivated for several hundred year’s time in the World Suppressing Stele’s space.

Just on this aspect, he already lost to many of Wu Meng Capital City’s young generation.

Furthermore, this was even just in the Wu Meng Capital City’s territory!

In the Heavenspan World, capital cities like Wu Meng Capital City were goodness knows how many. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Among them, there was probably no lack of some heaven-defying to the extreme genius martial artists!

“Hearing Brother Yang says so, I’m really looking forward to this Wu Meng Academy very much!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze revealed thick fighting intent. Clearly, he was very interested.

But Yang Rui smiled and said, “Younger Brother, this brother has a presumptuous request. I hope that you will agree!”

“What is it, Brother Yang feel free to say!” Ye Yuan said.

“If ... I’m saying if, if you’re unable to pass the test, how about joining our Myriad Treasure Tower, how’s that?” Yang Rui asked profoundly.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he laughed and said, “Huhu, it turns out Brother Yang is waiting for me here! Done, this is not an issue!”

The two people exchanged a glance and started chortling with laughter.

Not that Yang Rui was pessimistic about Ye Yuan, but wanting to pass the Wu Meng Academy’s entrance examination, the difficulty was indeed very high.

The two people were currently chatting fervently when suddenly, outside the Myriad Treasure Tower fell into chaos.

Coming out to take a look, they discovered that the fat-headed and large-eared Wang Pianran actually came to shout abuses in the streets again!

But this time, she and all of the Wang Family’s people wore mourning dresses and came to hurl abuses.

Wang Yuxiang’s corpse was placed in front of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s front door.

It was just that all of them had doleful looks, an expression like their parents died. It indeed made people’s countenance change visibly.

By the side, quite a number of people were whispering.

“The Myriad Treasure Tower is also too much. Currently, they already crushed the Wang Family until like this, they actually still want to drop a rock down the well, killing Wang Yuxiang father and son!”

“Yeah, didn’t expect that the Myriad Treasure Tower actually dared to be so brazen!”

“Why doesn’t the City Lord Manor come out and manage it? I didn’t expect that the once glorious Wang Family actually fell into such a plight!”

...

Wang Pianran was a venomous woman, the words she cussed were very nasty. All in all, it was splashing dirty water on the Myriad Treasure Tower.

When Yang Rui said this scene, he was angered until he was livid with rage.

The Myriad Treasure Tower had always cheated neither the old nor the young. But how could they stand such slandering from Wang Pianran?

“There’s really not a good thing among the Wang Family’s people! This ability to turn black to white is really first-rate! I’ll go and chase them away!” Yang Rui said furiously.

He was just about to move but was stopped by Ye Yuan.

“Brother Yang, calm your anger. Wang Pianran is merely a puppet! The more you chase them away, the more this matter can’t be explained clearly. If they want to scold, just let them scold to their heart’s content!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Yang Rui’s expression changed, and he said, “But at this rate, how will the Myriad Treasure Tower’s business still carry on?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Yang rest assured, calculating the time, it should be about time.”
