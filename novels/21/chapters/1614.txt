Chapter 1618 Unfortunate Wretch

“Haha! Why wouldn’t I be cocky? The precious treasure being born this time might be the turning point for me to break through to the Celestial Deity Realm! The height that you and that damn master of yours couldn’t reach, I reached it. Won’t you say I should be pleased with myself?” Gao Yuan said smugly.

In fact, he was still one generation older than Zheng Qi.

According to his seniority and strength, he shouldn’t come to this place personally.

Now that he was here, he naturally came for the lucky chance this time.

He already had half a foot stepped into Celestial Deity Realm, but he kept failing to break through.

Such a lucky chance, he naturally would not let it go easily.

Zheng Qi was angered by him until his face was livid, but there was nothing he could do.

Even though he caught up from behind, catching up to Gao Yuan’s realm, who could have thought that he relied on the lucky chance he schemed and to harm his master? At the end, he actually had half a foot stepped into the Celestial Deity Realm.

Zheng Qi’s talent was also extremely outstanding. But regarding the Celestial Deity Realm, he had the heart, but his strength was lacking.

These few years, he practically used everything in his arsenal and was also unable to find the opportunity to break through to Celestial Deity Realm.

“You naturally have a possibility of obtaining the lucky chance and breakthrough to Celestial Deity Realm. But you also have a likelihood of dying in the Fiend Calling Ridge, becoming a pile of yellow dirt,” Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up.

Gao Yuan’s face fell, his eyes revealed a murderous light as he looked at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was not afraid and met Gao Yuan’s gaze.

“Where did this punk come from? The seniors are talking. Is there a right for you to interrupt?”

Nobody would have expected that while talking, Gao Yuan raised his hand and it was a palm.

A powerful palm force rushed toward Ye Yuan at lightning speed.

This palm was too sudden. There were no signs beforehand at all, resulting in everyone not reacting.

Sounds of exclamations could be heard all around. It was as if already seeing the scene of Ye Yuan being smacked into minced meat by a palm.

How powerful was the palm of a half-step Celestial Deity powerhouse? Even just a casual strike was also not what a grand completion Origin Deity martial artist could resist.

But the next scene made everyone’s exclamations become stupefaction.

Boom!

A loud boom, a first-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse beside Gao Yuan directly flew out.

That person fell to the ground, his entire person incomparably miserable and was actually on his dying breath already.

Gao Yuan’s countenance suddenly changed and he cried out in shock, “Spatial laws!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Oh, not bad huh. You have some knowledge.”

Gao Yuan’s expression was ugly to the extreme. Fishing out a medicinal pill, he said to the people beside him in a solemn voice, “Let him take it!”

The people beside him did not dare to dawdle, hurriedly going to feed the medicinal pill to that unlucky first-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse, who was twisting up in a fluster.

Gao Yuan looked at Ye Yuan, a cold light glinted.

He was bullying Ye Yuan on the basis that was young just now, determining that he was Zheng Qi’s junior disciple who was brought out this time to see the world.

Who could have expected that this young man was actually so troublesome and actually comprehended spatial laws!

What kind of visual prowess did Gao Yuan have? He saw through at a glance that Ye Yuan’s spatial laws were not that kind of half-baked stuff, but extremely profound comprehensions

That blow earlier looked simple, but in reality, Ye Yuan manipulated spatial laws, went through a very complicated spatial shuttling, only then, transmitting the attack onto that unfortunate wretch.

This level of means was simply inconceivable.

“Spatial laws! That young man actually knows spatial laws!”

“My God, this kid actually comprehended spatial laws, and he’s only just Origin Deity Realm!”

“When did such a freak appear in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City?”

...

Hearing spatial laws, cries of exclamations sounded out by the side.

This kind of heaven-defying law, who did not wish to comprehend it?

Except, let people cultivate bitterly for ten thousand years and they also could not figure out a speck.

Even though these Divine Lord Realm powerhouses could use a portion of spatial power, regarding spatial laws, they still only knew a bit of superficial knowledge.

But Ye Yuan was just Origin Deity Realm and had not even opened up his own small world, and actually already comprehended spatial laws.

For a moment, jealousy, envy, various emotions, suffused in the air.

When Gao Yuan attacked just now, Zheng Qi got a fright too. But Gao Yuan caught him by surprise, making him too late to come to the rescue.

No one could have thought that Ye Yuan had long been prepared, giving him a dose of his medicine, crippling a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse of the other side.

All of the frustrations just now turned into veiled delight.

“Old Punk Gao Yuan, you made an error of judgment this time. Ye Yuan isn’t some junior. He’s my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s elder. He still has the qualifications to scold you a bit,” Zheng Qi said with a beam.

There was another wave of exclamations around. It was still their first time hearing that an Origin Deity Realm could actually become an imperial city’s elder.

But just based on this spatial laws, it seemed to be sufficient as well.

He nearly one-shotted a first-layered heaven Divine Lord with one move!

Even though there was suspicion of opportunism, if it were others, who could do it?

Gao Yuan’s gaze was icy-cold and clearly had killing intent aroused towards Ye Yuan. He said in a cold voice, “Very good, you all are stirring up this old man’s wrath here! Then you guys have to be prepared to receive this old man’s fury!”

While talking, a terrifying pressure instantly descended.

Those who were slightly weaker practically could not stand on their feet.

The pressure of a half-step Celestial Deity Realm was too strong!

Zheng Qi revealed a solemn look, secretly thinking to himself that this old fellow’s strength seemed to be much stronger again.

But Ye Yuan was composed in the face of a crisis, seemingly not worried at all.

At this time, Ling Zikun suddenly appeared and said, “Dear me, Brother Gao Yuan, on the account of this old man’s face, you all put down your individual grievances first, alright? Opposite, the fiend race is glaring like a ravening tiger. If we have internal strife first, who the big lucky chance belongs to this time would be hard to say!”

Gao Yuan’s expression changed, his aura instantly withdrawing.

He gave a cold snort and said, “Ling Zikun, looking on the account of your face today, I’ll spare this brat first! But after this matter, this old man will definitely seek justice for the disciple under me!”

Ling Zikun hurriedly said, “Brother Gao Yuan, calm down! Brother Gao Yuan, calm down! Oh, right, this one is the Yan Ze who’s garrisoned at Tiderain City. He’s more clear about the situation around here, let him introduce it first.”

A middle-aged man flashed out from behind Ling Zikun, gave a bow to Zheng Qi, Gao Yuan, and the rest, and said, “This lowly one, Yan Ze, pays respect to your excellencies!”

Suddenly, a person behind Yan Ze cried out, “Y-Ye Yuan! You’re Ye Yuan!”

Yan Ze’s gaze turned intent and he could not help sweeping over Ye Yuan, immediately feeling somewhat familiar.

Suddenly, he also suddenly came to realize the truth and exclaimed, “You ... You’re Ye Yuan!”

Ye Yuan had long recognized these two people. One was the Yan Ze who had a chance encounter with him before, the other was an old acquaintance, Ling Feng.

He did not expect to actually be able to meet these two people on this kind of occasion.

Ling Zikun’s face fell and he said with a cold snort, “What Ye Yuan? Is Ye Yuan what you guys can call? Got to call Lord Ye Yuan or Elder Ye Yuan!”

This shock was by no means insignificant. Ling Feng did not understand, but Yan Ze understood what being an elder meant.

Thinking back then, when he saw Ye Yuan, the other party was still merely a little kid who had just entered Heaven Glimpse Realm.

Only a hundred over years had gone by, but Ye Yuan actually already became an imperial city’s elder?

This ... This was too fantastical, right?ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
