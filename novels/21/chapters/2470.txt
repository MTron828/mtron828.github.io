Chapter 2476: One-Man-Show!

The power of moonlight enveloped heaven and earth.

Those who were weak were already long unable to control themselves already, getting caught in an illusory realm and being unable to extricate themselves.

This was limitless samsara!

Although Yue Mengli’s move was not unleashed against them.

Only by reaching Deva Realm and above could one barely avoid being dragged into samsara.

This move was too horrifying!

“What powerful ocular arts! She clearly only cast the spell against Dao Ancestor Life alone, but her power of moonlight affected everyone present!”

“Ten-marks Heavenly Dao Realm, it’s actually even this kind of extremely strong ocular art! Our human race is really doomed this time!”

“I didn’t expect that the moment Heavenly Dao Samsara starts, is the moment when our human race collapses!”

… …

Each and every one of those Deva powerhouses was incomparably in despair. The strength that Yue Mengli exhibited made them lose all hope.

The nine great Dao Ancestors’ strongest Dao Ancestor Life was directly controlled by the illusory realm.

Then of those remaining, who could be Tian Qing’s match?

Back then, the 18 grand ancestors failed just one step short of success!

“Brother Chaotian, quickly wake up!” Ancestor Fire and the rest were very anxious when they saw the situation, utilizing various means, attempting to call Lin Chaotian back.

But it was completely useless.

Lin Chaotian stood there straight as a ramrod, motionless.

They immediately realized how terrifying this ocular technique was.

“Huhu,?it’s no use! Even if this progenitor gets hit by this move, I can forget about escaping without ten days to half a month too! If the Heavenly Dao True Martial of a Ten-marks powerhouse is so easily broken, then this progenitor would also be too useless as the divine race’s number one person!” Tian Qing said with a light smile.

Before this, Ten-marks powerhouse, there was only him alone in the divine race.

His might was indisputable!

Now, Yue Mengli squeezed into the ranks of Ten-marks. Displaying her Heavenly Dao True Martial, the power was naturally terrifying.

Ancestor Fire said in a solemn voice,?“Humph!?So what? Tian Qing, you’re also looking down on the few of us too much!”

Tian Qing laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “You’re right! This progenitor really does look down on the few of you! Dao Ancestors? Have you all forgotten? This progenitor was … also a Dao Ancestor in the past! How much capability you all have, would this progenitor not know?”

The expressions of Ancestor Fire and the rest were ugly to the extreme.

In front of the eight great progenitors, they really did not have any capital to be proud of.

If not for having obtained the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain, they would not even have the courage to fight.

Now, Dao Ancestor Life was trapped. They really could not see any chances of victory.

At this time, Tian Qing finally reined in his expression and said coolly, “Kill!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Seven lineage’s progenitors as well as the Heaven Lineage’s Tian Xing, eight people rushed forward together!

A powerful to the extreme pressure crushed them until everyone could not breathe.

This was a progenitor-level battle!

Although Tian Xin was just the Heaven Lineage’s number two person, his strength when compared to the eight lineages’ progenitors was about the same too.

It was already enough to deal with a Dao Ancestor with diminished strength.

With 16 astonishing auras rising up to the sky, it caused everyone’s expressions to change wildly.

Those Deva Realm powerhouses had long already hidden themselves far away.

But on the scene, there were still tens of thousands of human powerhouses who were caught in the illusion.

The moment the great battle started, they would die without a burial ground.

It was just that at this time, there was already no one who cared about them anymore.

Tian Qing stood calmly with his hands behind his back, clearly an appearance of watching a show.

The current situation might not need him to take the stage at all.

Of course, he did not lower his guard!

With Yue Mengli attaining Dao Ancestor, the divine race came into being once more. The person that he was most worried about was not the nine great Dao Ancestors but Yue Mengli!

He knew that with the divine race coming into being, Ye Yuan absolutely would not be willing to take things lying down!

However, he did not care about it a lot. With Yue Mengli this trump card around, Ye Yuan could not stir up any waves either.

Both sides were all set for a showdown, the auras astonishing, looking as if they were about to clash.

Right then, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

In the dark night, a white figure rose into the sky, heading straight for the clouds.

Crack!

Crack! Crack!

Immediately, lightning flashed and thunder clapped!

That figure rose steadily up, flying higher and higher.

The lightning in the sky also became more and more terrifying.

Terrifying Heavenly Dao pressure overshadowed these 16 supreme powerhouses very quickly.

The entire sky was thrown into upheaval by that figure.

Tian Qing’s pupils constricted and he exclaimed, “It’s Ye Yuan! What … does he want to do?”

Over on the human race’s side, cries of surprise also linked up together.

“It’s Lord Saint Azure!”

“What does he want to do? There’s extermination lightning above the sky! Does he want to commit suicide?”

“It’s dangerous up in the sky, but the spiritual energy there is also the thickest! He … He wouldn’t be thinking of breaking through there, right?”

… …

Above the sky, was a forbidden area to all martial artists.

The higher up, the more dangerous it was.

Even with the might of a Dao Ancestor, one could only soar over a million miles.

If one exceeded this height, they would be killed by extermination lightning!

That white figure was none other than precisely Ye Yuan!

His figure went higher and higher, reaching several hundred thousand miles in a blink of an eye.

However, he did not stop but went higher and higher instead.

Currently, it was precisely during Heavenly Dao Samsara, Heavenly Dao was in disorder.

Ye Yuan reaching this height already aroused Heavenly Dao’s chaos.

Above the void, extermination lightning was already eager to make trouble.

Crack!

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning fell from the void, swift to the extreme.

Including Tian Qing, everyone’s expressions changed abruptly.

“This lunatic! Quickly retreat!”

Tian Qing gave a loud roar and did not have time to think too much, directly dashing away.

The expressions of the seven great progenitors, as well as the eight great Dao Ancestors, changed one after another too, hurriedly retreating.

Lin Chaotian’s entire body trembled, and he actually broke free from the illusion. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This bolt of shocking lightning actually broke Yue Mengli’s Boundless Moonlight!

Yue Mengli also revealed her figure, her aura slightly chaotic.

When they saw that dreadful lightning dragon, their expressions changed wildly, hurriedly retreating.

Fighting at this time was tantamount to seeking death.

Who knew where that wildly dancing electric snake would land.

As long as you touched it, you would be dead.

Those human powerhouses were also startled awake, retreating one after another.

Very soon, Ye Yuan arrived above one million miles.

Here, spiritual energy was extremely abundant. Every pore on his body opened up.

That was right! He was here to break through.

Feeling Heavenly Dao Samsara, spiritual energy surging wildly, Ye Yuan knew that this was the best time for him to break through!

The great battle of the divine race’s progenitors and the Dao Ancestors was about to start. Once the battle started, the people would surely be plunged into misery and suffering.

Ye Yuan’s power alone was unable to stop them.

Then he might as well trigger the power of Heavenly Dao!

Being in the midst of a breakthrough, it would stop this grand battle!

Boom!

Ye Yuan’s divine sea seemed to have directly opened up the watergate, letting spiritual energy flow in crazily.

These ten years, Ye Yuan already broke through to the realm of Dao pill.

The act of repairing divine sea and meridians was already not considered a difficult task to him.

Crack, crack, crack?…

The crazed electric snake wandered around him fitfully.

But he did not care!

Ye Yuan released soul force, wrapping his entire body up.

Boom!

Lightning fell. Ye Yuan’s divine soul trembled. He was actually completely unscathed!

Chaos origin divinity was fearsomely powerful!

Everyone looked at this scene dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape, shocked speechless.

What was originally an astonishing great battle earlier now became Ye Yuan’s one-man show!
