Chapter 1876: Attracting Firepower

“E-Empyrean powerhouse!”

Escaping a calamity by a fluke, Ji Kang and the rest were not the least bit happy.

The unexpected appearance of fiend race Empyreans disrupted all of their plans.

They thought that similarly Empyrean powerhouses, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s abode should not have too great an attraction to Empyrean powerhouses.

This place was dangerous, but the benefits obtained might not be a lot.

This kind of thing was an arduous but fruitless task to Empyrean powerhouses.

Hence, no one thought that there would be Empyrean powerhouses who enter.

But now, two Empyrean powerhouses appeared all at once.

When the Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean saw these two mighty fiend race Empyrean powerhouses, he also had a solemn look on his face.

“Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean, is it? The Seven-Colored Aegirine belongs to the two of us, you don’t have objections anymore, right?” The fiend race Empyrean said.

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean gave a fierce howl and said, “The Seven-Colored Aegirine can only be possessed by Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s successor! If you all want it, you must kill me!”

The fiend race Empyrean laughed loudly and said, “There’s no choice then. Eymond, attack together and dispose of him!”

Two great fiend race Empyreans took a stride out, space trembled from it.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean was not the least bit afraid, clashing together with the two great Empyrean powerhouses.

The exchange of Empyrean powerhouses fought until space was reduced to fragments.

Those weaker Celestial Deity powerhouses were directly buried in oblivion by the air billows that flowed out.

How could Ji Kang and the rest still dare to remain in the vicinity, with each and every one running far away.

Immortal Grove World’s space was like shattered glass, spreading further and further.

The Immortal Grove World was plunged into an abyss of misery!

Far away, Ye Yuan’s heart was dripping blood.

The Immortal Grove World’s every blade of grass and every tree, he could feel it clearly.

In the current Immortal Grove World, mountains and rivers were crumbling, blood flowing like rivers.

Countless lower realms were already disintegrated and torn by dissension in the midst of this great battle.

“I can’t let them continue fighting anymore!”

Ye Yuan gritted his teeth, took a step out, and stepped right into the battlefield.

Three mighty Empyrean powerhouses spanning across in the middle, no one could enter that cave at all.

This figure that suddenly appeared made everyone get a big surprise.

Ji Kang’s gaze turned intent and he cried out in shock, “It’s Ye Yuan! Does this boy want to court death? Those are Empyrean powerhouses!”

“Heh, an ant who’s blind and reckless also wants to obtain the Seven-Colored Aegirine, to go hell!”

Eymond gave a savage laugh and suddenly threw a punch out. A terrifying ball of black energy shattered the void and fired toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan just felt like the end of the world had arrived. That horrifying power made his fleshy body fall apart.

Empyrean powerhouses were too strong!

“Stellar War Banner! Divine Vestige Space!”

Ye Yuan yelled out, injecting the power of Heavenly Dao frenziedly into the Stellar War Banner.

At the same time, he opened up the Divine Vestige Space!

Ye Yuan’s two eyes were icy-cold, not carrying the slightest emotion.

The power of the Stellar War Banner could virtually sweep across True God Realms. But facing an Empyrean powerhouse, it was somewhat inadequate to look at.

But Ye Yuan was simply a crawling bug in Eymond’s eyes, he did not pay attention to him at all.

The majority of his focus was placed on Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean.

This punch did not use his full strength.

Bang!

The black energy broke through the Stellar War Banner, the residual force slammed completely onto the Divine Vestige Space.

Those countless blue patterns directly fell apart to pieces.

Ye Yuan’s figure was also blasted out of the Divine Vestige Space by this punch.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan spewed fresh blood wildly, but he did not hesitate. With another flash, he flew straight into the cave.

“Mn? A Celestial Deity Realm boy received a punch of mine, and he actually didn’t die!” Eymond said in shock.

Not just him, Ji Kang, Yang Yidao, and the rest, were all dumbstruck with amazement.

Ye Yuan actually blocked an Empyrean powerhouse’s attack!

Although Eymond was not serious with this attack, if it were them, they would definitely be blasted into dregs.

But Ye Yuan actually forcefully blocked it!

Not only did he block it, he even had leftover strength to barge into the cave.

They discovered that ever since entering this mystic realm, Ye Yuan refreshed their understanding time and again.

From a Third Firmament Celestial Deity that was weaker until he could not be weaker, to killing Zhuo Han, then to humiliating Xu Xing, then to forcefully resisting three peak Third Firmament powerhouses.

Now, he could actually even block an Empyrean powerhouse’s attack. It was simply inconceivable!

“Qiao Yuan, Eymond, you two fools, why haven’t you quickly chased after?! This boy’s strength rivals Ninth Firmament True God, the people inside aren’t his match!” At this time, someone in the crowd suddenly bellowed wildly at the two great fiend race Empyreans.

Qiao Yuan’s brows furrowed. Looking over at that person, he frowned and said, “You know me?”

That person had an indignant appearance and said in a great rage, “Your Father is Devilfeather! Stop being long-winded, hurry up and go chase! When you see that boy, kill without amnesty!”

This person was none other than precisely Ji Xun who was seriously injured by Ye Yuan and escaped.

Qiao Yuan’s and Eymond’s pupils constricted at the same time, and they came to a realization very soon.

Empyrean Devilfeather, that was an old subordinate of Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang.

Back then, he was sent by Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang to pursue Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove, but he never came back. They did not expect that he actually did not die yet.

The two of them did not doubt Devilfeather’s words. To be able to say out the two of their names and even say the name Devilfeather, this was not what anyone could do.

The two exchanged a glance and Qiao Yuan said, “Chase!”

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean also gave a loud roar, raised his blade, and chased after, saying, “Where are you running!”

Three great Empyrean powerhouses all chased into the cave.

The catastrophe of the Immortal Grove World finally stopped for the time being.

Space slowly started to recover. Everything also returned to tranquility.

But at this time, all the people inside the Law Enforcement Hall were white as a sheet.

In front of this kind of apocalyptic power, their strength was fragile like ants.

Facing this kind of apocalyptic crisis, they were so feeble and powerless.

What they could only do was wait quietly.

“This calamity ... wonder if the Immortal Grove World can pull through or not,” Fang Tian said with a pale expression.

...

Sensing that horrifying undulation stop, Ye Yuan also let out a long sigh in relief.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan’s fresh blood spewed mouthful after mouthful. His injuries were extremely severe.

Although the Divine Vestige Space was powerful, facing existences like Empyrean powerhouses, it was still unbelievably fragile.

“My strength is still too weak! That damn Old Fart Immortal Grove, what the hell do you want to do?” Ye Yuan roared. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Inside his sea of consciousness, Dustless was silent.

He knew about Ye Yuan’s feelings toward the Immortal Grove World. This place had his kin and was also the place where he grew up.

He could not possibly watch these people die unfeelingly, watch this world crumble.

Therefore, his fury toward Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove also reached the limit.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove clearly had the power to suppress Empyreans. But after arriving here, he did not suppress anymore.

Once the power of an Empyrean was unleashed, that was truly destroying heaven and earth.

Facing Empyreans with Ye Yuan’s current strength, it truly felt powerless.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Just as Ye Yuan was denouncing angrily, intense fighting sounds came from in front.

Suddenly, his eyes suddenly saw light. A massive karst cavern appeared before his eyes.

Inside the karst cavern, iridescent rays of light blossomed. It was unbelievably beautiful.
