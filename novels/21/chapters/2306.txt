Chapter 2310: Pilljade’s Shock!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back. Facing the Deva Realm powerhouse, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook who was surging with killing intent, his expression did not change in the slightest.

He was not worried about Heavenly Emperor Distantbook making a move at all. Because Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest were definitely both paying attention to here currently.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest must be secretly delighted right now. So how could he possibly let him prevail?

If really forcing Sacred Ancestor High Priest to take action, the entire Cloudheart Realm would be destroyed. This was not something to joke around with.

Just as the atmosphere was extremely tensed, a man in white robes slowly stepped out and arrived beside Heavenly Emperor Distantbook.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s expression changed, and he said, “Eldest Senior Brother!”

The arrival was precisely the Medicine Ancestor’s eldest disciple: Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was not overbearing like Distantbook, saying with a light smile, “Master wants to see you. You withdraw first. There’s me here.”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s expression flickered indeterminately and was extremely embarrassed. Senior Apprentice Brother was finding a way out for him here.

Even when he, the exalted Heavenly Emperor Distantbook faced off against Sacred Ancestor High Priest back then and returned in defeat, he had also never been in such an embarrassing situation before.

He did not expect that today, he was humiliated like so by a junior.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s heart burned with bitter hatred, but he was also helpless and could only say, “Yes, Junior Apprentice Brother takes my leave.”

Done talking, he turned around and left.

Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy looked at Ye Yuan and said with a kindly smile, “Lastingjoy has been unclear all this while why Lord Sacred Ancestor would establish Young Friend Ye as Second Sage. Upon seeing today, only now am I deeply aware of Lord Sacred Ancestor’s keen insight into a person’s qualities! Second Sage defeating Junior Apprentice Brother, you’ll become famous in the Heavenspan World from today onwards.”

But when Ye Yuan heard, his brows furrowed slightly.

This person was very amicable, a faint smile hanging on his face from beginning to end, looking like the Maitreya Buddha, giving people a feeling of relaxing their vigilance.

For some reason, Ye Yuan kept feeling that this Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy was incomparably deep, and seemed even more difficult to deal with than Heavenly Emperor Distantbook.

This sentence sounded like a compliment, but it actually concealed a blade in the dark. Not only did it give Cloudheart Realm a way to step down, it even conveniently took a little stab at Ye Yuan.

The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time was clearly instigated by Cloudpill Summit first. Earlier, it was also Heavenly Emperor Distantbook provoking continuously. Now, it became him fishing for fame, achieving his fame with a battle with Heavenly Emperor Distantbook as the stepping stone. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, who Ye Yuan defeated was just Heavenly Emperor Distantbook and was not Cloudheart Realm.

This could only be considered the exchanging of views between powerhouses, and it did not represent the exchange of views between two great factions.

These ancestors could not help secretly marveling at Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy’s prowess.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Just winning against a junior, nothing worth bragging about. Is Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy interested in sparring with this Ye?”

Such a deep Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy gave him an unfathomable feeling.

And this feeling made him rather excited.

Who knew that Heavenly Emperor Lastingjoy just chuckled and waved his hand and said, “Even Junior Apprentice Brother lost to Second Sage; this emperor’s strength is lacking and doesn’t dare to challenge Second Sage. Alright, official matters need to come first. The Myriad Region Alchemy Conference continues.”

A transmission door appeared once more in front of each person.

The second round competition officially began.

After a huge storm passed, everyone could not remain calm anymore.

Quite a few people were whispering to each other, and the object of the discussion was naturally Second Sage Ye Yuan.

The impact that this battle brought was not just a Myriad Region Alchemy Conference, but the entire alchemy world!

The alchemy world that already did not have ripples for a long time, had huge waves surge once more because of Ye Yuan suddenly roaring into existence.

Even when Sacred Ancestor High Priest roared into existence back then and challenged Medicine Ancestor, it was also not stronger than the shock caused by Ye Yuan’s battle.

After all, when Sacred Ancestor High Priest challenged Medicine Ancestor back then, he was already a Deva Realm super powerhouse. He had lived for God knows how many tens of thousands of years.

But how old was Ye Yuan?

He was merely a young man who was less than 3000 years old. In front of these ancestors, Ye Yuan was merely a teenage boy.

The age could virtually be ignored!

Ye Yuan’s potential was too great, great until everyone did not dare imagine.

After the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time, the alchemy world’s structure would completely change. The Priest Temple’s position would close in on to Cloudheart Realm.

Later, it might very likely form a situation of existing side by side.

Amidst the discussion, the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference went round after round. The number of people that got eliminated became more and more, the true young generation’s powerhouses also gradually found their way to distinction.

Zou Rui was like his grandmaster, peerlessly domineering. His fights with his opponents had never exceeded two hours.

Often, after the match had gone on for a while, the opponent would directly abstain and concede defeat.

Even though Yun Yi and Ning Siyu kept on winning in their respective groups, they were far from as breathtaking as Zou Rui. They appeared much more mediocre in the conference where geniuses gathered.

Rather, each and every one of the other holy lands’ geniuses was powerful, crushing their peers, appearing much more outstanding than the two of them.

But what everyone found strange was that no matter how strong the genius, the two of them could always defeat their opponents after a bout of hard battle.

Coincidentally, Yun Yi ran into his great-grandfather Empyrean Pilljade in one of the matches.

In the end, Yun Yi firmly suppressed Empyrean Pilljade and defeated his own great-grandfather.

Empyrean Pilljade’s strength was still rather formidable in Ancestor Realm. After he lost to Yun Yi, he was unbelievably shocked.

He did not expect that in a short thousand years’ time, Yun Yi actually already grew to such a level!

One had to know, even though Yun Yi was very talented back then, he was merely a little brat in his eyes.

But the child back then already surpassed him in all aspects in alchemy strength.

Thousand over years, walking through the road that he walked for millions of years, the shock in his heart could be imagined.

Toward Yun Yi, he had always been extremely furious in his heart.

Because in his view, Yun Yi’s action was a kind of betrayal.

While other people’s betrayal would be infuriating, his own great-grandson’s betrayal made him feel even more ashamed and furious.

But now, his heart finally eased up a trace. He suddenly somewhat understood Yun Yi’s choice.

Pilljade suddenly felt that he was too shortsighted and was not even as good as his own great-grandson.

Compared to such powerful strength, what did his bit of shoestring margin count as?

With strength, would one still be scared that there would be no benefits?

He was still flopping around in the Southern Border, that small pool of water, while Yun Yi was already standing in the sea of the entire Heavenspan World, debating on Dao with myriad regions’ geniuses!

The level was already completely different!

What shocked and surprised him even more was that Ye Yuan did not conceal his abilities but gave Yun Yi his all.

One could tell from this point how magnanimous Ye Yuan’s heart was.

How Yun Yi’s talent was, Pilljade was very clear.

He was a genius, but placed in the entire Heavenspan World, what did it count for?

But it was such a Yun Yi who was already taught by Ye Yuan into a peerless expert!

What Ye Yuan was formidable in was not just himself. His ability in teaching disciples was similarly hair-raisingly impressive.

No one would pay attention to the transformation in his heart. In this place, he was merely a minor character.

The competition went on round after round, the shock and transformation in Pilljade’s heart also became stronger and stronger.

Yun Yi’s path of advancement was not breathtaking, but it was extremely solid!

Overcoming all difficulties along the way, he reached the finals.

And his opponent was precisely Zou Rui!
