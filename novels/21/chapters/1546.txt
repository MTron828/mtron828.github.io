Xiao Riyue’s face darkened. The people surrounding and watching all sucked in a cold breath.

This Master Ye was really too awesome, to actually dare talk this way to a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!

“Punk, you’re very proud! But you indeed have the capital to be prideful! I’ll give you a chance, join our Sun Moon Gang. In the future, this land of the south city, you can roam as you please! Absolutely no one will dare to find trouble with you like today,” Xiao Riyue said and forcefully pressed down the anger in his heart.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Are you soliciting me here?”

Xiao Riyue said coolly, “This divine lord successfully breaking through today, it’s a sign that the other two gangs are doomed. You have no future following Xing Guan!”

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said disdainfully, “I think that you’re misunderstanding something. You’re still not qualified enough to solicit me!”

The people surrounding and watching did not even dare to breathe loudly. But their gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of ‘admiration’

This provocation was too ruthless!

Xiao Riyue’s face fell and he said, “Are you refusing a toast, only to drink a forfeit?”

But Ning Siyu suddenly spoke up at this time and said, “Master Ye’s alchemy standard is also more than enough to enter the Pill Tower! Just the likes of you, a measly little first-layered heaven Divine Lord, what qualifications do you have to solicit him?”

Xiao Riyue was so angry!

He went through untold hardships and finally broke through to Divine Lord Realm. Originally, he thought that anyone would have to make a detour around him when they saw him.

He did not expect that two hotheads jumped out today and did not take him seriously at all.

Was Divine Lord Realm so worthless?

“Hahaha ... A measly little first-layered heaven Divine Lord! Little girl, what high-sounding sentiments! Entering the Pill Tower? He got to have the life to enter it too! Since you guys don’t know how to appreciate favors, then this divine lord will destroy your Miracle Hand Parlor today, see what you guys have to be unbridled!”

Xiao Riyue laughed from extreme fury, hating these two fellows who did not know the immensity of heaven and earth to the extreme.

A surge of world power rippled out, akin to a huge flood wave, directly sending all the people around him flying.

“A guy who hasn’t seen the world before. Breaking through to the Divine Lord Realm and you’re flaunting your prowess. Your this bit of strength got to tuck your tail between your legs and behave when placed in the inner city! If you dare to touch a single strand of hair of this young lady, do you believe that someone will come and annihilate you straight away?”

Facing Xiao Riyue’s powerful pressure, Ning Siyu’s complexion was somewhat pale.

But her words were still full of contempt.

Clearly, she did not take Xiao Riyue, this Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, seriously at all.

Xiao Riyue’s heart thumped, thinking to himself, could it be that this lass comes from the inner city and her status is extraordinary?

But he denied this very quickly.

The inner city’s darling daughters, each and every one of them was incomparably arrogant. How could they possibly come to such a small medicine shop to be a little medicine attendant?

This lass must be making an empty show of strength!

“Heh, using the inner city to scare this divine lord, do you take me to be scared from young? This divine lord will exterminate you, lass, today. I want to see whether or not someone will really come and annihilate me!”

Xiao Riyue snorted coldly, a palm struck toward Ning Siyu with overwhelming momentum.

Boom!

Under everyone’s dumbfounded gazes, Xiao Riyue’s figure flew out backward, directly blasted onto the streets.

Xiao Riyue’s internal organs were in shock, his entire person struck silly.

He stood up rather shakingly, and he looked at a young person in front of him with immense shock.

How could there be a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse here?

“Who did you say ... you were going to exterminate just now?” Ning Fangrong’s eyes were like torches, looking down on Xiao Riyue, his eyes full of killing intent.

Ning Siyu was first stunned, then immediately revealed a look of wild elation. Rushing forward to pull Ning Fangrong’s arm, she said, “Big Brother, why did you come?”

Ning Fangrong gave her a doting glance and said, “If I don’t come, weren’t you going to get bullied by people?”

“Hehe, it’s still Big Brother who’s the best!” Ning Siyu said in a spoiled manner.

Ning Fangrong rubbed Ning Siyu’s head dotingly but turned his head around, his expression was cold as he said to Xiao Riyue, “I’m asking you, who were you going to exterminate, huh?”

Xiao Riyue’s expression was incomparably ugly. He did not expect that a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse suddenly popped out in the crowd.

One should not look at how the other party was young. His strength was much greater than his. This person was totally not what he, a rookie who just broke through, could compete with.

He had just uttered the big talk, who knew that someone really jumped out to annihilate him straight away.

Who could understand this kind of bitterness?

Where was the so-called invincible in the south city?

The so-called sweeping across the south city and unifying the three gangs?

Such a young Divine Lord powerhouse, his status was clearly extraordinary. He definitely came out of the inner city. Moreover, it was definitely a major faction in the inner city.

That little girl’s status was really extraordinary!

But such a little girl, why would she be ordered around like a maidservant in such a small medicine shop?

Are ... you mentally ill?!

Xiao Riyue’s face squeezed out a smile that was even uglier than crying and said, “This one had eyes but couldn’t see. I wonder which inner city family’s young master is this little brother from?”

Ning Fangrong said calmly, “You’re still not fit to address me as your brother! The imperial city has a rule that Divine Lord Realm martial artists are not to interfere with the outer city’s matters. Are you ... slighting the City Lord Manor right now?”

Xiao Riyue was crying bitterly in his heart!

He had just broken through to the Divine Lord Realm and had not reported to the inner city yet.

Originally, he wanted to slice through a knot with a sharp knife, directly unifying the three gangs before talking.

This kind of thing, the inner city would also open one eye and close one eye, tacitly allowing it.

After all, these people in the outer city were no different from ants in the eyes of the inner city.

To Xiao Riyue, when he entered the inner city, he also needed the support of cultivation resources.

Clearly, after consolidating the three gangs, the new Sun Moon Gang could provide him cultivation resources unceasingly.

Except, the ideal was very well-endowed, but the reality was bony[1].

Who knew that he was so unlucky, running into someone who came out of the inner city when he just broke through.

“This ... This ... I ... I ...” Xiao Riyue stammered and could not even complete his sentences.

When He Xiao and Luo Yu saw this scene, their faces revealed incomparably gloomy looks.

Originally thought that they had a major backer now. In the end, the major backer had just risen and was smacked to death by someone with a slap.

This inconspicuous little medicine shop, its background was really deep to the extreme!

This lass actually called this Divine Lord Realm powerhouse as big brother, then her status was definitely extraordinary.

However, it was such a lass who willingly became a maidservant who was ordered about inside this little medicine shop.

Then Master Ye’s background ...

Could it be that Master Ye was a Pill Tower’s newly-emerged genius alchemist? Coming to the outer city to hang a ‘Will Grant All Requests’ signboard was in order to train?

The more everyone thought, the more reliable it felt.

It seemed like only this explanation was the most logical.

In everyone’s eyes, Ye Yuan’s image became incomparably tall.

Although Ning Fangrong was the same as Xiao Riyue, both being first-layered heaven Divine Lord martial artists, the noble air emitting off his body was what Xiao Riyue did not possess.

It was only to see him say coolly, “You go to the inner city’s entrance and wait for me. Later, I’ll bring you together into the Martial Tower and receive punishment!”

Xiao Riyue’s expression changed, and he said in a panic, “This ... Your Excellency, I ...”

Ning Fangrong’s brows furrowed and he said unhappily, “What? You have a problem? To dare clamor about killing my Ning Family’s people, I have to admit that you’re very brave!”

Xiao Riyue’s entire body trembled, his legs turning soft, and he knelt down with a thud, crying out involuntarily, “You ... you’re a member of the Ning Family!”

[1] Yes, it’s a euphemism for boobs. The ideal is big boobs, but the reality is flat.
