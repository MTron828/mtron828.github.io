Chapter 3047: Thread Control Pill Refinement!

“So strong!”

“Accomplished in one stroke! Is Emperor Sakra Heaven so easy?”

“This is the power of the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill!”

“Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill can increase 30% strength in an instant, helping to break through the seal. But, looking at this power ... it’s probably far more than 30%!”

... ...

From swallowing the heavenly pill to breaking the seal with one spear, it was merely a short ten breaths of time.

This process was too short!

For ordinary martial artists, even if it was a same rank powerhouse like Kong Tan, breaking open the second seal would need several hours to accumulate power too.

But Yang Qing did it too effortlessly.

Such a great bottleneck was completely no bottleneck to him at all.

...

“Hahaha, satisfying! What’s this heavenly pill of yours called?” Yang Qing said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan said, “Let’s call it Chaos Element Heavenly Pill then!”

Yang Qing contemplated and said with a nod, “Fitting! Chaos Element Heavenly Pill! Very good! Zhou Xianchen, are you convinced?”

Zhou Xianchen was somewhat jealous. He knew that Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill was not simple.

This was because Yang Qing had not reached the peak of Emperor Vast Heaven at all. It was not time to break through his realm yet.

But his breakthrough had an unstoppable momentum.

This heavenly pill was naturally incredible.

At least, it was not worse than the quality he refined.

“Tch, you, Yang Qing, are number one on the All-Heavens List and Thousand Souls List, dual lists! If you can’t even break through to Emperor Sakra Heaven, you can go and kill yourself! This heavenly pill is merely adding flowers to embroidery! Just this and you even specially gave a name, how shameless!” Zhou Xianchen said with a sneer.

In reality, this was also what most people thought.

Yang Qing’s strength was formidable, overwhelming all heroes.

It was not as hard as imagined for him to break through to Emperor Vast Heaven.

The Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill was merely superfluous.

Such a shocking breakthrough, it was still mainly because of Yang Qing himself.

“That’s right! What you guys are competing in is the result based on 2300 people, and not one person! Among the 2000 Emperor Vast Heavens that Brother Zhou picked, there are already 80% who succeeded in breaking through! Can you do it, Ye Yuan?” Jinnan said.

Before Ye Yuan spoke, Zhou Xianchen satirized him to his face again, saying, “Master Ye, you wouldn’t be refining one by one like this, right? By the time you finish refining, wouldn’t we have to wait until god knows when? How do we still explore the Labyrinth Divine Palace?”

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said with a smile, “Not to that extent! That one earlier was just a warm-up. Now, it officially begins!”

Boom!

Before his voice faded, a cluster of nirvanic rebirth fire instantly burst out.

This cluster of nirvanic rebirth fire was hundreds of feet in diameter!

Then a large pile of heavenly medicines was directly thrown into the nirvanic rebirth fire by Ye Yuan.

Zhou Xianchen saw it easily. That large pile of heavenly medicines had sufficient quantities for 2000 people!

This guy was actually going to refine 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills at once?

“Is there a mistake? Young Master Zhou can only refine 300 at a time, but Ye Yuan is going to refine 2000 in one go?”

“This guy is too capable at posturing, right?”

“Who does he think he is? A chaos heavenly master?”

... ...

When everyone saw this scene, they instantly blew up, mocking Ye Yuan for overestimating his own ability one after another.

Refining 2000 grade eight heavenly pills at the same time, furthermore, Ye Yuan was still just Emperor Vast Heaven Realm; could he hold out?

If his divine essence got exhausted halfway through the refinement, that would be fun.

Furthermore, refining 2000 grade eight heavenly pills at the same time, this requirement of the origin divinity was simply hair-raisingly harsh.

What rights did a mere grade eight heavenly alchemist have?

Even some laymen were also mocking Ye Yuan’s ignorance.

The refinement previously had indeed stunned everyone.

But, refining 2000 in one go, everyone had to admit that posturing too hard would sprain your waist!

“Hur hur, although the Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pill isn’t a very difficult grade eight heavenly pill to us, it can’t be randomly refined too. Refining 2000 of this kind of heavenly pill at the same time, it’s absolutely impossible under chaos heavenly master! This boy is probably being funny, right?” Chu Fang could not help laughing when he saw the situation.

Jinnan clasped his hands to Zhou Xianchen and said with a smile, “Looks like we have to congratulate Brother Zhou in advance for returning fully loaded!”

Zhou Xianchen also felt that his victory was certain and said smilingly, “This boy has talent. It’s just a pity that he postures too much. Otherwise, even if he isn’t my match, he wouldn’t lose too terribly either. But now, hur hur.”

Yu Ran also smiled and said, “I don’t know pill refinement, but refining 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills, this divine essence consumption is far from what Emperor Vast Heavens can bear, right?”

Zhou Xianchen nodded and said, “For 2000 Eight Universe Seal Breaking Pills, it needs at least the divine essence reserve of grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm before one can barely manage to refine it. But this isn’t the most important thing. The most important thing is that this is a huge burden on the origin divinity! Even if he has this strength, his origin divinity will be overwhelmed too! A single misstep, and he’ll even hurt himself. Let’s just wait and see the show!”

Zhou Xianchen’s analysis was already quite on point. Everyone understood it.

Ye Yuan was very amazing.

In the end, he could only amaze himself to death.

Disregarding other things, just the grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven divine essence reserve would be too much for Ye Yuan to bear.

Hence, everyone settled down and waited to watch the show.

Even when Yang Qing heard it, he also wondered if Ye Yuan went overboard?

He was originally brimming with confidence in Ye Yuan, but now, he had some doubts.

Otherwise, refining 500 at a time should not be that much of a burden, right?

Just 500 was enough to suppress Zhou Xianchen!

This guy was really keen to steal the limelight!

Yang Qing hoped that he wouldn’t mess it up.

Except, everyone could not detect that Heavenless was currently spying on every movement and action here.

Seeing Ye Yuan refine pills, Heavenless chuckled and said to himself, “This boy, what astonishing control! Condensing essence as threads, controlling 2000 heavenly pills at the same time, not a single bit of divine essence is wasted! This skill, even this ancestor’s breath is taken away in astonishment too!”

He had long been paying close attention to Ye Yuan!

The others, even if it was Yang Qing, in Heavenless’ eyes, it was nothing more than this.

One had to know, the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s most stunning genius was not those in the Thousand Souls Hall, but he, Heavenless, himself!

He was the number one rare talent since time immemorial!

But Ye Yuan’s appearance made his eyes light up.

This guy actually brought a million people and cleared the Vertical Heaven Stairs!

Being able to deduce his Dao so thoroughly was not what the average Emperor Vast Heaven could accomplish.

Later, Ye Yuan even ravaged the Thousand Souls Hall, bringing more than 50 thousand people into the Labyrinth Divine Palace. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Each step was stunning to the extreme.

He examined his own conscience and felt that even if it was him, he could not do better than Ye Yuan too.

What he did not expect even more was that Ye Yuan was actually also a very powerful heavenly alchemist!”

This divine essence control made him click his tongue in wonder.

Outsiders could not see it, but inside the nirvanic rebirth fire, two fine threads spread out, linking up 2000 medicinal embryos.

Two fine threads, one was chaos divine essence, the second was origin divinity.

Ye Yuan relied on these two fine threads to control the refinement of 2000 heavenly pills.

This kind of refinement, the utilization of divine essence and origin divinity was delicate to a hair-raising extent.

Regardless of whether it was divine essence or origin divinity, it was all employed where they were needed the most without any wastage.

Heavenless discerned that compared to Ye Yuan, Zhou Xianchen was nothing at all!
