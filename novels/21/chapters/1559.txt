Chapter 1563 Spar

The moment Deercry’s aura was released, everyone’s faces changed.

He was a sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord. Wanting to teach a lesson to a few first and second-layered heaven Divine Lord juniors, wasn’t that easily accomplish?

Except, he did not see fear on Lu Yi’s face. Instead, he saw thick ridicule and disdain.

“Deacon Deercry is very domineering huh, to actually want to help this old man teach disciples! Except, to do so to this old man’s disciples, it is probably isn’t your turn to come and teach them, right?”

A group of people came out of the inner hall in a file. The one in the lead was precisely Ye Yuan.

While Xuan Yu walked at Ye Yuan’s side.

Regarding Xuan Yu showing up here, Deercry was incomparably shocked.

Why would the high and lofty Xuan Yu come to an inconspicuous little medicine shop in the outer city?

But what made him even more shocked was that this group of people was actually headed by a young man.

Deercry was a veteran too. This detail landed on Deercry’s eyes naturally transmitted a lot of information.

Seeing this scene, Deercry’s pupils shrunk slightly, incredibly shocked in his heart.

He could not help sizing Ye Yuan up. What ability did this boy have, to actually be able to make Xuan Yu willingly walk behind as a contrast?

This small until it could not be smaller little medicine shop seemed to be remarkable!

After the shock, Deercry recovered his cool very quickly and said in a lighthearted manner, “Turns out that Second Elder is here too. But these few disciples of yours have no regard for their elders, really losing face for our Pill Tower!”

Xuan Yu’s temperament was good and always held himself aloof from the world. But Deercry’s words still made him rather uncomfortable.

“No regard for their elders? Huhu, Lu Yi is very respectful towards this seat. Where’s the talk of showing no regard for his elders? Deacon Deercry is managing things a little too broadly, right?” Xuan Yu said coolly.

Deacon faked a smile and said, “This old man is, at any rate, the Pill Tower’s high-level deacon, and is also considered the same generation as Second Elder. Could it be that your disciples can’t respect me as a teacher? Saying that I’m taking advantage of my seniority in front of everyone’s face like this, if this isn’t showing no regard for their elders, what is it?”

Xuan Yu could not help choking, uncertain how he should refute.

In terms of eloquence, he was really not Deercry’s match.

Their lineage was at a disadvantage in this aspect.

Seeing that one sentence stumped the other party, Deercry was even more pleased with himself and said with a cold smile, “Second Elder, showing no regard for one’s elders, according to the Pill Tower’s rules, they have to be punished by 100 floggings of a broad paddle! I wonder how you view it?”

Xuan Yu’s gaze turned intent, finally having a trace of anger.

This Deercry was overbearing, really a paradigm of taking advantage of his seniority.

Yet, his words squeezed Xuan Yu until it was enough to choke.

Xuan Yu also knew that these few disciples of his were very dissatisfied with Deercry. But this kind of temper tended to be easy to suffer losses.

A hundred paddles were not considered a severe punishment. But if it really hit, that was hitting Xuan Yu’s face! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Lu Yi also had panic on his own face. Earlier, he showed complete disregard for Deercry by relying on the fact that his master was here.

But at times, strength could not determine everything.

The imperial city had its own rules of the game. He seemed ... to have incurred trouble for his own master.

Actually, it was not once or twice that his apprentice brothers had suffered such a loss too. But they truly could not stand it.

Just as everyone was at a loss on what to do, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Old thing, you got to have the strength to be people’s elders. Do you have it?”

Deercry was currently being pleased with himself. When he heard this, his face could not help turning dark and he said in a cold voice, “Where did this punk kid come from, to dare speak to this seat like this? If this seat doesn’t have the strength, could it be that you have it?”

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said coolly, “If I didn’t guess wrongly, Huang Qian should have been diagnosed by you, right? You couldn’t even identify his ailment, but I cured him. Could it be that ... I’m not as strong as you?”

Once these words came out, the crowd burst into an uproar.

“Oh yeah, Huang Haoran personally said at that time that he had once found a Four-star Alchemy God to take a look before. This Four-star Alchemy God was probably Wu Feng’s master, right?”

“A Four-star Alchemy God actually couldn’t even identify the illness, truly disgraceful!”

“Tsk tsk, Master Ye’s will grant all requests signboard isn’t hung in vain. At least in this aspect, he’s much stronger than Four-star Alchemy Gods!”

...

Outsiders had yet to react, but Ye Yuan discerned the other party’s flaws at a glance.

The words when uttered immediately reversed the situation.

Deercry shot a fierce glare at Wu Feng. Wu Feng’s neck shrunk, knowing that his master was angry.

This matter, everyone did not associate them together. Now, Ye Yuan saying it out was simply blatant face-smacking!

When Lu Yi saw this scene, he could not help looking toward Ye Yuan gratefully.

Ye Yuan’s one sentence resolved their master and disciples’ awkwardness.

However, Deercry clearly would not submit obediently. He said with a cold snort, “Brat, everyone has their shortcomings and merits. Any alchemist also dare not guarantee that they can cure any illness! Moreover, you are you, Lu Yi is Lu Yi. You’re not a member of the Pill Tower and isn’t bound by this rule. But he is!”

Deercry’s thoughts were very meticulous. He was not so easy to deal with.

Otherwise, Xuan Yu would not be at the extent of suffering losses at his hands repeatedly.

Ye Yuan stealthily substituted the concept and dragged him out, but he came to realize the truth very quickly and plucked Ye Yuan out.

This way, Ye Yuan became an outsider, what more could he say?

Deercry also realized that there might be something strange about this Ye Yuan, that was why Xuan Yu’s lineage would gather here.

Hence, he avoided the sharp edge and bit onto Lu Yi and not let go.

Lu Yi’s standard, Deercry was all too clear.

His potential was not bad, but his pill refining strength, at the present, it still did not reach him, this middle-rank Four-star Alchemy God.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and he said disdainfully, “Is that so? Since you think that you’re his senior, then you should probably be stronger than Lu Yi?”

Deacon said coolly, “That’s of course! If this seat is not even as good as a junior, how can I be a high-level deacon? Kid, you aren’t ... thinking of making him spar with me, right?”

“Hiss ...”

The surroundings drew a cold breath. They were all stunned by Deercry’s identity.

The Pill Tower’s high-level deacon, this was simply a god-like existence!

To these outer city martial artists, it was simply lofty and out of reach.

They also did not expect that Wu Feng’s master’s status was actually so illustrious.

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said disdainfully, “So what if yes? Not letting you witness the strength of young people, you’ll never know how ignorant you are.”

When Lu Yi heard this, he could not help somewhat losing confidence and could not refrain from saying to Ye Yuan, “Master Ye, I ...”

Ye Yuan stared at him, his eyes like torches as he questioned, “What? You don’t even have the courage to have a fight with him?”

Lu Yi’s age was far older than Ye Yuan, but in front of Ye Yuan, he was just like a junior.

His gaze turned sharp and he said in a solemn voice, “Of course I do!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Then isn’t it settled?! If you can’t even deal with this old fogey, how will you inherit Master Xuan Yu’s mantle in the future? Today, let this old fellow take a look at your strength!”

The moment Deercry heard, he could not help laughing wildly and said, “What a joke! Brat who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, courage has to be established on the basis of strength. Courage without strength, that’s called a moth flying into the fire! Understand?”
