Chapter 1471 One Man, One Army!

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan turned into an afterimage, charging over from the back of the fiend army.

With this, Ye Yuan went all out, sword energy roaming unobstructed, directly downing a large strip.

The fiends swarmed out in full force and were already minding their heads and disregarding their rear-end. The back of the army was very hollow.

The Origin Deity Realm commanders already rushed under the city walls at this time. At the back were mostly Grotto Profound Realm and Heaven Glimpse Realm existences.

Ye Yuan, one person and one sword, was akin to a tiger entering a flock of sheep, killing until the sky and earth dimmed.

In front of him, there was not an opponent who could last one exchange.

One Sundering Stars charging out directly reaped a large group of fiend soldiers. Wailing sounds echoed together.

“Not good! There’s a human army sneak attacking at the back!”

“Army my *ss! There’s only one person!”

“One person? Still waiting for what? Attack together and kill him!”

...

Ye Yuan carved out the effect of an army by himself.

His speed of charging forward was extremely fast. Very soon, he charged to the central region of the fiend army.

The opponents he encountered were also getting more and more. There were even some thousand-man commanders whose strength already reached grand completion Heaven Glimpse.

But after Ye Yuan broke through to middle-stage Heaven Glimpse, his strength increased greatly.

Grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouses could only cause a bit of hindrance to him. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

His movement technique was too fast. Those grand completion Heaven Glimpse powerhouses could not catch up with his footsteps at all.

“Not good! Quickly stop him! He wants to destroy the fiend crossbows!” shouted a thousand-man commander.

A group of fiend soldiers was taken aback with horror, blocking Ye Yuan’s path like tidewater.

What that thousand-man commander said was right, Ye Yuan’s target was precisely the fiend crossbows firing the Fiend Dragon Throwing Spears!

This thing caused too much harm to the human soldiers. If not for these fiend crossbows, it would also be impossible for the fiend soldiers to scale up the city walls so quickly.

Sure enough, the swarming tactic worked!

Ye Yuan’s path was blocked by countless fiend soldiers.

Ye Yuan’s strength was strong, but he was just one person after all.

The fiend soldiers ahead could not be killed entirely at all.

Finally, Ye Yuan’s speed slowed down.

He was still several hundred feet away from those fiend crossbows. But this distance of several hundred feet was like at the far end of the horizon.

He killed a large swarm and even more fiend soldiers came up to block again.

“He can’t push anymore! This human is so strong! Use swarming tactic to exhaust him to death!”

“Everybody attack together! He already can’t escape! Rushing in alone, no matter how strong, it’s also delivering himself to death!”

“Kill, kill, kill! Kill this human!”

...

Not only did Ye Yuan’s slaughter not make these fiends afraid, but it also stimulated their devilish nature even more instead, all rushing over like they were crazy.

“Heh, human-wave tactic, is it?”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh. But the movements of his hands did not slow down in the slightest, continuously reaping the lives of the fiend soldiers.

From Ye Yuan rushing into heavy encirclement until now, it was merely a short several dozen breaths. Ye Yuan already killed hundreds of people.

This kind of lethality virtually rivals a small-scale troop.

But even if the small-scale army could achieve this result, they would definitely be wiped out by the fiends at this time too.

But Ye Yuan was perfectly unscathed currently.

Chasing Moon!

In the crowd, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly erupted, charging toward a grand completion thousand-man commander with inconceivable speed.

That thousand-man commander never thought that Ye Yuan could actually still release such a stunning move under everyone’s besieging.

Pfft!

Caught unprepared, his head was directly exploded by Ye Yuan, his body falling weakly onto the ground.

Those fiend soldiers were all shocked until they could not close their mouths. A powerful thousand-man commander was actually one-shotted in one exchange?

This human was truly a little too freakish, right?

In this dazed short while, Ye Yuan already sped towards the fiend crossbows like lightning!

A distance of several hundred feet was merely a matter of a twinkle to Ye Yuan.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Ye Yuan released several Sundering Stars like lightning, directly hacking those fiend crossbows into pieces.

Although those fiend crossbows were powerful, they were merely profound divine artifact grade sieging weapons, having weak defensive power.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, destroying them were merely a matter of a wave of a hand.

And at this time, the top of the city walls already entered a white-hot stage. Both parties already entered the state of hand-to-hand fighting.

Those Origin Deity Realm powerhouses directly slaughtered into the human army, all incomparably powerful.

But in this kind of war, Origin Deity Realms were not invincible.

Such intense fighting, they would be forcefully exhausted to death by the human soldiers.

Hence, they needed a continuous stream of reinforcements to join in before they could press forth irresistibly.

But those Origin Deity Realm commanders suddenly discovered that the fiend army that joined in behind them did not seem to be many.

Furthermore, why did the Fiend Dragon Throwing Spears stop firing?

Turning back to look, their hearts immediately went cold.

They were on the city walls, the situation below was clear at a glance.

The back of the fiend army, a large number of fiend soldiers had fallen into a big mess!

What was going on?

That large swarm of fiend soldiers was probably no fewer than five to six thousand people!

The fiend race’s losses already exceeded 10 thousand with the repeated assaults. There were only less than 20 thousand people left.

Five to six thousand people being tied down all at once, their current numbers were not much more than the human soldiers defending the northern city anymore.

Under this kind of circumstance, how could they breach the city?

Xiu Lie being heavily injured by the giant crossbow, his strength was greatly diminished. At this time, he already clashed with Wang Yifeng.

Although he could suppress Wang Yifeng, wanting to finish off the other party within a short time was very hard to accomplish.

For some time, both sides actually fell into a stalemate!

The humans relied on geographical advantage and finally withstood the fiend race’s assault.

Both sides unleashed a sanguinary tug-of-war on top of the city walls!

“Damn it! Why hasn’t this human’s divine essence run out yet?”

“We already have close to a thousand man squad dead, his combat power is actually still so strong!”

“Could it be that this guy’s divine sea forever won’t dry up?”

...

Those fiend soldiers were almost despairing. They were really using numbers to go and deplete Ye Yuan’s divine essence.

But they had already a thousand man team dead, and Ye Yuan was still full of spirit and energy, without the slightest appearance of divine essence drying up.

Five to six thousand-man commanders wanted to besiege Ye Yuan, but they could not catch up to Ye Yuan’s movement technique at all.

Ye Yuan was like a mudfish, shuttling back and forth in the army freely. Nobody could catch his figure at all.

Time slowly trickled by, Ye Yuan finally could not endure anymore.

When those few thousand-man commanders saw this, each and every one of them was delighted, like they were injected with stimulants, roaring loudly. One of them shouted, “He’s almost done for! Keep your chins up, kill him!”

Those fiend soldiers were already in the battle for so long to the point they were exhausted already. Seeing the situation, each and every one of them was incredibly excited, swarming over towards Ye Yuan like tidewater.

Continuously killing for a day and night, Ye Yuan’s divine essence was really almost already nearing the bottom.

However, his goal was already achieved.

“Heh, Grandpa Ye played enough, not playing with you all anymore!”

Ye Yuan laughed loudly, figure moving, directly flying up to the sky.

Sword maneuvering flight!

Those fiends were utterly dumbstruck with amazement. They expended a price of close to a thousand people before finally depleting Ye Yuan’s divine essence.

But he directly flew away!

“Kill!”

Right then, an ear-splitting roar rose up from the dense forest. All of the fiend soldiers’ faces immediately turned ashen!

The reinforcements were here!
