Chapter 1699 Heavenly Eagle“s Trump Card!

In the distance, the cluttered and violent attacks shook until space was trembling.

Utmost Peace Imperial City’s four great Celestial Deity powerhouses already suppressed Heavenly Eagle’s side all-round.

They were well-deserving of being veteran Celestial Deity Realms. Regardless whether it was divine essence or world power, it was much more stronger compared to Coldfeather they all, newly-advanced Celestial Deities.

At that start, it still did not show. But along with the passing of time, this kind of advantage was clearly magnifying continuously.

Even Zuo Shujie already showed signs of defeat too.

“Continuing like this isn’t a solution! City Lord they all almost can’t hold on anymore!”

“Utmost Peace’s Celestial Deity Realms are too strong, ancestor they all, the time they broke through is still too short!”

“What to do? Could it be that ... Heavenly Eagle’s Dao teachings are going to wither away henceforth?”

...

Far away, Heavenly Eagle’s martial artists all revealed worried looks.

The joy of two great Celestial Deity Realms appearing was already swept clean.

“Hahaha! Zuo Shujie, so what if four Celestial Deities? Just based on your bit of means, can you be my match?”

Qiao Anshan laughed wantonly as he unleashed martial techniques frenziedly, continuing his victorious pursuit.

Zuo Shujie’s aura gradually weakened, virtually losing the strength to retaliate.

The other few people all encountered similar situations.

Wen Yilin laughed loudly and said, “What did I say? Ants are ants in the end! Do you think that the disparity of more than 100 thousand years can be made up for by breaking through to the Celestial Deity Realm? Hahaha, prepare to die!’

The inspector smiled as he looked at Ye Yuan and said, “Now, do you still think that I have no need to state this condition?”

Exchanging pill for one’s life and Ye Yuan directly helping him refine pills, this was two different concepts.

Ye Yuan directly helping him refine pills was equivalent to him owing Ye Yuan a favor.

To martial artists, what they were most unwilling to do was to owe others favor.

If the favor could not be repaid, when breaking through, it might produce a mental demon. The consequences would be very severe.

Therefore, between martial artists, what was valued more was an equivalent exchange and not owing favors.

To Ye Yuan, it was similarly likewise. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The inspector’s status was extraordinary. Having him owe him a favor was equivalent to having a safeguard in this Southridge Ten Nations.

This kind of bargain deal, not making it was a fool!

But Ye Yuan’s face did not have any hint of worry as he said and said, “Yes, it’s not necessary.”

The inspector shook his head, feeling that Ye Yuan would not shed tears without seeing the coffin.

But he was not in a hurry either and said with a faint smile, “This envoy is giving you this chance now. In a while, it will be you coming to beg this envoy!”

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “If I agree now, in a while, Lord Inspector’s face won’t look good.”

The inspector chuckled when he heard that and said, “You, kid, are rather interesting. This envoy wants to see if a miracle will appear today or not.”

Ye Yuan said, “Not a miracle. It’s strength!”

The inspector shook his head and laughed in spite of himself. He could not be bothered to bicker with Ye Yuan anymore.

While up in the sky, signs of Zuo Shujie and the rest’s defeat were already more evident.

Qiao Anshan’s face was even more proud of himself. He held a massive greataxe and shouted fiercely, “Zuo Shujie, this axe will send you to the west! Overlord Heaven-Splitting Axe, kill for me!”

This massive axe was a celestial deity mystic treasure. This axe cleaving out seemed to have the power to split apart heaven and earth.

Clearly, this was Qiao Anshan’s true killing move.

A series of exclamations came from below. Quite a number of people all shut their eyes, unable to bear the sight of seeing Zuo Shujie being hacked to death.

Rumble!

An earth-shaking loud noise came over, but Zuo Shujie was not split in half.

Rather, Qiao Anshan himself had been repelled backward several tens of thousands of feet.

Qiao Anshan’s expression changed and he cried out, “Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain! Impossible! You ... You refined the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain? No, wait, this isn’t your Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain!”

The current Zuo Shujie appeared slightly wretched, supporting a dark small hill on his palm.

That small hill emitted waves of powerful aura on Zuo Shujie’s hand.

Hearing that, Zuo Shujie smiled coldly and said, “Didn’t expect it, right? Ye Yuan already completely refined the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain. Haven’t you always wanted it very much? Then come and taste its true power today!”

Done talking, Zuo Shujie pushed with his palm. The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain turned into a streak of black light, instantly smashing toward Qiao Anshan!

The speed was too fast. Qiao Anshan could not avoid it in time at all and could only block with the giant axe.

Bang!

Qiao Anshan was directly smashed flying away, fresh blood spewing wildly.

He revealed a look of astonishment, his eyes full of disbelief as he said, “Impossible! Just how many years has it been? How can he, a Divine Lord Realm brat, possibly refine the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain?”

Zuo Shujie chuckled and said, “If you’re able to survive, you can go and ask Ye Yuan. But as for now ... heh heh!”

Zuo Shujie controlled the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain and clashed together with Qiao Anshan once more.

The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain in Zuo Shujie’s hands, that power was a completely different concept than in Ye Yuan’s hands.

Qiao Anshan’s giant axe was already extremely powerful. But as long as it bumped into the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, Qiao Anshan immediately flew out backward.

Such a battle was simply unreasonable.

The might of a xiantian celestial deity mystic treasure was displayed beyond all doubt at this moment.

If the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain could not be completely refined, it would not be able to fully unleash its true power.

Ye Yuan could still use it to smash people, but using it in a battle of Celestial Deity powerhouses would not cut it.

Ye Yuan refining it fully, even though he was unable to unleash its true power due to his realm being low, lending it to Zuo Shujie to battle, that power was totally different.

Therefore, that was why Qiao Anshan would be so shocked seeing the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain.

The Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain was extremely difficult to refine. Qiao Anshan did not think that this thing could be used to battle at all.

Otherwise, lend him a few gallbladders and he also would not dare to issue this Golden Sword Token!

For Ye Yuan to be able to refine the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood so quickly, it was naturally because of the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood.

Ye Yuan’s comprehension in origin magnetic law was already extremely high. Coupled with the natural affinity of the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood, he naturally refined the Origin Magnetism Spirit Wood many times faster than others.

The current Qiao Anshan wanted to vomit blood several times. Under the circumstances where the strength difference was not great, the suppression of the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain was simply too terrifying.

The moment the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain came out, the battle situation immediately had a great reversal.

Over there, He Chong suddenly brought out the Immortal Binding Rope, catching his opponent by surprise all of a sudden.

He Chong was a veteran Celestial Deity Realm too, the difference from his opponent was not big.

Now, suddenly having an additional celestial deity mystic treasure, he took the absolute upper-hand all of a sudden.

When his opponent saw the Immortal Binding Rope, he nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

This was Utmost Peace’s celestial deity mystic treasure. Now, it was actually being used by He Chong to deal with him!

The most blinding one still had to be Coldfeather.

He did not take out any magic treasure. But his figure suddenly became erratic, his entire person seemingly shuttling back and forth in space.

Spatial laws!

“It’s spatial laws! Ancestor Coldfeather he ... he comprehended first-layered heaven spatial laws!”

“I understand! No wonder he wanted to break through in the Martial Tower! Turns out that he went to comprehend spatial laws!”

“These 100 thousand over years were also not completely wasted away! With spatial laws, even if it’s just first-layered heaven, one’s strength will be totally different too!”

...

Watching the scene, Heavenly Eagle’s martial artists cried out in shock.
