Chapter 2426: Make You Lose Three Layers of Skin!

Although Ye Yuan was seriously wounded at this time and his aura being feeble, his words were full of disdain and sarcasm.

Daymeld’s expression was very ugly as he said in a deep voice, “Are you goading this progenitor? What a joke! Even with how vast this world is, is there still a place that this progenitor doesn’t dare to go to?”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Is that so? Then you can come and try whether I can reach the top or not!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to talk any longer, and so he continued climbing up.

Daymeld could not help choking and actually did not chase after right away.

He had indeed been intimidated by Ye Yuan!

Ye Yuan’s calm expression made him somewhat uncertain.

Immediately, he smiled coldly and said, “Terrific lad, making an empty show of strength in front of this progenitor? Really almost got bluffed by you! A mere Heavenly Emperor Realm also wants to reach the summit of rules? Do you really think that this progenitor grew up being frightened?”

What kind of existence was Daymeld, it was naturally impossible for him to be intimidated by a few words.

But he did not know that Ye Yuan was making use of precisely this mentality of his. That was why he would intentionally goad Daymeld.

Ye Yuan was able to climb above 60,000 miles. This itself was extremely unusual already.

If Daymeld was somewhat fearful and did not dare to come up, then Ye Yuan would have wasted all his previous efforts.

But, as long as he goaded slightly, Daymeld would definitely think that he was maintaining the appearance of strength, and chase after.

Sure enough, Daymeld fell for it.

60,000 miles!

65,000 miles!

70,000 miles!

When it reached 70,000 miles, Daymeld became more and more shocked.

But he was still not willing to believe that Ye Yuan could really reach the top.

Hence, he chose to continue pursuing

71,000 miles!

73,000 miles!

When it reached 75,000 miles, Ye Yuan was still climbing.

While at this time, it already became extremely strenuous for Daymeld to barge through the formations.

All of a sudden, his heart thumped wildly, finally realizing that something was wrong.

How could a mere Heavenly Emperor Realm possibly climb to a height of 75,000 miles?

Furthermore, he discovered that ever since he entered Eight Void Mountain, the distance from Ye Yuan had been constantly shrinking, but had been within a manageable range all along.

It was like, this was simply a trap!

“Not good! Could it be that this kid is really able to reach the top? No way! I can’t go up anymore! Otherwise, even if it’s me, I’ll be biting off more than I can chew too!”

Daymeld’s expression changed wildly and he turned around and was about to leave.

But right then, a burst of cold laughter came from behind him. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Daymeld, you already climbed so high. You’re going to leave without resting for a bit?” Ye Yuan said sarcastically.

Daymeld’s expression was solemn as he said, “Boy, you’re actually able to climb to the top of the mountain! This is impossible! However, even if you can reach the summit, it’s no use either. This is a dead formation! It can’t trap me!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh and said, “Is that so? Maybe it can’t kill you, but ... not making you lose three layers of skin today, you can forget about leaving!”

Rumble!

The entire Eight Void Mountain Range suddenly started trembling fiercely.

Nine ghostly fires emitted a dazzling light at the top of the mountain.

A terrifying aura instantly spread throughout the entire mountain range.

Seeing this scene, Daymeld’s expression changed drastically, all the hairs on his body standing on end. A feeling of incredible danger welled up in his heart.

“This is impossible! You ... You activated the grand array? This is a rules grand array, how can you, a mere Heavenly Emperor Realm, possibly activate it?”

The scene that happened before his eyes completely surpassed Daymeld’s imagination.

A rules grand array was actually activated incomprehensibly just like this!

Boom!

The place where Daymeld was standing suddenly erupted with a terrifying explosion, and actually directly blasted Daymeld flying.

This explosion came extremely suddenly, without any sound, but was extremely powerful.

With Daymeld’s strength, he was actually unable to stop it.

Boom!

Bang, bang!

Daymeld was in midair when another series of shocking explosions came over, blasting until Daymeld flew around everywhere extremely wretchedly.

Each explosion sound carried a terrifying to the extreme power.

Even ordinary Deva Fifth Blights would also be blown into smithereens under this explosion.

This was the power of rules!

Lin Wushuang’s figure appeared beside Ye Yuan quietly and he said in concern, “Lord Saint Azure, your injury ... ”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and seethed with killing intent as he said, “Won’t die! Of the divine race army, those who entered the range of the grand array, kill without mercy!”

Lin Wushuang said respectfully, “Yes!”

He then saw Ye Yuan make a gesture. Immediately, the entire Eight Void Mountain’s restrictions seemed to be like boiling water, instantly boiling over.

Horrifying explosion sounds sounded out everywhere on Eight Void Mountain Range.

Those slightly weaker divine race and abyss monsters were directly blasted into flying ashes.

In virtually an instant, more than half of the divine race army was killed or injured!

How could the horror of a grand array of rules be described with words?

Back then, Lin Wushuang used this grand array to kill the divine race until wails of doom filled the lands.

At present, this scene was played out again under Ye Yuan’s careful planning!

While at this time, the human race powerhouses were virtually all trembling.

They were dumbstruck with amazement by this scene before their eyes.

Apart from Ni Xuan and a few people, they completely did not expect that this Eight Void Mountain’s forbidden land actually became their place of heaven-defying turnaround!

They only saw the divine race experts in front of them being blasted, becoming flesh and blood in a blink of an eye.

This kind of power truly startled heaven and earth and even made gods and ghosts weep.

While in another place, the unpredictable army led by Pang Zhen was already waiting until they were burning with fury.

The moment Eight Void Mountain’s grand array erupted, Pang Zhen’s angry roar immediately spread throughout the three armies.

“Brother, charge back for me! Don’t let a single one of the Divine Children Legion’s bastards off!”

“Kill!”

The unpredictable army’s power spread throughout the vast expanse of open ground all at once.

Seeing one sworn brother after another die miserably under the Divine Children Legion’s besiegement, they had long already had a stomach pent up with anger.

At this time, they finally exploded.

Only to see each of the unpredictable legion’s warriors have blood-shot eyes, urging their speed to the extreme, pouncing over in the direction of the Divine Children Legion.

At this time, the ten thousand people led by Wan Zhen were already left with just several hundred people, and they were still hanging on their lives bitterly.

These several hundred people protected Wan Zhen in the middle. Even if they died, they were not willing to take half a step back too.

Previously, Wan Zhen led his men in a charge, and he rushed in front alone.

There were Nine-marks powerhouses injected in the Divine Children Legion too.

Wan Zhen fought one-on-many, beheading all of the Divine Children Legion’s powerhouses. However, he himself was also just left with half a life.

Just as they were on the brink of despair, battle cries suddenly shook the sky.

The army led by Pang Zhen already rushed over!

Fighting in close quarters, Pang Zhen attacked with fury, lightning source surging wildly, slapping more than a dozen divine children to death with a palm.

The unpredictable army had an unstoppable momentum, completely suppressing the Divine Children Legion’s imposing momentum all at once.

They fought one-on-many, coupled with attacking in rage, killing until the Divine Children Legion suffered a crushing defeat.

... ...

On the upper echelons’ side, a silent explosion blew up, those initial-stage and middle-stage Nine-marks powerhouses instantly had a large number of them that was finished off.

Even late-stage Nine-marks supreme powerhouses were also utterly routed under this horrifying explosion.

Ni Xuan and the rest took advantage of the momentum to chase after them, slaughtering their enemies until the top experts of the divine race were completely powerless to fight back.

The moment Eight Void Mountain’s grand array rose up, the situation instantly reversed!

Coupled with that there were many coalition forces’ experts, fighting many-on-one, a large group of the powerhouses on the divine race’s side fell very quickly.

Those divine race powerhouses who did not enter the range of the grand array were all secretly exhaling that they got lucky.
