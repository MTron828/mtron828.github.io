Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Heaven-grade!

Heaven-grade!

Still heaven-grade!

Half a year already passed since Ye Yuan entered closed-seclusion. But no matter how Ye Yuan refined, he was also unable to break through to divine-grade!

Heaven-grade to divine-grade was like an insurmountable chasm. No matter how hard Ye Yuan worked, he was also unable to cross it.

Three months ago, Ye Yuan was already able to steadily refine heaven-grade medicinal pills.

But three months passed, Ye Yuan made no progress at all.

“Senior, I’ve already completely comprehended the spirit medicines’ medicinal properties. The Lesser Divine Essence Formation is also thoroughly comprehended already. Why is it that I just can’t refine divine-grade Divine Essence Pills?” Ye Yuan wondered.

Dustless said, “Divine-grade is not in the ranking in the first place. Refining heaven-grade medicinal pills, as long as one worked hard, it can be achieved. But divine-grade, it will depend on one’s comprehension ability and lucky chances! For the same type of medicinal pill, divine-grade is another kind of realm! Only with repeated tempering can one have a possibility of comprehending Dao. But this to you is the hardest. Three months’ time, it is too short!”

One could say that divine-grade was the grade that tested an alchemist’s pill refinement talent!

Insufficient talent, no matter how hard you worked, it was also not possible to refine divine-grade medicinal pills.

But even if ordinary alchemists’ were exceptionally talented, it was also not possible to refine a divine-grade divine pill within three months.

Forget about three months, even three years, 30 years, it was also impossible!

A hint of understanding flashed inside Ye Yuan’s mind, and he said, “In this case, divine-grade divine pills already belong to the domain of ‘Dao’? Just like when I refined the Dao Defying Pill, it aroused the resonance of Heavenly Dao, the same?”

Dustless stroked his beard and smiled, praising, “That’s right! The path of medicinal pills, the things refined are corporeal objects, emphasizing skill but slighting the Dao. Therefore, wanting to touch the fleeting and ephemeral Heavenly Dao would be even more difficult!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “I understand!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan sat down cross-legged and no longer refined pills.

In his mind, he started recalling his contact with divine pills bit by bit.

From Dustless narrating the spirit medicines’ medicinal properties to comprehending the Lesser Divine Essence Formation, then to forming the pill, and then to heaven-grade Divine Essence Pill.

Every detail along the way, Ye Yuan re-experienced it anew.

After each time Ye Yuan refined pills, he would summarize it meticulously. Hence, towards each process, he would remember it vividly.

The current Ye Yuan seemed to have returned to that ignorant and dull novice, re-experiencing the process of refining the Divine Essence Pill anew.

Gradually, Ye Yuan entered a wondrous state.

At this moment, those five spirit medicines’ medicinal properties were seemingly shattered into countless fragments by Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was situated in this vast ocean of fragments, undergoing the experiences anew.

After that, Ye Yuan carried out a reorganization of these fragments!

Ye Yuan was already familiar with the five spirit medicines’ medicinal properties until he could not be any more familiar.

At this moment, those fragments continuously constructed new models in his mind.

Constructing, overturning, constructing again, overturning again!

Time passed day by day. In a twinkle, a month’s time passed again.

Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes, a glimmer of understanding flashed across his eyes.

Dustless’s gaze turned intent, and he said in amazement, “You ... comprehended everything?”

Ye Yuan nodded with a slight smile and said, “Should be!”

Dustless was stunned and blurted out, “This ... How is this possible? A month’s time and you comprehended it?”

Dustless was all too clear how difficult divine-grade Divine Essence Pill was to comprehend!

Even though the Divine Essence Pill was just the most basic divine pill, the refining difficulty was who knows how many times greater than the Dao Defying Pill.

Without the accumulation of time, wanting to thoroughly comprehend the Divine Essence Pill was impossible!

However, from Ye Yuan coming into contact with the Divine Essence Pill, merely less than three month’s time had passed.

This kind of improvement speed was too terrifying!

Ye Yuan just smiled and started to set up the Lesser Divine Essence Formation.

Taking action this time was totally different from any situation in the past.

A measly eight pieces of divine essence stones seemingly transformed into tens of millions of Great Dao in Ye Yuan’s hands, looking exceedingly profound.

Dustless’s eyes stared until it went wide. He was finally certain that Ye Yuan was not bragging!

He really ... comprehended it!

This kind of comprehension was different from other alchemists hitting the jackpot and refining divine-grade divine pills, but Ye Yuan really understood the Dao of the Divine Essence Pill.

In the future, when Ye Yuan refined the Divine Essence Pill, the chances of reaching divine-grade was absolutely above 1%!

One should not underestimate this one percent. For ordinary alchemist, even an exceptionally powerful One-star Alchemy God, the chances of refining divine-grade Divine Essence Pills would not surpass 1% either. It could virtually be overlooked!

Furthermore, following Ye Yuan’s understanding of Alchemy Dao becoming deeper and deeper, this chance would even become higher and higher.

The light faded away. A translucent Divine Essence Pill appeared before Ye Yuan’s eyes.

A divine-grade Divine Essence Pill!

“You ... You really comprehended it! Freak! Truly too monstrous! Seven months! You only used seven months’ time and comprehended the divine-grade Divine Essence Pill!” Dustless said, rather agitatedly.

Only at this time did he discover that he really underestimated Ye Yuan.

This guy was simply born for the sake of medicinal pills!

Solid foundation skills, heaven-defying comprehension abilities, terrifying talent, let him create a miracle!

Counting in the one month from before, Ye Yuan spent a total of one year and seven months in the World Suppressing Stele.

He used such a short time and refined the divine-grade Divine Essence Pill.

This was simply inconceivable!

One had to know that when Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove achieved this step back then, he also used a hundred year’s time!

The time that Ye Yuan spent was only 1% of what Immortal Grove spent!

However, Ye Yuan did not have an overly surprised expression.

Seven months had already gone by. He was only left with five months’ time!

Ye Yuan spent one year and seven months to comprehend the Divine Essence Pill. Then what about the Detoxification Pill, which was even harder than it?

No time to waste anymore!

“Senior, please teach me the refining method of the One-star Detoxification Pill.” Ye Yuan said.

Dustless nodded. He also knew that time was pressing. Hence, he collected his mind very quickly and started narrating to Ye Yuan the medicinal properties of the spirit medicines. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The Detoxification Pill’s divine rank spirit medicines had a total of seven kinds. This account of Dustless was ten days and ten nights!

The complexity of the seven kinds of spirit medicines far exceeded Ye Yuan’s imaginations.

Ye Yuan finally knew why the Divine Essence Pill was the most basic divine pill.

However, Ye Yuan refining the Divine Essence Pill already laid down a solid foundation. He was no longer an ignorant person.

But the speed of Ye Yuan comprehending the Detoxification Pill was goodness knows how many times faster than the Divine Essence Pill.

When Dustless saw Ye Yuan’s comprehension speed, he could not help being dumbfounded.

He followed Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove and commanded the wind and clouds in the Heavenspan World for aeons. The geniuses that he had seen were numerous like schools of carps crossing the river.

But he had never seen before someone’s comprehension ability capable of reaching Ye Yuan’s level.

Ye Yuan’s alchemy talent could be described using frightening!

“Drawing parallels from inference! This kid’s comprehension strength is simply inconceivable. Other people would spend even more time learning other medicinal pills after the Divine Essence Pill. But this boy actually became faster and faster! The Divine Essence Pill opened up the gates of divine pills for him. Now, he has already stepped onto a broad path, his future limitless! Given time, this boy’s accomplishments in alchemy might not be incapable of surpassing Immortal Grove!” Dustless sighed emotionally.
