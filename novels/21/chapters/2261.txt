Chapter 2265: Who was More Lowly?

Ye Yuan and Li-er had always marched forward hand-in-hand, and he naturally knew her background.

He completely did not believe that Li-er was part of the divine race.

She was clearly a human. So how could she possibly become a Divine Daughter of the divine race?

But Rong Xiyue’s words completely subverted Ye Yuan’s understanding!

“Soul and flesh fusing into one? Could it be soul and flesh fusing into one?” Ye Yuan suddenly thought of something and gritted his teeth and said.

“That’s right, a distinguishing trait of the divine race is soul and flesh unification! But the compatibility of soul and flesh unification is different, the physique will be different too, and the cultivation potential will also be different. The higher the compatibility, the more one can get Heavenly Dao’s recognition, and the faster the cultivation speed too. The divine race doesn’t cultivate the world. We only cultivate Heavenly Dao! C-Cough!” Rong Xiyue said.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan suddenly erupted, choking Rong Xiyue’s neck firmly.

An unrestrained killing intent instantly burst forth.

“What dogshit divine race! You all are merely humans too! It’s just that the cultivation method you cultivate is different! Having a high and mighty appearance all day long, do you think that you’re very impressive? If I want to kill you, it’s the same as killing a dog!”

“C-Cough, cough ... Let ... Let go of me!”

Ye Yuan’s two eyes were blood-red. A berserk killing intent pressured Rong Xiyue until she was virtually unable to breathe.

She did not understand why Ye Yuan would suddenly become like this.

A berserk killing intent billowed to the sky, alarming the powerhouses in the small world very quickly.

In a blink of an eye, more than a dozen powerful auras appeared at the entrance area. They were shockingly all Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm divine race powerhouses.

When everyone saw a human actually clutching the neck of Divine Daughter, with a murderous look, they could not help being alarmed and furious.

A divine race powerhouse said in a chilly voice, “Insolence! A lowly human dares to act atrociously on my divine race’s territory? Quickly let go of Her Highness Divine Daughter! Otherwise, I’ll make you die without a burial ground!”

One powerful aura after another locked onto Ye Yuan firmly. As long as he acted rashly without careful consideration, they would immediately kill Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan suddenly turned his head and stared fiercely at that Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse.

That was just an initial-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm, his strength similar to Uncle Song.

“Lowly human? Huhu! Divine race’s major power, let this Ye take a look at how much capability you have, to dare talk wildly like so!”

Ye Yuan did not say another word, over a thousand flying swords instantly came out, rushing over towards that divine race powerhouse.

In virtually an instant, that divine race powerhouse was swept into the sword formation.

Rumble!

Rumble!

Rumble!

Ye Yuan controlled the flying swords, transforming them into a sword rain that filled the entire sky, rending apart frantically.

When the other divine race powerhouses saw this scene, each and every one of them was wildly in shock.

An Empyrean Realm human actually fought with the divine race’s Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses until neither could gain the upper hand!

“What a powerful sword formation! What thick divine essence! Such astonishing soul force!”

“There is still such a powerful existence among humans?”

“How is it possible? Our divine race is the supreme race among the Heavenspan World’s myriad races! How can a lowly human possibly be so strong?”

... ...

Ye Yuan’s realm was naturally beneath their notice.

But the combat power that Ye Yuan exhibited made them all draw cold breaths.

If Ye Yuan was in the same realm as them, killing them would merely be a matter of raising a hand!

No, no need to be in the same realm.

Even if it was a realm lower, they also did not dare say that they could be Ye Yuan’s match.

The strength that Ye Yuan displayed was this formidable!

Powerful until it made these divine race powerhouses endlessly terrified too!

Suddenly, the few of them exchanged a look, all revealing a hint of killing intent.

But at this time, Rong Xiyue finally caught her breath and hurriedly yelled, “Clan elders, you mustn’t kill him!”

A late-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerful existence frowned and said, “Your Highness Divine Daughter, what happened? Why did you bring a human to the False Divine World?”

Rong Xiyue bit her lips lightly and said with a bitter smile, “Uncle Ming, he’s called Ye Yuan. He’s a human Alchemy Dao powerhouse. I originally set up a trap, wanting to solicit him. Who knew that he actually captured me alive under the pincer attacks of Uncle Song and three human Heavenly Emperors! Now, I’m inflicted with his poison and can only be at his whims.”

“What?!”

Those divine race powerhouses all cried out in surprise, their faces not daring to believe it.

Uncle Ming said in shock, “Four rank eight powerhouses! There’s even a divine race among them! H-How did he do it?”

Heavenly Emperors were invincible. This was not just common knowledge in the human world. It was similarly the common view of the divine race.

It was impossible for Seven-marks Heavenly Dao Realm to defeat Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm, even if it was a Divine Son or Divine Daughter, it would not work either.

Ye Yuan rivaling an Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm was already sufficiently shocking.

But Rong Xiyue said that he captured Rong Xiyue alive under the pincer attacks of four great Heavenly Emperors.

This battle achievement was seriously too astonishing.

At this time, an old figure slowly walked out.

Rong Xiyue’s expression changed, and she bowed down, “Xiyue admits her error and asks Third Elder Ru Feng for punishment!”

This old person was the rank third powerhouse among the Hidden Clan’s nine elders!

“Your Highness Divine Daughter, you were ... too reckless this time!” Ru Feng said.

Rong Xiyue nodded slightly and said, “Yes, Xiyue will ask for punishment from Head Elder!”

But Ru Feng’s gaze looked toward Ye Yuan, his gaze radiating a brilliant light.

Clearly, this human’s power greatly exceeded his understanding.

Ye Yuan’s battle with the divine race powerhouse, the scales were already gradually leaning toward Ye Yuan’s side.

Under the frenzied attacks of Ye Yuan’s sword formation, the other party’s strength was already somewhat faltering, defeat or even being killed was something inevitable.

In the battle with Uncle Song previously, Ye Yuan’s sword formation only wanted to trap him, and he did not deploy full strength.

Furthermore, at that time, Ye Yuan was multi-tasking, and he also had a large amount of energy held up. It was naturally impossible to go all out.

But even so, Uncle Song was still injured.

But now, under Ye Yuan’s sullen anger, his combat strength was fearsome to the extreme, completely unleashing the power of the Thousand Absolute Extinction Sword Formation without holding back in the slightest. How astonishing was the power? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ru Feng’s brows furrowed slightly and he said in a clear voice, “Young Friend, please stop, we can talk things through.”

Ye Yuan completely ignored him. Instead, his mind stirred and the power of the sword formation became even stronger.

Ru Feng gave a cold snort, pointed a finger out, Dao marks flashed.

A terrifying power assaulted Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was currently going crazy when suddenly, alarm bells went off, and he hurriedly urged the sword formation to block.

A myriad sword lights coiled around before barely managing to block this burst of power.

It was also Ru Feng who did not dare to overly offend Ye Yuan. Otherwise, his one strike, Ye Yuan would die without a doubt.

The sword formation dispelled. The pressure on that divine race powerhouse eased up and intense pain came from his body.

At this time, the clothing on his body was long already shredded into ribbons by the sword lights.

He was covered in bleeding wounds from head to toe.

Although it was not fatal, the injuries were not light either.

Realising Ru Feng was there, that divine race powerhouse could not help turning red.

He, an exalted divine race’s Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses, actually lost to a human Empyrean Realm martial artist.

This matter would probably become a standing joke in the clan.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a sneer, “Divine race’s powerhouse, you’re a major realm higher than me, but you can’t even beat me, this lowly human. If I am so, then what are you considered then?”

That divine race powerhouse wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into. Ye Yuan’s words were really too sarcastic.
