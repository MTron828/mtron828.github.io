Chapter 2672: Giving Pointers

This group of geniuses was all stubborn and unruly people. If there was really a justifiable reason to eliminate them, then forget it.

Yet, Ye Yuan picked a bunch of fellows who were not outstanding, and he eliminated all of these outstanding ones instead. How could they be willing to agree?”

Even Song Minzhe themselves also had blank faces, making neither head nor tail of it.

In reality, they also agreed with Song Wenhao’s point of view in their hearts, thinking that Ye Yuan was intentionally making fun of these noble families.

Otherwise, how could they, these characters who were accompanying the crown prince to study, possibly be chosen?

Ye Yuan had clearly long anticipated these people’s reactions and said indifferently, “This hall master naturally knows that you guys are not convinced. However, this hall master will make you all convinced! Starting from today onward, all of you can come here every day too, and receive my guidance and cultivate according to my requirements. Three months later, you guys will undergo a showdown. If you all can win and slap this hall master’s face, this hall master naturally welcomes you to stay!”

Song Wenhao’s gaze turned sharp, and he said with a sneer, “Third Hall Master, this is what you said! I, Song Wenhao, am definitely slapping this face!”

“Third Hall Master, I hope that you don’t go back on your word!”

“Dueling with this bunch of trash, this young master can win them lying down!”

… …

What could change in three months?

Moreover, they were even able to receive the same guidance!

With their talent, they would only pull further and further away from those trash. How could they possibly be surpassed?

Ye Yuan just smiled and said, “You all rest assured. This hall master is naturally a man of his word. When the time comes, not only will you guys stay, this hall master will even apologize to you guys!”

Song Wenhao smiled coldly and said, “Then what are we still waiting for? Let’s start!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “The first lesson that I’m teaching you all is cultivating grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to the realm of upper ninth grade! Now, let’s start!”

“What? Grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill? Third Hall Master, you aren’t joking, right? Grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, what’s there to cultivate?” Song Wenhao was taken aback and immediately questioned.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You just need to do it, why are there so many questions? If you don’t want to, you can leave right now!”

Song Wenhao’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice,?“Humph!?Isn’t it just upper ninth grade? This young master has already reached middle ninth grade. Isn’t it half a step away from upper ninth grade?”

Hence, the group of geniuses started practicing by themselves.

They did not feel that grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill had any use, but they could only follow accordingly.

In Song Wenhao’s view, with his talent and strength, reaching upper ninth grade would just be easily achieved.

But he was wrong!

Before upper ninth grade, it could be achieved by relying on talent.

However, upper ninth grade required hard work plus talent.

He tried ten times and failed.

100 times and still failed.

Hence, he started getting irritated and impatient!

But, the more so, the more he could not refine an upper ninth grade.

In fact, the quality even showed regression.

“What the bloody hell! Your Father has refined for half a month. What’s the use of spending time on this kind of meaningless thing every day?” Song Wenhao knocked all the things on the table off with a smack as he said impatiently.

In reality, it was not just him who felt annoyed and impatient.

Those few people that Ye Yuan pointed out would more or less appear somewhat agitated and restless.

In their view, being able to reach ninth grade was already enough.

Wasting time on this kind of meaningless thing was not worth it at all.

Their refinement was also intermittent and half-hearted.

Low-level basic heavenly pills were worthless in their eyes.

However, most of Ye Yuan’s attention was on Song Minzhe.

This boy’s temperament was level-headed. He treated each pill refinement very seriously and never rested too.

A person should not underestimate this point. To a heavenly alchemist, it was a tremendous consumption of energy and willpower.

Without the support of strong willpower, it was simply impossible to do it.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan perceived from him practicing the fire controlling technique previously that his foundation was very solid.

The disparity between Song Minzhe and Song Wenhao was actually just affinity!

In terms of affinity, Song Wenhao shook Song Minzhe off by several streets.

But in terms of perseverance, in terms of foundation, in terms of temperament, Song Minzhe shook Song Wenhao off by more than a dozen streets!

However, in Ye Yuan’s view, the latter was the prerequisite to becoming a powerful heavenly alchemist.

Therefore, he was very optimistic about Song Minzhe.

Song Minzhe had clearly realized it too. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him.

Therefore, he was pushing himself frantically.

Song Minzhe’s talent was poor, which was also just relative to Song Wenhao.

Actually, Song Minzhe’s foundation was very solid.

His grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill already reached peak eighth grade too. There was only a step away from ninth grade as well.

And a short half a month later, he finally crossed ninth grade, this threshold, as well!

In reality, in this half a month, Ye Yuan had been continuously giving guidance to the geniuses present too.

Including the Song Wenhao that he looked down upon the most!

But, with regards to the refining technique of the grade one Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, these so-called geniuses would not take it in at all.

Instead, it was this bunch of so-called trash who accepted it unconditionally.

In this half a month, each of them made tremendous improvements.

Of course, this bit of improvement was utterly not worth mentioning in the view of Song Wenhao and the rest.

Seeing Song Wenhao flew off the handle, Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Pick it up!”

Song Wenhao said with a cold snort, “Based on what? Third Hall Master, you’re clearly targeting us! What’s there to refine about the lousy Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp and he said in a cold voice, “This hall master will say it again; pick it up for me!”

A powerful aura pressured Song Wenhao until his expression changed abruptly.

Similarly being a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, the feeling that Ye Yuan gave him was actually like that of a ferocious beast.

Too terrifying!

“I … I’ll pick it up!”

After Song Wenhao picked it up, Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “Get lost!”

Song Wenhao’s expression changed and he said in a solemn voice, “What … What did you say?”

Ye Yuan snorted coldly and said, “You don’t deserve to be here! Right now, immediately, at once, get lost!”

In Ye Yuan’s view, with this kind of temperament, it was simply impossible to have any accomplishments in alchemy.

What could high affinity show?

Moreover, affinity in itself could be changed!

Song Wenhao’s gaze turned cold and he said in a solemn voice, “Third Hall Master, I think that you’re forcing our Song Family to break away from Heavenly South Pill Hall!”

Ye Yuan said disdainfully, “Just the likes of you can decide the direction of the Song Family too? If you’re still not scramming, this hall master will send you out personally!”

Song Wenhao’s eyes were spewing fire and he shouted coldly, “I’ll go then. Either way, it’s useless to stay here too! Two and a half months later, I, Song Wenhao, will definitely make you apologize to my face! You think that by relying on this bunch of trash, you can win against me?”

Finished talking, Song Wenhao turned right around and left.

In the pill refining room, it was silent. There was only the sound of flames bursting forth.

Song Minzhe and the rest were still immersed in pill refining at this time and were completely oblivious to what was happening here.

To Ye Yuan, this was merely a small interlude.

Song Wenhao was nothing more than a clown jumping around, falling short of Ye Yuan’s standard.

Time flew by quickly. Three months’s period ended very soon. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

On this day, the various noble families’ patriarchs arrived one after another.

After Song Wenhao went out, Ye Yuan’s criteria for selecting people also immediately shocked all of the noble families.

Today, they naturally had to come and take a look as well.
