Chapter 1923: Bai Tong

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’m unlucky? You still haven’t figured out the situation now, right?”

Likewise, Qin Guan used an expression like looking at an idiot to look at Ye Yuan.

Could it be that this punk was a fool?

A mere Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity actually dared to utter such wild ravings.

No matter what, he was a True God Realm powerhouse too, could it be that he did not know the disparity between Celestial Deity Realm and True God Realm?

“The one who hasn’t figured out the situation is yourself!” Ye Yuan responded with a sneer.

Suddenly, an even more powerful undulation reverberated inside the courtyard, directly pushing Qin Guan’s world power back.

“Puhwark!”

Qin Guan was caught by surprise and directly sent flying by this tremendous force, spewing out a large mouthful of blood.

Beside Ye Yuan, a youth in fluttering white clothing appeared since no idea when.

Qin Guan’s gaze revealed a look of astonishment as he cried out in shock, “F-Fourth Firmament True God!”

At this time, Ye Yuan also sized up this young man with vermilion lips and white teeth beside him curiously. He was truly beautiful until even girls would be jealous.

Ye Yuan did not expect that after Tong’er grew up, he would actually be this appearance.

Detecting Ye Yuan’s gaze, Tong’er could not help rolling his eyes as he said unhappily, “What’s there to look at?”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “I even thought that you’d become an old geezer. I didn’t expect that you’re going to have this appearance! Tsk tsk, looks not bad.”

Spending a long time with Tong’er, even though he knew that he was an Empyrean powerhouse, that childish appearance made people unable to give rise to awe and veneration toward him at all.

Now, suddenly becoming a young man, Ye Yuan’s mentality similarly could not wrap itself around it.

Tong’er’s expression flickered incessantly, and he said in a cold voice, “In the future, you have to call me Lord Bai Tong! Otherwise, hmph hmph!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said with a smile, “Pfft, Lord ... Bai Tong? I ... I really can’t get used to it in this short while.”

Bai Tong rolled his eyes again, he discovered that he could not awe this guy at all.

However, him being able to recover to his current appearance was also all thanks to Ye Yuan.

“Forget it, just call me Brother Bai then! This time, it’s really all thanks to you. The recovery is much better than I imagined. Furthermore, thanks to you, when I return to boyhood from old age again in the future, I’ll directly recover to my current realm and don’t need to become that appearance before again.” Bai Tong said with some excitement.

His initial-most mental preparation was recovering to First Firmament True God.

After all, this medicinal pill was too difficult to refine.

But who knew that Ye Yuan actually refined vast spirit divine-grade in the end, the effects of recovery naturally far exceeded his expectations.

Fourth Firmament True God, middle-stage True God, that strength was a totally different level compared to First Firmament True God.

More importantly, what Ye Yuan refined was a vast spirit Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill. It restored part of the defects in his cultivation method, letting him have no need to become a kid without the strength to truss up a chicken when he returned to boyhood from old age again.

About the medicinal effect of the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill, Ye Yuan was also quite surprised.

The person who could create such a heaven-defying medicinal pill, his strength was definitely impressive.

It seemed like tigers were crouching and dragons were hiding in this world; one really should not look down on the heroes under the heavens!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Then I’ll have to congratulate Brother Bai, but ... let’s take care of this trash first.”

By the side, Qin Guan’s expression turned stiff. Kneeling down with a thud, he wailed, “Y-Your Excellency, this lowly one had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai and affronted Your Excellency! I ... I beg Your Excellency to take this lowly one to be a fart and let this lowly one go!”

Seeing the Bai Tong with an imposing aura, how could Qin Guan still have any desire to resist at all?

Having a First Firmament True God go deal with a Fourth Firmament True God?

Not unless his head was kicked by a donkey!

Apart from begging for mercy, he seriously could not think of other ways.

Currently, in his heart, he had long ‘greeted’ Jiang Hua’s 18 generations of ancestors.

This damn thing had clearly dug a pit for him to jump!

When taking action, Jiang Hua did not tell him that a Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse was actually following by Ye Yuan’s side!

“Let you go? If I didn’t have the strength to protect myself, would you have let me go today? Since you had the thought to kill people stirred, you’ll have to be prepared to be killed. Brother Bai, do it,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Toward this Qin Guan, Ye Yuan naturally could not give rise to any pity.

The other party was clearly here to kill Ye Yuan, and yet actually still hoped that Ye Yuan would show mercy and let him leave?

Bai Tong nodded slightly when he heard this. Qin Guan did not see him take any complicated action; he just lightly pointed out a finger.

Qin Guan only felt a white light gradually enlarge in his pupils.

After that, there was no more after that.

In front of Bai Tong, he could not even muster up divine essence.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s pupils also constricted as he said, “Brother Bai is skillful! I really didn’t expect that not only is Brother Bai a Seven-star Alchemy God, your martial arts are also so formidable.”

Bai Tong said with a proud look, “You don’t think that only you know spatial law in this world, right?”

The two exchanged a glance, both bursting into laughter.

...

“What did you say?! Qin Guan died? This ... How is this possible?” Hearing the news of Qin Guan’s death, Jiang Hua almost jumped up.

A True God Realm went to deal with a Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity Realm and actually died!

This kind of thing was simply unheard of.

“T-This lowly one dare not deceive Lord Steward! This lowly one quietly waited for the outcome in the backyard but didn’t see Lord Qin Guan return for a long time. Mustering up my courage, I went into the frontcourt and discovered that Lord Qin Guan had already long died.”

Ye Yuan was not someone who indiscriminately killed the innocent. That manservant was merely a Divine Lord Realm young man, obeying people’s orders. He naturally did not have the intention of exterminating once and for all.

But the frontcourt had an array formation isolating. So he did not know what happened in the backyard.

When he went to the frontcourt, it was long deserted already.

Jiang Hua’s expression changed again and again. In his eyes, although Ye Yuan’s strength was decent, he was merely a youngster who came from an imperial city in the end. So what background could he have?

To imperial city this level, True Gods were already existences that they looked up to. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But who knew that Qin Guan, this True God Realm powerhouse, would die in his own courtyard without a sound just like that.

One had to know, killing a True God Realm powerhouse and defeating a True God Realm powerhouse were two completely different concepts.

With Qin Guan’s strength, unless it was a Third Firmament True God and above powerhouse, otherwise, it was simply impossible to let him not even have a chance to escape.

After all, that was Qin Guan’s own territory!

“Could it be that a Third Firmament True God and above powerhouse is actually following by that brat’s side? This ... How is this possible?” Jiang Hua did not quite dare to believe it.

Right at this time, a servant walked in and said to Jiang Hua with cupped fists, “Steward Jiang, Ye Yuan’s party already entered the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion!”

Jiang Hua was taken back when he heard that and said, “Alchemy Celestial Pavilion? What did they go to the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion for? Right, this kid wanted to become famous overnight through the Alchemy Celestial Pavilion! Heh heh, no wonder he uttered wild ravings, saying to make Family Head go find him in person. It turns out that what he thought of was this method! It’s just that ... he’s too naive! Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s experts are as abundant as clouds. Does he, a mere Celestial Deity Realm brat, really think that he can stir up some waves?”
