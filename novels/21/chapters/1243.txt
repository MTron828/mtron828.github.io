Chapter 1247: Dragonlady Ao Jun

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Passing through a section of the dimly lit cave, Ye Yuan virtually used up all of his strength.

The more he walked toward the depths, the faster Ye Yuan’s heart beat. The heavier the cold intent on his body as well.

Following that intense psychological hint, Ye Yuan walked to the end of the cave.

Before his eyes were a deep and serene pool, unable to see the bottom with a glance.

The cold air emitting from the pool made Ye Yuan’s divine soul almost freeze.

That bone-piercing cold intent made Ye Yuan unable to refrain from shuddering.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, and he blurted out, “This is ... the aura of Eternity Frost!”

“That’s right, it’s precisely Eternity Frost! Looks like you completely inherited his mantle. Just based on this cold air, you pinpointed the Eternity Frost.”

A chilly female voice sounded out. It was precisely the voice that Ye Yuan heard outside.

The voice was very indifferent, but that tiny hint of trembling exposed some of the fluster in the other party’s heart.

The Eternity Frost was produced in the extreme northern lands. It was one of the top-grade medicinal materials to refine some water-attribute medicinal pills.

This thing was incomparably precious. Even a piece the size of a fingernail was worth several cities too.

The reason why it was called Eternity Frost was that even if burned with blazing flames, it would not thaw either.

Ordinary Dao Profound Realm martial artists would die upon contact!

Such a degree of coldness, the Eternity Frost in the depths of this pool was likely not little!

“You ... You are?” Ye Yuan swallowed his saliva and said.

The woman sighed despondently and said, “Yun-er, you grew up.”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled. Hearing this sigh, Ye Yuan even had an impulse to hug the other party.

“Could it be that ... you are ... you are ...”

Ye Yuan’s breathing became ragged. Actually, he had a hint of speculation in his heart long ago. But when it really came to the point of verification, he became flustered again.

He was worried, worried that the other party would deny, worried that his joy would come to naught.

In his cognition, there had never been ‘mother,’ this word.

In over 500 years of his past life, Ye Yuan and his father had always mutually depended on each other through thick and thin.

All the way until this life, when he opened his eyes and saw Ren Hongling, that was when Ye Yuan felt maternal love.

It was just that Ye Yuan knew that that love was not his, but that ‘Ye Yuan’ who had long died already.

He was just enjoying that motherly love on behalf of ‘Ye Yuan.’

He was still Ji Qingyun in the end!

“That’s right, I’m your mother,” Ao Jun’s voice sounded out faintly.

Hearing this answer, Ye Yuan’s emotions became incomparably complicated.

Joy, hesitation, doubt, anger, all sorts of emotions mixed together, making him feel like he was about to burst open.

He did not understand why his mother had never shown up in his life before.

And also did not understand why Father never mentioned Mother.

Far too many questions buried deep in his heart finally exploded at this instant, but the agitated from before was swept away clean.

“Why?!”

Thousands of words turned into this one word.

Ye Yuan did not know that this was the land of exile and did not know about Ao Jun’s past.

So when he knew that there was a mother, there was more of resentment!

Gurgle ...

Bubbles rose in the cold pool. With a whoosh, a dragon head rushed out of the pool, staring at Ye Yuan with a heated gaze.

Four eyes faced each other, one pair of eyes was filled with shock, while the other pair was tender love.

Ye Yuan understood the dragon race quite well. This azure dragon before his eyes looked old and doddering. Clearly, it was almost nearing its end.

Furthermore, the dragon race mostly maintained human form. Only when its demon essence was insufficient to maintain human form, would it reveal its original form.

This decrepit azure dragon before his eyes was his mother?

Counting in the 500 years of his past life, he was born for less than 600 years too.

600 years’ time, how could his mother be old to such a degree?

“Yun-er, it’s all Mother’s fault! Mother gave birth to you, but didn’t take care of you for a single day! But over these 500 years, Mother has been thinking about you every minute and second.”

Ao Jun’s voice had always been like an old well without ripples. But at this time, her voice trembled. On that pair of dragon eyes, tears actually faintly appeared.

In virtually an instant, Ao Jun’s aura withered considerably.

Ye Yuan could clearly sense that what little left of Ao Jun’s vitality actually faded away considerably all of a sudden!

This discovery involuntarily made Ye Yuan alarmed.

“This ... What’s going on here?” Ye Yuan said in great astonishment.

Although he could tell that the other party’s life force did not have much remaining, just a slight fluctuation in emotion made the vitality diminish so much at once?

Even if Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao was heaven-defying, he had never before seen such a situation.

Dragon tears fell down. Ao Jun said in relief, “It’s fine, for Mother to be able to see you again, even if I die right away, I’ll have no regrets too. Is your father ... well?”

“He ... He’s very well!”

Ye Yuan almost blurted out the truth. But suddenly recalling that Ao Jun did not seem to be able to suffer an emotional stimulus, he changed his words in the end.

At this time, Ao Jun’s emotions recovered to that ripple-less old well state again, and opened her mouth to say, “Could it be that ... your father encountered some trouble?”

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s pause just now made Ao Jun have a foreboding feeling.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Father dreamed too big, it’s just that he ran into some trouble in pill refinement. With his strength, something that could cause trouble for him in the Divine Realm hasn’t been born yet.”

Ao Jun thought about it and said, “That’s true.”

Ye Yuan glanced at Ao Jun and asked, “Can you tell me just ... what on earth is going on?”

Ao Jun sighed slightly and spoke about the curse of this land of exile.

Ye Yuan was unbelievably shocked while listening by the side. Only then did he understand why Mother would abandon him and Father.

He also finally understood why he would possess the Atavism Dragon Soul!

It turned out that his body was flowing with half of the dragon race’s bloodline!

“Mother, s-sorry!” Understanding the sequence of events, Ye Yuan could not resist choking.

“Silly child, the one who should apologize is Mother! Mother has never done her duty as a mother for a single day. These few years, you and your father have suffered,” Ao Jun comforted him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“That isn’t your fault! Mother, this cursed land, could it be that there’s no way to resolve it?”

Ao Jun shook her head and said, “Unless the progenitor revives, otherwise, it’s irresolvable! It’s just that after my dragon race’s progenitor, nobody else was able to reach his heights anymore. Moreover, now that this Divine Realm is missing Heavenly Dao, there’s no way to step foot into the Deity Realm at all. Even Ancestor is also suppressed at the Half-Deity Realm.”

But when Ye Yuan heard these words, his eyes lit up and said, “This child possesses the Atavism Dragon Soul! Isn’t it said that as long as one possesses the atavism dragon soul, they will be able to attain the progenitor’s heights? That as long as this child breaks through to Deity Realm, it will be possible to lift this curse?”

“What?! You ... You possess the Atavism Dragon Soul?”

Ao Jun’s shock was also by no means insignificant.

The Atavism Dragon Soul only existed in the dragon race’s memories. No one had never seen before, and it was also extremely hard to detect.

Because nobody had attained the Azure Dragon Progenitor’s heights before!

Hence, even Ao Jun, who gave birth to Ye Yuan, also did not know about the matter of Ye Yuan being in possession of the Atavism Dragon Soul.
