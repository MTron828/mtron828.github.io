Chapter 1734 Falling Into Bug Encirclemen

Upon entering Evil Water Ravine, a dark and damp scent hit head-on.

This place was densely covered in miasma, earth-fire exuberant, resulting in this dampness making people feel uncomfortable from head to toe.

“This damn place is simply a barren hill and turbulent waters. No wonder it’s called Evil Water Ravine! Your Father is really retarded, to actually following you all to this kind of place!” Luo Yong cursed.

“No one made you come! You yourself insisted on following!” Yu Jing rolled her eyes and said huffily.

The moment Luo Yong heard, he could not help laughing awkwardly and stopped speaking.

He still thickened his skin and followed after in the end.

After all, the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruit was very valuable. Even according to the terms negotiated previously, his harvest was also not small.

Otherwise, with his strength, why would he follow Boss Duan to this kind of place.

Duan Peng said, “The insects and bugs here are countless, impossible to guard against. Everybody be a little more careful.”

No need him to say, everyone already released their divine essence, protecting their bodies.

Yu Jing said rather nervously, “Can ... the method to save my brother really be found here?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Myriad things under the heaven, reinforce and counteract each other. Although the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug is powerful, there’s always something that restrains it.”

Duan Peng frowned and said, “This place is so big, so how to find it?”

“Yeah! If there’s really some antidote, would Master Song Yu not know? I’ve also heard of the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug before. It’s simply incurable!” Luo Yong said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “There are too many unknown things in this world. You don’t know, doesn’t mean there isn’t! Forget about Master Song Yu, even the Medicinal Ancestor, would he dare say that he knows all of the myriad life under the heavens?”

Luo Yong sneered when he heard that and said, “Messing around for so long, it means that you also don’t know what the antidote is? You hoodwinked everyone to come together, but didn’t even have a clue, truly laughable!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This ‘everyone’ doesn’t include you. You insisted on following by yourself.”

Luo Yong choked and was just about to fly off the handle, but then he heard Duan Peng saying, “Alright, old Luo, don’t keep on making things difficult for Ye Yuan. Already came, so Ye Yuan, what should we do now?”

Ye Yuan was clearly long prepared and blurted out, “Of course it’s finding the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug first! This thing is very formidable and should be perched at the place where it’s the most humid and the earth-fire most vigorous! We’ll just have to head toward this kind of place to look for it.”

Firecloud Ice Edge Bug, Ye Yuan had never seen before either. This knowledge was all inherited from Dustless.

As for the method to resolve the poison, even Immortal Grove did not know as well.

However, this could not stump Ye Yuan.

When at the Immortal Grove World, he frequently liked to go and crack strange poisons that no one could resolve. He had his own set of methods.

Even though the Heavenspan World was different from the Immortal Grove World, the principle was interlinked.

The party headed toward the place where earth-fire was the most vigorous. But along the way, it could not avoid tangling with some poisonous things.

But this party was strong and did not expend much effort.

Looking as the earth-fire got more and more vigorous, the humidity also getting heavier and heavier, everyone actually had a feeling that even breathing became hindered.

Duan Peng frowned and said, “This place is too weird. These miasma, dampness, and earth-fire gas, is actually able to corrode divine essence. At this rate, I also can’t persevere long.”

Even Duan Peng, this peak Sixth Firmament Divine Lord existence, could not quite hold on anymore, let alone the others.

Yu Jing’s complexion was very pale, forehead sweating profusely. Clearly, she already could not quite hold on anymore.

Ye Yuan, on the other hand, his chaos divine essence was incomparably sturdy and did not fear these gases’ erosion.

His state was instead the best among the six people.

“Reckon that it shouldn’t be far away, the earth-fire gas and humidity here are already very—Careful!”

Ye Yuan was just speaking when he suddenly pulled Yu Jing into his embrace and stabbed a sword out with a backhand, movements swift to the extreme!

Everyone did not understand what happened. Turning around to look, they saw that on the tip of Ye Yuan’s sword, a milky-white bug was pierced on it. Their expressions changed drastically.

Duan Peng’s expression changed and he said, “This bug is so formidable, quietly approaching so close and we actually didn’t detect it! Hang on, could this be ...”

Ye Yuan slowly nodded and said, “That’s right, this is it!”

In the team, someone suddenly exclaimed, “Not good, you guys, look!”

Everyone turned around to look and discovered that the surroundings were crawling densely full of bugs, blotting out the sky and covering the earth, even on the trees.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces revealed a look of despair.

Duan Peng’s complexion turned pale as he said, “Damn it, we entered the lair of the Firecloud Ice Edge Bugs! With this, it’s hard to escape even if we grow wings!”

Luo Yong said fiercely, “Ye Yuan, it’s all you! If not for you, we also wouldn’t be at our wits’ end now!”

Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at him and said, “Stop shouting and wrangling. Even if I did it on purpose, can you still escape currently?”

Luo Yong choked, immediately feeling incomparably aggrieved.

Yeah, this current sort of situation, even if he killed Ye Yuan, it could not change any outcome either.

Yu Jing’s complexion also turned white and she said, “Ye Yuan, s-sorry, it was all Elder Sister Jing who harmed you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “All putting on a dead person’s face for what? It’s not over yet. Want to grumble, wait until we go out before grumbling.”

Luo Yong said furiously, “Go out? It has already reached this point, but you’re still making wisecracks! These bugs are all rank four fierce beasts. Now, all of the paths are blocked. So how to get out?”

Ye Yuan ignored him and said calmly, “I’ll bring you all out. All don’t resist, continue to go in! This place isn’t the place where earth-fire is most vigorous, the thing that can resolve the poison should be inside!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan released his divine essence and wrapped the other five people inside, directly ripping apart space and passing through the insect swarm!

When everyone saw that they broke out of the insect swarm all of a sudden, each and every one of them was shocked until the shock could not be greater.

“Spatial law! Brother Ye really kept to your own counsel!” Duan Peng cried out in shock.

Luo Yong also had a look of astonishment. He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually comprehended such a terrifying power of law.

But Ye Yuan waved his hand dismissively and said, “Let’s continue escaping toward the inside, but don’t shake off the bug swarm. Let them chase after!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The distance that Ye Yuan shuttled through space was not very far. At this time, those bugs seemed to be very angry, all flying over toward this side.

Everyone immediately felt their scalps tingle, scampering away.

Ye Yuan chuckled and fired out several sword lights with a backhand, directly slaughtering a swarm.

With this, those bugs became even more berserk, flying over toward Ye Yuan in a fierce fighting mood one after another.

Ye Yuan grinned and sped away, catching up to Yu Jing who fell behind to the back very quickly.

As Yu Jing flew, she said gratefully, “Ye Yuan, I ... I really don’t know how I should thank you!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Want to thank, wait until after finding the antidote before talking. Right now, I don’t have any confidence at all!”

The moment Yu Jing heard this, somewhat worrying about personal gains and losses, she said, “Can we ... find the antidote?”

Ye Yuan said, “Relax, no matter how powerful the poisonous object, within a circumference of 100 miles, one can definitely find the thing that restrains it!”
