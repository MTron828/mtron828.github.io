Chapter 1682 Angrily Condemning the Ning Family“s Elders

The Ning Family at the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

These several decades, the Ning Family’s pressure was very great.

The Ning Family’s number one genius, Ning Tianping, actually disappeared into thin air. This was too great a loss to the Ning Family.

However, the Ning Family’s people were not fools. Ye Yuan had just left and Ning Tianping disappeared, ten to one that he followed Ye Yuan and left.

It was just that, Ye Yuan said that he wanted to go out and venture, finding the opportunity to break through. Nobody knew when this opportunity would appear, or what kind of dangers he would encounter outside?

The uncertainty was too great!

One had to know, when geniuses trained alone outside, the chances of dying were too high.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, there were quite a number of genius disciples who died outside each year.

Some of them were even Divine Lord Realm protectors, even deacons.

If Ning Tianping and Ye Yuan died outside, that was simply a devastating blow to the Ning Family.

A genius like Ning Tianping could not be groomed randomly.

The Ning Family’s upper echelons already hated Ye Yuan to the core long ago.

It was fine that he left. But he actually abducted the Ning Family’s, even the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s, most prodigious junior away!

Over the years, Ning Zhiyuan seldom stayed in seclusion, devoting considerable effort into the grooming of young disciples.

Ning Tianping and Ye Yuan going out, Ning Zhiyuan was equivalent to being a cripple, unable to help at all.

Honestly speaking, Ning Zhiyuan was really not optimistic that Ning Tianping could return alive.

Even though the matter had already passed for several decades, the moment Ning Zhiyuan thought of Ning Tianping, he still felt very dejected.

On this day, someone from below suddenly came in to report that Ning Tianping came back!

Ning Zhiyuan’s entire body trembled, suddenly getting up, figure directly disappearing from where he was.

Inside the Ning Family’s main hall, quite a number of elders had astonished faces, looking at that young man currently in the main hall. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In a short few decades’ time, Ning Tianping’s realm actually broke through once more, directly becoming a middle-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouse!

This kind of cultivation speed could be rated as terrifying.

“Could it be that this kid had some lucky encounter outside again?”

“Is it possible that he went out himself to train? Disappearing with that good-for-nothing was merely a coincidence?”

“There’s really the possibility! Going out with an Origin Deity Realm trash, what lucky chance can there be? Not being dragged to death is already pretty good.”

...

The clan elders discussed in low voices, directly separating Ning Tianping and Ye Yuan.

Among Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s upper echelons, Ye Yuan already became a laughingstock.

Earth-shaking when being at the Origin Deity Realm before. But such a genius actually could not even break through to the Divine Lord Realm.

Ning Tianping’s brows furrowed. He was just about to fly off the handle when a figure arrived with a howl. It was precisely Ning Zhiyuan!

Ning Zhiyuan originally came ablaze with anger. But seeing that Ning Tianping actually broke through his realm, the anger on his face immediately dissipated considerably.

Ning Tianping also endured his anger and bowed to Ning Zhiyuan and said, “Tianping pays respect to Family Head!”

Even though Ning Zhiyuan already forgave Ning Tianping, in order to demonstrate the prestige of the family head, he still snorted coldly and said, “Humph! Leaving without saying goodbye, do you still have any respect for me, this family head, in your eyes?”

Actually, before Ning Tianping left, he was somewhat unhappy with Ning Zhiyuan.

The matter during the elders meeting, what Ning Zhiyuan did was unvirtuous.

But in all fairness, Ning Zhiyuan’s grooming of him was without sparing any effort. He really did not have much to say, so he used this method of leaving without saying goodbye. It was also considered declaring his dissatisfaction.

Regarding Ning Zhiyuan’s wrath, Ning Tianping accepted it calmly and said respectfully, “Tianping dares not!”

Ning Zhiyuan snorted coldly again and said, “Already done it, what’s there that you dare not? But forget it, I previously even thought that you left with Ye Yuan that good-for-nothing, so I was very worried. Looking at it now, you had another fortuitous encounter! To be able to break through to the middle-stage Divine Lord Realm within several decades, you’re also considered to have rendered merit for the Ning Family. Count it as making amendments for your wrongdoing in view of your accomplishments then!”

Ning Tianping could still accept it with an open mind at the beginning. But upon hearing Ning Zhiyuan call Ye Yuan a good-for-nothing, he immediately exploded.

He suddenly stood up, giving the surrounding people a scare.

“Tianping is extremely respectful toward Family Head in my heart, but the respect toward His Excellency is akin to beholding a great mountain! Family Head, I hope that you take back your words just now! His Excellency isn’t a good-for-nothing. He’s an unparalleled genius! Otherwise, you’ll feel regret for the words you said today!” Ning Tianping’s words sounded very cold.

Ning Zhiyuan was rendered dumbfounded by Ning Tianping’s attitude. His understanding of Ning Tianping had always been that he was very obedient and sensible, and also very respectful towards him.

But today, for a Ye Yuan, he fell out with him!

Ning Zhiyuan’s expression turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Regret? A good-for-nothing who can’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm is also considered an unparalleled genius? Ning Tianping, you’re very good! For the sake of a trash, you actually dare to rebuke me?”

The moment those clan elders heard, they also flew into a great rage and started condemning Ning Tianping.

“Tianping, you went out for a trip and your wings became hard huh! To actually dare be so rude to the family head!”

“Really getting out of hand! Do you think that breaking through to become a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord, you can disregard the family head?”

“For a good-for-nothing, you actually dared to be insolent to the family head, truly preposterous and should be punished by family laws!”

...

Listening to these people clamor by his ears, Ning Tianping finally erupted.

He was respectful toward Ning Zhiyuan, but it did not mean that he also respected these people.

These old things, apart from normally telling people what to do and coming up with lousy ideas, they did not do proper business at all.

Putting it bluntly, it was a bunch of old fellows who were sitting around doing nothing and waiting to die.

Ning Tianping said in a great rage, “All of you shut up for me! Good-for-nothing? Can’t break through to the Divine Lord Realm? Talking bullshit here, you guys don’t ask His Excellency for pills in the future if you have the capabilities! Let me tell you guys, His Excellency is already very disappointed toward the Ning Family. Are you fools going to push the Ning Family into an abyss beyond redemption?”

The moment one of the extremely senior clan elders heard, he immediately exploded, pointing at Ning Tianping and scolding angrily: “L-Little bastard, you dare to speak to us like this? Rebelling! Rebelling! Family Head, you take a look, this little bastard went out for a trip and really became lawless and unbridled! That trash can’t even break through to the Divine Lord Realm! Could it be that this old man still needs to go and beg him for pills?”

However, Ning Zhiyuan ignored him, but looked at Ning Tianping and asked with a suspicious look, “Tianping, what’s the ... meaning of your words?”

Ning Tianping smiled coldly and said, “What meaning? Not only did His Excellency broke through to the Divine Lord Realm, but his growth in these several decades is also beyond your imaginations! Family Head, Tianping isn’t showing disregard for my elders. It’s really that I feel heartache and headache! If back then, you fervently supported His Excellency back then during the elders meeting, right now absolutely won’t be this kind of situation! Our Ning Family would become Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s number one great clan! But now ... sigh!”

Ning Zhiyuan’s gaze turned intent and he said in shock, “What did you say? Ye Yuan he ... he really broke through? That’s impossible! Back then, he even consumed the Vastsun Universe Pill, but he didn’t even reach half-step Divine Lord Realm, how can he possibly broke through to the Divine Lord Realm?”

Ning Tianping gave Ning Zhiyuan a glance and could not resist sighing quietly.

Ning Zhiyuan was deeply pricked by Ning Tianping’s look as if a thorn pierced into his heart.
