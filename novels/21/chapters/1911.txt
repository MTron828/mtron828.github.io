Chapter 1915: Not Seeing

Xiao Feng opened his mouth and did not speak.

Ye Yuan’s words, he could not comprehend it.

Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital was an extremely famous city of medicinal pills within the human territories.

The reason was none other than Empyrean Flutterfeather was a Seven-star Alchemy God who had a resounding reputation.

Seven-star Alchemy God was already the limits of what ordinary people could understand.

Heavenly Emperor-class powerhouses, each one was very mysterious. Even Empyrean powerhouses found it hard to see their true face.

Eight-star Alchemy Gods were naturally more mysterious than Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

Reaching the boundary of Eight-star Alchemy God, it was hard to be moved by secular objects at all. Wanting to invite them to take action was simply nothing more than wishful thinking.

Only Heavenly Emperor-class powerhouses could entice them.

Hence, Empyrean Flutterfeather was naturally one of the Empyreans with exceedingly formidable Alchemy Dao strength in the eyes of the human martial artists.

With Ye Yuan’s current Alchemy Dao strength, it was already hard for ordinary alchemists to enter his sights.

Only Empyrean Flutterfeather, this level of super powerhouses, would he have the interest to have an exchange with.

These words naturally sounded incomparably conceited to others, but Tong’er by the side knew that Ye Yuan had this capital.

In a blink, it was another few years. Ye Yuan’s party crossed over countless city walls and finally arrived at Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital.

“My God, is this Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital made out of gold?”

Even if he had broadened his horizons greatly from following Ye Yuan, Ning Tianping was also dumbstruck with amazement by the scene before his eyes.

Using resplendent and magnificent to describe this enormous city was all too apt.

Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital was situated by the mountains. The city walls were all a stretch of golden color, looking like it was built using pure gold; extremely grand and imposing.

“Heh,

you’re also looking down on Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital too much! Each brick of this city wall is integrated with 50% Gilt Ironsand and reinforced with a rank seven grand array. Even an Empyrean powerhouse’s attack can forget about leaving a mark behind on the city wall,” Xiao Feng said.

Ning Tianping said in shock, “50% Gilt Ironsand! That’s a rank seven material, every little bit is worth a thousand gold! This city is so big, wouldn’t it empty out the entire Heavenspan World’s Gilt Ironsand?”

Xiao Feng smiled and said, “Myriad Treasure Tower is spread all over the Heavenspan World. The income every day, you can’t imagine it at all. This city is indeed extraordinary, but to Lord Heavenly Emperor, it’s merely a single hair from nine oxen.”

Hearing that, Ye Yuan was also incomparably shocked in his heart.

Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure could really be said to be the richest in the world!

“Halt! Do you all have customs clearance documents?” A guard at the city gate entrance immediately stopped them when he saw Ye Yuan and the rest.

When Xiao Feng saw the situation, he hurriedly bowed and said, “This brother, I’m a deacon under Springwind Hall. This is my token. These few are my Myriad Treasure Tower’s good friends and want to enter the city to discuss a deal with Springwind Hall. I hope that you can be accommodating.”

The present Xiao Feng was already a first-rate figure in Heavenly Eagle’s Myriad Treasure Tower. But arriving here, he had to even humble himself towards a guard.

The guard smiled disdainfully when he saw the token and said, “A mere low-level deacon also came to the great imperial capital to discuss business, you aren’t joking, right? Do you know what kind of big business Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital is doing every day? Hurry up and get lost, entering is also wasting the lords’ time!”

Xiao Feng looked toward Ye Yuan with a bitter smile, a helpless look on his face.

His identity was truly too low in a place like a great imperial capital, even the guards looked down on him.

Cities of a level did things at the same level. Those who came to great imperial capitals to talk business, which one wasn’t a wealthy tycoon of a region?

Even so, before they entered the city, they still had needed customs clearance documents before they could enter the city.

A measly imperial city’s Four-star Alchemy God, what kind of big business could he bring?

The powerhouses that the guard had seen before were too many to count, so he would not take Ye Yuan and the others, these Celestial Deity Realms, seriously at all.

Even though he himself was also just a Third Firmament Celestial Deity.

Ye Yuan smiled and scooted over to the guard’s side and said smilingly, “This brother, we really have business to discuss, I hope that you can be accommodating.”

He fished out a medicinal pill like performing a magic trick, putting it in front of the guard.

That guard’s gaze turned sharp, and he hurriedly put it away and waved his hand and said, “Hurry up and go inl don’t block the people behind.”

A purple spirit rank five divine pill, a small guard at his level could not afford to use it.

The medicinal pill that Ye Yuan gave him was sufficient for him to break through to Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity!

This kind of big gift, how could he not have the reason to let Ye Yuan go in?

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and brought everyone into the city.

“Younger Brother Ye, really sorry about it, I ...” Xiao Feng looked at Ye Yuan and said with an ashamed look.

He also did not expect that he could not even enter the city gates.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Xiao, you don’t need to be like this. If not for your token, even if I gave him medicinal pills, he also won’t dare to accept it.”

Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital was Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s headquarters; completely different from Heavenly Eagle’s Myriad Treasure Tower that depended on others for a living.

There were god knows how many major powers and great tycoons that came and went here every day.

If without the Myriad Treasure Tower’s middleman leading the way, these guards absolutely did not dare to easily let them enter. This was also the reason why Ye Yuan had to bring Xiao Feng along.

Ning Tianping said indignantly, “Really acting like snobs! After we’re done with this deal, need to let that punk take a look at how one cannot judge people by appearance!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This world talks using strength. Our strength is naturally top-rate when placed in Heavenly Eagle. But arriving at a great imperial capital, it’s nothing much anymore. The Empyrean powerhouses that that guard head just now had seen are likely not in the minority too. Why would he pay attention to the few of us Celestial Deity Realms?”

Ning Tianping naturally knew this logic, but he was still very irate and said, “Humph! A rank five divine pill, just take it as having fed a dog!”

The party entered the city and headed straight for the most prosperous region.

After passing through many places, the few people arrived in front of a mansion.

Xiao Feng showed the token and invitation to the guard and said respectfully, “This lowly one is Springwind Hall’s low-level deacon, Xiao Feng. My master is Rivercalm Imperial Capital’s high-level Five-star Alchemy God, Lu Zhe. This is Master’s handwritten greeting, hope that I can request an audience with Elder Jiang Yuan!”

When that guard heard Xiao Feng introduce his background, he had a disdainful look on his face. After looking at the greeting card, he waved his hand and said, “Go to the gatehouse over there and wait.”

Xiao Feng’s heart eased up, he was afraid that this guard directly chased people away.

Rivercalm Imperial Capital was an imperial capital under Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital’s command. Xiao Feng’s master, Lu Zhe, had some status in Rivercalm Imperial Capital.

Of course, arriving at a great imperial capital, it was still not enough to look at.

This Jiang Yuan was Springwind Hall’s elder, a True God Realm powerhouse, his status in Myriad Treasure Tower quite high.

Before Xiao Feng came here, he requested for this greeting card from his master.

It was just that whether people gave face or not, he had no confidence in his heart at all.

Arriving at the gatehouse, the few people were immediately stunned.

Inside the gatehouse was long already packed full of people. Furthermore, each and every one of them, their strengths were not ordinary.

A servant issued Xiao Feng a number plate and said in an ordering tone, “This is your number, hold it properly. When your number is called, then go in.”

It could be seen that this Elder Jiang Yuan’s status was rather high. Clearly, the people who came to find him for business were a lot.

The few people did not expect that their wait lasted seven days and seven nights.

After seven days, their number plate was finally called.

The servant led them into a house. Inside the house was a steward-looking middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man said coolly, “Bring up your greeting card.”

Xiao Feng hurriedly handed it up. The middle-aged man swept a glance, threw it back again, and said coolly, “You all leave. The family head is very busy and isn’t free to see you all.”
