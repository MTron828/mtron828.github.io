Chapter 1291: Out of My League

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Dustless finally knew why Ye Yuan could trigger the Heavenly Dao with Alchemy Dao, and from there, obtain the Immortal Grove Heavenly Dao’s recognition.

This nuttiness really made him collapse!

If to say alchemists were all lunatics, then Ye Yuan was the lunatic among lunatics!

Ye Yuan used two hours’ time, turning the Profound Essence Pill inside out before he was finally satisfied.

However, only then did Ye Yuan know that with his current strength, he could not refine the Profound Essence Pill at all.

Furthermore, he completely had no understanding of divine rank spirit medicines’ medicinal properties. Even if one really placed the spirit medicines in front of him, he could not possibly refine it either.

The current Ye Yuan was a complete and utter alchemy path newbie!

Finally, Dustless said huffily, “You’d best hurry up and refine the Profound Essence Pill! At this rate, you’ll be a cripple in the future!”

Only then did Ye Yuan come back to his senses and discovered that Dustless’s words were right.

With his current body condition, if he did not quickly refine the medicinal pill, he might really be a cripple in the future.

However, Ye Yuan discovered to his dismay that his body completely did not have divine essence, and was unable to quickly refine the medicinal pills at all.

Fortunately, he regained consciousness and was able to guide his fleshy body to draw on the power of the medicinal pill.

Although the recovery speed this way was a little slow, it was much faster than absorbing unconsciously.

This Profound Essence Pill was indeed worthy of being a high-grade tier 1 divine pill. The medicinal effects were indeed powerful.

After half a day, Ye Yuan’s fingers finally moved slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes.

What came into view was a delicate and beautiful young maiden. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Liang Wanru was currently looking at Ye Yuan. Seeing Ye Yuan wake up, a hint of surprise flickered across her eyes too.

“Was ... was it you who saved me?”

Opening the mouth to speak was different from communicating with divine sense. Ye Yuan discovered that he found it difficult to even speak, his throat smoldering.

Liang Wanru hurriedly went to get some water. Ye Yuan directly drank a large flask of water before feeling slightly better.

“Was it you who saved me?” Ye Yuan asked again.

Liang Wanru nodded her head.

Ye Yuan was stunned, only then, recalling that the other party was mute.

Liang Wanru had the poise of a willow and a beautiful face. It was too bad that she could not open her mouth and talk.

“Many thanks for the life-saving grace! Great kindness can’t be thanked with words. When Ye Yuan’s injuries recover fully, I’ll definitely repay Miss!” Ye Yuan said sincerely.

Liang Wanru beamed, but shook her head.

Ye Yuan knew that she wanted to say that saving him was not for the sake of repayment.

At this time, Liang Wanrong’s mocking cold laugh sounded out at one side. She said, “How laughable! Your divine sea is already ruined, fleshly body is already disabled; you’re already a cripple. To actually still want to make such an empty promise. My good elder sister, looks like you rescued a boastful fellow!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed; he already got to know about this Liang Wanrong from Dustless.

When Liang Wanru rescued him, Liang Wanrong was strongly opposed and even threatened not to care about the two of them.

These two sisters’ disparity was really not an ordinary kind of huge.

One was gentle and kind, while the other was not just vicious like a viper, but was at the very least cold and heartless as one too.

Liang Wanru smiled apologetically at Ye Yuan. Clearly, she was apologizing for her sister’s rudeness.

Ye Yuan sighed in his heart, but then she asked: “You gave me the Profound Essence Pill, I’ll definitely think of a way to return the Profound Essence Pill to you!”

Seeing that Ye Yuan completely ignored her, Liang Wanrong could not help flying into a great rage and berated, “Terrific lad, you dare to ignore this miss? Do you believe this miss will throw you out of the fleet right now and let you run your own course?”

Ye Yuan had yet to say anything, but Liang Wanru blocked in front of Ye Yuan, using a stubborn gaze to look at her sister.

Her resolve to protect Ye Yuan already did not need to go into details.

But when Liang Wanrong saw this, she suddenly started giggling and said, “Hehehe ... My good elder sister, you wouldn’t have taken fancy on this pretty boy, right? Uh ... When just rescued, his face was covered in bloodstains; it was too awful to look at. Looking now, he’s good-looking little pretty boy! Hehe, a mute, a cripple, it’s a match made in heaven!”

Liang Wanrong found it funnier the more she thought. The more she thought, the more she felt that this idea was pretty good, laughing herself into fits.

But Liang Wanru was ashamed and angry, her chest heaving non-stop.

It was just that she could not talk and was totally unable to refute Liang Wanrong’s words.

Ye Yuan suddenly said, “Miss Wanru is beautiful, magnanimous, and kind-hearted. If any man can marry her, that’s his blessing. But Miss Wanrong ... hur hur.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said nothing, but did not carry on speaking.

A ‘hur hur’ already expressed the disdainful attitude incisively and vividly.

With this, Liang Wanrong directly jumped up!

She boasted of being beautiful as a flower and absolutely did not lose to Liang Wanru. Her status in the Liang Family was God knows how many times stronger compared to Liang Wanru.

This punk actually looked down on her!

“Stinking brat, you make it clear for this miss! What’s the meaning of your ‘hur hur’?” Liang Wanrong already reached the edge of rampaging.

Liang Wanrong actually did not have much cunningness. These few years in the Liang Family, it was mostly her mother managing affairs.

Her despise towards her elder sister was already written on the face. Anyone could tell.

If she had any deviousness, she absolutely would not express it so obviously.

Therefore, even though she clearly knew that Ye Yuan would not say anything good, she still wanted to hear.

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Nothing, the meaning is that you, Miss Wanrong ... are out of this Ye’s league!”

That sarcastic tone of Ye Yuan’s was practically almost blowing Liang Wanrong up.

He was clearly saying that you’re inferior to your sister in every way, even if given to me, I would not even want!

In the Jewelhill City, the young masters that came to matchmake at least had to line-up a long street!

This guy actually looked down on her!

“You! You! You, a cripple, actually dare to look down on this miss? Zhang Shun, kill this guy for me and throw him at the roadside to feed the dogs!”

Liang Wanrong was also accustomed to being domineering, killing people at a word of disagreement.

“This ...” Zhang Shun said hesitantly.

Zhang Shun also had his head swell up when he saw. They were just household guards. These two little ancestors having a conflict, it made things very difficult for him being clamped in the middle.

Even though the second miss’ status in the Liang Family was very high, he knew that his master still favored the eldest miss a little more.

With this, no one could be offended.

“Still in a daze for what? Zhang Shun, you aren’t even obeying this miss’ words anymore?” Liang Wanrong glared at Zhang Shun and said.

Finished talking, Liang Wanrong directly lifted a foot and actually struck Liang Wanru’s chest directly, kicking her flying out.

Ye Yuan’s expression turned cold, killing intent surging.

When Liang Wanrong saw this scene, she said with a cold smile, “A cripple still dares to glare at this miss? Do you believe that this miss will dig your eyeballs out right now? Humph! If you all are not making a move, this miss will do it myself!”

Done talking, Liang Wanrong closed in on Ye Yuan. She took out a glinting little blade and went for Ye Yuan’s eyes.

Although Ye Yuan was able to open his mouth and speak, he could not move at all.

That kick of Liang Wanrong was very appropriate, kicking until Liang Wanru could not get up.

With this, nobody could protect Ye Yuan anymore.

The Ye Yuan lying on the carriage was just a lamp awaiting slaughter.

Liang Wanrong dangled the knife in front of Ye Yuan and said with a hideous grin, “Glare! Glare some more! In a minute, you won’t be able to glare anymore!”
