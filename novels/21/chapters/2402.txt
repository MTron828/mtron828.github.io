Chapter 2408: Sword of Spacetime!

“How can this be? If Saint Azure dies, wouldn’t our human race’s hope be all shattered?”

Wan Zhen’s face was full of despair.

Ye Yuan was the human race’s only hope. If he died, this Doomsday Battle would no longer have any hope.

He never thought that Nine-marks powerhouses actually still had Heavenly Dao True Martial this kind of heaven-defying martial art.

But now, facing Yuan Zhen three people’s fatal blow, he felt that he was so powerless.

Three powerful to the extreme auras rushed toward the already seriously injured Ye Yuan.

Especially Yuan Zhen, that explosive momentum was almost making this mountain and river crumble apart.

If his punch landed solidly, there was no possibility of surviving at all.

Bang, bang, bang ...

The three people did not stay at the rear in the slightest, unleashing a wanton bombardment toward Ye Yuan.

How horrifying was the power of Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm?

The space that Ye Yuan was standing at, was reduced to fragments.

Everything there was completely annihilated!

People were simply unable to imagine what could still survive in the face of such power.

Everything was over!

“Hahaha ... Being able to let me run into this boy today, it’s also my divine race’s destiny that made it so! The myriad races ought to be destroyed and the divine race should prosper!” Yuan Zhen said with a loud laugh.

Killing Ye Yuan, he felt incomparably delighted in his heart.

Such a genius dying at his hands was equivalent to throttling the hope of the rise of the human race.

As long as there was no longer Grand Ancestor Spacetime that kind of heaven-defying powerhouse who appeared, it was simply impossible for the myriad races to have any hope of victory.

“Lord Yuan Zhen is mighty!”

“Lord Yuan Zhen is mighty!”

“Lord Yuan Zhen is mighty!”

... ...

With Ye Yuan being killed, the divine race’s morale was greatly boosted, and the human army’s morale was greatly reduced.

For some time, the two armies’ battle situation was greatly reversed.

The humans’ casualties started to grow bigger and bigger.

Yuan Zhen laughed loudly and said, “Nineorigin, dispose these trash as soon as possible! This army should be the human race’s elite division, each person’s law comprehensions are all very high! Don’t let a single one of these people get away!”

Nineorigin was overjoyed and said, “Yes, Lord Yuan Zhen!”

Although he knew that this army was not ordinary, Yuan Zhen, this level of powerhouse, was disdainful to take action against them at all.

Yuan Zhen patted his hands and said coolly, “Alright. Now that this is done, we still have other things to do and will leave first. This place will be left to you!”

As he was speaking, all of them were about to leave.

“The battle isn’t over yet and you’re leaving now?”

But right then, inside the shattered void, a voice suddenly came out.

Everyone’s expression changed.

It was impossible for the voice emitting from there to be someone else, it could only be Ye Yuan!

He actually did not die?

Everyone followed the voice and looked over, only to see a figure slowly walking over.

When the human army saw Ye Yuan, they were immediately wildly ecstatic.

“Hahaha, didn’t die! Lord Saint Azure didn’t die!”

“With him around, we have hope!”

... ...

Each step that he took, the imposing momentum on his body grew a fraction stronger!

Heaven and earth spiritual energy that blotted out the skies and covered the earth engulfed everything and swept over.

Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum rose steadily up, getting stronger and stronger.

Over the years, Ye Yuan’s comprehension of laws became more and more unfathomable.

But he did not deliberately cultivate his cultivation realm.

Now, his rich accumulations erupted. Under Yuan Zhen three people’s stimulation, he broke through once more!

When Yuan Zhen saw this scene, his expression could not help changing wildly and he said in a solemn voice, “How is that possible? Under that kind of situation, even the human race’s Deva Second Blight would have been killed by me too! You actually didn’t die?!”

As Ye Yuan broke through his realm, he said nonchalantly, “Heavenly Dao True Martial is indeed powerful, but you probably have some misunderstanding about one thing. You all are only borrowing the power of Heavenly Dao, and are not the Heavenly Dao that towers above all life! In front of Heavenly Dao, you all are still just ants. Space and time laws are similarly a party of Heavenly Dao! The human race and the divine race, it’s just that the cultivation system is different. There’s no distinction between lowliness and nobleness. But you regard yourself as infallible and feel that you can ignore spacetime law? What a joke!”

Yuan Zhen’s gaze turned dark and he said in a cold voice, “Humph! The divine race is paramount and represents Heavenly Dao. How can it be understandable by you, this sort of ant? Since you’re not dead, then I’ll just kill you again!”

As he said, the moment his aura released, he rushed up once more.

The oppressive power erupted again!

Ye Yuan was firm as a rock, still walking forward slowly. It was just that his right hand reached out and he said coolly, “Come, sword!”

In an instant, countless light dots condensed from all directions, finally condensing to become a pale-yellow light sword.

This sword actually gave people a feeling of wispy and etherealness.

But Yuan Zhen paid no attention to it. Ye Yuan’s breakthrough was not complete yet. So how could a single sword of source do anything to him?

This punch still burst out! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Go!”

Ye Yuan formed a seal with his hand, the light sword tore through the air.

This sword came mistily.

At first, Yuan Zhen did not care at all, and actually planned on extending his hand to go and grab the light sword!

With his current bodily strength, he could crush ordinary Dao artifacts too!

But very soon, his expression changed wildly.

The sword had yet to arrive and the sharp sword energy already made him unable to open his eyes.

The sharpness of this sword seemed to be able to sever heaven and earth.

At this time, how could he still care about killing Ye Yuan? He forcefully twisted his body in the air, wanting to avoid this sword.

People should not look at how his body was extremely huge. Actually, his movements were unbelievably agile.

His body made a strange twist, the light sword brushed past his body.

A few strands of hair floated down, already chopped off by the sword energy.

Yuan Zhen’s heart shook wildly. Just now, just a bit more and he would have been decapitated!

This sword was too sharp!

How could this sword be so sharp?

Ordinary swords, he would not pay attention to them at all.

Even if it was a sword of source, he could wrestle it with his bare hands too.

But that sword earlier, it had clearly already exceeded the scope of source swords.

He did not doubt in the slightest that if he went to grab it with his bare hands, it would definitely have been sliced in half!

How could this be?

He had fought with Ye Yuan’s True Nirvana Sword Formation previously and did not have misgivings about Ye Yuan’s swords at all.

But now, just a condensed light sword was actually so sharp!

“This ... How is this possible? Just what the hell is this sword?” Yuan Zhen said in surprise.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Didn’t you say that Heavenly Dao True Martial can ignore laws? Thanks to you, I fused time, space, sword, three great sources, and comprehended this move, Sword of Spacetime! You can give it a try whether you can ignore it or not!”

“What did you say? You ... fused time, space, sword, three great laws?” Yuan Zhen somewhat doubted whether he heard wrongly or not.

The moment these words came out, everyone’s hearts shook wildly.

Fusing time, space, and sword, three great source laws, could this sort of thing really be what human strength could accomplish?

Fusing the power of laws was originally an extremely difficult thing.

Furthermore, the higher the level of laws, the greater the difficulty of fusion.

The fusion of space and time, two great laws, could be said to be the most difficult fusion in this world!

But fusing time, space, and sword, three great laws, this difficulty was simply unable to use words to describe.

If one had to insist on using words to describe it, then there was only one word —- impossible!

But Ye Yuan actually did it!

True Nirvana Sword Formation was just a move that Ye Yuan created with several great source laws as the foundation, and not a fusion.

What Ye Yuan truly fused in the past were only spatial law and sword law.

But now, Ye Yuan actually fused three great laws!
