Chapter 2282: Well Beaten!

“Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill! You ... You know how to refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill?”

Hearing the name Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill, Heavenly Emperor Justbright’s breathing could not help becoming tense. But very soon, he smiled coldly and said, “Continue bragging, kid! Don’t talk about the fact that you just broke through to Heavenly Emperor Realm; even if you cultivate to Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor, it’s also impossible to refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill!”

Rank eight divine pills were too difficult to refine!

To Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, even the most rubbish medicinal pill could make them excited for many years.

Rank eight divine pills were supreme level medicinal pills.

Without the strength of Ancestor Realm, there was no way to touch it at all!

But even if you had Ancestor Realm strength, it also did not mean that you could refine rank eight divine pills.

Therefore, the number of Eight-star Alchemy Gods was few and far between.

Furthermore, the further Eight-star Alchemy Gods went up, the more difficult it got!

A Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill was a level seven difficulty and above rank eight divine pill. The refining difficulty could be imagined.

Even some Eight-star Alchemy Gods with extremely deep qualifications could not refine it, let alone talk about a brat who just broke through to Heavenly Emperor.

Eight-star Alchemy Gods that could refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill, each one was a supreme level figure of the Heavenspan World.

In terms of status, they were much higher than even Heavenly Emperor Justbright, this Eighth Firmament Heavenly Emperor!

A kid who just broke through to Heavenly Emperor Realm said that he wanted to refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill, wasn’t this a joke?

“Huhu, kid, you got to run it through your head when you’re boasting!”

“If you can refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill, then I can eat the Heavenspan Mountain!”

“Who do you think you are? The reincarnation of the Medicine Ancestor? Able to refine the Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill the moment you broke through?’

... ...

Ye Yuan’s words immediately drew a wave of ridicule.

Ye Yuan did not care and said with a light smile, “Brother Justbright, this Ye isn’t joking with you. Later, you come to Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma to find me. However, you have to gather the rank eight spirit medicines yourself. This Ye isn’t so loaded!”

Finished talking, he turned around and walked towards the transmission array, and went out to the Heavenspan World.

“Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma ... Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, this name is so familiar! Ah! It ... It’s him!” Heavenly Emperor Qing Shan cried out in surprise.

The others had baffled looks, not knowing what this guy was yelling about.

The name of this Bodhidharma, they had never heard before. It was clearly a minor faction.

“Kicking up a big fuss for what? Southern Border that kind of small place, what major faction can there be, being all startled!” Heavenly Emperor Justbright wiped the blood on his face and said unhappily. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Heavenly Emperor Qing Shan said, “You all have been in retreat here for many years and completely don’t know how terrifying this person is!”

When everyone heard it, they could not help becoming interested.

Someone said, “It’s just breaking through to the Heavenly Emperor Realm, what’s there to be afraid of? But his cultivation method is indeed rather sinister, to actually drain all the heaven and earth spiritual energy above 100 thousand miles! But so what? In the outside world, I can smack him to death with one slap!”

But Heavenly Emperor Qing Shan became more and more excited, and he said, “The significance of him breaking through to Heavenly Emperor is extraordinary! Lord Justbright, your beating wasn’t in vain, you made a fortune!”

The moment Heavenly Emperor Justbright heard this, he was greatly enraged and said, “Punk, this emperor remembered you! This emperor can’t do anything to that punk, but could it be that I still can’t do anything to you?”

Heavenly Emperor Qing Shan’s expression changed greatly. He was just a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor, so how could he stand being marked by Heavenly Emperor Justbright?

He waved his hand repeatedly and explained in a fluster, “Lord Justbright, calm your anger! Hear me say it entirely first! This Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma is a new faction that just rose up in these recent few centuries. But no one dares to ignore this faction in the Heavenspan World anymore! That kid earlier is Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma’s leader! And he also has another identity! He is the Priest Temple’s Second Sage!”

“Second Sage! Sacred Ancestor High Priest is an existence second only to the Medicine Ancestor, he’s the Priest Temple’s Second Sage, then ...” When everyone heard this name, their faces finally became solemn.

This Second Sage was not what anybody could take on!

This title could only be recognized by the Sacred Ancestor High Priest himself.

Furthermore, once he acknowledged it, it was equivalent to saying that Ye Yuan had strength that was not inferior to him!

But, a brat who just broke through to Heavenly Emperor Realm, how could he possibly stand on equal footing as Sacred Ancestor High Priest?”

Heavenly Emperor Qing Shan nodded and said, “Not long ago, when he was still a Seven-star Alchemy God, he refined an end spirit divine-grade Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill, and forcefully created a Heavenly Emperor! At that time, he was hailed as the next Medicine Ancestor! Now, he broke through to the realm of Heavenly Emperor ...”

The words at the back, Heavenly Emperor Qing Shan did not speak, but the meaning was already very clear.

This guy was remarkable!

This kind of supreme level Eight-star Alchemy God would become the target of all Heavenly Emperors to suck up to!

The Heavenly Emperors present were already stunned by Heavenly Emperor Qing Shan’s words.

A Seven-star Alchemy God refining an end spirit divine-grade Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill!

This level of skill was simply an accomplishment that surpassed ancient and modern times!

Now that he broke through to Heavenly Emperor Realm, wouldn’t it be incredible?

Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill was indeed hard to refine, but to Ye Yuan, it did not seem to be something beyond comprehension.

“Hahaha ... Well beaten! Well beaten! Beaten too well!”

Heavenly Emperor Justbright suddenly burst into laughter and said three ‘well beaten’ in a row, and said agitatedly, “Kid, what you said is right, this beating was indeed not in vain! This emperor won’t hunt you down anymore, and even have to thank you well! If that boy can refine an end spirit Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill, this emperor will also have more confidence in transcending the Deva blight tribulation! Well beaten! Really well beaten! Hahaha ...”

Heavenly Emperor Justbright laughed crazily, but everyone understood his feelings very well.

Breaking through to become a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor was nothing. The scariest thing was still the Deva blight tribulation!

End spirit Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill was much more helpful to Heavenly Emperor Justbright than breaking through to Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor!

At this time, everyone could not help looking at Heavenly Emperor Justbright rather enviously.

This beating, he took it too beautifully!

If they could, they would be willing to be pummeled into a pig’s head by Ye Yuan.

Heavenly Emperor Justbright did not break through to become a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor this time, but he had blessings come to him in the disguise of misfortune!

“Haha, still cultivate my ass! This emperor will go out right now and quickly collect the spirit medicines and find that bra ... oh, no, find that master to refine the pill! Everyone, goodbye!”

As he said, Heavenly Emperor Justbright left with a big laugh.

... ...

Ye Yuan left the Heavenspan Mountain through the transmission array and arrived at the Heavenly Fate Town where Heavenly Emperor powerhouses climbed the mountain.

Returning to the Heavenspan World, he could teleport and return to Southfoot Town swiftly.

Breaking through to World Realm, Ye Yuan’s divine essence was incomparably thick. A greater teleportation was the distance of a million miles.

But when he was just about to leave, he heard somebody shout behind him, “This ... Younger Brother Ye Yuan!”

Ye Yuan turned out and looked, who could it be if not Heavenly Emperor Justbright?

But seeing his fawning look, he clearly already knew his identity.

“It’s Brother Justbright huh? Why did you come out so quickly? Heavenspan Mountain Dao comprehension is the optimal place to breakthrough!” Ye Yuan said with a joking look.

Heavenly Emperor Justbright’s old face was thick and he said with a smile, “With you, this great deity around, still cultivate my ass! This old man will go and find spirit medicines right away, and then I’ll go to Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma to find you later! You can’t renege on what you promised me!”
