Chapter 2307: Dao Showdown!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The strong get stronger, the weak get weaker. My Dao is that the weaklings are used by the strong.”

“So what if strong? So what if weak? Didn’t you also walk over step by step from being a weakling? You’re better than spirit medicines in that you reincarnated better than them.”

“What a joke! This emperor is extraordinarily talented. Back then, I slaughtered my way out with my strength alone too, becoming the Heavenspan World’s legend. How can I be the same as ants?”

“So what? No matter how strong you are, you can’t escape this Heavenspan World’s cage either! Moreover, in terms of talent, what do you count for in front of this Ye?”

... ...

The two people chimed in one after another, neither able to convince the other.

Being able to tread out one’s own Great Dao, how firm were their minds? How could they be swayed because of a word from others?

Suddenly, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook laughed loudly and said, “Hahaha ... Second Sage, you and I are both heaven’s chosen of the present era. Why is there a need to indulge in a contention of mouth and tongue? It’s still early. So why don’t you and I have a match?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “This Ye had precisely this intention.”

All of a sudden, everyone’s breathing became ragged.

Just as Heavenly Emperor Distantbook said, the two of them were both heaven’s chosen in the present era, their strength crushing their peers. Especially Heavenly Emperor Distantbook, he was an existence who had even exchanged blows with Sacred Ancestor High Priest before.

While Ye Yuan was also a rising star, akin to the noonday sun.

Just how his strength was, everyone was extremely curious.

These two people’s pinnacle showdown was the real highlight of the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time.

The two got up, stepped onto the air, and directly arrived above the void.

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove had his eyes shut the whole time. At this time, he finally opened both eyes, staring straight at the two people above the void.

“Old man, you look at these two people. Who’s stronger and who’s weaker?” Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian said.

“This old man can’t say for sure.” Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove said coolly.

“Heh, you sly old fox, still not willing to open your mouth at this point? In this old man’s view, Second Sage’s spirit is at its height, but he’s still young after all. The journey of Dao pill relies entirely on the accumulation of years. With yours and my accumulations, if we were to really take action, we might not be inferior to Second Sage,” Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian said.

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove’s gaze glimmered slightly and he said, “This old man ... isn’t sure.”

The moment these words came out, all of the ancestors turned pale from shock.

Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian’s expression was ugly as he said, “Old man, you’re not joking, right? This joke isn’t funny at all.”

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove said without batting an eyelid, “Does this old man have a need to joke with you?”

Everyone’s shock was by no means trivial.

Among these ancestors present, the ones who had truly seen Ye Yuan take action was only Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove.

But at that time, Ye Yuan clearly did not use his full strength.

There was no way to judge how Ye Yuan’s strength was at all.

Clearly, Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove judged that Ye Yuan’s strength was difficult to ascertain through some clues and inklings.

He was somewhat unsure, that was why he did not dare to act without careful consideration.

Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove said, “If this old had the confidence, I’d have taken action back then. Why would there be a need to endure patiently until today?”

Everyone turned pale with fright. Thinking about it, it was indeed like so.

If Ye Yuan was really just a young and inexperienced fledgling who comprehended a tiny trace of Dao pill concept, he did not have a need to forbear like so.

After all, disciples kneeling down to apologize, this was not glorious. His face, the ancestor’s face, was also lost.

All of the ancestors looked up above the void, two people stood in the air, all set for a showdown.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly, “How will the two of us approach this?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’re the junior, you choose.”

Heavenly Emperor Dao Ancestor laughed and said, “In this world, apart from Master and Sacred Ancestor High Priest, no one else dares to call me, this emperor, a junior to my face! Second Sage, you’re very arrogant!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “What objections do you have?”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook choked, he really could not find a reason to refute it.

Second Sage and the Sacred Ancestor were peers, which was also being in the same generation as Medicine Ancestor. He was Medicine Ancestor’s disciple, so he was naturally lower.

“Forget it, not going to argue with you. Since our differences lie with spirit medicines, then let’s fight with spirit medicines.”

Done talking, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook pointed at the void. A majestic power of wood essence fired into the ground.

In a blink, a young spirit medicine broke through the ground.

This kind of means made everyone felt it was fantastical as they watched.

This was the source of Great Dao, being able to develop myriad life.

This spirit medicine’s grade was not high, being just a strain of rank three spirit medicine.

To powerhouses at the level of Ye Yuan and Heavenly Emperor Distantbook, this kind of spirit medicine was virtually too offensive to the eyes.

It was only to see Heavenly Emperor Distantbook reach his hand out and beckon. The spirit medicine flew into his hand.

Following that, he drew a circle with one hand, the spirit medicine instantly became crushed, turning into fine powder.

The power of Great Dao suddenly burst forth.

Behind Heavenly Emperor Distantbook, a phantom of the sun suddenly rose, unparalleledly domineering.

This was Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s Great Dao!

Reaching this level, their alchemy battles were not like how it used to be, being based on spirit medicines.

The so-called Dao pill pointed right at the source of Dao. The brilliance of application depended on one’s wit and was no longer bound to pill formulas.

A grain of sand, a rock, a blade of grass, a piece of wood, could be refined into pills.

Just like Sacred Ancestor High Priest, when he fought with Medicine Ancestor back then, they determined the victor and who was superior with just a game.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook shook lightly, that pile of powder flew toward Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan pointed at the air, that ball of powder suddenly became still. At the same time, the power of Great Dao similarly erupted from his body.

An enormous Tai Chi diagram formed behind Ye Yuan. Furthermore, it started to spin slowly.

This was Ye Yuan’s first time displaying his true strength in front of everyone. Everyone instantly became lost in wonder.

Especially Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian. He originally still felt that Heavenly Emperor Maplegrove was overly cautious, but now, he stared wide-eyed and tongue-tied, nothing to say.

This power of Great Dao could already completely be on par with him and did not lose to him in the slightest.

Back then, if he really took action because of Zhao Zixuan’s matter, the outcome might have been very embarrassing.

Losing to a rising star like Ye Yuan who was only two to three thousand years old, his old face would really have nowhere to put.

Heavenly Emperor Yi Xian secretly thought what a close shave.

However, even though Ye Yuan’s power of Great Dao was strong, it was still too weak in front of Heavenly Emperor Distantbook.

One had to know, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook was an existence that had once defeated the various great ancestors before.

In this Heavenspan World, there was only the Medicine Ancestor, Sacred Ancestor High Priest, as well as his eldest senior brother, who could firmly suppress him.

The others so far behind that they could only see the dust ahead.

Above the void, a huge circular aura field formed with the two people as the center.

Focusing one’s eyes and looking, this enormous aura field was the embryonic form of a world.

It was just that this world was not complete and not balanced either.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook clearly suppressed Ye Yuan significantly, occupying a huge advantage.

This kind of situation was like the situation of Medicine Ancestor overwhelming Sacred Ancestor High Priest back then.

The time that Ye Yuan entered the realm of Dao pill was short after all. Compared to Heavenly Emperor Distantbook, he was still too weak.

But Ye Yuan’s face was rippleless like an ancient well and did not have any panicky expression at all.

The Tai Chi diagram behind him was still revolving strongly, without giving in the slightest bit.

The two people, coming and going, that stalk of rank three spirit medicine gradually became egg-shaped, one end big, the other end small.

The larger end was precisely Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s end, while the smaller end was Ye Yuan’s.

Without a doubt, this battle was already Heavenly Emperor Distantbook occupying the absolute advantage.
