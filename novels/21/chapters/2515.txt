Chapter 2521: Jadetrue Anecdote

“Y-You really dare to kill me? I didn’t lie to you. Jadetrue Heavenly Sect will really come and find me!”

Jun Tian’s expression changed, falling back repeatedly.

He was really scared!

Facing death, even if he was a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, he was unable to remain calm too.

Ye Yuan pointed at the sky and said with a faint smile, “Jun Tian, there are still many Heavenspan World martial artists who died wronged currently watching in heaven! If I were to let you go, they won’t let me off even if they become ghosts!”

That smile carried a bone-piercing chill.

Not long ago, he watched Tian Qing die in front of him with his own eyes, powerless to do anything!

That strike, if not for Tian Qing, Li-er would have already perished!

How could Ye Yuan let Jun Tian live?

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan urged the Heavenspan Mountain and directly smashed over toward Jun Tian.

Bang!

This blow struck right on his chest, directly knocking Jun Tian to the ground.

Jun Tian’s two eyes rolled upward. He was only breathing in without breathing out anymore, no longer far from death.

The Heavenspan Mountain was taken in by Ye Yuan. Although its size was not big, if it landed on someone, it was heavy to the extreme.

Jun Tian was struck by the Heavenspan Mountain over and over again. How could he survive by luck?

Ye Yuan did not hold back, controlling the Heavenspan Mountain to smash two more times, and Jun Tian stopped breathing completely.

A grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse was forcibly smashed to death by the Heavenspan Mountain!

Simple, yet crude!

Ye Yuan let out a long sigh, akin to being relieved of a heavy burden.

Jun Tian was like a large mountain, crushing others until the entire Heavenspan World could not breathe.

If not for him breaking through to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum by chance, the consequences would really be unimaginable.

Fortunately, Jun Tian, the main culprit behind controlling the Heavenspan Mountain, was finally dead!

It was just that, even more doubts lingered in Ye Yuan’s heart too.

Jun Tian was merely a small fry. It was impossible for him to have the strength to suppress the Heavenspan World.

At the very most, he just exploited a loophole and made use of the Heavenspan World’s power.

The Jadetrue Heavenly Sect which Jun Tian spoke of was the one that was linked in many ways with the Heavenspan World.

Furthermore, Jun Tian said that he was the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s outer-sect deacon, and he had a life tablet in the sect.

The moment he died, the sect definitely knew about it.

At that time, they would probably really send someone over to investigate.

Ye Yuan did not know Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s attitude towards the Heavenspan World, but Ye Yuan felt that there might not be anything good.

Moreover, he killed a member of the sect. The sect would not be willing to drop the matter too.

In front of a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse, the Heavenspan World was too weak!

Jun Tian was merely a puny little outer-sect deacon and already almost wiped out the entire Heavenspan World.

It could be inferred that if the sect’s powerhouses came, it was absolutely not what the current Ye Yuan could parry.

Ye Yuan being able to defeat Jun Tian was entirely thanks to the Heavenspan Mountain.

With his own strength, even if he broke through to Heavenly Stratum, it was impossible to be Jun Tian’s match too.

This Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was a world that was a completely different level from the Heavenspan World!

The power of rules here was too strong, even Dao Ancestors were unable to enter this world too.

Otherwise, they would be crushed into a meat pancake by the power of rules here.

Dao Ancestors could not withstand the pressure of rules here at all!

Even Ye Yuan was also unable to adapt to the environment here until now.

In fact, even his breathing felt somewhat constrained!

It could be judged that this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven did not have Mortal Stratum martial artists at all.

Heavenly Stratum was the basic requirement to enter this place!

Thinking up to here, Ye Yuan’s brows could not help furrowing tightly, immediately feeling the pressure soared.

This also meant that the Heavenspan World’s trillions of lives were now all tied to him alone!

Once anything happened to him, the Heavenspan World would surely suffer a cataclysmic disaster.

But now, he was completely clueless about this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

In fact, he did not even have a method of cultivation!

No cultivation method!

No martial technique!

No means to use the origin divinity!

Ye Yuan’s only reliance currently was the Heavenspan Mountain!

But on second thought, in such a powerful world, he could always find the method to save Mu Lingxue.

Furthermore, when he asked Jun Tian previously, he could feel that regathering the divine soul did not seem to be something impossible.

Thinking of this, Ye Yuan could not help being a lot more invigorated.

In addition, he even remembered that he had once sensed that his father and Lin Wushuang, their tiny trace of fluctuations, seemed to have returned to heaven and earth too.

Thinking about it now, they probably entered this world!

Then could he find his father too?

Even … reviving him?

Thinking of this, Ye Yuan’s mind could not help shaking.

Ji Zhengyang’s fall was the regret of Ye Yuan’s life.

If he could really meet his father again, even revive him, then he would really have no regrets in this life!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “My current strength is likely the weakest existence in this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! Thinking of these is too far away! The most important thing now is still to understand this world!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze landed on Jun Tian’s corpse.

Jadetrue Heavenly Sect should be a major sect. As a major sect’s disciple, Jun Tian might have some things on him that could let Ye Yuan discover some secrets of the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

Ye Yuan found a storage bracelet on Jun Tian’s body.

Jun Tian was already dead. Hence, this bracelet became an ownerless item.

Ye Yuan found that azure long spear inside, some white crystals, several secret books on cultivation, as well as some random things.

Although that azure long spear was not as terrifying as the Heavenspan Mountain, it was also a decent quality weapon.

Ye Yuan could feel an astonishing aura emitting off it.

As for those white crystals, there was extremely thick spiritual energy in each of them.

This spiritual energy had intrinsic differences from the Heavenspan World’s spiritual energy.

Ye Yuan guessed that this thing might be the Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s universal currency.

Rather, it was those secret books on cultivation that he was interested in. After Ye Yuan browsed through them, he had some understanding about the cultivation of Heavenly Stratum powerhouses.

There was a cultivation method called Jadetrue Spirit Awakening Formula among them, letting Ye Yuan understand a part of the realms of Heavenly Stratum powerhouses.

It turned out that Heavenly Stratum powerhouses were divided into Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum, Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, as well as Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Each major realm was also divided into lower, middle, upper, as well as grand completion, consisting of four minor realms.

Jun Tian was grand completion Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum Realm, being just a step away from Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

While Ye Yuan did not even count as a lower Lesser Sublime Heaven right now. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

To Heavenly Stratum powerhouses, he had not crossed the threshold currently. Because he did not even have the most basic cultivation method.

Unfortunately, this cultivation method only had the first level cultivation method of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum.

Presumably, this Jun Tian’s status in the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect was also not very high.

However, Ye Yuan was not in a rush to cultivate this Jadetrue Spirit Awakening Formula.

Coming this far, Ye Yuan knew that the selection of cultivation method was very important. He was naturally not willing to easily enter a pit.

He still understood the logic of better to go without than to make do with a shoddy substitute.

“Eh,?there’s a Jadetrue Anecdote here!”

When Ye Yuan saw this cover, his eyes could not help lighting up.

He was very curious about this Jadetrue Heavenly Sect. The Heavenspan Mountain was clearly a precious treasure. So why would it be used to suppress the Heavenspan World?

Many mysteries of the Heavenspan World all lay with this Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

Understanding this sect would naturally be very helpful to him.
