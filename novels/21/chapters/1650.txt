Chapter 1654 Roll for Me to See

In front of Heavenly Network Gathering’s main hall, numerous powerhouses slowly entered.

Those able to enter this place were basically all Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

For an Origin Deity Realm powerhouse, their net worth could not even buy leftover bits and pieces when they enter.

Want to enter Riverluck Auction, one would naturally need to verify capital. Without tens of billions of assets, one could not even enter the door. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The guard stopped Ye Yuan and said, “Please show your invitation card.”

Ye Yuan was just about to take out the supreme token when a mocking voice sounded out by his ear.

“Get lost! A measly little Origin Deity Realm also wants to enter the auction, really overestimating your own ability!”

The one talking was a young man, first-layered heaven Divine Lord.

But behind him followed a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord old man.

To be able to make a fourth-layered heaven Divine Lord be an attendant, clearly, this young man’s identity was extraordinary.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed. Really, wherever one went, there were posturing fools.

You enter your auction, I enter my auction, what did I hinder you in?

That young man handed over the invitation and said to the guard at the door, “Your Heavenly Network Gathering is too careless. Why would you let just anyone in? An Origin Deity Realm, what can he do if he goes in?”

Even though Ye Yuan’s void spirit divine pills caused a sensation throughout the whole city, those who had truly met him before were also just those few people.

This guard clearly did not recognize Ye Yuan.

The guard swept a glance at the invitation and hurriedly bowed and said, “Turns out that it’s Melody Sun Imperial City’s Young Patriarch Jing Lu. Pardon me, pardon me. Replying Young Patriarch Jing Lu, as long as one has the Heavenly Network Gathering’s invitation card, they can enter the auction. There’s no restriction in terms of realm.”

The guard’s words made everyone incomparably surprised.

“That’s Melody Sun Imperial City’s Young Patriarch Jing Lu? I heard that he’s a peerless genius. When he was born, he was already initial-stage Origin Deity Realm, and he broke through to first-layered heaven Divine Lord Realm at a mere 500 years old!”

“I also heard before. It’s said that him breaking through to Celestial Deity Realm in the future is virtually a certainty.”

Someone said softly, “But heard that this Young Patriarch Jing Lu is also notoriously overbearing, frequently taking advantage of his influence to bully people.”

...

Clearly, Jing Lu’s reputation spread far and wide. Many people had heard of him before.

When Jing Lu heard the surrounding sighs of admiration, he was incomparably pleased with himself in his heart. He enjoyed these envious looks very much.

“You all wouldn’t be bored until you issued an invitation card to an Origin Deity Realm, right? Kid, do you have an invitation card or not?” Jing Lu asked Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was tickled by this guy and said with a smile, “Invitation card? I really don’t have one.”

Jing Lu’s face fell and he said domineeringly, “Don’t have an invitation card, why haven’t you scrammed yet? Do you want this young master to send you rolling?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “How to roll? You roll one time for me to see[1]?”

Jing Lu saw that Ye Yuan thought nothing of him and his expression could not help turning dark as he said in a cold voice, “Reckless and blind thing, a mere Origin Deity Realm dares to talk this way to this young master! Alright, this young master will let you know how to roll!”

Around them, quite a few people felt that Ye Yuan was very unwise.

Strength was clearly lacking, yet his attitude was still so unyielding. This was not having a backbone, this was being tired of living.

Done talking, Jing Lu released his aura, a foot kicked toward Ye Yuan’s chest.

Behind Jing Lu, that old man’s aura locked onto Ning Tianping firmly.

As long as Ning Tianping had a hint of reckless action, he would take action.

But what surprised him was that Ning Tianping did not have the intention of moving at all. Instead, his face revealed a hint of a mocking smile.

This foot carried world power, how could ordinary Origin Deity Realm powerhouses be a match?

The people seemed to have already seen the scene of Ye Yuan being kicked to death.

However, just as that foot was about to kick until Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan’s body seemingly teleported half a position.

Bang!

A heavy punch struck Jing Lu’s face!

This punch was caught off-guard, Jing Lu directly flew out backward, rolled several hundred feet on the ground before stopping.

This sudden turn of events was too sudden, everyone all did not react.

“What did I see? An Origin Deity Realm sent a Divine Lord Realm flying with one punch?”

“No, wait! My eyes must be failing me! This is impossible!”

“Isn’t it said that Jing Lu is a genius hard to come by in 100 thousand years? Why is he so weak?”

“What that kid used just now seemed to be ... spatial laws! My God, spatial laws!”

...

This scene was already familiar to Ning Tianping. But to others, they were shocked to the core.

An Origin Deity Realm actually sent a Divine Lord Realm flying with one punch. This was too subverting.

“It turns out that this is how you roll! The posture is really unsightly. I’m not going to roll then.” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Jing Lu scrambled to his feet. The facial features on his face all shifted, his nose aching until tears kept flowing, his appearance extremely miserable.

He roared at the old man, “Uncle Huang, kill him for me! I want him dead!”

That old man’s gaze turned sharp and he said in a cold voice, “Young man, you’re courting death!”

Ye Yuan ignored him, fished out the supreme token, and gave it to the guard. He said, “I don’t have an invitation card, I only have this. Can I go in?”

That guard’s gaze turned intent and he said in great alarm, “Supreme token! Y-Your Excellency, this lowly one had eyes but couldn’t see. I have offended Your Excellency, s-sorry!”

The supreme token was the highest-level invitation letter for the auction this time, the ones invited were all big shots.

With his status, he could not afford to offend at all.

Seeing this token, his heart could not help palpitating heavily.

Uncle Huang was just about to fly off the handle when that guard suddenly said coldly, “Halt! This lord is one of my Riverluck Capital City’s most honorable guests! If you dare to attack him, it’s becoming enemies with our three major factions!”

Uncle Huang and Jing Lu somewhat doubted whether their ears heard wrongly or not.

A measly Origin Deity Realm was actually Riverluck Capital City’s most distinguished guest?

Jing Lu said in a solemn voice, “You dare to speak to me this way?”

But that guard did not yield in the slightest as he said, “Apologies. Young Patriarch Jing Lu is naturally our important guest, but the higher-ups instructed that if anyone sees a guest holding a supreme token, we must receive them with the highest standards! If you dare to attack this lord, then I can only say sorry!”

Not just Jing Lu, even the others also looked at Ye Yuan with incomparable shock.

They completely could not understand, how did a measly Origin Deity Realm become the most distinguished guest?

“Humph! A mere second-layered heaven Divine Lord, what can you do to me? Uncle Huang, what are you still waiting for? Attack!”

The guard was merely second-layered heaven Divine Lord cultivation. Jing Lu did not take him seriously at all, directly ordering Uncle Huang to attack.

But Uncle Huang hesitated.

Before he came, Head Elder explained solemnly before, to make sure never to come into conflict with the three major forces.

Riverluck Capital City was merely a capital city. If they did not have a certain background, how could they possibly stand tall?

One had to know, there were three imperial cities around Riverluck Capital City. Among them included Melody Sun Imperial City.

But these three imperial cities had very weak control toward Riverluck Capital City.

One could say that Riverluck Capital City was an independent kingdom.

Uncle Huang was not a silkpants like Jing Lu, so he was deeply aware of the seriousness involved.

Killing an Origin Deity Realm was easy, but they already said the words very clearly.

Ye Yuan was the most honorable guest!

One had to know, even with their status, they did not get the supreme token.

The importance of this token could be seen at a glance.

Uncle Huang said, “Young Patriarch, better forget it! The less trouble, the better, let’s go in!”
