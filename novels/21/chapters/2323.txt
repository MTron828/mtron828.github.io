Chapter 2327: Former Glory!

“Oh? You seem to be very confident, then this ancestor will size you up and see how much capability you have then!”

The divine race were all extremely confident in themselves. Furthermore, after this campaign, he was extremely apprehensive of Ye Yuan and naturally not willing to let him leave just like this.

Right away, the two people came to blows like lightning.

Before that, Jian Yunxian flicked his sleeves and swept Ye Yuan away.

It was only to hear a series of explosions came from amidst the spatial turbulent flow. It was as if heaven and earth were shaking.

This level of battle was even more horrifying than Medicine Ancestor three people’s battle previously.

Ye Yuan was filled with fear. Only now he was aware that Originguard was still hiding his strength!

The divine race was really powerful until it made people despair!

Ye Yuan understood that Originguard only suppressed his strength in order to wipe out all of the alchemy path powerhouses.

Otherwise, if he used his full strength, the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art would not be able to withstand it at all.

That way, whether or not he could eradicate Medicine Ancestor and Wing was hard to say, but wanting to wipe out all of the alchemy path powerhouses, that would have been impossible.

At this time, Originguard did not have the slightest scruples, showing his full strength. It was truly heaven-shocking.

But what shocked Ye Yuan even more was that Jian Yunxin’s strength was actually not the slightest bit inferior to Originguard.

These two people fought until the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open amidst the spatial turbulent flows, being locked in a tangled battle.

No idea how long had passed. Jian Yunxin appeared in front of Ye Yuan again, his breathing being slightly chaotic.

Clearly, he did not occupy much advantage in this great battle.

Of course, Originguard withdrew at this point. Clearly, he could not do anything to Jian Yunxin as well.

Originguard withdrawing, the other divine essence powerhouses naturally no longer stayed behind, and also retreated one after another.

This astonishing assault ended here.

In this battle, even though the humans cleared the ordeal narrowly, the losses were extremely heavy.

The humans lost close to 60% of their elite alchemists!

The entire Cloudheart Realm collapsed completely, causing more than half of Medicine Ancestor’s disciples to perish.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest suffered heavy injuries, and his disciples also had three people who died.

The various progenitors also sustained casualties.

The whereabouts of the alchemy path’s number one person, Medicine Ancestor, were unknown.

The entire alchemy world virtually suffered a devastating blow.

It could be said that Originguard’s plan succeeded by half.

After this battle, the world was shocked!

A race called the divine race rose up from the abyss, and the disaster engulfed the entire Heavenspan World.

Very soon, another explosive news broke out.

The divine race’s eight lineages came out in unison, breaking the three abyss seals, and unleashed a horrifying confrontation with the demon race’s Eight Sacred Clans.

The Abyss Suppressing Eight Realms returned in a miserable defeat.

The powerhouses of the Eight Sacred Clans that perished were countless, the losses extremely heavy.

But later, a little girl’s crying suddenly sounded out.

Following that lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. Floodwaters surged massively and the sky was rent asunder and the earth split open. It was as if the end had come.

In an instant, countless divine race powerhouses and abyss monsters were exterminated before it repelled the divine race’s attack.

One stone stirred up a thousand ripples. The entire Heavenspan World was shocked.

One had to know, the Eight Sacred Clans’ foundation was extremely deep. Their strength was an apex existence when placed across the entire Heavenspan World, not just in the demon race.

But who knew that they actually could not stand up to a single blow in front of the divine race army!

Finally, the Abyss Suppressing Eight Realms collapsed, turning into rubble.

The divine race led the abyss army and officially stepped into the Heavenspan World. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The curtains of the Doomsday Battle officially drew!

At the Heavenspan World’s various places, the divine race emerged like groundhogs.

The two world’s barrier already became riddled, being full of holes.

Or one should say that the divine race already utterly grasped the method to pass through the barrier. They came and went as they pleased, causing great harassment to the Heavenspan World.

At Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, Ye Yuan and Jian Yunxin sat facing each other.

“In this battle, Young Friend Ye’s merits are the greatest!” Jian Yunxin said.

“Why does Senior say this?” Ye Yuan said.

“In this battle, a slight tug in one area will affect the situation on the whole. The divine race has been silent for trillions of years. But this time, they prepared for everything. Young Friend Ye disrupted heaven’s secrets and disrupted the divine race’s overall plan. Therefore, I say that your merits are the greatest!” Jian Yunxin said solemnly.

Once the divine race quietly wiped out all of the alchemy path elites, the consequences would be too ghastly to contemplate.

Once they launched a surprise attack and the human race was caught by surprise, the flames of war would burn across the entire Heavenspan World very quickly.

That way, the losses would be much more terrifying than now.

Currently, Originguard’s plans were ruined, and the humans were prepared in advance. The losses had naturally been reduced significantly.

Ye Yuan did not claim credit, but he frowned instead and said, “Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets has calculated everything in the world and grasps heaven’s secrets. Moreover, those major powers have long known about the divine race’s matters perfectly clear. So why can’t they prepare for the divine race’s chaos early?”

Jian Yunxin discerned Ye Yuan’s dissatisfaction and could not help laughing as he said, “Young Friend Ye, you take the divine race too lightly! This emperor knows that your combat strength is unparalleled, but the entire human race only produced you alone! You don’t know what kind of terrible price the human race and demon race have paid for the sake of the Heavenspan World today! In the last Doomsday Battle, even though the human race suppressed the divine race in the Abyss World, they suffered a great loss in vitality too, eight to nine out of ten top experts dying! Furthermore, in that battle, many Dao teachings went extinct, greatly limiting the human race’s development. Even up till today, the human race hasn’t fully recovered.”

“Everyone says that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets knows everything, but these people don’t know that heaven’s secrets are unfathomable! Especially concerning Doomsday Battle this sort of major event, how could it be calculated accurately? Father has long set about to prepare to deal with today’s change. It’s just that he also didn’t expect that the divine race came into being several thousand years earlier than he had calculated. With this, it disrupted all of his plans.”

Regarding this level of secrets, Ye Yuan really did not know much.

It was just that the divine race was not that impressive in his view.

He thought that as long as the humans dealt with it carefully, they would be able to defeat them.

It was just that looking at it now, he was too naive.

But hearing Jian Yunxin’s words, Ye Yuan remembered Originguard’s words.

The human race’s former Alchemy Dao was extremely glorious.

It was just that presently, all of it had declined.

Even Medicine Ancestor this strength was likely a rookie when placed in the last epoch too.

Looking at it like this, the former human race had indeed reached unprecedented glory.

Most likely, powerhouses that had touched the power of source were far from just one!

Furthermore, when Ye Yuan was in the Ancient God Battlefield, the Empyrean Vast Universe who gave him the bone sword also once said that ancient geniuses were extremely strong. Each and every one of them was incredibly talented.

Under the two-phase confirmation, the present human race was really weak to the max.

He also gradually believed Jian Yunxin’s words at this time.

It was not that the human race did not want to respond, but that they were powerless to respond!

“Then ... What about those Dao Ancestor powerhouses? Aren’t they invincible existences? Could it be that even if they take action, they can’t suppress the divine race too?” Ye Yuan asked curiously.

Jian Yunxin laughed in spite of himself and said, “Dao Ancestors? That’s right. Dao Ancestors indeed control the laws in an area. It’s just a shame that ... they are the human race’s Dao Ancestors!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “What does this mean?”

Jian Yunxin smiled and said, “Do you know who shouldered the responsibility of Dao Ancestor in the previous epoch?”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted and he said in shock, “Could it be ... the divine race?”

Jian Yunxin nodded and said, “That’s right, it’s precisely the divine race! The divine race powerhouses have unparalleled combat power. Coupled with the augmentation of laws, they were virtually invincible existences!”
