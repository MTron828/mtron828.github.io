Chapter 3084: Jinx!

“Kill, kill, kill! Kill all of these blood dogs until not even a fragment of armor remains!”

Zhou Xianchen casually squashed a blood race Emperor Sakra Heaven, both eyes blood-red.

In the past few days, he was extremely fierce, suddenly incarnating into a god of killing, making his opponents feel a chill.

Just yesterday, Zhou Xianchen even personally killed a blood race Hegemon.

Having comprehended the Heaven volume, Zhou Xianchen’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds again, and he was already not far from Peak Hegemon.

He relied on his powerful strength and kept charging at the front lines in the war with the blood race, with no fear of death.

He did not care about some scars at all.

The blood race was bloodthirsty. He was similarly full of killing intent.

Father, Ancestor, and also many brothers and sisters were all wiped out!

This blood feud made him dare not relax in the least bit.

Having blocked four rounds of attacks in succession, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven began to counterattack.

The blood race army was being suppressed crazily and had already retreated to the vicinity of the boundary wall.

Ye Yuan and Yang Qing took the lead. Wherever they went, none could last a single exchange with them.

......

The two of them were too strong!

They were virtually invincible under Hegemon Realm!

The blood race’s revival was not considered some technique to them at all.

Yang Qing still took some effort to kill them, but Ye Yuan completely obliterated the bloodkins in the same rank with just one punch.

Wherever they went, the bloodkins did not dare to confront them head-on at all.

After experiencing the Labyrinth Divine Palace battle, the Emperor Sakra Heaven powerhouses from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven that survived, each and every one of them was extremely powerful.

They were not at all inferior when compared to the geniuses from humanity’s three supreme heavens.

As for those blood race Hegemons, they wanted to kill Ye Yuan very much, but Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had too many Hegemon Realms!

Furthermore, with six mighty Great Beyond powerhouses holding down the fort, they had no chance at all.

“Hahaha?

… What bullshit number one race in all the heavens, really weak to the max! Isn’t there a single one who can fight?” Yang Qing’s long spear danced as if nobody on earth could beat him.

Yet, the blood race powerhouses could not do anything to him.

The present Yang Qing, even 20 to 30 origin powerhouses found it hard to get close to him.

Moreover, the blood race was already a spent force.

Boom!

The boundary wall collapsed. The bloodkins that were detained in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven were completely wiped out.

“Ye Yuan, let’s kill our way over!” Yang Qing got excited from killing and actually did not want to stop.

The plane this area of boundary wall connected to was Yuan Ming Wen Ju Heaven. It had already completely fallen.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “The blood race is so arrogant. We naturally have to teach them a lesson!”

… . .

At Yuan Ming Wen Ju Heaven, the supreme leader, Lan Jie, was currently drinking blood in a palace, his expression enjoying it very much.

That was the fresh blood of a Hegemon Realm powerhouse!

“Hur hur,?what a cushy job! The likes of this kind of low-level plane, it’s too easy to take over! In less than ten years, Progenitor’s true self will be able to come into being, and the myriad worlds will tremble!” Lan Jie said with a chuckle.

“Now, there’s news coming from all worlds. Apart from those few high-level planes, the other heavens are already in our pockets!” Another Great Beyond powerhouse said with a smile.

Lan Jie nodded and said, “Is there news from Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven?”

That person shook his head and said, “There’s no news yet. Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven currently has the true spirit clans around. It’s probably not easy to take over.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lan Jie smiled and said, “Hence, that’s why Progenitor sent Bloodooze five people to attack Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven! No matter how powerful Mi Tian is, he’s also not a match for the five of them, right??Hur hur,?wait patiently. Good news shouldn’t be far away. Also, that Ye Yuan, with five Great Beyond powerhouses taking action, it will likely be impossible for him to escape his doom!”

Boom!

With a loud bang, something fell from the sky, directly smashing through the great hall.

Lan Jie two people hurriedly stood up and came to the large hole that was smashed out to take a look. It was a person!

This person was precisely the Bloodooze that they had just mentioned!

This Bloodooze was none other than precisely the Lord Wang Zuo back then!

Having obtained bloodline transformation now, he also successfully broke through to Great Beyond Realm.

Furthermore, his strength was very formidable!

This time, he planned on going to kill Ye Yuan with a vengeful heart.

Who knew that he kicked an iron plate.

Putting aside that he failed to kill him, he even suffered heavy losses himself.

The four Great Beyond powerhouses that he brought were all dead.

“Bloodooze, what happened to you? Where are the four of them?” The smile on Lan Jie’s face was replaced by shock.

Bloodooze’s strength was the strongest among them!

With Progenitor making him bring a team to go and attack Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, it was counting on him to go and restrain Mi Tian. His strength could be seen.

But now, Bloodooze’s appearance was totally like a dog who lost its home!

“A-All dead!” Bloodooze used all the strength in his body and shouted.

Lan Jie’s entire body shuddered heavily, his eyes revealing a look of disbelief.

Four Great Beyond powerhouses, they died just like that?

When did Mi Tian become so strong?

“What in the world happened?” Lan Jie shot out a ray of blood light, helping Bloodooze heal his injuries as he asked.

Receiving Lan Jie’s treatment, Bloodooze’s consciousness became a little clearer, and he said, “The four great true spirit clans’ Supreme Hegemons broke through to Great Beyond Realm at the same time! The Dragon Clan’s Mi Zhen also recovered his peak strength! The current Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven has six mighty Great Beyond powerhouses!”

“What?!” Lan Jie two people almost jumped up.

The news that Bloodooze brought was seriously too shocking!

Six mighty Great Beyond powerhouses, even if it was those high-level planes, it was very hard to possess that too!

A puny little Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven actually gave birth to six!

Bloodooze said with unwillingness: “The five of us directly killed our way to the Extreme Medicine Sect, planning on killing Ye Yuan in one go, and then swallow up Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. Who knew that Mi Zhen and the six mighty Great Beyond powerhouses suddenly appeared, directly surrounding us. Mi Tian and Mi Zhen are too strong, forcibly grinding the four of them to death! Even I almost lost my life there too!?Oh,?right! Mi Tian’s strength seems to be even stronger than before! When I faced him, I actually had the feeling like I was facing Progenitor! If not, we wouldn’t have suffered such heavy casualties either.”

Lan Jie two people were dumbfounded from listening. This sudden turn of events caught them by surprise.

With five mighty Great Beyond powerhouses, this was absolutely an extremely terrifying force.

But who knew that they were ganged up on!

What difference was this from walking right into a trap?

“How … How did this happen?” Lan Jie said in a daze.

Bloodooze shook his head and said, “D-Don’t know! These few years, we’ve been consolidating the various tribes and didn’t pay much attention to the outside world’s news. But, in just a few years’ time, how can so many Great Beyond powerhouses possibly pop out all of a sudden?”

Lan Jie said gloomily, “This Ye Yuan is really a jinx! Why does our blood race succumb at his hands every time?”

The blood race reemerged this time, rampaging in all directions, virtually sweeping across the 33 Heavens.

Yet, they suffered a loss in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!

Right at this time, a subordinate hurriedly came to report.

“Lord Lan Jie, things are bad! Things are bad! Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army has broken through the boundary wall and has already charged over! Our people can’t stop them at all!”

Lan Jie’s expression changed wildly, and he said, “They really have such gall to actually dare cross worlds and come!”

Bloodooze looked at him like looking at an idiot and said, “They have six mighty Great Beyond powerhouses. Why won’t they dare to cross worlds and come? Stop standing stupidly, hurry up and bring me away! In addition, hurry up and send the news to Progenitor. Ask his elderly self to come and make a final decision!”
