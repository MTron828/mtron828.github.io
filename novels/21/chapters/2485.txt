Chapter 2491: Transaction!

“This … This … is too strong! Really too strong!”

“Five great Dao Ancestors! Those were five great Dao Ancestors! One was killed just like that?”

“Originally I thought that Universe was already Lord Saint Azure’s strongest move. Who would have expected that he actually still had more cards up his sleeves!”

… …

The Deva powerhouses present were all staring dumbfoundedly with their mouths agape.

Ye Yuan’s Dual Polarity move killing Ancestor Water also announced the arrival of a new era!

Dao Ancestors would die!

In reality, this Dual Polarity move was not some new trick. It was just a derivative move of Universe.

The universe was all-encompassing!

Therefore, Universe this move in itself was even and calm, having no weakness to exploit.

However, this move also sacrificed the cutting edge and fierceness of Sword Dao.

Dual Polarity this move was derived from Universe.

It divided Universe into two, transforming it into two poles.

With two poles circulating, continuous reproduction in an endless succession, they unleashed the cutting edge of Sword Dao to the extreme.

Therefore, the offensive power of this move was formidable to the extreme.

Of course, Universe turning into Dual Polarity was tantamount to sacrificing defensive power.

But this was nothing to Ye Yuan.

His physical body already reached the realm of a Grand Ancestor. Who could rival it in this world?

Even Tian Qing’s physical body was also far inferior when compared to him!

At that moment, Ye Yuan activated the dragon race samsara progenitor’s other innate divine ability, True Dragon Profound Armor!

True Dragon Profound Armor was the dragon race’s strongest defensive divine ability.

He forcefully resisted the all-out attacks of five great Dao Ancestors and unleashed his strongest sword art, killing Ancestor Water and scaring four ancestors away, shocking everyone present!

This scene was seriously too soul-stirring.

“This … Lord Saint Azure already obtained two of the nine! In this struggle for Dao Ancestor, he’s virtually in an undefeatable position!” Suddenly, someone reacted with a look of surprise.

Each rule crystal was extremely precious!

In the last struggle for Dao Ancestor, no idea how many Deva powerhouses died.

The killing was tragic to the extreme.

After that battle, humanity’s major powers virtually fell into a disjointed generation!

But now, Ye Yuan was almost certain to be the biggest winner.

By the side, someone nodded and said, “With Lord Saint Azure’s present strength, when rule crystals reach his hands, nobody can snatch it away at all! Even Tian Qing and Dao Ancestor Life can’t as well!”

“Lord Saint Azure himself already possesses Dao Ancestor-class terrifying strength. Coupled with two great Dao Ancestors, this Heavenspan World will be Lord Saint Azure’s world in the future!”

The present situation was what everyone did not expect.

Less than halfway through the passageways, Ye Yuan already had two rule crystals in his hands!

The crux was that when rule crystals reach his hands, it would be difficult to spit it out.

… …

To say that Ye Yuan was unlucky, he actually acquired two rule crystals in a row.

But to say that he was lucky, walking along the way, he never found news about the Tear of Life.

Regardless of whether it was him or anyone else.

Currently, he already arrived above 800,000 miles. Along the way, virtually everyone knew that he had rule crystals in his hands.

If someone obtained the Tear of Life, they would definitely come to find him to exchange.

It was just that sadly, there wasn’t!

The mountainous paths became wider and wider. The originally narrow, winding trails already became main roads that led to heaven.

But Ye Yuan’s mood inexplicably became irritable.

He was not interested in other lucky chances.

Because to him, these lucky chances were already of little use.

Only the Tear of Life was what he was determined to get.

Along with the mountain paths getting higher and higher, the pressure in Ye Yuan’s heart also grew increasingly greater.

Ye Yuan passed through the fog and finally arrived above a million miles!

Ahead, nine main roads gradually became clear.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp!

A familiar figure was currently sitting cross-legged, blocking in the middle of the main road.

And on the ground in front of him, three people were lying on the ground.

The three people’s hand and leg ligaments were all severed. The auras on their bodies were also incredibly frail, having only left with one last breath.

These three people were none other than precisely Pang Zhen, Wan Zhen, as well as Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets!

And that figure sitting cross-legged was none other than precisely Dao Ancestor Life, Lin Chaotian!

Seeing Ye Yuan appear, Lin Chaotian did not seem surprised and said smilingly, “You’re finally here?”

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sullen and he said in a cold voice, “What do you want?”

Lin Chaotian smiled and said, “Nothing. I just want to make a deal with you!”

Ye Yuan said in a cold voice, “Speak!”

The corners of Lin Chaotian’s mouth curled slightly and he said smugly, “I know that you have two rule crystals on you, hand them over and exchange for two people! The remaining person dies!”

After Lin Chaotian entered, he did not put his heart and soul into finding rule crystals.

On the contrary, he scattered the people under him out, to search for the whereabouts of the people around Ye Yuan.

Among the people around Ye Yuan, there were many who entered this time. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Apart from Pang Zhen and Wan Zhen, there was also Long Yi, Bai Chen, and the rest.

Heaven rewarded the faithful. Lin Chaotian found Pang Zhen, Wan Zhen, as well as Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets!

Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets was personally captured by him.

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, a piercing cold killing intent instantly bloomed.

This Lin Chaotian was really shameless to the extreme!

However, when Lin Chaotian saw Ye Yuan’s expression, he enjoyed it very much and said with a faint smile, “You seem to be very furious??Huhu,?weren’t you very arrogant when you were outside? What about now? Continue being arrogant!?Mn??This ancestor knows that the people around you will always be your greatest weakness! You fool, to actually still dare to bring them in! Forget that you brought them in. But you actually dared to let them run around recklessly on the Heavenspan Mountain!?Huhu,?are you very conflicted right now?”

The current Lin Chaotian felt a delight of having taken revenge.

For so many years, he, this Dao Ancestor, had suffered no idea how many losses under Ye Yuan’s hands!

His hatred toward Ye Yuan had long already reached the limit.

So what if Saint Azure?

He was a Dao Ancestor!

He was the number one Dao Ancestor!

But now, he was like a dog who lost its home!

This was thanks to Ye Yuan!

Therefore, he wanted to return all these pain to Ye Yuan!

“Huhu,?entering the Heavenspan Mountain this time, I never thought of going to find the rule crystals at all! Because I know that you’ll help me find it! Your destiny is too heaven-defying! Sure enough, you didn’t disappoint me! Not only did you obtain the rule crystal, you even obtained two!”

“But very sadly, you only obtained two!?Hahaha?… you have to abandon one person, you should be very pained, right? But this sort of pain is precisely what I hope for!”

Talking about how he was pleased with himself, Lin Chaotian could not resist raising his head to the sky and laughing loudly.

These few years, he had never felt so happy before!

Suddenly, he flipped his palm over. A crystal clear crystal appeared in his palm.

The moment this thing appeared, a powerful life force instantly spread out.

This extremely clear crystal took on a water droplet shape.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, immediately guessing the origin of this crystal.

Tear of Life!

This thing was the Tear of Life he had been searching bitterly for!

It was actually in Lin Chaotian’s hands!

Lin Chaotian said smugly,?“Huhu,?you didn’t see wrongly. It’s the Tear of Life! I know that you’re looking for it, but very unfortunately, it was obtained by me!”
