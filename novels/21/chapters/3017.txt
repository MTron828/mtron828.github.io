Chapter 3016: Responsibility!

“Hahaha?…”

When Mi Tian heard about the matter of the nine clans’ young patriarchs, he burst out laughing and said, “Ye Yuan that boy, forget about whatever young patriarch, even if this progenitor gave this position of progenitor to him, he won’t even look at it in his eyes!”

Long He and the rest who were kneeling on the ground could not help breaking out into a cold sweat.

It turns out that what Ye Yuan said were heartfelt words!

Yet, none of them believed it at all! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Furthermore, Progenitor did not have any intention of letting Ye Yuan be whatever young patriarch at all.

This … it was really asking for a rebuff, and they even lost so much face.

“P-Progenitor, forgive our mistake!” Long He and the rest broke out in heavy sweat.

“The few of you, put more thoughts into cultivation is the right path! The calamity of the blood race will soon sweep throughout all the heavens. Time won’t wait for us!” Mi Tian said in earnest.

“Yes, Progenitor!” Long He and the others perspired from embarrassment and withdrew.

Once everyone left, Long Jian complained with a black face, “Progenitor, Ye Yuan that boy is too condescending! I sent people to call him over, saying that you came back. He’s actually making you go over in person! Hanging around that bunch of monsters all day, fiddling with those medicinal pills of his, how preposterous!”

Mi Tian smiled when he heard that and said,?“Hur hur,?when this boy starts tinkering with medicinal pills, he doesn’t recognize his closest relatives! But this boy is a man of his word. He once promised to save those bloodline warriors. He’ll definitely do his best! Furthermore, he has fused with the four great true spirit bloodlines now. Maybe he had some unexpected gains. Come on, go and take a look together.”

Long Jian was dispirited. He felt that Progenitor pampered Ye Yuan too much.

This boy belonged to that kind that went from bad to worse.

If you gave him face, his tail could curl up to the sky!

Also, not cultivating properly and tinkering with those medicinal pills, what was the damn use?

To them, this kind of chaos true spirits, they actually did not think too highly of heavenly pills.

Their bloodlines were powerful, and they were extremely talented. Cultivating was also very fast.

The two people quietly came to Ye Yuan’s closed-seclusion area. Ye Yuan was currently mustering his energy like a mountain, Great Dao contending. Amidst the nirvanic rebirth fire, a heavenly pill was currently gradually condensing.

By now, Ye Yuan’s pill refinement had already become somewhat casual.

Back then, Cloudmount’s flower blooming with one hand, one thought, opened another door in Alchemy Dao for Ye Yuan.

As the saying went, there was nothing that could not be refined in the world. Ye Yuan already had a preliminary understanding of it.

And Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven could really be said to be the paradise of heavenly alchemists.

Heavenly Dragon Island’s heavenly medicines had a huge variety of strains, with the quality being extremely good. Ye Yuan simply felt like it was inexhaustible.

During these few days that Mi Tian was not around, he had been in closed-seclusion the whole time to study bloodlines. Now, he finally had some leads.

“Condense!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry; the pill formed!

Behind him, Zhao Yue brought three months and sat up straight on the ground, like pets.

They completely did not understand what Ye Yuan was doing, the look in their eyes somewhat vacant.

But Zhao Yue’s eyes held some light.

He still had a residual trace of intelligence remaining. There was a trace of desire to return in the depths of his heart.

Hence, the look in his eyes became bright.

“The bloodlines in their entire bodies have already been broken. Even their origin divinities have been corroded too, they already can’t be considered human anymore! No matter how formidable the heavenly pill, it can’t save them too! Kid, you’re wasting time!” Long Jian spoke up.

Ye Yuan ignored him, directly stuffing the heavenly pill into the mouth of one of the bloodline warriors.

That bloodline warrior stuck his tongue out, rubbing against Ye Yuan’s trouser legs as if ingratiating himself, just like a little doggy.

Ye Yuan’s heart could not help aching. In his view, a person’s most valuable thing was dignity!

A scholar prefers death to humiliation!

But Mi Zhen and Dragonsand and the rest trampled these people’s dignity ruthlessly underfoot.

Mi Tian had spent a long time with Ye Yuan. How could he not understand what he was thinking?

He sighed slightly and said, “Mi Zhen deserves to die. If you want to kill him, I won’t stop you!”

Long Jian’s expression changed, and he looked toward Mi Tian in shock as he said, “Progenitor, this …”

Mi Tian waved his hand and said, “Heavenly Dragon Island is far removed from the masses and reality. How can it understand the hardships of all life? When this progenitor roamed the heavens, fooling around all the time, I never placed them in my eyes at all too. But, after dying once and falling into damnation for hundreds of thousands of years, this progenitor has already seen through many principles. This progenitor learned many things from Ye Yuan.”

He really learned a lot from Ye Yuan.

Such as responsibility!

He was the dragon race’s progenitor, but the vast majority of the time, he fooled around in the mortal world, throwing the Dragon Clan’s affairs to Mi Zhen.

He had never really shouldered the Dragon Clan’s responsibility before.

But Ye Yuan?

In the war that swept throughout the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, Ye Yuan was merely an ant.

However, he assumed the responsibility that he should not have shouldered, defending the human race time and again.

This shouldering of responsibility made Mi Tian feel great respect.

It was also precisely because of this responsibility that he would insist on sending him back.

If it were others, could they have done it?

These people had nothing to do with Ye Yuan.

He originally could have discarded them away after finishing making use of them. This was also the least troublesome method.

But Mi Tian knew that it was impossible.

It was because they had already become a responsibility to Ye Yuan!

Long Jian was shocked!

He discovered that Progenitor became very different from before!

He had always thought that Ye Yuan was the successor that Progenitor appointed.

But now, he felt that Progenitor and Ye Yuan seemed more like bosom friends who swore to live or die together.

It was just that this kind of sensation was too ridiculous.

A Great Beyond Realm overlord being friends with a junior who was just Emperor Vast Heaven Realm?

In the cultivation world, cultivation realm was the greatest gulf.

Emperor Vast Heaven and Emperor Vast Heaven could become friends, but it was absolutely impossible for Emperor Vast Heaven and Emperor Sakra Heaven to become friends.

That was the difference in level, no question being asked.

But Mi Tian and Ye Yuan had clearly broken this wide chasm.

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and shook his head and said, “His life and death had better be left to Zhao Yue they all! I think nobody is more qualified to determine his life or death than Zhao Yue they all.”

Mi Tian nodded and said, “All right. Do you really have confidence?”

Ye Yuan said, “Their situation is very complicated. It’s a little hard. However, I have some leads.”

Long Jian’s mouth curled. Clearly, he still did not believe it.

Reconstructing was harder than destroying. Wanting to let these people recover back to new, it was really harder than ascending to heaven.

To some extent, they were already another form of organism.

Therefore, although Mi Tian was very familiar with Ye Yuan’s methods, he still somewhat doubted it.

Right at this time, that bloodline warrior suddenly fell to the ground in agony, spasming non-stop on the ground.

“ARGHHH?…” The bloodline warrior let out miserable cries that struck the heart.

And some of the thorns and claws on his body were actually retrograding!

When Long Jian saw this scene, his eyes could not help going wide, and he cried out in shock, “This … How is this possible?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Nothing is impossible. There’s no fixed law in the world. Since he can become like this, there’s naturally a way to turn him back too. It just depends on whether or not one can find the correct method. However … it seems to still be somewhat lacking!”

Talking until the back, Ye Yuan could not help sighing lightly.

Sure enough, that bloodline warrior’s retrogression stopped.

However, most of the monster forms on his body were already gone.

Ye Yuan went up to inspect the bloodline warrior, absorbed in thought.
