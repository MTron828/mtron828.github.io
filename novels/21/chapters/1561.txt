Chapter 1565 Never Forget Till Death

“Hey, two hours are up. Still not coming out ... it will be considered as you all admitting defeat!”

Although Deercry believed that victory was at hand, he would not give Ye Yuan more time.

He started clamoring outside before two hours were up.

He was a sixth level Divine Lord powerhouse. Mustering up divine essence to shout, it could naturally transmit into the inner hall.

Creak ...

The door of the inner hall slowly opened. A group of people appeared in everyone’s line of sight once more.

Deercry’s gaze landed on Lu Yi and could not help being startled in his heart.

No idea why, he felt that some kind of change took place on Lu Yi.

Seeing ghosts! Merely two hours’ time from start to finish, could it be that that kid can really defy the heavens? No, wait, this must be an illusion! Deercry secretly said in his heart.

Actually, not just him, everyone had this peculiar feeling.

However, they denied their thoughts very quickly.

Because two hours’ time was totally impossible to change the outcome of this competition.

Alchemy Dao required the immersion of time. The disparity between Deercry and Lu Yi simply could not be made up for with just two hours.

If two hours could change the results, then wouldn’t the other alchemists’ year after year of bitter cultivation become a joke?

“Heh, it’s still not too late to admit defeat now. If you concede right now, kowtow whatever can be brushed off. You all just have to stop meddling in other people’s affairs and hand over that brat will do.” Deercry said with a fake smile, but his gaze darted at Ye Yuan.

Lu Yi pursed his mouth and said disdainfully, “If I can’t win you, this old fellow today, wouldn’t you act like a tyrant in front of me every single day in the future? I’m going to let everyone know today that you, this old thing, have no right to posture in front of me!”

“Yoo, going in for two hours, your mouth became hard when you came out! But talking big got to have the capital too. With just the likes of you, you’re still far from it!” Deercry laughed loudly and said.

Lu Yi snorted coldly and said, “Enough bullshit, we’ll only know after competing!”

Deercry smiled and said, “Since you’re impervious to reason, then I’ll let you witness what’s the strength of a senior!”

The two people did not pick a place either, squaring off inside the hall of this Miracle Hand Parlor.

Hearing that a Four-star Alchemy God was competing in alchemy at the Miracle Hand Parlor, this news swept throughout the entire south city like the wind.

Quite a number of alchemists all acted without delay upon hearing it, coming forward to witness the bearing of a Four-star Alchemy God.

This level of pill refinement was extremely hard to come by for him. Normally, they would not have the chance to see it at all. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Now, the Miracle Hand Parlor’s front door was directly blasted away. Everyone on the streets could also take in everything at a glance.

The spirit medicines were already in place, the two people started refining pills.

The moment it began, Deercry’s veteran and prudent side were displayed in its entirety.

Facing the Seven Aperture Quiet Enlightenment Pill, this level of spirit medicine, he controlled each step very carefully; virtually without oversights.

The bearing of a master was displayed in its entirety.

In contrast, Lu Yi’s control in all aspects were clearly not as experienced as Deercry.

When Wu Feng saw this scene, his heart settled back in place.

“Heh, Master is indeed worthy of being Master. How can he possibly be what a brat can compare to? Ye Yuan this kid let his imaginations run wild. He thinks that he’s the Medicine Ancestor, casually giving a pointer or two and he can make people advance by leaps and bounds?” Wu Feng said disdainfully.

Although Tang Rui did not know alchemy, the two people’s level could still be discerned.

“Huhu, when this competition is over, the face of Second Elder’s lineage will be lost all the until to the outer city. He’ll probably have to tuck his tail between his legs and behave for a very long period of time,” Tang Rui said with a smile.

When Ning Siyu saw the two people’s pill refinement, her face revealed a worried look and she said to Ye Yuan, “Master Ye, Eldest Senior Brother he ... doesn’t seem to be as good as that old fellow!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Relax, it just started! The things that he just learned, he still hasn’t mastered it thoroughly yet, so he’ll appear a little awkward. But he’s already done very well. At least up until now, he meets a certain standard and didn’t show major flaws.”

Talking up to here, he could not help looking at Xuan Yu and said, “Brother Xuan really has good eyesight. Have to admit, your disciples are all promising talents.”

But Xuan Yu smiled bitterly when he heard it and said, “They are all good materials, but sadly, this old man has neglected them these few years! If you were the one to teach them, probably before long, they can all surpass this old man already.”

Xuan Yu was not buttering Ye Yuan up. After witnessing Ye Yuan’s true strength, he finally understood his disparity with Ye Yuan.

This kind of disparity, he probably could not make up for it all his life.

The profundities of the Dao Realm could not be described using words at all.

He examined his heart and felt that he already walked very far along the path of alchemy. It was not to say invincible among those in the same rank, but at least in Four-star Alchemy God Realm this level, those who could surpass him were rarely-seen.

But he was simply like a pupil in front of Ye Yuan.

“Four-star Alchemy Gods are indeed all incomparably formidable! This level of pill refining means are simply mind-blowing!”

“Formidable is formidable, but that young man is clearly much lousier. Old ginger is still hotter than the new!”

“Heh, how can an initial-rank Four-star Alchemy God possibly be a middle-rank Four-star Alchemy God’s match? No matter how powerful Master Ye is, what can two hours change?”

“Mn? Something seems to be wrong! You guys, look at that Lu Yi. Some kind of change seems to have happened to him. Seems like ... he brought everything together and mastered it thoroughly.”

...

There were quite a few experts and sharp-eyed people present who discovered the change on Lu Yi’s body very quickly.

The fluster from the very beginning until now was already proceeding steadily, and actually had signs of gradually catching up to Deercry.

Wu Feng’s standard was very formidable among Three-star Alchemy Gods. This kind of change naturally could not escape his eyes.

The expression on his face gradually changed from relaxed to solemn.

Seemingly sensing Wu Feng’s change, Tang Rui asked curiously, “What is it?”

Wu Feng’s face revealed a suspicious look and he said, “Something’s wrong! It’s impossible! How can such a thing happen? Lu Yi’s speed of improvement is too fast!”

This was just refining a medicinal pill. In the process of refining a medicinal pill, it was not possible to have such a leap in improvement.

But now, this kind of impossible thing appeared in front of them.

Furthermore, Lu Yi’s improvement got faster and faster. In the end, traces of Dao accumulations actually emerged in the medicinal cauldron!

The exclamations in the crowd became stronger and stronger. The expressions on their faces became unusually fascinating.

At this time, even a fool could tell that Lu Yi’s pill refinement this time was extraordinary!

Time slowly trickled by. After five hours, it was only to hear Lu Yi giving out a loud cry, “Condense!”

All of the Dao accumulations integrated into the medicinal cauldron!

At this time, Lu Yi felt every pore on his body open up, refreshing to the extreme.

This feeling of accomplishing it in one go, he had never caught it before.

But this time, it was really realized!

Deercry had no distractions in his heart and was still dripping with sweat.

A hint of disdain flashed across in Lu Yi’s eyes and he came before Ye Yuan, bowed deeply and said, “Lu Yi thanks Master Ye’s grace of guidance very much, never forgetting till death!”
