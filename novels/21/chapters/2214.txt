Chapter 2218: If He Were to Become Emperor, Who Would Dare Disobey?!

A Heavenly Emperor was this world’s true hegemon!

The goal that every martial artist strove toward their whole lives was to become a Heavenly Emperor.

This step stumped no idea how many outstanding figures.

Just take Empyrean Pilljade for example. Was his talent not high?

Once he was the sole Ancestor Realm powerhouse of the Southern Border, how dazzling was this halo?

But even so, he was still blocked in front of the gates of Heavenly Emperor mercilessly.

Then about Empyrean Chaoyuan, who cultivated to the peak Empyrean Realm with the identity of an itinerant cultivator, how astonishing was his talent?

Moreover, he was even an extremely powerful Seven-star Alchemy God.

But likewise, he was unable to take this step.

It had already been several million years!

Also one thing, that was that ... Heavenly Emperors were not able to be created using medicinal pills!

Actually, it was not that there wasn’t such a medicinal pill, but it was that ... this medicinal pill was too hard to refine.

Even for those peak Eight-star Alchemy Gods, there were also very few that could successfully refine the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill.

But now, Ye Yuan was doing it!

Ji Mo looked at Ye Yuan setting up the formation, and the flesh on his face hurt without him being aware.

Even though it was just rank seven spirit medicines, the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill’s spirit medicines, each kind was incomparably precious and rare.

Each spirit medicine was worth a city!

In this Heavenspan World, there were really not many that could gather the spirit medicines of the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill.

It was also only because Second Sage opened his mouth to request for them. Otherwise, even if others wanted to refine it, they would also be unable to make something out of nothing!

This time, the array formations that Ye Yuan laid down were even more profound and complicated.

The refinement of the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill was seriously too difficult and profound.

However, Ye Yuan still constructed the colossal array formation methodically.

The array formation became more and more complicated, increasingly difficult to understand.

The aura coming from within the void also became more and more profound.

But the Southern Border Alliance’s Empyreans became more and more anxious.

It seemed like ... the momentum of Heavenly Eagle’s rise was already unstoppable!

“Could it be that ... this Empyrean is really going to witness a miracle? A Seven-star Alchemy God refining the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill? I never even heard of it before!”

“Sigh, comparing people is really odious! This boy is too monstrous!”

“If ... this Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill can be given to this Empyrean, how great would that be?”

... ...

The Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill, a medicinal pill that could create Heavenly Emperors, how could they not covet it?

At this time, how were they still in the mood to go and attack Heavenly Eagle?

These Empyreans, especially those at the peak, their only thought was envying Bai Tong!

At this time, they wished for time to flow backward, and they would go and suck up to Ye Yuan desperately.

As long as they obtained Ye Yuan’s recognition, perhaps they would also be able to obtain the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill. They would then step into that fleeting and ephemeral Heavenly Emperor Realm!

Inside Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, Yun Yi raised his head and looked at the sky, his expression seemingly incomparably excited.

This was the Alchemy Dao that he yearned for!

Compared to his master’s Alchemy Dao, what did mere Seven-star Alchemy Gods count for?

In front of his master, cultivation realms did not have any meaning at all!

His understanding of Alchemy Dao already glimpsed the source of the Dao.

Maybe come one day in the future, he would also be able to refine such a heaven-defying medicinal pill!

Staying in Heavenly Eagle was not the choice that he made, but a steadfast belief in his heart.

His identity was extremely sensitive. If it were others, it was absolutely impossible to take him in as an apprentice, let alone the opportunity to be imparted with various skills.

But after so many years in Heavenly Eagle, Yun Yi could clearly feel his alchemy strength advance by leaps and bounds!

This could not be faked!

Making him betray Heavenly Eagle at this time, he really could not do it.

Right at this time, on the other side, Bai Tong’s aura billowed to the sky.

His aura rose steadily up, heading straight to becoming a peak Empyrean.

When everything calmed down, Bai Tong’s entire person was like a sharp sword that came out of the sheathe, sharp edge revealing in its entirety!

Coincidentally at this moment, Ye Yuan pointed at the void and yelled out, “Formation rise, Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill, condense!”

Rumble!

Another heaven-shocking array formation’s operation.

Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill, formed!

End spirit Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill!

Southern Border Alliance that side, the Empyreans’ eyes were almost popping out.

Towards Ye Yuan’s strength, they were long already wholeheartedly convinced. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Right now, their only thought was envy!

Ye Yuan put away the medicinal pill and said to Bai Tong, “Brother Bai Tong, how do you feel?”

Bai Tong smiled and said, “Great! Indescribably great!”

The Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill already treated all of his hidden injuries. The current Bai Tong already reached his peak state in all aspects.

Breaking through currently was the most suitable!

Ye Yuan also smiled and said, “That’s good! NOw, directly refine this then!”

As he said, he handed the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill to Bai Tong.

Bai Tong refined it on the spot without another word.

Half a day later, a horrifying aura rose up.

The originally cloudless sky suddenly rolled and seethed.

The earth was quaking.

A strong wind was howling.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s structures could not withstand this pressure at all and were virtually about to collapse.

The martial artists in the city were even tottering on their feet.

A glint flashed in Ji Mo’s gaze, and he casually fired out a spell.

In an instant, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City stabilized.

The pressure of a Heavenly Emperor’s breakthrough was too great for normal martial artists!

Even these Empyreans in front of him, all of them had solemn expressions too, mustering up all the divine essence in their bodies, resisting this pressure.

However, no one left!

A Heavenly Emperor breaking through, Great Dao would descend.

This kind of lucky chance could not be encountered by everyone.

Perhaps the observation this time could let them have some harvests?

Crack, crack, crack ...

Bai Tong’s aura became grander and grander. He became increasingly stronger.

The Heavenly Emperor’s barrier was unable to stop his breakthrough at all.

Amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, Bai Tong broke through the fetters of Empyrean Realm in one go, busting through that shackle!

A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse was born domineeringly just like that!

Everyone was staring dumbfounded with their mouths agape, shocked expressions on their faces.

Empyrean Pilljade gave a bitter laugh and said, “This ... is the power of an end spirit Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill! Truly, if he were to become emperor, who would dare disobey?!”

Empyrean Windrider also sighed faintly and said, “Breaking through the shackles with Alchemy Dao, Heavenly Dao has to make some concessions too! This boy is already not what the likes of us can provoke!”

Empyrean Pilljade sighed dejectedly, knowing that what Empyrean Windrider said was not false.

Although they all, these alchemy major powers, had not seen a Heavenly Emperor breaking through before, they still knew what the breakthrough would be like.

When others broke through, they needed to shake off the fetters of Heavenly Dao countless times, struggling to free themselves from the shackles of Empyrean Realm.

Breaking through was fighting with heaven, fighting with earth, fighting with oneself!

But Bai Tong’s breakthrough was extremely domineering.

Have obstructions, directly burst through!

Have fetter, directly chop off!

The momentum of becoming a Heavenly Emperor, even heaven and earth was unable to stop it!

This kind of breakthrough, the impact was too strong.

Bai Tong stood in the air. Looking at this world again, it was as if everything changed colors.

“Turns out that the world is like this!” Bai Tong could not resist letting out an emotional sigh.

Suddenly, the aura on his body released. A horrifying pressure spread out, spreading across the entire sky.

Heavenly Emperor pressure!

Bai Tong’s gaze turned sharp. Sweeping across the sky, he said coldly, “From this day forth, this Heavenly Emperor will garrison Heavenly Eagle, forming the Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma! All of the Southern Border’s alchemy matters will be controlled by the Heavenly Eagle’s Pill Tower! Whoever isn’t convinced, feel free to come and find this Heavenly Emperor!”
