Chapter 1321: Sharing Weal and Woe

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At the Wang Family manor, Wang Lingbo’s face was filled with dark clouds.

He did not expect that Fourth Elder personally making a move actually failed to kill Ye Yuan!

About Fourth Elder’s strength, he was all too clear.

Even though Luo Jian was known as the Myriad Treasure Tower’s number one swordsman, in front of Fourth Elder, it was completely not enough to look at.

However, Fourth Elder actually failed!

If he did not wait until those two people came, then forget it. But Fourth Elder actually turned to the family to request for help. That explained that they had definitely exchanged blows before.

The result was that those two people ran away!

This matter was definitely very troublesome. Otherwise, Fourth Elder absolutely would not turn to the family to ask for help.

It was just that Wang Lingbo could not figure it out no matter what, a Luo Jian plus a Ye Yuan, on what basis to be able to make it so difficult for Fourth Elder?

“Lingbo, what are you finding the two of us old fellows for?”

A lean elder walked into. That was the Wang Family’s second elder, Wang Yutao.

Behind him even followed a person. It was precisely the Wang Family’s third elder, Wang Yumin.

These two people were similarly grand completion Grotto Profound experts. Their strengths were even a notch above Wang Yugan’s.

The moment Wang Lingbo saw the two people, he recounted Ye Yuan’s affairs in haste.

“Uncles, if we allow this child to carry on growing, it will likely be very hard for my Wang Family to have a foothold in Jewelhill City anymore. Uncles, please take action. You must cut this boy down in the Yin Wind Den,” Wang Lingbo said with a solemn expression.

Hearing the sequence of events of the matter, Wang Yutao also had a solemn expression as he said, “Even though our Jewelhill City is Heavenly Emperor FuFeng’s territory, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure’s fame is too great. We can suppress the Myriad Treasure Tower and fight for the greatest benefits, but we can’t really lose all decorum with them. But this Ye Yuan indeed can’t be left alive! This time, it’s the best time to kill him.”

Wang Lingbo nodded and said, “I think so as well! Once he returns to Jewelhill City, or Yang Rui learns about this matter, we’d have no way of making a move anymore!”

Wang Yutao said, “Old Third, let’s go through the trouble and make a trip, and eliminate this troublesome fellow for the Wang Family!”

“I’ll listen to Second Brother.” Wang Yumin did not say much and was concise to the point.

...

“Heh,

are you dead? Sit up and let me take a look if you didn’t die!”

Seeing Luo Jian open both eyes, a large rock in Ye Yuan’s heart finally landed.

Experiencing life and death, Ye Yuan also lowered his guard towards Luo Jian. When talking, it also became much more casual.

He knew that Luo Jian was already not in jeopardy. That was why he would talk like that.

Currently, a month’s time already passed since leaving the city.

In order to treat Luo Jian’s injuries, Ye Yuan expended a huge price.

The divine-grade healing medicinal pills that he refined were also pretty much depleted.

The effects of low-grade Tier 1 healing divine pills were still a little minor on Luo Jian’s wounds.

Hence, Ye Yuan could only use numbers to make up for it.

Fortunately, Ye Yuan was full of divine-grade medicinal pills on him. The medicinal effects were very strong. That was how it saved Luo Jian’s life.

If it were others, being so seriously injured, they would die without a doubt.

Luo Jian gritted his teeth and forced himself to sit up, looking at Ye Yuan in amazement.

“It was you who saved me?”

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “Are there still others here?”

“But my injuries ...”

Luo Jian was very clear about his injuries. When he suffered grievous injuries with Wang Yugan back then, he already harbored the resolve to die.

He wanted to severely wound Wang Yugan with death as the price and create an opportunity for Ye Yuan to escape. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said half-jokingly, “Between you and I shouldn’t have that kind of life-and-death relationship yet, right? You just stupidly perish together with him?”

Luo Jian said, “I owe Tower Lord a life. He made me protect you at all costs. If I die, this life will be returned to him!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “Is your life so worthless? Now, you’ve also died earlier already, and then I’ve helped you return your life to him!”

Luo Jian choked, faintly sensing that something was not quite right, but did not know how he should refute.

This time, he had indeed made a trip to and from the gates of hell. Ye Yuan’s words had no problem, it just sounded somewhat weird.

“Huhu, making a joke, don’t think that much. Your injuries have just healed, you still need lots of rest. But we’ve already delayed a very long time. We can only grudgingly get on the road,” Ye Yuan patted his shoulders and said smilingly.

Ye Yuan knew that this guy was an enigma. Beating with a bamboo pole could not force anything out; very boring.

But this guy was indeed loyal enough, putting his own life on the line for a favor back then.

This kind of person was worth getting to know.

Luo Jian frowned and said, “You saved me, then what about that Wang Yugan?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “He isn’t injured lightly too. But to recover his strength, it’s got to take more than half a month too. At this time, he might already be on the way to the Yin Wind Den to block us.”

Luo Jian’s gaze turned intent, keenly catching some information from Ye Yuan’s words.

He knew the power of his sword. Even though powerful, it was absolutely not fatal.

Resting for a few days, and it was basically able to recover already.

But Ye Yuan said that he required over half a month’s time to recuperate!

Could it be that his sword stabbed a critical point?

Or ... it was caused by Ye Yuan?

Thinking back, he was penetrated on the long spear. If Ye Yuan did not make a move, it was absolutely impossible to save him.

Luo Jian was taken aback with fright by this judgment of his!

Even if Wang Yugan was severely injured by him, he was also absolutely not what Ye Yuan could hurt.

However, what was going on?

An initial-stage Grotto Profound was able to harm grand completion Grotto Profound?

Luo Jian instantly felt that he was somewhat flustered.

“Hey, thinking about what?” Ye Yuan patted the dazed Luo Jian.

Luo Jian abruptly startled awake, but said, “Our mounts were already killed by Wang Yugan, how to go?”

Ye Yuan said smilingly, “That’s easy. You wait here for me, I’ll be right back!”

Ye Yuan’s figure moved rapidly, vanishing in Luo Jian’s vision in a blink of an eye.

Around an hour’s time passed, Luo Jian was suddenly startled. Dust was kicking up in the distance. Two powerful auras were rushing over to this side.

These two auras were the auras of divine beasts!

Luo Jian had long discovered that this place was adjacent to the Myriad Beast Forest. It was all too normal to have divine beasts run out.

In his current state, it was impossible to deal with a divine beast.

Luo Jian was just about to turn tail and run, but suddenly discovered that one a demonic beast, a person was actually riding there!

Ye Yuan!

This guy used an hour and tamed two divine beasts?

Luo Jian’s eyeballs stared like wide-saucers. He did not think that the method Ye Yuan said was actually this!

These were two Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard, their speed extremely swift, arriving in front of Luo Jian in a blink of an eye.

One of the Cloudsoul Sound Rending Leopard was precisely that one that besieged Ye Yuan the last time.

Only then, did Luo Jian suddenly recall that Ye Yuan had once said before whatever beast taming art at the Wang Family!

At that back, Ye Yuan even revealed dragon pressure.

This way, the dragon race bloodline in Ye Yuan’s body must be exceptionally powerful!

Luo Jian suddenly discovered that the secrets on Ye Yuan were seriously too many!

“Heh, one each. They are much more convenient to work with than the flying dragon colts!” Ye Yuan said with a loud laugh
