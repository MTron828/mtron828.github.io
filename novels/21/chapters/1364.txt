Chapter 1368: No Longer Sensational

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ouch! You beast dare to headbutt me, I’ll headbutt you!”

While talking, Little Fatty’s figure dashed and really headbutted over.

That divine beast was directly knocked flying by Little Fatty, immediately knocking down a large swarm.

When Xie Jingyi saw this, he could not help laughing delightedly and said, “Haha, who asked you to provoke your Grandpa Xie! Now, you know my prowess! Goodness, here again!”

Honestly, if Ye Yuan was here, he would probably get a huge shock too.

Although this Little Fatty did not have many powerful martial techniques, his movement technique was first-rate.

Shutting back and forth inside the beast horde, those divine beasts actually could not catch him.

Just now, he got accidentally bumped by a divine beast, he immediately retaliated.

This was already the ninth wave. The level of the divine beasts had long been raised to middle-stage One-star already.

One shouldn’t look at how the ranks of the divine beasts were not high. The numbers were very alarming, totally unable to kill completely.

Especially after a few waves, after the realms of the divine beasts increased to middle-stage One-star, the martial artists’ pressure would suddenly soar.

However, Little Fatty relied on the advantage of movement technique and still had plenty more room to maneuver until now.

“Heh heh, Ye Yuan that punk definitely can’t imagine that I, Xie Jingyi, would be so relaxed this round, right?” Little Fatty said as he laughed smugly.

...

“This position of top dog, I’m claiming it! This round, I must break the records and shake them off far behind!” Qin Shao said and gritted his teeth.

Qin Shao was the Qin Family’s this generation’s top talent. He was Qin Peiyu’s cousin, but he was only the son of a concubine. His status in the Qin Family was not high.

The Qin Family brimmed with talents. He relied on his talent to charge out of the heavy encirclement and became the Qin Family’s this generation’s number one genius.

In the Qin Family, this kind of large family clan, the competition among the younger generation was very brutal.

Even right now, he and Su Yuecang three people were simultaneously called Wu Meng Four Young Masters, but even so, his status in the Qin Family was far inferior to the others.

Because above him, in the Wu Meng Academy, there were still several formidable foes.

The Wu Meng Four Young Masters were merely squabbles in front of family clans.

Therefore, he wanted to astound the world in a single brilliant feat in the entrance examination this time, and overpower the other geniuses, becoming the top dog.

That way, he could truly enter the Qin Family’s nucleus.

It was only to see Qin Shao’s sword moving boldly and unconstrained, akin to a no-man zone in the beast horde, his strength overwhelming!

That youth called Ye Yuan can’t be underestimated. Even if I really get top dog, I absolutely can’t lower my guard too! Although his current strength isn’t strong, once he enters the Wu Meng Academy, he might very likely catch up and surpass his seniors! Qin Shao thought to himself.

Ye Yuan’s performance in the first round made him feel tremendous pressure.

Su Yuecang and the rest were indeed his competitors. But those people’s potentials, he more or less knew a little.

But Ye Yuan’s first round’s performance was too astonishing, exhibiting limitless potential.

If Ye Yuan could successfully pass through the three levels, he might become a formidable opponent in the future.

One had to know that Wu Meng Academy was not just a stay of one or two years. Within a thousand years in the future, they had to all study here!

Such a long time, no one would know what kind of variable would happen too.

...

Ye Yuan discovered that he could still cheat!

Maybe this could not be called cheating, but it was his specialty as an alchemist.

Facing these divine beasts with grand completion Grotto Profound Realm, he did not need to expend much divine essence.

With his exquisite control over divine essence, his survivability greatly increased compared to other martial artists.

This round, what they competed in was not how many enemies killed.

But ... survival!

The tidewater-like divine beasts, even if the realm was any lower, it was a considerable pressure to same realm martial artists too.

To be able to charge out from the first round, they could be said to all be geniuses among geniuses.

Their strengths were a notch above others to begin with.

If it were ordinary martial artists, being able to survive three or four waves was already considered very impressive.

Ye Yuan’s exquisite control over divine essence could let him slay even more divine beasts with the least divine essence.

Ye Yuan’s combat experience was very rich, far from what others could compare to.

Walking all the way from the Immortal Grove World, the battles that he had seen before, other geniuses had not seen before at all.

This degree of slaughtering was nothing to him.

Of course, Ye Yuan’s greatest drawback was his martial technique.

Although the Vast Heaven Sword Art was pretty good, compared to Qin Shao, those geniuses who walked out of large families, it had inherent deficiencies.

This point, Ye Yuan experienced it very soon in battle.

At the 20th wave, all of the divine beasts’ strength went up another stage, all becoming late-stage One-star!

Immediately, Ye Yuan felt the pressure on him soar sharply. Divine essence consumption speed also accelerated significantly.

This 20th wave is indeed extraordinary. There are probably quite a number of people that will fall at this level, right? Ye Yuan estimated it over in his mind.

In reality, only 30% was able to hang on until the 20th wave, just less than 2000 people!

Not every person could save divine essence like Ye Yuan, expending until now.

Even so, such a high intensity consumption, his divine essence was running low too.

“Starting now, there will be array formation cooperation among divine beasts! Each round passed will add 10 points!”

The moment the 20th wave passed, that ethereal voice sounded out once more.

Then, a large wave of divine beasts struck!

It was just that this time, they no longer rampaged around wildly like before.

Among each other, there was some order.

Seeing this, Ye Yuan felt his head hurt, and he said with a bitter smile, “Looks like Earth Carnage this round can’t earn much points!”

Ye Yuan used all his power and even used the Voice of the Dragon God in the end, finally stopping at the 23rd wave regretfully.

Under the cooperation of several dozen divine beasts, Ye Yuan was trampled into minced meat in the end.

His consciousness abruptly withdrew, returning into his body.

“Ye Yuan, cleared 23 rounds, obtaining 30 points. Total points, 120!” announced the old man on the platform directly.

When everyone saw this scene, they all heaved a long sigh in relief.

“Scared me to death! I even thought that this guy will defy the heavens all the way!”

“Looking at it now, it’s also just that his Martial Dao willpower is a little firmer. His true strength is still far off!”

“Mm, this round’s performance not being good shows that his overall strength can’t make it.”

“What the entrance examination tests focus on are overall strength. Adding together the results of the three rounds is the final benchmark to judge a person’s potential.”

...

As the sole middle-stage Grotto Profound among the people left, Ye Yuan’s every action and movement naturally attracted much attention.

But very clearly, his dazzling light did not last.

Ye Yuan’s performance this round was not astonishing. It could even be said to be at the bottom. This made Ye Yuan much less of a topic of conversation. These people naturally lost interested in him too.

Hence, everyone’s focal point was placed on the top dog this time.

Very soon, Xie Jingyi’s consciousness also returned to his body.

Seeing the old man announce Little Fatty’s results, Ye Yuan was extremely shocked too.

This guy actually made it to the 25th wave, obtaining 50 points!

When he came to the waiting area and saw Ye Yuan, he said smugly, “Haha, this time, this bro beat you, right? Looking at your expression, Lord Fatty, I, am enjoying it very much!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
