Chapter 1632 Taking on an Onerous Task

the immortal binding rope sprawled out, directly pulling the origin magnetic divine mountain inside.

gao yuan was overjoyed, mustering up all the essence energy in his body, and pulled with all his strength!

he totally thought that with his divine essence plus the power of the immortal binding rope, this celestial deity mystic treasure, he could absolutely pull the origin magnetic divine mountain over.

however, in the next instant, he only felt a tremendous force transmit over.

the origin magnetic divine mountain did not budge an inch, but because he used too much strength, he was directly jerked in the direction of the origin magnetic divine mountain.

“puhwark!”

using excessive force all at once and advancing too much distance forward, the horrifying forcefield instantly crushed him, spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood.

gao yuan was already injured considerably. now, his injuries piled on.

fortunately, the distance that he advanced was not too far, it was not to the extent of making the three people break away from his control.

“hahaha ... i was wondering how capable you were! after messing around for half a day, it’s also like drawing water with a sieve!” ka suo laughed wildly and said.

song yu suffered a big loss and already hated gao yuan to the extreme. he also grinned hideously and said, “idiots are idiots! what kind of weight does the origin magnetic divine mountain have? not refining it, nobody can think about bringing it away! even if another ten of you came, you can’t budge this kind of precious treasure too!”

gao yuan crawled up rather difficultly, feeling like his innards had shifted positions, his bones almost snapping.

the forcefield here was too strong. he did not dare to stay too long and wanted to withdraw and think of a way again.

facing the three people’s mocking, gao yuan did not care.

he grasped the advantage right now and did not fear these three people at all.

the immortal binding rope already broke free from his hand. gao yuan was just planning on summoning it back when suddenly, his gaze turned intent!

a figure appeared out of thin air, blocking the direction that the immortal binding rope was returning. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

swoosh!

the immortal binding rope flashed and disappeared, directly disappearing!

gao yuan’s shock was by no means insignificant. he desperately sensed for the immortal binding rope, frantically urging his spells, attempting to summon the immortal binding rope back.

but the immortal binding rope was akin to a clay ox entering the sea. he was unable to sense it in the slightest anymore.

that person looked at gao yuan and said with a faint smile, “this rope looks pretty good, i’ll accept it.”

gao yuan opened his eyes wide, his eyes full of disbelief as he yelled furiously, “ye yuan, return the immortal binding rope to me! otherwise, this old man will make you die without a burial ground!”

ye yuan looked at him like he was looking at an idiot. he said with a smile, “is your head spoiled? this little lord took your stuff, and you still want it back?”

when ka suo trio saw the ye yuan who suddenly appeared, they were shocked until they could not close their mouths for a long time.

especially ka suo, he had an expression like he had seen a ghost on his face.

he was all too clear about the power of that palm of his. forget about an origin deity realm, even middle-stage divine lord realm powerhouses would also die until not even residue remained.

but now, ye yuan actually appeared in front of him without a scratch!

“this ... how is this possible? how ... how is he completely fine?” ka suo said with an astounded look.

“this kid is too sinister! just now, no idea what method he used either, he actually directly swallowed up the immortal binding rope!” song yu said with an ugly expression.

“something’s wrong! with his strength, how can he possibly stand in the 2000 feet place?” lei yi said in a solemn voice.

song yu’s expression changed and he had a foreboding premonition in his heart, and said in a solemn voice, “this origin magnetic field is already sufficient to surpass spatial laws. even if he comprehended second-layered heaven spatial laws, it’s also not possible to show up in this place currently! just what methods do this kid still have?”

ka suo suddenly thought of a possibility and exclaimed, “this boy’s goal wouldn’t be the origin magnetic divine mountain, right?”

at this time, ye yuan suddenly turned to look at ka suo and said with a smile, “congratulations, you answered correctly! originally, i wasn’t too interested in this origin magnetic divine mountain. but since you guys can’t obtain it, then this little lord will reluctantly accept it.”

the moment these words came out, the three people’s expressions suddenly changed.

song yu said with a suspicious look, “impossible! your bit of strength, you’ll be crushed into minced meat by the forcefield!”

the other two did not speak, but the expressions on their faces clearly had the same thought as song yu.

ye yuan smiled and said, “oh? is that so? not trying, who knows?”

finished talking, ye yuan slowly walked over towards the origin magnetic divine mountain.

four people looked at ye yuan, their eyes full of shock.

amidst such a powerful forcefield, but ye yuan strolled idly like in a courtyard like he could not feel the existence of the pressure in the slightest.

one had to know, even ka suo the three of them also suffered tremendous pressure when walking until 2000 feet, struggling to stride forward.

as for gao yuan, it went even more without saying.

if he entered the 3000 feet region, he would probably be pressed into minced meat sauce.

“impossible! this is impossible! how ... how can he withstand such a horrifying origin magnetic field?” ka suo said in shock.

song yu’s expression also flickered incessantly and he gritted his teeth and said, “the secrets on this boy’s body are too many, with his means emerging in endless streams, impossible to guard against at all! who could have thought that it was actually him who would have the last laugh?”

lei yi’s expression was very ugly as he said with a cold snort, “whoever has the last laugh isn’t determined yet! right now, it’s merely a distance of 2000 feet, the closer to the origin magnetic divine mountain, the more terrifying the origin magnetic field. i don’t believe that he can walk until the end!”

the other two people also secretly nodded their heads when they heard that.

what lei yi said was right, they only walked to the 800 feet distance and it was already as heavy as a tall mountain. the vicinity of the origin magnetic divine mountain was definitely horrifying until it was unimaginable.

they did not believe that ye yuan could keep going like this.

the four people stared with big eyes, looking at ye yuan slowly walk over just like this.

2000 feet, 1500 feet, 1000 feet, 800 feet!

ye yuan walked at a very uniform speed. before long, he was already shoulder to shoulder with song yu and the others.

when the three people saw ye yuan walk to 800 feet with such ease, their hearts sunk to rock bottom.

“no way! we definitely can’t give this lucky chance to this punk! otherwise, it will be akin to adding wings to a tiger for this boy!”

the pressure that ye yuan gave him was truly too great.

at this time, whatever celestial deity realm was no use at all!

ye yuan walked past the three people, his gaze faintly swept over ka suo as he said with a smile, “you wait, our score will be settled properly!”

ka suo was stared at by ye yuan until his heart beat wildly. this boy was actually threatening him!

but he was not worried about ye yuan killing him right now. even though ye yuan’s strength rivaled first-layered heaven divine lord, this was still too weak to him.

with the strength of his fleshy body, even if he stood there and let a first-layered heaven divine lord kill, the first-layered heaven divine lord could not touch him in the slightest too.

ye yuan was different from gao yuan, gao yuan was originally a half-step celestial deity powerhouse. even though he had his realm suppressed, his offensive strength was very powerful. his threat towards the three was very great.

but ye yuan was merely an origin deity martial artist in the end.

ye yuan himself also understood this point, hence, he did not make a move.

“punk, you don’t get cocky! when this old man breaks free, the first one i’m killing is you!” ka suo gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

ye yuan smiled and said, “if you can really kill me, would i still be standing here? therefore, you’d best pray. pray that i grow slower. this way, you can live longer.”
