Chapter 2162: You have an Objection?

Ao Xu’s demise set off a huge shock in Purpledragon Stronghold.

No one would have thought that Ao Xu was actually really the main culprit behind Bandit Xiao!

Those who were still mocking previously, the dragons who were ridiculing Ye Yuan, they were all silent and said nothing at this time.

Only at this time did they suddenly come to realize the truth that Ye Yuan did not turn angry from embarrassment at all. There was no bewilderment at all.

He really had a well-thought-out plan and dug a pit waiting for Ao Xu to jump!

A little fellow actually scammed a Heavenly Emperor to death, this kind of thing was truly inconceivable.

“Turns out that Ao Xu was really the main culprit behind Bandit Xiao, we wronged Ye Yuan!”

“Sigh, if Ao Xu really remained beyond the arm of the law, then we’d all be accessory to a tyrant’s crimes!”

“For so many years, the various major black strongholds and earth strongholds all have their entire beings shaking when mentioning Xiao. Today, everyone can finally heave a sigh in relief.”

“Yeah, we all have to thank Dragon Son Ye. He did something that even the dragon lord could not accomplish!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

... ...

There were also quite a number of people who knew their error and had an appearance of lingering fear in their hearts.

But toward Ye Yuan, everyone felt quite indebted toward Ye Yuan.

These few years, in order to kill Long Xiao this group of people, Purpledragon Stronghold could be said to have suffered heavy casualties.

Ye Yuan’s action achieved the greatest good.

“Dragon Son Ye, it was all thanks to you this time, otherwise, this lord wouldn’t have known how long this traitor has been hoodwinking all of us!” Dragon Lord Ao Zhen said with clasped hands.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Dragon Lord, you don’t need to be like this. Actually, you also had suspicions toward Ao Xu, isn’t that so? This time, you merely pushed the boat along the current.”

Ao Xu put in painstaking effort, wanting to prop Ao Yu up to a high position.

While he could also seize this opportunity and soar to the sky with one bound, or even ascend to the position of a dragon lord.

How could Ao Zhen not know these thoughts?

It was just that he did think that Ao Xu actually concealed so deeply, colluding with wicked bandits in secret and plagued a region, causing Purpledragon Stronghold to not know peace.

And Ye Yuan’s incident this time was merely an opportunity to erupt.

Ao Zhen looked at Ye Yuan meaningfully and said with a smile, “Dragon Son Ye has a meticulous mind and outstanding talent. You’ll surely have great accomplishments in the future! The journey to Heavenly Dragon Mountain this time, this lord wishes Dragon Son Ye speedy success!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I thank Dragon Lord for your auspicious blessings! Dragon Lord, this Ye has a presumptuous request. I hope that dragon lord will agree to it.”

Ao Zhen’s two eyes narrowed and he said, “You want Long Xiao?”

Talking with smart people saved energy.

Ye Yuan nodded his head, it was considered to have tacitly agreed to it.

Ao Zhen shook his head and said, “The crimes that Long Xiao has committed these few years are too numerous to be recorded! Not killing him, it will be insufficient to appease the fury of the masses!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “State your terms then!”

Ao Zhen laughed in spite of himself and said, “You little baby, really give people a headache! Want Long Xiao, you have to represent Purpledragon Stronghold in the Battle of Dragon Sons this time and take the top spot!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Deal!”

Ao Zhen smiled and said, “You seem very confident.”

Ye Yuan similarly smiled and said, “Don’t you have a lot of faith in me? Otherwise, you should have said these words to Ao Yu.”

Although Ao Xu died, this did not affect Ao Yu’s status in Purpledragon Stronghold.

The level of Sons of the Heavenly Dragon was far from heaven strongholds but at the Heavenly Dragon Mountain!

To the dragon lord, their eyes were also set on the Heavenly Dragon Mountain.

That place was the Dragon Clan’s true holy land!

Ye Yuan understood Ao Zhen’s request very well.

As long as he won the top spot, Heavenly Dragon Mountain would bestow many precious resources.

At that time, Ao Zhen would have hopes of assaulting late-stage Heavenly Emperor Realm, and he would become a true major power existence.

Of course, he would also finally have the qualifications to enter Heavenly Dragon Mountain!

As for whatever Long Xiao, in the eyes of powerhouses like Ao Zhen, he was just an inconsequential crawling bug, what has his life or death got to do with him?

Although this East Suppression Pseudo World was the Dragon Clan’s territory, it was also not a land of great unity.

The Dragon Clan was indeed powerful, but if there were no conflicts and no competition, they would similarly decline.

Hence, among the various major heaven strongholds and earth strongholds, there were endless disputes too.

And Long Xiao this kind of existence was merely some flavor enhancer.

If Ao Zhen personally took action, wouldn’t capturing a puny little Long Xiao still be easily accomplished?

It was just that he was disdainful to do it.

... ...

At the Heavenly Dragon Mountain, clouds coiled up, immortal qi lingering, it was not like what the mortal world should have.

Arriving at the foot of Heavenly Dragon Mountain, Ye Yuan only felt like it was like facing the Heavenspan Mountain, giving people an unfathomable feeling.

Only when one’s strength reached Seventh Firmament Heavenly Emperor and became a late-stage Heavenly Emperor supreme powerhouse did one have the qualifications to be called a Heavenly Dragon and enter Heavenly Dragon Mountain!

This place was where the true nucleus of the Dragon Clan was. It was the Dragon Clan’s paramount totem.

Seeing such power and influence, Ye Yuan could not help being shocked in his heart.

Being able to open up such a powerful pseudo world, the Dragon Clan’s power and foundation were truly unfathomable.

“Heh, like a bumpkin, saw the Heavenly Dragon Mountain and got stunned, right?” Ao Yu’s mocking voice came from the back.

“Outsider bumpkin, probably haven’t even entered a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda before. How could he have seen before the Heavenly Dragon Mountain’s magnificence!” Ao Zhong also said with a scornful look.

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept across the two people’s faces and said with a light smile, “Endure the whole way, finally can’t hold back anymore, right? Ao Yu, I did away with your second uncle. You could actually endure until now, this Ye admires.”

Ao Yu’s face turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Ye Yuan, don’t you get cocky! The Battle of Dragon Sons this time will be the battle where you fall!”

Ye Yuan could not help laughing when he heard it and said, “Why would I not be cocky? I want to be cocky! I killed a Heavenly Emperor, such a refreshing thing is sufficient for me to be arrogant for ten thousand years! In the future, I’ll tell everyone I meet that I ended a Heavenly Emperor, and that person was your, Ao Yu’s, second uncle! Do you have an objection?”

“Pfft!” The Long Xiaochun by the side could not hold back anymore and snickered.

Ye Yuan this fellow really did not use a word of vulgarity when trolling people.

Looking at Ao Yu’s face, it practically turned green.

The resources that Ao Xu had secretly gotten for so many years, the vast majority were all used on Ao Yu. Therefore, he regarded Ao Xu, his second uncle, highly.

Now, Ye Yuan kept babbling on about how he dispatched his second uncle, it was equivalent to tearing at his scar, showing off his cleverness after coming off cheap. How could it not enrage him?

Ao Yu gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Good! Very good! Ye Yuan, looks like you won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin! There’s lots of time. You won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Even your second uncle, this Heavenly Emperor, was finished off by me. So who the hell are you? You’re not qualified enough to threaten me yet!”

Ao Yu was angered until his face was livid and he said with a cold sneer, “Huhu! Although I don’t know what scheme or trick you used, Long Xiao is absolutely not who you can subdue! The Battle of Dragon Sons, what it relies on is all genuine ability! Want to resort to trickery? No chance! You just wait to suffer my wrath!”

Indeed, for Ye Yuan to be able to subdue Long Xiao and his gang, he had the advantage of the terrain.

If not for that area of spatial rifts being extremely unstable, it would have been impossible for Ye Yuan to want to trap Long Xiao to death.

Let alone force Long Xiao to surrender.

“Is that so? Then your wrath, it has to be a little more fierce. I’m afraid that ... it’s not enough to whet my appetite,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Toward Ao Yu’s threat, Ye Yuan did not take it seriously.

With his current strength, even when facing off against a Third Firmament Empyrean, he also had the ability to protect himself.

Ao Yu was merely a peak Second Firmament Empyrean, Ye Yuan did not take him seriously.

What he truly minded were those Third Firmament Empyrean Sons of the Heavenly Dragon!
