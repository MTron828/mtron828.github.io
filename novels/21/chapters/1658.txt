1662 Three-Lives Nirvana Seal

Seemingly making an extremely great resolution, Mo Lifei reached his hand out toward the void and beckoned.

Ning Tianping was currently desperately trying to reach a star, but all of a sudden, he seemed to be sucked away by a black hole, immediately disappearing.

When he appeared again, he was already in front of Mo Lifei and Ye Yuan.

“Y-Your Excellency, what’s going on here?” Ning Tianping said with a baffled look.

This existence in front of him gave him an extremely terrifying sense of oppression. That kind of power made even his soul shudder.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This senior feels that you’re pretty talented and wants to take you in as a disciple. Hence, he summoned you here.”

Ning Tianping was dazed and said in surprise, “Take me in as a disciple? Your Excellency, shouldn’t it be taking you in as a disciple?”

“He has another teacher and is already not suitable to be my disciple anymore! This seat wants to take you in as a disciple right now. Are you willing?” Mo Lifei suddenly said.

“O-Of course I’m willing!” Ning Tianping blurted out.

Got to be joking! A True God powerhouse wanting to take him in as a disciple, this was a great lucky chance! So how could he possibly refuse?

Mo Lifei said in a solemn voice, “Obtaining my legacy, you have to take revenge for this seat. Are you willing?”

Ning Tianping’s gaze turned intent and involuntarily looked over towards Ye Yuan. Only after getting Ye Yuan’s affirmation did he nod and say, “Disciple is willing!”

Mo Lifei reached his hand out and beckoned. That cluster of starry star vortex turned into several light dots and flew over. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“These few things are Master’s legacy items!” Mo Lifei said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan looked over, only to see those few dots of starlight turn into several treasures.

A cultivation method, two martial techniques, as well as several medicinal pills!

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up, looking at one of the martial techniques, revealing a look of interest.

Mo Lifei said, “This Starry Night Vast Cloud Art is a peak rank six cultivation method. It is sufficient for you to cultivate to become a peak True God. These two sets of martial techniques, one of them is called Starmoon Life u0026 Death Sword, and the other is called Three-Lives Nirvana Seal! Especially this Three-Lives Nirvana Seal, it’s exceedingly profound and hard to learn. Master only comprehended until the second level seal art back then. This set of seal art is divided into a total of three seals. They are respectively Nirvana Seal, Life u0026 Death Seal, and Six Paths of Reincarnation Seal. Cultivating to the limit, one can sweep across those in the same rank, jumping realms to battle will be a cinch!”

Hearing Mo Lifei’s introduction, Ning Tianping was excited until his heart was virtually about to jump out.

Although he had not cultivated it yet, the power of these few things, he could completely sense it.

Especially this Three-Lives Nirvana Seal, it seemed to even transcend the scope of True God. It could be said to have boundless power.

With these few cultivation methods and martial techniques, the tiny little Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was no longer able to constrain him.

He was going to spread his wings, soar high, and venture into this outside world!

“Senior, this set of Three-Lives Nirvana Seal, can you borrow this junior to take a look?” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

He felt that this martial technique was very extraordinary and was very interested in it.

A conflicted look appeared on Mo Lifei’s face, but he still nodded and said, “Take it and see then.”

Ye Yuan cupped his fists and said, “Many thanks, Senior!”

In front of Ning Tianping, Ye Yuan behaved very humble toward Mo Lifei.

After all, from today onward, Mo Lifei was Ning Tianping’s master. He did not want to let Ning Tianping have any misunderstanding.

However, Mo Lifei was clearly very wary of Ye Yuan.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s request, he naturally had no reason to not satisfy it.

Mo Lifei reached his hand out and pushed. The Three-Lives Nirvana Seal arrived in front of Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan revealed a curious look, divine sense prying into it, and started inspecting.

Mo Lifei did not pay attention to Ye Yuan and continued saying to Ning Tianping, “Your talent is pretty good, but the cultivation method that you cultivate is a little too low-grade. Master will help you refine the cultivation method right now and let you change it to the Starry Night Vast Cloud Art.”

Ning Tianping said excitedly, “Many thanks, Master!”

Although Mo Lifei was a wisp of remnant soul, his means were clearly very powerful.

He started to guide Ning Tianping little by little and refined his divine essence anew according to the Starry Night Vast Cloud Art’s method.

In the process of refining, Mo Lifei also nodded slightly.

This disciple that Ye Yuan recommended, while still barely satisfactory, was indeed a moldable talent.

...

Ye Yuan suddenly felt like he was situated in hell, his entire person’s life force rapidly dissipating.

“This is the Nirvana Seal? Tempering and advancing, nirvanic rebirth! This set of seal art is so profound!” Ye Yuan said emotionally.

Ye Yuan immersed in the seal art, reminiscing his previous life and current life, these 1000 years, and actually had a feeling of great enlightenment.

Wasn’t his life a life of nirvanic rebirth?

How many times of facing despair, and also how many years of relying on his own efforts; nirvanic rebirth.

Amidst this profound divine inscription, Ye Yuan’s consciousness became more and more empty and finally resulted in a quiescence.

“Mn?” Mo Lifei was currently guiding Ning Tianping to refine his divine essence when he suddenly felt that Ye Yuan’s life force was currently rapidly disappearing.

“This kid actually wants to forcefully comprehend the Nirvana Seal, he’s courting death here!”

Mo Lifei turned pale with fright and was about to go and interrupt Ye Yuan’s comprehension.

“Master!” Ning Tianping hurriedly shouted.

“Mn?” Mo Lifei looked at Ning Tianping doubtfully.

Ning Tianping said, “Master rest assured, His Excellency won’t mess around! His Excellency’s talent is hundreds, thousands of times better than mine. Even if the comprehension fails, there won’t be any danger to his life too. Let him be.”

Mo Lifei laughed in spite of himself and said, “Do you really think that a True God Realm skill is so simple? If it is that simple, don’t know how many people in this world can break through to become a True God already.”

But Ning Tianping said firmly, “I don’t know about others, but ... His Excellency definitely can! Spatial laws are known as the supreme laws that are the hardest to comprehend in this world. But His Excellency only used a hundred years’ time and comprehended two layers of heaven!”

Mo Lifei’s gaze turned sharp, incomparably shocked in his heart.

As a True God powerhouse, he was clearer than others how difficult spatial laws were to comprehend.

This kid in front of him actually only used a hundred years’ time and comprehended two layers of heaven?

Was this a joke?

Just as he was in shock, the Ye Yuan who originally already returned to quiescence, his aura suddenly became strong.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan abruptly snapped open his eyes and flagrantly fired out a seal!

Rumble ...

The entire region of starry sky started trembling. The stars in the distance suddenly became dim!

“W-What happened?”

“Could it be that this stretch of space is going to collapse?”

“Q-Quickly run!”

...

The Divine Lord Realm powerhouses who were still outside choosing treasures, after seeing this scene, each and every one of them was frightened until they turned deathly pale.

Once the space collapsed, they would have to be buried inside.

Even if it was just a wisp of divine sense, it would cause tremendous damage to their main body too. Wanting to break through in the future would no longer be possible.

Mo Lifei’s gaze revealed a panic-stricken look as he said in shock, “C-Comprehended! I spent several thousand years before comprehending this first seal. He only used this short while and is already at grand completion?”

Yes, this first seal of the Nirvana Seal, Ye Yuan already fully mastered it, cultivating to the realm of grand completion!
