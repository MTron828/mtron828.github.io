Chapter 1434 A Bunch of Cannon Fodders

“It’s him?” Dustless was also somewhat surprised as he said.

“The rumor that spread last time, everybody said that it was done by the Autumn Rain Sacred Palace. However, that doesn’t conform to common sense! The most logical situation should be that somebody knows my identity and wants to put me to death! Previously, I was only suspecting. Now, already his aura has changed drastically, I’m very certain that he’s Qin Tian!” Ye Yuan said.

Dustless came to a realization and said, “Looking at it this way, it really is so! Looks like Wu Meng Academy that side is really unreliable!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Our city lord is really indulgent enough toward the Qin Family!”

Dustless fell silent. Qin Tian’s appearance made Ye Yuan lost the last trace of favorable impression towards the Wu Meng City Lord.

Now, an Origin Deity Realm Duan Fei, a grand completion Heaven Glimpse Huo Tianyang, plus a grand completion Heaven Glimpse Qin Tian.

This Divine Ruins trip was really extremely dangerous!

These three people added up were even a bit more dangerous than the Divine Ruins.

“Then, do you still want to enter?” Dustless said.

“Why wouldn’t I go in? I have no time to wait anymore! This Divine Ruins open once every thousand years. For the sake of the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, I must enter!” Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice.

Boom!

Right at this time, the volcano that had always been in turmoil finally erupted!

Violent magma was seemingly like a fountain, spraying out non-stop, presenting a magnificent sight.

Everyone was extremely far away, but under the impact of wave after wave of heatwaves, some staggered unsteadily on their feet.

Everyone all mustered up divine essence, covering the surface of the body to resist these heatwaves.

Suddenly, Duan Fei felt something, turning his head and looking in Ye Yuan’s direction.

Only to see that when those air billows approached Ye Yuan’s proximity, they seemed to split, automatically dividing into two halves, flowing past from Ye Yuan’s side.

A hint of strange look flashed across in Duan Fei’s eyes, and he turned his head around again.

No idea how long had passed either, the volcanic eruption was finally done. Everything returned to normal.

Those horrifying heatwaves finally took away the temperature.

“Now is the time!”

Duan Fei gave a cold cry, a hint of stunning light flashed in his hands.

The Flame Restriction Seal flagrantly attacked!

Everyone only saw a streak of white light tear across the horizon, flying straight for the volcanic entrance.

A light halo spread out. Everyone immediately felt that temperature drop significantly.

That natural flame restriction finally had a gap opened up.

Done with all these, Duan Fei looked in the White Night Sacred Palace’s direction and said coolly, “White Night Sacred Palace enter first, the others follow closely behind.”

It indeed came!

The Divine Ruins had not opened for a thousand years, It was not known how many powerful existences had spawned inside again.

Letting the White Night Sacred Palace enter first was the idea of letting them be cannon fodders and scout the path.

This targeting was truly a bit too obvious.

The White Night Sacred Palace’s people all dared to feel indignant but did not dare to speak. Bai Chen was even angered until his face turned red, wishing to go up to find Duan Fei and risk his life.

While the other sacred palaces let things drift if it did not affect them personally, gloating over others’ misfortunes by the side.

Ye Yuan gave Duan Fei a glance and discovered that he was currently sizing him up with interest. At once, he said indifferently, “Come on!”

“Grand Elder!” Bai Xiu said unwillingly.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and he said, “Go!”

The current Ye Yuan already established an absolute prestige in the White Night Sacred Palace.

With him being furious, the others could only swallow the insult and endure in silence, following him and flying towards the volcanic entrance.

Seeing this scene, Duan Fei’s face revealed a trace of surprise.

He thought that Ye Yuan was young and would definitely find him to argue.

He did not think that Ye Yuan actually forcefully endured it.

Huo Tianyang’s face revealed a smug smile. With the old palace lord around, it is really too awesome. I hope that these guys step on more land-mines and die out.

“Grand Elder, they are being too much!” Bai Xiu said indignantly.

“Yeah, Master! Why did we just swallow the insult and endure in silence?” Bai Chen also said unhappily.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Otherwise what? You guys finding him to go and risk your lives?”

Everyone could not help choking up. Finding an Origin Deity powerhouse to put up a desperate fight?

Wasn’t this courting death?!

“But the divine palace has regulations, the divine palace is not to have ties with their original faction!” Bai Xiu said with indignation.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “My deputy palace lord, you’re also someone up in the years, how can you be so naive? If you become a divine official, will you break away, but still remain connected or not?”

Bai Xiu froze, his face immediately flushing red, but said no more.

In all fairness, he could not do it!

“Hence, don’t feel any psychological imbalance either! Want to blame, can only blame you all for not having people in the divine palace! The Sky Foothill Divine Palace setting this rule, it’s just in order to better govern the various forces and maintain the Sky Foothill World’s balance. But to really talk about completely prohibiting it, that’s impossible. Therefore, going to find him to reason can only invite humiliation!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The words made everyone speechless.

Clearly, Ye Yuan saw it more thoroughly than them.

For Duan Fei to dare do so, there must be a contingency plan waiting for them.

As long as they knocked into the spearhead, it was not overboard to make one or two people the first targets of punishment.

Hence, it was better to be more low-profile.

Wasn’t it just being cannon fodders, we’ll do it!

At least on the surface, Duan Fei did not dare to kill people without any reason.

After all, so many eyes were watching! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Yuan entered first, flying straight into the volcanic entrance. The rest followed him, entering in a single file.

No idea how long he flew either, Ye Yuan finally landed. What entered the eyes was full of magma with sparks flying in all directions, looking soul-stirring.

“Careful, Grand Elder!” Bai Xiu suddenly shouted.

Ye Yuan had just landed when a ball of fire flew over towards Ye Yuan, its speed quick to the extreme.

However, Ye Yuan’s sword was even faster than it!

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan had long detected the approach of danger. Lifting his hand, it was Sundering Stars!

Boom!

That ball of fire was directly chopped flying out, smashing into the rock wall.

“It’s a lava flying monster! Divine rank lava flying monster! Not good, they normally appear in groups!” Bai Xiu’s expression changed as he said.

Bai Xiu’s voice had yet to face when everyone just felt a blur before their eyes and saw many fireballs rush out of the lava, just like that one earlier.

They were precisely the lava flying monsters!

At a glance, the numbers were likely no less than 100!

Over 100 divine rank lava flying monsters made people’s eyes blurry, the commotion was outrageous.

As long as hit by one, they would be crippled even if not dead.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and he said, “Be careful. Elders, guard the periphery; the rest in the inner-circle!”

Of the nine elders, only three came this time.

Adding Ye Yuan and Bai Xiu, there were a total of five Heaven Glimpse and above strength.

Under Ye Yuan’s word of command, everyone immediately formed inner and outer, two circles, to carry out the defense.

These lava flying monsters were extremely powerful. Even if Heaven Glimpse powerhouses were struck, they would probably lose a layer of skin too.

Even Ye Yuan did not dare to slight it too.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh ...

The lava flying monsters’ trajectories were virtually untraceable. Furthermore, they were swift to the extreme; simply impossible to guard against.

In a blink, that bunch of flying monsters arrived in front of them.

“Attack!”

Ye Yuan gave a loud cry. Lifting his hand, it was several Sundering Stars tearing through the air.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Several lava flying monsters were hacked flying.

Bai Chen hid in the inner-circle, only to see a blur before his eyes. A surge of heatwaves hit him head-on. Wanting to defend was already too late!
