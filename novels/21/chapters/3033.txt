Chapter 3032: Heavenless!

Mi Tian nodded his head and said, “That’s right! If my guesses are correct, the Labyrinth Divine Palace should have appeared in the 33 Heavens!”

“Hiss …”

Everyone present could not resist drawing a cold breath,

“This Labyrinth Divine Palace is also too powerful, right?”

“Establishing passageways in the 33 Heavens at the same time, this is truly incredible skill!”

“Hasn’t the Labyrinth Divine Palace already fallen for hundreds of thousands of years? What is coming up with this for?”

… …

Everyone was incomparably shocked. This display was seriously too grand.

Even Great Beyond Realm powerhouses could not do it to this extent too.

This Labyrinth Divine Palace’s might had already exceeded everyone’s imagination.

“How can this be? Could it be that the Labyrinth Divine Palace really rose again from the ashes?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

A Chaos Bloodstone already sent the 33 Heavens into a precarious situation.

Adding in a Labyrinth Divine Palace, that would really be turning things completely upside down.

The blood race had just stopped for a few days, and the Labyrinth Divine Palace came out to cause trouble again.

“Heavenless, this fellow, is a genius and also a madman! Nobody knows what he wants to do! However, since he caused such a big?hoo-ha, I reckon that … he probably hasn’t given up yet!” Mi Tian looked at the Labyrinth Divine Palace and said with a heart loaded with worries.

Heavenless was the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s last palace master!

This person’s strength was formidable until it reached the horizon.

Back then, many Great Beyond powerhouses joined forces and could not do anything to him either.

It was only when Hegemon Samsara made a move that they were able to suppress Heavenless.

However, that did not mean that his strength was weaker than Hegemon Samsara!

Because who he faced were the entire 33 Heavens’ powerhouses!

It was just that the powerhouses present did not know how strong Heavenless was. But they felt that Mi Tian was very strong!

In fact, he was even stronger than those Supreme Hegemons who came back then.

Then his identity was obvious.

Great Beyond powerhouse!

Ye Yuan this fellow was actually talking in a jovial manner with such a powerhouse!

Indeed well-deserving of being Heavenly Saint Ye, impressive!

At this time, the wind and clouds surged above the void.

Finally, it turned into a figure.

That figure had an unmatched heroic spirit, looking down on the world as if everything in the world was not in his sights.

When Mi Tian saw that figure, his entire body could not help trembling.

“Heavenless!”

Right at this time, Heavenless opened his mouth.

“I am called Heavenless! Heavenless in defying human and heavenly?laws1! You all might not know who this seat is. It doesn’t matter. I’ll let you all witness this seat’s strength first!”

It was only to see Heavenless smack a palm down before his voice faded.

In an instant, everyone’s expression changed wildly.

In an instant, it was like the sky had fallen down.

Everyone present, no matter if they were strong or weak, all felt like they were going to die.

Boom!

With a single palm pressing down, the earth quaked, and rivers flowed in reverse!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s three continents trembled, with mountains swaying.

Even those Hegemons in the air also fell down one after another, unable to stand firm.

Only Mi Tian could stand firm under this palm.

Zhuo Bufan’s figure shook heavily, his body bursting forth with an unparalleled powerful sword intent. Only then did he stabilize his figure.

Meanwhile, Ye Yuan did not fall under Mi Tian’s care.

At this time, there were only the three of them still standing in the air!

“S-So strong! This kind of strength is simply unreasonable!”

“Why do I feel like he can demolish Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven with a palm!”

“Great Beyond powerhouses aren’t strong to this extent either, right?”

… …

Ye Yuan drew a cold breath. This Heavenless was too strong!

He had always heard Mi Tian say that the Labyrinth Divine Palace swept across all the heavens back then and was just a tiny bit away from succeeding.

Actually, in his heart, he more or less still felt that it was somewhat exaggerated.

After all, there were still so many Great Beyond powerhouses across all the heavens.

But today, he believed it!

This Hegemon Heavenless was really unbelievably strong!

Furthermore, this was just a phantom!

If his original self was here, he could really level Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven to the ground!

But, even if it was a phantom, it was shocking enough already too!

No idea how long had passed either, everything returned to tranquility. Heavenless continued, “You all must be very curious why I’d suddenly appear, and why did I demonstrate my might to you all! Actually, it’s very simple. This seat needs a successor! And you all, also need to become this seat’s successor!”

“Back then, on the brink of this seat’s demise, I predicted that several hundred thousand years later, the 33 Heavens will still have another calamity! This calamity will be even more terrifying than the Labyrinth Divine Palace! And you all need to accept this seat’s legacy before you can make it through this calamity! This seat was unwilling, unwilling to disappear from this heaven and earth, so I hid the Labyrinth Divine Palace in the Eternal River with a great divine ability!”

“Now, this seat has returned. Your chance has also come! Passing through this passageway, you all will be able to reach the Labyrinth Divine Palace! Then you all will go through layers of selection, entering the real Labyrinth Divine Palace! This seat will wait for you all here!”

Finished saying, Heavenless disappeared.

These words sounded out in all planes of the 33 Heavens at the same time.

All the heavens were shocked!

Without a doubt, this was an extremely terrifying existence!

Becoming his successor, one would undoubtedly become a paramount existence of the 33 Heavens!

Even Great Beyond powerhouses would not be a match too! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This temptation was really great!

Furthermore, Heavenless even pointed out that he had long predicted the calamity of the blood race.

This method was for the sake of dealing with the blood race.

Pray tell, who would not be moved?

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, there were already many people who were raring for action, wanting to enter the passageway.

“What do you think, Senior?” Ye Yuan asked with a frown.

Mi Tian smiled bitterly and said, “Heavenless isn’t someone loves who do philanthropic work! He must have other goals in doing so! However … if one can really obtain his inheritance, they might really have hopes of resolving the peril of the blood race!”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “He’s so strong?”

Mi Tian nodded and said, “Stronger than you imagine! The second door is a realm with a huge disparity! Each step taken is incredibly difficult. His strength back then was not beneath Samsara’s!”

Even Ye Yuan could not help drawing a breath of cold air too.

He did not expect that this Heavenless was actually strong until such an extent!

“Actually, you humans are the race with unlimited potential! You all don’t have powerful innate conditions but can be on equal footing with the various races from all heavens. This already illustrates the problem! Your comprehension ability and disposition are unmatched by the other races! And Heavenless is the strongest genius born in these countless tens of thousands of years! If not for him being too radical back then, he might have long already transcended the Great Beyond!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “In that case, this is an openly done scheme? Even if you all, these old seniors are still around and know what he did back then, you’re still going to enter it?”

Mi Tian nodded his head and did not deny it.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Then is he dead or not?”

Mi Tian thought about it and said, “Back then, Old Man Samsara led 17 Great Beyond powerhouses and inflicted serious injuries on him, and surrounded him at the shore of the Eternal River! He saw that the situation was beyond salvation, so he jumped into the Eternal River! No one can survive in the Eternal River!”

He did not answer Ye Yuan directly, but Ye Yuan discerned some uncertainty from his words.

No one could survive in the Eternal River, but it did not mean that Heavenless could not either!

Even so, this chance was very slim!
