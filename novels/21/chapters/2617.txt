Chapter 2623: Peak Showdown!

After the two decided on the pill formula, Cang Yongning said with a contemptuous look, “This holy son will let you broaden your horizons today! I’ll make you understand what’s called a frog at the bottom of a well!”

His words also made people realize the truly powerful aspect of the Pill Alliance, this faction.

Ninth grade golden pills were already legends in the outside world.

But the Pill Alliance could refine even rarer true grade heavenly pills!

This disparity was too great!

What Cang Yongning represented was just the tip of the iceberg of the Pill Alliance.

He was just the holy son. Then what about the Pill Alliance’s elders?

Also, what about the even stronger Alliance Chief? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Unimaginable!

Furthermore, the Pill Alliance practically monopolized Rainclear Continent’s heavenly medicines and heavenly pills. Then how many powerful martial artists had they groomed?

Thinking about it like this, everyone could not help being fear-stricken!

At the same time, they also silently mourned Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was indeed a genius who rose up like a comet, nobody could deny this.

But what he did wrong was that he should not have provoked the Pill Alliance!

Now, he ended up with the outcome of perishing and Dao dissipating.

No one felt that Ye Yuan would win. This was because the outside world had never heard of true grade before.

Never even heard of it before, so how to refine it?

The moment Cang Yongning made a move, everyone’s expressions changed.

His every action and conduct, every move and stance, carried the accumulations of Great Dao.

The place where he stood, every inch of it formed a world of its own!

And the aura radiating from his body quickly affected Ye Yuan.

“So strong! Is this the Pill Alliance’s true strength?”

“When Holy Son is refining pills, it’s completely different from ordinary heavenly alchemists! The relative superiority or inferiority can be distinguished in virtually one glance!”

“Such a refinement combines Dao into one! One pill, one world, it’s exhibited to the extreme in Holy Son’s hands! Looks like Ye Yuan really has no hope!”

… …

Alchemy battles between heavenly alchemists, sometimes, the relative superiority or inferiority could not be differentiated until the moment the quality was tested.

But as soon as Cang Yongning made his move, everyone noticed the difference.

Some people refined pills by intuition.

Some people refined pills based on experience.

But some people relied on powerful strength to refine pills!

The vast majority of the heavenly alchemists in this world were the former two kinds.

And the first two kinds of heavenly alchemists, no matter how sensitive your intuition was, no matter how experienced you were, there was also a feeling of groping for fish in muddied waters.

It was merely a matter of knowing how to do something, but not understanding why.

But the third kind of heavenly alchemist operated from a strategically advantageous position, with a definite target in mind.

They rarely made mistakes when refining pills and the quality was extremely high.

This kind of heavenly alchemist was like an extremely sophisticated instrument, each step of the pill refinement was carried out according to a set route.

Such a refinement would not make any mistakes at all.

Holy Son clearly belonged to this type of people.

Ye Yuan also felt Cang Yongning’s power. It was just that he did not care.

The stronger the opponent, the more it could stimulate his fighting spirit.

He restrained his mind and cupped his fists. A Tai Chi diagram suddenly formed.

A surge of Great Dao accumulations erupted vigorously, it actually pushed Holy Son’s Great Dao accumulations out!

Cang Yongning already had no distractions in his heart. But being scoured by this power of Great Dao, he could not help being surprised in his heart.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan’s alchemy path strength was actually so strong.

But when competing in alchemy, he had no time to spare for other things too.

They were betting lives and could not crack any jokes.

Hence, the two started an alchemy battle that left people dizzy.

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, it could not avoid arousing a wave of shock.

They did not expect that what Holy Son could do, Ye Yuan could do it too!

The two people’s alchemy battle was very anxious.

No one could predict how the final result would be.

This kind of alchemy battle did not have glints and flashes of cold steel, but people similarly felt the intensity.

As if these two masters were currently going back and forth, fighting fiercely without ceasing.

After several hours, the two people virtually finished refining at the same time.

Holy Son’s gaze turned toward Ye Yuan, frowning slightly.

This boy’s stubbornness somewhat exceeded his imagination.

He was sure that his Alchemy Dao was definitely above Ye Yuan’s.

But that was just because his cultivation realm was higher than Ye Yuan’s!

Cang Yongning was a grade three heavenly alchemist!

Therefore, he was very dissatisfied with this result.

“Open the furnace! Looking at your expression, true grade should be hopeless, right?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Cang Yongning’s face turned black and he said in a solemn voice, “Boy, winning you don’t have to be true grade either! If you don’t reach grand completion ninth grade, you’ll likewise lose!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Oh, is that so? Then I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint you.”

Cang Yongning said in a solemn voice, “Open the furnace!”

The two people’s divine essence shook, each opening their furnace.

Two dazzling golden medicinal pills flew out, it naturally attracted a wave of exclamations.

The moment they made their move, it was a ninth grade golden pill!

These two people’s strength was really ridiculous.

Disregarding the Pill Alliance’s holy son, being powerful was to be expected too.

But they did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually not the slightest bit inferior when facing such a powerful opponent.

Cang Yongning sneered and said, “Boy, don’t be pleased with yourself too early! Even if it’s the same grand completion ninth grade, there are minute differences too! The result still needs to use the Cloud Mount Mother Stone to test before it can be confirmed! No need to doubt it. This holy son is definitely peak ninth grade, without the slightest flaw! As for you,?heh heh?…”

Cang Yongning’s words had unfinished meaning, but the meaning was already very obvious.

He completely did not believe that Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill could compare to his.

The quality of heavenly pills, even if there was the slightest error, would have subtle differences.

Pills were divided into nine grades. This was just a rough differentiation.

In reality, even if similarly upper ninth grade, the quality of the medicinal pill still had minute differences.

Normally, there naturally would not be anyone who would care about these minute differences.

But, when two people’s strengths were extremely close, this trace of difference was of utmost importance.

This kind of minute difference could not be felt. Only through a sophisticated treasure like the Cloud Mount Mother Stone, could it be discerned.

When Ye Yuan heard that, he just shrugged and said coolly, “Since when did a trash can be so confident? Stop talking rubbish and appraise it!”

Cang Yongning gave a cold snort and reached his hand out to beckon, and his heavenly pills arrived on the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.

The scales soared madly all the way until it rushed to the peak in the end and had no way of rising anymore!

Buzz!

There was an uproar from the crowd, they were all stunned by this scene.

What did this show?

This showed that Cang Yongning’s heavenly pill already reached the perfection of ninth grade!

Just as he said, without the slightest flaws!

“It’s over! Holy Son won for sure with this!”

“At least, Holy Son is already established in an undefeatable position!”

“Ye Yuan can at most just tie with Holy Son. But, I reckon that it’s very hard! Holy Son’s strength is absolutely at peak ninth grade, and it’s even possible to refine true grade! But Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill likely still has a tiny trace of flaw!”

… …

Everyone shook their heads, knowing that the outcome was a foregone conclusion.

This was competing against ninth grade perfection, unless Ye Yuan could refine true grade.

Otherwise, he could at most fight to a draw.

But how difficult was it to reach a draw?

Cang Yongning gave a cold laugh and sent the Cloud Mount Mother Stone in front of Ye Yuan and said, “Punk, it’s your turn! At the thought of you suffering the agony of the origin divinity curse, this holy son finds it very enjoyable right now!?Hahaha?…”

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not talk nonsense either, sending his heavenly pill onto the Cloud Mount Mother Stone.
