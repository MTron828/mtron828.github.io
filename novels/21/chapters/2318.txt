Chapter 2322: Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Two armies fighting, the general could often play a decisive factor.

A brave general could kill several rounds in the enemy army, directly killing until the other side’s camp was in chaos.

This point was similarly suitable in large-scale martial artist battles.

Clearly, Ye Yuan was such a person.

Originally, the divine race had too many of such people, killing in and out of the human camp, akin to a no man’s land.

But now, the situation suddenly switched.

Ye Yuan rushed all the way and was similarly akin to no man’s land!

The divine race was strong, but Ye Yuan was stronger!

Very soon, Ye Yuan brought the human army and directly killed his way through.

The divine race army suffered heavy casualties.

It was originally a one-sided massacre on the human race by the divine race. But now, it reversed, becoming the human race’s one-sided slaughter against the divine race.

It was not that the humans’ strength increased, but that the humans now had a pillar. Everyone’s cohesion became different from before.

A single chopstick was easily snapped; ten pairs of chopsticks would hold strong. It was this logic.

The humans were in a state of disunity previously, each fighting for themselves. There was no way to band together like strands of rope at all.

But now, all the humans gathered around Ye Yuan, they viewed Ye Yuan as their spiritual leader.

Wherever Ye Yuan fought, they would follow suit. Everyone had a clear goal.

Therefore, their combat power rose straight up!

At this time, the entire Cloudheart Realm was already reduced to rubble. Whatever Feather Mountain, Cloudheart Mountain, Cloud Summer Mountain, all had long already turned to ashes at this time.

The entire Cloudheart Realm, the void shattered. The realm was already reduced to shambles.

One had to know, the alchemy path powerhouses who came to Cloudheart Realm this time, a large majority of them were Heavenly Emperor powerhouses.

This level of a powerhouse, the moment they made their move, it would be earth-shattering. Let alone that there was still Originguard and Medicine Ancestor, this kind of sovereign level powerhouses.

Space shattered bit by bit, the entire Cloudheart Realm gradually collapsed completely.

At this time, everyone was already fighting in the dark spatial turbulent flows.

In the void, motes of starlight looked just like one bright star after another.

These stars were connected in pairs, forming an enormous web, completely covering Cloudheart Realm.

This was the divine race’s Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art. Several tens of thousands of divine race powerhouses already completely sealed off this region of space, everyone was unable to escape this region of starry sky.

Ye Yuan did not lead the human army to rashly charge toward this starry web. Instead, he brought the human powerhouses to charge to and fro several times, killing until the divine race powerhouses were in a scattered mess.

Even late-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses did not dare to easily clash head-on too.

Hence, more and more human powerhouses joined in, the human army was like a rolling snowball, growing larger the more it rowed.

Many late-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses also joined in, becoming the core power of this team.

The powerhouses around Ye Yuan got more and more, and their cultivation realms got higher and higher.

No matter how high their realms were, how strong their strength was, after joining, they would spontaneously take Ye Yuan as the center.

A batch of late-stage Heavenly Emperor super powerhouses gathered around Ye Yuan. They followed Ye Yuan and charged everywhere, mowing down all resistance.

Very soon, the divine race army was completely defeated. They fled in all directions, escaping in the direction of the starry web.

Beside Ye Yuan, Ji Mo said, “Lord Second Sage, the crux of the problem still lies on this starry web! The divine race’s strength is too strong. After those supreme powerhouses recover, we’re still turtles in a jar.”

During the chaotic battle, Ji Mo also saw the army led by Ye Yuan. Hence, he immediately joined in.

When he saw that Ye Yuan was the leader of this army, he also got a big shock.

One had to know, Ye Yuan was besieged by two middle-stage Heavenly Emperor squads previously.

He knew that Ye Yuan’s strength was very strong, but under the besieging of such scale of powerhouses, he thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

But who knew that not only did Ye Yuan not die, his strength improved even further instead.

What was even more terrifying was that he actually led the human powerhouses and forcefully slaughtered out a bloody path.

However, the crisis on hand had not been resolved yet. They were merely just ant-like existences in front of Originguard.

Once the divine race’s Deva Realm powerhouses triumphed all-round, they would still be turtles in a jar.

Ye Yuan nodded slowly and said, “This Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art gained the essence of spatial law and is cast by several tens of thousands of Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses. Its power is unimaginable. To crack this spell, one must find the weak point of this technique. Otherwise, there’s no way to crack it at all.”

Ji Mo was shocked and said, “Second Sage is proficient in spatial law. Even you can’t crack it too?”

Ye Yuan said, “This spell already touched the source power of spatial law. More than 30 thousand powerhouses each performed their own function, forming an extremely powerful ensemble. With my current spatial law attainments, it’s simply impossible to crack it.”

When everyone heard this sentence, each and every one of their faces could not help turning ashen.

Among so many human powerhouses, Ye Yuan’s spatial law attainments were the highest.

Even he could not do anything, then the current situation could only be waiting for death.

“This ... Could it be that we can only wait for death?” Ji Mo said absent-mindedly.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’ll go and challenge this spell, do what you can and leave the rest to heaven ...”

Ji Mo’s expression turned somber and he said, “Second Sage, go ahead! Leave here to us! Unless I die, otherwise, I absolutely won’t let people come and disturb you!”

When the Heavenly Emperors heard that, they echoed one after another.

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly, took a step out, and sprinted straight towards the starry web.

Arriving above the starry skin, a surge of powerful enchantment force pounced over head-on.

Ye Yuan felt that this region of space was akin to a steel plate, unable to penetrate at all.

Above the void, extremely powerful fluctuations even faintly exuded, akin to a sharp sword hanging high above, possibly dealing him a fatal blow at any time.

Ye Yuan was proficient in spatial law and was deeply aware of spatial law’s prowess.

It could attack when advancing, it could defend when retreating.

It was extremely sharp when on offense, strong as iron when defending.

Those few Heavenly Emperor powerhouses previously were garroted by the powerful spatial force. They could not even fight back!

“Heh, another one that came to die!”

“Love to see the despairing faces of these humans the most! Under the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art, there’s absolutely no one who survives!”

“These humans probably don’t know that the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art is our true trump card!”

... ...

When the group of divine race powerhouses saw Ye Yuan come over, they could not help revealing gloating expressions.

They could not see what was happening inside at all from outside the void.

As long as someone wanted to escape out of the void, they would give a fatal blow.

Ye Yuan arrived below the starry net. Those divine race powerhouses were just about to launch an attack when Ye Yuan suddenly stopped.

The position where he stopped was just right, the place that just happened to be out of reach of those divine race powerhouses.

The divine race powerhouses were angered until they were almost stifled to the point of internal injuries.

Ye Yuan stopped there, gazed upon this starry web, and carefully sized up the distance, feeling the spatial undulation of the starry web. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Before long, he suddenly took a step out, entering the attack range of the divine race powerhouses.

Suddenly, stars sparkled. Countless streams of flowing light scattered down like a meteor shower, landing where Ye Yuan was standing.

Bang, bang, bang ...

After countless explosions, Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly returned to where he was.

All of the attacks failed!
