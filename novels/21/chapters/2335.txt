Chapter 2339: Battling Qin Hu

Ye Yuan put away the sword and slowly walked out of the city.

Qin Hu followed him from far away, but he walked very carefully, as if afraid of startling Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan discovered it long ago, but he could not wait for the other party to follow.

He lacked god of war points very much right now!

If Ye Yuan’s plan was known to others, they would definitely scold him for being prodigal.

Just take the lowest-grade Heavenly Emperor spirit treasure to calculate it; a thousand swords needed ten thousand god of war points too.

This god of war points was sufficient to rank within 3000 already.

This guy was actually just using it to buy swords!

“Heh, there’s a good show to watch! That newcomer brat offended Qin Hu. Qin Hu is currently planning on going to find him to settle scores!”

“Poor thing, this kid doesn’t seem to have detected it yet that a tail is following behind him.”

... ...

In the crowd, Yang Ke’s ears moved slightly, hearing this news.

Especially ‘newcomer brat’ these few words, it aroused his curiosity at once.

Upon inquiring, there was a prodigal son who spent more than 200 points and bought a thousand over swords in the Spirit Treasure Hall.

The moment Yang Ke heard, wasn’t this Ye Yuan?

“This guy, forget about that he killed us, he also provoked Qin Hu?” Yang Ke said in puzzlement.

“Heh heh, Qin Hu is a powerhouse ranked within 8000. That punk is dead for sure this time! Boss, let’s go together to take a look!” Peng Yang said excitedly.

“Go!”

The brothers six people could not hold back their curiosity and also followed after.

After Ye Yuan left the city, he headed towards the wilderness.

Before walking very far, a figure blocked his path, it was precisely Qin Hu!

Qin Hu looked at Ye Yuan with a look of amusement and said, “Brat, you really have the guts, to really dare leave the city so quickly!”

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, “If I don’t leave the city, how will you come and give me god of war points?”

Qin Hu laughed loudly and said, “Those who dare to speak to me this way are all already dead men. Punk, before long, you’ll doubt life! I will kill you until you don’t dare to leave the city!”

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said coolly, “Oh, then what are you still waiting for, bring it.”

Ye Yuan’s nonchalant attitude made Qin Hu greatly enraged in his heart.

He gave a cold snort, his figure suddenly launching forward. A shocking aura suddenly erupted.

At the same time, four power of laws added radiance and beauty to each other, reverberating between heaven and earth. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

A powerhouse who fused four powers of law!

Qin Hu being so arrogant indeed had his capital to be arrogant.

Ye Yuan had seen before countless geniuses but had never met before a genius who fused four kinds of laws.

Furthermore, the power of laws that Qin Hu fused, their realms were all extremely high, already reaching the level of rank eight.

One had to know, each additional power of law fused, the difficulty increased exponentially.

Fusing three kinds could already be considered a genius among geniuses.

But Qin Hu fused four kinds, this kind of talent was extremely heaven-defying already.

At this moment, Ye Yuan finally understood what was called an unpredictable child.

With talent like Qin Hu’s, jumping ranks to battle was simply as easy as eating and drinking.

“Tsk tsk, really envy Qin Hu’s talent!”

“This fellow looks boorish and is unreasonable, but actually, he’s extremely talented! His Sword Dao is fused with wind, fire, and water, three kinds of power of law. The power is irresistible!”

“That kid thinks that he’s a genius, but how can he know the horror of this Primeval War Realm?”

... ...

When the group of geniuses saw Qin Hu take action, each and every one of them was incomparably envious.

They were all geniuses too. But compared to Qin Hu, they were simply even less than trash.

“Hahaha ... Punk, do you regret it very much now? However, you already have no chance!”

When Qin Hu saw the surprised expression on Ye Yuan’s face, he could not help being very pleased.

He appreciated this kind of expression very much!

Ye Yuan could not help shaking his head and smiling when he heard this. He said, “Regret? There’s no such word in my dictionary!”

“Humph! Reckless and blind brat, go to hell!”

Qin Hu roared loudly and raised his sword, rushing over.

For a moment, sword energy intermingled with the other three kinds of power of laws. Its power was irresistible.

Golden light shone brilliantly on Ye Yuan’s body. An astonishing dragon might similarly surged to the sky.

Amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, Ye Yuan actually relied on his fleshy body to clash together with Qin Hu!

In the wilderness, two figures crisscrossed, fighting until the earth shook and mountains swayed.

The more Qin Hu fought, the more alarmed he got. Ye Yuan actually relied on his fleshy body to fight with him until they were locked in a struggle!

He fused four kinds of power of laws and was actually unable to do anything to Ye Yuan.

One had to know, even in the Primeval War Realm, he was an existence who jumped ranks to battle!

Everyone thought that his ranking was close to rank 8000, but actually, his rank already rose to around 6900.

But he was actually unable to do anything to a Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor brat.

This kid was actually of the perfect rank eight golden body. Furthermore, he was of the dragon race!

How could he know that Ye Yuan was an existence who obtained Divine Stele Injecting Spirit, a candidate for the Dragon Clan’s progenitor?

The dragon race was extremely talented, their strength far surpassed same rank humans in itself.

The elites among the dragon race could naturally contend with the human race elites.

And Ye Yuan’s talent was at the top of the pyramid in the dragon race!

Coupled with the formidable strength of rank eight golden body, fighting to a draw with him was nothing unusual.

The geniuses who came to watch the battle were long already dumbfounded with shock from watching.

Some people had already seen before Ye Yuan’s battle with Yang Ke six people and knew about his prowess.

But they did not know that Ye Yuan was actually so powerful!

Yang Ke six people were not on the same level as Qin Hu at all.

Even if the six of them added up together, it was not even worthy enough to carry shoes for Qin Hu!

But Ye Yuan actually fought to a draw with him.

“Just where did this freakish brat pop out from? His strength is actually so strong!”

“He can fight to a draw with Qin Hu. Doesn’t that mean that his strength can already rank within 8000?”

“Hiss ... A Second Firmament Heavenly Emperor kid actually ranked within 8000, simply dare not imagine!”

... ...

In the Primeval War Realm, jumping ranks and battling was a very indulgent behavior.

Because the geniuses here were too many.

Very unfortunately, Qin Hu was that extravagant one.

But today, the powerful Qin Hu was actually leapfrogged and battled by someone!

How could these geniuses not be shocked?

This was also to say that their so-called geniuses, so-called unpredictable auras, were not worth mentioning in front of Ye Yuan at all!

Qin Hu gritted his teeth and said angrily, “Punk, consider me to have erred in judgment! Your strength is indeed very strong, but you’re still hard-pressed to escape death today!”

Suddenly, his figure retreated explosively.

At the same time, the sword, wind, fire, water, four kinds of power of laws in his body, started revolving according to some sort of rule.

Heaven and earth suddenly became berserk until the maneuvering of his power of laws.

Everyone’s hearts turned fearful, knowing that Qin Hu was going to release a big move!

This move, very few people could force it out of him.

But Ye Yuan did it!

“To be able to force me to use this move, you can be sufficiently proud! Heavenly Dao Combined Spirit Sword!”

A sword stabbed out, heaven and earth changed colors!

The sharpness of this sword was unrivaled!

Except, a hint of disdain showed on Ye Yuan’s face, the dragon might on his body quivering once more.

Behind him, the spirit of a true dragon suddenly appeared, being incomparably solid. It was as if it was a true dragon descending upon the world.

Heretic Dragon Dominating Space!
