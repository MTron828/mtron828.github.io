Chapter 2880 Aren’t You All Attacking Together?

The next day, it was Blueblood’s turn to challenge. He directly challenged the number seven blood pool’s powerhouse.

This action also caused a stir in the blood pool.

Before this, Blueblood was invincible. No one expected that he would be so strong.

The number one blood pool was one of the ten great seeded candidates!

To dare challenge this position, Blueblood’s strength naturally went without saying.

However, no one expected that Blueblood actually won!

Won beautifully!

Everyone could also see that this Blueblood was actually still holding strength in reserve!

This guy was absolutely a major dark horse.

In the hundred sons battle this time, Blueblood was very likely to make it into the top ten.

All of a sudden, Blueblood became Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City’s man of the hour!

Before entering the blood pool, Blueblood specially came before Ye Yuan and said smugly “Powerhouse from Heaven One Continent, I welcome you to challenge me tomorrow! Remember, I’m at the number seven blood pool!”

Ye Yuan had always been at the martial arena. He had also seen this battle.

Blueblood’s strength was indeed very strong.

Reaching Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City, the strengths of these contestants were more than a level stronger than those in Giant Net City!

Ye Yuan could also tell that these hundred sons candidates hanging around in the blood pool, their strength was actually about the same level.

They had virtually already reached the limits that Saint Sovereign Heaven could reach! Compared to those in the Extreme Medicine Sect in the same rank, the blood race was significantly stronger!

However, Ye Yuan was far from concerned.

With his bloodline breaking through, his strength had long already broken through the limits of Saint Sovereign Heaven. Coupled with the effect of the power of blessing, he was virtually invincible in battle!

Even if the current Ye Yuan faced off against a middle True Sovereign Heaven, he could also cut him down!

These blood race Saint Sovereign Heavens all had the strength to jump a major realm and fight. But, if they faced off against a middle True Sovereign Heaven, it would be certain death.

Not everyone was as monstrous as Ye Yuan.

“You are not worthy yet!” Facing Blueblood’s provocation, Ye Yuan turned his nose up at him.

“Huhu, you can go ahead and posture now. I hope that you won’t be scared when it’s time to challenge tomorrow!” Blueblood said with a sneer.

The current Ye Yuan had long already become a laughingstock of the blood pool. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He wanted to challenge everyone in the blood pool. This sort of thing had never happened before in the history of the blood race.

Nobody possessed the strength to defeat a hundred same rank geniuses in Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Furthermore, these hundred geniuses were all the strongest in the blood race’s Saint Sovereign Heaven!

On the following day, the challenges in the blood pool continued without any breaks. Many dark horses rose to prominence one after another.

But no one was as stunning as Blueblood.

Finally, it was the third day. It was Ye Yuan’s turn to challenge! Many people gathered around, pouring ridicule on him again. “Hey, Heaven One Continent’s expert, it’s your turn to challenge! You said before that you wanted to challenge all the geniuses in the blood pool! You mustn’t be scared at this time!”

“Your luck is pretty good. Bloodage already maxed out the ten days and already came out of the blood pool. Otherwise, you can still challenge him.”

“Go up there and do it, don’t be scared!”

“Big shot, hurry up and knock them all down. I want to carry your shoes for you!”

……

Ye Yuan had not taken the stage yet, and a series of guffaws already came from all around.

The geniuses present were all very proud, so they never disdained to take somebody to the task.

They had always had the heart that yearned for number one but would never say that I was going to sweep all of you away.

No one dared to say so!

Bloodage was the publicly recognized strongest person in this period. If Ye Yuan just challenged him, it would not be to such an extent of making people ridicule him like so.

But, to challenge everyone, that was too stupid!

Therefore, Ye Yuan became an out-and-out clown in their eyes.

The manager looked at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “Expert from the Heaven One Continent, are you still insisting on challenging everyone?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s right. Call them over and end the fight swiftly. I still have to cultivate.”

The manager was stupefied. Clearly, he did not think that Ye Yuan really dared to accept it.

He was just throwing in a word or two of derision earlier.

Could it be that this guy was really tired of living?

In a certain hidden space, several big shots were currently paying attention to the situation in the blood pool.

“Owlfly, he’s your trump card this time? No matter how I look, he seems like a fool too!”

“Huhu, could it be that this kid thinks that this place is Heaven One Continent? He just killed a few fools. Does he really think that he’s invincible in the same rank? Even if he’s really invincible in the same rank, nobody dares to be so arrogant either, right?”

..

.

.

.

The seven great blood envoys were shockingly present.

The other six people mocked Owlfly.

They had already heard about Ye Yuan’s performance on Heaven One Continent.

It was just that in their view, what was killing a bunch of trash worth being smug about?

They were all too clear about the strength of the Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons. Because each period’s Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons were led by them.

And among them, there were quite a few people who were former Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons too!

Why did the blood race attach so much importance to the battle of hundred sons?

It was because the chances of powerhouses being born among the hundred sons were very high!

The Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons from several thousand years ago were presently long already big shot characters who could take charge as chief at a front.

There were even some who already broke through to Hegemon Realm! Each period’s battle of hundred sons was conducted every ten years. It could be said to be the cradle of the blood race’s reserve powerhouses!

And they all, these blood envoys, the Blood God Temple would also give a certain reward to the powerhouses that they brought out.

It was just that Owlfly had never gotten these rewards before.

Facing the other six blood envoys’ mockery, Owlfly did not care and just said with a smile, “Young people can’t be taken seriously when showing off momentary bravery. We all just have to watch the show properly.” A blood envoy said with a cold smile, “Tch! Owlfly, don’t think that we don’t know what you have in mind! Finally managed to get a card and you want to sweep away our faces, right? It’s just that if we extend our faces over, do you dare to hit?”.

Who to send into the blood pool, how much strength to exert, they all had a score in their hearts.

The battle of the blood pool was actually the preview of the battle of the hundred sons.

And Owlfly had never won before!

So his goal was not hard to guess.

… …

In the martial arena, 99 genius martial artists were staring at Ye Yuan. It was as if they were looking at a dead man.

This guy was absolutely a mad man! “Min Wen, go and take care of him. He’s purely wasting our time!” The one who spoke was precisely the number one blood pool’s genius, Bloodrain.

After Bloodage left, he moved from position two to position one.

Now, he was the strongest one among these 99 people!

As for Min Wen, he was merely Bloodrain’s lackey.

Bloodrain completely looked down on Ye Yuan and could not be bothered to take action to deal with him. It was a waste of time.

When Min Wen heard the command, he rushed straight for Ye Yuan.

“Hang on!” Ye Yuan said in a cold voice.

Bloodrain smiled coldly and said, “Scared? Sorry, it’s too late!”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “You guys sure that you’re not attacking together? I gave you all the chance. In a while, you guys won’t even have time to regret it!” Everyone exchanged glances first. Following that, it was hooting peals of laughter!

Attack together?

Just to deal with an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven?

Huhu, you have to know, our opponents were basically all True Sovereign Heavens!

“Huhu, punk, get through me first before posturing!” Min Wen rushed toward Ye Yuan with a big laugh.

Bang!

A large blood-colored hand suddenly appeared from the void!

A palm smacked down, and Min Wen directly turned to ashes!

“Mn, I’m considered to have gotten through, right? Are you all sure that you want to come one by one?” Ye Yuan’s eyes swept over everyone’s faces, his gaze full of ridicule.
