Chapter 1997: Denounce Crimes Publicly

“Haha! Congratulations to Brother Hongxiao for achieving the realm of an Empyrean, truly to be congratulated!”

When Ye Yuan saw Jian Hongxiao, he had a joyful face.

Not seeing him for three years, Jian Hongxiao was already an Empyrean Realm powerhouse now.

“Huhu, stop making fun of your elder brother. Becoming an Empyrean, half of the credit goes to you!” Jian Hongxiao said with a big laugh.

The current Jian Hongxiao was full of high spirits. He did not look old and decrepit like when Ye Yuan saw him for the first time.

The backlash of Heavenly Dao was already completely dispelled. Breaking through to the Empyrean Realm, he had a lot of longevity added out of the blue.

The current Jian Hongxiao was no longer that mopey Extreme Light Imperial City’s Profound Secrets Pavilion Lord.

Seeing Jian Hongxiao like this now, Ye Yuan also felt happy for him from the bottom of his heart.

“Brother Hongxiao not only returned to the peak now, but you also even improved a step further. This Ye can also set my mind at ease. Coming today, it’s firstly to visit Brother Hongxiao. Secondly, it’s to say goodbye to Brother Hongxiao,” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

Jian Hongxiao’s face changed when he heard that and said, “Why? Leaving already?”

Ye Yuan and said, “Heavenly Eagle Imperial City that side isn’t stable yet. I can’t set my heart at ease. I better to go back as soon as possible.”

Jian Hongxiao also felt touched in his heart when he heard it. Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was newly set up. However, Ye Yuan immediately put down the matters over there just for the sake of coming to repay gratitude.

For him, Ye Yuan even did not hesitate to enter the Ancient God Battlefield, experiencing life and death. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Hongxiao understood in his heart. People should not look at how Ye Yuan broke through two minor realms in a row inside the Ancient God Battlefield in a simple manner. This was because the dangers that he experienced were definitely unimaginable too.

He was once the Stellar Hall’s elder and naturally knew the dangers of the Ancient God Battlefield. An entire force being completely wiped out, this sort of thing, often happened in the history of Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital.

Jian Hongxiao heaved a sigh and said, “Then I won’t hold you back. When I’m free later, I’ll go to Heavenly Eagle to visit you.”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said smilingly, “Brother Hongxiao, you have to keep your word.”

...

Inside Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s City Lord Manor’s hall, two men, one woman, and three youngsters were sitting.

Below them, City Lord Zuo Shujie, Coldfeather, and the rest were kneeling on the ground.

That young man on the left-hand side said with a cold smile, “Zuo Shujie, your Southridge Ten Cities gained autonomy and claimed kingship, disrespecting my Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital. How do you plead?”

This young man was called Deng Wei, the number one genius of the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s Deng Family.

Placed in the entire Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital, he was also a first-rate existence.

The man on the right-hand side was called Dai Yang, the number one genius of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s Dai Family.

As for that cold beauty in the middle, she was the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s City Lord Manor’s number one genius, Lu Ziyi.

The number one geniuses of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s three major families actually all gathered at Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Facing these three great geniuses, Zuo Shujie did not even dare to breathe loudly.

These three people were clearly representing the Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital to come and denounce them for their crimes.

Right now, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s situation was equivalent to carving out a place within the scope of Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital’s jurisdiction, carving out territory and claiming kingship.

How could Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital possibly permit this sort of thing to happen.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was not a place like Extreme Light Imperial City that no one dared to provoke.

Zuo Shujie thought that with the Southridge Ten Nations being far away from the central authority, they would not intervene. Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital might not even take notice.

But who knew that after several decades, the news still leaked out.

“This ... three lords are mistaken. We ... How can our Southridge Ten Cities possibly show disrespect to Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital? Lord Ye Yuan is just Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s patrolling inspector. We’re a city under Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s command!” Zuo Shujie said.

Deng Wei smiled coldly and said, “Do you take the three of us to be fools? Can Yu Wenfeng still govern you all now?”

Zuo Shujie panicked in his heart but still said, “Naturally can be governed.

Deng Wei could not help choking when he heard that and said with a cold smile, “Heh, looks like ... you won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin! Do you think that with this young master’s identity, I still need any evidence to kill you, a puny little imperial city’s city lord?”

Finished talking, the aura on Deng Wei’s body skyrocketed, terrifying True God Realm pressure suddenly erupted.

How could Zuo Shujie, a mere Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity, be able to block such a terrifying energy undulation? The bones in his body were crushed until they burst apart.

“Puhwark!”

Zuo Shujie and the rest directly spewed out a large mouthful of blood, already sustaining extremely serious injuries.

On the seat of honor, Lu Ziyi opened her mouth and said coolly, “Alright, they merely take orders from people. The perpetrator hasn’t appeared yet, so killing them is also useless.”

Deng Wei gave a cold snort and said, “These lowly things! Not giving them a bit of color, they don’t know my prowess! Come, men! Detain these few people into the dungeons for me. Once that Ye Yuan comes back, Detain him away along with the rest!”

Under the word of command, quite a few armored soldiers came in from outside. They were shockingly all peak True God Realm strength.

But there was no need for them to take action anymore, Zuo Shujie and the rest were all hanging in there with a breath now. Not dying was already pretty good.

After dealing with them, Dai Yang said with a cold snort, “These guys are more stubborn one after another. I’m afraid that they have succumbed to that Ye Yuan’s influence! I’m very curious now, whether that kid called Ye Yuan has three heads and six arms or not!”

Deng Wei faced the Lu Ziyi in the seat of honor with a fawning smile and said, “Miss Ziyi, what should we do next?”

Lu Ziyi said coolly, “Everyone that has connections to Ye Yuan, throw them all into the dungeons! When that Ye Yuan returns, detain him and bring him to Five Firmament Great Imperial Capital along with the others.”

Deng Wei and Dai Yang exchanged a glance, both secretly surprised in their hearts.

Although this Lu Ziyi was a woman, her methods were not an ordinary kind of cruel!

This way, it was equivalent to rounding up the Southridge Ten Cities in one fell swoop.

“But, there are still two True God Realm powerhouses in this city. That First Firmament True God isn’t a problem. But that Fourth Firmament True God is likely not easy to deal with!” Deng Wei looked at Lu Ziyi meaningfully and said.

Lu Ziyi slowly stood up and said coolly, “Leave that Fourth Firmament True God to me. The others, you guys go and take care of it. If anyone resists, directly kill them!”

...

At this time, Bai Chen, White Light, Ning Tianping, and the rest were all gathered together.

“These people aren’t here with good intentions!” Bai Chen said with a frown.

Lu Ziyi and the rest were all middle-stage True God Realm powerhouses. He was not a match for them at all.

White Light’s expression changed, and he said, “Who cares! If really can’t work it out, fight it out with them!”

Leng Qiuling shook her head and said, “It isn’t advisable to be impulsive for this matter. With their strength currently, we’re not their match at all. This matter, we can only wait for Ye Yuan to come and resolve it.”

Under the effect of Ye Yuan’s medicinal pills, the few of them were all peak Ninth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouses now. It was just that they were still a step away from True God Realm.

However, this kind of power was not worth mentioning at all in front of Lu Ziyi three people.

“But these few fellows are so insidious. The moment they entered the city, they sealed off all of the array formations. Now, news can’t go out at all. If Big Brother really comes back, wouldn’t he be walking right into a trap?” White Light said with a frown.

But Bai Chen shook his head and said, “I agree with Miss Leng’s opinion. With Master’s talent, he definitely already broke through to the True God Realm now. Even if he’s not a match for them, these few people can’t make him stay either. As long as Master is fine, everything is alright.”
