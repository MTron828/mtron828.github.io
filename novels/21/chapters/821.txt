Chapter 825: Corpse Tide

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On a high ridge at the borders of the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, several figures gazed into the distance.

“Young Lord, these zombies 1 appeared out of god knows where. Each and every one of their strength is very formidable. Whenever night comes, they will come out in full force and wreak havoc in the nearby cities. In a short half a month’s time, they have already destroyed three cities. None of the City Lords of these three cities were lucky to escape. Right now, everyone in this region is in a state of panic!”

The one speaking was a Phaseless Realm elder, called Wang Zan, who was also the person in charge of a large area, with more or less the same status as Yang Sen.

In this half a month, a zombie uprising suddenly erupted outside the borders of the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s north-west position.

Every time night came, tens of thousands of zombies would engage in wanton massacre everywhere, killing people on sight.

Wang Zan organized a large group of martial artists to come and kill these zombies. The result was that they returned in utter defeat with heavy casualties. That was why they had no choice but to seek help from the holy land.

Hearing Wang Zan’s plea for help, Ye Yuan also felt that the zombie uprising this time was rather unusual too. Therefore, he brought Wu Siyuan and Blackwind together and came here to investigate the situation.

Speaking of which, ever since after Wu Siyuan saw Blackwind, he no longer had any disloyalty towards Ye Yuan.

He knew that even if he exhausted the Wu Family’s power, it was also not possible to be Blackwind’s match. Ye Yuan could subdue a powerful demonic beast like this, what else was there that he was unconvinced by?

Standing on top of this hill could scan far into the distance at the situation nearby.

But it was broad daylight currently. Those zombies went to hide at God knows where; not even a trace of them could be seen.

But Ye Yuan could sense that the evil yin qi in the large stretch of the area around was extremely heavy. What Wang Zan said was clearly not false.

Ye Yuan even went to the three cities that were destroyed prior to this. Over there was simply purgatory on earth. Even Ye Yuan, this kind of person who had very rich experiences, could not help being visibly moved because of it as well.

He also secretly made up his mind to definitely eliminate these zombies!

“According to observations during these two days, these zombies seem to be intentionally expanding their territory. If it carries on developing according to this sort of trend, the entire Crimson Afterglow Holy Land will likely be plunged into an abyss of suffering!” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

Wang Zan was startled. Carefully recalling the process of the corpse tide happening, seems like it really was the case.

“This ... Young Lord, what should we do now? Even though we haven’t seen yet, but in this corpse tide, there is definitely a Tier 8 earth corpse!” Wang Zan could not quite make the decision.

Ye Yuan was silent for a moment, then slowly opened his mouth and said, “The corpse tide erupted very suddenly. Furthermore, it’s very controlled. I feel that ... there is someone manipulating these zombies at the back!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Wang Zan’s expression changed, and he said, “Young Lord, such a scale of corpse tide, how formidable a strength does one require to be able to manipulate it? This sort of conjecture, isn’t it ...”

Very clearly, he felt that Ye Yuan’s conjecture was somewhat nonsensical.

Wang Zan was certain that there absolutely existed a Tier 8 zombie in this corpse tide. Moreover, the scale of this corpse tide was completely not what ordinary martial artists could manipulate.

Ye Yuan actually suspected that someone was manipulating behind. This kind of possibility was too low.

Regarding Wang Zan’s questioning, Ye Yuan paid no attention to it and said with a smile, “Manipulating these zombies doesn’t necessarily need to have cultivation realm corresponding to them! As long as the method is apt, martial artists can even cross realms to control the zombies.”

Suddenly, several small black dots in the sky approached close from far away. Several silhouettes landed on this hill as well.

A martial artist who looked like a youth swept a glance over Ye Yuan trio and said disdainfully, “Heh, your Crimson Afterglow Holy Land is really incompetent, to actually have such a large-scale corpse tide erupt, causing our Cloud Watchtower Holy Land to suffer along with it too. Truly preposterous!”

This youth’s age was not old and actually had peak Heaven Enlightenment Realm strength!

When Wang Zan saw this youth, his expression could not help changing.

“Young Lord Wei Cheng, your words are a little prejudiced! This area is at the borders of our four great holy lands. How is it caused by our Crimson Afterglow Holy Land?” Wang Zan said indignantly.

This youth in front of them was precisely the Young Lord of the adjacent Cloud Watchtower Holy Land called Wei Cheng.

After Ye Yuan assumed this position of young lord, although he had not seen before the other Holy Lands’ Young Lords, he had heard before this Wei Cheng’s name.

Even though the Cloud Watchtower Holy Land was a Rank Nine Holy Land too, its overall strength was quite a bit stronger compared to the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land.

This Wei Cheng was the Cloud Watchtower Holy Land’s number one genius who was inducted by the Cloud Watchtower Holy Land’s Holy Lord last year. His strength was extremely formidable.

In comparison, the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s junior generation was way worse. Hence, they kept stalling and did not appoint a young lord, all the way until Ye Yuan’s appearance.

Hearing Wang Zan explained away, Wei Cheng said with a cold snort, “Resorting to sophistry in self-justification! This stretch of area is the region where the corpse tide erupted the fiercest. You don’t tell me that this area is not your Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s boundary! Our Cloud Watchtower Holy Land coming over now is to help you resolve the danger, and you guys actually have such an attitude! Looks like we were somewhat meddlesome. Let’s go!”

Wang Zan’s expression changed, and he hurriedly went forward, wanting to stop the other party.

But was stopped by Ye Yuan who said coolly, “Let him go!”

Wang Zan was somewhat put on a spot and said softly, “Young Lord, the corpse tide this time is too massive. It’s probably not what we, a single Holy Land, are able to resolve!”

But when these words landed in Wei Cheng’s ear, his eyebrows raised up, and he said deridingly, “Good gracious, I was wondering who it was. Turns out that you’re the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s newly appointed Boundless Realm Young Lord! Everyone says that the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land is declining with each passing day. Looking at it now, it’s indeed the case! A puny little Boundless Realm martial artist was actually appointed as Young Lord. Really disgraceful enough!”

The moment Wang Zan heard, his face flushed scarlet red.

He had been garrisoned at the frontiers all along. Although he was aware of the matters that happened in the Holy Land, it was mostly from hearing.

Toward this Boundless Realm Young Lord, he was actually quite disapproving in his heart.

Being verbally insulted by another Holy Land’s Young Lord at this time, he felt deeply affected like he had experienced it himself and felt that it was humiliating to the extreme.

“Heh heh, Young Lord Wei Cheng’s aura is somewhat unstable. There seems to still be some bruises on your face. No matter how you look at it, it seems like you were taught a lesson by someone? Oh, right, heard that an old man and a youth came to the White Valiant Region sometime ago to challenge the White Valiant Region’s young geniuses. The wound on Young Lord Wei Cheng’s face wouldn’t have been done by them, right?” The Wu Siyuan who did not speak at the side all along ridiculed at this time.

Wei Cheng’s expression sunk when he heard that. He involuntarily recalled countless staff images in his mind.

The bruises on his face were left behind by precisely Luo Tong.

Before Luo Tong and Grandpa Sun came to the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, where they arrived at was precisely the Cloud Watchtower Holy Land.

The Wei Cheng who was rated as invincible in the same realm was actually beaten into a pig’s head by Luo Tong!

Even though close to a month’s time had already passed, the bruises on his face had not recovered.

This was Wei Cheng’s greatest humiliation in his lifetime, but he had the scars directly torn open by Wu Siyuan!

“Insolent! That youngster’s strength was unfathomable. Young Lord Wei Cheng only succumbed because his mind wandered for a moment! Wu Siyuan, don’t defame Young Lord Wei Cheng! If you have the capabilities, let this Boundless Realm Young Lord of yours go try fighting him!” denounced a Phaseless Realm elder who was behind Wei Cheng,.

“Hahaha!” When Wu Siyuan heard that elder’s words, he could not refrain from bursting into laughter.
