Chapter 1978: The Remains of an Empyrean

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Terrific fellow! Brother Ye swallowing two medicinal pills in one go, isn’t he scared of being stuffed to the point of bursting?” Guo Jingyang said in surprise.

“Heh, Brother Ye is truly an eccentric. He’s different from others from head to toe. Relax, he’s not a fool either. So how could he possibly commit suicide? But for him to be able to digest two Profound Heaven Single Breath Pills, his cultivation method likely far surpasses ours!” Song Yu looked at Ye Yuan and said.

“We consumed a Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill and directly broke through a minor realm. Brother Ye directly ate two, he can likely soar straight to be a Third Firmament True God, right?” Hu Fei said.

When the others heard it, they had looks of approval.

This medicinal pill’s medicinal effect was so good. With Ye Yuan’s talent, breaking through two minor realms shouldn’t be anything difficult.

But, Ye Yuan did not do as they wished, directly breaking through to be a Third Firmament True God.

It was only all the way until the end did Ye Yuan suddenly burst through the bottleneck, reaching Second Firmament True God.

Two Profound Heaven Single Breath Pills actually only barely managed to break through to Second Firmament True God?

“Brother Ye, this ... What’s going on here?” Song Yu said in surprise.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The cultivation method that I cultivate is somewhat special. The spiritual energy quantity it requires is too great. These two Profound Heaven Single Breath Pills were barely able to let me break through to be a Second Firmament True God.”

The few people exchanged glances, being extremely shocked.

This cultivation method was a little too perverse, right?

Ye Yuan suddenly clasped his hands at the few people and said, “Alright, brothers, let’s part here.”

The four people’s expressions changed. Song Yu frowned and said, “Why like this, Brother Ye? Could it be that we did something overboard?”

“Yeah, Brother Ye. If you feel that the treasures we get are too much, we can take a little less.” Guo Jingyang said without the slightest hesitation.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Everyone, no need to think too much. The place that this Ye is going next is too dangerous. This Ye might not be able to make a full retreat myself. Everyone is best not follow.”

When the few people heard that, their expressions were strange.

They were very clear about Ye Yuan’s strength. He currently broke through his realm and actually still did not have confidence in making a full retreat. It could be imagined how dangerous that place was.

Hu Fei suddenly said, “Since that’s the case, I, Hu Fei, have to go even more! My life was saved by you. Now, I also obtained your Profound Heaven Single Breath Pill. If this Hu doesn’t forge ahead because of fear, what difference is there from an animal?”

Hu Fei’s words made the others all surprised inwardly.

Song Yu said, “Brother Ye, you saying this is not treating the few of us as brothers! We’ll share weal and woe together! No matter how dangerous the place you want to go is, we’ll follow you!”

Guo Jingyang and Ma Chang also each made their stand, saying to follow Ye Yuan over.

Ye Yuan was moved in his heart and said with a nod, “Alright, since you’re willing to go together, then this Ye won’t be melodramatic either, let’s go together!”

...

Looking at the bones that spanned all over the mountain, Song Yu’s expression changed slightly as he said, “Brother Ye, the place that you want to come is actually the Bone Devil Ridge!”

The Bone Devil Ridge was a rather dangerous place in the peripherals of the Ancient God Battlefield.

The children of destiny that entered the Ancient God Battlefield in the past, as long as they stepped into the Bone Devil Ridge, barely any could come out alive.

When the few people saw those dazzlingly white bones, they suddenly felt their hair stand on end.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This Ye owes Jian Sutao a favor. He made me enter the Ancient God Battlefield to help him retrieve an item. It’s in this Bone Devil Ridge.”

“Jian Sutao? City Lord? He ... Isn’t he asking for your life?” Song Yu said in surprise.

Ye Yuan was helpless as he said, “This old punk is a hypocrite. I was also compelled against my will. The few of you have to think clearly. There’s still a chance to retreat now. If you really enter the Bone Devil Ridge, it will probably be too late for you guys to want to retreat.”

Song Yu said in a solemn voice, “Brother Ye, what are you saying here? Would I, Song Yu, be someone who clings to life and fear death?”

Regarding Song Yu’s performance, Ye Yuan was greatly surprised.

His impression of Song Yu previously had never been very good. He did not expect that after experiencing difficulties together, he became gutsier.

Clearly knew that the mountain had a tiger, yet, moved towards the tiger mountain, this was not what anybody could do.

It seemed like this guy was just used to being arrogant and imperious, but in reality, his nature was not that bad.

“Huhu, since that’s the case, then let’s challenge this dragon chasm and tiger den!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Upon entering the Bone Devil Ridge, Ye Yuan felt like he entered another world.

In the depths of the Bone Devil Ridge, a powerful to the extreme undulation faintly passed out, giving him a feeling of palpitation.

Ye Yuan thought about it, could this be the Qilin emperor bone?

The party carefully headed towards the depths of the Bone Devil Ridge.

Suddenly, a strong undulation came from in front.

Song Yu said in surprise, “There’s actually someone who beat us to it. Could it be that there’s someone who’s the same as us, also thinking about getting the Qilin emperor bone?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “It’s not impossible! Since there’s someone who brought the news to Jian Sutao, then there will naturally be people who could bring the intel to other city lords. Come, let’s go over and take a look.”

The few people concealed their tracks and carefully scooted over.

The line of vision gradually became clear. Ahead, seven to eight people were surrounded tightly by a group of bone devils, falling into a bitter fight.

The Ancient God Battlefield was an enormous space. The deeper in, the stronger these lifeforms.

The Bone Devil Ridge was already a very dangerous place in the peripherals of the Ancient God Battlefield. The strength of these bone devils actually had a few that were Fourth Firmament True God strength. The rest also had Third Firmament True God Realm.

However, among those seven to eight people, there were actually two that were Fourth Firmament True God, giving Ye Yuan a shock.

“It’s Zuo Mo and Feng Xiaotian they all! They ... actually broke through, becoming Fourth Firmament True Gods!” Song Yu cried out in surprise.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “They are all in possession of emperor surmounting aura. Encountering some lucky chances in this Ancient God Battlefield and breaking through to be a Fourth Firmament True God is also not strange.”

Song Yu nodded his head but secretly sighed at his luck in his heart.

If not for Ye Yuan, just based on his imperial aura, it would likely still be quite a bit off to want to break through to be a Fourth Firmament True God!

In fact, with a misstep, dying at Liu Yi’s hands was also not impossible.

Thinking up to here, Song Yu became even more grateful toward Ye Yuan.

“Strange, why do I feel that these bone devils seem to have gone mad?” Hu Fei suddenly said.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, discovering that it was indeed the case.

Those bone devils all had astonishing momentum, like humans who were enraged, each move aiming for the vitals.

The few people exchanged a glance and said in unison, “There’s a treasure!”

Ye Yuan observed for a while and made a hand gesture to Song Yu as he said, “Come, we’ll circle around!”

That group of bone devils chased Zuo Mo and his party. Clearly, they chased after all the way.

Ye Yuan brought his own party and acted cautiously. Very soon, they saw a cave.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Inside the swarthy black cave, several rays of dim light actually faintly seeped out.

“Let’s go in to check it out.”

Ye Yuan brought everyone and entered the cave cautiously.

Those few rays of dim light became stronger and stronger. Everyone’s hearts pounded heavily, being aware that the treasure was right in front.

Due to Zuo Mo and the rest drawing the bone devils away, it was currently completely empty inside the cave. They did not run into any dangers.

Suddenly, the line of sight became clear. Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent. He then said in pleasant surprise, “This is ... the remains of an Empyrean!”
