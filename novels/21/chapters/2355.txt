Chapter 2361: Alright

Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

All of a sudden, it became quiet inside the cage.

People suddenly discovered that the huge cage was only left with a few people.

Counting carefully, there were only 19 people left within the cage.

These 19 people were without a doubt the strongest 19 people!

Among them, many fought one-versus-many, then slew their opponents.

Inside the cage where the strong gathered, it could be seen how strong their strength was.

And just earlier, the last battle ended. Everyone tacitly stopped taking any more action.

A great battle until now, their consumption was huge too.

Making a move in this state was not secure.

They needed to compete for the throne of first place under their strongest state.

Pang Zhen’s gaze swept across everyone and said in a solemn voice, “Those who remain are all old acquaintances already! Half a day of rest! After half a day, regardless of to what degree you recover, it will be the final battle! Wonder if everyone has any objections?”

Everyone nodded their heads one after another. Clearly, they agreed with this suggestion very much.

“I have an objection!” Yu Tanzhi suddenly said.

Pang Zhen’s brows furrowed and he said, “What objection do you have?”

But Yu Tanzhi looked in Ye Yuan’s direction and said smilingly, “Somebody rested three whole days more than us, how to calculate this?”

The moment these words came out, everyone looked in Ye Yuan’s direction, each and every one revealing very wary looks.

Clearly, this person was referring to Ye Yuan.

Even Wan Zhen also had many powerhouses who went to provoke him.

But Ye Yuan did not have a single one!

Half a day’s time, it was impossible to recover to their peak state.

How much they could recover would depend on their own ability.

However, Ye Yuan already had not taken action for a full three days!

The current Ye Yuan had swept away the decadence after fighting with Wan Zhen, his entire person in great form. Clearly, his state had already reached its peak.

Ye Yuan was troublesome in the first place, now, he was also in better shape than them.

How to resolve?

Pang Zhen’s brows furrowed even harder. He really overlooked this problem.

“Kid, you explain it yourself. What should be done?” Pang Zhen looked at Ye Yuan and said.

Ye Yuan did not expect that he suddenly became the public target of scorn.

Hearing Pang Zhen’s question, he just spread his hands out and said smilingly, “Anything goes for me. It’s up to you guys.”

He really did not care. Moreover, this sentence clearly already had the intention of targeting him.

After all, if they really wanted to put forward a complaint, they could have everyone all rest well, then get to fighting again.

But Yu Tanzhi very clearly pointed all of the spearheads at him.

Ye Yuan’s indifferent attitude made Pang Zhen very displeased.

It was like they all, these so-called proud children of heaven, did not exist in Ye Yuan’s eyes at all.

That appearance was like he was saying, do as you all see fit, either way, you all will lose in the end.

Sure enough, seeing Ye Yuan’s attitude, these proud children of heaven all furrowed their brows, feeling like they were being underestimated.

“Heh heh, I have an idea, why don’t everyone attack together first and finish him off. The rest will be easier,” Yu Tanzhi said with a laugh.

An unpredictable child said with a smile, “Oh? This is a good idea!”

Although they all were disdainful to team up with the others, to be honest, they were really quite fearful of Ye Yuan.

A guy who defeated even Wan Zhen, how could they not dread?

Of course, they still had a small thought, that was to force Ye Yuan to withdraw.

Weren’t you very cocky?

Didn’t you leave it up to us?

Then, we’ll take care of you!

Even though each and every one of them was currently not in their peak state, the strongest dozen over unpredictable children joining forces, what kind of horrifying line-up was that?

Here, no one dared to face so many people at the same time!

Even if they were at their peak state.

“Huhu, kid, since you said that anything goes for you, then we shall do so, what do you think?” Pang Zhen also had a mocking look as he said with a smile.

Others looked at him, all having fear and respect in their eyes.

Even these unpredictable children were fearful of his identity too.

But Ye Yuan was not!

He could not see the slightest trace of awe from Ye Yuan’s eyes!

That was not just showing contempt for him. It was looking down on his ancestor, Ancestor Lightning!

Who would have thought that Ye Yuan grinned and lightly spat a word out, “Alright.”

He knew that these people were all afraid of him, but so what!

All the heaven’s chosen were stunned when they heard it. It was as if they could not quite believe their own ears.

Alright?

Was this guy stupid?

He was going to challenge the strongest 18 people by himself?

Even Yu Tanzhi was also dumbstruck with shock by Ye Yuan’s answer.

Even though he had this intention, deliberately leading everyone in this direction.

But for Ye Yuan to actually fall for it so easily, he was still very surprised.

At this moment, the entire Primeval War Realm was in a stir!

“What did he say? Did I hear wrong!”

“No, you didn’t hear wrongly! He said, alright!”

“Haha, awesome, domineering! It’s just, does he have this strength? Those are the strongest 18 people!”

... ...

Everyone seemed to have heard a hilarious joke, all jeering at Ye Yuan for overestimating his own ability.

They thought about ten thousand possibilities of the final great battle, but only never thought of this.

One person, challenging 18 people!

Among these 18 people, there were at least no fewer than five whose strength was not inferior to Wan Zhen’s, even surpassing by a thread. While the rest was also merely marginally weaker than Wan Zhen.

These 18 people joining forces was roughly equivalent to 18 people similar to Wan Zhen’s power teaming up.

Too terrifying!

“Younger Brother Ye, don’t act based on emotions!” Wan Zhen also said with a frown.

Ye Yuan gave him a comforting look and said with a smile, “Relax, Brother Wan. It will be fine.”

Wan Zhen was rendered speechless.

This kid was really stubborn!

Even if he backed out, there were still 17 people.

Forget about facing 17 people, even facing the teaming up of Pang Zhen and Yu Tanzhi, he was absolutely not a match either.

But Ye Yuan was going to challenge 17 people, this was too crazy!

“Hahaha ... Good, very good! Ever since I first made my appearance in the world, I’ve never been underestimated so much before! Forget it. I’ll witness today how confident you are, to dare say such conceited words! Kid, hope that you don’t let me down too much!” Pang Zhen laughed from extreme fury.

Ye Yuan did not know Pang Zhen. Although he was surprised by his lightning source, he did not know that he was Ancestor Lightning’s successor.

However, even if he knew, he would not care either.

Hearing that, he just nodded his head indifferently and said, “Mn, shouldn’t disappoint you.”

Pang Zhen’s gaze was gloomy, having a look of fury on his face.

Ye Yuan’s attitude was a form of humiliation in his view.

The successor of a Dao Ancestor, what kind of venerated status was that?

This guy was actually so condescending!

“Huhu, good! Since that’s the case, everyone attacks together then!” Pang Zhen said with a cold smile.

“Wait!” Ye Yuan suddenly said.

Pang Zhen smiled coldly and said, “What? Scared? It’s too late!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t misunderstand me. It’s impossible for you guys to win me like this! You all recuperate first, it isn’t too late to attack again after recovering your strength.”

The moment these words came out, everyone was dumbfounded.

Was this kid stupid?

He actually took the initiative to want Pang Zhen they all to rest up!
