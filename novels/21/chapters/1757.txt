Chapter 1761 Eternal Chess Game “Ask Not“

The white-haired old man changed to a fascinated expression and slowly said, “50 million years ago, my demon race’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest attained Dao. In order to right the demon race’s name, he went to challenge the human race’s Medicine Ancestor! Who knew that these two created a new path, and actually integrated Alchemy Dao into Go, playing an eternal chess game called ‘Ask Not’!”

When he heard that, Ye Yuan said in surprise, “Challenging the Medicine Ancestor! The demon race’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest was actually so powerful?”

The white-haired old man’s face fell, and he said with a black face, “What do you mean? Could it be that our demon race deserves to be worse than your human race?”

Ye Yuan laughed awkwardly and said, “Huhu, Senior, don’t blame me. Junior has always heard that the Medicine Ancestor is only half a step away from stepping into the realm of Dao Ancestor. So I instinctively thought that the Medicine Ancestor is this Heavenspan World’s strongest alchemist.”

In reality, even Dustless was also not clear how powerful the demon race’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest was.

After all, in the eyes of these top characters, Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was merely a junior too.

When the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest played chess, the Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was still at no idea which faraway corner. There was also no Immortal Grove World.

The white-haired old man huffed, but his expression became much more relaxed. Letting out a sigh, he said, “Actually, what you thought is also right. Even though the Sacred Ancestor High Priest was powerful, he was still a hair inferior to the Medicine Ancestor in the end. This game of chess, it was still the Sacred Ancestor High Priest who lost in the end.”

Ye Yuan was secretly startled. He completely did not expect that the demon race’s Sacred Ancestor High Priest was actually so powerful, to be able to contend with the Medicine Ancestor in Alchemy Dao.

In the notion that Dustless indoctrinated to Ye Yuan, the Medicine Ancestor was an invincible existence. It was completely impossible for there to be someone who could rival him in Alchemy Dao.

One had to know, he was an extraordinary person who had half a foot stepped into Dao Ancestor Realm.

In Alchemy Dao, he could be said to be standing at the apex of this world.

However, the Sacred Ancestor High Priest could actually play with the Medicine Ancestor and only lose by a hair.

This strength, you probably could not find a second one in the entire Heavenspan World.

“Senior, losing is losing, why was this chess game called ‘Ask Not’?” Ye Yuan asked.

The white-haired old man glanced at Ye Yuan and said with a smile, “I said that this was a chess game, but actually, it was these two people’s understanding of Dao. Back then, when he reached a dilemma, the Sacred Ancestor High Priest sat in front of the chess game for 100 thousand years. In the end, his hair and beard turned white, and he was seriously injured and vomited blood. He finally opened his mouth and asked the Medicine Ancestor just where did he lose. The Medicine Ancestor just smiled and said four words ‘Ask not! Ask not!’. The name of this chess game also came from this.”

“And then?” Ye Yuan said.

“It was said that the Sacred Ancestor High Priest had always taken this to heart and wholeheartedly wanted to take revenge and redress hatred. But he also knew that his gap from the Medicine Ancestor. Hence, after the returned to the demon race, he established the Priest Temple and took in disciples extensively, in hopes of being able to groom an existence who could contend with the Medicine Ancestor. At the same time, the Sacred Ancestor High Priest even reduced the complexity, engraving many copies of ‘Ask Not’, and distributed them to each Priest Temple. As long as someone could crack ‘Ask Not’, they would have the qualifications to directly enter the Priest Temple’s headquarters,” said the white-haired old man.

“So that’s how it is. Looks like the elders want me to beat a retreat in the face of overwhelming odds against me,” Ye Yuan smiled and said.

The white-haired old man said with a smile that was not a smile, “Are you scared?”

Ye Yuan smiled as he looked at the white-haired old man and suddenly said, “That day, when Hall Master Di Qiu wanted to kill me, it should have been Senior who helped me resolve my predicament, right?”

The white-haired old man was slightly stunned, then immediately pointed at Ye Yuan and said with a loud laugh, “I knew that it couldn’t hide from you, this brat!”

Ye Yuan clasped his hands and said, “Junior thanks Senior for your life-saving grace. However, we’ve already known each other for more than half a year and Ye Yuan still doesn’t know Senior’s name.”

The white-haired old man said coolly, “This old man has a single character name, Xiu. You can call me Senior Xiu.”

Ye Yuan said knowingly, “Senior Xiu goading me is hoping for me to go and attempt it?”

Xiu smiled and said, “For 50 million years, those who could crack the simplified ‘Ask Not’ were only 11 people! These 11 people are presently all disciples under the Sacred Ancestor High Priest, and also the backbone of our demon race’s alchemists. It’s just a shame that these 11 people studied for tens of millions of years and are also unable to crack the real ‘Ask Not’.”

“50 million years and only 11 people, so how does Senior know that I can crack it?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Xiu shook his head and said, “Even the ‘Ask Not’ after simplification studies the mysteries of creation, opens up the mysteries of Great Dao, ordinary people can’t pass it at all. A single misstep and one will even lose their lives on their spot. You’re endowed with unusual intelligence; your views are unique, I think maybe ... you have a possibility of passing it. How about it? Have the guts to give it a try?”

In this half a year, Xiu sat down and debated on Dao with Ye Yuan. The more they talked, the more he took advantage of the opportunity.

And as time went on, he also became more confident in Ye Yuan’s talent.

Hence, that was why he supported Ye Yuan to attempt it.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “How can this kind of thing need Senior to goad? If I had long known that there was such a chess game, I’d probably have long been unable to stand it and went to attempt it.”

Hearing Ye Yuan said so, Xiu’s expression became solemn instead and he said, “Brat, I know that you’re exceedingly talented. But don’t look down on this ‘Ask Not’! For 50 million years, the geniuses who died under this ‘Ask Not’, can probably drown an imperial capital when added up!”

This chess game was the game of two supreme powerhouses. The perils contained inside were naturally all-pervasive.

This kind of chess game, dull talents were fine instead.

But once those outstandingly talented ones get caught inside, integrating into the game between the two, it would be extremely dangerous, fatal pitfalls hidden everywhere.

So, the higher the talent, the more miserably one would die instead.

That Ni Kun resorting to this move was actually wanting to borrow ‘Ask Not’ to kill Ye Yuan.

After all, the talent that Ye Yuan exhibited, everyone all saw it.

Ni Kin did not like Ye Yuan, but it did not mean that he did not acknowledge Ye Yuan’s alchemy talent.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Where the Dao lies, even if tens of millions oppose, I’ll also march forward bravely! If I don’t even have this bit of courage, how can I talk about achieving the Great Dao?”

Xiu smacked his thigh when he heard it and said with a big laugh, “Good! This old man indeed didn’t misjudge you!”

...

When Ye Yuan found Ni Kun, saying that he wanted to challenge ‘Ask Not’, Ni Kun was shocked inwardly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He was currently plotting on how to force Ye Yuan to challenge ‘Ask Not’. He did not expect that Ye Yuan delivered himself to the door.

This act made him somewhat stunned.

“You really want to challenge ‘Ask Not’?” Ni Kun said in astonishment.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Isn’t this precisely what you hope for?”

Ni Kun was taken aback and blurted out, “You know this too ... uh ...”

Ni Kun panicked, discovering that he divulged it.

Wasn’t this equivalent to admitting that this matter was him inciting it at the back?

This kid was shrewd and crafty, really impossible to guard against.

Actually, whether he admitted it or not, Ye Yuan did not care.

This matter, Xiu already told Ye Yuan. Otherwise, he also would not know the dangers involved, and naturally would not know Ni Kun’s diligence.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Elder Ni Kun, why don’t we make an agreement? How about that?”

Ni Kun’s expression was somewhat ugly as he said in a solemn voice, “What do you want to agree on?”

Ye Yuan said, “If I fail, I won’t speak again during the elders’ sermons in the future. If I succeed by a fluke, all of the elders’ sermons, everyone can speak freely as they wish! What do you think?”
