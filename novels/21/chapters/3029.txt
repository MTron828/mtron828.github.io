Chapter 3028: Concerted Attack From Inside and Outside!

The sword intent grew stronger and stronger!

If someone was here, they would definitely be in a trance, as if there was only this sword left in this heaven and earth.

All around, the blood color was boundless, but it could not affect Zhuo Bufan.

He was accumulating momentum!

In the fierce battle with Wang Zuo, it was naturally impossible for the other party to give him the chance to gain momentum.

But, once Zhuo Bufan was done accumulating momentum, his offensive power would reach an extremely terrifying realm.

But at this time, Zhuo Bufan was somewhat dazed.

The opponent was too strong!

But, unexpectedly, the Chaos Bloodstone did not attack him.

Clearly, all of the other party’s focus was on breaking through.

Breaking out of seclusion was not an easy thing for the Chaos Bloodstone too.

Crack … Crack, crack!

Suddenly, that heart’s outer layer started to crack.

An astonishing aura spewed out of the heart.

Feeling this aura, Zhuo Bufan’s sword intent could not help becoming sluggish too.

“So strong! Am I really able to defeat this guy?”

A trace of doubt was actually produced in Zhuo Bufan’s heart.

This power was really too strong!

“Mn??Why is there a brat around? Are you here to deal with me?” No idea since when the Chaos Mother Stone already woke up.

Zhuo Bufan ignored him and continued gaining momentum.

“Hur hur,?what a strong sword intent; indeed rather capable. But this ancestor has already been born. Your bit of strength is insufficient!” The Chaos Mother Stone continued.

Zhuo Bufan still ignored the Chaos Mother Stone.

He knew that his strength was inadequate, but since he came, he never thought of shrinking back.

True courage was not about having the courage to do anything, but it was doing it even though one clearly knew that it was impossible!

Rumble?…

An astonishing aura burst forth from the Chaos Bloodstone.

Zhuo Bufan’s heart tensed up. The Chaos Bloodstone was about to be born!

But at this moment, the Chaos Bloodstone’s aura was very unstable.

Zhuo Bufan suddenly snapped open his eyes and cried out angrily, “Now’s the time!”

As if his mind becoming more agile as luck hit, Zhuo Bufan immediately realized that the opportunity had arrived.

A powerful sword intent that made people feel asphyxiated suddenly erupted.

In an instant, the sword intent that he accumulated for a long time poured out.

“Haha,?this sword is pretty good. But sadly, it’s still too weak!” Chaos Bloodstone said with a loud laugh.

At the same moment in the outside world, Ye Yuan’s bloodshot eyes suddenly snapped open.

“Now’s the time; explode for me!”

With an angry cry, the four great true spirit bloodlines in Ye Yuan’s body suddenly erupted.

A surge of saint force arrived inside the Chaos Bloodstone through the Dao sword’s sharing.

The wisp of Dao sword that was incubating in the Chaos Bloodstone, directly exploded at this moment.

Normally, this bit of power was naturally nothing.

But, at the moment when the Chaos Bloodstone was being born, he was evolving from a non-living entity to becoming a living entity.

One should not look at how his aura was boundless. Within his body, a massive transformation was currently taking place.

At this moment, inside out, it was when the Chaos Bloodstone was at its weakest.

At this moment, any undulation would cause a fatal impact on the Chaos Bloodstone. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

While at the same time, Zhuo Bufan’s astonishing sword intent had arrived.

Concerted attack from inside and outside!

Ye Yuan and Zhuo Bufan never discussed the specifics. They just said to act according to circumstance.

But at this moment, the two people’s cooperation was brilliant to the max!

Two forces wrecked the Chaos Bloodstone’s vitality, like sweeping away dead leaves.

The Chaos Bloodstone was actually powerless to resist.

“ARGHHHH!”

A furious roar could be heard, shocking heaven and earth.

The current Chaos Bloodstone was furious to the extreme.

“Ye Yuan, it’s you again! You again! This seat will definitely tear your corpses to pieces today!”

A bellow reverberated throughout the firmament.

“Pffft!”

Ye Yuan also directly spewed out a large mouthful of blood. Detonating the Dao sword, he suffered a great loss of vitality too.

How sharp was the perception of Long Jian and the rest of the Hegemons?

The Chaos Bloodstone’s astonishing aura seemed to have been dealt a staggering blow by someone, becoming dispirited and inert all at once.

“Success!?Hahaha,?kid, nice one!” Long Jian said excitedly.

While Wang Zuo and the rest of the Hegemons had blank faces as they said, “This … How is this possible? The mother stone is invincible! How can you all possibly hurt the mother stone?”

He did not take Ye Yuan’s words earlier to heart at all.

But now, it was really realized!

The mother stone’s coming into being had failed!

Ye Yuan this guy actually really did it!

But the mother stone was invincible. How could a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven possibly hurt him?

Bang!

A figure directly flew out of the void.

Zhuo Bufan was directly blasted out!

However, it was not a big problem.

The Chaos Bloodstone was severely wounded and no longer had such great power.

“Brother Zhuo, beautifully done!” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Zhuo Bufan also had an excited look as he said with a smile, “It’s still you who’s impressive! Without you, my sword couldn’t have breached his defenses at all!”

Ye Yuan said, “Brother Zhuo’s sword grasped the timing perfectly, truly remarkable!”

Zhuo Bufan said, “It’s still you who was farsighted and prudent, to actually be able to execute such means that deceived everybody!”

“Alright, alright. I know that the two of you are impressive. Stop bragging. I can’t continue to listen anymore!” Long Jian was speechless.

These two guys were blowing each other’s trumpets. It was really utterly shameless.

How embarrassing!

But they were really amazing!

An Emperor Vast Heaven and a Supreme Hegemon who just broke through not long ago.

The two people joined hands and actually inflicted serious injuries on a Great Beyond powerhouse whose strength did not pale in comparison to Mi Tian!

This was really incredible!

Boom!

The void shattered. A streak of bloody light flew out.

Everyone looked over and could not help laughing.

The arrival was an ugly thing with a stone head.

This ugly monster’s aura was very chaotic, seemingly unable to be controlled at all.

Judging by his aura, his current strength was at the very most, just an ordinary Hegemon.

Clearly, the Chaos Bloodstone’s evolution had failed.

Puu, puu, puu?…

Suddenly, one blood race Hegemon after another exploded, turning into clouds of blood mist, pouring towards the Chaos Bloodstone.

The expressions of Long Jian and the rest changed slightly. Sure enough, after absorbing the vitality of more than 20 Hegemons, the Chaos Bloodstone’s aura stabilized at Supreme Hegemon.

But it was also merely just that.

Ye Yuan and Zhuo Bufan’s joint attack had damaged the Chaos Bloodstone’s foundation, making him unable to complete his evolution.

If he wanted to enter the Great Beyond Realm and thoroughly complete the evolution, it could not be done within a short time.

He looked in Ye Yuan’s direction and cried out angrily, “Little Villain Ye Yuan, this seat will definitely kill you today! Everyone, heed my order. Kill Ye Yuan at all costs!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said, “My mission is already completed. I won’t be staying behind to draw aggro anymore. Senior Long Jian, I’ll leave this place to you all. I’m making a move!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan executed his divine ability again and made his get away.

Long Jian and the rest could not help being speechless. This guy slipped away so quickly.

But it was indeed not a good thing for him to stay here.

The aggro points were too high!

They could completely imagine how furious the Chaos Bloodstone currently was.

Although the blood race Hegemon numbers were reduced sharply, with the addition of the Chaos Bloodstone, they improved greatly in terms of quality.

A starving camel was still bigger than a horse. Although the Chaos Bloodstone did not evolve completely, his combat power still could not be underestimated.

This battle was still very difficult!

“Everyone, a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven took all the limelight. We, old fellows, mustn’t lose face! Kill!” Long Jian bellowed.
