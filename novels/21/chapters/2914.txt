Chapter 2920: You Cheated!

Upon entering the Lucid Forest, countless aura of Daos hit him head-on.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over, having some enlightenment.

Hence, he started to study it carefully.

What he cultivated was the soul race’s sacred canon, his comprehension of the Dao of Soul was extremely deep.

Regarding these so-called Daos, Ye Yuan understood them with one glance.

After studying for a while, Ye Yuan discovered that it was … dull.

These Daos were all too superficial. It did not give him much inspiration.

Of course, he understood that this was due to Divine Emergence being too profound. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The more he cultivated, the more Ye Yuan discovered the extensiveness and profoundness of Divine Emergence, pointing straight at the origin of Soul Dao.

Only at this time did he remember that he seemed to be taking part in an assessment.

There was no one around him a long time ago.

Hence, he took large strides forward.

The surrounding Daos got more and more and also increasingly profound, as if it could let people reach out and grasp the Dao.

The Lucid Forest was to let people hold fast to their Dao hearts.

The more Daos you saw, you would waver in your own Dao heart.

In this Lucid Forest, you could not avoid these so-called Daos at all. It did not need to be looked at using the naked eye at all but directly came into contact with the soul body.

But, to Ye Yuan, these could not affect him in the slightest at all.

Putting aside how powerful Divine Emergence was, one could only say that Ye Yuan’s Dao heart was not an ordinary kind of strong!

He was a man who dared to point at heaven with his sword!

Hence, his speed of advancement was incomparably fast.

Ten miles was merely a twinkle to a True Sovereign Heaven.

Hence, Ye Yuan came out after several breaths.

… …

Outside of the Lucid Forest, Great Emperor Eastsun three people were currently discussing their honorary disciples.

“Qin Shitian indeed doesn’t fall short of this old man’s expectations! Among the three people, his skill is a level higher in the end!” Great Emperor Eastsun stroked his beard and said with a smile.

Great Emperor Westdawn was indifferent as he said, “It seems to be too early for Brother Eastsun to draw a conclusion now, right? There are huge variables in the Lucid Forest. Moreover, Qin Shitian isn’t in the lead by much. Zhou Yu has always been reserved. He definitely won’t lose in this Lucid Forest stage!”

Great Emperor Eastsun said coolly, “Then, just wait and see … see …”

Suddenly, Great Emperor Eastsun’s eyes became wide saucers. Even his words became stutters.

It was because a light dot surpassed Qin Shitian three people like lightning and reached the end point in a few breaths of time.

Great Emperor Westdawn smiled and said, “Brother Eastsun, it’s merely a competition among juniors. Why do you have to be so agitated?”

Agitated my *ss!

Are you freaking … blind?

Uh, it seems like this guy did not see the light screen.

Drawing a deep breath, Great Emperor Eastsun said, “Somebody came out!”

“S-Someone came out?” Great Emperor Westdawn wondered whether this guy was joking or not.

But right then, there was suddenly a commotion from the crowd.

“This is also too fast, right? Just now, my attention was fully on Qin Shitian three people, I didn’t even see clearly who that was!”

“Me too! This … wouldn’t be some problem with the light screen, right?”

“Something is definitely wrong with the light screen! This Lucid Forest’s record is 6 hours and 15 minutes. Even if someone broke the record, it’s also impossible to be so fast, right?”

… …

They only saw a light dot flash past, then it disappeared.

As for who it was, everyone really did not see clearly.

Because everyone’s attention was all placed on the Scarlet Drill Three Sons.

This was also the biggest highlight of the assessment this time.

But very soon, a figure appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Shockingly, it was Ye Yuan!

The forest guardian was also somewhat absent-minded. His focus just now was also on Qin Shitian three people.

By the time he became aware of it, someone had already come out.

Ye Yuan looked at the forest guardian and asked, “Senior, am I considered to have passed?”

The forest guardian had a blank expression. Nodding his head, then shaking his head again, he questioned: “H-How can you be so fast?”

Ye Yuan countered with a question, “It’s merely ten miles. Isn’t it a snap of a finger to us?”

The forest guardian was taken aback and immediately said angrily, “Hang on! You … You were clearly stuck in the beginning just now. How did you clear it so quickly? You cheated!”

Everyone’s hearts eased up. It turned out that he was cheating!

Sure enough, only cheating could be so fast, no?

The forest guardian had already been at this Lucid Forest for many years.

The geniuses that he had seen before were beyond countable.

But, no matter how outstandingly talented, it was also impossible to clear the Lucid Forest so quickly.

Therefore, it could only be cheating.

If you cheated, forget it. The main characters this time were the Scarlet Drill Three Sons. You stole their limelight, wasn’t this slapping the faces of the three great hall masters?

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he was amused. “Since Senior said that I cheated, then this junior will go again. Senior can enter the forest to inspect. ” ”.If there’s any problem, Senior can strike me dead on the spot. How about that?”

The forest guardian’s old face turned red. Ye Yuan’s speed was too fast. He could not keep up!

Although he was an Emperor Realm powerhouse, he also could not be unmoving as a pine tree in this Lucid Forest.

“I’ll go!” At this time, Great Emperor Eastsun spoke up.

He also did not believe that Ye Yuan could pass through the Lucid Forest in such a short time.

This sort of thing had never happened before. It was too bizarre.

Ye Yuan clasped his hands at Great Emperor Eastsun and entered the forest again.

Great Emperor Eastsun’s figure moved and entered the Lucid Forest too.

Upon entering the forest, Great Emperor Eastsun’s pupils constricted. Ye Yuan’s figure sped towards the distances like lightning.

The countless Soul Daos around him could not affect Ye Yuan in the slightest.

Great Emperor Eastsun also stepped forward, incredibly shocked in his heart.

These low-level Soul Daos were naturally unable to affect him too much.

But there was ultimately some influence.

He unleashed all of his ability and could only eat dust behind Ye Yuan in the end.

In merely several breaths of time from start to finish, the two people came out of the Lucid Forest very quickly.

Everyone held their breaths, waiting for Great Emperor Eastsun’s ruling.

Great Emperor Eastsun’s heart was in shock currently.

What a powerful Dao heart!

He shook his head slightly at Westdawn two people and said, “This boy didn’t cheat!”

Whoosh!

Outside the Lucid Forest, it completely burst into an uproar.

“How is this possible? It’s merely five breaths of time from start to end!”

“How does this result expect people to live?”

“No wonder he turned his nose up at the Scarlet Drill Three Sons. This… is simply a one-sided beating!”

… …

This result was too explosive.

Explosive until everyone did not dare believe it.

Jiang Hao’s expression was like he had eaten a fly.

Sure enough, Yan Jadetrue’s mocking voice entered his ears very quickly.?“Huhu,?What Brother Jiang Hao said is right. My eyesight is indeed extremely poor, but I failed to discern that Brother Ye was actually so impressive! However, Brother Jiang Hao’s eyesight seems to be worse than mine. Ye Yuan’s result can brutalize the Scarlet Drill Three Sons already, right?”

More than brutalize, it was simply a catastrophic mangling!

Entering the Lucid Forest, the shorter the time, the more difficult it was.

After so many years, everyone kept refreshing the record continuously. It was incredibly difficult to improve it again by a few breaths.

But now, the record was no longer important.

It was because it was impossible for anyone to be able to beat Ye Yuan’s record.
