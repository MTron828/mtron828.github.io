Chapter 2380: It Was Easier to Call Up an Evil Spirit Than to Allay It!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Senior said, he’ll take care of this matter! But everyone, please don’t forget. We’re humans, and not pigs and dogs! Resistance will have sacrifices, but not resisting ... we can only be pigs and dogs forever!”

Facing the leaders of a group of sects, Qin Chao delivered Ye Yuan’s words calmly.

But these people did not buy it.

“Humph! This matter was caused by him to begin with, it should be him bearing the responsibility himself!”

“For him to be able to come forward himself, at least he has a bit of conscience.”

“If not for him, would those few sects be destroyed?”

“Also, you, this brat, to actually dare provoke the divine race, you caused us to almost be destroyed too! Mo Qingshan, kill this kid and pay homage to those sects that were destroyed!”

... ...

There were also a few sect masters who were silent. But the vast majority of the people felt that Ye Yuan was finding trouble, guiding the fire onto their heads.

There were even sect masters who wanted to kill Qin Chao to vent their anger.

To the vast majority of the humans, they had long already become numb.

A living dog was better than a dead lion!

Destroying Sentry Celestial Palaces this matter, although it had a great impact on them, it was hard to make them risk their lives for it.

To the various races that have been bred in captivity for countless years, many of them had long already turned this sort of life into a habit.

As long as they did not take the initiative to provoke the divine race, they would not kill people indiscriminately too.

Right?

Sure enough, when someone proposed to kill Qin Chao, many sect masters were eager to take action.

Qin Chao did not have the least bit of fear. Instead, he responded with a sneer as he said, “If you dare to touch a hair of mine, Senior will definitely go and destroy your sects! Those present today, not one can escape!”

A sect master smiled coldly and said, “He already went to the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace, he’s dead beyond a doubt. You’re still using him to threaten us?”

Qin Chao had a disdainful look as he said, “Who told you guys that he went to court death? He went to warn the divine race, to stop them from doing anything to the human race anymore!”

That sect master laughed loudly and said, “Are you kidding me? Southern Sentry Celestial Palace’s palace lord is a middle-stage Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouse, an existence even stronger than Deva Third Blight. You’re currently telling me that he can return.”

Qin Chao said disdainfully, “I, Qin Chao, merely have a lowly life. If Sect Master Wu dares to bet with your life, you can kill me right now!”

Got to admit, this sentence of Qin Chao’s was very deadly.

It was not that they believed Ye Yuan could return, but that they felt that their lives were much more valuable than Qin Chao’s.

What if Ye Yuan really returned?

Sect Master Wu’s face fell and he said, “Not killing you, we can detain you temporarily! After news of that brat’s death arrives, I believe that you won’t get away by the skin of your teeth anymore, right?”

Mo Qingshan’s brows furrowed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Sect Master Wu, aren’t you taking this Mo too lightly?”

Sect Master Wu said disdainfully, “Doesn’t this matter all due to your Ziwei Sect’s fault? You guys kept the sects in the Skysouth region all in the dark, making multiple sects get annihilated because of you guys! We haven’t found you guys to settle the scores for this yet!”

Sect Master Wu’s words immediately received many of the sects’ agreement.

Hence, they decided to detain these master and disciple two people.

After the news of Ye Yuan’s death arrived, they would punish the two, to serve as a warning to the others!

While Qin Chao had a calm look and said to Mo Qingshan, “Master, you rest assured! They detain us now, they will send us back respectfully later on!”

Mo Qingshan had a suspicious look and said, “That person was indeed very formidable. But Lord Originbright’s strength isn’t what those Sentry Celestial Palace’s palace lords can compare to!”

... ...

The news of Ye Yuan being killed did not arrive, but even more explosive news came over. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The main culprit who annihilated 18 Southern Sentry Celestial Palaces finally showed himself. It was a Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor young man!

No one could have thought that a Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor could actually slaughter 18 Sentry Celestial Palaces.

What was even more damnable was that he was a human!

Of course, this was not the most explosive thing yet.

The most explosive thing was that this young man went to the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace alone, and he warned the Sentry Celestial Palace Lord, Originbright!

The young man went on a killing spree, killing several late-stage Eight-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses as well as hundreds of powerhouses.

Then, under the besiegement of Lord Originbright as well as several Nine-marks Heavenly Dao Realm powerhouses, he left suavely!

As soon as the news spread out, the entire southern border was in a stir.

“Where did this young man pop out from? Why is he so strong?”

“Lord Originbright, that’s a character in the sky! Even he failed to hold this young man back?”

“The divine race members who came to the southern border to investigate have all been withdrawn! This is also to say that his threat has worked! The divine race was actually forced to give in by a Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor!”

... ...

This conclusion filled many people with astonishment.

Only then did they know that turns out, humans could be so powerful!

Challenging the Sentry Celestial Palace single-handedly, arriving elegantly, killing several hundred powerhouses, then leaving suavely.

Although they did not see this scene, imagining it with their brain a little, they felt their hot blood boil with excitement too!

Passing through a million-strong army, not a single armored warrior touched his body!

This was the best portrayal of Ye Yuan’s operation this time!

There were too many people who saw this battle, it could not be hidden at all.

After the news spread out, countless human powerhouses were greatly encouraged.

When the news spread back to Skysouth, the various sects’ sect masters were completely stunned.

They gathered together overnight, discussing how to salvage this matter.

Wu Tianqiao was naturally the first to bear the brunt!

A sect master said while dripping with sarcasm, “Sect Master Wu, you’re really impressive! The great idea you came up with, now, you brought everyone into the pit!”

Another sect master said with a cold smile, “That lord is definitely already on the way here! Sect Master Wu, can you teach us how we should explain to that lord?”

A sect master said with a gratified look, “Lucky we didn’t kill Qin Chao. Otherwise, our sects will really be destroyed!”

For some time, Wu Tianqiao became the target of public criticism.

Wu Tianqiao’s expression was gloomy, and he said in a cold voice, “Now, all are blaming me? When I said to capture them back then, weren’t each and every one of you all very excited? What’s the use of saying this crap now? Rather than blaming me here, why not think of a way?!”

A sect master said, “What solution can there be now? Go and invite them out! Very clearly, Qin Chao delivering that lord’s message indicates that he’s already that lord’s confidant! As long as we get his forgiveness, that lord definitely won’t look into us!”

At present, they could not think of a better way as well.

Hence, a large group of sect master level powerhouses came to the dungeon and invited Qin Chao and Mo Qingshan out.

When Mo Qingshan saw each and every one of these people being extra careful, how could he still not understand what was going on?

He was incomparably shocked in his heart.

That young man really did it?

Qin Chao smiled at him and said, “What did I say, Master? His Excellency must have caused a great sensation in the southern border this time!”

Wu Tianqiao smiled and said, “Yeah! That lord has the talent to rule the world. Even the divine race was kneaded by him too! Gentlemen, it was all our fault this time. Can we invite you two out, please?”

Qin Chao said with a smile that was not a smile, “Sect Master Wu, haven’t you heard of this saying, it’s easier to call up an evil spirit than to allay it?”
