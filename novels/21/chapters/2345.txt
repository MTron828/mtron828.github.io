Chapter 2351: Reality Mercilessly Slapping Faces!

“It’s impossible, right? Why did Ye Yuan’s god of war points suddenly increase so much?”

“This Ye Yuan wouldn’t be that fool who was comprehending time law, right? He has never entered the God of War Golden List before!”

“Heard that this kid’s cultivation realm isn’t high, but his combat strength is extremely formidable, having comprehended two kinds of power of laws. It’s just that only focusing on strength now, doesn’t he feel that it’s too late?”

... ...

In Cloudaid City, everyone was discussing the Ye Yuan who just entered the God of War Golden List.

There was no choice. He was the focal point to begin with.

Now that he appeared in everyone’s field of vision again, it immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Reaching the last ten years, those ranked towards the back basically all did not have hope anymore. Each and every one of them was bored out of their minds, and they naturally had to look for topics of discussion.

Very clearly, Ye Yuan was this sort of explosive figure.

Hence, everyone paid more attention to him.

Especially Jiang Zhe and his group, they wished for Ye Yuan to risk his life and fail to enter the top ten in the end.

That way, they would be able to mock to their heart’s content.

... ...

On the wilderness, two figures were currently advancing swiftly.

One was calm as a mountain, the other was so beautiful as to cause the flowers to blush and the moon to hide.

These two were naturally the Wan Zhen and Zhang Lian who were training in the Myriad Beast Battle Plain.

“How strange. We walked so far, but why didn’t we encounter a single fierce beast? According to past experiences, there should be even more fierce beasts here!” Zhang Lian said with a puzzled look.

Wan Zhen’s gaze was slightly sullen and he frowned and said, “Could it be that it has already been cleaned up by someone before?”

“Impossible! The fierce beasts in this region are very powerful! Even if you and I enter, we’ll have to be careful too. Once we fall into a heavy encirclement, it will be hard to escape death! In this Cloudaid City, apart from you and me, who else has this ability?” Zhang Lian immediately denied it.

Wan Zhen said, “What you said is right, but ... it’s indeed a little strange! Eh, there seem to be some activities over there. Go over and take a look.”

His perception was very keen, faintly feeling that there seemed to be significant undulations very far in front.

The two people’s movement techniques were extremely fast, rushing ahead very soon.

Suddenly, the two were stunned by the scene before their eyes. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In front of them was a sea of fierce beasts.

There were at least several thousand fierce beasts roaring crazily, rushing towards somewhere in the sea of beasts.

These fierce beasts seemed to be triggered by something. All of them were like they went mad.

Seventh Firmament and Eighth Firmament Heavenly Emperor fierce beasts! Furthermore, it was even fierce beasts with extremely high comprehensions in laws. There were several thousand of them bellowing in the wilderness all at once.

That scene was too shocking.

In the sea of beasts, there seemed to be a figure that appeared from time to time, unable to see clearly.

Those fierce beasts seemed to be losing their shit at that person.

The two people’s complexions were somewhat pale. Those violent attacks made them somewhat shudder with fear.

“Wan Zhen, this ... this scene, can you deal with it?” Zhang Lian swallowed his saliva and said.

Wan Zhen had a solemn look and shook his head and said, “Will die beyond a doubt!”

Zhang Lian said, “You’re the God of War Golden List’s number one, and I’m number two! Even you and I can’t handle it, then ... who’s in the sea of beasts?”

Wan Zhen was silent.

It was true that they were strong, but facing such a horrifying beast horde, it was impossible for them to survive too.

These fierce beasts were of different types; the laws comprehended were different.

Some laws just happened to restrain your law, which would make martial artists very uncomfortable.

Moreover, being besieged by so many fierce beasts, divine essence was a huge problem.

The divine essence of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses was extremely vast, but their moves likewise consume a lot of divine essence. Facing so many fierce beasts, their divine essence consumption speed increased sharply.

These two people killing all the way over, they at most faced the besiegement of 30 plus fierce beasts.

Several thousand fierce beasts, they did not dare to imagine it at all.

Suddenly, Wan Zhen’s pupils constricted. His gaze turned intent, and he sucked in a breath of cold air deeply.

“Mn? What discovery did you make?” Zhang Lian said.

Wan Zhen said, “Have you noticed that the fierce beasts around that figure, their tempo is completely different from the outer-peripheral?”

Zhang Lian focused his eyes and looked over, and discovered that it was really the case!

Even though this range was not large, with his eyesight, he could naturally tell at a glance.

Just now, it was because it was too shocking, resulting in overlooking this detail.

“It really is true!”

Zhang Lian was talking halfway, when suddenly, his expression changed wildly and he exclaimed, “I-It wouldn’t be him, right? This isn’t possible!”

Wan Zhen’s gaze became extremely solemn and he said, “Who else is there beside him? Actually, you yourself already have that thought, right?”

Zhang Lian said in shock, “He ... He really succeeded? But that’s time law!”

A hint of melancholy suddenly flashed across Wan Zhen’s face.

Clearly, this conjecture made him feel somewhat of a loss.

“So what if time law? No matter how difficult it is, there’s also someone who comprehended it! Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets can, why can’t he? It’s a shame that there’s no more time. Otherwise, I’d really want to comprehend time law,” Wan Zhen said.

It was not that he was unable to comprehend time law, but that time was too short.

A short thousand years, want to comprehend time law, this was simply something impossible.

Wan Zhen believed that Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets must have also gone through countless years to comprehend time law.

As long as he was given time, he would definitely be able to comprehend time law!

Regardless of whether it was 10 thousand years, 100 thousand years, or hundreds of millions of years!

But the divine race would not give him time!

However, what he could not accomplish, Ye Yuan did it!

He only used a short one thousand years’ time and comprehended the time law which was known as the supreme law.

This kind of talent was too terrifying.

No, Ye Yuan came in 100 years later than them, which was also to say that Ye Yuan only used 800 over years and achieved this great feat!

“We were still mocking him for clinging onto it previously. Now, what irony! It turns out that it’s our talent that’s too lousy, rashly discussing about people’s talent!” Zhang Lian said with a bitter smile on his face.

To be able to rank second in Cloudaid City, it could be seen how confident he was in his own talent.

One had to know, those able to enter the Primeval War Realm were all unpredictable children, their talents extremely terrifying.

And he and Wan Zhen were the strongest ones among these unpredictable children!

They had sufficient reason to be proud.

Hence, when Ye Yuan was persistent in wanting to comprehend time law, they were very disdainful in their hearts.

The law that even they were unable to comprehend, what right did Ye Yuan have to comprehend it?

Even if he could comprehend, it was also impossible within a short thousand years.

Wan Zhen similarly smiled bitterly and said, “It’s not just you. Every single person in the city was jeering at him, laughing at his ignorance, laughing at his overestimation of his own ability! I previously also thought that this kind of mocking made sense. But now, reality slapped faces mercilessly. Comprehending time law, his gains from this trip to the Primeval War Realm is greater than any one of us!”

During these several hundred years, they felt that Ye Yuan’s behavior was very naive.

Knowing how to make one’s choice was what defined a wise man, and only then, could one achieve great things.

Ye Yuan clearly did not know how to choose.

But now, Ye Yuan used action to tell them that they were wrong!

The two looked from afar just like that. They wanted to see how strong Ye Yuan who comprehended time law was.

The more they watched, the more alarmed they got!
