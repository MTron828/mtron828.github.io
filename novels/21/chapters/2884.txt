Chapter 2890 Blood Divine Son!

These few days, Ye Yuan had been in the void all this time, comprehending the origin of blood.

Bloodline was a very miraculous thing. It was born from Heavenly Dao and possessed great fortune, and could create everything in heaven and earth.

This origin of blood was profound and complicated to the extreme.

Ye Yuan’s present realm was too low and was unable to pry into the essence at all.

However, Ye Yuan’s bloodline talent was extremely strong too. But this blood origin made him understand a little.

Currently, Ye Yuan’s realm had long already reached the limit of Saint Sovereign Heaven, and he could break through to True Sovereign Heaven at any time.

Actually, after accepting the origin of blood, Ye Yuan’s realm had already reached the brink of shattering

However, it was suppressed by him.

But True Sovereign Heaven was different from upper Saint Sovereign Heaven. As long as he broke through, the aura of the Dao sword would no longer be able to be concealed, and the Dao tribulation would descend immediately.

Therefore, Ye Yuan was currently suppressing his realm desperately.

His strength had long already suppressed lower True Sovereign Heaven. Breaking through was effortless to him.

Ye Yuan did not know how terrifying this Dao tribulation would be once he broke through.

All in all, it would be very terrifying!

As soon as he exited seclusion, Ye Yuan discovered that something was wrong.

The great victory that came from the front-lines spread in the entire Blood God Temple with fervor. Even if he did not want to know, he could not do it either.

“It’s really an unprecedented great victory this time! Killing a Hegemon Realm, the Absolute Heaven Barrier is already in a precarious situation!”

“Our blood race’s Hegemon Realms are getting more and more, but Heaven One’s Hegemon Realms are getting fewer and fewer. When one aspect was weaker, the others would be stronger. The day when we unify Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven isn’t far anymore!”

“Hegemon Bloodsky is amazing too! The last time, when he received a backlash due to the spatial passageway, after he consumed Hegemon blood and went into closed-seclusion, his strength grew significantly instead! This time, he used the spatial confinement technique and ambushed Hegemon Edgeless, completely sealing him off! He really rendered a great contribution!”

“However, South Qi Giant City’s battle doesn’t seem to be going too smooth! Lord Bloodpromise has already attacked wildly for close to 20 days and actually still couldn’t take it down!”

Hearing these discussions, Ye Yuan’s heart sunk to the bottom of the valley.

Absolute Heaven Barrier actually lost a Hegemon!

This was simply a bolt out of the blue to Heaven One.

Furthermore, South Qi Giant City was actually currently suffering a frenzied assault now.

An army of 300 thousand besieging South Qi Giant City actually still had not conquered it after attacking for 20 days!

Feng Xiaotian was amazing! Hearing the news, Ye Yuan no longer had the mind to continue staying in the blood race anymore too.

He was just about to go find Yang Qing, but Yang Qing was already one step ahead of him.

These few days, his heart was burning with anxiety, waiting for Ye Yuan to leave seclusion all this while.

“No need to say anymore. We’ll go back immediately!” Ye Yuan said.

“This ... How do we go back?” Yang Qing asked with uncertainty.

“Of course, it’s swaggering back!” Finished saying that, Ye Yuan immediately left.

Ye Yuan went to find Ye Wugui right away. The other party’s mood currently was clearly pretty good too.

A monster like Ye Yuan appearing in the clan, the front-lines also achieved a great victory.

The present blood race was really like the noonday sun.

“Bloodazure, you came just in time. This seat is looking for you for something!” Ye Wugui said very warmly.

Although he was a Hegemon, he also did not dare to treat Ye Yuan with too much impropriety now.

An existence that the mother stone split off a trace of origin for, what kind of level he could reach in the future was really hard to say. “Mn? City Lord Your Excellency is finding me for something?” Ye Yuan asked uncertainly.

Ye Wugui said with a smile, “It’s naturally a wonderfully joyous thing! Lord Wang Zuo has already decided to confer you as ‘Blood Divine Son.’ Within the next few days, he’ll announce to the entire blood race and conduct the conferment grand ceremony! Today, Absolute Heaven Barrier’s battle has already made a major breakthrough! My blood race is really blessed with two joyous events at the same time!”

‘Blood Divine Son’; this identity was extraordinary.

The blood race had Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons, True Sovereign Hundred Sons, and also the Emperor Sakra Ten Heavens!

But there was not a Blood Divine Son yet!

Who was the Blood Divine Son?

That was the entire blood race’s future!

Only a powerful existence who was acknowledged by the entire clan had the qualifications to be conferred as Blood Divine Son!

These few thousand years, the blood race had given birth to countless geniuses.

But, no one had been conferred as Blood Divine Son!

At present, Ye Yuan, a human, actually did it!

Becoming the Blood Divine Son, Ye Yuan’s status in the blood race shall become extremely transcendent!

He would be the successor of Wang Zuo!

Ye Yuan could not help being taken back when he heard that. But, thinking about it, he felt at ease too.

He obtained the mother stone’s reward. This held great significance.

His Dao sword was a heaven-defying object.

When the mother stone felt the aura of the Dao sword, it showed a seldom-seen acknowledgment of him.

This time, he really earned big!

But, Ye Yuan did not show the expected joy, shaking his head and saying, “Bloodazure has yet to make the smallest contribution. I can’t take on the title of ‘Blood Divine Son’ yet for the time being!”

Ye Wugui said in surprise, “Oh? What ... do you mean by this?”

Ye Yuan said solemnly, “South Qi Giant City has been fighting fiercely without rest. It’s precisely the time to build my career! Since Bloodazure wants to become Blood Divine Son, then how can breaking the Absolute Heaven Barrier, this kind of astonishing exploit, do without me?”

Ye Wugui frowned and said, “But ... South Qi Giant City is very dangerous! It’s probably not appropriate for you to go!”

Ye Yuan chuckled and said, “City Lord Your Excellency, if I died at South Qi Giant City, then am I still fit to become the Blood Divine Son? Furthermore, does my blood race have anyone who fears battle?”

Ye Wugui’s pupils constricted, and he said with a nod, “Okay, what you said is right! I’ll go and report to Lord Wang Zuo immediately and request him to make a final decision!”

Ye Yuan said, “Since I’m going, then it naturally can’t be me going alone! Presently, the True Sovereign Hundred Sons and Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons have just been chosen. They enjoy numerous privileges from the clan and should naturally serve the blood race too! City Lord Your Excellency, please let Ye Yuan lead them and render a contribution without equal!”

......

The next day, Ye Yuan brought the True Sovereign Hundred Sons and Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons and left Blood God Temple, returning to Heaven One Continent.

At the same time, the Blood God Temple announced to the world, conferring Bloodazure as the Blood Divine Son!

After Bloodazure broke through the Absolute Heaven Barrier and achieved a contribution without equal, he would undergo the conferment grand ceremony!

The moment this matter emerged, the entire blood race boiled over with excitement!

The impact of this matter was too great!

Who was the previous Blood Divine Son?

It was none other than precisely Lord Wang Zuo!

Furthermore, since Lord Wang Zuo ascended to the throne, there had been no more Blood Divine Son.

Today, another Blood Divine Son actually appeared!

However, no one questioned it! The might that Ye Yuan displayed during the hundred sons battle was suffocating.

If even this kind of monster could not be conferred as the Blood Divine Son, who else was worthy? “Well-deserving of being Lord Blood Divine Son! Before carrying out the conferment grand ceremony, he rushed to the most dangerous South Qi Giant City!”

“The blood race is mighty! Lord Blood Divine Son coming into being, our blood race shall unify all the heavens!”

“Lord Blood Divine Son shall return triumphantly and unify Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven!”

... ...

When they set off, all eyes were gathered.

The True Sovereign Hundred Sons and Saint Sovereign Hundred Sons all felt an upsurge of emotion!

Although they were just a mere 201 people, each of them was worth a hundred!

These 200 people were sufficient to match up to an army of tens of thousands! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Moreover, there was still Ye Yuan this freak!

He had once slaughtered tens of thousands of those in the same rank with his power alone!

At this time, everyone of the blood race believed that this team shall be the final straw to overwhelm South Qi Giant City!
