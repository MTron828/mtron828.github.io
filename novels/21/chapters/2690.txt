Chapter 2696: Huge Background!

Three years later, Little Dragon Girl Jingfei broke through to Jade Sovereign Heaven in one stroke, shocking the seven great sea regions.

And her dragon qi also successfully evolved to ninth segment!

Coupled with the Emerald Sea Divine Conch, her strength was absolutely by no means inferior to a half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven, or even stronger.

On this day, Ye Yuan bid farewell and left.

“Big Brother Ye Yuan, thank you!” Little Dragon Girl said with a complicated expression.

Ye Yuan garrisoned at Thistle South Sea Region for three years, making the six great royal clans not dare to act rashly without careful consideration.

To Ye Yuan, it was indeed doing everything that was humanly possible to help already.

After all, Black Flood Dragon King being crippled, it was him who provoked Ye Yuan first to begin with.

If it were somebody else, they might have directly slaughtered the entire Thistle South Royal Clan.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Don’t behave like a little grown-up; you’re still a kid. Cultivate well. The seven great sea regions are too small; the outside is your stage! If you feel bored, come to Heavenly South City to look for me and play.”

The gluttonous bug in Little Dragon Girl’s heart seemed to have been lured out all of a sudden and she said in surprise, “Big Brother Ye Yuan, is what you’re saying true?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course it’s true! Your current strength is enough to deter other royal clans. Even if you go out and play once in a while, they won’t dare to make a move without careful consideration as well. Of course, if they really dare to act rashly without careful thought, I’ll follow you back to destroy them!”

Little Dragon Girl was beside herself with joy and said, “Big Brother Ye Yuan is the best!”

Ye Yuan looked at Little Dragon Girl’s appearance and nodded with a slight smile. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This was how Little Dragon Girl originally looked like. These few years had suffocated her badly!

Looking at her appearance akin to being relieved of a heavy burden, Ye Yuan was rather relieved too.

… …

Returning to land, before reaching Calm South City, Ye Yuan already sensed that something was not right.

On the way, he had already been attacked by several waves of true spirits.

Furthermore, the closer he got to Calm South City, the more true spirits he encountered.

Of course, these true spirits’ cultivation realms were not high. They did not pose a big threat to Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised. Could it be that some unforeseen event happened to this Calm South City?

In this region, they were mostly invaded by the sea race. There would rarely be true spirits that dared to come out and riot.

Then where did these true spirits come from?

With doubts in his mind, Ye Yuan could not help picking up the pace.

Nearing Calm South City, Ye Yuan could not help drawing a breath of cold air.

Below the city walls, it was densely packed full of true spirits. The number was simply impossible to calculate.

These true spirits surrounded Calm South City tightly and launched attacks frenziedly.

Calm South City’s city protecting grand array was already in a precarious situation under the frenzied attacks.

Ye Yuan could even see Su Yi pacing back and forth like an ant on a hot pan on top of city walls.

“What in the world happened? Calm South City is close to the sea, why would there be so many true spirits? Logically speaking, there’s only the Myriad Demons Mountain that has so many true spirits! Could it be that these true spirits all ran out of the Myriad Demons Mountain? Furthermore, Calm South City is in such imminent danger. Why didn’t Heavenly South City and the other eight cities rush to the rescue?” When Ye Yuan saw this scene, he could not help being full of doubts.

“Quickly look! There’s a human there, kill him!”

“He’s mine! You’re not allowed to snatch!”

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

… …

Ye Yuan did not intentionally hide his figure. Very soon, he was discovered by the true spirits at the back.

When they saw Ye Yuan, it was like seeing delicious food, rushing over one after another.

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and sword energy swept, more than ten true spirits were instantly killed.

Ye Yuan did not use much strength to deal with these small fries.

Below Limitless Sublime, he could practically instantly killed them.

For a moment, tragic wails were continuous.

The commotion at the rear attracted the attention of the true spirit army very quickly.

They were attacking the city with all their strength, there was no defense at the rear at all.

Ye Yuan’s sudden appearance completely disrupted the true spirit army’s siege.

“Mn??What happened?” Greenrock was currently commanding the army to attack the city when he suddenly discovered that there was chaos at the rear, and his brows could not help furrowing together.

He was this true spirit army’s commander. His original body was a green-furred Greenrock Beast. His strength already reached lower Jade Sovereign heaven.

Seeing as the city protecting grand array was about to be breached, but then someone threw a wrench in the works halfway, it made him very angry.

Straining his eyes and looking into the distance, he saw that a figure was currently pressing onward crazily.

His army could not stop that person at all.

There were even some Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum commanders who were killed by him in one exchange too.

“Humph!?Ignorant fool, just based on you alone, you want to save a city too? All generals heed my order! Give up the siege, and kill that boy for me!” Greenrock said with a loud roar.

“Roar!”

All true spirits got the order and immediately turned around and surrounded Ye Yuan.

The sudden turn of events below the city made the expression of Su Yi who was on top of city walls change.

“What happened??Mn??There are reinforcements? Why … Why is there only one person?” Su Yi focused his eyes and looked, and immediately discovered clues.

But very soon, he saw that there was only a single figure among the ten thousand beasts and could not help being disappointed.

But very soon, his brows furrowed together and he muttered to himself,?“Mn??Why is this figure somewhat familiar?”

Boom!

Suddenly, there was a huge earthquake. Hundreds of true spirits were directly crushed into meat paste!

It turned out that Ye Yuan brought out the Heavenspan Mountain and directly suppressed them all!

In such a densely packed situation, the Heavenspan Mountain was seriously too useful.

Boom!

There was another huge earthquake, several hundred true spirits were directly crushed again.

The current Ye Yuan directly transformed into a celestial deity, lifting up the giant mountain and directly suppressing the enemies. How could those true spirits dare to approach?

This giant mountain was too scary.

It was just that once they retreated, they directly collided with the true spirits that rushed up from behind. The entire army immediately became a mess.

However, a large empty space was immediately vacated around Ye Yuan.

Su Yi’s pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “It’s Third Hall Master! Is … Is he going to rush in alone? Is he crazy?”

When Greenrock saw the power of the Heavenspan Mountain, not only was he not surprised, he had a look of wild elation instead.

Heavenly spirit treasure!

As long as he killed Ye Yuan, this treasure would be his!

But currently, inside Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, Mi Tian was incredibly shocked!

“Boy, where did you get this thing?” Mi Tian’s voice practically changed pitches.

The shock in his heart currently could be seen.

Ye Yuan had a puzzled look and said, “This matter can’t be explained in a few words. It was suppressed in the lower realm that I grew up in by some guy, but it was refined by me in the end. This item is merely a heavenly spirit treasure. You shouldn’t be so surprised, right?”

Heavenly spirit treasures were indeed exceptional treasures when placed in Rainclear Continent.

But Ye Yuan knew that he was unable to assess Mi Tian’s realm at all. Hence, Mi Tian should not have any interest in this level of treasure.

But Mi Tian’s reaction made Ye Yuan realize that the origin of the Heavenspan Mountain seemed to be extraordinary!

“Merely a heavenly spirit treasure??Huhu!?This object shocked the 33 Heavens back then. Its power is unimaginable! This appearance now is merely a bright pearl that’s covered in dust, that’s all! Talk about this matter later. You’d best resolve the issue in front of you first!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan could not help rolling his eyes, his heart itching like it was scratched by a cat.

Back then, he felt that this Heavenspan Mountain was somewhat extraordinary. Because the Wordless Heavenly Skill’s cultivation method was extremely formidable. He did not expect that it really had a huge background.

But it was indeed not the time to get to the bottom of things now.. Because Greenrock was already here!
