Chapter 2853 Dimensional Level Blow!

True grade entering profound grade was a huge leap.

Just as Holy Son Cang Yongning back then, he had long already stepped into the realm of true grade at Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum. His aptitude was naturally significantly worse when compared to the Extreme Medicine Sect’s disciples.

In the Extreme Medicine Sect, to be an expert, entering true grade was the most basic requirement.

But there were scanty few who stepped into profound grade from true grade!

The vast majority of heavenly alchemists barely managed to step into profound grade when they were at grade eight realm.

There were even some who could not break through to profound grade at all.

Those who broke through to profound grade at grade seven realm were all peerless geniuses!

Being able to advance to profound grade at initial-stage grade seven, those were all geniuses among geniuses, targets of heavy grooming by the sect.

This kind of geniuses had the possibility of reaching peak grade nine in the future!

Grade six realm reaching profound grade, other than Zhou Pinespring, there were really not many of them who could be found.

Lu Daoyi’s ultimate goal was just to step into the realm of profound grade before grade seven.

It could be seen from this how difficult it was for true grade to enter profound grade!

As for a grade five realm profound grade expert, it was simply unheard of!

But today, it appeared!

Profound grade was a kind of heavenly pill grade, and also a kind of realm.

Reaching profound grade showed that one’s understanding of Alchemy Dao already attained a higher level, and the person had a chance to pry into that fleeting and ephemeral realm of chaos heavenly master!

The current Ye Yuan already entered a state of forgetting oneself, allowing Alchemy Dao rule to strike him.

Taking this step was only a matter of course. But Ye Yuan’s pursuit went far beyond profound grade.

The realm of Cloudmount blooming flowers with a single thought had broadened Ye Yuan’s horizons, opening another window for him. He was still reading the book, still immersed in Dao.

As for when he broke through, he was completely unaware.

He was still immersed in the knowledge of the jade slip, but the Extreme Medicine Sect had long already exploded!

This news was like Cloudmount’s blooming flowers with a single thought, instantly sweeping across the entire sect.

As for the news of Lu Daoyi’s beating Wang Ji, it was instantly drowned out.

All 19 battles, all victories!

More than half of the grade six realms were swept across by him!

The imposing momentum that Lu Daoyi used more than half a month to create was instantly crushed by Ye Yuan’s breakthrough.

Although I scorned him, he died because of me!

This matter was completely and utterly a dimensional level blow!

He and Lu Daoyi were originally not in the same dimension.

With regards to Lu Daoyi’s actions and his challenges, Ye Yuan did not pay attention to it at all.

But Ye Yuan’s breakthrough had completely shattered his limelight without the slightest mercy!

At this time, there was already no one who would go and pay attention to a genius disciple who viewed Zhou Pinespring as his goal.

It was because there was already a genius who completely surpassed Zhou Pinespring! Ye Yuan’s surpassing was not a little bit, but it was an all-round surpassing! Before this, the Extreme Medicine Sect’s record was entering profound grade at peak grade six.

But now, Ye Yuan directly refreshed this record to grade five!

Increased it by a full major realm!

You’re a genius?

Huhu, go to one corner and play!

In the eyes of true geniuses, there was only surpassing, and it was not chasing!

In Ye Yuan’s eyes, there were no opponents at all.

Hence, he naturally would not waste his energy and go compete in alchemy with Lu Daoyi as well.

When Qin Shan’s lineage heard this news, everyone was petrified for a full quarter of an hour!

Ye Yuan, this ‘jumping clown,’ had long already been tossed to the back of their minds by them.

In their eyes, Ye Yuan was never an opponent.

Their opponent was Zuo Chen! Giving Ye Yuan a blow was just in order to make Zuo Chen look bad. That was all. It had nothing to do with Ye Yuan. But the weakling without the slightest sense of existence in their eyes became the most dazzling pearl on East Victory Mountain Range!

This kind of contrast made them feel despair!

Especially Lu Daoyi! “Oh, since that’s the case, then what are you still waiting here for? You can go.”

“Leave, I won’t compete with you. Because there’s no meaning at all.”

“Whatever you think.”

Ye Yuan’s calm and collected tone seemed to still be echoing in his ears.

It sounded so ridiculous at that time.

But now, they finally understood that it was not stubbornness and not stubbornly hanging on, but that he did not treat him as an opponent at all!

At this very moment, when Lu Daoyi recalled half a month ago, it was as if Ye Yuan’s eyes did not have him at all! He, this peerless genius after Zhou Pinespring, was directly overlooked!

The one who ignored him was a ‘rookie’ whose realm was even lower than his!

“How could this be? How could this be …”

Lu Daoyi mumbled under his breath, clearly unable to accept this result.

But this news had already been confirmed. Furthermore, it was the Scripture Library’s Ancestor Fan Li who personally verified it!

At the time of the breakthrough, there were also many people who saw it.

“I’m not convinced! I … I’m going to challenge him!” Lu Daoyi suddenly roared and rushed out.

Qin Shan flicked his sleeves, and Lu Daoyi returned to where he was.

Qin Shan looked at Lu Daoyi, his expression seemingly complicated. Heaving a light sigh, he said, “Daoyi, forget it! Although it’s very demoralizing to say this, Master has no choice but to tell you, it’s impossible for you to defeat him in your lifetime! You guys … are too far apart!”

“Puhwark!”

Lu Daoyi spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly and fell to the ground with a loud bang, passing out.

When the group of senior apprentice brothers saw this scene, their faces had some reluctance.

“Master, is being so straightforward too demoralizing to Little Junior Brother?” Wang Lin could not resist asking.

Qin Shan sighed again and said, “He’s completely not on the same level as Ye Yuan in alchemy! Even Grandmaster Pinespring is likely not on the same level when compared to Ye Yuan too! If Daoyi doesn’t realize this point, then his road of Alchemy Dao will collapse here, and he can forget about improving another inch! In reality, his talent is really very high, and he even has hope of catching up to Grandmaster Pinespring. There’s no need to compare to that one. If he understands this point, he’ll still have great accomplishments in the future! It’s just that … it’s probably very, very difficult!”

Qin Shan was a genius too. He naturally knew about the pride of geniuses!

The more genius one was, the prouder they were!

Hence, Extreme Medicine Sect’s proudest person was Zhou Pinespring. Lu Daoyi’s talent was comparable to Zhou Pinespring. How could he not be proud?

However, the more it was so, the harder it would be to extradite himself when faced with such a blow that left him black and blue all over!

Whether or not he could walk out of it, that would depend on how strong his inner heart

was.

Qin Shan bursting this bubble was hoping that Lu Daoyi would reestablish after destruction, striving harder after knowing humiliation!

Otherwise, he could not think of other ways!

But even so, this difficulty was still too high!

A hint of indignation flashed across Wang Lin’s eyes, and he said, “On what basis? On what basis could that punk break through to profound grade? He’s just grade five realm!”

Recalling that scene from half a month ago, he felt that Ye Yuan was very laughable at that time.

But now, he felt that Ye Yuan’s posturing level was lofty and out of reach!

Many people liked to pretend to be aristocrats after becoming rich, demonstrating their extraordinariness from before and after.

However, true aristocrats would never show off.

True aristocrats were very low-profile.

Hence, when a local tycoon ran into a true aristocrat, that was really losing face all the way to their grandmother’s house. They were like this! Qin Shan’s face also had a hint of unnaturalness. Clearly, he did not dare to believe it either.

“Yeah, what right does he have? The matter blew up so big. Most likely, over at the Absolute Heaven Barrier that side, they all will be shocked too, right?” Qin Shan muttered.
