Chapter 3056: Negotiation!

“Out! Coming out!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd.

After a time interval of one day, Ye Yuan’s figure directly stepped out of the void and returned to everyone’s line of sight again.

This time, Ye Yuan was much closer to those treasures.

“This guy actually really didn’t die!”

“Why? A restriction that even Hegemon Realms can’t do anything about; why can he?”

“Unparalleled in Alchemy Dao, crushing his peers! And now, his Formation Dao can actually crush Hegemon Realms?”

… …

The competition among peers was indeed shocking, but it was far from the shock of the present.

After all, Hegemon Realm powerhouses were paramount existences.

Many people knew that Hegemon Yun Xiang was a Hegemon level heavenly formation master!

Did that mean that Ye Yuan, this grade eight heavenly formation master, already crushed Hegemon Yun Xiang?

Yun Xiang felt somewhat at a loss of face.

Actually, she was conflicted.

Regarding treasures, she naturally coveted it.

But, if Ye Yuan could really take treasures, her face would be lost.

Mn, killing him might be the best option.

But she said one thing right. It became harder and harder toward the back.

The time that Ye Yuan stopped over for each step also got longer and longer.

But at this time, no one rushed him anymore.

Everyone was being patient, waiting for him to take the next step.

This step, Ye Yuan spent an entire day.

Then it was a day and a half, two days, three days.

Seven days later, Ye Yuan disappeared again.

Half a month later, when Ye Yuan appeared in front of everyone again, he was already standing in front of a treasure.

Everyone’s breathing became nervous.

This was a grade five grandmist treasure, an entirely black long saber.

Ye Yuan leaned over to pick it up. No abnormality happened at all.

“Hiss?… He really did it! He actually really did it!” Zhang Hexin exclaimed.

They were thrashed by this restriction many times and thought that Old Man Heavenless was playing them.

In the end, no!

It was just that they were incompetent!

“Really inconceivable! This boy actually got the treasure from under Old Man Heavenless’ hands!” Kong Hai said in shock.

“This boy is truly remarkable! Given enough time, he’ll absolutely be a terrifying existence! He might be able to reach Old Man Heavenless that height!” Hegemon Yu Xian said with a light smile.

When they heard that, the expressions of humanity’s Hegemons all changed.

This was clearly said for them to hear.

Another Heavenless appearing, this was not some good thing!

Although they knew that Yu Xian had the intention of provoking them, the apprehension in their hearts grew thicker.

Humanity’s three supreme heavens did not want to be ruled by a low-level plane.

“Heh,?Sister Yu Xian, rather than sowing discord here, it’s better to discuss how to distribute the treasures,” Zhang Hexin said with a cold smile.

Yu Xian smiled slightly and said, “That feather coat should have been left behind by my feather clan’s senior. It’s not overboard that we ask for it, right?”

Kong Hai said, “This seat is getting the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear!”

Zhang Hexin sneered and said, “Kong Tan, you haven’t seem to have figured out the situation yet! You can forget about the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear.”

Kong Hai was indifferent and said with a chuckle, “You guys wouldn’t really think that the fiend race only has this seat alone who came, right? My fiend race Hegemons has always acted independently. But do you really think that they will look on with folded arms?”

Zhang Hexin’s face fell, and he said, “Then are you sure that just five of us from the human race came? Enough crap, the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear, there’s no share for you!”

… …

Several mighty Hegemons started negotiations and were already dividing up the treasures.

It was as if these treasures were already in their hands.

To tell the truth, no matter how monstrous Ye Yuan was, they did not take him seriously too.

Martial strength was the final right to speak.

The others were merely unorthodox paths.

Three month later, Ye Yuan retrieved all of the treasures.

All the Hegemon Realms had looks of excitement.

In this restriction, there were three chaos heavenly treasures, seven grandmist treasures, and also a chaos heavenly medicine.

Especially the Scarlet Flame Heaven Howling Spear, it was even of the highest grade among chaos heavenly treasures.

Even to Hegemon Realm powerhouses, this was also a significant wealth.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Ye Yuan walked out of the restriction and was immediately surrounded by the seven great Hegemons. He could not run even if he wanted to.

Zhang Hexin reached his hand out and said in a cold voice, “Hand it over!”

Initially, he only found Ye Yuan displeasing and wanted to toy him to death.

But who knew that this kid actually really did it!

Got to say, in addition to the shock, it was also an unexpected surprise.

He naturally did not know that he had actually contributed his strength in it too.

Ye Yuan was naturally reluctant to submit. He said coolly, “Now, do we have the capital to negotiate?”

Zhang Hexin laughed loudly and said,?“Hahaha?… You, a measly little Emperor Vast Heaven, wants to negotiate with us, these Hegemon Realms? Don’t you find this joke very hilarious?”

“Hahaha?…”

Everyone started laughing.

Ye Yuan’s current performance was indeed very ridiculous when it landed in everyone’s eyes.

Undefeated in pill refinement, undefeated in Formation Dao, but you were not a Hegemon in the end!

“Kid, if I give you a few thousand years, you might have the qualifications to challenge the few of us. But right now, you’d better put away your pride,” Hegemon Yun Xiang said with a snicker.

Ye Yuan’s gaze landed on Yun Xiang’s face, and he said coolly, “The ones who haven’t figured out the situation are you guys! You’re a Hegemon level heavenly formation master, right? I really feel ashamed for you. You are already at this realm, but you don’t even know where you are.”

Yun Xiang’s two eyes narrowed, and she said, “Boy, are you scaring us?”

“Scare you all??Hur hur,?you guys called this as a restriction just now?” Ye Yuan pointed at that dense forest and said.

Yun Xiang’s brows furrowed slightly, and said, “If it isn’t a restriction, what is it?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Since you’re Hegemon Realm, then you should know what the number one grand array in all the heavens is, right?”

Yun Xiang could not help laughing as she said, “Are you testing this seat? The number one grand array in all the heavens, is naturally the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s Heaven formation! You aren’t telling this seat that we’re in the ‘Heaven’ formation now, right?”

“Otherwise, what do you think?” Ye Yuan said.

“Haha,?boy, after solving a restriction, do you really think that you can display your slight skill in front of this seat? Heaven formation is the number one killing formation since ancient times, its power boundless. Forget about you; even we all, these Hegemon Realms, will face certain death if we enter too. With just the likes of you, you don’t even have the qualifications to enter Heaven formation!” Yun Xiang said disapprovingly.

Honestly speaking, when they heard Ye Yuan say Heaven formation, the hearts of all the Hegemons tensed up too.

After all, the Hegemons who fell inside Heaven formation were too many.

But, hearing Yun Xiang say so, their hearts eased up again.

“Punk, this seat will say it one last time. Hand over the treasures!” Zhang Hexin said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan smiled lightly and suddenly took a step.

“Courting death!” Zhang Hexin’s expression turned cold and suddenly threw a punch over.

Against the punch of a Hegemon Realm, an Emperor Vast Heaven would definitely die without a doubt.

The expressions of Yang Qing and the rest changed wildly, but it was too late.

Boom!

This punch slammed into the air.

Ye Yuan’s figure actually disappeared.

Yun Xiang’s pupils constricted, and she cried out in alarm, “How is this possible! This … is already out of the restriction territory. How did he do it?”
