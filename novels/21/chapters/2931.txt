Chapter 2930: Breaking Through the Shackles, Unprecedented and Unrepeatable!

Qin Shitian breaking through to ten wroughts made the entire Nirvana Soul Hall boil over with excitement.

This was a glorious moment!

Nine wroughts to ten wroughts, just one wrought, but the difference was like the difference between heaven and earth.

Ten wroughts virtually represented immortality!

In the same rank, no matter how exceedingly formidable your methods, you could not kill a ten wroughts soul denizen too!

Even when facing an Emperor Realm, ten wroughts had the power to protect themselves too!

Furthermore, once the bottleneck of ten wroughts was opened, there would be no bottlenecks from now on.

This was also to say that after breaking through to Emperor Realm, although the soul body was unable to reach ten wroughts, one could cultivate all the way to ten wroughts!

Apart from this, when ten wroughts advanced, the soul body would have a huge improvement. The lousiest would also start with six wroughts.

This way, it saved countless cultivation time.

All in all, the benefits were too numerous to enumerate! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Ten wroughts! It’s really ten wroughts! I didn’t expect that I actually witnessed the birth of ten wroughts with my own eyes!”

“Sure enough, Ye Yuan’s sharp edge previously, it was all serving as a foil to a new genius. He’s ultimately just a stepping stone!”

“After today, Qin Shitian, this name, will shake the entire soul race!”

Updates by

… …

Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian’s competition already spread from mouth to mouth.

Those who were idle in the Nirvana Soul Hall practically all came to watch the battle.

Ten wroughts, this was something that had never happened before in the Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall.

Now, ten wroughts powerhouse was really born. Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall was completely ignited from top to bottom.

Qin Shitian, this name, reverberated throughout Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall.

The several Great Emperors were extremely agitated too.

Nine wroughts, they could still maintain composure.

But ten wroughts, the significance was completely different.

Ten wroughts, if he did not fall, he had very high hopes of stepping into Hegemon Realm in the future!

Once Qin Shitian became a Hegemon, then Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall would also attain Dao and ascend to heaven!

Meanwhile, Zhou Yu and He Chen, two people, felt unbelievably ashamed of their unworthiness.

Before this, they were called the Scarlet Drill Three Sons together with Qin Shitian.

But now, Qin Shitian soared to the heavens in one bound. They could only fade into the crowd.

Although their performance was pretty good too, in front of Qin Shitian, they were bleak and dim.

Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm, “You guys, look! Ye Yuan can’t make it anymore!”

Everyone got a shock, looking toward Ye Yuan’s Soul Refining Furnace. They discovered that Ye Yuan’s soul body actually started to dissipate little by little!

Soul body collapsing and dissipating, these were the precursors to disintegrating!

However, there was already no one who cared too much.

No one would care about losers. The winner was that person who wrote history.

“Ye Yuan’s ultimately just a stepping stone. He’s currently already useless!”

“Yeah, if not for him, it would have been impossible for Qin Shitian to soar to the heavens in one bound too. It’s him who let Qin Shitian have a grand awakening at the final moment.”

“Heh, his arrogance was too high. That’s why he would bet with Qin Shitian on these 42 kinds of Dao fires. In the end, he played himself to death.”

“If they just bet 35 kinds, he still had hope of surviving. Now, everything has evaporated!”

“What a shame, such a heaven-defying genius.”

… …

Seeing this scene, many mocking voices came from the crowd, feeling that Ye Yuan courted death himself.

Of course, there were people who lamented over Ye Yuan too.

But there were more that were just ridiculing him.

No one would sympathize with losers.

“Hahaha,?Ye Yuan, thank you! Without you, it would have been impossible for me to break through to the realm of ten wroughts! It’s you who made me Qin Shitian!”

In the Soul Refining Furnace, Qin Shitian already thoroughly completed the transformation.

The originally weak him became incomparably powerful again.

In the Soul Refining Furnace, his soul body seemed especially clear.

Even if there were 35 kinds of Dao fires covering, it could not hide his light too.

Ten wroughts soul body was sufficient to forcefully have a frontal confrontation with the human race and true spirit clan’s fleshy body major powers!

But very soon, Qin Shitian could not laugh anymore.

Ten wroughts soul body was very strong, almost undying and imperishable!

But, in the end, it was just almost.

Hegemons would die, let alone mere True Sovereign Heavens.

Each chaos Dao fire in the Soul Refining Furnace had exceedingly formidable power. Furthermore, the attributes were different.

Now, 35 kinds of Dao fires had already built up inside. The power could be imagined.

When the 36th Dao fire descended, Qin Shitian screamed miserably, his soul body immediately suffering heavy injuries.

At first, he still had strength to yell.

But, as the number of Dao fires increased again, he lost his breath very quickly.

Furthermore, very soon, Qin Shitian’s soul body also started to collapse and dissipate..

Everyone were virtually suffocating!

Could it be that the Qin Shitian, who created a heaven-defying legend, was actually going to die here?

Looking over at Ye Yuan there, the dissipation of the soul body became more and more serious.

His soul body had already became blurry, being completely surrounded by dozens of Dao fires, virtually unable to see clearly anymore.

“It’s all this damn Ye Yuan. He’s useless himself and actually still had to drag Qin Shitian into the water!”

“Could it be that the Qin Shitian, who just created a miracle, was going to die here?”

“You guys, look, Great Emperor Eastsun’s expression is already ugly to the extreme. Most likely, he wishes to pull Ye Yuan out now and kill him again, right?”

… …

Indeed, Great Emperor Eastsun’s expression was very ugly.

He knew that Qin Shitian had already reached the brink of life and death survival.

There were still two Dao fires remaining, but when the 42nd Dao fire descended, it would be a devastating blow.

Could the Qin Shitian under the current state pull through?

Great Emperor Eastsun hated Ye Yuan to the extreme. If it was just agreed on 35 kinds, Qin Shitian would be like the noonday sun now, without the slightest danger.

But 42 was too many!

Boom!

When the 42nd Dao fire descended, Qin Shitian gave a muffled groan, his soul body almost completely collapsing.

But he still held on with tremendous willpower!

Everyone held their breaths again, staring at him without turning their eyes.

“Hang in there! Hold on!” Great Emperor Eastsun gritted his teeth as he said.

In the Soul Refining Furnace, Qin Shitian’s soul body was gruesomely contorted, both eyes blood-red.

At this time, he was already struggling to the extreme.

Life and death, it was hanging by a thread!

“Ye Yuan, I won’t perish together with you! I, Qin Shitian, am destined to step into Hegemon Realm!?ARGGHHHHH!”

Qin Shitian seemed to be crazy, frenziedly squeezing out all of the potentials in his body.

Time slowly trickled by, 15 minutes, two hours, three hours.

Four hours!

Swoosh!

A streak of azure light suddenly flew out. Qin Shitian’s nearly collapsed soul body actually flew out of the Soul Refining Furnace at this moment!

The lock was removed!

Qin Shitian made it through 42 kinds of chaos Dao fires!

Two brilliant rays of light shot out of Great Emperor Eastsun’s two eyes. A powerful soul force instantly wrapped Qin Shitian up!

Qin Shitian’s soul body could be seen recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye!

“Hahaha?… I, Qin Shitian, made it through 42 kinds of Dao fires! 42! Not saying that it’s unrepeatable, but it should be unprecedented, right? Ye Yuan, you didn’t expect it, right? This battle, it’s ultimately me, Qin Shitian, who won! Henceforth, I, Qin Shitian, soared to the sky in one bound, soaring in the heavens! And you, are just my, Qin Shitian’s, stepping stone!”

Feeling joy after surviving a calamity, Qin Shitian let out a long laugh.

Everything was settled!

“Huhu,?not bad! Really good! Shitian, Master is proud of you! From now on, nobody can stop your marching footsteps anymore!” Great Emperor Eastsun looked at Qin Shitian and said with relief.
