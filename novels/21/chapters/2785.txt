Chapter 2791: Fighting His Way Out!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Move!”

Ye Yuan shouted fiercely, controlling dozens of flying swords to kill a grand completion Saint Sovereign HEaven powerhouse again.

At this time, Ye Yuan already slew three grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens!

But, in the time that he killed these three people, another five came one after another!

These five people were all grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

However, Ye Yuan was not afraid, urging the Universe Sword Formation to the extreme.

After fighting fiercely for a long time, the five great war generals were long already a spent force. At this time, they could only barely manage to resist.

If it dragged on a while longer, he might not be unable to kill one or two of them.

Unassuming when not killing, but when he went on a killing spree, then he would kill until the other party got chills!

Otherwise, there would be endless troubles.

After all, this place was a large sea region, with countless powerhouses!

“Human boy, you slaughtered my Qian Kui Sea Region’s powerhouses. I’ll definitely flay your skin and pull out your tendons today!” Yun Yang roared angrily.

Helplessly watching three grand completion Saint Sovereign Heavens die in front of them, these people became even crazier. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Today’s battle, this Ye showed leniency time and again. It was you all who kept pushing me! Now, you’re blaming this Ye for killing people!?Huhu,?do you really think that I’m scared of you all? Once slaughter starts, I’ll go on a killing spree then!”

As he said, Ye Yuan urged the sword formation and rushed toward Sword Formation frenziedly.

Among this group of people, Starshine was the most heavily injured and was already an arrow at the end of its flight.

Want to kill, then it was naturally him!

Of course, fighting until now, Ye Yuan’s injuries were not weak either.

But, compared to his opponents, it was still within an acceptable range.

“Damn it! Why aren’t those guys here yet!” When Whalebillow saw that Starshine was almost unable to withstand, he was anxious until his face contorted.

But the current Ye Yuan completely had a reckless fighting style that disregarded his life. His offensive power was extremely fearsome.

Being in the sword formation, there was no leeway for him to be distracted.

Just as they were fighting fiercely, several powerful auras suddenly arrived with a howl!

When Whalebillow and the rest felt this aura, they were instantly ecstatic.

“Hahaha?… Kid, the six great war generals in the nearby three great sea regions are about to arrive soon! This time, see if you still won’t die!” Whalebillow said with a wild laugh.

Ye Yuan naturally felt these powerful auras too, and he was also slightly surprised in his heart.

So many general powerhouses, he could not bear it too!

Once surrounded, it would really cost him a layer of skin even if he did not die.

“Is that so? Then … you all have a batch die first before talking!”

As he said, Ye Yuan suddenly formed a seal. Hundreds of sword lights all pierced toward Starshine with a whistle!

Starshine only felt that it was all sword light blotting out the skies and covering the earth. There was nowhere to evade at all!

“Starshine!”

Whalebillow roared loudly, but it was already too late to want to save.

In desperation, the martial techniques of Whalebillow and the rest smashed towards Ye Yuan frenziedly.

Ye Yuan had long expected it, spatial rule instantly unfolding.

However, it was the joint attack of four great war generals. The power was too terrifying.

Boom!

Boom!

Two explosions sounded out, Starshine and the grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven beside him were directly blown into nothingness by Ye Yuan without the slightest resistance.

Swoosh!

And right at this time, an afterimage streaked across the sky. Ye Yuan actually took advantage of this interval and flew away.

But at this time, Ye Yuan’s abdomen was empty. Flesh and blood actually could not even be seen.

This strike earlier, he avoided the vitals. But he still could not completely avoid it in the end.

“Damn it! That boy is seriously injured. Chase after and kill him!” Yun Yang yelled, a group of people chasing after Ye Yuan frenziedly.

Among the five people, Whalebillow was the closest to Starshine.

Now, Starshine was killed, Whalebillow was furious to the extreme.

“Motherf*cker! This kid sustained such heavy wounds, but he can actually still run so fast! Don’t let Your Father catch up if you have the ability!”

Ye Yuan was severely injured at this time. Even his speed slowed down too.

However, he already swallowed two grade five heavenly pills. His injuries and divine essence were in the midst of recovering rapidly.

These two grade five heavenly pills were precisely grade five true grade heavenly pills. The recovery power was extremely shocking.

In the past few decades, Ye Yuan put most of his energy on alchemy.

He devoted himself to studying the Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook as well as the Alchemy Dao records obtained from the Labyrinth Divine Palace. At present, his Alchemy Dao already improved further!

Although grade five heavenly medicines were precious, since Ye Yuan was heading out, it was naturally impossible not to make any preparations.

Otherwise, in the vast sea, he would be exhausted to death by people too.

Yun Yang and the rest were all grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses. Their speed was naturally not slow.

It looked like the distance from Ye Yuan was dwindling little by little.

But very soon, they discovered that the aura on Ye Yuan’s body grew stronger and stronger, and his speed got faster and faster.

At this moment, Whalebillow and the others could not help but want to curse and swear.

“Fucking hell! Is this kid immortal? Why is he recovering so fast? Brat, don’t run if you have the capabilities!” Whalebillow stomped his feet in annoyance.

Only a moron would not run!

Dawdling with you here, to wait for death?

But Ye Yuan felt that there were more than ten powerful auras currently howling over from several directions ahead.

Among them, there were six powerhouses who were not weaker than Whalebillow and the other powerhouses who were currently rushing over swiftly.

Ye Yuan naturally planned it out when he chose to break through the encirclement at this time.

Being heavily injured, he was unable to face ten great grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven transformation powerhouses. He would be biting off more than he could chew.

Once surrounded by them, then he would really be unable to bear the consequences of failure.

Ahead, six powerful auras already got closer and closer, their figures already appearing in the horizon.

Whalebillow was overjoyed when he saw the situation and said, “Bing Chen, Zhou Lin, Fei Yan, delay this punk! Don’t let him run away!”

The powerhouse called Bing Chen said with a loud laugh, “Whalebillow, your Qian Kui Sea Region is too weak! So many people besieging a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven and you actually let him run away!”

“Haha,?want us to act, sure! Add another Sea Soul Pill each!” Zhou Lin took the opportunity to extort.

Whalebillow did not have time to bargain with him and immediately said, “No problem! Attack for me!”

Bing Chen laughed loudly and said, “Brat, you, a human, actually dare to act wildly in the sea region. You’re really tired of living! Stay behind obediently. Your Lord Bing will use you to trade for Sea Soul Pills!”

Done talking, the six people’s auras released, transformation martial techniques smashing over towards Ye Yuan crazily.

With six great transformation powerhouses making a move, how shocking was the commotion?

At this time, Ye Yuan’s injuries were already 60% recovered. The large hole in his abdomen pretty much recovered already too.

Facing the pincer attack of six great powerhouses, he did not reduce his speed, but divine essence erupted instead, his speed skyrocketing!

When Whalebillow saw this scene, his pupils could not help constricting, and he cried out in shock, “Be careful, this boy’s sword formation is extremely formidable! Starshine already died at his hands just now!”

Bing Chen and the rest were naturally not fools. Just now, they only had the intention of nauseating Whalebillow and the others.

Before coming, they were already aware of it.

Furthermore, for a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven to be able to escape from the hands of five great transformation powerhouses, it indicated a lot of things in itself.

Therefore, they did not hold back on this strike but called forth all their power!

However, hearing that Starshine actually died, these people were still shocked.

But at this time, they already clashed in close quarters!

Ye Yuan ignored the rest and rushed straight for Zhou Lin, his speed swift to the extreme.

Just now, when he suddenly accelerated, he actually barely managed to avoid the six people’s combined attack.

And at this time, Universe Sword Formation emerged in full force!

“DIE!”

Ye Yuan roared, countless sword lights sweeping toward Zhou Lin.

“Damn it! Save me!”

Zhou Lin’s expression changed wildly, wanting to avoid Ye Yuan. But it was already too late.

Both parties’ speed was too fast!

Describing it was slow. But actually, it was merely a blink of an eye, and both parties already clashed in close quarters.

Boom!

A terrifying explosion transmitted out of the void. Zhou Lin instantly turned to ashes under this blow!

A streak of flowing light cut across the sky, Ye Yuan actually forcefully killed his way out amidst the encirclement of six people!

However, Ye Yuan was not any better.

The combined attack of six great transformation experts, he did not defend at all either. It could be seen how terrifying this attack was.

He only avoided the core of this strike.

But ultimately, he was unable to completely avoid it.
