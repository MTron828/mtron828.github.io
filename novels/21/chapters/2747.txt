Chapter 2753: Frivolous Life Like a Dream!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan turned around to look at the number one cultivation room and said rather regretfully, “It’s a shame. There are not enough heavenly crystals. If I could go out after cultivating to grand completion fourth form, I would be much more confident in dealing with the Pill Alliance.”

When the others heard, they could not help being speechless.

There was only this person who treated this place as paradise, right?

If it were others, they would have long been demoralized by these peerless heaven’s chosen powerhouses until they did not even have the desire to cultivate any longer.

Although Big Yellow was decent, he basically had no hope of charging into the top 100.

Sometimes, it was not what effort could achieve.

When your talent reached a bottleneck, it was useless no matter how hard you worked.

But, talent plus hard work, that was terrifying.

Ye Yuan was precisely this sort of person.

Very soon, Ye Yuan led everyone and left the Labyrinth Divine Palace.

Over several hundred powerhouses entered. But, at this time, there were only slightly more than a hundred people left.

However, following Ye Yuan, these hundred people made great harvests.

“Younger Brother Ye, there’s nothing else to say. When the time comes, we’ll definitely go all out at your word of command!” Saint Exalt Purplesun cupped his fists and said.

These few years, they had ceased the idea of opposing Ye Yuan.

This guy was even more terrifying than Zhuo Bufan back then!

Opposing him, the outcome would be very tragic.

Furthermore, entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace this time, Ye Yuan helped them out a lot. They would definitely be able to improve further after going back this time and entering closed-seclusion.

With Saint Exalt Purplesun making known his position, the other Saint Sovereign Heavens were extremely grateful to Ye Yuan too.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “When the time comes, I’ll still have to trouble everyone. Everyone, leave first. This Ye still has matters to attend to and won’t be seeing everyone off.”

Everyone knew that this Heavenspan World was Ye Yuan’s hometown. Hence, they naturally did not stay either, directly leaving.

After everyone left Heaven Fragmented Continent, Ye Yuan flipped his palm. A crystal clear bottle appeared in his hand.

This small bottle contained precisely the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation.

Voidsnap Immortal Condensation was a natural treasure that could strengthen the origin divinity!

After Jade Sovereign Heaven, the key to break through was the origin divinity!

Origin divinity communicated with heaven and earth and comprehended Great Dao.

If the origin divinity was not strong enough, it was extremely hard to break through Saint Sovereign Heaven.

And this was also precisely one of the reasons why Saint Sovereign Heavens were few in numbers.

Yan Jadetrue most likely wanted the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation in order to break through to True Sovereign Heaven.

“Senior, this Frivolous Life Like a Dream, is it really useful?”

While talking, Ye Yuan had another small bottle in his hand, containing a mass of transparent liquid inside.

Frivolous Life Like a Dream; the name sounded very beautiful, but it was a kind of extremely formidable poison.

This poison did not target the physical body. It only targeted the origin divinity!

Poisons that could target the origin divinity were very rare. Refining them was extremely difficult too.

But, once inflicted, it would be like a bone-infesting maggot, being difficult to eradicate.

Unless one encountered a top-level heavenly alchemist, otherwise, it would be difficult for immortals to cure it!

Not only did Ye Yuan find the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation in the Treasure Depository Pavilion, but he also found this Frivolous Life Like a Dream!

“Kid, it’s also that you’re lucky! If you don’t have this Frivolous Life Like a Dream, you really wouldn’t be able to do anything to that guy and can only be taken advantage of fully by him! Relax. Even if that whatever Pill Alliance’s alliance chief comes, he can’t cure the Frivolous Life Like a Dream poison too! The strength of the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s heavenly alchemists isn’t what you can imagine!” Mi Tian said confidently.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and dripped a drop of Frivolous Life Like a Dream into the Voidsnap Immortal Condensation.

The Voidsnap Immortal Condensation was as usual.

Frivolous Life Like a Dream was colorless and tasteless. Even Ye Yuan was unable to detect its existence too.

“That Yan Jadetrue concealed extremely deeply and understands my abilities very well too. He likely won’t believe me so easily!” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

“That’s easy! Cultivate the Divine Emergence to the second level, your soul force will directly break through rank five and reach the level of Saint Sovereign Heaven! At that time, purging this Frivolous Life Like a Dream with the Divine Emergence’s secret arts isn’t something difficult. Although the Frivolous Life Like a Dream is formidable, when matching up against the Divine Emergence, it’s a level worse!” Mi Tian said.

When Ye Yuan heard that, his eyes could not help lighting up.

With this, he really had no worries anymore.

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan had Big Yellow stand guard and he started cultivating the second level of Divine Emergence.

Divine Emergence’s power naturally went without saying.

Ye Yuan had long already cultivated the first level to the realm of grand completion. His origin divinity already reached peak Jade Sovereign Heaven long ago.

It was even stronger than peak Jade Sovereign Heaven!

As long as he successfully cultivated the second level, the origin divinity reaching the level of Saint Sovereign Heaven was virtually inevitable.

Ye Yuan sat down cross-legged. In his sea of consciousness, his chaos origin divinity started operating the Divine Emergence’s second level cultivation method.

A powerful origin divinity undulation quietly released.

“This is … chaos origin divinity! What a powerful origin divinity undulation! It’s likely significantly stronger when compared to even ordinary peak Jade Sovereign Heavens! After he cultivates to grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven, breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven will simply happen naturally without additional effort!” When the Big Yellow by the side saw this, he could not help being speechless.

When other people were breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, it was a game of death, and they might not be able to break through either.

But Ye Yuan was amazing. Other people’s bottleneck did not exist for him at all!

With chaos origin divinity plus this powerful origin divinity undulation, breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven had practically become inevitable.

There were extremely few cultivation methods to cultivate the origin divinity.

Even if there were, it would not have a real effect either.

With the help of heavenly medicines, reaching grand completion Jade Sovereign Heaven was not hard.

The hard part was the origin divinity cultivating to the realm of grand completion at the same time too.

In reality, the origin divinity realm of more martial artists was far lower than their cultivation realm.

Therefore, it was virtually impossible for them to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven.

The true grade Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill that Ye Yuan refined for Big Yellow and the rest previously, it was actually forcefully comprehending Heavenly Dao and letting those people’s origin divinities rise to a higher level. That was how they succeeded in one stroke.

Of course, this was also because the origin divinity realms of Big Yellow and the rest were up to par. That was why there was this effect.

If it were others, even if there was the true grade Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill, it might not work too.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation lasted half a year.

On this day, Ye Yuan’s origin divinity undulation suddenly skyrocketed!

The sky above Heaven Fragmented Continent, thunder was faintly rolling!

Big Yellow’s expression suddenly changed, and he looked toward Ye Yuan in amazement.

“This … This … His origin divinity realm directly broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven?”

This kind of breakthrough was too fantastical.

When other people were breaking through, it was the cultivation realm that reached first and the origin divinity lagging behind.

Ye Yuan was good, his cultivation realm was just peak middle Jade Sovereign Heaven, but his origin divinity actually directly reached Saint Sovereign Heaven!

With such a powerful origin divinity, even if Ye Yuan did not use any martial techniques, one origin divinity attack would directly instantly kill a Jade Sovereign Heaven!

Freak! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Too damn freakish!

How could there be such a freakish person in this world?

“Pffft!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan spurted large mouthfuls of blood. His entire person started swaying too.

Big Yellow’s expression changed, and he said, “Damn it, his cultivation realm is too low and can’t bear a Saint Sovereign Heaven’s origin divinity!”

“Relax, he won’t die! This kid’s potential is huge!” Big Yellow was just about to go up but was stopped by Mi Tian.

And at this time, a shocking dragon might rose to the sky from Ye Yuan’s body!

“Roar!”

Ye Yuan emitted a shocking dragon roar from his mouth!

His aura was also rising frantically!
