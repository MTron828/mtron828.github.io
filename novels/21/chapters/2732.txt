Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“That’s South Fighting Sky Sunflower!”

“Water Mirror Immortal Pistil!”

“My God, these are all grade four and grade five heavenly medicines. Natural treasures that are seldom seen outside are everywhere here!”

... ...

There was a large open space ahead.

On the empty lot, there were all kinds of rare heavenly medicines everywhere.

When all the powerhouses saw this, each and every one of their eyes turned red.

With these heavenly medicines, even if they were not refined into heavenly pills, it would be sufficient for them to break through too!

“All get lost for this exalt! When is it your turn? Tang Quan, you bring people over and collect all of these heavenly medicines! Don’t leave a single one behind!”

Right at this time, Saint Exalt Waycloud suddenly erupted with a powerful pressure, making the faces of all the Jade Sovereign Heavens change abruptly.

With a Saint Sovereign Heaven present, there naturally would not be a share of the good stuff for them.

Everyone’s expressions were very ugly, this Saint Exalt Waycloud was too overbearing!

The Seven-star Heavenly Sect ate the meat and actually did not even let them drink the soup.

While Tang Quan had a look of excitement. In this open space, there were probably thousands of grade four and five heavenly medicines!

Some of the heavenly medicines, their medicinal properties were virtually overflowing, practically making his cultivation realm loosen up.

Without a doubt, he would absolutely be able to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven after eating them!

At that time, he would be a Saint Exalt powerhouse too!

Thinking up to here, Tang Quan was really incredibly excited.

As for Wei Yu’s death, he no longer cared about it a long time ago.

“Huhu, Saint Exalt Waycloud, truly awe-inspiring! I wonder if our Dazzling Cloud Heavenly Sect can collect some?”

A middle-aged man in inconspicuous clothing walked out of the crowd.

The man’s aura also rose rapidly!

Another Saint Sovereign Heaven!

When Dazzling Cloud Heavenly Sect’s powerhouses saw him, each and every one of them was elated.

“Saint Exalt Skyfortune!”

“Sorry about that, our Azure Flame Heavenly Sect also wants a share of the loot, wonder if that’s allowed or not?”

While talking, another figure walked out.

“Saint Exalt Yuan Yi!”

The third Saint Sovereign Heaven!

The expressions of the hundreds of Jade Sovereign Heavens present changed abruptly.

Normally, the Saint Exalt powerhouses whose movements and traces were elusive and secretive, three of them actually showed up the moment they appeared!

“Huhu, your sect is still really overbearing! Us itinerant cultivators actually can’t even get any share?”

While talking, another three imposing auras surged to the sky. What could it be if not Saint Sovereign Heavens?

“That’s ... Saint Exalt Purplesun!”

“There’s also Saint Exalt Chongshan and Saint Exalt Yichen!” These three are all itinerant Saint Exalt cultivators!”

“There are ... actually six great Saint Exalt powerhouses. Wouldn’t we all, these people, become cannon fodders?”

... ...

They clearly did not expect that six great Saint Exalts actually appeared in one go!

These heavenly medicines that were extremely rare in the outside world moved them.

Waycloud’s expression was a little ugly.

He figured that there would be other Saint Exalts coming but did not think that there would be so many.

Of course, he did not know that there were actually still seven great Saint Exalts that did not reveal their identities.

These seven people were clearly a little more cautious.

It was just that, they could hide from the eyes and ears of the other Saint Sovereign Heavens, but they could not hide from Mi Tian’s probing.

“Humph! You all are finally willing to show yourselves!” Saint Exalt Waycloud said with a cold snort.

“Huhu, seeing so much good stuff around, we naturally have to show yourselves! If we still don’t show ourselves, wouldn’t it all be swallowed up by you alone?” Saint Exalt Purplesun said with a smile.

“Showing yourself that early is useless too. Coveting people’s grandmist treasure but in the end, failed to get it and even got your face kicked, why bother?” Saint Exalt Skyfortune said with a chuckle.

It was not that no one among these Saint Sovereign Heavens was moved. It was just that they were more cautious than Waycloud.

Although they also did not believe that Big Yellow was a Saint Exalt true spirit, his performance had indeed been extraordinary.

True spirits capable of suppressing half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens were not often seen!

Only Saint Exalt Waycloud could not hold it in and made a move.

Sure enough, he got covered in stink.

“Skyfortune, don’t be smug! That large yellow bull’s strength is extraordinary. He’ll come over in a while. This exalt wants to see how you deal with him!” Waycloud said with a cold snort.

“Therefore, before he comes, let’s hurry up and divide these natural treasures! Could it be that he can still steal it from all of us?” Saint Exalt Yuan Yi said impatiently.

His words also made everyone stop quarreling.

The appearance of six great Saint Exalts made those Jade Sovereign Heavens realize that they probably would not even get to drink soup anymore.

Especially those itinerant cultivators, it was completely impossible to get anything.

It was impossible for itinerant Saint Exalt cultivators to speak up for them too.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The six great Saint Exalts practically moved out at the same time, moving toward that stretch of medicinal land.

Those sect disciples also moved out at the same time.

At this time, whoever snatched more, whoever would naturally earn a big haul.

But, right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

There was a wizened ancient tree in the medicinal land.

This ancient tree was unremarkable previously as if it had already withered up.

But, when those powerhouses entered the medicinal land, ten thousand thin vines suddenly emerged from the ancient tree.

Puchi!

The dozen over Jade Sovereign Heavens that rushed at the forefront were directly pierced through by the thin vines.

Then their bodies rapidly shriveled up, becoming dried-up corpses.

The blood essence in their bodies was actually directly sucked dry.

The six great saint sovereigns rushed at the forefront. At this time, their expressions could not help changing wildly, their bodies immediately erupting with powerful strength.

Without holding back in the least bit, they directly executed their specialties, chopping towards the thin vines.

But what shocked them was that those thin vines actually could not be chopped off!

The full power strike of a Saint Sovereign Heaven actually could not chop these tiny and thin vines off!

The thin vines only fell back briefly and tangled over again very quickly.

The six people’s faces changed wildly. How could they still dare to covet the heavenly medicines, flying back one after another?

“This is a chaos aberrant, Bloodcentral Devil Vine! Its strength is likely grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven! Everyone, quickly retreat!” Saint Exalt Waycloud shouted.

It was easy to enter, but hard to get out.

These thin vines entangled them frenziedly, not letting them retreat.

Fortunately, the strength of Saint Sovereign Heavens was indeed fearsome. After experiencing a round of bitter fighting, the six great Saint Sovereign Heavens broke out of the encirclement.

And those Jade Sovereign Heavens who rushed into the medicinal land, virtually none of them were spared, all being sucked into mummified corpses.

The ancient tree that absorbed the blood seemed to have been rejuvenated with the second coming of spring, the entire big tree becoming fresh and alive.

The other Jade Sovereign Heavens had long already retreated to an extremely far place, to avoid being affected.

The six great Saint Exalts looked at the Bloodcentral Devil Vine that was brandishing its vines, their expressions all extremely ugly.

“Damn it! This Bloodcentral Devil Vine actually disguised as a withered tree!” Saint Exalt Skyfortune gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

“This Bloodcentral Devil Vine’s aura became much stronger. It seemed to have suffered heavy injuries before! It wants to absorb blood essence to recover its strength!” Saint Exalt Purplesun said.

“Looking at so many heavenly medicines but not being able to get them, it’s really aggrieving!” Saint Exalt Waycloud gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

These grade five heavenly pills held great significance to them, these Saint Sovereign Heavens.

Being able to see but not able to get them made these Saint Sovereign Heavens depressed until they wanted to vomit blood.

“Really a bunch of fools! People have long entered this Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm before. If these heavenly medicines were really easy to get, would it be your turn?” Right at this time, a disdainful voice sounded out.

The expressions of the six great Saint Exalts turned dark. Turning around to look, who could it be if not Ye Yuan?

“Brat, stop making sarcastic comments! Don’t think that by bringing along a Saint Exalt true spirit, you’re invincible! Don’t you forget, we’re currently six great Saint Exalts!” Waycloud said with a cold snort. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Huhu, who has the time to make sarcastic comments with you! I only came to tell you guys that since you all can’t get them, then I’ll be keeping them!” Ye Yuan said coolly.
