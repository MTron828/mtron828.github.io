Chapter 1655 Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets

“W-What did you say?”

Jing Lu somewhat doubted whether his ears heard wrongly or not.

Uncle Huang ... actually yielded?

Wasn’t it just a measly capital city? What was he afraid of?

Uncle Huang pulled Jing Lu to the side and whispered, “Whatever there is, I’ll tell you in a while. This place isn’t a place to talk.”

Finished talking, he brought Jing Lu along and directly entered the auction venue.

When everyone saw this scene, they were extremely surprised and started guessing Ye Yuan’s identity one after another.

Very clearly, Melody Sun Imperial City did not dare to provoke Riverluck Capital City, while Riverluck Capital City did not dare to provoke Ye Yuan.

Calculating this way, Ye Yuan’s identity was big until it was a little frightening.

Just what origin was this Origin Deity Realm young man?

In the crowd, someone suddenly shouted, “Eh? Isn’t this Master Ye Yuan? Why haven’t you gone in yet? The auction is going to start in a jiffy.”

Ye Yuan took a look, feeling that he was a little familiar. It should be a powerhouse who bought medicinal pills back then.

This powerhouse clearly did not know what happened just now.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Going in right now, a small accident happened just now.”

That powerhouse smiled and said, “Then let’s go in together?”

Ye Yuan said, “Please!”

“Haha, to be able to walk with Master Ye Yuan, this Liu is extremely honored!”

Done talking, the two people entered side by side, leaving behind everyone with shocked faces.

“Wasn’t that the Soaring Sky Gang’s gang leader, Liu Changtian? He’s a sixth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse. He was actually so respectful toward that young man!”

“I remembered! The Medicinal Pill Shop that caused a stir in the entire city these past few days, the stall owner seemed to be called Ye Yuan!”

“It’s actually him! No wonder! No wonder! Even the three major factions have to queue up obediently in front of him!”

“Heh heh, Young Master Jing kicked a metal plate this time.”

...

Ye Yuan and Liu Changtian entered the main hall. A middle-aged man came up to greet them.

When Liu Changtian saw the arrival, his expression could not help changing.

“I didn’t expect that Alliance Chief Li actually appeared in person!” Liu Changtian said with a respectful bow.

Alliance Chief Li was naturally the Sword Star Alliance’s alliance chief, Li Xing.

Liu Changtian did not expect that for the sake of this auction, Li Xing actually showed up in person.

Li Xing smiled and said, “There are a few important people here tonight. This Li has no choice but to come. Master Ye Yuan, there was a little unhappiness just now. It was all our Sword Star Alliance who failed to look after well. Master Ye, please don’t take it to heart.”

Hearing this, Liu Changtian had a look of astonishment.

What kind of status did Li Xing have? He was actually so meek and humble toward an Origin Deity Realm!

This Ye Yuan’s identity seemed to have an even greater background than he imagined!

Ye Yuan had never seen Li Xing before. But hearing the two people’s conversation, he knew that this was the Sword Star Alliance’s alliance chief.

“Some small fries always like to jump around, no worries,” Ye Yuan said coolly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Actually, Liu Changtian did not know that Li Xing was also extremely shocked in his heart.

Ye Yuan, an Origin Deity Realm, actually sent the first-layered heaven Divine Lord Jing Lu flying with one punch! How could he not be shocked?

Perhaps, this was a true genius!

Compared to Ye Yuan, Jing Lu this so-called genius was like a frog at the bottom of a well. He was forever only able to see that tiny patch of the sky!

Celestial Deity?

So what if Celestial Deity?

In the eyes of empyreans and heavenly emperor powerhouses, celestial deities did not even count as ants.

Li Xing said, “Younger Brother Liu, I won’t accompany you anymore, please go ahead. Master Ye Yuan, I’ll bring you to the supreme box room. That place won’t be disturbed by outsiders.”

Liu Changtian had an awkward look as he said with a smile, “You guys go ahead!”

This auction venue had a total of four regions. Heaven, earth, and man, three levels. There was also a region that was normally not open to the public, that was the supreme area.

But this time, they actually opened up the supreme area.

What astonished Liu Changtian even more was that an Origin Deity Realm actually entered the supreme area!

One had to know, with Liu Changtian’s identity and status, he could only enter the earth rank region today too.

Li Xing led Ye Yuan to a box room in the supreme area. The space inside the private room was very large, the decors extremely extravagant.

There was a simple and archaic wooden table in the center. One look and Ye Yuan knew that it was made from Nine Profound Heaven Spirit Wood and that it was a priceless treasure.

On the table, various styles of pastries and spirit tea were neatly arranged.

By the side, there were even four extremely pretty maids serving on one side.

In front, there was a massive light screen, projecting the scene from the auction below in its entirety.

All in all, every little bit here evidently showed the inhabitant’s status.

“Master Ye Yuan, you be inconvenienced a bit and stay in this No. 4 supreme box room for the time being,” Li Xing said.

Ye Yuan had a face like an old well devoid of ripples. It was as if unmoved by all these. He just said coolly, “I’ve troubled Alliance Chief Li, you go and busy with your own things.”

Li Xing said with a smile, “Alright, then this Li will take his leave. If Master Ye Yuan has any needs, let these maids go and notify me.”

Finished talking, Li Xing took his leave and left.

After going out, Du Mingliang came up to greet and whispered, “How was it, Alliance Chief?”

Li Xing’s expression was slightly dark as he said, “Indifferent whether granted favors or subjected to humiliation, style of talking uncommon, impressive in bearing. His background is definitely not small! Such a person isn’t what we can build connections with. Just send him away properly and that will do!”

Du Mingliang was also extremely surprised. He did not expect that the alliance chief’s appraisal toward Ye Yuan was actually so high.

...

These were naturally deliberately shown by Li Xing they all for Ye Yuan to see.

Displaying martial strength outside the door was not a dispute caused by personal feelings, but that he wanted to let the three major forces know that his origins were extraordinary.

How could an ordinary faction possibly groom an Origin Deity Realm martial artist who could jump realm and defeat a Divine Lord Realm?

His goal was very simple. It was the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone.

If let people know that he merely came out of a low-level imperial city, with his means, it would definitely attract a lot of covetous eyes.

Even though he was not afraid, he could forget about getting the Boundless Heavenly Soul Stone.

Since that was the case, he might as well feign an unfathomable appearance. He would let everyone think that his background was extraordinary.

This way, there was naturally no one who dared to touch him.

However, Ye Yuan also deeply sensed Riverluck Capital City’s complexity.

Behind the three major forces, there was definitely a Celestial Deity powerhouse manipulating everything.

Furthermore, this Celestial Deity powerhouse was not even an ordinary Celestial Deity powerhouse.

Otherwise, there was no way that even Melody Sun Imperial City’s young patriarch did not dare to be insolent here.

Before long, in the light screen, an old man slowly walked up the stage and said in a clear voice, “Everyone, this old self is Jian Zhentao. I was invited by Riverluck Capital City to take on the role of host of this auction. Everybody rest assured, the things auctioning this time, this old self has already inspected them, they are all genuine goods. Furthermore, this old self believes that the auction articles in time definitely won’t disappoint everyone.”

After the old man finished his self-introduction, someone immediately exclaimed below the stage, “Jian Zhentao! Could it be a member of the Jian Family?”

Jian Zhentao stroked his beard and said with a smile, “That’s right, this old self is precisely Heavenly Emperor Profound Secrets’ descendant, a disciple of the Jian Family!”

Finished talking, the aura on Jian Zhentao’s body released. A mysterious aura reverberated amidst the hall.

“Profound secrets divine essence! It’s really a member of the Jian Family!”

“Once profound secrets appear, the genuine and the fake are immediately distinguished! Turns out that Elder Jian is a member of the Jian Family, pardon me, pardon me!”

“Haha, with Elder Jian here, we can rest assured!”

When everyone saw this mysterious divine essence, they immediately paid their respects to the old man.
