Chapter 1208: The King Returns!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone was incomparably shocked. Such a terrifying palm was actually blocked by this black-clothed person so nonchalantly.

It looked like this black-clothed person’s strength was actually not beneath Kanuo’s!

“It’s really you! You really didn’t die!” Kanuo said solemnly.

That black-clothed person said coolly, “You haven’t die, so how could I dare die?!”

“Humph! You’re really lingering on relentlessly!” Kanuo said with a cold snort.

“The one who’s lingering on relentless should be you, right? Being suppressed so many times, you’re still so persistent!” the black-clothed person said.

Kanuo’s face turned black, and he said, “Suppressing this god, you have to pay at the cost of your life! This Immortal Grove Region will eventually be this god’s!”

“You can stop daydreaming! With me around, you can forget about succeeding. Moreover, as long as Ye Yuan grows up, most likely ... it wouldn’t be suppressed so simply!” the black-clothed person said coolly.

“Then, that will also have to wait until he grows up!” Kanuo said with a cold snort.

“You can rest assured. With me around, he’ll grow up!” The black-clothed person’s words exuded faint confidence.

Long Teng did not have the joy of surviving a disaster at all. His entire person was currently akin to being struck by lightning, staring fixedly at this black figure in front.

The current Long Teng was agitated until he shuddered all over!

Even though the black-clothed person had his back facing him, he was too familiar with this person! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Is ... Is it you?” Long Teng asked quiveringly.

The black-clothed person’s entire person was shrouded in the black cloak, unable to see his features at all.

But these were all not obstacles to Long Teng.

The black-clothed person slowly turned around and opened his mouth to say: “Old partner, it’s been hard on you these few years.”

Long Teng’s entire body trembled. He opened his mouth but did not know what he should say.

50 thousand years already, he had once harbored the mentality of getting lucky too, thinking that this person did not die yet, and would still return to fight side-by-side with him.

But Long Teng silently waited for 50 thousand years, and he did not return.

Only all the way until Ye Yuan appeared did Long Teng start a brand new life.

Fighting side by side together with Ye Yuan, he felt like it was the same as before, making his hot blood boil.

Long Teng thought that he really died and would never come back anymore.

But now, he actually appeared miraculously.

Unfortunately ... Long Teng was just an artifact spirit now and could not cry at all.

Otherwise, he would really like to have a good cry.

“Tsk tsk, today’s moving scenes are really many! Not bad, not bad, since you brothers have reunited, then go down below together and catch up about old times,” Kanuo said with a look of ridicule.

The black-clothed person said to Long Teng, “Catch up again later.”

Finished talking, the black-clothed person turned around and said to Kanuo, “How dare the general of a defeated army speak of bravery!”

Kanuo said indifferently, “General of a defeated army? To think that you also dare to say it! That great battle 50 thousand years ago, the victor was not decided yet! At present, this god had a huge increase in strength and wants to weigh whether or not your strength is sufficient to contend with this god!”

The black-clothed person said coolly, “As you wish.”

When Kanuo saw the black-clothed person’s composed look, his heart involuntarily sunk.

But he was not that sort of character who could be frightened away with a roar.

In the present Divine Realm, only this black-clothed person was able to contend with him.

As long as he killed him, who else in this world could stop his footsteps of unifying the Divine Realm?

The black-clothed person extended his hand and grabbed. A bizarre force instantly shuttled through the void.

Yue Mengli’s and Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Yue Mengli was unaware of what was going on. She only felt a blur before her eyes, and she actually returned to her original place!

This shock was by no means insignificant!

“Senior Long Teng, this ... What’s going on here?” Yue Mengli said to Long Teng.

When Long Teng saw Fang Tian’s move, his eyes lit up too.

Seems like ... Fang Tian’s strength was even stronger than before!

Seeing this scene, Long Teng’s heart was also put back in place.

“No need to panic. It’s Brother Fang who teleported you guys back with his great magical ability! Today’s situation already took a favorable turn!” Long Teng said smilingly.

“Brother Fang?” Yue Mengli looked towards the black-clothed person with a puzzled look.

“That’s right. He’s the Vast Heaven Pagoda’s previous owner, Fang Tian!” Long Teng said with a smile.

Yue Mengli’s beautiful face was incomparably shocked and she said in disbelief, “He’s ... Senior Fang Tian? He ... He’s actually still alive!”

At this time, Fang Tian reached his hand out and beckoned. The Vast Heaven Stele actually broke away from Ye Yuan of its own accord and flew into his hand.

The feeling of amiss in Kanuo’s heart became stronger and stronger. After he obtained the Fiendsource Bead, although his strength did not recover to its peak, it already recovered 70%.

The current him was even stronger than when he encountered Fang Tian back then!

Could it be that in these 50 thousand years, Fang Tian’s strength had another significant increase?

But ... in this age where it was unable to break through to Deity Realm, how could this possible?

Rumble ...

All of a sudden, fiendish energy surged on Kanuo’s body. A black bead faded in and out on his forehead.

A terrifying aura instantly swept across every corner.

Two mighty supreme powerhouses matching powers, everyone had to give a wide berth.

But under the monstrous fiendish energy, Fang Tian was composed and collected.

People did not see him making any actions either. The Vast Heaven Stele suddenly erupted with rays of brilliant light!

Just this aura was far stronger than when in Ye Yuan’s hands/

“Humph! Not seeing for 50 thousand years, you’re still using this move? Looks like you’ve exhausted your bag of tricks!” Kanuo said with a cold snort.

When Fang Tian heard that, he said coolly, “Dealing with you, this move is enough!”

“Is that so? Then I’ll let you have a taste of the means after this god’s strength has spiked greatly! Bloodfiend Storm!”

Kanuo kneaded seals with both hands. A terrifying storm instantly enveloped Fang Tian’s figure.

Immediately, there was a foul wind and rain of blood!

This blood rain had extremely terrifying penetrative and corrosive ability. If ordinary martial artists were stained by a tiny bit, their souls would disintegrate at once too.

However, situated deep inside it, Fang Tian was shrouded in layers by the light halo emitted on the Vast Heaven Stele.

No matter how the wind and rain battered, I stand steadfast as a rock!

“Heaven and Earth Throw!”

Right then, the Vast Heaven Stele in Fang Tian’s hands suddenly disappeared.

Kanuo’s pupils constricted. An enormous blood palm suddenly smacked out, wanting to resist the Vast Heaven Stele’s heaven-shaking throw.

Bang!

A terrifying collision, no idea how many times more intense than Ye Yuan’s battle with Zhuge Qingxuan prior to this.

Everyone looked at those two figures in the sky with solemn looks. Even their breathing stopped.

These two people’s victory and defeat, they determined the Divine Realm’s future direction. It was not up to people to not feel deep anxiety.

Rumble ...

Bloodfiend Storm abruptly scattered. Kanuo’s figure actually flew out backward.

All of a sudden, Kanuo’s fiendish energy diminished considerably.

Seeing this scene, all of the dragon clan’s members had greatly roused morale on their faces!

“Hahaha, won! This mysterious powerhouse is so powerful, to actually be able to defeat even a Deity Realm powerhouse. Could he ... be a Deity Realm powerhouse too?”

“Finally saved! I feel that today was just like being tormented in an oil bath, too terrifying!

“Kill! Kill the fiend race!”

...

For a moment, war cries filled the air.

“Go!”

Kanuo practically did not have the slightest hesitation and directly shattered space, bringing his group of subordinates and fled at a splitting pace.

Zhuge Qingxuan’s expression changed a few times and finally entered inside too.
