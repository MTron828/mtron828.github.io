Chapter 2221: Army Setting Out for Jiu Shang!

“Hahaha!”

From inside the Priest Temple’s main hall, a burst of hearty laughter could be heard.

Wing’s laughter carried a trace of excitement, a trace of anticipation, and also a trace of shock.

“Dao pill! What an exceptionally talented boy! Just how long has it been and he already refined a Dao pill! This Heavenly Emperor really didn’t misjudge him!”

Ji Mo also said with vicissitudes of emotion, “Second Sage’s talent truly surpasses ancient and modern times! Master, you aren’t aware of this, but when I saw him refining the Chaos Samsara Pill, while in a trance, I thought that it was Master refining the pill!”

Wing smiled slightly and shook his head and said, “You’re wrong!”

Ji Mo was taken aback and said, “Wrong?”

Wing nodded and said, “His alchemy talent is naturally this world’s apex! But, since time immemorial, including Medicine Ancestor that fellow and I, which one isn’t extraordinarily talented? But who could have such accomplishment at his age?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ji Mo was deep in thought. Thinking about it, it was indeed like that.

Being able to reach the level of Dao, regardless of whether it was the Medicine Ancestor or Sacred Ancestor High Priest, they were absolutely this world’s most outstanding geniuses.

But even the Medicine Ancestor and Sacred Ancestor High Priest still paled in comparison in front of Ye Yuan’s astonishing talent!

This point, whether or not he admitted it, it was the truth!

Ji Mo gave a bow and said, “Master, please give guidance!”

Wing slowly said, “Cultivation emphasizes on cultivating the heart! The vastness of the Heavenspan World can’t be imagined. The river of time surges; how many geniuses are akin to schools of carps crossing the river? But existences that can stand above the clouds all have qualities that ordinary people don’t possess! Only character can magnify your talent limitlessly, and let you possess infinite possibilities!”

“Not arrogant, not rash, not greedy, no resentment! Calm and wise when encountering things, have great willpower and absolutely won’t concede defeat! This boy possesses all the qualities to become a peerless powerhouse! Talent can be reformed. At the very least, it isn’t considered too hard for me to want to make a pig become a Heavenly Emperor. But a pig is a pig! Even if it became a Heavenly Emperor, it’s also a pig! He will still be gluttonous and lazy, and put cultivation aside. But character needs the accumulation of time, needs the understanding of oneself.”

“Of course, this logic, this Heavenly Emperor only slowly comprehended them after a very long time too. Compared to him, it’s as if he already knew them inherently! If my conjectures are right, he must have had a major incident happen to him in his early years.”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s gaze was deep, his eyes exuding wisdom as if he had seen through Ye Yuan.

Ji Mo was alarmed inwardly as he listened!

These words would likely cause a mighty uproar when placed in the outside world.

The world placed high regard on talent and did not value character.

But in his master’s eyes, one’s character was even more important than talent!

In fact, in his master’s eyes, talent was utterly worthless!

When Ji Mo was still immersed in the midst of shock, Wing laughed coldly and said, “Medicine Ancestor that old fellow will only be like this for the rest of his life! Because his character has flaws! This half step, he’ll never be able to cross it! Ye Yuan and I will surpass him in the end!”

Ji Mo’s heart shook wildly. His master already foresaw the future in the Priest Temple?

“Master, Second Sage is so extraordinarily talented. Will he arouse Medicine Ancestor’s dread or not?” Ji Mo suddenly thought of something and asked.

Wing sneered coldly and said, “With his character, he’ll naturally dread him! However, it’s common knowledge to the world that Ye Yuan is my Priest Temple’s Second Sage. I reckon that he won’t dare to make a move! With this Heavenly Emperor’s understanding of him, he’ll definitely use all sorts of ways to suppress Ye Yuan, and let him fade into the crowd! It’s just that ... heh heh, no matter what method he uses, it will probably have the opposite effect and boost Ye Yuan’s growth!”

... ...

Concerning the Southern Border’s four-party talk, the Southern Border Alliance compromised, the Myriad Treasure Tower compromised, and the seven great reclusive ancient families compromised too!

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City monopolized a 60% share of the Southern Border!

Actually, if the Myriad Treasure Tower apologized properly, he would not mind yielding some share to the Myriad Treasure Tower on account of Empyrean Flutterfeather’s face.

After all, he and the Myriad Treasure Tower did not have a deep-seated hatred.

But Heavenly Emperor Riverback posturing in front of Ye Yuan, postured these shares away.

Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure was the heavenly emperor who was best at doing business in the Southern Border. How shrewd was he?

He had Heavenly Emperor Riverback represent him to go to apologize. It was in order to fight for this bit of share.

But Heavenly Emperor Riverback screwed things up.

Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure had bitterness but nowhere to vent, and so he could only swallow his broken teeth down his stomach.

However, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure promoted Empyrean Flutterfeather to the position of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s sixth manager. His status was second only to the Myriad Treasure Tower’s five great Heavenly Emperors.

And Empyrean Flutterfeather also became the first Empyrean Realm head manager in the Myriad Treasure Tower’s history. His status was incomparably venerated.

Toward people related to Ye Yuan, Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure also personally transferred them, making their statuses have massive promotions.

The following matters, Ye Yuan stood aloof from worldly affairs, the other three parties carried out a seesaw game that dragged on for days.

The remaining 40% share, naturally neither of these three parties were willing to give in half a step.

But the most tragic one was still the Southern Border Alliance.

They did not have pill formulas in their hands and had no way of contending with the other two parties at all.

But all these, Ye Yuan did not go and pay attention to it.

Ye Yuan continued using the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion’s name. Under Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma’s Pill Tower’s name, he officially set up the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion and opened Fragrant Medicine Pavilion’s branches all over the Southern Border.

This time, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City finally stood in front of the stage and chowed down on the largest slice of Southern Border’s cake.

More than a thousand years passed. Heavenly Eagle Imperial City groomed one batch of powerful alchemists after another.

The present Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was an alchemy holy land in reality as well as in name.

Even the other seven great holy lands were also greatly inferior when compared to it!

The quality of Fragrant Medicine Pavilion’s medicinal pills was extremely high. Coupled with Ye Yuan’s name that was well-known throughout the Southern Border now, the moment Fragrant Medicine Pavilion’s business opened, it was popular to the extreme.

Uncountable divine essence stones and uncountable spirit medicines, both came in a throng.

Toward this, apart from being envious, the other three parties could only accept it helplessly too.

Ye Yuan was very crafty, hurting their tendons and fracturing bones, but he did not press them into a dead end either.

Although 40% share was little, with the vastness of the Southern Border, they still had a massive revenue.

As long as it did not reach the point of a life-and-death struggle, there was no need for Heavenly Emperors to come forward.

On this day, outside Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, several dozen Empyrean powerhouses were shockingly present, the commotion shocking the heavens.

Ye Yuan swept his gaze across and said in a clear voice, “Everybody, this Ye has an irreconcilable hatred with Heavenly Emperor Jiu Shang! Today, this Ye will launch an offensive toward Jiu Shang Bodhidharma and end the enmity. Over a thousand years ago, Old Villain Jiu Shang suffered serious injuries. While he’s weak, take his life! With fellow daoists setting off today, this Ye is endlessly grateful. This Ye will remember this favor in my heart!”

“Master Ye is too courteous!”

“Master Ye’s enemy is our enemy, isn’t that so?”

“Fiend race’s evildoer should die in the first place! This time, render him beyond redemption!”

... ...

All the Empyreans immediately answered.

2000 years after coming to the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan’s strength finally grew to the point of wreaking vengeance and redressing hatred for his father!

The main culprit of Immortal Grove’s chaos was Jiu Shang!

Over a thousand years ago, Jiu Shang even infiltrated the Immortal Grove World and almost destroyed Immortal Grove.

This enmity, Ye Yuan never forgot about it.

Now, Ye Yuan’s feathers were already voluptuous and no longer had any scruples!

Hence, he launched an offensive toward Jiu Shang!
