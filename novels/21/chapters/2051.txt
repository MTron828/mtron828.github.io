Chapter 2055: You Can Get Lost!

Longwind Great Imperial Capital, Martial Dao was flourishing, powerhouses countless.

This place was in the scope of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s influence. Other forces could not stick their hands in at all.

Of course, that was just limited to the Southern Border Alliance’s rules that the other forces did not dare to enter.

Now, it was different!

Virtually overnight, Longwind Great Imperial Capital’s medicine shops had a large bunch emerge like bamboo shoots after the rain.

Tranquil Heart Pavilion, Purplecloud Establishment, Swallow Pill Hall, so on and so forth. But the one with the biggest reputation naturally had to belong to Cloudpill Establishment.

Cloudpill Establishment was a super faction that did not pale in comparison to the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Its appearance symbolized a full-scale war between the Myriad Treasure Tower and the Cloudpill Establishment, two great super forces.

After these medicine shops were opened, they immediately formed a united front.

Unified fixed price, unified distribution, unified sales.

The objective was very simple, target the Myriad Treasure Tower and chase the Myriad Treasure Tower out of Longwind Great Imperial Capital!

Ding Xiao, Cloudpill Establishment’s head shopkeeper, was skilled in management and had once chased all of five great grandmasters’ factions out of a great imperial capital. Among them was the Myriad Treasure Tower.

Empyrean Pilljade sending him to Longwind Great Imperial Capital was clearly to give the Myriad Treasure Tower a fatal blow.

The news of the Myriad Treasure Tower and Southern Border going to war already spread throughout the entire Southern Border.

And Longwind Great Imperial Capital had an utmost significance to this war.

Once the Myriad Treasure Tower was chased out of Longwing Great Imperial Capital, they would likely have to face an all-round defeat.

At that time, a rout would be like a landslide. It would be hard for the Myriad Treasure Tower to have the strength to salvage the situation anymore.

At this time, inside the newly-opened Cloudpill Establishment’s top floor hall, there was a large gathering.

The various major forces’ shopkeepers were all gathered here, discussing the ways to target the Myriad Treasure Tower.

“Shopkeeper Ding, that Chou Tianyu is impervious to reason and advice. We’ve already lowered the prices 30%. Not only did he not lower the price, but he also announced to the outside world instead that after three months, the prices of all of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s medicinal pills will rise 20%. I think that ... the Myriad Treasure Tower is taking the road to ruin here!” Tranquil Heart Pavilion’s shopkeeper said with a contemptuous look.

The other shopkeepers also nodded slightly, showing visible delight on their faces.

Originally they thought that it was a life-and-death battle. They did not expect that the Myriad Treasure Tower was too weak to stand up to the competition.

Another shopkeeper reminded, “Shopkeeper Ding, although we’re fighting a price war, it’s bound to cause Longwind Great Imperial Capital’s martial artists’ frenzied snatching. At that time, the medicinal pills must ensure adequate stock!”

Ding Xiao nodded and said, “Brother Lin rest assured, those big shots above know the importance of this battle and already order their respective factions’ Five-star and Six-star Alchemy Gods to go all-out in refining pills. You don’t need to worry about the stock of medicinal pills.”

Only then did Shopkeeper Lin let out a sigh of relief and said, “Then this Lin can relax. After this battle, even if Heavenly Emperor Myriad Treasure takes action, the Myriad Treasure Tower’s share will certainly shrink substantially too.”

This level of war, what it competed in was not whose household’s Seven-star Alchemy Gods were more.

Looking at the entire Southern Border, Empyrean powerhouses were extremely scarce too.

Reaching this realm, everyone would find Seven-star Alchemy Gods to refine pills in private, and not go to medicine shops to purchase medicinal pills.

The truly massive consumer demographics were the Celestial Deity Realm and True God Realm martial artists.

They had immense purchasing power and also very high demands for medicinal pills.

Hence, whoever that could capture the hearts of this group of martial artists would be the final winner!

For the same of this Longwind battle today, Empyrean Pilljade united the five great peak holy lands and already prepared a certain-kill strike. They would not give Empyrean Flutterfeather any chance at all.

But at this time, Ding Xiao’s brows furrowed and he said, “That might be the case, but according to what I know, Chou Tianyu isn’t such a foolish person. Even if they are confident that the quality of medicinal pills is better than ours, it’s also impossible to take the initiative to raise prices. What I’m worried about is that ... they have other contingencies!”

Shopkeeper Lin laughed loudly and said, “Contingency? What contingencies are there? I heard that for the sake of this war, the big shots gathered all of the most elite Five-star and Six-star Alchemy Gods together. We’re a level higher than them in terms of medicinal pills quality! When we achieve big success on our first operation in Longwind Great Imperial Capital, there will be no more Myriad Treasure Tower in the future.”

“Yeah, Shopkeeper Ding is too cautious. Although the Myriad Treasure Tower is strong, what do they count for compared to the entire Southern Border?” Tranquil Heart Pavilion’s shopkeeper said.

“Shopkeeper Ding is probably afraid of them rolling out some new medicinal pill, right? Huhu, my lord has long said before, even if they have one or two new kinds of medicinal pill’s pill formula in their hands, it will also be of no avail. Our medicinal pills’ quality is good and the prices are low. Martial artists’ aren’t fools either, so why would they be drawn over by one or two kinds of new medicinal pills?” Purplecloud Establishment’s shopkeeper said with a smile.

Ding Xiao’s brows gradually smoothened out and he said with a smile, “Huhu, it was indeed me who was overly sensitive. About this battle, this Ding has managed things for many years and completely can’t see their chances of victory. Even if an Eight-star Alchemy God makes a move, it’s also impossible to reverse the situation.”

...

At Pill Tower of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Suddenly, someone cried out in surprise.=, “Lord Ye Yuan came! Lord Ye Yuan came to the Pill Tower!”

Yun Yi’s entire body trembled, he knew that the moment of judgment had finally come.

But the others used pitying gazes to look at Yun Yi and also pitying gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

“Heh, Grandmaster Ye finally can’t hold out anymore, right? Now, it isn’t him choosing us, but whether we’re willing to acknowledge him as master or not anymore!”

“Once the Myriad Treasure Tower is defeated, if Grandmaster Ye wants to preserve his life, the best method will be to take us in as disciples and draw support from our factions to preserve his life. Otherwise, Heavenly Eagle’s destruction will be near at hand!”

“A shame about Brother Yun Yi. With Grandmaster Ye’s pride, he likely won’t choose him no matter what!”

...

Everyone discussed with laughter, Ye Yuan slowly walked in front of everyone.

“Yun Yi (Yang Xuan), pays respect to Master Ye!”

Yun Yi and Yang Xuan directly knelt down.

As for the rest, they had proud faces, not having the intention of kneeling at all.

“Huhu, Brother Yun, you still want to acknowledge him as master until now?” Duan Yunfei said with a disdainful smile.

Ye Yuan’s expression was calm as he looked at Duan Yunfei lightly and said, “Don’t you want to acknowledge me as your master?”

Duan Yunfei smiled and said, “Of course I want to acknowledge you as my master, but the winds of fortune changed. Now, it should be you begging me to acknowledge you as my master, and it’s not me taking the initiative to have you accept me.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yun Yi’s brows furrowed, and he said in a cold voice, “Duan Yunfei, you’re insolent! To actually be disrespectful toward Master Ye!”

Duan Yunfei did not care in the slightest and said, “Brother Ye, he might not even be able to protect his small life now, what are you still being so respectful toward him for?”

Ye Yuan took no notice of it. He just smiled faintly, gaze sweeping across the other people’s faces, and opened his mouth and said, “You all think so as well?”

At this time, Luo Tianqi stepped out of the ranks and said to Ye Yuan with cupped fists, “Grandmaster Ye, as long as you’re willing to take me in as a disciple and devote all your attention to teach me, my Luo Family will definitely ensure your safety! You should know, behind my Luo Family is Heavenly Emperor Darktime!”

Another person, a Six-star genius, said, “Grandmaster Ye, my Hai Family has a deep relationship with Empyrean Pilljade. As long as you’re willing to accept me as a disciple, my Hai Family will definitely put in a few good words in front of Empyrean Pilljade!”

In their view, all of them were now Ye Yuan’s protective talismans.

No matter how proud Ye Yuan was, did he still dare to not take them in as disciples?

His best way out right now was to be everyone’s master.

Ye Yuan looked at Luo Tianqi with a smile that was not a smile and said, “You’re called Luo Tianqi?”

Luo Tianqi clasped his hands and said, “Yes, Grandmaster Ye.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly and said, “You can get lost!”
