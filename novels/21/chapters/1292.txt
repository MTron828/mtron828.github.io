Chapter 1296: Husband and Wife Devising a Stratagem

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Little Brother Ye, all thanks to you for this trip! Otherwise, this Liang really wouldn’t know how to face my two daughters anymore.”

“Family Head is too kind, this Ye just knows some beast taming arts, and just happened to come in handy during the beast tide. Want to really thank, it should also be this Ye saying it. If not for Miss Wanru, this Ye would already be a corpse exhibited in the wilderness right now.”

“Haha, Little Brother Ye is too humble! Since Little Brother Ye has nowhere to stay, then stay in the Liang Family first. When Little Brother Ye finds a place to stay, it’s not late to move out then as well.”

“Then I’ll have to impose on Family Head.”

Liang Mingyu was evidently a sly old businessman at a glance, very worldly-wise.

But his strength was not weak. He was a middle-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm powerhouse.

These words sounded courteous, but it gave Ye Yuan a faint sense of alienation.

Even though Ye Yuan saved Liang Wanru and sister, Liang Wanru also saved Ye Yuan and even gave Ye Yuan to eat the Profound Essence Pill.

After listening to Zhang Shun’s report until the end, Liang Mingyu could not help feeling pain.

In Jewelhill City, the Profound Essence Pill was a life-saving medicinal pill.

He also knew that he owed Liang Wanru quite a lot these few years. Hence, that was why he left this medicinal pill to her for preserving her life.

He did not expect that his daughter actually gave it to a stranger.

But speaking of which, if not for this daughter being kind-hearted, saving an inconsequential Ye Yuan, she would probably have already perished in the belly of demonic beasts at this time too.

This was also considered kindness begets kindness!

But, toward this Ye Yuan whose background was unknown, Liang Mingyu held a little caution.

He doted on his eldest daughter very much and could not bear to make her upset, that was why he agreed for Ye Yuan to stay.

Later on, finding a reason, he was planning on chasing Ye Yuan out of the Liang Family. He did not wish to raise a cripple at home.

Actually, the intent of chasing away was already very clear in his words. He hoped that Ye Yuan could be a bit sensible and take the initiative to leave himself.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually pretended not to understand and climbed up along the shaft, lingering in the Liang Family.

Ling Mingyu was unhappy in his heart, but he naturally would not show it on the surface.

With his means, wanting to chase a cripple out of the Liang Family was too easy.

…

In a room, Liang Wanrong had watery eyes, lodging a complaint in front of a fat-headed and large-eared woman.

This fat lady was precisely her mother, called Wang Pianran.

It was just that this woman was completely mismatched with the ‘Pianran’ two words, giving people an extremely disgusting feeling1.

For this kind of woman to be able to give birth to a beauty like Liang Wanrong, it was also all thanks to Liang Mingyu.

But in the Liang Family, Liang Mingyu really did not dare to offend this female bigshot.

Back then, the Liang Family fell into a crisis and was almost destroyed.

It was all thanks to Wang Pianran marrying over, the Liang Family and Wang Family joining in marriage, that they survived the crisis.

Wang Pianran considered herself to be the savior and was very domineering in the Liang Family.

“Mom, you aren’t aware. That punk knows how to cast evil arts and cheated this daughter bitterly! I suspect that the beast tide this time was summoned by him originally. He definitely took fancy on Liang Wanru, that slut’s looks, and deliberately tried to ingratiate himself to her! Fortunately, Daughter was astute, otherwise … otherwise … Mother, you probably can’t see Rong-er anymore! Sniff, sniff …”

Liang Wanrong pounced into her mother’s embrace, crying her eyes out.

She gave embellishment to the events during the trip for Wang Pianran to hear.

Wang Pianran doted on this daughter like crazy in the first place. Even if she did not add colored details, she also would not be courteous towards Liang Wanru and Ye Yuan.

Seeing her daughter cry so mournfully, she was even more livid with rage, the flesh on her face piling together.

“Rong-er, you rest assured. Mother will definitely seek justice for you! It’s fine if that brat was a little sensible and leaves, but since he came to the Liang Family, then he only has one path to hell! Also, that slut, looks like Mother was still too lenient towards her normally. This time, I have to make her remember it well!”

A cold light shone in Wang Pianran’s gaze, and she shouted, “Come, men!”

A maidservant entered flusteredly and greeted with folded hands at the lower right side, saying: “Madam!”

“Call Liang Mingyu over for me, at once! Immediately!” Wang Pianran said sternly.

“Yes, Madam!” The maidservant was clearly very scared of this fatty, hurriedly scrambling away.

…

“Liang Mingyu, let me tell you, that brat who’s surnamed Ye must die! Otherwise, I’ll bring Rong-er back to the Wang Family tomorrow!” Wang Pianran said fiercely.

Liang Mingyu felt his head swell, fed up with this woman to the extreme.

Back then, he was left with no other choice that he married this fat and ugly woman.

Although he made it through the hurdle, it was also considered to have invited a wolf into the house. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This woman was just like a mad dog, aggressive and overbearing, taking herself to be the Liang Family’s matron, wanting to stick a hand into everything.

It was also precisely because of so that Liang Mingyu missed his former wife, Liang Wanru’s mother, even more.

Similarly, a woman, but why was the difference so great?

But even so, he could only swallow his grievances and said with difficulty, “This … This isn’t too nice, right? After all, Ye Yuan saved our two daughters. If he dies in the Liang Family for unknown reasons, who would still dare to do business with our Liang Family in the future?”

Wang Pianran’s expression turned cold, and she said, “Liang Mingyu, don’t give me that! As long as you make him die unbeknown to gods and ghosts, who would know that there was this matter? Just a cripple, would somebody be concerned that this world lost a cripple? Heh, saved our two daughters? Perhaps, that beast tide was summoned by him in the first place?”

Liang Mingyu’s eyes narrowed. He really had not thought of this possibility before.

When Wang Pianran saw this, she suddenly changed her tone and said, “Liang Mingyu, that punk’s beast taming abilities are extraordinary! As long as you can pry open his mouth …”

Wang Pianran had a sinister look, her face very proud of herself.

Even though she had a large head and big ears, she was not stupid.

In reality, Wang Pianran’s deviousness was much deeper than Liang Wanrong.

Otherwise, one what basis could she suppress the head of a family, Liang Mingyu?

When Liang Wanrong spoke of Ye Yuan’s beast taming ability, she had the idea already.

Ye Yuan, a cripple, was actually able to control a late-stage rank one Devilheaven Giant Elephant.

If this kind of method was obtained by the Liang Family, then the Liang Family would be able to become Jewelhill City’s number one great family in one leap!

There were quite a number of divine beasts inside the Myriad Beast Forest. Randomly catching a few over, this combat strength could not be overlooked too.

Liang Mingyu’s entire body trembled. The greedy look in his eyes could not be concealed anymore.

“Heh heh, wifey is truly my better half! Ever since marrying wifey, my, Liang Mingyu’s development these few years, has become smoother and smoother! Now, there are even hopes of becoming Jewelhill City’s number one family!” Liang Mingyu said with an excited look.

Ye Yuan’s life and death, he did not care. What he minded were just Liang Wanru’s thoughts.

But now, Wang Pianran’s words completely roused the ambition in his heart.

Beast taming arts capable of controlling a late-stage rank one divine beast, how could it not make people drool with envy?

Compared to Jewelhill City’s number one family, what did Ye Yuan’s little life count as?

Wang Pianran said proudly, “That is, of course! I know that you still miss that dead ghost these few years, but you also didn’t think it over properly. If there wasn’t me, Wang Pianran, how can you have the time to contrast past misery with present happiness?”
