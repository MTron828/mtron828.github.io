Chapter 1497 Forced Breakthrough?

On this day, the grandstand of the Blood Battle Stage’s main platform was fully occupied.

Those martial artists’ faces were all brimming with fanatical expressions. That was worship straight from the bottom of the heart.

The ‘King of Blood Battle’ returning to the Blood Battle Stage, just this one topic was sufficient to drive them crazy.

People who hung around at the Blood Battle Stage every day were all a bunch of fanatic lunatics.

The fiend race loved fighting, while they were belligerents among belligerents.

Therefore, they were filled with endless worship towards the ‘King of Blood Battle’.

Ka Xin was the legend here, the idol that they worshiped the most.

“Haha, I waited for 200 years. His Highness Ka Xin is finally going to take action once again! This time, it will probably be his swan song! I mustn’t miss it!”

“How much did you bet on His Highness Ka Xin winning?”

“Heh, I put down all of my assets! This kind of sure-win transaction, what’s there to hesitate about? What about you?”

“I wagered 30 fiend essence stones, this is 80% of my assets! Is the Blood Battle Stage stupid this time? This kind of battle, they actually still opened positions!”

“Who cares! Free money, why not take it!”

...

Everyone on the grandstands was incomparably excited. Not only could they watch the swan song battle of the King of Blood Battle, but they could also earn money. This kind of good thing, they had never encountered it before.

Regarding Ye Yuan issuing a letter of challenge, this matter, there were naturally people who had doubts.

But after they heard Ye Yuan’s realm, they no longer had doubts.

Middle-rank Fiend General challenging the King of Blood Battle?

What was this if not courting death?!

The grandstand’s second level’s VIP area was also fully occupied.

Some small family clans’ big shots could only stand at the back row.

A little smaller and they could only squeeze with the ordinary people outside.

The four great families’ family heads were imposingly present.

Ka Lan was the Ka Family’s present family head, in charge of managing the Ka Family’s affairs.

Although the Ka Family stayed in the City Lord Manor, they were distinct from the City Lord Manor.

After Ka Suo, the Ka Family had always been Capone Capital City’s ruler. No one was able to shake this position.

The Ka Family had a flourishing population with countless descendants. Ka Xin was the pinnacle-most existence among them.

“Fan Lin, your Fan Family finally managed to pick up a powerful Fiend Apothecary, but is a complete and utter fool! Did your Fan Family bring so many people come to collect his corpse on his behalf?” Ka Lan mocked.

Fan Lin was the Fan Family’s family head. Hearing that, he immediately retorted sarcastically: “Humph! The battle hasn’t started yet, who wins or loses is still not known!”

Ka Lan laughed loudly and said, “I know that this kid’s strength is pretty good, killing Starshine the three of them by himself. But Ka Xin’s strength, you all are well aware. No matter how impressive this kid is, he can’t flip the heavens too!”

Fan Lin defended himself with sophistry, “It’s not too late for you to come and brag after Ka Xin wins!”

Ka Lan laughed loudly and said, “Very well, very well, when Ka Xin pummels that brat into minced meat, I’ll come and brag again! Hahaha ...”

Fan Lin had a livid look, gave a cold snort, and did not talk anymore.

He really could not find a reason to believe that Ye Yuan could win this fight.

Originally found an extremely powerful Two-star fiend apothecary, Fan Lin was excited until he could not sleep for quite a few days.

But he had yet to enjoy a few days of bliss and it was going to be over.

“Li Ji, your relationship with Source Night is the best. You say, does he have hopes of winning or not?” Fan Lin asked Li Ji softly.

Li Ji’s expression was very ugly. She shook her head, but she did not know what she should say.

When Ye Yuan issued the letter of challenge, he definitely did not know how terrifying Ka Xin was.

The title of ‘King of Blood Battle’, that was slaughtered out by him match after match!

She completely did not think that Ye Yuan would go and issue a letter of challenge to Ka Xin. If she knew, she definitely would not have allowed this thing to happen.

Now, a shot arrow could not be recalled already.

At this time, the Blood Battle Stage’s referee walked to the center of the ring and said in a clear voice, “Today this battle, the two parties involved, one party is known as the ‘King of Blood Battle’, His Highness Ka Xin. While the other party is the Fan Family’s special-grade retainer, Source Night! Two months ago, Source Night issued a letter of challenge to His Highness Ka Xin. This battle will continue until life and death are determined!”

The moment the referee’s voice faded, momentous and tidal-like roars sounded out on the grandstands.

“Long live His Highness Ka Xin! Kill that fool who overestimates his own ability!”

“The Kind of Blood Battle is mighty! The Kind of Blood Battle is mighty!”

“Your Highness Ka Xin, I love you!”

...

Although Ka Xin had not taken action for 200 years, his popularity in the Blood Battle Stage was still exceedingly high.

Those who worshiped him were not just male martial artists. There were also large groups of female martial artists as well as noble ladies.

They did not stint with their worshiping feelings in the slightest, with three cheers for Ka Xin.

As for Ye Yuan, he was already a dead man in their eyes long ago.

Over 200 years ago, Ka Xin could only insta-kill those in the same-rank. His current strength was definitely even more unfathomable.

“Now, the ‘King of Blood Battle’, Your Highness Ka Xin, please take the field!” called out the referee in a clear voice.

The moment his voice faded, screams sounded out all-round.

The Ka Xin in white robes slowly walked out of the passageway, carrying overweeningly arrogant domineeringness.

This kind of feeling had not been seen for ages!

The deafening cheers did not make Ka Xin have a feeling of his hot blood boiling. On the contrary, he was frighteningly calm right now.

Upon standing in the ring, he seemingly returned to when he took the stage on the Blood Battle Stage again.

At present, his strength was no longer comparable with the past.

But upon standing here, his cold-blood state immediately returned to his body.

In this place, he would not underestimate any opponent.

Countless times of life-and-death struggles made him understand that underestimating one’s opponent any one time would become a lurking peril of death.

“Sir Source Night, please appear on the stage!”

In the passageway, the Ye Yuan in black robes slowly came out.

Ye Yuan’s appearance immediately caused a stir.

“Wasn’t it said that Source Night was a middle-rank Fiend General? How did he become a high-rank Fiend General?”

“It’s just a year’s time and he broke through?”

“No wonder he dared to challenge His Highness Ka Xin. Looks like he still has some skill!”

“Hehe, it’s just that breaking through is useless too! His Highness Ka Xin is already half-step Fiend Commander Realm. He can break through to become a Fiend Commander at any time! He’s still dead!”

...

The news that spread previously, Ye Yuan was just a middle-rank Fiend General. But when Ye Yuan appeared in front of everyone, his aura was already much stronger, already a high-rank Fiend General just like that! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Inside a secret private room, You Ming saw that Ye Yuan broke through his realm, but his brows furrowed.

“This kid actually forcefully broke through his realm! Looks like we all overestimated him!” You Ming said with a sigh.

The expression of the Bloodeagle by the side changed and he said, “It’s over! The positions opened this time are too big. Three years of profit is going to sink into the water!”

When Ka Xin saw Ye Yuan, he was surprised for a while first. Very soon, his face revealed a mocking look.

“I didn’t expect that you actually forcefully broke through your realm for this challenge. Huhu, do you think that by breaking through a minor realm, you can kill me?” Ka Xin said with an amused look as he smiled.

To genius martial artists, forcefully breaking through realms was a great taboo. It would cause one’s foundation to become unstable.

Ka Xin, Qin Tian, these geniuses, their cultivation speed were all very fast, but they had to suppress their realms and not let their realm increase too quickly. It was in order to retain potential to the greatest limit.

But Ye Yuan actually forcefully broke through his realm for this battle today. This would cause his foundation to be unstable.

Although his strength increased, it was a time-bomb.

Perhaps, it would explode at any time.
