1795 Trampled Flat in One Day

Dong!

An earth-shaking drum sound spread out, shocking until everyone’s eardrums hurt.

Everyone who was still laughing before, after hearing the drum sound, their faces all changed drastically.

As long as one was not a fool, they would be able to tell that this drum sound was the most sonorous one up to this point!

Everyone was dumbfounded, no one would have thought that Han Yong’s fart actually struck the Jadelight Drum so resoundingly.

“Ouch!”

Han Yong let out a scream and actually could not stand steady, falling down from midair.

But he did not feel pain. Scrambling to his feet, his face appeared flushed because of excitement.

He ran in front of Ye Yuan and said with an excited face, “It was actually really useful! You didn’t bluff me!”

Ye Yuan scolded laughingly when he heard this, and he said, “Turns out that you felt that I was bluffing you all along!”

Han Yong choked and said embarrassedly, “I didn’t mean that.”

“Huhu, suspicion is also normal. After all, this method is rather fantastical,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

By the side, Yang Fan was shocked until he did not speak until now. His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was full of incredulity.

This guy’s pointer was actually really useful!

Deacon Hong looked at this scene with a stunned look. This was still his first time seeing someone use this kind of utterly absurd method to pass the assessment. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Han Yong, tier five! Passed the test!”

These words were like a heavy hammer, smashing onto Zhao Zhao’s heart.

He gritted his teeth and said in a clear voice, “Deacon Hong, I ... I’m unconvinced! How can he be considered to have passed the assessment like this?”

Deacon Hong’s face fell and he said in a cold voice, “Are you questioning this old man?”

Zhao Zhao was startled inwardly, but he defended himself strongly through sophistry and said, “Deacon Hong, if letting out a fart can pass the test, then wouldn’t our Shadowmoon Sect become the laughingstock of the world?”

Deacon Hong frowned and said, “Passed means passed, the Jadelight Drum won’t deceive people! Keep on being long-winded and I’ll revoke your qualifications!”

Zhao Zhao’s face changed, how could he still dare to say anymore.

Han Yong said with a smug look, “Zhao Zhao, weren’t you very proud of yourself earlier? Didn’t you say that I can’t possibly surpass you? Heh heh, now, admit defeat!”

Zhao Zhao’s expression was grim as he gritted his teeth and said, “You beat the drum with such a ludicrous method, to actually still have the nerve to mention the wager?”

Han Yong seemed to have long predicted his attitude and said with a sneer, “Something that even Deacon Hong has confirmed isn’t up to you to deny! Whether or not I pass the test, that small flag can naturally ascertain it! Hence, are you going to go back on your words now?”

Zhao Zhao was pushed to the edge of the cliff all of a sudden.

Quite a few people around all cast strange gazes, all looking at Zhao Zhao with disdainful looks.

The two of them wagering, that was witnessed by many people.

Now, Zhao Zhao was actually going to go back on his word.

Zhao Zhao gritted his teeth and said furiously, “I’m reneging, so what can you do to me?”

But Han Yong smiled and said, “What can I do to you? Heh heh, everyone saw it, the people that come from the Devil Elephant Sect don’t keep their words. No strength and he still dared to bet with me, he loses and doesn’t acknowledge his debt! Such a sect is truly laughable!”

“This Zhao Zhao, I didn’t expect that he’s so shameless!”

“The Devil Elephant Sect’s face is utterly lost by him.”

“Heh, lost and doesn’t admit it, who would still dare to walk close with such a person in the future?”

...

Han Yong’s words immediately aroused a wave of contempt.

Zhao Zhao’s expression was ugly to the extreme. He currently found it hard to dismount the tiger after getting on its back. Whether or not he admitted it, the sect’s reputation was ruined by him.

Just as he was at a loss on what to do, a figure suddenly flashed past.

Slap!

A resounding slap landed on Zhao Zhao’s face.

Song Ting looked at Zhao Zhao with a grim expression and said furiously, “You fool, are you nuts? To actually dare agree to such a wager!”

Zhao Zhao was full of grievances in his heart. How could he know that Han Yong actually used a fart and surpassed him?

“I ...”

Zhao Zhao was just about to defend himself with sophistry, but heard Song Ting said icily, “You what you? From now on, you’re not my Devil Elephant lineage’s member anymore!”

Zhao Zhao’s expression changed and he said in a panic, “This ... How can this be?”

Once rejected by the Devil Elephant lineage, he would not be able to get protection within the Shadowmoon Sect in the future.

Inside this sect where geniuses were abundant like clouds, it was very hard for him to gain a foothold.

Song Ting sneered and said, “Otherwise, how do you want to resolve this matter?”

Zhao Zhao choked the moment he heard this. It seemed like this was the best way to resolve the problem.

Zhao Zhao’s expression was ashen. He suddenly discovered that his future became gloomy.

And the prime culprit was actually a wager!

The wager that was originally in the bag, in the end, he actually lost!

Han Yong watched the show by the side, enjoying it thoroughly.

For so many years, Zhao Zhao had always suppressed him, making him virtually unable to catch his breath.

Did not expect that he only used one opportunity and thoroughly brought this fellow down.

Without the Devil Elephant lineage as the patron, the Zhao three brothers would die very horribly.

Just like the words Jiang Xueyan said when she warned Ye Yuan, even Ye Yuan’s talent could not stand firm, let alone a measly little Zhao Zhao.

At this time, Han Yong was jubilant in his heart. His gaze when looking at Ye Yuan was also filled with gratitude.

Actually, the thing that Ye Yuan taught him was very simple, it was to let him continuously perform great circulatory cycles within his body with world power, finally sinking it inside the Dantian.

When it accumulated to the limits of the body, then let it out in one go.

Although Han Yong did not understand why, very clearly, he did it.

At the thought that he suspected Ye Yuan previously, he would feel very ashamed.

Ye Yuan was intentionally helping him get rid of Zhao Zhao here, but he doubted Ye Yuan’s intentions.

Yang Fan suddenly opened his mouth and said to Ye Yuan, “Ye Yuan, I apologize to you!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said with a smile, “You were worried about your bro, that’s why you did that. Would I fail to make a distinction between right and wrong? There’s no need for this apology.”

Yang Fan looked at Ye Yuan in surprise, secretly alarmed in his heart.

This kid’s heart was clear as a mirror!

“Ye Yuan, I discovered that when Zhao Zhao was talking to you previously, he seemed to be particularly scared of you?”

Yang Fan found it weird just now, when Zhao Zhao was facing Ye Yuan, he became like a different person from before, as if Ye Yuan was a dreadful monster.

This feeling made him feel very preposterous.

Even though Ye Yuan broke through, Zhao Zhao should not reach the extent of being afraid, right?

“That guy was taught a fierce lesson by me and Baili Qingyan in the Shadowmoon Mountain Range, that’s why he’s like this,” Ye Yuan said ambiguously.

Yang Fan felt enlightened in his heart. But Ye Yuan’s words made him feel even more puzzled.

Could it be that there was really some unclear and unknown relationship between Ye Yuan and Baili Qingyan?

The assessment continued, the people remaining were all strong players. Quite a number of tier three and tier four figures appeared.

It was just that there was not even a single tier five.

Only all the way until Duan Qinghong made a move did he firmly take tier five.

Zhong Hanlin and Duan Qinghong were almost on par, similarly the standard of tier five.

This way, Han Yong was actually ranked at third place thus far. This was what everyone never thought of.

“Next, Ye Yuan!”

It was Ye Yuan’s turn, but he did not move and said to Deacon Hong with clasped hands, “Deacon Hong, can this disciple request to be the last to be tested?”
