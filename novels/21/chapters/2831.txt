Chapter 2837: Your Arrogant Appearance Looks a Lot Like This Seat’s Style Back Then!

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Facing Zuo Chen’s anger, Ye Yuan did not blame him, but he felt warmth in his heart instead.

After the last battle, Zuo Chen had already sincerely regarded him as his personal disciple. Hence, that was why he would be so angry.

On the path of cultivation, changing masters was extremely common. It was not a big deal.

As long as it was not betraying one’s master and sect, they would not be criticized by people.

It was in man’s nature to strive for better. This was natural law!

Zuo Chen examined his own conscience. If it was him, he would have agreed without the slightest hesitation.

But Ye Yuan this fellow actually rejected him!

“Master Zuo, he really doesn’t have anything that he can teach me! Or should I say, do you have anything that you can teach me?” Ye Yuan asked with a smile.

Zuo Chen was just venting his anger. He naturally would not really hurt Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan looked miserable right now, but actually, it was all external wounds.

The moment Zuo Chen heard, he immediately exploded and said with a cold smile, “H-Huhu, what a cocky brat! You think that by developing a Blood of Flame Crystal, you’re invincible under the heavens? Don’t talk about Ancestor. As a grade eight heavenly alchemist, am I, your master, not enough to

teach you yet?”

Ye Yuan looked at Zuo Chen and said coolly, “I’ve already touched the threshold of profound grade!”

Zuo Chen was currently blowing his top. When he heard this, he could not help being stunned, immediately looking at Ye Yuan with a look like looking at a monster.

‘True grade was not the end of Alchemy Dao.

Above true grade was profound grade!

Reaching Emperor Realm, the medicinal effects of ordinary heavenly pills was negligible.

Even if it was true grade heavenly pills, the effects were greatly discounted on Emperor Realms too.

Profound grade was the exclusive heavenly pill for Emperor Realm powerhouses!

True grade heavenly pills fused the power of Great Dao in it and possessed unimaginable medicinal effects.

However, this was just a preliminary use of Heavenly Dao power.

‘Wanting to really attain a higher level, one must reach profound grade!

Profound grade could excavate even greater possibilities on the foundation of heavenly medicines’ medicinal effect.

If true grade could unleash 120% of heavenly medicines’ effect, then profound grade could unleash twice or even triple the medicinal effect! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The difference in between was not just an iota.

It was just that from true grade to profound grade, the span was huge!

Ye Yuan naturally did not understand these things before. But, after encountering Mi Tian, he naturally learned about it.

Below Emperor Realm, it was simply impossible to reach profound grade!

Because if one wanted to refine profound grade, they needed to have an extremely deep understanding of Alchemy Dao.

Not reaching grade seven heavenly alchemist realm, wanting to refine profound grade heavenly pills was simply a fool’s talk.

Of course, there were also extremely few heaven-defying geniuses who were able to refine profound ground before Emperor Realm, such as Zhou Pinespring.

This matter had once caused a great sensation!

But, even if it was Zhou Pinespring, he also reached this step when he was at peak True Sovereign Heaven.

At that time, he was already not far from Emperor Realm.

But what realm was Ye Yuan at now?

Middle Saint Sovereign!

This brat had not even broken through to upper Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Grade five heavenly alchemist refining profound grade heavenly pill?

It sounded like a fantasy tale no matter how one listened!

Seeing Zuo Chen’s dumbfounded appearance, Ye Yuan said coolly, “Going to the Extreme Medicine Sect is also for the sake of breaking through to profound grade. Otherwise, when you took me in as a disciple previously, I might really not have agreed to it.”

Face-slapping sounds could be heard in the air.

‘The two of them becoming master and disciple just happened to be due to the situation.

Although now, the two people’s friendship had grown, it could not change their original intentions.

Regarding Ye Yuan agreeing with Zuo Chen, it was indeed just for the sake of entering the Extreme Medicine Sect to enrich himself and break through the shackles.

‘True grade was hard; profound grade was naturally even harder.

Even if it was Ye Yuan, wanting to break through to this step was not easy either.

Bang!

Ye Yuan was smacked away by another slap. Zuo Chen said angrily, “Will you die if you don’t tell the truth? You treacherous disciple, angering Your Father to death! Your Father will beat you to death!”

Bang!

Zuo Chen was smacked flying with one slap. A figure suddenly appeared.

He shot Zuo Chen a glance and said coolly, “Impudent brat, to actually dare hit your grandmaster, you’re the treacherous disciple! You deserve to be hit! Your Father’s disciple can only be beaten by Your Father!”

The arrival was a sagely-looking old man, who could it be if not Hegemon Cloudmount?

Of course, this was a clone too.

Zuo Chen’s entire body trembled and he said in shock, “A-Are you Ancestor Cloudmount?”

Hegemon Cloudmount said coolly, “It’s naturally this seat. You’re Zuo Chen?”

Zuo Chen knelt down with a thud and said tremblingly, “D-Disciple pays respect to Ancestor Cloudmount!”

Hegemon Cloudmount was totally different from Zhou Pinespring.

He was the Extreme Medicine Sect’s legend, an undefeated myth!

Even if Zhou Pinespring advanced to Hegemon Realm, he was unable to be mentioned in the same breath with Hegemon Cloudmount too.

Hegemon Realm, their movements and traces had always been elusive and secretive. But Zhou Pinespring was the sect’s disciple in the first place, a rising star from the younger generation. Everyone was not unfamiliar with him. There was naturally lesser awe and fear.

But, with regards to Hegemon Cloudmount, that was different.

He was an old monster level powerhouse. One should not look at how Zuo Chen was an Emperor Vast Heaven Realm powerhouse. If he wanted to meet Cloudmount, that was impossible.

But today, Hegemon Cloudmount actually came in person for Ye Yuan!

Hegemon Cloudmount ignored him but looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Impudent brat, why haven’t you knelt when you see your master?”

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth twitched slightly. This old fellow was so shameless!

He had clearly rejected the offer already. This guy was still harping on and on about being his master!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I’ve already made it very clear to Hegemon Pinespring, I won’t acknowledge you as master.”

“Heh, what high-sounding sentiments! You said you’re not acknowledging and you’re done? Do you know how many people cry and wail, requesting for me to take them in as a disciple?”

Ye Yuan had a helpless look as he said, “These two days, I’ve already heard until my ears grew calluses! But what does that have to do with me? I admit that you’re very formidable, but in the future, I might not be unable to catch up to you. I might even surpass you!”

Hearing this, Zuo Chen’s hair stood on end.

I don’t know him!

I don’t know him!

He was whispering vigorously in his heart.

“Hahaha …”

But, the moment Cloudmount heard, he let out a loud laughter and said, “Indeed arrogant enough! Looking across the heavens and myriad realms, there really aren’t many who dare to speak to this seat like this! Kid, you’re different from Pinespring that reticent thing! You suit this seat’s taste very much!

Your arrogant appearance looks a lot like this seat’s style back then! Hahaha … I’l definitely be taking you in as a disciple!”

Ye Yuan was rendered speechless. He was really not interested in acknowledging a master.

Even back then in the Heavenspan World, Sacred Ancestor High Priest that kind of apex existence also addressed him as his brother.

And he also forged a path that connected to the heavens without any surprise.

Now, in the 33 Heavens, Ye Yuan was confident that he could also do this.

Especially after obtaining those records in the Labyrinth Divine Palace, Ye Yuan’s horizons were broadened, and he already had a hazy direction about his path of alchemy

Those few decades before leaving Rainclear Continent, Ye Yuan had accumulated for a long time and also obtained tremendous improvement in Alchemy Dao.

“Apologies. I really don’t have plans to change masters,” Ye Yuan still shook his head and said.

Cloudmount pointed at Zuo Chen and said coolly, “If you don’t agree, this seat will send him to the front-lines right away! You should know, fighting with the blood race is nine chances to die and one chance to live! Oh right, also, those friends around you! The front-lines are severely lacking people. Since

they are a part of Heaven One, they should serve the alliance, wouldn’t you agree?”

Hegemon Cloudmount revealed a cunning fox-like smile.

Ye Yuan’s face turned black. This old man was so shameless to actually use this kind of method to force him to concede..
