Chapter 2576: Beating a Dog, One Also Needed to Look at the Owner!

“I couldn’t tell that you guys have some savings! If you had been so obedient earlier, wouldn’t you not need to suffer physical hardship anymore?” Li Zhuo weighed the heavenly crystals in his hand with a smug expression.

Duan Tao and the rest had indignant looks as they said, “Li Zhuo, the heavenly crystals have already been given to you. Is it okay now?”

Li Zhuo smiled and said, “Brat, broke your leg yesterday, and you’re already skipping and jumping about today? Looks like there’s someone capable among you guys!?Oh,?right, you all went to Little Cloud Courtyard yesterday, right?”

Little Cloud Courtyard was Ye Yuan’s residence. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The expressions of Duan Tao and the rest changed, and they said, “Li Zhuo, I advise that you’d better not have designs on him! Otherwise, you’ll die very horribly!”

Li Zhuo laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “On Thousand Bird Peak, there is no one that I, Li Zhuo, can’t afford to provoke! Just the likes of you guys, these rookies who just ascended, you can also make me can’t afford to provoke? Even if his talent is pretty good, staying in Little Cloud Courtyard, he has to grovel for Your Father obediently too!”

By the side, a lapdog said smugly, “You all probably don’t know, Big Brother Zhuo is the inner disciple’s, Lord Lu Zhanyuan’s, personal servant! It’s fine if you guys have never heard of Lord Lu Zhanyuan before. You’ll hear his name in the future! You just have to know that Lord Lu Zhanyuan is an existence ranked in the top three among inner disciples too!”

The moment these words came out, the expressions of Duan Tao and the rest changed greatly.

They could not imagine that a puny little servant actually had such a powerful background.

Duan Tao they all knew that Yao Qing was an inner disciple.

But Yao Qing’s ranking among inner disciples was not high.

Ranked top three among inner disciples, that was absolutely a big shot!

Even if they entered the heavenly sect in the future, they had to give Li Zhuo some face too!

It was not bragging that he said there was no one he could not afford to provoke.

Another lackey said, “Lord Lu Zhanyuan treats our Big Brother Zhuo very well! Not only does he impart him with cultivation methods and teach him martial techniques, but he’s also even very protective of his own people!”

Li Zhuo had a smug look as he said, “So, you guys understand it? No matter how impressive you all were in the Lower Realms, you have to tuck your tails between your legs in this place and behave! Putting aside whether or not you all can enter the heavenly sect, even if you enter, you have to start as an outer sect disciple too! How great the disparity between an outer sect disciple and the inner sect’s top three,?huhu,?you all will understand in the future! Since you all came, then those chores from the sect will be done with you all then!”

The faces of Duan Tao and the rest became black as the bottom of a pot.

They finally understood what Yao Qing meant.

Enduring a year in this kind of environment was not an easy thing!

While talking, Li Zhuo already brought a group of people and headed to Little Cloud Courtyard.

The faces of Duan Tao and the rest changed, hurriedly following.

Bang!

A lackey kicked open Little Cloud Courtyard’s gates and yelled, “The punk inside, get out!”

While talking, a large group of people poured into Little Cloud Courtyard.

But right at this time, a figure flashed, blocking their way.

It was precisely Lin Lan!

When everyone saw Lin Lan, they could not help turning pale with fright!

No one expected that a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse was actually staying in this Little Cloud Courtyard!

A lackey said in horror, “You … You’re an aboriginal! An aboriginal actually appeared here!”

“You all dared to barge into Little Cloud Courtyard and disturb Master, courting death!” Lin Lan said in a solemn voice.

“M-Master?” Li Zhuo and the rest exchanged glances and could not help revealing looks of surprise.

To be able to make a Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse call master, what kind of existence did that have to be?

Could it be that an incredible big shot was staying in this Little Cloud Courtyard?

But why would such an important person stay in Little Cloud Courtyard?

“Lin Lan, those who barged into the courtyard, break their legs and throw them out!?Oh,?right, remember to loot the heavenly crystals on them.” At this time, a voice came from inside.

Lin Lan bowed and said, “Yes, Master!”

The moment Li Zhuo heard, he laughed loudly and said, “You dare to touch me? I’m Lord Lu Zhanyuan’s personal servant, if you dare touch a hair of mine, he definitely won’t let you off!”

Lin Lan rolled his eyes at him and gave a word, “Idiot!”

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Miserable screams rose and ebbed, those who barged into the courtyard all had their legs broken by Lin Lan and thrown out.

The miserable wails sounded continuously.

Lin Lan was not courteous either, directly ransacking the heavenly crystals on them cleanly.

Not only did he take back the one previously, he even robbed them clean.

When Duan Tao and the rest saw it, they were completely stunned.

Master Ye was really domineering!

“Ouch,?my legs! You aboriginal, and also the one inside, you guys are dead for sure! Beating a dog, you still need to look at the owner! Lord Lu Zhanyuan won’t let you all off! Ouch, quickly carry me away!”

“Pfft!”?When Duan Tao and the rest heard that, they all burst out laughing.

This Li Zhuo was the best too, to actually compare himself to a dog.

It seemed like he got used to being a dog!

Li Zhuo was carried away by people while saying fierce words.

Came in a threatening manner, but left with broken limbs.

Only after seeing Li Zhuo and the rest leave did Duan Tao and the rest swarm in.

“Master Ye, this matter is blown up! That Lu Zhanyuan is among the inner sect’s top three!” Duan Tao said.

“Master Ye, it’s all our fault, causing such a huge problem for you! You rest assured. If that Lu Zhanyuan dares to come, he can step over my corpse!” Ma Liang patted his chest and said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Alright, isn’t it just the inner sect’s number three? Look how it got you all worried! All go back. I have to cultivate.”

Everyone exchanged glances, their faces speechless.

Master Ye was also too reckless, right?

That was the inner sect’s number three!

“All go back! Isn’t it just the inner sect’s number three? You guys are also looking down on Master’s means too much! Forget about number three, even if the inner sect’s number one came, he won’t think anything of it too!” Lin Lan said nonchalantly.

Duan Tao and the rest were speechless. This master and disciple two people were indeed cut from the same cloth!

Being the inner sect’s number three, Lu Zhanyuan’s strength was at least an upper Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse too!

He might even be a grand completion Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse!

Even Lin Lan this Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse was not enough to fill the crevices between his teeth too.

This master and disciple two people actually did not take him seriously in the slightest!

… …

“My lord, you have to stand up for this lowly one!” Li Zhuo came to Lu Zhanyuan here and wept bitterly.

Seeing Li Zhuo’s injuries, Lu Zhanyuan also frowned slightly.

Li Zhuo’s legs were broken. Even if treatment was done, he could probably forget about recovering without spending half a year.

The blow was dealt rather viciously.

Li Zhuo this servant normally served him very well; he was still very satisfied with Li Zhuo’s service.

Beating a dog, one also needed to look at the owner; there was this logic.

It hit Li Zhuo’s body, but what it hit was him, this number three’s face!

“Didn’t you say my, Lu Zhanyuan’s, name?” Lu Zhanyuan said with a frown.

“Said it! It was fine when I didn’t say it. But when I said it, they were even invigorated! They even said that if Your Excellency went, they would still beat anyway!” Li Zhuo embellished the details.

Sure enough, the moment Lu Zhanyuan heard, his brows furrowed even harder.

“Huhu,?he hasn’t even entered the heavenly sect yet, and he’s domineering until like this! I want to see which god is staying in that Little Cloud Courtyard!” Lu Zhanyuan’s gaze turned chilly as he said in a cold voice.
