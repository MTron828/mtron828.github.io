Chapter 206: Deep Bow!

Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessor

"Why do I have to escape?" Nanfeng Yi asked calmly.

"Of course, it’s because I’m stronger than you! Haha, already at this time, are you still unwilling to let go of your emperor’s majesty?" the old man asked with a smile.

"Didn’t think that the three of you brothers have already been planning today’s revolt over a decade ago. Su Yusen, you guys really plotted very well!"

This old man was shockingly Su Yulin’s big brother, Su Yusen, a Third Level Crystal Formation Realm powerhouse!

"Haha, Your Majesty flatters me. If I didn’t fake my death, how can Your Majesty let the Su Family develop in peace?" Su Yusen had a look like everything was within his control.

Nanfeng Yi nodded and said, "Speaking of it, ever since Su Yuting married into the Ouyang Family, it virtually ordained this situation today already. However, even if you all calculated everything, you probably couldn’t have calculated today’s variable, right?"

Nanfeng Yi still had a calm and composed appearance, but his words were filled with derision.

But Su Yusen did not mind. He smiled and said, "Isn’t Your Majesty too immature to want to use such words to scare this elderly self? Enough. Although I have lots of things I want to catch up with Your Majesty, I’m still quite uneasy about the situation over at the Pill Grading Assembly. Is Your Majesty going to end yourself, or are you going to make old me do it personally?"

Nanfeng Yi chuckled, laughing very happily.

"What are you laughing about?" Not knowing why, Su Yusen suddenly had a bad premonition.

"I’m laughing because we’ve lived to ripe old age and schemed for half our lives, but in the end, we’re both not the main casts in this battle for imperial authority. However, what I’m more fortunate than you guys in . . . is that I got acquainted with Ye Hang," Nanfeng Yi said with a grin.

"Ye Hang? You’re talking about that chess piece you’ve been using to suppress the Su Family, the owner of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion? You mean to say that he’s the protagonist for this fight for imperial authority? What a joke!" Su Yusen wondered if Nanfeng Yi went insane.

"You’re wrong! Ye Hang has never been my chess piece. It’s just that I happened to save both him and his wife back then. He only remained in the State of Qin’s capital to repay that favor. I just never expected that my unintentional action back then would actually become the linchpin to saving the Nanfeng Family today!" Talking about past events, Nanfeng Yi also sighed.

15 years ago, Nanfeng Yi was merely still the State of Qin’s crown prince back then and had not broken through to the Crystal Formation Realm either.

He traveled the world to broaden his horizons, and as chance would have it, he encountered the Ye husband and wife who were being hunted down in the neighboring State of Yan. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At that time, Ren Hongling was in labor. Ye Hang who needed to protect his beloved wife and also needed to fight the enemies had already fallen into a hopeless situation.

Nanfeng Yi came forward bravely at that time together with his accompanying guards and saved the Ye husband and wife. Because of this, that half-step Crystal Formation Realm guard of Nanfeng Yi’s even died in the State of Yan.

Afterward, Ye Hang followed Nanfeng Yi to the State of Qin and settled down in the capital.

Then, later on, the Su Family pushed Wan Donghai onto the stage. At this time, Ye Hang already broke through to the Crystal Formation Realm and became an Alchemy Grandmaster.

Ye Hang resolutely stood up in order to repay that debt of gratitude and kept Wan Donghai in check.

All of this was Ye Hang’s own accord. Or else, with his personality, how could he willingly slog for the Nanfeng Family for so many years?

Except, Nanfeng Yi would never have thought that his unintentional actions back then not only exchanged for Ye Hang’s many years of spring-like repayment, it even obtained a feeble thread of hope for the Nanfeng Family today!

"Ye Hang is merely just an Alchemy Grandmaster. Even if he has three heads and six arms, he also can’t save the Nanfeng Family’s decline! Furthermore, as long as you die, why does it matter even if the Nanfeng Family took the upper hand over at the Pill Grading Assembly? Could it be that Ye Hang can still rush over to save you now?" Su Yusen felt rather bewildered by Nanfeng Yi.

"Hur hur, you’re mistaken. The protagonist I said is not Ye Hang, but his son, Ye Yuan! If not for him, I’d most likely not be able to escape death today!"

"Ye Yuan?" Su Yusen stared at Nanfeng Yi. He was confident that Nanfeng Yi was already scared out of his wits. "Heh heh, a brat still wet behind his ears, and you actually treat him as your savior. Nobody can save you today!"

Finishing, Su Yusen’s Third Level Crystal Formation Realm aura was released completely as he shot towards Nanfeng Yi.

"Prepare to die, Nanfeng Yi."

Right then, a white figure charged out from the forest and clashed directly with Su Yusen!

Rumble!

Su Yusen fell back over a dozen steps before managing to barely stabilize himself. Looking carefully, he saw a white colored ape blocking in front of Nanfeng Yi. Su Yusen’s face changed drastically.

"Peak early-stage Tier 3 Long-arm Stone Ape! How is this possible?" Su Yusen’s eyes were full of disbelief.

Just as Su Yusen was having doubts, several more dozen white silhouettes popped out. 49 Tier 2 Long-arm Stone Apes encircled him!

Su Yusen lost in his astonishment had yet to know that he had already completely fallen into the Seven Star Ephemeris Grand Array!

"Hur hur, when I saw Yuan Fei, my reaction was exactly the same as yours. Now, you should understand why Ye Yuan is the protagonist, right? Yuan Fei is Ye Yuan’s servant!" Looking at Yuan Fei, Nanfeng Yi was still secretly quite terrified.

"How can a Tier 3 demonic beast possibly acknowledge a human as its master? This is absolutely impossible!" Su Yusen said in shock.

"This is how the truth is! Moreover, Ye Yuan possesses an entire clan of Long-arm Stone Apes! He essentially doesn’t need my Nanfeng Family to make a move to eradicate the Su Family!"

". . . . . ." Su Yusen fell silent. He never thought that having concealed himself for over a decade, what he traded for would be this outcome today!

"Humph! So what?! It’s just a Tier 3 demonic beast. I’m also Third Level Crystal Formation Realm. I might not lose to him!"

After the silence, intense unwillingness made Su Yusen explode. He rushed towards Yuan Fei without caring about anything.

His reply was Yuan Fei’s heaven-quaking blow!

. . . . . .

The capital. There was suddenly a commotion in the Drunken Star Manor.

"Quickly look! Someone’s coming!"

"En? Is-isn’t that His Majesty? He actually appeared here. Doesn’t that mean . . ."

"Shhh! Softer! Do you want to die? I initially thought that the Su Family had victory in their grasp. Didn’t think that there would be a turnaround and the Nanfeng Family would actually gain a complete victory! Looks like time is not yet up for the Nanfeng Family! The Su Family plotted for over a decade, and it was actually such an outcome that was exchanged. Su Yulin is probably going to go insane, right?"

Under everyone gaze, Nanfeng Yi slowly walked into the Drunken Star Manor.

Seeing Nanfeng Yi, Su Yulin’s facial expression was as ugly as it could get.

"Imperial Brother! It’s great that you’re fine!" Nanfeng Ruoqing could not help tearing from joy when she saw Nanfeng Yi.

"Haha, thanks to Little Brother’s blessings, I escaped death from this great calamity," Nanfeng Yi said smilingly.

Finishing, Nanfeng Yi came in front of Ye Yuan, cupped his hands, and gave a deep bow in front of everyone’s astounded eyes.

"Thank you very much for Little Brother saving my Nanfeng Family! Please accept this bow from Nanfeng Yi!"

Nanfeng Yi’s actions nearly made everyone’s eyes pop out!

What kind of person was Nanfeng Yi? He was the emperor of the great State of Qin, a supreme existence!

He actually performed such a solemn salute to a youth!

Su Yulin clearly said just now that not only did his big brother not die, he even broke through to the Third Level Crystal Formation Realm successfully!

Just what on earth did Ye Yuan do to actually bring Nanfeng Yi back without losing a hair?
