Chapter 2712: Becoming Sworn Brothers!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mi Tian said before, true dragons were born from chaos. They were birthed by heaven!

And Ye Yuan cultivated the chaos origin divinity.

Hence, when he urged the Nine Heavens Dragon Transformation Fist with chaos divine essence, it was indeed effective!

“Maybe in your view, breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven is a very impressive thing. But to me, it’s no big deal,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon frowned slightly and said in an unfriendly tone, “It’s a good thing for youngsters to be talented. But, if you are overly conceited, you won’t live for long!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Do you know why I’d appear on the Myriad Demons Mountain?”

Without waiting for Saint Exalt Bull Demon to guess, Ye Yuan answered himself, “Because I promised Bright Tiger King and the other four kings to help them to break through Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon laughed loudly when he heard that and said, “Little baby, do you know what Saint Sovereign Heaven is? On the massive Myriad Demons Mountain, with countless true spirits, there are even several dozen half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens. But there are only a scanty three Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses! But when it reached your mouth, it became cabbages! Do you know that you’re very ignorant?”

Ye Yuan just smiled and did not speak.

But Shuoyan said, “Master, I believe what Big Brother Ye Yuan said, he can definitely do it! In reality, including my royal father, the five of them kings believe Big Brother without a shadow of doubt too!”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon scoffed and said, “Just a human conman! The five of them are completely blind! How amazing and brilliant this exalt was back then, carving a bloody path out of countless powerhouses. I also spent countless years of training before I could take that step! A mere Limitless Sublime Heaven also dares to arbitrarily talk about Saint Sovereign Heaven, simply a joke!”

Only when one reached Saint Sovereign Heaven, this threshold, and went to break through personally, would they know how difficult this step was!

Saint Exalt Bull Demon was someone who had experienced it. So he had even less faith that a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum could help half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens take this step.

But Shuoyan said firmly, “Big Brother Ye Yuan is different from the rest! Master took fancy on this disciple, it should be because of the bloodline that this disciple just awakened, right? But do you know why I was able to awaken the bloodline? It was Big Brother Ye Yuan’s true grade heavenly pill that let me awaken my bloodline!”

“Impossible! Bloodline power can only be awakened by relying on talent! How can there be the logic of awakening by relying on heavenly pills?” Saint Exalt Bull Demon immediately denied it.

Shuoyan saw that Saint Exalt Bull Demon did not believe it and recounted the process of his awakening in detail and swore a deadly oath.

When Saint Exalt Bull Demon saw Shuoyan saw the deadly oath and was perfectly fine, the shock in his heart could not be any greater!

There was an adage among true spirits called ‘bloodline is innate’.

Which was to say that bloodline power was bestowed by heaven. It would only continuously awaken and become stronger by relying on your continuous hard work.

What kind of heavenly pill could let Shuoyan awaken such a powerful bloodline power?

It was hard to understand!

But now, it was not up to him to not believe it.

After a long silence, Saint Exalt Bull Demon asked this, “You’re saying that he can refine grade four heavenly imperial pills?”

Ye Yuan smiled slightly, he believed it.

Since he believed, this old bull naturally would not do anything to him.

The most fearful thing was that you had no value to exploit.

Very clearly, as a heavenly alchemist, the value was too great!

Being able to refine grade four heavenly imperial pills, what did that mean?

That meant that the heavenly pills that Ye Yuan refined were similarly useful to him, this Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Not being able to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven was naturally extremely painful.

But breaking through to Saint Sovereign Heaven also did not mean that one could sit back and relax.

Reaching this step, there was already no one who could refine heavenly pills for them.

Even on Myriad Demons Mountain, the heavenly pills that were useful to them were also similarly exceedingly few!

Therefore, every inch that they wanted to advance, required countless years to polish.

It was naturally something that was doubly difficult if they wanted to make further breakthroughs on this foundation.

At this time, a heavenly alchemist that could refine true grade heavenly imperial pills appeared. The significance was different!

Shuoyan nodded his head heavily and said, “Not just grade four heavenly imperial pills! Furthermore, it’s true grade heavenly imperial pills! True grade heavenly pills are too miraculous. I only took one heavenly pill and directly broke through a major cultivation realm! Furthermore, it even helped me to awaken my bloodline!”

A figure walked out of the darkness.

Ye Yuan two people finally saw Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s true face clearly.

A brawny man with a bull’s nose and two horns.

Saint Exalt Bull Demon looked at Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Do you have true grade heavenly pills in your hands?”

Ye Yuan smiled and fished out a crystal clear heavenly pill.

When Saint Exalt Bull Demon saw this heavenly pill, his pupils could not help constricting!

“Fine pill!” Saint Exalt Bull Demon could not resist exclaiming.

His realm was different from others. Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, those were all transcendent existences that entered sainthood. Their understanding of Heavenly Dao was not what normal people could compare to.

The moment he saw this heavenly pill, he felt an aura of Great Dao. It was definitely not ordinary!

This was a grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill. Ye Yuan spent a year’s time and finally cultivated the grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill to the realm of true grade.

The more he sized it up, the more Saint Exalt Bull Demon felt that this pill was extraordinary! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“There’s actually such a miraculous heavenly pill in this world! This exalt was ignorant and ill-informed!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’ll give this heavenly pill to Lord Saint Exalt. If Your Excellency is interested, why not try it out.”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s pupils constricted and he said, “Really?”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “You’re Lord Saint Exalt. Even if you take my heavenly pill by force, I also won’t dare to do anything.”

Saint Exalt Bull Demon shook his head and said, “That won’t do! Of course that won’t do! You punk, who do you think this exalt is?”

Ye Yuan just smiled but did not speak.

It was not that Saint Exalt Bull Demon did not want to, and it was also not that he was not moved, but that he was clear in his heart that he could not lose the main goal because of small gains!

This was merely a grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill. It would not have much effect on him.

But, if it was a grade four heavenly imperial pill, then the effect would be totally different!

Offending Ye Yuan now, when Ye Yuan could refine grade four heavenly pills in the future, he would not be so easy to talk to anymore.

Getting Ye Yuan’s permission, Saint Exalt Bull Demon brook no delay and swallowed the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

Suddenly, his expression changed.

He only felt that every pore on his body seemed to have opened up.

A measly grade three heavenly pill was actually really effective on him!

Although this effect was negligible, he clearly felt that his bloodline power really increased a little!

One had to know, even if the rank of ordinary grade three heavenly pills reached upper ninth grade, it was also impossible to have the slightest effect on him.

But this grade three heavenly pill had an effect!

This was just a grade three heavenly pill. If it was a grade four heavenly pill?

What if it was a grade five heavenly pill?

Thinking up to here, Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s breathing could not help speeding up.

That feeling was seemingly like being trapped in a cage for tens of thousands of years, and seeing the light of day!

After so many years, the things that could move him were really in the minority.

But today, he lost composure!

“What a miraculous heavenly pill! I didn’t expect that a measly grade three Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is actually effective on this exalt! Ye Yuan, I admit that previously, it was this exalt who made an error of judgment! From today onward, you and I will address each other as brothers, alright?” Saint Exalt Bull Demon suddenly said something that made even Ye Yuan a little stunned.
