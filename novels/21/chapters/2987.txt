Chapter 2986: Rectification of Name!

Half a month later, at the East Sea’s shore.

When Ye Yuan hurried over, the others had already arrived.

When Scarletplume saw Ye Yuan, he said rather warmly, “Brother Ye, you’re finally here!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Congratulations, Brother Scarletplume. You are ranked third on the Mountain Challenger List.”

Scarletplume smiled and said, “That’s all in the past! Once we enter Heavenly Dragon Island, everything will have to start over from the top.”

Clearly, Scarletplume had a great mentality.

It was also precisely this kind of powerful mentality that let him rise rapidly.

Ye Yuan swept with his peripherals and discovered that the surrounding environment was somewhat disorderly.

Furthermore, Scarletplume’s aura was somewhat chaotic. His body had some injuries too. He immediately understood something.

Scarletplume noticed Ye Yuan’s gaze and said with a smile, “Wu Fa refused to accept that I’m ranked third, so he challenged me.”

Not far away, a young man’s face had a somewhat awkward expression.

No need to say anything; Scarletplume won.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Impressive, Brother Scarletplume!”

Scarletplume smiled bitterly and said, “But I challenged Long Yi and lost! This guy is too strong, be careful.”

Ye Yuan was taken aback, immediately understanding something.

At this time, Long Yi was currently looking at him with a provoking gaze. His goal was self-explanatory.

“Ye Yuan! If you’re a man, accept my challenge! You got conferred without fighting. I, Long Yi, refuse to accept it as final!” Long Yi said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “Is this number one that important?”

Long Yi said, “Of course, it’s important! No matter where I, Long Yi, am, I’ll only be number one!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said coolly, “Sorry, I’m not interested.”

These guys, each and every one still did not know what was going to happen. They were actually still in the mood to seek to prevail over others here.

So what if you got first place?

Did you really think that you all could enter Heavenly Dragon Island?

It was just that Ye Yuan did not say these words out.

However, apart from Scarletplume, the others clearly did not have the intention of letting him go.

“Ye Yuan, it turns out that you’re merely someone who bullies the weak and fears the strong! Coward!”

“You challenged us, but now that you ran into the strongest Long Yi, you’re scared? If I were you, I wouldn’t have the face to enter Heavenly Dragon Island at all!”

“Don’t even have the courage to rectify your name. What qualifications do you have to enter Heavenly Dragon Island?”

“Heavenly Dragon Island only accepts the strong. A good-for-nothing like you isn’t fit to enter at all!”

… …

These people were all Ye Yuan’s defeated foes.

They were brimming with vigor and vitality and did not have Scarletplume’s mentality.

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not answer the challenge, they instinctively thought that Ye Yuan was scared.

Furthermore, Long Yi’s might was indeed entrenched in people’s hearts.

Being able to defeat the current Scarletplume, there was already no need for explanations.

The current Scarletplume, his strength was significantly greater than when he fought with Ye Yuan back then!

“Humph!?Whether to compete or not isn’t up to you!” Long Yi snorted coldly, and the aura of his body suddenly erupted, pouncing over toward Ye Yuan.

This place was no longer whatever mountain challenging.

A word of disagreement and weapons were drawn.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

In an instant, the two people clashed together, being locked in a struggle.

On the surface of the sea, huge waves were set off from the fighting, space shattering.

These two people’s strengths were both formidable to the extreme.

Among Emperor Cloud Heavens, no one was stronger than the two of them.

“So strong! It turns out that this guy is so strong!”

“How is that possible? He actually fought to a draw with Long Yi!”

“Turns out that when he was fighting with us, he didn’t use his full strength at all!”

… …

Seeing this scene, everyone was extremely shocked.

Ye Yuan’s strength greatly exceeded their imagination.

In reality, in the mountain challenging battles, Ye Yuan only fought very arduously when fighting with Scarletplume.

In that battle, he himself also benefited a great deal.

The opponents ever since then, could not make him muster up interest at all.

It resulted in these people having a misconception that Ye Yuan was not very strong and was not worthy of being number one at all.

But now, the strength that Ye Yuan displayed made them feel ashamed of their unworthiness.

It was completely not on the same level.

In the crowd, Scarletplume was also very shocked and muttered, “Not seeing for two years, Ye Yuan is already powerful to this extent? I thought that my improvement was fast enough. I didn’t expect that he actually already shook me off far behind!”

Without comparison, there would not be any harm.

What Scarletplume took pride in was his comprehension ability.

Comprehending in battles, becoming stronger in fights!

His fight with Ye Yuan might have been by chance.

But, two years later, Ye Yuan’s improvement far exceeded his imagination.

He finally understood that there was not the slightest fluke in Ye Yuan’s winning him!

“Ye Yuan has already comprehended the second form of his ultimate spatial technique! It just depends on whether or not Long Yi can force him to this step. But, looking at it now, it seems like he can’t!” By the side, Feng Qingxuan said faintly.

Scarletplume’s entire body trembled, full of disbelief.

Back then, he lost to the first form, Wave Washing Sand.

It had just been two years, and Ye Yuan had already comprehended the second form?

Ye Yuan displaying Spatial Eight Styles opened another door for Scarletplume.

Two years had passed, and he was still digesting the application of Spatial Eight Styles.

Spatial Eight Styles was too vast and complicated.

But, Ye Yuan actually already walked even further on his own path?

This … was really a merciless crushing!

“Spatial first form, Wave Washing Sand!” Above the void, Ye Yuan bellowed.

Long Yi was slammed into the sea like a cannonball.

This battle ended!

The remaining eight people were all rendered speechless.

At this point, Ye Yuan, this number one, could be considered to be duly deserved.

“Coward? Good-for-nothing? No qualification to enter Heavenly Dragon Island??Huhu,?if even Ye Yuan doesn’t have the qualifications, then what do you all count as? A bunch of trash, you’re not Ye Yuan’s match, and you still hope for others to defeat him? Is this the dragon race’s geniuses? What a joke!” Feng Qingxuan ridiculed without holding back in the slightest.

The group of geniuses wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

Being looked down upon by people was not scary, but being despised by a woman was frightening.

Of course, being despised by a beautiful woman was even scarier.

At this time, a streak of light approached from afar, resolving everyone’s awkwardness.

The flying boat came.

Someone came down from the flying boat. It was precisely the old man who gave the token.

“All come on up. Remember to show your token; otherwise, you’ll be obliterated!” The old man said lightly.

The party boarded the flying boat, seemingly already forgotten about the conflict previously, appearing somewhat excited.

Heavenly Dragon Island was the place that all of East Billow Region’s dragon race descendants yearned for.

They challenged mountains everywhere in order to enter Heavenly Dragon Island.

How many lifeforms did the East Billow Region have? But there were only merely ten of them who were able to enter Heavenly Dragon Island!

This was glory!

“Senior, after entering Heavenly Dragon Island, do we need to take note of anything?” Someone asked flusteredly.

The old man said coolly, “After getting on the island, there will naturally be someone who’ll inform you guys!”

“Senior …”

Everyone was trying to get a word in, attempting to inquire about the situation on the island.

After all, it was a new place. They knew absolutely nothing.

However, the old man had a nonchalant appearance, answering very perfunctorily.

Ye Yuan was very calm. It was as if he was an outsider and had nothing to do with this. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Several days later, a large island appeared before everyone’s eyes.

“Senior, I heard that Heavenly Dragon Island has chaos heavenly dragons taking in and spitting out heaven and earth spiritual energy. There’s immortal mist lingering on the island all year round. Is this place Heavenly Dragon Island?” Ye Yuan suddenly asked.
