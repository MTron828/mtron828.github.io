Chapter 2769: Practice!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What did you say? Lin Zhongwei activated the Vajra Dharma Body and was actually still injured by his origin divinity attack?”

At the Pill Alliance, Li Changsheng suddenly stood up after hearing Zhao Ding’s report.

His eyes were full of shock.

No one understood the prowess of the Vajra Dharma Body, this origin divinity defense mystic art, better than him.

Even across the entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, this mystic art was sufficient to rank in the top ten too!

But Ye Yuan’s origin divinity offensive mystic art was actually a level stronger!

What did this indicate?

This showed that the level of Ye Yuan’s origin divinity offensive mystic art was higher than the Vajra Dharma Body!

In such a remote Rainclear Continent, where did such a formidable origin divinity mystic art come from?

Originally, Li Changsheng did not care about Ye Yuan at all.

But now, it was not up to him to not take him seriously anymore.

Ye Yuan’s origin divinity attack was so formidable; it meant that he could disregard the disparity in realm and kill Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses!

The factions that he took great pains to nurture could crumble at any time!

“Not only that!”

Zhao Ding said in a solemn voice, “He also has a grade two grandmist treasure in his hands, smashing the Grand Chaos Heavenly Gate Formation with three hits! His fleshy body already reached half-step Saint Sovereign Heaven too. It’s just that his divine essence realm doesn’t seem to be stable enough yet. I feel that … he might be using us as practice!”

A Jade Sovereign Heaven using Saint Sovereign Heavens to practice?

Li Changsheng felt a little headache!

He thought that this boy was already dead back then. Who knew that not only did he not die, he became even more troublesome after returning?

If he was just an ordinary alchemy path genius, then forget it.

But Ye Yuan was not only heaven-defying in Alchemy Dao. His Martial Dao was also unbelievably monstrous.

This kind of opponent, anyone would feel a big headache.

After a long time, Li Changsheng snorted coldly and said, “Using Saint Exalt Heavens to practice??Humph!?Does he really think that this exalt is made of paper paste?”

… …

Half a month later at the Pill Alliance’s Bright Sun Branch.

Deep in the night.

Ye Yuan disposed of the mountain-guarding disciples silently, passed through the Grand Chaos Heavenly Gate Formation, and entered the mountain pass gates. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Bright Sun Branch’s alliance chief was called Guo Huai, a middle-stage lower Saint Sovereign Heaven.

His strength could not be underestimated!

Through the previous fight, Ye Yuan discovered that in the same rank, the Pill Alliance’s Saint Sovereign Heavens were much stronger than Saint Exalt Waycloud them all!

This made Ye Yuan become curious about the Pill Alliance’s origins.

Mi Tian said that the origin divinity mystic art that Lin Zhongwei cultivated was called Vajra Dharma Body!

This level of origin divinity mystic art, only the 33 Heavens’ top sect would have it.

Although this defense mystic art was not as good as Divine Emergence, Ye Yuan’s cultivation realm was too low. He really could not breach the other party’s origin divinity defenses.

It was also that Lin Zhongwei was too weak. If it was Zhao Ding, the effect of the origin divinity attack would be negligible!

This made Ye Yuan greatly surprised.

The Rainclear Continent was isolated from the world. Even the alchemy development was lagging extremely behind; how could such a high level origin divinity mystic art appear?

Connecting it to the Pill Alliance’s true grade heavenly pills again, Ye Yuan guessed that this Pill Alliance’s alliance chief, Li Changsheng, probably came from a top sect outside of the Rainclear Continent!

If that was the case, then the faction behind the Pill Alliance was extremely terrifying.

Of course, no matter how terrifying, it could not change Ye Yuan’s determination to seek vengeance too.

The Pill Alliance must be destroyed!

Ye Yuan displayed spatial rule all the way, fumbling towards the main hall.

The transmission array was set up there.

In the Martial Secure Branch, Ye Yuan’s goal was not to kill people but to figure out the location of the transmission array.

Since the various major branches were built uniformly, the rough construction was naturally about the same.

Especially transmission array this kind of important thing, it was definitely placed in the safest place.

Where was the safest?

It was naturally the main hall!

This place had powerhouses plentiful like clouds. The alliance chief was here too.

It was simply impossible for ordinary people to want to grope their way to the transmission array.

But, by displaying spatial rule and borrowing the cover of the night, Ye Yuan fumbled his way in easily.

Carefully passing through one restriction after another, Ye Yuan finally found where the transmission array was at.

There were four Jade Sovereign Heavens waiting in full battle-array ahead, standing guard over the transmission array.

Ye Yuan laughed lightly, and his origin divinity suddenly erupted.

True Soul Explosion!

Four Jade Sovereign Heavens virtually died at the same time.

However, this eruption immediately triggered the restriction too.

“Who is it?! To dare trespass my Bright Sun Branch!” Guo Huai roared, reaching in a blink of an eye.

However, it was already too late!

Boom!

The Myriad Realms Mountain smashed straight towards the transmission array. The spatial passageway collapsed in an instant!

Guo Huai rushed over, only to see a wrecked transmission array, and could not help turning greatly pale with fright.

“You’re Ye Yuan!” Guo Huai looked at Ye Yuan with a look of fright.

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “Relax, I won’t use origin divinity attacks to kill you! Come, practice with me!”

Guo Huai’s expression turned cold, and he said with a sneer, “You want to borrow my hands to consolidate your realm??Huhu,?do you really think that Saint Sovereign Heavens are roadside cabbages?”

Heaven Breaking Divine Saber!

His voice had yet to fade when Guo Huai suddenly launched a sneak attack, cleaving over with a saber!

This saber was swift to the extreme!

Furthermore, the saber in his hand was even a grandmist treasure!

In an instant, Ye Yuan felt that all of his paths of retreat had been sealed off!

At this moment, Ye Yuan felt a powerful pressure!

This Guo Huai’s saber intent already reached the realm of Great Dao Transformation!

Sure enough, the Pill Alliance’s Saint Sovereign Heavens all had extraordinary strength!

However, this was also precisely what he requested.

Right away, the Dragon Spring Sword emerged with a howl and directly greeted without retreating in the slightest.

Jade Sovereign Heaven versus Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Boom!

The terrifying undulation directly blew the entire main hall up.

The berserk heaven and earth spiritual energy startled the entire Bright Sun Branch awake!

“Enemy attack!”

“Alliance Chief is fighting with the enemy!”

“Mn??Why is the opponent a Jade Sovereign Heaven? He … He’s Ye Yuan!”

“So strong! This guy is just Jade Sovereign Heaven, and he’s actually fighting with Alliance Chief until neither can get the upper hand!”

… …

For a moment, Bright Sun Branch was shaken from top to bottom.

They had never seen it before; a Jade Sovereign Heaven could actually fight fiercely with a Saint Sovereign Heaven!

But today, they witnessed it!

The Dragon Spring Sword turned into 108 flying swords at this moment, forming into an incomparably sharp sword formation.

And Guo Huai did not show weakness in the slightest, his unrestrained blade dancing until it was airtight.

The two people went back and forth and actually directly blew the main peak up!

Places that they passed through, the Pill Alliance’s disciples were directly ground up by the force.

They were unable to intervene in this level of battle at all.

Guo Huai’s strength was extremely robust.

It looked like they were meeting as equals, but in reality, he was suppressing Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s sword intent was suppressed by Guo Huai’s crazed saber intent until he could not catch his breath.

It was also that Guo Huai was certain that he would die that caused him to erupt with an even greater combat power.

He knew that once Ye Yuan used origin divinity attacks, he would only have one road: death.

Rather than that, he might as well do everything in his power to suppress the opponent.

What if the other party fumbled and got split into two by him?

However, fighting with Ye Yuan, he was incomparably shocked in his heart.

His Great Dao Transformation was just one law transformation. Furthermore, it stopped at the third form.

But Ye Yuan’s three laws transformation was actually already cultivated to late-stage fourth form!

It was also precisely by relying on this that Ye Yuan was fighting with him until neither could gain the upper hand.

Guo Huai muse; once Ye Yuan broke through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, then how horrifying would his combat power be?
