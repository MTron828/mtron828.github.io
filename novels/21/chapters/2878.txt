Chapter 2884 Chaos Bloodstone!

It was still Yang Qing’s first time facing a Hegemon Realm powerhouse. He was somewhat lacking in confidence.

Although Ye Yuan said that the Blood Imitation Pill could hide from anyone’s eyes and ears, he was still uncertain in his heart.

After all, Hegemon Realms were virtually invincible existences. They had unimaginably queer divine abilities.

But very soon, Yang Qing felt relieved.

This Hegemon Realm powerhouse in front of them indeed could not tell as well.

In reality, if a Hegemon Realm was really hell-bent on examining them, he could still identify them.

But who could have thought that two measly humans could actually impersonate the blood race and even run to the blood race’s capital, becoming apex geniuses!

This was a blind spot thinking. Hegemon Realms were no exception either.

With such a genius appearing, Ye Wugui was very happy.

He already knew about Ye Yuan’s heaven-defying performance.

One blood pool exchanging for a genius with potential for Hegemon Realm was well worth it!

“Seeing this seat, you don’t seem to be afraid at all?” Ye Wugui sized Ye Yuan up rather interestedly.

“What’s there to be afraid of? Sooner or later, I’ll become one of you!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

A blood envoy of Lastingwind Continent immediately berated, “Insolent! Ignorant fool, do you think that Hegemon Realm is so

easy?”

Ye Yuan swept a glance at him and said coolly, “If you can say something like this, it proves that you’re getting further and further away from Hegemon Realm!”

“You! Impudent!” The blood envoy said furiously.

Ye Yuan’s words struck his sore spot.

Grand completion Emperor Sakra Heaven and even origin powerhouses not being able to break through to Hegemon Realm, it was actually their confidence being worn down after failing to break through time after time.

This hurdle was far too difficult!

However, once confidence was shaken, one would really get further and further away from Hegemon Realm.

Ye Wugui gave Ye Yuan a deep and meaningful glance, not expecting that he could actually say something like this.

Producing emotions of fear towards Hegemon Realm, one could basically say goodbye to Hegemon Realm in this lifetime.

Ye Wugui had long seen through. This blood envoy’s realm had basically reached an end already. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Ta Hai, enough! A dignified blood envoy, where’s the sense of propriety in arguing with a junior?” Ye Wugui said in a solemn voice.

The blood envoy’s face immediately had nowhere to put.

He, an exalted blood envoy, was actually reprimanded!

Ta Hai was on the worst terms with Owlfly, so Ye Yuan’s rise made him very displeased. Hence, he also targeted Owlfly time and again.

It was just that he never expected that Ye Wugui actually reprimanded him because of a junior.

It seemed like Hegemon Wugui thought very highly of this boy!

Owlfly was delighted to the extreme in his heart.

I did not expect that Your Father would have a day where I could turn things around too!

Ye Wugui could not be bothered to pay attention and said to Ye Yuan, “Bloodazure, your talent shows disdain upon your peers. You’re indeed a genius of my blood race that’s hard to come across! However, you already have no opponents among your peers. The hundred sons selection this time already doesn’t have much significance to you. In addition, your bloodline power has already reached the limit of Saint Sovereign Heaven. It’s very hard to improve it any further. Therefore, in the hundred sons selection this time, you don’t need to take part anymore. You also don’t need to go to the Blood God Temple’s blood pool anymore.” Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said, “How can that be? Not taking part, it’s insufficient to convince the masses! Others will even think that I, this Saint Sovereign Heaven’s number one, is self-proclaimed! City Lord Your Excellency rest assured, my bloodline power still has room for improvement. So I have to go to this blood pool! This is the Blood God Temple’s reward, City Lord Your Excellency wouldn’t strip me away of this bit of authority, right?”

What do you mean?

Not letting me kill anymore?

How can that be!

There are still so many geniuses that haven’t been killed!

My goal is to kill off all of the blood race’s Saint Sovereign Heaven geniuses!

Also, how can I not go to the blood pool?

If I don’t drain the blood pool, how many powerhouses are you all going to groom again?

These things are all mine!

Ye Wugui similarly frowned and said, “There’s already not much meaning for you to take part in these!”

Ye Yuan said unyieldingly, “I feel that I still have a lot of room for improvement! If City Lord Your Excellency wants to deprive me, Ye Yuan wants to request the Blood God Temple to return Bloodazure justice!”

Ye Wugui felt a headache!

Was this guy really not willing to let go of any benefits?

He was a little afraid that this guy would also drain the blood pool there after going to the Blood God Temple!

In the end, Ye Wugui said helplessly, “Alright. If you want to participate, that’s up to you too! However, participating in these indeed doesn’t have much significance to you anymore. Finding you is just to tell you that the clan has already agreed to give you a month’s time to comprehend the Chaos Bloodstone! In addition, the clan will devote resources to help you to break through to Hegemon Realm!”

The moment these words came out, apart from Ye Yuan, the other blood race upper echelons all trembled all over.

This treatment was also too good!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, and he said with palpitating excitement, “Chaos Bloodstone?”

Ye Wugui said with a nod, “Chaos Bloodstone, born from chaos, it’s the source power of our blood race! Our blood race was born from the Chaos Bloodstone! As long as you comprehend a trace, it will be sufficient for you to benefit for life!”

Ye Yuan’s breathing also became ragged.

If I were to destroy this Chaos Bloodstone, would the blood race collapse on its own without being attacked?

He knew that this monstrous performance had already attracted great attention from the blood race.

The blood race had started to spare no effort to groom him!

Looking at the expressions of the other blood envoys, he knew just how hard this opportunity to comprehend was to come by.

This trip was indeed not in vain!

He had already come into contact with some of the blood race’s major secrets!

Ye Yuan said excitedly, “Many thanks, City Lord Your Excellency, for the great favor! After Bloodazure’s cultivation has achieved success, I’ll go to the front-lines and kill off the human race and drink their blood!”

Ye Wugui said with a smile, “Very good! This is what men of my blood race should be like!”

......

The news of Ye Yuan’s ‘ascension’ spread like wildfire.

There were cheers in Heaven Absolute Blood Emperor City.

This god of killing was finally not taking part in the hundred sons selection anymore!

Even those top geniuses also let out a long sigh in relief.

These geniuses were all extremely proud and extremely confident.

But, facing a freak who could suck the blood pool dry, they could only let out a long sigh.

Bloodazure was destined to be the name that suppressed an era!

“Excellent! That fiend finally doesn’t need to participate anymore!”

“Thank God. If I were to run into him, I reckon that I won’t even have the chance to concede defeat!”

“Thank God! Thank you, Lord Wang Zuo! You really did a great thing!”

......

Many people wept agitatedly. Half a month later, the hundred sons battle was held as scheduled.

When Ye Yuan walked into the contestant area, everyone burst into an uproar!

“Didn’t they say that this god of killing went to the Blood God Temple? Why is he still taking part in the hundred sons selection?”

“I ... @#$)*1%! Motherf*cker, isn’t this bullying people? You’re already not on the same plane as us!”

“I forfeit! Your Father won’t take part anymore, alright?!”

Ye Yuan’s appearance cast a shadow over the entire hundred sons selection.

Those geniuses felt that the sky had turned dark.

“Hello, everyone. We meet again!” Ye Yuan greeted everyone with a smile. Everyone wished to go up and tear him to shreds.

But nobody dared to do anything!
