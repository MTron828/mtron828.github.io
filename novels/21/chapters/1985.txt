Chapter 1989: Bone Devil Three Swords

“E-Empyrean bone devil! How ... How can this be?”

Before their eyes, there was just one bone devil.

The undulation emitting off of this bone devil made everyone feel terror. What was this if not an Empyrean level bone devil?

No one could have expected that going through all kinds of hardships and difficulties to arrive at the opposite shore, what awaited them was an Empyrean level bone devil.

No wonder this emperor bone was never taken by people despite being placed here for so many years.

Crack!

Crack!

Crack!

The Empyrean bone devil walked toward everyone step by step. Each step it took, was like stepping on everyone’s hearts, making people palpitate with fear and anxiety.

That might which blotted out the skies and covered the earth made everyone almost suffocate.

“Run!”

Finally, someone could not resist and turned around and ran away.

That child of destiny even used his strength to suckle, his speed swift to the extreme.

Ye Yuan did not move, staring fixedly at the Empyrean bone devil.

It was only to see the bone devil’s skeleton claw slowly raise up, and then lightly flicked. A streak of light blue flowing light tore across the night sky, accurately hitting that child of destiny who fled.

Bang!

The child of destiny directly exploded in the air, leaving not even residue behind.

Everyone sucked in a mouthful of cold air, being shocked speechless by this scene.

Strong!

Too strong!

This was the strength of an Empyrean level bone devil. It made people unable to give rise to the slightest thought of resisting at all.

There was no chance of escaping.

As for joining hands to deal with this Empyrean bone devil ... don’t joke around! Even if put everyone together, it was also not enough to fill the crevices between his teeth.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan suddenly spoke up, “Senior, we came for the emperor bone. I wonder how we can get the emperor bone?”

The Empyrean bone devil turned its head rather mechanically, looking toward Ye Yuan.

The other people’s hearts leaped to their throats. Was this guy seeking death? He still wanted the emperor bone at this time?

Being stared at by the bone devil’s pair of holes, although Ye Yuan was startled, he did not panic.

He discovered that this bone devil had its own intelligence!

If it was the same as those bone devils previously, this Empyrean bone devil would have long annihilated them all, why would it wait until now?

To this Empyrean bone devil, this was merely a matter of raising a hand.

Hence, he asked boldly.

The bone devil’s pitch-black eyes stared at Ye Yuan and did not speak either, the air seemingly solidified.

Suddenly, the bone devil opened that skeleton mouth, the lower jaws moved, using a dry voice to say “As long as there’s someone ... who can receive three of my sword moves, they can ... take away ... His Excellency’s remains.”

“Hiss!”

Everyone drew another mouthful of cold air.

Receiving three of your sword moves ... who could still survive?

Forget about three sword moves, even one sword move could not be received either!

This joke was too much.

Ye Yuan looked at the bone devil and asked again, “Is it that if we can’t receive these three sword moves, we can’t leave?”

Everyone’s faces turned intent. Thinking of that guy who was instantly killed just now, they could not help feeling a chill in their hearts.

Who knew that that bone devil shook its head and said, “As long as you block one sword move, you can leave. These three sword moves, I’ll suppress my strength to the same realm as you.”

The bone devil seemed to have found the feeling, becoming much smoother when talking.

And when the group of children of destiny heard this, they immediately heaved a big sigh in relief.

If it unleashed this sword with Empyrean Realm, then no one needed to play anymore.

“Then ... if there are several people at the same time who receive Senior’s three sword moves, what then?” Ye Yuan asked again.

This time, the bone devil replied very quickly, “First come, first serve.”

Everyone’s eyes lit up. Someone immediately stepped forward and said, “I’ll go first!”

This person’s strength was not weak; he was also a middle-stage Fourth Firmament True God powerhouse.

They were all children of destiny, avowed that their strength stood head and shoulders above all others.

At least, they would not lose to same rank martial artists!

“Idiot!” Zhou Yu could not resist scolding under his breath.

The Empyrean bone devil did not say much, directly pulling out a bone from its rib.

Then, the shape of that bone actually started transforming, finally turning into a bone sword that was neither short nor long.

“Empyrean spirit treasure!” Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted slightly as he cried out in surprise.

The others had clearly seen the actual situation too. Just now, they completely did not feel it. They did not expect that, in a blink of an eye, this Empyrean bone devil actually magicked out an empyrean spirit treasure.

That child of destiny’s pupils also shrunk slightly, revealing a solemn look.

“Receive three sword moves, then this empyrean spirit treasure will also belong to the person. I give you all three days’ time to recover divine essence. Three days later, I’ll attack.”

The bone devil said nonchalantly, then immediately sat down cross-legged on the spot.

Three days’ time arrived in a twinkle. Everyone swallowed medicinal pills, their divine essence also pretty much recovered.

The bone devil and that child of destiny stood facing each other. The bone devil opened its mouth and said indifferently, “Now, this Empyrean is drawing his sword.”

The moment his voice faded, he stabbed the bone sword in his hand out indifferently.

Swish ...

The air emitted a whistling sound. A horrifying undulation closed in on that child of destiny.

The child of destiny also made his move!

The long spear was akin to a long rainbow cutting across the sky, flying straight for that sword.

There was no fierce divine essence collision like imagined. The long spear in the child of destiny’s hands turned into a pile of dust under this sword.

Then, his entire person was also sliced into countless chunks, dissipating with the wind.

His entire person seemed to have been weathered away.

Everyone’s pupils, including Ye Yuan’s, all shrunk.

They knew that this Empyrean’s sword move would be very strong. But they did not expect that it would be strong to such an extent.

That child of destiny also stormed over together with them.

Not saying that his strength was extremely strong, but it was at least not considered weak among this group of people. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, he could not even block the Empyrean bone devil’s one sword move!

The power of this sword move absolutely far surpassed the standard of a Fourth Firmament True God.

Even a Fifth Firmament True God was likely also completely not a match.

This was still just the first sword move. Then the second sword move and third sword move, how terrifying would they be?

Everyone could not help feeling a chill run down their spines. This Empyrean bone devil’s strength was too horrifying.

“Next!”

The Empyrean bone devil clearly did not plan on giving everyone time to be afraid and directly wanted to start the next round.

This time, no one jumped out.

No one dared to go and receive this sword.

“If there’s no one, this Empyrean will pick,” the Empyrean bone devil said coolly.

Everyone’s faces changed but saw the Empyrean bone devil extend his bone finger, and then he pointed at one of the children of destiny.

That child of destiny immediately felt his scalp tingle. The others also slightly heaved a sigh in relief.

That child of destiny stood there, his feet seemingly rooted to the spot, unable to even more.

“Not accepting the battle, directly annihilate.” The Empyrean bone devil went straight to the point.

That child of destiny’s face changed. Directly being annihilated, that was annihilating with the strength of Empyrean Realm.

If that was the case, he had even less of a chance.

Bracing himself, he stepped forward.

Then, the result did not have the least bit of surprise. He was obliterated with one sword move!

Following that, the Empyrean bone devil started picking several more people. But no one could receive a single move of his.

These Fourth Firmament True God proud sons of heaven were as feeble as tofu in front of this sword.

There were roughly close to 40 people who made it through the bone devil army.

The remaining were virtually all elites among elites. But in a blink of an eye, another seven to eight died.

The Empyrean bone devil’s finger was just like a death-hastening talisman.

Whoever it pointed to, they died!

After the Empyrean bone devil annihilated a child of destiny, his finger pointed, landing on Zhou Yu.

Zhou Yu’s face changed, toughening his scalp and stepping out of the ranks.
