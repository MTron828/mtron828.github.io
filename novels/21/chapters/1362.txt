Chapter 1366: Finally Ended!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“30 days is up! Those giving up the challenge, step out of the ranks. Those continuing to challenge, stay in place! Starting from now, each day you persist, you’ll obtain five academy points, no ceiling cap!”

The old man’s words were like a pardon, letting the people who persisted heaved a long sigh in relief.

Little Fatty directly jumped up, waving his hands and stamping his feet excitedly, laughing wildly.

“Hahaha ... Didn’t expect that I, Xie Jingyi, actually made it through! I actually made it through!”

The old man’s brows furrowed, and he said in a cold voice, “Those who pass the round are not to make a lot of noise! Otherwise, they will be expelled from the test!”

Xie Jingyi was immediately like a deflated ball, stepping out of the designated area very carefully.

Just 30 days down, more than a million martial artists were actually only left with several thousand people!

This elimination rate could be rated as horrifying.

In the wake of the old man’s announcement, the vast majority of the people all ceased challenging.

To the vast majority of the people, their willpower had long reached the limit already and could collapse at any time.

Continuing to challenge, the risk was too great.

With this departure, the enormous plaza immediately became extremely empty.

A massive plaza was only left with a mere four to five hundred people.

“That middle-stage Grotto Profound kid indeed pulled through! It’s just, no idea how long he can last!”

“After 30 days, the willpower scouring’s power will increase several times over! Middle-stage Grotto Profound, Wu Meng Academy’s best record was also just 50 points! I reckon that it’s just about there for this boy to last three days.”

“Mm, it’s pretty much this standard! Just don’t know how Heaven’s Might’s number one will be.”

“Heh, that’s hard to say! Qin Family’s Qin Shao, Su Family’s Su Yuecang, Xiang Family’s Xiangzhuang, Wu Family’s Wu Yang, as well as several major counties’ disciples, all have hope! Their strength should be almost on pair, it will depend on whose willpower is stronger!”

The two old men discussed the following competition. Starting from now, it was the real struggle!

The points obtained starting from now could be accumulated and brought into the academy.

More importantly, the number of points determined who the top dog belonged to in the end!

Boom!

A majestic willpower descended from the sky!

Seeing this scene, the faces of the people who backed out from the plaza all changed drastically.

They secretly rejoiced at quitting. Otherwise, this kind of pressure, how could they withstand it?

The current pressure was directly twice as strong as just now!

Even Ye Yuan also felt the pressure all over his body suddenly increase, and was no longer calm like before.

On the second day, this surge of willpower directly doubled again on top of the original foundation!

One genius after another fell in succession. Each and every one of them was extremely remorseful and angry. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But these people were not transported out. They continued to watch the fight in the waiting area.

On the third day, the willpower doubled again!

This degree of superimposition made everyone’s pressure on the plaza soar.

Fine sweat beads seeped out on Ye Yuan’s forehead. He finally started feeling overwhelmed.

Seeing this scene, Xie Jingyi’s knuckles cracked, and he thought to himself, Come on, Ye Yuan! When you pass the test, this bro will definitely invite you for a drink!

He knew that for him to be able to pass this first round, it was entirely due to Ye Yuan’s encouragement and help.

Without Ye Yuan, he could at most only last five or six days.

Now, he actually passed through miraculously!

Even if he was eliminated at the back, it was also sufficient to make those old things shut up when he returned to the family.

The willpower doubled every day compared to the previous day. Accumulating like this, it would become more and more terrifying.

It was just that, what made those two old men get a shock was that Ye Yuan actually surpassed his expectations and lasted till the fifth day!

The current Ye Yuan was already drenched in sweat all over. He was clearly almost reaching his limits already.

“This kid is actually able to hang on until now. Although his realm isn’t high, his willpower is really very strong!”

“Yeah! Middle-stage Grotto Profounds able to last until the fifth day have already not appeared in many years. But it looks like he already reached his limits. He probably can’t make it through tomorrow!”

The other party deeply felt that way too. With Ye Yuan’s current state, tomorrow’s willpower doubling again, there was no way he could hold on.

Boom!

The moment the sixth day arrived, a powerful willpower akin to Mount Tai was crushing down, pressing Ye Yuan until his chest felt stifled, nearly spewing out a mouthful of blood.

If let’s say the first day’s willpower was just a hundred feet waterfall formed by a small stream, then the current willpower was a 100 thousand feet waterfall!

That scouring energy was sufficient to destroy everything!

Jiang Chen had been paying attention to Ye Yuan all along. Seeing this, he said to Song Fang, “I really didn’t expect that he could actually persist till the 36th day!”

Song Fang smiled and said, “If I didn’t remember wrongly, you also just persisted 40 days back then! But you were already grand completion Grotto Profound at that time!”

Jiang Chen nodded and said, “Yeah! Hence, this kid’s potential is probably much greater than mine!”

Song Fang said, “Not necessarily true either. Martial Dao willpower is just one aspect! Not passing the other two rounds, it’s still useless.”

Time slowly trickled by. In a twinkle, the 36th day was going to pass. But Ye Yuan did not fall on the 36th day like everyone imagined.

He pulled through!

Then, 37th day, 38th day, 39th day, 40th day!

Each day that passed, the astonishment in everyone’s heart grew stronger!

Ye Yuan was just like an unkillable cockroach. Whenever people thought that he was going to collapse, he would straighten his back again and make it through.

Now, there were only 20 over people left in the entire plaza.

These 20 over people, apart from Ye Yuan, were all grand completion Grotto Profound. There was not a single late-stage Grotto Profound!

“This boy ... How in the world did he do it? Could it be that he isn’t afraid of being directly killed by Heaven’s Might?” said one of the old men with incredible shock.

“He has already tied with middle-stage Grotto Profound’s highest record. If this continues ...” He could not quite dare to imagine.

At this time, there was already no one paying attention to the others. Everyone’s gazes were all focused on Ye Yuan.

They all wanted to see just when this unkillable cockroach would fall!

41st day!

Ye Yuan broke through middle-stage Grotto Profound’s highest record without any surprises!

Then, 42nd day, 43rd day ... 48th day!

“Puhwark!”

The 48th day’s willpower suddenly descended. Ye Yuan finally could not bear it and spewed out a large mouthful of blood.

Then, Ye Yuan slowly stood up from the lotus seat, his entire person appearing dispirited and inert.

Including the two old men, everyone all heaved a long sigh in relief.

“Finally ended!”

No idea why, everyone actually had a feeling akin to being relieved of a heavy burden.

“Heh, bro, you’re really too fierce! If you held on for two more days, my jaws would drop off!”

When Ye Yuan came to the waiting area, Xie Jingyi immediately rushed up to give Ye Yuan a punch, then hugged Ye Yuan and started praising madly.

At this time, there were still three people left on the plaza!

This first round, Ye Yuan concluded with the result of fourth place, obtaining 90 points!
