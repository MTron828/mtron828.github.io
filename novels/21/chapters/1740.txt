1744 Mortal Grade

“Saw that, kid? Big talk isn’t boasted! If you can complete the Purple Fume Divine Incense Wood, consider it my loss!”

After returning, Mu Yuanchun was rather pleased with himself and looked scornfully at Ye Yuan. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

With his strength, passing the test was simply a breeze.

This assessment was merely a formality for him.

Kong Lin already said that Mu Yuanchun was already his junior apprentice brother in front of so many people. This was not the treatment that ordinary people could get.

Hence, Mu Yuanchun was fired up with boundless enthusiasm currently.

Of course, no one felt that it was improper, and instead cast looks of admiration towards him.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Then you’ll lose for sure.”

The moment Mu Yuanchun heard, he was tickled and said with a sneer, “Really taking yourself to be someone noteworthy! Cocky, continue being cocky! I’ll see how you still be arrogant in a while!”

Toward this, Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and was disdainful to dispute.

“Next, Ye Yuan!”

Finally, it was Ye Yuan’s turn to take the field. Everyone all showed sympathetic looks towards him.

Were there geniuses among alchemists?

Yes!

Mu Yuanchun was a genius!

But this genius similarly needed the accumulation of a long time.

For Mu Yuanchun to be able to have his current strength, it was absolutely not achieved overnight, but also through long-term accumulation.

Hence, what Ye Yuan said about how this kind of understanding would not work on him, everyone rejected it in their hearts.

One had to know, even a genius like Mu Yuanchun, when he was at Ye Yuan’s age, he also could not possibly pass the Purple Fume Divine Incense Wood’s test.

As for the Willow Cloud Wood, that was even more impossible.

Ye Yuan slowly walked in front of Kong Lin. Kong Lin said indifferently, “Pick one yourself.”

The scene earlier, Kong Lin naturally took it into his sights too.

Regarding Ye Yuan’s remarks, he was naturally disdainful.

“Can I pick a wood outside of these three types or not?” Ye Yuan did not choose but asked Kong Lin.

Kong Lin frowned slightly and said, “Messing around! The rules of the priest examination are decided by the temple, how can it be easily changed? I think that you’re deliberately here to cause trouble, right?”

Seeing this scene, the other examinees all revealed gloating smiles.

They were already very sure that Ye Yuan was here to cause trouble.

Ye Yuan was indifferent and said, “Brother Kong said earlier to display your greatest strength. I feel that these three kinds of wood can’t display my strength.”

The moment Kong Lin heard, he laughed from extreme anger and said, “Is that so? Then what kind of wood can show your strength?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Is there any mortal grade paper?”

When these words came out, the audience burst into an uproar.

A wood that was easier to ignite than the Willow Cloud Wood, there were naturally many.

But mortal grade, that was simply an impossible task.

This guy was being funny, right?

What kind of concept was mortal grade?

Even if the most rubbish divine fire revealed an iota of heat, that thing would turn to ashes!

Using rank four divine fire to burn mortal grade paper, did this guy’s head really have no problem?

After the shock, mockery came in quick succession.

Kong Lin finally could not resist erupting and said furiously, “Blind and reckless fool, to dare toy with the Priest Temple!”

As he said those words, Kong Lin was about to take action to take Ye Yuan down, but then he saw Ye Yuan smiled faintly. Ye Yuan said, “Whether or not I’m messing with the temple, you need to at least wait for me to complete the test before having a final verdict, right? It’s just a matter of a short while. Does Brother Kong not even have this bit of patience?”

Kong Lin smiled coldly when he heard that and said, “Mortal grade paper, even elders can’t do it, with just the likes of you, a snotty brat?”

“Heh heh, I said it long ago, this guy is simply here to cause trouble! Senior Apprentice Brother Kong Lin, immediately take him down!” At this time, Mu Yuanchun also spoke up.

Kong Lin was just about to make a move when the Elder Stonefeather sitting in the middle spoke.

He said, “Kong Lin, let him try.”

Kong Lin’s face changed and he bowed and said, “Yes, Master!”

He could not figure out, this punk who was clearly making trouble. So why did his master give Ye Yuan this chance?

Before long, the servants found a piece of mortal grade blank paper.

Ye Yuan received it, took a look, and said, “Mortal grade tier 9, uh ... forget it, I’ll make do with it.”

Kong Lin sneered when he saw the situation and said, “Could it be that you still want to use mortal grade tier 1 wood?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you can find it, it’s not impossible too.”

Kong Lin was greatly enraged the moment he heard and said, “Arrogant!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Alchemists need to have a calm mind. Brother Kong is angered so easily. This won’t do!”

“You! You dare to lecture me?” Kong Lin was already about to rampage.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Dare not, I was just stating a fact. Excuse me, can I start?”

Kong Lin’s expression changed several times and he said in a solemn voice, “I want to take a look at how you pass the round! Begin!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and tossed the piece of paper upward. Hs palm moving, a cluster of pale-yellow flames immediately rose up, wrapping the piece of paper up.

When everyone saw this scene, they were immediately dumbfounded with shock.

Did this guy really know how to control fire?

Using such a big fire to go and burn a sheet of mortal grade paper, it would become flying ashes upon contact, right?

Forget about mortal grade, even the Goldsilk Divine Wood could not withstand this kind of burning too!

When they controlled fire, which one wasn’t watchful and cautious, fearful of producing a bit more fire.

But Ye Yuan was completely operating without any regard for niceties!

This kind of fire control, using it to directly deal with the enemy was more like it.

Refining pills?

Better forget it!

Refining pills like this would refine medicinal pills into black charcoal.

When Kong Lin saw this scene, he could not help smiling coldly and said, “I knew it! Ignorant fool, prepare to suffer the wrath of the temple!”

Mu Yuanchun even laughed himself into fits and said, “This brat ... This brat is simply here to be a fool, I was successfully amused with him.”

Not just them, the other examinees all guffawed with laughter.

At this moment, they were incomparably certain that Ye Yuan was here to make trouble.

Although they did not know what was the goal, his objective of seeking popularity by doing something sensational was achieved.

However, they did not notice that the eyes of those three elders on the high platform emitted rays of brilliant light, full of incredulity.

Because being enveloped in flames, the others could not see the appearance of the paper at this time.

Because no need to think and they also knew that the paper already turned to ashes at this time.

But Ye Yuan was still putting on a pretense there.

Kong Lin shouted coldly, “Alright, stop pretending there. Watch this!”

Kong Lin was just about to make a move to take Ye Yuan down, but then he heard Stonefeather said coldly, “Stop!”

Everyone was stunned. Kong Lin also revealed a doubtful look and said, “Master, this ...”

Stonefeather just said coolly, “Carry on watching!”

With this, they could not laugh anymore.

It was only for them to see Ye Yuan pull his palm back, and the divine fire dissipated into nothing. A piece of paper drifted down.

Everyone’s pupils constricted, looking at this scene in disbelief.

“R-Really did it! This mortal grade paper is actually completely unscathed!”

“This is impossible! I’m so far away and could even feel the temperature of the flames! How can such a weak piece of paper be completely fine?”

“Could it be that his fire controlling technique is truly transcendent to this kind of degree? To actually be even more impressive than Mu Yuanchun!”
