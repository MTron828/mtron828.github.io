“Hur hur,?who does he think he is? These 50 thousand over people will all listen to him?”

“This boy is clearly a fool! I know about Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. That place is simply a masterless land, with sects standing in great numbers, neither convinced by the others!”

“With a beauty accompanying, he probably doesn’t know his surname anymore, right?”

… …

The moment Ye Yuan opened his mouth, mocking voices immediately came from all around.

Forget about Ye Yuan; even Kong Tan, Yu Ran, these people, it was impossible to make 50 thousand geniuses of a race listen to one person too.

However, before his voice faded, the 50 thousand people behind Ye Yuan attacked simultaneously.

Kong Tan’s eyeballs popped out!

In terms of strength, the fiend race was definitely stronger than Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven.

But with more than 50 thousand people versus 2000 people, this was complete devastation!

No matter how strong you were, it was useless too!

Let alone that ever since entering the Labyrinth Divine Palace, these people’s strength had already made great progress.

Kong Tan finally understood what Yang Qing’s words meant.

These 2000 fiends were instantly drowned by the sea of people!

In an instant, a large group of fiends died.

“Enough! I apologize! I apologize!” Kong Tan shouted.

The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth curled slightly and he said, “Stop!”

The 50 thousand people executed the order without fail; they immediately stopped and returned.

This scene made everyone draw a breath of cold air.

They could not help becoming curious about Ye Yuan’s identity. Who could make 50 thousand people be so obedient?

In one exchange, the fiend race had several hundred people dead.

Kong Tan had a black face as he came before Ye Yuan and said, “I can apologize, but kneeling is absolutely impossible!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Sure!”

Kong Tan gave a bow to Feng Qingxuan and said, “Fairy Feng, Kong Tan was wrong. I apologize to you!”

Feng Qingxuan gave a cold snort and said, “I warned you before! My man isn’t to be trifled with!”

Ye Yuan had black lines on his head.

Kong Tan had black lines on his head too.

But at this time, everyone’s focus shifted to Ye Yuan all at once.

Just where did this enigmatic young man pop out from?

All of them thought that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s leader was Yang Qing.

But looking at it now, it was not!

Yang Qing said unhappily, “Why didn’t you wipe them you? This isn’t your style!”

He knew that Ye Yuan was decisive in going for the kill.

With Kong Tan’s words and actions earlier, exterminating the fiend race was also not impossible.

Ye Yuan said meaningfully, “A rabbit will bite if cornered. Now isn’t the time to show your cards. This place has the rules here. Once we cross it, the consequences will be very severe.”

Yang Qing felt at a loss, uncertain what it meant.

Although he did not kill Kong Tan, suppressing the fiend race’s young patriarch to lower his head to admit his fault, this was already shocking enough.

One had to know that Kong Tan was not only the fiend race’s young patriarch. He was even number two in the ranking here after Yang Qing!

If not for Yang Qing this freak, he would have been number one.

How proud was such a genius?

Ye Yuan looked toward Yu Ran, Wang Ningyan, and the rest. He then said coolly, “Also, you all!”

Yu Ran’s expression changed, and she said, “Goodness, this big brother is so fierce! I’m a weak girl. How can you be like this?”

Wang Ningyan’s pupils constricted, and she said coldly, “You’re a human. You should know humanity’s three supreme heavens! My Purple Extreme Heaven Pavilion isn’t what you can afford to provoke!”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “In that case, you want me to make a move?”

Wang Ningyan’s expression turned dark. This guy really did not know how to cherish beauties!

She gritted her teeth and also apologized to Feng Qingxuan.

Although Yu Ran was reluctant, she also knew that circumstances were stronger than people.

They all, these people added up, were not a match for Ye Yuan’s army too.

Yang Qing’s mouth curled, and he said unhappily, “This tortoise grandson stole this emperor’s limelight again!”

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said, “Do you still want to break through to Emperor Sakra Heaven or not?”

Yang Qing immediately switched expressions and said fawningly, “I want, I want!?Hur hur,?Heavenly Saint Ye is the best!”

When everyone saw this scene, they were even more shocked.

Even Yang Qing was actually so obsequious in front of Ye Yuan?

Ye Yuan ignored everyone’s shock and said coolly, “These natural treasures, I’m taking half. You all don’t have objections, right?”

We do!

But was there a use?

Clearly, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of letting them answer either, rushing straight into this large-scale medicine garden.

Actually, reaching Emperor Vast Heaven, Emperor Sakra Heaven Realm, it was already very difficult to find some heavenly medicines.

Sometimes, one could run across more than half of the 33 Heavens in order to refine a grade eight heavenly pill or a grade nine heavenly pill.

But there was everything here!

Some of the precious heavenly medicines in the Hundred Herbs Illustrated Handbook could all be found here!

To heavenly alchemists, this place was simply paradise.

The Labyrinth Divine Palace was well-deserving of being the number one great sect of all the heavens. They had practically collected the most precious heavenly medicines in all heavens.

And these heavenly medicines were seemingly free, scattered in the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s outer-periphery medicine garden.

Ye Yuan naturally would not be courteous. He took all of the heavenly medicines that he needed away.

When the others saw this scene, their hearts dripped blood!

At this time, the people around the medicine garden became more and more.

The geniuses from all heavens had all gathered here.

The medicine garden’s heavenly medicines got lesser and lesser. Very soon, Ye Yuan had collected half.

When Ye Yuan went out of the medicine garden, he immediately had his path blocked by several figures.

He raised his brows and said, “Why? Does everyone want to rob me?”

Zhou Xianchen had a haughty look as he said with a cold smile, “Kid, you seized so many heavenly medicines, but you can’t refine high quality heavenly pills. Isn’t it a wanton waste of God’s good gifts?”

Ye Yuan was greatly interested and said with a smile,?“Oh??You mean that you can refine it?”

Zhou Xianchen said proudly, “Of course! 33 Heavens, the peak of Alchemy Dao is in humanity’s three supreme heavens! And Abyss Pass Origin Grotto Heaven’s strongest is our Zhoutian Emperor Palace’s Progenitor Endless!”

Another person said, “Vast Court Firmament Limit Heaven, our Lin Yuan Pavilion is the outstanding one!”

The third person said, “Han Chong Miao Cheng Heaven, our Emperor One Sect is the well-deserved number one!”

These two people, one was the Lin Yuan Pavilion’s number one genius, Chu Fang, and the other was the Emperor One Sect’s Dizi Jinnan.

Seeing Ye Yuan hoard so many heavenly medicines, the three of them naturally had ideas.

Zhou Xianchen said, “If I didn’t remember wrongly, in your Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, the strongest in Alchemy Dao is Cloudmount, right? Back then, he even came to my Zhoutian Emperor Palace to ask Ancestor Endless for guidance! When he sees Ancestor Endless again, he’ll have to carry out the etiquette of a disciple too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “So, what’s the meaning of you guys stopping me?”

Zhou Xianchen said, “Very simple. These precious heavenly medicines are a waste to be placed with you too. Whatever heavenly pills you need, we can help you refine! But, as compensation, you need to share some heavenly medicines with us!”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he laughed.

It had really been very long since anyone dared to posture in front of him with Alchemy Dao.

Even if it was Cloudmount, he did not dare to casually posture in front of him too.

One had to know, when Ye Yuan had not entered profound grade back then, Cloudmount was already beyond shocked.

In terms of strength, he was inferior to Cloudmount. But, in terms of talent, he shook Cloudmount off by too much.

“Hur hur,?I appreciate your good intentions. But … even if I waste these heavenly medicines, I won’t do it through others too,” Ye Yuan said with a chuckle.
