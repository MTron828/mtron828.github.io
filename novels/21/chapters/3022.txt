Chapter 3021: This Punch isn’t Simple!

At West Sun City’s main camp, more than 800 bloodline warriors were seated neatly at the plaza.

Valiant and spirited.

But the Heaven One army powerhouses all stayed far away.

These guys were too scary, even though everyone knew that they were all their saviors.

“Ye Yuan, you tortoise grandson! Today, I, Emperor Azuresky, will definitely trample you underfoot, counterattacking perfectly!” Above the void, Yang Qing swung his long spear, pointing at Ye Yuan from afar, incomparably domineering.

Ye Yuan could not help laughing and said, “Let’s have a match then. Do you need to set up such a grand line-up?”

Yang Qing snorted coldly and said, “That’s different! I’m going to defeat you in front of everyone! I’ve already waited a hundred years for this day. How can it be done carelessly? Let them see that I, Emperor Azuresky, am humanity’s strongest person in this era!”

Ye Yuan shrugged and said helplessly, “Directly use your strongest move then. Otherwise, you don’t have the chance.”

Yang Qing said disdainfully, “I know that you’re very strong now, but it’s useless! The current me is no longer who I was back then! Today, you don’t stand a chance!”

Yang Qing naturally saw Ye Yuan blocking the blow for Qin Shan too.

However, he touched his own heart and felt that in his peak condition, it would not be hard for him to do it too.

After consuming Ye Yuan’s heavenly pill, his injuries recovered very quickly, and his severed arm also regenerated.

Hence, he arranged to fight with Ye Yuan without delay.

Furthermore, he called all of West Sun City’s soldiers out. It was for the sake of witnessing his victory.

Actually, there was no need for him to summon everyone. This battle was indeed very high-profile.

Even Feng Xiaotian was also very curious how strong Ye Yuan’s current strength was.

It was because he kept feeling that he could not quite see through Ye Yuan.

He, an exalted Hegemon, actually could not see through an Emperor Vast Heaven. How could this not surprise him?

As for some of the Emperor Realm powerhouses, they had virtually all arrived.

Without a doubt, these two people were the most outstanding existences among Emperor Realm powerhouses in the current generation.

Their battle also determined who the title strongest belonged to.

It was impossible for this battle not to draw attention even if they did not want to.

“Who do you guys think is stronger, Emperor Azuresky or Ye Yuan?

“Does this still need to be said? Of course, it’s Emperor Azuresky! These few years, how many Emperor Vast Heavens have died at his hands? It can’t even be calculated, right? Ye Yuan’s methods are very strange, but his strength is most likely inferior to Yang Qing.”

“Mn,?that’s true! Back then, Ye Yuan could jump realms to defeat Yang Qing. But now, he definitely can’t do it! The current Emperor Azuresky is reputed to be the next Hegemon Bufan, his combat strength sweeping across Emperor Vast Heaven! Ye Yuan is just lower Emperor Vast Heaven. Even if he can jump realms to battle, it’s impossible to be his match too.”

“While Emperor Azuresky is strong, he just likes to posture too much! He has always viewed Ye Yuan as his greatest rival. This time, he can finally get his wish.”

… …

Regarding this fight, most people still did not feel optimistic about it.

It was because, during the past years, Yang Qing’s awe-inspiring reputation was too great.

No matter how strong the opponent was, he could always beat the opponent.

Ye Yuan’s talent naturally went without saying. But, it was still easier for people to believe the things in front of them.

In the crowd, Qin Shan said with a disdainful look,?“Humph!?A guy who overestimates his own abilities! Does he think that Yang Qing is still the Yang Qing before?”

He did not like these two people, but he also admitted that Yang Qing was very strong!

Incredibly strong!

“Ye Yuan, watch closely! This move is the strongest move that this seat comprehended these few years! None has ever survived under this move! Be careful!”

Suddenly, Yang Qing put away the flippant look. A layer of destructive aura rose up on the tip of the spear.

He had never underestimated Ye Yuan before.

This was true, even if Ye Yuan was two minor realms lower than him.

For Ye Yuan to say so, he naturally had reliance. But Yang Qing also had absolute confidence in himself.

The current him was really different already.

The reason why he wanted to publicize the fight to the public, it also originated from precisely this powerful confidence.

Feeling this destructive aura, Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up too.

Very strong!

“It’s Myriad Dao Annihilation Spear! I didn’t expect that Emperor Azuresky actually directly unleashed his strongest move!”

“Under this move, there have never been survivors among Emperor Vast Heaven experts! Isn’t he afraid of killing Ye Yuan in one move?”

“I thought that they were just sparring. I didn’t expect that it’s actually for real! With this, Ye Yuan is in trouble!”

… …

Feng Xiaotian had a look of surprise too. He did not expect that Yang Qing actually directly used his killing move.

This move was comprehended by Yang Qing in battle. It could be said to be the grand achievement that gathered the Spear Dao and Dao of Destruction!

Even he also sighed at his own inferiority at the power.

Back then, Hegemon Bufan had said before that this move showed signs of surpassing him.

It was also precisely after that incident that Yang Qing was treated as Hegemon Bufan’s successor. His status had no equal for some time!

Everyone did not expect that Yang Qing actually unleashed such a killing move against his good friend!

“Kill!”

Yang Qing shouted fiercely, a spear tearing across the sky.

Under a spear, myriad Daos were annihilated!

The Great Dao rules around him were being completely obliterated!

Emperor Vast Heaven Realm was unable to mobilize rules at all under this move!

This move was truly formidable to the extreme.

Ye Yuan grinned and said, “I didn’t expect that you really got much stronger! If I didn’t encounter some lucky chances recently, I would really not have been your match. Yang Qing, watch my punch!”

There was no overly garish power on his body.

Four great true spirit bloodlines erupted in full force. A fist punched straight over!

This punch carried an incomparably sacred aura.

He did not need to mobilize heaven and earth rules at all. Rules birthed on their own!

Boom!

It was only to see Ye Yuan smash a fist over. That destructive aura immediately fell apart!

Yang Qing spewed out a large mouthful of blood with a cough, his figure flying out like a cannonball.

One punch defeated Yang Qing!

“How is this possible!” Qin Shan’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in shock.

“How is this possible! That … That is saint force!” Feng Xiaotian said in astonishment.

The entire West Sun City instantly exploded!

This battle was too fast.

They thought that this was bound to be a shocking great battle.

But who knew that the result was so fast.

Ye Yuan only used one punch and defeated Emperor Azuresky, who was invincible in their hearts!

“N-No way, right? Emperor Azuresky is so weak?”

“It’s not that Emperor Azuresky is weak. It’s that Ye Yuan is too strong!”

“Can’t bear to look straight at it! Yang Qing came up with such a grand line-up. In the end, he didn’t even make it through a punch!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“They are good friends! This also just nicely helped Ye Yuan to achieve an awe-inspiring reputation! Ye Yuan is still that undefeatable Ye Yuan!”

… …

At one time, Ye Yuan was the synonym for being invincible in the same rank.

It was just that along with his departure, this term was replaced by Yang Qing.

But, with this battle today, Ye Yuan took back this title again.

What belonged to him ultimately belonged to him!

“Ahhh!?How is this possible? How can I possibly not even receive a punch of yours? This doesn’t make sense! This doesn’t make sense!” Yang Qing directly rushed in front of Ye Yuan and pointed at his nose as he said in puzzlement.

All these years, the invincible confidence that he had built was crushed at this moment.

It was not that he had not thought of failure before. It was just that he never thought that he would be defeated so thoroughly, unable to even receive a punch from Ye Yuan.

Moreover, he could tell that Ye Yuan’s punch did not have any martial technique at all. He just erupted with bloodline power and threw out a very ordinary punch.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This punch isn’t simple!”
