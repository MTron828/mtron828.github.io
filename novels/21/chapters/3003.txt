Chapter 3002: What He Comprehended, Isn’t Right!

“What a boundless aura! This is the Eternal River. How beautiful.”

“It feels like if I jump into the river, I’ll be able to reach the Great Beyond!”

“Maybe my Martial Dao can recover in the Eternal River!”

… …

Amidst the endless void, a large river cascaded down, magnificent and grandiose.

The river water ran a long course from a remote source as if it was endless.

It was like a fountain, nourishing every heaven and myriad worlds.

The strongest feeling that the Eternal River gave to people was unfathomable!

Ye Yuan could even feel the Eternal River branches flowing into Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven, supporting this world forever without extinguishing.

However, this boundless aura was different from anywhere in the 33 Heavens.

It had no attributes!

No origins, no rules, no wind, rain, thunder, lightning, and also no light nor darkness.

But it was extremely powerful!

It was even more powerful than Great Beyond Realm.

This kind of feeling was not something that one could explain clearly and make people understand.

“Kid, there’s only one chance. You’re sure that you want to enter the Eternal River?” Long Jian confirmed again.

Ye Yuan grinned and leaped, jumping into the Eternal River. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Long Jian nearly fainted in anger.

This boy was hopeless!

“Humph!

?Not listening to the advice of the elderly, suffering is right ahead! This fool, let him go and regret it!” Long Jian said crossly.

“Haha,?this brat is young and aggressive, don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Many geniuses are like him, being too impatient to wait to enter the Eternal River, thinking that they can be remolded anew. But in the end, each and every one regretted it very much!”

“The path of cultivation still needs to be advancing gradually and entrenching yourself at every step. This kid will regret it!”

“As an Emperor Cloud Heaven, he hasn’t even broken one seal on the Door of Eternal Life. He can’t feel the vastness of the Emperor Cloud Heaven at all! I reckon that he probably can’t even break through a minor realm.”

… …

Regarding Ye Yuan’s action, many Hegemons were waiting to watch the joke.

The vastness of the Eternal River was not what everyone could feel.

Only by opening the Door of Eternal Life’s seal could one experience it more clearly.

But Ye Yuan had not even opened one seal, and he already had delusions of grandeur about having some amazing performance. Was it possible?

“Alright, you all enter the Eternal River too! Remember, no matter how much you can comprehend, you all can’t enter the main stream! Otherwise, nobody can save you! Furthermore, even in the branch stream, the area that you all can move around in is limited too. If there’s no effect, come onto land in time,” Long Jian warned.

Everyone’s expressions were slightly somber, saying one after another yes.

Several thousand people all jumped into the Eternal River’s branch stream.

“Long Ran, don’t harbor too much hope. Of these several thousand, if there can be 200 people who can get back their path of martial arts, we have to express thanks to heaven and earth already. For the others, the outcome is already fated to be,” Long Jian said.

Long Ran nodded and said, “I know! But this is the only hope for them!”

Long Jian said, “Ye Yuan this boy has quite the means, but his ambition is too great. Too tough, and it’s easily broken. In my view, his future path of Martial Dao might not be very high.”

Long Ran smiled and said, “Is that so? But I feel that this boy has a bright future!”

Long Ran could not help laughing as he said, “Long Ran, how many geniuses have you and I seen before? Some people are even more breathtaking than Ye Yuan! But, in the entire dragon race, there are merely a scanty few dozen people who reached Hegemon Realm in the end!”

Long Ran smiled and did not speak. He naturally had his view.

How could someone that Progenitor Mi Tian thinks highly of possibly fade into the crowd?

… …

“Ye Yuan, wasting the golden opportunity for you to enter the Eternal River for my sake, I’m really sorry,” Mi Tian said with a sigh.

As a Great Beyond Realm powerhouse, Mi Tian naturally knew how important the chance to enter the Eternal River was.

But Ye Yuan wasted it without the slightest hesitation for him. He was moved in his heart but very ashamed and guilty.

In the Eternal River branch stream, Ye Yuan felt that every pore on his body had opened up.

“Senior, did Hegemon Chaos comprehend the Wordless Heavenly Skill in the Eternal River?” Ye Yuan did not answer Mi Tian but asked a question instead.

Mi Tian was taken aback and said with a nod, “That’s right! This old man wasn’t an amazingly talented person before, but when he broke through to Hegemon Realm, he entered the Eternal River and had a grand awakening, comprehending the Wordless Heavenly Skill. That was how he corroborated his Dao to become a Supreme Hegemon. Why did you suddenly ask about this?”

Ye Yuan looked at this endless Eternal River and was somewhat spellbound as he said, “I think I comprehended.”

Mi Tian was taken aback and said, “Comprehended? Haven’t you long comprehended the Wordless Heavenly Skill?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “What he comprehended wasn’t correct!”

Mi Tian was speechless.

Ye Yuan said, “Chaos flows out of the Eternal River, developing myriad Dao. Hegemon Chaos is tracing the origin, imitating Chaos Heavenly Dao with his own cultivation, deriving all life. Little did he imagine that if he’s unable to reach the Great Beyond, he wouldn’t be able to truly trace it to the source. Without the source, where lies chaos? His path doesn’t work!”

What kind of realm was Mi Tian at? With this bit from Ye Yuan, he understood.

Hegemon Chaos’ strength was exceedingly formidable. He was only half a step away from Great Beyond too.

But this half a step was as difficult as ascending to heaven.

Only now did Mi Tian know that it was not that Hegemon Chaos was lacking in talent. But it was that his path was wrong to begin with!

His cultivation method could only sustain him to cultivate until below Great Beyond but was unable to let him ascend to the summit.

“Then isn’t your cultivation path all wrong?” Mi Tian said in surprise.

Ye Yuan said, “It’s wrong, but also not wrong!”

Mi Tian frowned and said, “How do you mean?”

Ye Yuan said, “His path is the opposite! Under Heavenly Dao, all lives are akin to ants! Since you’re an ant, how do you transform Dao into one, and give birth to all life? You think that you’re standing sufficiently high, but actually, you’re merely a frog at the bottom of a well! Just what lies at the Door of Eternal Life’s end, nobody knows as well. You all, these existences born from chaos, might have a glimmer of hope. But it’s definitely impossible for him. Chaos is too high. It’s not what he can connect to! But, by acting in a diametrically opposite way, gaining enlightenment on myriad Great Dao, comprehending the numerous ways of life, combining Dao into one, one might be able to corroborate Great Dao!”

Mi Tian’s pupils constricted, and he said, “Doesn’t that mean that Samsara, that old thing’s path, is correct?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “The path of samsara, comprehending the numerous ways of life, feeling the samsara of the world. Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, deriving myriad Dao, tracing back to the source. Cloud Dream Soul Physique, dreaming for 3000 years, gaining enlightenment on longevity in one day. These paths might all be correct, or … they are all wrong. But all roads lead to Rome; the direction is correct!”

Mi Tian understood.

No matter what method you used to break open the Door of Eternal Life, the final result was all the same.

Only by comprehending all life and myriad Dao, combining the two into one, could one corroborate their Dao!

Hegemon Samsara, walking a path all the way without turning back.

But he trod out his own Dao and comprehended all life and myriad Dao with the Dao of Samsara!

With Myriad Dao combining into one, his strength was strong to the extreme!

Very clearly, Hegemon Samsara had long comprehended, so his strength was unfathomable.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Mi Tian felt like he was suddenly enlightened.

“Then what are you planning to do?” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan did not answer. It was only to see countless light dots emitting from his body, like the stars in the night sky, following the Eternal River’s water as it rushed down in a torrent!

Mi Tian’s pupils constricted, and he cried out in surprise, “Divine sense transforming into myriad!”
