Chapter 2281: Carrot and Stick

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Looking at his new world, Ye Yuan’s face could not help revealing a wry smile.

“Even if expanded a hundred times, my world is also just a drop in the ocean compared to the Heavenspan World!”

Ye Yuan’s internal world was not the slightest bit inferior to the Heavenspan World in terms of quality.

But in terms of scale, it was far inferior.

Compared to the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan’s internal world could be said to be a pocket-sized world.

However, Ye Yuan was not discouraged.

The Heavenspan Mountain was a complete world, while his world still had a lot of potentials which could keep on being tapped.

He believed that one day, he could create a world that could be on par with the Heavenspan Mountain.

“I just broke through to the World Realm currently, but the thickness in terms of divine essence is already not inferior to peak First Firmament Heavenly Emperor! Coupled with Time Freeze and other divine abilities, even if I run into Third Firmament Heavenly Emperors, I have the power to fight too!”

The breakthrough this time, the increase in strength was tremendous.

When he was at peak Chaos Realm, he could cut down a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouse.

Now that his strength soared, being able to rival Third Firmament Heavenly Emperors was not incomprehensible.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s expression changed wildly and he cried out in shock, “Damn it, here it is again!”

The eighth Nirvanic Tribulation arrived as promised!

Every inch of Ye Yuan’s body was becoming decayed and aged.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan discovered that the nirvanic tribulation this time actually could not be defied!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, and he said with a cold snort, “So what if it can’t be defied? I have an entire world as my backing. Can’t I pull through a measly little nirvanic tribulation? Heaven and earth law, impose on my body!”

Ye Yuan established a connection between his fleshy body and the entire chaos world, drawing on the chaos world’s power endlessly.

Those necrotic muscles were regenerating at a speed visible to the naked eye!

However, the rank eight nirvanic tribulation was indeed terrifying. Even if he drew the power of the world, it could only barely manage to let the speed of regeneration catch up to the speed of necrosis.

However, Ye Yuan’s chaos world could draw the outside world’s heaven and earth spiritual energy inexhaustibly to replenish. It was equivalent to Ye Yuan borrowing the power of the Heavenspan Mountain to tide over the nirvanic tribulation this time.

No matter how strong your nirvanic tribulation was, it was also impossible to be stronger than the Heavenspan Mountain.

No idea how long time had passed, and then the nirvanic tribulation finally stopped.

The speed of regeneration finally surpassed the rate of necrosis.

His fleshy body was rapidly recovering.

Finished transcending the nirvanic tribulation, Ye Yuan felt lingering fear too.

“No wonder no one dared to cultivate the perfect Nine Transformations Golden Body. This rank eight nirvanic tribulation isn’t some nirvanic tribulation, but a certain-death tribulation. My chaos world is so powerful and I was still in such perilous danger. If it were others, they would have long died ten times over!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

But the more dangerous, the greater the benefits obtained naturally.

Currently, Ye Yuan’s fleshy body obtaining the blessing of Heavenly Emperor could forcefully contend with heavenly emperor spirit treasures.

His casual punch could blow up a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!

... ...

The fog gathered by heaven and earth spiritual energy finally scattered away, revealing Ye Yuan’s figure.

“Turns out that it’s a First Firmament Heavenly Emperor little baby! Punk, you’re deliberately causing trouble, right?”

“Impudent brat, if you don’t give this emperor an explanation today, this emperor will definitely make you regret being born in this world!”

“Punk, you simply incur the wrath of gods and men when you do things! Do you know that you’ve already offended all of the Heavenly Emperors on the mountain?”

... ...

The moment Ye Yuan appeared, he was drowned by spittles.

A large group of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses surrounded, all scolding with flushed faces, filled with righteous indignation.

Ye Yuan had a blank look, completely unaware of what was going on.

In the crowd, Heavenly Emperor Justbright suddenly rushed in front of Ye Yuan, pointed at Ye Yuan’s node, and said viscously, “Punk, this Heavenly Emperor has remembered you! Just you wait, after going out of the Heavenspan Mountain, this Heavenly Emperor will hunt you down till the end of the world!”

The moment Heavenly Emperor Justbright spoke up, the rest quietened down and used a very pitiful gaze to look at him.

This guy was too tragic!

Finally managed to corroborate the path of Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor supreme realm. In the end, the spiritual energy was directly drained by Ye Yuan, forcefully interrupting his breakthrough.

No idea when would be the next time he found this opportunity.

“Right, kill him! Not killing him, this old man can’t stomach this anger!”

“Kill him!”

“Kill him!”

... ...

Ye Yuan was taken aback and said, “Senior, how did I offend you? There’s no need to be so cruel, right?”

Heavenly Emperor Justbright stomped about in a frenzy and said, “How did you offend me? How did you offend me?! You just offended me!”

Actually, it was not like this mountain full of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses did not struggle before.

When Ye Yuan plundered the spiritual energy, they also attempted to absorb spiritual energy.

But, no matter how high their realm was, they could not win Ye Yuan at all!

Ye Yuan this side was like a vacuum zone, the heaven and earth spiritual energy gathered over here frenziedly.

No matter how hard they worked, it was all useless.

Ye Yuan’s expression was odd. Suddenly, he grinned and said, “Since everyone wants to kill me, then I can’t let you all go out of the Heavenspan Mountain!”

Heavenly Emperor Justbright said with a disdainful look, “Not letting us go out ...”

Bang!

Heavenly Emperor Justbright’s words were said halfway when it abruptly stopped, his face already struck by Ye Yuan’s fist, fresh blood pouring.

Bang!

Bang!

Bang! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

... ...

Ye Yuan’s aura skyrocketed, one punch after another pummeling the group of Heavenly Emperors until they fled helter-skelter, wails of doom filling the lands.

No matter how strong they were, they could not escape Ye Yuan’s violent hands at all.

“Ahh! Why! Why isn’t he restricted by the Heavenspan Mountain and can attack at will?”

“Heavenspan Mountain, open your eyes and smite this guy!”

“Damn it! Damn it! Why doesn’t the Heavenspan Mountain have any reaction at all?”

... ...

The Heavenly Emperors all shouted frantically, but the Heavenspan Mountain still did not have the slightest bit of activity.

Before long, the strongest group of people in this world fell to the ground.

They did not dare to fight back and could only get beaten.

Ye Yuan did not kill but beat until they cried for their father and mother.

Eighth transformation perfect golden body was no joke!

Ye Yuan grabbed Heavenly Emperor Justbright and smashed a fist on his face again and said, “Still want to kill me?”

“Kill! Blocking one’s breakthrough is akin to killing people’s parents! Kill me today if you have the ability! Otherwise, this Heavenly Emperor will definitely hunt you down to the ends of the world!”

Bang!

“Still killing or not?”

“Killing!”

Bang!

“Still killing or not?”

“Not killing anymore! Not killing anymore! You ... Stop hitting me!”

Ye Yuan let go of Heavenly Emperor Justbright and said with a sigh, “Wouldn’t there be no need to suffer so much physical hardship if you say it earlier? Swear a Heavenly Dao Oath then!”

Heavenly Emperor Justbright had an appearance like his parents had died. Under Ye Yuan’s despotic power, he swore a Heavenly Dao Oath.

Ye Yuan did not kill. He only beat these guys until they were in pain, and then forced them to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath one by one.

After everything was settled, Ye Yuan finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Being hunted down by the mountain full of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses was not a fun thing.

After he finished forcing everyone to swear the Heavenly Dao Oath, Ye Yuan arrived before Heavenly Emperor Justbright and patted his shoulder.

Heavenly Emperor Justbright jumped in fright and said with a mournful face, “I ... I already swore the Heavenly Dao Oath!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Elder Brother, today’s matter was my fault. In order to compensate you, this Ye can refine a Nine Refinements Cloudheaven Pill for you free!”
