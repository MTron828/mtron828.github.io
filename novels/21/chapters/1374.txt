1378 That Masochist in the First Level

Wu Meng Capital City already did not have Divine Lord Realm powerhouses appearing for over 100 thousand years.

Qin Tian was the one with the greatest likelihood.

“No wonder someone as proud as Qin Shao would be so respectful toward this big brother too!”

In Ye Yuan’s impression, Qin Shao was a very prideful person.

Such a person, even if that person was his big brother, he absolutely would not behave so humbly too.

It turned out that Qin Tian actually had such high status in Wu Meng Capital City.

“Why, you saw Qin Tian? Quickly tell me, he’s my idol!” Xie Jingyi said excitedly.

Qin Tian was not just Xie Jingyi’s idol, he was also Wu Meng Capital City’s countless young talents’ idol!

Ye Yuan said with a cold smile, “I’ve seen him, but this encounter wasn’t pleasant.”

Xie Jingyi’s expression changed, and he said, “No way, right? How did you provoke Qin Tian?”

Ye Yuan said helplessly, “Not that I provoked him, it was him who provoked me.”

He recounted the situation of meeting Qin Tian today as well as the incident of slapping Qin Peiyu back then. Xie Jingyi’s expression became increasingly uglier.

He let out a long sigh and said, “Oh you, you were also too eager! I know that lass. She’s Qin Tian’s biological sister. In Wu Meng Capital City, no one dares to provoke, so what did you provoke her for?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan said with a cold smile, “Why? Are you regretting walking together with me now? You can still make it if you draw a clear line with me right now.”

The moment Xie Jingyi heard these words, he immediately jumped out and shouted, “Ye Yuan, what do you take me, Xie Jingyi, as? I, Xie Jingyi, am a person who repays debts of gratitude! You’re my brother, so your enemy is my enemy! Starting from today, I, Xie Jingyi, am irreconcilable with the Qin Family!”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said smilingly, “Huhu, cracking a joke, so agitated for what? It hasn’t reached the point of a life-and-death struggle!”

Only seeing Ye Yuan like so did Xie Jingyi’s expression become a little better. He said unhappily, “Although I, Xie Jingyi, am somewhat not serious, I never make this kind of joke!”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Haha, got it. I was wrong, okay? But you have got to work hard on cultivating too. Jia Chong isn’t to be trifled with. If you don’t have some capability, you’ll be screwed very badly by him in the future!”

The moment this ‘joke’ was made, the atmosphere appeared rather awkward.

The two people chatted for a while more, and Xie Jingyi took his leave.

“You did it on purpose?” The moment Xie Jingyi left, Dustless’s voice sounded out.

“Mn, I understand too little about him and don’t have a life-and-death relationship. Placing such a person by my side is equivalent to installing a ticking time bomb.” Ye Yuan admitted it very shamelessly.

Although he helped Xie Jingyi before, his relationship with Xie Jingyi was very shallow.

During the test, he only felt that this little fatty was rather interesting and also very kind-looking, that was why he would make a move to help.

As for very deep friendship, there wasn’t any in Ye Yuan’s heart.

In his previous life, Ji Canglan’s betrayal made Ye Yuan especially careful when making friends.

Unless it was like Luo Jian, with a life-and-death relationship with Ye Yuan, then he would lay his heart bare to the other party.

Since Xie Jingyi expressed good feelings toward the Qin Family, Ye Yuan naturally did not dare to put a time bomb by his side.

“Mn, we may know a man’s exterior, but not his heart! You doing so is not wrong either!” Dustless said.

...

Half a month later, Ye Yuan showed up in the Sword Tomb once more.

What surprised him was that Qin Shao still came.

Ye Yuan lightly swept him a glance and directly entered the Sword Tomb.

Qin Tian’s attitude already ascertained that he and Qin Shao could only be enemies!

In the Sword Tomb’s first level, Ye Yuan continued his masochistic cultivation.

Qin Shao’s brows furrowed slightly. After looking for a while, he entered too.

This time, Qin Shao’s strength was clearly more than a level stronger than the last time!

Facing the all-pervasive Sword Dao laws, Qin Shao dealt with them much easier.

For 30 days’ time, he held on effortlessly.

On the contrary, Ye Yuan was covered all over with wounds and scars by Sword Dao laws once again.

When Ye Yuan returned this time, Little Fatty Xie Jingyi indeed did not come over to see him.

Regarding this, Ye Yuan just dismissed it with a smile.

Ever since then, inside the Sword Tomb’s first level, there was an additional masochistic lunatic.

Every time he came out of the Sword Tomb, he was dripping with fresh blood.

In a blink, a year’s time almost passed,

During this time, a major incident happened in the Sword Tomb!

“Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian cleared the 11th level! My God! How many years has it been since someone cleared the 11th level in the Wu Meng Academy?”

“The last one to clear the 11th level is still Senior Zhuang Hao, right? Heh, he was the previous powerhouse who broke through to the Divine Lord Realm!”

“Looks like Senior Apprentice Brother Qin Tian breaking through to the Divine Lord Realm is a sure bet!”

“Yeah, the things that happened for so many years, not one did not foreshadow that he’s going to step into the Divine Lord Realm!”

...

At this time, the lobby outside the Sword Tomb was already packed with people.

From the lobby’s light screen, they could clearly see everything that happened in the Sword Tomb.

Ye Yuan did not have an accurate understanding of the Sword Tomb’s 11th level. Those able to make it to the 11th level were all geniuses among geniuses!

After Qin Tian, there was a large batch of people at the 10th level.

But the 11th level only had three people!

Now, Qin Tian made it past the 11th level and entered the 12th level. He already shook the rest far behind him!

More importantly, it had already been 100 thousand years since anyone cleared the 11th level!

Zhuang Hao’s final result was the 13th level. Qin Tian was already very close to this level.

At this instant, Qin Tian became the god in everyone’s hearts and eyes.

“Eh, Zhao Qin, who’s that kid, so pitiful!”

Suddenly, someone noticed the Ye Yuan who was currently getting abused in the first level and asked Zhao Qin.

Zhao Qin gave a look. Discovering that it was Ye Yuan, his face revealed a disdainful smile and said, “Him? Just a fool! Already soaked in the first level for a year. Each time he comes, he’s abused brutally, without any improvement at all. This season’s top dog, Qin Shao, who came in together with him, had long entered the second level half a year ago.”

“Dear me, this is also too wretched! Being hit by so much sword energy and actually still not dead, it’s also considered a kind of ability,” said the person.

Zhao Qin smiled and said, “Haha, true! I suspect that he’s training a masochistic skill. This guy, it’s really not easy if you want to kill him!”

Zhao Qin’s words made everyone roar with laughter.

Suddenly, someone gave a shout, “Eh, you guys, look! What is that kid doing?”

Everyone looked and discovered that Ye Yuan actually sat down, and casually pulled up a sword that was buried straight in the ground, muttering something under his breath.

This scene made everyone in the lobby quieten down, their eyes showing disbelief.

“He ... How did he do it?”

“Why ... Why didn’t those swords react?”

“Is my eyesight failing? There’s actually someone who touched a sword and can still stand there safe and sound?”

...

At the Sword Tomb’s first level, Ye Yuan lightly caressed the sword. He said with vicissitudes of emotion, “I know that you all have unwillingness in your hearts, and that’s why you would bury your swords here. You all rest assured. I, Ye Yuan, will bring your thoughts and seek the Great Dao!”
