Chapter 1911: Rong Xiyue

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bringing along the divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill, Yu Changyun left perfectly feeling content.

Ye Yuan was able to refine vast spirit divine pills. But toward the City Lord Manor, he naturally would not go all out.

However, purple spirit divine pills were already adequate.

Forget about Nine Pledge Imperial Capital, even in great imperial capitals, one also could not find more than a few alchemists that could refine divine-grade level nine medicinal pills.

Of course, the City Lord Manor also paid a dear price for this.

Yu Changyun’s front foot had just left when the Flowing Wind Establishment’s head, Li Zian, brought a group of people to Heavenly Eagle.

They naturally came over to request for pills too.

Ye Yuan’s impression of Kongming Academy was not good, but he would not let go of the chance to demand an exorbitant price too.

What the present Southridge Ten Cities lack the most was cultivation resources and spirit medicines.

Ye Yuan could not possibly keep staying in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to protect these people. Since that was the case, then let those people around him become stronger, then there naturally would not be people who dared to bully them anymore.

As if it had been discussed, after sending away Li Zian, Linghua Pavilion’s people also arrived.

But, different from the other two, only one person came from Linghua Pavilion.

This person was Rong Xiyue. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When this delicate beauty that no one could help loving upon seeing her stood in front of Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan actually had a feeling of his breath being taken away.

“W-What a beautiful girl!” The eyeballs of the Ning Tianping beside Ye Yuan were almost popping out.

Rong Xiyue smiled faintly and bowed toward Ye Yuan.

“Sinner Rong Xiyue pays respect to Lord Patrolling Inspector!”

This smile gladdened the heart and refreshed the mind all the more so. Ning Tianping was at the peak of vigor and vitality and was practically about to turn soft.

Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile, “What sin is there?”

Rong Xiyue was slightly surprised in her heart, only then did she know that she underestimated Ye Yuan.

A woman’s looks were absolutely a major killing tool to men.

Rong Xiyue had always been extremely confident in her own looks. Her every twinkle and smile was sufficient to make any men lose their minds.

When Wu Tian saw Rong Xiyue, his entire person floated to the heavens, leaving him at her mercy.

But Ye Yuan was actually only surprised for a bit and returned to normal very quickly.

“Rong Xiyue instigated Wu Tian to deal with Heavenly Eagle and almost caused a catastrophe.” Rong Xiyue’s aggrieved appearance was really pitiful to look at.

Ye Yuan was also secretly shocked in his heart, this woman’s seduction art was really too formidable.

If not for the Soul Suppressing Pearl, even if he wanted to recover clarity, it was absolutely impossible to be this fast too.

This kind of enchantment art was extremely brilliant. Ye Yuan could not see the slightest trace of enchantment art from Rong Xiyue’s body.

No coquetry, no flirtation, yet she gave you a feeling of immortal qi fluttering just by standing there, akin to a fairy maiden that had transcended the mundane world.

Otherwise, it would not be possible for Ning Tianping to succumb so easily. He had trained for a long time with Ye Yuan, so his state of mind was already exceptional a long time ago. However, it was not enough.

Seeing Rong Xiyue, Ye Yuan understood what happened to Wu Tian very quickly.

“Almost caused a catastrophe? Rong Xiyue, don’t tell me that Jiang Jadehall’s matter isn’t related to you!” Ye Yuan sneered, his expression becoming sharp.

But Rong Xiyue kept her countenance and said in puzzlement, “Xiyue doesn’t understand.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You don’t think that I wouldn’t ruthlessly destroy a flower because your looks are as beautiful as a fairy, right? Your seduction art is very brilliant, but it still falls short of the standard to deal with me!”

Clank!

Ye Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when the Frostcounter Sword suddenly left its sheathe, the target was precisely Rong Xiyue.

Ning Tianping had not come back to his senses yet and cried out in surprise, “Your Excellency, what do you want to do?”

Rong Xiyue’s expression suddenly changed and wanted to evade this sword. But she discovered that she had nowhere to run at all.

This sword was too swift and fierce!

Rong Xiyue’s talent was exceedingly high, but she was merely a Seventh Firmament Celestial Deity. It was simply impossible to be Ye Yuan’s match.

In the next moment, Ye Yuan’s sword already pressed on her throat.

“Your Excellency, don’t!” Ning Tianping shouted.

Clearly, he had already thoroughly succumbed.

But right at this time, a surge of mysterious power tunneled into his mind.

Ning Tianping’s entire body trembled, his eyes finally recovering clarity.

“This ... What happened to me just now?”

Seeing this scene, Rong Xiyue’s pupils constricted. She finally knew that she ran into an expert.

Ye Yuan’s attainment in the area of divine soul was simply terrifying.

Sensing the cold air exuding from the tip of the sword, Rong Xiyue felt that the god of death was beckoning to her.

“I don’t care what your Linghua Pavilion is planning at the back, but you guys shouldn’t have provoked me. Since you provoked me, then you have to be prepared to have the awareness overthrown!”

Rong Xiyue’s complexion was white as a sheet. No longer harboring any hopes of getting lucky in her heart, she appeared slightly nervous as she said, “Lord Patrolling Inspector, pardon my offense. Xiyue ... Xiyue just wanted to make use of Yu Jinsong to swallow up Kongming Academy’s territory together with the City Lord Manor. But I didn’t expect that he did such an inhumane and evil thing.”

Ye Yuan looked at her and said coldly, “If it was you manipulating it at the back, you’d long be dead now!”

Yu Jinsong coveted Rong Xiyue, this was definite.

But Ye Yuan could tell that Yu Jinsong did not fall for Rong Xiyue’s seduction art, or should he say that he was not controlled by Rong Xiyue.

The struggle of the three great factions, Jiang Jadehall being framed, even though Ye Yuan was unhappy about it, he actually understood.

But Jiang Haitang’s matter made Ye Yuan’s incredibly enraged.

Hence, no matter what, Yu Jinsong would not have a good outcome.

Even if Yu Wenfeng did not send him over, Ye Yuan would definitely demand an answer in the future too.

Rong Xiyue’s complexion was pale as she said fearfully, “Xiyue knows her mistake, Your Excellency can punish as you will.”

Everything that happened before her eyes were totally different from what she imagined previously.

No matter how formidable Ye Yuan was, he was also merely a Celestial Deity Realm martial artist. She thought that she could rely on her enchantment art to escape a calamity or even ask for medicinal pills.

She would not be foolish to the point she would cast a spell on Ye Yuan. But affecting Ye Yuan’s decision through her profound enchantment art was still doable.

Just like when she dealt with Yu Jinsong back then.

But now, she discovered that she was ridiculously wrong.

Just a bit more and her life would be gone.

Rong Xiyue already did not have any thoughts of getting lucky and could only resign herself to fate.

Ye Yuan put away the sword, returned to his seat, and said in a cold voice, “You’re also here to ask for pills, right?”

Rong Xiyue’s expression changed and she said in a low voice, “Your Excellency is wise!”

Ye Yuan said, “Not that you can’t request for pills, but your compensation will be five times of the other two factions!”

Rong Xiyue was startled and was just about to speak, but then she heard Ye Yuan say in a cold voice, “Don’t talk nonsense with me! There are no conditions to discuss! Not agreeing, please go back! In the future, my Southridge also won’t do any more business with your Linghua Pavilion.”

When Rong Xiyue heard that, she bit her lip lightly and performed a salute to Ye Yuan as she said in a light voice, “Ye Yuan, this lowly woman can’t make the decision. Can you allow this lowly woman to consult the Pavilion Lord’s opinion?”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said coolly, “Go on, behave yourself. Otherwise, you know the consequences!”

Rong Xiyue’s enchantment was too powerful, not giving her a bit of warning, she might be able to make quite a few people lose their minds.

After Rong Xiyue left, Ning Tianping felt lingering fear as he said, “Your Excellency, this ... this woman is so formidable!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Her enchantment art is natural born. There’s not the slightest flaw at all. Her divine soul is also much more powerful than martial artists of the same rank, very hard to deal with!”
