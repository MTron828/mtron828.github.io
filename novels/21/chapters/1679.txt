Chapter 1683 Bullying to the Doorstep

Ye Yuan entered the city very low-profiled, without drawing anyone’s attention. He came straight to Zheng Qi’s residence.

“Who is it, halt! Mn? You ... You’re Elder Ye Yuan!” The guard’s gaze turned intent, recognizing Ye Yuan.

“Oh? You know me?” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

The guard smiled and said, “Elder Ye must be joking. In this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, who doesn’t know you!”

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “In this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, everyone knows that I’m a good-for-nothing!”

The guard’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “Elder Ye, no matter what others say, our Zheng Manor from top to bottom, not a single person dares to be disrespectful toward you, including this lowly one! Head Elder had once said that his life was saved by you. If anybody dares to speak impertinently about you, if minor, they will be chased out of the Zheng Manor. If severe, directly flogged to death!”

Ye Yuan did not expect that Zheng Qi actually used this kind of method to block everyone’s mouth. But the emphasis on loyalty and friendship could be seen as well.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “How is Head Elder’s body?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The guard let out a sigh when he heard that and said, “Sigh, Head Elder’s body is getting worse each day. Head Elder Xuan Yu tried everything. But he is also unable to salvage the situation. Right now, Head Elder is already unable to get out of bed.”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “What’s going on?”

Before Ye Yuan left, he specially checked Zheng Qi’s body before. It was not to the extent of not being able to get out of bed so quickly.

Listening to the guard talk about the sequence of events, the rage in Ye Yuan’s heart started blazing fiercely.

It turned out that after a Celestial Deity powerhouse of Utmost Peace Imperial City came out of seclusion and got to know the news of Gao Yuan’s demise, he came to visit.

That Celestial Deity powerhouse came to find trouble with Ye Yuan and Zheng Qi two people.

Who knew that only after reaching the city did he know that Ye Yuan already left Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

A Celestial Deity powerhouse arriving in person, this kind of thing naturally could not be brushed off lightly.

Utmost Peace Imperial City’s strength was much stronger than Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. They had four Celestial Deity powerhouses, while Heavenly Eagle Imperial City only had two.

After that Celestial Deity powerhouse came, he asked Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to sentence Ye Yuan to death with a domineering attitude and to hand over the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain.

Additionally, he even wanted Gao Yuan’s disciple to challenge Zheng Qi, saying that it was to take revenge for his master.

This situation followed the same pattern as Zheng Qi back then.

It was just that Gao Yuan this person was insidious and cunning, schemed to harm fellow daoists. It was beneath contempt.

Now, this move was purely nonsensical.

How could Zheng Qi’s physical condition at that time be able to withstand a great battle?

However, Zheng Qi argued strongly on his point of view back then, saying that the Fiend Calling Ridge battle, killing Gao Yuan was his doing alone, and had nothing to do with Ye Yuan!

Moreover, he accepted the challenge.

And the result of the challenge naturally went without saying.

Zheng Qi was beaten to serious injuries by Gao Yuan’s pupil. Right now, he was only left with half a life.

Ye Yuan burned with rage when he heard this. The aura of Divine Vortex Realm unconsciously exuded out as he said in a cold voice, “What take revenge? It’s simply aiming for the Origin Magnetic Divine Mountain, right?!”

That guard was merely Origin Deity Realm. Suddenly seeing the powerful pressure than Ye Yuan released, it crushed him until his face turned pale.

The guard was shocked inwardly, only now realizing in shock that Ye Yuan seemed to no longer be at the Origin Deity Realm anymore!

This aura was absolutely Divine Lord Realm!

Elder Ye actually really broke through?

Ye Yuan suddenly realized the guard’s awkward state, restrained the aura on his body, and said coolly, “You go and notify them, just say that I’m back.”

The guard hurriedly said, “Elder Ye must be joking. Head Elder is at the courtyard. Head Elder Xuan Yu and Head Elder Coldfeather are both there, please!”

Ye Yuan nodded and casually fished out a medicinal pill and threw it to the other party, saying, “Thanks for the hard work, this is for you.”

The guard received the medicinal pill and could not help being wildly ecstatic.

Void mystic divine pill!

Elder Ye’s void mystic divine pill was hard to request for. Now, it was actually bestowed on him.

“Many thanks, Elder Ye!”

...

In a courtyard, Coldfeather and Xuan Yu two people looked at the Zheng Qi lying on the bed, frowning heavily.

Zheng Qi’s aura was weak. Clearly, he was on the verge of dying.

But his face did not have too much regret. On the contrary, he seemed very open-minded.

“Grandmaster, Brother Xuan Yu, you guys don’t have to be like this. Back then, when Master’s great enmity was avenged, my long-cherished wish in this lifetime is also considered fulfilled. Living for these additional few years is already a profit,” Zheng Qi gasped for air as he said, seeming very strained.

Xuan Yu had a look of self-blame as he said, “It’s all this old man who is incapable. If Ye Yuan he can break through to Divine Lord Realm, he can definitely save you! Sigh!”

Upon mentioning Ye Yuan, Coldfeather flared up with anger and said with a cold snort, “That bunch of fools actually said that Wen Yilin was provoked by Ye Yuan! All of them don’t have the capability but still want to push the responsibility onto others, truly the act of a scoundrel to the extreme.”

Xuan Yu sighed and said, “This bunch of guys has always been like this, unable to take on responsibility at all.”

“Huhu, when Ye Yuan breaks through and returns, I’m very much looking forward to how this bunch of people will look like! It’s too bad that ... I can’t see it!” Zheng Qi sighed and said.

To talk about his only regret, that was not being able to see Ye Yuan breakthrough.

Everyone had a score in their hearts, Ye Yuan going out this time probably would not be able to come back within a short time.

The opportunity to break through was not that easy to find.

It was just that they never dreamed that Ye Yuan, an Origin Deity Realm, actually dared to go to the Heavenspan Mountain!

“Who says that you can’t see it? Not only can you see it, but you can also even teach them a lesson one by one!”

Hearing the voice first before seeing the person!

This voice, Xuan Yu three people were too familiar. Indeed, looking outside the door, they saw a young man walk in with large strides. Who was it if not Ye Yuan?

“Ye Yuan, you ... you actually came back so quickly?” Xuan Yu said in pleasant surprise.

But Coldfeather’s expression changed and he said suspiciously, “You ... You broke through?”

Although Ye Yuan’s aura became much stronger, it gave him a feeling of inscrutability, leaving him somewhat uncertain.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not breaking through, how would I dare come back? The feeling of being scolded trash while having my nose pointed doesn’t feel good!”

When the three people heard, they all burst into laughter.

Coldfeather laughed hard and said, “Like I said, how can a mere Divine Lord Realm possibly stump you? That bunch of fools, see what they still have to say this time! I’m really looking forward to their reaction right now!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Let’s make idle talk again later. I’ll take a look at Head Elder Zheng first.”

Zheng Qi was feeble and weak, but seeing that Ye Yuan broke through, he was extremely overjoyed too, his entire person’s state becoming much better.

Ye Yuan investigated Zheng Qi’s physical condition and his brows could not help furrowing as he said with a cold snort, “What an insidious thing!”

Ye Yuan detected that inside Zheng Qi’s body, there was a stream of gentle Yin energy constantly whittling away Zheng Qi’s life force, hastening his death.

Clearly, this was intentional by the other party!

Xuan Yu sighed and said, “Even though that Yang Fan’s talent doesn’t match up to Younger Brother Zheng, his strength indeed can’t be underestimated. This gentle Yin force, this old man expended a Herculean effort and was also unable to purge it. I can only helplessly watch Younger Brother Zheng suffer away.”

Zheng Qi smiled when he heard that and said, “Brother Xuan Yu doesn’t need to blame yourself. This old man knows that you’ve already done your best.”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Brother Zheng’s medicinal pill, originally, I’ve already prepared it. It’s just that I didn’t expect that his situation is actually so serious. You guys wait for a moment, wait for this Ye to go and refine another medicinal pill!”
