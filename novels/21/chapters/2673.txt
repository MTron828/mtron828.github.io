Chapter 2679: What She Said is Correct!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At the left-hand side position, a youth said with a disdainful look, “A mere Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, and he’s even a human! This young master can crush him to death with just one hand! Younger Sister Jingfei, stop joking!”

However, his words to Little Dragon Girl were rather polite.

“Big Brother Ruichen, Jingfei isn’t joking! Big Brother Ye Yuan is really very, very amazing! You’re not his match!”Jingfei said with a sincere look.

That innocent face shattered Ruichen’s self-esteem at once.

Who was he, Ruichen?

He was from the Si Ning Sea Region’s royal clan. His main body was an octopus and his status was noble. His strength was not the slightest bit weaker than the dragon race!

Today, he was actually being looked down upon by a little girl!

He suddenly stood up, walked in front of Ye Yuan, and said with a sneer, “Lowly human, do you dare to accept this young master’s challenge? If you don’t dare, immediately scram back onto land!”

Ye Yuan had a helpless look as he said coolly, “Can I refuse?”

He was naturally not afraid. It was just that he did not want to cause unnecessary trouble.

This young man was clearly that sort of guy who had his eyes growing on top of his head.

There was no need to try and gain back face with him.

But Ruichen clearly had no intention of letting Ye Yuan off and said with a cold smile, “Of course, you can refuse. But you’ll need to crawl under my crotch!”

“Hahaha,?yeah, just go under Ruichen’s crotch and that’s it!”

“Relax, this dragon son will be your guarantor! If he dares to make things difficult for you, this dragon son will be the first to not let him off!”

“Come, crawl!”

… …

Ruichen’s words immediately aroused echoing of the others at the banquet.

Clearly, they all thought that Ye Yuan was scared.

Little Dragon Girl’s words could not be believed at all.

That made sense. This girl rarely spoke any truths.

It was also not impossible to randomly find a human to adjust the atmosphere.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. He did not want to cause trouble, but it did not mean that he was scared of trouble.

“Why? Looking at your appearance, it seems like you’re very unconvinced? Do you really think that just because Younger Sister Jingfei is calling you as her big brother, you really have the qualifications to be on equal footing with this young master? You’re merely a lowly human!” Ruichen said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan grinned and all of a sudden, sword light flashed.

Whoosh!

Ruichen’s expression changed wildly, only to feel an extremely dangerous sensation well up in his heart.

Swoosh!

In virtually an instant, Ruichen returned to his original form and spat out a cloud of black ink.

The entire space suddenly became black.

Then, eight tentacles suddenly emerged from the darkness, wanting to deal with Ye Yuan.

However, Ye Yuan did not care at all, directly deploying the All-Encompassing Sacred Tree’s two streaks of sword light.

“Break for me!”

Ye Yuan shouted coldly. That black space actually directly had a large hole opened up!

Ruichen spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood with a cough, directly being smashed flying out.

His eight tentacles were directly all cut off!

The whole place was deathly silent.

From Ye Yuan attacking to Rui Chen spitting black ink, then to Ye Yuan shattering the space, the whole process was merely one breath of time.

This was also to say that Ruichen did not even last a single breath of time!

Furthermore, Ye Yuan only used one hand from beginning to end!

Ye Yuan looked at the Ruichen lying on the ground and said coolly, “Didn’t you say that you could crush me to death with just one hand? Now, you used eight hands, but I … only used one hand.”

Ruichen lied on the ground, quivering non-stop. Very soon, the tentacles that were chopped off actually grew back again, and he recovered to his human form.

However, he looked at Ye Yuan with a fearful look and said, “P-Punk, you sneak attacked me just now!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said,?“Oh,?it was a sneak attack? Alright, let’s have an upright and aboveboard battle then. The loser will crawl under the other party’s crotch, how about it?”

Ruichen’s expression changed wildly and he actually did not dare to play along.

He was only being stubborn just now. Just based on that sword earlier, Ye Yuan’s strength was god knows how many times stronger than him!

His darkness ink was his ultimate trump card, but it was broken by Ye Yuan in a single breath.

How large the gap between the two could be seen!

“This human punk is actually a transformation powerhouse!”

“Ruichen actually couldn’t last a single move under his hands!”

“With this, Ruichen’s face is utterly lost! He actually lost to a human!”

… …

It was only at this time did those young powerhouses come back to their senses. Each and every one of them was extremely amazed.

They discovered that this human boy was really very strong!

Even a hint of surprise flashed across in Black Flood Dragon King’s eyes too.

How could he not know what Little Dragon Girl was thinking? But he did not stop it.

He really wanted to see just how strong this human who stopped the sea war was.

Sure enough, Ye Yuan did not disappoint him!

Ye Yuan’s strength far surpassed those in the same rank! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Furthermore, he clearly saw it just now. There were eight leaves on Ye Yuan’s Great Dao Transformation sapling.

But Ye Yuan only used two!

This showed that Ye Yuan still had a lot of strength to spare!

This boy was remarkable!

Ye Yuan’s gaze swept over everyone’s faces and he said coolly, “Refusing earlier wasn’t because I was scared, but that I couldn’t be bothered to stoop to his level. Just now, Jingfei said that I’m stronger than you all, but you guys didn’t seem to be convinced. Since I’ve already taken action, this Ye doesn’t mind telling you all this; what she said is completely right! With all due respect, everyone here … is all trash!”

The moment these words came out, the faces of the young powerhouses present were full of indignation.

This boy actually dared to slight all of them!

“Ha, what high-sounding sentiments! Do you think that having defeating Ruichen, you have the qualifications to be cocky here?”

“Boy, don’t be arrogant!”

“Big Brother Muchen, this punk has scolded even you. Could it be that you can tolerate it?”

… …

Ye Yuan making a move earlier already shocked the vast majority of the people.

They naturally did not dare to challenge Ye Yuan, but it did not mean that everyone was scared of Ye Yuan.

Among these people, there were some whose strength already reached middle Limitless Sublime Heaven.

Furthermore, there were a few among them whose bloodline power was extremely strong and did not fear Ye Yuan at all.

At this time, that person called Muchen finally stepped forward.

“Boy, do you think that only you alone comprehended Great Dao Transformation? My sea race territory isn’t the place where it is your turn, a human’s turn, to come and act wildly yet! This dragon son will challenge you right now!” Muchen said with a cold smile.

Muchen possessed the dragon race bloodline too, but he belonged to the coiling dragon clan.

His strength was considered to be top-notch among this large group of people.

To dare say this, Muchen was clearly a powerhouse who comprehended Great Dao Transformation too.

However, what did Ye Yuan have to fear?

“Oh??Whether it’s my turn or not, it’s not said using the mouth!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Ye Yuan pointed his fingers, two transformed swords turned into two rays of flowing light, stabbing straight for Muchen.

Muchen snorted coldly, an additional chain appeared in his hands.

This chain emitted an aura that made people feel heart palpitations. It was actually transformed out of lightning!

Lightning chain!

Muchen shook the lightning chain gently, directly shaking Ye Yuan’s two flying swords away.

His cultivation realm was far higher than Ye Yuan and he was a transformation powerhouse too. Wanting to block the two flying swords was naturally a cinch.

Following that, he swept his chain, and it actually wrapped over toward Ye Yuan..
