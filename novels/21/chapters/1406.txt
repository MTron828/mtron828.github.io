Chapter 1410 Sky Foothill World

“Alright then. There are five jade pillars over there, representing the difficulty of the missions from low to high. You can go and check it out yourself. After examining them, come to me to register will do.”

That inner-court student saw that Ye Yuan’s attitude was firm and could only agree.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother.”

On one side of the Merit Hall’s great hall, five jade pillars were placed from low to high.

Ye Yuan arrived in front of the jade pillars and poured divine essence into the first jade pillar.

The jade pillar immediately erupted with rays of brilliant light. A whole bunch of information entered Ye Yuan’s mind.

Breath Rain World, Divine Lord Rank Small World.

Highest level powerhouse: Grotto Profound Deity Realm.

Dangerous places: Western Fame Valley, Heavenly Melody Mountain.

Basic missions: Black Yun Metal, Splendid Flora Fruit. Difficulty – one star. Completing a mission one could obtain 800 points.

Advanced missions: Divine lord profound treasure left behind by Breath Rain Divine Lord. Difficulty – two stars. Completing a mission one could obtain 1500 points.

...

On it was a detailed description of the Breath Rain World, including the local customs, topography, and so on; very detailed.

Information after information filtered through in Ye Yuan’s mind very quickly. Ye Yuan discovered that the information on the one-star jade pillar was actually not that hard.

With his current strength, he could at least protect himself.

The strongest powerhouses in these worlds were mostly just Grotto Profound Realm. Ye Yuan’s strength could virtually sweep across.

Of course, only he, this Grotto Profound martial artists, dared to say sweep across, this kind of words.

The Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone was a very rarely-seen natural treasure. It would not appear in every small world.

But if someone discovered Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones in a small world, it would definitely be listed as one of the missions.

It was just too bad that the one-star jade pillar did not have news about Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones.

Hence, Ye Yuan came to the two-star jade pillar to check.

The worlds recorded on the two-star jade pillar was clearly much more dangerous than on the one-star jade pillar. Quite a number of worlds’ highest level powerhouses were all Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm.

Of course, the danger level was not just according to the highest level powerhouse. Each small world’s situation was different, the situation very complicated.

Some people training succumbed inside without even figuring out the situation.

Ye Yuan skimmed over the two-star jade pillar and still did not find news about the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone. His heart could not help sinking.

He was not afraid of danger. What he feared was not being able to find the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone.

As long as there was news about Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stones, even if it was a dragon’s lair or tiger’s den, he would also brave it.

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and started investigating the information on the three-star jade pillar.

He secretly praised, on this three-star jade pillar, there must be information about the Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone!

Suddenly, his eyes lit up. Information entered his eyes.

Sky Foothill World: Celestial Deity Rank Small World.

Highest level powerhouse: Origin Deity Realm.

Dangerous places: Unclear.

Basic missions: Myriad Longevity Heavenly Soul Stone, Nine Melody Psychic Immortal Fruit, Purple Sand Gold, difficulty – three stars. Completing a mission one could obtain 100 thousand points!

Advanced missions: Celestial Deity Dao Fruit, difficulty – four stars. Completing a mission one could obtain 300 thousand points!

...

That was it!

Without the slightest hesitation, Ye Yuan found that inner-court student.

“Senior Apprentice Brother, I want to choose the number eight mission on the three-star jade pillar!” Ye Yuan said.

That student was stupefied, somewhat doubting if his ears heard wrongly or not.

“Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, this is a three-star mission. Are you mistaken?”

This three-star mission, as long one of the missions was completed, one could get 100 thousand points. The difficulty and level of danger could be seen.

It was on a completely different level than the one-star and two-star missions previously.

Ye Yuan was merely a Grotto Profound Realm martial artist. Wanting to challenge such a high difficulty mission as soon as he came up, his astonishment could be imagined.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “That’s right, this is it. I’ll have to trouble Senior Apprentice Brother to give me the coordinates of the Sky Foothill World.”

“Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, it’s your first time taking part in a training mission, you might not know the difficulty of three-star missions! This number eight mission, over 5000 students have done it in the past. The majority of them were all middle-stage, Heaven Glimpse, late-stage, even grand completion powerhouses. But the ones who came back in the end were less than 10%! Among the 10%, those able to complete the mission were even fewer!”

That student was warmhearted too, worried that Ye Yuan did not know the danger and urged earnestly with good intentions.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother, for cautioning. I’ll be careful.”

That student opened his mouth but did not say anything.

This Junior Apprentice Brother Ye never seemed to do things according to the convention.

Missions that other people avoided like the plague, he was eager to go.

More importantly, Ye Yuan was too weak currently!

Even if Ye Yuan’s strength was superior, far surpassing same-rank martial artists, his realm was too low after all.

He did not even enter the inner-court and want to challenge a three-star mission. Wasn’t this somewhat overestimating his own ability?

“Alright, since Junior Apprentice Brother Ye insists on going, then you’ll have to be more careful. Entering a small world to train, the most important thing is to protect yourself. Missions and whatnot are second.” That student reminded him again.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That is, of course. I don’t wish to court death too.”

That student nodded and said, “The number eight mission’s information is already stored in your academy token. You can go back and study it well. But you have to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath right now, to absolutely not reveal the mission’s information for others to know.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head slightly, swearing a Heavenly Dao Oath on the spot.

Each small world was a treasure trove and also a precious resource of Wu Meng Capital City. They naturally did not allow it to be leaked out.

Watching Ye Yuan leave, that student’s face revealed a puzzled look and muttered, “This Junior Apprentice Brother Ye really exceeds all expectations. It’s just that this three-star mission is a little too dangerous. He’s my Wu Meng Academy’s future, hope that he’ll be fine.”

Right at this time, another figure walked in.

That student’s expression changed and he hurriedly saluted and said, “I pay respects to Elder Qin!”

He was secretly alarmed. Elder Qin Tianning was one of the few existences whose status was second only to the academy head. Normally, he was in closed-seclusion and rarely appeared.

Why did he suddenly show up today, and even came to the Merit Hall?

He suddenly thought of the Ye Yuan who just left and could not help becoming fearful in his heart.

Elder Qin wouldn’t be here aiming for Ye Yuan, right? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qin Tianning snorted lightly, considered to have acknowledged it, and said coolly, “What mission did Ye Yuan draw just now?”

That student’s expression changed and he said awkwardly, “Elder Qin, this ... The missions that students draw are strictly confidential. This ... isn’t complying with the rules!”

Qin Tianning’s brows furrowed and he said with a cold snort, “This old man is an Elder Association’s member. Is it confidential even from me? If you don’t wish to stay in the academy, just say it straight. This old man will send you out tomorrow!”

That student’s expression changed and he said fearfully, “Elder Qin is mis-mistaken! The mission that Ye Yuan drew was ... was the number eight mission on the three-star jade pillar, the coordinates are ...”

Qin Tianning nodded slightly and said, “Mn, that’s more like it! You don’t think too much. This matter ... was personally ordered by City Lord, His Excellency. If you let a third person know, the consequences ... you know it!”
