Chapter 1512 Fiend Lord Mystic Treasure!

In front of Heavenstar, Ye Yuan’s expression was weary, his complexion pale, looking like he had a serious illness.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s state, he was very satisfied.

Of course, he was also not much better than Ye Yuan.

He was almost squeezed dry by Dustless and Gui Yun two people these few days.

Although Heavenstar’s soul force was strong, it could not withstand the Soul Suppressing Pearl, this grade of empyrean spirit treasure’s extraction.

“Senior Heavenstar, the matter that you said a few days ago, I’ve considered it. I’ve decided to join the Blood Yama Hall!” Ye Yuan said.

“Haha, he who understands the times is a wise man! Younger Brother Source Night, your future accomplishments are unimaginable. Joining our Blood Yama Hall is absolutely a correct choice! This trip, I’ll enter the mystic realm together with you all. After you come out from the mystic realm, I’ll bring you straight to the imperial city!” Heavenstar said with a laugh.

“Senior, arrange as you wish.”

The current Ye Yuan seemingly lost all of his edge, becoming very docile.

Just putting on an act doesn’t take a great effort anyway.

As long as you are happy.

Heavenstar only represented Eminent Orchid Blood Yama Hall’s hall master to come and subdue Ye Yuan. He really did not dare to offend too much.

Ye Yuan was bound to be an existence lording over him in the future.

Offending now, it would be hard to avoid squaring of accounts after the autumn harvest.

On the contrary, he even had to think of ways to dispel the unhappiness in Ye Yuan’s heart for a period of time in the days to come.

Otherwise, if Ye Yuan stacked the deck against him in the future, that would be bad.

Besides, establishing a relationship with such a genius had tremendous help to him too.

Therefore, that was why he would call Ye Yuan as his younger brother again and again, sounding very cordial.

“Haha, Younger Brother Source Night, really sorry about it. It’s truly that the hall master loves talent. But we also know that you won’t give in obediently, that’s why we would come up with this plan. You rest assured, as long as you join the Blood Yama Hall, the incidents these few days absolutely won’t happen again.” Heavenstar’s words carried an ingratiating intent.

But Ye Yuan did not appreciate it at all and said with a displeased look, “Senior is too kind, Source Night dares not!”

Said he dare not, but that expression was an unhappy face.

Heavenstar secretly cursed and said with a laugh, “Oh, Younger Brother, don’t have this expression! This medicinal cauldron, Elder Brother, I, have used for ten thousand years. You shouldn’t have a convenient medicinal cauldron currently yet, right? Elder Brother will give it to you!”

A tiny little medicinal cauldron appeared on Heavenstar’s palm, then rapidly enlarged, and landed on the ground.

An incomparably profound aura filled the room.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent and he said in surprise, “Could this be ... a fiend lord mystic treasure?”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Heavenstar finally let out a sigh in relief.

As expected, to Fiend Apothecaries, a medicinal cauldron was an irresistible temptation! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gifting away a fiend lord mystic treasure was also a massive hemorrhage to Heavenstar.

Mystic treasures were higher-order existences than celestial deity divine artifacts!

Those suitable for Divine Lord Realm martial artists to use were divine lord mystic treasures.

Those suitable for Celestial Deity Realm martial artists to use were called celestial deity mystic treasures, so on and so forth.

It was just that, the human race called it divine lord mystic treasure, and the fiend race called it fiend lord mystic treasure.

The naming was different, but the function was largely the same.

It was just that the fiend race’s fiend lord mystic treasures were a little more suitable for the fiend race.

The technique for forging a mystic treasure was extremely complicated. A Four-star Artifact God might not be able to craft a fiend lord mystic treasure even by spending several thousand years.

Hence, each fiend lord mystic treasure was incomparably precious.

To a martial artist, a mystic treasure was a tremendous allure.

Not every Divine Lord Realm martial artist could own a divine lord mystic treasure.

Such as Yi Han, Mo Han, these hall masters, even though they were Fiend Lord powerhouses, they did not have fiend lord mystic treasures in their hands at all.

When the Yi Han by the side saw this scene, she made no effort to conceal her envy at all.

Her eyeballs almost popped out.

She had already become a Fiend Lord powerhouse for 20 thousand years but did not even have a single fiend lord mystic treasure.

Ye Yuan was great, a puny little Fiend General actually had a fiend lord mystic treasure.

Lord Heavenstar really made a big move!

“Huhu, Younger Brother Source Night indeed has good eyesight! It’s called Profound Yellow Cauldron, a low-grade fiend lord mystic treasure. It has already followed me for 50 thousand years, today ... I’ll give it to Younger Brother. Just take it as making an apology!” Heavenstar looked very generous as he said this.

Luckily, Hall Master promised that as long as I bring Source Night back, he’ll award me a middle-grade fiend lord mystic treasure. Otherwise, I’d really can’t bear to give the Profound Yellow Cauldron to people with both hands just like this. Heavenstar secretly thought.

Even so, for Heavenstar to be able to gift the Profound Yellow Cauldron to Ye Yuan, he had made a huge resolve too.

Who would mind having too many mystic treasures?

Ye Yuan was also greatly surprised in his heart, not expecting that he would have such a harvest.

This Heavenstar was really a wealthy person. He had already expended soul force to gift Dustless and Gui Yun with breakthroughs.

Now, he actually gave him a fiend lord mystic treasure too!

Tsk tsk, really generous when making his move!

Ye Yuan gave Heavenstar a suspicious glance and said, “Really giving to me?”

Heavenstar smiled and said, “Can this still be fake? How is it? Realised Elder Brother’s sincerity, right? Planting the Blood Soul Curse on you was truly no choice. It’s really that we’re eager and love talents! I’ve already removed the ownership, the Profound Yellow Cauldron is a masterless-item now. You just have to nurture it with fiend soul sanctification and it’s yours!”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said with a nod, “Alright then, since Senior Heavenstar is so sincere, Source Night naturally can’t put on airs anymore. This Profound Yellow Cauldron, I’ll accept it. Our matter is written off!”

The moment Heavenstar heard, he could not help being overjoyed and said with a big laugh, “Haha, Younger Brother is indeed forthright! In the future, when you reach Eminent Orchid Imperial City, whatever things that you can’t settle, feel free to tell me. Elder Brother still has some face in Eminent Orchid Imperial City.”

Ye Yuan smiled as he clasped his hands and said, “Then Source Night will thank Senior first.”

...

Returning to the Fan Family, after Ye Yuan had the Profound Yellow Cauldron acknowledge a master, he tried refining a few medicinal pills. The more he used, the more he liked it.

“Tsk tsk, indeed well-deserving of being a fiend lord mystic treasure, to actually have the effect of strengthening divine fire. Refining pills in the future won’t need to find them to borrow divine fire each time anymore.”

“This pill refining efficiency also increased significantly! Now, when I refine ordinary Two-star divine pills, it only needs less than an hour.”

“Mn? What’s this?”

Ye Yuan discovered that inside the Profound Yellow Cauldron formed its own space. Inside had two wisps of auras circulating erratically. They were very mysterious.

“That’s a wisp of Profound yellow energy!” Dustless said.

“Profound yellow energy?” Ye Yuan was puzzled. Clearly, he had never heard of this name before.

“When Divine Lord Realm opens up a world, it will birth this profound yellow energy! Profound as heaven, yellow as earth. Inside this Profound Yellow Cauldron incorporates a trace of profound yellow energy. Each time you refine pills, it will be equivalent to your Great Dao pill refinement in the past,” Divine Lord Realm explained.

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised. Back then, he refined pills with Great Dao, refining the Dao Defying Pill. That scene was still fresh in his mind.

The might of heaven and earth to refine pills was absolutely extraordinary.

“Indeed worthy of being a fiend lord mystic treasure. This is undoubtedly like adding wings to a tiger to me!” Ye Yuan said, being satisfied.

Dustless laughed loudly and said, “Heavenstar this old punk used all sorts of intrigues and wiles, but gave you wedding dresses everywhere. When he discovers that it’s drawing water with a sieve; all for naught, wonder what kind of expression he’ll have, hahaha ...”
