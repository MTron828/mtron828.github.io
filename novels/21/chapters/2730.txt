Chapter 2736: Unexpected Person!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

All the powerhouses present no longer have their tempers. They all went toward the passageway below in succession.

There was the entrance to the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm.

Saint Exalt Waycloud hesitated for a bit, but still cupped his fists at Big Yellow and said, “I wonder if Fellow Daoist is the Myriad Demons Mountain’s Saint Exalt Bull Demon?”

Big Yellow said coolly, “Nay! This exalt is Saint Exalt Bull Demon’s head commander!”

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s expression changed, his heart being in disarray.

When did Myriad Demons Mountain have one more Saint Exalt?

It seemed like the Five Great Heavenly Regions’ news was somewhat outdated.

Saint Exalt Waycloud hesitated for a bit, but he still said, “Pardon me for being forthright, but your esteemed self is a dignified Saint Exalt, how can you be the mount for a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven? This … This is insulting the majesty of Saint Exalts!”

Big Yellow’s nostrils turned to the sky and he said coolly, “This exalt is happy. Do you have any objections?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud was choked badly enough and could only leave in embarrassment.

Several hundred Jade Sovereign Heavens entered Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm one after another. Only Ye Yuan did not move a muscle.

After everyone left, Ye Yuan arrived at Heavenly Eagle Imperial City with a teleport.

In reality, this place was no longer Heavenly Eagle Imperial City but became the Heavenspan World’s holy land.

The deed of Ye Yuan battling Jun Tian alone and saving the Heavenspan World had already become a legend here.

This place remained the same, but the people were gone!

Ye Yuan’s divine sense swept over and over again and discovered that it was not just Li-er they all who had disappeared.

As long as it was someone who had associated with Ye Yuan before, they had actually all disappeared without a trace now!

What was going on?

In fact, even those people in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, the Jian Family’s people, Ning Family’s people, have all vanished without a trace too!

Ye Yuan suddenly discovered that he seemed to have fallen into a huge conspiracy!

The person who abducted Yue Mengli they all knew too much about him. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The other party understood until they knew his experiences growing up all the way, like the back of their hand!

But he had already turned the nine Dao Ancestors into his vassals before he left.

The nine great Dao Ancestors were already the Heavenspan World’s strongest force. Who was the other party, to actually have such powerful strength?

Could it be that a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse was hidden in this Heavenspan World?

“Friend, I want to meet the nine great Dao Ancestors. Do you know where they are?” Ye Yuan stopped a Deva Fourth Blight powerhouse and asked.

“Dao Ancestor? What’s that?” The other party answered.

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “Then do you know who Ye Yuan is?”

The moment the other person heard, he immediately said with deep veneration, “Ye Yuan is our savior! His contributions are unparalleled, and his accomplishments surpass ancient and modern times!”

Ye Yuan asked again, “Then do you know where the people related to him went?”

The moment the other party heard, he shook his head blankly and said, “The savior is the savior. Who would go and care about the people around him?”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed even harder.

He discovered that his traces had already been completely erased by someone, leaving behind only a savior.

The world only knew of Ye Yuan, but they did not know that there were nine Dao Ancestors!

The people related to Ye Yuan had also all disappeared without a trace!

“Looks like your road of growing up was just a certain existence’s conspiracy! When you were growing up, there has always been a pair of eyes behind you, watching you!” Mi Tian suddenly said.

Ye Yuan only felt his back turn cold!

Who was the other party?

What did he want to do?

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled, his head suddenly exploding, thinking of someone!

Yan Jadetrue!

This Heavenspan World was a scheme single-handedly arranged by him in the first place!

If talking about who was most likely to do this, then the greatest possibility was him!

Ye Yuan discovered that he had always been stuck in a fixed mindset.

That was that Yan Jadetrue was already dead.

But who had seen that he really died?

The people in the same era as him had long since disappeared.

Even Zhuo Bufan had also embarked on the road to the south.

Then was he really dead?

Not necessarily!

“Huhu,?looks like you’ve already guessed it! As expected, worthy of being the person that I chose!” The Deva Fourth Blight who was stopped by Ye Yuan suddenly emitted a strange laugh from his mouth.

Ye Yuan’s entire body shook, staring fixedly at the other party, and discovered that the look in the other party’s eyes had already changed.

As if he had become another person.

“Yan Jadetrue!” Ye Yuan enunciated each word.

“It’s me!”

The other party did not deny it, but he smiled and said, “Your improvement is faster than I imagined! What I didn’t expect is that the Heavenspan Mountain actually evolved into a grandmist treasure in your hands!”

Ye Yuan never dreamed that the Saint Exalt Jadetrue who had once commanded the Five Great Heavenly Regions, the Heavenspan Mountain’s former master, was actually not dead yet!

“What the hell do you want to do? Where is Li-er they all?” Ye Yuan’s tone was almost freezing this world.

Ye Yuan was virtually on the verge of going berserk right now.

At the thought of his growth, how there had always been a pair of eyes watching behind him, he felt a chill without it being cold.

Let alone that Yan Jadetrue actually even kidnapped Li-er they all.

Yan Jadetrue smiled lightly and said, “Ye Yuan, you’re the smartest and most talented person that I’ve met! Even when compared to Zhuo Bufan, you’re not the least bit inferior too! Therefore, you should have already guessed what I want to do, right?”

Ye Yuan suppressed the fury in his heart and said in a solemn voice, “You want me to enter the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm?”

Ye Yuan was not stupid. With the plane passageway suddenly erupting and the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm suddenly opening up, it likely had everything to do with Yan Jadetrue.

Otherwise, why would such a sudden turn of events occur when everything was perfectly fine?

Yan Jadetrue caused such a big commotion. It was clearly in order to make everyone enter the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm.

Of course, he wanted to make Ye Yuan enter the Sacred Sieve Mystic Realm most of all.

But it was clearly impossible for Ye Yuan to give in obediently. That was why he kidnapped Li-er and the rest.

Everyone and everything, all seemed to be under Yan Jadetrue’s control.

“Smart! Dealing with you, even if it’s me, I have to be careful too. Therefore, for safety’s sake, I sent your lover and all the people related to you into thousands of small chiliocosms. Only I know their locations! Of course, they are all very safe. As long as you listen and behave obediently, they will always be very safe!” Yan Jadetrue said with a smile.

Ye Yuan looked at Yan Jadetrue coldly and said in a solemn voice, “You searched for successors with the Heart of Heavenspan to break through the Heavenspan World’s barriers and become a Heavenly Stratum powerhouse! The purpose was for today?”

Yan Jadetrue’s appearance made Ye Yuan think of many things.

From the time Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove obtained the Heart of Heavenspan, to the series of events that happened later on, it seemed like just a coincidence.

But, looking back now, everything was inevitable!

It was just that Ye Yuan could not figure it out. Yan Jadetrue’s means were exceedingly formidable, why did he have to look for successors in the Lower Realms?

Yan Jadetrue smiled and said, “I said before, you’re very smart! So, your decision is?”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath and said in a cold voice, “Do I still have a choice?”

Yan Jadetrue smiled and said, “Ye Yuan, you don’t have a trace of flaw from head to toe. Your only flaw is that you attach too much importance to the people around you! And this is also an important reason why I chose you!”

At this time, Ye Yuan already recovered his calm and said coolly, “Tell me, what do you want me to do?”

Yan Jadetrue said, “Go to the Labyrinth Divine Palace and help me get something!”
