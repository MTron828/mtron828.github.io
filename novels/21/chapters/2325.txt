Chapter 2329: New Number One Holy Land!

The battle of geniuses would begin a year later.

Ye Yuan and Jian Yunxin agreed to head to the Primeval War Realm a year later.

During this period of time, Ye Yuan had too many things to work on.

After the Cloudheart Realm battle, tens of thousands of alchemy path powerhouses gathered at Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma.

In this battle, Ye Yuan cracked the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art, saving countless alchemy path powerhouses.

What was more respectable was that Ye Yuan drew away the powerful Originguard by himself in order to protect these alchemy path powerhouses. This deed had already spread throughout the entire alchemy world.

Coupled with Ye Yuan’s powerful alchemy path strength, he already became the new alchemy path leader of the Heavenspan World.

Even Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s prestige was also not as high as Ye Yuan’s currently.

Not just some itinerant cultivators, even many major factions and major family clans came over one after another too, hoping to join Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma.

For some time, Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma had as many powerhouses as clouds.

Bai Tong this number one powerhouse’s strength already could not hold down the fort.

Feeling helpless, Ye Yuan simply invited Sacred Ancestor High Priest to garrison Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma.

After Sacred Ancestor High Priest recovered from his injuries, he also learned of the severity of the present situation and agreed without hesitation.

Putting it another way, this life of his was also saved by Ye Yuan.

With his ability, he would not have been able to crack the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art at all.

Furthermore, him and Medicine Ancestor teaming up was also not Originguard’s match at all.

Continuing to fight, the two of them could only go down the path of demise.

And later, Originguard also rushed to kill Ye Yuan and ignored him because Ye Yuan cracked the Grand Xingtian Heaven Locking Art.

Otherwise, it would be hard for him to salvage the situation alone. He would likely have been killed by Originguard in a few moves.

At this time, Sacred Ancestor High Priest could not help feeling somewhat emotional.

He provided a lot of conveniences to Ye Yuan these few years, helping him to grow.

He did not expect that the one who benefited in the end was him.

Hence, when Ye Yuan requested him to come out, he agreed without the slightest hesitation.

However, when he came to Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma and saw the Pill Tower’s magnificence, Sacred Ancestor High Priest had been immersed in unbelievable shock these few days.

It turned out that the powerful ones in Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma were not just Ye Yuan master and apprentices three people.

The strength of each alchemist here was much stronger than same rank alchemists in the outside world.

It was also that Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma’s development time was too short.

Otherwise, this place would be the true alchemy path’s number one holy land.

Cloudheart Realm was simply weak to the max compared to this place.

Dao Realm powerhouses that were hard to come across in the outside world, were like cabbages in this place.

Especially the alchemists that were the first batch to join the Pill Tower, their current strength already reached an inconceivable height.

For so many years, Sacred Ancestor High Priest only paid attention to Ye Yuan.

In his view, only Ye Yuan this person was worth him paying attention to.

As for the Pill Tower, he thought nothing of it at all. He also never paid attention to it before.

An alchemy path holy land that had risen for merely over a thousand years was simply not worthy of his attention.

Not everyone was Ye Yuan.

No matter how capable Ye Yuan was at teaching disciples, in one thousand years’ time, the faction that he established also could not be very strong.

Not just Sacred Ancestor High Priest, all the alchemy path powerhouses who came to Heavenly Eagle Bodhidharma, each one was in shock.

One person being a genius was understandable, a city full of geniuses, this was simply incomprehensible.

How many geniuses could a mere imperial city gather?

Being able to produce a heaven-defying Ye Yuan, this was already a fortune that was cultivated for eight lifetimes.

But when they really came here, only then, did they discover that they were totally wrong.

Outrageously wrong!

The cultivation method of the alchemy path powerhouses here was completely different from them.

They immersed in the comprehension of Dao daily, but the alchemists here did not comprehend on Dao at all.

They repeated the simplest and most basic practice day after day, year after year.

Even the medicinal pills refined were very basic too. There were none of those seldom-seen medicinal pills.

These fundamental skills, they simply held them in contempt, and they never thought of practicing them before as well.

If not for Ye Yuan’s two disciples being so heaven-defying, if someone said to cultivate like this in front of them, they would definitely have smacked the other person to death with one slap.

Wasn’t this sort of cultivation method purely a waste of time? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But Ye Yuan used facts to tell them that this was the correct way to cultivate!

“Sigh, this old man always thought that you relied on talent to have today’s strength. At least, talent accounted for the absolute cause and effect! But didn’t expect that you walked until today with such a method. Looking at it now, I was wrong; the world was wrong! Your Dao points directly at the source,” Sacred Ancestor High Priest said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s not necessarily the case. The basic alchemy techniques that the Pill Tower cultivates, I’ve already improved them many times. Cultivating it now, it’s easier to come into contact with the level of Dao.”

As Ye Yuan’s strength continuously grew stronger, his horizons also grew higher and higher.

Hence, he continuously improved the basic cultivation methods, making it easier to come into contact with the level of Dao.

It was also precisely this kind of improvement that made the Pill Tower’s powerhouses became more and more.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest gave him a deep glance and said, “Before today, I’m afraid that if you went out and said that you attained Dao by cultivating like this, there’s probably no one who would believe at all.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s not that no one would believe, but that they would laugh their heads off.”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest laughed and said, “Indeed so.”

Suddenly, his gaze flickered, and he said, “Ye Yuan, can this cultivation method be imparted to this old man?”

Ye Yuan looked at the other party in slight surprise. He did not expect that a powerhouse like Sacred Ancestor High Priest could actually let go of his self-esteem, and take the initiative to request to cultivate these most basic techniques.

This was equivalent to starting over from the top!

He could not help laughing as he said, “Senior Sacred Ancestor worries too much. My Pill Tower doesn’t have the idea of hoarding our own belongings. The alchemy path powerhouses who join my Pill Tower can all undergo this kind of cultivation. It’s just that I’m afraid that not many can persevere with it.”

This kind of cultivation method was extremely dreary. At present, the powerhouses left in the Pill Tower were all leftovers from great tides washing away the sand.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest looked at Ye Yuan with a look of surprise and was speechless for a long time.

Only after a long time did he say, “Providing education for all without discrimination! This old man examines my own conscience and feels that I’m broadminded, but compared to you, I’m far inferior.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Why does Senior Sacred Ancestor say this? At present, the human race is in imminent danger. An additional alchemy path powerhouse is an additional hope. You also heard what Originguard said. For the human race to be able to win in the last Doomsday Battle, alchemy path powerhouses made tremendous contributions.”

Sacred Ancestor High Priest nodded heavily and said, “What you said is right. If there are still any sectarian views at this time, then it’s really seeking death!”

No idea starting from when, those alchemy path powerhouses who had once commanded the wind and clouds, all put aside their ego, and followed the Pill Tower’s powerhouses to do their homework seriously.

When they put down the pride of an expert, they suddenly discovered that the Pill Tower’s powerhouses could actually do the basic training so well, and so solidly.

And when they competed in alchemy with the Pill Tower’s alchemists, they discovered to their amazement that many times, the quality of the medicinal pills that they refined was actually not as good as the Pill Tower’s alchemists.

One had to know, each and every one of them, they were Seven-star Alchemy Gods. Some were even Eight-star Alchemy Gods!

While the Pill Tower’s Seven-star Alchemy Gods were extremely few.
