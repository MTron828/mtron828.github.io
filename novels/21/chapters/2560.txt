Chapter 2566: I Am This Stubborn!

Black gas steamed up from Ye Yuan’s body.

The terrifying poison gas horrified people at the sight of it.

Tang Yu’s expression was ugly as he said, “To be able to render a middle Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse without the slightest power to resist, the damage of this poison to Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums can be imagined! What’s Big Brother trying to do!”

Seeing Ye Yuan’s appalling appearance, the people in the Nation Teacher Manor were all terrified.

They thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure.

But very soon, the black fog around Ye Yuan gradually became thin.

The black gas on Ye Yuan’s body also gradually faded away.

Finally, Ye Yuan recovered to his original appearance again.

Everyone had blank faces, shocked speechless.

A deadly poison capable of killing a Greater Sublime Heaven powerhouse, Nation Teacher was actually safe and sound?

“This … He’s actually fine already?” Lin Lan said with a dull expression.

When Tang Yu saw this scene, he was beside himself with joy.

But hearing Lin Lan’s words, he frowned and said, “Why? You hope that something happens to Big Brother so that you can become Nation Teacher again?”

Lin Lan shook his head and said, “You don’t know the danger in this! This poison is extremely hidden! Martial artists can’t detect it at all in the early stages. But once it erupts, if I didn’t guess wrongly, it can probably poison Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses to death! For Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratums, forget about testing the poison with their own bodies; they would practically die upon contact! Master’s means can be rated as heaven-defying!”

When Tang Yu heard, he also opened his mouth wide, a look of shock on his face.

His big brother’s means, all of them were truly inconceivable!

Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum was absolutely a supreme-level powerhouse to Eastward Country.

If a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouse came over, annihilating a country was normal too!

This poison could poison such a powerhouse, but could not do anything to Ye Yuan. It could be seen how terrifying his means were!

Qiao Kaiyuan had a look of shock as he said, “Is Nation Teacher really an ascender? We have lived to this ripe old age and haven’t seen such a heaven-defying ascender before!”

Lin Lan smiled bitterly and said, “If Master isn’t an ascender, curing this poison would likely be like eating rice and drinking water! If my conjecture is right, Master testing poison with his own body has likely already been run of the mill long ago! Not only is he an alchemy expert, but he is also a poison path grandmaster!”

Amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, Ye Yuan slowly stood up, his figure staggering a little.

This poison was indeed powerful. Even if he forced the toxin out of his body, he could not quite bear it too.

However, Cheng Chongshan’s aura was getting weaker and weaker, it could not be delayed anymore!

Ye Yuan used his fingers as a sword, one stream of sword energy after another fired into Cheng Chongshan’s body.

Replacing needles with swords!

Sword energy and the poison energy carried out a cruel to the extreme slaughter within Cheng Chongshan’s body.

The poison energy was too strong, Ye Yuan’s sword energy was too weak, melting upon contact!

But Ye Yuan already tested the poison with his own body and already had a direct understanding of the trajectory path and prowess of this poison.

Hence, that was why he dared to apply the needles!

With a definite object in view, no matter how strong the toxicity, it was not a match too!

The poison gas was forced out of the body bit by bit.

Suddenly, Cheng Chongshan’s fingers moved slightly.

“Revolve your divine essence and follow the direction of my sword energy to assault!” Ye Yuan shouted coldly.

Cheng Chongshan’s whole body shook, feeling one surging ray of sword energy after another rushing without restraint within his body.

And the toxins within his body were actually cut down by a lot!

Cheng Chongshan did not dare to be neglectful, hurriedly revolving divine essence.

Two mighty forces gathered together, the toxin was immediately like water that breached the banks, fleeing in defeat.

Six hours later, Ye Yuan slumped to the ground.

But Cheng Chongshan was radiating with vigor anew.

The poison in his body was already pretty much all healed up!

Nation Teacher Manor was dwelling upon this with great relish.

“Nation Teacher is truly a miracle-hand! This kind of strange poison, he actually cured it!”

“Didn’t you hear the former nation teacher? That poison can even poison Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses to death. Our nation teacher is only Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum and he can actually test the poison with his own body, truly incredible!”

“Tsk tsk,?really feel honored to be working in the Nation Teacher Manor! With Nation Teacher around, it will be hard to die even if you wanted to!”

… …

With regards to Ye Yuan’s means, everyone was incredibly amazed.

Barring no accidents, today’s matter would spread throughout the entire imperial city very soon!

The prestige of the Nation Teacher manor would also be like the noonday sun!

“Lin Lan, dispose of the toxin, be careful!” Ye Yuan said weakly.

Cheng Chongshan looked at Ye Yuan, his expression a little awkward.

This poison attacked too suddenly and too fiercely. He did not even have time to resist and his entire person crumbled.

He thought that he was dead for sure, did not expect that he was actually saved!

This ascender’s methods were simply inconceivable!

Cheng Chongshan was deeply aware of this poison’s prowess, even those elders in the sect might not be able to resolve it too.

This puny little ascender actually cured it!

Thinking about how he was posturing in front of Ye Yuan previously, vowing solemnly that Ye Yuan was scaring him, he really wished to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

However, Cheng Chongshan was very displeased in his heart!

Having his face slapped like this by an ascender, he felt that his dignity was seriously challenged!

The looks around him seemed so piercing.

An ant should have treated him properly to begin with.

Now, it actually caused him to almost die.

People were this strange sometimes, it was clearly you who helped him, but he felt that you did wrong.

You even had to beg to help him.

But Cheng Chongshan was not a fool. It was impossible for him to fall out at this time.

Wu Shuang and his junior apprentice brother still had to rely on Ye Yuan to do the treatments.

A man under low eaves had no choice but to lower his head!

Several years were required to go from Eastward Country to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

It was hard for distant water to quench one’s current thirst. If they were to return to the sect, Wu Shuang would have long died completely.

“Brother Ye, it was this Cheng who was rash this time! This life-saving grace, this Cheng will bear it in mind, and will definitely repay it!” Cheng Chongshan clasped his hands and said.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “If you want to thank, thank His Majesty. With your attitude previously, it’s impossible for me to save you! It was him who begged me bitterly to save you!”

Cheng Chongshan had an awkward look and said with a smile, “No matter what, Brother Ye acting to save this Cheng is a fact. This favor, this Cheng has remembered it! As for Eastward royal family, this Cheng will naturally repay generously!”

Humph!

This cocky fellow was really like a rock in the toilet; stinky and hard!

If not for Junior Apprentice Sister, did you think that I would be so humble and submissive towards you?

After Junior Apprentice Sister is well, I’ll definitely tear you to shreds!

Otherwise, it’s hard to dispel the hatred in my heart!

Do you think that you can be invincible under the heavens if you know spatial rule?

Too naive!

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Leave. My divine essence is depleted and have to go into closed-seclusion!”

The moment Cheng Chongshan saw this, he hurriedly said, “Brother Ye, this Cheng’s junior apprentice sister is still poisoned …”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I am this stubborn! If you talk to me nicely, everything can be discussed. But I gave you the chance! Want me to save them, also can. Bring out your sincerity!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Finished speaking, he turned right around and left, leaving behind everyone with awkward faces.

Cheng Chongshan looked at Ye Yuan’s back view, his gaze like a knife, almost wanting to kill Ye Yuan.

In this remote hinterland, he was actually being humiliated by an ascender like so!

If he did not avenge this enmity, where would his face go?!

Qiao Kaiyuan was silent like a cicada in winter by the side, not daring to make a sound at all.
