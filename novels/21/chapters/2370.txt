Chapter 2376: Sources Emerging in Unison to Destroy the Celestial Palace!

“Sword Dao source! Formation Dao source! Spatial source! Just ... Just who the hell is this guy?”

“When did such a heaven-defying genius appear in the human race? Why doesn’t the divine race have any news at all?”

“Too terrifying! If such a genius grows up, he’ll surely be a mortal calamity to my divine race!”

... ...

Regardless of whether it was the divine race or human race powerhouses, after seeing such a commotion, each and every one of their faces turned ashen.

A Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor brat actually comprehended three great sources. Among them, there was even a supreme law!

This kind of talent was simply too terrifying. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Sentry Celestial Palace’s palace lord’s gaze was full of solemness as he thought to himself, “No way! I’ve got to kill this brat! Otherwise, he’ll become my divine race’s mortal calamity!”

“Attack together, kill this punk!” Sentry Celestial Palace Lord did not hesitate in the slightest as he gave the order.

Although the commotion that Ye Yuan put forth was very scary, how could it really scare Sentry Celestial Palace Lord, this kind of existence?

With Sentry Celestial Palace Lord’s strength, challenging ten human Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperors alone was also nothing difficult, let alone Ye Yuan, this Fifth Firmament Heavenly Emperor.

Under his word of command, the numerous powerhouses each displayed their divine abilities.

Although they were not able to traverse through the void, it did not affect them from executing their means.

Especially late-stage Eight-marks powerhouses of the divine race, that kind of power was simply several levels higher.

Qin Chao stood beside Ye Yuan, his expression incomparably pale like paper paste.

When had he seen before this kind of terrifying battle?

“You don’t resist, listen to my arrangements, otherwise, I can’t guarantee your safety.”

Ye Yuan’s voice came over leisurely, making Qin Chao’s heart turned somber.

Facing so many powerhouses, he was actually so calm and collected.

As if what was in front of him were not divine race powerhouses, but a bunch of clay chickens and pottery dogs!

“True Nirvana Sword Formation, arise!”

Ye Yuan raised his fingertips, the terrifying sword formation suddenly condenses.

In an instant, the entire sky became a brutal battlefield!

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

“Ahhh!!”

... ...

The screams were continuous. Those human powerhouses, including late-stage Heavenly Emperor mighty experts, were totally like paper paste inside the sword formation, a swath dying in an instant.

One had to know, even an unpredictable child like Pang Zhen could not last too long inside Ye Yuan’s sword formation too. So let alone these people?

Those unpredictable children, which one was not a Seventh Firmament or Eighth Firmament Heavenly Emperor super powerhouse?

Compared to the unpredictable children, these humans were too ordinary.

Sentry Celestial Palace Lord’s pupils constricted, being shocked by the scene in front of him.

He never thought that a human could be so powerful too!

This kind of leapfrogging realms to battle, the means to mass-kill enemies, even he, a member of the divine race, could not do it too!

The divine race was strong, but could the divine race’s geniuses kill so many late-stage Heavenly Emperor powerhouses with a wave of a hand at Ye Yuan’s realm?

Absolutely impossible!

The more he witnessed Ye Yuan’s means, the greater the shock in his heart.

After the humans finished dying, it was the divine race’s turn.

The divine race similarly could not hold out for long in the sword formation.

Those terrifying means could not unleash their power in the sword formation at all.

The present True Nirvana Sword Formation was integrated into the spatial source by Ye Yuan, its power rising once more.

Three great sources fusing into one, the power was simply unimaginable.

The True Nirvana Sword Formation after being strengthened, was simply without any weaknesses to exploit!

At this moment, Sentry Celestial Palace Lord finally felt the threat of death.

He wanted to escape, but space was already frozen. Coupled with the harassment of the sword formation, he had no opportunity to escape at all!

Space freezing, it was equivalent to that this region of space was already controlled by Ye Yuan.

Being unable to utilize the power of space, just by relying on his own divine essence to fly, there was no way to escape at all.

“No way! I have to send this news out! Otherwise, there will surely be a catastrophe in the future!”

Thinking up to here, Sentry Celestial Palace Lord no longer hesitated, taking out a white crystal in his hand.

Instant Message Crystal!

This was the divine race’s most urgent communication method. Once activated, it could send news back to the upper Sentry Celestial Palace within a day.

Sentry Celestial Palace Lord muttered under his breath, “Skysouth has a child who comprehended three great sources; a huge disaster! Quickly send Nine-marks to come and kill!”

Pah!

Finished talking, Sentry Celestial Palace Lord directly crushed the Instant Message Crystal. One white rune after another disappeared in a flash.

These pieces of information actually passed through Ye Yuan’s spatial freeze!

“Haha, brat, even if you kill us, you’re also dead for sure! After the message reaches the Southern Sentry Celestial Palace, your death date will arrive!” Sentry Celestial Palace Lord said with a cold laugh.

He already no longer had any confidence with regards to Ye Yuan.

Because he unleashed all of his abilities and was actually unable to break through Ye Yuan’s sword formation.

Ye Yuan had long noticed Sentry Celestial Palace Lord’s activities. Hearing that, he just said with a smile that was not a smile, “Oh, is that so? You take a look behind you.”

Suddenly, Sentry Celestial Palace Lord’s expression changed wildly, his eyes revealing a look of horror.

It was only to see that those runes were currently staying at a distance 1000 feet behind him, crawling like a tortoise, not flying out of the range of the sword formation at all.

His pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “T-Time law! You ... are you still human?”

It was precisely time law!

Those runes could pass through spatial law, but could not stop time law!

Under time law, the originally lightning-quick runes became like tortoises now.

The current time law was no longer 1:30.

1:30 was unable to stop such a fast Instant Message Crystal too.

The localized time law in front of them already reached an astonishing 1:100!

Ye Yuan being swept into the spacetime turbulence was indeed incomparably perilous, but it also let him obtain tremendous benefits.

Regardless of whether it was time law or spatial law, he had great insights while in the spacetime turbulence.

Puchi!

More than a dozen streaks of cold light flashed past, slicing the white runes into countless pieces.

Sentry Celestial Palace Lord’s complexion was ashen. He looked toward Ye Yuan in amazement, as if looking at a freak.

“Alright, I can send you all on your way now!” Ye Yuan said nonchalantly, his words full of indifference.

... ...

Very soon, a piece of shocking news resounded throughout Skysouth!

Skysouth Sentry Celestial Palace was completely destroyed by someone. Not even fowls and dogs were left!

All of the people including Sentry Celestial Palace Lord had perished!

This news was like a wind, sweeping throughout the entire Southern Border very quickly.

For a moment, everyone from all races, they were discussing this matter.

They were shocked by this news. Because no one had ever been able to destroy a Sentry Celestial Palace before.

What was scarier was that no traces were left behind at all.

No one knew who on earth did it.

“Being able to destroy the Sentry Celestial Palace and not leave behind the slightest hint of traces, it’s probably at least a Deva Second Blight powerhouse, right?”

“Pooh! Can a Deva Second Blight stop the Instant Message Crystal? Even for Deva Fifth Blights, those able to accomplish it are extremely few too, right?”

“Then ... who on earth did it? This matter is truly an epoch-making huge incident.”

... ...

The various races were excited. They were just the general public, but they were similarly people who had been oppressed and humiliated.

This action of Ye Yuan was simply invigorating.

They did not dare to speak out but expressed incomparably joy in private.

Finally, the situation gave vent to frustration!

However, when this news was spread back to the Ziwei Sect, the entire sect was deathly silent!
