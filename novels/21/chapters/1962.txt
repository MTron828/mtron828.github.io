Chapter 1966: They Don’t Even Dare to Look

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Heh heh, you could actually break through to imperial aura at this age. I’m afraid ... you stepped on dog shit when you stepped out of the house, right?”

As Song Yu said, he burst out laughing.

When the others heard it, they also laughed along.

Toward Liu Yi, they looked down on him from the bottom of their hearts.

Firstly, it was because his appearance was wretched. Secondly, it was because he was already advanced in age.

At this age, even if one had an imperial aura, it was likely very hard to break through to the Empyrean Realm too.

Liu Yi himself also started to laugh. He concurred and said, “How did Sir Song know? Heh heh, 3000 years ago, this old man really stepped into a pile of dog shit when I went out of the house. In the end, not long after, I obtained some lucky chances inside a mystic realm. That’s how I broke through to imperial aura.”

With him saying so, everyone was even more amused.

Song Yu laughed until he could not close his mouth as he said with amusement, “Huhu, you have self-awareness. After going in, follow me. I’ll ensure your safety.”

Liu Yi chuckled and said, “Then I’ll have to thank Sir Song very much.”

Finished saying, Liu Yi sat down, but his eyes unwittingly flitted toward Ye Yuan.

Just now, everyone was jeering at him; only Ye Yuan did not.

Now, it was Ye Yuan’s turn. But Ye Yuan did not have the intention of opening his mouth.

Song Yu looked at Ye Yuan with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Hey, snotty brat, it’s your turn.”

Ever since breaking through to the perfect sixth transformation golden body, Ye Yuan’s looks became much younger all at once, as if returning to his youth era.

In other people’s view, he was just like an immature snotty brat. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Hahaha!”

Another wave of loud laughter came.

Ye Yuan gave Song Yu a glance and said coolly, “I’m called Ye Yuan. I’m from Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.”

“Heavenly Eagle Imperial City? What place is that, never heard before. Haha, a puny little imperial aura can actually produce an imperial aura too? Just now, Liu Yi said that he stepped on dog shit when he stepped out of the house. You wouldn’t have eaten dog shit, right?”

Ye Yuan had not finished talking yet when Song Yu directly verbally abused him right in his face.

Song Yu had long discerned it. When the others heard his background and destiny, they all already looked up to him for guidance. But Ye Yuan had an aloof and indifferent appearance, not giving him any face at all.

Therefore, he did not plan on saving Ye Yuan’s face either.

Moreover, Ye Yuan only came from a remote tiny little imperial city.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s name, he had really not heard of it before.

“Hey, snotty brat! Eating dog shit, your destiny must be very flourishing, right? What’s your destiny? Such a great destiny, you can likely become a Dao Ancestor in the future, right?” Song Yu convulsed with laughter in great delight.

“Hahaha!”

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “My destiny, actually, I don’t know either.”

Everyone could not help being taken aback when they heard it. Those able to enter the Virtuous Wind Establishment, they needed to have imperial aura at the least.

Because only a person with an imperial aura could enter the Ancient God Battlefield.

But Ye Yuan said that he did not know?

What kind of situation was this?

“Don’t know? Kid, you’re making fun of us, right? Those able to enter Virtuous Wind Establishment are all at least imperial auras that have gone through the approval of the Stellar Hall’s elders. You don’t even know yourself and you can come in? Or is it that your destiny is too weak and your strength is too low as well, so you’re embarrassed to say?” Song Yu said with a contemptuous look.

Not saying was naturally being embarrassed to say.

Most likely, Ye Yuan’s destiny was the same as Liu Yi, just entered imperial aura.

Makes sense, coming from a measly imperial aura, being able to have an imperial aura was already the limit.

“That’s not it. They all said that I’m of the emperor surmounting aura, but it’s all guesses. Because ... they don’t even dare to look,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Emperor surmounting aura? Don’t dare to look? Haha, it’s really getting more and more ridiculous! The Stellar Hall elders’ means are all exceedingly formidable, they would not dare to look? Kid, you also have to come up with a draft when you’re boasting, alright?” Stellar Hall said with a cold smile.

“He didn’t lie. The Jian family members who have used the aura viewing art on him before all went blind.”

At this time, a voice sounded out from the side-hall.

Following that, a group of people slowly walked out. They were precisely the Stellar Hall’s eight elders.

“Elder Hongxiao!” Song Yu’s face changed, immensely shocked in his heart.

It was still his first time hearing that when the Jian Family’s people used the aura viewing art, they would actually go blind.

But these words coming out of Jian Hongxiao’s words naturally would not be wrong.

That late-stage imperial Guo Jingyang suddenly said with a look of surprise, “Blinded? Could ... Could he be Ye Yuan, Master Ye?”

Song Yu was taken aback and said, “M-Master Ye?”

He had naturally heard of Master Ye Yuan’s name before. The Jian family members in this city simply revered him like a god.

Guo Jingyang nodded and said, “Brother Song came late and might not have heard before. Back then, Master Ye and Master Hongxiao just entered Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital. Protector Jian Hao’s son, Jian Yun, used the aura viewing art on Master Ye. In the end, his eyes went blind on the spot. Later, it was even treated by Master Ye.”

When the group of children of destiny heard that, they were all extremely surprised.

They had all heard of Master Ye’s name and even thought that he was an old fogey. Who would have thought that he was actually this young?

No one connected this ‘snotty brat’ in front of them with that Master Ye Yuan whose name shook Extreme Luck.

Song Yu’s face was full of astoundment.

He kept calling snotty brat earlier. Who would have expected that Ye Yuan was actually such a major figure?

This face of yours was also too deceiving!

Hang on, what did ... he say earlier?

Emperor surmounting aura?

Song Yu was speechless. Could it be that this Ye Yuan really had the emperor surmounting aura?

Going blind with a look, how powerful a destiny was that!

Why did Ye Yuan himself say that he was not sure?

If the Jian Family suspected that he was of the emperor surmounting aura, couldn’t City Lord personally use the aura viewing art on him?

With City Lord’s strength, he could see through Ye Yuan’s actual situation, right?

Everyone knew that City Lord understood the mysteries of good fortune in terms of aura viewing art.

How could Song Yu know that Jian Sutao wanted to look, but he did not dare to look!

Everyone’s gazes shot toward Song Yu one after another, making his face incomparably scalding hot.

Just as Song Yu was in a daze, the various elders had already taken their positions. An old figure appeared.

“We pay respects to City Lord!” Seeing this old man, everyone hurriedly bowed and gave a salute.

Even if it was Song Yu, he also did not dare to be the slightest bit neglectful in front of Jian Sutao.

Jian Sutao slowly opened his mouth and said, “You’re all the children of destiny that my Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital picked. Your future accomplishments are limitless. If you can obtain lucky chances from inside the Ancient God Battlefield, surpassing this empyrean in the future is also not impossible. Therefore, I wish you all the best! Alright, the hour has arrived, you all get ready, you’re about to set off.”

On Jian Sutao’s body, a dense fog leaped up.

It suddenly became incomparably dark inside the entire hall.

Dots of stars lit up, a passageway appeared in front of everyone.

Song Yu did not hesitate, taking the lead and entering. The rest followed closely behind.

Ye Yuan was naturally the last one. In the instant he stepped into the passageway, Jian Sutao suddenly opened his mouth and said, “Ye Yuan, don’t forget the thing you promised this empyrean.”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Relax. The things that I, Ye Yuan, promised, I’ll live up to my word.”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan did not hesitate, also going into the passageway.
