Chapter 2306: Diametrically Opposed

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Personally written by the Medicine Ancestor! It’s actually personally written by the Medicine Ancestor!”

“Even if learn a tiny bit of Medicine Ancestor’s Alchemy Dao, it’s also sufficient for us to benefit for our entire lives!”

“During this conference this time, Myriad Region Alchemy Conference really put in the blood capital! This first place, I must get it!”

... ...

For a moment, those alchemy powerhouses were extremely agitated. The Medicine Ancestor’s personally written notes directly ignited everyone’s enthusiasm.

The handwritten notes of Alchemy Dao’s number one person was a fatal temptation to all alchemy powerhouses.

Even Ye Yuan was also very moved when he heard ‘handwritten by Medicine Ancestor’ these four words.

To talk about the alchemy path’s legend, no one could surpass the Medicine Ancestor in this world.

His Alchemy Dao experience was absolutely a treasure that all those who refined pills yearned for even in their sleep.

Whatever heavenly emperor spirit treasure, whatever rank eight divine pill, they were all not worth mentioning in front of the Medicine Ancestor’s handwritten notes.

In the crowd, Yun Yi’s gaze revealed a look of fanaticism.

“Hehe, Junior Apprentice Brother, you’re moved!” Ning Siyu said with a laugh.

Yun Yi did not mind and said smilingly, “Why? Aren’t you moved?”

Ning Siyu pursed her lips and said with an indifferent look, “Getting it is good; not getting it is fine as well, I don’t feel anything regarding it. Either way, this Medicine Ancestor’s handwritten notes are also not much better than the things Master taught us.”

Yun Yi nodded and said, “I don’t deny this point, but everyone has their shortcomings and merits. Learning from others’ strong points and closing the gap is the right way. I think that Master is also moved now, right?”

Ning Siyu said with a look of contempt, “You this fellow, really becoming more and more like Master.”

Yun Yi smiled and did not refute it.

Ye Yuan taught him far too many things. His respect for Ye Yuan was long already engraved in his bones.

However, he similarly also viewed Ye Yuan as his lifelong goal and opponent.

This was also what Ye Yuan taught him.

By the side, a middle-aged man said with a disdainful look, “Heh, truly shameless boasting! Two juniors talking like the handwritten notes are already yours.”

This middle-aged man’s aura was extremely strong, he was shockingly a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, an Eight-star Alchemy God.

Another person said, “Huhu, Master Ping Chuan, don’t get angry. Youngsters making their world debut, not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth is understandable.”

A young man in crimson-robed said with a face full of arrogance, “Brat, stop hallucinating that you’re the favorite. Medicine Ancestor’s handwritten notes are our Cloudheart Realm’s, no one can bring it away.”

Their expressions changed, one after another looking toward that youngster in crimson robe.

Hearing his meaning, he was actually Cloudheart Realm’s powerhouse.

“It’s Zou Rui! He’s Cloudheart Realm’s young generation’s strongest person! I didn’t think that even he would come to take part too!” A cry of exclamation suddenly came from around.

When the others heard this, their expressions changed one after another.

The powerhouses taking part in the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference this time were too many, the various major holy lands’ elite disciples moved out in succession.

And among these holy lands, the strongest was undoubtedly Cloudheart Realm.

With this, everyone finally realized that this reward was not easy to get.

Yun Yi gave Zou Rui a glance and did not say anything.

The current Yun Yi had long already restrained his sharp edge, and would not fly into a great after with a casual provocation like back then.

This was because he had powerful strength as support.

The so-called not shaking when you have a jar full of vinegar, and shaking violently if you have a half-jar of vinegar; it was this logic.

Of course, he was more influenced by Ye Yuan. Just as Ning Siyu said, he was becoming more and more like Ye Yuan.

As for his performance, it was naturally being thought of as submission by Zou Rui.

Very soon, the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference officially began, everyone appeared in front of a transmission door.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook said coolly, “What’s in front of you all is the Emperor Vast Pagoda’s transmission door. After you all enter the transmission door, you’ll be randomly assigned to a pocket space in twos. After the alchemy battle ends, the Emperor Vast Pagoda will automatically determine your victory or loss. Alright, now, the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference official begins.”

The Emperor Vast Pagoda was a very famous heavenly emperor spirit treasure of Cloudheart Realm, its power being limitless. It was also an essential treasure to host alchemy conferences.

In the past, when Cloudheart Realm organized such grand occasion, they would use it.

It was just that an alchemy conference of this scale had not been held for a long time already.

Under a word of command, everyone disappeared from the plaza one after another, entering the Emperor Vast Pagoda’s space.

The originally packed plaza became empty all at once.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook pointed at the void, a huge light screen appeared above the void. The situation in the Emperor Vast Pagoda was completely revealed in front of everyone.

Done with all these, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook took his seat, looked at Ye Yuan, and said, “I’ve long heard of Second Sage’s great name. Seeing you today, indeed lives up to your reputation.”

His powerful fighting spirit earlier, even a Ninth Firmament Heavenly Emperor might not necessarily be able to withstand it, but Ye Yuan resolved it in an instant, making it clear at a glance.

Even though the outside world’s appraisal of Ye Yuan was extremely high, who was he, Heavenly Emperor Distantbook?

He was the Medicine Ancestor’s direct lineage disciple, one of the Heavenspan World’s few supreme powerhouses.

He thought that by relying on his powerful fighting spirit, he could instantly shatter Ye Yuan’s will.

But sadly, he failed.

However, he was not disappointed but became even more interested in Ye Yuan instead.

Ye Yuan gave an ‘oh’ nonchalantly and did not express anything.

In an instant, the atmosphere became tense. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This ‘oh’ was packed with the smell of gunpowder.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook smiled and said, “I heard that Second Sage’s disciples also came to take part in the Myriad Region Alchemy Conference. Second Sage is unusually talented and can reach the realm of Dao pill within a short two, three thousand years. Wonder if your disciples can survive the first round or not?”

Provocation, this was a blatant provocation.

Second Sage was a genius; nobody could refute this.

But the time that Second Sage attained his Dao was too short. So how formidable could his disciples be?

Even if he taught his disciples day and night, it was also impossible to teach his disciples until they were very formidable.

Everyone looked in Ye Yuan’s direction, wanting to see how he would react.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Heavenly Emperor Distantbook’s mindset is really shallow. Don’t you understand what’s called outstanding disciples come from an accomplished master?”

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook smiled and said, “Oh? How outstanding?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “More outstanding than you.”

Everyone shushed, this smell of gunpowder was too thick.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook did not care and said smilingly, “This emperor’s grand-pupil, Zou Rui, is the number one person in the young generation, how does Second Sage think your disciple is compared to him?”

As they said, a small chunk on the light screen turned black, two figures appeared on the plaza once more.

It was none other than precisely Zou Rui!

It turned out that he actually already won.

In this short while where they were just talking, a medicinal pill was not even refined completely yet and he actually won already.

On the viewing platform, a wave of exclamations came over.

Clearly, even the group of ancestors were extremely surprised.

His opponent had his head lowered, appearing very dispirited.

When Heavenly Emperor Distantbook saw this scene, he looked towards Ye Yuan meaningfully but discovered that Ye Yuan was completely aloof and indifferent.

“How is it, Second Sage?” Heavenly Emperor Distantbook smiled and said.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Nothing much! This grand-pupil of yours doesn’t have the minimal devoutness toward Alchemy Dao; nothing to fear.”

Zou Rui crushed his opponent in terms of strength, making his opponent directly give up on the competition.

The medicinal pill was not yet refined completely at all.

This kind of action that was a wanton waste of God’s good gifts was looked down on by Ye Yuan.

Heavenly Emperor Distantbook smiled and said, “I command spirit medicines with my Dao. Why is there a need to be devout?”

Ye Yuan said, “Myriad lives have spirit. Only if you respect it will it respect you!”
