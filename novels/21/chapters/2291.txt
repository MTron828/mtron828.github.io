Chapter 2295: Five Formations Chain!

“Void spirit Nine Apertures Heavenly Dust Pill!”

“Void spirit Zheng Yi Imperial Extreme Pill!”

... ...

Very soon, the other four people also completed the refinement one after another.

With one medicinal pill after another coming out of the furnace, one wave after another of high tide stirred up all around.

The medicinal pills that these five people refined were actually all void spirit divine pills!

Of course, in terms of quality, it was still Zhao Zixuan’s that was the best, slightly winning the others by a notch.

Furthermore, the moment the few medicinal pills came out of the furnace, they were bought by Fang Tianren at a high price.

Bright Mirror Pavilion was clearly loaded as hell, five medicinal pills directly cost him close to 15 billion superior-grade divine essence stones.

One had to know, a superior-grade divine essence stone was equivalent to ten thousand high-grade divine essence stones.

This number was already an astronomical figure.

However, void spirit divine-grade rank eight divine pills, as long as it was sold, he could make a big killing.

After all, Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were mostly not short of money. As long as there were good medicinal pills, they were willing to spend this money.

It was just that rank eight divine pills were too hard to come across, they had nowhere to buy it even if they had money too. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Second Sage, the few of us have served as a modest spur so that others may come forward with more valuable contributions. It’s your turn now! With so many people are watching, you shouldn’t let them down, right?” Zhao Zixuan said with a smug look.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said, “Mn, the few of you should still have spirit medicines on hand, right?”

Rank eight spirit medicines were all extremely precious, a stalk of spirit medicine would definitely be used to the utmost extent.

Zhao Zixuan smiled coldly and said, “Naturally have, Second Sage wants to refine, we’ll naturally offer it up with both hands.”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said, “Can’t take your things for free. Otherwise, after the medicinal pills are refined, wouldn’t you all take advantage of it for free?”

The spirit medicines came from the five of them, logically speaking, the ownership of the medicinal pills should be theirs. Ye Yuan naturally would not let them get off cheaply for nothing.

Zhao Zixuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Does that mean that Second Sage is going to buy them?”

Ye Yuan ignored him. Walking in front of Mu Tiesheng, he said coolly, “You pay this sum of money, and then the medicinal pills refined belong to you. Are you willing or not?”

Mu Tiesheng was stunned, there was actually still such a good thing?

Just as he was hesitating, Fang Tianren ridiculed again, “Hurry up and agree to it! Second Sage taking action, it will definitely be even higher than void spirit grade, such a good thing, there won’t be this shop after passing by this village! Hahaha ...”

Done talking, Fang Tianren burst into laughter.

Compared to finished medicinal pills, the cost of spirit medicines was naturally not much.

But the likelihood of Ye Yuan successfully refining the five medicinal pills was negligible.

If the quality was also not high, it would be tantamount to him doing a loss-making deal.

However, Fang Tianren’s mocking smile deeply triggered him.

Mu Tiesheng gritted his teeth and said with a cold smile, “Buddha needs incense, and a man needs self-respect! I’ll buy it. I am not scared! Second Sage, I, Mu Tiesheng, will bet on this!”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “A very wise choice!”

Fang Tianren laughed loudly and said, “Indeed a win-win cooperation, impressive, impressive!”

In the end, Mu Tiesheng spent 1.5 billion superior-grade divine essence stones and bought the spirit medicines for the five types of spirit medicines from the five people’s hands.

At this time, Zhao Zixuan suddenly opened his mouth and said, “With Second Sage’s status, I’m afraid his medicinal cauldron should be a Dao artifact, right? Can you take it out and let us broaden our horizons?”

He naturally knew that Ye Yuan did not have a Dao artifact on him, and so he was intentionally squeezing Ye Yuan.

How could Dao artifacts be what anybody could have?

The medicinal cauldrons on them, those were all top-grade existences, everyone envious of it.

The exalted Second Sage could not very well lose to them in medicinal cauldron.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Medicinal cauldron? What’s that? Only trash like you will treat a medicinal cauldron like a treasure.”

Zhao Zixuan burst out laughing when he heard that and said, “No medicinal cauldron, can you still magick medicinal pills out of thin air? Second Sage, indeed well-deserving of being Second Sage, broadening our horizons!”

“Hahaha ...”

A wave of guffaws came from all around.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan made a move.

It was only to see him lightly tap the void. An elementary form of a grand array was currently being sketched out rapidly.

As Ye Yuan constructed the array formation, he sent spirit medicines into the array formation, his movements incomparably swift.

“Formation Dao Pill Refinement! He ... He’s actually using Formation Dao to refine rank eight divine pills!”

“What a profound array formation! I totally can’t understand what he’s doing!”

“This ... These five kinds of medicinal pills don’t have records of Formation Dao Pill Refinement at all! Can he ... really refine rank eight divine pills?”

... ...

After experiencing initial shock, everyone started doubting again one after another.

After all, using Formation Dao to refine rank eight divine pills was what many ancestors could not accomplish either.

Formation Dao and Alchemy Dao were two completely different Great Daos.

Especially reaching rank eight divine pill this level, the grand array needed to be used was too complicated. Ordinary alchemists could not develop it at all.

Hence, after seeing Ye Yuan refining pills with Formation Dao, everyone’s first reaction was them being surprised.

And the second reaction was disbelief!

Zhao Zixuan sneered and said, “Courting people’s favor by doing something sensational! The difficulty of these five kinds of medicinal pills is extremely high. Furthermore, they are extremely obscure, it’s simply impossible to use Formation Dao to refine them!”

However, he did not understand what was the source of Formation Dao.

The so-called source of Formation Dao was standing from the angle of the source, to analyze the array formation.

Only knowing Alchemy Dao source and not knowing Formation Dao source, it would naturally be impossible to refine pills.

Only knowing Formation Dao source and not understanding Alchemy Dao source, one would similarly not be able to refine it.

However, how many people in this Heavenspan World could be the same as Ye Yuan, comprehending two great powers of source at the same time?

The array formation that Ye Yuan set up became more and more complicated. He kept sending spirit medicines into the array formation to refine unceasingly.

Furthermore, the spirit medicines that he sent in did not start from the Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill but appeared rather disorderly and unsystematic.

Sometimes, what he sent in were the spirit medicines of the Seven Treasures Blood Congealing Pill; at other times, what he sent in were the spirit medicines of the Zheng Yi Imperial Extreme Pill. All in all, it was disorderly.

When everyone saw this scene, they revealed a disdainful look even more.

Even if it was Formation Dao Pill Refinement, how could it be refined like this?

It was simply neither here nor there!

Fang Tianren laughed loudly when he saw the situation and said, “Hahaha ... a fine ‘a man needs self-respect’! Mu Tiesheng, I want to see how you earn this self-respect! The way he’s doing it, your 1.5 billion will all go down the drain! What dogfart Second Sage, complete baloney!”

Mu Tiesheng’s expression was livid, his heart sinking to rock-bottom. Suddenly, he had a feeling of being played.

Ye Yuan doing it like this, he was really going to lose everything!

Not only was this Second Sage unworthy of the title, but he was also simply full of shit!

How could he have been blind and bet on him?

Facing Fang Tianren’s mocking, he actually could not find any words to refute it.

Helpless, he could only heave a sigh and planned on turning around and leaving.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan’s formation Dao also neared its end already.

“Five formations chain, formations arise! Pill condense!”

Suddenly, Ye Yuan shouted loudly. This massive formation finally started operating fully.

For a moment, light shone brilliantly!

That blinding light shot straight into the sky, dazzling everyone until they could not open their eyes.

That terrifying undulation could be heard audibly throughout Cloudheart City.

A grand array that refined five medicinal pills at the same time, how shocking was the commotion?

Everyone opened their mouths wide, looking at that large formation in amazement, struck dumb with amazement.

They seemed to have forgotten about time. After the light dissipated, five crystal clear medicinal pills were suspended in the air quietly.
