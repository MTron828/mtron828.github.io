Chapter 2598: Taken Over by Me!

In the Land of Exile, no one would look at how your cultivation realm was.

Because here, for someone to jump realms in a battle, it was too normal!

A grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven being finished off by an upper Lesser Sublime Heaven, this sort of thing was very common.

In fact, there were even precedents of grand completion powerhouses being finished off by middle Lesser Sublime Heavens!

As for the sovereigns of these ten great cities, they had practically reached the limits of Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum already.

As long as they were willing, they could break through to Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum at any time.

But ascending to the next level, they could only be the small fries.

Therefore, they would rather not ascend.

But it was said that these ten people’s combat power already rivaled Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratums.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “Okay, then take me to Resplendent Sun City.”

Liang Wen and the rest naturally did not dare to refuse and could only bring Ye Yuan into Resplendent Sun City.

This place originally did not have a city. Later on, the number of people who were captured increased, giving birth to all kinds of factions.

Hence, there were gradually cities.

This place did not have too many rules; a big fist was the absolute principle.

Regarding this point, Ye Yuan had already heard about it before coming.

Entering the city, Ye Yuan immediately attracted the attention of countless people.

“Eh,?it’s an outsider! Looking at his appearance, he seems like a Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s disciple.?Heh heh,?boy, just came out to experience the world, right? To actually dare swagger your way into the city like this, hand over the items on your body …”

Pffft!

A grand completion level powerhouses saw Ye Yuan and thought that he was easy to bully, so he came up to show off and posture.

In the end, before he finished talking, he was split apart by Liang Wen with one slash.

Liang Wen spat and said disdainfully, “Hand over your ass! Damn blind thing, to actually dare offend His Excellency! What are you looking at? Get lost to one side, keep posturing and the outcome will be the same as him!”

He was somewhat doubtful. Was this fool stupid or not?

Liang Wen was following behind like a grandson, and yet he actually dared to come up and posture.

Sure enough, a saber swinging down, the world became quiet.

Everyone looked toward Ye Yuan with looks of surprise, extremely shocked.

Liang Wen was Resplendent Sun City’s bit shot, an existence whose strength ranked in the top 30.

If even he became a follower, this Martial Secure Heavenly Sect disciple was so impressive!

“Which place has the most people?” Ye Yuan asked.

Liang Wen hurriedly moved closer and said, “Resplendent Sun Plaza!”

“Lead the way!”

Liang Wen trotted to the front and led the way for Ye Yuan.

Before long, they arrived at an open square.

Ye Yuan swept a glance and discovered that there were indeed streams of people on the plaza, and was quite satisfied.

Under Liang Wen’s puzzled gaze, Ye Yuan slowly walked towards the center of the plaza. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

His subordinate had a puzzled look on his face and asked, “Big Brother Wen, this guy is being secretive. What does he want to do?”

Liang Wen rolled his eyes and said crossly, “How would I know? However, our little lives are saved at any rate!”

The subordinates had looks of approval on their faces, feeling like they had just made a trip to and fro the gates of hell.

And right at this time, Ye Yuan arrived at the center of the square and said loudly, “From now on, Resplendent Sun City will be taken over by me! Within three days, the top 100 powerhouses in the city who don’t come and submit, will be killed without mercy!”

Ye Yuan’s voice was akin to a bolt out of the blue, reverberating throughout the entire Resplendent Sun City.

When Liang Wen and the rest heard it, they could not help being stunned.

Terrific fellow! This was really domineering!

“What is he saying? I didn’t hear it wrongly, right?”

“This boy is probably a lunatic who turned silly from cultivation, right?”

“Did he come to train or seek death??Huhu,?what a joke!”

… …

A series of ridiculing voices came over from the plaza. Regarding Ye Yuan’s declaration, no one felt that it was very domineering, they just found it funny.

Over the years, there were some who challenged city lords, and also those who challenged the top ten powerhouses.

But no one dared to challenge the top 100 powerhouses so arrogantly at the same time.

The top 100 represented the entire Resplendent Sun City!

This person was declaring war on the entire Resplendent Sun City!

This was not domineering, this was courting death!

“Hahaha,?Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s punk, do you feel that the Land of Exile is too boring, and specially came to make jokes? I’m Resplendent Sun City’s 85th place Jiao Duo. I won’t submit to you. Try killing me for me to see!” Jiao Duo said with a loud laugh.

In the crowd, Liang Wen rolled his eyes and said, “Idiot!”

Sure enough, his voice had yet to fade, only to see a streak of cold light flash past.

Jiao Duo was decapitated!

From start to end, Ye Yuan did not even look at him.

The loud laughter abruptly stopped.

They could not laugh anymore, this guy’s strength was too horrifying!

“This … This … How can he be this strong? Is he really a sect disciple?”

“When did Martial Secure Heavenly Sect produce such a monster?”

“No wonder he dared to be so arrogant. It turns out that he really had his reliance! It’s just that, he probably doesn’t know about the terror of the Land of Exile yet, right?”

… …

Ye Yuan’s strength made everyone incredibly alarmed and terrified.

But while they were surprised, they did not agree with Ye Yuan’s approach.

The guys who were ranked higher, their strength became more terrifying.

Killing Jiao Duo with a single sword, the top 20 powerhouses could all accomplish it.

However, this also showed that Ye Yuan was equipped with the strength of the top 20.

In the crowd, Liang Wen did not immediately come out to express surrender.

He knew that someone would come very soon.

The Land of Exile was such a bloody place. If you dared to come forward, you would be killed!

Let alone someone as arrogant as Ye Yuan?

According to Liang Wen’s estimation, Ye Yuan’s strength was far from just top 20, he definitely had the strength of top 10!

It was just that which ranking in the top 10 was hard to say.

Therefore, he was waiting to see.

Stepping forward at this time to submit, if Ye Yuan lost, he would be screwed!

Having lived in the Land of Exile for so long, one naturally had to know the way of protecting personal interest and staying out of trouble.

Those who did not understand it had long turned cold.

“Huhu,?Resplendent Sun City really hasn’t been so lively for a long time! Now, any random Tom, Dick, or Harry, dare to jump out!” At this time, a figure walked out of the crowd.

“It’s the 19th place Quickblade, Qiu Chengzhi!?Heh,?there’s a show to watch now!”

The moment this person appeared, he was immediately identified by people.

Ye Yuan did not even look up and said coolly, “Do you choose to submit, or die?”

The moment Qiu Chengzhi heard, he was amused.

He laughed and said, “I choose, you die!”

Amidst the laughter, his blade was already out of its sheath!

People only saw things in a blur, unable to see the trajectory of the blade at all.

The name of Quickblade was displayed in its entirety at this moment.

“His blade became faster!” Liang Wen exclaimed.

However, in the next second, everyone was petrified!

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Sparks from metal clashing continuously set off in the space around Ye Yuan.

Only to see Qiu Chengzhi’s figure moving around constantly.

While Ye Yuan did not move a muscle from beginning to end!

He did not even make a move!

Rays of sword energy wandered around Ye Yuan non-stop.

In an instant, Qiu Chengzhi had moved no idea to how many locations and unleashed god knows how many cuts.

But, he could not get close at all!

Liang Wen’s eyes were full of astonishment.

The subordinate said in shock, “B-Big Brother Wen, this guy is also too monstrous, right? Quickblade Qiu Chengzhi actually can’t even force him to make a move?”

Liang Wen smiled bitterly and said, “That’s aura perception! He doesn’t need to take action at all. As long as Qiu Chengzhi enters his domain, there will be sword energy exchanging blows with him of its own accord!”
