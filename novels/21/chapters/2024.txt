Chapter 2028: A Wager

The group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods all fell into rumination.

Even Empyrean Purplewing was also recollecting the aftertaste of Ye Yuan’s words previously.

Ye Yuan’s view was extremely profound, enlightening them greatly.

The exchange of Alchemy Dao lay here.

But the current Ye Yuan was already in mayhem inside his mind, unfolding a terrifying brainstorm.

Just like that, the entire space fell into silence.

No idea how long had passed either, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes. The others were all stirred.

“Is there a result, Grandmaster Ye?” Empyrean Lumen’s eyes lit up and he asked curiously.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “This Ye deduced and found that three proposals have the highest likelihood. As for which formula is the most suitable, we need to refine them before we can know for sure.”

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan with amazed faces, incredulity written all over their faces.

They all, this bunch of Seven-star Alchemy Gods, researched for a month and only supplement one type of spirit medicine. Furthermore, it was even wrong.

Just two days had passed and he came up with three proposals?

Empyrean Lumen hurriedly said, “Grandmaster Ye, please quickly say!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “There are many spirit medicines containing speed-attribute. But those able to conform to the four types of spirit medicines, there are only a few hundred types. After this Ye deduced, I finally confirmed these three proposals. The first, Xun Foliage, Deersoul Youngheart Fruit, and Thousand Maple Vine. The second, Fire Luan Grass, Windcry Grus, and Unity Heart Brilliant Fruit. The third, Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit, Crimsonwind Swordtooth Grass, and Illusory Glass Cardamom.”

As Ye Yuan said, the group of Seven-star Alchemy Gods immediately deduced rapidly in their heads.

These were all major powers, whether or not the spirit medicines Ye Yuan said were somewhat interesting, they would be able to tell very soon.

But Zheng Qiyuan gave a cold snort and said, “Utter nonsense! Deersoul Youngheart Fruit is a wood-attribute spirit medicine, Fire Luan Grass is a fire-attribute spirit medicine, and the Thundercloud Immortal Condensing Fruit is a thunder-attribute spirit medicine. But you’re using them to be core ingredients. It’s simply matching a donkey’s head to a horse’s mouth.”

Empyrean Purplewing snorted coldly and said, “How can this kind of pairing possibly refine the Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill? Kid, could it be that you were showing off to us earlier?”

The other Empyreans also revealed doubtful looks. Clearly, they were very much in agreement with Zheng Qiyuan’s way of saying things.

The favorable impression that was just established toward Ye Yuan immediately evaporated into thin air.

These three kinds of situations that Ye Yuan talked about could not possibly refine the Seven Treasure Cloud Wind Pill at all.

Even Empyrean Lumen also had tightly locked brows, clearly very perplexed.

At this time, Ye Yuan also felt a fire rose in his heart.

Even a clay bodhisattva had some anger. This Zheng Qiyuan targeted him time and again; did he really take Ye Yuan to be a soft persimmon?

It was only to see him look at Zheng Qiyuan with a smile that was not a smile, opening his mouth and saying, “If the medicinal pill is refined using these three proposals, what will you do?”

Zheng Qiyuan’s expression turned stiff and he said, “That’s impossible!”

Ye Yuan sneered and said, “Is that so? Shut your mouth up for me if you don’t have the guts. Nobody will take you to be a mute!”

How could Zheng Qiyuan endure such provocation? He said in a cold voice, “If it can’t be refined, what will you do?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If it can’t be refined, I’ll immediately hand over the grandmaster token, pack up my things and leave, never to refine a pill again in this lifetime! Don’t say that this Ye is bullying you. If you lose, your Zheng Family will withdraw from the Cloudpill Summit henceforth. Do you dare to bet or not?”

Zheng Qiyuan’s face changed, clearly being frightened by Ye Yuan’s wager.

The Zheng Family withdrawing from the Cloudpill Summit was equivalent to being isolated by the entire Southern Border alchemy world.

This would be a tremendous blow to the Zheng Family. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The others all looked at Zheng Qiyuan in great shock and discovered that he was squeezed until his complexion was livid.

When Empyrean Lumen saw the situation, he hurriedly stepped forward to be a mediator, saying, “Huhu, everyone is a man of the same occupation. Why is there a need to make this wager and hurt feelings?”

Ye Yuan sneered coldly and said, “Ever since this Ye came here, he, Zheng Qiyuan, has provoked me time and again. Really take this Ye to be easy to bully? Heh, really think that this Ye is young and ignorant? Those little bastards of your Zheng Family are unconvinced and went in front of you to lodge a complaint, saying that I’m not worthy of this position of grandmaster, saying that this Ye challenging you is conceited and arrogant. Therefore, that’s why you made things difficult in all respects. Isn’t that so?”

Zheng Qiyuan’s complexion was incomparably ugly, full of embarrassment after being exposed.

The other Empyreans were also very surprised, not expecting that there were actually still so many twists and turns in-between.

No wonder Zheng Qiyuan was put off by Ye Yuan. It turned out that he felt that Ye Yuan swept away the Zheng Family’s face.

Empyrean Purplewing’s brows furrowed, and he said with a cold smile, “Brother Zheng, messing around for half a day, you were using this Empyrean as an excuse huh!”

Ever since taking part in this exchange meet, Zheng Qiyuan would always incite by the side, saying that Ye Yuan snatched away his position of grandmaster and so forth.

Messing around for a long time, he was finding ground for himself and deliberately making things difficult for Ye Yuan!

Zheng Qiyuan’s face changed slightly and he hurriedly explained: “That ... That was merely children quarreling. I genuinely feel wronged for Brother Purplewing!”

Ye Yuan smiled coldly and said, “Whether it’s sincere or a pretense, it’s also fine. This pill formula can naturally explain everything. I just ask you, dare to bet or not?”

One sentence forced Zheng Qiyuan to the corners of the wall.

Zheng Qiyuan did not expect that a little brat was actually so astute, directly putting him on the opposite of all the Empyreans.

At this time, he had no choice but to agree to it.

Zheng Qiyuan gritted his teeth and said in a cold voice, “Bet away! Will this Empyrean be scared of you? This Empyrean doesn’t believe that with a different attribute you can still refine a wind-attribute medicinal pill!”

Ye Yuan turned to Empyrean Lumen and said coolly, “Brother Lumen, I’ll have to trouble you for this pill testing.”

Previously, Ye Yuan did not bother with Zheng Qiyuan the entire time. Empyrean Lumen even thought that Ye Yuan did not want to offend Zheng Qiyuan. Who knew that he did a full display of his abilities and keen edge the moment he made his move.

Ye Yuan was using his alchemy profession to wager with the Zheng Family!

Did this kid really have so much confidence?

Was he arrogant at heart and haughty in manner? Or did he really have a well-thought-out plan?

As for to what extent Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao attainments were, everyone did not doubt it anymore.

That bout of discussion previously was absolutely not what a layman could say.

Just based on those, Ye Yuan had the qualifications to sit and debate Dao with them.

But just as Zheng Qiyuan said, Ye Yuan’s chances of winning were very low.

They were all alchemy big shots. They naturally understood the characteristics of spirit medicines. What Zheng Qiyuan said was not wrong.

“Sigh, really going to cause a scene to this extent? Forget it, forget it. Since that’s the case, let’s test the pill formulas then,” Empyrean Lumen said helplessly.

At this time, the two people were diametrically opposed and it was clearly unable to be resolved anymore. Urging anymore was also useless.

This place was also a large-scale refining room.

As for these rank seven spirit medicines that were normally hard to lay eyes on, they could naturally be gathered in the Cloudpill Summit.

Before long, three sets of spirit medicines were placed in front of everyone,

The first one gathered Xun Foliage, Deersoul Youngheart Fruit, and Thousand Maple Vine. after Empyrean Lumen prepared for a while, he started refining the pill.

Ye Yuan’s mind was very focused, fully on Empyrean Lumen’s pill refinement, as if the wager did not have the slightest thing to do with him.

Empyrean Lumen was indeed worthy of being a grandmaster of his generation. His alchemy strength astounded all around. Even Ye Yuan also had a rare feeling of admiration.

Only this realm of powerhouse had the qualifications to debate on Dao with him!

But, after four hours, a puff suddenly came from inside the medicinal cauldron.

Failed!
