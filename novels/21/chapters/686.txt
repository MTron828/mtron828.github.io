Chapter 690: Wait for Me in the Divine Realm!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Regarding Zhou Yan’s threat, Ye Yuan did not have too much of an indication.

His mind stirred, and he let Ye Qing out.

“Ye Qing, Li-er needs some Azure Spirit Heart Fusing Fluid,” Ye Yuan said to Ye Qing.

“Oh, here.”

Ye Qing took out some Azure Spirit Heart Fusing Fluid very generously but became very vigilant against the Zhou Yan whose depths could not be perceived.

Ye Yuan received the Azure Spirit Heart Fusing Fluid and came right in front of Yue Mengli, saying, “Thank you very much for your life-saving grace. However . . . I assure you, this is the last time! Open up!”

Yue Mengli took a look at Ye Yuan, opening her mouth very obediently.

Ye Yuan did not say much. He just poured the Azure Spirit Heart Fusing Fluid into her mouth.

The Azure Spirit Heart Fusing Fluid entered her abdomen, but Yue Mengli’s divine soul which was being torn just now became much better off. Her expression also became rosy.

From start to end, Ye Yuan’s expression was calm.

But Yue Mengli knew that Zhou Yan’s actions earlier had thoroughly infuriated Ye Yuan.

Perhaps in Zhou Yan’s eyes, Ye Yuan was only an aboriginal. But Yue Mengli knew that he possessed even more heaven-defying talent that the Divine Realm’s geniuses.

Today’s setback would only make Ye Yuan rise up more quickly.

Zhou Yan took all of this into his eyes but did not stop anything.

He was no fool. Earlier, after Yue Mengli employed the power of the Moonlight Heavenly Eye, her entire person became worn-out, and her complexion became very pale.

Drinking the Azure Spirit Heart Fusing Fluid that Ye Yuan brought over at this time, Yue Mengli’s complexion immediately became much better.

Looks like Yue Mengli seemed to have really gotten some disease and was unable to make use of the power of the Moonlight Heavenly Eye.

At this moment, he could not help believing Yue Mengli’s words a little more.

“Boy, I’m speaking to you. Didn’t you hear?” Ye Yuan’s disregard made Zhou Yan feel very enraged.

In his view, when Ye Yuan faced him, it should be trembling in fear and trepidation, even kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy.

Yet, Ye Yuan’s reaction was too quiet. Quiet until . . . it made him actually get a little indescribably flustered!

This sort of feeling was seriously too bizarre.

Ye Yuan still did not pay attention to Zhou Yan. He turned his head and said to Ye Qing, “Ye Qing, from today onwards, you’ll go to the Divine Realm together with Li-er! Remember, you mustn’t let her out of your sight!”

Ye Qing was very ignorant about worldly affairs. But he had also detected that the present atmosphere was kind of odd.

This young man in front of him was too powerful!

He had already evolved to Tier 7 but still felt that the other party was unfathomable.

Seeing Ye Yuan say it solemnly, Ye Qing nodded and said, “You set your mind at ease. What I promised you, I’ll definitely accomplish it!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head. Although the time they stayed together was not long, he was still very trusting of Ye Qing.

Following that, Ye Yuan suddenly turned his head around and said to Zhou Yan, “Carefully put away that arrogance of yours! If you want the Yue Family and Zhou Family to have an all-out war, you can feel free to kill me now!”

Zhou Yan’s expression changed, and he said with a snicker, “What a laughable aboriginal! Do you think that you can make this young master scared with a few words?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Not only does Li-er possess the Moonlight Heavenly Eye Physique, but she’s also even burdened with the Innate Battle Soul Physique! You killing me is equal to ruining the only hope the Yue Family has to rise up! Do you think that the Yue Family will have an all-out war with your Zhou Family or not?”

“What Innate Battle Soul Physique? Truly absurd nonsense!”

Even in the Divine Realm, the Innate Battle Soul Physique was only known by an extremely small number of people as well.

And this extremely small number of people clearly did not include Zhou Yan.

Ye Yuan sneered coldly when he heard that and said, “Ignorant and ill-informed! You can go back and ask Zhou Jia what the Innate Battle Soul Physique is! Even though Quan Xingzi that fellow is a little pedantic, he can still discern the Innate Battle Soul Physique!”

A terrifying aura undulated out. Zhou Yan had yet to make a move, and the entire space actually started to warp!

“How can an aboriginal like you dare to address my father’s name directly without honorifics?” Zhou Yan said it word by word.

Ye Yuan felt like he was almost suffocating. But his face still had an indifferent look as he said nonchalantly, “People adopt names to be called. What do I call him if not Zhou Jia? If you have the capabilities, kill me right now. Otherwise . . . put that away for me!”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Yue Mengli was so anxious that her heart was almost about to leap out.

She really did not expect that Ye Yuan actually dared to incite Zhou Yan like this.

Once Zhou Yan really got angry, even at her prime, she could not stop him too.

Ye Yuan’s pride was even above her expectations!

Facing Zhou Yan this sort of peerless powerhouse, Yue Mengli thought that Ye Yuan would have some restraint and tolerate for some time.

Who knew that Ye Yuan did not have the intention of tolerating at all, but chose to give tit for tat!

Zhou Yan’s expression flickered erratically. The entire space started twisting and warping under his aura.

He was seriously unable to tolerate an aboriginal actually being so insolent in front of him.

But if what Ye Yuan said was true, he really could not handle the two families having an all-out war, this sort of thing.

The Divine Realm’s various forces mutually restricted each other and could not tolerate the slightest bit of mistake.

Even his father, Zhou Jia, also tread as if on thin ice.

Suddenly, the aura on Zhou Yan’s body was put away, and he said with Ye Yuan with a cold voice, “Today, I’ll spare your little life on account of Li-er’s face! Wait until we return to the Divine Realm, we’ll naturally know if what you said is true or false! At that time, you wouldn’t be able to fly away even if you had wings!”

Finished talking, Zhou Yan suddenly unleashed the Vastsun Flameheart Pupil!

Boom!

Ye Yuan was sent flying out directly, spewing out a mouthful of blood once more.

“Ye Yuan!” Yue Mengli and Ye Qing cried out in a chorus.

“Relax, he won’t die! I just planted the Vastsun Flameheart Pupil’s mark on his body. If there are other people who can treat your illness, he naturally doesn’t have the need to remain in this world anymore! Li-er, we should go!” Zhou Yan said coldly.

Finished talking, Zhou Yan rend with one hand and actually broke apart space directly, manifesting a huge door.

Yue Mengli was worried about Ye Yuan’s safety, but Zhou Yan did not give her time to stay.

Ye Yuan clutched his chest and stood up. Gasping for air, he said, “Relax, I won’t die! Wait for me in the Divine Realm!”

Yue Mengli had tears running down her face as she nodded her hand and following Zhou Yan into the spatial passageway.

Ye Qing gave Ye Yuan a glance rather worriedly and said somberly, “Take care, Ye Yuan!”

After the three people entered the spatial passageway, that huge door disappeared along with it too, as if Zhou Yan had never appeared before. Ye Yuan stared at the space which had already recovered back to how it was and was silent for a long time.

“My lord, are you alright?”

“My lord, you . . . you’re injured!”

“Who is it? To actually be able to heavily wound His Excellency?”

Chu Shi and the rest had an after-sensation and felt that this place seemed to have some activities, so they hurried over. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Who knew that upon looking, Ye Yuan was actually beaten to severe injuries and they could not help turning pale with fright.

They all knew Ye Yuan’s strength now. To be able to beat Ye Yuan until like this and cause such a small commotion, how powerful a strength did the other party have to have?

Being struck by the Vastsun Flameheart Pupil in succession, Ye Yuan was also faint and weak at this time.

“I-It’s fine. Help me to the hidden chamber! The army, postpone departure for three days!”
