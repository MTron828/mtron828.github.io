Chapter 3085: Yi Xue!

“What did you say? Six Great Beyond powerhouses actually appeared in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven in one go? How is this possible?”

Chaos Bloodstone was incomparably shocked when he heard about Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s war situation.

A Great Beyond powerhouse was a mobile nuclear weapon.

Before acquiring the four great true spirit bloodlines, even he could not create so many Great Beyond powerhouses too.

But now, six Great Beyonds actually appeared in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. How could he not be surprised?

Yi Xue nodded and said, “Originally, the war was going very smoothly. But I didn’t expect that we would meet with stubborn resistance in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. Now, Mi Tian has led Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and has already pursued us across three worlds!”

Yi Xue was the blood race’s strongest person up to now.

His strength was also top-notch among Great Beyond powerhouses.

The Chaos Bloodstone’s clone was severely wounded, and he could not move out for the time being. Yi Xue was the subordinate that he relied most heavily on.

The Chaos Bloodstone said in a solemn voice, “Being able to give birth to six mighty Great Beyond powerhouses within a few short years, only the Heaven volume can accomplish it! But, even if Ye Yuan has the Heaven volume, he can’t shoulder so many people comprehending at the same time too! How on earth did this boy do it?”

Yi Xue said, “After I received the news, I already sent people to investigate it. It turns out that Ye Yuan set up a grand array and drew the power of the Eternal River’s chaos to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, and used the power of the Eternal River’s chaos, supplying them to cultivate the Heaven volume.”

The Chaos Bloodstone was shocked again and said, “This boy is really a genius! Others are all comprehending chaos, but he is already making use of chaos! Yi Xue, this boy can’t be kept alive. You make a trip! When necessary, use the Bloodcloud Grand Array!”

Yi Xue gave a bow and said, “Yes!”

… . .

“Lord Wang Zuo, didn’t you come to kill me? You’ve already crossed four worlds now. Why are you still running away?”

Above the sky, Ye Yuan’s voice spread for thousands of miles, shocking the sky.

In front, Bloodooze and the rest were anxious like dogs that lost their homes, but they did not even dare to turn their heads back.

The army charged out of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, chasing after the blood race army. They had already crossed four worlds!

During this, Mi Tian and the others killed two more blood race Great Beyond powerhouses.

The blood race army was already in a hot mess.

At this time, Bloodooze and the rest gathered another five Great Beyond powerhouses. But they did not even have the courage to have a battle.

Mi Tian and the rest were too strong. Without ten Great Beyond powerhouses, they did not even need to think about it.

Furthermore, Bloodooze himself was also seriously injured and could not fight at all.

“Ye Yuan punk, don’t you be arrogant! Do you think that my blood race only has this bit of strength? After Progenitor knows about the news here, he’ll definitely send even stronger powerhouses. At that time, you just wait to stretch your neck out for the executer’s blade!” Bloodooze lost in reality but did not lose in disposition as he roared angrily.

“Is that so? Then I’ll wait for him to come. But, when are you planning to run until? Continue fleeing and the 33 Heavens will learn about Lord Wang Zuo’s awe-inspiring reputation!”

Bloodooze nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood. When their group was fleeing, it shocked heaven and earth. The target was too big.

Now, wherever they passed through, virtually everyone knew where they had been.

Their faces had nowhere to put anymore.

The blood race swept across the 33 Heavens. In the end, they were swept away by Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven now.

Suddenly, the void trembled. A figure stepped out.

The arrival was a red-haired youth who stood with his hands behind his back.

When Mi Tian saw him, he immediately made a hand gesture, and everyone stopped.

This red-haired youth actually gave him a sense of oppression!

One had to know, ever since comprehending the Universe scroll, his strength advanced by leaps and bounds, growing much stronger than before.

But now, this red-haired youth in front of him could actually bring pressure upon him. It could be seen that he was not ordinary.

“This person is very strong!” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan was not surprised and said, “Without some foundation, the blood race wouldn’t have dared to make all the heavens fall into a catastrophe too!”

The moment Bloodooze and the rest saw the red-haired youth, it was as if they saw their savior. They were agitated until their eyes brimmed over with hot tears.

Being pursued across four worlds, this was not a good experience.

“Lord Yi Xue, you’re finally here!” Bloodooze said excitedly.

Finished saying that, he turned to Ye Yuan again and said with a big smile, “Ye Yuan punk, you were very delighted these few days, right? Now, do you know what’s called sorrow follows extreme joy?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The winds of fortune changes. You’re so happy now. Be careful that sorrow follows extreme joy.”

Bloodooze smiled coldly and said, “That’s because you don’t know how strong Lord Yi Xue is! He is our blood race’s god of war, the number one person under Progenitor!”

Yi Xue looked at Mi Tian and slowly said, “You guys can’t get away!”

Mi Tian said coolly, “If this progenitor wants to leave, nobody can stop me!”

Yi Xue just smiled and slowly raised his arm.

Suddenly, countless bloodkins appeared in the surrounding space and from all directions!

There were even many Hegemon Realm powerhouses among them!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s army fell into a tight encirclement all at once.

When everyone saw the situation, their expressions could not help changing wildly.

“Not good! We’ve fallen into the blood race’s encirclement!”

“This … Just the Great Beyond powerhouses are as many as nine people. What to do about this?”

“We penetrated deep into enemy territory alone and were too greedy for contributions by advancing rashly!”

… . .

On Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s side, it fell into a panic at once.

Seeing the looks of despair on everyone’s faces, Bloodooze was very satisfied.

These few days had been too aggrieved!

“Hahaha,?Ye Yuan, you still want to make me feel sorrow after extreme joy now? This blood race army that covers the sky, this seat sees how you run!” Bloodooze said with a big laugh.

Yi Xue looked at Mi Tian and said coolly, “Mi Tian, I know that you comprehended the Universe volume, your strength advancing by leaps and bounds. Wanting to make you stay isn’t easy, but this time, I’ve already made full preparations. This region of space, I’ve completely locked it down with 180 Hegemon Realms! Maybe it can’t stop you, but these people that you brought, there’s absolutely not a single one that can escape!”

When everyone heard it, they could not help turning pale with fright.

They wanted to carry out a teleportation but discovered that space was already completely frozen. They were unable to teleport at all.

With this, they really panicked.

Mi Tian said, “So, you want to negotiate with me?”

Yi Xue smiled and said, “It saves effort to talk to a smart person. I only have one condition. Leave Ye Yuan behind! The others, I can let them all leave!”

“F*ck your mother! Wanting to leave Ye Yuan behind, you dream on! You’re called Yi Xue, right? Just you wait. When I, Yang Qing, step into Hegemon Realm, it will be the day that you die!” Yi Xue’s words had just dropped when Yang Qing cursed viciously to his face.

“Yeah, it’s fine if we die! Heavenly Saint Ye can’t die!”

“Heavenly Saint Ye is our Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s soul. We’re willing to fight to the death to help him escape!”

“Blood dog, you’re thinking too much! We won’t abandon him and leave!”

… . .

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s people immediately erupted with a series of responses.

Clearly, Ye Yuan was already a god-like existence in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan was their spiritual pillar!

Mi Tian looked at Yi Xue and said with a smile, “You heard that? It’s impossible to leave Ye Yuan behind! Furthermore, this progenitor doesn’t feel that you can make us stay!”

Yi Xue smiled and said, “Mi Tian, you’re too confident in yourself!”

But Mi Tian smiled and said, “Whether or not it’s self-confidence, you’ll know later! Ye Yuan, do it!”
