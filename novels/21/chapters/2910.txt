Chapter 2916: Reaping the Consequences

Ye Yuan’s origin divinity was of one body and two faces to begin with.

One was the dragon soul; the other was the divine soul.

Having obtained Divine Emergence, Ye Yuan’s both divinities cultivated it at the same time. The two origin divinities became strong on their own.

Now, each one did not lose to same rank powerhouses.

When the two combined into one, the power was even greater.

Ye Yuan condensed a long bow with soul force, bending the bow and notching an arrow!

Yan Jadetrue’s expression changed drastically!

He was too familiar with this move!

“Arrow of God Extermination!”

It was just that when Ye Yuan unleashed it now, the power could no longer be mentioned in the same breath.

“It’s still this move. This situation really deepens the impression of the past!”

Ye Yuan smiled, and the Arrow of God Extermination tore across the air.

Yan Jadetrue felt his scalp tingle, hurriedly releasing several streams of soul force, surrounding himself tightly.

This move was also an Emperor Realm inheritance. It was called Nether Shield, its defensive strength extremely strong!

Boom!

The Nether Shield instantly shattered.

Yan Jadetrue only felt his head spin, his soul body already suffering heavy injuries.

Too strong!

Circumstances changed with the passing of time. Feeling the power of this Arrow of God Extermination again, Yan Jadetrue was struck dumb with amazement!

His Nether Shield was akin to an ant in front of the Arrow of God Extermination.

“I only unleashed 30% of my power, and you already collapsed? This time, try 40%.”

Yan Jadetrue wanted to cry.

Just 30% power and he already could not withstand it; let alone talk about 40% power.

Yan Jadetrue gritted his teeth hard and said with an angry roar, “Ye Yuan, you forced me! Destruction Heavenly Blade!”

On his hand, a ring suddenly lit up. Yan Jadetrue’s soul force suddenly skyrocketed dozens of times!

And at this time, his soul force also turned ethereal, transforming into a blood-red colored long blade.

An Emperor Vast Heaven’s inheritance was naturally extraordinary.

This ring was Yan Jadetrue’s trump card!

This ring was called Soul Recall Ring, a grade three grandmist treasure!

Once it was activated, it could cause soul force to skyrocket.

And this Destruction Heavenly Blade was that Emperor Vast Heaven’s ultimate move.

The moment this blade emerged, everyone’s faces changed drastically.

Wang Jun felt this terrifying soul force undulation. This blade, even with an Emperor Realm’s origin divinity, it probably could not resist it too!

“Ancestor Ye, be careful!” Wang Jun roared loudly.

Boom!

While talking, Wang Jun was struck flying by Zhang Zuoshan with a palm. The latter laughed and said, “Unable to even fend for yourself, you still have the leisure to care about others! Do you think that Lord Soul Envoy can really be defeated by some Tom, Dick, or Harry? That kid is dead for sure!”

A trace of surprise was revealed on Ye Yuan’s face too.

But very soon, he recovered back to normal and said with a faint smile, “A little interesting!”

In the next instant, his soul force similarly soared!

In an instant, Ye Yuan’s soul force directly started to immolate.

The soul bow and soul arrow in Ye Yuan’s hands all caught on fire!

Divine Emergence mystic art, Rising From the Ashes!

Swoosh!

The Destruction Heavenly Blade and Arrow of God Extermination instantly exploded in the void.

Yan Jadetrue was akin to being struck by lightning, drifting out like a piece of paper.

His entire person instantly became much dimmer.

Clearly, his soul body had already sustained serious injuries.

Zhang Zuoshan had a dumbfounded expression on his face as if he had seen a ghost.

He had seen before with his own eyes, Lord Soul Envoy used the Destruction Heavenly Blade to slash a half-step Emperor Realm until he disintegrated.

Apparently, he was actually defeated by this little fellow from the human race?

This … This was also too fake, right?

Wang Jun had a dumbfounded look too, immediately becoming wildly ecstatic!

Ancestor Ye was indeed impressive!

“Haha,?Zhang Zuoshan, just now, who did you say was dead for sure?” Wang Jun said with a loud laugh.

Zhang Zuoshan’s face turned back. This face-slapping was also too fast, right?

At this time, Ye Yuan already arrived at Yan Jadetrue’s side, pulled the ring off Yan Jadetrue’s body, and started examining it carefully.

“This is a soul artifact? Indeed … a little interesting! Yan Jadetrue, give me this thing, alright?” Ye Yuan looked at Yan Jadetrue and said.

Yan Jadetrue gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Dream on! I’m a soul envoy now! If you dare touch a hair on me, the soul race won’t let you off! Also, this Sublime Pill Sect, you wouldn’t want to watch them die, right?”

He was confident that he understood Ye Yuan very well and knew that Ye Yuan would not leave the Sublime Pill Sect alone.

Who knew that Ye Yuan grinned, and then a streak of gloomy light was fired into Yan Jadetrue’s soul body.

“ARGH!!”

Yan Jadetrue cried out miserably, rolling around on the ground in pain.

He just felt as if hundreds of millions of ants were gnawing on his soul body.

That sort of anguish made him virtually want to end it all.

Hearing Yan Jadetrue’s miserable scream, the group of Emperor Realms could not help shuddering with fear too.

“I’ll give! I’ll give, okay?” Yan Jadetrue gave in.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If you did so earlier, wouldn’t you have suffered less physical hardship?”

While talking, his fingertips beckoned, retracting that streak of gloomy light.

Yan Jadetrue looked at Ye Yuan, filled with fear.

He originally thought that having obtained an Emperor Vast Heaven’s inheritance and sweeping across the Nirvana Soul Hall, he would definitely be able to avenge the enmity when he encountered Ye Yuan again.

Who knew that in the end, he actually still suffered a crushing defeat.

Not only was he defeated, this grade three grandmist treasure actually even had to be snatched away by Ye Yuan!

How aggrieving!

Helpless, Yan Jadetrue could only retract the Soul Recall Ring’s imprint.

Very soon, Ye Yuan became the Soul Recall Ring’s new owner.

After feeling it, with this Soul Recall Ring, if Ye Yuan’s soul force skyrocketed, he would virtually be able to rival grand completion True Sovereign Heavens!

Indeed good stuff!

Coupled with the powerful mystic arts in Deity Realm, Ye Yuan could exterminate half-step Emperor Realm soul denizens akin to retrieving an item from his own bag.

After Ye Yuan’s Twin Chaos Origin Divinities all reached grand completion True Sovereign Heaven, even if he encountered Emperor Realm powerhouses, he might not be without the strength to have a fight.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s gleeful look, Yan Jadetrue felt as awful as one could be.

Ye Yuan looked toward Yan Jadetrue and said with a smile, “Lord Soul Envoy, regarding this matter of recruitment, do you know what you should do?”

Yan Jadetrue seemed like he had eaten a fly, but he still nodded and said, “G-Got it!”

He struggled to his feet, gaze looking at Zhang Zuoshan intent as he said, “Zhang Zuoshan, the Soaring Cloud Sect from top to bottom, those above Saint Sovereign Heaven will all enter the Scarlet Drill Battlefield!”

Zhang Zuoshan’s expression changed wildly.?This… What is going on here?

Weren’t we here to get the Sublime Pill Sect?

How did it become drafting the Soaring Cloud Sect in a blink of an eye? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Furthermore, Yan Jadetrue’s words were to round up the Soaring Cloud Sect’s Sovereign Realm and above in one fell swoop!

“L-Lord Soul Envoy!”

Yan Jadetrue’s gaze turned cold, and he said in a deep voice, “What? This envoy’s words aren’t useful anymore? Do you need this envoy to send a message to my master and invite his elderly self to come over and speed things up in person?”

Hearing this, Zhang Zuoshan’s expression changed drastically.

Yan Jadetrue already acknowledged an Emperor Vast Heaven as master when he arrived at the Nirvana Soul Hall!

His master was the Nirvana Soul Hall’s elder. Not only was his strength preeminent, but his authority was also immense too.

If he were to take action, the Soaring Cloud Sect could forget about leaving behind a trace of bloodline in the end.

“I-It’s useful! Zhang Zuoshan obeys!” Zhang Zuoshan even had the heart to die.

Hearing that the soul envoy was going to conscript the Sublime Pill Sect again, Zhang Zuoshan immediately came forward on his own accord, wanting to tag along.

Trampling on the former high sect was a very satisfying thing.

But who knew that it actually entrapped the Soaring Cloud Sect!

The current Zhang Zuoshan, his intestines already turned green with regret.

“Report to the Scarlet Drill Battlefield within ten days! Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself!” Yan Jadetrue looked at Zhang Zuoshan and said coldly.
