Chapter 1897: Nine Pledge Imperial Capital

Ye Yuan was completely indifferent, but Lin Changqing felt his flesh hurt.

That was a vast spirit divine-grade Sun Moon Azure Sky Pill!

Even in Heavenly Emperor Bodhimandas, this kind of thing could be encountered but could not be hoped for too.

It was just that under this kind of circumstances, he had no choice at all.

He was an Empyrean, he originated from a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda, he had his own dignity.

No matter how much he could not bear to part with it, he also had to destroy this vast spirit divine pill!

He, Lin Changqing, could not afford to lose this face!

Of course, he was actually already disgraced enough currently.

“Humph! Do you think that this Empyrean will believe that this medicinal pill was refined by you? You were merely a little lucky!” Lin Changqing said with a livid expression.

“That’s your business, nothing to do with me. Go back and cultivate well, hope that you don’t disappoint me 2000 years later” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Lin Changqing’s expression changed, this damn fellow actually snatched his lines!

Wasn’t this kind of word said for the weak to hear by the strong?

“Still not scramming?” Could it be that you’re planning on staying behind to have a meal?” Tong’er said in a cold voice.

Lin Changqing naturally did not take Tong’er seriously. But right at this time, the Treasure Pig in his bosom suddenly opened its bleary eyes.

All of a sudden, Lin Changqing seemed to stare at by a desolate beast.

His expression changed several times. Finally, he still took a step out, figure disappearing.

Whoosh?…

Everyone all heaved a long sigh in relief.

Since Lin Changqing appeared, they did not even dare to breathe loudly.

The pressure of an Empyrean powerhouse was too fierce.

Thud!

After Lin Changqing left, Ye Yuan could not hold on anymore, fainting on the ground.

Under the finger of an Empyrean powerhouse, it was already a miracle for Ye Yuan to be able to hold on until now.

Only all the way until three days later did Ye Yuan slowly wake up.

“Big Brother, you finally woke up!” White Light said joyfully.

“You punk, you were too reckless,” Tong’er looked at Ye Yuan and said with a disdainful look.

Ye Yuan just smiled. Under those circumstances, what could he do?

It was just that in front of Heavenly Empyrean powerhouses, he was still too weak!

“2000 years to cultivate to Heavenly Empyrean Realm, boy, you also looking down on Heavenly Empyreans too much!” Tong’er said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said coolly, “2000 years should be enough.”

His cultivation was different from the others. To the others, bottlenecks were the greatest obstacle.

But Ye Yuan’s cultivation, it was comprehending Dao first, and only then cultivating.

To him, bottleneck this sort of thing did not exist.

All along, Ye Yuan would not deliberately pursue the accumulation of divine essence. Most of his energy was still placed on comprehending the Lesser Heavenspan Mountain.

Hence, when Leng Qiuling saw Ye Yuan again, that was why she would be so shocked.

Divine Lord to Celestial Deity, this hurdle was not easy to clear, even to a genius like Leng Qiuling.

But Ye Yuan cleared it easily.

Everyone was stunned, especially Tong’er.

“You punk, really wildly arrogant! I really want to see how you’re going to break through to Empyrean Realm within 2000 years. Furthermore, you have to know that he definitely came from a lineage with a Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda, it might even be a Transcendent Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda! The cultivation resources that he enjoys is what you’re unable to imagine,” Tong’err warned.

Ye Yuan gave him a glance. Suddenly, he reached his hand out and beckoned at Treasure Pig.

Swoosh!

Treasure Pig bored into Ye Yuan’s bosom very obediently, using its pig head to rub against Ye Yuan, so as to show affection.

“Heh,?all thanks to you this time. Otherwise, this life of mine would be considered done for. Tong’er, just what kind of existence is Treasure Pig?” Ye Yuan suddenly ignored Tong’er’s words and asked.

Previously, he also thought that he was dead for sure. Who knew that Treasure Pig came roaring across the horizon, sending Lin Changqing flying with a sneeze.

The shock that that scene brought to everyone was too intense.

Among them also included Ye Yuan.

Tong’er pursed his lips and said, “How would I know?”

Tong’er’s reply made Ye Yuan stunned.

Ye Yuan always thought that Treasure Pig was Tong’er’s spirit pet and that he should be very clear.

He did not expect that now he actually obtained such an answer.

“You don’t know?”

Tong’er shook his head and said, “Treasure Pig was handed down to me by the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s previous generation Spirit Medicine Empyrean. Since then, it has always been following me. As for what origin it has, I don’t know a thing. Don’t use that kind of eyes to look at me. I asked the previous general Spirit Medicine Empyrean before, but he said that he didn’t know either.”

Ye Yuan lowered his head to look at the Treasure Pig in his bosom, shocked speechless.

All along, Treasure Pig had always been mysterious.

But hearing Tong’er’s words, the mysterious feeling on Treasure Pig grew much stronger again.

“Alright, but I still have to thank you,” Ye Yuan said to Treasure Pig.

“Grunt! Grunt!”

Treasure Pig arched its head, that meaning seemed to be saying: no need to thank, refine for me more medicinal pills will do.

Ye Yuan smiled when he saw the situation and said, “Relax, the medicinal pills are definitely enough!”

“Oh,?right, Your Excellency, you make a trip to Cloudjade Imperial City, how was it?” Ning Tianping asked.

Only then did Ye Yuan recall this incident. He shook his head and said, “There’s already not a single soul there! This Rong Xiyue is likely not simple!”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ning Tianping’s face changed, and he said, “Your Excellency, I need to tell you a bad news. Just not long after you fell unconscious, Wu Tian died!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, falling silent.

This matter did not seem so simple.

Only after a while, did he say: “Come, let’s go to Nine Pledge Imperial Capital, I’m rather worried about Brother Jiang’s safety.”

…

Nine Pledge Imperial Capital was a middle-order imperial capital, it was not as prosperous as Thousand Soar Imperial Capital in terms of scale.

But an imperial capital was an imperial capital. It was far from what imperial cities could compare to.

Ye Yuan and Jiang Jadehall were on friendly terms. When chatting idly with him in the past, he had once heard Jiang Jadehall mentioned before. The Nine Pledge Imperial Capital had three major factions —- the City Lord Manor, Linghua Pavilion, as well as the Kongming Academy.

Behind these three major factions were said to all be middle-stage True God Realm powerhouses.

Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s situation was different from the Thousand Soar Imperial Capital. These three major factions contended in the dark, neither willing to submit to the others.

Of course, on the surface, it was still the City Lord Manor ruling the entire Nine Pledge Imperial Capital.

But the other two major forces also secretly controlled numerous imperial cities.

Jiang Jadehall came from the Kongming Academy, so the Southridge Ten Cities had also always been under the scope of the Kongming Academy’s power and influence.

Of course, the Southridge Ten Cities this kind of barren land, the three major factions would not care about it very much.

Hence, all along, the Southridge Ten Cities had been safe and sound. Apart from some minor conflicts, no overly major fluctuations happened before.

Jiang Jadehall, this patrolling inspector, was naturally also very comfortable.

Jiang Jadehall’s talent was not considered good. With his talent, it was already not too likely to have breakthroughs.

But he heard Jiang Jadehall say that his daughter’s talent was extremely good, stepping into Celestial Deity Realm at a young age.

Of course, this was also all thanks to Ye Yuan.

Back then, during the Golden Sword Pact, Jiang Jadehall requested Ye Yuan to help him refine the Supreme Jade Void Pill, it was for the sake of his daughter.

The matters afterward, Ye Yuan naturally heard about it before. After his daughter consumed the Supreme Jade Void Pill, she broke through to the Celestial Deity Realm very soon.

At present, Jiang Jadehall was thrown into a death cell, but it was the Linghua Pavilion’s people secretly rigging things here.

Could it be that Linghua Pavilion already colluded together with City Lord Manor and planned on joining hands to deal with Kongming Academy?

Along the way, Ye Yuan was always analyzing the sequence of events for this matter.

Thinking to and fro, this kind of possibility was extremely high.

It was just that, why would this Rong Xiyue learn of Wu Tian’s failure straight away and kill Wu Tian?
