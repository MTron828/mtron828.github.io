“Ye Yuan, your soul physique hasn’t been confirmed as the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, and you’re already this impatient to want to humiliate me? Be careful that you slap your own face!”

Qin Shitian felt a strong humiliation and immediately retorted.

He did not believe that Ye Yuan really awakened the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!

Ye Yuan was stunned and said, “Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique? You’re saying that the soul physique I awakened is the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique?”

Qin Shitian smiled coldly and said, “Not confirmed yet! It’s just that looking at it on the surface, it’s very alike. That’s all! The Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique is the number one soul physique. How can it be what you can awaken?”

Ye Yuan suddenly saw the light and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Oh, so that’s how it is! No wonder your reaction is so big. It turns out that you turned angry from embarrassment!”

“You!”

Qin Shitian nearly spewed out a mouthful of old blood.

Don’t comment if you saw through it! This guy was really detestable!

By the side, Zhou Yu and He Chen felt like their frustrations were vented, secretly satisfied to the extreme.

At this point, they could not bear the sight of Qin Shitian’s face anymore as well.

Since he came to the soul race, Ye Yuan had naturally heard Cloudmount and Mi Tian talk about this Nirvanic Soul Clan’s number one soul physique before.

It was just that he himself also did not expect that the soul physique he awakened now was actually suspected to be the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!

Didn’t that mean that this half-divided soul of his had hopes of reaching Hegemon Imperishable’s level?

“No matter whether or not what Ye Yuan awakened is the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, it’s also much stronger than ten wroughts! Shitian, how are you speaking to Lord Young Hegemon? Why haven’t you apologized?!” Right at this time, Great Emperor Eastsun gave Qin Shitian a deadly blow.

Qin Shitian’s face was embarrassed to the extreme.

He did not expect that the one who put him on the spot was actually his own master!

This face-change was really faster than flipping a book!

However, in Great Emperor Eastsun’s view, his disciple’s face was clearly not important.

The important thing was the Ning Lan Nirvana Soul Hall’s future!

Originally, to the three great hall masters, a ten wroughts soul body was absolutely a genius that made them value greatly.

But now, with Ye Yuan, Qin Shitian had become nothing.

Young Emperor, Young Hegemon; the difference of one word, but the difference was akin to heaven and earth!

Young Hegemon, that was a genius with extremely high hopes of stepping into Hegemon Realm!

The status was more than a level stronger than Young Emperor!

Zhou Yu and He Chen, two people who were really satisfied to the extremely currently.

Truly instant karma!

Just a day ago, Qin Shitian swept their faces to the ground with the status of Young Emperor.

But now, Ye Yuan made Qin Shitian unable to raise his head with the identity of Young Hegemon!

Furthermore, Qin Shitian flaunted his prowess himself.

But now, it was Great Emperor Eastsun, his own master, who personally slapped his face!

“Yes! Qin Shitian affronted Lord Young Hegemon. Please pardon my crime!” Qin Shitian gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Qin Shitian, it seems like right when we entered the hall entrance assessment, you have constantly been offending me. Why? Want to casually brush it off with a word?”

Qin Shitian’s eyes turned black, wishing to find a hole in the ground to burrow into.

Right from the beginning, he had been posturing in front of Ye Yuan.

Originally, he thought that he could take Ye Yuan down in the first round. But who could have thought that Ye Yuan actually cleared the stage in five breaths!

Originally thought that in the second round, it was already very impressive that he made it to the seventh segment. In the end, Ye Yuan cleared the stage again unhurriedly!

Originally thought that in the third round, he reached the heaven-defying ten wroughts. He could finally posture, right?

Who knew that Ye Yuan actually awakened a special soul physique? Furthermore, it was even suspected to be the number one soul physique, the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique!

From start to end, he was just a joke!

“W-What do you want?” Qin Shitian’s expression changed as he said.

But Ye Yuan looked toward Great Emperor Eastsun and said with a smile, “Lord Hall Master, I wonder if there’s any problem if I want to exterminate him now?”

Great Emperor Eastsun hesitated for a moment and said, “Lord Young Hegemon, Shitian is this seat’s disciple in the end. Can you let him off?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Lord Hall Master, how about this? You all haven’t confirmed yet, whether or not I’m of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, right? I think that Qin Shitian is also unconvinced by me, this so-called Young Hegemon. Why don’t I have a fair fight with him to determine life and death? How about it?”

Eastsun smiled bitterly and said, “Lord Young Hegemon has already awakened a special soul physique. Even if it isn’t the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, Shitian isn’t a match either.”

Ye Yuan said, “Therefore, that’s why I said a fair fight! Within ten moves, he can go all out. I won’t make any resistance! If he can kill me, that will show that I, this so-called Imperishable Soul Physique, am naturally unworthy of the title. After ten moves, if he can’t kill me, then I’ll make a move. How about it?”

“This … ”

“Okay! I agree!”

When Eastsun was still hesitating, Qin Shitian himself agreed to it.

Even until now, he also did not believe that Ye Yuan really awakened the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique.

This was considered to have been decided on it.

Great Emperor Eastsun could not come forward to intervene too.

Everyone moved aside, creating an open space. In the center of the field, there was just Ye Yuan and Qin Shitian.

The confrontation between a ten wroughts soul body and a suspected Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique also aroused everyone’s great interest.

This kind of showdown was hard to come across in a million years!

“If Ye Yuan isn’t of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique, the ten wroughts Qin Shitian might really have a possibility of killing him! I feel that Ye Yuan is too confident. How can the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique be so easy to awaken?”

“Heard that Qin Shitian mastered several killing moves in the Scarlet Drill Battlefield! Now that he has achieved ten wroughts, even if an Emperor Realm powerhouse is standing there, he has the confidence to kill him too!”

“However, if Ye Yuan is really of the Imperishable Soul Physique, then it will really shake the entire soul race!”

… …

With regards to Ye Yuan’s soul physique, there was more skepticism.

Because the legendary Imperishable Soul Physique was seriously too hard to give birth to.

Since time immemorial, God knew how many geniuses had attempted to awaken this Imperishable Soul Physique and failed to succeed.

Therefore, more still felt pessimistic about Ye Yuan.

Not moving for ten moves was sufficient to let Qin Shitian kill Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan naturally would not be foolish enough to seek death. In reality, he could feel that his soul physique was very extraordinary.

Previously, when he transformed into mist, that sort of form was very miraculous.

It was as if nothing could make him completely die.

That sort of power rooted at the bottom of his heart!

Qin Shitian looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Ye Yuan, you just quietly pray that you’re of the Enshrouding Mist Soul Physique! Otherwise, you’ll definitely die beyond doubt within ten moves!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Make your move; you really talk a lot of crap!”

Qin Shitian’s expression turned cold. Suddenly, his soul force erupted crazily.

Under ten wroughts, his soul force almost turned corporeal!

Countless black stars surrounded Ye Yuan tightly!

Zhou Yu’s expression changed, and he cried out in shock, “Star Soul Explosion! This is the killing move that Qin Shitian comprehended himself, it has boundless power! When he was at the middle True Sovereign Heaven Realm, he had once used this move to surprise attack, killing a human half-step Emperor Realm before! Now, he’s already ten wroughts. Ye Yuan isn’t guarding against him, unless …”

Unless Ye Yuan was of the Imperishable Soul Physique, he would definitely die without a doubt!

Even if he had a special soul physique, it would not do either!

Zhou Yu clearly understood Qin Shitian very well. So he did not expect that the moment Qin Shitian made his move, it was such a swift and fierce killing move.

Furthermore, looking at his appearance, he was already going all out!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Countless star souls exploded in front of Ye Yuan, releasing incomparably terrifying soul force undulations.

Ye Yuan’s soul body was bombarded until it became extremely distorted!
