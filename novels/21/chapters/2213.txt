Chapter 2217: Who Knows What the Hell He Experienced?!

Empyrean Pilljade’s expression was extremely ugly.

With Ye Yuan appearing in such a way, everyone all thought that he was already a cripple.

But who knew that he actually refined a miraculous medicinal pill and completely restored his small world!

Now, not only did Ye Yuan’s cultivation recover fully, but his strength also become a notch higher.

This made things awkward.

His gaze turned intent, and he said with a cold smile, “Even if you recovered your strength, what can you change? This show today doesn’t only have this Empyrean dictating here! Do you, a puny little Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, dare to become enemies with the entire Southern Border’s Heavenly Emperors?”

After he was done talking, he turned to Ji Mo again and said in a solemn voice, “Lord Stardrive, although you’re a demon race major power, this place is the human race boundary! Right now, our Southern Border Alliance is going to launch a general offensive towards Heavenly Eagle Imperial City. Are you really going to take action?”

These words had some meaning of forcing him out of the way.

But he believed that High Priest Stardrive definitely would not dare to risk universal condemnation.

The human race’s strength was far stronger than a mere Priest Temple.

But Ji Mo did not care at all. Instead, he waved his hand dismissively and smiled as he said, “I said that I’m just here to run an errand. Whatever you all want to do, that’s your business.”

Empyrean Pilljade’s face became blacker and blacker. The more Ji Mo said this, the more uncertain he was.

You, a major power, are here now, but you said to me that you would not care about anything!

If you did not care, I would have long thrown a slap over.

Would you allow it?

“Uh ... Right. The spirit medicines that Second Sage wants isn’t just these. After he finishes refining the medicinal pill, this emperor can also return and report completion on the mission. At that time, you all can fight however you like. Your human race’s internal affairs, this emperor won’t intervene in them,” Ji Mo’s face still had a faint smile as he said coolly.

Empyrean Pilljade’s face turned black again.

Ye Yuan found it funny in his heart, this fellow is rather interesting.

It turned out that not every major power was so old-fashioned and posturing.

Uh ... Ji Mo’s posturing was postured refreshingly and free from convention.

At this time, Ye Yuan suddenly turned around and said to Bai Tong, “Senior Bai Tong, back then, when I brought you away from Bamboo Groove Void Realm, I’d once promised you good fortune! Today, I’ll gift this good fortune to you!”

Bai Tong’s entire body trembled.

Then he saw that Ye Yuan had already started setting up a formation.

Recovering his strength, with the traction of divine essence, Ye Yuan’s speed of setting up formations was God knows how many times faster than before!

Merely half a day’s time, an enormous array formation surfaced in front of everyone.

Although this array formation was inferior to the array formation that refined the Chaos Samsara Pill previously, it was also extremely complicated.

Even if those Empyrean powerhouses opened their eyes wide and exerted their divine sense to the limits, they were still unable to understand the mysteries involved.

By the side, Ji Mo sneered coldly in his heart.

Even he could not understand this array formation, so how could these fools understand?

Clearly, Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao Pill Refinement already reached the boundary of following his own will.

To him, whether it was using medicinal cauldron to refine pills or using array formation to refine pills, there was already not much difference.

Ye Yuan integrated his alchemy skills into Alchemy Dao, grouping them randomly.

Targeting different medicinal pills, he could create different Formation Dao Pill Refinement.

Although the methods used may vary, the principle was the same.

That ‘principle’ was his Dao!

“Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill, condense!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold cry, a resplendent light radiated once more.

Pill formed!

“Hiss ... End spirit divine pill again!” The group of Empyreans could not refrain from drawing a cold breath once more.

“Although this medicinal pill isn’t as good as that one previously, it also already firmly reached the level of end spirit! Truly ... terrifying!”

“To be able to steadily refine rank seven divine pills to the level of end spirit, this boy’s realm has likely already reached middle-stage Ancestor Realm!”

“Don’t you guys forget! The medicinal pill that he refined earlier was an extremely obscure medicinal pill!”

... ...

Obscure medicinal pills were totally different concepts from ordinary medicinal pills.

Back then, when Ye Yuan refined the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill, he practically exhausted his divine soul. The difficulty could be seen.

Now, refining the Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill, the difficulty rose god knows how many levels up.

However, Ye Yuan still accomplished it with high proficiency!

The alchemy strength that Ye Yuan exhibited made the Southern Border Alliance’s empyreans despair.

“From today onward, I, Ye Yuan, have the final say in the Southern Border’s alchemy world!”

This sentence echoed in their ears from time to time.

Previously, they all still felt that Ye Yuan did not know what he was talking about, but now ... they already could not find the words to describe their current emotions.

Bai Tong received the medicinal pill and said with surprise, “Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill?”

Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill was not the medicinal pill to let him completely recover his strength.

Hence, when Bai Tong heard this name, he was very surprised too.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior returned to boyhood from old age. It’s caused by the defect in your cultivation method. Your cultivation method will harm a portion of the divine soul in exchange for great improvements in power. With your divine soul getting damaged, Heavenly Dao is defective. Even if Senior’s cultivation is exceedingly high, it’s also hard to step into the realm of Heavenly Emperor. This Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill can complete your divine soul and let your divine soul reach the peak. At that time, breaking through again would be much easier.”

Bai Tong’s entire body trembled. The defect in his divine soul was unable to recover fully even with the medicinal pills left behind by his ancestors.

Ye Yuan altered his pill formula and it was actually capable of restoring his divine soul?

Just what kind of realm did this fellow’s current Alchemy Dao reach?!

This kind of level nine difficulty peak rank seven divine pills, wanting to make the slightest changes was as difficult as ascending to heaven.

But Ye Yuan modified it like he had it at his fingertips!

This world was too crazy.

Bai Tong nodded slightly and said with a smile, “Fine lad, thanks a lot!”

He put away the medicinal pill and did not have the intention of refining it, but then he heard Ye Yuan say with a wide grin on his face, “Just nice. There’s Brother Ji Mo standing guard here, Elder Brother Bai should just directly refine the medicinal pill. There’s still ... something better after this!”

“B-Better?” Bai Tong was taken aback, his brain not quite following Ye Yuan’s words.

This Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill was already the best medicinal pill that he could imagine.

What kind of medicinal pill could be better than this?

Could it be ...

Suddenly, a thought crept up in his mind and his heart shook wildly!

Could ... he really do it?

Among Seven-star Alchemy Gods, it has never been heard of that anyone could refine that medicinal pill!

Yes, he was not an ordinary Seven-star Alchemy God ...

A hint of a smile flashed across the corners of Bai Tong’s mouth, and he nodded his head slightly at Ye Yuan, directly consuming the Dream Returning Heart Replenishing Pill.

While the others were shocked speechless.

“Could it be that this guy still wants to refine the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill?”

“Crazy! Really nuts! Wasn’t it said that this boy died? What the hell did he experience these few years? Why would he be monstrous until like this?”

“Who the hell knows what he experienced! But ... even that heaven-defying Chaos Samsara Pill was refined. So the Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill ... shouldn’t be anything difficult, right?”

... ...

The expressions of the Southern Border Alliance’s Empyreans became more and more fascinating.

Everyone already guessed what medicinal pill Ye Yuan was going to refine.

But they still did not dare to believe it.

This was because this medicinal pill was a heaven-defying existence to Seven-star Alchemy Gods, even to Eight-star Alchemy Gods.

If one had to add a difficulty above level nine, then this medicinal pill was the existence that surpassed level nine difficulty!

The Nine Profounds Heavenly Emperor Pill!

The medicinal pill that could create a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse!
