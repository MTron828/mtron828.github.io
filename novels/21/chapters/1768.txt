Chapter 1772 Grievous News

“Human, you wanted to see me?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In front of him, a majestic enormous tiger, a full person’s height, talked in human language. His gaze stared intently at Ye Yuan, his body radiating a terrifying aura.

Thud!

Ye Yuan did not show the least bit of fear. Stretching out his hand and lightly pushing, he pushed Blackpupil in front of Heavenly Tiger King.

“This is the culprit who seriously injured Tigerheart! I can help you treat Tigerheart, but I need to see White Light first,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Heavenly Tiger King’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “Punk, are you negotiating terms with me? Do you think that you have the capital to negotiate terms in front of me?”

Ye Yuan gave him a glance and said calmly, “I’m not discussing terms with you, but I am giving you a chance. I hope that White Light had better be fine, otherwise ... the entire Heavenly Tiger Mountain will be buried for your foolishness!”

At this time, just the late-stage rank five fierce beasts by Heavenly Tiger King’s side were as many as seven to eight.

This Heavenly Tiger Mountain, the rank five fierce beasts were no fewer than several dozen at the very least.

When these fierce beasts heard Ye Yuan’s word, each and every one of them exchanged glances, their expressions very amused.

This human brat in front of them was actually threatening Heavenly Tiger King?

This kid likely lost his mind, right?

“Hahaha! I, Heavenly Tiger King, have been entrenched in Heavenly Tiger Mountain for as long as several tens of thousands of years. Even Tiger Bright Imperial City’s city lord, I have killed one before too. There has never been a guy who dared to say this kind of wildly arrogant words in front of me! Kid, you’re very courageous!”

Heavenly Tiger King let out a wild laugh. Clearly, Ye Yuan’s words, he listened to it like a joke.

If not for Ye Yuan saying that he could treat Tigerheart, he would have long smacked him to death with one palm.

But Ye Yuan had a serious look as he asked in a solemn voice, “How is White Light?”

Heavenly Tiger King waved his paw carelessly and said coolly, “Relax, he’s currently locked up by me and suffered a small loss. But he’s fine. You just have to treat Tigerheart, and I’ll immediately release him!”

Hearing this, Ye Yuan’s heart eased up and he said coolly, “As long as White Light is fine, everything can be discussed. Lead the way!”

Under Heavenly Tiger King’s lead, Ye Yuan came to a cave.

On the simple and crude stone bed, a bright-colored tiger lay there, breath fleeting like gossamer.

Heavenly Tiger King’s face fell and he said, “Kid, don’t let me find out that you’re toying with me. You will know the consequences.”

In truth, he did not harbor much hope in Ye Yuan.

After all, Ye Yuan only had Divine Lord Realm’s strength.

Tiger Bright Imperial City’s high priests all came, and they all said that they were powerless to remedy the situation, and had him wait to collect the corpse.

But he loved his son dearly. Since Ye Yuan said so, he could only have Ye Yuan give it a shot.

Ye Yuan ignored Heavenly Tiger King and went straight to the edge of the stone bed, and pressed his palm on Tigerheart’s body. Traces of thick divine essence probed into Tigerheart’s body.

Ye Yuan’s brows knitted tighter and tighter, hatred towards Blackpupil welling up even more in his heart.

This guy attacked really viciously!

Tigerheart’s insides were virtually beaten into mush by Blackpupil, the vitality within his body almost already dissipated fully.

Even using medicinal pills, Tigerheart was completely unable to digest it too.

It was also no wonder that those Five-star high priests were all helpless.

This kind of situation, to the average person, it was basically waiting to die.

Heavenly Tiger King appeared slightly fidgety as he asked, “How is it? Is ... Is there hope?”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “This guy is tenacious too, to actually be able to hold out until now. You rest assured. As long as he doesn’t die, I can bring him back to life!”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s words, Heavenly Tiger King’s heart inexplicably eased up.

Ye Yuan took out a purplish-black medicinal pill. Supporting from under with his palm, the medicinal pill suspended above Tigerheart.

Ye Yuan’s divine essence poured out trace by trace, guiding the medicinal strength of the purplish-black medicinal pill into Tigerheart’s body.

The moment Heavenly Tiger King saw this, his gaze could not refrain from turning intent as he said in surprise, “This kid has such terrifying control!”

What kind of visual prowess did Heavenly Tiger King have? Ye Yuan’s control over divine essence was too terrifying.

No need to talk about him; even those high priests from the Priest Temple absolutely could not do it to Ye Yuan’s degree as well.

Tigerheart was only hanging in there with one breath and was totally unable to refine the medicinal strength himself anymore.

If he could still consume medicinal pills, Five-star high priests naturally would not be at their wits’ end.

At least, prolonging his life was still doable.

Previously, that high priest also said before leaving that Tigerheart was not without hope. It was just that no one had that kind of fine control to ferry the medicinal strength into Tigerheart’s body.

Even Hall Master Jin Hua could not do it too!

Now, this rank four little fellow actually did it!

“This kid indeed has some capability! His control over divine essence is simply brilliant to the max.” That black tiger from earlier marveled in admiration.

Heavenly Tiger King said excitedly, “Haha, truly, heaven doesn’t want my child to die!”

The black tiger was a little worried as he whispered, “Your Majesty, this kid wants that White Light, we . ..”

Heavenly Tiger King’s face turned black, two eyes glaring as he said in a solemn voice, “Wait for him to finish treating before talking! Talking about this now, do you want to die?”

The black tiger was startled inwardly and hurriedly withdrew, not daring to speak anymore.

Ye Yuan’s treatment lasted three days and three nights.

Under everyone’s marveling gazes, Tigerheart’s vitality went from nothing to something and gradually grew stronger again.

Although this process was extremely slow, the people present were all experts and could naturally feel the changes in Tigerheart’s breathing.

A smile unconsciously spilled out on Heavenly Tiger King’s ferocious looking face.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s palm pulled back, the treatment suddenly stopping.

Heavenly Tiger King’s face changed and he asked, “Kid, what’s the meaning of this?”

Ye Yuan slowly got up and wiped the fine beads of sweat on his forehead.

This method of ferrying medicinal strength was seriously too energy-consuming. Even he also felt very strained by casting it continuously for three days and three nights.

But the reason he stopped was naturally not because of this.

Ye Yuan looked at Heavenly Tiger King and said coolly, “Tigerheart’s current situation, living another few months isn’t an issue. I can continue to help treat him. But I have to see White Light first!”

The reason why he helped treat Tigerheart unconditionally was just in order to let them know that he had this strength.

But his goal was White Light.

Not seeing White Light, he would not continue taking action.

Regarding Heavenly Tiger King’s conduct, Ye Yuan had long inquired about it.

Heavenly Tiger King’s words, he naturally would not believe completely.

Heavenly Tiger King’s expression changed, and he said, “This king said that as long as you treat Tigerheart, this king will naturally release him.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I want to see White Light first!”

Heavenly Tiger King’s expression became incomparably ugly and he involuntarily looked toward the black tiger.

Ye Yuan’s face fell, immediately having a foreboding premonition. He said in a chilly voice, “Just how is White Light?! If you dare to deceive me, your son can forget about ever getting well!”

Heavenly Tiger King knew that it could not be hidden anymore and gave a cold snort as he said, “He’s dead!”

Buzz!

Ye Yuan’s eyes went black, staggering, nearly falling to the ground.

His head suddenly exploded, endless sorrow instantly filling his whole body.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan’s anxiety struck his heart, directly spewing out a mouthful of blood mist.
