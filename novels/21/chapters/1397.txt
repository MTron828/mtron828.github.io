Chapter 1401 Shaved Bald

Over a dozen swords stabbed over towards Ye Yuan at the same time. They wanted to besiege Wei to rescue Zhao[1]!

However, it was like Ye Yuan did not see it. The Evil Extermination Sword suddenly accelerated, chopping down with immense speed.

The expression of that Zuo Xiang Capital City’s student changed drastically and knew that there was no more chance of a fluke, crushing the jade pendant and transporting back.

Right at this time, over a dozen long swords arrived!

“Go to hell!”

Currently, Ye Yuan’s move was already ending and he was unable to save himself at all. He Ning could not help being overjoyed when he saw the situation.

But right at this moment, a layer of golden light surfaced on Ye Yuan’s body. The long sword struck back at a strange angle.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Ye Yuan’s long sword swept, sweeping away all of the dozen over swords.

Quick as thought!

The entire process was also nothing more than a flash, fast until everyone did not react to it.

“Nine Transformations Golden Body, first transformation grand completion!” He Ning said in disbelief.

The surrounding students were all incomparably shocked, not daring to believe the scene before their eyes.

“What the hell! They messed up, played their own people to death!”

“Just now, that was ... Nine Transformations Golden Body? Isn’t it said that the Nine Transformations Golden Body’s cultivation speed is very slow. Even exceedingly talented people could only have some attainments in 1000 years?”

“This Ye Yuan’s strength is uncommon, he actually still had time to go cultivate the fleshy body?”

“This Ye Yuan is so bizarre! Not only is he completely unscathed under the besieging of over a dozen people, he actually even counter-killed a person instead!”

...

The cultivation of the fleshy body was an extremely slow process. Even with the assistance of medicinal pills, it was also very hard to have some achievements within a short time.

But once they had some achievements, it was rare to have opponents in the same rank!

If one’s strength was not powerful to a certain degree, one could not breach their defenses at all.

Furthermore, the Nine Transformations Golden Body could do what ordinary people could not. One’s control over their bodies could reach an inconceivable degree.

Just now, Ye Yuan’s Sundering Stars had an imposing momentum. If it were others, it would be tremendously difficult to pull back. But he relied on the toughness of the fleshy body and performed the inconceivable action.

Ye Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Quite interesting, continue!”

Done talking, his long sword swung. Another sword slashed over towards He Ning.

He Ning’s pupils constricted, hurriedly dodging aside.

The group of people fell into a group battle once more.

This time, nobody mocked Ye Yuan anymore.

They discovered that the battle situation was completely different from what they imagined.

Even though Ye Yuan looked to be in perilous danger under over a dozen sword lights, the Zuo Xiang Capital City, these people, always seemed to be lacking a little.

On the contrary, Ye Yuan’s occasionally slashed out sword was accurate and fierce, always throwing one of them into confusion.

Before long, Ye Yuan saw a chance and decisively attacked again!

That Zuo Xiang student’s gaze revealed a look of despair, shattering the jade pendant.

More and more other capital cities’ students gathered around. But the vast Howless Ridge became quieter and quieter.

Time slowly trickled by, Zuo Xiang Capital City’s people became lesser and lesser.

No idea how long had passed either, the people discovered to their shock that Zuo Xiang Capital City was actually only left with three people at goodness knows when!

“What happened? Why do I clearly feel that Ye Yuan isn’t very formidable, but he can finish off Zuo Xiang Capital City’s people?” asked an outer-court disciple to the person next to him somewhat woodenly.

“His sword art seems to be average. Actually, he suppressed the power of laws to a very small range. Only by coming into contact with his sword can one sense the might of his sword arts! Although his realm isn’t high, even though the power of laws of Sword Dao first-layered heaven hasn’t reached grand completion yet, his utilization of the power of laws already reached the acme of perfection!” at this time, someone beside him suddenly explained.

“Then, how did you tell?”

But this time, that person no longer answered him.

He turned his head around rather curiously, his gaze suddenly turning intent.

“Jin ... Jin Yu!”

Hundred Cities’ number one person, Jin Yu! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually called down this great god too.

Jin Yu’s gaze never left Ye Yuan’s body for an instant.

A surge of powerful fighting intent rose from his body!

“Heh, looks like this time, Zuo Xiang Capital City has utterly stumbled! Jin Yu, you’re moved!” Another voice was heard.

The gaze of that person previously turned intent again as he cried out in shock, “Qiu Shuisheng!”

These two people were both the pinnacle-most existences among the hundred cities. It was said that their power of laws were already comprehended to the grand completion realm of second-layered heaven!

In Grotto Profound Realm, they did not have opponents at all!

Jin Yu did not turn back and just said coolly, “Didn’t you come too?”

“Heh, I really didn’t plan on coming. Originally, I thought that it was just a clown seeking popularity by saying something sensational. In the end, I still couldn’t resist my curiosity. It’s just that, didn’t expect that this visit was an eye-opener!” Qiu Shuisheng said with a light laugh.

“Are you going? Or me?” Jin Yu said coolly.

“Do you have assurance?” Qiu Shuisheng answered with a question.

Jin Yu slowly shook his head and said, “Will only know after fighting.”

Qiu Shuisheng smiled and said, “Since you came, you go then! If you can’t even beat, then I’m pretty sure I can’t win.”

Jin Yu said nonchalantly, “Alright!”

These two people chipped in a word each, already directly casting that student who asked questions previously to one side.

His heart was gasping with astonishment listening by the side. Jin Yu was known as the hundred cities’ number one person. Even he actually did not have assurance in dealing with Ye Yuan!

He finally knew where Ye Yuan’s confidence in setting up the arena lay!

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Ye Yuan released three sword moves consecutively as fast as lightning, sealing off all of He Ning’s escape routes.

He Ning’s countenance was greatly shocked, carrying intense unwillingness and crushing the jade pendant!

At this point, the Zuo Xiang Capital City was completely wiped out!

Ye Yuan fought the Zuo Xiang Capital City’s 15 people with his power alone and slew all of them!

If not for the jade pendants’ transportation, none of these 15 people could be spared.

The previous period’s top ten, the Zuo Xiang Capital City, was actually shaved bald this time. This result shocked everyone until their jaws dropped.

Ye Yuan casually beckoned. A hundred storage rings landed on his hand.

He examined these storage rings, a ray of light flashing in his eyes.

The Zuo Xiang Capital City was indeed well-deserving of being a major force ranked in the top ten. The harvest was plentiful!

Ye Yuan put these storage rings away. Surveying the surroundings, he said coolly, “Who else? You guys can also attack together!”

One sentence immediately ignited everyone’s fury.

These words were too arrogant, not taking them seriously at all!

It was just that now, all of them knew that Ye Yuan had this strength and confidence!

He was arrogant because he had the capital to be arrogant!

“He’s just alone! Right now, we have several hundred people here! Everybody attack! I don’t believe that he can deal with it! Finish him off, everyone can divide the storage rings with individual ability!”

At this time, someone suddenly shouted loudly, immediately making everyone’s heart stir.

But right at this time, Jin Yu moved!

His figure shook, already arriving opposite of Ye Yuan, saying indifferently, “I’m first! If I’m defeated, it’s not late for you guys to go again!”

Ye Yuan looked at Jin Yu rather surprisedly and said with a smile, “Looks like you’re very powerful. What’s your name?”
