“What did you say?!” The moment Yu Jinsong heard this, he immediately exploded.

But Ye Yuan could not be bothered to look at him. He stared straight at Yu Wenfeng, being not the slightest bit afraid.

But Ye Yuan’s boldness also made everyone tongue-tied.

He did not even want the land of a hundred cities and just wanted Yu Jinsong’s life, truly broad-minded!

Of course, there were also many people who felt that he was stupid.

But Jiang Jadehall by the side was touched, understanding that Ye Yuan was venting this frustration for them father and daughter here.

The land of a hundred cities, what kind of power and influence, how glorious was that? Yu Wenfeng really put forth the blood capital in order to rope in Ye Yuan.

But Ye Yuan did not even bat an eyelid and refused.

Yu Wenfeng frowned and said, “Otherwise than this, everything else can be discussed.”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said coolly, “It’s me stating terms now, not you!”

Yu Wenfeng’s face changed and he said with a cold snort, “Brat, do you really want to suffer the wrath of my City Lord Manor? Do you know what that means?”

“Humph! Yu Wenfeng, do you really think that you’re impressive? I, Li Kongming, am protecting Ye Yuan!” Li Kongming said with a cold smile.

With his shrewdness, how could he let go of this chance?

The two conditions that Ye Yuan stated, it was impossible for those two to agree.

Then, Ye Yuan could only choose the Kongming Academy.

Ye Yuan gave Li Kongming a glance and said coolly, “You don’t need to waste your efforts either, I won’t go to the Kongming Academy.”

Li Kongming’s expression changed, and he asked, “W-Why? Do you know what consequences there will be without my Kongming Academy’s protection?”

“Hahaha! Li Kongming, messing around for half a day, you were merely under the hallucination that the other party was willing! He doesn’t buy it at all!” Yu Wenfeng laughed loudly when he heard that.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You guys don’t think too highly of yourselves either. I, Ye Yuan, don’t need anyone’s protection. I came to Nine Pledge Imperial Capital only for the sake of saving Brother Jiang. Now that the matter has already been accomplished, I can’t be bothered to get involved in the affairs between you guys.”

The surrounding was silent, they were all stunned by Ye Yuan’s words.

Arrogant!

Too arrogant!

Facing a bunch of True God powerhouses, Ye Yuan actually dared to say this kind of words, this was simply courting death!

Did this boy have a problem with his head, or did he really have some reliances?

In the land of imperial capital, True God powerhouses were sovereign-like existences. Ye Yuan actually made them not think of themselves as a big deal!

This kind of word was simply high treason.

And he himself was merely a puny little Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity.

The three great powerhouses were all taken aback when they heard it. Immediately, Yu Wenfeng laughed loudly and said, “Brat, do you know who you’re talking to?”

Ye Yuan replied coolly, “I naturally know!”

Yu Wenfeng laughed from extreme rage and said, “Alright then, this seat wants to see what confidence you have to say this kind of words!”

No one could have expected that Ye Yuan actually slowly nodded his head and said, “You can give it a try.”

As he said, Ye Yuan pushed Yu Jinsong, directly throwing him out.

Everyone was stunned, was Ye Yuan returning the hostage to the opponent?

How were they going to fight?

A City Lord Manor’s True God powerhouse hurriedly made a move and caught Yu Jinsong.

Finally escaping Ye Yuan’s control, Yu Jinsong pointed at Ye Yuan and roared angrily, “Father, kill him! Kill him!”

Bang!

Yu Wenfeng directly smacked a palm out. Horrifying energy undulation crushed over towards Ye Yuan.

“Brother Jiang, follow me!”

Ye Yuan grabbed the collar of the Jiang Jadehall whose complexion turned white, his figure moving, vanishing from where he stood.

Yu Wenfeng’s horrifying palm immediately struck thin air.

The group of powerhouses suddenly cried out in surprise, “Spatial shift!”

They all knew that Ye Yuan’s spatial law was rather powerful, but they did not know that it already reached such a degree.

“No wonder! No wonder he could slaughter his way through inside the Carefree Grove! Turns out that his spatial law is already comprehended to the fourth firmament!”

“Not only that! He already fused Sword Dao law and spatial law, this talent is too terrifying!”

“Turns out that this is his confidence, turns out that he’s already established in an undefeatable position!”

...

Amidst the wave of exclamations, Ye Yuan’s figure emerged once more.

The place where he stood was just nice between the three great powerhouses.

That bout of tune-up previously, actually, Ye Yuan had long calculated it.

Once these three people unleashed attacks, he would be able to shift away at once, avoiding the three people’s attacks.

Otherwise, how could he put himself in a perilous situation?

Therefore, when Yu Wenfeng unleashed his attack, Ye Yuan evaded it at the first moment.

Facing off with the three great powerhouses from far away, Ye Yuan stood proudly, giving people a feeling of extreme trance.

Ye Yuan was clearly just an unassuming Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity, but in terms of aura, he actually did not lose to the three great Third Firmament powerhouses.

Ye Yuan looked at Yu Wenfeng and said coolly, “Now, you saw my confidence?”

Yu Wenfeng gave a cold snort and said, “So what? Is it possible that you think this seat can’t do anything to you because you know spatial shift?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I know that the speed of a True God powerhouse is exceedingly fast, comparable to spatial shift. But, if I didn’t have confidence in my own speed, do you think that I’d stand here to talk and chat with you? If you don’t believe me, you can give it another try.”

That bout just now, Yu Wenfeng did not go all out. Ye Yuan did not use his full strength either.

At present, Ye Yuan’s cultivation grew deeper with each passing day. His comprehension of spatial shift also gradually deepened. The ability of spatial shift was no longer what it had been a long time ago.

Even when facing True God powerhouses, he had the capital to escape too.

As long as he avoided the world power of True God powerhouses, however vast the world was, he could roam as he pleased!

Of course, if the space to display it was insufficient, once he fell into the world domain of a True God powerhouse, then he would be in danger.

Hence, he captured Yu Jinsong as a hostage and retreated to outside the city. It was in order to avoid the world domains of these True God powerhouses.

Everything was long within his calculations.

If he did not plan out a route of retreat for himself, how could he dare barge into Nine Pledge Imperial Capital by himself and rescue Jiang Jadehall alone?

Yu Wenfeng’s expression was livid. It was already disgraceful enough that he, an exalted middle-stage True God, took action, and actually could not take down a puny little Fifth Firmament Celestial Deity.

Now, he would not attempt again rashly.

And now, he also understood Ye Yuan’s intentions.

The place where ye yuan stood was just nice outside of the place that his world power was able to reach, making him extremely upset.

The Pavilion Lord Linghua who had been silent all along suddenly spoke up, “What a terrific lad, interesting! Interesting! It’s just that you can escape, but can Heavenly Eagle Imperial City escape?”

Ye Yuan was not surprised, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was Nine Pledge Imperial Capital’s subsidiary. It was too easy for them to want to investigate his relationship with Heavenly Eagle.

He looked at Pavilion Lord Linghua and said coolly, “Indeed, I’m currently powerless to stop you all from destroying Heavenly Eagle. But you all similarly can’t catch me either. You guys remember this for me; as long as you all dare to touch Heavenly Eagle, I’ll completely destroy your three major factions in less than 500 years!”

These words, Ye Yuan said them casually. But the killing intent in that voice was clear to anyone.

“Heh, you, brat, are really confident! 500 years and you want to eradicate us?” Yu Wenfeng said with a cold smile. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Clearly, he did not believe it.

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “If I’m willing maybe it won’t need 500 years. Don’t you all forget, I’m also an alchemist! A very formidable alchemist!”
