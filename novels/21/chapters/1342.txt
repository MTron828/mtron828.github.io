Chapter 1346: A Lucky Chance

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Elder Feng, how is it? You refined it?”

The one asking was Wu Meng Capital City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s Han Tian. The old man opposite him was the Myriad Treasure Tower’s chief alchemist, Three-star Alchemy Master, Xiao Feng. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Xiao Feng shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “This old man has cultivated Alchemy Dao for tens of thousands of years. I’ve never thought that I actually can’t even refine a Tier 1 middle-grade divine pill!”

Han Tian’s shock was by no means insignificant, and he said, “Failed? This ... This isn’t possible, right? A mere Tier 1 middle-grade divine pill, even you, this peak Three-star Alchemy God, actually can’t refine it?”

Half a month ago, Han Tian received the Essence Cultivating Pill’s pill formula that Jewelhill City’s Myriad Treasure Tower transported over through back channels.

After receiving Yang Rui’s intel, Han Tian immediately realized a huge business opportunity.

Hence, he started mobilizing Wu Meng Capital City’s Myriad Treasure Tower’s alchemists and started refining the Essence Cultivating Pill according to the pill formula.

But he discovered very quickly that he was too naive!

Although the Myriad Treasure Tower was short on manpower, there were still some Two-star Alchemy Gods.

But among these Two-star Alchemy Gods, there was actually not a single person capable of refining the Essence Cultivating Pill.

In amazement, Han Tian found a Three-star Alchemy God to refine. The result was still the same!

In the end, Han Tian, who was out of options, finally engaged Three-star Alchemy God, Xiao Feng.

But what astonished him was that even Xiao Feng actually failed!

Was this Essence Cultivating Pill so hard to refine?

Xiao Feng let out a sigh and said, “This pill formula seizes the good fortune of heaven and earth. If without extremely deep comprehensions toward Alchemy Dao, it’s impossible to refine one. This old man ... is still lacking some level of attainment.”

Actually, he was already very close to success. It was just too bad that no matter what, he could not break through that final checkpoint.

When Han Tian heard these words, he could not help losing heart.

When he just obtained the Essence Cultivating Pill’s pill formula, he even thought that he picked up a treasure. But looking at it now, it was purely of little value.

If it could not be refined, what could be done even if this pill formula was any more impressive?

“I didn’t expect that it was actually drawing water with a sieve! Sigh ...” Han Tian said helplessly.

Xiao Feng thought about it and said, “Tower Lord, I have an idea.”

Han Tian said listlessly, “What idea Elder Feng has, feel free to say.”

Xiao Feng said, “I wish to make a trip to Jewelhill City!”

Han Tian froze and hurriedly shook his head and said, “This isn’t appropriate, right? Elder Feng, your status is exalted. How can you condescend your exalted self to that kind of secular place? You want to meet that guest alchemist called Ye Yuan, right? If you wish to meet, I’ll just send people to fetch him here.”

To them, Jewelhill City, this sort of place was not worth them heading there at all.

But Xiao Feng shook his head and said, “That’s not right, Tower Lord! As it goes: those who reached first can teach. Since that Ye Yuan already refined the Essence Cultivating Pill, it indicates that his understanding of alchemy must be deeper than mine! At least on the refinement of Tier 1 divine pills, I’m inferior to him! This kind of figure is bound to surpass this old man in the future, we should give him adequate courtesy! Such a genius, once employed by our Myriad Treasure Tower, he’ll definitely be a pillar of the Myriad Treasure Tower in the future!”

Han Tian thought about it and said with a nod, “Elder Feng’s words make sense. Then ... I’ll have to trouble Elder Feng to make a trip! If possible, you must bring him to Wu Meng Capital City!”

Xiao Feng said, “Huhu, not a trouble at all! I have a feeling that perhaps ... this trip is a lucky chance for me.”

...

Half a year’s time passed in a twinkle since the Myriad Treasure Tower launched the Essence Cultivating Pill.

In this half a year’s time, the shops of Wang Family, Lin Family, and Lu Family were all completely devoid of people.

The launch of the Essence Cultivating Pill was a virtually catastrophic blow to them.

The Lin Family and Lu Family were still a little better. But the Wang Family was already spending more than they earned.

The Myriad Treasure Tower and Ye Yuan’s split that Wang Su said with certainty, they kept failing to see it.

This half a year’s time, Ye Yuan spent it very cozily.

Apart from refining a batch of Essence Cultivating Pill every day, it was cultivating inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space, comprehending concepts.

This half a year also made Yang Rui crazy with delight.

The Myriad Treasure Tower could be described with the saying bringing in bushels of gold daily!

Every day, Yang Rui was immersed in the midst of shock.

He had a score in his heart, the divine essence stones that the Myriad Treasure Tower earned in this half a year could virtually be placed in the same category as Brightraise City, that kind of large county.

Finally, the Wang Family could not sit still anymore.

At this time, Wang Su was currently at Jewelhill City’s City Lord Manor.

“Huhu, Younger Brother Wang Su, how have you been! I heard that your brother, Wang Song, already broke through to late-stage Heaven Glimpse, right?” City Lord Chen Yongnian said with a laugh.

Wang Su smiled and said, “Brother Chen’s intel is very up to date! His breakthrough was also a thing of last year.”

Chen Yongnian said with an envious look, “Wang Song’s talent is exceedingly high and also has the Wang Family as a backer. Unlike us impoverished people, we have got to be busy with secular affairs every day!”

Wang Su smiled and said, “Brother Chen, you’re the lord of a city, wielding great power in your hands. Other people are all too envious!”

Chen Yongnian chuckled and said, “Younger Brother Wang Su coming this time, it’s not for no reason, right?”

Wang Su silently cursed this sly old fox, but he still had a smile on his face as he said, “That is, of course, But ... the matter of cultivation, Brother Chen doesn’t have to worry either. As long as Jewelhill City’s Wang Family pulls through this crisis, Brother Chen’s cultivation will be covered by Elder Yuxiang, don’t ... you agree?”

Wang Yuxiang by the side hurriedly said, “That is, of course! In the past, it was our Wang Family who couldn’t do it. We hope that City Lord, Your Excellency, is magnanimous enough to forgive us. This time, our Wang Family prepared a slight gift, just take it as an apology.”

Wang Yuxiang’s heart was dripping blood. Even if the Wang Family tides over this disaster, the largest share of their income in the future would probably have to be used to pay tributes.

Wang Su, Wang Xuanfeng, and now, throwing in another Chen Yongnian, this expenditure was too great.

Grotto Profound Deity Realm martial artists were still a little better. But Wang Xuanfeng and Chen Yongnian were both Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm martial artists.

Their expenditure, to the Wang Family, the pressure was still huge.

But compared to the Wang Family collapsing entirely, clearly this result, he could still accept.

All of this was brought by Ye Yuan that punk.

Wang Yuxiang had long hated Ye Yuan to the bones in his heart.

This Chen Yongnian was Wu Meng Academy’s same-year students with Wang Su’s elder brother, Wang Song.

Wu Meng Academy was Wu Meng Capital City’s government-managed school.

The students that graduated from here were mostly dukes or princes of a region, representing the various major counties managed by Wu Meng Capital City.

After the two people came out of Wu Meng Academy, one came to the remote Jewelhill City to be city lord, while the other became deputy city lord at Brightraise City.

Although one was head and one was deputy, because the cities were different, their statuses were naturally different too.

Wang Song, this deputy city lord, had a higher position and more authority compared to Chen Yongnian, this city lord.

Furthermore, Wang Song broke through to the late-stage Heaven Glimpse first. Later on, he might even be placed in an important position in Wu Meng Capital City.

To talk about this Chen Yongnian, he was also an extremely shrewd and wily old fox.

The Myriad Treasure Tower and Wang Family’s struggle, he naturally took it into his sights. But bade his time all along, waiting for the Wang Family to come and find him.

Now, the Wang Family indeed could not hold on anymore.

Even though he was the city lord, the various major families’ taxes, he had to turn it over to higher authorities. The City Lord Manor still had enormous expenditures. What he could have from the leftover was naturally not much.

Hence, that was why he would use this kind of method to make the Wang Family take the initiative to pay tributes to him.

These were filling his own pockets.

“Huhu, Elder Yuxiang is too courteous. You all coming to find this city lord this time, is it because of the Myriad Treasure Tower’s matters?” Only now did Chen Yongnian lay his cards on the table.
