“Why, you’re interested in this top dog? Heh, pardon me for speaking bluntly, if this entrance examination is competing in pill refinement, forget about top dog, even personal disciple is nothing difficult! But for martial arts, heh heh ...”

Yang Rui did not carry on saying, but the meaning in those words was already very clear.

With Ye Yuan’s strength, wanting to take the top dog position was undoubtedly a fool’s talk.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I was just asking. Brother Yang doesn’t need to take it seriously!”

He indeed did not have this idea. He knew that his current realm’s strength was severely lacking. Being able to succeed in clearing the rounds was already pretty good.

Ever since coming to Heavenspan World, all of Ye Yuan’s energy was virtually all placed on pill refinement and creating the Chaos Heavenspan Canon. Martial arts were not to say already lying wasted, but it had indeed stagnated for a long time and not advanced.

At this time, a young girl in yellow garment and an old woman went up to Clearwind Inn’s second floor.

“Goodness gracious, my grand-aunt, I already said that the second level have no seats, but you just don’t believe me!” The waiter chased the yellow-shirt girl up to the second level and urged bitterly.

The yellow-shirt girl ignored the waiter. Sweeping a glance on the second floor, she walked towards the table Ye Yuan was at with quick steps.

Slap!

The yellow-shirt girl slapped a storage ring on the table and said overbearingly, “Kid, this seat is mine! There are 500 low-grade divine essence stones inside here. You take it and pay the bill. The remainder, just take it as buying this seat. Now, tidy up for me and get lost!”

The yellow-shirt girl’s domineeringness drew everyone’s sidelong glance.

“The Qin Family’s little demoness making a move again. It’s still okay if this kid is sensible. If he isn’t sensible, he will probably suffer.”

“No choice, who asked her to get reincarnated in a good place? These few years, this lass has harmed no idea how many people.”

“That kid is also unlucky. He’s from the countryside at a glance. Didn’t expect that he ran into Qin Peiyu when he just entered the city.”

...

Some locals clearly knew about the yellow-shirt girl’s identity, all casting sympathetic looks at Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan gave Qin Peiyu a glance and took a look at the storage right, suddenly saying with a smile, “Miss, If I accept this storage ring, does it belong to me?”

Seeing this scene, the surrounding onlookers could not help but be disappointed.

They were all young masters and young ladies and wished for the matter to blow up to watch a show. They did not expect that Ye Yuan was so scared.

Qin Peiyu made no attempt to conceal the disdain in her gaze as she said coolly, “That is, of course! Your table is at most 300 divine essence stones. The remaining 200, just take it as giving you.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and pushed the storage ring back, saying with a smile, “Miss, there are 500 low-grade divine essence stones in here, you take it and immediately disappear in front of me, don’t affect my appetite.”

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone stunned.

The plot reversed too quickly. They did not react for a moment.

But they realized very quickly that a fine show came!

Ye Yuan’s move made it even harder for Qin Peiyu to step down the stage than directly refusing.

Sure enough, Qin Peiyu’s expression instantly changed, and she said angrily, “Boy, are you refusing face when given? Do you know how this young lady is? If I want you dead, it’s just a matter of a word!”

This was also the area where Ye Yuan was most averse to Qin Peiyu, wanting people’s life at the drop of a hat, not attaching importance to other people’s life and death at all.

To be able to say this kind of words, Ye Yuan reckoned that the ones who died at her hands were probably not few.

“This young master doesn’t know you and isn’t interested in knowing either. Take it, you can disappear already. Don’t hinder my friends and me from eating,” Ye Yuan said coolly.

Qin Peiyu was used to running rampant. When had she suffered this kind of insult before? Raising her palm, she smacked down towards Ye Yuan.

This palm mustered up divine essence fully. It was actually going to put Ye Yuan to death.

Ye Yuan’s face fell and became genuinely angry too.

This Qin Peiyu was young, but her realm was not low, already late-stage Grotto Profound.

Although Ye Yuan’s cultivation advanced all the way vigorously, he was still marginally weaker than late-stage Grotto Profound.

In other people’s view, Ye Yuan only had the share to be crushed.

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s palm extended strangely.

The expression of the old woman behind Qin Peiyu changed, and she shouted, “seeking death,” and actually reached first despite moving later, pouncing towards Ye Yuan.

But right at this time, a gust of Yin wind blew past. Gui Yun’s figure appeared.

Pointing a finger out, he directly tapped the old woman flying.

Slap!

A crisp slapping sound echoed out. Qin Peiyu’s body was directly slapped to the ground.

All of this happened in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint. Everyone had yet to react in time, and it was already over.

This slap of Ye Yuan’s was really heavy. Five fingerprints were distinctly visible on Qin Peiyu’s face.

Everyone was stunned. Firstly was because of Ye Yuan’s strength. Secondly was because of Gui Yun’s appearance.

A late-stage Two-star evil spirit was actually hidden beside this young man!

That was right, because setting off for Wu Meng Capital City, Gui Yun already broke through to late-stage Two-star.

He was originally peak middle-stage Two-star. These few years, he had minor accomplishments in cultivating the Ghost Dao Hundred Runes. Breaking through was just a matter of time.

That old woman was middle-stage Heaven Glimpse, how could she be Gui Yun’s match? She lost in one exchange.

Although Ye Yuan had yet to break through to late-stage Grotto Profound, through these few years of cultivation as well as consuming Essence Cultivating Pills frenziedly, he was already infinitely close to late-stage Grotto Profound.

With Ye Yuan’s divine essence’s degree of thickness, his strength was actually not inferior to ordinary late-stage Grotto Profound already.

Qin Peiyu had also just entered late-stage Grotto Profound. Moreover, one glance and it was clear that she had not experienced actual battles before. How could she be Ye Yuan’s match?

“You ... You dare to hit me? You dare to hit me! I’m going to tear you limb from limb and feed your corpse to dogs! And this little slut, I’ll let people screw her, then disfigure her face and send her to a brothel, making her never to reincarnate for all of eternity!” Qin Peiyu thoroughly rampaged and did not choose her words.

When that old woman saw Ye Yuan’s expression get uglier and uglier, she secretly cursed and hurriedly shouted, “Boy, stop! Peiyu is the Qin Family’s true-born daughter! If you dare to touch her, you’ll die without a burial ground!”

However, it was already too late ...

Slap! Slap! Slap!

A series of crisp slapping sounds transmitted into everyone’s ears, slapping until those surrounding onlookers shudder with fear.

Some even touched their faces, as if those slaps were slapped on their faces.

The Clearwind Inn’s second level was completely quiet. There was only that series of face-slapping sounds.

When Ye Yuan stopped, Qin Peiyu’s beautiful face already swelled into a pig’s head, completely unrecognizable.

Everyone all sucked in a cold breath. To dare slap a Qin Family’s descendant like this, this person was probably one of a kind, right?

“At a young age, wanting people’s lives at every turn! Originally just wanted to teach you a small lesson, but you had killing intent aroused toward my friend. That isn’t what a slap can resolve anymore!”

Playing out like this, how could Ye Yuan still be in the mood to eat? His appetite was all gone.

Ye Yuan threw Qin Peiyu’s storage ring to the waiter and said coolly, “Miss Qin is treating us, so it’s not good to decline. The excess divine essence stones, just take it as compensating the Clearwind Inn.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan brought everyone out of the Clearwind Inn and walked off without looking back.
