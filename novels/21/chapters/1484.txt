1488 Borrowing Divine Fire to Use

“Medicine Ancestor? Who’s Medicine Ancestor? Could it be ... one of the Dao Ancestors?”

When Ye Yuan heard this name, his heart involuntarily stirred, and started communicating with Dustless through his consciousness.

Dustless said, “The Medicine Ancestor isn’t a Dao Ancestor, but his status in the Heavenspan World is extremely high. One can say that he’s the earliest ancestor of the Heavenspan World’s Path of Medicinal Pills. Inside the houses of many alchemists, they would even enshrine and worship his memorial tablet!”

Ye Yuan said in surprise, “There’s actually such a figure! He calls himself Medicine Ancestor without authorization. Could it be that the nine great Dao Ancestors would let it go unchecked?”

Dustless smiled and said, “The nine great Dao Ancestors are above worldly considerations and normally don’t care about the Heavenspan World’s matters. Moreover, the Medicine Ancestor’s position is indeed very special. The nine great Dao Ancestors each control a region of Heavenly Dao laws; virtually invincible existences. But the Dao of Alchemy’s strongest person, the Medicine Ancestor, doesn’t control a Heavenly Dao. But his strength is acknowledged by all of the Dao Ancestors. Of course, don’t talk about the Medicine Ancestor, even a transcendent Heavenly Emperor, this kind of existence, is also not what the likes of us can estimate.”

Ye Yuan’s lifelong pursuit was the limits of Alchemy Dao.

Toward the Alchemy Dao’s paramount existence, Ye Yuan was naturally fascinated. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t expect that the Heavenspan World actually had such a character! I really hope that one day, I can sit and debate on Dao with him!” Ye Yuan said with vicissitudes of emotion.

...

Meng Qi’s expression turned slightly dark. He could not quite grasp Ye Yuan anymore.

Want to say that Ye Yuan had no ability, Ye Yuan really said out all of the medicinal pill’s elements.

But to say that Ye Yuan could refine the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill, he did not believe even if beaten to death.

“Humph! Prepare the spirit medicines! I want to see what kind of medicinal pill he can refine! Kid, don’t blame me for not warning you, I’ll give you three chances. If you can’t refine, bear the consequences yourself!” Meng Qi said solemnly.

Ye Yuan chuckled lightly and said, “Relax, this level of medicinal pill still can’t stump me. Don’t need three times, once is enough.”

“Haha, what high-sounding sentiments! Young man, better to be a little more low-key, or the wind might sprain your tongue!” Meng Qi laughed from extreme fury.

Ye Yuan smiled and did not answer.

Very soon, the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill’s spirit medicines were ready.

Ye Yuan said to Meng Qi, “Borrow divine fire to use!”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s faces all revealed a peculiar look.

A Fiend Apothecary actually did not have his own divine fire?

Did this guy really know how to refine pills?

A divine fire was the divine rank state of essence fires.

Ye Yuan’s Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame had long already advanced to divine rank and become a divine fire. But after Ye Yuan broke through to Heaven Glimpse Realm, the Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame did not evolve along with it.

Now, when Ye Yuan refined pills, there was no convenient divine fire to use. He could only find Meng Qi to borrow fire.

“Looks like I have to find a chance to let the Cleansing Sandal Flame Lotus evolve. This isn’t the way to go. If only Fiery was by my side.”

Ye Yuan sighed emotionally in his heart and unwittingly missed Fiery.

On the road of becoming a fugitive, Ye Yuan virtually spent all of his savings, just to familiarize himself with Two-star spirit medicines’ medicinal properties.

When he came out of Wu Meng Capital City, the low-grade divine essence stones on Ye Yuan were very sizable. He had about as much as 80 million.

The divine essence stones that the Myriad Treasure Tower awarded to Ye Yuan was 40 million.

In addition, Ye Yuan successively killed Qin Tian as well as Lin Xiu, Qin Zheng, and the rest. The storage rings on them were all taken into Ye Yuan’s possession.

Counting it together, when Ye Yuan left, the divine essence stones on him were plenty.

On the way of fleeing, each time Ye Yuan reached a city, he would sweep up the goods and purchase spirit medicines.

Presently, there was already plenty of room to spare for Ye Yuan to refine Two-star divine pills.

But this Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill, it was really his first time refining.

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove studied the fiend race’s medicinal pills greatly. But Ye Yuan only obtained the knowledge from Dustless there after all. As for the specifics of how to refine, he had not tested it before.

But with Ye Yuan’s present alchemy strength, refining the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill, this kind of medicinal pill, was nothing difficult.

Meng Qi gave a cold snort and held his palm out. A pale-white fire seedling appeared in the palm of his hand.

“A Fiend Apothecary without even a divine fire actually dares to spout empty rhetoric too! I want to see how you refine pills! Humph!” Meng Qi said with a cold snort.

The fire seedling floated over in Ye Yuan’s direction. Ye Yuan reached his hand out and beckoned. With a slight finger movement, the small fire seedling immediately grew into a fire tree.

The exquisiteness of the technique, those Fiend Apothecaries actually could not see through!

“White Elegance Devil Flame. Uh, it’s not bad. I’ll make do and use it then,” Ye Yuan said.

When Meng Qi saw this scene, he could not help being shocked inwardly.

Disregarding anything else, just this technique of controlling fire was much stronger than him.

His own divine fire was actually so obedient and docile reaching Ye Yuan’s hands. This made titanic waves set off in his heart.

Even he himself could not do it to this degree too!

This ... This was also demoralizing.

However, this was just the beginning.

When Ye Yuan started refining the pill, Meng Qi’s pride was directly washed away by wave after wave of floodwaters!

“What impressive fire controlling methods! This kid actually really knows how to refine pills! Furthermore ... his level is quite high!”

“What kind of refinement method is this? Never seen it before!”

“Yeah! It’s totally different from our pill refining techniques! But why do I feel that this technique is of a much higher level than ours?”

“Stupid! That Dao accumulation! His technique secretly contains Heavenly Dao, obtaining Heavenly Dao’s support!”

...

Cries of exclamations sounded out all around, Meng Qi was utterly dumbfounded.

This was a true expert!

Just this pill refining technique was already on a completely different level than him!

The Fiend Medicine Hall’s five elders all had their eyes glued at this time, fearful of missing any step.

This kind of master-level refinement could not be seen simply if they want to!

Li Ji’s cherry lips opened slightly and never shut before the whole time.

Cool!

Too cool!

She watched Ye Yuan refine pills and was actually wholly enraptured.

Since young, she had also seen quite a few Fiend Medicine Hall’s fiend apothecaries refining pills.

But no one had ever given her this feeling of being refreshed in mind and spirit.

“Condense!”

No idea how long had passed either, and then it was only to hear Ye Yuan cry out lightly. The furnace fire extinguished, the medicinal pill formed!

Ye Yuan sighed and said, “First time refining, the fire control still isn’t quite there yet. The quality of the medicinal pill is probably not too ideal.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan reached out his hand and beckoned. A medicinal pill flew into the jade vessel.

“S-Superior-grade! Superior-grade Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill! Hiss ...”

Everyone all sucked in a mouthful of cold air, looking at Ye Yuan like they had seen ghosts.

This medicinal pill barely managed to reach the level of superior-grade.

Superior-grade Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill was still called not too ideal?

Meng Qi wished to give himself a tight slap. This was too demoralizing!

Him refining the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill, the best grade was also just middle-grade. He had never refined before high-grade.

Another person refining for the first time, and it was a superior-grade!

This disparity ... was too great!

He did not doubt Ye Yuan’s excuse. Meng Qi knew that it was probably really Ye Yuan’s first time refining the Devil Dragon Flame Crystal Pill!

Even though Ye Yuan’s refining technique was extremely profound, that awkwardness and inexperience when just starting could not be concealed.

This kind of situation, he had seen them too many times among newbies.

But along with the passing of time, Ye Yuan clearly gradually entered an optimal state and found the feeling. Hence, the more he refined, the smoother it got.
