Chapter 2244: I Have a Sword, Do You Dare Receive?

“However ... now that your sword is gone, what will you use to fight with me?” Daymeld looked at Ye Yuan with a grin on his face.

Ye Yuan’s cultivation method coupled with sword intent fused with spatial law, the power was hair-raisingly strong.

This kind of combat strength could virtually use heaven-defying to describe.

Therefore, Daymeld also had to ruin Ye Yuan’s sword at the risk of suffering a great loss in strength.

A swordsman without a sword, how could he talk about fighting?

The bone sword was indeed an extremely important thing to Ye Yuan.

Ever since the Ancient God Battlefield battle, Ye Yuan’s primary sword had always been the bone sword.

This bone sword was a legacy. Ye Yuan used it very smoothly.

This shattering earlier indeed had a tremendous impact on Ye Yuan, it was like he lost something in his heart.

But during that moment, a trace of understanding was produced in Ye Yuan’s heart!

He seemed to have grasped something.

Ye Yuan was like an ancient well without ripples. He just said coolly, “Swordless! I’ll use my fists then!”

Swoosh!

In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan’s vital energy billowed to the sky. An astonishing true dragon pressure instantly dispersed between heaven and earth.

Divine Dragon Trampling Heaven!

Grand Universe Palm!

Transient Heavenly Dragon Hand!

Each of Ye Yuan’s punches was faster than the last. The entire sky was filled with his fist images everywhere.

That horrifying pressure made the group of Heavenly Emperors stare wide-eyed and tongue-tied.

Earlier, they even thought that Ye Yuan without his sword would be equivalent to a tiger without its teeth.

But now, they discovered that Ye Yuan actually became an enormous dragon without his sword!

A dragon’s might was unstoppable!

Under the fist images, Daymeld practically wanted to vomit blood.

Twice, he lost both the initiative. Yet Ye Yuan’s combat strength was fearsome to the extreme. It went even far beyond their divine race’s.

Being pressured by Ye Yuan, he did not have the chance to retaliate at all, and could only defend passively.

Concerning Limitless God Killing Bow’s arrow earlier, even though he fended it off, his injuries were critical to the extreme.

Otherwise, what did it have to do with Ye Yuan anymore?

Yet, Ye Yuan’s unreasonable fighting method made him not have the strength to fight back at all.

“This boy, his fleshly body actually reached the realm of perfection! How can such a monster appear in the human race?”

Each punch stronger than the last, each fist heavier than the last.

Ye Yuan’s imposing aura was also in the midst of continuously rising.

He currently only had one thought. It was to kill Daymeld and take the Silvernet Blood Essence!

He could not afford to drag it on!

“Heretic Dragon Dominating Space!”

Ye Yuan strode out, as if the spirit of a true dragon suddenly stepped out of the void.

This divine ability, Ye Yuan raised his aura to the limits. Its power was unimaginable.

With a step, space shattered. Dao marks on Daymeld’s body glimmered, desperately trying to withstand this move. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But he spewed a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, his figure flying out backward. He was smashed into the chasm once more.

Ye Yuan stood in the air, akin to a celestial deity descending upon the mortal world.

Even those Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were also dumbstruck with amazement.

They had seen before Daymeld’s power. That kind of might simply made heaven and earth tremble.

Even the Limitless God Killing Bow, that kind of horrifying attack, was still blocked by him.

But he was actually without the slightest strength to fight back in front of Ye Yuan.

This scene seriously exceeded their expectations.

However, the might of the divine race far exceeded everyone’s imagination.

Daymeld flew out stubbornly once more.

If it were an ordinary peak Empyrean powerhouse, suffering this terrifying attack, they would have long turned to ashes.

It was just that, the current Daymeld no longer had the unparalleled invincible might from before. He was clothed in ragged clothes, his aura seemingly feeble.

He looked at Ye Yuan coldly and said in a solemn voice, “Fine lad, I underestimated you! I didn’t expect that you actually still have the dragon race’s bloodline! This move, Heretic Dragon Dominating Space, I really haven’t seen it for a long time!”

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “You know this move?”

Daymeld said with a cold smile, “More than just know! You probably don’t know, but the last Dragon Ancestor died under this ancestor’s hands! Heh, you might not be aware of what kind of existence the Dragon Ancestor was. He was an existence that could be mentioned in the same breath with Dao Ancestors! Although he was not as strong, he wasn’t far off!”

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted, killing intent immediately surfacing.

His impression of the dragon race was not very good, but his abilities, half of it came from the dragon race.

This bloodline origin, he could not avoid it.

But even more was still shock!

In this world, was there really an existence that could be mentioned in the same breath with Dao Ancestors?

In Daymeld’s eyes, he did not seem to care about Dao Ancestors at all.

Could it be that his strength at his prime could even defeat Dao Ancestors?

This shock was by no means insignificant!

In his understanding, Dao Ancestors were invincible existences. They were paramount existences.

But along with his realm getting higher and higher, Ye Yuan gradually realized that it did not seem to be the case!

It was true that Dao Ancestors were invincible, but those existences who surpassed Heavenly Emperors seemed to similarly be incomparably powerful!

Daymeld’s one sentence was earth-shattering!

The ones who were shocked were not just Ye Yuan. Even those Heavenly Emperor powerhouses who heard this were in shock.

Only Heavenly Emperor Quicksand’s gaze glimmered, seemingly knowing something.

Daymeld seemed to have seen through Ye Yuan’s misgivings and said with a cold smile, “Are you very surprised? How can Dao Ancestors die? How can someone be placed on par with Dao Ancestors? This ancestor can tell you. Dao Ancestors ... There are strong and weak ones! If not for you humans being despicable and shameless, bullying with numbers, how could my divine race be suppressed for an epoch?”

Ye Yuan trembled all over, his gaze revealing astounded looks.

Daymeld laughed loudly and said, “Of course, you have no need to know about these! Because, since this ancestor ran into this generation’s dragon ancestor in-advance, then ... there won’t be a dragon ancestor in this era anymore! Two generations of dragon ancestors dying under my hands, truly invigorating! Invigorating! Hahaha ... after the Doomsday Battle this time, my divine race will descend upon the Heavenspan World!”

Rumble!

His voice had yet to fade when a horrifying aura erupted once more.

The power of Heavenly Dao suddenly descended.

The Heavenly Emperors present all changed expressions.

Reaching Daymeld’s level, every movement and action was within the scope of the Dao.

The power was simply unimaginable.

He was being attacked crazily by Ye Yuan previously and did not have time to maneuver Heavenly Dao at all.

But this time, he was different!

He said so much in order to confuse Ye Yuan’s mind, to accumulate and create time for himself.

Ye Yuan’s spatial law was too formidable, his movement technique being swift as lightning.

That kind of attack that did not take any breathers made him unable to retaliate at all.

If his realm was higher, then forget it. Yet, his injuries were currently incomparably severe. The strength that he unleashed was less than one-ten-thousandth in normal situation.

Under such circumstances, he was unable to complete the accumulation of strength at all.

Ye Yuan clearly eyed this point, that was why he rendered him incapable of fighting back with attacks that blotted out the heaven and covered the earth.

It was just a pity that this boy was still a little too inexperienced.

“Hahaha ... This ancestor descending upon the world anew, all you human, demon, fiend, and various races, just wait and tremble! Boy, try out this ancestor’s move! Heavenly Dao Cang Huang!”

Daymeld laughed wildly, his gaze full of contempt.

How could his realm be what this kind of crawling bug could imagine?

Ye Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, looked at Daymeld, and said coolly, “Aren’t ... you thinking too much? You could accumulate strength just because I let you accumulate strength and not your scheme prevailing! Thanks to you, this Ye just comprehended it. I have a sword move. Do you dare to receive it?”
