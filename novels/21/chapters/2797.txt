“Immediately send news back to Chaos Origin Sect! The blood race opened up a spatial channel! They are invading from the north!”

Song Miao’s words reverberated across the sky, immediately transmitting back to Northern View City.

This sentence immediately caused a huge shock.

“What?! The blood race actually appeared in our land of extreme north too?”

“How can that be! Opening up a spatial passageway, the blood race actually used this kind of shocking method!”

“Is the peace of the north finally going to end?”

In Northern View City, it was already completely shocking when they found out.

The blood race was the nightmare of the Heaven One Continent.

However, the northern lands were far away from the battlefield. It barely managed to be considered as peaceful.

‘The appearance of the blood race was a tremendous blow to them.

They knew that the originally peaceful northern lands would tum into a savage battlefield!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

One powerful aura after another came from all directions.

‘These auras were all True Sovereign Heaven!

“Brother Song, is it really the blood race?” Someone stepped out of the void, looking at Song Miao as he said with a solemn expression.

Song Miao nodded and said, “Absolutely true! That Dao friend deliberately called down heavenly punishment in order to deliver the message to us! He’s being pursued by the blood race. Let’s hurry up and save him!”

Beside Song Miao, one figure after another appeared. Eight True Sovereign Heavens actually appeared all at once!

‘These True Sovereign Heavens were all powerhouses in the vicinity of Northern View City.

‘They were originally attracted by Ye Yuan’s heavenly punishment. When Song Miao roared, they immediately knew what was going on.

Hearing Song Miao’s order, they did not hesitate in the slightest, sweeping towards the center of the storm like lightning.

On the other side, Luo Chuan also came howling while bringing an astonishing aura.

Both sides were at an explosive point.

The Chile who was currently chasing Yang Qing, his expression turned ashen at this time too.

He also realized that the surprise attack plan had completely failed!

‘Their army was actually punched through by five Saint Sovereign Heavens!

‘With Ye Yuan bringing along four people, not only did they kill their way out of the heavy encirclement, they even completely transmitted the news that the blood race came to attack, back to the humans!

Until now, Chile still felt like he was dreaming.

He looked at the Ye Yuan, who was akin to facing a great enemy, his eyes seemingly full of killing intent.

“Damn it! You, punk, must die under the Dao tribulation!” Chile gritted his teeth and said.

He did not dare to go and kill Ye Yuan, the power of this Dao tribulation was too terrifying!

Seven-nine Dao tribulation!

The heavenly punishment that Ye Yuan called down was a seven-nine Dao tribulation!

Seven-nine Dao tribulation, it was a genuine True Sovereign Dao Tribulation!

Furthermore, this was heavenly punishment, not Dao tribulation!

‘The power of heavenly punishment was even more terrifying than Dao tribulation!

One could say that this was the enhanced version of the seven-nine Dao tribulation!

The current Ye Yuan, he also felt his scalp tingle.

‘Taking the initiative to call down heavenly punishment, this was completely a death-seeking action. But he had no choice.

‘That True Sovereign Heaven was at grand completion. Even if he had the means to access the highest heavens, he would surely die without a doubt too!

Fortunately, he sensed that the powerhouses from the human race there were here!

“Damn human brat, to dare ruin my blood race’s shocking plan. I’ll definitely kill you today!”

The person had yet to arrive, but the voice arrived first.

Luo Chuan’s angry roar resounded across the horizon!

The blood race really paid a huge price for the sake of this plan!

They invested a great deal of power in the south, restraining countless human powerhouses. It was for the sake of dealing a fatal blow in the back.

But now, it failed on the eve of success!

And everything was because of this human brat!

A punk who was only middle Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Even if you’re transcending tribulation, I’m going to kill you too!

He was a grand completion True Sovereign Heaven expert, his strength being immensely formidable. He did not fear the seven-nine Dao tribulation at all.

And right at this time, the human True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses also just happened to arrive!

“Many thanks to Fellow Daoist for bringing down heavenly punishment to send the message, saving the human race, saving Heaven One Continent ...”

Song Miao said halfway and found that he could not continue anymore.

Fellow Daoist?

He discovered to his horror that the one who brought down the seven-nine Dao tribulation was shockingly just a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Fuck, a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven called down a seven-nine Dao tribulation?

Also, this densely packed blood race army, there were several thousand people!

‘There were even True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses among them!

How did this guy run over?

Song Miao only felt that his worldview was about to collapse.

How did this kid do it?

Although Yang Qing’s strength was very strong, Song Miao saw through at a glance that Ye Yuan was the backbone of these five people!

It was because he called down the heavenly punishment!

A middle Saint Sovereign Heaven, brought along four Saint Sovereign Heavens, smashed through the defense of the blood race army, and sent a message to Northern View City!

If not for seeing it with his own eyes, he would never have believed it!

This was too freaking fake!

Not just him, the True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses who dared to come were all inexplicably shocked.

‘They all thought that it was a Fellow Daoist. In the end .... it was just a junior!

“What the hell! The young ones are really to be feared!”

“This boy is going to defy the heavens!”

“Seven-nine Dao tribulation, can ... can he overcome it?”

While in shock, the True Sovereign Heavens already clashed together with Luo Chuan.

The imposing momentum was shocking!

Luo Chuan fought one-on-seven, and he did not fall into a disadvantageous position in the slightest.

This Luo Chuan was too strong.

As soon as Song Miao and the others clashed, they immediately felt tremendous pressure.

Meanwhile, another person took over Yang Qing and faced off against Chile.

This True Sovereign Heaven was the weakest, being only lower True Sovereign Heaven.

“F*cking hell, it was really too exciting with this guy! It was virtually certain death outcomes along the way! I didn’t expect that Your Father could actually survive! Hahaha ... I, Saint Exalt Azuresky, am indeed someone that heaven favors, and I will definitely dominate Heaven One Continent in the

future!” Yang Qing said with a big laugh.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Right at this time, the seven-nine Dao tribulation fell!

Three thick bolts of lightning fell together.

Countless cracks immediately appeared on the Dao sword!

Ye Yuan spurted a mouthful of fresh blood wildly, already suffering serious injuries.

The Dao tribulation this time was different from usual!

With three bolts of seven-nine Dao tribulation arriving together, the tribulation’s power was tripled!

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword was immediately severely damaged.

He was repairing the Dao sword, but the Dao tribulation did not give him time to repair it at all!

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword had not been completely repaired when another three bolts of Dao tribulation fell down.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The cracks grew even more on Ye Yuan’s Dao sword.

Ye Yuan’s complexion became deathly pale.

Heavenly punishment was indeed different from Dao tribulation!

“Hey, Ye Yuan, you wouldn’t die, right? This Dao tribulation is unusual!” Yang Qing jinxed.

‘When Song Miao and the rest who were fighting fiercely with Luo Chuan felt the power of the Dao tribulation, each and every one of them was extremely shocked too.

Just how monstrous was this kid to actually provoke Heavenly Dao until it wanted to eradicate him this much?

That Dao sword was so strong!

“Hahaha ... Watching you get smote to death by Dao tribulation, this commander is satisfied!” Luo Chuan let out a loud laugh when he saw this scene.

He did not take these human True Sovereign Heavens seriously at all.

However, he knew that he could not stay here for too long. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

‘The human race’s powerhouses were currently gathering toward Northern View City.

‘Once an Emperor level powerhouse came, he would die without a burial ground.

But before this, he was still very happy to watch Ye Yuan get smote to death by heavenly punishment.

This punk ruined the blood race’s grand matter. He deserved to die!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Dao tribulation fell down repeatedly. Ye Yuan was directly slammed until he was sprawled on the ground.

Finally, it was another three bolts of Dao tribulation.

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword collapsed with a loud bang!
