Chapter 1607 Benefiting for Generations to Come

Ye Yuan’s realm rose all the way until it reached the point that it just could not breach the next realm any longer. By then, he already stopped devouring spiritual energy. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Finally, his realm also reached peak grand completion Origin Deity Realm. He was only a step away from the Divine Lord Realm.

Seeing Ye Yuan finally stop breaking through, the others let out a sigh in relief.

“My goodness, it finally stopped! I was even wondering what if he keeps on breaking through all the way like that!”

“Elder Ye is really a freak. It’s still my first time hearing that someone can break through like this within the Origin Deity Realm!”

“What the hell do you guys know? Elder Ye is unleashing his vast accumulation over the years! With his talent, how could it be possible to not break through for 100 years? He accumulated things for a hundred years. That’s why there was this magnificent feat today!”

“Makes sense. But a hundred years’ time, breaking through from the middle-stage Origin Deity to the peak grand completion Origin Deity, this is also very heaven-defying.”

...

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s spiritual energy finally returned to tranquility. The spirit gathering formations were also slowly recovering the inner city’s spiritual energy.

During these few days, Ye Yuan had devoured no idea how much spiritual energy. Even the spirit gathering formations practically could not quite catch up to his speed of devouring already.

His breakthrough this time was really eating a fat piece of meat in one mouthful. Even if those Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were breaking through, they could not be compared with his speed of absorbing spiritual energy.

“Hahaha, congratulations, Elder Ye, for attaining the Dao and returning back!”

“Elder Ye is truly a peerless genius, to actually only use a hundred years and fully understood spatial laws!”

“Congratulations, Elder Ye!”

...

The group of elders all came forward to greet, congratulating Ye Yuan.

They knew that with Ye Yuan returning domineeringly this time, the momentum of his ascension was already unstoppable by anyone.

Moreover, he even brought a great deity back.

They heard with their own ears that the Martial Tower’s head elder, Zheng Qi, actually called that old man as his grandmaster!

At this time, Zheng Qi also brought Coldfeather and walked over. He directly clasped his hands at Ye Yuan and said, “Elder Ye, recovering Grandmaster Coldfeather who went missing for over 100 thousand years, this Zheng is endlessly gratefully!”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up and revealed a hint of surprise and said with amazement, “Brother Cold ... uh, Senior Coldfeather is actually Head Elder’s grandmaster?”

The moment he opened his mouth, Ye Yuan discovered that something was not quite right.

The Martial Tower’s head elder called him as Grandmaster Coldfeather, but Ye Yuan called him as Brother Coldfeather. Wasn’t this clearly taking advantage of everyone?

It still did not matter inside the spatial inheritance, but returning to the imperial city and learning of Coldfeather’s seniority, he naturally could not simply call him casually anymore.

Even though Ye Yuan had his pride, it did not mean that he did not understand the ways of the world.

If he called like this, even though others would not say anything on account of Coldfeather’s face, they would definitely be very unhappy in their hearts.

After all, he was just an Origin Deity Realm martial artist.

Although Ye Yuan did not fear to make enemies, provoking enemies unnecessarily like this was clearly not a wise move.

Ye Yuan was having a headache on how to address him. But who knew that Coldfeather was totally unconcerned and said, “Kid, you don’t need to be courteous with me. Let’s each do our own thing! In the future, you still call me Brother Coldfeather. As for the rest, they go about as they should. This old man was trapped for over 100 thousand years, so why would I still care about such trivial formalities? Uh, Zheng Qi is the apprentice of the disciple that I was most proud of. I also didn’t expect that over 100 thousand years passed, he actually became the Martial Tower’s head elder.”

Coldfeather did not care, but the faces of Zheng Qi and the other elders were rather awkward.

Your elderly self already said so, how could we dare to say anything more?

Ye Yuan was not a bashful person either. He also smiled and said, “Looks like Brother Coldfeather’s lineage is indeed all talented people! Even though I and Head Elder don’t interact much, I’ve also long heard that his martial prowess is unmatched, a sea-stabilizing divine needle of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City!”

The moment Coldfeather heard, he could not help saying angrily, “Let you, Younger Brother, had a laugh! What do you call this? I, as the grandmaster, am only third-layered heaven Divine Lord, while he, the grandpupil, is already ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord!”

Each sentence that Coldfeather said, Zheng Qi’s expression would be a shade more looking embarrassed.

But this kind of phenomenon indeed made people rather speechless.

Not that situations of surpassing one’s predecessors did not happen, but it was just that Coldfeather’s talent back then had amazed the entire imperial city.

Who knew that the affairs of the world were inconstant? Over 130 thousand years passed, he only cultivated to third-layered heaven Divine Lord.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Coldfeather doesn’t need to be like this. With your current realm comprehensions, breaking through to become a ninth-layered heaven Divine Lord is merely a matter of time. Misfortune may be an actual blessing. Perhaps you can unleash your accumulations and break through to the Celestial Deity Realm!”

Coldfeather chuckled and said, “That’s true! If this old man wasn’t trapped inside the spatial inheritance back then, I might really have a possibility of breaking through the fetters now and assault the Celestial Deity Realm.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Brother Coldfeather, you and I are also considered fated. When I break through to the Divine Lord Realm, I’ll help you refine medicinal pills and aid you to break through realms as soon as possible!”

Coldfeather froze, only then, recalling that Ye Yuan’s identity seemed to be a Pill Tower’s elder and not Martial Tower’s elder.

He was rather curious on what basis Ye Yuan could become the Pill Tower’s elder.

Seeing Coldfeather wondering, Zheng Qi said, “Looks like Grandmaster still doesn’t know about Elder Ye’s freakish aspect. A hundred years ago, he refined a void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill. It rocked the imperial city for some time back then!”

Coldfeather’s pupils constricted and he exclaimed, “Void spirit divine-grade! Vastsun Universe Pill! You aren’t joking with me, right?”

Zheng Qi smiled and said, “How can Zheng Qi dare to crack jokes with grandmaster? This matter, all of the elders present are witnesses.”

Coldfeather drew a cold breath and pointed at Ye Yuan as he said speechlessly, “You, kid, are truly a freak! This old man was known as Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s number one genius whose accomplishments surpassed ancient and modern times back then. But in front of you, it’s simply not worth mentioning!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Merely luck! Oh, right, Head Elder, the Martial Tower’s spatial inheritance, I’ve already improved it. In the future, if somebody wants to go in and comprehend spatial laws, it wouldn’t be so dangerous anymore. That senior who left behind the inheritance is too extreme. Although the method of inheritance is very profound, it’s also too dangerous.”

Ye Yuan did not wish to entangle on this topic and could only change topics.

Zheng Qi’s entire body trembled and he said in disbelief, “Is Elder Ye serious? It ... It can’t be joked around!”

Not just Zheng Qi, all of the elders and deacons by the side, even the protectors a little further away, after hearing this news, each and every one of them was incomparably excited.

To say that they were not moved by spatial laws, this large breadcake placed in their house, that was false.

But this large breadcake was poisonous!

Eat one bite and you would be dead, who dared to eat?

Back then, including Coldfeather, didn’t they all entered the spatial inheritance because of spatial laws, this supreme law?”

In the end?

Apart from Coldfeather being trapped inside, none of the rest came out!

But now, Ye Yuan said that he improved the spatial inheritance. How could this not drive them crazy?

Ye Yuan laughed in spite of himself and said, “Head Elder, this kind of major thing, how can this Ye dare to joke around? However, after this Ye improved it, although the spatial inheritance is much more gentler, the difficulty of comprehension also greatly increased. With this Ye’s current realm, I can only do it to this step.”

But Zheng Qi did not care and said with an excited look, “Elder Ye truly did a great thing that benefits the Martial Tower for generations to come!”
