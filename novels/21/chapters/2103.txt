Chapter 2107: Voidrush Grand Spirit Pill

Qi Yun could not help being stunned. He did not expect that not only did his suggestion not scare Ye Yuan, the other party seemed like a hungry wolf that saw a little lamb instead.

That kind of eyes made him very uncomfortable.

Being counter-asked by Ye Yuan, he froze.

After all, since it was a wager, they also had to take out an equivalent treasure.

Treasures that could rival the Qilin emperor bone, he could not make the call.

“Heh, really gutsy! Do you really think that you’re invincible under the heavens after being conferred Second Sage? This Empyrean can make the decision to take out the Qilin Clan’s peak Empyrean spirit treasure, Jadecleanse Truefire Bottle. With this bottle, you can execute another innate divine ability of the Qilin Clan, Jadecleanse Truefire! Since you obtained the emperor bone’s recognition, you should know the power of this innate divine ability! Using it to bet with the emperor bone should be sufficient!” Qi Chen spoke up.

The moment these words came out, Qi You and Qi Yun’s faces changed drastically.

“Elder Chen, you mustn’t! The Jadecleanse Truefire Bottle is our clan’s precious treasure! How can it be easily brought out to wager with him?” Qi Yun’s face changed as he said.

Even Xin Luo turned pale with fright and cried out in surprise, “Is Brother Qi Chen overly agitated? I heard that an Empyrean powerhouse of your esteemed clan had once wielded the Jadecleanse Truefire Bottle to execute the innate divine ability, being evenly-matched in strength with a human Heavenly Emperor powerhouse! This kind of precious treasure, you’re actually taking it out to bet?”

Qi Chen smiled coldly and said, “That’s right! However ... this Empyrean is very confident in Qi Zhen’s alchemy skills. He’ll let this Second Sage know what’s called a frog at the bottom of a well!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up and he said with a grin, “Okay, deal!”

He naturally knew about this innate divine ability. This was an innate divine ability that required Empyrean Realm before it could be awakened, its power immense.

As soon as it was executed, it could virtually obliterate heaven and earth!

This Jadecleanse Truefire was different from Feng Tianyang’s low level martial technique. If it was executed, even if Ye Yuan was proficient in spatial law, it would also be insanely difficult to want to escape.

As long as he got this Jadecleanse Truefire Bottle, Ye Yuan would have one more trump card, his strength would surely increase greatly.

Being a peak empyrean spirit treasure, this was already a pinnacle-most treasure in the Heavenspan World.

In terms of value, it was not the slightest bit inferior compared to the emperor bone too.

Furthermore, now that Ye Yuan obtained the Qilin bloodline, using this empyrean spirit treasure would be just right.

As for that so-called Qi Zhen, he really did not take him seriously.

In this Heavenspan World, if Eight-star Alchemy Gods did not emerge, there would really barely be anyone that could surpass him in Alchemy Dao.

“Humph! Just you laugh, you’ll cry later!” Seeing Ye Yuan’s determined appearance of getting it, Qi Chen’s anger flared out of the blue.

“When the time comes, the one who cries will probably be you,” Ye Yuan said smilingly.

... ...

Returning to his residence, Ye Yuan started closed-seclusion to refine pills.

“Master, what medicinal pills can these spirit medicines refine? I’ve never heard of it.” Loneswan looked at the pile of spirit medicines in front of him and asked with a frown.

The pill formulas of rank six spirit medicines, with his status as a Seven-star Alchemy God, he naturally knew a lot.

But the spirit medicines that Ye Yuan sourced for this time, he could not find the appropriate pill formula even after digging deep within.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You naturally haven’t heard before. This is the pill formula that I created. It’s called Voidrush Grand Spirit Pill.”

Loneswan opened his eyes wide and said in disbelief, “The ... The pill formula that you created yourself? Then ... how is it compared to the Heavenly Mandate Secular Forgetting Pill?”

Ye Yuan answered with a question, “What do you think?”

Loneswan swept a glance over these spirit medicines and said hesitantly, “If refining a medicinal pill with these spirit medicines, it will probably at least be two times and above of the Heavenly Mandate Secular Forgetting Pill, right?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “If it’s just two times, what am I refining it for? The same grade Voidrush Grand Spirit Pill, the medicinal effect is five times and above that of the Heavenly Mandate Secular Forgetting Pill!”

“F-Five times? M-Master, this ... this ...” Loneswan opened his eyes wide, stammering until he already could not speak.

Ye Yuan naturally knew why Loneswan was shocked. Once this pill formula was brought out, it would absolutely set the world on fire. Probably the entire Heavenspan World’s alchemy world would have tumultuous waves stirred up.

It might even startle the Medicine Ancestor.

The improvement of ordinary medicinal pills, being able to increase 10% of the medicinal effect was already very impressive.

Compared to this Voidrush Grand Spirit Pill, those pill formulas that Ye Yuan brought out in the Southern Border were simply weak to the max.

The shock in Loneswan’s heart simply could not use words to describe.

Ye Yuan was able to create such a heaven-defying medicinal pill, then would there still be other medicinal pills that he newly-created in his hands?

Once these medicinal pills surfaced in the world, a sanguinary slaughter was bound to be stirred up in the Heavenspan World.

The allure of this kind of pill formula was too great!

But what was even more appealing was still Ye Yuan this person!

Once this matter was exposed, Ye Yuan would surely fall into a dangerous situation.

A person who was able to create a pill formula with five times the medicinal effect, that was simply an existence that was going to defy the heavens.

It was also precisely because of this that Ye Yuan kept a tight-lip towards outsiders.

Loneswan already proved his loyalty. That was why Ye Yuan would let him come and observe the refinement of the Voidrush Grand Spirit Pill.

“Huhu, good that you know. Don’t leak half a word about this to the outside,” Ye Yuan said with a smile.

Loneswan’s expression became somber, and he immediately raised his hand to the sky and swore a Heavenly Dao Oath.

Ye Yuan nodded slightly, expressing satisfaction.

The implications of this matter were too great. Loneswan being so sensible, his painstaking efforts were not in vain.

Swearing a Heavenly Dao Oath, Loneswan did not have any dissatisfaction but was very happy instead. Because this represented that Master already trusted him immensely.

Otherwise, how could he let him know about this kind of earth-shaking important matter?

It seemed like he was indeed not wrong in abandoning Jiu Luo Ji’s foundation and following Master!

When the pill refinement started, Loneswan became more and more shocked in his heart.

The complexity of refining the Voidrush Grand Spirit Pill and the brilliance of the technique, he never saw these in his lifetime.

Loneswan knew that Ye Yuan’s refining speed was extremely fast and the quality was extremely high.

But this single mere rank six divine pill, Ye Yuan actually expended one entire day’s time.

“Turned out that this is Master’s true strength!” When Ye Yuan finished refining, Empyrean Loneswan sighed with admiration.

He had seen before Ye Yuan taking action, and he even fought with Ye Yuan before.

But the alchemy strength that Ye Yuan displayed in front of outsiders was merely the tip of the iceberg.

And this Voidrush Grand Spirit Pill was the major accomplishment of Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength!

Only at this moment did Loneswan know how superficial his understanding of Alchemy Dao was.

He also had a never-before resolve to follow Ye Yuan.

After Ye Yuan adjusting his breathing for a moment, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “How’s the harvest?”

Loneswan said respectfully, “Akin to dispelling the clouds and seeing the bright moon!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “You’re a Seven-star Alchemy God, and you are already very close to the Great Dao. When Master refines pills in the future, you follow by the side and experience it with all your heart.”

Loneswan’s face revealed great joy, and he said respectfully, “Many thanks, Master!”

This kind of pill refinement that was close to Dao, ordinary people did not even have the chance to experience it. This was a massive lucky chance, so how could Loneswan not be happy?

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Withdraw. Master is going into closed-seclusion.”

Loneswan answered respectfully and withdrew.

Experiencing the pill refinement by Ye Yuan’s side this one day, with his rank seven soul force, he actually could not quite bear it anymore too.

He had to go back and rest, then digest the comprehension he had this time carefully.

Half a month later, a powerful aura rose to the sky inside the secret chamber.

Ye Yuan finally broke through to the Seventh Firmament Origin Pill!
