Chapter 769: Crimson Afterglow Valley

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhao Qian’s words made Ye Yuan and Jun Tianyu both stunned.

Without waiting for them to react to it, Pei Wenqiang already barged inside hastily.

“Ye Yuan, this City Lord came to grace you with his grand presence, and you actually dare to not go out and welcome!” Pei Wenqiang said gloatingly.

Ye Yuan said with a black face, “It’s clearly you who forcefully barged inside yourself. Is there still reason?”

Jun Tianyu said coolly, “Ye Yuan, want to sweep him out or not?”

Pei Wenqiang’s expression choked up and suddenly discovered that Jun Tianyu actually broke through to Third Level Heaven Enlightenment already, and already caught up to him on cultivation realm.

But in terms of concepts comprehension, he could not catch up to Jun Tianyu even by whipping his horse. Jun Tianyu wanting to sweep him out of the door was probably just a simple matter too.

“Hey, I’m warning you guys! I’m the Ancient Opulence City’s City Lord for now! If you all dare to touch me, bear the consequences yourself!” This time, it was Pei Wenqiang’s turn to pull a black face.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said impatiently, “Alright, stop flaunting your City Lord’s power and prestige! You be the City Lord, I’ll run my Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. Let’s stay in our own lanes and mind our own businesses! Speak, what did you come to find me for?”

Pei Wenqiang was pissed the moment he heard that. “Heh, what high-sounding sentiments! Your shop is opened in my territory! To actually dare have such an attitude towards me! Do you believe that I’ll make you close down shop for good or not?!”

Talking until here, Pei Wenqiang seemed to be even more pleased with himself as he thought and said, “It’s decided. Later, I’ll make people come to impound your Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. See if you still dare to be so insolent towards this City Lord!”

Ye Yuan laughed and said, “Is that so? Recently, there just happens to be another person finding me. Because I couldn’t bear to part with the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, so I didn’t agree. Since you seized the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, it helped me make this decision.”

Pei Wenqiang laughed loudly and said, “Heh, found a path to retreat so quicklyhuh? I wonder who your next player is? You also know my big brother’s status in the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land. Whichever organization you go to, I’ll make them close down! I want to see who dares to take you in!”

Ye Yuan fished out a token very helplessly and played with it a little in his hand.

Pei Wenqiang had yet to have any reaction, but when Zhao Qian saw that token, she could not help being struck dumb with amazement as she said, “The Heaven’s Destiny Trading Company’s gold token! You ... Why would you have this kind of thing?”

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, “I didn’t want it. People insisted on forcefully pushing it to me.”

It was indeed Zuo Xin who forcefully pushed it to Ye Yuan. In order to make Ye Yuan accept this token, Zuo Xin almost knelt down for him.

Pei Wenqiang’s expression changed drastically too as he said, “This ... This is the Heaven’s Destiny Trading Company’s gold token! Isn’t it said that in the entire Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, only the Holy Lord alone has this thing?”

Ye Yuan gave Pei Wenqiang a glance rather surprisedly and said, “Looks like I underestimated you. Didn’t think that you actually even know about the gold token.”

Pei Wenqiang’s expression was ugly as he said, “I ... I heard my big brother mention it before when I went to the Heaven’s Destiny Trading Company’s Crimson Afterglow branch to buy things.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan was enlightened as he said, “Oh, turns out it’s like that. Oh, right, didn’t you want to seal up my Fragrant Medicine Pavilion? Quickly seal. What are you still waiting for?”

“H-Haha, just now I was just cracking a joke, cracking a joke, Younger Brother Ye, you don’t take it seriously. Ah! Only cared about making jokes, I almost forgot that coming today was for for proper business.” Pei Wenqiang suddenly thought of something and hurriedly changed the topic

What kind of joke was this? This gold token, only a holy lord would have one in the entire holy land. Then what possessing it signified was already understood without being told.

Sealing up the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion?

The Heaven’s Destiny Trading Company was a Rank One Holy Land; much more powerful than the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, this sort of Rank Nine HolyLand. 1

If Ye Yuan really went to the Heaven’s Destiny Trading Company, he could use the status this token represented to screw him to death effortlessly.

Zhao Qian was absent-minded by the sides. It was also uncertain what she was thinking about.

But Ye Yuan was somewhat curious about Pei Wenqiang’s intent for coming and asked, “What are you finding me for?”

Pei Wenqiang said, “It’s like this. The Crimson Afterglow Holy Land will be organizing a Quasi-Holy Son selection competition a month later. Each faction subordinate to the holy land has three quotas. About this, when I received this news, I thought of you right away and plan on giving you a spot. How is it? Sincere enough, right?”

“Quasi-Holy Son selection competition? Not interested!” Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and refused immediately.

Other martial artists longed to enter the holy land very much. But Ye Yuan did not need it.

Becoming a so-called Quasi-Holy Son was nothing more than getting the holy land’s high regard, then obtaining a certain amount of cultivation resources, such as cultivation methods, such as medicinal pills.

Yet, these things, the present Ye Yuan could resolve all of it himself. Likewise, he could also settle it himself in the future.

Because in the Divine Realm, the ones who lacked money the least were alchemists.

As long as Ye Yuan was willing, he could earn truckloads of earth essence crystals.

The establishment of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion also proved this point. Just a short two to three month’s time, Ye Yuan’s current wealth already exceeded 10 million earth essence crystals. This to an ascender who had just ascended for merely several months was simply something unimaginable.

Yet, Ye Yuan accomplished it!

Carrying the title of ‘junior with the greatest hope of achieving Alchemy God’, if Ye Yuan could not even earn this bit of cultivation resources, that would also be too trashy.

“Heh, you still don’t know, right? The rewards for the Quasi-Holy Son selection competition this time are exceptionally generous. Not only will the first place obtain a high-grade profound artifact, but he can also even get the chance to enter the Crimson Afterglow Valley! The Crimson Afterglow Valley! My elder brother, as one of the Seven Holy Sons, didn’t even get the opportunity to enter the Crimson Afterglow Valley before!” Pei Wenqiang was actually quite agitated as he said.

The Crimson Afterglow Valley from Pei Wenqiang’s mouth, Ye Yuan had never heard of it before. He naturally did not know why he would be so agitated too.

Rather, Jun Tianyu was quite surprised as he said, “The Crimson Afterglow Valley is the place Holy Lord Crimson Afterglow Holy Monarch attained the Dao. It’s said that it opens once every three hundred years. Each time, only three people can go in! These three names have always been selected from the holy land’s holy sons. Why did they actually organize such a Quasi-Holy Son selection competition this time? This kind of thing has never happened before in the past.”

Even though Jun Tianyu did not enter the holy land, he was not foreign to the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s secrets.

Pei Wenqiang said, “Who cares! As long as I can charge into the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land, no matter how great a price you make me pay, I’d be willing too! Sadly, my age is too old and can’t take part in the competition this time at all.”

But Ye Yuan asked, “This Crimson Afterglow Valley, could it be that there is anything different?”

Jun Tianyu nodded his head and said, “It’s said that the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land was originally a Rank One Holy Land, ruling more half of the White Valiant Region! It’s just that no idea why, the Crimson Afterglow Holy Lords became more incompetent with each passing generation later on. Today, it actually became a Rank Nine Holy Land. But one thing is for sure, the Crimson Afterglow Holy Land’s rise and decline have a very close relationship with this Crimson Afterglow Valley. Because each generation’s Holy Lord came out from the Crimson Afterglow Valley. This point has never changed before. The holy land organizing the Quasi-Holy Son selection competition this time unprecedentedly is probably for the sake of breaking the curse too, hoping to find the emergence of a junior disciple who can attain the Dao in the Crimson Afterglow Valley.”
