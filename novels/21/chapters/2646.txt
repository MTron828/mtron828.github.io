Chapter 2652: Vying!

Once true grade emerged, the subsequent competitions were already completely meaningless.

Even if they refined until the sky collapsed, it would also be impossible to reach the realm of true grade. It would just be beating a dead horse.

Therefore, Cui Tong simply announced that the Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit this time, Calm South City took the top spot!

Seeing Sun Yunjing’s aggrieved face, Su Yi was simply grinning from ear to ear.

Putting aside feeling exaltation upon fulfillment, their Calm South City would even obtain a huge amount of resources. This was a tangible benefit.

Not only that, Ge Ling’s strength rose after receiving pointers from Ye Yuan.

Surpassing Zuo Fang was already a foregone conclusion!

It could be said that Calm South City became the biggest winner of the Nine Cities Heavenly Pill Summit this time!

“Haha,?Master Ye, I, Su, really had my nose up in the air! This Su apologizes to you once more here!”

Su Yi gave a bow towards Ye Yuan with incomparable sincerity this time.

He was really convinced!

His daughter really did a great thing this time.

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said coolly, “Since this matter is over with, forget it.”

Su Yi saw that Ye Yuan was free from pride and prejudices and immediately climbed up the rope hand over hand and said, “Master Ye, this Su sincerely invites you to join our Calm South City. I wonder what Master Ye thinks?”

Before waiting for Ye Yuan to reply, Sun Yunjin suddenly gave a bow to Ye Yuan and said, “Master Ye, previously, it was all this Sun who had eyes but couldn’t see! Now, this Sun wants to invite you to join Water Billow City! You rest assured. The terms that our Water Billow City offers will definitely be better than Calm South City!”

“Sun Yunjing, you!” Su Yi said in a great rage.

He did not expect that Sun Yunjing would actually kill-steal!

Furthermore, comparing resources, Calm South City really could not compare to Water Billow City.

Otherwise, they also would not have failed to hire a top master like Zuo Fang.

Sun Yunjing said indifferently, “Su Yi, Master Ye and you have only met for the first time as well. Furthermore, he and Little Girl Su also merely just became acquainted. Since that’s the case, why can’t this city lord invite him? Who in the nine cities doesn’t know that this City Lord has always craved talents like a thirsty person for water!”

Su Yi was angered until he clenched his jaws tightly, he knew that what Sun Yunjing said was the truth.

Previously, everyone all misunderstood that Ye Yuan intentionally got close to Su Yi in order to court Su Peiyun.

Now, everyone knew that it was not the case anymore.

Master Ye had no interest in Su Peiyun at all.

Furthermore, Su Peiyun and Master Ye merely met along the way. They were also not some life-and-death friends.

Then everyone had a chance, no?

“Master Ye, our Skybless City invites you to join with the utmost sincerity!”

“Master Ye …”

With Sun Yunjing taking the lead, the other few cities’ city lords joined in one after another.

Each of the terms offered was better than the last.

Su Yi wished to tear this bunch of fellows to shreds by the side.

He hurriedly winked at his daughter, Su Peiyun was panicking long ago.

But what could she say?

Could she say that their encounter previously was not a happy one?

Originally she thought that Ye Yuan was just powerful in Martial Dao. She did not expect that his Alchemy Dao was even more terrifying than Martial Dao!

True grade coming into being, it was bound to cause a great sensation in the Land of Heavenly South.

At this time, she felt that saying anything was feeble.

Su Peiyun looked at Su Yi with a bitter smile on her face.

Right at this time, Cui Tong’s cold snort sounded out. He said,?“Humph!?Are the few of you trying to snatch people from Heavenly South City?”

He came in front of Ye Yuan, beaming widely as he said, “Master Ye, Heavenly South City is the capital city of the Land of Heavenly South, ruling all of the cities! The resources of Heavenly South City are also not comparable to other cities. As long as Master Ye joins Heavenly South City, you can have anything you want!”

These words made everyone’s faces change abruptly.

Even Master Cui Tong actually already started to call him as Master Ye!

Heavenly South City snatching people, what business did the others still have?

At this time, everyone’s eyes were focused on Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan had a calm expression on his face, unable to tell what he was thinking.

Boom!

Suddenly, spiritual energy surged in the arena.

The heaven and earth spiritual energy from all directions gathered over here crazily.

“Hahaha?… I understand! I finally understand! Incredible! Truly impressive! It’s well-deserving of being true grade, a mere grade two heavenly pill actually let me break through!” Within the venue, Jiang Li’s loud laughter sounded out.

It turned out that Jiang Li actually broke through!

After obtaining the true grade Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill, Jiang Li’s mind was fully absorbed in it.

He did not know the slightest about outside matters.

After observing for a long time, Jiang Li could not understand the profound aspect of the true grade heavenly pill too.

Hence, he simply swallowed it in one gulp.

The best way to feel a medicinal pill was to take it.

In his view, no matter how powerful this true grade heavenly pill was, it was also a merely grade two heavenly pill. There would not be any effect.

He had to comprehend it carefully and grasp the mystery of the true grade heavenly pill.

As a result, once the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill entered his abdomen, a wild power of rule surged within his body.

The small world in his body seemed to have been inspired by something.

At that moment, the realm of Jade Sovereign Heaven that he failed to break through for a long time, actually broke through!

Sublime Realm to Sovereign Realm was a huge threshold.

Recalling back then, Luo Yunqing’s sword intent was astonishing, and he was likewise at a standstill in front of this gate for a long time.

If not for him forcing himself into a desperate situation so that he could risk it all, he probably would not have broken through so easily either.

It could be seen how difficult it was for Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum to break through to Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum!

Even though Jiang Li was extremely talented, he had stagnated in front of this step for a long time too.

It was precisely because he failed to break through for a long time, that he chose to join Water Billow City, and change the environment to comprehend the world.

It was just that the effect was not good.

He never dreamed that a measly little grade two heavenly pill actually let him break through!

Everyone was shocked to the core. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A grade two heavenly pill let a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum break through?

At this moment, Cui Tong, Wu Dao, Ji Chun, Su Yi, Sun Yunjing, their gazes stopped on Ye Yuan’s face.

They looked at this young face and felt that it was mysterious to the extreme.

“This … True grade heavenly pill is actually so fearsome! A tiny little grade two heavenly pill actually helped a Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum break through to Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum!” The shock in Cui Tong’s heart was written all over his face.

Everything that happened today simply subverted his understanding.

“Is this true grade? Above ninth grade, truly incredible!” Wu Dao also exclaimed with admiration.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Actually, the Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill that you all look down on most is the strongest heavenly pill! It’s not that a true grade heavenly pill is very strong. Jiang Li’s cultivation realm has originally reached the peak of Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum, being only a hair’s breadth away from Jade Sovereign Heavenly Stratum. Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill is about cleansing the marrow and rebuilding the foundation. It can let a mortal body be reborn anew and enter Heavenly Stratum. And true grade heavenly pills integrate Great Dao accumulations; not only did it strengthen the medicinal effect, it can even spur comprehension ability! Jiang Li breaking through under this kind of circumstances isn’t coincidental.”

Hearing Ye Yuan’s explanation, Cui Tong and the rest felt like it was another language.

The most basic Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill was actually the strongest heavenly pill!

To them, the strongest meant pursuing more difficult heavenly pills and higher quality heavenly pills.

No one would waste their energy on the measly little Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill.

But at this time, they discovered that they were really wrong.

Ye Yuan’s statement had subverted their understanding!
