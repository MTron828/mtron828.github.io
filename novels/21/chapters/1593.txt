Chapter 1597 Spatial Inheritance

Sure enough, the following few days, Ye Manor’s doorway was trampled to the ground.

Requesting for pills, acknowledging as a master, sucking up to people, so on and so forth.

Long Zhan was the Ye Manor’s chief steward now. These few days, it busied him terribly.

The people coming to the Ye Manor, the lousiest were also Divine Lord Realm powerhouses.

Origin Deity Realm juniors could only follow behind their elders obediently and give Ye Yuan their regards.

Originally, he was still somewhat not used to it. But later, he discovered that everyone was unbelievably courteous to him.

Only then did he knew that being stained by Ye Yuan’s light, even though his realm was not high, he already became Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s most in-demand chief steward.

Most likely, Head Elder’s and Second Elder’s stewards could not compare to him now either.

After so many years of trials, Ye Yuan already returned to him his freedom when he came back this time.

Ever since then, Long Zhan was even more committed to Ye Yuan.

He knew that Ye Yuan could give him a future with infinite possibilities.

At this time, he looked at Lin Dong from a commanding position and said coolly, “You go back, His Excellency won’t see you.”

Lin Dong was full of bitterness in his heart. How could he know that Ye Yuan was actually such an astonishing great talent? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A moment of hesitation offended Elder Ye, this great deity, to the core.

Lin Dong smiled bitterly and said, “Steward Long, I know that Elder Ye is dissatisfied with this Lin. But this time, I specially came to make a humble apology and ask for punishment. Steward Long, please notify!”

Long Zhan did not even ask for instructions and directly shut the door in Lin Dong’s face.

Long Zhan gave him a glance and said coolly, “Protector Lin, sometimes ... there will only be one chance. Miss it and it will never come back again. Wavering hesitantly when the opportunity comes will only ruin your own future.”

Lin Dong said vexedly, “Steward Long, this matter was indeed this Lin’s fault. It’s just ...”

Long Zhan interrupted him and said, “It’s just that Head Elder is powerful, you don’t dare to offend, is it? Protector Lin, if you were His Excellency, do you think that he’d continue to use you? It’s precisely because Head Elder is powerful that he needed you to step forward bravely at that time, isn’t that so? You wanted to wait for a victor to be decided between Head Elder and Second Elder before choosing which team to side with, don’t you feel that it’s very shameful?”

Lin Dong opened his mouth but could not find the words to refute.

Long Zhan said coolly, “Protector Lin, I’m just an insignificant servant. Not that I’m intentionally making things difficult for you, but I have to try to figure out the intentions of upstairs too. If I can’t share His Excellency’s worries, before long, I’d be kicked out by His Excellency too. You’re a high and mighty Divine Lord Realm powerhouse, while I’m just an unexceptional minor character. Once I’m kicked out by His Excellency, there wouldn’t be room for me to survive in this Heavenly Eagle Imperial City anymore!”

Long Zhan said these words neither obsequiously nor haughtily, and also lightly plucked himself out. It could be said to be watertight.

Lin Dong gave Long Zhan a deep glance and said with a bitter smile, “Following Elder Ye, Steward Long’s future accomplishments definitely won’t be beneath this Lin’s! I’ve disturbed everyone, so this Lin will take his leave!”

Finished talking, Lin Dong took his leave.

Ye Yuan was able to refine a void spirit divine-grade Vastsun Universe Pill. Wanting to create a Divine Lord Realm powerhouse was truly too easy.

Long Zhan’s talents might never be able to step into the Divine Lord Realm. But it could not be helped that he followed a good master who might help him to break through!

Looking at Lin Dong’s departing back view, Long Zhan just smiled.

Actually, he thought so as well.

...

“You want to enter the Martial Tower to train?”

Inside the Ye Manor’s lounge, when Xuan Yu heard that Ye Yuan actually wanted to go to the Martial Tower to cultivate, he had a look of amazement.

As an elder, they could enter the Pill Tower or Martial Tower once every hundred years.

Presently, the Pill Tower and Martial Tower were opened. The disciples selected were also going to enter inside to cultivate.

But Xuan Yu never thought that Ye Yuan was actually not going into the Pill Tower to cultivate. Instead, he decided to enter the Martial Tower.

Looking at the surprised Xuan Yu, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “What does Second Elder feel that I can comprehend further by entering the Pill Tower?”

Xuan Yu could not help choking. Ruminating for a moment, he discovered that Ye Yuan really did not seem to have anything he could comprehend by entering the Pill Tower.

Ye Yuan’s Alchemy Dao strength had virtually reached the pinnacle already.

The comprehensions inside the Pill Tower were likely mostly of little value to him.

Ye Yuan could even refine a void spirit divine-grade divine pill. The comprehensions that could help him were truly in the minority.

The remaining road could only rely on Ye Yuan himself to walk.

Xuan Yu thought about it and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “You brat, if those words were heard by outsiders, who knows what they would think. However ... what you said is true. There truly isn’t too many things that can help you inside the Pill Tower.”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I heard that there are spatial law comprehensions inside the Martial Tower?”

Xuan Yu’s expression changed and he said, “You want to go and comprehend spatial laws? No way, it’s too dangerous!”

Ye Yuan said curiously, “Isn’t it just comprehending Dao? Why would it be dangerous?”

The reason why he had the thought of entering the Martial Tower was because of spatial laws.

He seemed to have reached a bottleneck comprehending spatial laws himself and had never made too big of a breakthrough all along.

Hearing that there was a complete spatial laws inheritance in the Martial Tower, Ye Yuan had the idea stirring in his mind, but he did not think that there was actually danger in it.

Xuan Yu said, “The comprehensions of spatial laws were left behind by a Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s predecessor. Inside the tower contains spatial laws first-layered heaven and second-layered heaven complete law comprehensions. But the comprehension of spatial laws is extremely dangerous. A single misstep and you would be lost inside, never getting out.”

Ye Yuan’s brows raised up and he said rather surprisedly, “It’s actually so dangerous?”

Xuan Yu nodded and said, “Spatial laws is an extremely high-level law, who wouldn’t it be fatal? But after that predecessor left behind the inheritance, he once warned future generations, saying that we have to think twice before we act. However, how many can resist the temptation of spatial laws? That generation, there were several dozen disciples who entered inside, even quite a number of elders. But ... not a single one came out before! Later, there were naturally disciples who did not believe in heresy as well, insisting on entering inside. But, until now, nobody has yet to be able to walk out of inside before! That place is already all of the Martial Tower disciples’ forbidden land.”

Ye Yuan was alarmed when he heard it. He did not expect that comprehending spatial laws would even be so perilous.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Xuan Yu even thought that Ye Yuan was afraid and said with a smile, “Ye Yuan, your Alchemy Dao talent is impressive. So you should focus on Alchemy Dao. You’ll have greater achievements in the future! There are times when a person’s strength just won’t cut it. Walking on the path of martial arts and alchemy at the same time, one might be empty-handed in the end!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Many thanks for Second Elder’s concern, but I have a score in my heart. Hence ... this Martial Tower, I still want to go and give it a try!”

Xuan Yu even thought that he had already convinced Ye Yuan. Who knew that saying it was like not saying, he still insisted on entering the Martial Tower.

The Pill Tower finally managed to acquire such an unparalleled genius. If he fell inside the Martial Tower, it would really be painful until they could not breathe!

Why was this boy so stubborn?

Ye Yuan naturally had his thoughts. In the view of Second Elder, there was the Martial Tower guarding, they could focus on studying Alchemy Dao.

But to Ye Yuan, he would not place his hopes on others.

Only when one’s own strength was powerful that one could protect themselves!

This was a lesson he learned and paid in blood, so he would not repeat it!
