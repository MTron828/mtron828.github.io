Chapter 1614 Powerful Spatial Laws

Ling Zikun’s expression was very ugly. He looked at Ruo Xu and said in a solemn voice, “Brother Ruo Xu, are you messing with me? Making an elder go and deal with my disciple, what is this if not bullying the weak as the strong?”

Actually, Ling Zikun knew that he was quibbling.

Ye Yuan’s age was even much younger than Gu Han, so this argument could not hold water at all.

If want to say, he could only say that Gu Han’s talent was much worse than Ye Yuan’s.

For a Three-star Alchemy God to possess such terrifying talent, it truly made people be in despair!

These few years, he had always felt smug because of taking in Gu Han, this disciple, and also liked to bring Gu Han along to challenge everywhere.

During these recent few years, Gu Han had seen few defeats.

But today, they really kicked an iron plate.

Ye Yuan looked to be merely a little kid, but this little kid was already an honorable elder!

How could Ruo Xu be that easy to bluff? It was only to see him chuckled and said, “Brother Zikun, Elder Ye is my Pill Tower’s elder. This old man doesn’t have that authority to direct him to go and teach your disciple a lesson. Moreover, even though Elder Ye is a Pill Tower’s elder, his age is even much younger than Gu Han. To talk about my Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s real strongest young genius, it should be him! You saying these words is a baseless false accusation.”

Ruo Xu was refreshed in his heart. For the first time, he had gratitude, this emotion, toward Ye Yuan.

In this one month, he had suffered quite a bit of loss. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In front of Ling Zikun, he never raised his head before.

Ling Zikun’s face was black as the bottom of a pot as he said in a solemn voice, “Resorting to sophistry in self-justification! No matter what, he’s an elder! How can he go and compete with this old man’s disciple?”

Ruo Xu gave him a glance and said with a smile, “Elder Ye is really disdainful to take action against your disciple. You aren’t aware, back then, he casually taught Ning Siyu that lass for a few days and she defeated my disciple. If my conjectures are right, he’s here to stand up for Ning Siyu that girl.”

Ling Zikun’s expression flickered incessantly and he said in a solemn voice, “Humph! So what?! My disciple is skilled in alchemy and martial arts. When he beats your Elder Ye, then your Heavenly Eagle Imperial City will utterly lose its face!”

But when Ruo Xu heard, he did not refute it.

That meaningful smile made Ling Zikun’s heart palpitate.

Could it be that this Elder Ye was even a martial art expert?

Impossible!

This Elder Ye was so young, his Alchemy Dao had already reached sublimity. So how could his Martial Dao possibly be stronger than Gu Han?

But what was with Ruo Xu’s expression?

...

“Eldest Senior Brother, this Elder Ye’s alchemy talent is too terrifying! But in martial arts, he definitely can’t match up to Little Junior Brother!”

The sword-grasping youth nodded and said, “Little Junior Brother fused the law of wind and law of fire. Furthermore, the two powers of laws are comprehended extremely highly. Ordinary same rank martial artists are not his match at all. Moreover, this Elder Ye’s realm is not even as high as his.”

“Huhu, this Elder Ye thinks that he’s a genius. He’s too condescending! Even if it’s me, if at the same realm as Little Junior Brother, I’m definitely not his match either.”

The sword-grasping youth smiled and said, “When Little Junior Brother defeats this Elder Ye, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City will have utterly lost its face.”

Gu Han looked at Ye Yuan proudly and said with disdain, “Make your move! My realm is higher than yours, so I’ll allow you three moves, lest that others say that I am bullying you!”

With him saying those words, people revealed odd looks again.

Elder Ye is an existence who comprehended spatial laws, and you allow him three moves?

This ... How fearless is this punk?

Sure enough, Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I, as an elder, could it be that I can still take advantage of you, a junior? Want to allow, it’s also me who allows it. How about this? Feel free to make your move, and I won’t retaliate. As long as you can touch the corners of my sleeves, consider it my loss!”

Gu Han seemed to have the funniest joke in the world. He wondered if this Elder Ye’s head had a problem?

Could it be that Ye Yuan did not hear that he had already swept across the Martial Tower?

Could it be that Ye Yuan did not know that he fused the law of wind and law of fire?

Yes, he must not know of it!

Posturing huh?

Want face because of your identity as an elder?

You’re just a Pill Tower elder, not Martial Tower elder!

Gu Han’s senior apprentice brothers also froze when they heard it, and they immediately exchanged glances and smiled.

The sword-grasping youth smiled and said, “This Elder Ye is also an interesting person.”

Gu Han laughed in spite of himself and said, “My Elder Ye, this is what you said! When you lose in a while, you’ll bow to me six times all the same!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Of course, I’m as good as my word.”

When Gu Han heard that, his face fell and a powerful aura spread out.

The battle previously, Gu Han did not even attack with his full strength.

But this time, he decided to go all out.

This man in front of him made him somewhat jealous!

He, being a genius, it was his first time being challenged by others!

He was truly unable to imagine it that a young man who was so much younger than him actually already became the Pill Tower’s elder.

This was a disgrace to me.

“Wind Fire Setting Sun!”

Two powers of law blended in perfect harmony. Two kinds of terrifying spiritual energy displayed unrivaled power under the turbulence of the power of law.

When everyone saw this scene, each and every one of their faces revealed shock.

Only now did they know how great Gu Han’s talent was!

It turned out that when he dealt with the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s geniuses, he actually did not do his best!

At this time, the fire borrowed the wind’s momentum, the wind helped the fire to blaze. The powerful attack came down onto Ye Yuan overwhelmingly.

This power gave people a feeling of palpitation.

However, Ye Yuan was composed, not moving a muscle. It was as if he did not have the intention of evading at all.

Seeing this scene, Gu Han could not resist laughing coldly, “Courting death!”

He was very confident in his attack. Ye Yuan actually did not dodge or evade. What was this if not seeking death?

But in the next instant, Gu Han’s eyeballs nearly popped out.

“Impossible! How ... How can it be like this?!” Gu Han said with a look of disbelief.

Gu Han’s attack suddenly disappeared several dozen feet in front of Ye Yuan.

When it appeared again, it already passed through Ye Yuan, directly arriving behind him.

Boom!

The grand array shook violently. This attack blasted onto the protective grand array solidly.

“Eldest Senior Brother, what happened? That Elder Ye didn’t move at all, why did Little Junior Brother’s attack pass right through him?”

The sword-grasping man’s expression changed drastically and he cried out in shock, “Spatial laws! My eyesight isn’t failing, right? How is this possible?”

The sword-grasping man’s junior brother said in disbelief, “Spatial laws? Eldest Senior Brother, are you mistaken? How can there possibly be someone who comprehended spatial laws while being at the Origin Deity Realm?”

The sword-grasping man had shock written all over his face as he said, “It’s absolutely spatial laws, no mistake! Furthermore, his spatial laws comprehension is already very high! Little ... Little Junior Brother has lost! He doesn’t have any chance! No wonder Elder Ye dared to utter such brave words. Turns out that he actually comprehended spatial laws!”

Gu Han’s expression was ugly to the extreme. Gritting his teeth, he said, “I ... I don’t believe that I can’t take care of you!”

Done talking, Gu Han’s figure moved, dashing over toward Ye Yuan like lightning.
