Chapter 2536: Another Window!

Walking into the meeting hall, ridiculing voices flooded into Ye Yuan’s ears like tidewater.

Compared to Jun Tian’s matter, everyone is clearly more interested in this one point affinity ‘heavenly alchemist.’

Everyone knew that Gu Mao’s conjecture was merely a theoretical possibility.

For a Lower Realms ant who just ascended to want to kill Jun Tian, this grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven, the likelihood was negligible.

Moreover, Ye Yuan this ascender completely had no connections with Jun Tian.

The Inklight Forest was so big. Even if they were ran into each other, it would also be Ye Yuan who dies, and not Jun Tian.

“B-Big Brother, this is Second Prince, His Highness!” Tang Yu diverted the topic carefully.

He did not feel that Ye Yuan could really extract the Dragonbone Grass.

Ye Yuan naturally could not be bothered to pay attention either and said to Second Prince neither obsequiously nor haughtily, “I pay respects to Second Prince, Your Highness!”

Second Prince nodded his head slightly and said, “You’re Ye Yuan? I heard that there’s a wager between you and Master Gu?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Precisely so!”

Second Prince smiled and said, “It’s already been 18 years. I wonder how Brother Ye’s refinement technique has been trained until?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Just so-so.”

The moment these words came out, it attracted another wave of loud laughter.

“A one point’s so-so, wonder what it’s like?”

“Can’t do it means can’t do it, still puffing his face up at his own cost!”

“Brother Gu, you got to be more careful! When a one pointer becomes fierce, you might not be a match!”

… …

Second Prince also could not help but smile when he heard that. This ascender was rather interesting. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Yuan was like a clown in his heart.

Clearly did not have strength, but wanted to pretend to be capable here.

The world was laughing at him, but he found joy in it and was indifferent.

This kind of person was really funny.

“Huhu,?since you’ve already trained until so-so, this wager has already dragged on for 18 years. Why not this prince bear witness for you guys and complete this wager? How about it?” Second Prince said with a laugh.

Ye Yuan valued each word like gold, saying indifferently, “Can.”

Everyone roared with laughter again.

Gu Mao smiled and said, “Brat, this old man has waited 18 years for you. Each time I came to find you, they always say that you were in closed-seclusion!?Huhu,?this old man wants to see today, just how formidable a one point heavenly alchemist is!”

Ye Yuan sized him up with a glance and said, “No wonder you’re so high-spirited. Looks like you should have obtained a treasure that can suppress the fire poison in your body.”

Gu Mao was still roaring with laughter a moment ago, but now, his expression changed.

He was seen through again!

A few years ago, he obtained a treasure called Iceheart Jade. Although it could not purge the fire poison thoroughly, it could suppress it temporarily.

Therefore, these few years, his courage bolstered again.

Seeing Gu Mao’s laughter abruptly cease, how could everyone present not know that Ye Yuan hit the mark?

Only then did they know that turns out Gu Mao was actually already plagued by fire poison!

This surprised them greatly. It seemed like this boy was also not utterly useless.

Tang Yu was secretly shocked. No wonder Gu Mao was so enthusiastic today, turns out that he had a reliance!

Originally, the Tang Family’s greatest card was this. But Gu Mao having who obtained the treasure was no longer afraid of the Tang Family.

Gu Mao’s expression turned cold, and he said,?“Humph!?So what if yes? Right now, this old man already doesn’t fear the fire poison. You still want to use this to threaten me?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “It’s useless! Your treasure can only treat the symptoms, not the root cause. The more you suppress, the greater the power of the eruption in the future! Unless, you don’t touch Dao fires in the future.”

Gu Mao snorted coldly and said, “Stop exaggerating things to raise an alarm! You’d best think about how to clear this hurdle today!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said coolly, “Do it now then.”

Gu Mao was taken aback, not expecting Ye Yuan to be so straightforward. He said with a cold snort, “Putting on an appearance! Since that’s the case, you watch carefully!”

The Dragonbone Grass was long already prepared. Gu Mao rolled his sleeves. The Dao fire in his palm directly ignited.

After a bout of garish tempering, the crystal clear paste of Dragonbone Grass appeared before everyone.

This act naturally attracted a series of shouts filled with amazement.

Even Second Prince also nodded his head slightly and said, “Master Gu’s skill is becoming more and more refined! I’m afraid that apart from Master Lin, there are few in this Eastward Country who’s Master Gu’s match anymore.”

Master Lin that Second Prince spoke of was the royal family’s retainer, Eastward Country’s one and only grade two heavenly alchemist.

These words were flattering.

Gu Mao was naturally beside himself with joy and said respectfully, “Your Highness is too kind! My trivial technique, I dare not show off! However, apart from Master Lin, there’s someone that this Gu also doesn’t dare to say that I can win for sure! After all, one point is too scary!”

“Hahaha?…”

Another burst of laughter.

Second Prince smiled at Ye Yuan and said, “Brother Ye, Master Gu already did one refinement. The rest is up to you! Why don’t you let us take a look at the fruits of your 18 years of hard work?!”

Ye Yuan nodded slightly and similarly rolled his sleeves up, the Dragonbone Grass coming directly into his palm.

He slowly closed his eyes, carefully feeling the undulations coming from the Dragonbone Grass.

A cluster of Dao fire bloomed faintly.

When Gu Mao saw the situation, his pupils could not help shrinking.

“This boy’s fire controlling technique improved significantly again!” Gu Mao said in shock.

Originally, Ye Yuan’s fire controlling technique already reached the acme of perfection, akin to performing an art.

But today, 18 years later, Ye Yuan’s fire controlling technique actually reached a new level again!

If it reached the acme of perfection 18 years ago, then now, it was returning to one’s original simplicity!

No dazzling flaunting of skill, only a simple and unadorned return!

When the rest saw this scene, they were similarly incomparably shocked.

They did not expect that Ye Yuan was actually a practitioner!

However, the affinity fluctuation emanating from Ye Yuan’s body made them come to their senses very quickly.

“Heh,?no matter how good the fire controlling technique is, it’s useless too! Without affinity, the door to become a heavenly alchemist will forever be closed!”

“Indeed a really weak affinity! I completely can’t feel the undulations!”

“Huhu, he’s clearly refining the Dragonbone Grass, but why do I feel like it’s in two different worlds?”

… …

Same as 18 years ago, Ye Yuan still did not have any undulation of affinity.

Second Prince’s gaze revealed a trace of fascination. Ye Yuan’s fire controlling technique had amazed him.

But very soon, he shook his head secretly, clearly feeling quite regretful.

Such a good fire controlling technique was wasted!

Ye Yuan naturally did not care about these people’s mocking. He was already completely immersed in his own world.

There was a good saying, if heaven closed a door for you, it would definitely open a window for you!

In these 18 years, Ye Yuan only did one thing, which was opening this window!

During these 18 years, refining day and night, day in and day out of repetitions, fumbling year after year.

He trained his instinct to the limit!

It was still a region of chaos in front of him.

But he had the keenest instinct toward Alchemy Dao!

The Dragonbone Grass in front of him melted little by little, turning into a paste.

The paste of Dragonbone Grass became more and more crystal clear!

The entire hall gradually fell into a dead silence.

The original ridiculing voices had long already disappeared. What replaced it was shocked expressions!
