Chapter 2481: Heavenspan Token

Dividing a mountain and ruling!

This matter was decided just like that.

What Ye Yuan said represented the attitude of the myriad races.

No one refuted it!

Even Lin Chaotian and the rest of the nine great Dao Ancestors did not dare to refute it either.

Refuting it would mean that they would be facing the divine race!

Concerning the might of the divine race’s progenitors, they already had a profound experience. No one would be stupid.

Disregarding other things, just talking about the two great Ten-marks powerhouses, they were not what the human race could deal with.

Of course, none of these mattered.

The important thing was that the Doomsday Battle did not need to be fought anymore!

Ye Yuan suppressed the all-powerful divine race that possessed two mighty Ten-marks powerhouses with his power alone!

No earth-shaking great battle!

No abyss of suffering!

The divine race accumulated for ten billion years to stage a comeback. How colossal was the momentum?

However, Ye Yuan destroyed the army first, and then he suppressed progenitors afterward, averting a war that would obliterate heaven and decimate the earth to nothing.

Such achievements surpassed the ancients and amazed the contemporaries!

After this battle, the divine race went on a large-scale migration and entered the Heavenspan World.

The myriad races also issued a strict order to immediately withdraw from the west of the Heavenspan Mountain.

An unprecedented grand migration unfolded in the Heavenspan World.

But to the vast majority of the martial artists, not fighting a war was naturally the best.

The world of martial artists was full of slaughter. But this kind of Doomsday Battle was a little too cruel.

Under such a war, even if your strength was immensely formidable, you would ultimately be cannon fodder.

Back then, how powerful were humanity’s 18 Grand Ancestors? But in the end, they turned to dust too.

Once the Doomsday War started, it would be equivalent to a meat grinder. Even if many powerhouses were not willing to get involved, it was inevitable to be affected too.

Therefore, within the human territories, they were practically all talking about Ye Yuan’s great achievements.

Talking about information, it was naturally Bao Inquire who was the most well-informed.

Currently, Bao Inquire was already surrounded by a large group of Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, inquiring from him about the beginning and end of the human and divine war.

Bao Inquire had a look of exultation, recounting the scene of Ye Yuan battling three great progenitors by himself.

His eloquence was good too, talking like it happened to him personally.

All around him, the Heavenly Emperors listened with intoxication.

Talking until the exciting parts, Bao Inquire himself was also very excited.

“That ninth true dragon spirit struggled to free itself bit by bit. You all can’t imagine the expression of the divine race’s Progenitor Tian Qing. It was wonderful! He wished to rush forward and crush that ninth true dragon spirit! The eight true dragon spirits got stronger and stronger, and the three great progenitors were looking like they were giving out!” Bao Inquire said with a look of exultation.

A Heavenly Emperor by the side said nervously, “Then … Then after that?”

Actually, the Heavenly Emperors present already knew the outcome long ago.

In the end, the ninth true dragon spirit collapsed and did not appear.

But the atmosphere was already built up to this point. They seemed to have already forgotten about the result, and they were only following the plot.

After all, a human battling three great progenitors by himself, no one was able to imagine this sort of thing before this at all.

Nine great Dao Ancestors being able to defeat a progenitor one-on-one was already something very impressive. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In reality, it was simply impossible for them to be a progenitor’s match.

Regarding this point, everyone was clear in their hearts too.

But Ye Yuan battled three great progenitors by himself. Just thinking about it made people feel their hearts leap.

Let alone that he nearly defeated three great progenitors!

Bao Inquire let out a sigh and said, “Unfortunately! Right at this time, Lord Saint Azure’s blood vitality was depleted, and the ninth true dragon dissipated. But you all don’t know something. If Lord Saint Azure could really summon the ninth true dragon spirit, the divine race might not even have gotten half of this world currently! You didn’t see back then when Lord Saint Azure gave a cold laugh and asked Progenitor Tian Qing whether he had the qualification to threaten him or not. Progenitor Tian Qing hurriedly retorted saying that the divine race can enter the Heavenspan World; saying that this was what Ye Yuan said earlier! That expression was fearful of Lord Saint Azure going back on his word!?Hahaha?… Feels really invigorating!”

“Yeah! Really feels f*cking awesome!”

“Don’t the divine race call themselves the messengers of heaven all day long, invincible under the heavens? Lord Saint Azure really slapped their faces resoundingly!”

“Isn’t that so! If they are the messengers of heaven, then as the human race’s representative, Lord Saint Azure is heaven!?Hahaha?…”

… …

The group of Heavenly Emperors all had excited looks on their faces, feeling honored.

Ever since the divine race came into being, the secrets of history were dug up bit by bit. Virtually all of the human powerhouses were living in the shadow of the divine race.

The might of the divine race made them unable to breathe.

Today, they finally felt exaltation upon fulfillment!

It was Saint Azure who gave them the chance to walk with their heads held high!

But Bao Inquire reined in his expression and said with great veneration, “Lord Saint Azure’s achievements are worthy of all of us to remember! Although he’s already respected as a grand ancestor powerhouse, he’s completely different from those nine old thieves! He has compassion for all life, and he’s truly fighting for the human race! Even during that war, he didn’t forget to warn the divine race to not harm the innocent! If not for him, we’d have already become the divine race’s slaves now, and be doomed for all of eternity!”

The Heavenly Emperors felt the same way, nodding their heads one after another.

Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were indeed the Heavenspan World’s supreme powerhouses.

But in front of Doomsday Battles, in front of this kind of Doomsday Battle, Heavenly Emperors were too insignificant.

Dao Ancestor-level powerhouses were the world’s real masters!

They already surpassed the level of ordinary martial artists and would not care about the life and death of ordinary people at all.

But Ye Yuan was different!

His actions made these Heavenly Emperors feel respect!

That was right! It was respect!

Reaching Ye Yuan’s level, he completely did not need to care about the life and death of ordinary martial artists.

But he still fought for all living things!

He did not bemoan the state of the universe and pity the fate of mankind, but in front of the cardinal principles of righteousness, he would never give in!

“Lord Saint Azure is well-deserving of being a man of great talent and virtue through the ages! If it was me, being framed by the nine great Dao Ancestors and being spurned by numerous people, I’d never have stepped forward!”

“That’s right! Lord Saint Azure is a saint! He doesn’t refrain from killing, but he also doesn’t kill innocent people indiscriminately. In front of the principle of right and wrong, he proceeds without hesitation!”

“Yeah! Lord Saint Azure created the legend of the human race! His achievements illuminate through the ages. He is really worthy of all of us admiring him!”

… …

Talking up to here, these Heavenly Emperors all expressed admiration from the bottom of their hearts.

Actually, before this battle, many people had already lost hope.

The nine great Dao Ancestors offended Ye Yuan to the core.

Their shamelessness had no lower limit at all.

But in the end, Ye Yuan still stepped forward and overturned the raging tides.

Just as they were chatting idly, a massive ripple suddenly set off in the direction of the Heavenspan Mountain.

A series of comets flew out from the Heavenspan Mountain, tore across the horizon, and flew to each corner of the Heavenspan World.

A powerhouse said in surprise,?“Mn??What happened to the Heavenspan Mountain again?”

“Ever since Heavenly Dao Samsara, the Heavenspan Mountain couldn’t be entered anymore. Now, I don’t know what’s happening.”

Bao Inquire’s gaze flickered and he said,?“Heh heh,?looking at this appearance, it should be the Heavenspan Token! The Doomsday Battle has just subsided; I’m afraid that … another sanguinary slaughter is about to be set off again!”

The gazes of the Heavenly Emperors turned intent and they asked, “What’s this Heavenspan Token for?”

Bao Inquire smiled and said, “You all should not think much about it! This thing is a calamity. It is not a blessing for you guys! Without Deva Fourth or Fifth Blight strength, better don’t think about it!”
