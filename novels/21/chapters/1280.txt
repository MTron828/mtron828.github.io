Chapter 1284: Law Enforcement Hall

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Your Excellency, according to your instructions, all humans have already been expelled out of the Demon Region. Moreover, the Mystic Gate has already issued the order, announcing dissolution ...”

In the hall, Cao Yunzhi reported to Ye Yuan about the direction of the human race’s progress very meticulously.

The human race had its own set of survival rules. With Ye Yuan chasing them out of the Demon Region, before long, they would form a new arrangement.

The demon race’s losses were similarly very heavy in order to resist the assault of the fiend race, and they needed to rest and build up strength.

Ye Yuan already issued a strict order, within a hundred years, if any humans invade the Demon Region, they would be killed without mercy!

Even though the martial artist world was originally the weak being prey and the strong feasts, Ye Yuan did not wish to repeat the same mistake as with the stoneman clan’s incident.

After hearing the instructions, Ye Yuan said coolly, “You’ve done very well! Although the Mystic Gate has already disbanded, the fiend calamity this time probably requires a thousand years, even longer, before we can recover some vitality. During this period, the Divine Realm naturally can’t avoid killing. Hence, I’m preparing to set up a Law Enforcement Hall, which is independent of the Divine Realm, specifically to punish those people who are utterly devoid of conscience. This Law Enforcement Hall will be managed by Senior Skydistant. The operation of the Law Enforcement Hall will be left to you to be in charge then.”

Cao Yunzhi trembled all over. But the look of wild ecstasy on his face could not be concealed no matter what.

He was extremely clever, how could he not understand the significance of this Law Enforcement Hall?

This shall be a powerful force that transcended the entire Divine Realm. It shall be the Heaven Surmounting Divine King’s spokesperson!

With Ye Yuan’s awe, this force could be said to be the Divine Realm’s overlord.

While he would be this force’s operator in practice. The scope of his authority could be said to surpass the Divine Realm.

Cao Yunzhi already knew that Skydistant’s strength was even stronger than Fang Tian.

Furthermore, establishing this Law Enforcement Hall, the Spirit Bristle Divine King they all would definitely join.

This was actually just another Mystic Gate!

He indeed bet correctly back then!

Cao Yunzhi prostrated on the ground and said agitatedly, “Yunzhi thanks Your Excellency for the promotion! Yunzhi will definitely do his very best to serve till the end of his days!”

Ye Yuan looked at him with a smile that was not a smile and said, “Having you be in charge of the Law Enforcement Hall’s operation is naturally because you have this ability. You’re a clever man and should know how great the authority I’ve bestowed upon you! But, if you dare to use power to seek personal gain, making use of the Law Enforcement Hall’s strength to eliminate dissidents and build your own force ... Kanuo’s outcome, you saw it!”

Ye Yuan’s tone became increasingly colder. Cao Yunzhi felt like the entire sky was almost collapsing, making him instantly feel like he had fallen into an ice cellar.

The wild elation from before instantly turned into a mountain-like pressure.

Right now, Kanuo was still wailing incessantly in the sky!

Just a moment ago, a whole bunch of thoughts had indeed flashed across in his inner-heart.

But now, a fire in his heart burned all these thoughts away.

This one in front of him was the Divine Realm’s master!

An existence that controlled Heavenly Dao!

His might made the entire world tremble.

No one could surpass him!

“Your Excellency, rest assured. Even if you lend Yunzhi a hundred galls, Yunzhi won’t dare either!” Cao Yunzhi hurriedly said.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said, “I can naturally trust you, but let’s get the unpleasantness out of the way first. On my trip to the outside world, firstly it is in order to save Lingxue. In addition, it’s also for the sake of rebirthing the Divine Realm’s glory! If I discover that somebody stabbed me in the back, I’ll make him wish he’s dead! Understood?”

Cao Yunzhi’s expression turned fearful, and he said, “Yunzhi understands!”

Seeing Cao Yunzhi’s appearance, Ye Yuan knew that his words took effect.

Cao Yunzhi was a smart man and also indeed the best candidate to manage the Law Enforcement Hall. But he was absolutely not an upright gentleman. If he did not knock and beat him, he might do something in the future.

Behind the World Locking Gate, the danger of the turbulent spatial flow, apart from Li-er, White Light they all, only Fang Tian alone knew.

Even if Ye Yuan really met with some mishap inside the turbulent spatial flow, Cao Yunzhi absolutely would not dare to mess around either.

Cao Yunzhi was very clearly how powerful Ye Yuan’s current strength was!

“En, you’re a clever person, and should be able to guess my objective of establishing this Law Enforcement Hall! This Law Enforcement Hall’s constitution will be drawn up by you. I just want one point, that is not to intervene in the Divine Realm’s affairs. But also don’t allow extreme things to happen, got it?” Ye Yuan said solemnly.

Ye Yuan’s goal was very simple. He just wanted to come up with a transcendental force to grasp the Divine Realm’s developmental direction.

The existence of the Law Enforcement Hall was much higher than the status of the Holy City.

What it represented was Ye Yuan himself.

When Ye Yuan is not in the Divine Realm, it would be up to the Law Enforcement Hall to manage the Divine Realm on his behalf.

Cao Yunzhi’s expression became stern, and he said, “Your Excellency rest assured. Yunzhi will definitely satisfy Your Excellency.”

After Cao Yunzhi left, Skydistant and Fang Tian walked out from behind the curtains.

After Skydistant was rescued by Ye Yuan, he immediately took action and thoroughly annihilated the Yu Soul Sect’s Dao legacy.

With his strength, Cloudsky they all did not have any room to resist at all.

Being suppressed for a million years, Skydistant finally vented a breath of foul air.

Of course, this was all thanks to Ye Yuan.

He was originally not planning on coming out already. Did not expect that Ye Yuan actually took control of Heavenly Dao and easily let him out.

“Huhu, fine means! Carrot and stick, even if you leave the Divine Realm, that kid probably won’t dare to seek power for personal gains either,” said Skydistant who raised a thumbs up to Ye Yuan.

“Heh, this boy is really a freak! Not only is he a cultivation genius, but he also has a very good grasp on the human heart! Cao Yunzhi that brat is a real piece of work. Disregarding his formidable strength, his cunningness is also first-rate. If Ye Yuan doesn’t play this move, even Teng Yun, the few of them, might end up as his hired thugs too! But no matter how he jumps around, he’s also completely cornered by Ye Yuan,” Fang Tian also laughed and said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “There are no two ways about it; he’s still afraid of my strength! In front of absolute strength, any schemes are useless.”

Fang Tian nodded and said, “That’s right. With your current strength, it’s not up to Cao Yunzhi to not fear the sword suspending above.”

Skydistant said, “Ye Yuan, when are you planning on leaving?”

Ye Yuan said, “After three months! Only after I settle the Divine Realm’s matters can I leave without any fears of trouble back at home.”

Before leaving, the things that Ye Yuan had to do were too many.

Li-er, Lu-er, White Light, he had to placate all of them well. Apart from this, he even took the time to make a trip to the Lower Realms and fetched Ye Hang and the rest to the Divine Realm.

With his current strength, doing these was just a matter of a single thought.

Ye Yuan prepared many medicinal pills for Ye Hang’s family, sufficient for them to cultivate to the Divine King Realm. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This departure for the Heavenspan World, Ye Yuan did not know how long he would travel.

But Ye Yuan knew that over there, a million years was but a snap of a finger.

Ye Yuan did not wish for when he returned, his parents already returned from dust to dust.

Having Ye Hang they all cultivate to Divine King Realm and supplementing with medicinal pills, it was sufficient for them to live for as long as several tens of thousands of years.

The few people were currently chatting when Ye Yuan’s mind suddenly stirred, his brows knitting together.

Through Heavenly Dao, Ye Yuan detected that somewhere in the Divine Realm, there was a surge of terrifying undulation that billowed to the sky.

“What’s wrong, Ye Yuan?” seeing Ye Yuan’s expression, Fang Tian asked in a solemn voice.
