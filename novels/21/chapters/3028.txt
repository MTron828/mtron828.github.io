Chapter 3027: Divine Ability, Eight Spatial Celestial Pole Escape!

“Roar!”

Zhao Yue turned into a streak of lightning and met with this bloody light.

This was his instinct. In order to protect Ye Yuan, he would spare no effort.

Zhao Yue’s combat strength approached Supreme Hegemon, but he was not when all was said and done.

It was only to hear a loud bang. Zhao Yue was directly blasted flying.

However, Wang Zuo’s target from the very beginning was not Ye Yuan but Zhao Yue.

How great was the power of a Supreme Hegemon’s all-out blow?

The terrifying aftershock rippled out, sweeping over toward Ye Yuan rapidly.

Very soon, it completely engulfed him!

“Ye Yuan!”

“Ye Yuan!”

… …

The eyes of Long Jian and the others turned blood-red.

They all did not expect that the blood race’s hatred toward Ye Yuan was so great.

In order to kill Ye Yuan, seven Hegemons died in this wave!

This was exchanging multiple lives for a single life!

Seven great Hegemons, what kind of terrifying force was this? It was used to exchange for the life of an Emperor Vast Heaven just like that!

It could be seen how crazed this bunch of guys were.

Long Jian and the rest were caught off-guard.

“Hahaha?… This hateful punk is finally dead! Finally dead!” Wang Zuo said with a wild laugh.

With Ye Yuan dead, he was really happy until he was flying.

If not for this brat, how could exterminating Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven have been so troublesome?

Right at this time, a figure crawled out of the void.

Who was it if not Ye Yuan?

It was just that the current Ye Yuan seemed like he was hauled out of a pool of blood, looking very scary.

He made use of spatial rule and saved his own life with incomparable peril but was extremely heavily wounded.

Ye Yuan beckoned his finger at Wang Zuo, revealing a row of pearly white teeth, and said with a smile, “Lord Wang Zuo is very happy?huh??Having fought so many times with you, only this time your action is passable. But unfortunately, it was off by just a little bit. Come, again!”

The smile on Wang Zuo’s gaze suddenly ceased.

Such a strong aftershock, it was sufficient to even kill Emperor Sakra Heavens. This kid actually did not die!

“It’s spatial rule. He comprehended a divine ability!” Bloodsky said.

He was a spatial origin Hegemon. He was the most sensitive to space.

When Ye Yuan crawled out, he clearly felt the undulation of a divine ability, and he could not help feeling shocked in his heart.

Divine ability was exclusive to at least origin powerhouses.

But Ye Yuan was just Emperor Vast Heaven, and he actually comprehended a divine ability!

Wang Zuo’s pupils constricted, and he said in astonishment, “D-Divine ability?”

Even Long Jian also said in shock, “T-This boy!”

Hegemon Imperishable said, “This kid has a myriad origin seeds in his body, plus his comprehension in the path of space is extremely deep. Comprehending a divine ability isn’t strange either.”

Cloudneon gave Imperishable a glance and said, “Lord Imperishable, you’re being an armchair quarterback.”

Imperishable shot her a glare and said, “Nobody will treat you as a mute if you don’t speak!”

Fusing four great true spirit bloodlines, comprehending saint force, and also comprehending chaos divine essence, he seemed to have taken the expressway when it came to comprehending rules.

Just before returning to Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven, he comprehended a divine ability, Eight Spatial Celestial Pole Escape!

It was also by relying on precisely this move that he escaped alive from under Wang Zuo’s hands.

“Roar!”

With an angry roar, Zhao Yue returned to Ye Yuan’s side again.

Forcibly resisting a blow from Wang Zuo, he was covered all over in blood too.

However, he did not have the slightest intention of backing down. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Jian and the others also took this opportunity to close off the ranks again, not giving Wang Zuo the slightest chance.

Right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred!

One ray of bloody light after another, shot out of the void, illuminating the entire sky like a blood-colored setting sun.

A powerful aura instantly covered the entire Blood God Temple.

The entire Blood God Temple space actually started to crumble.

It was because this region of space was unable to withstand the power of the Chaos Bloodstone coming into being.

It could be seen how strong this power was!

Wang Zuo, Bloodsky, and the rest of the blood race Hegemons, all revealed wildly ecstatic looks.

“Hahaha?… Ye Yuan brat, you brought so many experts. In the end, it’s futile too! The mother stone is about to come into being right away! At that time, all of you will have to die! All will have to die!” The look in Wang Zuo’s eyes was full of fervent heat.

Even if he had reached Supreme Hegemon, his subservience to the mother stone would not change in the least bit too.

Bloodsky said agitatedly, “How many years has it been? This moment has finally arrived! The mother stone coming into being, the moment where my blood race will unify all the heavens and myriad worlds, has come!”

“Welcoming the mother stone’s birth!”

“Welcoming the mother stone’s birth!”

“Welcoming the mother stone’s birth!”

… …

At this moment, the blood race Hegemons actually ignored the experts around them, bowing down with devoutness one after another.

When Long Jian and the others saw this surge of formidable power, each and every one of their expressions changed greatly.

This kind of feeling was like the crumbling on doomsday.

They could not resist looking toward Ye Yuan one by one.

“So strong! This pressure is absolutely not beneath Progenitor Mi Tian! Ye Yuan, can it really work?” Long Jian said in a solemn voice.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “I don’t know either!”

The faces of the group of Hegemons fell, wishing to smack this kid to death with a slap.

This reply was wholly irresponsible!

You freaking hoodwinked so many powerhouses over. In the end, it was coming to court death?

Ye Yuan said coolly, “The few of you, stop deceiving yourself as well as others! With the Chaos Bloodstone coming into being, do you all think that you can stand aloof from the affair? He has 33 clones, all in the Great Beyond Realm! The higher plane clones have long already been born, with their strength being unfathomable! After the 33 clones combine bodies, you all can imagine how strong he’ll be! Maybe, he’ll push open the Door of Eternal Life in one go!”

All the Hegemons stopped talking.

This species war that swept across all the heavens was even more brutal than the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s war back then.

Just as Ye Yuan said, none of them could stay detached from the matter.

This was saving Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and also their own self-redemption.

“I don’t know about the other planes, but this Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven clone might be our only chance! As long as we seriously injure him, the Chaos Bloodstone won’t be able to achieve grand completion, and it probably won’t be that easy for him to push open the Door of Eternal Life anymore!” Ye Yuan continued.

“Haha?… Shamelessly boasting little villain! A mere Emperor Vast Heaven wants to deal with the mother stone too! Ye Yuan, don’t you forget. You swindled the mother stone’s origin and even plotted against him. He remembers these scores! After he is born, it will be your death date! Up in the heavens and down below ground, no one can save you!” Wang Zuo said with a wild laugh.

No one paid attention to him.

Long Jian said in a solemn voice, “Kid, how much confidence do you have?”

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “10%.”

The faces of Long Jian and the others instantly turned black again.

“Just 10%, this is also too low, right?” Long Jian said crossly.

“Who do you think this guy is? This guy is an existence that’s going to sweep across all the heavens! I’m just a puny little Emperor Vast Heaven, it’s already very impressive to be able to have 10% confidence, alright? If you’re capable, how much confidence do you have?” Ye Yuan similarly said crossly.

Long Jian was choked badly by Ye Yuan.

Got to say, he really had no solution at all.

Such a terrifying pressure, he could not get close at all.

Although a Great Beyond powerhouse was a Hegemon too, they were existences on another level.

That was a realm of nothingness that could not be described.

But without a doubt, each Great Beyond powerhouse was terrifyingly strong.

In the void, Zhuo Bufan looked at the blood-colored heart in the distance and was silent.

Suddenly, he sat down cross-legged, his body emitting a shocking sword intent.
