Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

One figure after another dashed out of the fog. Luo Chuan’s eyes turned intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “Where are they?”

The coastline was starkly empty. Where was there still a hint of any presence?

Han Guang’s pupils constricted, and he gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Damn it! Those few punks must have broken through the encirclement!”

“Trash!”

Luo Chuan yelled loudly in shock and rage: “How great a price did our blood race pay for this northern war situation? Even Hegemon Bloodsky acted personally! Now, it failed just a step away from success!”

Han Guang was in fear and trepidation, immediately kneeling down.

How could he not know the severity of this matter? But how could he have known that a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven could slash him with one sword move?

This sort of thing was seriously too surprising!

“Ming Xu, you lead the army to station here. This commander will go and chase after those humans. I hope that I can make it in time!” Luo Chuan instructed and immediately disappeared.

Ye Yuan five people killed their way out of the heavy encirclement, fleeing while fighting.

Chile was fearful of Ye Yuan’s Dao sword and did not dare to pursue alone. He could only order the army to chase him down together.

But, the closer they got to the continent, the greater the risk of being exposed.

Right now, the blood race’s setup had yet to be completed!

Once detected by the northern powerhouses, the previous efforts would be wasted.

Just based on them, these True Sovereign Heavens and Saint Sovereign Heavens, it was naturally impossible to take down Heaven One Continent.

‘Wanting to gain a firm foothold in the north, the more important thing was still the cooperation of Emperor level powerhouses and Hegemon level powerhouses!

Without them, any random human Emperor level powerhouse that came could eradicate them.

“Still chasing? You keep chasing, and I’m really going to kill you!” From ahead came Ye Yuan’s cold laugh.

Chile’s face turned black, and he said in a solemn voice, “If you have the capabilities, try killing this commander!”

“Is that so? Then I’m coming!”

Done talking, Ye Yuan slashed a sword out backhandedly, heaven and earth changed colors!

The horrifying to the extreme aura made Chile’s expression change wildly, his figure suddenly descending.

But this sword did not land.

Ye Yuan suddenly beamed and said, “Huhu, still bluffing you!”

F*ck, it was another feint!

Chile practically wanted to vomit blood!

‘Along the way, Ye Yuan used this move to trick him three or four times already.

Each time he saw that he was going to catch up, Ye Yuan would do it once.

Yet, he really had no choice.

Once he got too close, this sword of Ye Yuan’s could really take his life.

Ye Yuan’s sword heavily wounded Commander Han Guang with a chop. His strength was significantly worse than Han Guang’s. He reckoned that even if he did not die, he would become crippled too.

In the blood race, trash had no existence value.

Chile had no choice and could only hang behind Ye Yuan like this, reducing their speed.

He could only hope that Lord Luo Chuan could rush over as soon as possible and kill this vile spawn.

This boy was too hateful!

“Still chasing? I’m already home!” Ye Yuan said with a grin.

Sure enough, extremely far away, the outline of a city already slowly appeared in his field of vision.

During the chase, both parties already flew an extremely far distance.

Along the way, there were naturally traces of human activities too.

But Chile split off a portion of the army and immediately started massacring!

It was for the sake of keeping the secret.

Ye Yuan was completely clueless about Heaven One Continent. But, the appearance of the blood race made him have some judgment.

Most likely, Heaven One Continent’s situation was not optimistic!

‘The blood race appeared behind the continent without a sound. It was likely an extremely important strategic intent.

He came just at the right time and bumped into it!

The most important mission now was to let the human powerhouses know.

Otherwise, not only would he have to die, but Heaven One Continent would also probably fall completely into enemy hands!

Mi Tian said before that the blood race was a very terrifying race. They would devour their opponent’s blood and grow stronger the more they fought!

Once they gain a firm foothold, even more powerful blood race powerhouses would appear!

But right at this time, a shocking aura engulfed everything and swept over from a distance!

‘The faces of Ye Yuan and the rest changed wildly.

This aura was far too strong!

It was an existence that he could not possibly kill even if he brought out the Dao sword!

Chile naturally sensed it too and said with a big laugh, “Boy, you probably … can’t go home anymore! Commander Luo Chuan is a grand completion True Sovereign Heaven. You’re dead for sure!”

The other party’s speed was too fast!

‘They did not have time to escape into the city at all and would be caught up to!

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned intent, and he said in a solemn voice, “Yang Qing, hold him back!”

Yang Qing’s strength naturally could not compare to Chile.

However, he was also strong enough. Delaying for a short while was still doable for him.

However, this way, the five people immediately got caught in the army’s encirclement!

Ye Yuan completely ignored those blood race members, directly controlling the Dao sword to rise to the sky.

Ye Yuan’s Dao sword immediately became a giant sword, shooting straight to the sky!

‘The Saint Sovereign Heavens that approached Ye Yuan were directly obliterated by the sword energy exuding off of the Dao sword.

Rumble

As if sensing Ye Yuan’s Dao sword, dark clouds immediately gathered overhead above the sky, lightning flashing and thunder rumbling.

Ye Yuan pointed at the sky with the sword once again!

Furthermore, along with the increase in Ye Yuan’s strength, heaven’s might was several dozen times stronger than in the past!

The sky within a radius of several tens of thousands of miles was shrouded by this layer of dark cloud.

At this moment, countless powerhouses were shocked!

‘What Ye Yuan wanted was this effect!

Far away, Luo Chuan’s expression changed wildly, knowing that the plan this time had completely failed!

On top of Northern View City’s walls, several figures looked into the distance across the space.

Northern View City was the city closest to Ye Yuan.

Song Miao was this Northern View City’s city lord.

A subordinate exclaimed, “City Lord, which senior is this that’s transcending their True Sovereign Dao Tribulation? This power is so terrifying!”

He had seen before City Lord, His Excellency, transcending True Sovereign Dao Tribulation before. It was merely nothing more than this.

And City Lord, His Excellency, was an upper True Sovereign Heaven mighty expert!

But, Song Miao’s brows furrowed together, and he said in a solemn voice, “This isn’t a True Sovereign Dao Tribulation! This is … heavenly punishment! The person transcending the tribulation is a divergent cultivator! However … why would someone be transcending their tribulation in that direction?

There seems to be something odd about this matter.”

The subordinate also said with uncertainty, “Yeah, there are many humans and true spirits over there. It isn’t some good place to transcend tribulation. Why would there be someone who chose to transcend their tribulation here?”

The place to transcend tribulation, most people would choose a quiet and remote place.

After all, transcending tribulation was having nine chances to die and one chance to live. If someone interfered, that would be certain death.

Such a clamorous place was not suitable to transcend tribulation at all.

Yet, someone was transcending tribulation. Furthermore, they caused an extremely huge commotion.

“This sovereign will go over and take a look. You all guard the city and activate the city protecting grand array and wait in full battle-array!” After he was done talking, Song Miao’s figure swayed, and he headed for the place where the tribulation was being overcome.

He was a True Sovereign Heaven powerhouse. His speed was swift to the extreme.

But very soon, his expression changed wildly!

Blood race!

‘There were actually a large group of blood race powerhouses in the center of the storm!

The hallmark of the blood race was very obvious. Once they started to fight, blood energy would surge to the sky. It was very easy to identify.

“This … This place is the land of extreme north. Why would there be blood race members here? Could it be that … they secretly opened up a spatial passageway and plan on invading Heaven One Continent through the sea?”

Song Miao guessed the general idea very soon. But this conjecture made him break out into a cold sweat due to fright.

This news was seriously too important!
