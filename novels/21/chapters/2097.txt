Chapter 2101: I’m His Opponent

“Haha! Surpass Lord Redplume? Just based on you?”

Gongyang Lie seemed to have heard an extremely hilarious joke, with his expression full of disdain.

What kind of powerhouse was High Priest Redplume? Gongyang Lie served by his side for so many years and was all too aware.

Eight million years ago, High Priest Redplume rose up from insignificance, sweeping across the entire Demon Divine Region with his astonishing aptitude.

Later, he no longer had a match among peers. Hence, he challenged the Eternal Chess Game, ‘Ask Not’, making a name for himself in one battle!

In these eight million years, High Priest Redplume followed by Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s side. His alchemy strength had long already reached an unfathomable step.

This young man in front of him wanted to surpass High Priest Redplume?

Simply a joke!

Perhaps his talent was really greater than High Priest Redplume. But even if he were to really surpass High Priest Redplume, that would also be no idea how many years later.

Either way, someone would also believe if I said that I would surpass Sacred Ancestor High Priest ten million years later. Who knew about the matters after ten million years?

Xin Luo and the rest of the Empyreans also had scornful faces, clearly not believing what Ye Yuan said.

“Huhu, yeah, give him eight million years, he might really be able to catch up to High Priest Redplume.”

“Lord Second Sage is really incredible! Just don’t know if he can live for eight million years or not!”

“After eight million years, I can surpass Medicine Ancestor! Either way, bragging won’t need to be sentenced to death too!”

... ...

The group of Empyreans had scorn all over their faces, with their words full of ridicule.

Ye Yuan kept a straight face and answered with a question, “Then have you thought before why Sacred Ancestor High Priest would confer a nobody like me as Second Sage? Does he value my talent highly, or is he really muddle-headed with age?”

“This ...” Gongyang Lie was taken aback. Clearly, he had not considered this question before.

Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s thoughts were not what he could surmise at all.

Hence, he was totally unable to understand this conferment.

Currently, Ye Yuan asking this question, all of the Empyreans ceased the mockery, listening attentively with curiosity.

Clearly, this was also the question that they were most concerned about. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Reaching Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s realm, what is there that he still pursues? That’s naturally the sublime summit of Alchemy Dao! He asked Medicine Ancestor what is Dao, but Medicine Ancestor dodge it with ‘Ask Not’ two words. Hence, he asked the world what was Dao! He searched for tens of millions of years and finally found an opponent! That person is me!”

Ye Yuan’s gaze was scorching, sweeping across all of the Empyreans’ faces as he said in a solemn voice, “The title is ‘Second Sage’ is hoping that I can become an opponent who is able to sit and debate on Dao with him! Do you all understand?”

Inside the hall was dead silent. Everyone was stunned by Ye Yuan’s arrogant to the extreme speech.

They were not convinced by Ye Yuan’s speech but utterly stunned by Ye Yuan’s wild arrogance.

What kind of existence was Sacred Ancestor High Priest?

In the demon race, he was a god!

He created numerous demon race Heavenly Emperors with his power alone!

Presently, the demon race’s top major powers virtually all revered Sacred Ancestor High Priest as supreme.

Even though they all, these disciples, were presently all leading figures of a region, facing Sacred Ancestor High Priest, they still carried out the etiquette of a disciple. No one dared to talk about becoming his opponent.

Now, a True God Realm brat actually said that he was going to become Sacred Ancestor High Priest’s opponent.

This was simply laughable to the extreme!

“I-Ignorant! Arrogance! Sacred Ancestor High Priest is the Heavenspan World’s universally acknowledged number two Alchemy Dao person! For several tens of millions of years, no one had dared to challenge him. You actually said that you’re going to become his opponent?” Gongyang Lie berated.

But Ye Yuan shook his head and said coolly, “What does a swallow know of the aims of a swan! No matter how strong a powerhouse is, they also walked over step by step from a weakling! You all don’t even dare to think about it, so you naturally can’t become a powerhouse like Sacred Ancestor High Priest. The logic of experts is lonesome; you all naturally won’t understand too.”

Ye Yuan was just elaborating on a fact, but this way of saying things was simply ignorant and conceited in the eyes of everyone. In their eyes, he was a mad man.

The group of Empyreans was thoroughly stunned!

Originally, when Ye Yuan said that he wanted to surpass High Priest Redplume, they felt extremely shocked.

Now, Ye Yuan directly brought Sacred Ancestor High Priest out, saying that he wanted to become his opponent.

“Huhu, a bunch of frogs at the bottom of a well, chatting about these with you all, you guys also won’t understand. Gongyang Lie, don’t you want to take me down a notch? Then I’ll give you this opportunity! Today, I’ll have a Dao debate with the Seven-star priests present. As long as there’s someone among you who can defeat me, I’ll leave immediately and never enter the Demon Divine Region for life!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The moment these words came out, Gongyang Lie’s eyes lit up.

He was long dissatisfied with this arrogant to the extreme fellow. Since he was looking for abuse himself, and even said never to enter the Demon Divine Region, this sort of word, then it could not be blamed on others.

Xin Luo’s two eyes narrowed slightly and he said with a cold smile, “Lord Second Sage, this is what you said!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I said it! If even you these people can beat me, then I don’t want this title of Second Sage too!”

Xin Luo laughed in spite of himself and said, “Lord Seven-star really talks wildly! The strength of a Seven-star priest isn’t what you can imagine!”

Ye Yuan said with a faint smile, ” My strength isn’t what you all can imagine too!”

Xin Luo’s two eyes narrowed slightly, turned to an Empyrean, and said, “Since that’s the case, Priest Woodgem, you come and seek guidance from Lord Second Sage then.”

Empyrean Woodgem chuckled and said, “I obey your command! However ... what we’re competing in is demon divine pills. Lord Second Sage mustn’t compete in human divine pills with this Empyrean. This Empyrean can’t refine it.”

The moment these words came out, it immediately incurred a wave of hooting laughter.

Ye Yuan slowly nodded his head and said, “Relax, will be competing in demon divine pills.”

Demon divine pills or divine pills already did not have much difference to the current Ye Yuan.

In the end, all roads lead to Rome.

Regardless of whether demon divine pills or divine pills, they were merely two branches of Alchemy Dao. Just like how the poison path and medical path were the same.

The Priest Temple naturally did not lack a place to refine medicine. Xin Luo ordered people to prepare the place to compete in alchemy very soon.

Ye Yuan two people were currently making preparations when Gongyang Lie asked, “How is Woodgem’s strength? He mustn’t lower the prestige of our Redplume lineage!”

Xin Luo smiled and said, “Your Excellency, rest assured. Younger Brother Woodgem is of the woodspirit physique to begin with. He has extremely high talent in alchemy. Furthermore, his realm already reached peak late-stage Dao Realm. Among these people, he’s also an existence that can rank into the top ten. Wouldn’t dealing with a mere Six-star priest still be easily accomplished?”

Gongyang Lie nodded slightly, immediately setting his mind at ease.

Although he was not a priest, following by High Priest Redplume’s side for so many years, he naturally knew the strength difference between the priests.

Someone who was a peak late-stage Dao Realm powerhouse was already an extremely powerful expert in alchemy.

Judging from Ye Yuan’s age, even if he had heaven-defying talent and reached late-stage Dao Realm, it was also impossible to be Woodgem’s match.

Under the watchful gazes of the people, Ye Yuan two people started the alchemy battle.

Bang!

Empyrean Woodgem was a woodspirit that attained Dao in the first place, his advantage in refining pills was tremendous.

The moment his aura was released, those spirit medicines were as obedient as his children.

His demonic attraction art was already at a high degree of proficiency.

But when everyone’s eyes landed on Ye Yuan, they could not help exclaiming in admiration.

“What sharp and fierce demonic attraction art! How can a human cultivate the demonic attraction art to such a boundary?” Xin Luo marveled in admiration.
