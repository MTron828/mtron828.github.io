Chapter 1893: Li-er’s News

Outside of Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, a figure phased and formed

The young man stood with his hands behind his back, looking at that model-like small city beneath his feet with a scornful face.

Buzz!

The moment the young man released his aura, a horrifying aura instantly enveloped the entire city.

Zuo Shujie and the rest of the powerhouses were currently crowding around Ning Tianping and asking all sorts of questions at this time.

They were very curious about Ye Yuan’s experiences in these several hundred years and naturally wanted to get to the bottom of it.

But right at this time, a horrifying pressure enveloped the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

Zuo Shujie’s expression rapidly changed, his face ashen pale, cold sweat already faintly seeping out on his forehead.

“This ... What kind of pressure is this?” Zuo Shujie’s expression was ugly as he said.

This aura was too horrifying, horrifying until it made people unable to give birth to the thought of resisting.

As for how strong it was, Zuo Shujie completely could not determine it with his realm.

Tong’er[1] who had been playing with Treasure Pig all along noticed something. His gaze revealed a trace of uncertainty at first. He then said coolly, “Judging from this aura, it should be an Empyrean.”

Everyone’s faces quickly changed, looking at Tong’er in disbelief.

“E ... Empyrean? You’re not joking, right?” Zuo Shujie said in disbelief.

He seriously could not imagine why Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would be visited by an Empyrean powerhouse.

“Is Ye Yuan here? Have him come out for this Empyrean!” Right at this time, a void reverberated throughout the entire Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, confirming Tong’er’s words.

Professing as this Empyrean, that was naturally a Heavenly Empyrean!

After the shock, Zuo Shujie brought everyone and went out to welcome him.

That figure in midair appeared very illusory and also very dazzling, Zuo Shujie did not dare to look straight at it at all.

Zuo Shujie knelt down respectfully and said politely and meekly, “Heavenly Eagle City Lord, Zuo Shujie, pays respect to Lord Empyrean!”

Although he did not dare to look straight at him, glimpsing through his peripherals, this Empyrean powerhouse was extremely young. This made Zuo Shujie incredibly shocked in his heart.

He had naturally never seen before an Empyrean powerhouse, but even a fool would know that those able to achieve the position of Empyrean were all old monsters who had lived for millions of years.

This young man in front of him was clearly not!

Just where did such a young Empyrean powerhouse come from?

The young man accepted it calmly and said coolly, “Which one is Ye Yuan?”

Everyone’s faces changed, not expecting that this Empyrean was actually here for Ye Yuan.

For a moment, the atmosphere was terrifyingly quiet.

“Looks like you guys feel that this Empyrean is very easygoing?”

The young man’s palm slowly raised up, the winds and clouds suddenly changed!

The heaven and earth spiritual energy within a radius of 100 thousand miles closed in towards him crazily.

Empyrean-level world power suddenly released, heaven and earth changed colors because of it!

For the first time in their lives, these remote hinterland powerhouses witnessed the terror of Empyrean-class powerhouses.

And the price was death. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If this palm landed, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City would turn to ashes.

Practically mustering up all the strength in his body, Zuo Shujie said, “Lord Empyrean calm your anger, Ye Yuan he ... isn’t in the city!”

The young man’s brows furrowed slightly and he said, “Wherever he is, make him come and see me.”

This request was somewhat forcing people to do what they could not.

But what to do?

Forget about a puny little Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, even the Nine Pledge Imperial Capital was also too weak to stand in competition in front of an Empyrean powerhouse.

Another bout of silence.

The young man seemed to have lost his patience and said coolly, “In that case, you all can go and die!”

Waving his hand, the wind and clouds stirred, spiritual energy surging mightily.

That howling gale blew until Zuo Shujie’s face hurt.

“Stop!”

Right at this time, there was a ripple in the void, a figure emerged.

When everyone saw that figure, their faces all changed drastically.

“Your Excellency, quickly leave!” Ning Tianping howled.

Ye Yuan did not leave, his gaze was currently sizing up that young man who was looking down from a height, confirming that he had not seen him before.

The young man had a handsome face like carved jade, hair falling lightly; very good-looking, like the neighbor’s big brother.

But that evil aura on his body could not be concealed no matter what.

Clearly, he did not have goodwill toward Ye Yuan.

“You’re looking for me?” Ye Yuan said with a frown.

“You know Yue Mengli?” The young man answered with a question.

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled violently. Pupils constricting, he asked with his voice carrying a quiver, “You know Li-er?”

Bang!

He did not see the young man take any action. However, Ye Yuan’s body was akin to being struck by lightning, turning into a sharp sword and falling to the ground.

“Is Li-er what you can call too?” The young man’s gaze was sharp as he said unhappily.

Ye Yuan vomited a mouthful of blood wildly, already sustaining serious injuries.

This place was different from the Immortal Grove World, facing Empyrean powerhouses, he did not have the least bit of strength to fight back at all.

Even if the other party just spat out a bit of world power, he could not block it too.

But the current Ye Yuan was wildly ecstatic in his heart.

These several centuries, there was no news about Li-er.

At present, it being said from this young man’s mouth, at least Li-er was safe.

A figure moving, Ye Yuan appeared in front of the young man once more.

His injuries were dreadful to behold, but he stood stubbornly.

“Who are you? Is Li-er ... well currently?” Ye Yuan ignored his injuries, he just wanted to know how Li-er was no.

The young man’s brows furrowed slightly, world power erupting once more.

Bang!

Ye Yuan was blasted into the ground once more!

The young man said in a cold voice, “I said before, you have no qualifications to call Li-er! If there’s a next time, you’ll be dead for sure!”

Swoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure appeared once more. It was just that the aura on his body was extremely disorderly, full of wounds.

The young man’s brows furrowed slightly. Clearly, he was rather unhappy with Ye Yuan’s stubbornness and tenacity.

He did not hold back with these two blows. If it were ordinary Celestial Deity Realm martial artists, forget about flying in front of him, not dying would already be pretty good.

But Ye Yuan stood in front of him stubbornly.

No one spoke, it was silent between heaven and earth.

Everyone’s eyes looked at Ye Yuan, full of worry.

They knew Ye Yuan’s temper. Ye Yuan’s relationship with Yue Mengli, they were also aware of it.

This Empyrean powerhouse that appeared out of nowhere did not even allow Ye Yuan to call a name, so how could he tolerate it?

Toward Ye Yuan’s fury, the young man did not pay attention at all.

The young man looked at Ye Yuan and said with a calm look, “Just a Celestial Deity Realm ant, so what right do you have to be angry? I’m here to tell you that Junior Apprentice Sister Mengli is no longer someone in the same world as you. Starting from today, forget her! Otherwise, you know the consequences!”

At this time, Ye Yuan moved.

One step, two steps ...

He moved closer to the young man step by step, countless blue fine-lines spread out from Ye Yuan’s body, winding over toward the young man.

Seeing this scene, the young man who had always been calm and collected finally had a visible change in countenance.

His pupils constricted and he cried out in shock, “Dao marks! This ... how is this possible?”

The blue fine-lines became more and more, thicker and thicker, practically enveloped the entire space.

Ye Yuan’s two eyes became colder and colder, not carrying the slightest hint of feeling.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s two eyes, no idea why, a chill welled up from the bottom of the young man’s heart.

To an Empyrean powerhouse, Celestial Deity Realm did not pose the least bit of threat at all.

But at this moment, a feeling called danger spread throughout his whole body.
