Chapter 2744: A United Front!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The faces of all the saint sovereigns were very solemn.

How could they not have thought of these things that Ye Yuan said?

But, apart from waiting to perish, what else could they do?

Putting up a desperate fight would not have a way out of it.

The Pill Alliance was too strong!

“What can we do even if we’re not willing to accept it?” Saint Exalt Waycloud let out a long sigh and said.

“Not willing, you naturally have to revolt! All of you are Rainclear Continent’s top powerhouses. Only by gathering together can you overthrow the Pill Alliance’s rule!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

But Saint Exalt Purplesun shook his head and said, “It’s useless! Even if we gather together, we’re not the Pill Alliance’s match either!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “It’s merely 20 Saint Sovereign Heavens! There are already 12 of you all present! Five Great Heavenly Regions’ Saint Sovereign Heavens would not be less than 15 no matter what, right? Add in Myriad Demons Mountain’s nine great Saint Exalts, you have even more than the Pill Alliance! As for the high-level combat force, leave this to me to resolve!”

“What?! When did the Myriad Demons Mountain have nine great Saint Exalts?” Saint Exalt Purplesun’s entire body trembled and he said in disbelief.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “The Pill Alliance has true grade heavenly pills and can create Saint Exalt powerhouses, can’t I do the same? If there are sufficient heavenly medicines, forget about nine great Saint Exalts, even if it’s 90 Saint Exalts, what does it count for?”

Everyone looked at Ye Yuan and could not help being speechless.

How great a price did they pay in order to break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But, when it reached Ye Yuan’s mouth, it was as simple as eating and drinking!

Really making people unable to live!

But, thinking about it, everyone felt at ease too.

Why did the Pill Alliance have so many Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses?

Wasn’t it because they grasped true grade heavenly pills?

“This Ye doesn’t need everyone to do anything either. After this Ye kills my way back to the Five Great Heavenly Regions, I hope that everyone can lend a helping hand; that will do! The harvest this time isn’t small. I’ll help you all refine some heavenly pills later to help your strength improve further. In the future, after destroying the Pill Alliance, this Ye will re-establish the Pill Pavilion and pass down the true grade Dao teaching, letting everyone no longer be controlled by people! I wonder what everyone thinks?”

These people were all old foxes who would not commit themselves until success is certain. Although he saved them, this concerned their lives; they would not easily agree.

In fact, it was also not impossible that they agree to it here, and then they went to deliver the information to the Pill Alliance after going out.

Wanting to rope them in, the best way was the tying of interests!

Passing down Dao teachings, refining heavenly pills, this absolutely had an allure for them.

In order to suppress them, it was definitely impossible for the Pill Alliance to provide them grade five heavenly pills. This also cut off their hopes of advancement.

Otherwise, why would they be willing to take the unusual risk and enter the Labyrinth Divine Palace?

Others did not know, but how could they all, these old fellows, not have heard of the Labyrinth Divine Palace before?

Back then, Zhuo Bufan that group of supreme powerhouses only had Zhuo Bufan alone coming out alive!

Did they not have any idea how dangerous it was?

It was just that they had no choice but to do so!

Sure enough, the moment Ye Yuan said this, the eyes of the Saint Exalts lit up.

“Brother Ye, is this true?” Saint Exalt Purplesun said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “More real than real gold! In the future, when I re-establish the Pill Pavilion and break through to Saint Sovereign Heaven, helping you all reach grand completion Saint Sovereign Heaven isn’t something hard too! You all know that this isn’t a big deal to me.”

Being limited by resources, it was probably a little tough for Ye Yuan to want to reach the realm of true grade in the Rainclear Continent.

In reality, Ye Yuan guessed that it was impossible for the Pill Alliance’s alliance chief to refine a grade five heavenly pill of true grade too.

After all, grade five heavenly medicines were too rare in the Rainclear Continent!

But Ye Yuan’s foundation was extremely solid. For ordinary grade five heavenly pills, it was a cinch for him to refine until ninth grade.

Saint Exalt Purplesun looked at the group of Saint Exalts and said, “Brothers, how do you all see it? There’s a young man in front of us that can reach Li Changsheng, that level of existence!”

Clearly, he was moved.

Saint Exalt Waycloud was the first to nod his head and said, “Okay, my Seven-star Heavenly Sect joins! But I have a condition. We must see an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “That’s of course, I want to take revenge, not seek death!”

Saint Exalt Skyfortune nodded and said, “Okay, we’re joining too!”

The 12 Saint Exalts all joined without exception.

Got to be joking! Someone who could refine true grade heavenly pills, there was presently only this one apart from the Pill Alliance!

Pass this village and there would be no such shop anymore!

Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses all had to face the Saint Sovereign Dao Tribulation. If their strength stopped improving, they might just kick the bucket any day.

“Younger Brother Ye, can you count me in? I’m also someone who has a Saint Exalt true spirit presently!” Wu Fang suddenly said.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Of course! You gather the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill’s heavenly medicines. I can help you refine it and assist you to step into Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

When Taoist Wu Fang heard that, he could not help being overjoyed.

The heavenly medicines of the Precious Jade Heavenly Sacred Pill were very hard to collect. But he had hopes of stepping into Saint Sovereign Heaven!

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s gaze suddenly turned sharp, and he said to all the Jade Sovereign Heavens, “You all, swear a Heavenly Dao Oath right now! No one is allowed to divulge today’s matter!”

Even if the Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses present had unhappiness in their hearts, they had no choice but to swear the Heavenly Dao Oath too.

Finished doing all these, Ye Yuan brought everyone into the depths of the passageway.

… …

Treasure Depository Pavilion, the front door was already broken.

But the terrifying undulation coming from inside made the expressions of all the Saint Exalts change.

The restrictions in this Treasure Depository Pavilion were activated!

Through the restriction, they could see that there were many treasures inside!

“That’s a grandmist treasure! So many grandmist treasures!”

“Heavenly pills too! So many heavenly pills!”

“That’s … Voidsnap Immortal Condensation! Heavenly Sorrow Profound Spirit! Silver Frost Heavenly Leaf!?Hiss?… so many good treasures!”

“Damn it! This restriction undulation isn’t the slightest bit weaker than that one earlier!”

… …

Able to see but unable to touch; these Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses were nearly going insane.

But Ye Yuan smiled and said, “No worries. I’ll go in and take it!”

Saint Exalt Purplesun’s gaze turned intent and he said, “Brother Ye, you mustn’t joke about this! Even if you’re very familiar with this place, this restriction isn’t what you can barge through!”

The Voidsnap Immortal Condensation was in there!

Back then, the things inside that Yan Jadetrue they all could not get, it was naturally because of the restriction too.

Ye Yuan did not say anything either, taking a step out and stepping into the restrictions.

Many powerhouses present all cried out in alarm.

But they discovered that Ye Yuan was actually completely fine.

Ye Yuan shuttled back and forth in the restriction, advancing little by little, and he actually did not trigger the restriction.

All the powerhouses stared wide-eyed.

“How did this guy do it? This restriction is at least grade six! Could it be that he also knows grade six restrictions?” Saint Exalt Waycloud was speechless.

“Grade six restrictions don’t exist on the Rainclear Continent at all! How in the world did he, an ascender, do it?” Saint Exalt Purplesun also said in surprise.

Concerning Ye Yuan obtaining the Labyrinth Divine Palace’s map somewhere and knowing about the restriction’s switch, this was still explainable.

But, passing through a grade six restriction, this was too fantastical.

One had to know, True Sovereign Heaven powerhouses had never appeared on the Rainclear Continent before, let alone talk about grade six restrictions.
