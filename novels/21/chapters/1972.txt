Chapter 1976: Liu Yi’s Means

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Immobilize!”

A voice suddenly sounded out, Song Yu four people’s figures were actually forcibly immobilized in midair just like that!

Yes, only four people.

Because there was one other person who was still moving.

Liu Yi!

It was only to see a yellow talisman in his hand turn into a myriad of fine threads, dissipating into the wind.

“Heh, one Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman exchanging for three Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits; it really is worth it!” Liu Yi looked at those three Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits greedily, an excited look on his face.

With these three Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits, he would be able to break through to the middle-stage True God Realm within a very short time.

How could this sort of good thing be shared with others?

The pupils of Song Yu and the rest constricted. None of them would have thought that the Liu Yi who was always wretched and low-profile would actually rise in revolt at this time.

And the moment he took action, it was earth-shaking.

They currently only felt that their bodies were bound by countless profound power of laws, unable to break free at all.

“Liu Yi, you ... you actually dared to scheme against your own companions?” Song Yu said in a great rage.

“If you dare to touch the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits, Ye Yuan won’t let you off!” Guo Jingyang similarly said with a look of sullen anger.

In this team, the one that they looked down on the most was Liu Yi.

Along the way, Liu Yi was extremely low-profile, causing his sense of existence extremely low.

But it was such a person who actually remained hidden with tricks up his sleeves.

At this time, the wretched expression on Liu Yi’s face was swept clean. The indescribable sharpness in his gaze made people stunned.

At this moment, they all understood that turns out this fellow was simply playing a pig to eat a tiger!

“Heh heh, I even used the Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman. So do you think I dare to touch the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruit or not? Not only am I going to touch the Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits, but I’m also even going to ... heh heh.”

Talking up to here, Liu Yi’s gaze turned cold, revealing a fierce killing intent.

He was actually going to kill off all witnesses!

The Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman was coincidentally obtained by Liu Yi inside an Empyrean’s ruins. There were a total of five.

This thing was incomparably profound and mysterious. Forget about Third Firmament True Gods, even Fourth Firmament True Gods also had to stop for several breaths of time.

And these several breaths of time was sufficient for him to kill his opponent.

In the past, in order to snatch good stuff, he already used two. This was the third.

And this Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman was his, Liu Yi’s, greatest reliance.

It was also by relying on precisely this Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman that his destiny soared all the way up, breaking through to become an imperial aura, having the qualifications to enter this Ancient God Battlefield.

Playing a pig to eat a tiger had always been his style.

Each time they teamed up to enter mystic realms, he would be like this, often rising in revolt at the critical moment.

Furthermore, as long as he succeeded, he would eradicate all of his teammates. He was incomparably vicious!

The expressions of Song Yu and the rest changed drastically. Song Yu desperately wanted to break free of that power of law constraint, but he could not break free at all.

The space around him seemed to have been solidified, while he was experiencing as if he was being welded into concrete. He was unable to even move a muscle.

Liu Yi put away the three Profound Heaven Single Breath Fruits and said with a laugh, “Heh heh, stop wasting your energy. With your strength, you can’t move at all within a hundred breaths! Now, this old man will send you all on your way.”

“Liu Yi, you dare?! Ye Yuan definitely won’t let you off!” Song Yu roared.

He was genuinely afraid. He did not expect that he would actually succumb here.

Liu Yi chuckled and said, “If Ye Yuan didn’t leave, I really wouldn’t have dared to take action. That kid is too wily. I can’t grasp him at all. But now, I have to thank that black corpse.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In this team, the only one that Liu Yi was apprehensive of was Ye Yuan.

The secrets on Ye Yuan were too many; his means were also far too many.

Walking along the way, Liu Yi had always been observing Ye Yuan.

But the more he observed, the warier he got.

Liu Yi also understood that Ye Yuan was also constantly guarding against him.

Hence, he had always been very low-profile, not daring to overstep in front of Ye Yuan.

Liu Yi’s gaze turned cold, a small and exquisite ax appeared in his hand. It was shockingly an empyrean spirit treasure!

Song Yu few people’s eyeballs were almost popping out. This Liu Yi actually had an empyrean spirit treasure too!

“Heh, are you very surprised? In the past, I obtained an Empyrean’s complete legacy, empyrean spirit treasure, Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman, and cultivation method. It was all derived from that Empyrean. Do you all think that only you’re proud sons of heaven? Laughable!”

Toward Song Yu, these few flowers that grew up in a greenhouse, Liu Yi was full of disdain.

He had today by relying on his own abilities, walking over step by step.

But Song Yu they all?

These young masters who had golden spoons in their mouths while growing up enjoyed the best cultivation resources since young.

Liu Yi suddenly raised the ax and hacked down toward Song Yu.

But right at this moment, a powerful aura drew close from afar, the speed extremely fast.

Liu Yi’s face changed, and he said in a solemn voice, “Consider yourselves lucky!”

Finished talking, his figure moved, diving into the fog, disappearing.

Ye Yuan’s speed was extremely fast, arriving nearby in a blink of an eye.

Seeing everyone’s state as well as the Liu Yi who disappeared, Ye Yuan instantly understood.

“Ye Yuan, Liu Yi he ...” Song Yu said remorsefully and angrily.

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said with a sigh, “I’ve been constantly guarding against Liu Yi, but I didn’t expect that this black corpse was so troublesome, so I was a little late in coming back here.”

Song Yu was struck with terror, only then knowing that Ye Yuan had long noticed Liu Yi.

It was only the few of them that brought along Liu Yi foolishly and even counted money for people after being sold.

“Since you knew, why did you still bring him along?” Song Yu asked puzzledly.

Ye Yuan said, “This Liu Yi, I couldn’t see through him and was afraid that he’ll do something in his desperation. So I’ve never exposed him. But I already warned him when inside the circle. I didn’t expect that he actually really dared to make a move!”

Right at this time, Song Yu felt that the power of laws around him loosen up. He pulled hard, those law threads directly crumbled apart.

“It turned out that this guy obtained before an Empyrean powerhouse’s complete inheritance. He used the Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman and immobilized all of us,” Song Yu gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Ye Yuan was surprised as he said, “I didn’t expect that he actually still had such means. I really underestimated him.”

Ye Yuan daring to leave was only because he originally also felt that Song Yu could contain Liu Yi.

After all, not everyone was like him, able to cross two realms to battle.

But clearly, Ye Yuan underestimated Liu Yi.

With this Chaos Origin Immobilizing Talisman, it would likely be hard for even middle-stage True Gods to escape his murderous scheme.

Song Yu suddenly recalled something and asked Ye Yuan, “Oh, right! What about that black corpse?”

Ye Yuan said, “Driven away by me, it shouldn’t dare to return for the time being.”

Song Yu was taken aback and said, “D-Driven away?”

That was an existence whose fleshy body rivaled peak initial-stage sixth transformation golden body; it was actually driven away by Ye Yuan?

It seemed like Ye Yuan’s means were even more formidable than he imagined!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Because I felt that there was a hint of strange undulation here, so I employed some means. This black corpse is indeed formidable. It’s still beyond my power to want to kill him!”

Kill ...

Song Yu was immediately rendered speechless.

If it were him, he would have long ran until he disappeared, Ye Yuan actually still wanted to kill that black corpse.
