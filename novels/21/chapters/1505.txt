1509 Messenger From the Imperial City

Ye Yuan was slightly surprised, but shook his head and said, “Although I don’t know what the situation of the Medicine Ancestor was back then, my realm is definitely far worse than him. He could attract a portion of laws to descend, but I can’t. But my current realm is still very low, many high-level Alchemy Dao laws are not yet comprehended. One day in the future, if I can step foot into the realm of Heavenly Emperor, I presume it wouldn’t be worse than the Medicine Ancestor.

Ye Yuan had confidence beyond ordinary people in alchemy.

Although the Medicine Ancestor was an existence that the entire Heavenspan World’s alchemists looked up to, he had confidence in being able to catch up head-on too.

These words might be incomparably arrogant if others heard it.

But Dustless had reason to believe that Ye Yuan had this strength and talent!

One had to know, from when Ye Yuan entered the Heavenspan World until now, it was less than a hundred years; time. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Being able to reach his current strength, it was simply inconceivable.

At least, with Dustless’s horizons, apart from the Medicine Ancestor, no one could compare to Ye Yuan.

And the matter of Ye Yuan triggering the Great Dao Heavenly Melody set off a huge storm among the Blood Yama Hall’s Fiend Apothecaries.

“Master Source Night is really too incredible! The things that he talked about simply subverted my understanding of alchemy!”

“Isn’t that so! I feel that my understanding in the past was too superficial. Master Source Night’s understanding of the Alchemy Dao is on a completely different level than us.”

“That’s of course. Otherwise, how would he trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody?”

“I say, will Master Source Night become the second Medicine Ancestor or not?”

“Heh, that’s hard to say. Medicine Ancestor, that level of existence, is simply not what you and I can imagine. Master Source Night is just a Two-star Fiend Apothecary after all. There’s still a very long road to walk. However, if he keeps maintaining momentum, I feel that it shows great promise!”

“Shhh ... mustn’t talk about this matter anymore. Upstairs already issued a gag order. If heard, you won’t even know how you died!”

...

Inside Capone Fiend Medicine Hall, two Fiend Apothecaries who had heard Ye Yuan’s sermon were discussing in whispers.

Except, the Fiend Medicine Hall had already issued a gag order. They also could not resist the astonishment in their hearts, that was why they would discuss softly.

Everyone was all guessing whether or not Master Source Night could reach the Medicine Ancestor’s height.

After all, this was the second Fiend Apothecary who could trigger the Great Dao Heavenly Melody after the Dao Ancestor[1]!

Of course, the Heavenspan World was too big. Perhaps there were still other Fiend Apothecaries who could trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody. But they had never heard before.

To be able to trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody when while being a Two-star Fiend Apothecary, this was absolutely a sensational event.

...

Slap!

Slap!

Slap!

Inside Blackjade Capital City’s Fiend Medicine Hall, Mo Han gave one slap after another, slapping Kong Xiao into a pig’s head.

When he heard this news, his entire person was about to go completely berserk.

He could already imagine it. Blackjade Capital City’s Fiend Medicine Hall’s standard would be surpassed by all the capital cities very soon!

“Great Dao Heavenly Melody! That’s Great Dao Heavenly Melody! Are you a pig? To actually offend a Fiend Apothecary who can trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody?”

“The Two-star Fiend Apothecaries who broke through on the spot were 43 people!”

“Half a month later, the people who broke through were 228 people!”

“Now, there are still over a thousand people in closed-seclusion! More than 1000 people!”

“But what about us? Not one! Not a single one!”

“You pig, it’s fine that you lose face yourself! But you even want to cause this hall master to lose face together with you!”

Mo Han roared at Kong Xiao, flinging one slap after another.

The others watched this scene, all silent like cicadas in winter.

The moment a Fiend Lord was enraged, corpses would litter a thousand miles!

But they understood Mo Han’s anger very much. This matter, if it were them, they would also be as furious as Mo Han.

In reality, they had long already cussed Kong Xiao’s ancestors several tens of thousand times in their hearts.

Such a fine opportunity was actually missed just like this!

Great Dao Heavenly Melody, missing this time, there probably would be no next time anymore.

Mo Han was seriously too angry!

According to the news from the Hundred Knows Hall, all who went to Capone Capital City, basically had one or two breakthroughs in every family.

Those who did not break through, their strength made remarkable strides too.

To be able to listen to Great Dao Heavenly Melody, even if it was a pig, it could also unlock spiritual wisdom and step onto the path of cultivation, let alone people?

But only their household alone did not have a single person present!

The initiator of all this was Kong Xiao.

How could Mo Han not be furious?

Finally, Mo Han’s anger subsided.

“Purplecloud, from today onwards, you’re the Fiend Medicine Hall’s hall master! Kong Xiao will be degraded to a medicine slave from today onwards, and locked in the dungeons to refine pills for 3000 years!”

Finished talking, Mo Han gave a cold snort and disappeared.

Purplecloud was a Three-star Fiend Apothecary too, but his strength was much worse than Kong Xiao’s.

He also did not expect that happiness came so suddenly.

Demoted to be a medicine slave for 3000 years, Kong Xiao basically did not have a day to hold his head up high anymore.

...

Two months’ time had passed in a blink from Ye Yuan’s sermon.

During this period, Ye Yuan had been in closed-seclusion cultivating the whole time.

Triggering Great Dao Heavenly Melody this time, the others had all rode on his coattails. The benefits that he obtained naturally need not be mentioned.

The melody of Great Dao needed time to slowly digest.

Two months later, Capone Capital City welcomed a very distinguished guest.

“I pay respects to Lord Heavenstar!”

Yi Han gave a deep bow to this old man in front of her, her words filled with respect.

“Huhu, oh, Yi Han, this time, you’ve made great contributions this time!” Heavenstar said with a beam.

Heavenstar, was Eminent Orchid Imperial City’s Blood Yama Hall’s Four-star high-rank Fiend Apothecary, a nine-layered heaven Fiend Lord powerhouse. His status was very venerated,

Yi Han smiled and said, “Yi Han doesn’t dare to claim any credit.

Heavenstar smiled and said, “Heh, if there’s merit, there’s merit. Learning the humans’ pretense for what? I really didn’t expect that the tiny little Capone Capital City could actually give birth to a Fiend Apothecary who can trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody! This boy must be controlled by my Blood Yama Hall!”

Yi Han nodded and said, “Lord Heavenstar rest assured. After the ancient ruin, I’ll personally escort him to the imperial city.”

But Heavenstar shook his head and said, “Hey, such a prodigy, how can you detain him over? Got to make him willingly serve our Blood Yama Hall!”

Yi Han’s brows furrowed slightly and said, “This ... is probably very difficult! Lord Heavenstar doesn’t know this. Yi Han used the blood essence contract before barely managing to tie him onto the Blood Yama Hall, this boat. This boy is arrogant at heart and haughty in manner. It’s likely very hard for him to submit wholeheartedly.”

But Heavenstar did not care and said with a broad smile, “How can a genius who can trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody not be arrogant at heart and haughty in manner? Only people who are capable have the right to be arrogant! This seat naturally knows that you can’t subdue him, that’s why I came personally! You bring him over, don’t startle anyone. This matter, the hall master has already issued a gag order. Other factions are absolutely not permitted to know.”

Although the matter of Ye Yuan triggering Great Dao Heavenly Melody was sensational, it was also limited to within the Blood Yama Hall’s boundary.

The sermon was conducted at the Blood Battle Stage. It was too easy for the Blood Yama Hall to seal off the news.

The Blood Yama Hall did not need to block all of the news. They just needed to seal off the news about the Great Dao Heavenly Melody, this incident, and that would do.

Ye Yuan’s alchemy skill being formidable was already not a secret in Capone Capital City long ago.

[1] This sentence is weird. Firstly, I think the author made a mistake and mistyped Medicine Ancestor as Dao Ancestor. Second, this sentence insinuates that the first person who could trigger Great Dao Heavenly Melody was a fiend. I think the author made a mistake.
