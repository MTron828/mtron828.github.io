Chapter 1881: One Fell Swoop

“Such thick medicinal fragrance! If those people saw it, it cannot be without a bout of killing again.”

Looking at the heaps of bottles and containers in front of them, Ye Yuan could not help sighing emotionally.

Under Treasure Pig’s lead, Ye Yuan found this side-hall. Inside had all sorts of medicinal pills displayed.

Barring no accidents, this place should be the place where Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove stored medicinal pills.

When Treasure Pig saw these medicinal pills, its two eyes immediately lit up, turning into a streak of punk light and dashing over, devouring a pile of bottles and containers busily.

The quality of these medicinal pills naturally went without saying. Ye Yuan examined them, they were basically all rank six and above divine pills. There were even quite a number of rank seven divine pills.

Rank seven divine pills were medicinal pills even useful to Empyrean powerhouses.

“Mn? What’s this?”

Ye Yuan saw that on a countertop in a corner, several small bottles were placed, faintly exuding an extremely powerful aura.

Roar!

Opening the small bottle to look, the sound of a dragon roar rose to the sky, practically shattering the entire side-hall.

Ye Yuan hurriedly closed the lid and said in pleasant surprise, “This is Four Symbols true blood! Inside this small bottle, there are likely several dozen drops of Azure Dragon true blood.”

One had to know, one drop of true blood outside caused countless powerhouses to crack their skulls in a bid to vie for it.

If the true blood here was put out, it would definitely arouse endless frenzy. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yuan’s mind stirred, White Light and Ning Tianping both appeared here.

“Your Excellency!”

“Big Brother!”

Ye Yuan handed the White Tiger true blood to White Light and passed the Black Tortoise true blood to Ning Tianping, saying with a smile, “Inside is White Tiger true blood and Black Tortoise true blood. You guys refine it, your strength should be able to increase considerably.”

White Light opened the bottle lid, a violent tiger roar transmitted out. His expression changed and he said, “S-So much?”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “You’re of the White Tiger physique, refining the White Tiger true blood will definitely yield twice the results with half the effort.”

White Light was overjoyed and said, “Thank you, Big Brother! I’ll go into closed-seclusion right away and refine it!”

“Thank you, Your Excellency!” Ning Tianping similarly felt an upsurge of emotion, saying gratefully.

These few years, White Light and Ning Tianping were cultivating inside the Purple Extreme Hall, and also already broke through to Celestial Deity Realm.

It was just that in terms of cultivation realm, they were a lot worse than Ye Yuan.

Done with these, Ye Yuan did not hesitate either, directly swallowing three drops of Azure Dragon true blood, and started refining.

“Senior Wild Blade, you stand guard over me. I’ll refine the Azure Dragon true blood.”

“Yes, Young Master!”

Little Tong’s gaze turned intent and he said, “You swallowed three drops of Azure Dragon true blood in one go, you don’t want to live anymore?”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I’m just scared that it’s not enough!”

The dragon blood entering the body, the berserk energy instantly erupted, Ye Yuan’s imposing momentum skyrocketed.

After two hours, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes, his realm already broke through to Fourth Firmament Divine Vestige.

Little Tong had a shocked expression as he said, “Just what kind of cultivation method are you cultivating? Refining three drops of Azure Dragon true blood only let you barely manage to break through to the First Firmament Celestial Deity Realm! Furthermore, your speed of refining is a little too fast, right?”

Leng Qiuling used several months’ time to refine a drop of Vermilion Bird true blood. But Ye Yuan merely used two hours to refine three drops of Azure Dragon true blood.

This speed was too fast.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Talk about this again in the future. We’d better leave this place first. There are probably quite a few good things inside this Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace. Let’s walk around more.”

“Eurrp!”

Treasure Pig suddenly belched, immediately plopping down in Little Tong’s embrace, falling asleep.

Ye Yuan swept a glance over and also got a big shock. The medicinal pills here were quite a few, this little fellow actually ate all of them without leaving a single one behind.

He was secretly astonished. Just what kind of pet was Treasure Pig, to actually have such a good appetite?

So many medicinal pills, ordinary people would have long burst if they ate them, Treasure Pig’s body shape actually did not even change.

Just what was inside this little fellow’s stomach?

Right at this time, Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean suddenly said, “Young Master, I ... Wild Blade probably can’t accompany you to carry on walking anymore.”

Ye Yuan gave Wild Blade a glance and knew that his time limit was up. Nodding his head, he said, “This whole way, many thanks to Senior Wild Blade for escorting.”

Wild Blade hurriedly said, “What is Young Master saying here? You’re Lord Immortal Grove’s successor, and also Lord Dustless’s master. So you’re naturally my, Wild Blade’s, master too! Without them, there wouldn’t be the present Wild Blade! Young Master, when you return to the Heavenspan World, you must go to the Senro Ghost Realm to find me!”

Senro Ghost Realm was the same as the Demon Divine Region, a region of the Heavenspan World.

It was just that the Senro Ghost Realm was the paradise of Ghost Dao powerhouses.

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Definitely! Senior Wild Blade, take care!”

Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean cupped his fists and said, “Take care, Young Master!”

The moment Wild Blade Ghost Empyrean left, Ye Yuan lost the reliance to resist Empyrean powerhouses.

Hence, he could not meet with those people anymore.

Fortunately, Dustless was very familiar with the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace. Hence, avoiding those people was nothing.

...

“Such thick medicinal fragrance! There must be good stuff here!” An alluring medicinal fragrance wafted over, Zhao Min and the rest were all intoxicated.

Qiao Yuan and the rest went through hardships and finally found this side-hall.

They were different from Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan had Dustless leading the way and was not worried about the dangers of the Immortal Grove Heavenly Palace at all.

But they could only forcefully barge in. Along the way, quite a few people sustained heavy wounds or even died on the way already.

A bunch of people entered in a single file, entering inside the side-hall.

“This ... How can it be like this!” Upon entering, Zhao Min’s face changed.

Inside the side-hall, there were disorderly empty bottles everywhere, scattered in a mess.

Ji Kang gave a cold snort and said angrily, “This place should be Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s pill refining room. The medicinal fragrance is so strong, it indicates that there were still many medicinal pills previously! This must have been done by Ye Yuan, the good things were all given to a pig[1]!”

Those True God powerhouses were all black in the face, in great fits of rage.

One misstep and every step would then be wrong. They could only follow behind Ye Yuan and eat dust now.

But, one had to admit, Ji Kang really said it correctly.

These medicinal pills were really given to a pig.

Except, this pig was not Ye Yuan, but a genuine pig.

“Preposterous! Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove is a famous alchemist, there must have been rank seven divine pills here! This damn brat actually got the whole lot! When I capture him, this old man will definitely tear him to pieces!” Du Hong also said angrily.

“No way! We have to hurry and chase after. Otherwise, we won’t be able to fish any benefits, all benefiting this brat. Tang Yan, quickly lead the way! Mn? Where’s Tang Yan?” Zhao Min said.

“Eh? He was still here just now, where is he gone?”

“Damn! If this boy isn’t around, once we encounter restrictions, we’ll be dead for sure.”

“This punk called Tang Yan is as mysterious as Ye Yuan.”

...

The moment everyone turned around, they discovered that the Tang Yan who was leading the way previously actually already disappeared.

To be able to walk until here safely, Tang Yan could be said to have made tremendous contributions.

Now that Tang Yan suddenly disappeared, everyone could not help panicking in their hearts.

Four great Empyrean powerhouses, each of their faces were very ugly too.

At this time, a figure was traveling at great speed inside the palace, spurring on powerful restrictions from time to time.

However, those restrictions actually did not have any use when they landed on that figure!

If Ye Yuan was here, he would be able to recognize that this figure was none other than precisely Tang Yan!

[1] It’s a saying, they don’t know that it was really eaten by a pig.
