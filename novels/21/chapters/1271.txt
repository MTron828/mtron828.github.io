Chapter 1275: Kanuo’s Trump Card!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Between heaven and earth, there was a dead silence.

There was only a trace of cool breeze reverberating between heaven and earth.

The human martial artists felt like there was something stuck in their chest and had to get it out of their chest.

This scene deeply astounded them.

Slaughtering billions of powerhouses in one move, such means was simply inconceivable!

“My eyesight must be failing! It must be going blurry! This isn’t real!”

“T-Too strong! Deity Realm! This must be the Deity Realm! The Heaven Surmounting Divine King, he ... must have broken through to the Deity Realm!”

“No wonder everyone says that all are ants under the Deity Realm. Deity Realm ... is truly too strong!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

...

Such a spectacle was seriously too impactful.

Even the Fiendgod Jia Lan and four great fiendgods who had once considered themselves without equal in the world, all turned to dust under Ye Yuan’s attack.

This was already another kind of realm, a realm that they were unable to imagine!

Such might, even his own people shuddered.

“Is ... Is this Deity Realm?”

Looking at that slightly thin and weak figure above in the sky, Teng Yun muttered to himself.

The powerful strength that Ye Yuan displayed struck his heart directly, making his heart quiver with excitement.

The thirst towards Deity Realm, they all, these powerhouses who stood at the pinnacle of the Divine Realm, yearned for it the most.

But, even if they stood at the summit, they could not touch that layer of membrane either.

Ye Yuan’s breakthrough gave them hope.

“Don’t think anymore, Ye Yuan’s success cannot be replicated!”

Fang Tian heaved a sigh, shattering Teng Yun’s dream to pieces.

He turned around to look at Fang Tian and said unwillingly, “W-Why?”

Fang Tian sighed again and said, “If my conjectures are right, Ye Yuan has already obtained Heavenly Dao’s recognition and became a true deity that towers above all life! The strength that he displayed earlier was far greater than a true initial-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm! His attacks carry the might of Heavenly Dao, that’s why it’s so powerful!”

“M-Might of Heavenly Dao?”

Teng Yun felt like his brain was somewhat short-circuiting. Fang Tian’s words made him somewhat unable to comprehend.

What was Heavenly Dao?

That was the thing that all the martial artists had to comprehend!

Vague and intangible, the most mysterious of the mysterious!

Heavenly Dao towered above all life. How could it possibly be used by others?

Fang Tian’s astonishment was no less than Teng Yun’s

It was just that his understanding of the Heavenly Dao was far deeper than Teng Yun. So the things that he saw were far more than them.

“Heavenly Dao being absent, no matter how brilliant one was, it’s also impossible to break the shackles! Ye Yuan blazed another path and created the Dao Defying Pill, and refined it successfully, completing Heavenly Dao within his body. The heaven and earth phenomenon a few days ago was probably a process of Heavenly Dao’s recognition towards him!” Fang Tian said in a solemn voice.

Teng Yun was utterly in disorder and said in disbelief, “But ... But why?”

The current Teng Yun seemed to only have this one phrase ‘why.’

Because he really had too many unsolved questions.

Fang Tian smiled bitterly and said, “What I can understand is also just this much! This Divine Realm doesn’t seem to be as simple as we understand. But I suspect that beyond the Divine Realm, there might be a higher-order world!”

Teng Yun’s entire body trembled, his face full of disbelief.

This news was simply too astonishing.

...

Ye Yuan stands proudly in the air, akin to a divinity!

That feeling of beholding a great mountain was established on strength.

Kanuo’s eyes were filled with a look of fear.

Using overwhelmed by terror to describe was not over the top in the least bit!

He used a tone like he had seen a ghost and said to Ye Yuan, “You ... You actually obtained Heavenly Dao’s recognition, and became the new master! This ... This is impossible!”

Kanuo’s understanding was far from what the Divine Realm’s martial artists could compare to.

The moment he saw this move of Ye Yuan’s, Kanuo realized the severity of the problem.

Ye Yuan’s palm was absolutely not just the strength of just entering the Deity Realm.

That majesty of Heavenly Dao could not be concealed at all!

“Didn’t you see it? Kanuo, you’ve plagued the Immortal Grove Region for a million years. Now, it’s time to end it!” Ye Yuan said coolly.

“Impossible! Impossible! You didn’t obtain Immortal Grove that old thing’s Dao Fruit, how can you possibly become the new master?” Kanuo’s words were full of incredulity.

Hearing that, Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed, and he said, “Dao Fruit?”

Ye Yuan realized that this might be the real objective of Kanuo entering the Divine Realm!

Kanuo realized that his tongue slipped, and he said unresignedly, “This deity is a heavenly fiendgod! Even if you stepped into Deity Realm, what does it count for? True Fiend Descending Upon the Earth!”

Kanuo was clearly unwilling to fail. His face fell, and monstrous fiendish energy slowly rose once more.

This time, the Fiendsource Bead suspended on above his head, amplifying his fiendish energy to the limits!

A violent black gas gradually condensed and formed in the air!

An enormous true fiend dharma appeared in everyone’s line of sight!

Originally, that true fiend dharma idol was merely half a body.

But this time, it was a complete human form.

Furthermore, this true fiend dharma idol was goodness knows how many times more corporeal than before!

This true fiend dharma body was far from as large as before. But, that horrifying pressure that exuded struck everyone’s hearts with great terror.

“Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, you’re really very good! But it also ends here! True fiend dharma body, even though the power cannot rival one-millionth of a true fiend’s strength, it’s also absolutely not what the current you can resist!” Kanuo said with a wild laugh.

That black figure opened its eyes, staring at Ye Yuan coldly, a chilling intent penetrating to the bones.

“Is that so?” The corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth revealed a disdainful look of ridicule.

Kanuo’s expression turned cold, and he cried out, “Kill!”

Whoosh!

The true fiend dharma body suddenly disappeared. A terrifying apocalyptic power instantly wrapped Ye Yuan up.

The true fiend dharma body reached its hands out nimbly, a palm already pressing onto the top of Ye Yuan’s head.

The human race martial artists all cried out. Even they also felt the power of this blow.

But Ye Yuan did not have the slightest intention of budging an inch.

He just stood there and did nothing.

Boom!

An even more terrifying undulation that before spread out!

The true fiend dharma body was actually sent flying out backward by a recoil force.

In midair, the true fiend dharma body seemed to have suffered a tremendous impact, its entire body trembling incessantly.

Finally, with a loud bang, it thoroughly dissipated into nothing.

Golden light radiated on Ye Yuan’s body, looking incomparably sacred.

Kanuo’s expression changed, and he exclaimed, “Nine Transformations Golden Body! Black Tortoise Treasure Body Divine Art!”

Even the Origin Deity Realm Zuo Zong could not breach Skydistant’s defense. The Half-Deity Realm Kanuo was far too lacking!

After breaking through to Deity Realm, Ye Yuan’s strength increase was all-round.

Regardless of whether it was offense or defense, it was all unassailable!

Ye Yuan gave Kanuo a glance and said coolly, “Now, your fiend race can utterly disappear in the Immortal Grove Region!”

Ye Yuan slowly raised his hand. The wind and clouds of the world suddenly changed!

A terrifying energy undulation swept across the entire world.

A hint of viciousness flashed across in Kanuo’s gaze, and he suddenly burst into crazed laughter.

The void trembled and actually tore apart a large gouge.

A figure crucified on a cross appeared in front of Kanuo!

“Hahaha ... Ye Yuan, even if you broke through to Deity Realm, you’re still not this deity’s match! If you have the capabilities, come and kill me!” Kanuo laughed wildly unceasingly as if he was crazy.
