Chapter 1740 Time Lag

Not far away, there was a plant, as tall as half a normal person’s height.On the plant, seven to eight blueish-white fruits were growing on it. They were shockingly the Silverwing Earthspirit Fruits.

Duan Peng few people went up and collected all of these Silverwing Earthspirit Fruits into their bags, without any obstruction.

Following that, they walked toward the depths of the cave and indeed discovered a large area of Green Vine Emerald Net Flowers.

Duan Peng said with vicissitudes of emotion: “Brother Ye is truly a rare talent, knowing the habits of these spirit medicines like the palm of his hands!”

Yu Jing said, “He can even resolve the poison of the Firecloud Ice Edge Bug,so what does this bit count for?”

Duan Peng nodded his head and said, “Everybody, get ready! Be careful of the Darknight Poison Bats’ sneak attack!”

The few people nodded in response, preparing the powder that Ye Yuan gave.

At this point, they were already thoroughly convinced in Ye Yuan’s strength.

Ye Yuan said that this powder was useful, then it was definitely useful.

Otherwise, these Darknight Poison Bats’ danger level was not the slightest bit inferior to the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s. How could they dare to move?

The few people made preparations and started gathering the Green Vine Emerald Net Flowers.

Right at this time, a series of wing-flapping sounds came from within the cave.

Only to see a densely packed large swarm of bats pouncing over towards the four people viciously.

These bats were all the size of a human head, fierce-looking, looking incomparably ferocious.

“Withdraw!”

Duan Peng suddenly gave a loud roar, directly scattering the powder Ye Yuan made into the air. Tthe others also did the same.

“Squeak, squeak!”

The originally aggressive and fierce Darknight Poison Bats suddenly gave off shrill screams.

Those bats stained by the powder struggled for a moment and turned into a pool of blood very quickly.

The other Darknight Poison Bats were also akin to facing a great enemy, circling around in the sky, not daring to approach.

When the few people saw this scene, they could not help being dumbfounded with shock.

“This powder is so powerful, rank four fierce beasts were exterminated in a blink of an eye!”

“This thing is simply like corpse-melting powder, but the power is God knows how many times greater!”

Duan Peng was secretly alarmed and said in a solemn voice, “Move faster!”

The few people did not dare to delay, putting away these Green Vine Emerald Net Flowers hurriedly.

Those Darknight Poison Bats watched the few people’s actions helplessly but did not dare to move forward.

The powder suffused in the air was a deadly threat to them.

Duan Peng and the rest gathered all of these Green Vine Emerald Net Flowers and also retreated hurriedly.

When the few people exited the cave, a peerlessly powerful aura suddenly arrived from the distance with a howl.

Duan Peng’s expression changed greatly and he cried out in shock, “Not good, it’s the Purple-eyed Devil Ape! Could ...”

Yu Jing’s tears flowed down, shaking her head in an unwillingness to believe as she said, “No! Brother Ye he won’t die!”

Duan Peng said in a solemn voice, “Now’s not the time to be saying this, being caught up by the Purple-eyed Devil Ape, we’d be dead for sure! Quickly run!”

How could the few people dare to stay? All of them mustered their speed to the limits, wanting to shake off the Purple-eyed Devil Ape.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s roars arrived close from afar, its speed swift to the extreme.

Duan Peng turned his head to look, his heart immediately turning cold.

That Purple-eyed Devil Ape was extremely berserk right now, with its two enormous eyes emitting a purple light that stirred people’s souls. This was the hallmark of the Purple-eyed Devil Ape being berserk to the limit.

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape under this state, its strength was the most terrifying!

One had to know, even Ye Yuan could not shake off the Purple-eyed Devil Ape, let alone these people.

Among the four people, Yu Jing’s strength was the weakest, her speed also the slowest.

In a whistle, the Purple-eyed Devil Ape already caught up.

Suddenly, Yu Jing stopped, looked at the Purple-eyed Devil Ape with a decisive look, and said, “You animal, to actually kill Brother Ye, I’ll fight it out with you!”

Finished talking, she used all of her strength and rushed over towards the Purple-eyed Devil Ape with a sword.

Yu Jing knew that this was a suicide attack, but she already did not want to run anymore.

When Duan Peng and the rest saw this scene, they could not help turning pale with fright.

But he already revealed a decisive look, gritted his teeth, and said, “F*cking hell, your father will fight it out with you too! Everybody attack together, avenge Brother Ye!”

Done talking, he suddenly erupted, and actually arrived first despite launching later, charging over towards the Purple-eyed Devil Ape.

However, the devil ape until the purple-eye state, its imposing momentum was truly incomparably dreadful.

Before arriving near it, the four people already felt tremendous pressure, as if their movements also became sluggish.

“Roar!”

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s iron arm swept, a terrifying palm-wind swept over!

The palm-wind had yet to arrive and it already blew until the four people were reeling from right to left.

It was not a fight on the same level at all! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s slap was too fast, arriving in front of the four people in a flash.

This palm landing, the four would absolutely die!

At the critical moment, a figure suddenly charged out of the void, shooting straight for the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s eyes!

This was too sudden, even the Purple-eyed Devil Ape did not react as well.

But the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s reaction speed could be rated as fast, the other iron arm immediately smacking its palm over toward that figure.

“Puchi!”

“Roar!”

Duan Peng four people were smacked flying; Ye Yuan who rushed out of the void was similarly smacked flying.

However, the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s eyes were injured by Ye Yuan’s swift and fierce sword energy, being in pain until it kept howling.

“Hide further away!”

Ye Yuan spewed out a large mouthful of blood as he shouted fiercely.

Seeing that Ye Yuan was not dead, the four people could not help being overjoyed.

Hearing Ye Yuan’s roar, they also abruptly startled awake and dodged far away.

Ye Yuan forcefully suppressed his shocked internal organs once more and put away the Junyi Sword.

Taking the chance when the Purple-eyed Devil Ape was crying out in pain, the Tai Chi Diagram in his hand suddenly appeared!

Far away, when Duan Peng and the rest saw this scene, each and every one of them was shocked until they could not close their mouths.

“This ... This is the legendary Great Dao pill refinement! My god!” Duan Peng said in shock.

Only to see a medicinal pill gradually condense and form in the center of the Tai Chi Diagram.

Previously, the Purple-eyed Devil Ape was chasing Ye Yuan, looking as if it was about to catch up. But the Purple-eyed Devil Ape suddenly turned around and went back in the direction of the cave.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he could not help turning pale with fright, knowing that this guy’s intellect was rather high, and already realized that this was a scheme to lure the tiger out of the mountains.

Ye Yuan secretly thought to himself that this was not good. At the rate of this speed, the few of them would probably find it very hard to escape.

He knew that this battle was likely unavoidable already.

Originally thought that luring the enemy away from its base could work, who knew that this Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s intellect far exceeded his imagination.

But with his current strength, he was not the Purple-eyed Devil Ape’s match at all.

In his haste, Ye Yuan’s figure shuttled, entering the World Suppressing Stele, and let Ning Tianping urge the Purple Extreme Hall to fly speedily in the direction of the cave.

Inside the World Suppressing Stele’s space, Ye Yuan used the Netherworld Dark Fragrance Flower that was just obtained and started to carry out a pill refinement.

Originally, Ning Tianping had been urging the Purple Extreme Hall all along, quietly following Yu Jing and the rest, only waiting for Ye Yuan’s refinement to succeed.

Who knew that at this time, Yu Jing actually turned around and clashed head-on with the Purple-eyed Devil Ape.

Helpless, Ye Yuan could only give up on the pill refinement and made a move to sneak attack the Purple-eyed Devil Ape in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint.

However, the medicinal pill was refined halfway. If it could not refine successfully, it was still death.

This bit of injury was not fatal to the Purple-eyed Devil Ape!

Hence, Ye Yuan directly refined the medicinal embryo inside the Profound Yellow Cauldron and immediately refined the pill with Great Dao!

Because of the time lag, Ye Yuan’s medicinal pill already reached the final juncture.

In this short while, Ye Yuan shouted ‘condense’ fiercely, the medicinal pill was finally refined successfully!
