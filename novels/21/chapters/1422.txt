1426 Divine Envoy Azurepeak

Passing through a water screen, Ye Yuan felt his divine soul quiver a bit.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed slightly. But this feeling of discomfort vanished very quickly.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan discovered that there was a blurry shadow ahead, gradually becoming clearer.

Then, that silhouette walked over towards him like two sides of a mirror.

This figure was exactly the same as Ye Yuan!

This Death Cultivation Space did not have any special aspects.

It was just that Ye Yuan’s opponent was himself!

Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove’s means were exceedingly formidable. This Death Cultivation Space was very magical and could perfectly replicate Ye Yuan’s strength, creating a clone that was indistinguishable from the real or illusion.

And what Ye Yuan had to do was not to kill the other party, but break through his own limits under the other party’s hellish training!

“Ye Yuan, think properly! Once this Death Cultivation Space activates, either you die, or he perishes! Even I’m unable to make it stop either!” Dustless’s voice sounded out by Ye Yuan’s ear.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “This is already the tenth time that you said it to me! Let’s go!”

Dustless scolded laughingly and said, “You, brat, are really a monomaniac!”

Finished talking, Dustless’s voice was no longer heard.

Then, an icy-cold voice sounded out in the space.

“Death cultivation, activates now!”

The Ye Yuan opposite released an evil smile, making Ye Yuan’s heart turn slightly cold.

“You’re very strong! To actually give me such a powerful body!” said the other Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed. He did not expect that this guy opposite actually had his own consciousness!

The other Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Looking at your expression, you’re very surprised, right? I’m not a machine that only knows slaughter. I have an independent personality. I will think ... about how to kill you!”

After the shock, Ye Yuan’s state of mind also calmed down and he said with a smile, “Couldn’t ask for me! Bring it!”

The other Ye Yuan smiled sinisterly, his figure suddenly disappearing.

Clank!

Ye Yuan waved his hand to execute Sundering Stars. Two terrifying attacks collided together, shocking Ye Yuan’s figure back repeatedly.

Sundering Stars!

What the other Ye Yuan used was also Sundering Stars!

Furthermore, the other party’s strength, as well as the application of Sundering Stars, was not the slightest bit inferior to his!

Even the sword in the other party’s hands also perfectly replicated the Evil Extermination Sword.

No wonder it was called Death Cultivation Space. Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of secret to speak of in front of the other party.

Such an opponent was too terrifying.

“Heh, the power of this Sundering Stars is still pretty good, right? Relax, there are even more surprises waiting for you!” said the other Ye Yuan with an evil smile.

“Didn’t think that the other me is actually talkative!” Ye Yuan shook his head and said with a sigh.

“Huhu, that’s just you not understanding yourself. I’m ... actually just another you.”

“Alright, alright, you win! Can you give me more surprises?” Ye Yuan said.

“As you wish!”

Whoosh!

The two figures moved, clashing together violently.

The two people’s battle did not have the slightest skill to speak of.

They both understood the other party too well!

Any tricks had no place to show its prowess.

The more Ye Yuan fought, the more alarmed he got. Not only did the other party perfectly replicate himself in strength, it even perfectly copied in terms of fighting will and combat talent too!

The other party’s keen insight made all of his schemes fall through in the end.

This was a truly powerful opponent!

In front of the other party, Ye Yuan did not have a shred of advantage to speak of.

Two surges of terrifying power bombarded everywhere in this space, shocking the entire space until it trembled endlessly.

“Sigh ... This kid is bound to encounter many formidable enemies on his rise up. But probably any formidable adversary can’t compare to as strong as this time! Immortal Grove that old geezer is really a genius, to actually be able to come up with this kind of perverted method to hone people. However, if Ye Yuan is really able to defeat himself, it’s absolutely a great benefit to him!” Dustless said with an emotional sigh.

...

Just as Ye Yuan entered death cultivation, the entire Sky Foothill World was lit on fire by a rumor.

“What? The White Night Sacred Palace’s grand elder is actually an outsider world’s intruder!”

“Like I said, when did the Sky Foothill World produce such an impressive genius, Grotto Profound Realm actually capable of slaying Heaven Glimpse Realm!”

“White Night Sacred Palace actually let an intruder become the grand elder! This is simply a massive joke!”

...

Under the Life End Sacred Palace’s deliberate spreading, this rumor spread throughout the various major sacred palaces like the wind.

Currently, Bai Chen and Mo Yun duo were like ants on a hot pan, pacing about anxiously.

Yet, Ye Yuan was in closed-seclusion at this time too. This made the two of them lose the main pillar.

However, Mo Yun was much more experienced in the end. Seeing Bai Chen’s utterly stupefied appearance, he opened his mouth and said, “Palace Lord, the more it’s like this, the calmer we have to be! Your appearance, it will be seen through the moment others see it!”

After Mo Yun consumed the medicinal pill that Ye Yuan gave, he already successfully broke through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm.

Currently, he already became White Night Sacred Palace’s ninth elder rightfully.

Bai Chen sighed and said, “Of course I know. It’s also only in front of Teacher Mo Yun that I’ll be like this.”

Mo Yun nodded his head. He knew that Bai Chen was indeed much more mature now.

“This matter is a huge deal. Even in front of me, Palace Lord mustn’t be like this too,” Mo Yun said.

Bai Chen nodded his head and said with a resentful look, “This matter, only you and I know. Just who leaked it out? Unless, apart from you and me, there is still someone else who knows about Master Ye Yuan’s true identity?”

Mo Yun frowned and said, “That’s hard to say! But, to be able to spread this rumor to such a degree, the other party’s force probably can’t be underestimated!”

Bai Chen said gloomily, “Sigh! I’m not worried about the rumor, what I’m worried about is ... the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s attitude! The Sky Foothill Divine Palace monitors the world. This matter is probably hard to escape their eyes and ears!”

Right at this time, the voice of a guard came from outside, appearing rather flustered.

“Palace Lord, the Sky Foothill Divine Palace’s divine envoy has arrived. The deputy palace lord requests Palace Lord and Elder Mo Yun to go and welcome the envoy together!”

The two people’s expressions changed. It was really whatever one feared, whatever came.

They did not expect that the Sky Foothill Divine Palace was so sensitive toward intruders, actually arriving so quickly!

Mo Yun drew a deep breath and said to Bai Chen, “No matter what, we mustn’t reveal any flaws! We can take it as we don’t know, but we mustn’t let the divine envoy see through any further. Otherwise, the White Night Sacred Palace will be eternally doomed!”

Bai Chen’s expression turned stern and he nodded his head solemnly.

Outside the White Night Sacred Palace, an azure-robed middle-aged man stood in the air.

The middle-aged man’s expression was frosty, his bearing extraordinary. One look, and it was an expert.

Bai Chen swarmed out with Bai Xiu and the others, a large group of Deity Realm powerhouses, and bowed down toward that middle-aged man.

“White Night Sacred Palace’s palace lord, Bai Chen, leads everyone to respectfully receive Lord Divine Envoy!”

The middle-aged man lightly gave an ‘mmm,’ and slowly said, “This envoy is Azurepeak. Under the orders of the divine palace, I specially came to investigate White Night Sacred Palace’s grand elder, Ye Yuan. Now ... let him come and see me!”
