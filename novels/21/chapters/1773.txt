1777 Big Brother Is Here to Pick You Up

The gray-robed man revealed a look of shock. He was seriously unable to imagine how a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord escaped the fate of being possessed.

Furthermore, looking at this appearance, this evil spirit was actually even being used by Ye Yuan currently!

“L-Little Brother, actually ... actually, this was all a misunderstanding!” the gray-robed man said with an ugly expression.

He never would have thought that the scheme he designed meticulously actually buried him alive currently.

Not only was this kid not possessed, he actually even used this evil spirit to deal with him instead.

One should not look at how he was currently a half-step Celestial Deity. Because in front of a rank five evil spirit, it was still not enough to look at.

That was an existence that could rival Celestial Deity Realm!

“Misunderstanding? Those fierce beasts outside were all controlled by you, right? Driving us in was in order to have this rank five evil spirit seize possession. Don’t tell me that this wasn’t your doing!” Ye Yuan said coldly.

The gray-robed man’s expression was incomparably ugly. He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually even guessed this.

“Little Brother, you guys should be both from the Heavenspan World, right? Bamboo Groove Void Realm doesn’t allow the appearance of the Heavenspan World’s humans. We’re all the Spirit Controlling Sect’s disciples, having a trial in this sundered boundary. In order to seize the Yin Spirit Stone and Nine Yin Soul Devouring Grass inside this cave, that’s why we made this decision. Our Spirit Controlling Sect’s status inside the Bamboo Groove Void Realm is very high. As long as Little Brother you let us off, our Spirit Controlling Sect will definitely keep you safe!” The gray-robed man’s eyes swiveled as he blurted out more information.

He was certain that Ye Yuan was a genius who was inexperienced in the affairs of the world. This time, he likely came out to train, that was why he strayed into the sundered boundary.

This kind of people, intimidating with threats and beguiling with benefits a little, it was very easy to fall for it.

Either way, Ye Yuan was completely clueless about the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s affairs.

Sure enough, when Ye Yuan heard the gray-robed man’s words, his expression changed slightly and he said, “Want me to let you all off, also can. But you have to promise me a condition!”

The moment the gray-robed man heard, he could not help being wildly elated in his heart, secretly thinking that this punk was indeed easy to hoodwink!

He hurriedly said, “Whatever condition Little Brother has, feel free to speak up. Just take it as we offended Little Brother and making an apology to you.”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Your mount is pretty good, I want it!”

The gray-robed man’s expression changed, his face revealing a look of reluctance.

When Ye Yuan saw his expression, he immediately turned cold and said, “Why? Can’t bear to part with it?”

The gray-robed man had an awkward look. This white tiger’s bloodline was extremely pure. There was a lot of room for future development, not like his other mounts.

For this, he expended considerable effort.

The gray-robed man thought, this kid knows good stuff, to actually want my white tiger the moment he opened his mouth! Forget it, hold him steady first before talking. As long as I trick him back to the sect, wouldn’t this white tiger still be mine?

“H-Haha, not hiding from little brother, but I really can’t quite bear to part with it. But just now, it was indeed our fault. Then I’ll bear the pain and give it to Little Brother!”

The gray-robed man had a reluctant look as well, lightly patting the white tiger. The white tiger came to Ye Yuan’s side very obediently.

Seeing this scene, Ye Yuan’s heart was full of monstrous killing intent.

It was just that he did not reveal a single trace of it.

That was right, this white tiger was none other than precisely White Light!

The reason why he did not take action for so long was also precisely because of White Light.

Ye Yuan recognized him the moment he laid eyes on him.

But very clearly, White Light did not recognize him.

Or should he say, he was unable to recognize Ye Yuan at all!

Ye Yuan did not understand this Spirit Controlling Sect’s methods and did not dare to easily show it.

The current White Light was like a docile kitten. If the gray-robed man made him go east, he absolutely would not head west.

Without a doubt, he was controlled by this Spirit Controlling Sect’s disciple with some kind of method.

At the thought that his brother was actually at the mercy of others like so, the killing intent in Ye Yuan’s heart was practically about to burst his body.

Ye Yuan did not have the slightest clue about the Bamboo Groove Void Realm. If this Spirit Controlling Sect’s method had some unique aspects, a moment of impulsiveness would harm White Light instead.

Although Ye Yuan was confident, it was not to the point of arrogance yet.

He did not have confidence that he could get rid of this beast controlling method.

Ye Yuan lightly stroked White Light’s fur, revealing a very pleased expression.

“Mn, indeed pretty good! What you should do, don’t need me to teach you, right?” Ye Yuan frowned and said.

The gray-robed man chuckled and said, “Little Brother don’t blame, this beast is a transformed demonic beast and doesn’t listen to taming. That’s why I used the Dark Soul Pearl to suppress his beast soul. Originally, I planned on bringing him to the Spirit Controlling Sect to tame him properly and make him form a spirit beast contract with me. Since Little Brother likes him, then I’ll give the Dark Soul Pearl together to Little Brother.”

The gray-robed man had a smile on his face, as if very sincere.

When doing a favor, go all the way. Either way, this Dark Soul Pearl would still return to his hands in the end.

When Ye Yuan heard, he could not help saying with great interest, “Oh? Your Spirit Controlling Sect is indeed a little interesting. This kind of means isn’t commonly seen in the Heavenspan World. I wonder how you plan on taming him?”

The gray-robed man chortled loudly and said, “These demonic beasts are all inherently lowly beings! Want to tame him, one naturally has to teach him a good lesson, then continuously suppress his beast soul with my Spirit Controlling Sect’s secret art. Even if he’s the reincarnation of Buddha’s warrior attendant, he’ll also have no choice but to submit in the end.”

The moment Ye Yuan heard, flames of fury flared up in his heart all at once.

He virtually used all of his strength before controlling his anger.

“Oh? So that’s how it is. Then what’s that Dark Soul Pearl? How to use it?”

Ye Yuan was like a curious baby at this time, continuously inquiring about the Spirit Controlling Sect’s methods.

The gray-robed man was patient, silently chanting the spell. A surge of boundless soul force gushed out, entering straight into White Light’s sea of consciousness.

Then, Ye Yuan saw a dark-black pearl slowly fly out.

And right at this time, White Light’s eyes finally turned from turbid to clear.

When he saw Ye Yuan, his entire body could not help trembling, tears bursting out.

“B-Big Brother!”

Ye Yuan’s face finally revealed a radiant smile. Lighting stroking that soft fur of White Light, he revealed a trace of a tender smile and said, “Alright, everything is over, Big Brother is here to pick you up!”

When the Spirit Controlling Sect’s people saw this scene, their countenance could not help changing.

Especially the gray-robed man, his expression became extremely ugly.

“Punk, turns out that you guys know each other! You ... You tricked me?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At this point, how did the gray-robed man still not know what Ye Yuan’s goal was?

It was just that he never dreamed that Ye Yuan actually knew this white tiger!

Now only did he know that this kid was clearly aiming for the white tiger!

He thought that he deceived Ye Yuan, but he did not know that he had been led by the nose by Ye Yuan all along.

He regretted in his heart!

It turned out that he had a trump card in his hands, but he gave it to the other party for free!

“Big Brother, I ... I ...”

Along the way, White Light had suffered no idea how much hardship. Being overcome by sorrow at this time, he could not control anymore and dug into Ye Yuan’s embrace like a child, bursting into tears.

Ye Yuan hugged White Light’s head and said, “Big Brother knows that you suffered a lot of hardships. You rest assured, Big Brother will help you square the accounts one by one! Now, start squaring it from here!”
