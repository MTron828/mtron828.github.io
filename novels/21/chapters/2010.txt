Chapter 2014: Cloudpill Summit

The moment these words came out, everyone was extremely surprised.

What business did the exalted Empyrean Flutterfeather, a late-stage Empyrean great expert and a peak Seven-star Alchemy God, have to request a measly little True God Realm?

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Senior Flutterfeather, please say it.”

Empyrean Flutterfeather opened his mouth and said, “Three years later, the Southern Border’s seven great peak Empyrean level alchemy holy lands will jointly organize an alchemy summit. At that time, there will be countless alchemy geniuses that gather in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital. I wonder if you’re interested?”

Ye Yuan still had not expressed anything yet, but then Cang Yuan said in surprise, “Cloudpill Summit! You ... You’re here to invite Ye Yuan to take part in the Cloudpill Summit?”

The Heavenspan World was centered around the Heavenspan Mountain, dividing into east, south, west, north, and central, five borders.

The place where Heavenly Eagle was at was the Southern Border.

The Southern Border’s territory was extremely vast, but those able to proclaim to be top alchemy holy lands were not many.

The Southern Border had a total of seven alchemy great imperial capitals that had long enjoyed a good reputation and were known as peak alchemy holy lands.

And among them, it was Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital’s reputation that was at the height of power and splendor.

The alchemy summit initiated by Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital happened once every 5000 years. It was a cardinal matter of the Southern Border’s alchemy world.

Its name was the Cloudpill Summit!

Alchemists able to take part in the Cloudpill Summit were all alchemy geniuses.

What shocked Cang Yuan was, what kind of identity did Empyrean Flutterfeather have? To actually personally come to invite Ye Yuan to participate in the Cloudpill Summit?

One had to know, Lustrous Gold Great Imperial Capital was one of the seven great peak alchemy holy lands.

As an alchemy holy land’s master, how venerated was Empyrean Flutterfeather’s status?

But now, he actually personally ran to Heavenly Eagle in order to invite a puny little True God Realm. How could this not surprise him?

Who knew that Empyrean Flutterfeather shook his head slightly and said, “It’s going to participate in the Cloudpill Summit, but it’s not like what you think. With Ye Yuan’s strength, him going to take part in the Cloudpill Summit, that would be bullying people.”

Cang Yuan’s gaze turned intent and he muttered, “B-Bullying people?”

He was somewhat unable to understand why a mere Third Firmament True God would be bullying people?

In the Cloudpill Summit, alchemy geniuses of this level should have a lot.

Ye Yuan poisoning several thousand True God powerhouses to death this time was seriously too glaring.

Hence, in Cang Yuan’s impression, Ye Yuan was merely a very impressive poison master.

Ye Yuan’s gaze twinkled, clearly somewhat stirred, and asked, “Is this Cloudpill Summit very impressive?”

The moment this question came out, the whole place was silent. Everyone used disbelieving gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

“Little Friend Ye Yuan, you actually don’t even know about the Cloudpill Summit?” Empyrean Chaoyuan said in surprise.

“Is the Cloudpill Summit very famous?” Ye Yuan said with a puzzled look.

Ye Yuan really did not know about this Cloudpill Summit. Dustless never told him before as well.

He also asked Dustless just now, clearly, he did not know either.

It seemed like this Cloudpill Summit should only have appeared after Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove died.

Empyrean Cang Yuan said with a cold smile, “Never even heard of the Cloudpill Summit, but you also dare to call yourself an alchemist?”

Even Lu Yan three people also had doubtful looks.

They had some doubts now that these three great Empyreans’ appearance was not Ye Yuan’s work at all.

Ye Yuan said with a look of amusement, “Does knowing about the Cloudpill Summit count as being an alchemist?”

Empyrean Chaoyuan and the rest all thought that Ye Yuan had an extremely profound background. Hence, that was why he could possess such terrifying strength at this age.

But now, they were somewhat uncertain.

In this land of the Southern Border, as long as one had some background, they should know about the Cloudpill Summit.

Let alone that Ye Yuan was even such a formidable alchemist.

If Ye Yuan was really just a genius who grew up at the bottom, then ... how monstrous was this guy!

Empyrean Chaoyuan said, “Little Ye Yuan isn’t aware, but this Cloudpill Summit has a resounding reputation in our land of Southern Border. It’s the alchemy summit that all alchemists look forward to. As long as one is an alchemist, they will take pride in going to the Cloudpill Summit once. There are even some Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda’s alchemy geniuses that will also come forth and take part ...”

Empyrean Chaoyuan briefly recounted the origin of the Cloudpill Summit. Ye Yuan was also greatly interested after he heard.

Gathering the entire Southern Border’s alchemy geniuses, that was naturally an extremely grand meet.

Especially that there were also quite a few Dao Realm alchemists like Empyrean Flutterfeather.

Exchanging with alchemists like this was naturally what Ye Yuan wished in his heart.

Ancestor Realm was vague and ephemeral. Ye Yuan understood that constantly coping himself up in the room to work without reference was also not a good idea.

If he had a few more exchanges with people like Empyrean Flutterfeather, he might be able to break through the shackles.

“So that’s how it is, then I naturally have to go and experience it.” Ye Yuan nodded and said.

Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled and said, “This Empyrean knew that you would be interested. But if you go to the Cloudpill Summit, you naturally don’t have to fight with those so-called geniuses. Us seven great alchemy holy lands each have two grandmaster tokens. One is naturally this Empyrean’s. As for the other piece, this Empyrean thought it through, it’s still you who’s most apt.”

As he said, Empyrean Flutterfeather waved a hand. A pale-yellow light flew towards Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan reached his hand out and took it. An archaic copper-colored token appeared in his hand.

The whole audience was petrified!

The group of Empyrean powerhouses was shocked to the extreme in their hearts.

Grandmaster token!

That was a grandmaster token!

The Cloudpill Summit’s grandmaster token, that represented the strongest Alchemy Dao existences under Heavenly Emperor. How venerate was the status?

Now, Empyrean Flutterfeather actually handed it to Ye Yuan so casually!

What capability did this kid have?

Even Empyrean Chaoyuan the few of them were also shocked speechless at this time.

The few of them had heard of Ye Yuan’s monstrousness from the mouths of Song Yu and the rest. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But that was hearsay after all.

They came here primarily because of Song Yu and the others’ emperor surmounting aura.

As for the others, they were still half-dubious in the end.

But now, one grandmaster token was already sufficient to explain everything.

With Empyrean Flutterfeather’s identity and status, how could he possibly hand such a valuable token to Ye Yuan for no reason?

The shock in Empyrean Cang Yuan’s heart was unable to use words to describe at all.

Empyrean Flutterfeather gave Ye Yuan a grandmaster token. What did this represent?

This represented that Empyrean Flutterfeather acknowledged that Ye Yuan’s status could already be on an equal footing with him!

This ... was too terrifying!

How venerated was Empyrean Flutterfeather’s status? Even in front of Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether, Empyrean Flutterfeather could also speak on equal footing.

Even though Empyrean Flutterfeather was just an Empyrean powerhouse, his position in the Southern Border’s alchemy world was irreplaceable.

Legends said that Empyrean Flutterfeather even had a likelihood of stepping into Ancestor Realm.

Then his status would go up a level!

So what if Heavenly Emperor?

Heavenly Emperors needed medicinal pills too!

He did not need rank seven divine pills, but did his subordinates not require them?

Without medicinal pills, what would they use to win over Empyrean powerhouses?

Hence, Empyrean Flutterfeather’s status was extremely high in the Southern Border and did not even lose to Heavenly Emperors.

But such a great deity was actually conversing as peers with Ye Yuan.

This ... This was too subverting!

How could a Third Firmament True God possibly have such powerful capabilities?

The crux was that he actually did not even know about the Cloudpill Summit!

Just what kind of freak did Heavenly Eagle Imperial City produce?!
