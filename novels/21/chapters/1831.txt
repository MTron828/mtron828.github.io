1835 Divine Vestige Space, Untainted by Myriad Laws!

In Yang Shen’s heart, Ye Yuan was his ultimate goal.

Killing a hundred Yi Qingxiangs was also not as important as killing one Ye Yuan.

Hence, when dealing with Yi Qingxiang them all, Yang Shen did not go all out.

While it was good to be able to kill, failing to kill was no big deal too.

The most important thing was that Ye Yuan had to die.

The instigator of all this was Ye Yuan.

Looking at Ye Yuan’s sluggish movements, a hint of a hideous grin flashed across the corners of Yang Shen’s mouth. A saver turned into a white streak, hacking over toward Ye Yuan’s head.

However, just as Yang Shen’s blade arrived in front of Ye Yuan’s face, it suddenly stopped, as if frozen in the air.

His figure was unable to advance an inch forward.

In front of Yang Shen, there was seemingly boundless space, waiting for him to cross.

His saber cut through one layer of space after another, but it was unable to land on Ye Yuan.

Two supreme laws collided together violently!

“Hahaha, it’s useless! In front of time laws, everything is in vain! Go to hell!”

Yang Shen let out a wild laugh, light radiating on his body. The long blade actually pushed another inch forward.

The blade was already less than an inch away from the top of Ye Yuan’s head!

The piercing cold light made Ye Yuan somewhat unable to open his eyes.

Everyone’s hearts leaped to their throats, looking at this soul-stirring scene.

The complexions of Baili Qingyan and the rest turned pale, looking nervous.

This blade landing, Ye Yuan would be done for!

But right at this time, countless blue filaments spread out of Ye Yuan’s body frenziedly, like spiders spinning silk.

Yang Shen’s face changed. These fine filaments accumulated more and more, wrapping the two of them up very quickly.

From the outside world, the inside completely could not be seen at all.

“This ... What is this?” Du Rufeng’s face changed as he asked.

A hint of terror also showed in Little Tong’s eyes as he said, “This ... seems to be a power similar to world power. But it also seems to be somewhat different. If my conjectures are right, Ye Yuan already won!”

Du Rufeng’s gaze turned intent and he said, “Won just like this? I don’t know what’s happening inside!”

Little Tong said, “Although we don’t know what’s happening inside, this move is definitely extraordinary. Because ... even I also felt danger!”

Du Rufeng turned pale with fright when he heard that. He was aware of what kind of existence Little Tong was.

Even he could actually feel danger. Then this blue filament ball was definitely extremely terrifying.

Inside the filament ball, Ye Yuan’s two eyes showed an azure-blue color. Long sword swinging, it directly blew away Yang Shen’s blade.

Yang Shen’s gaze turned sharp and he exclaimed, “This ... How is this possible? Time law!”

Yang Shen tried his best to urge time law, but time law seemed to have thoroughly lost connection with him, unable to feel it anymore.

This situation made his heart sink to rock-bottom.

Ye Yuan’s azure-blue eyes looked at Yang Shen, his eyes not carrying the least bit of emotion as he said, “You held back your strength, but have you ever thought that I also held back my strength? Don’t need to waste strength anymore. Inside this Divine Vestige Space, it’s untainted by myriad laws! The rules here are set by me. All the laws that you comprehend in the Heavenspan World are useless!”

After Ye Yuan broke through to Divine Vestige Realm, he discovered that he had the ability to construct the Divine Vestige Space.

Once he entered the Divine Vestige Space, Ye Yuan could control all powers of law!

In this place, he was the sovereign!

Clearly, Yang Shen did not believe it at all. He laughed wildly when he heard that and said, “You set the rules? Do you think that you’re the Creator? Killing people with laughter!”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Don’t believe? Watch! Time, stop!”

Only to see him lightly point a finger out, Yang Shen’s body suddenly turned stiff.

He struggled desperately, but he discovered that he was unable to move at all!

Yang Shen was very familiar with time laws. He could sense that this was not some so-called immobilization spell, but a genuine time stop!

Titanic waves stirred in his heart, looking at Ye Yuan in immense shock.

This ... How was this possible?

Time stop was an extremely profound time law. One had to at least cultivate beyond the seventh firmament before they could control the power of law.

But Ye Yuan clearly did not know time law, yet he could do it to this step.

This was also to say that Ye Yuan did not lie, he could really control this space!

Too inconceivable!

It was too fantastical!

There was actually still such a bizarre thing in this world.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Looks like you believe it. Then, you can go and die.”

A hint of panic flashed across in Yang Shen’s heart. He had never panicked like this before.

It was as if the being he was facing right now was really the Creator.

“H-Hang on! I ... I was wrong, spare me! I promise that I absolutely won’t find trouble with you in the future!” Yang Shen shouted.

Ye Yuan’s gaze did not carry the slightest emotion. He just said coolly, “It’s too late to admit your fault now.”

Done talking, Ye Yuan pointed another finger out. Yang Shen’s body disintegrated just like this, turning into nothingness.

Looking at Yang Shen’s slowly disappearing figure, Ye Yuan did not have the slightest ripple.

The current Ye Yuan, his disposition was greatly different from usual.

He exuded an icy-cold aura from head to toe as if he was an ice-man without the least bit of emotion.

No idea how long had passed either, the blue filaments slowly faded away, merging into Ye Yuan’s divine sea.

Plop!

Ye Yuan’s entire person lost consciousness, falling onto the ring.

Of course, there was already no Yang Shen on the stage. There was only Ye Yuan alone left.

Yang Shen was already dead until he could not be any deader.

There was an uproar all round!

Before this, Yang Shen was the sole candidate to win the championship. No one had ever thought that he would get second, let alone talk about dying.

But now, he was killed by Ye Yuan silently just like this?

Especially the High Clarity Sect’s elder, his one breath was pent up in his heart, virtually making him about to explode.

The High Clarity Sect that was powerful until it terrified people actually had six disciples die all at once this time. How would he report on his mission when he returned?! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Seeing that Du Rufeng was still in a daze, Little Tong reminded him and said, “Hey, you should announce the results.”

“Ah? Oh, oh!” Du Rufeng was akin to waking up from a dream.

The shock that this scene brought to him was seriously too intense.

That blue filament ball that was akin to a cocoon seemed to have the ability to devour everything, directly obliterating Yang Shen until not even dregs remained.

Just how strong was this Ye Yuan?

In reality, before this, he was not very optimistic about Ye Yuan.

After all, similar a possessor of a supreme law, Yang Shen’s realm was much higher than Ye Yuan’s.

No one had expected that what they waited for was actually such a result.

“This battle, Ye Yuan wins, Yang Shen perishes!” Du Rufeng said in a clear voice.

The moment his voice faded, a figure dashed onto the stage like lightning, and suddenly smacked a palm toward Ye Yuan who was currently in a coma.

High Clarity Sect’s elder!

At this time, his two eyes were bloodshot, already completely lost his reason.

Du Rufeng gave a cold snort and took a step out, and already arrived on the stage.

Bang!

Two mighty True God powerhouses suddenly exchanged a blow. The High Clarity Sect’s elder was immediately blasted flying.

“Han Jianqing, what are you trying to do?” Du Rufeng said coldly.
