Chapter 1319: Traitor Arising!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Two people, two steeds.

Ye Yuan and Luo Jian, one in front, one at the back, galloped on the open road.

Today, the sun had not risen yet, and the two people already quietly went out of Jewelhill City.

In a blink, they already galloped several tens of thousands of miles away.

Leaving the city this time, Ye Yuan was still very cautious.

He knew that once the Wang Family learned about the news of him exiting the city, they would definitely deal a killing blow.

These few years, Ye Yuan had been refining pills inside the World Suppressing Stele all along, refining a large batch of medicinal pills for the Myriad Treasure Tower.

These medicinal pills, Ye Yuan had notified Manager Su as well, letting him wait until after he went out of the city before starting to roll them out.

The news of him exiting seclusion was also sealed off very tightly. Apart from a few core members of the Myriad Treasure Tower, no one knew at all.

After all, he had already entered closed-seclusion for ten years. It was impossible for the Wang Family to constantly keep an eye on Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan knew that for the Wang Family to be able to become one of the three great families, they had a Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm ancestor.

Such a great family, Ye Yuan’s current strength could not resist at all.

Hence, he had no choice but to be more careful.

It was just that Ye Yuan never dreamed that the news of him leaving seclusion was long leaked to Wang Lingo by someone already.

The Wang Family’s assassin was long lying in ambush ahead already.

The two people were currently galloping when a figure in front blocked the way.

There were no villages ahead and no inns at the back in this place, it was precisely a good place to kill people and rob.

Swoosh, swoosh ...

They did not see a person take any action either but two gusts of wind assailed them.

Ye Yuan’s expression changed, leaping up.

Boom!

The flying dragon colts that the two people were riding were directly blasted into dregs.

The Heavenspan World’s Deity Realm powerhouses were unable to fly too. This flying dragon colt was a means of travel, capable of traveling as far as several tens of thousands of miles a day!

He did not expect that they were actually annihilated just like this.

Judging from the strength that this person exhibited, he was actually a grand completion Grotto Profound expert!

The two people landed, and Luo Jian’s brows furrowed as he said, “Wang Yugan!”

The old man smiled faintly and said, “I didn’t expect that there’s still someone who remembers this old man! You’re Luo Jian? I heard of you before, Jewelhill City’s up-and-coming star, known as Myriad Treasure Tower’s number one swordsman!”

Luo Jian’s furrowed his brows but did not answer.

Ye Yuan’s brows were also tightly locked as he asked, “The Wang Family’s people?”

Luo Jian nodded his head and said, “The Wang Family’s fourth elder was already Grotto Profound Deity Realm 5000 years ago! He normally doesn’t leave seclusion. I didn’t expect that Wang Lingbo actually sent him out!”

Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, “Our whereabouts have been leaked. Looks like ... the Myriad Treasure Tower has a traitor!”

“Impossible!” Luo Jian blurted out.

Clearly, he totally did not believe that the Myriad Treasure Tower would have someone be a traitor.

Ye Yuan smiled and did not dispute.

Leaving the city this time, he was already very careful but was still found out by the Wang Family’s people. A traitor definitely emerged in the Myriad Treasure Tower.

This point was indisputable.

It was just that Ye Yuan could not guess who would betray the Myriad Treasure Tower.

“Who is it?” Luo Jian suddenly said.

“There are targets of suspicion, but still don’t dare to confirm. Now isn’t the time to talk about this. Can you deal with this guy?” Ye Yuan said.

Luo Jian hugged his sword and looked at Wang Yugan and said, “I’ll give it a shot! You leave first!”

The moment Wang Yugan heard these words, he could not help bursting into laughter and said, “Brat who’s ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth! When this old man roamed unobstructed in Jewelhill City, you all weren’t even born yet! Luo Jian, I know that you’re hailed as having the strength that approaches grand completion Grotto Profound. But in front of this old man, there’s absolutely no chance at all.”

Luo Jian was not articulate, he had always used a sword to talk.

Clank!

The long sword coming out of the sheath, a cold light appeared!

Wang Yugan’s laughter abruptly ceased. Luo Jian’s sword already arrived in front of him!

“Grand completion Grotto Profound! How can that be?!” Wang Yugan exclaimed.

Exclaiming was exclaiming, but the movements of Wang Yugan’s hands were not the slightest bit slow.

Clank!

The long spear came out of the sheath, nailing onto Luo Jian’s sword accurately.

The webbing between Luo Jian’s thumb and index finger shocked until it turned numb, his figure directly flying out horizontally.

This time, Luo Jian met his match!

“Heh,

this old man is really very surprised. You actually just broke through to grand completion Grotto Profound before coming out of the city!”

Even though Wang Yugan was shocked, he was not worried.

Even if Luo Jian’s strength was very powerful, he was also not his match.

After all, he was only missing a step to be able to break through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm!

It was just too bad that this step was as hard as ascending to heaven.

If barring no accidents, it would probably be hard for him to break through in this lifetime.

Luo Jian looked towards Ye Yuan, his gaze revealing a look of gratitude.

It was precisely the divine-grade Divine Essence Pill that Ye Yuan gifted him in private that helped him to burst through the bottleneck, breaking through to grand completion Grotto Profound.

His realm had always been stuck at peak late-stage Grotto Profound but had never found the opportunity to break through.

With Luo Jian’s current realm, the Divine Essence Pill was long useless to him already.

Unless it was divine-grade Divine Essence Pill!

The low-grade Tier 1 divine pills Ye Yuan refined also did not have much effect on him. But this Divine Essence Pill was able to keep on consuming until breaking through to Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm.

Of course, the prerequisite was that consuming it still had an effect. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Under the stimulation of the divine-grade Divine Essence Pill, Luo Jian finally broke through the bottleneck that he was stuck at for many years in one stroke.

Wang Yugan was shrewd with age and saw through many things with one glance, and could not help saying in surprise, “Looks like it was this brat who helped you to break through the bottleneck. In your current state, unless it’s the divine-grade Divine Essence Pill! Truly inconceivable! This kid refines divine-grade Divine Essence Pills as easily as eating and drinking! No wonder Lingbo that child is so apprehensive of you. With you at the Myriad Treasure Tower, wouldn’t my Wang Family forever not have the day to hold our heads up high?”

Talking to the back, Wang Yugan did not conceal his killing intent in the slightest.

Luo Jian gave a cold snort and said, “Want to kill him, go through me first!”

Wang Yugan smiled and said, “Your breakthrough was indeed out of my expectations. However, this will not change the outcome! You’re still too inexperienced in front of me!”

Done talking, Wang Yugan’s long spear was raised, suddenly stabbing a spear out, the momentum like a dragon!

Luo Jian’s face revealed an unprecedented solemnness!

Wang Yugan’s spear technique was heavy and powerful, with quite the air of a general, and may be rated as experienced and vicious.

Luo Jian’s figure was akin to a sheet of blank paper under this long spear; it could be torn apart by the wind.

However, Luo Jian’s Gale Wind Sword Art took the agile route in the first place.

He did not clash head-on with Wang Yugan but moved around him instead.

“Ye Yuan, you leave first! I’ll hold him!” Luo Jian shouted.

However, Ye Yuan did not have the intention of moving and said coolly, “This Ye won’t abandon Brother Luo and leave. Brother Luo, feel free to let loose. If Brother Luo perishes, this Ye will die together with you!”

These words were said decisively, without the least bit of hesitation.

Ye Yuan’s voice entering the ear, Luo Jian was incomparably touched in his heart.

Ye Yuan was indeed a sentimental and righteous person. If it were another person, they would have fled long ago.

The words greatly roused Luo Jian’s spirits. The power of the sword in his hands increasing by a bit.

Ye Yuan was merely initial-stage Grotto Profound. The disparity between the two was too great, and he could not intervene at all and could only observe from the sideline.

Ye Yuan’s strength naturally could not compare to ordinary martial artists. But the current him was unable to cross a major realm to battle like at the Immortal Grove World.

Counting the Voice of the Dragon God, these trump cards, Ye Yuan’s current combat power was also just equivalent to middle-stage Grotto Profound martial artists.

Seeing that Ye Yuan did not have the intention of escaping, Wang Yugan also heaved a sigh in relief.

Luo Jian’s breakthrough was outside of his expectations.

If Ye Yuan wanted to run away, he could certainly kill Luo Jian. But wanting to capture Ye Yuan again would be hard.
