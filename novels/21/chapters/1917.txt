Chapter 1921: Tong’er Apologizes

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Heh, I don’t understand, but I know that His Excellency has never failed before! He might not be a match for a True God, but competing in pill refinement, no one can surpass him!”

Hearing Tong’er’s words, Ning Tianping was also very disdainful.

Although he knew that Tong’er was an Empyrean powerhouse, Tong’er’s attitude made him very displeased.

Following Ye Yuan for a long time, Ning Tianping already had blind confidence in Ye Yuan.

This was not his individual worship, but the confidence that was continuously established in his heart from the miracle after miracle that he saw being at Ye Yuan’s side.

This kind of confidence was virtually unshakable.

At least in alchemy, Ye Yuan had never failed before!

No matter how difficult it was to refine a medicinal pill, reaching Ye Yuan’s hands, it was also accomplished with ease.

Especially after breaking through to the Divine Lord Realm, Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength became more and more miraculous. It was naturally impossible for Ning Tianping to have any doubts.

Tong’er looked at Ning Tianping like looking at an idiot and said coolly, “Perhaps this Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill is his greatest challenge up to this point! I’m not saying that he can’t refine it, it’s just that ... he has a very high chance of failing.”

“Not possible!” Ning Tianping returned two words sonorous and forcefully.

Tong’er could not help choking when he heard it and said with a cold snort, “Impervious to reason!”

At this time, Xiao Feng suddenly spoke up, “Senior Tong’er is right, maybe ... this shall be Younger Brother Ye’s greatest challenge up to this point! This Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill is different from the medicinal pills that he had encountered in the past.”

Xiao Feng explained the special aspects of the Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill for Ning Tianping and Bai Chen.

He himself was an alchemist and was naturally clear about the knack involved.

Listening to his explanation until the end, Ning Tianping’s and Bai Chen’s expressions also became solemn.

“Competing in pill refinement, could it be that this Empyrean doesn’t know more than you guys? Just a rank five divine pill, if Ye Yuan had the confidence of success, why would this Empyrean wait until he’s at grand completion Dao Realm before opening my mouth? Two ignorant brats!” Tong’er said unhappily.

Ning Tianping fell silent, but very soon, he lifted his head again and said to Tong’er, “Either way, it’s impossible for His Excellency to fail, you just look properly!”

Tong’er could not help choking when he heard this, and then he said with a cold snort, “Hopelessly foolish!”

...

In the blink of an eye, it was 30 over days, Ye Yuan did not come out all along.

Ning Tianping finally realized that what Tong’er and Xiao Feng said was not exaggerating things to raise an alarm.

He had never seen Ye Yuan spend such a long time on one medicinal pill before.

Outside the door, Ning Tianping paced back and forth, appearing somewhat vexed.

“Stop walking around, my eyes are becoming dizzy thanks to you!” Tong’er said unhappily.

“Humph! His Excellency is refining the pill for you, you’re actually not worried at all! If anything happens to His Excellency, I won’t let you off!” Ning Tianping said with a cold snort.

Creak!

Right at this time, the door opened from inside. A weary to the extreme figure slowly walked out from inside.

“Your Excellency! Are ... Are you alright?” Seeing Ye Yuan’s appearance, Ning Tianping nearly jumped up and hurriedly went forward to support.

The current Ye Yuan’s two eyes were full of blood traces, his hair somewhat disheveled, his entire person like he had a great illness.

In Ning Tianping’s impression, Ye Yuan was always calm and collected when refining pills, accomplishing with great ease. When had he become like this?

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said feebly, “It’s just that the mental strength expenditure was too great. I’ll be fine after resting for a few days.”

Tong’er stood up, his expression when looking at Ye Yuan involuntarily changed.

“Failed?”

The Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill was passed down by the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s forefather.

For countless years, the Bamboo Groove Void Realm had once gathered spirit medicines several times. But up to this date, no one had successfully refined it before.

Even a peak Seven-star Alchemy God that had once appeared also never succeeded before.

Not that they could not refine a high-quality medicinal pill, but that they never succeeded in forming the pill before!

Not even once!

And this medicinal pill was merely just a rank five divine pill. The refining difficulty could be imagined.

Hence, Tong’er actually did not harbor much hope in Ye Yuan.

Swoosh!

A streak of flowing light streaked past, Tong’er reached his hand out to catch, a small bottle appeared in his hand.

Immediately his expression solidified!

Tong’er looked at Ye Yuan in surprise and said, “You ... You actually really succeeded!”

Ye Yuan’s face revealed a hint of a smile and said, “Heh heh, this medicinal pill really has a kick, almost killing me! Honestly speaking, I’ve refined pills for so many years, this is the most tiring time! But ... succeeded by a fluke!”

“F-Fluke?” Tong’er looked at Ye Yuan and said in incredible shock.

He himself was an alchemist and naturally knew how hard on one’s mental strength it was to refine a medicinal pill.

But Ye Yuan’s alchemy strength, he was too clear!

Even if he found a Seven-star Alchemy God right now, in terms of refining a rank five divine pill, his strength might not be stronger than Ye Yuan.

To be able to torment Ye Yuan until like this, it could be seen how much effort he expended for this medicinal pill! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A wisp of divine sense sunk into the small bottle, Tong’er’s entire person was akin to being struck by lightning.

Thud!

“Awoo! Awoo!”

Treasure Pig fell to the ground and started crying out, indicating his displeasure.

But Tong’er did not have any reaction at all. He was still in the midst of shock.

“V-Vast spirit divine pill! How ... How did you do it?” Tong’er looked at Ye Yuan as if he was looking at a prehistoric behemoth.

No one had ever refined this medicinal pill before. Even in the Heavenspan World, there probably wasn’t this pill formula at all.

But, not only did Ye Yuan refine it, he even performed to an extremely high level, refining it into a vast spirit divine pill!

Similarly level nine difficulty, the Exquisite Jade Heart Recovery Pill and Cleansing Rain Dream Reverting Pill, these two medicinal pills, completely could not be compared at all.

The medicinal properties of those spirit medicines, Ye Yuan had no way of familiarizing at all. Ye Yuan could only deduce it bit by bit.

Under such circumstances, being able to refine high-grade was already extremely remarkable.

But Ye Yuan took out a perfect medicinal pill!

Tong’er really did not know what words to use to describe the shock in his heart currently.

Rather, it was Ning Tianping whose thoughts and feelings were not as strong as him, saying with a big laugh, “Hahaha, what did I say? With His Excellency taking action, he definitely won’t fail! In alchemy, he’s undefeatable!”

The current Ning Tianping was like a victor.

In this one month, he was very worried about Ye Yuan, but his confidence in Ye Yuan had never wavered before.

With Ye Yuan being successful, this fact proved that Ning Tianping was right!

Tong’er opened his mouth, but nothing came out.

At this moment, he suddenly discovered that his understanding of Ye Yuan was still so shallow.

In this one month, he felt that Ning Tianping’s confidence in Ye Yuan was overly blind.

But he discovered now that this was not the case.

With Ye Yuan’s age, being able to achieve such horrifying accomplishments in alchemy, one could not use common sense to appraise him at all.

Hence, Ning Tianping’s confidence might not have been blind worship.

Not, not maybe, but definitely!

Tong’er looked at Ning Tianping and let out a heavy sigh as he said, “Alright, I admit that I was wrong! I underestimated Ye Yuan. His might doesn’t originate from his strength. This kid’s future accomplishments are unimaginable!”

Ning Tianping was taken aback, this haughty Empyrean powerhouse actually apologized to him?
