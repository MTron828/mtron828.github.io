Chapter 2572: Five Light Heavenly Region!

“Jade Face Swordsman, Luo Yunqing?” Ye Yuan looked at the arrival with a frown, muttering to himself.

This was his first time seeing an ascender apart from himself.

The person in front of him did not hide his strength but displayed it openly.

This imposing aura, he had clearly already broken through Greater Sublime Heavenly Stratum, and reached Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum!

Furthermore, this person walked over calmly, but was like a sharp sword, forcing people until they could not open their eyes.

Strong!

This was the first impression that Jade Face Swordsman gave Ye Yuan!

A hint of solemness also flashed across Ye Yuan’s face.

This person was too strong, he was unable to contend at all.

Looking at the reactions of Zhao Kun and the rest, the arrival did not come with friendly intentions!

Luo Yunqing walked over slowly, seemingly slow, but in reality fast, arriving in front of them in a few breaths.

“Young man, come with me! True Yang Heavenly Domain isn’t suited for you!” Luo Yunqing looked at Ye Yuan and said coolly.

Ye Yuan was taken aback. Clearly, he did not expect that this Luo Yunqing was actually here to solicit him.

Zhao Kun had a shocked face as he said, “Jade Face Swordsman Luo Yunqing actually came personally to be the guide!”

Ye Yuan was at a loss, completely not knowing what they were talking about.

Although he had arrived at Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven for a number of years, it was only limited to the remote land of Eastward Country. So he did not understand many things.

Such as this guide.

Ye Yuan looked at Luo Yunqing and asked with a frown, “Guide?”

Luo Yunqing seemed to be very patient, saying with a light smile, “Ascenders are scattered in all regions. However, in the vicinity of these Five Great Heavenly Regions, apart from Five Light Heavenly Region, the other four great heavenly regions are extremely averse to ascenders. In those regions, they will kill on sight! Therefore, Five Light Heavenly Region sent out many guides to enter deep into the four great heavenly regions, and guide ascenders into the Five Light Heavenly Region!”

When Ye Yuan heard that, he suddenly came to a realization.

Five Light Heavenly Region resisted the four great heavenly regions with the power of one region. So they naturally needed a lot of fresh power.

But ascenders were spread all over the various major heavenly regions. Apart from Five Light Heavenly Region, there were very few ascenders who could survive.

Hence, that was why there was a need for guides!

However, looking at the expressions of Zhao Kun and the rest, this Luo Yunqing had a rather high status among guides.

Ye Yuan shook his head, “Sorry, I don’t have the plans of going to Five Light Heavenly Region for the time being!”

Zhao Kun’s eyes because wide saucers, a look of astonishment on his face.

That was Luo Yunqing!

Luo Yunqing came to fetch him personally, how huge a face was this? This guy actually did not buy it!

But Luo Yunqing was indifferent and said with a smile, “You can’t go to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect. Believe me, if you go to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, you’ll die beyond a doubt!”

Ye Yuan frowned and said, “I don’t believe that!”

Luo Yunqing seemed to be very patient and said, “I know that your alchemy strength is head and shoulders above all others, but you don’t know Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s upper echelons’ attitude toward ascenders!”

Ye Yuan asked curiously,?“Oh??What attitude?”

Luo Yunqing said, “The stronger you are, the more apprehensive Jadetrue Heavenly Sect will be toward you! Because Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s founding ancestor, Yan Jadetrue, was severely wounded by my Five Light Heavenly Region’s major power, and he perished in the end! And Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s supreme treasure, the Heavenspan Mountain, was also lost because of this. Therefore, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect is extremely antagonistic toward ascenders! If you go to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, you’ll die without a doubt!”

After Ye Yuan heard, his heart could not calm down for a long time.

He did not expect that Yan Jadetrue actually died at the hands of Five Light Heavenly Region’s major power!

If it was really as Luo Yunqing said, then he would really be walking right into a trap if he went to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhao Kun and said in a solemn voice, “Is what he said true?”

Zhao Kun had a blank face as he said, “I … I don’t know!”

Luo Yunqing smiled and said, “This matter, very few ordinary disciples know of it, only those old undyings know. But in Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, they are extremely antagonistic toward ascenders. This is an undeniable fact!”

Ye Yuan drew a deep breath, appearing somewhat hesitant.

Luo Yunqing continued, “Whether what I said is real or fake, you’ll naturally know in the future. But it’s clearly not worth it for you to go and take the risk now. You’re a clever man. So you know what and how you should choose.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Yuan looked at Luo Yunqing and said, “You seem to understand me very well!”

Luo Yunqing smiled and said, “I’ve already laid low in Eastward imperial city for close to ten years! If not for you suddenly wanting to go to Jadetrue Heavenly Sect, I wouldn’t have shown myself either. If I take action here, I believe that Jadetrue Heavenly Sect won’t vent their anger on Eastward Country too.”

Ye Yuan was secretly shocked in his heart. He did not expect that he was actually being monitored for as long as ten years!

But Luo Yunqing had indeed considered things for him very much already.

He knew that he regarded the connections in Eastward Country very highly, so he deliberately chose to take action at the border between the two countries.

With Luo Yunqing’s strength, wanting to forcibly take him away did not take any effort at all.

But, this level of powerhouse actually laid low for him for ten years!

Furthermore, he was persuading him patiently here. Clearly, he regarded him very highly!

Luo Yunqing could be said to have treated him extremely politely already.

If he was still not sensible, it could not quite be justified anymore.

Ye Yuan made up his mind and said, “Alright, I’ll go with you!”

Luo Yunqing smiled slightly and said, “Many thanks, Brother Ye, for your understanding!”

Thud!

Right at this time, Zhao Kun suddenly knelt down and sobbed, “L-Lord Luo, spare our lives!”

Clearly, they dreaded this Luo Yunqing to the extreme.

Luo Yunqing did not speak, several streaks of cold light flashed past and the four people were killed instantly!

Ye Yuan’s pupils constricted. With his eyesight, he actually did not see how Luo Yunqing unleashed his sword!

Strong!

Really very strong!

Four people dying, Luo Yunqing seemed to have done an insignificant thing and still smiled faintly as he said, “My sword is very easy to recognize. Jadetrue Heavenly Sect won’t vent their anger on Eastward Country! Now, what else do you want to ask?”

Luo Yunqing killed people in order to let Jadetrue Heavenly Sect know that he did it.

This way, Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s spearhead would be pointed at him and not Eastward Country.

The consideration that he showed for Ye Yuan was really very thoughtful.

Ye Yuan was well aware that concerning Luo Yunqing valuing him highly, it was actually taking fancy on his ability to refine pills.

Ascenders were unable to refine pills. So Five Light Heavenly Region’s heavenly alchemists must be surprisingly rare.

Furthermore, being limited by affinity, the standards of the heavenly alchemists there were likely not very good as well.

Therefore, that was why a top powerhouse like Luo Yunqing would put his ego aside and converse with him as a peer.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I want to know about Five Light Heavenly Region’s matters!”

Luo Yunqing nodded slightly and started talking tirelessly.

It turned out that this region where the Five Great Heavenly Regions was situated was just a corner of Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven. It was called Rainclear Continent.

On Rainclear Continent, there were originally only four great heavenly regions. There was no Five Light Heavenly Region.

Native forces had always kept a high-pressure attitude toward ascenders.

Countless ascenders died under the hands of the native forces.

The ascenders were naturally unwilling to resign themselves to death.

Hence, they joined forces and resisted the native factions.

Ascenders had limitless potential, once they gained a foothold, their strength was very powerful.

But ascenders were too scattered and too few compared to native factions.

No idea how long had passed, how many wars had been experienced, and how many ascenders had died, before they forcefully carved out a piece of heavenly region called Five Light Heavenly Region!

Since then, Five Light Heavenly Region became one of the Five Great Heavenly Regions!
