Chapter 1358: Suddenly Enlightened!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This Wang Family’s person is really funny, coming to kill people without forethought. In the end, he even had to extend a formal apology!”

“Heh, whether it’s really don’t know or feigning ignorance, only he himself is clear in his heart, right?”

“Either way, the Wang Family doesn’t have anyone good. With a younger brother like that, there is bound to be an older brother like that too! The younger brother is so utterly devoid of conscience, and this elder brother probably isn’t any better.”

...

The current Wang Song was pressed to the extreme. Making him apologize to the enemy who killed his younger brother, this was simply unprecedented humiliation to him.

In his eyes, Xiao Feng was too obviously biased towards Ye Yuan. This made him indignant in his heart.

Except, Xiao Feng’s status in Wu Meng Capital City is extremely revered. Forget about him, even the entire Wang Family could not afford to offend.

“En?”

Seeing Wang Song waveringly hesitantly, Xiao Feng clearly became somewhat impatient.

Wang Song’s entire body trembled, and he said unwillingly, “This little brother, it was I who was reckless beforehand, hope that little brother forgives!”

Whether an apology was sincere or not, Ye Yuan could naturally discern with one glance.

This kind of arrogant at heart and haughty in manner person would only feel that it was all other people’s fault. How could he feel that it was his fault?

Immediately, Ye Yuan sneered coldly and said, i Deputy City Lord Wang this brother, this Ye is unworthy to become friends with! In the future, if you want to find this Ye to take revenge again, this Ye will take it all!”

Xiao Feng was rather surprised. This Ye Yuan was so domineering.

Brightraise City’s Wang Family’s power, he was naturally aware.

Ordinary people really could not afford to offend such a major family.

Ye Yuan’s words were equivalent to declaring war on the entire Wang Family.

Could it be that this Ye Yuan was a fox assuming the majesty of a tiger, borrowing his strength to make the other party lower his head?

Thinking of this, he could not help spurning Ye Yuan slightly.

But this young man’s alchemy strength was indeed remarkable. If he could have him join the Myriad Treasure Tower because of this, there was no harm either.

Wang Song had an embarrassed look as he said, “Not at all, not at all, why would I? Teacher, if there’s nothing, Wang Song will take my leave here.”

“Go on,” Xiao Feng said coolly.

Getting Xiao Feng’s approval, Wang Song was akin to being granted amnesty, fleeing like flying.

This place, he could not stay for a moment longer.

With that farce ending, Yang Rui welcomed Xiao Feng into the Myriad Treasure Tower.

“Yang Rui never dreamed that Elder Xiao would actually personally descend upon Jewelhill City and failed to welcome. Hope that Elder Xiao doesn’t blame this Yang Rui!” Yang Rui said politely again.

Yang Rui was very perplexed. Why would the likes of Xiao Feng easily come to Jewelhill City, this kind of place?

If it was just in order to learn the Essence Cultivating Pill, it was truly making a big fuss over nothing.

Xiao Feng smiled and said, “I believe that you also know, I came for Little Brother Ye. This Essence Cultivating Pill is extraordinary!”

Ye Yuan said, “This Ye is very surprised too. With Master’s status, you actually came to Jewelhill City personally. This Essence Cultivating Pill, an initial-stage Three-star Alchemy God should already be able to comprehend it.”

These words coming out of a One-star Alchemy God’s mouth appeared very ridiculous.

Except, regardless of whether it was Xiao Feng or Yang Rui, they both felt that these words had nothing wrong.

Xiao Feng was a peak Three-star Alchemy God. A Tier 1 divine pill that even he could not refine, it could be seen how incredible this medicinal pill was.

Actually, Ye Yuan did not know how impressive Three-star Alchemy Gods were. This standard was also Dustless explaining to him to hear.

It was just that when he saw that Divine Healing Pill, Ye Yuan knew that this one in front of him absolutely could not be underestimated.

“Everyone has their shortcomings and merits. Little Brother Ye, why not ... let’s start?” Xiao Feng said with a smile.

Ye Yuan did not have the intention of being long-winded either, directly saying, “Elder Xiao, please!”

...

Wang Song did not leave Jewelhill City, but he directly entered the City Lord Manor.

Seeing Chen Yongnian, Wang Song naturally could not dispense with a bout of grumbling.

“Dear me, my brother Wang! How would I know that Teacher Xiao will appear in Jewelhill City? Looks like the Essence Cultivating Pill has already alarmed the Myriad Treasure Tower’s upper echelons! But, could it be that ... even Teacher Xiao, this kind of alchemy master, can’t refine the Essence Cultivating Pill too?”

Thinking up to this point, Chen Yongnian and Wang Song exchanged a glance, both seeing the astonishment from the other party’s eyes.

A mere middle-grade Tier 1 divine pill actually startled a peak Three-star Alchemy God. This was simply too inconceivable.

They only knew that the Essence Cultivating Pill was good stuff, but did not know how difficult it was to refine the Essence Cultivating Pill.

Now, with Xiao Feng as a reference, they finally had a clear understanding.

“Is this Essence Cultivating Pill really so amazing?” Wang Song frowned and said.

“Heh, more than amazing! Before this, I’d once taken a superior-grade Essence Cultivating Pill, and can you guess the result?” Chen Yongnian said.

“What?” Wang Song had his curiosity stirred by Chen Yongnian and could not resist asking.

“Not hiding from you, before consuming the Essence Cultivating Pill, my realm already hasn’t moved in ten years!”

Wang Song’s gaze turned intent, revealing a dumbfounded look.

A middle-grade Tier 1 divine pill actually had an effect on middle-grade Heaven Glimpse middle-grade. This was simply inconceivable!

At this moment, he finally knew why Xiao Feng came to Jewelhill City from very far away.

Ye Yuan’s value was too great!

Wang Song’s expression became very ugly. If it was really like this, it would not be so easy for him to want to deal with Ye Yuan.

“The matter is somewhat troublesome! With Teacher Xiao as his backer, my younger brother’s enmity will probably never be avenged!” Wang Song gnashed his teeth in hatred as he said this.

Chen Yongnian felt his head swell too. He was also put in a wretched state by Ye Yuan. Now, he was already without prestige in Jewelhill City.

Not killing Ye Yuan, it was hard to dispel the hatred in his heart!

Suddenly, Chen Yongnian’s mind stirred and he said, “Brother Wang, since the Myriad Treasure Tower already obtained the Essence Cultivating Pill’s pill formula, why not ... let’s report this matter to the capital city!”

Wang Song’s eyes lit up, but they dimmed down again very quickly. He said, “No doubt the capital city can’t possibly sit by idly and remain indifferent, but if that punk hides in the Myriad Treasure Tower and not come out, we can’t do anything to him either!”

Chen Yongnian heaved a sigh and said, “At this point, we can only take things one step at a time.”

...

With this, another half a year’s time passed.

Even Xiao Feng himself also did not expect that he actually used an entire half a year’s time to break through this Essence Cultivating Pill’s last layer. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Only upon hearing Ye Yuan expound on the Essence Cultivating Pill’s principles did Xiao Feng discover that turned out his understanding of Tier 1 divine pills was not as deep as he imagined.

On the contrary, along with the passing of time, he discovered his ignorance more and more!

It turned out that Tier 1 divine pills actually still had so many profound truths!

In a trance, he seemed to have touched some incredible existence.

“I profited more from a conversation with you than ten years of studying books! Little Brother Ye, this half a year ... really let this old man see the light!” Xiao Feng said with vicissitudes of emotion.

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Senior is too modest. Many of your views had tremendous benefits to this Ye as well.”

This was not Ye Yuan currying favor, Xiao Feng’s peak Three-star Alchemy God status was absolutely not an undeserved reputation.

His understanding of Alchemy Dao was clearly much deeper than Ye Yuan.

Many things, he could operate from a strategically advantageous position, entering remotely, making Ye Yuan similarly be enlightened all of a sudden.

Actually, this half a year was a mutual teaching process.

Talking about this, Xiao Feng was even more amazed.

Ye Yuan’s comprehension ability toward Alchemy Dao was too strong. Some originally very obscure things, he could often draw inferences and draw analogies!

He finally knew why Ye Yuan could refine the Essence Cultivating Pill while he could not!
