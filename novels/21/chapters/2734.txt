Chapter 2740: The Saint Exalts Who Were Scammed Miserably!

In the forest, dust was flying and it was long already in a chaotic mess.

Saint Exalt Waycloud and the rest were pursued until they ran all over the place.

“Roar!”

A huge roar sounded out, Saint Exalt Waycloud was slammed flying by an Ironblack Beast.

“Bastard, this exalt definitely won’t let you off!” Waycloud roared angrily.

But at this time, the Ironblack Beast’s eyes locked onto another person.

That person was merely a middle Jade Sovereign heaven and was inconspicuous in the crowd.

At this time, his expression became very ugly and he cussed heavily, “F*cking hell, this scoundrelly punk! This exalt was already very low-profile. Must you force Your Father out?”

While talking, his strength suddenly skyrocketed, and actually directly reached peak lower Saint Sovereign Heaven!

And his appearance also underwent huge changes.

The moment Waycloud saw, he could not help saying in a great rage, “Motherf*cker Cang Jie, you hid so deeply!”

Saint Exalt Cang Jie said crossly, “You’re the motherf*cker! Your entire family, they are all motherf*ckers! You couldn’t stand the loneliness and insist on revealing your identity! What the hell does it have to do with Your Father?”

Saint Exalt Waycloud’s face turned black,and he said in a solemn voice, “Stop talking nonsense! Let’s join hands and finish this thing off! Although this Ironblack Beast is only peak lower Saint Sovereign Heaven, its strength is too strong, I’m not a match by myself!”

Saint Exalt Cang Jie said, “Motherf*cker! Then what are you still standing there stupidly for? Why haven’t you made a move?”

The two great Saint Exalts were pressed into a corner too, every sentence carrying profanities.

These Saint Exalt true spirits that Ye Yuan released disrupted everyone’s plans.

Those like Saint Exalt Cang Jie did not even reveal their identities after seeing those heavenly medicines. Being hunted down at this time, he had no choice but to reveal his strength.

The other five hidden Saint Exalts were the same as him currently.

Keep holding back and that would be fatal.

They had been reluctant to take action all along. Their plan was to wait until there was truly a big opportunity, and then they would suddenly take action.

But now, they were forced to expose themselves.

These few Saint Exalts even had the heart to kill Ye Yuan.

But they had no choice but to face these Saint Exalt true spirits first.

Fortunately, they ran in time. These true spirits did not have much intelligence either. That was how they could preserve their lives.

Otherwise, being caught up to by those middle, or even upper Saint Sovereign Heavens, it would practically be certain death.

As for the greater part of the force, they had long already been scattered into a mess, each fleeing for themselves.

At this very moment, on a mountain, Big Yellow’s imposing momentum was currently in the midst of climbing wildly.

Ye Yuan snatched away the Heavenly Burial Water Caltrop Flower from Shi Yue’s hands previously, but there were still two kinds of core ingredients that were not collected yet.

He did not expect that they could be collected here.

Hence, he naturally did not delay anything either, directly refining a true grade heavenly imperial pill for Big Yellow.

Ye Yuan looked at Big Yellow breaking through and could not help frowning slightly as he said, “I didn’t expect that a heavenly imperial pill is actually unable to let him rise to middle Saint Sovereign Heaven! Each realm of Saint Sovereign Heaven, the gap is really huge!”

“Heavenly Stratum powerhouses, before Saint Sovereign Heaven, it’s all about consolidating the foundation! Only by stepping into Saint Sovereign Heaven is it considered truly attaining a higher level! After Saint Sovereign Heaven, each step is immensely difficult. Even if it’s a true grade heavenly pill, it’s impossible to let him reach the heavens in one step too! Of course, if you can refine grade five heavenly imperial pills, the effects will naturally be another matter altogether,” Mi Tian said.

Ye Yuan could not resist rolling his eyes. How could grade five heavenly imperial pills be so easy to refine?

The further up for heavenly imperial pills, the more difficult it was.

Furthermore, between grade four heavenly pills and grade five heavenly pills, it was like Jade Sovereign Heaven and Saint Sovereign Heaven, the gap was massive.

In alchemy, this was a tremendous watershed too.

Because grade five heavenly medicines contained Great Dao rules in their beings, they were extremely complicated.

Otherwise, how could it be called grade five?

Although Ye Yuan was confident, he also knew that it was not easy to take this step.

Of course, the most important thing was still having grade five heavenly pills to practice with.

However, grade five heavenly medicines were too precious. It was impossible for Ye Yuan to practice on a large scale too.

He had indeed collected quite a number of grade five heavenly medicines previously. But, these heavenly medicines were all extremely high quality heavenly medicines and not suitable to use for laying foundations.

Even if it was heavenly medicines that grade five Foundation Establishment Heavenly Pill required, they were extremely precious in the Rainclear Continent too.

Thinking about it, continuing to stay in the Rainclear Continent, it seemed like the prospect was just like that too. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After avenging the Martial Secure Heavenly Sect’s enmity, it would also be time for Ye Yuan to leave the Rainclear Continent.

Big Yellow’s realm only stopped at middle-stage lower Saint Sovereign Heaven in the end.

Ye Yuan was somewhat dissatisfied with this result. But Big Yellow was wildly ecstatic and endlessly grateful to Ye Yuan.

Sure enough, following Master Ye out was the wisest choice.

Going back after this trip, when Saint Exalt Bull Demon saw him, he would definitely get a big shock.

At that time, who knows whether or not he would let go of his pride and become a mount for Master Ye?

… …

Half a month later, in front of a magnificent hall, there were 13 Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, each and every one of them looking miserable like beggars.

“Motherf*cking Ye Yuan, he scammed Your Father badly! In order to shake off the Ironblack Beast, Your Father even ate the grade five heavenly pill that I hoarded!” Saint Exalt Waycloud gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

Grade five heavenly pills were not cabbages to them.

To Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouses, any grade five heavenly pill was their lifeblood.

But now, his lifeblood was gone. How could Saint Exalt Waycloud not be angry?

Saint Exalt Skyfortune also gnashed his teeth in hatred and said, “Be contented! The grade five heavenly pills that this exalt hoarded for several thousand years, they have all been depleted clean this time! If I still don’t get any benefits in the Labyrinth Divine Palace, this exalt would have made a terrible loss during this trip! This scoundrelly thing really knows how to scam people! Disregarding that he hauled sufficient benefits, he even scammed us miserably!”

“F*cking hell, you all should be content! This exalt was hunted down by seven Saint Exalts! There was even an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven among them! Putting aside that all my heavenly pills were exhausted, I was even forcibly beaten into serious injuries! Now, I can only unleash the strength of a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven!”

The one speaking was Saint Exalt Ji Yu. He was a middle Saint Sovereign Heaven powerhouse, his strength being outstanding.

But he had bad luck and was targeted by an upper Saint Sovereign Heaven and pursued all the way, narrowly escaping death several times.

Fortunately, those true spirits did not have high intelligence. Otherwise, he would have died long ago.

Even so, he was still seriously injured, his strength decreasing by 30%!

Now, he could only unleash the strength of a lower Saint Sovereign Heaven and had nowhere to go and cry.

The other Saint Exalts’ expressions looked bad.

Before the mountain pass gates, apart from these Saint Exalts, there were also quite a number of Jade Sovereign Heavens and half-step Saint Sovereign Heavens that arrived.

However, of the original four to five hundred strong Jade Sovereign Heaven brigade, there were only less than 200 left now!

Jade Sovereign Heaven powerhouses really suffered heavy losses.

However, there was one of them who was in high spirits and energetic.

He actually brought along a Saint Exalt true spirit beside him!

This Saint Exalt true spirit was precisely one of the ones that were hunting them down previously.

“Tsk tsk,?speaking of which, still really got to thank Ye Yuan! Without him, I also couldn’t have subdued a Saint Exalt true spirit!?Tsk tsk,?that guy used Big Yellow to scam me badly. Now, it can be considered to have compensated me!”

This person was none other than precisely Taoist Wu Fang!
