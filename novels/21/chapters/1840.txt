Chapter 1844 Digging One“s Own Grave

“So strong! Was that ... spatial law?”“My God, a First Firmament Celestial Deity actually kicked a Third Firmament Celestial Deity flying with one kick?”

“I didn’t expect that Han Xiao actually failed in a simple task.”

...

The moment Ye Yuan made his move, it took everyone’s breath away.

Everyone harbored the mentality of watching the show, thinking that Ye Yuan would suffer a big loss.

They did not expect that in the end, it was Han Xiao who went out lying down instead.

This kick was not light. Han Xiao vomited blood non-stop and did not recover for a long while.

“Damn brat, to actually dare sneak attack me! Three months later, the shame of this kick, I want you to repay it twofold!” Han Xiao clutched his chest and said in a cold voice.

Everyone knew that Han Xiao was genuinely enraged.

His identity was not ordinary, he was the imperial capital’s Han Family’s descendant.

The Han Family was a major family clan that ranked in the top three of the imperial capital, their strength extremely formidable.

...

Several days later, the man in black appeared in front of Leng Hao.

“Young Master, I’ve already inquired clearly, that brat’s name is called Ye Yuan, just entered the imperial capital. As for where he came from, there’s no way to find out. In short, prior to this, this boy was unknown.”

Leng Hao was slightly surprised when he heard that and said, “Shouldn’t be! Such astonishing talent, he definitely came from an imperial capital or even a great imperial capital, how could he be unknown? Could you have made a mistake?”

The man in black said, “This subordinate already screened through all the monstrous geniuses who possessed spatial law in great imperial capitals, as well as imperial capitals under Heavenly Emperor Brookfeather’s command. There isn’t Ye Yuan this name. Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be wrong.”

Great imperial capitals and imperial capitals under a Heavenly Emperor’s command were not as many as imperial cities.

As long as there was an information channel, screening could still be done.

But they did not discover Ye Yuan this person.

Hearing this, Leng Hao also heaved a sigh in relief and said nonchalantly, “Since that’s the case, then don’t keep this punk anymore. What is he doing now?”

The man in black clasped his hands and said, “Replying Young Master, he’s in closed-seclusion inside the Essence Gathering Pagoda. Heard that he paid three months worth of divine essence stones in one go. Furthermore, he even injured the Han Family’s Han Xiao.”

Leng Hao was taken aback and laughed in spite of himself as he said, “Han Xiao? It’s that disappointing fellow who was an adopted son of the Han Family, right? But like this is good too. With that kid’s nature, I reckon that he won’t let Ye Yuan off either. But just in case, better send Iron Eagle to go and finish him off.”

When the man in black heard that, he said in surprise, “Young Master, isn’t this ... making a big fuss over a minor issue? Iron Eagle is a Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity powerhouse!”

Celestial Deity Realm, the difference of each minor realm was tremendous.

Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity was another level.

This strength could be the patrolling inspector of imperial cities below already.

One had to know, the patrolling inspector of the Southridge Ten Nations was merely Fourth Firmament Celestial Deity too.

Now, wanting to have him go and deal with a First Firmament Celestial Deity, it was putting fine timber to petty use. This was a bit too much.

Leng Hao waved his hand and said, “A lion uses its full strength to catch a rabbit. This boy’s strength isn’t weak, so best be a little safer. You saw it too, Third Firmament Celestial Deity isn’t his match at all.”

The black-clothed man’s gaze turned slightly sharp and he said with a nod, “Yes, this subordinate will arrange it right away.”

...

Three months later, inside the cultivation room, Ye Yuan slowly opened both eyes.

His current aura was already much stronger than before.

His divine vortex became much smaller again compared to when he was First Firmament Celestial Deity, but the traces of divine marks became slightly clearer.

Second Firmament Divine Vestige!

Although it was just initial-stage Second Firmament Divine Vestige, in terms of divine essence thickness, even ordinary peak Second Firmament Celestial Deities might not be able to match up to Ye Yuan.

And this was precisely his powerful capital to jump realms and challenge to battle.

Rumble!

The door of the cultivation room opened once more, Ye Yuan slowly walked out.

Suddenly, a cold light flashed past and already arrived in front of Ye Yuan’s face.

An ambush!

This strike was grasped perfectly. Clearly, it had already accumulated momentum for a long time and did not give Ye Yuan the slightest reaction time at all.

However, Ye Yuan mobilized spatial law even faster than the other party!

Only to see his thoughts stir, the sword light was already drawn into the void by Ye Yuan.

Following that, his two hands clamped and directly clasped the tip of the sword that followed closely after.

All of this happened in the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint; quick to the extreme.

In everyone’s eyes, it had not even started and already ended.

“It’s you? Really, Heaven has a path, but you refuse to walk; hell has no gate yet you want to barge inside! I spared your life, but you don’t know how to be grateful and instead went from bad to worse.”

Ye Yuan’s tone gradually turned cold.

This person in front of him was none other than precisely Han Xiao.

He went back and recuperated his injuries for more than a month before fully recovering.

But in his heart, the more he thought, the more he could not take this lying down. Hence, these few days, he guarded outside the cultivation room, planning to give Ye Yuan a fatal blow.

He felt that Ye Yuan being able to trample him with a kick was entirely due to his own negligence.

With his Third Firmament Celestial Deity cultivation, if he suddenly made a sneak attack, it was nigh impossible for Ye Yuan, a First Firmament Celestial Deity, to ward it off!

It was just a shame that he still miscalculated.

Han Xiao felt that his sneak attack was very perfect. But even under this kind of circumstances, he still failed.

He finally knew that that kick of Ye Yuan’s was not some sneak attack.

The other party’s strength was genuinely powerful!

He desperately wanted to pull his sword out. Ye Yuan’s fingers were like pincers, unable to budge at all.

“B-Brat, what do you want to do? I’m a member of the Han Family. If you dare to touch me, you’ll die very horribly!” When Han Xiao saw that he was not a match, he could only bring the Han Family out.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “Han Family? The Han Family’s people can be so overbearing and can act with utter disregard for human life like this? If you want to kill people, you need to have the readiness to be killed.”

Han Xiao’s gaze turned intent, directly abandoning the long sword, scampering away at once.

Ye Yuan laughed coldly and threw the long sword in his hand out.

Whoosh!

It was only to see a cold light flash passed him. Han Xiao’s heart directly had a hole pierced through.

“So strong! He broke through to become a Second Firmament Celestial Deity. Can Second Firmament Celestial Deities be so strong?”

“The sneak attack just now, even Fourth Firmament Celestial Deities will likely find it hard to ward it off when caught by surprise too right? This guy actually blocked it!”

The people outside naturally all knew that Han Xiao was planning to sneak attack. They thought that Ye Yuan was dead for sure and harbored the thoughts of watching the show.

But who knew that the one who died was not Ye Yuan, but Han Xiao!

However, Ye Yuan actually really dared to kill the Han Family’s people, this guy was really bold!

Amidst everyone’s shocked gazes, Ye Yuan walked out of the Essence Gathering Pagoda and walked over in the direction of the tavern.

After a few turns, Ye Yuan walked into a remote alley.

“Following all the way, does your esteem self still not plan on taking action?” Suddenly, Ye Yuan stopped and said coolly.

A gray-robed man slowly walked out of the void, holding a sword while standing.

This gray-robed man’s eyes were cold, the murderous aura on his body extremely strong. One look and it was clear that he was not a good guy.

“Brat, you’re very strong, to actually be able to discover my traces!” Iron Eagle said icily.

Ye Yuan pursed his mouth and said, “You came to kill me, don’t you know that I know spatial law? What are you parading your bit of skill in front of me for? If I didn’t guess wrongly, you’re sent here by the Leng Family, right?”

Iron Eagle’s eyes turned intent and he said, “You’re very clever. It’s just a pity that you’re going to become a dead man very soon!”
