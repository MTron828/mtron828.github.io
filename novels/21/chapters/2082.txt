Chapter 2086: Soul Planting Secret Art

Feeling the bloody smell pervading in the air, Feng Tianyang’s gaze turned slightly cold.

But he did not look at Ye Yuan but looked toward Empyrean Loneswan.

“Loneswan, you actually dared to kill He Xiangyun. Could it be that you want to become enemies with my Vast Wind Assemble?” Feng Tianyang said coldly.

In his view, it was simply impossible for Ye Yuan to kill He Xiangyun, unless Loneswan turned traitor.

Loneswan shook his head lightly and said, “She wasn’t killed by this Empyrean.”

Feng Tianyang smiled coldly and said, “Still want to quibble? Apart from you, who else can kill He Xiangyun here? Also, what’s the meaning of this, Junior Apprentice Sister Yang?”

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s two eyes narrowed and she said in a solemn voice, “Fei-er, why haven’t you come over here!”

Yang Fei-er looked at Empyrean Ice Cloud, those eyes were like looking at a stranger.

“Master, it’s Fei-er’s last time calling you like this. From today onward, Fei-er will be leaving Ice Cloud Tower.” Yang Fei-er said coolly.

Empyrean Ice Cloud Tower’s pupils constricted and she said in a cold voice, “Treacherous disciple, do you know what you’re saying? Master nurtured you for so many years, but you actually want to break away from the Ice Cloud Tower? Fei-er, kill the person in front of you and return in front of Master. Master can take it as if nothing happened.”

Talking toward the back, Empyrean Ice Cloud’s words gradually became gentle, like a benevolent mother.

When Empyrean Ice Cloud was saying this, a light flashed in her eyes. A mysterious power transmitted out of her body, reaching Yang Fei-er.

This power was extremely hidden, even the Empyrean powerhouses present were unable to detect it.

It was just that Yang Fei-er was not moved at all as if she did not hear it at all.

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s face changed, her voice becoming sharp as she said, “Fei-er, Master is talking to you. Didn’t you hear?”

At this time, the Ye Yuan who had been silent all along suddenly smiled and said, “Are you wondering why you used the divine soul mystic art, but Senior Apprentice Sister Fei-er didn’t listen to your orders?”

When Empyrean Ice Cloud heard that, her heart jumped wildly.

Her Soul Planting Secret Art was extremely hidden, how did this boy discover it?

Furthermore, her secret art had never failed before, why would Yang Fei-er not listen to her orders?

Empyrean Ice Cloud had a stomach full of doubts, but she was an old monster who had lived for several hundred thousand years in the end, she naturally would not reveal it easily. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Stinking brat, at death’s door and you’re still spurting nonsense here. Do you believe that this Empyrean will tear your mouth right now?” Empyrean Ice Cloud said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan was indifferent as he said with a faint smile, “Unsavory history got dug out by me and turned angry from embarrassment? Huhu, using a divine soul mystic art to control your own disciples, a master like you really makes people’s hair stand on end!”

The moment these words came out, the faces of all of Ice Cloud Tower’s disciples changed drastically.

They looked towards Empyrean Ice Cloud with a look of terror, disbelief on their faces.

Being planted with a divine soul mystic art was equivalent to being another person’s slave.

As long as Empyrean Ice Cloud was willing, she could make them do anything.

This kind of thing, any martial artist would not be willing.

This kind of method, what difference was there between them and a bunch of pigs reared in pens?

Even the other Empyreans also looked at Empyrean Ice Cloud with incredibly shocked gazes.

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s eyes were icy-cold as she said in a frosty voice, “Humph! Despicable little brute, want to use this kind of method to sow discord in the Ice Cloud Tower? Do you think that you have a chance to escape like this?”

Empyrean Ice Cloud laughed coldly. A powerful to the extreme ice law suddenly expanded out and a palm smacked over toward Ye Yuan.

How fearsome was the palm of an Empyrean?

But right at this time, Empyrean Loneswan similarly made his move.

Bang!

The two people exchanged a palm in the air, leveling Grand Pill Establishment to the ground.

Ye Yuan looked at Empyrean Ice Cloud, his gaze gradually becoming cold.

When he treated Lu-er’s injuries, he was extra cautious and inspected Lu-er’s divine soul through the Soul Suppressing Pearl, only then, discovering an abnormality, and could not help breaking out into cold sweat from alarm.

It turned out that this was Empyrean Ice Cloud’s true trump card!

This kind of divine soul mystic art was extremely hidden, it was concealed within the Ice Cloud Tower’s cultivation method.

When Ice Cloud Tower’s disciples cultivated this cultivation method, it would secretly leave behind Empyrean Ice Cloud’s divine soul imprints in their divine souls.

As long as Empyrean Ice Cloud was willing, she could control these disciples through her divine soul imprints at any time.

If not for Ye Yuan having a secret treasure like the Soul Suppressing Pearl, he would really not be able to discover it.

With this trump card here, Empyrean Ice Cloud was not worried at all that Lu-er would not give in.

It was just that Empyrean Ice Cloud did not wish to arouse the disciples’ vigilance, coupled with that Feng Tianyang was currently in closed-seclusion and the time was not up yet, that was why she did not activate it.

As for capturing him to threaten Lu-er, it would naturally be good if she got him, but it also did not matter if she did not.

At that time, she just had to play a little trick in Lu-er’s divine soul, no one would discover it at all.

It was just that Empyrean Ice Cloud exhausted every power of her brain and also did not think that her unnecessary move provoked a Ye Yuan.

After Ye Yuan ferreted this out, he also felt lingering fear.

If not for him being extra cautious, the consequences would be too terrible to imagine.

At the same time, he also brimmed with killing intent.

This Empyrean Ice Cloud deserved to be killed!

After taking care of He Xiangyun earlier, Ye Yuan gave Yang Fei-er an inspection and indeed discovered that she was also planted with a divine soul imprint, and conveniently wiped it away for her.

Otherwise, Yang Fei-er also would not have this attitude toward Empyrean Ice Cloud.

“Killing off witnesses, just based on you?” Ye Yuan looked at Empyrean Ice Cloud and said with a cold smile.

Empyrean Ice Cloud’s expression flickered incessantly. Suddenly, she said to Feng Tianyang, “Honorable Nephew Tianyang, this boy is spurting nonsense. Also don’t know where he sent Lu-er to. He truly deserves death!”

Everyone’s hearts turned cold, aware that Empyrean Ice Cloud wanted to borrow a knife to kill people.

Feng Tianyang’s gaze looked at Ye Yuan coldly and he said coolly, “Kid, this young master give you a chance now. Hand Lu-er over, then kneel down and beg for mercy. This young master will let you become the Vast Wind Assemble’s grand protector, making your status even above Senior Xiao Yu’s!”

In Feng Tianyang’s view, Ye Yuan was merely a trapped beast currently.

He gave him a way out, he should be shedding tears of gratitude.

Of course, he was eying Ye Yuan’s pill refining strength.

Controlling such an alchemy genius in Vast Wind Assemble, in the future, after he corroborates his Dao as an Empyrean, it would also not be impossible for him to lead the Vast Wind Assemble and unify the land of extreme north.

Feng Tianyang’s ambition was extremely great, even stronger than his father’s.

In front of him, either submit or die!

It was also precisely because so that even when these Empyreans saw him, they were also all very wary.

It was a shame that he ran into Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan looked at Feng Tianyang and shook his head, laughing in spite of himself as he said, “A toad wanting to eat swan meat, overestimating your own ability! Just the likes of you are also fit to make me submit? Swaggering and blustering here, what you’re relying on are those Empyreans beside you, right?”

Feng Tianyang burst out laughing and said, “Kid, you think that because your Alchemy Dao is powerful, you can turn your nose up at other people? Alchemy Dao is ultimately a minor Dao. Martial Dao is the truly Great Dao that leads to heaven! Why would I, Feng Tianyang, rely on other people’s strength? Ji Qingyun, I know that you’re unconvinced, but you don’t need to goad me either, because you’re not qualified enough yet! Dealing with you, why would I need an Empyrean to take action? If you want to stand before me, beat them first before talking!”

Feng Tianyang waved his hand, seven to eight young men walked to the front of the crowd.

Immediately, a commotion broke out in the crowd.
