Chapter 2568: Arrival from Jadetrue

There were a total of three jade slips given by Cheng Chongshan.

Ye Yuan played with one of the jade slips and said with a smile, “Cheng Chongshan thought that I can’t access the jade slips. That’s why he would give them to me with peace of mind. It’s just a pity that he miscalculated! Although this restriction is powerful, as long as I comprehend a part of it, I’ll be able to pry into the mysteries!”

What Ye Yuan was thinking of was not to crack the restrictions at all but to comprehend these restrictions.

The difficulty of the two naturally could not be mentioned in the same breath.

The restrictions in the jade slips were extremely exquisite, far surpassing Ye Yuan’s current understanding.

Furthermore, he discovered that Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s restriction technique was vastly different from his own Formation Dao.

Noting many ingenious aspects, Ye Yuan never even thought of it before in the past.

These restrictions completely opened up another door for Ye Yuan. A new world unfolded before his eyes.

Only then did Ye Yuan know that he underestimated the heroes of the world!

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven was a world that was composed entirely of rules.

Everything here completely surpassed a plane like the Heavenspan World.

The more Ye Yuan studied these restrictions, the more he felt that they were unfathomable.

He had a feeling of being a skilled master who accidentally obtained a heavenly work of literature.

These restrictions were like nature itself as if they were there originally.

Suddenly, one day, the power of rule descended upon Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “I didn’t expect that my Alchemy Dao rule hasn’t reached grand completion yet, and then it’s my Formation Dao rule that reached grand completion first. This senior’s Formation Dao attainments are extremely insightful. He must have been an astonishingly talented major character when he was alive! It’s just a pity that he fell in Inklight Forest.”

Ye Yuan would never copy blindly when he gained enlightenment on Dao. He extracted the essence of these restrictions, removed the dregs, and integrated it into his own Formation Dao.

These few years, Ye Yuan’s Formation Dao attainments had advanced by leaps and bounds, and he already cultivated the first level of Formation Dao rule to the realm of grand completion.

Putting aside the contents inside these jade slips, just talking about this restriction, got to admit that Cheng Chongshan gave him a big gift.

Ye Yuan picked up a jade slip and proved his divine sense inside.

Information flooded into his mind.

“Poison Sutra!”

What was recorded inside this jade slip was actually the method of using poison.

Inside the jade slip, a variety of poisons and the methods were recorded. The poisons were very bizarre.

Even Ye Yuan this poison using expert also could not help but be lost in wonder.

“It turns out that the poison Cheng Chongshan was inflicted by is called Silent Rupture, which is very fitting. This poison, even Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses can’t block it! However, Cheng Chongshan probably doesn’t know that this poison wasn’t purged cleanly. It’s just incubating again. That’s all,” Ye Yuan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Not that Ye Yuan did it on purpose, but that his cultivation realm was indeed too low, and Cheng Chongshan was poisoned too deeply.

It was just that Ye Yuan did not have a need to tell him these.

He knew that Cheng Chongshan would still deal with him, just take it as leaving a card up his sleeves.

The other two pieces of jade slips also made Ye Yuan extremely excited.

One of the pieces recorded the medicinal properties and growth habits of thousands of heavenly medicines, as well as dozens of precious pill formulas and alchemy experiences.

A jade slip that was sealed up so solemnly, they were naturally not ordinary pill formulas.

Furthermore, this was merely the tip of the iceberg.

The portion that was hidden by the restrictions was the essence!

This jade slip was simply a precious treasure to Ye Yuan.

Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven’s alchemy path system was not of the same lineage as the Heavenspan World, but much more complex and massive.

Although Ye Yuan cultivated basic heavenly pills to the realm of grand completion, there was still a huge gap away from first level grand completion.

The heavenly pills that he cultivated were actually just in order to lay the foundation for the Jasper Regeneration Pill. It was a kind of cultivation.

But actually, how could basic heavenly pills be just 20 over kinds?

The burden was heavy and the path was long!

But this jade slip could give Ye Yuan immense reference value, and could save him a lot of detours.

As for the last jade slip, there were several cultivation methods and martial techniques recorded on it.

These three jade slips could be said to be three treasure vaults!

Most likely, they were the cultivation experiences and legacy of the ancient tomb’s master.

Cheng Chongshan gave it to him just like that.

Ye Yuan thought about it and decided to study the Poison Sutra first.

Cheng Chongshan definitely would not let him off easily. If he grasped the Poison Sutra, it could tend to achieve unexpected results.

Ye Yuan’s current strength was too weak. The Heavenspan Mountain could not see the light too. He naturally had to take extreme measures to protect himself.

He was the ancestor of using poison in the first place. He naturally would not be unfamiliar with this way. Learning it would naturally yield twice the results with half the effort.

However, the various poisons recorded in the Poison Sutra, as well as the methods and techniques of poisoning, they were incomparably miraculous. Ye Yuan benefited endlessly too.

… …

“Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao! I didn’t expect that the sect actually sent you here!”

Seeing the expert that the sect sent, Cheng Chongshan could not help being overjoyed.

Zhao Kun was among the top ten inner-sect’s disciples of the Jadetrue Heavenly Sect. His strength could virtually instantly kill Cheng Chongshan.

Furthermore, Zhao Kun’s most daunting aspect was his movement technique.

With him taking action, was he still scared of Ye Yuan running?

Zhao Kun gave a cold snort and said, “You actually can’t even take care of a Lesser Sublime Heavenly Stratum ascender! You’re really a piece of trash!”

In front of Zhao Kun, Cheng Chongshan put away all of his pride and said with a fawning smile, “What Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao says is right. It’s junior apprentice brother who is incompetent! It’s just that the boy is proficient in spatial rule, which is very troublesome. Of course, I also won’t trouble Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao to labor in vain. This is a little show of appreciation, Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao please accept it.”

Zhao Kun’s gaze turned sharp and he said in surprise, “Brightfall Feather Transforming Heavenly Pill!”

Cheng Chongshan smiled and said, “Precisely so! This younger brother found an ancient tomb in Eastward Country in recent years and occasionally had gains inside. This heavenly pill is to show filial respect for Senior Apprentice Brother.”

Zhao Kun’s two eyes narrowed and he said with a cold smile, “What you obtained shouldn’t be just one heavenly pill, right?”

Cheng Chongshan had an awkward look as he said, “Senior Apprentice Brother is smart. The treasures obtained this time, the most important ones should be the few pieces of jade slips! It’s just that … they are currently in Ye Yuan’s hands!”

Finished saying, Zhao Kun briefly recounted what had happened before.

Of course, out of his mouth, Ye Yuan naturally became the big villain, threatening with treating the poison, forcing him to hand over the jade slips.

After Zhao Kun heard, he snorted coldly and said, “What a useless trash! My Jadetrue Heavenly Sect’s face has been utterly lost by you!”

Cheng Chongshan was helpless and could only repeatedly say yes.

If not for being compelled against his will, he also would not have had the sect send someone over.

But since he came, the benefits that he obtained in the ancient tombs naturally had to be shared with the other party. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But borrowing Zhao Kun’s hands to get rid of Ye Yuan was also worth it.

“However, a mere ascender can actually resolve this kind of strange poison, he has quite the skill! Cheng Chongshan, want me to take action, can. But you have to take out another five Brightfall Feather Transforming Heavenly Pills, or equivalent heavenly pills. Additionally, I want those few jade slips too!” Zhao Kun said.

Cheng Chongshan grimaced and finally gritted his teeth and agreed.

In reality, he was delighted in his heart.

The gains in the ancient tomb this time far exceeded imagination!

Merely five heavenly pills, it was still within the scope that he could bear.

Of course, these could not be expressed. Instead, he had to feign a pained appearance.

“Lead the way. I want to see whether or not this ascender has supernatural powers!” Zhao Kun said coolly.
