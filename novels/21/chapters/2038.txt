Chapter 2042: Alchemy Intent Resonance

“Hiss ... this is Alchemy God? Rank seven divine pill, vast spirit divine-grade, truly terrifying strength!”

“It’s both vast spirit divine pills, could it be a tie?”

“In my view, it’s still Empyrean Pilljade who’s a level higher! After all, he’s a veteran Ancestor Realm powerhouse!”

...

Both people being vast spirit divine pills immediately caused a wave of marveling.

To be able to refine a level nine difficulty rank seven divine pill to vast spirit divine-grade, the might of Ancestor Realm could be seen at a glance.

When pills reached rank seven, the difficulty and complexity would soar.

Hence, these two great Ancestor Realm powerhouses also used three days and three night’s time before they finished refining the Heavenly Center Nine Lives Pill.

As for who won and who lost, everyone debated without ceasing.

Although the two people were evenly-matched in strength, Empyrean Pilljade’s accumulation was clearly a little thicker. Hence, more people felt that Empyrean Pilljade would win.

Empyrean Pilljade stood with his hands behind his back and looked at Empyrean Flutterfeather with a proud look as he said, “You breaking through to the Ancestor Realm indeed surprised this Empyrean greatly. However ... you’re still a little too inexperienced in the end! This match, you lost for sure!”

Empyrean Realm Flutterfeather smiled faintly and said, “You’ve been in this position of alliance chief for too many years and have long already lost your former edge. How fired up with boundless enthusiasm was the Empyrean Pilljade back then? Hacking your way through all obstacles along the way, defeating countless geniuses, stepping into Alliance Chief. It’s just a pity that he who sits too high to be touched for too long. You’re already afraid of being challenging and afraid of failure. Hence, you’re destined to lose!”

Empyrean Pilljade gave a cold snort and said disdainfully, “What a joke! This Empyrean has entered the Ancestor Realm for as long as 100 thousand years already, standing right at the absolute summit and viewing how small the mountains are! Why would I be scared of failure? Would I be afraid of challenges? Because no one can make me fail at all!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather said with a faint smile, “Is that so? How’s the result, five fellow daoists?”

At this time, the expressions of the five great holy lands’ masters were very odd.

Seeing Empyrean Flutterfeather inquired, Empyrean Blazing Sun let out a slight sigh and said, “The two of your medicinal pills’ qualities are extremely high, being rarely seen in the world! It’s just that ... Brother Flutterfeather’s medicinal pill is still a notch better!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Empyrean Pilljade’s face changed drastically. His two eyes glared and he said in a fierce voice, “Impossible! He merely just entered the Ancestor Realm, how can he possibly win me?”

Empyrean Luoshui also sighed lightly and said, “Brother Pilljade, the quality of your medicinal pill is indeed extremely high, but Younger Brother Flutterfeather’s medicinal pill already approaches end spirit divine-grade! In terms of quality, it wins by that slight trace!”

The other three people also ruled unanimously.

After all, the quality of medicinal pills was clear at a glance. It was also impossible for them to resort to deception in broad daylight.

Empyrean Pilljade had a face full of disbelief. Rushing in front of the two medicinal bottles with a lunge, his divine sense sank inside swiftly.

With this probing, his face could not help changing greatly.

Empyrean Flutterfeather’s medicinal pill was really that tiny hint better than his.

Although it was just a tiny bit, he ultimately lost.

“How is it possible? How is this even possible?” Empyrean Pilljade had a battered out of his senses look, clearly not believing this result.

And some alchemists that worshiped him as God similarly did not dare to believe it.

“Lord Pilljade ... actually really lost?”

“How can this be? Even if Empyrean Flutterfeather broke through to the Ancestor Realm, he’s also 100 thousand years later than Lord Pilljade. So how can he possibly win just like that?”

“Sigh, the end of an era!”

...

Yes, an era was over just like this!

The era belonging to Empyrean Pilljade already ended. Empyrean Flutterfeather’s era was currently arriving.

Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled faintly and said, “Why does Brother Pilljade think that this Empyrean would hand this grandmaster token to Younger Brother Ye Yuan? Could it be that it’s merely appreciating his talent?”

The moment these words came out, everyone’s gazes all gathered on Ye Yuan, full of stunned looks.

No one would have thought that at this time, Empyrean Flutterfeather would actually bring up Ye Yuan. Could it be that the key figure that influenced this battle of the century was actually Ye Yuan?

Empyrean Pilljade’s entire body trembled and could not refrain from looking towards Ye Yuan once more, full of astonishment.

Empyrean Realm Flutterfeather continued to say slowly, “Back then, when this Empyrean fought with Ye Yuan, it could be said as encountering a rare bosom friend who can appreciate me, and this actually produced the effect of conjugal harmony. With the two of our powers, we each refined an end spirit divine pill! It’s also because of this that this Empyrean finally took this last step, achieving Ancestor Realm.”

Empyrean Pilljade’s pupils constricted, his eyes full of aghast as he said in disbelief, “Alchemy intent resonance!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled slightly as he said with a nod, “That’s right, it’s precisely alchemy intent resonance! Therefore, you know why you lost, right?”

“Alchemy intent resonance? What’s that?”

“Yeah, never heard of it before!”

“But it sounds very impressive.”

...

The vast majority of the alchemists in the plaza were very perplexed because they had never heard of this term before.

Only those experienced Seven-star Alchemy Gods radiated brilliant light from their eyes, showing strong yearning.

Empyrean Luoshui sighed lightly and explained, “The so-called alchemy intent resonance is referring to when two people are evenly-matched in an alchemy battle, and reach a kind of wondrous resonance state. Under this state, the two people’s thoughts and feelings about Alchemy Dao will far surpass their own strength, unleashing double, or even several times the power from there. It’s just that this kind of state is too rarely-seen, so it’s not commonly known by people.”

When saying this, Empyrean Luoshui also had an enraptured expression on his face.

Even for Ye Yuan, it was also his first time hearing of alchemy intent resonance this sort of thing.

The others all revealed astonished faces, feeling that it was incredulous.

Alchemy battle was a mutual suppression process. The medicinal pills refined tend to not be their peak standard.

But Ye Yuan and Empyrean Flutterfeather actually helped each other achieve their aim, each out-performing themselves, even each breaking through their realms. It was truly incomparably miraculous.

This time, everyone finally understood why Empyrean Flutterfeather would hand the grandmaster token to Ye Yuan.

He had confidence in Ye Yuan, and it was also because in order to thank Ye Yuan.

Empyrean Pilljade’s expression flickered incessantly. He guarded against Empyrean Flutterfeather in every way but did not expect that Ye Yuan, this kind of variable, appeared.

Alchemy intent resonance!

This was a state that was extremely hard to appear. It was the same as having a sudden epiphany.

Empyrean Flutterfeather kept that alchemy intent resonance firmly in mind. When the dual dragons reappeared, that was how he defeated him, this veteran Ancestor Realm.

“Brother Pilljade indeed has an awe-inspiring view from a high place, but you don’t view how small the mountains are. You’re afraid of other people rising up, worried that you’ll have a powerful opponent. But the more you’re like this, the faster you’ll lose,” Empyrean Flutterfeather said coolly.

Empyrean Pilljade snorted coldly and said furiously, “It’s not up to you to lecture this Empyrean! This time, this Empyrean admits to his bad luck! The next Cloudpill Summit, this Empyrean will claim it back with interest!”

Empyrean Flutterfeather smiled when he heard that and said, “Brother Pilljade’s words are not correct. The next session won’t be the Cloudpill Summit, but it is the Lustrous Gold Summit!”

Empyrean Pilljade could not help choking when he heard that. Snorting coldly, he flicked his sleeves and left.

Everyone exchanged glances. No one would have thought that an opening performance would actually wind up in such a manner.

This way, the Cloudpill Summit’s main act actually concluded in advance.

However, to the alchemists in the plaza, their time was just starting.
