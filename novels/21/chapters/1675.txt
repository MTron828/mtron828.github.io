After the two people went out of the boundary of Southfoot Town, they directly entered the Purple Extreme Hall and sped like the wind toward the incoming road.

After several days, the Purple Extreme Hall came to a canyon.

Suddenly, the Purple Extreme Hall seemed to have been caught in a quagmire and was actually unable to advance an inch further.

“Your Excellency, what’s going on?” Ning Tianping said in surprise.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said, “Looks like there are some small tails that weren’t cleaned up and came to look for abuse again. Come, let’s go out and take a look.”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The moment the two people just revealed their figures, over a dozen sharp arrows tore through the air and interwoven to form a dense network of arrows.

Ning Tianping’s expression changed and he cried out, “Careful, Your Excellency!”

Normally, they were naturally able to dodge these sharp arrows.

But currently, they were similarly caught in the quagmire, their figures being greatly restricted.

Ye Yuan discovered that even his spatial laws were actually unable to work well!

Clearly, they were caught in a powerful array formation.

What was fatal was that after these sharp arrows entered the array formation, they would not slow down like the trapped people, but they accelerated instead!

The timing was grasped perfectly, not giving even any chance to enter the Purple Extreme Hall once more.

At the critical moment, Ye Yuan suddenly gave a loud roar.

Golden light burst out on his body, the faint blue patterns seemingly came to live, wandering around on Ye Yuan’s body.

At this moment, Ye Yuan felt like his body was filled with strength.

The furious dragon roar surged straight to the sky!

The Voice of the Dragon God that had not been seen for a long time!

By the side, Ning Tianping looked at this scene in immense shock.

He completely had no idea that His Excellency actually still had such a trump card.

The horrifying sound wave spread out. Those dozen over sharp arrows were directly shattered into smithereens.

Regarding the Voice of the Dragon God’s power, Ye Yuan also did not expect that it would be so powerful.

Those arrows were obviously specially made and were already peak celestial deity artifacts, with the quality being extremely hard.

Furthermore, array formations were enchanted on the arrows. They could traverse freely and not be affected by this large formation.

Ye Yuan originally only wanted to change the trajectory of the arrows through the Voice of the Dragon God. He did not expect that they actually directly shattered.

A roar shattered celestial deity artifacts. How powerful was this Voice of the Dragon God’s might?

Ye Yuan was wildly elated in his heart. He knew that it must be because of those blue patterns.

Avoiding this wave of certain-kill assault, Ning Tianping was already drenched in sweat all over his body.

He knew that he already circled one round around the gates of hell and back.

If not for Ye Yuan, he would already be shot into a sieve now.

Outside the large formation, a group of people appeared on the hillside.

Xiang Yunfei bellowed, “Boss He, you bragged to me how powerful your Wind Breaking Arrows were every day. This is how powerful it is? One roar from that punk caused all your arrows to shatter! All shattered! I gave you guys all of my assets. Now, you give this kind of result to repay me?”

They were outside the large formation and could not feel the power of Ye Yuan’s Voice of the Dragon God at all.

Therefore, Xiang Yunfei felt that this Boss He’s Wind Breaking Arrows were only the latter’s brag. The power simply did not cut it.

Boss He was a very powerful bandit in a gang in the vicinity of Riverluck Capital City.

Of course, they were also a group of notorious bandits.

They came and went without traces, frequently highway-robbing some passing merchants and experts. The powerhouses who died in their hands were too many to enumerate.

It was said that they had even killed before a seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse!

This group of people, their strengths were not even beneath the three major forces.

Xiang Yunfei had wide connections. He expended considerable effort and finally contacted this group of bandits.

He handed all of his assets to the boss, He Tianxiang, inviting them to make a move to intercept and kill Ye Yuan.

Of course, his bit of assets, Boss He thought little of it.

But when Xiang Yunfei told Boss He the news that Ye Yuan had the Purple Extreme Hall, he was moved.

This kind of spatial flying-type mystic treasure, furthermore, it was at least a celestial deity mystic treasure existence, there was no way they would not be moved.

Therefore, this group of people followed closely behind Ye Yuan, arrived in the vicinity of the Heavenspan Mountain, and lay in ambush in this canyon.

This canyon was a road that must be passed through back to Riverluck Capital City. If Ye Yuan wanted to return, he would definitely go through from here.

Actually, the strength of Boss He, this group of bandits, was not strong. What they were truly powerful in was this array formation and the Wind Breaking Arrow.

This array formation was a powerful peak Divine Dao rank four array formation. Even if late-stage Divine Lord Realm powerhouses get caught inside, it would be very hard to get away too.

They had indeed killed before a seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse. It was by relying on this Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation!

Xiang Yunfei also took fancy on precisely Boss He’s grand array. That was why he would come and find Boss He to take action.

He did not expect that this certain-kill attack was actually shattered by Ye Yuan, how could he not be furious?

Boss He shot Xiang Yunfei a cold glance and said, “Xiang Yunfei, you dare to roar at your father? Do you think that you’re still a fifth-layered heaven Divine Lord powerhouse?”

Xiang Yunfei’s expression changed, his anger immediately reducing considerably, but he still said furiously, “You screwed things up. I’ll see what you do now!”

Boss He’s brows were tightly locked as he said with a cold snort, “This Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation coupled with the Wind Breaking Arrow, unless one’s strength reached eighth-layered heaven Divine Lord, otherwise, it’s absolutely impossible to resolve it! Do you think that his roar earlier was that simple? Your father’s Wind Breaking Arrow, each one is a peak celestial deity artifact. It’s entire body was forged with Thousandfall Profound Ice Metal! More than ten being released in a volley, even an immortal will find it hard to block! This kid is very troublesome!”

Xiang Yunfei gradually calmed down and discovered that it seemed like he really simplified things.

Peak celestial deity artifact, even if it was him at his prime, wanting to shatter one bare-handedly was extremely difficult, let alone more than ten.

But Ye Yuan actually shattered more than ten with a shout. This roar naturally would not be so simple.

“What to do now then?” Xiang Yunfei said with a grim expression.

Boss He said, “Relax! His bit of strength can’t break the Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation at all! This grand array is very powerful and even has the effect of devouring divine essence. Didn’t you say that he doesn’t have much divine essence stones on hand anymore? I’ll see when he can hold out until! Getting caught in the Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation, he’ll be hard-pressed to escape even if he grew wings!”

Hearing this, Xiang Yunfei revealed a look of great joy.

“Xiang Yunfei, you’re very good! Since you found helpers to come and ambush this Ye, then be prepared to suffer this Ye’s wrath!”

Right at this time, Ye Yuan’s voice was transmitted out of the grand array.

Xiang Yunfei’s expression changed. He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually directly guessed that it was him.

However, at the thought that Ye Yuan was caught in the grand array, he immediately felt much more relieved. He smiled coldly and said, “Brat, this Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation, even a seventh-layered heaven Divine Lord is unable to break free when trapped inside! I want to see what your wrath is! Want to use divine lord mystic treasures to detonate again? I want to see how many divine lord mystic treasures you have!”

When Boss He heard that, he also smiled coldly and said, “Kid, getting caught in the Chaos Element Profound Water Deity Trapping Formation, you just wait to die with peace of mind! Your spatial laws are too weak and can’t crack this array formation at all.”

“Is that so? Then ... I’ll let you take a look at this young master’s wrath right now!”

Ye Yuan’s voice transmitted over faintly.
