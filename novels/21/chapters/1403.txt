Chapter 1407 The City Lord“s Attitude

“It’s indeed still Yong Dang Capital City’s foundation that is deep! Their might is not just because of Bi Tianzhou alone, but it is their overall strength being powerful.”

“For Wu Meng Capital City to want to surpass them, the difficulty is likely quite high.”

“No idea how many people Ye Yuan killed either, and just how many spirit medicines he has in his hands.”

...

Everyone was very curious about just how many spirit medicines Ye Yuan had on hand.

According to the ratio of 5-to-1, Ye Yuan needed to reach at least 10 thousand stalks of spirit medicines and above to have a possibility of winning.

This figure was unimaginable in the past Hundred Cities Smelting Trials.

After Ye Yuan obtained the storage rings, he would transfer the other people’s spirit medicines all into his own storage ring.

Hence, nobody knew just how many spirit medicines he acquired either.

Right then, Xuan Ling slowly opened his mouth.

“Outer-court’s first place, Wu Meng Capital City’s Ye Yuan, obtained a total of ... 21,300 stalks of Tier 1 spirit medicines!”

The moment Xuan Ling’s voice faded, the entire plaza burst into an uproar all at once.

According to the ratio of 5-to-1, the spirit medicines that Ye Yuan alone obtained, surpassed Yong Dang Capital City’s by one-fold!

“Just how many people did this guy kill?!”

“Didn’t expect it! I really didn’t expect it! Wu Meng Capital City actually produced such a freak!”

“So strong at late-stage Grotto Profound already. When he breaks through to the Heaven Glimpse Realm, what would it be like?”

“Before the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time, probably nobody would have thought that Wu Meng Capital City could obtain first place, right?”

...

They all did not know that Ye Yuan killed a total of 2000 people in these last three months!

Even if each person only had ten stalks of spirit medicines in their hands, adding it up also had 20 thousand in number. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

With Ye Yuan’s sword maneuvering flight plus the extensiveness of Dustless’s divine sense, he was simply ever-victorious under this kind of situation.

Even if you hid any more covertly, as long as you entered Dustless’s detection range, it could not escape a death word.

Xuan Ling waved a hand, three streaks of light flew out.

Two of them flew toward Ye Yuan, the other flew toward Bi Tianzhou.

“These are your rewards!” Xuan Ling said coolly.

In front of Ye Yuan were two jade boxes. One of them was a little smaller, the other slightly narrower.

Clearly, the smaller one was that Four-star divine pill, while the narrower one was naturally the Weeping Spirit Fruit.

About the function of this Weeping Spirit Fruit, Ye Yuan had heard Dustless say before too, it was indeed good stuff.

This Weeping Spirit Fruit was a heaven and earth spiritual item, containing massive spiritual energy inside. It was even much stronger than ordinary medicinal pills.

Consuming a Weeping Spirit Fruit was equivalent to a hundred years of bitter cultivation!

Ten Weeping Spirit Fruits could let Ye Yuan break through to grand completion Grotto Profound no matter what.

Ye Yuan put away the two items and said to Xuan Ling with clasped hands, “Thank you, Lord Xuan Ling!”

Xuan Ling gave Ye Yuan a deeply profound glance and said with a smile, “That’s what you all deserve! Ye Yuan, you’re very good. When you leave the capital city in the future, you can come to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City to find me.”

Xuan Ling’s words made everyone’s expression turn austere.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, that was the administrator of Wu Meng Capital City!

Its might was simply what they all could not imagine.

To these students, their lifelong wish was to enter Heavenly Eagle Imperial City.

In their mind, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City was a holyland-like existence.

These Hundred Cities Smelting Trial had been held for no idea how many times, but Lord Xuan Ling had never said such words before.

But this time, he made an exception and opened his mouth!

This showed that he really had the appreciation of a talent stirred.

At this time, all the students used extremely envious gazes to look at Ye Yuan.

Even Bi Tianzhou’s gaze also had an additional trace of weird look.

“Alright, the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial this time ends here. You all go back then!”

Xuan Ling finished talking, kneading seals with both hands. The hundreds of altars activated at the same time. Everyone’s figures disappeared from the mystic realm.

...

After the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, the news of Wu Meng Capital City seizing first place spread throughout the entire Wu Meng Capital City very quickly like the wind.

Wu Meng Capital City’s strength had always been unremarkable among these hundred cities.

Not considered very weak but also absolutely not considered strong.

Hundred cities’ first place, this sort of thing, had never been related to Wu Meng Capital City.

But this time, Wu Meng Capital City actually overpowered Yong Dang Capital City, becoming the hundred cities’ first place.

This news was too exciting.

“Ye Yuan is really too awesome! He sent Wu Meng Capital City up to the throne of first place with his power alone!”

“Still remember when he just entered the academy back then, everybody still thought that his strength was weak. Didn’t expect that just ten years or so passed, he already soared to the sky with one bound.”

“He even defeated Jin Yu. In Grotto Profound Deity Realm, he no longer has any opponents, right?”

...

Within the academy, there were people praising Ye Yuan everywhere.

Back then, even though Ye Yuan defeating Qin Shao was astonishing, that was just Wu Meng Academy’s internal affairs.

But now, it was different. Ye Yuan obtained first place in the Hundred Cities Smelting Trial, completely with a sweeping attitude.

In the City Lord Manor, a middle-aged man with a dignified appearance sat in the hall.

In front of him was the academy head, Wen Yiyang, and Thundercry.

Thundercry bowed his body, recounting the incident of Qin Yuanlong assassinating Ye Yuan, saying indignantly, “City Lord, the Qin Family is simply too much! No matter what grievances they have with Ye Yuan, using this sort of method to deal with a Grotto Profound Realm student seriously makes people despise!”

Actually, the enmity between the Qin Family and Ye Yuan, everyone was aware of right and wrong.

The Qin Family was used to being overbearing. They could not stomach the smallest bit of offense.

Wu Meng City Lord said coolly, “Wen Yiyang, what do you think?”

Wen Yiyang clasped his hands and said, “City Lord, Ye Yuan is a genius hard to come by in 100 thousand years. His significance to our Wu Meng Capital City is self-evident! The Qin Family was indeed a little too much this time.”

Wen Yiyang as the academy head, for such a genius to be able to be produced under him, he naturally cherished Ye Yuan immensely.

The Qin Family’s actions had already touched his bottom line.

Wu Meng City Lord fell into a long silence. Wen Yiyang and Thundercry did not dare to say anymore. The two people exchanged a glance, both seeing the puzzlement in the other party’s eyes.

This matter was too obvious, it did not seem to need additional considerations, right?

If a lesson was not taught to the Qin Family with even this incident, they would be even more reckless and unscrupulous in the future.

Only after a long time did Wu Meng City Lord slowly say, “The Qin Family’s action was not appropriate, but since Qin Yuanlong has already turned his back on the Qin Family and was killed by Thundercry, this matter is already settled. The City Lord Manor has no excuse to find trouble with the Qin Family again as well. The Qin Family is Wu Meng Capital City’s senior family clan and has performed outstanding contributions for Wu Meng Capital City before. We mustn’t easily jump the gun. This matter ends here! This seat will warn the Qin Family and let them pay attention to it. This time, Ye Yuan performed notable merits for the capital city and even won for this seat the Four-star Awakening Divine Pill. You guys give Ye Yuan a good reward.”

Wen Yiyang was shocked inwardly, not expecting that City Lord, His Excellency, brushed his matter over so casually.

City Lord’s meaning was to reduce a big trouble into a small one, and a small one into nothing.

Although the Qin Family was deeply entrenched in Wu Meng Capital City, City Lord did not need to be so fearful either, right?

Handling it like this was naturally nothing to Wen Yiyang. But he was worried that Ye Yuan would have some opinions because of this!
