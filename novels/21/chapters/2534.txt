Chapter 2540: He . . . Already Came By!

Late at night, it was silent in the palace. There were only the sounds of some patrolling footsteps and the chirping of insects and birds.

But in reality, tonight’s Eternal Longevity Palace was loosely guarded outside, but heavily guarded inside.

Outside Second Prince’s bedroom palace, there were several upper Lesser Sublime Heaven powerhouses patrolling back and forth.

As for middle Lesser Sublime Heaven powerhouses, that went even more without saying.

The entire Eternal Longevity Palace was virtually in a state of heightened nervousness!

In the four corners of the bedroom palace, four grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven powerhouses were standing with sabers.

Once there was any rustling of leaves in the wind, they would definitely rush forth and kill people right away!

Of course, these were all not the important thing.

Lu Yun who was in the side room was Second Prince’s greatest reliance!

He did not believe that someone could appear under Master Yun’s eyelids!

Tonight’s Second Prince was naturally sleepless the entire night.

He sat on his bed just like that, gaze flickered indeterminately, also no idea what he was thinking about.

“Why don’t Your Highness rest earlier? Even Master Yun has taken action, that scoundrel definitely won’t dare to come!” Second Prince’s personal eunuch could not refrain from persuading when he saw his extremely worried countenance.

Second Prince was a little annoyed and waved his hand and said, “You withdraw. Let me have some silence!”

The eunuch was helpless and could only shake his head and leave.

Second Prince looked outside the house, with a constant feeling of uneasiness.

“Damn it! Master Yun is clearly next door. What the hell am I scared of? Could it be that that brat can really access heaven and penetrate the earth?” Second Prince gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

“Not to the extent of accessing heaven and penetrating the earth, but entering the royal palace isn’t a difficult thing for me. Of course, killing you … is even easier. Don’t move! Otherwise, you’re dead!”

Right at this time, a voice seemed to come out of the deepest area, burrowing into his ears.

Second Prince’s expression changed wildly and he was just about to get up, but immediately turned stiff there.

All the hair on his body stood up.

Who could this voice be if not Ye Yuan’s?

A figure appeared, currently looking at him, smiling meaningfully.

Who could this person be if not Ye Yuan?

Second Prince’s heart shook wildly. He suddenly looked towards the four grand completion Lesser Sublime Heaven guards in the house and discovered that they were actually completely oblivious!

This … How was this possible?

It was not just these four people. Even Master Yun who was next door did not have any reaction either!

There were already no words that could describe the shock in his heart at this time!

Ye Yuan was clearly standing in front of them. Could it be that they were all blind?

“H-How did you come in?” Second Prince said in horror.

He wanted to speak up to attract the attention of others.

However, there was still no reaction!

How was this possible?

Ye Yuan looked at him and said with a smile, “Of course I swaggered in just like that! Don’t count on them. They can’t see me, and they also can’t see you right now!?Uh,?also, that old man next door, I’ve met him too. But it seems like he didn’t notice me at all.”

Shock!

Fear!

Disbelief!

Second Prince also did not know what was his frame of mind now.

All in all, his entire person was in a mess!

This person was clearly standing in front of him, but the others treated him like he was air!

Suddenly, his pupils constricted and he cried out in surprise, “S-Spatial rule!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “That’s right. Spatial rule! This move is called void concealment. As long as I don’t actively release my aura, they won’t discover me! Also, you’re currently in the void concealment too. So they can’t hear our conversation. I advise that you don’t release your aura. Otherwise, you’ll be dead.”

Second Prince was just thinking of taking the initiative to release his aura when he was throttled by Ye Yuan’s one sentence.

He did not dare to move!

Ye Yuan said coolly, “I came just to tell you how strong my spatial rule is! You can go and deal with the Tang Family and can also send someone to kill me. But you have to be prepared to die in the palace at any time!”

Second Prince’s expression flickered indeterminately, Ye Yuan’s threat was like a blade pressed against his neck.

This person was too dangerous!

“This matter, I hope that you don’t make it public too! Otherwise, I may very well do something.?Oh,?right, our bet should be that I won. Remember to send someone to deliver the heavenly medicines to the Tang Family tomorrow. Alright, I’m leaving. You can call someone now.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s figure gradually disappeared.

The moment Ye Yuan left, Second Prince suddenly gasped heavily for air, only then, discovering that his back was already drenched.

Just this short few breaths of time, the pressure that Ye Yuan put on him was too great!

Only at this time did the four guards notice his peculiarity. They hurriedly ran over. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What’s wrong with you, Second Prince?” A guard supported him and asked.

And at this moment, the door of the side-room was quickly pushed open and Lu Yun swept over like a gust of wind.

He looked at Second Prince and asked with a frown, “What’s wrong?”

Second Prince gave Lu Yun a glance and said with a bitter smile, “He … already came by!”

The expressions of Lu Yun and the four guards changed wildly, virtually saying in unison, “Impossible!”

A guard said, “Nobody appeared within the bedroom palace at all. How can he possibly come in?”

Lu Yun also said, “Even if that brat can hide from everyone’s eyes and ears, it’s also impossible to hide from this old man!”

Second Prince smiled bitterly and said, “It’s … spatial rule! He was standing here talking to me just now. When I spoke, you all couldn’t hear me at all, and you also couldn’t see him! Master Yun, he even said that he already strolled around in the side-room!”

Lu Yun’s expression changed wildly, monstrous waves setting off in his heart.

A middle Lesser Sublime Heaven sauntered about in front of him and he actually did not have any reaction?

How was this possible?

But it was impossible for Second Prince’s expression to hide from him.

Furthermore, he also did not have the need to do this kind of lame thing.

Could it be that that brat really came in before?

“Spatial rule! What kind of spatial rule can actually hide from this old man’s eyes and ears!” Lu Yun’s heart burned with wrath.

He had a feeling of being toyed by someone.

There was actually someone who dared to make fun of him in this Eastward Country!

“Master Yun, this prince seems to have provoked an incredible fellow! Forget it, I concede! Tomorrow, I’ll bring the heavenly medicines and pay a visit in person to apologize for my offense!” Second Prince said helplessly.

Just now, he really felt that he had made a trip to the gates of hell and back.

He could be said to have laid down an all-encompassing net in this Eternal Longevity Palace!

Inside three layers and outside three layers were all guards!

But Ye Yuan actually sneaked in front of him without a sound.

This kind of thing was really too terrifying.

Lu Yun’s gaze flickered indeterminately, and he said, “Okay, I’ll accompany you tomorrow! This old man wants to see what kind of brat can actually be so unbridled in front of this old man!”

… …

Tang Family, the lights were bright.

Tonight concerned the life and death of everyone in the Tang Family!

In the study, came Tang Jinhua’s low and cold shouting.

“Tang Yu, you wicked son! Look what you’ve done! Tell me, why did you sink the Tang Family into fire and water?” Tang Jinhua said in anger.

He did not understand, his son was normally extremely clever.

But why did he actually make such a big mistake in this matter!

Tang Yu seemed very calm and said, “Father, I don’t have assurance either, but, I can only gamble!”
