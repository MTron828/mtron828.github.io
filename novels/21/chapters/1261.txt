Chapter 1265: World Tree

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Qing, can you feel the aura of the Kunwu Divine Wood?”

“Mmm, there’s a very strong wood-spirit energy ahead. I feel like ... that being seems to be guiding us forward.”

Ye Yuan was stunned when he heard that: “Guiding us forward?”

Ye Qing nodded his head: “To be able to release such terrifying wood-spirit energy, that being is too strong. It’s completely not what we’re capable of surmising. I think he should have discovered us long ago, and even ... already knew our objective of this trip. Because apart from the Kunwu Divine Wood in this place, I can’t sense the auras of any other existences.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and did not reveal a surprised expression.

The existences in this God-forbidden region were all what they were unable to imagine.

Just talking about that Deathsoul Tree, Ye Yuan could not even move a finger in front of him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Qing was the most sensitive towards wood-spirit energy. Hence, that was why he had Ye Qing lead the way.

Sure enough, before long, Ye Qing detected a powerful wood-spirit energy.

“Big Brother, I wonder whether the Kunwu Divine Wood taking the initiative to expose itself is a fiend or foe!” White Light said.

Ye Yuan said with a smile, “Whether friend or foe, we have to make this trip.”

...

Under Ye Qing’s lead, the party arrived under a mountain peak very soon.

Above the mountaintop, an enormous tree towered above the clouds.

That tree trunk was seemingly a heaven-supporting pillar. Even a thousand people might not be able to wrap around it either.

The thick life force made Ye Yuan and the others who were far away at the foot of the mountain feel completely relaxed and refreshed in spirit.

“Is this the Kunwu Divine Wood? What a terrifying existence!” White Light exclaimed with a sigh.

“Rumor has it that the Kunwu Divine Wood is the source of the Divine Realm’s wood-spirit energy. It can be called the World Tree and is a part of Heavenly Dao laws. This Dao Defying Pill’s pill formula that I created was originally just a fleeting and ephemeral hint of enlightenment. But now, I’m already certain that I’m adding the finishing touch to Heavenly Dao, remaking Divine Dao within my body!” Ye Yuan’s gaze radiated rays of brilliant light as he said brimming with confidence.

Ye Yuan’s words made everyone endlessly shock, especially Shi Potian. Shi Potian had experienced the Divine Dao Era before and understood Heavenly Dao’s intangibleness more than Dao Profound Realm martial artists.

But Ye Yuan actually wanted to attempt to reforge Heavenly Dao within his body!

This kind of thinking was too conceited! Too arrogant! Too insane! Too unthinkable!

But thinking carefully, they all could not help praising the brilliant idea of Ye Yuan!

Cultivating by following the routine, no one could break this Heavenly Dao’s rules at all.

This point was already proven for over 100 thousand years.

Someone as powerful as Fang Tian was also unable to break this shackle.

But, if one simulated Heavenly Dao using Alchemy Dao, remaking a Divine Dao law within the martial artist’s body, this was indeed a fantastic idea.

“Haha, a fine reforging of Divine Dao! Well-deserving of being Immortal Grove Empyrean’s successor! This kind of inconceivable thinking simply takes people’s breath away in wonder!”

A voice suddenly sounded out, giving everyone a fright.

Suddenly, Ye Yuan’s and the rest only felt a blur before their eyes. Their figures already involuntarily disappeared from where they stood.

When they appeared again, they were already on top of the mountain peak, at the foot of the large tree.

A young man was currently looking at them with a wide grin. That gaze was rather ruminating.

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he asked probingly, “Could your esteemed self be ... the Kunwu Divine Wood?”

The young man sized Ye Yuan up, seemingly very interested in him.

Hearing Ye Yuan asked this, the young man said with a smile, “You’re pretty good! Worthy of being Old Fart Immortal Grove’s successor! This idea of yours sounds crazy, but in fact, it’s the method that’s most likely to break Heavenly Dao shackles!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes lit up when he heard that and said, “Senior also feels that this method can work?”

“Of course! Heavenly Dao collapsed, Divine Dao dwindled to zero. No matter what method is used, it also can’t resist the decline of Heavenly Dao. But the spirit medicines that have experienced the Divine Dao Era before contains a part of Heavenly Dao. They are unable to independently resist the decline of Heavenly Dao. But if consolidating them together, there’s a possibility of constructing an independent Heavenly Dao within the martial artist’s body, breaking this shackle from there! One has to admit that this idea is very genius!” the young man said with an emotional sigh.

Hearing the other party’s words, Ye Yuan felt extremely excited.

Following his understanding of the Divine Realm becoming increasingly deeper, Ye Yuan also had more confidence in the feasibility of the Dao Defying Pill.

Since Heavenly Dao was already gone, then he would just remake Heavenly Dao!

A Heavenly Dao that belonged to him, one that only existed in his body!

This train of thought was increasingly clear.

This idea seemed to be very insane, but to Ye Yuan, it was not impossible to actualize it!

The Heavenly Dao that Ye Yuan needed to construct was not a complete Heavenly Dao.

He was just going to construct an initial-stage Grotto Profound Deity Realm’s Heavenly Dao, letting him be able to break through to Deity Realm successfully!

Previous life, this idea was still very vague. But by relying on his exceedingly high comprehensions in Alchemy Dao, he faintly sensed this existence.

One million years old spirit medicines did not just have these nine types. But these nine kinds of spirit medicines that Ye Yuan selected secretly contained Heavenly Dao.

This was the nine kinds of spirit medicines that Ye Yuan selected only after going through repeated research.

Talking about it was kind of vague and insubstantial, but by relying on his comprehension toward Alchemy Dao, Ye Yuan felt that these spirit medicines combining together would be able to achieve an unexpected effect.

In this life, Ye Yuan’s comprehension of Heavenly Dao became increasingly profound. Coupled with his understanding of the Medicine God’s Soul Canon getting increasingly deeper, Ye Yuan’s train of thoughts also became clearer and clearer.

As for how to refine, he was even more certain in his heart as well.

Therefore, that was why he wanted to enter the Godsfall Mountain Range and search for this last spirit medicine: the Kunwu Flower.

“Then Senior’s meaning is ... the Dao Defying Pill can really help this Ye break through to the Deity Realm?” Ye Yuan could not refrain from asking.

The young man smiled and said, “Huhu, I didn’t say that! Whether or not you can break through, it will depend on your good fortune. This kind of thing, even if Old Fart Immortal Grove personally comes around, he also would not dare to say that it can 100% succeed. I can only say that there’s a possibility!”

Ye Yuan’s entire body trembled. The young man’s words undoubtedly boosted him much confidence.

This one before his eyes was an existence that rode above Deity Realm.

For him to say that it was possible was already extremely hard to come by.

In these 100 thousand years, no idea how many people had once attempted to break through to Deity Realm before. But they all failed without exception.

“Since that’s the case, pardon this junior for being impetuous, but I wonder if Senior can gift a Kunwu Flower.” Ye Yuan said with clasped hands.

The young man froze and suddenly burst into laughter and said, “Interesting! Really interesting! Brat, your guts ... are really not small!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Not that Junior is gutsy, but that Junior is already driven to the wall! The Kunwu Flower might be very important to Senior. But to Junior, to the Divine Realm, it’s even more important! I think that since Senior is willing to show yourself and meet up, you don’t wish for the Divine Realm to fall utterly into enemy hands, right?”

From the Kunwu Divine Wood’s attitude, Ye Yuan concluded that the other part at least did not much hostility towards him.

Otherwise, he would not talk so much rubbish.

“Heh, you, brat, are really quite interesting. No wonder Old Fart Immortal Grove picked you!”

As the young man said, he held a palm up. A pink flower appeared in his hand.
