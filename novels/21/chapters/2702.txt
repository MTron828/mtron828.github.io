Chapter 2708: Chaos True Spirit Bloodline!

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a phantom true dragon emerged with a roar.

Ye Yuan suddenly attacked!

His target was the weakest one of the nine great true spirits, the Green-eyed Civet Cat.

He wanted to open up a gap in this group of true spirits!

When the Green-eyed Civet Cat saw this sword, his expression changed drastically, and he instinctively wanted to escape.

But his reaction was ultimately a beat slower.

This sword of Ye Yuan’s was extremely crafty. He had no way of avoiding it at all!

At the same time, Ye Yuan’s figure also turned into a wisp of green smoke, suddenly attacking.

However, right at this time, a change suddenly occurred.

Ye Yuan’s eyes blurred, a yellow-spotted shadow suddenly blocking in front, meeting this sword of his head-on.

“Roar of Wind!”

Only to hear a roar, two terrifying attacks collided together in an instant.

Boom!

Ye Yuan was akin to having suffered a heavy blow, directly spewing out a mouthful of blood, his figure shooting backward.

He looked at the Eight-spotted Leopard ahead, his eyes full of solemnity.

This Eight-spotted Leopard’s speed was too fast and his strength was too strong!

Furthermore, this guy’s reaction was extremely fast and did not give him any chance at all.

The Eight-spotted Leopard looked at Ye Yuan and said with a cold smile, “Boy, I’ve observed you for a long time! You’re very clever. Furthermore, your combat experience is extremely rich. You’re a very troublesome opponent! Therefore, I won’t give you any chance! Just nice, I can restrain you in terms of speed. No matter how strong your grandmist treasure is, it’s also impossible to break through!”

In reality, they had long already been hiding nearby.

With regards to Ye Yuan and the Golden Eagle Dual Fiends’ battle, the Eight-spotted Leopard and the rest of the true spirits saw it clearly too.

The Eight-spotted Leopard was very apprehensive of the observation ability and combat strength that Ye Yuan exhibited.

Therefore, he did not relax his vigilance towards Ye Yuan at all.

The moment Ye Yuan moved, he moved!

Ye Yuan had a solemn look on his face, he knew that he had encountered a tough nut.

Not only was this Eight-spotted Leopard extremely strong, but his observation was also extremely meticulous. He was definitely a combat expert.

“Looks like you’re not planning on surrendering without resistance! Since that’s the case, then we’ll send you on your way together!” As he spoke, he brandished his sharp claws at the true spirit army. The nine great Jade Sovereign Heavens moved out at the same time!

Clearly, these eight people listened to his command.

Ye Yuan, a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, was facing nine great Jade Sovereign Heavens at the same time. This was simply something that made people despair.

In an instant, Ye Yuan fell into an extremely dangerous situation.

Other true spirits were still alright; Ye Yuan could rely on his movement technique to evade their attacks.

But the Eight-spotted Leopard and Purplelight Battle Wolf, these two great middle Jade Sovereign Heavens brought tremendous pressure on Ye Yuan.

After a few moves, Ye Yuan’s body was already hit by several claw marks, fresh blood dripping.

“Brat, for a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven like you to be able to last so many moves under the nine of us teaming up, you can already be sufficiently proud! But today, I’ll be accepting your grandmist treasure! Hahaha …”

Beyond the laughter, the Eight-spotted Leopard was still extremely shocked in his heart.

Observing from the sidelines was one thing, it was another thing to experience it for himself.

In just these few rounds, the calmness and combat strength that Ye Yuan displayed, as well as that easy-going attitude between life and death, moved him immensely.

This kind of behavior absolutely should not appear on such a young Limitless Sublime Heaven.

He only had a feeling that this human was remarkable!

Facing the nine of their attacks, forget about a lower Limitless Sublime Heaven, even a lower Jade Sovereign Heaven would probably have to die with regrets within a few moves too!

But Ye Yuan already held on for more than ten moves!

Although he was already riddled with wounds, he stubbornly evaded the most dangerous attacks.

This kind of combat consciousness simply made people’s hair stand on end!

Ye Yuan gave a cold snort and said, “Be pleased with yourself after you can kill me!”

Eight-spotted Leopard laughed loudly and said, “Killing you is just a matter of lifting a hand! I want to see how long you can last!”

Ye Yuan had already fallen into absolute danger at this time.

Amidst the nine people, he was like a small rowboat in the vast ocean.

Just imagine, how astonishing was the imposing momentum of nine great Jade Sovereign Heavens?

In contrast, Ye Yuan’s Limitless Sublime Heaven aura could simply be ignored.

“Hahaha, that brat ultimately still can’t escape death!”

“Foolish human, to actually get swept into Bright Tiger King’s sons’ fight for the throne! Serves him right to die too!”

“A brat who’s like a mantis blocking the cart. Does he really think that a Jade Sovereign Heaven’s majesty is so easy to provoke?”

… …

Under such an attack, everyone all looked poorly on Ye Yuan, thinking that he was already dead for sure.

Over there, Shuoyan had also fallen into heavy encirclement.

The subordinates around him got fewer and fewer, his injuries also got increasingly worse.

But he did not care about his own injuries at all.

In the midst of the fierce fighting, a part of his attention was placed on Ye Yuan there.

Seeing Ye Yuan fall into a desperate situation, he was burning with anxiety.

“Young Master Shuoyan, you can’t even fend for yourself anymore now. Yet, you’re still caring about others? Come, let me send you on your way obediently. It won’t be too painful! That brat over there will be reuniting with you very soon!”

The one talking was a giant python true spirit. He was the Eight-spotted Leopard’s subordinate, his strength had already reached grand completion Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum too. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He led upper and grand completion level Limitless Sublime Heavenly Stratum powerhouses and launched a siege against Shuoyan.

Shuoyan’s combat power was indeed unmatched too; far surpassing those in the same rank.

His bloodline power was extremely strong. Coupled with Bright Tiger King’s true inheritance martial techniques, his strength was even stronger than the average grand completionLimitless Sublime Heaven!

But facing the siege of so many powerhouses, he already fell into a desperate situation too.

The injuries on his body got increasingly worse and his consciousness also became more and more blurry.

He felt that he was going to die.

Pffft!

Right at this time, he saw from his peripherals that the Eight-spotted Leopard pierced a claw into Ye Yuan’s chest, nailing Ye Yuan’s firmly onto a tree.

Seeing this scene, his eyes turned bloodshot from anger!

That person only fell into a death situation because of him!

That person helped him to rise heaven-defyingly!

How could he watch him die?

No way!

Absolutely not!

In his blurry consciousness, Shuoyan told himself like this.

The blurry consciousness abruptly startled awake.

“Roar!”

A tiger roar reverberated throughout the mountain range, with a peerlessly domineering aura.

The giant python true spirit saw that Shuoyan was on the verge of death and was just about to make a move to kill him.

But this sudden roar shocked until his two ears rumbled, nosebleed pouring.

That pressure, which originated from the bloodline, made him almost unable to stand!

And Shuoyan’s aura actually skyrocketed at this moment!

Everyone had dumbfounded faces, completely not knowing what was going on.

Just a moment ago, Shuoyan was clearly still on the verge of death.

How did he directly break through in the next second?

“Terrific lad, he actually awakened the chaos true spirit bloodline!” In Ye Yuan’s sea of consciousness, came Mi Tian’s exclamation.

When Ye Yuan heard, he could not help rolling his eyes.

He was already about to die, this old man was actually still lamenting about other people awakening whatever bloodline.

Could he not figure out what the priority is?

He had been calling Mi Tian all along in the sea of consciousness just now. But, no idea what was going on, this guy completely ignored him.

Helpless, he could only fight to the death.

Now, he was almost dying, he appeared like nobody’s business.

“You still have the mind to care about others? I’m going to die!” Ye Yuan said in a great rage..
