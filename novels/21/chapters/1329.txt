Chapter 1333: Actually, We Did It on Purpose!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Yuan’s sudden appearance caught Wang Yutao duo by surprise.

But very soon, their figures moved swiftly, directly cutting off Ye Yuan’s retreat.

Ye Yuan’s smiled faintly. He did not speak, allowing them to act.

“Don’t be so nervous, relax a bit,” Ye Yuan said with a faint smile.

Wang Yutao’s expression turned cold, and he said, “Brat, you’re really gutsy, to actually dare come out and court death! You killed 11 of my Wang Family’s elites. Today, we’ll settle this score properly!”

Seeing Ye Yuan, Wang Yutao’s anger reached the limit all at once.

Currently, he wished to swallow Ye Yuan’s flesh raw.

Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said with a smile, “Your Wang Family chased this Ye from Jewelhill City to the Yin Wind Den. Could it be that ... you still don’t allow me to fight back?”

Wang Yutao snorted coldly and said, “Want to blame, you will have to blame yourself, and that you shouldn’t have opposed my Wang Family! This world is the world of the strong! If I want you dead, you have no choice but to die!”

Ye Yuan laughed. Chang Liang and the others behind him also laughed.

Wang Yutao’s face turned black, being deeply triggered by the few people’s laughter.

“You laughed? I hope that you all can still laugh in a while! This old man will let you know what’s called a fate worse than death! Yugan, do it!”

Wang Yutao shouted coldly, rushing towards Ye Yuan with Wang Yugan one after the other.

Two mighty grand completion Grotto Profound experts making a move at the same time, that aura was truly astonishing.

But right at this time, an even more terrifying aura emanated from Ye Yuan’s body.

A piercing cold Yin wind stirred. Even those as powerful as Wang Yutao and Wang Yugan were also virtually frozen by this gust of Yin wind.

The other Wang Family members’ strengths were lacking. How could they withstand such Yin wind? Their divine souls were directly scattered to the wind!

Slam!

Slam!

Wang Yutao and Wang Yugan fell straight down from midair, slamming severely onto the ground.

The two people opened their eyes wide, their eyes full of disbelief.

How could such a terrifying Yin wind emit from Ye Yuan’s body?

They only felt like their divine souls were about to be frozen at this time. This gust of Yin wind was too powerful!

Seeing Ye Yuan approach step by step, Wang Yugan panicked inwardly.

He struggled, wanting to get up. But his entire body was blown numb by the Yin wind. How could he muster up the strength in a short while?

“You ... What do you want to do?” Wang Yugan said fearfully.

Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold and he said coldly, “Do what? Huhu, what this young master is going to do, you should be even clearer than me, right? Rest assured, this young master won’t kill you right now. How to deal with you, Luo Jian has the final say.”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan attacked like lightning, directly sealing Wang Yugan’s divine essence and hauling him up like holding up a dead dog.

“The numbing effects of the Yin wind can last for roughly an hour. Act faster and catch up earlier,” Ye Yuan said with Chang Liang.

Chang Liang cupped his fists and said with a bow, “Yes, Your Excellency! When us brothers finish venting this frustration, we’ll catch up!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head, his figure moving, vanishing before the few people’s eyes.

Chang Liang five people looked at the dead dog-like Wang Yutao, incomparably pleased in their hearts.

“Wang Yutao, you were so awe-inspiring earlier! But now, if I want you dead, you have no choice but to die! Hahaha ...”

Chang Liang mimicked Wang Yutao’s words earlier, truly ironic to the max.

A moment ago, Wang Yutao was still awe-inspiring. A moment later, he became a dead dog.

Furthermore, saying this kind of words in front of Ye Yuan was simply ridiculous.

Wang Yutao was unable to move all over. But his expression was ugly to the extreme.

He had not figured out until now what in the world happened.

Why would such a horrifying Yin wind emit from Ye Yuan’s body?

“Wang Yutao, didn’t you want to kill us brothers? Get up!” Number Two said with a cold smile.

Puchi!

Number four’s blade stabbed into Wang Yutao’s heart without the least bit of hesitation.

“When you killed Number Three and Number Seven, you definitely didn’t think that retribution came so quickly, right?” Number Four gnashed his teeth in hatred and said.

To a Deity Realm powerhouse, puncturing the heart would not be fatal. But that heart-gouging pain shot straight up to his head, making him anguished until he wished to die.

Puchi!

Another blade, Number Five directly chopped off one of Wang Yutao’s palm.

“Just the likes of you are also fit to raise a hue with Lord Ye Yuan? I ask you to raise a hue, ask you to raise a hue!” Number Five said with a hideous grin.

“Ahh! Ahh!”

A series of miserable screams lingered on in the air. Chang Liang five people’s torture made him hover between life and death.

Chang Liang five people were not some guys who had not seen the world before. They had mingled among the bottom level martial artists all year round. Disregarding cruel and merciless, the methods of torturing people sprung up in endless variations too.

They were nice to their brothers. But toward enemies, they absolutely would not show mercy.

The deaths of Number Three and Number Seven made them hate Wang Yutao to the bones!

“C-Chang Liang, aren’t you all afraid of the Wang Family’s revenge for daring to treat this old man like this?” Wang Yutao endured the intense pain and shouted.

Chang Liang five people were thrilled the moment they heard and laughed mockingly as they said, “Aiyo, brothers, this old fart is threatening us right now, what do you think we should do? I’m so scared, are you all scared or not?”

“Scared! I’m really scared of death! Big Brother, why don’t we help this old fogey up and beg him for mercy?” Number Six said.

Chang Liang chuckled and said, “Yeah, Second Elder, spare the few of us brothers, alright? I know that we were wrong! Pffft!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Chang Liang laughed as he stabbed Wang Yutao again.

Wang Yutao’s face was green with pain. He gasped for air as he said, “D-Don’t you guys forget, the Wang Family still has ... still has my elder brother!”

Chang Liang smiled coldly and said, “Using Wang Yuxiang that old fart to come and scare your father? Mm? Let you be scared of your father! Let you be scared of your father!”

The five brothers slashed one after another. Before long, they poked Wang Yutao into a sieve.

Their blows were very appropriate, making Wang Yutao agonized to the point of wishing for death, but all these did not take his life.

Under the five of their torture, Wang Yutao was almost breaking down.

He seriously could not figure out where these few people got the confidence to actually not even place Big Brother Wang Yuxian in their sights!

His elder brother, Wang Yuxian, was an initial-stage Heaven Glimpse powerhouse.

In this Jewelhill City, that was a top of the class existence. Even Yang Rui did not dare to make light of him too!

These few barbarians actually did not take him seriously!

Not only did they make light of him, but also when he mentioned his elder brother, those few guys also became aggravated instead.

Time passed,and in a twinkle, an hour’s time was almost up.

Wang Yutao suddenly felt his body gradually recover a bit of strength.

This discovery made him inexplicably thrilled. Because he noticed that Chang Liang and the rest only cared about tormenting him and had forgotten about the time.

As long as he waited a while more, in a short while, their doomsday would be here!

He was praying, praying that Chang Liang and the rest really forgot the time.

“Have you recovered some strength? Do you ... feel that there’s still a hint of hope? Are you ... thinking of how to sentence us to death? Huhu, your father will tell you very responsibly, you’re thinking too much! Actually, we did it on purpose! Hahaha ...”

Chang Liang’s voice was like a devil, shattering the last glimmer of Wang Yutao’s hope.
