1783 Team Up With Me

Yang Fan sized Ye Yuan up, revealing a look of curiosity.

But Han Yong laughed loudly and said, “Haha, fortunately, Old Yang you came in the nick of time. Otherwise, the two of us will die here today. Zhao Zhao this damn fellow, there will come a day where I’ll make him pay the price!”

Yang Fan shot him a glare and said, “You can really cause trouble!”

Han Yong cried injustice as he said, “This has nothing to do with me! I was just chatting with Younger Brother Ye and those few fellows suddenly came out. But speaking of which, Younger Brother Ye is loyal enough! I like that! Uh, I can’t shield you, but Old Yang can definitely cover you!”

Yang Fan shot him a glare and said, “This matter isn’t over yet! Don’t you forget, the Devil Elephant lineage has considerable power and influence in the Shadowmoon Sect. Some people, even I can’t afford to provoke them either!”

Han Yong’s face changed, revealing a solemn expression.

The moment Ye Yuan heard, he understood in his heart. It seemed like there were many factions in this Shadowmoon Sect too.

But it was also not surprising, with the Bamboo Groove Void Realm’s system, quite a few people all come from the same sect. They would naturally help one another.

Provoking the Zhao trio brothers, a single misstep and it was provoking the entire Devil Elephant lineage’s people.

“Humph! All in all, Younger Brother Ye will be my brother, Han Yong’s brother, in the future! If anyone dares to bully him, they will have to ask me first!” Han Yong said with a cold snort.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Then I’ll have to thank Brother Han very much.”

Han Yong smiled and said, “But speaking of which, Younger Brother Ye, your strength really makes me view you in a different light. Perhaps you can really pass the examination.”

...

In front of the mountain gate, several hundred Divine Lord Realm powerhouses were gathered together.

At this time, quite a few people’s gazes looked in the same direction.

That was a woman in a purple dress, skin akin to pale cream colour, having arched eyebrows and bright red lips. She could be rated as an unparalleled beauty of a generation.

“That’s the Baili Qingyan of the Immortal Abode Sect? Indeed ridiculously beautiful!”

“I heard that she’s already a peak Ninth Firmament Divine Lord at less than 800 years old. This is a true genius!”

“Coming to take part in the Shadowmoon Sect’s entrance examination this time, it should be for the sake of the Bamboo Groove Holy Temple’s slots, right?”

...

Ye Yuan was also secretly somewhat surprised. This Baili Qingyan’s talent could virtually be put on par with the Leng Qiuling that he met on the Heavenspan Mountain.

Indeed, there were no shortages of geniuses everywhere!

But beside Baili Qingyan, there were still two youths. The auras on their bodies were actually not weaker than Baili Qingyan.

“Those two, one is called Duan Qinghong, originating from the Cloudsword Sect. The other is called Zhong Hanlin, coming from the Soaring Flower Sect. Coupled with Baili Qingyan’s Immortal Abode Sect, these three great sects are all the leaders of Celestial Deity level sects! The three of them joining the Shadowmoon Sect at this time, their goal is likely for the sake of the Bamboo Groove Holy Temple’s spots. Uh, looking is enough, Baili Qingyan that kind of beauty, you have no chance. Although you have the appearance of a pretty boy, your strength is too weak.”

When Han Yong saw Ye Yuan stare at that side, he came up to beat him down without any mercy.

Ye Yuan could not resist rolling his eyes. When was he interested in Baili Qingyan?

Just as they were talking, a disciple dressed in Shadowmoon Sect outer-sect attire walked over toward Ye Yuan’s side.

Han Yong’s expression could not help change when he saw the person. He then said in a solemn voice, “It’s Song Ting. He’s the Zhao brothers’ senior apprentice brother!”

Song Ting’s gaze was dark as he said, “Brat, heard that you ambushed Zhao Xi and crippled his hands and legs, making him unable to participate in the examination this time?”

Ye Yuan attacked him extremely heavily. Even if he swallowed medicinal pills, his injury also could not recover within a short time.

With Zhao Xi’s situation, he was definitely unable to take part in the test this time.

And the ones present currently were only Zhao Zhao and Zhao Shu two people.

Ye Yuan smiled when he heard that and said, “Senior Apprentice Brother misunderstood.”

Song Ting’s face fell and he said, “You dare to quibble?”

Ye Yuan shook his head and said coolly, “I didn’t ambush him, but I crippled him openly and uprightly.”

Song Ting was taken aback, and then he said in great rage, “Punk, you dare to mess with me?”

Ye Yuan said, “I was just saying it directly. Why? Is Senior Apprentice Brother going to stand up for Zhao Xi?”

Ye Yuan knew that they already stepped into the mountain currently. Song Ting did not dare to make a move.

“Heh, kid, looks like you feel reassured with someone’s backing! But don’t you forget, the entrance examination this first round, doesn’t restrict killing!” Song Ting said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan looked at Zhao Zhao and Zhao Shu behind Song Ting and said with disdain, “With the likes of these two good-for-nothings?”

Zhao Zhao and Zhao Shu were greatly enraged the moment they heard and wanted to attack but was stopped by Song Ting.

“Punk, you’re very gutsy! I heard that you came from a small sect, so you probably don’t know how powerful the Devil Elephant lineage is in the Shadowmoon Sect yet, right? But you don’t have a need to know either, because you can’t walk out of the Shadowmoon Mountain Range,” Song Ting said with a cold smile.

Ye Yuan said speechlessly, “Senior Apprentice Brother coming to find me is in order to let out harsh words? That’s very childish.”

Song Ting wanted to come and see Ye Yuan wag his tag and beg for mercy.

He did not expect that Ye Yuan actually rebutted him until he could not get off the stage.

This guy definitely did not know how terrifying the Devil Elephant lineage’s strength was. That was why he would be like this.

However, that was not important anymore. This punk was dead for sure!

Song Ting’s expression changed and he said in a cold voice, “Good, very good! Punk, you’ll feel how terrifying my wrath is!”

When the others saw this scene, they were shocked until their jaws hit the ground.

Apart from the three great sects, the Devil Elephant Sect’s strength was second to none.

Their powerhouses in the Shadowmoon Sect were plentiful, their power and influence could be said to be immense.

But now, Ye Yuan, a Fifth Firmament Divine Lord little fellow, actually dared to provoke the Devil Elephant lineage!

This guy’s guts were also a little too fat, right?

Han Yong gave a thumbs up and exclaimed, “A fine person, indeed! Younger Brother, you’re really gutsy! Song Ting is already a half-step Celestial Deity powerhouse, as well as half a foot already stepped into becoming an inner-disciple. However, he’ll probably mobilize the Devil Elephant lineage’s connections and make the disciples taking part in the examination this time all target you.”

Yang Fan’s brows furrowed slightly, and he said, “You, kid, are also a troublemaker! What’s the deal with yielding sometimes? Those participating in the examination this time, quite a few people’s strengths are all not beneath mine. Furthermore, the Soaring Flower Sect’s relationship with the Devil Elephant Sect is pretty good. He might have Zhong Hanlin take action to deal with you. At that time, even if it’s me, it’s hard to resist too!”

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “I would rather die standing than live kneeling. Want to make me yield, no chance. Want to kill me, come at me with your own capabilities then! Uh ... the examination this time, Brother Han and Brother Yang form a team, I’ll be by myself.”

The moment Han Yong heard, he said in great rage, “What are you saying? Speaking of which, this matter was still caused by me, how can you abandon you? If you still say this kind of words, don’t blame me for falling out!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ye Yuan felt a warmth in his heart. Just as he was about to speak, a gentle voice sounded out by his eyes.

“Do you have people to form a team? If you don’t, why not team up with me!”

Ye Yuan turned around to look, who was it if not Baili Qingyan?

Everyone opened their mouths wide, looking at this scene in disbelief.

“H-Haha, then ... following you is too dangerous. I’d better forsake you,” Han Yong coughed dryly twice and said with a mysterious smile on his face.
