Chapter 1478 Sword Dao Second-Layered Heaven Grand Completion!

“Who survived and came to the Heavenspan World? How did you end up in the fiend race territory and become a slave?” Ye Yuan asked coldly.

Hearing Long Zhan’s words, Ye Yuan’s heart was long burning with fury already.

These bunch of guys would rather die than be willing to protect the Immortal Grove World. Truly selfish to the extreme.

Sensing the killing intent creeping out of Ye Yuan’s body, Long Zhan was incredibly perturbed inwardly.

“At that time, we had a total of seven people who survived. After entering the Heavenspan World, we all sustained heavy injuries. We couldn’t determine our location and no idea how long we walked either. Who knew that we actually ran into a group of slave traffickers! Our injuries at that time were very severe, we had no strength to fight back at all. In the end, after passing through several hands and places, we were sold to the fiend race. In-between this, we had another four companions die. Now, the ones who are still alive are only three people,” Long Zhan said.

Ye Yuan said with a cold smile, “You all, as the Immortal Grove World’s strongest people, don’t take on any responsibility when something crops up, and would rather die than be willing to resist the fiend race! Immortal Grove World’s billions of lives were almost annexed to become fiend race slaves. This ... is perhaps your retribution!”

Over a hundred Deity Realm powerhouses almost wiped out, this was perhaps everything foreordained by heaven.

Long Zhan said trembling with fear, “Y-Yes.”

Ye Yuan swept a glance over him and said coolly, “Apart from you, where are the rest?”

Long Zhan said, “There’s still one person at Capone Capital City. The other person went to Eminent Orchid Imperial City. As for their life and death, I don’t know.”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and said coolly, “About removing the slave seal, you can stop thinking about it. In the future, it will depend on your performance.”

Long Zhan had a disappointed look, but he still said helplessly, “Yes, Master!”

Ye Yuan not lifting Long Zhan’s slave seal had his own considerations.

Putting aside him leaving the Immortal Grove World, Long Zhan was enslaved for 100 thousand years, the deeply rooted nature of a slave already penetrated deep into the bone marrow.

The current Long Zhan was no longer the leader of a clan back then.

For him to be able to live until now, he was bound to worldly-wise and slippery to the extreme already.

He was a complete and utter lackey!

Such a person, once the slave seal was lifted, he would not even know when he sold him.

“Oh, right, you’ve been in Capone Capital City for so long, let me ask you something. A million years ago, who was Capone Capital City’s city lord? Is he still in Capone Capital City now?” Ye Yuan suddenly asked.

Long Zhan was stunned and shook his head and said, “The city lord a million years ago is probably already dead, right?”

The fiend race had long lives and it was extremely hard to die.

Fiend lord class powerhouses, their lifespans were even as long as several million years and would not easily die.

But the fiend race territory was not as peaceful as the human race. Even between the two capital cities, they would carry out campaigns on each other too.

City lords dying in battle was also a common thing.

Just take Capone Capital City for example. If somebody broke through to Fiend Lord Realm, they might very likely go and challenge the city lord.

As long as he could kill the city lord, he would be able to replace him.

Therefore, the replacing of fiend race territory leaders was very fast.

Some capital cities’ city lords would even change several times in a century!

The city lord a million years ago, it was virtually very hard to verify already. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But it was also precisely because of so that fiend race powerhouses were abundant like clouds, their combat strength far surpassing same-rank humans.

Tiderain City’s martial artists could only resist the fiend army by being all veterans of a hundred battles.

Ordinary humans, three or four people might not be able to deal with one same-rank fiend.

All these, Ye Yuan was naturally aware long ago. Asking about it was just holding onto thoughts of getting lucky.

“Then do you know where in Capone Capital City is information the most accessible?” Ye Yuan asked again.

Long Zhan blurted out, “Want to say accessible information, it’s naturally the Blood Yama Hall! It’s just that wanting to inquire about intel from their place, it’s probably not that easy.”

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly and he said with a nod, “I got it, withdraw.”

...

In the Death Cultivation Space, Ye Yuan’s sweat ran down like raindrops.

The other Ye Yuan opposite him attacked like lightning, one sword faster than the other, already pressuring Ye Yuan to the limits.

“You weakling, I don’t believe that I can’t kill you! Go to hell!”

The clone gnashed his teeth in hatred, his eyes revealing a murderous light. A Chasing Moon stabbed towards Ye Yuan’s chest as quick as lightning.

Ever since the first time entering the Death Cultivation Space, after narrowly escaping death, Ye Yuan already entered the Death Cultivation Space several dozen times.

Each time, he was dancing on the edge of a knife, accompanied by the death god.

But each time, he could finish off the clone by a hair’s breadth.

It was precisely because of so that Ye Yuan’s improvement would be so quick.

For him to fight bravely alone amidst the fiend army, slaying a thousand people, and still leave calmly, it was inseparable from this death training.

If it were before, Ye Yuan could kill Lang Ge, but he absolutely could not do it so effortlessly.

Lang Ge’s strength was actually not considered much in the fiend race. It was also not much better than Qin Zheng those guys.

How could jumping realms to battle be that easy?

Entering the Death Cultivation Space each time, Ye Yuan really squeezed out every bit of potential.

Not being able to defeat the clone, he could only die!

Hence, every time he entered, he had to make progress!

Even if it was just a tiny bit.

Sailing against the current, either advance or regress

Except, this retreat was eternal damnation!

Gradually, Ye Yuan fell in love with this feeling of being accompanied by death.

He discovered that this Heavenly Empyrean Immortal Grove was simply a genius, to actually be able to come up with such a miraculous cultivation method.

Because each time he entered, he would have great harvests.

That feeling of breaking through under extreme conditions was simply too wonderful.

It was impossible for Ye Yuan to be as intrepid as when he entered the Selfless Realm at that time. Each time he won, it was a hair above the replicate.

Of course, this kind of dangerous cultivation, Ye Yuan would not rashly go in. That was no different from seeking death.

Each time he had gained from battle or cultivation, he would enter here and challenge himself!

Under extreme conditions, Ye Yuan was able to transform these gains into real strength!

Improving a little bit each time, accumulating day by day and month by month, it was a rather considerable improvement.

During that battle with the fiend race, Ye Yuan slew a thousand people. It was rather hard to come by tempering.

To Ye Yuan, how could he possibly miss such a good opportunity for improvement?

Joining the Fan Family now, he was considered to have settled down. Only then did he have time to hone himself.

Life and death juncture, Ye Yuan had some comprehension, his figure rushing out like lightning!

The same Chasing Moon!

But Ye Yuan’s move was faster, sharper!

Reaching first despite launching later!

Pfft!

Ye Yuan’s sword passed through the chest!

No fresh blood flowed out, but the clone looked at Ye Yuan with a hateful look and said gloomily, “Why?! Why can you beat me each time?! I ... There will come a day where I’m going to kill you!”

The Death Cultivation Space’s replicate actually carried the memories last time.

The clone forced Ye Yuan to the limit time and again, but he was defeated under Ye Yuan’s hands every single time. The negative emotions already accumulated to a very terrifying degree.

Ye Yuan wiped the sweat on his forehead and said with a faint smile, “Okay, I’ll be waiting for you!”

The replicate carried intense unwillingness and dissipated away.

But Ye Yuan was rather joyful as he said, “Sword Dao Laws second-layered heaven, finally cultivated to grand completion!”
