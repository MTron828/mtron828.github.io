Chapter 2012: Ye Yuan’s Connections

“Fourth Firmament Empyrean! This is Fourth Firmament Empyrean!”

“My God! What to do now?”

“The realm of Empyrean Realm, one realm is one world. In front of a Fourth Firmament Empyrean, Lord Ye Yuan likely has no means to contend anymore!”

...

There was a cry of exclamations in the city. They were all shocked by the strength that Empyrean Cang Yuan exhibited.

Empyrean Realm, the disparity of each minor realm was incomparably huge.

Among the powerhouses present, Bai Tong was the strongest.

But even if he was carrying two empyrean spirit treasures on him, it also could not make up for this massive gap.

Let alone that fact that Fourth Firmament Empyrean was middle-stage Empyrean Realm, more than a level stronger than initial-stage Empyrean Realm.

No one could have thought that such a huge change would actually occur.

A Heavenly Emperor Bodhimanda sent a messenger in person, and it was a middle-stage Empyrean Realm super powerhouse straight away.

Such a person, even if Ye Yuan had exceedingly formidable abilities, he was also powerless to turn the tables anymore!

Empyrean Cang Yuan looked towards Ye Yuan and said coolly, “Are you walking by yourself? Or do you want this Empyrean to take action?”

Being snatched from the jaws of death, Lu Yan could not resist bursting into laughter and said, “Brat, weren’t you very arrogant? Didn’t you want to kill this Empyrean? Now, this Empyrean will see what means you still have to be arrogant!”

Deng Yunzai and Dai Chunhao also revealed looks of wild joy on their faces. This switch from great sorrow to overwhelming joy made them forget their identities as Empyreans for a moment, roaring with laughter without any scruples.

“Ye Yuan punk, this Empyrean will definitely tear you into pieces!” Deng Yunzai gnashed his teeth in hatred and said. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As Empyrean powerhouses, they had never thought that they would be in despair at the hands of a True God Realm.

Rather, it was Empyrean Cang Yuan who swept a glance over the three people rather surprisedly, not knowing why they had such great grievances.

He had just hurried over. How could he have thought that these three great Empyreans were all created by Ye Yuan single-handedly?

The ones who wanted to kill them were clearly those three great Empyrean powerhouses!

Even if Ye Yuan poisoned thousands of True God Realms to death, these three people also would not go so far as to hate Ye Yuan like this, right?

Looking at their appearances, they did not have much hatred toward those three Empyrean powerhouses instead.

This situation was very strange.

While at this time, Jian Hongxiao blocked in front of Ye Yuan and said in a solemn voice, “Fellow Daoist Cang Yuan, I’m Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s Stellar Hall’s elder, Jian Hongxiao. Ye Yuan is my Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital’s close friend. Are you sure you want to make things difficult for my Extreme Luck Great Imperial Capital?”

Duan Yi also spoke up, “Ye Yuan is my Alchemy Celestial Pavilion’s head elder, conversing as peers with Empyrean Flutterfeather. Are you sure you want to bring him away like this?”

Cang Yuan’s expression finally changed.

Clearly, these two great deities made his countenance have a visible change.

Apart from Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether, no one dared to provoke these two great deities in the entire Extreme Nether Bodhidharma!

A measly little True God Realm martial artist actually had such a profound background?

Cang Yuan’s shock was by no means insignificant.

He thought about it and shook his head and said, “This Empyrean is on Head Elder’s orders to bring Ye Yuan back to Extreme Nether Bodhidharma, Maybe ... it isn’t a bad thing. If the Bodhidharma thinks highly of him, he will naturally have a meteoric rise in the future, with his future prospects being limitless.”

When Lu Yan three people heard that, their faces could not help changing.

This was not the outcome that they wanted to see!

But very soon, Lu Yan’s expression calmed down.

As long as he entered the Extreme Nether Bodhidharma, there would naturally be ways to deal with him in the future.

Ye Yuan looked at Extreme Nether Bodhidharma Cang Yuan and said coolly, “Then help me thank Head Elder for his good intentions. But ... this Ye doesn’t have plans to go to Extreme Nether Bodhidharma.”

Empyrean Cang Yuan’s brows furrowed when he heard that. This punk was impervious to everything!

It was only to see him snort coldly and said, “Little brat, truly refusing face when it’s given! A mere True God, do you really take yourself to be somebody? Even if the two of their identities are extraordinary, do you feel that with their strength, it can awe this Empyrean? Forget it! Since that’s the case, this Empyrean can’t be bothered to waste his breath either. I’ll directly bring you away.”

Finished talking, Empyrean Cang Yuan released his aura and strode over on the air.

With each step that he took, Cang Yuan’s imposing momentum grew a notch stronger.

“Puhwark!”

“Puhwark!”

Finally, Jian Hongxiao and Duan Yi could not endure it, spewing out a mouthful of blood.

The disparity was too great!

“Move aside!” Cang Yuan flicked his sleeves grandly. Jian Hongxiao’s and Duan Yi’s figures were actually unable to hold steady and were directly sent flying by a tremendous force.

Without these two people blocking in front, Ye Yuan immediately felt a terrifying pressure come from straight ahead.

The pressure of a Fourth Firmament Empyrean was too fearsome, crushing him until his bones were creaking.

Cang Yuan looked straight at Ye Yuan and said calmly, “Brat, you’re too insolent. You think that there’s a few Empyrean backing you up, you can disregard this Empyrean? This Empyrean tells you, the might of an Empyrean ... can’t be defied! Now, come with me!”

Finished talking, Cang Yuan directly reached his hand out and grabbed toward Ye Yuan.

The world domain that surged forward like a torrential tide crushed Ye Yuan until he did not have the slightest strength to retaliate at all.

However, Cang Yuan suddenly discovered that a hint of a mocking smile flashed across the corners of Ye Yuan’s mouth, his gaze full of amusement.

Suddenly, Cang Yuan’s face changed, his figure retreating explosively.

Two figures stepped out of the void, one elderly and one young.

The old man looked at Cang Yuan and said coolly, “This old man is Shiyuan Chaoyuan. Brother Cang Yuan, please give face and lift your hand high up in mercy.”

Empyrean Cang Yuan’s face changed and he cried out in surprise, “You ... You’re Shiyuan Great Imperial Capital’s city lord, Empyrean Chaoyuan?”

The old man slowly nodded his head and said, “That’s right. It’s precisely this old man.”

Cang Yuan frowned and said, “Brother Chaoyuan is under Heavenly Emperor Cloudbright’s command. Your hand is extending too far, right?”

Empyrean Chaoyuan said coolly, “Little Friend Ye Yuan is my Shiyuan’s friend. Hearing that someone wants to be detrimental toward him, this old man specially came forth, wanting to be a mediator.”

Although the words were said courteously, the meaning of siding with him was already very clear.

Empyrean Chaoyuan still had a young man beside him. Who was it if not Song Yu?

The matter of Ye Yuan massacring several thousand True God Realms truly blew up too big.

After Song Yu heard about it, he immediately asked Empyrean Chaoyuan, hoping that he would come over and help Ye Yuan.

Empyrean Chaoyuan did not turn it down either, directly coming over.

After Song Yu returned, he already told Empyrean Chaoyuan all about the events in the Ancient God Battlefield. Empyrean Chaoyuan was also extremely shocked after listening to it.

Disregarding that Ye Yuan gave him a lucky chance, just based on that Ye Yuan was a super Alchemy Dao genius. This identity was also worth it for him to be friends with!

Empyrean Cang Yuan snorted coldly and said, “Brother Chaoyuan’s face isn’t big enough yet! Don’t you forget, this place is Heavenly Emperor Extreme Nether’s territory!”

“Is that so? Then ... what if you add us in?”

Empyrean Cang Yuan’s voice had yet to fade when several more figures stepped out of the void.

It was another three great Empyrean powerhouses!

Including Empyrean Chaoyuan, the auras emitting off of these few people actually did not lose to Empyrean Cang Yuan!

“This one is Redleaf Fivepeaks!”

“This one is Fufeng Skyhowl!”

“This one is Bluemist Redcandle!”

Three great Empyrean cupped their fists at Cang Yuan, each introducing themselves.

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. No one would have thought that so many Empyrean powerhouses would actually have shown up in Heavenly Eagle Imperial City today.

Furthermore, each and every one of these Empyrean powerhouses was a super powerhouse whose name shook a region.

Cang Yuan looked at Ye Yuan like he had seen a ghost, incredibly shocked in his heart.

Just what kind of God was this kid, to actually be able to trouble so many overlords of a region to come and protect him from hundreds of millions of miles away!
