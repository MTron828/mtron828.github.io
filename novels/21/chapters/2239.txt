Chapter 2243: I Don’t Care Who You Are

“Bang!”

The bowstring vibrated. The pale-white arrow that was condensed out of spiritual energy tore through the air.

Everyone did not even have time to react when they saw the arrow turn into a streak of flowing light, smashing towards Daymeld.

Rumble!

In virtually an instant, the entire underground cave directly burst apart.

The horrifying energy directly lifted the underground cave flying.

The entire mountain range was leveled to the ground!

Only then did everything seem to react to it.

An astonishing loud bang sounded out in the huge pit.

Space had a long fissure split open by this arrow.

This arrow was too fast, fast until even space-time did not react to it.

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand and the few mighty Heavenly Emperors had faces that were still suffering from the shock.

Even if they were supreme and invincible, they were also shocked by this scene just now until they could not close their mouths.

He looked toward the Ye Yuan beside him and opened his mouth and said, “L-Little Brother, m-many thanks for your life-saving grace!”

At the critical moment just now, Ye Yuan urged his spatial node technique and teleported the few of them out.

Otherwise, the few of them would be dead until not even dregs remained currently.

Ye Yuan looked at them and said coolly, “The divine race coming into being one after another. I’m afraid that the Doomsday Battle isn’t far anymore. All the best to you guys.”

“Doomsday Battle?”

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand had a blank look, seemingly uncertain what it meant.

But from this name, one could also tell that this was not some good thing.

Moreover, this divine race powerhouse’s strength was too terrifying!

Ye Yuan did not explain what the Doomsday Battle was. He slowly took out the bone sword and walked over toward the enormous pit.

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand’s gaze turned intent, and he said, “Little Brother, w-what are you trying to do?”

Ye Yuan did not even turn his head back as he said coolly, “Going to take back the Silvernet Blood Essence.”

In the depths of the enormous pit, a figure slowly crawled to his feet, pointed at the sky, and laughed wildly.

“The few of you damn things, you think that you can kill this ancestor with a Limitless God Killing Bow? Hahaha ... After this ancestor recovers strength, I’ll definitely trample the Heavenspan World, and let those few little bastards tremble under this ancestor’s feet! Mn?”

Daymeld was cursing away but saw a figure slowly walk over, and he could not help turning his head to look.

This person was none other than precisely Ye Yuan.

His two eyes narrowed and he said with a cold smile, “Human whelping, you think that this ancestor suffering heavy wounds, you’ll have an opportunity to take advantage of?”

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “Hand over the Silvernet Blood Essence and I’ll make it painless.”

Daymeld laughed from extreme fury. Looking at Ye Yuan like looking at a fool, he said disdainfully, “Back then, even eight Deva Fourth Blight and above human old farts couldn’t kill this ancestor and could only seal this ancestor here! Now, just the likes of you, a whelping still wet behind your ears, also dares threaten this ancestor?”

Far away, when Heavenly Emperor Quicksand and the rest heard this, their minds shook wildly.

Only then did they know how terrifying this existence before their eyes was!

“Eight Deva Fourth Blight and above powerhouses! How strong is this guy’s strength?”

“Deva Realm powerhouses, each one can move mountains and fill the seas. They are peak powerhouses that can turn the galaxy upside down! He ... He can actually fight one-on-eight?”

“Just what kind of existence is suppressed in this blood sea?! Why isn’t that human running for his life at once? Why does he still want Silvernet Blood Essence at this time?”

... ...

Ye Yuan looked at him and said coolly, “I don’t care who you are! Hand the Silvernet Blood Essence over!”

Everyone was rendered collectively speechless. Could this boy be a fool?

Or was it that he did not know what Deva Fourth Blight signified?

Rather, it was the Heavenly Emperor Ninelives who was far away, when looking at Ye Yuan, his gazes glimmered.

That arrow previously extinguished another one of his lives.

Relying on the Youluo Ghost Lantern, he rebirthed again. But he was only a peak Empyrean now.

During this trip, he did not gain anything but lost two lives, he really had nowhere to go even if he had an urge to cry.

But he still had some confidence in Ye Yuan.

He could feel that the Silvernet Blood Essence was very important to Ye Yuan.

He was even more aware that Ye Yuan was too monstrous!

He really wanted to see, between the ancient period supreme powerhouse and Ye Yuan, who was stronger and who was weaker!

“Hahaha ... Interesting! Very interesting! I already don’t know how long it has been since anyone dared to utter this kind of words in front of this ancestor! If I don’t give it to you?” Daymeld said with a look of amusement.

Whoosh!

Ye Yuan’s figure suddenly disappeared. The next instant, he already appeared in front of Daymeld.

Attacking at a word of disagreement!

Regarding Ye Yuan’s sneak attack, Daymeld’s face revealed a look of disdain.

An ant like Ye Yuan, he did not take him seriously at all, even if his current realm already fell to the late-stage Empyrean Realm.

But the next moment, his expression changed.

An astonishing power erupted around him!

In an instant, countless sword lights enveloped him.

Rumble!

Without the slightest surprise, Daymeld’s figure flew out backward and smashed out a human-shaped hole in the huge pit again.

Ye Yuan did not stop, figure moving, directly rushing into the large pit.

Rumble!

Rumble!

Rumble!

Underground, intense rumbling sounds came from time to time, making everyone who heard them feel frightened.

The two people fought from underground to the surface and fought from the surface to the sky again.

That horrifying aura made everyone’s complexion turn ashen.

Ye Yuan gained the advantage with a move, each move aiming for the vitals, pressuring until Daymeld could not catch his breath at all.

Heavenly Emperor Quicksand and the rest watched until their breathing was ragged.

“Is ... Is this boy really just a Sixth Firmament Empyrean? This attack, even a Ninth Firmament Empyrean will also find it hard to block, right?” Heavenly Emperor Quicksand said with alarm.

“When did such a monster appear in the human race? His spatial law is already almost reaching rank seven, right?”

“No wonder he dares to be so arrogant, having no respect for that divine race powerhouse! However, that divine race powerhouse isn’t an ordinary person. He probably hasn’t brought out his true strength yet, right?”

... ...

This degree of battle already far exceeded the scope of cultivation realm.

Cultivation realm already completely did not have a reference point anymore.

These two people were both existences who brute force jumped realms to battle.

Putting aside Daymeld, he was an existence that even eight Deva Fourth Blight powerhouses were unable to shake.

Disregarding that he only had roughly the strength of a Seventh Firmament Empyrean, even if he was only a Fifth Firmament Empyrean, probably even peak Empyrean powerhouses were not a match for him at all too.

But Ye Yuan’s strength exceeded everyone’s expectations.

The cultivation realm that he displayed was only Sixth Firmament Empyrean.

But, the thickness of his divine essence, the profoundness of his laws, the fearsomeness of his combat strength, took everyone’s breath away in wonder. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

With the strength that Ye Yuan displayed, cutting down Ninth Firmament Empyreans was similarly nothing difficult!

These two people could be said to be evenly matched, neither able to gain the upper-hand.

Ye Yuan was taking advantage in one move, pressing on relentlessly with every step, not giving Daymeld any chance to catch his breath at all.

Rumble!

With another sword move, Ye Yuan directly slammed Daymeld under the ground.

Then he chased after again with a flash.

But right at this time, a streak of blue light shot out from underground with a loud bang.

Ye Yuan was caught by surprise, mustering his strength and chopping out with a sword.

Rumble!

The bone sword in Ye Yuan’s hand turned into a pile of powder under the attack of the Dao marks!

Everyone watched until they felt terror, this empyrean spirit treasure was shattered just like that!

Daymeld slowly crawled out from underground, looking at Ye Yuan. His expression was cold.

“Brat, looks like you really weren’t bragging! Your strength is indeed a great deal stronger than our divine sons! I truly didn’t expect that the human race actually produced a genius like you!”
