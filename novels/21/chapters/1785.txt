Chapter 1789 Stop Making So Much Noise, Attack Together

Duan Qinghong’s pupils constricted slightly and he said in a solemn voice, “Zhong Hanlin, what did you say just now?”

With the two of their strengths, they naturally disdained to team up with others.

Only a proud daughter of heaven like Baili Qingyan could make them stoop down and take the initiative to form a team.

Therefore, Duan Qinghong did not know Zhong Hanlin’s encounter at all.

Zhong Hanlin gave a cold laugh and recounted the events that happened previously. Duan Qinghong’s face gradually turned grim.

“You scram to one side! This punk, I want him!” Duan Qinghong said in a cold voice.

Zhong Hanlin said disdainfully, “It’s you who scram to one side! This kid is mine! Nobody is allowed to snatch him!”

Duan Qinghong said in a solemn voice, “Why? You want to attack?”

“Attack then, think am scared of you?”

The two people, their Ninth Firmament Divine Lords’ pressure released, making everyone feel shocked.

The two people’s auras collided fiercely in the air. Neither could do anything to the other and they were actually evenly-matched.

These two people did not place Ye Yuan in their sights at all, as if the moment they made a move, Ye Yuan would submit obediently.

The Devil Elephant lineage’s disciples all had stunned looks. What was going on?

Ye Yuan had not been dealt with yet and these two people were actually going to start fighting first. Weren’t they afraid of Ye Yuan running away?

But when they heard Zhong Hanlin’s words, they similarly felt incredulous.

Baili Qingyan that kind of goddess actually came to blow for Ye Yuan, this was simply inconceivable.

“Stop making so much noise, the two of you attack together,” just as the two people were locked in entanglement, Ye Yuan said with a calm expression.

The two people turned their heads at the same time, using a murderous gaze to look at Ye Yuan.

“Punk, you’re really seeking death, you know that?” Zhong Hanlin said with a grim expression.

Ye Yuan said coolly, “The self-confidence of you all, these so-called geniuses, are really good. Wonder where your confidence came from, thinking that you can take me down casually.”

Duan Qinghong gave a cold laugh and said, “You’ll know very soon where our confidence comes from. Kid, I changed my mind. I’ll going to make you a mute first, then settle scores with Duan Qinghong.”

Swoosh!

Duan Qinghong was like his namesake, movement technique as relaxed as elegant as a free swan, arriving in front of Ye Yuan in a blink of an eye.

A folding fan carried horrifying power of law and swept toward Ye Yuan’s neck.

Zhong Hanlin was taken aback, not expecting to have the initiative taken by this guy.

However, he just gave a cold snort and did not take action.

A person like him was disdainful to bully with numbers.

Ye Yuan’s bit of strength was not sufficient to have him and Duan Qinghong join forces against the enemy at all.

Suddenly, his pupils constricted and he exclaimed, “Laws fusion! This ... how is this possible?”

Not just him, all of the people looked at Ye Yuan in great shock, with looks of disbelief.

Duan Qinghong was fast, but Ye Yuan was faster than him!

Ye Yuan’s sword was drawn like a rainbow, the incomparably swift and fierce sword forced Duan Qinghong into a fluster instead.

The two people clashing together, Duan Qinghong was virtually suppressed by Ye Yuan in an instant.

How could Duan Qinghong have thought that not only did Ye Yuan comprehend spatial law, but he also fused spatial law and Sword Dao law together?

Those rays of sword light were akin to the scythe of the death god, making him palpitate with anxiety and fear.

“What are you still in a daze for? Why haven’t you hurry up and come and help!”

Duan Qinghong was under immense pressure but discovered that Zhong Hanlin was still in a daze, and could not refrain from bellowing loudly.

At this time, how was whatever dignity of an expert still needed?

As long as they could take down Ye Yuan this fellow, so what if two-on-one?

Zhong Hanlin felt like he woke up from a dream. Brandishing his long spear, he charged over toward Ye Yuan.

The two people’s strengths were extraordinary in the end. Fighting two-on-one, they actually managed to block Ye Yuan’s powerful sword.

Zhao Zhao and brother exchanged a glance, both seeing the look of shock from the other person’s eyes.

Only then did he know how foolish their three brothers were.

Ye Yuan’s strength was not what they could imagine at all.

Back then, Han Yong said that he was covering Ye Yuan, and then they actually ran to threaten Ye Yuan stupidly. It served Ol’ Third right to have his hands and legs crippled.

Looking at it now, it was simply a joke back then.

Ye Yuan not leaving, it was not because of Han Yong and Yang Fan, these two supports, but that he did not take the Zhao three brothers seriously at all!

Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin two people were both middle-stage Ninth Firmament Divine Lord, their laws comprehensions were even more peerlessly powerful.

Furthermore, the weapons in the two of their hands were both celestial deity mystic treasures. The power increment was far from what divine lord mystic treasures could compare to.

Now, going two-on-one, they actually only barely managed to fight to a draw with the Ye Yuan wielding a divine lord mystic treasure.

Ye Yuan’s strength was simply too terrifying.

In a blink, the three people fought for more than a thousand moves, Duan Qinghong and Zhong Hanlin could not gain the slightest bit of advantage.

Swish!

Suddenly, Ye Yuan glimpsed an opening and stabbed a sword out bizarrely.

Duan Qinghong turned pale with fright, it was already too late to want to dodge.

But his movement technique was indeed extraordinary, avoiding his vital points.

This sword of Ye Yuan’s drew a cut on his arm.

“ARGHH!!”

Duan Qinghong screamed and fell to one side.

However, what everyone did not expect was that he suddenly moved, speeding into the distance.

This guy ... actually made an expeditious retreat and ran!

When Zhong Hanlin saw this scene, his expression could not help changing drastically. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Facing Ye Yuan alone, he felt tremendous pressure.

“Duan Qinghong, you coward! You’ll die a horrible death!” Zhong Hanlin bellowed.

But Duan Qinghong already could not hear it anymore at this time.

Losing an opponent, Ye Yuan’s sword art became even sharper. Zhong Hanlin only had the ability to parry but did not have the strength to retaliate.

Ye Yuan integrated the Spirit Concealing Sword into his sword moves. Even though the move was not as powerful as when it erupted, it came and went like a shadow when facing the enemy; impossible to guard against.

Very soon, Ye Yuan found an opening in Zhong Hanlin, with a long sword poking out like a spirit snake, aiming straight for Zhong Hanlin’s throat.

With this sword landing, Zhong Hanlin would die without a doubt.

Toward Zhong Hanlin, Ye Yuan did not have the least bit of pity.

Zhong Hanlin already had killing intent toward him previously. Even if they entered the sect in the future, he definitely would not let him go either.

Therefore, Ye Yuan’s original goal was to kill people!

The surrounding people were infected by this sword, giving off a series of exclamations.

Right at this time, an abnormality suddenly occurred.

A terrifying aura rushed out between the two without any warning.

Even Ye Yuan was caught off-guard as well.

But his reaction could be rated as fast. At once, Ye Yuan urged spatial law to the extreme, narrowly avoiding this attack.

However, this aura was too powerful and it was also a sneak attack, Ye Yuan still could not avoid it completely in the end.

“Puhwark!”

Ye Yuan spurted fresh blood wildly, his body falling heavily to the ground, already seriously injured.

A youth in blue slowly walked out of the void and looked at Ye Yuan with a contemptuous look.

When Zhong Hanlin saw this youth in blue, he was immediately wildly ecstatic.

“Senior Apprentice Brother Qian Ye!”

Qian Ye nodded slowly, but his gaze looked at Ye Yuan as he said coldly, “You must have tremendous bravery, to actually dare kill my Soaring Flower Sect’s people? Indeed have some capability, but it’s just a pity that ... in front of a Celestial Deity Realm, no matter how high your laws comprehension, it’s also empty talk!”

Ye Yuan glared at the youth in blue and stood up stubbornly.

Even though he found it somewhat difficult to even stand currently.
