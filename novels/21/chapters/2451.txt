Chapter 2457: You Liar!

The corners of Tian Qing’s mouth twitched slightly, unhappy inwardly.

Brag!

Just you brag!

You’re already boasting to the skies!

If I believe you, this progenitor would lose!

To be able to escape from under the hands of the Eight Extreme Divinities, Tian Qing had no choice but to admit that Ye Yuan was very impressive. Ye Yuan exceeded his expectations too much.

It was just that, not daring to keep him around?

Huhu!

However, what was the deal with Ye Yuan’s divine soul?

Tian Qing discovered that Ye Yuan’s divine soul seemed very different from before.

He did not know what was going on, but in terms of quality, this divine soul could be rated as perfect!

Even his divine soul was also far worse compared to Ye Yuan’s.

What on earth did this boy experience?

“Who’s that guy that you’re talking about?” Tian Qing said with a frown.

Ye Yuan shook his head and said, “Don’t know. Some rambling guy, but he was really very formidable. He almost refined me to death. But very sadly, he didn’t refine me to death, and he let my divine essence metamorphosed instead. Oh, right. He called my divine soul as chaos origin divinity. Do you know what it is?”

Tian Qing had a blank look as he shook his head and said, “Never heard of it.”

Ye Yuan stopped paying attention to him, but then he turned to look in the direction of the gray-pupil Ye Yuan and said in slight surprise, “This guy has done a good job! Broke through so quickly.”

Over there, spiritual energy roiled. Ye Yuan saw that his cultivation realm was currently rising rapidly, assaulting the middle-stage Creation Realm!

It looked like he was about to break through.

Tian Qing looked at Ye Yuan’s divine soul, killing intent suddenly arising in his heart.

His understanding of Ye Yuan before was limited to the information that came from the front.

But this time, he had crossed swords with Ye Yuan several times, and he already felt tremendous pressure.

He had never encountered this kind of pressure since he corroborated his Dao!

Even when he encountered Grand Ancestor Spacetime back then and was exiled to spacetime turbulence, it never appeared before too.

This boy could not be let alive!

Ye Yuan was currently looking at himself with all his attention, seemingly oblivious to him.

Furthermore, Ye Yuan was currently in his divine soul body. So he should not be able to execute that bizarre evasion technique.

Plus, the gray-pupil Ye Yuan said previously, as long as the main soul was killed, the gray-pupil Ye Yuan would die too!

Then now, was undoubtedly the best opportunity to kill Ye Yuan!

No opportunity was better than now!

Missing this time, wanting to kill Ye Yuan again would likely be very, very difficult!

How powerful was Tian Qing? He hid his killing intent extremely well but was already accumulating strength in secret.

The moment he made his move, it would be earth-shattering!

Divine soul leaving the body was a major taboo to human powerhouses.

Although the divine soul was strong, it could not withstand the ravaging of the opponent at all.

Once the divine soul was injured, it would be extremely troublesome.

Ye Yuan was undoubtedly committing a huge mistake right now.

But right at this time, Ye Yuan seemed to have a feeling and suddenly turned to look at Tian Qing and said with a smile, “You want to kill me?”

Tian Qing was greatly astonished inwardly. He thought that he hid it extremely well. How could it possibly be discovered by Ye Yuan?

But now that it came to this, how could Tian Qing still show mercy?

Only to see a formidable power instantly burst forth, Tian Qing threw a punch out fiercely.

Everyone was stunned by this sudden scene.

No one could have thought that Progenitor Tian Qing would actually make a move at this time.

He was still talking in a jovial manner a moment ago, but in the next second, he dealt a deadly blow.

But the eyes of the Heaven Lineage powerhouses all revealed excitement.

Lord Tian Qing finally could not stand it and made a move!

Currently, outside the ancestral land, without the enchantment of the eight god statues, space was fragile like paper.

With Tian Qing throwing a punch out, space shattered into pieces like glass.

Those spatial turbulent flows were directly squeezed and receded like the tide.

A terrifying force directly threw the entire Heaven Lineage territory into an upheaval.

This was the might of Ten-marks!

At this moment, it was as if the Doomsday Battle had reappeared.

The entire Profound Heaven Ridge was caved in by Tian Qing.

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s gaze turned cold, his figure suddenly disappearing, avoiding this blow.

Ye Yuan’s divine soul was directly blown up under this terrifying punch.

The gray divine soul fragments scattered flying along with the spatial turbulent flow.

It looked like he was already beyond dead.

When the gray-pupil Ye Yuan saw this scene, his pupils could not help constricting. A piercing cold killing intent instantly covered the entire Heaven Lineage!

At this time, he already just broke through to the middle-stage Creation Realm. Although he had not consolidated his cultivation realm yet, his strength already improved greatly!

“Hahaha ... His divine soul left the body and still dared to be arrogant in front of this progenitor! Brat, farewell forever!” Tian Qing said with a loud laugh.

Seeing Ye Yuan’s divine soul get shattered, Tian Qing felt indescribably invigorated.

With this, future troubles had been severed forever.

“Hahaha

... What did I say?! This punk actually dared to be arrogant in front of Lord Tian Qing, really seeking death!”

“Divine soul shattering, this guy is deader than dead! With this, who else is my divine race’s match?”

“F*cking hell! Your father was really aggrieved to the extreme in this one year. With this, it finally feels refreshing!”

... ...

When the Heaven Lineage powerhouses saw this scene, each and every one of them was extremely excited.

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan turned the Heaven Lineage upside down in this one year. They had no way of cultivating normally at all.

With this, they finally found the delight of having taken revenge.

Suddenly, Tian Qing felt that something was not quite right.

A piercing cold killing intent engulfed Profound Heaven Ridge!

“Mn? The main soul has already completely dissipated, why isn’t this guy dead yet? Could it be that he can still linger on with a last breath of life for a period of time? Not good!”

His voice had yet to fade when the gray-pupil Ye Yuan already suddenly disappeared from his original spot.

Pffft!

Pffft!

Pffft!

In a blink, more than ten Heaven Lineage powerhouses already died under the gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s sword.

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan did not have the slightest emotion when he acted.

He was terrifyingly calm, his calculation ability powerful to the extreme.

The moment he made his move, it was completely too late for Tian Qing to save.

“I warned you, but you didn’t seem to have listened to my words at all! Since that’s the case, bear the consequences then!” The gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s callous to the extreme voice came over as he murdered the people one by one.

One life after another withered away under his hands.

The current gray-pupil Ye Yuan already broke through to the middle-stage Creation Realm! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

His strength was sufficient to eradicate late-stage Nine-marks powerhouses!

Apart from Tian Qing and a few others, who else was his match?

Tian Qing’s expression changed wildly and suddenly pounced over towards the gray-pupil Ye Yuan.

But how could he capture the gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s figure?

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan did not only have a bizarre movement technique. His calculation ability was also extremely powerful, not giving Tian Qing the slightest chance to get close at all.

In just a blink of an eye, there were already hundreds of Eight-marks and Nine-marks powerhouses who died under Ye Yuan’s sword!

“Damn it! You liar! Didn’t you say that if the main soul dies, you’ll die too? Why are you completely fine?” Tian Qing said with a roar.

But the gray-pupil Ye Yuan completely ignored him.

Once the gray-pupil Ye Yuan’s killing spree started, the entire Heaven Lineage fell into chaos.

Everyone scattered and fled, wanting to avoid Ye Yuan.

Tian Qing’s expression changed greatly. A clever idea hit him in an emergency and he roared wildly, “Don’t run! Everyone, come to me!”

After the divine race powerhouses heard that, only then did they feel like they woke up from a dream, drawing close to his side one after another.

But how could their speed be as fast as the gray-pupil Ye Yuan?

The gray-pupil Ye Yuan was still reaping the lives of the Heaven Lineage powerhouses without restraint.

Tian Qing’s heart was dripping blood, but he could not move.

Once he moved, the divine race powerhouses that finally managed to gather around him would become the target of being slaughtered again!
