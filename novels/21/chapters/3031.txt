Chapter 3030: Heavenly Saint Ye!

“Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Ye Yuan is mighty!”

“Ye Yuan is mighty!”

… …

The sound wave shook the sky, West Sun City boiled over with excitement.

In these 100 hundred, they despaired more and more with each day.

All the way until today, Ye Yuan killed back domineeringly, overturning the raging tides!

In the hearts of the Heaven One powerhouses, Ye Yuan was already the incarnation of a god, an invincible existence!

In fact, it already surpassed Zhuo Bufan!

“Hur hur,?we all risked our lives and fought to the death. In the end, all the fame went to this kid. Who will we, a group of Hegemon Realms, find to reason things out with?” Long Jian could not resist laughing as he said.

“Isn’t that so? This seat’s Imperishable Soul Physique was almost scattered by that Bloodsky! In the end, there wasn’t even a single thank you,” Hegemon Imperishable was also sour as he said.

Ye Yuan chuckled and said rather weakly, “The few of your contributions, this Ye bears it in mind.”

Long Jian smiled coldly and said, “Do you think that this seat is someone who hankers after fame and glory? This seat is finding it unjust for Younger Brother Bufan! To talk about contribution, who in Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven can beat him? In the end, the moment you punk came back, you snatched away all of his contributions!”

Ye Yuan’s face turned black. This old man was intentionally making things difficult for him!

This sowing of discord had no good intentions behind it.

However, Zhuo Bufan did not care and said with a smile, “When a swordsman does things, it’s based on their own conscience! As for contributions, Bufan has never thought about it before. When it comes to contributions, Bufan might really not be able to match up to Brother Ye. He walked out of Rainclear Continent and rendered amazing merit starting from Saint Sovereign Heaven. Without him, Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven would have long turned to ashes, and Bufan probably wouldn’t have had the chance to corroborate my Dao.”

Long Jian was speechless. This sowing of discord was considered to have failed.

He sighed emotionally and said, “Although Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven is a low-level plane, it produced many outstanding figures. How admirable!”

The Hegemons who came to help nodded their heads one after another.

Cloudmount’s and Blacksun’s self-sacrifice, Zhuo Bufan’s willingness to die rather than yield, many Hegemons fighting until their last breath, all these events moved them.

This was really very hard to see in other planes.

Reaching Hegemon Realm, transcending samsara, one could live for countless years. Who had no qualms about dying?

As long as they were willing, they could have abandoned Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven and left. Nobody would have been able to do anything about them.

But no one retreated!

Were they fighting for themselves? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

No!

These Hegemons were fighting for trillions of lives!

“Hahaha?… I knew that you, this kid, won’t let your master down! Beautifully done, kid!” Cloudmount laughed loudly and came up to greet.

He was carried by Zhou Pinespring. Cloudmount himself was no longer able to fly.

Cloudmount’s right arm was already gone. His entire person overflowed with an old aura, like a flickering candle in the wind.

But at this time, Cloudmount was full of high spirits and vigorous, not caring in the slightest.

He was proud of this disciple!

“Master, thankfully, I didn’t fail the mission!” Ye Yuan felt upset but still said solemnly.

This old man was worthy of respect!

Even Long Jian and the rest also bowed down to Cloudmount.

Cloudmount hurriedly returned the courtesy and said, “The few of you mustn’t do this. This old man is merely a Peak Hegemon. I have to salute when I meet everyone! You all are killing this old man like this!”

Long Jian said solemnly, “Brother Cloudmount is deserving of this bow!”

Feeling the sincerity of Long Jian and the rest, Cloudmount stopped putting up a pretense of dignity and said with a smile, “Cloudmount thanks everyone for lending a helping hand on behalf of my ignoble disciple! I, this old fellow, am already crippled, but I still have several disciples under me. Although they are incompetent, they can still help everyone out. If everyone needs help, feel free to speak up.”

Long Jian nodded and said, “Then, I’ll have to thank Brother Cloudmount very much!”

After a bout of small talk, the powerhouses went to treat their injuries.

The news of Heaven One’s great victory was also in the midst of continuous fermentation.

The entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven had completely sunk into the sea of wild ecstasy.

At this moment, countless powerhouses hugged each other and cried without any care for their face.

The deeds of Ye Yuan bringing all the powerhouses back and crushing the blood race were turned into all kinds of versions, reaching every corner of the world.

Although the likes of Zhuo Bufan and Cloudmount were similarly capable of evoking praises and tears, the person who determined the victory was Ye Yuan!

“I heard that back then, the Heaven One Hegemons and blood race Hegemons had a great battle. Hegemon Bufan nearly died. Ye Yuan descended from the sky with celestial soldiers, even killing a blood race Hegemon with one punch! Then he brought ten great Supreme Hegemons and swept away the blood race!”

“Your boasting has no limit, right? Isn’t Ye Yuan Emperor Vast Heaven? How did he kill a Hegemon Realm with one punch?”

“Hur hur,

?what the hell do you know! Ye Yuan this person can’t be gauged with common sense! Have you seen before any Emperor Vast Heaven that could bring ten Hegemon Realms back? Have you seen before a Saint Sovereign Heaven who could defeat Hegemon Realm Bloodsky? Have you seen before …”

“Uh,?now that you say so, it really makes sense! Indeed, it’s impossible for this sort of thing to happen to others. But it’s really possible when it comes to Ye Yuan!”

“No way. I’m going to join the Extreme Medicine Sect! In this life, I’ll only follow Heavenly Saint Ye’s footsteps!”

“Come, come, come! Go together!”

… …

There was a saint after a great calamity!

A saint that came down from heaven!

Ye Yuan obtained the title of ‘heavenly saint’ no idea since when.

The entire Grand Brightjade Complete Heaven fell into fanatic worship of Ye Yuan.

The current Ye Yuan had already been deified.

The miracle battles in the past had all been dug out by his worshipers.

Although he was only Emperor Vast Heaven Realm, in the eyes of those fanatic worshipers, he was invincible!

No matter how strong your opponent was, I could blow him up with just one punch!

Hence, the name Heavenly Saint Ye’ gradually spread in the Heaven One Alliance.

This limelight completely overshadowed Zhuo Bufan.

Of course, Zhuo Bufan, Cloudmount, and the rest had their own supporters.

But compared to Ye Yuan, that was far lacking.

At the same time, Heaven One’s counterattack was also actively being carried out.

Feng Xiaotian and the rest of the completely unscathed Hegemons led the Heaven One army and swept away the blood race’s remnant defeated troops.

Those who did not have Hegemon Realms could not stand up to a single blow in front of Hegemon Realm powerhouses at all.

A month later, the injuries of all the powerhouses were somewhat in remission, and they gathered together.

When Long Jian saw Ye Yuan, he bowed respectfully and said, “Paying respect to Heavenly Saint Ye!”

Hegemon Imperishable also bowed and said, “Paying respect to Heavenly Saint Ye! Heavenly Saint Ye is invincible!”

Feng Qingxuan also gave a deep bow and said, “Heavenly Saint Ye will live for generations to come and unify Heaven One!”

By the side, everyone from Heaven One tried their best to hold back their laughter.

Ye Yuan’s face became black as the bottom of a pot, and he said in a solemn voice, “There’s no fun if you all are like this!”

Long Jian said in surprise, “How can it not be fun? Heavenly Saint Ye’s punch is invincible. Although we are Supreme Hegemons, we have to be careful too!”

Ye Yuan’s teeth creaked from grinding, and he said with a cold smile, “When I step into Hegemon, I’ll definitely blow you up with one punch!

Long Jian smiled and said, “Don’t! You can blow me up with one punch right now. You don’t need to step into the Hegemon Realm at all!”

Ye Yuan waved his hand and said crossly, “Alright, alright, are you guys done yet! Now isn’t the time to make jokes! One reversal can’t turn the battle situation of all the heavens around! The most important thing now is to find Hegemon Samsara! I asked Hegemon Mi Tian that if there’s anyone in this world that’s his match, then there’s only Hegemon Samsara!”
