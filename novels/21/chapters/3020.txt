Chapter 3019: Arriving at the Battlefield!

“Hahaha?… Feng Xiaotian, we’ve fought for thousands of years! Today, you’re finally going to die! Thinking about it, there’s still some reluctance!” Above in the sky, Bloodpromise laughed loudly without ceasing.

Not long after Feng Xiaotian broke through, Bloodpromise also finally broke through to Hegemon Realm.

Speaking with which, these two were also considered enemies of a lifetime.

Feng Xiaotian snorted coldly and said, “If I die, you’ll have to be buried in death with me too!”

Bloodpromise laughed loudly and said, “With just the likes of you, you also want to drag me to be buried with you? You’re thinking too much!”

Feng Xiaotian fought fierce battles repeatedly. The injuries on his body were not light.

At this time, facing the besiegement of three great Hegemons, he was already lacking in strength, defeat showing.

Boom!

Bloodpromise took advantage when Feng Xiaotian and the other two Hegemons were fighting fiercely to suddenly launch a sneak attack, slamming a punch onto his chest.

Feng Xiaotian’s chest directly had a large hole blown out, blood gushing!

Feng Xiaotian’s gaze was cold. Clearly, he already had the awareness.

“Pffft!”

Big Yellow was pierced through by a blood race Emperor Cloud Heaven in order to save Jingfei.

His current strength was very strong, but after consecutive battles, they were long already arrows at the end of their flight.

This time, the enemy even numbered several times more than them. They could not see hopes of victory at all.

But nobody backed down.

Because they already had no path of retreat a long time ago.

Boom!

In the chaotic battle, a loud noise was heard.

The right arm that Yang Qing held his spear directly imploded.

Enduring the intense pain, only to see his divine essence sweeping, the long spear switching to his left arm as he continued the bloody killing.

The battle situation was tragic to the extreme.

“Qin Shan, you were already at the point of death earlier. Why haven’t you died yet? Is this the legendary scourge that will last a thousand years? Impressive! Impressive!” Yang Qing said with a look of regret.

Actually, Qin Shan was not far from death too.

But, after hearing Yang Qing’s goading, he actually regained some spirit.

“You … F*ck you! You’re the scourge! Your whole family are all scourges! But this time, this seat will see if you still don’t die!” Qin Shan used all the strength in his body as he roared angrily.

“Relax, even if I’m going to die, I’ll also die after you. You won’t get to see it!?Haha,?I feel that you can still be saved. Pray that Ye Yuan can come back! This punk likes to create some miracles. Maybe he can overcome the raging tides once again.” Yang Qing said with a loud laugh.

“Can’t you freaking live without Ye Yuan anymore? It’s already been over a hundred years. Will you die if you don’t mention Ye Yuan?”

“Someone like you won’t understand! If there’s no goal in life, what’s the difference between being alive and being a salted fish? I, Emperor Azuresky, have once been invincible under the heavens. Experts are desolate! This guy is my lifetime enemy. He won’t die so easily!”

“A traitor is a traitor! If he comes back, this seat will be the first to kill him!”

“Oops,?you’re dead!”

The two people seemed to be bickering effortlessly, but actually, the battle was incomparably dangerous.

While talking, five blood race Emperor Vast Heaven powerhouses had actually formed an encirclement unknowingly.

With five people attacking at the same time, a terrifying power exploded in an instant!

Qin Shan was long already at the point of death. Facing such an attack, how could he still block it?

Yang Qing was still cheeky and frivolous verbally, but a hint of dejection flashed across in his eyes.

These few years, Qin Shan had also been his comrade-in-arms who fought side by side with him.

Although this guy was hateful, he would not fall short of requirements when fighting and also would not be a hindrance. He was a real man.

It was just that everyone had different ideals in the past.

Boom!

The place where Qin Shan was standing erupted with a dazzling light, blinding until people felt their eyes blurring.

“Haha,?human ants are really weak!”

“This Qin Shan was really useless. He wass too weak to stand up to competition!”

“Yeah, among Emperor Vast Heavens, he’s the weakest! This kind of trash should have long died in our blood race!”

… …

The few blood race Emperor Vast Heavens could not help but feel pleased with themselves when they killed Qin Shan.

However, they indeed felt that Qin Shan was very weak.

On humanity’s side, the most difficult to deal with was Yang Qing.

“Weak your mom! Your Father will exterminate you!” Yang Qing blew his top at once.

“Yang Qing, don’t be anxious. The next one will be you!” An Emperor Vast Heaven said with a loud laugh.

Very soon, the light dissipated.

Qin Shan looked at himself with a vacant look and said, “I … I’m not dead?”

All around, the Emperor Vast Heavens were dumbstruck with amazement!

Beside Qin Shan, a figure stood proudly, and he actually blocked all of the attacks!

This person said with a light laugh, “Fortunately, I made it in time!”

Qin Shan’s entire body shook, and he cried out in surprise, “I-It’s you! Ye Yuan, you … you’re back!”

This person was naturally none other than precisely the Ye Yuan who returned from Voidshrine Illuminating Heaven!

Passing through the barrier of heavens, Ye Yuan understood the collapse of the Absolute Heaven Barrier very soon.

Extreme Medicine Sect’s people were currently fighting fiercely in West Sun City.

Hence, he rushed over without stopping.

Finally, he made it!

Yang Qing’s entire body also shook, his gaze revealing a look of astonishment.

This guy really came back!

“Ye Yuan! You’re finally back!”

“Haha,?I knew that Big Brother Ye Yuan will come back!”

“Young Master, it’s really great!” Big Yellow wept with excitement.

… …

When everyone saw Ye Yuan return, each and every one of them was extremely agitated.

Qin Shan’s heart shook violently. Just now, five great Emperor Vast Heavens joining hands, the power was overwhelming!

Even if it was Yang Qing, he absolutely would not dare to resist it head-on too.

But Ye Yuan actually blocked it with ease?

How terrifying was this guy’s strength now?

Suddenly, Qin Shan could not help feeling bitterness.

Yang Qing this damn thing was really a jinx!

Your Father really got freaking saved by Ye Yuan!

How freaking ironic!

However … being able to live was really great!

“Eh, isn’t this our Lord Blood Divine Son? I heard that our Lord Blood Divine Son had once overcome the raging tides several times. It’s really amazing! However, you want to turn the tides by coming alone?” A blood race Emperor Vast Heaven said with a loud laugh.

Ye Yuan had a great reputation in the blood race.

Many blood race Emperor Realm powerhouses knew about his existence.

This Emperor Vast Heaven clearly recognized Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan gave him a nonchalant glance and said, “Who told you that I came alone? Zhao Yue, you go and help Feng Xiaotian! Jiang Zhennan, kill for me! Spare no one!”

Talking until the back, Ye Yuan was already seething with killing intent.

The appearances of Yang Qing and the rest had long already entered his sight.

Even the naive Jingfei back then was also full of wounds and scars now.

Ye Yuan did have any favorable impression of the blood race at all.

The moment his voice faded, one astonishing aura after another suddenly erupted in the distance!

These auras were berserk to the extreme; incredibly bloodthirsty!

Then, people saw one monstrous looking creature after another galloping at full speed over here, the speed swift to the extreme.

“W-What powerful auras! These guys are all Emperor Sakra Heaven!”

“More than half are all origin powerhouses!”

“This … How scary!”

… …

When the blood race saw this level of impetus, they were actually dumbstruck with fear for some time.

When those bloodline warriors felt the aura of the blood race, each and every one of them became irascible to the extreme.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Several bloodline warriors tore a few Emperor Sakra Heavens to shreds in one exchange.

Those few Emperor Sakra Heavens recovered very quickly. They were torn to shreds by the few who caught up with them. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Hundreds of bloodline warriors charged onto the battlefield with astonishing power, akin to a no man’s land!
