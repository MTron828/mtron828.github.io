Chapter 1245: The Might of a Deity Realm Powerhouse!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The moment this old man appeared, Ye Yuan felt a dangerous aura hit him head-on.

That kind of feeling was like facing Fang Tian.

The first feeling that this old man gave Ye Yuan was that the former was strong.

Very strong!

However, the closer he approached this cave, the faster Ye Yuan’s heart beat.

Now, Ye Yuan felt like his heart was almost leaping out of his throat.

This feeling of heartbeat was absolutely not given to him by this old man.

“Ye Yuan, don’t be insolent!”

Right at this time, Ao Li, as well as the four clans’ head elders, also rushed over.

Ye Yuan could not be bothered with them at all. Right now, he only wanted to enter that cave.

“Senior, Ye Yuan has no intention of disturbing, I just want to enter this cave to take a look, is it allowed?”

Ye Yuan forcefully calmed his emotions and used a discussing tone to talk with this old man.

“This place is this old man’s seclusion place. There are no other things. Moreover, requesting like this, don’t you feel that it’s rude?” the old man said coolly.

Ye Yuan thought about it and said, “Junior knows that this action is rather brusque, but Junior has a reason that he must go in! If it trespasses on Senior’s hospitality a little, Junior is willing to compensate afterward.”

Past life and this life, over 500 years, Ye Yuan had never had such a strong impulse to enter a place before.

He was certain that this cave absolutely had a huge connection with him!

“What a joke! How can the old ancestor’s seclusion place be allowed for you to profane?” Ao Li said in a cold voice.

Ye Yuan glanced at him and said indifferently, “None of your business here, it’s not your turn to speak!”

“You!” Ao Li was livid with rage.

The old ancestor gestured at Ao Li to stop talking and looked toward Ye Yuan as he said coolly, “Little friend, there are quite a number of my Four Symbols Family Clans’ secrets inside the cave. You possess the azure dragon bloodline, having a resonance is also normal. If you’re of the dragon race, it’s also not impossible for this old man to let you go in. But you’re just a human!”

Ye Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly. This old ancestor’s words sounded as if it left no room for criticism. Furthermore, the rejection was also very reasonable.

But no idea why, Ye Yuan just wanted to go in.

That kind of strong psychological hint shattered the old ancestor’s words to pieces.

Ye Yuan’s palm flipped, a fire rod appeared in his hand.

The powerful dragon pressure coming off the fire rod made everyone’s countenance change.

At this moment, the old ancestor who was always calm finally lost composure!

“S-Sacred Dragon Token! Back then, the old patriarch took it away, and it never appeared again. How could it appear in your hands?” The old ancestor said in astonishment.

“Put aside how it’s in my hands, since you say that there are the Four Symbols Family Clans’ secrets inside this cave, I wonder if I have the qualifications or not to enter and check it out by relying on the Sacred Dragon Token?” Ye Yuan said coolly.

The old ancestor’s face flickered incessantly. He never thought that Ye Yuan actually still possessed such a sacred object.

Seeing the Sacred Dragon Token was akin to seeing the patriarch, even he was unable to defy the ancestral teachings too!

Rather, the other four symbols clan members, inclusive of Ao Li, all had blank looks.

They knew that this Sacred Dragon Token was definitely not an ordinary object. But they all grew up in the Divine Beast Realm and did not understand the significance that the Sacred Dragon Token represented.

“Ancestor, what is this item?” Ao Li could not refrain from asking.

An item able to make Old Ancestor visibly moved was absolutely no ordinary object.

“This is the Sacred Dragon Token, our dragon race’s supreme divine artifact! The dragon race’s ancestral teachings: the person who possesses this token is the dragon clan’s lord!” the old ancestor said in a solemn voice.

The old ancestor’s words made everyone’s faces change.

Ao Li was stunned and looked towards Ye Yuan in surprise, and said, “A human becoming the lord of the dragon clan, how can it convince people?”

“Heh, just a human is it? My big brother’s bloodline is purer than any of you, based on what that he can’t convince the masses? In the Divine Realm, my big brother is already the lord of the human race! You probably don’t know, this Sacred Dragon Token doesn’t simply choose its master. Even if my big brother gives it to you, it’s impossible for it to acknowledge you as its master too!” White Light said disdainfully.

Ao Li’s expression changed, and he could not resist looking over toward the old ancestor for affirmation.

The old ancestor slowly nodded his head, considered as tacitly approving of White Light’s words.

Ao Li’s face was ashen. He was seriously unable to accept this fact.

“Senior, do you still have any doubts now?” Ye Yuan looked towards the old ancestor with a scorching gaze.

The old ancestor mused for a moment and slowly said, “Since you obtained the Sacred Dragon Token’s acknowledgment, this old man naturally serves you as the lord! It’s just that this cave ... you can’t go in!”

The old ancestor’s words made Ye Yuan’s expression change.

He did not think that this old man actually did not even give face to the Sacred Dragon Token.

But it was precisely because so that Ye Yuan was even more certain that there must be some secret inside!

Ye Yuan put away the Sacred Dragon Token and said coolly, “Alright, this Ye got it. Since that’s the case, this Ye will be offending!”

Finished talking, Ye Yuan’s figure instantly vanished from where he was.

Art of greater teleportation!

But this time, there was someone faster than him!

At virtually the same time, the old ancestor’s figure also disappeared from where he was.

Similarly, it was the art of greater teleportation!

Boom!

In the time it took for sparks to fly off a piece of flint, Ye Yuan forcefully exchanged a blow in the void with the old ancestor, but his figure was shocked out of the void, flying straight for ten thousand feet before forcefully stabilizing his figure.

This old ancestor’s strength was indeed terrifying powerful!

However, the old ancestor was unable to stop Ye Yuan’s determination to enter the cave. Lifting his hand, it was a Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!

“Heh, being able to comprehend divine rank dragon wave at a young age, truly a genius! But using it to deal with this old man is inadequate.”

The old ancestor smiled faintly and similarly smacked a Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm out!

One palm unleashing, even Ye Yuan’s countenance changed because of it as well!

Boom! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After a frontal-clash, even if Ye Yuan’s defense was exceedingly powerful, he was also battered by the other party until he spewed out a large mouthful of blood.

“Is this the strength of a deity realm powerhouse? Indeed, it lives up to its reputation! It’s just a pity that there’s no longer Divine Dao under this heaven!”

Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh, the Evil Extermination Sword suddenly moving out!

“Fury Sword Fire Lotus!”

Ye Yuan’s sword intent advanced greatly. Fiery’s Cleansing Sandal Sacred Flame also could not be compared to before.

This Fury Sword Fire Lotus was already not its former power.

When Ao Li saw this scene, his expression became incomparably ugly.

It turned out that when Ye Yuan was dealing with him, he did not use his full strength yet!

The Fury Sword Fire Lotus, after evolving, was more than a grade stronger than the divine rank Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm!

“Careful, Ancestor!” Ao Li shouted.

He knew that the ancestor was formidable, but facing such a terrifying attack, whether or not the ancestor could block it, he had no assurance in his heart either.

However, the old ancestor just smiled faintly. A Coiling Dragon Heaven Devastating Palm pushed out once more!

The might of this palm was actually even greater than the palm before!

Boom!

One come, unleashed; Ye Yuan was sent flying once more.

After two palms, Ye Yuan already suffered considerable injuries.

“Senior’s Deity Realm laws are splendid! It’s probably also not far from Heaven Glimpse Deity Realm, right?” Ye Yuan said in a low voice.

The ancestor smiled faintly and said, “Not long after this old man broke through to the Deity Realm, this world’s laws already went missing. With nothing to do these few years, I could only comprehend some Divine Dao laws as well. How is it? Still want to go in?”

Ye Yuan sucked in a deep breath and said, “Final move, if senior can block it, this Ye will retreat here!”

“Huhu, Junior, you’re very strong! But right now, you’re still not this old man’s match, fall back! When your strength is there, coming to find this old man again isn’t too late,” the old ancestor shook his head and said with a smile. He clearly did not think that Ye Yuan could win him.
