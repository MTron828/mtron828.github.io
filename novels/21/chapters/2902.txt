Chapter 2908: Tearing Through Space and Leaving!

“Alright …”

Hegemon Cloudmount mused for a long time but finally still agreed.

Very clearly, this was the best way.

To really fight it out to the death, that was not the situation that he wanted to see.

Otherwise, how could he have guarded this Absolute Heaven Barrier for thousands of years?

But for Ye Yuan, he would rather fall out with the Hegemons!

Hearing Hegemon Cloudmount agreed, everyone including Divine Lord let out a long sigh in relief.

To really talk about strength, even if Hegemon Cloudmount was not as strong as Divine Lord, he was also not far off.

The two were both the most apex Hegemon Realms.

Once this kind of core figure erupted, then Heaven One Alliance would be completely finished.

It seemed like Ye Yuan leaving became the best option.

Ye Yuan looked at Hegemon Cloudmount as well as Zhou Pinespring they all, and he cupped his fists as he said, “Many thanks, Master, as well as the trust of Senior Apprentice Brothers. At most 100 years, within a hundred years, Ye Yuan will definitely rush back and fight shoulder to shoulder with everyone and eradicate the blood race!”

Hegemon Cloudmount flicked his sleeves, and the unfriendly look on his face grew thicker as he said cynically, “Everyone says that the bow is cast aside once the birds are god. The bird isn’t dead yet, and some people already want to kick the bow out after its services are no longer needed, cutting off their own arm. What a joke! What bullsh*t trust. Don’t look at whatever Heaven One Alliance; actually each and every one is harboring ulterior motives! If this was not the case, how could Heaven One not be able to even give birth to a single Hegemon Realm for thousands of years??Heh heh?…”

This sarcasm, if somebody else said it, they would definitely be smacked to death by the Hegemons.

But no one dared to rebut Hegemon Cloudmount’s words.

Even Divine Lord had to bottle it up too!

Right now, under this sort of situation, they could not trigger this old man anymore.

The more they said, the more severe the consequences would be.

… …

Under a huge ore vein, the barrier of heavens that led to the Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven was hidden!

This barrier of heavens was extremely hidden. It was hard for ordinary martial artists to reach it too.

However, to these Hegemons, it was naturally not considered a secret.

Passing through the barrier of heavens was an extremely difficult thing.

Not reaching Hegemon Realm, it was incredibly arduous to want to pass through the barrier of heavens.

Even if it was a Hegemon Realm, tearing through the boundary and heading to other planes was also not something that could be done casually.

Hegemon Cloudmount’s true body came!

The other Hegemons also sent clones over, witnessing Ye Yuan’s departure.

Not seeing Ye Yuan leave with their own eyes, they could not set their minds at ease.

Regarding this, Hegemon Cloudmount naturally turned his nose up in disdain.

Of course, Hegemon Cloudmount being able to leave temporarily was also thanks to Ye Yuan.

This series of shocking victories beat the blood race until they could not catch their breath. That was how he could leave temporarily.

“I didn’t expect that you’re actually going to Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven, that is the territory of the soul race! However … Master has once visited the various heavens and myriad worlds. Nihility Exceeding Balance Heaven has many Hegemons who owe this old man a favor too! Bring this thing along with you. If you really run into some trouble, go and find those few old things. They will naturally make a move and help you!”

As he said, Hegemon Cloudmount passed Ye Yuan a long-stemmed tobacco pipe.

Seeing this long-stemmed tobacco pipe, Zhou Pinespring and Li Clearcloud’s eyelids quivered, revealing disbelieving looks.

The other Hegemons had shocked faces too.

Hegemon Cloudmount was a major smoking addict. This long-stemmed tobacco pipe was called Treasured Glass Tobacco Pouch. It was his lifeblood!

This thing had followed him for god knows how many years already. It had never left him! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Although because of material limitations, it could only be promoted to grade four grandmist treasure quality in the end, it held extraordinary meaning to Hegemon Cloudmount!

Today, he actually gave this treasure to Ye Yuan!

It could be seen how highly he valued Ye Yuan.

Ye Yuan was not a fool either. He could tell the value of this item from the other people’s expressions.

He shook his head and said, “No way, this thing is too valuable. This disciple can’t accept it!”

Hegemon Cloudmount glared and said in a solemn voice, “Just take it when I ask you to. What’s with all the crap? A lousy grade four grandmist treasure, this seat doesn’t think anything of it!”

Seeing that Hegemon Cloudmount’s mind was made up, Ye Yuan hesitated for a bit but still accepted it and said, “Alright, then Disciple will accept it! Master, rest assured; I’ll definitely bring it back,”

Hegemon Cloudmount said impatiently, “Already said, just a piece of crap. If it’s thrown away, it’s thrown away. Could it be that this seat would still care? Alright, stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and get lost! I can’t leave the Absolute Heaven Barrier for too long!”

Ye Yuan put the Treasured Glass Tobacco Pouch away and nodded slightly as he said, “Then, I’ll have to trouble Master!”

Hegemon Cloudmount said, “Kid, this barrier of heavens isn’t an ordinary existence. This seat can’t send you across the boundary at all! The pressure in the chaos will crush you into a meatloaf!”

It was naturally no big deal for Hegemon Realms to pass through the barrier of heavens.

But Ye Yuan’s strength was too weak. Even if there was Hegemon Cloudmount’s help, he had to withstand tremendous pressure too.

This pressure was sufficient to crush him to death!

Ye Yuan smiled and said, “Master, rest assured; this disciple naturally has his means!”

Hegemon Cloudmount nodded and said,?“Mn,?in a while, I’ll forcibly break through the barrier of heavens. But, while I say that it’s breaking through, actually, a Emperor Vast Heaven will also find it difficult to bear the pressure inside! Furthermore, there’s only a brief 15 minutes!”

Ye Yuan nodded and said, “Master, please cast the spell!”

Hegemon Cloudmount stopped being long-winded and urged his powers to start tearing through the boundary!

He also really wanted to see just what means Ye Yuan had, to pass through the barrier of heavens!

The other Hegemons actually did not really believe it.

Therefore, that was why they did not care about Hegemon Cloudmount’s biting sarcasm, insisting on coming over to take a look.

If this Hegemon Cloudmount deliberately went easy and said that Ye Yuan left, but he actually did not leave, then the problem would be huge.

The barrier of heavens isolated the 33 Heavens, making the 33 Heavens each become a world.

Want to pass through the barrier of heavens, not unless one’s strength reached the Hegemon Realm.

Of course, origin Emperor Sakra Heavens also had the strength to pass through the barrier of heavens. It was just that the price was too high. No one was willing to attempt it.

Hegemon Realms could forcefully tear through the boundary.

If dozens of Hegemon Realms joined hands, they could even completely link up two worlds, letting people with meager strength forcefully pass through the planes.

Back then, that was how the Labyrinth Divine Palace swept across the 33 Heavens.

And that battle also alarmed the Hegemons in all the heavens, setting off a shocking great battle of Hegemons.

But, a single Hegemon Realm, even if it was a powerhouse like Hegemon Realm Cloudmount, he was unable to completely open up a passageway.

The powerful pressure in the barrier of heavens was sufficient to crush a puny little True Sovereign Heaven like Ye Yuan into minced meat.

Therefore, they did not believe it!

Boom!

A terrifying energy undulation directly infiltrated the barrier of heavens.

Amidst that thick stretch of chaos, an opening was forcefully opened up.

It was just that the region of chaos was still very dense.

Furthermore, that passageway that was being forcibly opened up was currently healing at a rate visible to the naked eye!

Ye Yuan cupped his fists towards Hegemon Cloudmount and the rest and said, “Master and Senior Apprentice Brothers, take care. Ye Yuan is leaving!”

Finished saying, Ye Yuan immediately transformed into a true dragon and tore across the air!

Only to see Ye Yuan being akin to fish in water amidst that region of chaos, seemingly very comfortable!

That terrifying chaos pressure was actually unable to do anything to him!

All the Hegemons were dumbfounded from watching!

This kid really had so many tricks that it was appalling!
