Chapter 2046: Ye Yuan’s test

“Disciple is willing! Disciple Ning Siyu pays respect to Master!”

Ning Siyu had wild elation on her face, directly kneeling down toward Ye Yuan.

When she lifted her head again, Ning Siyu’s eyes already brimmed over with hot tears.

Ever since witnessing Ye Yuan’s breathtaking Alchemy Dao back then, Ning Siyu was deeply subdued by Ye Yuan.

Xuan Yu already could not teach Ning Siyu, so changing masters was long already due.

Except, how could wanting to enter Ye Yuan’s tutelage be such an easy thing?

Cultivating by Ye Yuan’s side these many years, she did her best, wanting to catch up to Ye Yuan’s footsteps, wanting to obtain Ye Yuan’s approval.

It was just a pity that the gap between Ye Yuan and her became bigger and bigger.

All the way until today, she finally obtained Ye Yuan’s acknowledgment, so how could Ning Siyu not cry with joy?

“It turns out that ... Ning Siyu was really just Grandmaster Ye’s maidservant!”

“A measly little maidservant already has such terrifying strength. Grandmaster Ye’s ability in teaching apprentices is truly remarkable!”

“Sigh, it’s a pity that I couldn’t enter the top 20. Otherwise, I’ll definitely have to try. If I can become Grandmaster Ye’s disciple, that would really be soaring to the sky with one bound!”

...

In the plaza, several tens of thousands of gazes were gathered on Ning Siyu, envious to the extreme.

As for those 39 people, they were flustered beyond envy.

They did not know whether Ye Yuan would choose them or not, but they were willing to bet.

Once chosen by Ye Yuan, that would be soaring to the sky with one bound.

Since Ye Yuan was certain to step into the Ancestor Realm in the future, then what difference was there between choosing Ye Yuan and choosing an Ancestor Realm powerhouse?

On the grandmaster seats, Ye Yuan slowly nodded his head, accepting this kowtow calmly, then slowly opened his mouth and said, “As for the rest, all disperse.”

Everyone’s faces abruptly changed, looking at Ye Yuan in disbelief.

“Grandmaster Ye, this ... this ... please reconsider!” Luo Tianqi said with unwillingness.

Yun Yi clenched his jaws tightly, similarly with a look of unwillingness.

He required tremendous courage to stand here.

But Ye Yuan did not even give him a trace of chance.

The others opened their mouths one after another, all wanting to persuade Ye Yuan to change his mind. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ye Yuan’s brows furrowed and he said impatiently, “Noisy!”

Everyone’s faces changed one after another, all shutting their mouths.

Ye Yuan said in a solemn voice, “If getting a place in the rankings can make you qualify to enter my tutelage, do you all think that Siyu will wait until today? Don’t mention this matter again!”

Ji Canglan’s incident left behind an indelible mark on Ye Yuan’s body. Hence, he would naturally rather go without than make do with something shoddy.

Ye Yuan did not doubt these people’s talents, but what has it got to do with him?

However great the talent, they were also just strangers to him.

These 39 people’s faces were ugly to the extreme.

Ye Yuan completely did not play the cards according to normal style!

In past periods, these geniuses were all very in-demand.

One should not look at how those grandmasters had a reserved manner. In reality, they valued the summit’s top few places very highly.

But Ye Yuan actually did not even take a look.

The group of grandmasters looked at this scene dumbfoundedly with their tongues tied. The geniuses that they could not even beg to come over, Ye Yuan actually cast them aside like a pair of worn-out shoes.

Heavenly Eagle Imperial City, this kind of place that suddenly rose up newly, what was most important were talents.

If Ye Yuan rounded them all up with one fell swoop and took all of these geniuses into his door, Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s strength would surely skyrocket.

Did this guy figure out the situation or not?

In the crowd, a person suddenly knelt down. When everyone looked, who could it be if not Yun Yi?

He kowtowed toward Ye Yuan and said with an austere look, “Grandmaster Ye, as long as I can enter your tutelage, Yun Yi is willing to do anything. Yun Yi only requests that Grandmaster Ye can give a chance.”

Empyrean Pilljade was angered until his expression was livid. This kind of situation was what he completely did not expect.

His own descendant did not take him as master but wanted to go under other people.

Forget that he wanted to enter other people’s tutelage, the other person did not even appreciate it.

Forget that Ye Yuan did not appreciate it, Yun Yi even had to go and beg him.

Where would his old face go?!

“Yun Yi? If I didn’t remember wrongly, you’re Brother Pilljade’s descendant?”

Yun Yi’s expression could not help stiffening as he said with a nod, “Yes, Lord Pilljade is Yun Yi’s great-grandfather!”

Ye Yuan looked toward Yun Yi and said with a smile that was not a smile, “Then if I make you break off all relations with Empyrean Pilljade, can you do it too?”

Once these words came out, everyone’s countenance changed visibly.

This move of Ye Yuan was too vicious!

Empyrean Pilljade even stood up quickly, pointing at Ye Yuan and saying furiously, “Ye Yuan, you’re too much!”

But Ye Yuan’s expression did not change and he said coolly, “I already said that I’m not taking in disciples. It’s him who wanted to enter my tutelage. I’m just stating my terms, as for whether or agree or not, it will depend on him.”

Finished talking, he looked toward Yun Yi and said coolly, “How about it?”

But Yun Yi shook his head and said, “Ancestor’s kindness of love and care is higher than the heavens. It’s impossible for Yun Yi to betray Ancestor. Your Excellency, please change your conditions!”

When Empyrean Pilljade heard that, his face revealed a smug look and he said with a cold smile, “My Yun Family’s good grandson! Ye Yuan punk, don’t you think about sowing discord between us great-grandfather and great-grandson!”

Ye Yuan completely ignored Empyrean Pilljade, but looked at Yun Yi and said smilingly, “If I only have this condition?”

Yun Yi sucked in a deep breath, slowly stood up, and said, “If it’s like this, Yun Yi would rather not acknowledge you as a master. Farewell!”

Finished talking, Yun Yi clasped his hands toward Ye Yuan and left without even turning his head back.

“If you want to acknowledge me as your master, go to the Heavenly Eagle Imperial City’s Pill Tower yourself. Put down all of your identities, and be a little medicine boy. Maybe one day, I’ll consider it.”

Just as Yun Yi turned around and left, Ye Yuan suddenly said lazily.

Yun Yi’s entire body trembled. Turning around, he looked at Ye Yuan in disbelief and said doubtfully, “Grandmaster Ye, is ... is this true?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “If you had any look of hesitation on your face just now, there would be no chance. Entering my lineage, conduct is number one, disposition is number two, and talent is only ranked third. If a person who can betray even his ancestor, what is he if not an ingrate?”

Yun Yi looked toward Ye Yuan in incredible shock, only then knowing that it turned out Ye Yuan was testing him.

If he was really moved earlier, he would lose this only chance instead.

Yun Yi prostrated toward Ye Yuan and said with pleasant surprise, “Disciple pays respect to Your Excellency. Yun Yi will go to Heavenly Eagle Imperial City right away!”

Ye Yuan nodded his head and did not say anything.

Yun Yi knelt down in front of Pilljade too and said, “Ancestor, Grandchild is unfilial, but Grandchild wants to seek his own Alchemy Dao. Grandmaster Ye is the best choice! I know that Ancestor is doubtful, but if you understand Ning Siyu’s battle achievements, it will all be clear!”

Finished talking, Yun Yi directly turned around and left without even turning his head back, leaving behind everyone with stunned faces.

Brilliant rays of light shot out of Luo Tianqi’s eyes and he also knelt down and said, “Your Excellency, can you also give Tianqi a chance?”

Ye Yuan said coolly, “You all, those who are willing can all go. But you all have to think properly and be prepared. This test isn’t easy to pass.”

When everyone heard that, they were overjoyed.

When Ye Yuan saw the situation, he just laughed mockingly in his heart.

These people were also looking down on his test too much. They were all young masters of influential families, so how could they endure this kind of hardship?

He reckoned that having 10% that could stay would already be pretty good.
