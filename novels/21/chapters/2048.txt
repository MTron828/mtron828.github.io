Chapter 2052: All-round Breakthrough!

“This ... how is this possible?”

Empyrean Proudcloud’s pupils constricted, with his expression changing wildly, looking at Ye Yuan who was at the center of the storm in disbelief.

This kind of thing should not happen at all!

Ye Yuan, he, was actually breaking through?

How could a person possibly last for as long as ten years inside such a horrifying Sea of Law?

The current Ye Yuan’s imposing aura was extremely exuberant, with his life force thriving. How was there still any appearance of a dead person?

Ten years had gone by. There were only a scanty few people left who were still waiting for Ye Yuan to wake up around Tianyue Plaza. Lin Tong was among them.

Seeing this marvelous sight, Lin Tong’s face showed wild ecstasy, his entire body was trembling in agitation.

“Hahaha! Grandmaster Ye indeed didn’t die! Indeed didn’t die! I knew that he wouldn’t die! He wouldn’t die!” Lin Tong said with near madness.

In these ten years, his mood fell to rock-bottom bit by bit. He even could not hold on anymore already.

But thinking of Ye Yuan’s grace to him, he still persisted.

Around Tianyue Plaza, one figure after another suddenly appeared.

Those Empyrean powerhouses that had not left Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital showed up one after another.

Actually, the majority of the Empyreans did not leave.

They benefited a great deal inside the Sea of Law. Naturally, the earlier they comprehended, the more they digested.

Hence, in these ten years, a majority of the people all stayed behind in Cloudpill Great Imperial Capital.

At this time, everyone’s faces were full of marvel.

They never would have thought that not only did Ye Yuan come back to life, but he also even caused such a huge commotion.

Looking at this, Ye Yuan’s breakthrough was not simple!

This kind of commotion was far stronger compared to breaking through to Fourth Firmament True God!

“Grandmaster Ye really can’t be gauged with common sense! Who could have thought that he was still for ten years? Not only did he come back to life, but there’s also even such a huge breakthrough.” Empyrean Lumen lamented.

“Looking at this scene, the heaven and earth spiritual energy in the circumference of 100 thousand miles seems to have been drawn over by this Sea of Law. If it’s all absorbed, even if a Seventh or Eighth Firmament True God came, they would also blow up!” Empyrean Blazing exclaimed in admiration.

The commotion of Ye Yuan’s breakthrough was too vast. Even if these Empyreans saw it, their faces changed slightly too.

While this bit of spiritual energy was nothing in their eyes, when placed in True God Realm, it was absolutely horrifying.

“He started absorbing spiritual energy!”

An Empyrean opened his mouth. Everyone held their breaths.

They all wanted to see just how far Ye Yuan could go.

At this time, in the center of the storm, Ye Yuan revolved the Chaos Heavenspan Canon frenziedly and started swallowing like a whale.

Ye Yuan thought, after ten years of comprehending the Dao, finally I entered Ancestor Realm! According to my current accumulations, even if I break through directly to become a peak Sixth Firmament True God, there’s also not the slightest problem. It’s just that ... I don’t know if this spiritual energy is enough to use or not!

Even so, the seals that his hands were making were not the least bit slow.

One cluster of fog after another was directly absorbed into the body by him, and then being refined and stored in the Origin Pill.

That was time, it was one cluster after another, and not trace by trace.

With Ye Yuan’s accumulations, he could have broken through to become a Fourth Firmament True God long ago.

Presently, comprehending Dao for ten years inside the Sea of Law, this was a lucky chance that bystanders could only look but could not catch up to.

With his current accumulations, directly breaking through even reaching to be a peak Sixth Firmament True God would not have the slightest hidden danger.

His aura rose steadily up, breaking through to become a Fourth Firmament True God without any surprises.

Except, this was far from stopping yet!

The current Ye Yuan was like a gluttonous behemoth as if he could swallow the entire world in one mouthful.

The speed of the spiritual energy condensing actually could not keep up with his speed of absorbing.

Outside of the Sea of Law, the group of Empyrean powerhouses watched dumbfoundedly and tongue-tied.

“This ... Absorbing spiritual energy like this, isn’t he afraid of being stuffed until he explodes?” Empyrean Proudcloud opened his eyes wide and cried out in alarm.

“Stuffed until he explodes? Huhu, you don’t know, right? Ye Yuan has a perfect sixth transformation golden body! At the same time, he’s absorbing spiritual energy to increase his realm, and he’s also transforming his fleshy body! I’m afraid that ... he’ll complain that this isn’t enough!” Empyrean Flutterfeather gave Empyrean Proudcloud a sidelong glance and said with a cold smile.

Finished talking, without waiting for Empyrean Proudcloud to be surprised, he reached his hand out and beckoned, yelling, “Ye Yuan, this Empyrean will lend you a helping hand!”

An Empyrean making a move, the heaven and earth spiritual energy within several hundreds of thousands of miles seemed to have been spurred, swarming over toward Tianyue Plaza frenziedly.

Although Ye Yuan was formidable, his realm was after all too low.

He wanted to gather more heaven and earth spiritual energy but lacked the strength to match his will.

Suddenly, he heard Empyrean Flutterfeather’s bellow, and he could not help brightening up in his heart.

The surrounding spiritual energy actually turned into fine rain, falling down from midair!

But this spiritual energy fine rain would not land on the ground at all before being directly absorbed by Ye Yuan.

“Hahaha! Many thanks, Brother Flutterfeather!” Ye Yuan said in a clear voice.

With Empyrean Flutterfeather’s help, Ye Yuan’s aura soared straight to the highest heaven, his fleshy body and Martial Dao realm rising frenziedly at the same time.

At the same time, his divine soul also started fluctuating already, and actually started absorbing the Sea of Law!

Rumble!

Above the void, lightning flashed.

Ye Yuan’s essence, energy, and spirit, three paths breaking through at the same time, how outrageous was the commotion?

Empyrean Proudcloud cried out in surprise, “He ... He’s absorbing the Sea of Law! Is he mad?”

The other people’s faces were also struck dumb with amazement!

What was the Sea of Law?

Putting it bluntly, that was a part of Heavenly Dao. That was something that surmounted above all life.

Even Empyrean powerhouses only comprehended inside too, how could they dare to show the slightest hint of blasphemy?

But Ye Yuan actually wanted to absorb the Sea of Law!

“Hahaha! The sea is boundless. I’m only taking a grain of it! Absorb for me!”

Ye Yuan laughed heroically while absorbing the Sea of Law frenziedly, causing his divine soul to bolster up continuously.

While he was unable to absorb so much of the Sea of Law, just absorbing a little and strengthening his divine soul was achievable.

Dustless’s voice suddenly sounded out, “Ye Yuan, absorb more of the Sea of Law! Hurry!”

Ye Yuan did not have time to think too much. He just nodded slightly and poured a portion of the Sea of Law absorbed inside the Soul Suppressing Pearl. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

No idea how long had passed either, the surrounding heaven and earth spiritual energy was practically absorbed clean by Ye Yuan. His breakthrough ... finally stopped.

“He’s now a peak Fifth Firmament True God!” Empyrean Proudcloud’s pupils constricted, looking at that figure that walked over in astonishment, full of disbelief.

Ye Yuan did not even move for ten years. The moment he did so, it was earth-shattering, directly breaking through two minor realms, reaching peak Fifth Firmament True God!

One should not look at how it was only two minor realms. For the others, that required several thousands, even several tens of thousands of years of accumulation, before it could be achieved. How horrifying was the spiritual energy required?

But Ye Yuan merely used ten years!

What they did not know was that Ye Yuan made use of this boundless spiritual energy and also broke through to the late-stage sixth transformation golden body.

As for his divine soul, it even reached peak rank six already!

This breakthrough could virtually use a complete remolding to describe Ye Yuan.

The Empyrean Pilljade who had been silent all along, his gaze flickered incessantly, and said with vicissitudes of emotion, “Yun Yi, that kid, he bet correctly!”

“Huhu, Brother Flutterfeather, many thanks for your assistance! If not for you, this Ye’s breakthrough likely won’t be so smooth,” Ye Yuan took a few steps and arrived in front of Empyrean Flutterfeather and said while cupping his fists.
