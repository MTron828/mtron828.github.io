Above the Holy Mountain, the clouds were misty, the clear water was a deep blue and the top of the mountain was capped with snow.

The Holy Mountain was the highest peak in the Upper Realm. The green grass at the bottom of the mountain was crisp. It was spring all year round with the white flowers blooming all over the mountain. The higher it was, the lower the temperature. There was only one way to the top of the snow capped mountain. There were a number of elite soldiers in black armor stationed at the foot of the mountain all year round. The armies from the 72 cities were not their match.

This army belonged directly to the sole ruler of the Upper Realm. It was a team of guardian soldiers specifically sent to safeguard the safety of the maidens.

The Sacred Maiden Tribe held a high status in the Upper Realm. All previous maidens had been valued by His Lord. Its powerful psychic force was beyond the reach of many powerful men. Only the maidens could possess the powerful psychic force but their spirit energy was a different story. With years of isolation from the world, the Sacred Maiden Tribe was in an embarrassing state. In the Sacred Maiden Tribe, there had never been a one who possessed a strong spirit energy. This was why this team of elite soldiers was sent to guard the maidens.

From this, we could see the importance of the Sacred Maiden Tribe to His Lord.

Before stepping onto the Holy Mountain, permissions were needed from the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Even the elite soldiers who were stationed at the foot of the mountain were not allowed a step into the Holy Mountain!

On the snow-capped Holy Mountain, those pure white buildings were elegant and delicate. This was a place dedicated to the residence of the maidens. There had been rumors that the bricks and stones used by the maidens to build their houses were the finest white spirit stones. These white spirit stones were valuable even in the Upper Realm. If they were owned by ordinary people, they may never see it once in a lifetime. A thousand years ago, the first city, the White Night City spent a lot of money to buy a piece of large white slab stone.

It was said that white spirit stones had a strong effect on improving and enhancing psychic force. Even if the maidens had not gone through any cultivation at all, and the strength of psychic force could be counted as middle class force in the Upper Realm. But if it were to be compared upwards, there were still racial characteristics limitations. So far, only few people could feel the state of condense spirit inscriptions.

The Sacred Maiden Tribe sacrificed spiritual energy cultivation and specialized in psychic force. This had given them a special status. Therefore, the Sacred Maiden Tribe had been adhering to this tradition for thousands of years.

The Holy Mountain was a place that many strong men look forward to. Every master with strong spiritual power yearned to cultivate his spiritual strength in the Holy Mountain. However, many could only remain at the foot of the mountain staring at the peaks covered by clouds.

Now, a team of carriages had arrived at the foot of the Holy Mountain. The only route to the mountains was heavily guarded by the team elite soldiers which they would not easily release any pass through. After taking the token, The elite soldiers could only release them after a maiden from the first horse carriage had collected the authority token.

Duan Qi got up from the carriage, looked up at the top of the Holy Mountain. She turned to look at the carriages behind her and secretly glared at Han Shu and others who were standing beside her.

Han Shu immediately understood what Duan Qi meant. She joyfully walked towards the carriage where Jun Wu Xie was riding. She whispered softly in front of the carriage: “Lord Yan, we have reached the foot of the Holy Mountain. The Holy Mountain is steep and the carriage impassable. Lord Yan, please alight, we will need to continue the rest of the journey by foot. ”
