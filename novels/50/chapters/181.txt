Chapter 182: “Might of Qing Yun Clan (4)“

The carriages from the Qing Yun Clan stopped outside the Imperial Palace. The guards were prepared and stood in formation in welcome. Standing before the Palace, Mo Qian Yuan was dressed in his dragon robe, smiling at the guests.

Qin Yu Yan stepped off from her carriage, her peerless beauty attracting countless eyes.

“A very revered welcome to Miss Qin.” Mo Qian Yuan did not show any haughtiness as the Emperor, and stepped up to welcome them with a smile.

Jiang Chen Qing frowned at the young Emperor, “You are the Emperor of Qi?” His tone devoid of any respect.

Mo Qian Yuan did not take offence, and laughed it off. “The former Emperor was in ill health, and handed down the throne, I am the current Emperor of the Kingdom of Qi.”

“You are Mo Qian Yuan?” Jiang Chen Qing asked.

“That’s right.”

With his reply, Jiang Chen Qing‘s expression turned frosty, and his spiritual power started to diffuse from his body. Mo Qian Yuan felt an overpowering oppression pressing down on him, making it hard for him to breathe.

“It seems what Yun Xian told us was true, you have collaborated with the slut from the Jun Family and wanted to bring harm to a disciple of the Qing Yun Clan!”

And Jiang Chen Qing was about to strike!

When Bai Yun Xian had relayed the message to Qing Yun Clan, she had mentioned that Jun Wu Xie had allied with the Crown Prince, Mo Qian Yuan. Now that Jiang Chen Qing had verified that the Emperor’s throne had fallen into the hands of Mo Qian Yuan, he had felt that was all he needed to know! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Elder, please allow me to explain! Who in the Kingdom of Qi dares to lay a ginger on Miss Bai? There is another reason why Miss Bai relayed the message like this to Qing Yun Clan, and the actual situation is totally different!” Mo Qian Yuan asked hastily, forcing himself to calm down.

“Allow him to finish, Uncle Jiang.” Qin Yu Yan who had remained silent interjected, stopping Jiang Chen Qing.

Jiang Chen Qing reluctantly restrained his spiritual powers, but kept his eyes fixed on Mo Qian Yuan.

Mo Qian Yuan heaved a sigh of relief inwardly, he had thought Bai Yun Xian to be reckless, but compared to Jiang Chen Qing, a lunatic who went for the kill immediately, Bai Yun Xian was a tame little rabbit.

Qin Yu Yan stepped forward, a gentle smile on her face.

“No need to worry, Your Majesty. Uncle Jiang was just worried for the safety of Yun Xian. If there is any misunderstanding, it’s better to resolve it early.” Qin Yu Yan voice tinkled like a mountain spring, and puts one at ease immediately.

Her mild tone of voice and her words filled with understanding, had the people around whispering with praise.

A worthy Eldest Miss of Qing Yun Clan, graceful and cultured, an outstanding lady!

“Eldest Miss, you have my gratitude for your grace. This actually concerns..... the Kingdom of Qi. The journey must have tired you out. Why don’t we rest within the Imperial Palace while we wait for Miss Bai, and everything can be made clear.” Mo Qian Yuan invited them with a smile, but could find no joy in his heart.

As the ruler of a kingdom, faced with the Qing Yun Clan, he was someone they can hit and kill at will. How shameful was that for a ruler?

Qin Yu Yan smiled and nodded, “That will be good. Thank you.”

“My pleasure, please.”

As Qin Yu Yan has spoken, the others kept their silence and followed suit.

Jiang Chen Qing gave Mo Qian Yuan a steely stare and said: “Don’t think you can pull a fast one here. When we get in the palace, and find that you have been dishonest in any way, I will have you know, the Qing Yun Clan is not to be trifled with.” With that, Jiang Chen Qing followed after Qin Yu Yan into the Imperial Place.

Mo Qian Yuan looked on as the backs of the Qing Yun Clan people grew smaller in the distance. His back was drenched in sweat, from the tension from before. But it was not fear that gripped him as he clenched his teeth and continued looking at the haughty backs disappearing.
