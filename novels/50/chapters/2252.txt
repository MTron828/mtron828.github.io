Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The erratic spirit fluctuations that caused the air to twist all around them made the faces on those black robed men change immediately!

Waves of heat rushed out from Ren Huang’s body, it was as if his power had been multiplied by ten folds!

Jun Wu Xie had recovered a trace of consciousness as she weakly opened her eyes. Ye Mei was carrying her in escape, when she opened her eyes, she saw that ramrod straight back standing alone in the howling wind, blocking all those black robed men from taking a step further.

“Grand master....”

Boom!!

A loud bang resounded and it swallowed up the words of Jun Wu Xie as a bright glare exploded from where Ren Huang stood. The strong shock waves engulfed those black robed men who tried to escape. Almost in an instant, even the people from the Spirit Jade Palace and Ye Mei who were behind Ren Huang were sent flying!

The explosion was deafening and the bright glare devoured everything around it. At this moment, all there was left was scattered ashes and dispersed smoke...

Jun Wu Xie looked at the scene unfold before her with widened eyes, she was protected in Ye Mei’s tight embrace as the shock wave rushed towards them and hurled them out. The extent of the damage could not be determined and until the last moment, in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes, there was only that bright glare from that explosion!

Ren Huang’s self-destruction was mainly directed towards those black robed men in front of him but even so, the might of that explosion was so strong that it had also rushed out in all directions, even to those he seeked to protect!

Ye Mei did not know how far he had been flung off to but while he was in mid air, he had prepared himself and turned his body and gave it his all to cushion her from the fall using his own body. Jun Wu Xie was like a burning candle at the end of its wick and with the impact from this huge shock wave, she had already fallen into deep consciousness...

....

Not knowing how much time had passed, Jun Wu Xie roused and the stinging pain all over her body and it made her feel that everything was like a dream yet it seemed so real.

“Young Miss.” She heard a familiar voice beside her.

Jun Wu Xie mustered her strength as she shifted her gaze. She was surrounded by darkness and could only see those clusters of flame that had illuminated the surroundings dimly.

A vague figure stood by her side and she was stunned momentarily. However, when she saw who that person was, her heart sank immediately. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Young Miss.” Ye Sha went down on one knee while Ye Gu who was by his side did similar, the two of them had lowered the heads in silence.

“Young Miss, your subordinates have came to pick you up.” Ye Sha waited for a long while and seeing that Jun Wu Xie had not uttered a single word, he raised his head hesitantly. However, what met his eyes was her pair of bloodshot eyes, seemingly asking why did they come only now.

Ye Sha felt as if his throat was burning on fire as he lowered his head, not daring to meet her gaze.

“Young Miss, your subordinates did not appear before not because we are afraid of death but because Lord Jue had given us three a task. The three of us cannot defy the orders of Lord Jue, if Young Miss want to blame anyone, I am willing to bear any punishment. I only implore Young Miss to take care of your body!” Ye Sha forced himself to say all of this in a calm voice, only his clenched fists revealed his frustration and unwillingness.

Jun Wu Xie remained silent, she only looked at them coldly.

Ye Gu stood up slowly and said: “Young Miss, Lord Jue chose to sacrifice himself not because he had lost to the Upper Realm. Lord Jue had already arranged everything beforehand, I beseech Young Miss to continue on in his stead!”
