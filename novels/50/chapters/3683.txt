The elders of the Heavenly Wolf Temple were worried and had stayed up all night and dark circles appeared beneath their eyes. At last, they had finally received some good news!

The Night Regime once again struck and this time round, they attacked a division of the Obscure Soul Temple. They had washed the entire place with blood, however this time round, a Gold Spirit from the Upper Realm had fortunately escaped. Although he was seriously injured, he had managed to pick his life back from death’s door. He had faked his death and while doing that, he had inevitably heard the conversation between the members of the Night Regime. He had heard the next target of their attack – it was a division of the Heavenly Wolf Temple!

Upon hearing this news, all the elders of the Heavenly Wolf Temple did not dare to hesitate and immediately left to report directly to Qiu Yun.

After hearing this piece of news, a smile finally broke out on Qiu Yun’s gloomy face. And in that smile, there was a hint of madness.

“Very good, this can be regarded as the best news in this half a month. Pass my orders, all the disciples of the Heavenly Wolf Temple and the Gold Spirit teams are to convene, and after three days, they are to head to that division of the Heavenly Wolf Temple! I would like to see if those people of the Night Regime are really so formidable! Hmph!” Qiu Yun could not wait to kill all the people of the Night Regime. Being barraged by a continuous wave of sneak attacks without knowing where they would strike next, the losses incurred were heavy. What’s more, there was no progress in finding out their next target. If they continued to let the Night Regime go on like this, even if they had completed the Blood Sacrifice Array, he was afraid that even the prestige of the Nine Temples in the Middle Realm would all be greatly reduced.

Qiu Yun did not care for the power of the Nine Temples, but one had to see whom was the owner of the dog that they were beating. After being played a few times by the Night Regime, he was already filled with murderous aura.

“Qiu Yun, as for this matter... Do you want to notify Master Nangong?” An elder of the Heavenly Wolf Temple asked with apprehension.

There were two strong men sent by the Upper Realm to the Middle Realm, one of which was Qiu Yun, and the other was Nangong Lie. The strength of the two in the Upper Realm were famed and between the both of them, Nangong Lie has replaced one of the top ten masters. Entering the ranks of the top powerhouses, Qiu Yun’s strength was slightly weaker than that of the top ten masters, but he has also managed to condense the spirit ring, and his combat power was rather remarkable.

When he heard the name of Nangong Lie, Qiu Yun’s brow could not help but wrinkle.

Nangong Lie’s position in the Upper Realm was higher than that of his. Although the two were sent together to the Middle Realm but because of the disparity in their strength, Nangong Lie held the reigns of power. On the surface, Qiu Yun was respectful, but in his heart, he was not resigned.

“There is no need, it is just but a mere Night Regime. Don’t tell me that they have such skills that they would need Brother Nangong and myself to make an appearance? This would really give them a lot of face!” Qiu Yun scoffed as he spat his words out coldly.

Although the Night Regime had been continuously barraging them with surprise attacks, however in the eyes of Qiu Yun, they were just some trifling tricks. If the Night Regime was really capable, why did they not just head directly to kill off the nine Temple Lords? Instead, they had attacked all the minor divisions all around.

Towards the method of the Night Regime, he had not placed them in his eyes and had naturally not thought much of them. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“This....” That elder still wanted to say something but when he saw that Qiu Yun’s expression had turned a little ugly, he no longer dared to. He could only nervously say: “Master Qiu Yun speaks with reason, no matter how strong the Night Regime is, they are nothing compared to Master Qiu Yun. As long as Master Qiu Yun makes an appearance, getting rid of them would be as simple as stretching a hand out. Those of the Night Regime are definitely not Master Qiu Yun’s opponents.”

Qiu Yun nodded his head with satisfaction, if he could annihilate the Night Regime, at least he would have something to account for when he reported back to the Upper Realm. Otherwise, it would be a huge blame to bear for the destruction of all one hundred and eight palaces!
