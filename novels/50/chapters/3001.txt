Chapter 3002 A Tyrant’s Cruelty 2

A large number of souls and cruel rules, have created an outcome that pointed to only one goal.

“Indeed there are a number of ways.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed. Although she had yet to meet His Lord, from what she had seen so far, she could already tell what his intentions were, that person’s schemes ran deep, few in the world had intentions like his.

He had set up a Blood Sacrifice Array in the Middle Realm, leading people to believe that was the only way he could achieve the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. Secretly he had already begun to attack the Soul World, setting up an alternative route. He even used his total control of the Upper Realm as a last redundancy plan. This was to ensure that even if his main and alternative plans were scuppered by Jun Wu Xie, he still had a final lifeline.

That was the entire Upper Realm!

The souls of the large number of babies that perished every day when they could not survive the training were captured. Added to that, the capture of the equally large number of the souls of people who died due to the savage laws of the Upper Realm, led to a large increase in the huge number of souls being captured.

In the long run, even if he could not enter the Soul World, if he had captured enough souls, he could still achieve his goal of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms!

Either of the three methods, if successful would destroy the Three Realms. If even one of the things that had happened up to this point, whether it was Rong Ruo’s self sacrifice, the fact that he was a dual soul being, or that his main soul was pushed out of the body at the last moment or even that he was then made into a puppet and subsequently escaped, Jun Wu Xie would not have figured it out, no matter how intelligent she was.

It was even more difficult to find out about this plan that His Lord had.

Even the meticulous Jun Wu Xie, after figuring all that out, felt a cold chill down her spine.

“What kind of person would do this?” Jun Wu Xie sighed, she could not think of what benefit the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, which would leave the realms empty and shattered, had in order to drive someone to achieve it no matter the cost.

Just the part they were witnessing had already been in motion for over 10,000 years, spreading across the Three Realms. How long had His Lord been planning this? And how cruel was he to have such blatant disregard for human life?

Even his own subjects were brutally murdered to be used as pawns in his plan. Could he still even be considered a person?

Every additional thing she learnt about His Lord, gave Jun Wu Xie more stress. It was as though the final target was a man so huge that she found it difficult to breathe.

No wonder, even a person with Jun Wu Xie’s will, still ended up following His Lord. A person that could control every single thing in the Three Realms was difficult to deny.

In her silence, Jun Wu Xie took out the puppet from the cosmos sack, the beautiful puppet was motionless, just like a toy. But within that puppet was a soul, a real live soul.....

Jun Wu Xie thought about the puppet Bai Zhu, there were markings on its back that looked like Spirit Reinforcements that were familiar to Jun Wu Xie. However, when she checked on Rong Ruo’s back, there was only a black burnt patch in the place where the markings would have been.
