Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Bai Mo wanted to escape, but he was not willing to sacrifice all of his cultivation, no wonder Jun Wu Xie dared to leave him alone under the watch of Fan Zhuo, she had accurately predicted that Bai Mo would hate to part with the strength of his single Spirit Ring, she knew that before regaining his power, Bai Mo wouldn’t rush away!

Fan Zhuo looked at Bai Mo’s back with a smile and could not help but raise his hands and touch the tip of his nose. His attitude towards the “nephew” was really quite delicate.

On their way from the Sacred Mountain, Jun Wu Xie had sent Zheng Weilong, Ah Da, and Ye Mei and Ye Sha back to Sea Spirit City, and it was also an early message to Ye Gu from Sea Spirit City.

“Brother Fan?” Bai Zhu shouted suddenly while looking at Fan Zhuo’s back.

Fan Zhuo was a little surprised, he had not expected Bai Zhu to be back there again, but no matter how displeased Fan Zhuo was with Bai Zhu at that moment, Fan Zhuo’s face still had a gentle smile on it.

When it came to being pretentious, both of them were not joking.

“City Lord Bai?” What brings you here today?” Fan Zhuo asked with a smile.

Bai Zhu replied, “I’ve come to see my Lord, I wonder if he is resting in the room?”

Fan Zhuo shook his head, saying, “My Lord has some matters to attend to and left early in the morning.”

“I see, it looks like I have made the trip in vain.” Bai Zhu said, still smiling.

Fan Zhuo was not one to console people, fortunately Bai Zhu was not a fool and after knowing that Jun Wu Xie was not there, did not stay long.

“In that case, please allow me to trouble you to inform my Lord that I have come today.” Bai Zhu said.

Fan Zhuo nodded his head, smiling.

At that, Bai Zhu left.

Fan Zhuo felt that Bai Zhu’s behaviour was very suspicious. After all, with his status, it was really unnecessary. He, Rong Ruo and Hua Yao had been pondering this for a few days, but they could not think of a reason and could only return to the room and stare.

However, when Fan Zhuo turned around, he found Bai Mo that had already returned. He had no idea when Bai Mo had returned and now Bai Mo was standing boldly at the doorway, looking at Fan Zhuo with an undecipherable look.

“What’s up?” Fan Zhuo asked suspiciously.Read comics on our ReadRead.live

Bai Zhu pursed his lips and his eyes were a little hesitant. He said nothing and pushed open the door to his room. With one foot through the door, he paused and looked up at Fan Zhuo.

“There aren’t many good people from the Bai family, best you don’t believe too much of what they say.”

This sudden warning stunned Fan Zhuo slightly. He did not expect Bai Mo to say such a thing.

These words felt like there was concern behind them.

“Nephew...”

Bai Mo’s facial expression changed slightly and his eyes suddenly became alive!

“Thank you.” Fan Zhuo said with a smile.

Bai Mo suddenly looked angry and hastily entered the door.

“Who needs your thanks? I just cannot stand these hypocritical things, they are the tricks of the weak!” With that, Bai Mo closed his door in a huff.

Fan Zhuo stared at the locked door and was unable to stifle his laughter.

Bai Mo was getting cuter and cuter, no wonder Brother Wu Yao would adopt such a “son”. He seemed like an interesting person.

However, what exactly was Bai Mo warning him about?

Could Bai Zhu have some tricks up his sleeve?Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
