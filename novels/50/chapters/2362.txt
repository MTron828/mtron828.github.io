Although Situ Heng, Qin Song and Long Jiu were on the same mission, but because of Situ Heng’s personality, they weren’t very close. After Qin Song and Long Jiu reached an agreement, Situ Heng was livid and stayed that way for a long time. When Qin Song and Long Jiu taught Jun Wu Xie, Situ Heng scoffed at their efforts and did not show any interest nor did he help.

This time when the Spirit Lord had proposed for the three of them to help, Qin Song and Long Jiu were more than happy to, however as for Situ Heng.... Even the two of them were not confident that he would agree.

Situ Heng’s character was gloomy and stubborn, he would not change anything once he has made up his mind. In his eyes, be it Jun Wu Yao on Jun Wu Xie, they were the thieves that had stolen the Spirit Tree’s seed. If not for Qin Song and Long Jiu, he would have long targeted Jun Wu Xie’s weakness that year and struck out against her!

At this moment, Long Jiu could not help but worry. He looked at Qin Song’s grim face and looked once again at that sullen face of Situ Heng. He could not help but say, “Situ... Let’s just help that little lass, alright? After all, we do have an agreement between us. Moreover, if anything happens to her, it might hurt the seed of the Spirit Tree, then....”

Before Long Jiu could even finish his sentence, Situ Heng suddenly said, “Alright.”

The moment he said it out, Long Jiu’s face was frozen in shock. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He.....

He had actually agreed to it so easily?!

Long Jiu aside, even Qin Song was extremely taken aback by Situ Heng’s response.

He thought that he would need to waste quite a bit of saliva before he could persuade Situ Heng, but...

Situ Heng had agreed to it without much thought and this had indeed surprised Qin Song

“What? Don’t you all just want me to help? Now that I have agreed, why do you all look so confused?” Situ Heng’s gaze swept by Long Jiu and his lips curled up into a sneer.

Long Jiu hurriedly shook his head.

“No, no, no! Situ, you have really high principles! I, Long Jiu, admire such righteousness!” He really could not see that there would be such a day that he would see such a side of Situ Heng.

Situ Heng glared coldly at Long Jiu and no longer said anything.

Seeing that they had all agreed, the Spirit Lord felt relieved. In fact, if it was possible, the more souls that could participate in this would be better. This was because with Jun Wu Xie’s current strength, ordinary souls could not suppress the chaos in her body. Only the few of them who had been borne from the Spirit Tree, who had the purest soul could help. However, the power needed for each would be extraordinarily large and if even more powerful souls could be added into the equation, the effect would naturally be better.

“I shall arrange for tomorrow then, Miss Jun, please have a good rest today. Once you’ve started, you can’t stop. You can take this time and meet with your friends.” The Spirit Lord looked at her as he explained.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly, but her eyes swept past Situ Heng who had remained silent all this while.

It had been almost five years since she had met them and she was already familiar with the temperament of these three. She never thought that Situ Heng would have any kindness towards her.

Situ Heng had never once concealed his unhappiness towards her.

Only this time, Situ Heng’s reaction was somewhat unexpected.

She narrowed her eyes slightly and without anyone noticing, a glint flashed by her eyes.
