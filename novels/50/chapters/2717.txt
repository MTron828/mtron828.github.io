“Well, if they have that ability then let them research it.” Jun Wu Xie shrugged. The elixir had been formulated by herself and the composition was extremely complicated. She had also released the news, causing other cities to mistakenly believe that the elixir was made from Sea Spirit Beasts.

Letting them start off in the wrong direction, even if she gave them another ten years, it was highly probable that they still could not get the real formula.

Jun Wu Xie was not worried even if they found out the real formula.

Be it her, the Night Regime or the Ghost Army, they had all concealed their strength in the previous battle. Even if the 72 cities could develop the elixir, Jun Wu Xie was sure to crush them.

“To be honest, I gave these elixirs not only to you, but also to other cities, so it doesn’t matter.” Jun Wu Xie said faintly. Which of the spies who entered the city over the past few days did not do everything to try all sorts of ways to get their hands on this elixir? Jun Wu Xie was also very generous, so much so that the members of the Night Regime had let the elixirs on hand be “stolen” by the spies of the 72 cities.

It wasn’t only Moon Diminishing City.

Jun Wu Xie’s self-confidence made Zheng Weilong feel at ease and at the same time, she was surprised by Jun Wu Xie’s boldness.

She could see Jun Wu Xie’s current plan, but she couldn’t figure out why Jun Wu Xie wanted to do so, and she could not fathom her thoughts at all.

Since she had chosen this path, Zheng Weilong had no way out but to continue walking on it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I’ll do it then.” Zheng Weilong took the elixir and stood up to leave.

The spies in the 72 cities passed the news that they had uncovered in Sea Spirit City in the shortest span of time. Among them, East Peak City which was closest to Long Xuan City, got the news first.

“Ruan Zhongshan was actually killed by a kid from Sea Spirit City?” Dongfang Kubi read the news sent by his spies, his gaze was so intense that it was as if his gaze could pierce a hole through the letter.

East Peak City was very close to Long Xuan City and not far from Sea Spirit City. It is also one of the remote cities and had the same strength as Long Xuan City.

Dongfang Kubi and Ruan Zhongshan had met a few times. On the surface, they were polite and amiable. Since the two cities were equal in strength, they always compared against one another indirectly.

Even though the two were not happy with each other but there is no way to get back at each other.

Since the 72 cities had stabilized many years ago, the battles between the cities had gradually decreased. To this day, few cities proactively provoked wars against one another.

Because once a war broke out, things became complicated. Most of the neighboring cities have similar strength. If one want to attack the weaker cities in the vicinity, it would inevitably form a huge rift as they did not have enough manpower to both attack and defend at the same time.

It won’t be long before that city would be captured by other cities who would not standby idly.

And cities with the same strength have almost no courage to dare to fight each other. They were all of equal strength. Once they started war, the outcome was unpredictable. Even if they won, the damage on their side would not be small.

So the 72 cities had been staying away from war for many years.

The battle between Sea Spirit City and Long Xuan City broke this strange period of tranquility and caused the other City Lords in the 72 cities to start moving.

It was just that no one would ever have thought that the first one to break this peace would be the Sea Spirit City that was almost forgotten by all the other cities!
