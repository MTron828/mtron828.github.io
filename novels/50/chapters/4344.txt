Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Little Ruo !!!” Fei Yan watched Rong Ruo fading to the ground. His eyes were instantly congested with blood. He didn’t care about anything. He tried to use all of his strength to rush to Fang Jinghe, blocking the next blow from him! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

With only one blow, Fei Yan’s internal organs were as painful as if they were smashed into smithereens. But he did not step back. He blocked it in front of Rong Ruo, and the spirit inscription on his chest was already crumbling. A faint crack appeared.

Fang Jinghe stepped back. Like a tiger teasing prey, he watched Fei Yan and Rong Ruo.

The Spirit Ring Exponent. The reason why they could set foot on the top of the Upper Realm was precisely because of the powerful force. The spirit inscription and the spirit ring seem to be only one word apart. But the real difference was huge.

With only two blows, Fang Jinghe had already seriously injured Rong Ruo and Fei Yan.

At this moment, Fei Yan realized for the first time the gap between himself and the Spirit Ring Exponent. His own power was beyond ordinary people. But facing Fang Jinghe, he was so pale and weak. That pain seemed to remind him of the danger at all times.

Of course ...

The corner of Fei Yan’s eyes glanced at Rong Ruo behind him. She took the first blow of Fang Jinghe’s full strength and was not supported by the brute force of Fei Yan. With one blow, a large amount of blood had leaked from the corner of her mouth. The slender body trembled on the broken stone slab. She couldn’t even stand up.

Fei Yan had never seen Rong Ruo look so embarrassed. The trace of blood was imprinted in his eyes, like the magma burning his soul.

“Oh, the two of you indeed have some skills. You could still survive after taking a blow from me. I thought that it would be a very boring thing to kill the two spirit inscriptions exponent. You are better than my expectations.” Fang Jinghe looked at the embarrassing Rong Ruo and Fei Yan with contempt. In their eyes, such miserable looks were a pleasure to him.

Fei Yan wanted to help Rong Ruo up, but he didn’t dare to move. Fang Jinghe was too formidable. He was not fast enough to keep up. He was afraid. If he moved away, Fang Jinghe would take the opportunity to attack Rong Ruo again.

His physical strength was higher than that of Rong Ruo. His brute force had a little effect at this moment. Fei Yan’s mind was thinking quickly about the situation at this moment. In his condition, he may still be able to stand up to defend the second attack, but Little Ruo...

Fei Yan took a deep breath with one hand behind his back. He secretly made a gesture to Fei Yan.

Rong Ruo felt that her whole body was as painful as being beaten by someone. But when she saw Fei Yan’s gesture, she froze.

That gesture. She was most familiar with it. It was a gesture often used by the two when they were young and caught by Yan Bu Gui.

You go, I’ll follow behind.

The memories of childhood filled Rong Ruo’s mind instantly. She opened her eyes wide and looked at Fei Yan with uncertainty.

At that time, every time she and Fei Yan were caught by Yan Bu Gui. One person would always stand up to bear their master’s punishment. At that time, they also used this gesture to let the other party slip away.

But...

Rong Ruo rubbed her lips. There was no room for negotiation. Fang Jinghe wanted to kill them!
