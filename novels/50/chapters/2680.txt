Ruan Zhongshan was suspicious by nature. Even if the doctors had repeatedly confirmed that Xu Zu was unharmed, he had already believed in most of them. However, to ensure that the drug had no side effects, he still stayed in the city’s main residence and sent famous doctors to check Xu Zu’s physical condition regularly.

Xu Zu had some discomfort in the two days after he swallowed the elixir, but the discomfort was not a problem with his body, but a sudden surge of spiritual power that had a certain impact on his muscles and it took time to slowly adapt to the growth of this power.

After the discomfort subsided a little, the powerful strength in the body surprised Xu Zu very much, and he cooperated with the doctors every day.

With five days of cultivation, Xu Zu has been able to fully adapt to the changes in spiritual power. From an intermediate Gold Spirit and suddenly rising to the peak, it took only such a short time and such a miracle made Xu Zu wake up full of smiles.

And after Xu Zu’s situation gradually stabilized, Ruan Zhongshan’s heart also received a huge shock. His heart has been seized after he had affirmed that this elixir of the Sea Spirit City was really an incredible treasure!

It had also attracted some people’s attention with the frequent visits from doctors who had been seen entering and leaving the City Lord’s residence after Xu Zu started staying in there.

In a separate house in the manor, a woman with an ordinary appearance who was tall sat in a pavilion in the courtyard. The woman’s appearance was average and her figure was slightly thin. It was just those bright eyes that were captivating, however, in terms of appearance alone, even the servant girl who was standing behind her was better than her, but no one would judge her status by appearance.

“Miss, it’s been a bit uncomfortable in the city’s mansion recently.” The servant girl standing beside the woman whispered in the woman’s ear.

The woman raised her eyes slightly, with a hint of unpredictable emotion in her bright eyes. Her eyes swept across the flower garden not far away, and a gentle voice said: “Ruan Zhongshan’s actions during this time have been a bit abnormal. Have you let Ah Da checked it out?”

The servant girl whispered softly: “Ah Da has already checked it. It seems that some people have been arranged to live in the manor. I don’t know what the situation is. Many doctors have been in and out of the house in recent days, but the city guard is strictly guarded. Ah Da is afraid of exposing his whereabouts, so he didn’t dare to be too close. ”

The woman’s name was Zheng Weilong, the eldest daughter Discerning Moon City’s City Lord. She was ordered to visit Long Xuan City before January. Within one month, Ruan Zhongshan was very polite to her. However, from that day on, Ruan Zhongshan came less frequently, and Zheng Weilong noticed a slight anomaly, so she went down to check it out.

“Miss, I think that Ruan Zhongshan’s character is somber and unremarkable. He doesn’t look like a good person. The City Lord asked you to come to Long Xuan City, but how is this Long Xuan city comparable to our Discerning Moon City? Let’s head back. “The servant girl frowned as she said with contempt. Ruan Zhongshan seemed to be very considerate to Zheng Weilong, but those things were on the surface, and it was not difficult to detect the flattery.

Taking Long Xuancheng’s position in the 72 cities, compared with Discerning Moon city that was in the top ten, it is not enough to look at. Even if it comes up with the best things, it was not even one tenth of Discerning Moon City. The servant girl didn’t understand why the City Lord requested Zheng Weilong to visit Long Xuan City. Such a remote city had no use and was of no value at all.
