Chapter 2883: Holy Land (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Looking at the entire Holy Mountain, the most suitable place to cultivate psychic force is the Holy Place, where only a few special personnel of the Sacred Maiden Tribe were eligible to enter. Elder Yun’s praise of the Holy Land was endless. Jun Wu Xie’s ears were fully grown of callus. She could only pretend to be listening attentively to Elder Yun.

The Holy Land was located on the peak of the Holy Mountain, the highest place where the temperature there dropped extremely fast.

Elder Yun was wrapped in a cape. When he just set foot outside the Holy Land, he could not help to add on another cotton coat. However Jun Wu Xie was wearing just a simple and uncluttered suit. She was not affected by the cold.

“Here is the entrance to the Holy Land. Lord Yan, please wait for a while. The Holy Land has always been taken care of by my Elder Luo. For us to enter, we will need her consent.” Elder Yun said politely.

Jun Wu Xie gave a soft reply. She became curious about the woman who gave birth to Luo Qingcheng.

Luo Qingcheng’s temperament seems to be bold and a little distorted. Now she was still locked in a special dungeon in the Lower Realms, facing the unrecognizable face, was she happy?

Elder Yun stepped forward and knocked on the door. Although the holy place was named Holy Land, it was contained in a cave on the top of the mountain. The door of the cave was pure white and blended with ice and snow. You couldn’t tell if you did not look carefully.

The door opened slowly after the door rang. A woman in a pure white dress was standing inside the door. The woman had a beautiful face and a delicate face. She looked in her early twenties, but her eyes were different. She had an eerie expression that was indescribable. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Elder Yun had told Jun Wu Xie that only Elder Luo guarded the Holy Land. Jun Wu Xie couldn’t associate such a young woman with Luo Qingcheng’s mother. After all, the appearance of Elder Luo looked almost the same age as Luo Qingcheng.Her skin was even more tender.

“Elder Luo.” Elder Yun called out politely when she saw someone inside the door.

“Elder Yun? Why did you come to the Holy Land? I haven’t received any news that Elder Yun is going to cultivate in the Holy Land in recent days.” Elder Luo’s posture was proud and the pride in her brows was exactly the same as that of Luo Qingcheng!

Facing Elder Yun who was also an elder, she did not converge.

However, Elder Yun did not care: “Elder Luo has misunderstood. It is not me who is going to cultivate in the Holy Land, but the Lord Yan, a distinguished guest invited by Elder Duan. Your apprentice Yan Xi and him have a relationship. Now that he is part of our tribe, Elder Duan asked me to bring him to the Holy Land to cultivate. ”

After hearing that, Elder Luo glanced at Jun Wu Xie unceremoniously with a very critical look on Jun Wu Xie. She glanced up and down her body. She didn’t see what great about this young man other than his handsome looks.

“Duan Qi’s judgment is getting worse. Yan Xi has also become stupid these years.”

That cold tone and unabashed suspicion were clearly taunting Jun Wu Xie.

Elder Yun’s face suddenly changed, and she hurriedly said: “Elder Luo has said nothing. Although the Lord Yan is young, he’s the second strong man with a Dual Spirit Ring after His Lord in the Upper Realm!

Elder Luo’s face changed drastically upon hearing that!
