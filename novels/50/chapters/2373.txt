This was more than just a problem!

It was actually a huge problem!

The moment the Spirit Lord thought of the Soul Devourer being used on Jun Wu Xie, he began to tremble with fear. Luckily, Jun Wu Xie had already taken precautions. If not, once the Soul Devourer entered her soul, she would need to give up on half of the lifespan of her soul, or else the Soul Devourer couldn’t be removed completely!

“I am going to arrest Situ Heng now!” said the Spirit Lord with great anxiety. There were quite a lot of questionable points about Situ Heng. He would be so worried if he just let him stay at the Spirit World.

However, Jun Wu Xie raised her hand suddenly, stopping the Spirit Lord. The Spirit Lord was looking confusingly at Jun Wu Xie but she just slightly shook her head and said. “There’s no need to rush. He is not that stupid to brazenly mess with us in your Spirit World.”

“Well...” After the Spirit Lord thought about it again, he kind of agreed with her statement.

“Is the Soul Devourer the only way to destroy a soul?” asked Jun Wu Xie in a sudden. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Spirit Lord shook his head. “There are lots of methods to deal with a soul.”

“Is there a way to instantly kill a soul?” asked Jun Wu Xie again.

The Spirit Lord nodded.

A look of understanding appeared in her eyes.

“Don’t be too anxious about it then. I want to know if there is still any trick for him to play with.”

“Do you mean that... he’s still going to do something after this?” The Spirit Lord drew in a cold breath and gasped in astonishment.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes while casually stroking the black cat in her arms. “Situ Heng is way smarter than you think. I’m afraid that the reason he used the Soul Devourer on me isn’t as simple as just wanting to kill me. Just wait for a while, let’s see what he is going to do next.”

Following the advice of Jun Wu Xie, the Spirit Lord could only choose to bide his time and make no action. Even so, he had made his decision to send his people to keep Situ Heng under surveillance in order to prevent Situ Heng from doing evils.

The treatment for Jun Wu Xie was still going on. It was a total time of six and a half days for every single round. Qiao Chu and the others were also slowly getting used to the duration of Jun Wu Xie’s “special cultivation”.

During the time staying at the Spirit World, Jun Qing who was guarding in the Lower Realm would send them news everyday. Although Jun Wu Xie and the rest of them had returned to the Lower Realm, Jun Qing had still left some of the members of the Rui Lin Army in the Middle Realm so that they were able to observe the movement made by all parties anytime, anywhere.

One month had passed swiftly and all of a sudden, there came the latest news from the Middle Realm.

The Rui Lin Army who was hiding in the Middle Realm had discovered the troops from the Upper Realm. The general of the army was a cool and arrogant beautiful woman.

By the time the news was sent to Jun Wu Xie, she had just finished the fifth round of her treatment. While reading the message about the description of the Upper Realm troops, Jun Wu Xie narrowed her pair of eyes.

“The leading one, is that Luo Qingcheng?” After hearing about the news, Qiao Chu and the others immediately went to find Jun Wu Xie. The group of people read the message and they noticed the seriousness of the news by looking at Jun Wu Xie’s expression.

Luo Qingcheng. She was the one who was fully responsible for the tragedy that happened back then. The last thing Jun Wu Xie did when she washed the Nine Temples with blood was to spare Nangong Lie’s life so that he could bring her words back to the Upper Realm.

Jun Wu Xie had specifically mentioned that the person she wanted to meet was Luo Qingcheng.

If the Upper Realm wanted to get the soul bone, they must let Luo Qingcheng go to the Lower Realm while bringing Jun Wu Yao along with her!

This was a bait thrown by Jun Wu Xie to the Upper Realm and the Upper Realm had no other choice but to bite it!

And now, the bait had already shown the effect it should have .

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head a little.

“They have arrived at the Upper Realm. According to the observation of the Rui Lin Army, the amount of force that was dispatched by the Upper Realm was at least five hundred thousand... Such a force...” Fan Zhuo frowned deeply. It looked like the Upper Realm was serious. Previously, only a hundred thousand Gold Spirits were stationed in the Middle Realm, but this time, the amount of them that were coming to the Lower Realm amounted to five hundred thousand!
