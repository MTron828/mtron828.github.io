Jun Wu Xie was feeling slightly helpless. The gratitude and sincerity in Xue Er’s words was something she was unable to overlook. But Jun Wu Xie had never thought that she would gain such great gratitude from the Spirit Jade Palace. To her, she had merely kept her side of the bargain she had made initially. After the Twelve Palaces were destroyed, the Spirit Jade Palace was to be to be pushed to stand at the top. All of this had been the promise made between the Spirit Jade Palace Lord and her, hence, she did not feel that she had done anything that was worthy of such gratitude from the Spirit Jade Palace.

Although that was how Jun Wu Xie considered the entire matter, but that was not what everyone in the the Spirit Jade Palace thought.

Before Xue Er’s eager hospitality, Jun Wu Xie could do nothing but to follow the lead of Ye Mei and the others to go into the city.

It was until the figures of Jun Wu Xie and the others had gone into the city that Xue Er and the masked girl climbed to their feet. But even after they did, the astonishment in Xue Er’s eyes did not fade as her mouth remained slightly open while her hand clutched at her chest, discreetly gasping a little.

“So Miss Jun is actually such a beautiful lady. She’s just too beautiful for words. Compared to Miss Jun, all the beauties in the Middle Realm will have to stand aside.” Xue Er was highly sincere with her words. After seeing Jun Wu Xie, the beauties in the Middle Realm suddenly lost the allure they previously possessed. Especially when compared against the image of Jun Wu Xie quietly sitting there in Jun Wu Yao’s embrace, it was as entrancing as a painting. A peerless beauty leaning in the arms of a man with a flawless countenance. That was an image that made one unable to turn their eyes away from.

The masked girl lowered her eyes. When she had seen Jun Wu Xie and the others, she had not spoken a single word, to the extent that she did not even dare to gaze upon Jun Wu Xie at all, but was just trying her best to diminish her presence.

“She has always been so perfect.” The gentle voice rang out under the mask, tinged with a trace of yearning and helplessness.

Xue Er was at a loss as she looked at the masked girl, her lips moving but hesitant to speak. In the end, she did not say anything but just sighed, feeling powerless.

When Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao went into the city, the countenance of the two of them immediately drew the attention of the citizens in the city. The highly bustling main street had quietened almost instantly, as all eyes were turned upon the magnificent stallion, to stare at the two figures leaning against each other.

The looks of those two people had far surpassed the boundaries of the people’s imagination and everyone just stopped what they were doing as their faces twisted up in amazement to stare at the couple, a match made in Heaven.

The place that the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had prepared for Jun Wu Xie and the others was at the Spirit Jade Palace’s branch. The rooms were highly spacious, elegantly classy and not ostentatious. Exquisite and intricately detailed everywhere, where even the tea set casually placed upon the table were of the supreme grade ceramic glaze, which was considered to be extremely luxurious, but not gawdy.

“The Spirit Jade Palace Lord has prepared one room that is exactly the same as this in every single one of the branches.” Ye Mei said. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie raised one of her eyebrows slightly.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s personality was really rather eccentric, but..... he made for quite a good partner in an alliance.

“Why do we not see Qiao Chu and the others?” Ye Sha could not stop himself from asking after he escorted Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao into the room.

If his memory served him correctly, Qiao Chu and the others had gone to the Spirit World with Jun Wu Xie.

“Their flesh bodies are in the Lower Realm, so after we left the Spirit World, they went straight back to the Lower Realm. They should have returned back into their bodies by now.” Jun Wu Xie answered. It wasn’t that she did not want to bring her companions with her, but as their flesh bodies were not in the Middle Realm, if she dragged them to come along with her here into the Middle Realm straight away, wouldn’t that turn them into wandering spirits?
