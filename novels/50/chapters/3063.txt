Chapter 3064 On The Eve Of The Battle 1

“Sorry I have been rambling, I’ve been trapped here for too long.” the God of Light sighed softly once again and looked up. “You achieving the last bit of your spiritual power is in my hands. I can give it to you but you must deal with the God of Destruction yourself. If he has allowed you to come all the way here, it must mean he is well prepared. Please don’t let this world be destroyed by him because of my moment of weakness.” The God of Light raised both his hands and a bright light started to glow from them. The light beaming from his chest also got brighter and brighter and soon his whole body became a brilliant white.

“Firefly...”

When the light was at its brightest, the God of Light’s body disappeared, leaving only a ball of light flying towards Jun Wu Xie, which was accompanied by that resigned sigh.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the incoming ball of light which her body seemed to be absorbing little by little. This absorption was different from the previous six times, this time it felt like every cell in her body was being soaked in a hot spring.

In an instant, Jun Wu Xie was wrapped in the ball light, and her body was like a small sun, radiating a dazzling light..

The black cat on the side was affected by the force as well and its small body was suddenly lifted into the air and bathed in the same light as Jun Wu Xie ...

After an indistinguishable amount of time, everything in front of Jun Wu Xie’s eyes disappeared. The quiet forest was gone and that ethereal feeling slowly dissipated... Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She opened her eyes and the mountain range that she had wanted to set foot on appeared in front of her. But the mountain range was already destroyed with shattered rocks everywhere ... It was a barren wasteland created by some unknown force.

There were specks of blood all over the rocks and soil. Jun Wu Xie slowly lifted her head and saw a familiar figure lying in the midst of it.

He was alone under the sky and it was silent all around him.

Gu Xin Yan was seated next to the blood stained figure with a stunned look on her face.

“Wu Yao...”

That soft utterance pierced the silence.

Jun Wu Yao, who was standing on top of the rocks, turned around to reveal a bloody corpse in his blood soaked hands.

When Jun Wu Xie saw the familiar figure, all her previous murderous intent disappeared instantly. His body was next to hers in an instant, embracing her not wanting them to be apart again.

“Chi Yan refuses to tell us where you went even in death ...” Jun Wu Xie heard a low voice that had a slight tremor in it.

Jun Wu Xie was shocked for a moment and her gaze fell upon the blood stained corpse....

It was Chi Yan.

To be able to keep silent while being beaten to death by Jun Wu Yao really showed Chi Yan’s loyalty to the Lord. However....

“I’m fine, I have returned.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes, but had a soft tone to her voice. He was hugging her so tight that she could feel his tension.
