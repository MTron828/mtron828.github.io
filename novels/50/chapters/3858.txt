Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

If only Jun Wu Yao knew that his own arrangements directly affected his marriage to Jun Wu Xie, he might not be able to feel happy about it.

The casualties of the battle were not heavy, and the army could get back on track with little repairs.

The troops should have dispersed earlier but upon hearing the news of the marriage of Jun Wu Xie, they decided to stay. Each troop seemed to have made the decision of heading to Lin Palace to observe the festivities.

The returning troops were neat and orderly, as everyone held heavy hearts as they didn’t want to depart with joy. Luo Qingcheng and the rest of the prisoners were brought back by a specially made prison carriage. There was no further trouble as the troops returned home.

Only difference was that within the Rui Lin Army, there were more than a hundred more horse carriages transporting the treasures.

Those treasures that were personally sent by the Night Regime as “betrothal gifts”.

Based on Jun Wu Yao’s list of gifts, he had parted with almost half of his treasures, but his wealth has already surpassed any of the Lower Realm countries. So much so that even before they could get through half the list, Jun Xian could not take it any longer and insisted that Jun Qing stuffed the Hell Rodent’s mouth shut. He tried to convince Ye Gu to stop but in the end he was forthrightly rejected by Ye Gu. Thus, Jun Qing had to temporarily ‘kidnap’ the Hell Rodent.

Stuffed its mouth and locked up in a cage to prevent its further harmfulness from spreading.

The fat Hell Rodent, having being caged up, stood up piteously, pulling at the bars of the cage. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Xie sat in the carriage, looking at the gagged Hell Rodent. She could not help but stretched her hand in to rub the rounded cheeks of the Hell Rodent, and attracted a muffled sigh from the animal.

Jun Wu Yao was strong-armed by Jun Xian to ride in one of the Night Regime carriages. He dared not let Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie be together anymore. After that fateful day, Jun Wu Yao actually came back on the second day with the Hell Rodent and had it regurgitated a houseful of gold, silver and treasures. It forced them to hasten their travels to prevent the city from suffering, and he even detained the Hell Rodent.

In truth, Jun Xian was very gratified with the unreserved behavior of Jun Wu Yao with regard to Jun Wu Xia, no matter how helpless it made them, the actions have proved his true love for Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Xian and Jun Qing were very pleased with this fellow, Jun Wu Yao.

Of course.....

They would be even more happy if Jun Wu Yao could be slightly less crazy.

Looking at Jun Wu Xie, who was playing with the Hell Rodent, Jun Xian let out a sigh. His young granddaughter had grown into a young lady, ready to be married. Jun Xian had a little reluctance in his heart.

Thinking about thus, Jun Gu’s face involuntarily emerged in the mind of Jun Xian’s Jun Xian

Recollecting the past, when Jun Gu and his wife got married, they were also quite clueless, but after marriage the young married couple’s love deepened. But.....

Jun Xian could not help but sigh again.

“If only your father could see you getting married, that would be great.”

Jun Wu Xie’s fingers froze, and she lifted her head up.

They could not find the soul of Jun Gu in the Spirit World, and that has always been a sore point in Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

“Don’t worry Grandfather, I’ll go to the Soul World soon. The Spirit Lord has said that Father’s spirit could very well be in Soul World.” Jun Wu Xie replied.

“Soul World in within the Upper Realm, and it will be too dangerous for you to you.” Jun Xian was worried as Jun Wu Xie had just fought against the Upper Realm. If she went back to the Upper Realm, they might lose their strong upper hand on Upper Realm when they turned the tide of battle, her name has spread far and wide through the Upper Realm due to the now infamous fight between Jun Wu Xie and Luo Qingcheng.
