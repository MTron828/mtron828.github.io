Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Long Xuan City’s army approached Sea Spirit City step by step with a heavy voice, and the situation turned into crisis.

However ...

Ye Sha, who was standing away from the gates of Sea Spirit City, looked calm, and there was a hint of killing intent in his eyes. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Just as Ruan Zhongshan’s horse was about 50 meters away from Sea Spirit City, a voice sounded suddenly.

“Ruan Zhongshan, this is your choice.” The voice was aloof.

When the voice reached Ruan Zhongshan’s ears, he looked up to locate the source of the voice!

He saw a refined figure standing quietly in the wind, on the gate tower of Sea Spirit City, the figure’s simple yet elegant white dress billowing in the breeze!

Jun Wu Xie stood on an elevation and looked down at the 20,000 soldiers that surrounded Sea Spirit City. There was no fear in her cold face, but there was an added a kind of indifference and an imposing manner that cannot be ignored!

Obviously, it was a thin figure but it gave people a feeling that the figure cannot be defeated.

Ruan Zhongshan recovered from his shock and looked at Jun Wu Xie with his eyes filled with a frantic and violent rage, “Yan Hai! You finally dare to show yourself! It’s good that you’ve appeared so that you can see for yourself, how I completely destroy your Sea Spirit City! Attack!”

Ruan Zhongshan shouted his command and the Long Xuan City army rushed forward!

Xu Zu took point and led a team of men to the main entrance of Sea Spirit City!

As long as Jun Wu Xie’s head was cut off, he was bound to become famous in battle!

With that strong desire, Xu Zu growled and rushed forward. His first target was Ye Sha, who was standing in front of the gate!

“Trash! Die!!!” The spiritual power in Xu Zu’s hands surged and slammed into Ye Sha.

Ye Sha could not be moved like a mountain, a sharp killing intent flashed across his cold eyes!

The moment Xu Zu rushed in front of Ye Sha, Ye Sha’s figure suddenly disappeared. Everything happened so fast that Xu Zu couldn’t react at all!

Xu Zu was startled, and before he could react, a grave pressure was emitted from his head resulting in a pitiful wail from his mouth. His entire head was smashed into the ground in an instant!

The sudden turn in battle left all the soldiers behind Xu Zu dumbfounded, their footsteps halted as they watched Ye Sha step on the back of Xu Zu’s head, and pushing it right into the soil. The dark brown soil was slowly covered in blood, and in the midst of the pool of blood, one could see some brain matter floating...

All the soldiers were stunned as they stared in horror at the bloody picture in front of them. The pool of blood filled their eyes as Xu Zu laid motionless on the ground, seemingly dead.

After Xu Zu took the elixir made by Jun Wu Xie, his strength had advanced by leaps and bounds. Although he still lacked a bit more to break into the peak level of the Gold Spirit, he could still stabilise Gold Spirit at an intermediate level. But, a strong exponent like him was simply smashed by the steward of Sea Spirit City’s official residence ...

In an instant, the aggression and arrogance of the Long Xuan City’s soldiers were suppressed to an extreme that no sound was heard further.

Ruan Zhongshan, who was sitting behind, saw the whole process with his own eyes. Ye Sha’s shot was extremely fast, and that speed even surpassed the peak level of Gold Spirit. Otherwise, Xu Zu could not be killed in one shot.

This person ...

He was just a steward of Sea Spirit City’s official residence, but the strength he had displayed was similar to that of a Spiritual Inscription exponent!
