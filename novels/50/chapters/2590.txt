Chapter 2591: Plot Twist (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The severe pain that Meng Qiu had never experienced before had made his soul tremble. The roots of Blood Velvet submerge into his soul, causing Meng Qiu to be on the verge of breaking down due to the strong repulsion and inescapable suffering.

The kind of suffering when the soul power of the other soul entity penetrated into your soul was completely incomparable by any other pain.

The expression on Meng Qiu’s face was extremely awful, but there was nothing he could do except for wailing in pain.

The roots of Blood Velvet groped inside Meng Qiu’s soul for quite a long time. With the smile on his face suddenly fading away, he raised his head and looked at Jun Wu Yao with a state of confusion in his eyes.

“Lord Jue, I can feel the energy that you’ve mentioned, but there are too many areas that have been affected by the energy, I can’t immediately dig it out. If we want to fully remove it, I’m afraid that I alone isn’t able to do it. We need to call Poison Ivy out, and it only will work if we dig it out bilaterally.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Before this, Jun Wu Yao had already told Blood Velvet the method to remove the Contemporaneous Knot, but it was until this moment that Blood Velvet only realized that things were way more complicated than what Jun Wu Yao had said.

With his brows slightly cocking, Jun Wu Yao looked at Meng Qiu who was colourless on the face and suddenly curved the corners of his lips up into a smile.

“It seemed like you’ve cast the Contemporaneous Knot on the Spirit Tree way far more before this.”

The Contemporaneous Knot was a bilateral seal. The longer the time, the wider the area it would be spreading across to. At first, Jun Wu Yao thought that it was just around these one thousand years that Meng Qiu had cast the Contemporaneous Knot on the Spirit Tree, but according to the narration of Blood Velvet, the Contemporaneous Knot might probably have been cast for a much longer time, at the very least, it should have been existing for thousands of years.

This was weird, since it wasn’t such a long time ago when Jun Wu Yao appeared in the Three Realms, and the person in the Upper Realm had not yet thought about the Blood Sacrifice of The Three Realms at such an early time, but it was obvious that the time when Meng Qiu cast the Contemporaneous Knot on the Spirit Tree was far before the time when he got in touch with the Upper Realm.

Didn’t this mean that... even if the Upper Realm didn’t intervene in this matter, the thought of sealing the Spirit Tree had already long hidden in Meng Qiu’s mind?

Meng Qiu felt so painful to the point that he couldn’t even speak a word, there was no way he was able to make any response regarding Jun Wu Yao’s words. He was just deeply frowning with his gaze full of pain.

“Stop it first.” Casually, Jun Wu Yao shook his hand.

It seemed like they had to go near the Spirit Tree if they wanted to remove the Contemporaneous Knot.

Blood Velvet moved a step backwards and got his roots out. With his whole body terribly convulsing, Meng Qiu collapsed on the ground. After experiencing everything, it was as if he had fallen into a deep abyss, not being able to climb up back to the ground.

“Are we going to find the Spirit Tree now?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and looked at Jun Wu Yao. By looking at the current situation, they needed to make a slight adjustment on their plan.

Jun Wu Yao nodded his head as he patted on Jun Wu Xie’s small little head with his eyes filling with affection.

“You haven’t met the Spirit Tree before. You can meet it today. Although it had no mouth to speak, it’s still a nice ‘person’.”

Since it was rare to hear compliments for the others coming out from Jun Wu Yao’s mouth, Jun Wu Xie couldn’t help her curiosity towards the Spirit Tree, the origin of all the souls, from being excited

“Get him up.” Looking at Meng Qiu, Jun Wu Yao said.

Blood Velvet immediately lifted Meng Qiu who was feeble all over up. Meng Qiu felt so painful that all his energy had drained out of his body. He could only just let Blood Velvet simply drag him up, and stood wobbly.

“Well, we can keep your life longer.” Jun Wu Yao looked at Meng Qiu.

Face paled, Meng Qiu looked at Jun Wu Yao with his teeth tightly clenching, refusing from speaking a word.

“Lord Jue, what if he counters back?” Blood Velvet asked while looking at the uncooperative attitude shown by Meng Qiu.
