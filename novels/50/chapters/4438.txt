Chapter 3034 His Highness Ying 1

“I wanted to see for myself but didn’t have the chance. I heard since that incident, the 72 Cities has been reduced to nothing at the hands of Yan Hai. I regret that I was not able to witness it with my own eyes.” Gu Ying sighed.

“I see, that’s no matter, now that Yan Hai has become a Knight of Destruction, he will be staying in the Sacred City and the both of you will have many chances to interact and become familiar.” At this, His Lord smiled, he looked at Jun Wu Xie the way a proud father would look at his child.

“Ying’er is my only child, and this child has suffered quite a lot of hardship and developed some character quirks. It may be survival of the strong in the Sacred City but there aren’t many people around his age inside. Yan Hai, now that you are staying in the Sacred City, I hope you can find the chance to develop a friendship with him.”

Jun Wu Xie looked at the expression of the loving father on His Lord and nodded lightly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie did not know what to make of His Lord, since they met His Lord, he seemed to be normal, not displaying any cruel traits and has even shown concern towards Gu Ying, just like any other father.

If this were anybody else, Jun Wu Xie would feel there was nothing out of the ordinary.

But this was His Lord....

How could a person who toyed with the Three Realms so easily, have such fatherly concern?

Jun Wu Xie did not believe it, not one bit.

As she did not know what His Lord was up to, she could only bide her time and not make any moves for now.

“Alright, I’m here so I’m afraid you can’t go anywhere. I’ve prepared dinner so stay and chat while I take a quick rest. We will eat when I return.” His Lord stood up and smiled as he turned away. As he stepped down from the high chair and walked away slowly, he fixed his gaze to the side and put on a cold looking face.

“Chi Yan, it’s rare for Ying’er to meet someone of his own age. Don’t just stand there, let’s go to the garden for a walk.”

Chi Yan was stunned momentarily before saying, “OK.”

As soon as the words came out of his mouth, his body was already keeping up with His Lord’s.

After the two departed, only Jun Wu Xie and Gu Ying were left in the hall.

The hall was dead silent, Jun Wu Xie was rooted to the spot as she was in her own world thinking about His Lord’s potential plans. She did not notice Gu Ying until he stood right in front of her.

“Highness Ying?” Jun Wu Xie’s expression calmed down as she addressed the person in front of her.

Gu Ying was in no rush to speak and just looked at Jun Wu Xie from head to toe, as if trying to find something. After a long time, Gu Ying said, “Yan Hai, you look like someone who is both familiar and a stranger all at once.”

Jun Wu Xie’s heart was stirred but she maintained a poker face, “I wonder who is the person Highness Ying is speaking of?”

Go Ying smiled slightly, looked past Jun Wu Xie towards the sky outside the hall. He had a meaningful look in his eyes.

“A woman, a woman I hate to the bone.”
