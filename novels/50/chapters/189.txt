Chapter 190: “Soul Jade (2)”

Bai Yun Xian fell to the floor with a thump, trembling uncontrollably.

“I understand, I’ll listen to everything you say! Just don’t let me turn into that hideous beast.”

Jun Wu Xie turned away from her and said frostily: “Scram.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Bai Yun Xian picked up her legs and ran hastily out from the palace and bumped into Mo Qian Yuan who was returning after having seen the guests out. Upon seeing the look on her face, Mo Qian Yuan knew someone had been threatening people yet again.

Upon entering the palace, Mo Qian Yuan saw the eunuchs sending Mo Xuan Fei back to the dungeon, and the palace maids had lit various incense, to rid the place of the stench of rot.

Jun Wu Xie stood in the middle of the room, staring at him quietly.

Mo Qian Yuan cleared his throat nervously, “You heard everything that Qin Yu Yan said?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

“What do you think we should do?” Mo Qian Yuan did not possess the guts to ask Jun Wu Xie to dig up her own father’s grave.

“Give them what they want.” Jun Wu Xie said without much thought. It was just two pieces of jade, and the time was not ripe to go against Qing Yun Clan yet.

“What?” Mo Qian Yuan stared at her, incredulous.

“You..... you agree to hand over the Soul Jade?”

“Why not?” Jun Wu Xie asked with her head tilted, baffled. She had never heard anything about Soul Jade from Jun Xian nor Jun Qing. If it was anything important, they would have told her about it. Since they did not, it must not have been anything unusual.

To go against the Qing Yun Clan over some decorative stones? It wasn’t worth it.

Mo Qian Yuan scrutinized Jun Wu Xian carefully, unable to shake of his incredulity. “I find that I understand you less daily. You have shielded the Jun Family so aggressively, I did not expect..... you to agree to digging up General Jun’s grave. You might be right, if he had known, the general would not have wanted you to stand against the Qing Yun Clan.....”

Before Mo Qian Yuan could finish, Jun Wu Xie’s eyes flashed dangerously at him.

“What did you say?”

“Erm..... I..... I didn’t say anything.....” Mo Qian Yuan shut his mouth in a hurry.

“Whose grave did you say to dig up?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were aflame.

Mo Qian Yuan gulped: “Jun Gu, Generalissimo Jun..... The piece of Soul Jade bestowed to the Jun Family, was buried together with his body upon his death, wasn’t it?”

Jun Wu Xie’s brow furrowed into a deep frown.

“You did not know?” Mo Qian Yuan asked in bafflement.

“No.” Jun Wu Xie replied simply, her frown deepening. Jun Wu Xie was still very young when Jun Gu passed away, and she did not retain much memories of her father himself, not to mention the items that were buried with him.

Mo Qian Yuan saw now, the reason Jun Wu Xie had agreed so readily.

“Do you still intend to hand it to them?” Mo Qian Yuan asked.

Jun Wu Xie was deep in thought. She had never met Jun Gu, and her affections to the Jun Family were limited to only Jun Xian and Jun Qing. She did not think too much of digging up a grave, but that was after all the grave of Jun Xian’s son and Jun Qing’s brother. It was not a matter she could decide on her own.

The last people she wanted to hurt, were those two, the father and son of the Jun Family.

“I’ll let you know tomorrow.” Jun Wu Xie thought on how she was going to proceed. She needed to discuss the matter with her grandfather and uncle carefully. She had to at the very least, ascertain if the Soul Jade had indeed been buried together with her father.

“All right. I will stall the Qing Yun Clan for now. Don’t worry.” Mo Qian Yuan said with a laugh. He had decided, with or without Jun Wu Xie’s half of the Soul Jade, he will first present his half to Qin Yu Yan tomorrow, to appease them, in order to buy some time for Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie nodded, her only intention now, was to return to the Lin Palace, and discuss the matter with Jun Xian.
