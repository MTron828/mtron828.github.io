Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In Lin Palace, everyone had gathered together with Jun Xian seated at the main seat. On the two sides of the hall, many people had already gathered, some were seated while some were standing. On everyone’s nervous face, there was also a hint of expectation mixed in. In the midst of all the clamouring, they could not help but kept their eyes on the door, as if anticipating the arrival of someone.

Jun Xian strived to maintain a calm façade although he would turn his head over and ask Jun Qing time and time again, “Has the people outside the city gates seen anything yet?”

Jun Qing looked at his father with a wry smile.

“There hasn’t been any sightings yet, but Long Qi has already sent a message back that they would definitely arrive today. Just wait a while more Father, don’t worry, drink some tea first.” Jun Qing picked up the tea on the table and passed it to his father.

Jun Xian took the cup and took a sip, cleared his throat and said: “I am not in a hurry, I’m just asking.”

Yes, you are not in a hurry. After you got the news, this is the seventy sixth time that you’ve asked this same question already.

Yue Ye squatted by the door as she stretched her little head out to peer. A pretty young boy sat beside her and similarly craned his neck to peer out.

“Is Little Big Brother still not back yet?” The young boy was fiddling and tugging the corner of his clothes while he asked. His face was as beautiful as jade, but there was a tinge of anxiety that did not dissipate from his face.

“Little Martial Uncle please don’t worry. Master will arrive soon.” Yue Ye slapped the shoulders of the young boy. This young boy was not just anyone but it was Little Jue who was saved by Jun Wu Xie. Back then, he was stimulated and his mind became confused. Fortunately, they found out the method to cure him from the Dark Emperor’s tomb. It was a pity that the treatment took a long time and when Jun Wu Xie left the Lower Realm, he still hadn’t recovered his mind. Being separated for so many years, Little Jue missed Jun Wu Xie and his longing for her was increasing day by day.

“I haven’t seen my Little Big Brother for a long time.” Little Jue was nervously tugging his clothes and despite feeling a little nervous, he was looking forward and was filled with anticipation.

He didn’t know if Jun Wu Xie would still recognize him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Master must have missed us too.” Yue Ye leaned against her chin her hands and looked at the road outside the door.

Standing at the side, Yue Yi was laughing at his own sister and exchanged a look of helplessness with Elder Ying.

In the eyes of Yue Ye, the status of the Jun Wu Xie had already surpassed her loved ones.

In the hall, Mo Qian Yuan was fidgeting, the tea in his hand had long been over brewed and had turned light in colour and tasted bland. But despite all of this, he kept repeating the motion of drinking. Bai Yun Xian who was standing behind him could only silently add water for him. Standing at one corner, Yin Yan was trying his best to reduce his own existence, but his eyes kept staring at the back of Bai Yun Xian.

“Should...I head over to the city gates to have a look?” Fan Jin stood up in a hurry. He was already the headmaster of the Zephyr Academy and for so many years, he had not shown such an anxious attitude.

“Ah Ah...” Ah Jing, who was next to Fan Jin also made a muffled voice, intending to accompany Fan Jin along.

“Everyone, please keep calm. Please don’t get too excited. Please wait, just wait a moment more.” Jun Qing could only help to appease the emotions of the people.

While Jun Qing was appeasing the crowd, the figure of Mu Qian Fan rushed into the hall, his face was covered with a layer of thin sweat, but his face was filled with ecstasy. He struggled to stay calm, his eyes swept through the crowd, and with a trembling voice, he said: “She’s back! She’s back! She’s back!!”
