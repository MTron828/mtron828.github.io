Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie was brought to the city’s official residence by Dongfang Ku Bi himself. During the whole process, everyone could see Dongfang Ku Bi bending and bowing by Jun Wu Xie’s side, humbly and cowardly.

Since coming to the Upper Realm, Jun Wu Xie and others were basically engaged in high-intensity battles. Suddenly encountering such a City Lord rendered them unable to respond.

Jun Wu Xie’s face was cold throughout the walk to the official residence, but Dongfang Ku Bi pointed out the scenery along the way. He was anxious to show everything to Jun Wu Xie. using his large body to squeeze out those who were bside Jun Wu Xie. That behaviour made Qiao Chu nearly want to vomit.

“Is this person really the City Lord of East Peak City? Is he a fake? Maybe the real city owner is hiding somewhere for an ambush, waiting for us to enter the city and wipe us you.” Qiao Chu couldn’t help but muttered to Hua Yao.

Hua Yao was also speechless. He really hadn’t seen such a cowardly City Lord. Even in the weakest city among the seventy-two, Sea Spirit City, Lord Yan Wan was a cruel and ruthless man. How was this East Peak City Lord so cowardly?

Qiao Chu had deliberately lowered his voice, but the words were still heard by Dongfang Ku Bi. He suddenly stopped and turned to look at Qiao Chu, his face was sincere.

“What are you talking about, Sir? How will I, Dongfang Ku Bi, do such a despicable thing? I’m the real Dongfang Ku Bi. You can rest assured that people named Dongfang will never do such treacherous things!”

Dongfang Ku Bi had the appearance of brilliance and possessed a strong voice. His statement was full of righteous words but....

If he did not surrender, those words would be even more imposing.

Qiao Chu swallowed his saliva and looked at the Dongfang Ku Bi, who had turned his head and continued to kiss Jun Wu Xie’s ass.

Zheng Weilong chuckled while watching, she whispered: “The strength of Dongfang Ku Bi is not low, maybe even a little higher than Ruan Zhongshan. He is listening clearly to our words.”

“...” Qiao Chu was even more speechless. This ‘thing’ had such strength but why was he so cowardly?!

But soon, Qiao Chu realized that it wasn’t just Dongfang Ku Bi who was cowardly. Even the people and soldiers in East Peak City did not have any resistance to the Night Regime’s arrival. On both sides of the streets, people lined up with smiles on their faces, the only thing lacking was them cheering for the Night Regime.

Was this the way to greet the enemy? This clearly looked like they were welcoming a victorious army!! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In the entire East Peak City, from Dongfang Ku Bi to the citizens, all of them shocked Qiao Chu and the others.

After leading Jun Wu Xie into the official residence of East Peak City, Dongfang Ku Bi immediately prepared a cup of tea and personally brought it to Jun Wu Xie. The diligence made Jun Wu Xie not know how to respond as she continued to put on a blank face.

“What does Lord Yan command? In the future, will East Peak City need the Sea Spirit City’s troops to be stationed here? This official residence, if Lord Yan does not like it, it can be renovated. The original soldiers of East Peak City can be disbanded at any time to facilitate the takeover by Sea Spirit City. Oh ... here is the token of the City Lord of East Peak City, Lord Yan, please accept it ... and ... ”

Dongfang Ku Bi delivered all of East Peak City into Jun Wu Xie’s hands. The self-awareness, made even Qiao Chu, who was trying to find a fight with him, stunned.
