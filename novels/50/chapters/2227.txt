Following the words of Ren Huang, Jun Wu Xie tried to condense spirit energy in her dantian, however she was unable to capture that feeling, after finally condensing a little bit, in just a few minutes, everything dispersed again.

Ren Huang smiled at her as he looked at the sullen expression after her continuous failure, however there was not a hint of surprise nor disappointment in his eyes.

“If you have yet to reach the peak of the Gold Spirit, you wouldn’t be able to condense any spirit inscription. But remember the feeling that you have now, as your strength grows, this feeling will become easier to capture, and a completely new experience will flow into your body. I believe that in a few years, you will definitely be able to condense out a complete spirit inscription. Perhaps given ten years or so, you might be even able to condense out a complete Spirit Ring.” Ren Huang was not disappointed one bit and his voice was filled with hope. He had lived for thousands of years and has met countless people, it was very rare to meet a talented individual like Jun Wu Xie.

At the side, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord heard the words of Ren Huang and secretly tried to condense out a spirit inscription. However, the result made him very disappointed. When Ren Huang taught Jun Wu Xie, he had been listening intently subconsciously as he secretly learned as well, Ren Huang did not mind and also took it as he was teaching him as well.

“If you intend to deal with the Upper Realm, you must be able to condense out spirit inscriptions. Little Wu Xie, you have to listen to me carefully, before you are able to condense out a Spirit Ring, you are never ever allowed to clash with the people from the Upper Realm head on.” Ren Huang looked at her worriedly, although her talent was astounding, however she was still very young and the time that she had spent cultivating was too short. To be able to achieve something, she would need at least a year or two.

“This disciple understands.” Jun Wu Xie was not anxious, she understood that the most taboo in cultivation was being too hasty. She had confidence that she could condense the spirit inscription, this was all just a matter of time.

Jun Wu Yao was at the side walked quietly beside her, watching her eyes sparkling, and the gaze that he looked at her was overspilling with adoration.

“It is so difficult to condense a spirit inscription, Headmaster, I see that your Spirit Ring has a lot of spirit inscriptions in it.” After a few failed attempts, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord gave up. He was still a certain distance away from the peak, Ren Huang’s words were truly from experience.

“This rascal, it seems like you do have some vision. No matter what, I’m also an expert in the Upper Realm.” Ren Huang puffed up his chest and said with pride.

He was someone powerful, however when he said it in such a triumphant and smug manner, he did not make people feel awe but felt that it was funny instead. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jun Wu Yao slowly lifted his gaze and swept past Ren Huang, but when he noticed that his clothes were being tugged at, he lowered his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie was gently tugging his sleeves.

“Is my Grandmaster very strong?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Choosing to ask Jun Wu Yao instead of Ren Huang was an absolutely wise choice.

Jun Wu Xie raised his eyebrow and looked at Ren Huang who was staring back at him with wide eyes. Obviously Ren Huang wanted to protest against the choice of Jun Wu Xie’s choice in person when she asked this question, however he could only watch helplessly as it was Jun Wu Yao.

“He is...alright.” Jun Wu Yao replied indifferently.

Ren Huang was immediately unhappy.

“What do you mean by alright?! This old man here is one of the top ten experts in the Upper Realm! Ye Jue, stop speaking nonsense!” Ren Huang was afraid that his glorious image would be destroyed and he immediately try to rectify it.

“One of the top ten experts?” Jun Wu Xie looked at him in shock, one could not blame her, it was... really difficult to picture him with such a high and noble image.
