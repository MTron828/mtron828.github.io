Chapter 177: “Handling Matters (3)”

Mo Xuan Fei wanted to hide in the corner, but with him bound in the wheelchair, he could not go anywhere.

“Wh..... What do you want?” Mo Xuan Fei stuttered in fear, having his contractual spirit ripped apart from him had brought torment not just physically, but had wreaked his soul as well. The pain had just subsided, but at the sight of Jun Wu Xie, the pain all came back with a vengeance.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at him and did not say anything more, but turned around to the other cell.

In there, a girl in white hugged her knees tightly, trying her best to stay hidden in a corner, as her shivers rustled the dry straw below her.

Compared to the gaunt faced and disheveled Mo Xuan Fei, Bai Yun Xian had been treated much better.

Although she was locked up in the cell, her freedom restricted, the Rui Lin Army guards gave her fresh food and clean drinking water, warm water to wash with and clean clothes to change into. This had allowed the disciple of the Qing Yun Clan, to maintain a presentable outlook at the very least.

The difference in the treatment, had ignited a sense of hope in her, that Jun Wu Xie might not kill her after all.

Despite that glimmer of hope she harboured, she did not dare go against Jun Wu Xie in any way possible.

“Drag her out.” Jun Wu Xie commanded the Rui Lin Army guards.

The guards opened the cell door and dragged Bai Yun Xian out. She lowered her gaze, stood trembling, unable to look into Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

She did not know what was going to happen, she could only pray that Jun Wu Xie did not intend to kill her.

“Bring him out.” Jun Wu Xie said, pointing at Mo Xuan Fei.

Mo Xuan Fei was wheeled out of his cell, while the distraught former Emperor sat within the cell, and watched Jun Wu Xie, as he cowered in fear.

“How are you skills in medicine in the Qing Yun Clan?” Jun Wu Xie asked of the pale Bai Yun Xian.

Bai Yun Xian jumped in shock, and was too afraid to answer Jun Wu Xie. Her confidence in medicine had been savagely shredded into nothing by Jun Wu Xie.

With Bai Yun Xian’s silence, she then instructed the Rui Lin Army guard: “Pry open the Second Prince’s mouth.”

Mo Xuan Fei’s heart sank, and was helpless to struggle. His legs were useless and his hands bound to the wheelchair, rendering him immobile. The Rui Lin Army guard forced his mouth open, and he could only scream in terror.

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and dropped a black pill into Mo Xuan Fei’s throat, and he was forced to swallow it.

“Watch.” Jun Wu Xie told Bai Yun Xian.

Bai Yun Xian gulped in silence.

In the next moment, Mo Xuan Fei who was bound to the wheelchair started trashing about and wailing in anguish. Green splotches appeared and spread across his face and started to swell. The flesh split at the boils and grew into red bloody gooey wounds and slowly turned dark. The green splotches spread to his neck and throughout his body. The once dashing suave Second Prince had in a moment, turned into a rotting flesh monster. He continued to wail, as the rotted flesh dripped onto the ground, emitting a foul odour.

Bai Yun Xian was almost driven to madness at the sight! If it was not for the Rui Lin Army guards holding her, she would have tumbled to the ground when she lost all strength in her legs witnessing it.

The once handsome and dashing prince, had turned into a hellish monster before her eye!

At this point, Mo Xuan Fei was just like a corpse that did not stop rotting!
