Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie did not speak, but raised her right hand instead and gently slid across her chest and strangely, it separated the black cat from her soul.

The little black cat that was about the size of a person’s palm fell on to her hands and there seemed to be something in its mouth. It suddenly opened its mouth wide and spat out a dark red sphere that was the size of a fingernail onto her palm.

Jun Wu Xie picked up the little red ball and passed it to the Spirit Lord.

The Spirit Lord was astonished as he looked back at the little black cat that sat on Jun Wu Xie’s palm. He had seen this black cat before, back then when Jun Wu Xie was in the Spirit World. At first, he thought that the black cat was a beast spirit, but now.... it doesn’t seem like that. Any ring spirit who was attached to the soul of a person would be easily noticed by him. But strangely, before the black cat appeared, he did not even sense the presence of any other souls apart from her.

This was as if...

The black cat and Jun Wu Xie both resided in the same body.

“I believe that you should be clearer than me on what this is.” Jun Wu Xie spoke calmly as she looked at that little red ball. The Spirit Lord had a much deeper level of understanding to things pertaining to the souls than she had.

The Spirit Lord suppressed the bewilderment in his heart and took a serious look at the strange little red ball in his hand. This little red ball did not feel cold to the touch. Instead, it radiated a trace of warmth. When the Spirit Lord imbued his finger with a little soul power, he pressed it against the little red ball. Under the stimulation of the soul power, the little red ball gradually dissipated the soul power and very soon, it turned into a red mist and gathered in the palm of the Spirit Lord. And the next moment, it was as if it had a consciousness of its own and wanted to burrow into the soul of the Spirit Lord!

The expression of the Spirit Lord changed instantly and he immediately congealed out a huge flame formed out of a huge output of soul power and burnt the red mist into a crisp until not a speck of it was left!

“What is it?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows as she looked at him.

The expression of the Spirit Lord had turned ugly to the extreme, his eyebrows were tightly furrowed and his lips pursed grimly.

“Soul Devourer.”

“Soul Devourer?” Jun Wu Xie looked at him with a puzzled expression.

However, the expression of the Spirit Lord did not ease at all. “The Soul Devourer is a medicine of the Soul World, and it has no effect on living creatures, but it is a fatal poison to a soul!”

The soul was not afraid of any toxins. All those poisons that act on the living organs could not harm the soul one bit but the “Soul Devourer” was the only poison in the Soul World that could cause harm to the soul. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Soul Devourer was first refined from within the body of the Spirit Tree. Countless years had passed and the Spirit Tree was not completely well. It had also been sick before and the Soul Devourer was extracted from the sick body of the Spirit Tree. Dedicated to dealing with those souls that have a disagreement with the Soul World, the Soul Devourer will not bring any pain to the soul, but will penetrate into the soul invisibly and devour the soul bit by bit.

Moreover, once the soul had been poisoned with the Soul Devourer, the stronger the soul power, the more terrible the effects were. Before the Soul Devourer completely devoured the soul, the soul would not even have any awareness and without knowing anything, its soul would dissipate and scatter forever!

Even in the Soul World, the poison of the Soul Devourer was strictly controlled. The Spirit Lord had once asked Qin Song about Situ Heng and was told that his identity was only that of an ordinary soul envoy. This meant that he no qualification to have any contact with the Soul Devourer. However, this poison actually appeared in the hands of Situ Heng, and he even used it to poison Jun Wu Xie!

“It seems that you guessed it right, there’s really a problem with this Situ Heng.” The Spirit Lord frowned deeply.
