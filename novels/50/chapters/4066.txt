Xu Zu’s attempt at throwing out temptation did not mean that someone would take the bait.

His men brought him a thin and small soldier, who looked young and had a slender body.

The soldier was somewhat unwilling, because he was young and was bullied by the other soldiers. When Xu Zu’s men found him, he was being ridiculed by a group of soldiers. This made Xu Zu’s men made up their minds and secretly found a time to speak with the young soldier.

When the youth learned that he had the opportunity to go to Long Xuan City, naturally he was completely willing, and had followed them to meet Xu Zu.

The news that Xu Zu obtained from the youth shocked him.

“What are you talking about? Yan Hai really refined that kind of medicine?” Xu Zu narrowed his eyes and looked at that thin youth.

The boy tightened his shoulders and nodded. “I don’t dare to lie to you, my lord. The City Lord obtained the method from somewhere, and using the the Sea Spirit Beast, refined the medicine. Many soldiers in the city have taken it. If My Lord does not believe me, you can go to the city to find a soldier to test your skills. They are not weak, and only someone weak like me... was not able to get the medicine.” The teenager couldn’t help but contained some resentment.

From the youth, Xu Zu had learned that the newly constructed workshop of Jun Wu Xie could use the Sea Spirit Beast to refine a kind of medicinal pills. The kind of medicine could improve a person’s strength greatly within in a short time. However, the consumption of the Sea Spirit Beast is huge.

“Boss, is there really such a thing?” The people of Long Xuan City listened to the youth’s words and couldn’t believe that the Sea Spirit Beast could be used to refine this controversial medicine.

Xu Zu rubbed his chin, and hesitated.

“I have heard before that there are many effects of the Sea Spirit Beasts. It seems that some people have said that the bone and blood of the Sea Spirit Beast could be used to refine the medicinal pills, but the specific method has already been lost... So how did this Yan Hai obtain the method for it?” Xu Zu was somewhat suspicious of this matter, but he thought that Jun Wu Xie’s intention of monopolizing the Sea Spirit Beasts was even more unbelievable.

“That cannot do, we have to go back to Long Xuan City immediately and tell the City Lord!” Xu Zu immediately stood up. If Jun Wu Xie could really use the Sea Spirit Beast to refine the medicinal pills, then ... that changed things! !

Stunned that they were just going to leave, the youth’s face immediately held a hint of panic.

“My Lord, I’ve already told you what you wanted to know. If you leave, I... What should I do?”

Xu Zu glanced at the boy, his eyes flashed a bit of cunning as he smiled and said: “Naturally I will not forget you, Long Xuan City will leave a place for you, but I still need you to do something. ”

“What is it?”

“Look for a way to get me one of those medicinal pills you mentioned. There is no rush as we will soon return to Long Xuan City. You have a month or so before we return to Sea Spirit city again.”

Once Xu Zu had appeased the boy, and he rushed back to Long Xuan City with his own men.

The teenager, who was stuffed with a lot of money, watched the carriages depart from the main city gate of Sea Spirit City. The panic on his face had already disappeared. His mouth kicked up a scornful smile as he played with the silver in his hand, throwing them up in the air; they gave off a crisp sound as they knocked against each other.

“With this level of skills and they still dare to go against Little Xie? They are seeking their own deaths.” Keeping the silver casually, the teenager raised his hand and pulled the mask off on his face. It revealed the handsome face of Fei Yan!
