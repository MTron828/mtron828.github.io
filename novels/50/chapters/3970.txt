Before returning to Soul World, Qin Song and Long Jiu didn’t think that things would become this state. They suspected that people in the Upper Realm might have bribed some Spirit Envoys, but as long as Meng Qiu was in charge of Soul World, there would absolutely no trouble, because there was no Soul Envoy that could defeat Meng Qiu.

However...

When Qin Song understood everything, it was only then he realised that it was actually a disaster and it was actually Meng Qiu who masterminded it.

“Why did Master betray the Spirit Tree? I.... I cannot accept it...” Long Jiu was fuming with rage between gritted teeth, as he clenched his fist tightly. When Qin Song and him were born, they were mentored by Meng Qiu. They stayed with Meng Qiu to cultivate their soul power. It can be said that they have long considered Meng Qiu to be family, strong and upright.

But Qin Song’s words made the figure in Long Jiu’s heart, that was placed upon a pedestal, to completely collapse.

“I can’t accept it too, but this is the truth. After we separated, I snuck to the location of the Spirit Tree because I want to see what actually happened...” Although Qin Song spoke lightly, but it revealed the images that he least wanted to recall.

When Qin Song went to the Spirit Tree, the Spirit Tree was already surrounded by the Soul Envoy traitors, and Qin Song spent considerable effort to sneak in.

When he saw the Spirit Tree once again, when he once again saw that familiar, tall and upright figure, his whole body was numb with shock. He saw his own Master standing under the Spirit Tree, his once plain clothes, were replaced by a black, light armour, exactly the same as those donned by the traitors.

Before Qin Song could figure out what happened, he was discovered by Meng Qiu, and he immediately captured Qin Song without saying a word. Until Qin Song was sent to the Soul Prison, he still could not accept Meng Qiu’s betrayal.

“Meng Qiu has not only betrayed the Spirit Tree, but because the Spirit Tree and him had lived together for the longest, so he had plenty of opportunity to scheme against the Spirit Tree. They now have complete control of the Spirit Tree. Meng Qiu used an ancient method of burying many Soul Reaping Stones around the Spirit Tree. And he had a seal stamped into the body of the Spirit Tree. Now, the safety of the Spirit Tree is in the hands of Meng Qiu, we cannot do anything...”

Qin Song casted his gaze downwards, Meng Qiu’s betrayal shocked him and made him truly despair. Meng Qiu used his understanding of the Spirit Tree, accumulated over days and months, planted a seal on the Spirit Tree. All these went undiscovered by them, and until everything happened, did they realise the malicious intent behind Meng Qiu’s hypocrisy. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Long Jiu stupefied with what he had heard, the Spirit Tree was sealed?

Meng Qiu had been planning for this for a long time!

“Now, we have no other solutions. If we rise up and fight, Meng Qiu can destroy the Spirit Tree at any time. We can’t risk....” Qin Song had a trace of bitterness in his forced smile. The most desperate was not how strong the enemy was, but that their most precious thing was in the hands of the enemy. It made them unable to fight back.

Meng Qiu could conquer the entire Soul World effortlessly, by virtue of this, the seal of the Spirit Tree was held by Meng Qiu. If and when they decide to fight back, Meng Qiu would use this point as a form of coercion, keeping their hands tied and capturing them easily.

“What exactly does Meng Qiu have?” Jun Wu Xie, who was standing to one side, suddenly asked. The Soul World had a traitor, and was one with great influence who wanted nothing more than to enslave the whole Soul World.
