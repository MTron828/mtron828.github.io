Chapter 1020: “A Young Girl’s Heart (2)”

“That would naturally be so.” Jun Wu Xie was not surprised in the least.

To have been able to hold all those people hostage against the Thousand Beast City for so many years, the Great Aunt would naturally have been a highly capable person, and she would naturally have prepared against this.

Qu Ling Yue shrugged. She had not seen her mother for a long time and she missed her mother terribly. Whenever she saw the family members of others return, while still not being able to see her own mother, the many times that she had been hopelessly disappointed, had made her begin to feel more and more anxious as time went by.

Seeing Qu Ling Yue looking sad and highly depressed, the little black cat used its tail to poke at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie turned to look at the little black cat blankly and saw that the little black cat was trying to signal to her with its eyes.

“Meow.”

[Mistress, haven’t you yet realised that the Young Miss Qu came to find you seeking for an elixir of assurance?]

Jun Wu Xie lifted an eyebrow. She seldom told anyone about any of the plans she had in her head and it had already become a matter of habit for her. Qu Ling Yue knew absolutely nothing about any of her plans, and having been disappointed countless times in the Thousand Beast City, Qu Ling Yue was desperately wishing for just the slightest glimmer of hope to manifest.

Jun Wu Xie suddenly said: “Dumb Qiao and the others are already stationed outside the city and once those people are brought out of the city, they will then follow behind them. They will be able to find out where all the people have been imprisoned.”

As expected, upon hearing Jun Wu Xie’s explanation, Qu Ling Yue immediately lifted her head, her face filled with delighted surprise.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Qu Ling Yue’s big round eyes which were suddenly shimmering with so much joy and hope and she understood why the little black cat had said that. Just a simple line from her, had been able to help Qu Ling Yue reignite that sense of hope and make her regain her confidence. It was just that simple.

Having seemingly learned something from this, Jun Wu Xie raised a hand and copied what Jun Wu Yao had done before, her tiny hand gently patting Qu Ling Yue lightly on her head.

“Rest assured. Whatever I promised you, I will achieve it.” In order to get the map, she would not allow herself any mistakes in this.

Qu Ling Yue was slightly stunned as she stared at Jun Xie, the pair of cold eyes seemingly having lost some of their chill and filled with a slight tinge of warmth. Although still cold, but these eyes seemed no longer biting.

Although Qu Ling Yue and Jun Xie had known each other for a period of time, those eyes of Jun Xie’s had always made her subconsciously not dare to get too close to the youth. Even coming here to get news from him today, had required her to summon up a great deal of courage. Although Jun Xie was slightly younger than she was, she had never dared to see Jun Xie as an ordinary youth. In her eyes, Jun Xie’s existence had far transcended the boundaries of seniority traditionally limited by age.

In her heart, Jun Xie took on an image of someone who was powerful, cold, wise and farsighted.

But when Jun Xie was now seemingly looking as if he was comforting her, having raised his hand to pat her on the head, Qu Ling Yue suddenly found that her heart had skipped a beat.

Her clear and tiny face suddenly felt a warm surge. Her eyes widened, as she stared at the youth who wouldn’t be considered to be highly exceptionally good looking. Without knowing why, at that moment, she suddenly felt that Jun Xie was actually even more attractive looking than that incredibly handsome man everyone had been drawn to back at the time at the Flame Spirit Auction House.

At that moment, Qu Ling Yue could feel as if several deers were leaping around in her heart and even her breaths were suddenly coming in in quick short gasps. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie looked at the suddenly red flushed face of Qu Ling Yue and her eyes narrowed up.

Her instincts as a doctor thought that Qu Ling Yue was feeling unwell and although their relationship was only one of cooperation, Jun Wu Xie was usually more gentle towards females. She immediately looked up and placed her palm upon Qu Ling Yue’s forehead.
