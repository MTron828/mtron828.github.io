Just as Situ Heng thought that he had escaped danger with Qin Song’s help, Jun Wu Xie exerted more pressure on her knee that was placed behind his back. Under the immense pressure, Situ Heng could not help but yell out in pain.

The moment he opened his mouth, an emerald green seed fell into his mouth.

Jun Wu Xie did not give Situ Heng any time to react as she forcibly raised her hand and clamped his jaw shut and stepped on his chest. Situ Heng swallowed the seed helplessly.

“Miss Jun!” Qin Song exclaimed out in shock.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Qin Song and said in a calm manner, “Don’t be so nervous, that is not the Soul Devourer. It’s just one of Blood Velvet’s seed.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She had said that in such a casual manner, with a trace of iciness her voice but those words made everyone feel a chill.

It’s just one of Blood Velvet’s seed.....

All the spirit that knew the characteristics of the blood velvet flower were very clear that after ingesting its seed, what kind of horrific torture the soul would go through thereafter. Even the spirit bear Brownie had suffered from it and was traumatised dearly. Not to mention, what Brownie suffered at that time was just a small prank played by Blood Velvet. All it did was throw onto Brownie a seed that had already sprouted. That had already sent poor Brownie into an agonising torment. And now, Situ Heng had directly swallowed Blood Velvet’s seed!

Qin Song wanted to say something but Jun Wu Xie’s words cut off.

“Don’t you want to know if he is a traitor to your Soul World?”

Qin Song was stunned momentarily, at this time, the Spirit Lord was by the side added in: “Although I have left the Soul World for a long time, but after all I came from the Soul World and there is a problem with Situ Heng . I believe in Miss Jun’s judgement, if a hidden danger is left behind, this would definitely not be a good thing for the Soul World.”

The words of the Spirit Lord aroused the worry that was in the depths of Qin Song’s heart and he could not ignore the safety of the Soul World by stopping Jun Wu Xie’s actions.

Jun Wu Xie released Qin Song and gestured with her eyes to Blood Velvet.

A bright resplendent smile bloomed on Blood Velvet’s face and small little red specks of light scattered out from the tip of his fingers and those light specks seem to have their own consciousness and they flew towards Situ Heng...

The next moment, there was a bloodcurdling scream that resounded. Situ Heng who was sitting gloomily on the floor suddenly started twitching and slamming himself on the ground, struggling frantically while screaming out. His face had already contorted and his soul was gradually covered by more and more red light specks, very soon, countless red light specks covered his entire body.

The reason why Blood Velvet had came to be the most feared plant spirit was because not only would his seed parasitize living things, but it would bring unbearable pain to the soul. This pain would not bring about any destruction to the soul but the suffering was not inferior to any other forms of torture.

After bouts and bouts of bloodcurdling screams, Situ Heng seemed to have lost all his calmness and consciousness. He only knew that he felt as if his soul was being roasted above a flame as the intensity of the red light specks intensified, burning up his entire being.

Just by looking at Situ Heng by the side, Long Jiu felt his entire body tingle, not to mention what Situ Heng was going through exactly.

Never in his wildest dreams would Jun Wu Xie have ever thought that he would ever undergo such a horrendous torture, every single second was bearable and he could no longer stand it!

“I’ll say it... I’ll say.. I’ll say everything...”
