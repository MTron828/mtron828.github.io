Chapter 184: “Crossing Swords ‘Covertly’ (2)”

“What really happened here, my girl? You sent the Min Butterfly which brought us such alarming news. If anyone had bullied you, I will definitely give you justice.” Qin Yu Yan cooed laughing, her voice gentle and soothing.

Bai Yun Xian’s pulse was normal, and she did not seem to have suffered any internal injuries.

With the situation presented to them now being totally different from what Bai Yun Xian had relayed to the Qing Yun Clan previously, Qin Yu Yan decided to see how it played out.

Bai Yun Xian was crying in her heart, but she had to put on a sheepish mask on her face and said: “I had no choice! Xuan Fei was poisoned! I tried everything I could but I was unable to find a remedy. He is now at death’s door, I thought only Master could save him! So, I..... I made up a story like that.”

The main hall was silent. Bai Yun Xian’s words had left everyone stunned.

What a twist! This story was way different from what they heard.....

When they left Qing Yun Clan, they all knew that someone bold and audacious in Qi had schemed to harm Bai Yun Xian, but what Bai Yun Xian was telling them was a totally different story!

“Xuan Fei? Who’s that?” Qin Yu Yan was still reeling from the news.

Bai Yun Xian managed to blush a little as her cheeks turned a pale pink while she replied looking abashed: “He’s the Second Prince of Qi, and he is now a duke conferred by the new Emperor. He takes great care of me, and we..... have pledged to marry.

Upon hearing that, the delegates were all struck dumb.

If they did not hear this from Bai Yun Xian herself, they would not have believed it.

As a disciple of Qing Yun Clan, in an attempt to save her lover, she relayed false information, mobilising a whole task force, just to save her man!?

Bai Yun Xian turned red as all eyes trained on her, and even Qin Yu Yan lost her smile.

“Cough, Miss Bai had done that for my brother and I should shoulder some part of the responsibility. If my distinguished guests from Qing Yun Clan are willing to lend a hand to treat my brother, I shall personally be grateful.” Mo Qian Yuan chipped in to lend some conviction to the drama unfolding before him.

What was thought to be coercion of one of their people has turned into a desperate cry to save a lover. Their expressions were all livid, after receiving her urgent call for help, they had not only sent the Eldest Miss and a few elders, they even invited some experts with them as well and it turned out to be such a huge joke.

Jiang Chen Qing’s face was black to the extreme, his mouth twitched and he did not utter a single word. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I have specially prepared a welcome feast for everyone, you’ve come a long way. As for my brother’s matter, I will not insist on my brother’s treatment.” Mo Qian Yuan gave an amiable smile.

After looking at Bai Yun Xian for a long time, Qin Yu Yan finally said: “Kingdom of Qi and our Qin Yun Clan have friendly ties and since we are already here, we will surely not turn a blind eye to a friend in need, after the meal, I will go and have a look with Uncle Jiang.”

Mo Qian Yuan gave his ‘startled and pleasantly surprise’ look as he quickly nodded and immediately arranged for someone to lead them to the banquet hall. He took advantage of this opportunity and quickly headed towards his old quarters.

Ever since he had ascended the throne, he naturally had to move out of his previous residence however he had left everything as it was, other than to cherish the memories he had, it was also a place he had left for Jun Wu Xie to stay in and use it as her base.

At this moment, Jun Wu Xie was well prepared and had entered the Palace. To deal with Qing Yun Clan, she had to be extra careful and vigilant and the best way was to know her enemies well hence she had decided to temporarily stay in the Palace so that she could observe their strength personally.
