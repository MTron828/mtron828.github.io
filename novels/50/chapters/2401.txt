Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

During the time Jun Wu Xie and the rest of them “plundered” the things in the mausoleum of the Dark Emperor, almost all the treasures in the mausoleum were taken by them, but there were still some things which they failed to take out...

While looking back at Qiao Chu who had his eyes filled with astonishment, Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows and slowly nodded her head. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At the moment, Qiao Chu and the others sucked in a cold breath. The way they looked at Jun Wu Xie was like looking at a monster!

“Did you really... bring those fellas out? This was the thing you let Brother Ye Sha and the others do?” Qiao Chu stared at Jun Wu Xie. There was already an answer in his mind but he still couldn’t actually believe it.

Those people in the main hall who had never gone to the mausoleum at the Dark Emperor were completely at a loss, not understanding what had Jun Wu Xie done.

“Well, yeah.” Jun Wu Xie replied calmly.

“If it’s not that I have earlier knew that you didn’t know anything about the Upper Realm before you went to the Middle Realm, I will be thinking that you had left them there on purpose!” Fan Zhuo almost wanted to kneel for Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t respond but the conversations between the few of them had raised the curiosity of the people in the main hall to the highest point. The things they spoke to each other were so ambiguous. They could obviously feel that Jun Wu Xie had prepared something huge for the army of the Upper Realm, but the thing was that they didn’t explain it clearly, causing those who were in confusion could only guess by themselves.

“Little Xie, what are you going to do? Stop keep us guessing, just say it!” Jun Qing began to lose his patience. He was really curious about the plans of Jun Wu Xie.

On the other side, it seemed like Mu Qian Fan had thought about something. While holding onto an enlightened face, he looked at Jun Wu Xie.

“I got it!”

The sudden shout of Mu Qian Fan had attracted everyone’s attention in the main hall.

“Young Miss, the monsters in the Heaven’s End Cliff... Is it that you...” Mu Qian Fan looked at Jun Wu Xie with a bit of uncertainty.

Jun Wu Xie slightly nodded. “Right.”

All the portable treasures in the Dark Emperor’s mausoleum had been taken out by Ye Jie, but those huge and scary monsters were being left at the Heaven’s End Cliff, still guarding in the empty mausoleum. Those terror-stricken huge monsters were the first “gift” prepared by Jun Wu Xie for the Upper Realm!

“Monster? What monster? Can you guys just explain it clearly!” Mo Qian Yuan was also getting nervous. The more they listened to it, the more puzzled they were.

While having a complete understanding of Jun Wu Xie’s plan, Hua Yao let out a small sigh. Start from the beginning, Jun Wu Xie had never thought of letting the army of the Upper Realm to enter the Lower Realm smoothly. The cities that were being emptied out weren’t considered as a method to give up. Instead, they were to provide sufficient space for the huge monsters to use as their battlefield.

“The year the Dark Emperor was rumoured to be dead, the Dark Region had built an indestructible mausoleum for him with a lot of deadly traps outside the mausoleum. There were also many powerful huge beasts guarding at the place. When we returned from the mausoleum, those huge monsters were still staying at the Heaven’s End Cliff, and this time, Little Xie had brought all the monsters out to act as a shield against the troops of the Upper Realm!” Hua Yao explained slowly but the shock inside him was actually unexplainable. Whoever had fought against the huge monsters would never forget how frightening was them. Even Lord Meh Meh wasn’t able to take the monster’s attack, just give a think about it and it was easy to realize how scary was the power of the huge monsters!
