3066 On The Eve Of The Battle 3

That lingering kiss conveyed boundless gratitude and love. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, Jun Wu Yao saw a flash of light out of the corner of his eye and broke the kiss to look up behind Jun Wu Xie.

A huge, icy blue flame was floating in mid-air.

“What is that?” Jun Wu Yao eyed the flame suspiciously, it was making him uncomfortable.

“I don’t know either. Earlier when I was in the Seven Worlds of Dream, it kept following me and kept growing as I received more godly powers.” Jun Wu Xie never did find out the flame’s origin but thought it only existed in the Worlds of Dream. She did not expect to see it outside of the Worlds of Dream as well!

“You mean it has been with you since you entered the Worlds of Dream?” Jun Wu Yao’s eyes flashed sharply.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

Jun Wu Yao suddenly rushed towards the flame but it was as if the flame was expecting it and disappeared as soon as Jun Wu Yao made his move.

“Damn it!” Jun Wu Yao cursed.

“What is it?” Jun Wu Xie looked at the unhappy Jun Wu Yao in surprise.

Jun Wu Yao took a deep breath, “After entering the mountain, you weren’t the only one that disappeared. Gu Ying did too!”

“You mean ... that flame ...” Jun Wu Xie suddenly had an ominous feeling.

“As I’ve said, why would the God of Destruction help anyone? In order to break the void, he needs more godly power but the God of Light and the rest would never give it to him. But you are different, you are their last hope and they would surely give you all their powers. And that flame that has been following you has been quietly absorbing the power as well!” Jun Wu Yao took a deep breath. The God of Destruction had predicted everything from the start.

The God of Destruction required both his and Jun Wu Xie’s god power to start the sacrifice. By allowing Jun Wu Xie to regain her power and getting Gu Ying to take the form of a flame to absorb the power from the other gods, he had topped up his own power.

Maybe he had this all planned from the time he concocted the scheme for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms.

“No wonder...no wonder he made Gu Ying tag along.” Jun Wu Xie finally understood what she could never figure out before.

“Let’s leave at once!” Jun Wu Yao had a deep sense of foreboding in his heart.

He had not forgotten the God of Destruction’s plan. If he had enough spiritual power, no matter where he, Jun Wu Xie and the Soul Bone hid in the Three Realms, the God of Destruction could still start the process of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms!

The God of Destruction had been waiting for Jun Wu Xie to regain her powers and for Gu Ying to absorb them as well!

He really managed to kill two birds with one stone!

The God of Destruction dared to allow that to happen only because he had prepared for everything and there was only one final step in his plan!

If the God of Destruction’s plan goes smoothly, then everything would be over!
