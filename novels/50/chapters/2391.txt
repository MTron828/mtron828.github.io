Sacrificial Blood Rabbit and Lord Meh Meh seemed to be noticed what Jun Wu Xie meant in her words, causing them to act cute by making a humph sound. They then jumped off Jun Wu Xie’s lap and landed on the stone table aside with their eyes gleaming brightly and spiritually, seemingly to show their will to fight.

Jun Wu Xie slightly narrowed her eyes and reached out her hand to touch both the little creatures which had been with her for years.

Unconsciously, she let her mind drift into distance.

It had been five years.

[How are you?]

[Just wait a little longer, I am going to fetch you home.]

The figure which she couldn’t wipe it off or rub it off from her memory was like a mark that had been left behind, deeply carved out by a knife, etched into the deepest recesses of her soul. Throughout the whole five years, the wound never healed. Everytime she thought about it, her heart ached.

Jun Wu Xie’s thought was disrupted by the sound of footsteps. She raised her head and saw five familiar figure appeared in front of her,

With a trace of confusion in her eyes, she looked at Qiao Chu and the others, not knowing why they found her.

“Little Xie, the... Just tell us what did you let Brother Ye Sha and the rest do.” Qiao Chu looked at Jun Wu Xie with the look of a curious baby on his face. Just now when Jun Wu Xie were having conversations with Jun Xian and Jun Qing, they were also in the main hall. But there wasn’t any room for them to interrupt their conversations since they were just juniors, causing them to hold their curiosities back the entire time. After Jun Wu Xie left, only then they hurriedly chased after her.

The more they learned about Jun Wu Xie’s personality, the more they wanted to know about the tricks Jun Wu Xie planned for Luo Qingcheng and her troops.

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows a bit. She didn’t expect them to actually come for this.

“You will know when the moment comes.” Jun Wu Xie didn’t plan to tell them now. Wasn’t it more interesting to watch on the spot?

“Just like what I said, Little Xie definitely isn’t going to tell you and you still insist on asking her.” Fan Zhuo let out a sigh. If Jun Wu Xie wanted to tell them, she would be telling them earlier. Jun Xian and Jun Qing also didn’t know about it, they wouldn’t be getting any answers even if they came to ask her.

While holding onto a plaintive expression on his face, the curiosity inside Qiao Chu was just like ants biting here and there. He could only turned his eyes on Ye Sha, Ye Mei and Ye Gu to seek for their help, trying to touch them with his sorrowful eyes.

However...

It didn’t really show any effect.

All Ye Sha and the rest of them could do was just to look away while holding in their laughter.

Just at the moment Qiao Chu decided to unleash his special ability in annoying people to trick Ye Sha and the others into telling him the truth, a figure suddenly walked into their sight, causing everyone to hide the cheerful laughs on their faces.

“Grandmaster Su Ya.”

They didn’t know when did Su Ya come. Her appearance had caused their thoughts of fooling around to disappear.

Yan Bu Gui was Su Ya’s student, whereas they were Yan Bu Gui’s students. According to the hierarchy, it wasn’t wrong for them to call Su Ya ‘Grandmaster’.

In reality, they weren’t that close to Su Ya. But they still remembered the time the Spirit Jade Palace Lord brought Su Ya back, the despair in her eyes had made every single one of them to fall into a huge pain. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She was their Grandmaster. She was also the one who their Master loved the most to the point he was willing to risk his life to protect her.

Looking at the uneasiness shown by Qiao Chu and the others, Su Ya opened her red lips and asked. “Are you guys that free?”

They immediately shuddered. Su Ya had a really domineering character. In their opinions, Yan Bu Gui’s personality was just like a little sheep if it was compared to Su Ya’s personality.

It was really “soft and gentle”!
