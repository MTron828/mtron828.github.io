“Why? Lord Long Yao, do you mean to interfere in the affairs of the 72 Cities?” Jun Wu Xie cocked an eyebrow, while delivering her words in an almost arrogant, taunting manner.

Qiao Chu, Fei Yan, Hua Yao, Fan Zhuo, Rong Rao....the suffering each of them endured would be paid back 10 times, 100 times! She wanted Long Yao to know that her people were not to be trifled with!

Plotting against her was one thing, but plot against her companions and prepare to feel her wrath!

To exact her revenge, it was not enough for Jun Wu Xie to merely kill her target. She wanted to thoroughly embarrass Long Yao in front of the whole arena!

He wanted to protect Bai Zhu and she wanted to kill him in front of his very eyes. She wanted to see how much the infamous Lord Long Yao could take! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A chill flashed across Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

Long Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie angrily, he wished he could tear her limb from limb. However he had no way of doing that, if Jun Wu Xie had challenged Bai Zhu within the parameters of the selection, he could chase her away. But Jun Wu Xie had made clear her grouse with Bai Zhu and that it was a matter that fell into the jurisdiction of the 72 Cities. Long Yao had no cause for action.

Long Yao had never been challenged like this before. But with Jun Wu Xie using His Lord’s name, he felt like he could not breathe. Bai Zhu’s incessant cries for help made Long Yao feel even more frustrated.

Bai Zhu dying was one matter, but for him to die right in front of him, would be of great embarrassment to Long Yao.

In the back room, Fang Jinghe and the rest of the Top Ten exponents were scared stiff. When Jun Wu Xie rushed towards them, each thought they would be the first to go. Luckily it was Bai Zhu and not them who was first.

No matter what status Bai Zhu held in the 72 Cities, it meant little in the Sacred City.

In the arena, the audience craned their necks to catch a glimpse of what was going on high up in the back room. They saw that Jun Wu XIe had her hands on Bai Zhu and could only exclaim in surprise, especially those that were on previously good terms with Bai Zhu. They had no idea what had transpired between Jun Wu Xie and Bai Zhu to result in her wanting to kill him.

Only Dongfang Ku Bi, when seeing Jun Wu Xie’s back, felt a sense of shock.

Maybe people did not realise, but according to reports that Dongfang Ku Bi had received over the past few days, the bloody battles that had been occuring in the Sacred City seemed to all involve the people close to Jun Wu Xie. Having spent some time himself in the Sea Spirit City, Dongfang Ku Bi was very clear that the relationship this group had was not of master and servants but was as close as a group of siblings.

If some of them were hurt, how could Jun Wu Xie take it lying down?

Up on the high platform, Long Yao and Jun Wu Xie were still at an impasse. Facing Bai Zhu’s cries for help, Long Yao’s expression was as dark as it had ever been.

“Yan Hai, this is the Top Ten masters selection, not a place to solve the petty squabbles of the 72 Cities.” Long Yao said through gritted teeth.
