Chapter 1290: “Revisiting the Heaven’s End Cliff (8)”

The man dressed in green arched up an eyebrow as he stared at the man whose face was turning more and more pale and said with a laugh: “You can’t blame anyone for that but fault your own Elder for not being close to your men. Elder Hui here really cares for each and every one of us here in the Flame Demons Palace and for something as important as this, he had naturally come with us here.”

The man from the Palace of All Life continued to glare at the man dressed in green, wishing he could leap over to tear that man into shreds.

“Although the Palace of All Life and the Flame Demons Palace aren’t exactly allies, but we have never been hostile to each other. Why is Elder Hui suddenly attacking us so maliciously?” He could only hope to be able to convince Elder Hui as if this battle was allowed to play out to its end, they would definitely end up completely defeated!

Elder Hui stared coldly at the man and did not say a word, looking like he could not be bothered to waste his breath on the man.

It was instead the man dressed in green who said with a laugh: “Never been hostile? Do you really think we do not know it? When the Palace of All Life were not able to find the location of the Dark Emperor’s tomb, you had schemed in all manner of ways to snatch the maps the other seven palaces held in their hands. It has been noticed that in these recent years, the Palace of All Life had been actively moving about in the Lower Realm.”

The man from the Palace of All Life was taken aback in shock, and a slight tinge of guilt came into his eyes. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Dark Emperor’s tomb was too hard to find and the many elites they had sent down here in the beginning had not returned at all. But seven other palaces among them had acquired for themselves a portion of the map to the Dark Emperor’s tomb and that had pressured the Palace of All Life greatly. The Twelve Palaces had held a fairly equivalent amount of power among them and had always been about neck to neck. But all the various palaces among them had always seeked to overturn that situation wanting to wield authoritative power over the Twelve Palaces.

And the treasures and magical artifacts buried within the Dark Emperor’s tomb would one such chance for all of them!

“Though it should not be unexpected for the Palace of All Life to want to do that, but out of all the undesirable things you did, you really shouldn’t have chosen to go against our Flame Demons Palace.” The man dressed in green said with a sudden glint in his eye!

“What do you mean by that!” The man from the Palace of All Life asked quickly in surprise.

The man in green then said: “The Flame Demons Palace handed our portion of the map to the Qing Yun Clan in the Lower Realm but the Qing Yun Clan was suddenly cleanly obliterated by someone in a blink. We then found out that the method that was employed there had a situation exactly like what it would be like after the Palace of All Life uses their poison. Do you really think that we do not dare to do anything to do after that? You dared to seize the property of the Flame Demons Palace, and you are then destined to pay for it with your life!”

That day, the man in green and Elder Hui had made their way to the Cloudy Peaks and had not expected to encounter with an unexpected situation which gave them no choice at that time but to have to return to the Middle Realm. Never had they expected that when they came to the Cloudy Peaks once again, they discovered that their chosen pawn, the Qing Yun Clan, had been completely obliterated in an extremely short period of time, where every single disciple throughout the Qing Yun Clan was poisoned!

The Flame Demons Palace had initially selected the Qing Yun Clan because the Qing Yun Clan was a highly stable and revered force in the Lower Realm. They had seem unshakable at that time but the Qing Yun Clan was suddenly wiped out and the map they had left with the Qing Yun Clan had gone missing!

One must then ask, with the Qing Yun Clan being the most vaunted clan that specialized in Medicine, who in the Lower Realm would be able to wipe them out completely like that?

Among the Twelve Palaces, besides the Palace of All Life who was most well known for poisons, they couldn’t think of anyone else!

Wiping out the Qing Yun Clan entirely, was not a feat that someone from the Lower Realm would be capable of and the Flame Demons Palace had immediately locked their sights upon the Palace of All Life!

Now that they’ve met them, how could they possibly allow these people from the Palace of All Life to live! ?

The man from the Palace of All Life stared with his eyes wide and his mouth open in incredulity. He had not known about this matter at all! If the Palace of All Life had really gotten the map, how could it be possible that he would know nothing about it? This was obviously a misunderstanding!

However, just as he was about to open his mouth to explain, a tall and slender figure suddenly appeared in between the two groups of people!
