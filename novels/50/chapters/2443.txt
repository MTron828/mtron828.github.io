Chapter 2444: I Want To Get Married (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A little petite figure appeared before the eyes of everyone present.

Jun Wu Xie was wearing a simple long dress as she walked into the hall. A head of jet-black hair still wet from her bath, laid on her shoulders. The fragrance from the bath had washed away the pungent smell of blood. Under the backdrop of water vapour, her clean, pale skin looked soft and delicate.

It was a precious beauty. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When Jun Wu Yao saw Jun Wu Xie, a glimmer of light shone through his eyes. But the oppressive feeling in his chest still lingered.

As soon as he thought about how much Jun Wu Xie has suffered in the past five years, he was unable to look at her and feel the happiness of their reunion.

“Little Xie? Why aren’t you taking a rest?” Jun Xian asked, his expression taut. He saw clearly at the earlier battle that Jun Wu Xie wasn’t injured in any way. But after such a big battle, why was she not resting properly?

Jun Xian swept his gaze to Jun Qing, full of blame.

Jun Qing rubbed his nose helplessly. How was he supposed to know that this little girl would not rest, and instead, galavant around. Father was being too overprotective.

Jun Wu Xie wasn’t rushed to reply Jun Xian, she only stood in the same place as her gaze swept past everyone in the hall. As her gaze passed Jun Wu Yao, it stilled for a moment but that was enough to send ripples through Jun Wu Yao’s heart.

“Grandfather, I have something to speak with you about.” Jun Wu Xie returned her gaze to Jun Xian as she spoke seriously.

“Whatever it is, we can wait till you’re fully rested. You’ve grown thinner over the years. How am I...”

“I want to get married.” Jun Wu Xie replied, with no emotions on her face.

“.....” Jun Xian’s words died in his throat. His eyes widened unbelievingly, he was dumbstruck at the shocking words from Jun Wu Xie.

She...

What did she say?!

Get married!!!

Not only Jun Xian, but everyone in the hall was shell-shocked at Jun Wu Xie’s declaration.

What is going on?

How did a bath.... Turn into a marriage proposal!!

The person who was most shocked was Jun Wu Yao. As soon the words left Jun Wu Xie’s lips, a storm brewed within those calm purple eyes as he stared at that petite figure.

Within moments, a dreadful thought arose in Jun Wu Yao’s mind.

Who is that little demon who is after his little fellow!

After what had happened with Qu Lingyue, Jun Wu Yao found out that his little fellow was very attractive towards women.

Who knew, when he wasn’t around in those five years, that another woman had fallen in love with her!

Since his return, this was the first time where Jun Wu Yao had the desire to kill someone. His ice cold gaze shot towards the Ye trio.

The trio were equally baffled. After experiencing his murderous gaze, they were rendered speechless with fear.

For the past five years, Miss did not step out of Ghost City, they did not discover the presence of any ‘rivals’, seriously.

Jun Xian finally found his voice as he tried hard to push down the shock within his heart. He affected a calm facade as he looked at Jun Wu Xie, “Little Xie ah... you are saying... that you want to get married? Well... who do you intend to be married to?”

Jun Wu Xie’s cold gaze swept through the hall. As he gazed passed each individual, they were immediately besieged with Jun Wu Yao’s murderous glare.

At last, Jun Wu Xie’s eyes stopped at Jun Wu Yao’s figure as she lifted her pale hand, pointing towards him.

“Him.”
