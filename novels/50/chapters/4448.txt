3044 The Lost Temples 4

Moreover, Gu Ying might have already been aware of that connection, which explained why he was trying to win Jun Wu Xie over the first time they met.

In fact, if one thought about it carefully, that may not have been the first time Gu Ying tried to win Jun Wu Xie over. At the Banquet of Heroes, Gu Ying had sent gifts to the Sea Spirit City. Perhaps from that time, Gu Ying was already setting a secret plan in motion.

“If what Gu Ying said is true, then isn’t His Lord making life difficult for him by sending him on this mission but only telling Chi Yan the details knowing full well that Chi Yan does not respect Gu Ying?” At this, Little Black suddenly appeared from Jun Wu Xie’s body and proceeded to set itself on Jun Wu Xie’s lap and rub its furry claws on her.

“His Lord may not actually care for his son at all or have very specific reasons for bringing him to his side and has given him his current status to lull him into a sense of security.” Jun Wu Yao said thoughtfully. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“If this was true, then he would need Gu Ying to go voluntarily. If His Lord wanted to capture and force him into submission, then based on Gu Ying’s level of strength, sending Chi Yan or one of the others would have been more than enough.” Jun Wu Xie continued Jun Wu Yao’s train of thought, feeling like they were on to something.

“You mean Gu Ying wants to win Mistress for his own survival?” Little Black blinked its eyes, not believing that the same Gu Yin who mercilessly slaughtered countless people in the Lower and Middle Three Realms was now asking for help.

“That’s very possible.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

Gu Ying was no fool and knew he was no match for His Lord. If he discovered something, he would find a way to get out of trouble instead of confronting His Lord head on.

Jun Wu Xie’s appearance was his best chance.

In this world, Jun Wu Xie was the only other person with Dual Spirit Rings and said to be the only one who had strength equal to the Lord.

“We don’t need to think too much about this. It will be a long journey and Gu Ying will definitely find opportunities to get close to you.” Jun Wu Yao said to Jun Wu XIe.

Jun Wu Xie nodded, although she had some reservations.

She had fought with Gu Ying several times and had resolved most of her hatred towards him. But as he had killed Rong Ruo’s adoptive father, they could never become allies.

However, would previous bad blood fall to the wayside when faced with a common, more powerful enemy? Nobody knew.

The discussion between Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao came to an end. Su Ruiying on the other hand, sat silently in her carriage with a troubled look on her face. Other than the ghoul masked man, she had a red mahogany box with her in the carriage.

Su Ruiying placed the box on her lap and started to rearrange its contents with both hands. She was constantly looking into the box, with her lips pursed and tension written all over her face.
