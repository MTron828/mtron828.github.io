Chapter 3116 Iron Blood Empress

Jun Wu Xie was stunned momentarily and as she looked at Qu Ling Yue’s eyes being welled up with tears, she felt like she was looking at her naive and innocent eyes from the past.

Jun Wu Xie stood up, extended her arms and wrapped them around Qu Ling Yue, all without saying a word.

This was the first time she had embraced the woman who was once known as her wife.

Jun Wu Xie realised that she had not changed at all, her petite frame felt so weak in her arms.

Under the mask of strength and decisiveness was still a scared little girl.

The difference was....

The little girl had her own beliefs and it was those beliefs that made her grow strong.

Qu Ling Yue closed her eyes and enjoyed the warmth of Jun Wu Xie’s embrace, longing for it to last knowing that it could never belong to her.

“Wu Xie, thank you.”

The soft thank you came straight from her heart.

“I don’t regret falling in love with you, you were better than anybody else.”

The many years of repressed love burst forth at that moment and tears started steaming down her face.

Jun Wu Xie just held her silently, she knew what was in her heart but could not reciprocate.

She had said in the past that she could be Qu Ling Yue’s greatest protector and support but she could not give her what she wanted the most.

Under the moonlight, it was silent.

Lei Chen stood in the corner of the garden, confused by what he was witnessing, not knowing what emotions he was feeling at that time.

After a moment of silence, Qu Ling Yue pushed away from Jun Wu Xie, stood up and wiped away her tears. Even though her eyes were still filled with tears, she was smiling radiantly.

“I’m about to start a new life and will not be bogged down by the past. I have repaid your kindness to me and protected what you asked me to protect. We are even.” Qu Ling Yue said with a smile, which would have been convincing were it not for the tremble in her voice.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly. She felt guilty towards Qu Ling Yue and would never be stingy with what she asked for.

No matter what direction Qu Ling Yue chose to take in the future, she would support her silently.

Qu Ling Yue’s smile turned even brighter and she took a step forward and planted a light kiss on Jun Wu Xie’s cheek.

So light...

That it felt like a gentle breeze kissing her.

“Really even.” Qu Ling Yue stared at Jun Wu Xie.

Without waiting for an answer, Qu Ling Yue turned around and started to walk away. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jun Wu Xie was feeling confused but could not do anything.

When she reached the entrance of the garden, Qu Ling Yue saw the man who had been waiting for her.

Lei Chen was surprised and felt embarrassed at being caught.

“I..I was just passing by...”

“Lei Chen.” Qu Ling Yue said suddenly.

“Yes?”

“Do you mind?” Qu Ling Yue said to him.

“Mind what?” Lei Chen did not know what she was talking about.

“My past, all the things I’ve done before.” Qu Ling Yue replied.

Lei Chen shook his head without hesitation, “You’re better than anyone, I’ve always seen that. All these years, you...”

Before he could finish, Qu Ling Yue put her finger on his lips to shush him.

“Do you dare to marry me?”

Lei Chen’s eyes grew large in disbelief and he removed her hand from his lips, grasping it tightly and exclaimed in delight, “Marrying you would be the greatest joy in my life!”
