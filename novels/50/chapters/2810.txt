Duan Qi was satisfied with the promise of Jun Wu Xie, even though she knew that Jun Wu Xie had promised to attend the ceremony instead of marrying one of the maidens. But Duan Qi knew very well, how could a teenager of this age resist beauty in the first place?

As long as Jun Wu Xie was willing to go to The Sacred Maiden Tribe. They had plenty of opportunities.

“Very good, now that Lord Yan has promised, it should be rather soon. I have to rush back to the Holy Mountain as soon as possible to prepare for the marriage. It is better to make a little preparation today, how about we set off tomorrow?” Duan Qi seized this chance to push it earlier.

“Alright.” Jun Wuxie responded neatly.

Duan Qi got her answer and did not stay long. After exchanging a few more words with Jun Wu Xie, she immediately left.

After Duan Qi left, Qiao Chu and the others who had been listening in the back room slowly appeared. But for a while, everyone looked at Jun Wu Xie sitting in a chair silently. No one dared to mention anything.

Jun Wu Xie’s father wants to marry Senior Zi Fei? What was that!?!

Obviously, this is the last thing they wanted to see. They had never expected such a coincidence.

“Well ... wasn’t Senior Zi Fei captured by The Sacred Maiden Tribe when the Upper Realm was in turmoil?” Qiao Chu murmured out.

“I think it’s possible that Senior Zi Fei may be forced to helplessness, just like Uncle Jun Gu. Both are controlled by people in the Upper Realm. If this is the case, Little Xie must go to the Holy Mountain this time. He can save Uncle Jun Gu and Senior Zi Fei. Wouldn’t it be better? “Fan Zhuo immediately intervened and gave a thumbs up to Qiao Chu.

This guy was clever at times!

“This possibility is very high. Little Xie, if you are going to the Holy Mountain, you need to be prepared. If you choose to rescue Uncle Jun Gu and Senior Zi Fei, your identity as the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City may be disclosed. If you want to get closer to His Lord, I’m afraid you have to make another plan.” Rong Ruo looked at Jun Wu Xie and said. The whole world knew that Jun Wu Xie had brought forth the Sea Spirit City, and caused such a big turmoil in order to approach His Lord and find the whereabouts of Jun Gu.

And this motive has been achieved. It was just that the person who brought Jun Gu to Jun Wu Xie, was not Hi Lord, but Duan Qi. Although the process was different, the results were the same.

Just that...

Rong Ruo looked at Jun Wu Yao again, and could not help but sigh.

Jun Wu Xie’s plan was not only to save Jun Gu, but also for Jun Wu Yao’s life and death worm, and to stop the sacrifice of theThree Realms ... But once Jun Gu was rescued, Jun Wu Xie’s current situation would be all in vain, she can only start all over again.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. Rong Ruo had already thought of everything she said. She must go to the Holy Mountain, she too must save them!

“You prepare in advance. Duan Qi said that there should not be too many people going to the Holy Mountain. You, Wu Yao, Ye Sha and Ye Mei are to go. Ye Gu is to remain in Sea Spirit City. Let him first prepare some ships outside Sea Spirit City. Once there is any abnormality, all the members board the ship and leave the place temporarily, and sail to the remote island to gather. “Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and explained the plan in her heart.

Everything needed to be done step by step. She did not intend to give up on anyone. It all depends on how she can achieve both!

After getting the words of Jun Wu Xie, everyone headed off separately to prepare.
