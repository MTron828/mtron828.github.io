Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Han Shu did not hear the conversation between Yan Xi and Duan Qi, but Jun Wu Xie heard everything clearly.

On the surface, Duan Qi seemed to warn Yan Xi to be dutiful. But these words when heard by a woman with admiration, it would arouse great hatred.

Yan Xi was interested in Jun Gu. With Han Zi Fei’s sudden appearance, Yan Xi felt that Han Zi Fei had snatched away the person who should belong to her. In addition, Duan Qi repeatedly compared Han Zi Fei to her. The comparisons had created a big gap between them and deep hatred had started to manifest towards Han Zi Fei.

According to Han Zi Fei’s words, after she was married to Jun Gu, the Lord would not let Yan Xi leave immediately. Duan Qi knew that taking Yan Xi away meant that Yan Xi might get along with Han Zi Fei in the future. But she tried to provoke them and create conflicts so as to block Han Zi Fei.

Jun Wu Xie sneered in her heart. Duan Qi’s method of killing one with another’s knife was really neat!

Han Shu did not wait for Jun Wu Xie’s response. She found that Jun Wu Xie’s gaze had turned very cold. She couldn’t help but be surprised as she whispered, “Lord Yan?”

Jun Wu Xie came back to her senses and looked at Han Shu: “Who is that person there?”

Han Shu glanced at Yan Xi as a look of disdain flashed past her eyes. She said softly: “Her name is Yan Xi, she is a maiden of the Sacred Maiden Tribe but her bloodline is so thin that she is not really considered our tribe member. She is very careful as she knows that she has an impure bloodline and has poor psychic force, so she learned witchcraft with Elder Luo. She has some skills, but these side-doors skills could not be recognised. But she is lucky enough that she had gained the Lord ‘s appreciation. Previously, she was arranged to serve next to Lord Jun Gu. ”

Han Shu despised Yan Xi from the bottom of her heart. If she was very humble in front of Han Zi Fei, then Yan Xi was just as unimportant to her. But ... Yan Xi could survive with her witchcraft, whose status in the Sacred Maiden Tribe gradually surpassed her. This made Han Shu extremely disgusted with Yan Xi.

It was jealousy.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t pay attention to Han Shu’s jealousy. But in Han Shu’s words, Jun Wu Xie caught a crucial piece of news.

Elder Luo ... Witchcraft ...

Jun Wu Xie subconsciously linked these two points with Luo Qingcheng and the life and death worm.

“Elder Luo?” Jun Wu Xie deliberately looked at Han Shu. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Han Shu looked at Jun Wu Xie with admiration and naturally she spilled everything.

“Elder Luo is an elder who cares for the Sacred Land. She has the same qualifications as Elder Duan, but she rarely asks about things within the clan. She usually only focuses on the Sacred Land and Witchcraft. Yes, the strongest of the Top Ten experts, Luo Qingcheng is the child of Elder Luo. ”

Really!

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes slightly. This Elder Luo was indeed related to Luo Qingcheng. She began to wonder if the witchcraft she studied, could she find more clues about the life and death worm?

“However, Yan Xi is not qualified to compare with Elder Luo. If Lord Yan can enter the Sacred Land to practice in the future and meet Elder Luo, you will be able to tell the difference between the two.” Han Shu looked at Jun Wu Xie shyly, her expression all coquettish .

Jun Wu Xie pretended not to see it.
