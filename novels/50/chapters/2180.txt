Time passed slowly as minutes and seconds ticked by and the oppressive silence in the square made even simple breathing more stifling. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The bright sun hung up in the mid sky and the gentle rays of the morning sun had gradually turned into a blazing hot sun. Su Ya who had been drenched in oil started to feel extremely hot due to the scorching rays of the sun. Ba He ordered people to feed her a few pills a few times and from the number of times she had taken the pills, it could be seen that she was an arrow at the end of its flight and she had to depend on the pills to hang onto her last breath.

What Ba He did was just as he had said before. If the little old man did not appear, he would not let Su Ya die before sunset.

Su Ya’s condition was worsening with each passing moment, but she couldn’t incite Ba He to kill her out of anger. Under the harsh rays of the sun, the heat became unbearable for her. She was already at the brink of death and despite eating so many pills, she could feel her impending doom. Since she was already just a small step away from death, a sudden glint of determination flashed by her eyes. She squeezed up every last ounce of energy she had left in her as she opened her mouth and bit her tongue with all her might!

A black shadow flashed past, before she had bitten down. Ba He had rushed up onto the high platform and his big hand clamped her jaw firmly in place rendering her completely immobile, unable to move half an inch.

“Time hasn’t arrived yet. Hmm? Want to die, not so easy.” Ba He’s eyes flashed a trace of viciousness.

Su Ya screamed at Ba He, and her eyes could not wait to swallow him up.

A loud crack resounded!

Ba He dislocated Su Ya’s jaw, and the dislocated jaw ended Su Ya’s last hope. Her fiery gaze looked as if she wanted to burn Ba He into ashes.

“Hate me? Unfortunately, you are too weak. You are destined to be a loser, a pawn, a bait. Maybe after your master appears, I should let him look at you being tortured to death bit by bit. Then again maybe letting you witness his tragic death is also a good choice.” Ba He’s eyes flashed coldly with a sinister glint, evidently he treated Su Ya’s torture as a pastime.

Su Ya could no longer speak and could only glare angrily at Ba He.

All of a sudden, a gust of torrential wind swept wildly into the square, hurling up clouds of dust!

A hint of triumph flashed by Ba He’s eyes, while Su Ya’s eyes were filled with despair.

“Treating my disciple like that, are you really not afraid of death?” A sorrowful and low voice echoed throughout the square. Appearing from within the torrential wind, a figure suddenly appeared in the eyes of everyone!

With both hands behind him, the little old man stood in front of everyone, and on his face was an anger that had never been seen before!

The gust of wind lingering around him gradually dissipated as he appeared, leaving a circle of swirling dust around his body.

All the Nine Temple disciples were shocked to see the little old man who suddenly appeared. Many of them were once students of the Cloudy Brook Academy, so they recognized the old man that had appeared in front of them!

Standing in front of them, wasn’t that the headmaster of Cloudy Brook Academy?

The headmaster of Cloudy Brook Academy rarely appeared in front of people, but when they graduate from the academy, he would personally pin the badges bearing the crest of Cloudy Brook Academy, and having this badge was their pride.
