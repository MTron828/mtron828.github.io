Chapter 3000 Soul Transfer 3

“I’m very happy just to see you again. At least I’m still alive, but my sister....” Rong Ruo’s eyes were downcast. All these years, he had waited for his sister to wake up so he could return everything to her. But he never expected when the day finally came, it would also be a final goodbye.

The soul that laid dormant for over 10 years awoke one last time just to protect her only remaining kin.

After witnessing the brutal slaughter of her parents, Rong Ruo’s main soul had already lost the will to live and the only thing that made her willing to surface was the person closest to her.

At last, she finally chose to stand up and protect her loved one.

Rong Ruo would never forget the smile on his sister’s face the moment she pushed him out of their body.

[Big brother, leave.]

Those were simple words but words that Rong Ruo had waited for over 10 years to hear. The siblings’ reunion was also their final farewell.

All these years, whenever he saw his face, it was like looking at his sister. All these years of hope and expectation had brought nothing but destruction.

Rong Ruo did not think he would survive, he had given up everything and only wanted to protect his companions. However his sister had protected him.

It was at that moment that Jun Wu Xie finally realised why Rong Ruo had been so reluctant to accept Fei Yan’s romantic feelings. It was not due to dislike but he was unable to as although he was in a female body, he had the soul of a true man. That was why Rong Ruo usually did not wear female clothes and portrayed a more elegant image than a normal man.

Jun Wu Xie pursed her lips, she was on an emotional roller coaster. She should have been happy that Rong Ruo was still alive but she was sad at what he had gone through.

“There will be a way.” Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath and looked at Rong Ruo with a slight twinkle in her eye.

“Gu Ying previously managed to get housed in a new body, you can too. We just have to get His Lord to tell us the method and you can be reborn.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were bright, she would not give up hope. Although as long as his soul was not destroyed, once everything had been settled, he could get on the Reincarnation Path and be reincarnated, however, he would lose all his memories and this was not something Jun Wu Xie and the others wanted.

Those precious memories belonged to them and the group. As long as there was even a sliver of hope, they would not give up.

Puppet Rong Ruo smiled as gently as all those years ago. The smile seemed to mask the pain he was going through and brought to mind the carefree and happy times from before.

“My matter can wait, there’s no rush. You need to deal with Su Ruiying first. I notice that you’ve hidden that puppet away, you’ve done well Little Xie. But to protect your previous conversations, you need to think of a way to deal with that puppet.” Rong Ruo said seriously. He understood from his experience in Su Ruiying’s house that each puppet had a specific purpose.

Su Ruiying’s interest in making puppets with people’s souls was twofold, firstly, it was a hobby and secondly, she could obtain information on people that she wanted monitored.
