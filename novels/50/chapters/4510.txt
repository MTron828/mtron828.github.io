Chapter 3106 Finale 5

Jun Wu Xie gently eased herself onto the ground as she watched the God of Destruction’s body disappear. The Selvan armour came off her body and turned back into an ear pin that she could hold in the palm of her hand.

She held the pin in her hand and unconsciously tightened her grip until it pierced her skin but she did not feel any pain.

As she watched the golden light that covered the Holy City slowly fade away, she felt no joy on the inside.

She was victorious but did not feel happy at all.

But...

She had lost her lover, who could never be replaced.

“I won, we’ve won.” She unclenched her fist and looked at the Face of Selvan which retained its beauty even though it was stained by her blood.

Warm tears rolled down her face and fell into her palm, mixing with her blood. She was a picture of pain and sadness.

“Can....I cry now?” She whispered to nobody as the tears started dripping off her face, showing her hopelessness.

She had won but she would never get him back.

It was not the victory she wanted.

She was like a child, squatting helplessly on the ground. Heaving and crying but the pressure made her feel like choking and there was no sound.

When she was fighting, there was no room to feel sad or unhappy.

Who would ease her pain now that the battle was over?

She may have won the battle but she felt a huge hole in her heart which was the most painful wound she had ever felt.

In the midst of the destruction, Fei Yan felt that the danger had passed. He heard the entire exchange between Jun Wu Xie and the God of Destruction and knew that it was all over. But...

Where was Little Xie?

Fei Yan started wandering around until finally, he felt Jun Wu Xie.

Who was squatting on the ground, sobbing silently.

“LIttle Xie...” Fei Yan said, at a loss of how to continue.

Nobody could understand Jun Wu Xie’s hurt and pain at losing a loved one as well as he could.

Fei Yan did not say another word. He squatted next to her and held her in his arms, comforting his friend in his own way.

Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu had rushed to the scene and could see Jun Wu Xie being held by Fei Yan from afar.

Both their hearts became heavy when they saw that Jun Wu Xie had won but lost Jun Wu Yao in the process.

The world had been liberated thanks to her but she would forever be living with those demons with no hope for salvation.

The two looked at each other silently and walked over to Jun Wu Xie. Han Zi Fei put Hua Yao down to one side and embraced Jun Wu Xie as well.

“Don’t cry my child...Wu Yao would not have wanted to see you this way.” Han Zi Fei put aside her own pain and held her daughter. She knew that no matter what she said, it would not be of use in that moment.

Jun Wu Xie lost an irreplaceable lover.

Jun Gu stood there clenching his fists, not knowing what to say. No language in the world had the words to express the situation.
