Han Zi Fei was very happy that Jun Wu Xie was powerful and adhered to her own principles. If Jun Wu Xie relied on her own capabilities to become strong like she was today, Han Zi Fei would be very proud of her.

If she hurt others in order to gain strength for herself or even took the lives of others, this would definitely be unacceptable to Han Zi Fei.

She didn’t want her child to do anything cruel in order to achieve her goals. Because such a person would never succeed or find real happiness. Such a person would only live in calculations and struggles forever.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Han Zi Fei. For the first time, she saw Han Zi Fei with such a serious expression. The expression was as if an elder was examining an ignorant junior. Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes slightly, her left hand slowly raising with a pale blue spirit ring gradually condensed from her hands.

Under the night sky, she had on a wistful expression.

“This Spirit Ring belongs to my Grandmaster.” Jun Wu Xie’s voice was somewhat suppressed.

“At that time, we were pushed into a desperate situation by the Upper Realm. He chose to explode so that we could escape and live. This Spirit Ring was handed to me before he blew himself up.”

Han Zi Fei was a little stunned. When Jun Wu Xie had talked about the past before, she just described it with a few simple sentences. For those painful and depressed memories, she never talked about it to Han Zi Fei. Han Zi Fei only knew it that she was going to find her father, her master, her Grandmaster, but she didn’t know ...

“He must be very happy.” Han Zi Fei said suddenly.

Jun Wu Xie looked up with a hint of confusion in her eyes.

Han Zi Fei smiled gently. She reached out her hand and rubbed Jun Wu Xie’s head naturally.

“His disciple has taught such a good disciple like you. He must be very happy and liked you very much. Spirit Ring is extremely precious to any strong man. In the Upper Realm, there were once many Spirit Ring exponents. Even at the moment of their death, they will not give their Spirit Ring to anyone. To the Spirit Ring exponent, the Spirit Ring is their other soul. Your Grandmaster chose to pass the Spirit Ring to you is to hope that you can become strong in the future. That you will be so strong that you will never be hurt by anyone. And what you do now is what he expected. So ... if he knows this, he will be very happy.”

Jun Wu Xie opened her mouth. She didn’t know what her Grandmaster was thinking. She only knew that whenever she used this Spirit Ring, there would always be a burst of blood in her heart, soaking her cold heart.

“Don’t be so distressed, if you let your master and Grandmaster see it, I’m afraid they’ll be unhappy.” Han Zi Fei pinched the tip of Jun Wu Xie’s nose, and was very relieved.

Her Little Xie hasn’t become an unscrupulous person and she was happy about that.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Han Zi Fei in a daze. She always felt that Han Zi Fei looked at her too gently and unknowingly, she got used to her tenderness, but ...

She came with a purpose tonight!

“I’m looking for you because ...” Jun Wu Xie frowned and thought about how to voice it out.

Han Zi Fei said directly: “You came to me because of the marriage which is happening a few days later?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded honestly.

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie with a smile, “You don’t want me to marry Jun Gu, because ... is he your father?”
