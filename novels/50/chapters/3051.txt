“I’ve waited for you for a long time. I don’t remember how much time has passed. Fortunately, you are finally here.” The woman was relieved.

“Who are you? Do I know you?” Jun Wu Xie frowned slightly, the woman’s appearance was so strange, but somehow, she could clearly feel that the other party did not have any hostility towards her.

The woman smiled slightly and closed her umbrella: “You don’t know me, I don’t know you, but I know that you will come one day to get your own things back.”

“My own things? I don’t understand what you are talking about.” Jun Wu Xie became more and more confused. At this moment the black cat suddenly jumped out of her chest and watched everything around her cautiously.

“Mistress, it’s so weird here, I can’t feel the breath of Lord Jue.” The black cat looked at everything alertly. It had been in Jun Wu Xie’s body. It knew everything that Jun Wu Xie experienced, but ... ... Weirdly, like Jun Wu Xie, it came into this mist without knowing it.

The high mountains that appeared before them seemed to have never existed before.

“This is your cat? It’s so cute.” The woman looked at the black cat and smiled.

The black cat squinted his eyes and did not respond.

The woman seemed to be aware of Jun Wu Xie’s vigilance, and she could not help saying. “Please rest assured that I have no malicious intentions towards you. I have been waiting for you for a long time here, just to wait for you to rescue me, but ... ... I have some contradictions in my heart. I look forward to freedom. But at the same time, I am afraid that you will really appear ... ”

The woman’s brow furrowed slightly, and there was a hint of struggle in her eyes.

“What are you talking about? Where is this? Why am I here?” Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath and tried to calm herself as much as possible.

“This is the Seven World of Dreams.” The woman said slowly.

“Seven World of Dreams?” Jun Wu Xie puzzled.

The woman sighed softly: “Is it because a powerful person made you come here?”

“Yes.” Jun Wu Xie thought of His Lord.

“This place used to be a God’s paradise, but it eventually became a God’s hell. I think I probably knew what the person said to you before he lured you here. Since you came, then there are some things you should know.” The woman slowly told Jun Wu Xie, the history that had long been forgotten by people.

The Three Realms did not exist. It was gradually created because of the minds of the Gods. This world originally did not have any human beings. It was the Gods who created people in order to enrich the world. They stood in the paradise of the Gods, looking at the interesting life of human beings, looking at the world created by themselves.

All this should have been going on all the time, but the Gods were not eternally powerful. Only by breaking away from this world, breaking through the void could obtain truly powerful power and this kind of power required a great price.

The Gods knew the talents of this method, but they did not want to hurt the human beings they created. They realized that their lives were already very satisfying.

But...

Not every God thought so.

Among the Gods, there was a God representing destruction. He seeked power and strength. After learning about the existence of the broken void, he changed his mind. He tried to destroy everything in order to gain the supreme power.
