Han Zi Fei also noticed the appearance of Yan Xi, and what attracted her attention even more was the obvious hostility in Yan Xi. This hostility intrigued Han Zi Fei. If she remembered correctly, this person was a member of the Sacred Maiden Tribe who had always been at the side of Jun Gu. However, she had never seen this person before, so where did the strong hostility come from?

A smile crossed Han Zi Fei’s lips.

“This is...?” Han Zi Fei said.

“I am Yan Xi. I was once a member of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, but just a few years ago, I was arranged by His Lord to take care of Lord Jun Gu’s daily life.” Yan Xi said with a contented voice as if she was pleased with her position, while looking provocatively at Han Zi Fei.

Han Zi Fei raised her eyebrows slightly.

Oohhhh, it had been many years, and there was a little vixen hanging around my husband?

The smile on the corner of her mouth could not help but deepen, and at the same time, Jun Wu Xie shot a secret gaze at Han Zi Fei.

Yan Xi has already appeared, but Jun Gu has yet to be seen. Jun Wu Xie was bidding her time.

“Yan Xi, what about Lord Jun Gu?” Duan Qi asked the moment she saw Yan Xi.

Yan Xi’s eyes were locked on Han Zi Fei, even though she didn’t want to admit it, but Han Zi Fei was astonishingly beautiful. Based on her devastating beauty, she was capable of causing the downfall of a city or state; countless men would fall down in worship at her skirt. And as soon as she thought about how soon Jun Gu would be marrying Han Zi Fei, Yan Xi couldn’t hold back the hatred in her heart in any way.

What right did this crazy and ignorant woman have to stand next to Lord Jun Gu?!!

“Lord Jun Gu is still resting. He asked me to come take a look first.” Yan Xi said blankly. Actually, she came on her own volition, Jun Gu had not instructed her to do so. Of course, she would never reveal that.

What she wanted was for Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei to loathe each other.

Duan Qi said nothing more.

Han Zi Fei also turned and walked away, casting Yan Xi, who was full of anger, aside.

Jun Wu Xie had planned on dealing with Yan Xi but now it seemed like Han Zi Fei had planned on taking care of Yan Xi, so Jun Wu Xie had no chance to strike.

“Since Lord Jun Gu won’t be here for a while, then City Lord Yan, why don’t you sit for a while?” Duan Qi tried to ease the tension as she smiled at Jun Wu Xie.

The matter of Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu had already made her feel inadequate, now, the crux is to stabilise the situation with Jun Wu Xie.

After all, the hope for the future of the Sacred Maiden Tribe rested entirely on Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie nodded his head slightly and walked to her seat. Perhaps it was because Duan Qi knew that Jun Wu Xie wanted to ingratiate herself to Jun Gu, so she had arranged Jun Wu Xie’s seat to be close to Jun Gu’s. It also happened to be diagonally across from Han Zi Fei.

Yan Xi’s position was on the other side of Jun Gu. When she took her seat, she glared at Han Zi Fei, there was more resentment in her eyes than in Han Shu’s.

Within the hall, the elders of the Sacred Maiden Tribe had obviously seen what had transpired. Han Shu and Han Zi Fei have found each other disagreeable for many years, and they were no longer surprised at the animosity between those two. However, Yan Xi and Han Zi Fei hadn’t much contact with each other, and so with regard to Yan Xi’s strong hostility towards Han Zi Fei... Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As long as one was not stupid, one could figure out the reason.

Yan Xi’s previous status in the Sacred Maiden Tribe was not high, she only learned some witchcraft.
