Jun Wu Xie hesitated and her footsteps slowed as well. Her eyes drooped but she didn’t say anything.

The once lively atmosphere suddenly calmed down and even Qiao Chu who was quite insensitive also noticed Jun Wu Xie’s peculiar behaviour. Everyone’s focus was on Jun Wu Xie.

“Little Xie... What exactly happened?” Qiao Chu carefully asked.

Jun Wu Xie furrowed her brow as she slowly looked up at Qiao Chu and the others who had concerned by eager eyes, and she finally whispered: “Remember the time when we were in the Spirit World, the matter involving Situ Heng?”

Qiao Chu and others were shocked, as they suddenly remembered the things that were almost forgotten by them.

At the beginning when they were in Spirit World, Situ Heng, along with Qin Song and Long Jiu, helped stabilize the chaotic energy within Jun Wu Xie. However, he harboured ill intentions and schemed to destroy Jun Wu Xie’s soul during the process. If Jun Wu Yao hadn’t found out in time and revealed the scheme, the consequence was simply unimaginable.

“Don’t tell me.... The traitors in the Soul World acted on their scheme?” asked Fan Zhuo, frowning.

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

“When we reached the Soul World, the rebels had already enacted their plan, and they admitted the people of the Upper Realm into the Soul World. The Upper Realm was trying to use the Soul World to carry out the Soul Sacrificing Event, and thereby achieving their purpose of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms.”

Jun Wu Xie’s words caused everyone to be frightened. Jun Wu Yao then narrated to everyone what had actually happened in the Soul World, including the relation between the Soul Sacrificing Event and Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms.

Even though they knew that the Upper Realm’s plan had been destroyed, but after hearing everything that Jun Wu Yao said, the shock and fear within the hearts of everyone did not disappear for a long while. They could not imagine that if Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were not coincidentally in Soul World, how the situation would have evolved.

If the plan of Upper Realm was really successful, then the Three Realms would really be destroyed!

Who would have thought that, besides what they did in the Middle Realm, that the Upper Realm would still have a scheme like this?

“So, the Soul World is now completely sealed? If Grand Master and Master wants to re-enter the Three Realms, they would have to wait till the Soul World reopens?” Qiao Chu gulped, the Soul World’s closure meant that no new soul could enter the Reincarnation Path, and there will be no newborn within the Three Realms for the foreseeable future!

Jun Wu Xie nodded. “This is our last resort as the Upper Realm have too many schemes. It’s impossible for Soul World to defend well. Although we managed to put a stop to their plans this time, it’s hard to be certain that we will be able to do so without further problems.”

Sealing Soul World was the safest method, and with the current state of the Spirit Tree, unfortunately it would not be able to destroy the Soul Sacrificing Event within this short span of time. To cut off the path which the Upper Realm intended to use for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, this was the only feasible method.

Everyone nodded with lingering fears.

The news that they brought back was too shocking, and they found it somewhat difficult to digest at the moment.

Only one person, who after hearing everything, didn’t have any shock displayed in her eyes, but with only a trace of relaxation. After a moment, the person suddenly thought of something and called out: “Wu Xie.”

The gentle call drifted into Jun Wu Xie’s ears and she lifted her head to look at the person who had spoken.

Zi Fei stood behind the crowd and looked at Jun Wu Xie, her eyes held complex yet gentle emotions.

“Elder Zi Fei.” Jun Wu Xie slightly nodded to Zi Fei.
