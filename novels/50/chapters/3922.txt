Chapter 2518: Sea Spirit City (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In the city palace of the Sea Spirit City, there was a dignified charming man be seated on the highest position, dressed in a sumptuous clothing, seemingly extravagant. The age showed by his face did not seem to be more than thirty years old, but nobody would actually take it as his real age.

Whoever that was capable of holding the post of the seventy-two city lords must have extremely outstanding abilities. If one did not rule the city with a heavy hand, and wasn’t able to oppress the residents in the city due to one’s lack of power, then death would be the only thing that was awaiting them in their futures.

Being in such a place where everything was spoken through power, the higher the position one held meant that there would be more people who were coveting the said post.

Yan Wan was able to succeed to the position of the city lord of the Sea Spirit City because he was gifted with exceedingly great talent. Though his parents were just some nobody living inconspicuously in the Sea Spirit City, they had given birth to Yan Wan who was such a talented genius. As Yan Wan got older, his strength too, grew drastically.

Hundred years ago, he murdered his predecessor and hung his head on the city gate of the Sea Spirit City, and it was from that moment on, he became the owner of the Sea Spirit City.

It was also from that moment on, Yan Wan began to undergo a series of assassinations coming from various challengers. The fact that he was able to hold firmly onto this position for so many years was already enough to prove his strength.

And now, Yan Wan’s eyes fell onto the teenage boy who had just walked in from the outside. Something flashed across the sharp eyes but it was then quickly hidden.

Jun Wu Xie strode into the main hall as she glanced over Yan Wan who was sitting on the highest seat. Gotta say that Yan Wan and Yan Hai did look similar in their faces, it was just that compared to the frivolousness in Yan Hai, he was more steady in his disposition.

Even though Jun Wu Xie had never interacted with her biological father, she had noticed that the way Yan Wan looked at her was so cold and indifferent that those kind of gaze shouldn’t be existing within the family in the first place. Rather than saying that he was looking at his son, it was as well better to say that those vigilant eyes were looking at his future foe.

A breeze of understanding blew across Jun Wu Xie’s heart. Her guess was right. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The policy of the Upper Realm had polished off the kinship in the minds of the local people. They only live for the power and strength, as for things like blood related relatives, to them, they were just their rivals and competitors.

Without leaving any sign, Jun Wu Xie hid her thoughts and stood into Yan Wan’s field of sight.

“You’re back?” Yan Wan suddenly spoke but there wasn’t any solicitude and smile heard in his tone. It was cold and icy with plain solemn, as if the one standing in front of him wasn’t his son but just an ordinary subordinate.

“Yes,” answered Jun Wu Xie crisply. With the personality Yan Hai had, she didn’t think that he would behave any respectfully in front of Yan Wan.

As expected, the coldness shown by Jun Wu Xie to Yan Wan had not gotten him alert. Instead, everything felt normal to him. He then looked at Jun Wu Xie and asked emotionlessly, “How was the hunt?”

Neither did he asked her if she was tired nor did he asked her if she was injured, Yan Hai’s attitude towards her was brief and businesslike.

And this was exactly what Jun Wu Xie was hoping for. Without having to feign her respect, she replied in a cold voice, “It was a total of one hundred and seventy-eight Sea Spirit Beasts.”

“Oh?” The gaze in Yan Hai’s eyes slightly changed. While staring at Jun Wu Xie who was being cold towards him, a trace of sharpness went across his eyes, but his gaze immediately went back to normal after that.

“Well, for the result of your first hunt, this is not bad.”

Jun Wu Xie did not think so.

It just happened that Yan Hai’s crew met a large group of Sea Spirit Beasts during the hunt, resulting them in having the highest hunting number among the crews that were sent to the sea. Even though the amount of Sea Spirit Beasts hunted by them was far beyond the others, the comment given to him was only two words – not bad.
