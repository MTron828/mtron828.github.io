Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

As a series of rattles was heard, the chain that was locking their hands broke apart and fell onto the ground with a clanking sound...

The manacles on their hands had been removed but those soul entities still hadn’t recovered from the shock after quite a long time. Every single one of them stared at the gorgeous face of Jun Wu Xie with their eyes widened, standing stock still.

“Jun’s little lass... Why are you here?” It took quite a while for Long Jiu to finally collect his wits. He had somewhat gotten on with Jun Wu Xie for a period of time. He was so surprised to notice the sudden appearance of Jun Wu Xie in the Soul World, and what surprised him even more was that during their first meet with each other, Jun Wu Xie had actually saved him!

“I’m here to settle the chaotic energy in my body, you guys... What’s happening here?” Jun Wu Xie slightly furrowed her brows. She didn’t expect to meet Long Jiu again in such a situation.

Talking about this, the smile that had just emerged from Long Jiu’s face faded away immediately. With his eyebrows knitted into a deep frown, he clenched his fists.

“It’s already too late by the time Old Five and I came back...”

The time when Long Jiu and Qin Song were told about the news, they then hurriedly returned to the Soul World, but when they arrived at the Soul World, the Soul World had already lost its original frame. The spirit envoys who had gotten the thoughts of betrayal aroused in their minds had already taken the entire Soul World under their control, even the Spirit Tree had been taken charge by them.

Long Jiu and the others were planning to revolt at the beginning, but their opponents were well-prepared, causing them to be caught on the wrong foot. Not only did they imprison Long Jiu and Qin Song, they had also dominated the entire Soul World without even having the need to disguise themselves.

These soul entities who had been caught together with Long Jiu today were all loyal to the Spirit Tree. It was because they were unwilling to give in that had caused them to end up in such a sticky circumstances.

Long Jiu and the rest of them were on their way to the prison just now. After realizing the chaos in the Soul World, Long Jiu and Qin Song had decided to move separately in order to search for the opportunity to snatch a victory out of defeat. But not long ago, Long Jiu had received the news of Qin Song getting caught by their enemies, and he himself too, was arrested by the traitors today.

At first, he had already lost his hope but to his surprise, things had actually taken a fortunate turn, which was letting him meet Jun Wu Xie!

Long Jiu’s words had caused Jun Wu Xie to slightly frown her brows. She had no idea that all the concerns and worries she previously made would actually turn into reality.

“Jun’s little lass, if it’s in the past, I’ll definitely bring you to the Spirit Tree when you visit the Soul World, but now...” Long Jiu let out a forced smile, “We can’t even go near the Spirit Tree. Just as you’ve seen, we, the spirit envoys, had become the convicts. The entire Soul World had already fallen into those traitors’ hands.”

It wasn’t that Long Jiu and the rest of them were unwilling to fight for rebellion, it was because the Spirit Tree had been controlled by those traitors, and they had threatened them using the Spirit Tree, that if Long Jiu them had the nerves to revolt, they would then do something to the Spirit Tree.

Even though those faithful spirit envoys knew that it was just an excuse made by their foes to coerce them, they still didn’t dare to conduct any reckless actions.

To them, the Spirit Tree was just like their parents, their faiths. Even if they were going to get their souls ripped apart, they would still refuse to let the Spirit Tree get hurt, not even a bit.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. The situation of the Soul World was worse than what she had imagined. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“So far, how many spirit envoys have betrayed the Spirit Tree?” asked Jun Wu Xie.

Long Jiu frowned, “Almost half of them.”

Jun Wu Xie slightly widened her eyes. That time when the Situ guy mentioned about this, the amount of the betrayers was far behind the exact amount, it turned out that he too, didn’t know about the full picture of the plan.

“If there weren’t so many of them, how is it possible for them to control the entire Soul World? After all, we’re the one to be blamed, thinking that no one will betray the Spirit Tree, but who knows...” Angrily, Long Jiu clenched his fists tightly.
