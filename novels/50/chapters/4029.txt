Time seemed to have stopped at this moment as Jun Wu Xie stared unblinkingly at the man who was a few steps away, her brows wrinkled together. If not for the sounds of battle raging on, Jun Wu Xie would have thought she entered the realm of fantasy.

The slender and tall figure stood alone in the scuffle, and the wind blew his black hair. The delicately handsome features were perfect, like a carved jade statue, quiet and elegant.

Jun Wu Xie just stood at the same spot, staring at Jun Gu who stood not far away. Her doubts and incomprehension crashed around like huge waves.

Jun Gu thought that Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie would attack again, and readied himself for a two prong attack. But the two of them just stood rooted in their spot watching him with eyes wide in shock.

Jun Gu’s interest was piqued, “What? Why are you looking at me like that? In the battle, it’s not wise to reveal such a void.”

If he wanted to, he could take a shot at them as they stood stunned. But Jun Gu didn’t like to take advantage of such situations.

“Ye Jue, I respect you for you are the strongest of the generation. Even though we are enemies, I won’t take advantage of you. But... have you stared at me enough? Is my face better looking than the girl next to you?” Jun Gu tinned his chin. If it wasn’t that the venue was incorrect, he would have laughed. These two fellows ought to be fighting properly but instead were just staring hard at him.

Jun Wu Xie regained some presence of mind but found that Jun Gu had only cast a quick glance to her face, as he focused more on Jun Wu Yao. Her heart unconsciously clenched, even for a person as smart as her, she didn’t know what exactly was this person in front of her.

Why...

Why did he look exactly the same as her father?

Jun Wu Xie subconsciously clutched her chest; the body of Jun Gu was still preserved in the Lin Palace, and that lifelike appearance was like being caught in an endless sleep. Jun Wu Xie had seen it countless times and long memorised Jun Gu’s appearance. The face in her memory was duplicated onto this person in front of her.

Even though there were people who looked similar, she didn’t know that two people could be this identical.

What made Jun Wu Xie even more uneasy was what the Spirit Tree had said...

The Spirit Tree said that her father was on the Soul Ascending Altar!

And now, she was only a short distance from the Soul Ascending Altar but she didn’t expect to meet a person who looked exactly the same as Jun Gu.

Doubt and shock were swimming in Jun Wu Xie’s mind. She was eager to clarify her doubts. Her nervousness was detected by Jun Wu Yao due to the stiffness in her body.

Jun Wu Yao squinted his eyes as he looked at the man in front of him. He had seen Jun Gu’s body many times as he wanted to help Jun Xu Xie find her father as soon as possible, and because of that, the moment he saw the other party, he stiffened momentarily

Jun Wu Yao took a deep breath, this person recognized him, and from the tone of his voice, he should be from the Upper Realm. However, Jun Wu Yao had no memory of him. This person’s strength was stronger than Luo Qingcheng. Logically speaking, it was impossible for Jun Wu Yao to not know him.

“Who are you?”

The gentleman paused a moment and suddenly laughed softly as he bowed elegantly and said: “I am Jun Gu.”
