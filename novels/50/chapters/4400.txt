Chapter 2996 A Shocking News 2

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao looked closely at the little row of words.

But.....

Once she read it, she froze to the spot and all the colour drained from her face!

On the ground, it was messily written....

[Little Xie, don’t touch the puppets.]

Jun Wu Xie stood there dumbfounded, those first few words hit her like a bolt of lightning.

The only ones ever to address her as “Little Xie” in the whole world were Qiao Chu and the rest of her companions. It was worth noting that on that day, she was appearing as Yan Hai so even if the puppet recognised Yan Hai, there was no way it knew her true identity.

Recalling the process where Su Ruiying had turned Bai Zhu into a puppet, Jun Wu Xie stared wordlessly at the puppet. With her heart pounding and lips trembling, she stared at the puppet and softly uttered the words that felt like they would tear her heart out as they left her mouth...

“Little Ruo?”

The broken puppet on the ground went stiff for a moment, then very very gently, nodded its head.

Jun Wu Xie was like a statue, even if she already had guessed it, this was still hard to believe.

Little Ruo.....

Little Ruo.....

She was alive!!

She was really alive!!

Jun Wu Xie’s heart was immediately filled with great joy and in that instant, she did not care about anything else. No matter what danger she was in or what enemies she had to face, she could not hide her joy.

“Little Ruo, it really is you...” Jun Wu Xie reached out and cradled the broken puppet in her hand as if it was a rare treasure.

She finally understood why she found that puppet so familiar. It was because her soul was unchanged and as long as one’s soul was unchanged, one’s eyes also did not change.

The broken puppet laid weakly in Jun Wu Xie’s hand. Although it looked weak, it was looking at Jun Wu Xie with a gentle expression just like in the beginning.

Even though Jun Wu Yao could not immediately understand what was going on, he quickly gained his wits and said to Jun Wu XIe quietly, “This is not the place for conversation, let’s go.”

Jun Wu Xie gave a deep sigh, suppressing the joy she felt as she nodded her head. She carefully placed the puppet in her palm as if she was transporting the most precious jewel in the world, afraid that even her own actions might damage it.

Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie returned to their room under the cover of darkness and immediately closed the door. Jun Wu Xie swept everything on the table onto the floor and gently placed the puppet on the table.

Inside the room, with the aid of candlelight, Jun Wu Xie was able to see how much damage the puppet had sustained. There were cracks and burn marks all over its body and its face had been cut by a knife. Jun Wu Xie felt like all the damage had been carved onto her own heart.

The Little Ruo that they had lost but had now found again

For Jun Wu Xie to be able to see Rong Ruo again after she had thought that Rong Ruo detonated her own Ring Spirit in order to fend off Fan Jinghe, brought her indescribable joy and excitement.
