Chapter 2779: Gu Ying’s thoughts (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“I sincerely thank you, Highness Ying! With the help of Highness Ying and Lord Duan, prevailing over Sea Spirit City is definite.” Bai Zhu stood up in excitement and bowed in gratitude towards Gu Ying.

Gu Ying waved his hand and did not care at all for the gratitude from Bai Zhu.

Gu Ying and Bai Zhu talked for a while more before Bai Zhu diligently sent Gu Ying out.

Although Duan Qi’s strength was powerful, what Bai Zhu really cared about was the Sacred Maiden Tribe behind Duan Qi! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The status of the Sacred Maiden Tribe in the Upper Realm was very special. They were born with a very strong psychic force. This psychic force may not be strong enough, but it’s very useful during a battle. It could control a person’s actions and minds with a strong mental force within a short time. Although the time was short, it was enough to kill the opponent in a blink of an eye.

At this moment, Bai Zhu’s thoughts started to move. What he wanted was not just as simple as Duan Qi’s strength!

After Gu Ying left Bai Zhu’s house, he got into the carriage and returned to his residence.

On the carriage, an old man was sitting in the carriage and looking at Gu Ying with a smile on his face.

“Highness Ying seems to have encountered something good? You seem to be in a good mood.” said the old man.

Gu Ying chuckled a little: “Bai Zhu is a smart man. He has great ambition. I recommended Duan Qi to him. I think he will contribute more than what I’ve given him. ”

“Oh? Highness Ying, are you really recommending Lady Duan to Bai Zhu? Although Bai Zhu is young, he has a lot of thoughts in his mind. I heard the news from Sea Spirit City when Bai Zhu was at the side of Sea Spirit City, he was very oblige and obedient towards its City Lord. After leaving Sea Spirit City, he and Nangong Yan joined forces to deal with Sea Spirit City. He changes sides fast. If Highness Ying joins him, you need to be careful.” The old man said in reminder.

“Be careful? What can I be careful of? His opponent is Yan Hai, not me. Though he can survive the storm, I can still defeat him.” Gu Ying smiled disapprovingly.

The old man said nothing more. He was sent by the Lord to Gu Ying’s side. Ever since he followed Gu Ying, he only obeyed and listened to his orders even if the Lord no longer needed to order him around.

During this time, he had been following Gu Ying closely and did not avoid him.

But the more he looked at it, the more he thought Gu Ying was planning the next big game.

He kept in touch with the experts of the Upper Realm without expressing his attitude. 72 cities were about to fall into the flames of war when Gu Ying suddenly stepped in. He seemed to be helping Bai Zhu. But in fact, it created more chaos among the 72 cities.

And once Duan Qi takes the shot, the City Lords would be dragged into the whole battle. The spread of this war was definitely not a good sign.

What does Gu Ying want to do? The old man couldn’t figure it out, but could vaguely feel that Gu Ying seemed to deliberately want to disturb the Upper Realm that had been peaceful for years.

“It’s windy, the good show should be staged soon, we don’t need to think too much. Let’s just watch the show.” Gu Ying said with a smile as he turned to look at the scenery outside the window.
