The moment this thought entered the Spirit Lord’s mind, he felt chills running through his entire being. That type of medicinal pill was something that the Soul World would never allow to be passed out. Only after going through thorough discussions with Jun Xian and having countless measures in place did he dare to allow the people of the Lower Realm to use it. To have the privilege of taking it, a person had to go through a thorough inspection and be approved by a special personnel. Even when administering it, the person needed to be blindfolded and the person administering it must ensure that it had been completely consumed and the person taking it had no means to even touch it at will. The Spirit Lord had no choice but to ensure that it was controlled under such strict measures.

If someone else had access to such a phenomenal medicinal pill, let’s not mention the Spirit World, that person would even be able to access the Soul World easily at will ...

Just the thought of this alone.... the Spirit Lord no longer dared to even continue this train of thought...

Jun Wu Xie remained calm and replied, “This is just my own conjuncture.”

“If you hadn’t noticed anything, would you even have such a thought? Tell me, what did you discover?” The Spirit Lord did not believe that these were mere speculations on her part. He had some understanding of her character and she for one, was never a person who would have such baseless conjunctures out of the blue. ( .c om )

She raised her cold gaze and it met with the Spirit Lord’s anxious gaze.

“I have my suspicions and would need your cooperation.” She said it in a matter-of-factly tone.

“Just say it!” He agreed without second thoughts, no matter what she suspected, he had a feeling that things were not as simple as he had imagined.

Jun Wu Xie waved her hand to beckon him closer and whispered to him.

......

On the other side, Qin Song, Long Jiu and Situ Heng left the Spirit Palace. The Spirit Lord has especially arranged a comfortable place for them to stay in. They lived next to each other and along the way back, Long Jiu’s mouth did not shut once.

“I really didn’t think...that the Spirit Lord was so capable. Before all of this started, I was still curious about why we had to take a break after each round. Now I completely understand it and judging by the way things are going, I reckon we’d need another six days. If we had done all ten rounds at one go, I am afraid that we can’t stand it at all.” Long Jiu sighed deeply. He didn’t think that he had such a big gap with Qin Song, but after this, he immediately understood that his current strength was insufficient.

“This is only the first round, the Spirit Lord is afraid that we will make mistakes in the middle which is why he wanted us to stay and watch the entire process from start to finish. From the next round on, we only need to go when it’s our turn.” Qin Song chuckled, feeling amused from Long Jiu’s reaction.

From the looks of things, assisting with this wasn’t particularly difficult apart from the large consumption of soul power.

“I hope this method can be useful for the little lass.” Long Jiu smiled and said.

( .c om ) Situ Heng who was walking by the side remained silent the entire time. When he arrived at the residence, he entered the room without saying a word. Instead, he caused Long Jiu to be even more baffled. When Long Jiu saw Situ Heng shut the door without saying a word, he scratched his head and said. “I really don’t understand Situ even more now. At first, I thought that he didn’t like the little lass, so he was always cold and unfeeling. But this time round, Situ really changed my opinion of him. I really didn’t expect him to be willing to help, although that character of his... isn’t all that likeable, but... I decided that I will find less fault with him in the future.”

Qin Song simply smiled and stared at Situ Heng’s door, not knowing what was on his mind.

In the room, the moment when Situ Heng closed the door, no longer was there the usually expressionless face but instead, it had changed into one that was filled with malice!

He sat down on the chair and the malevolence he exuded was terrifying.

“I was too careless! I didn’t expect that the revenge target of that obnoxious girl turned out to be the Upper Realm! Hmph! She really is a crafty little bitch, she never revealed a word about it before.”
