“Oh? How did he kill him?”

“Erm... We’re not sure about this.” Both of them replied honestly.

Since Xu Zu knew that these people had a very low status, and that it wasn’t possible for them to know about the details, he didn’t really tangle in the question, what he actually cared about was that... Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Recently, the Sea Spirit City has terminated the provision of the Sea Spirit Beast for the other cities, is it that there are some problems in hunting for the Sea Spirit Beasts?” asked Xu Zu.

“I have never heard anything about that?”

“I don’t think so? I’d just seen the ships which the City Lord dispatched brought quite an amount of the carsasses of the Sea Spirit Beast back half a month ago.”

“Yeah! I went to help at the harbour that time.”

Both the two people spoke one after another, saying that they didn’t find anything suspicious about the matter at all.

Xu Zu had asked a lot of questions after that, but he didn’t get any useful information. Both the two people would answer any questions he asked as all they wanted was to take the money, but neither of their answers were the outcomes he wanted.

Xu Zu got frustrated as he listened to their narratives. After waving his hand, gesturing them to leave, he then called another two residents of the Sea Spirit City and asked them similar questions. All these people came from different places in the Sea Spirit City. Xu Zu was quite smart. Worrying that there might be spy attaching himself or herself into the group of people they found, the people he found were all from different places in the Sea Spirit City. However, after finished questioning all of them, the answers they gave were surprisingly similar.

At first, Xu Zu was slightly doubtful about it, but after questioning the tenth person and he still couldn’t find anything weird, only then he began to believe it.

However, when he was questioning the last two people, Xu Zu got some interesting answers.

“You are saying that, those Sea Spirit Beasts that were brought back by the ships had been sent to the other place?” Finally, Xu Zu got to buck himself up.

“Yes. During the previous time, the Sea Spirit Beasts would usually be sent to the workshop and the workers in the workshop would be the one to handle them, but ever since the succession of the new City Lord, the workshop has been closed and all the Sea Spirit Beasts are sent to the other place. We’re not sure exactly where those carcasses are sent to, but recently, we seldom see the Sea Spirit Beasts in the city,” said a man in fear.

Suddenly, the other man who was standing beside him said, “Lord! I know it! I’ve helped to ship those Sea Spirit Beasts before. Seems like those carcasses have been sent to a newly built workshop, but the workshop is strictly guarded, there’s no way for me to get into it. I can only watch from the outside, but... although I’ve shipped quite a lot of Sea Spirit Beasts to the workshop, I’ve never seen them bring any resources of the Sea Spirit Beast out from the workshop, it’s just that... just that...”

“Just what?” Vaguely feeling that he had found the main key, Xu Zu couldn’t help but straightened his back.

“It’s just that quite a lot of boxes that are filled with medicine pills have been carried out from the workshop. I didn’t get to take a close look at what kind of pill it is. The only thing I know is that these pills have all been given to the close confidantes of the new City Lord.” That person said honestly.

“Medicine pills? A new workshop... Close subordinates...” Xu Zu pondered the relations between the three factors, vaguely feeling that there must be something big hidden behind this.

He still wanted to ask further about it, but both the two of them had already gotten all the information they knew out, and he could only let them receive the money and leave.

“You guys think of a way to bring me a soldier of the Sea Spirit City. It’ll be the best to find the close confidante of Yan Hai,” Xu Zu immediately placed his order to his subordinates.

He could only choose to fork it out if he wanted to find out what was Jun Wu Xie actually doing under the surface.

It wasn’t as easy as dealing with the civilians when bribing the soldiers of the city. However, there was this one thing where the Sea Spirit City couldn’t be matched to the Long Xuan City, which was the status it had among the seventy-two cities. Xu Zu straight off asked his people to bribe the soldier of the Sea Spirit City by promising the soldier that they would let him emigrate to the Long Xuan City, and this was way more effective than using the money as the chip of bargain.
