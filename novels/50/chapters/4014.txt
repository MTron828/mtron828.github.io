Jun Wu Yao suddenly tightened his hand on her shoulder.

Even if there was such a day, he would not do that.

Because in this world, there were so many loved ones and friends cherished by the little fellow, even if he was under the illusion, he would not destroy the world; the world she once existed in, he would continue to guard it for her. The people she cared about, the land that she cared about. As long as the world still existed, there would always be traces of her.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t know what Jun Wu Yao was thinking, she just vaguely noticed that Jun Wu Yao’s mood fluctuated a little but eventually fell into peace.

The Spirit Tree was quiet for a long time it was unknown if it had comprehend or not. It turned around and looked at Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao. It nodded slightly, and that androgynous face was beautiful made people felt that they shouldn’t sin by speaking loudly.

Meng Qiu’s obsession with the Spirit Tree was not without reason. How many people could resist falling in love with such a gentle and perfect soul, especially if they accompanied it day and night?

Jun Wu Xie didn’t know why but she suddenly thought of the Spirit Lord.

Why did the Spirit Lord suddenly chose to leave the Soul World? And why wasn’t he willing to return to his homeland?

Like Meng Qiu, the Spirit Lord was once part of the first batch of Spirit Envoys in the Soul World, and was one of the well-used Spirit Envoys by the Spirit Tree. However, he chose to leave the Soul World, left the Spirit Tree, and even abandoned the name given by the Spirit Tree. He thus named himself Spirit Lord.

Did this mean that the departure of the Spirit Lord that year was also due to the precipitation of the obsession in which his heart should not possess?

Only, it was different from how Meng Qiu chose to handle it. The Spirit Lord knew the danger of this obsession, so he chose to leave and draw a line between himself and the Spirit Tree.

However, all of this was just Jun Wu Xie’s speculation. Whether it was true or not, no one knew.

“Sorry that you have to witness all these.” The Spirit Tree sighed softly. This time, if it wasn’t for Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao, no one would be able to stop Meng Qiu from doing what he wanted.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

Jun Wu Yao suddenly said: “I feel that I have misread you before.”

The Spirit Tree was a little shocked.

“Why do you say that?”

“I wasn’t aware you can assume human form.” Jun Wu Yao raised his eyebrows. His contact with the Spirit Tree was transmitted through those vines. It was also his first time seeing Spirit Tree materialise.

The Spirit Tree looked down at its own appearance and said with a helpless smile: “The body is just a passing cloud. I turned into this shape because you are used to the appearance of humans. I myself prefer my original image. Also, I can assume this form because when I was sealed, I could not nurture any spirit lives. If it was before, when I am nurturing these spirit lives, I won’t dare to leave my body.”

“Oh? Since this is the case, there is one thing I want to ask you.” Jun Wu Yao continued.

“Please go ahead.” The Spirit Tree was extremely polite.

Jun Wu Yao’s eyes slightly perked up as he looked at the delicate face of the Spirit Tree, his voice suddenly cooled.

“That time, you attracted my attention with the Spirit Tree seed and allowed me to take it away without much trouble. Was it because you have already noticed that Meng Qiu had bad intentions?”

Jun Wu Yao finished his question which shocked Qin Song and Long Jiu.
