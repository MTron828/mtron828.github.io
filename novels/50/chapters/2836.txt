“Really?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Han Shu lightly, but her eyes discretely glanced at Jun Wu Yao who was beside her.

“That’s natural. Han Shu is willing to take City Lord Yan there, as long as City Lord Yan agrees.” Han Shu bowed her head, as she pretended to be bashful. But in that moment that she lowered her head, she missed the hint of killing intent that shone from someone’s eyes. That someone who was sitting beside Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie looked on calmly at Han Shu’s poor performance. While Han Shu bowed her head, Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and lightly pressed on the back of Jun Wu Yao’s hand.

The killing intent in his eyes was too strong, as long as the person was not a fool; that person would notice it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jun Wu Yao raised his eyebrows slightly. Looking at Jun Wu Xie’s disapproving eyes, he could only restrain the killing intent, however, that killing intent did not disappear but was hidden in his heart.

To fawn over his little guy right in front of him, this Han Shu was tired of living?

“Since Miss Han Shu has good intentions, then I shall not be impolite and refuse. I thank you for your efforts.” Jun Wu Xie said faintly. Actually, she was thinking about how to see Jun Gu before, but she did not think of her method. When he came out, Han Shu brought it to her.

Since Han Shu wanted to make use of her, then there naturally should be an exchange, right?

Han Shu was exuberant by Jun Wu Xie’s response that she immediately blushed. She nodded again and again, as this joy did not come from the intentions of a lady but the chase for ambition.

Thus, with Han Shu leading the way, Jun Wue Xie left her residence.

At the peak of the Holy Mountain, Elder Duan and the other tribe elders were in the square, welcoming Jun Gu. Even the normally stiff-faced Elder Duan left out a rare smile upon seeing Jun Gu, and respectfully welcomed him.

“Lord Jun Gu’s presence brings light to our Sacred Maiden Tribe’s dwelling. arrival came and led my maidens to prosperous and glorious. Lord Jun Gu must be travel-worn from this long journey.” Duan Qi rarely showed humility.

Although the Sacred Maiden Tribe held a high status, even the top ten exponents had to pay them much respect and courtesy, it did not include the Knights of Destruction.

The Knights of Destruction belonged to the Lord, and he placed a lot of importance on them as they were an important source of power for him. No one could disrespect them. In addition to that, after Han Zi Fei is married to one of them, the Sacred Maiden Tribe would have the most pureblood descendents. How could Duan Qi not lower her attitude?

“Elder Duan is being modest.” Jun Gu smiled freely and elegantly and it made his handsome appearance even more noticeable.

However, such a beautiful smile was actually an eye-sore to Yan Xi, who was standing to the side, her eyes held a trace of unhappiness as her glance swept past Elder Duan and others.

Duan Qi noticed Yan Xi’s strange behaviour, and while she remained calm on the surface, she took offence to her behaviour.

“Lord Jun Gu should rest for a while. We have prepared a welcome banquet for you, Lord Jun Gu. Once Lord Jun Gu is well rested, we can enjoy the banquet.” Duan Qi smiled as she said this.

Jun Gu was in a good mood, and naturally nodded in agreement.

Duan Qi immediately ordered her people to escort Jun Gu to his residence, and using the excuse that she hadn’t seen Yan Xi in a long while, made Yan Xi remain in the square with her.

After Jun Gu left, the welcoming party dispersed, leaving Duan Qi and Ya Xi standing on the square.

The smile on Duan Qi’s face faded in an instant, she frowned slightly as she looked at Yan Xi, and asked “Yan Xi, what are you unhappy about?”

Yan Xi froze slightly, lowering her eyes and dared not to speak.
