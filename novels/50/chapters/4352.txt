Time passed by swiftly and Jun Wu Xie finally stopped. Most of the injuries on Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo’s bodies had been dealt with. Their lives were no longer in danger as Jun Wu Xie’s hands finally stopped. Turning her head, her eyes fell on the figure who was seated three steps away. A man whose entire face was covered in bandages.

The bandage on the man’s face had little spots of blood seeping through and it was clear that the injuries on his face were not light. Jun Wu Xie could only recognize who it was from his silhouette.

Fei Yan....

Jun Wu Xie’s heart tightened. She stepped forward immediately as she raised her hands and wanted to remove the bandage.

But just when Jun Wu Xie’s hand had just tugged the end of the bandage, Fei Yan who was sitting there all the time in a daze, suddenly reached out and grabbed Jun Wu Xie’s wrist!

That dirty hand was holding onto her tightly, as if holding on to his last life-saving straw.

“Little ... Little Ruo ... gone ... She’s gone ...” The painful and depressed voice came out of Fei Yan’s mouth, and with that trembling voice, a large amount of blood seeped out of his mouth but his heart hurt even more.

“Little Xie, please ... find Little Ruo ...” That desperate cry was almost inaudible, but it was smothering and filled with anguish.

Fei Yan’s hand clutched on to Jun Wu Xie’s wrist so tightly and had completely disregarded himself as he used all his strength till the wounds on his hand had split.

The warm blood ran down his palm.

Drip drip ...

Blood started to trickle onto the floor.

A startling crimson red that was so vivid that it shook people’s hearts.

When Jun Wu Xie entered the house, she already noticed that her companions were in the room. Only Rong Ruo was missing. That gentle and caring person who always cared for everyone had now disappeared inadvertently.

“What... What happened?” Jun Wu Xie wanted to ask but when her voice came out, she felt a suffocating throbbing in her chest, accompanied by a pain so intense that one could pass out with that pain.

Fei Yan shook his head, and his stifling cry made the atmosphere in the room even more bleak.

Qiao Chu shook his fist and lowered his head. His eyes were so red that it seemed that he might even shed tears of blood.

Nangong Lie took a deep breath, he understood that under such circumstances, Qiao Chu and the rest could not say anything at all. Every time they recalled, they had to face the death of their companions again.

“It was the Top Ten Experts, I have no idea why they suddenly attacked your people today ...”

Nangong Lie told everything that happened today.

Nangong Lie and Jun Wu Xie have a good relationship. It was no secret in the Upper Realm. In addition, he was not close to other people in the Top Ten Experts. He rarely paid attention to other people’s movements. Today he was planning to go look for Jun Wu Xie but when he entered the inn where Jun Wu Xie was, he saw the pale Bai Mo carrying Fan Zhuo who had fallen into a coma and had jumped out from the back window of the restaurant.

At that time, Fan Zhuo had fallen into a coma, and Bai Mo had a lot of injuries on his body. Nangong Lie could only quickly take them away and bring them somewhere safe. It was here that Nangong Lie learned everything from Bai Mo about what had happened in the inn.

Not long after Jun Wu Xie left, Bai Mo had been resting well in the room. But he did not expect that he was suddenly attacked and the killer turned out to be one of the Top Ten Experts!
