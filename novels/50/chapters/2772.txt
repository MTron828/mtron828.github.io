Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Don’t be surprised, Lord Yan. His Highness has always acted as he pleases.” Gu Xin Yan’s face contained no expression as she woodenly answered.

“I wonder, apart from the congratulatory gifts, if His Highness has a message to be conveyed to me.” Although Jun Wu Xie was curious, the look in her eyes was extremely sharp.

Gu Xin Yan thought about it, but finally shook her head.

“Not at all.”

“That’s fine, Miss Gu, if you are not in a rush to return, you can always stay in Sea Spirit City for a few days after the Banquet of Heroes. This place is close to the Sea of Death and has wonderful scenery.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Gu Xin Yan glanced behind her, at the two guards, but finally shook her head with a bitter smile.

“No need. I just came to present the congratulatory gift. Since the gift has been delivered, after the Banquet of Heroes, I think I will go back.”

“Then I won’t keep you.”

Jun Wu Xie and Gu Xin Yan spoke for a little while more. Gu Xin Yan was distracted throughout their conversation. After Jun Wu Xie obtained the answers she wanted, they went their separate ways.

After Gu Xin Yan left, Qiao Chu rushed out and asked impatiently.

“How was it?”

“Why do I feel like Little Xie didn’t ask anything at all?” Qiao Chu scratched his head. He had hidden in the shadows for a long time but he didn’t hear anything of substance from the conversation between Jun Wu Xie and Gu Xin Yan.

“It should be him.” Jun Wu Xie said abruptly, the gentle smile, that graced her face when Gu Xin Yan was here,had faded away long ago.

“Ah? How did you ... find out?” Qiao Chu was a little dumbfounded. Did he miss any important information?

“I can tell.” Jun Wu Xie said lightly.

“Ah?” Qiao Chu was even more confused.

Jun Wu Xie saw the doubtful looks on all her friends’ faces and explained in a not too fast, but not too slow manner, “Gu Xin Yan’s strength is not enough to simply appear in the Upper Realm. Without the protection of those two people behind her, it is difficult for her to make progress in the Upper Realm. However, while those two seem to be protecting her, they are also monitoring her. Besides Gu Ying, I don’t think anyone would pay that much attention to a girl from the Middle Realm.”

Some things did not require physical evidence, they could be calculated based on details and logic alone.

Qiao Chu listened to Jun Wu Xie’s explanation but he still looked like he barely understood anything. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

But there was one thing he could be sure of.

“This Highness Ying is really Gu Ying huh? Is this kid a magical cat demon with nine lives? What a life he has... and with this identity.. Getting more intrepid and dauntless.”

First, he was the Blood Fiend Palace’s Young Lord, then he was the Nine Temples’ Young Lord, and then now... He even managed to wrangle such a strong patron in His Lord in the Upper Realm?!!

Qiao Chu really respected the tenacity and dauntless nature of this Gu Ying.

“Gu Ying is not the son of Gu Yi, no one could find out who his biological father was. Now that I think about it, with the strength of the Nine Temples in Middle Realm, no one from the Twelve Palaces could compete against. It was even more difficult to get access to Gu Ying’s mother. However, the Lord of the Nine Temples came from Upper Realm, so if we say that Gu Ying’s father is a person from the Upper Realm, it is not unrealistic. However, I didn’t think it was that person.” Rong Ruo rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she spoke. Since Gu Ying had popped up in the Upper Realm, Jun Wu Xie must be really careful in whatever future actions she would take, afterall, Gu Ying and Jun Wu Xie were old foes.
