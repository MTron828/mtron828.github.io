Jun Wu Xie returned to her room. With the hot water that had already been prepared, she stripped off her blood soaked clothes and stepped into the bathtub. Every cell in her body was warmed up by the water and her tension floated away.

Those tightly held nerves for the past five years could finally be unwound at that moment. Jun Wu Xie had a calm gaze as she stared at the surface of the water, the side of her face reflected on that surface.

Everything felt like it was back five years ago, before those horrific things ever happened. She no longer had to be worried about how to deal with Luo Qincheng, she didn’t need to be worried about the speed of her growth or that if she was too slow, she would have missed the window of opportunity to rescue Jun Wu Yao.

Staring at her reflection on the water’s surface, Jun Wu Xie’s lips could not help but tilt upwards into a slight smile.

This feeling... is good.

In the hall, Jun Wu Yao sat together with Jun Xian. Qiao Chu and others, who were late, tampered down their laughing faces and sat down earnestly to one side, as they looked on at Jun Wu Yao with eager eyes.

It had been five years, but there wasn’t much changes with Brother Wu Yao. They were pleased at this.

“Welcome back. There are somethings I’d like to ask you.” Jun Xian told Jun Wu Yao suddenly.

“Please go ahead.” Jun Wu Yao replied. The moment he spoke, Ye Sha, Ye Mei and Ye Gu also walked in and in unison, stood by behind Jun Wu Yao.

“That incident that happened years ago, we were not present. But after it happened, we heard many things from the Spirit Jade Palace Lord, including that you were prepared to sacrifice yourself to protect Little Xie. I am very gratified to know that. Did you foresee the results from the beginning?” Jun Xian asked as he stared unblinkingly at Jun Wu Yao. He knew clearly Jun Wu Yao’s intentions towards Jun Wu Xie, he understood it very well. If not, regardless of how powerful Jun Wu Yao was, Jun Xian would not let him close to Jun Wu Xie.

It was just that, after Jun Wu Yao was captured, the coordination of the Night Regime and Lower Realm was almost perfect. And that raised Jun Xian’s suspicions such that he wondered if Jun Wu Yao had previously foresaw what would happen, and actually stored this trick up his sleeves.

This question was also floating in Qiao Chu and the others’ minds. They had found out from the Ye trio that when the tragedy happened, the Night Regime had already made preparations in secret. But did Jun Wu Yao actually have the foresight to prepare all that?

Jun Wu Yao felt the gazes of all present and said lightly, “It wasn’t that I guessed it, but I just made preparations earlier.”

The Upper Realm had always treated him as a blood sacrifice, no matter where he escaped to, as long as they did not give up on the plan for blood sacrifice of the Three Realms, they were never have let him go. He never liked to wait and see, so naturally, he laid down some gambling chips for his counterattack.

It should have been he who launched his counterattack, but because he was caught by Su Ya, everything was brought forward in action.

Countless of times, he had thought that he should distance himself from Jun Wu Xie as he was afraid that she would be in danger. But he could not go against the dire need to be close to her.

Although Jun Wu Yao did not fully express himself, but everyone present knew what he meant.

Jun Xian let out a sigh, if only Jun Wu Yao had more time to prepare, then what had happened would not have come to pass. Because he had wanted to protect Jun Wu Xie, he had no choice but to sacrifice himself and left Jun Wu Xie to finish all the tasks.

This was a decision that he had to make. To finish the tasks himself meant that he was sending Jun Wu Xie to her death. Between those two choices, he chose to protect Jun Wu Xie.
