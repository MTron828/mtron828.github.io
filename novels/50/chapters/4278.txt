“Lord Yan, I’m really sorry.” Duan Qi said in embarrassment.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head and did not seem to further pursue the matter.

Han Shu also wanted to say something. But she was stared by Duan Qi. She could only watch Yan Xi’s provocative eyes and clench her teeth. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This ... regarding Yan Xi, we really can’t make the decision, and ... if Lord Yan really wants to go to Lord Jun Gu, it’s not appropriate at this moment, after all, Lord Jun Gu is accompanying his maiden right now...” Duan Qi’s words were not finished.

Two figures suddenly appeared at the entrance of the hall.

“This banquet is so strange today. On such a good occasion, why are you all frowning? Can’t bear to marry me off?” Han Zi Fei’s voice echoed like thunder in the ears of Duan Qi and others.

Duan Qi quickly turned around and saw that Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu walked into the banquet side by side. Han Zi Fei’s smiley eyes swept around in the hall.

Duan Qi was already annoying enough. But it turned out that these two actually came here to have fun. And for a while they didn’t know what to do.

“Huh? What’s the matter? Han Shu, you looked fierce enough to kill someone?” Han Zi Fei glanced at the face of Han Shu, and said kindly.

Han Shu gave a fierce glance at Han Zi fei and did not dare to speak.

It was Han Zi Fei’s gaze that turned towards Yan Xi, who was hiding behind Jun Wu Xie. Her eyebrows raised slightly.

In the good show arranged by their own daughter, they were not able to watch the whole show. But they got Jun Wu Xie’s words when they parted. Now that they arrived at this hour, Han Zi Fei didn’t know what Jun Wu Xie wanted to do. However, looking at Han Shu who was jealous, and the poor half-faced Yan Xi hiding behind Jun Wu Xie. What else did Han Zi Fei not understand?

Suddenly, Han Zi Fei’s behavior towards her own daughter was clear. She couldn’t help looking at Jun Wu Xie’s disguise and kept laughing.

With one hand, instigating alienation, this was really brilliant.

No wonder Jun Wu Xie said that she would handle Yan Xi. Now that she had already set up a trap, and she was waiting for Yan Xi to drill in.

Watching the incident, she needed to help her own daughter. Han Zi Fei looked at Yan Xi in surprise and said, “Oh, what’s the matter? How can a beautiful woman like this be treated? This slap mark... The fiery five-fingerprints look so distressing. ”

The atmosphere in the hall became strange after what Han Zi Fei had said. Duan Qi’s face turned even more ugly.

However, Han Zi Fei didn’t intend to stop here. She turned to look at the mute Jun Gu like she had found something and said, “Husband, look, this little beauty who was beaten was your servant previously right? I remember ... Is she called Yan Xi? She seemed to have come from our Sacred Maiden Tribe. ”

Jun Gu got the hint of his beautiful wife, and immediately looked at Yan Xi in cooperation, frowning lightly: “Yan Xi, what’s wrong with your face?”

Previously Yan Xi was fighting with Han Shu, she deliberately offered good wishes to Jun Wu Xie. Now that she saw Jun Gu, her heart flew back to him again. Yan Xi was already crying when Jun Gu inquired about her. She couldn’t say anything about her grievances and she was already crying.
