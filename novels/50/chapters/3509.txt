Jun Wu Xie and the companions immediately took a step back as they saw a magnificent eagle Beast Spirit crashing onto the ground before their feet.

Jun Wu Xie immediately recognized the eagle at a glance, as one of the Beast Spirits who escorted Flame Dragon and the others to go see the Spirit Lord!

But at that moment, the eagle before their eyes was far from being as majestic and valiant looking as the one they had seen that morning. Wounds so deep that its bones could be seen in its wings, the feathers badly battered and tattered. Sparkly dust were dissipating out from those wounds and its body was struggling to maintain its solid state!

It was hard to imagine how it managed to drag that burnt out and depleted body back here in flight.

“Leave! Leave here at once!” The eagle fallen on the ground could not even lift up its head, but it still managed to issue that broken and shattered warning from its mouth.

“What is happening here? Where’s Flame Dragon? Where’s Brownie?” Qiao Chu asked, his eyes wide with shock.

Hua Yao immediately squatted himself down, to smear some medicine he held in his hands upon the eagle’s wounds.

“The Spirit Lord has captured Lord Flame Dragon and the Spiritual Bear. He is on his way here with his soldiers and all of you must leave quickly..... If you don’t leave immediately, it might be too late! !” The eagle struggled to push itself up with its badly battered wings, to give that final warning.

The eagle’s words caused Jun Wu Xie and the companions to stand there frozen in shock, unable to believe what they had just heard.

[Flame Dragon and Brownie have been captured?]

[And it was the Spirit Lord’s doing?]

[The Spirit Lord did not punish Wu Jiu! ?]

[Just what exactly has happened! ?]

The astounding news immediately exploded within the minds of Jun Wu Xie and the companions. The eagle who had been too severely injured could not hold out any longer. It had broken through all its lines of defence and fought with everything it had within to rush back here, to inform Jun Wu Xie and the others to immediately escape from there. Its body scattered and dispersed into bits before the companions’ eyes, disappearing bit by bit, leaving behind only its last words.....

“Just what is going on? Has that Spirit Lord gone mad? Not only has he not punished Wu Jiu, he has captured Flame Dragon and Brownie? What does he really want to do? Could it be that he has grown too old and his brain has been dotty! ?” Qiao Chu was in shock. What was really happening?

Jun Wu Xie’s brows were tightly creased together. Poison Ivy’s suspicions were about to come true!

“Go.” Jun Wu Xie said immediately. It was not the time to stand there in a daze.

Jun Wu Xie did not have the time to move Nalan Shan at all. By the time the eagle brought in the news and in the instant that they were about to move..... Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

A loud explosion suddenly sounded not too far away!

Under the dim sky, a strange glow suddenly revealed itself, and that light was approaching at an extremely fast speed as it flew towards them.

The Beast Spirits that had been standing guards on the rocky mountain suddenly saw a large number of human spirits running towards them ferociously and they immediately took on an offensive stance. But in that instant when that ball of ice blue light flew over their heads, they were all immediately frozen in place.

The Spirit Lord!

It was already too late when Jun Wu Xie and the companions wanted to leave. Even though that ball of light still had not come close, they could already feel an enormous surge of power of the spirit gathering above their heads. They felt as if eyes that they could not see had locked onto them, and they would not be able to escape no matter where they went.

“What do we do Little Xie?” Qiao Chu’s face paled. Though he did not know what was within that ball of light, but that powerful aura had already made him feel an enormously powerful oppression shrouding all around him.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. Poison Ivy then seemed to notice something as he rushed over with a swoosh. When he lifted his head up and saw that ball of ice blue light, his heart immediately fell right down into the bottom of a pit.

“Spirit Lord. That is the Spirit Lord.....”
