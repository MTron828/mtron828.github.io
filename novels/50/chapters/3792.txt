The chilly eyes of Jun Wu Xie landed on Situ Heng without any emotion, making Situ Heng to tremble from the very bottom of his heart.

“Open your mouth,” ordered Jun Wu Xie in a cold voice.

“D... Don’t... kill me...” Situ Heng almost wanted to cry. During the five years of staying in the Evil Region, he wasn’t willing to spare even a glance for Jun Wu Xie, causing him to not realize how actually scary was the woman who was standing in front of him. Until the moment he personally experienced it, he didn’t even have the chance to feel regret for his act.

While looking at Situ Heng who was being struck dumb with terror, the smile on Blood Velvet’s face got brighter. He went forward and grinned at Situ Heng with his head cocked to one side. “Are you dumb? How can I remove my seed from your body if you aren’t going to open your mouth? Or you want it to continue to stay inside your soul?”

Situ Heng stunned a little. He looked skeptically at Blood Velvet and then looked carefully at Jun Wu Xie who was holding on a cold expression on her face. Seeing that there was no response coming from Jun Wu Xie, only then he opened his mouth with uncertainty.

The second Situ Heng opened his mouth, the black cat that was sitting on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder suddenly threw the Soul Devourer on its tail into Situ Heng’s mouth. To Situ Heng’s horror, he tried to spit it out but Blood Velvet rushed towards him and gave a kick on his mouth, forcing him to swallow the Soul Devourer.

“Though it was me the one who say you dumb, you are really dumb. I was just saying for fun and you actually trusted me.” Blood Velvet raised his eyebrows while looking at Situ Heng who was being kicked over on the ground. There wasn’t any guilt found on his smiling face.

Situ Heng glared at Blood Velvet, still trying to get himself up. But at that moment, Blood Velvet activated the seeds inside his soul, once again causing an extreme pain to torment Situ Heng to the point that he would rather die than being alive. All he could do was just to roll on the floor with his body twitching everywhere.

“Such an idiot, how can you not pay for it when you want to kill my Mistress?” The smile of Blood Velvet became more brilliant. From the moment Situ Heng made a move on Jun Wu Xie, his death had already been destined!

“Drag him out,” said Jun Wu Xie coldly. Situ Heng would definitely die since he swallowed the Soul Devourer, whereas the seed of Blood Velvet would let him fully enjoy his very last moment of his life before the Soul Devourer showed its effect.

Nobody in the room felt sorry about the way Situ Heng’s life ended. There was no any other place in this world for a spirit who had betrayed his creator to stay.

Everybody in the room let out a sigh of relief after the Spirit Lord asked his servant to drag Situ Heng out. Even it was just ten, or a little more, minutes, they felt like a long time had been gone.

“Little Xie, you really scared us to death, how mean of you! At least inform us beforehand if you want to settle Situ Heng.” While looking at Jun Wu Xie, Qiao Chu whined. Only Gods would know how worried were them when they saw the “weakening” of the soul of Jun Wu Xie.

Who knew that...

It was just an act played by Jun Wu Xie and the Spirit Lord.

Jun Wu Xie looked apologetically at the whole room of people who were feeling concerned over her.

It was not that she was unwilling to tell them. It was just that it would be better if less people were told about the plan if they wanted to trick Situ Heng into telling his actual intention. If everyone knew about her plan, there was no guarantee that they wouldn’t let the cat out of their bags. Situ Heng was a cautious man. If she missed the opportunity to expose him this time, he would continue to wrap himself in the clothing of the Soul Master of the Soul World, lying to Qin Song and Long Jiu.

Till that moment came, Jun Wu Xie wouldn’t be allowed to punish Situ Heng in front of Qin Song and Long Jiu even when she felt something suspicious about him.
