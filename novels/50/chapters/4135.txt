Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

After taking six cities in a row, Sea Spirit City’s army finally rounded back to their home. Qiao Chu, who fought free of inhibitions along the way, was in such a good mood that he was about to fly. On the way back, Qiao Chu and Fei Yan were each trying to compare who contributed the most to all the battles fought, they almost fought each other to see who was better.

Following two consecutive months of battle, even the steel-like Night Regime couldn’t help but feel a little tired. Fortunately, the duration of these battles were not long. They had spent more time on the road travelling. The battles they were engaged in did not last for more than half a day.

When Jun Wu Xie returned to the Sea Spirit City, Jun Wu Yao stood on the tower,against the wind. The slender figure seemed elongated as its shadow was lengthened under the sun’s rays. As he stood, he seemed independent and incompatible from the world. But those smiling eyes, gazing across the mountains and rivers, were focused on that one vision in his heart.

Before Jun Wu Xie even reached the gates of the city, Jun Wu Yao’s figure had already leapt down from the city wall and drifted to Jun Wu Xie’s side. He immediately carried her down from her horse and strode towards the city with big strides.

Because of his sensitive identity, Jun Wu Yao had never traveled with them.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t want to expose Jun Wu Yao’s identity, she and the Night Regime alone were enough to deal with these people in the 72 cities, just as Jun Wu Xie said before.

These ants were not qualified to engage Jun Wu Yao in a fight.

“A parting of two months, you are cruel.” Jun Wu Yao looked down at Jun Wu Xie, who was in his arms, no matter how powerful Jun Wu Xie was now, in his eyes, she was still the same as before. as usual, even if she was going to fight every single being in the world, he would still willingly stretch out his arms to shield her from the strong winds and rain.

“I just wanted to end things as soon as possible.” Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and touched Jun Wu Yao’s cheek, her pale, soft fingertips touched the slight stubble around his mouth.

In order to find Jun Gu, she needed to capture the attention of the Upper Realm as soon as possible and there was no other way.

“I know.” Jun Wu Yao smiled. How would he not know her intentions?

Qiao Chu and others followed Jun Wu Yao into the city as they watched the sweet scene of Jun Wu Yao holding Jun Wu Xie, these few bachelors felt quite irritated by that public display of affection.

Fei Yan involuntarily glanced at Rong Ruo while she just started straight ahead without squinting, it was unclear if she hadn’t noticed or she just didn’t dared to respond.

Qiao Chu, on the other hand...

“Brother Hua, are you tired? Or shall I carry you into the city?” Qiao Chu looked at Hua Yao with a serious face, and he solemnly stretched out his hands in earnest.

Hua Yao looked at Qiao Chu speechless, his eyes were filled with disgust as he looked at that idiot. He leaned his horse closer to Fan Zhuo’s side, it was as if he remained close to Qiao Chu, he’d be infected with his idiocy.

Fan Zhuo looked at the funny sight of his companions, and couldn’t help but chuckled a little. He didn’t know how long this period of contentment would last, but every minute and every second made him feel extremely precious.

Zheng Weilong looked at all this with envy. During this time that she had been following Jun Wu Xie, along with Ah Da, and they found that these men had a good relationship with Jun Wu Xie. They were close like brothers, and this was something beautiful that Zheng Weilong had never seen. She always heard Qiao Chu and others addressing Jun Wu Xie as “Little Xie”; Zheng Weilong was a little confused about this form of address, but she was very clever and didn’t ask much, just as... she was wise to keep the shock at seeing Jun Wu Xie being carried away by Jun Wu Yao in her heart.

This Sea Spirit City was a bit strange, but the people here made her feel warm.
