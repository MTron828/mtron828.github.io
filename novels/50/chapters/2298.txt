Qiao Chu touched his chin and gave it a serious thought for a moment before he said with a wretched smile on his face, “Exceptionally extravagant... Gold everywhere, inlaid with precious gems. Luxury beyond imagination, beautiful coloured gems, everywhere you turn, it will be a bedazzling sight to behold.”

The Dark Regions was a powerful force and after personally seeing the countless treasures in the tomb of the Dark Emperor, he had a huge understanding on the wealth of Jun Wu Yao. Treasures that piled up into a mountain in the tomb... then didn’t that mean that in the Dark Regions, wouldn’t they be immensely rich?

Ye Sha had been left speechless by Qiao Chu’s delusion and the corner of his mouth twitched slightly. He could not help but imagine the scene depicted by Qiao Chu and these words immediately came to mind – extravagance beyond limits!

“Cough, Lord Jue does not like things that are too... extravagant.” Ye Sha said it reserved manner, Jun Wu Yao was never a person that was interested in luxury and wealth. The treasures that piled up into a mountain were just some coloured stones to him, some sparkling ornaments that resembled coloured glass, that’s all.

What he enjoyed was the suppression of strength before plundering.

Most of the wealth of the Dark Regions was obtained after the unification of the Middle Realm. Various forces had came forward to offer tributes and tried to please Jun Wu Yao with these. Obviously, they had not understood him at all.

From the style that the Dark Regions had been constructed, it was not at all difficult to see that he held no interest in luxurious things.

“Extravagant? I don’t think so, lakes of wine and forests of meat, how nice is that....” Qiao Chu touched his mouth sloppily to make sure that no saliva had drooled out. Having living a bitter life of poverty for more than a decade, towards the importance of wealth, it could be said that he had a deep understanding.

If they had not met Jun Wu Xie, they would most probably still be miserable and poor, always hungry and pass their days without knowing if they would be able to eat the next meal!

Qiao Chu’s strange objection had made the rest of them feel that they could not wait to kick that useless fool into a river. After all, they had passed so many years living a better life yet this fool here still acted like a country bumpkin who had not entered a city in his life!

What shame!

It was too shameful!

Fortunately, the people of the Night Regime did not react to any of Qiao Chu’s antics, they just had the same cold and indifferent expression as if nothing had been heard at all.

“Cough... I think that I should arrange your lodgings first. Although the Dark Regions is not luxurious but the lodgings aren’t bad.” Ye Sha could only change the topic, he was afraid that if he had not done so, he would have suffered a heavy blow and incur an internal injury from just Qiao Chu’s words.

Qiao Chu nodded excitedly, although this place was not luxurious but it was very unique and it had stirred up his interest.

Ye Sha let the people of the Night Regime arrange the lodgings for the people of the Rui Lin Army.

The Dark Regions was very large but there weren’t many people living in it. Providing lodgings for ten thousand people were not a problem at all.

Qiao Chu and the rest did not head to their lodgings first but followed Jun Wu Xie fervently like five little tails, cautiously treading behind her, filled with the fear that they might lose her any time.

Towards this, Jun Wu Xie did not have much reaction. Things that needed introduction had been introduced by Ye Sha, all she did was remain silent.

Upon reaching the Palace of the Dark Regions, Qiao Chu and the others looked up at the majestic Palace before them in awe. They could not tell what kind of material the buildings in the Dark Regions were constructed with but they only felt that those jet black bricks were very majestic and domineering.

Before Jun Wu Xie had led them into the Palace, they saw Ye Mei rushing out of the Palace in a flurry and the moment he saw Jun Wu Xie, he immediately rushed forward with relief.

“Young Miss! You are finally back, those few started creating a din again!”
