After Jun Wu Xie retreated from the banquet, Qiao Chu and others emerged from the dark corner they were hiding before and immediately surrounded her. While they were hiding, they had a panoramic view of everything that happened during the banquet. Jun Wu Xie’s efficiency and accuracy was on point, she didn’t do a sloppy job.

“That’s it?” Qiao Chu was a little bewildered as he felt that Jun Wu Xie didn’t take much time taking over the 72 cities. The efficiency was a bit amazing.

“Otherwise?” Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow slightly.

“Isn’t this a little too fast?” Qiao Chu scratched his head, he noticed that Jun Wu Xie only did two things in total at the Banquet of Heroes. One was to drink tea, the other was to beat people up, and then... there was nothing else.

Jun Wu Xie just cast a glance at Qiao Chu but remained silent.

Fan Zhuo said with a smile: “Little Xie has set out the trap for a while, now it is just collecting what’s been caught in her net. Besides, once her Spirit Ring was revealed, who else will dare to come forward and die?”

“But ... there are so many of them, although there are no Spirit Ring exponents, but ... if they decide to attack in a group, it is not easy for Little Xie to use only one Spirit Ring.” Qiao Chu scratched his head again. Jun Wu Xie had no intention of revealing her Dual Spirit Rings. At the banquet, there were more than 60 men with strong Spiritual Inscriptions. But they really fought with Jun Wu Xie, the outcome was still uncertain.

“Do you think they will be willing to fight Jun Wu Xie so that others may benefit?” Fei Yan rolled his eyes are Qiao Chu.

Although the 72 cities were collectively referred to as one, they were not unified. There was no real leader to guide them. No matter how strong they were, they were just a plate of loose sand.

“Say ... Did I see Gu Xin Yan just now?” Fei Yan asked as he changed the topic.

The faces of Qiao Chu and others shifted slightly.

They are not unfamiliar with Gu Xin Yan. After the Twelve Palaces was destroyed by Jun Wu Xie, Gu Xin Yan was rescued by Jun Wu Xie, but she later left the branch of Spirit Jade Palace. They were unclear where she had gone.

But, they really didn’t expect to see Gu Xin Yan again in the Upper Realm.

“If I haven’t heard it wrong, it seems the person who sent Gu Xin Yan here is... Highness Ying? Why ... do I have this feeling that this is related to Gu Ying?” Rong Ruo frowned slightly. To them, they had a strong sense of repulsion for Gu Ying.

At that time, Jun Wu Xie took over the Twelve Palaces, it was then that Gu Ying brought men to attack them. If it wasn’t for Jun Wu Yao’s timely arrival, they really wouldn’t know how things will have ended up. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Brother Wu Yao said that although Gu Ying’s body has been destroyed, his soul is not destroyed. I have been curious as to how he will have this capability. But now... I roughly understand. But... How is he the son of the Lord of the Upper Realm?” Hua Yao frowned as he spoke. Gu Ying could be considered their old foe. There had been several times now that Jun Wu Xie had foiled Gu Ying’s plans. If this Highness Ying was really Gu Ying, then things would get really difficult.

“If that guy is really Gu Ying, then I’m afraid more troubles will come our way. Jun Wu Xie is the sworn enemy of that guy.” Qiao Chu frowned.

This Highness Ying caused Qiao Chu and the others to raise their vigilance, while Jun Wu Xie slipped into a contemplative state. Gu Xin Yan’s appearance seemed like an omen.

“Ye Mei.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

Ye Mei appeared suddenly.

“Go and invite Gu Xin Yan.” Jun Wu Xie said.

In order to determine whether Highness Ying was Gu Ying, they should start with Gu Xin Yan.

Ye Mei left immediately to carry out his orders.
