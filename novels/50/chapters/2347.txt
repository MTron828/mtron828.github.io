It would be better if Fan Zhuo didn’t explain in details as Qiao Chu looked even more terrified after listening to him.

Crystal Orchid and the others were plant ring spirits that were originally sublimated from plants. For humans, those were just some flowers and plants but for the plant ring spirits, those were considered as part of their race.

Saying that Crystal Orchid took dead plants as his nutrients was just like saying that humans ate corpses for meals. Didn’t both the statements sound exactly the same?

As a beauty lover, Qiao Chu was so shocked to learn about the identity of Crystal Orchid.

He was so good looking but why...

“Give me a moment, Little Xie... Isn’t there just any normal one... Among your ring spirits?” At that moment, Qiao Chu felt that Rolly was such a little cutie among these ring spirits. Its personality was so kind and pure that there was no way for it to get better. It ate no meat and siblings. Just let it gnaw on some bamboo and it will be satisfied.

While looking at Qiao Chu who was half dead lying prone on the table with an overly shocked expression on his face, Hua Yao shook his head without anyone knowing. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

His mental toughness was too weak!

“It is just my opinion but... How about this guy right here? Maybe he is not that aggressive.” Fei Yan glanced over the red-haired boy who was always smiling brightly. The ring spirit looked very young, just around Drunk Lotus’ age. He was neither cool like Crystal Orchid nor burly like Corpse Flower and he seemed to be the one who had the least lethality among the three new ring spirits.

Since Fei Yan felt that the boy was quite friendly and was easy to get close with, he reached out his hand and decided to touch his fire red clothes. Without him knowing, Little Lotus and the rest of the ring spirits, standing aside, were looking at him in horror, like they had seen a ghost.

“If I am you, I won’t be touching him.” Jun Wu Xie’s voice suddenly came into Fei Yan’s ears and the hand he stretched out was forced to take a halt in the air. He turned his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie who was keeping a straight face. He then tentatively asked. “Is he poisonous?”

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“He eats people?” Fei Yan guessed.

Still, Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

Fei Yan did not get it. Why would Jun Wu Xie stop him from touching the boy if he won’t eat people and wasn’t poisonous? He was so confused. He moved his sight and looked at the other ring spirits, trying to get a hint from them. Unfortunately, all of them were just gazing in pity at Fei Yan.

It seemed like those eyes were saying farewell to him.

Their stares gave Fei Yan goosebumps, causing him to bring his hand back to him subconsciously and behave himself by maintaining a particular distance between the red-haired boy. Pretending to be calm, he asked. “I’m sorry but... Is it okay for me to ask for your name?”

The red-haired boy gave him an innocent smile that was brighter than the previous one. “I am Blood Velvet.”

“Snow Velvet?” Fei Yan blinked his eyes several times. Wasn’t it a really cute name?

“It’s ‘ blood 1 ‘. I mean as in bleeding.” Realising that her friend might have made some kind of mistake since the pronunciation of both the words ‘blood’ and ‘snow’ were the same, Jun Wu Xie reminded him.

“Bleeding... Blood...” For a plant that had the word ‘blood’ included in its name, Fei Yan didn’t really think that this plant was a suitable one to be trifled with.

While watching Fei Yan changed his expression, Poppy couldn’t help himself from chuckling. He asked, “Do you still remember about the three leaders of the plant spirits I told you during your first time to the Spirit World?”

“Yeah, I do remember. You and Poison Ivy are part of them... But we never found out who is the last...” It felt like the following words were stuck in Fei Yan throat and he was unable to finish his sentence. He turned his head slowly and looked at Blood Velvet who smiled like a blooming flower. His stiffened finger pointed at Blood Velvet and asked. “For the other one... Is that you?”

How could it be?

No matter how he observed, the boy definitely didn’t look like someone who was as brutal as Poison Ivy and Poppy!
