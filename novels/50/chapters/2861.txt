Yan Xi frowned as she sat in Han Shu’s room as Han Shu’s endless cursing was ringing in her ears. She didn’t say a word but the expression on her face was ugly. That, however, was not caused by Han Shu.

“Are you listening to me?” Han Shu went on and on for a long while but she didn’t get any response from Yan Xi. She looked at Yan Xi with impatience.

After Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu met, Yan Xi was in a foul mood. In one glance, Han Shu could tell how Yan Xi felt about Jun Gu and a plan formed in her mind to join forces.

‘The enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Han Shu had hated Han Zi Fei far longer than just one or two days, and now that Han Zi Fei was about to marry Jun Gu, no matter how hard Han Shu tried to come up with a plan, it was hard to cause any trouble for Han Zi Fei within two days.

But Yan Xi was different. Yan Xi was Jun Gu’s aide. Even after Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei were married, Yan Xi would leave with them. Compared with herself, Yan Xi would have more opportunities to cause trouble. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Listen, what you mean is for you and I to work together to deal with Han Zi Fei?” Yan Xi finally spoke but her mind was still confused. The moment that Jun Gu fell in love with Han Zi Fei at first sight, chaos ran amok in her heart. She could not think clearly, the only thing she knew was the extreme sense of jealousy and unhappiness.

“That’s right! Han Zi Fei and Lord Jun Gu will marry in two days, and after which they will leave Holy Mountain. I don’t have the chance to leave the Holy Mountain, so only you will have the opportunity to be close to the both of them. Don’t tell me you are alright with that bitch Han Zi Fei snatching away Lord Jun Gu?! What else does Han Zi Fei have besides her beauty? She committed such a great crime when she fled from the Upper Realm those years ago. If she isn’t the Scared Maiden, she would have died a thousand deaths for her crime! But in the end? The moment she returned, she was given the honour of a conjugal union with Lord Jun Gu. Who knows if she had been tainted by other men during those years she spent away from the Upper Realm. To let such a ‘dirty’ woman stick to Lord Jun Gu, are you happy with that?!” Han Shu squinted at Yan Xi as she ranted those poisonous words that came from the bottom of her heart.

Yan Xi’s hatred for Han Zi Fei deepened bit by bit. She suddenly raised her eyes, and her eyes were bloodshot.

“Happy? How can I be happy! I wish she would die immediately!”

Han Shu smiled a relaxed smile. She knew that like her, Yan Xi hated Han Zi Fei to the core of her being.

“Then don’t make it easy for her. Elder Luo and you have learnt the art of witchcraft. Although I don’t understand the power of such an art, but it is able to kill someone without detection. In the whole Upper Realm, the number of people who know witchart can be counted with one’s fingers. If Han Zi Fei were to die suddenly, it would still be hard to find why. Once Han Zi Fei is dead, you can safely and peacefully stay beside Lord Jun Gu. No one will snatch him from you anymore.” Han Shu said coldly.

Yan Xi clenched her fists and looked up at Han Shu.

“You want to use me to do your dirty work?”

Han Shu sneered, “It is entirely up to you. I do hate Han Zi Fei, but she will soon leave the Sacred Maiden Tribe. So for me, as long as I don’t see her, I won’t be bothered by her. But can you? You will be seeing her every day and night exchanging love and affection with Lord Jun Gu, being intimate with him. Will you be able to bear with it?”

“Enough!” Yan Xi said suddenly.

“I know what I’m going to do, I can take action but you have to help me prepare something ...”
