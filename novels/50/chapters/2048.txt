Wu Jiu’s eyes flashed with a sneering glint. Jiang Yun Long’s high ambition was clear to him but Wu Jiu did not show it in the slightest but to merely say nonchalantly.

“Flame Dragon, Poison Ivy and Soul Slayer are not morons. Although fights among the three great spirit races are happening frequently, but they are still within a controllable scale and is merely something they are concerned about. Not to mention the harm that the Serene Spirit Tower could bring to non human spirits, just my decision to assign the fourth Serene Spirit Tower to one spirit race would already have caused the three of them to be on their guard. Even if I do not agree to come, and let all of them continue to fight, it still wouldn’t create all that big of a stir, and that is not what I want to see.” The corners of Wu Jiu’s mouth curled up into a sneer, as he looked at the Beast Spirits passing at the sides.

In the past, these Beast Spirits would be glaring balefully at him when they met, but today, he had instead seen traces of servility in their eyes.

That change, caused the mirth in Wu Jiu’s eyes to deepen. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This was the result he was seeking.

He did not believe that any spirit could be absolutely pure in this world, who did not long for any power, and did not yearn to possess any authority. They had all been so at peace only because they had not been presented with an opportunity before their eyes. If they were given a better choice, it would then elicit the dark side buried deep within one’s soul.

Jiang Yun Long was slightly startled, as he came to understand what Wu Jiu’s intentions were, and his eyes widened as he stared.

“Master is indeed one of surpassing intelligence! Your disciple has been too narrow sighted.”

Wu Jiu gave a dismissive wave of his hand. Towards Jiang Yun Long’s compliment, he was not flattered.

After Wu Jiu and Jiang Yun Long walked for a while, they finally came to the front of Flame Dragon’s cave. And right outside the cave, there were two figures already there.

The cold and enchanting Poison Ivy was languishing upon a chair formed with vines when he suddenly saw Wu Jiu appear. There wasn’t the slightest bit of surprise in his eyes but rather an appraising look in them as his emotionless eyes swept over the figure of Wu Jiu.

Standing right opposite Poison Ivy, a large black sword towered at the side, the large sword jet black throughout, but glowing with a cold metallic sheen. Upon the great blade, there was a faintly discernible dragon motif, its hilt a depiction of a black dragon, its eyes two embedded red rubies, the contrast of the blood red stones against the black making it look more majestic!

Soul Slayer, the leader of all the Weapons Spirits. According to rumours, before the Soul Slayer was destroyed, it was once the supreme divine artifact, possessing the power to slay a soul completely. Even when it came to the Spirit World, it still reigned supreme among the Weapon Spirits, with none of the spirits daring to antagonize the Soul Slayer in the slightest. Even though it had become a spirit body, the blade of the Soul Slayer was still able to make any spirit disperse and scatter in an instant, and it could very well be said that the Soul Slayer was the very nemesis against spirits!

And because the Soul Slayer sat at the top, the Weapon Spirits had shone brilliantly for a time.

The metallic humming resonance sounded out from the Soul Slayer, the pair of blood red rubies glinting with a scintillating lustre, like a pair of eyes, that surveyed everything around it.

Accompanying that humming resonance, the ground beneath Wu Jiu and Jiang Yun Long rumbled as they gigantic Flame Dragon came walking slowly out from its cave, its immense body seemingly that of an absolute ruler, reigning supreme over all, majestic and resplendent.

“Everyone’s here.” The Flame Dragon said as it came out of its cave, its immense size allowing it to look down from height, at the “guests” it had invited.

Jiang Yun Long stood behind Wu Jiu, his heart secretly filled with terror as he looked at the leaders of the three great spirit races before his eyes, the aura emanating from their bodies something not something he could readily withstand.
