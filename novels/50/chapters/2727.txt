Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Just Sea Spirit City on its own was not scary, even if Jun Wu Xie really had the ability to occupy the thirty-two cities, it would just a flock of birds with same feathers. The real reason why these ten City Lords were about to take action, was not because Jun Wu Xie had successively invaded the other cities, but it was the elixir that increased Sea Spirit City’s strength so rapidly!

Everyone in the 72 cities knew the level of strength Sea Spirit City possessed before. However under the short leadership of Jun Wu Xie, Sea Spirit City soared into the sky as the city knocked down the stronger cities in its vicinity. Sea Spirit City didn’t even need time to rest and recuperate as the city’s troops continued marching onwards, its ferociousness was really staggering. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

All of this ‘depended’ upon the elixir of unknown origin. Blazing Flame City had already received some of the elixir from its spies earlier in the morning, but no matter how they studied it, they couldn’t find the formula nor how it worked. Blazing Flame City gave the elixir to some of the men, and after taking it, the men’s spiritual power increased significantly. And it shocked them! Rather than taking into consideration at Jun Wu Xie’s offensive, they were spying on the formula that Jun Wu Xie owned!

It would be a great help for any city if they could obtain possession of that formula!

No one would be willing to give up such a treasure.

“The effect of the elixir is really powerful, but Yan Hai hides the prescription very securely. My spies never had any chance to even touch it. I wonder if any of you had any success?” The Hidden Demon City Lord looked at everyone present as he said it.

The other City Lords shook their heads.

“Although I don’t care about the matters of Sea Spirit City, but that Yan Hai brat has been too arrogant. He obviously doesn’t give any regards to us, the top ten cities. I think it may be time to teach him a lesson.” Blazing Flame City Lord said.

The City Lords all nodded, and although on the surface it was the reason given by the lord of Blazing Flame City but they knew exactly what the lesson was for.

“This is not difficult, except that the recent movements of White Night City are not small, and Sea Spirit City is very far away from us. If we send a large number of troops, it won’t be appropriate. But if that number is too small, then I am afraid that it won’t demoralise Sea Spirit City.” The City Lord of Resolute City frowned. The top ten cities had decided to divide themselves into two factions. One faction consisted of the five cities, and the other faction was led by the top city; the White Night City, and under him was 5 other cities.

Although it might not be sincere between the five cities, they considered themselves allies, at least until White Night City had been wiped out.

The other City Lords listened to the words of Resolute City Lord, and they were also cautious. The reason why they actively wanted to get the prescription from Sea Spirit City was to be able to master more power and take action against White Night City!

Nangong Yan looked at the reactions of other City Lords, and suddenly chuckled: “This is not difficult to do.”

“Oh? Do you have an idea, Brother Nangong?”

Nangong Yan gave a meaningful chuckle, and suddenly he raised his hands and clapped.

With the applause of Nangong Yan, the locked door of the study was suddenly opened, and a handsome-looking man walked in.

The other City Lords in the study stood up immediately when they saw the new-arrival, the arrogance on their faces disappearing instantly. The admirers looked respectfully at the new person and said, “I pay my respects to Lord Nangong!”

The sixth person who appeared in the study was Nangong Lie, who had become one of the top ten exponents!
