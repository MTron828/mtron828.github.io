Chapter 2979 Enemy approaching 1

After the storm Jun Wu Xie kicked up, there were only three Top Ten Experts left, leaving seven positions empty. After a moment of panic, people started getting excited. The larger number of experts killed, the more empty positions would be available for grab. Under the Upper Realm’s philosophy of the weak will stand as an easy prey to the strong, no one cared about those who had been sacrificed.

All the people in White Night City had left Sacred City the night after Bai Zhu’s death.

The selection contest of the Top Ten Experts continued.

Jun Wu Xie deliberately found a restaurant, as a place of cover. Usually she would appear once or twice. But more often, she would take care of Fei Yan and the others in the place prepared by Nangong Lie.

Fei Yan and Qiao Chu still struggled with the integration of the new Spirit Ring. But they struggled and forced themselves to pull through this process.

Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo woke up two days later. They were shocked after hearing what Jun Wu Xie had done. They fell into a huge silence after hearing about Rong Ruo’s death.

However, the final choice of the two of them was the same as that of Qiao Chu and Fei Yan. They also accepted the gift of the Spirit Ring. After experiencing this time, each of them was very clear that no matter how fast they had progressed. Their strength was still not good enough in the Upper Realm.

The selection trials were in full swing. Nangong Lie found Jun Wu Xie a few days later and brought a message to Jun Wu Xie.

“Chi Yan?” Jun Wu Xie squinted her eyes slightly and put down the medicine in her hand.

“That’s right, Chi Yan was one of the Knights of Destruction and the earliest person to become a Knight of Destruction. It could be said that in the Upper Realms, he was the confidant of His Lord. He invited you to a dinner at his house three days later. He received instructions from His Lord.” Nangong Lie looked at Jun Wu Xie with some worries in his heart. After Long Yao had planned so many insidious traps for Jun Wu Xie, he was worried that Jun Wu Xie would have a huge rejection towards the Knight of Destruction.

Jun Wu Xie looked up at Jun Wu Yao who was sitting by the side. His brows furrowed slightly, “Chi Yan, I seem to have met him before.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“You’ve met him before?” Jun Wu Xie said.

When Jun Wu Yao was known as Ye Jue, the name of the Knights of Destruction had yet to appear.The appearance of the Knights of Destruction only began after the arrest of Jun Wu Yao. With regards to any of the Knights of Destruction, Jun Wu Yao knew nothing about them.

“When I was still in the Upper Realm, I did hear about this person. It was just that this person wasn’t a Knight of Destruction, but just a dead man next to His Lord. His strength was similar to that of Luo Qingcheng and wasn’t considered a great exponent.” Jun Wu Yao said.

The creation of the Knights of Destruction was a huge mystery for everyone. Regardless of whether it was Jun Gu or Chi Yan, before they became the Knight of Destruction, their strength was not supreme. But after they had become one, their power was something that the Top Ten Experts could not keep up.

Especially Jun Gu. Before Jun Gu had died, he was not even a purple spirit. However, after becoming a Knight of Destruction, his strength had escalated to the pinnacle! In addition, his death didn’t last long. To train one into such a powerful person within a short time, and to surpass the power of the Spirit Ring exponent, it was almost impossible. But it was just ... His Lord had managed to do it.

Even Jun Wu Xie had to admit that in nurturing strong exponents, the Lord was impeccable yet strange!
