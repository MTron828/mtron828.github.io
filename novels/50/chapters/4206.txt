Chapter 2802: Guests With Hidden Intentions (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Within the next few days, a group of people came to the Sea Spirit City.

The entire group consisted of women dressed in pure white, and they all were beautiful in appearance. They looked like they were all about twenty years old but their actual age was inestimable.

Duan Qi rode a white horse in front of the group. Several women of the Sacred Maiden Tribe followed behind her. The women who came with her from the Sacred Mountain were staying in White Night City before, and this time, she brought them all with her to Sea Spirit City.

Jun Wu Xie had already given an order to the members of the Night Regime to allow the group passage into the city.

Walking along the streets of Sea Spirit City, the women of the Sacred Maiden Tribe slightly lifted their chins, as if they were born with a sense of nobility and arrogance, their eyes sweeping past the streets of Sea Spirit City.

“This is Sea Spirit City? Elder Duan, the owner of this Sea Spirit City, is the dual Spirit Rings exponent?” A gorgeous-looking woman frowned slightly as she glanced around Sea Spirit City with a trace of disgust in her eyes.

Compared with the vast White Night City, Sea Spirit City was much smaller, though it was neater. However, the women who stayed for a period of time in White Night City were somewhat disgusted.

Such a remote and barren city could really breed such a strong dual Spirit Ring exponent?

Duan Qi said coldly, “According to the information given by Bai Zhu, it should be correct.”

“But originally, only fishermen lived in this Sea Spirit City. I don’t believe that they would have such a strong person here.” The beautiful woman couldn’t help but whispered, “What kind of exponent is he? He’s just an incompetent fool! He knows that Elder Duan is arriving today but yet he did not send anyone to greet her. That is so rude.”

Because of its special status in the Upper Realm, the 72 cities couldn’t be compared to the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Therefore, no matter which member of the Sacred Maiden Tribe visited any one of the 72 cities, even if the city lord didn’t go out to greet them, the city lord would have arranged a greeting party.

Unlike this Sea Spirit City...

Since entering the city till now, apart from the guards and citizens on the streets, they hadn’t seen anyone else come out to greet them.

The lack of ‘proper’ treatment made the Sacred Maidens quite uncomfortable, as they were used to otherwise.

They were accustomed to being treated like the world revolved around them, and they had thought that upon arriving at Sea Spirit City, they would be greeted by the city lord, but... there were no arrangements made, as if they were regular travellers to the city.

“Han Shu.” Duan Qi halted suddenly in her steps.

The woman who had been complaining suddenly lost her voice and looked respectfully at Duan Qi.

“Mind your words and action. Did you forget what I have spoken to you before? If you have so many complaints, you don’t have to follow us.” Duan Qi frowned.

Han Shu quickly shook her head and said, “Elder Duan, it is Han Shu who has misspoken. But Han Shu is just embarrassed on Elder Duan’s behalf. I was just thinking of the courtesy City Lord Bai accorded to Elder Duan with White Night City being the top city among the 72 cities. In contrast, this small Sea Spirit City which is dependent on its dual Spirit Rings exponent, has neglected Elder Duan, they really don’t know the proper etiquette. ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Duan Qi’s brow creased even deeper. Although she didn’t show any outward expression, it was obvious that the “welcoming” of Sea Spirit City had made her somewhat dissatisfied.

“I know what your thoughts are. Although Bai Zhu is good, he is not suitable for you.” Duan Qi maintained her calm and responded faintly.
