Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

It was a rare cooperation between Bai Zhu and Nangong Yan. Under Jun Wu Xie’s pressure, the two of them became the leaders of the coalition army this time. The 72 City Lords gathered again in a restaurant as they all focused their attention on Bai Zhu And Nangong Yan.

“Brother Bai, this time you miscalculated. I didn’t expect that Yan Hai’s appetite was so big. What he wants is not the position of the top ten cities, but the entire 72 cities.” Nangong Yan sneered at Bai Zhu. No matter how tactful Bai Zhu was, he could no longer endure Jun Wu Xie.

Bai Zhu glanced at Nangong Yan, his face carrying a gentle smile as usual.

“Brother Nangong, you don’t have to laugh at me. Now that we are on the same boat, no matter how much grievances we had before, we can have let go for now. Yan Hai’s strength is far beyond our expectations. Sea Spirit City is on its own this time round and everyone here has seen its army strength. The strength of Sea Spirit City is strong, and its City Lord is even more powerful. If it is a one to one battle, even the combined strength of the top ten cities are not his opponent, let alone White Night City.”

Nangong Yan hummed coldly, but did not go to persuade Bai Zhu again.

The other City Lords were all indifferent, obviously they had been shocked by the strength of the Sea Spirit City and Jun Wu Xie.

“Since this is the case, there is nothing left to say. How is Brother Bai going to arrange?” Nangong Yan said positively.

“Gathering the power of the cities, it will be necessary to take down the Sea Spirit City, otherwise the 72 cities will have to listen to his commands in the future.” Bai Zhu said with a gleam of cold light in his eyes. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this point, Bai Zhu paused for a moment before he suddenly looked at Zheng Ke who was standing amongst the crowd.

“Brother Zheng.”

Zheng Ke was surprised when he was called.

“Before hearing, Brother Zheng had sent your daughter to Long Xuan City. Since Long Xuan City was destroyed by Yan Hai, your young lady seems to be in Sea Spirit City now?” Bai Zhu looked at Zheng Ke as enquired.

Zheng Ke’s face changed slightly. He had heard about Zheng Weilong’s incident in Sea Spirit City, and he had sent many people to contact her. He had gained a lot of news about Sea Spirit City. This time, when he went to Sea Spirit City to attend the Banquet of Heroes, Zheng Ke also personally sought Zheng Weilong out and inquired about Jun Wu Xie.

When Bai Zhu said this, it seems as if he knew something. Zheng Ke could only nod his head and said, “Yes, the young girl Zheng Weilong is now in the Sea Spirit City.”

“Oh? I heard that Miss Zheng’s looks are so beautiful but she has no spiritual power. I wonder how she can stay in Sea Spirit City for so long?” Bai Zhu narrowed her eyes. Zheng Ke had always supported White Owl City before. But everything is just superficial. How could Bai Zhu not know what Zheng Ke,that old fox, was thinking?

When Zheng Ke sent his daughters to other cities to contact other City Lords, Bai Zhu had realized Zheng Ke’s intentions. But he had been pretending that he did not know.

However, the situation of Sea Spirit City was very special. The spies sent by the cities have been wiped out. The only one left was Zheng Weilong, which was really subtle.

How could Zheng Ke not know Bai Zhu’s speculation? From Bai Zhu’s tone, a drop of cold sweat trickled down his forehead.

“This ... about this matter... I have also looked her up when I was in Sea Spirit City, but she does not seem to be particularly clear about the happenings in Sea Spirit City.”
