Chapter 2267: A period of years（10）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Lower Realm of today was very lively but despite that, everything was orderly. Five years ago, Lin Palace and the Iron Heart Empress Qu Ling Yue had jointly issued a conscription and for a time, the entire Lower Realm was boiling with excitement.

Since the unification of the Lower Realm, the division of the countries soon became very vague. Over time, the word ‘country’ had long ceased to exist. Most of the former armies had been disbanded and many soldiers who worked in various countries went home. However, the hot blood hidden in their hearts had not disappeared but increased with each passing day. This conscription suddenly caused an uproar in the Lower Realm and a large number of retired soldiers responded to the call.

The Iron Blood Army that belonged to the Iron Blood Empress and the Rui Lin Army had long been famous far and wide. As soon as the news came out, a large number of young and middle aged men rushed to sign up. Many teenagers who had longed for the Rui Lin Army also eagerly tried to join the army. Now, the military might of the Lower Realm was far greater than the past when there were still countries!

Among them, the force of the Iron Blood Army and the Rui Lin Army was even more astounding.

At this moment, in the Lin Palace, there was a long silence in the hall. Qu Ling Yue, Jun Xian, Mo Qian Yuan and Gu Li Sheng all were all seated in the main hall and a soldier of the Rui Lin Army knelt on one knee and reported all that he had seen.

Time fleeted by but it had not left much traces on Jun Xian. He was calm and awe-inspiring as he used to be just that there were only some vicissitudes and wisdom added. Currently the infamous Duke Lin , commander-in-chief of the Rui Lin Army was trembling in excitement as his eyes revealed a suppressed sentiment.

“What you just said... are all true?” Jun Xian stared at that soldier before him, his words started to falter.

It had been five years.

Five long years had passed!

He had been repressing all the anxiety and uneasiness in his heart for more than one thousand eight hundred days and nights. He finally felt a sense of relief wash over him, even though Jun Xian was such a calm person, he still could not control the exhilaration in his heart.

“Your subordinate speaks the truth and has confirmed that Master Ye Sha was seen in one of the Palaces in the Middle Realm! And there was a group of powerful people around Master Ye Sha. Listening to the description from the people of the Middle Realm, it should be the Night Regime of the Dark Regions.” The soldier replied earnestly and nodded with conviction. When he saw that Ye Sha had appeared amongst those black robed men that day, his heart almost jumped out in excitement!

Everyone in the Rui Lin Army knew that Ye Sha always followed by Jun Wu Xie’s side. That was Jun Wu Yao’s arrangement and five years ago after that bloody battle, Jun Wu Yao was captured and Jun Wu Xie disappeared. Ye Sha, Ye Mei and Ye Gu who followed her also went missing. Now that Ye Sha had appeared, it made people certain that Jun Wu Xie was most possibly in the Dark Regions!

Otherwise, why would Ye Sha appear?

The appearance of Ye Sha had indirectly proved that the insistence of Jun Xian and the rest were not for naught.

Jun Wu Xie was definitely still alive!

There was a still silence in the entire hall and Jun Xian took a deep breath as he let out the overwhelming happiness in his chest as he chortled heartily.

Qu Ling Yue lowered her head slightly as she wiped away the tears in her eyes.

Mo Qian Yuan let out a sigh of relief and there was a hint of joy at the corner of his mouth that he did not even notice. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“That’s good, that’s good, as long as Wu Xie is alive, nothing else matters.” Gu Li Sheng was greatly relieved as he spoke.
