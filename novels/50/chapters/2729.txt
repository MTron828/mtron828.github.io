Several city owners were satisfied with this, and Nangong Lie didn’t express any opinion on it. Since entering the study, he had not spoken a word, and had remained silent.

Until after Nangong Yan and the City Lords discussed the matter properly and the City Lords got up, bade farewell and left, but Nangong Lie was deep in thought and ignored their actions.

“Master Nangong, are you still in a better mood?” Nangong Yan looked at the child he raised, his tone held great respect for his son.

Nangong Lie slowly came back to himself as he saw Nangong Yan looking at him thoughtfully, he immediately covered up the emotions in his eyes, and got up and said, “Nothing. Is everything OK?”

Nangong Yan nodded, and did not question further.

“The team can gather in five days. By then ...” Nangong Yan stared at Nangong Lie without saying a word.

“I know. If there’s nothing else, I’ll go first.” Nangong Lie’s eyes flashed with impatience.

“Yes, yes, yes, your room is ready, Master Nangong can go back to rest first.” Nangong Yan smiled.

Nangong Lie didn’t have any interest in talking, he turned around and left. As he walked through the official residence of Blazing Flame City, there was a familiarity with everything there as he had lived there since he was a child. However, those familiar things didn’t give him any comfort now.

The scenes from not long ago were fresh in his memory, and he would never forget them. The scene where the grim reaper had appeared.

At that time, he went to the Middle Realm with a grave mission, but he did not expect that not only did he lose all the soldiers he took, he also had to flee back to the Upper Realm like a drowned dog. Although His Lord did not blame him too much, but Nangong Lie clearly realized that His Lord ‘s trust in him had been diminishing continuously. However Nangong Lie couldn’t do anything about it. Even until now... he would often dream about those scenes...

As long as he thought of that person’s face, his hands would tremble and shake, and he couldn’t fight.

This kind of fear that was hidden in the bones, Nangong Lie never said anything to anyone, he couldn’t say, dared not say ...

He just hoped that in this life, he would never meet that woman who was like a devil ...

During this time, he always felt that he was in a nightmare, and that shadow hanging over his heart never dissipating.

Because of this, he agreed to Nangong Yan’s request and decided to find something to distract his attention.

But he didn’t know ...

...

...

Nangong Yan’s action was very fast. After five days, the five city masters assembled their teams, and had seemed to have reached a consensus. Each city sent 6,000 elite soldiers, and each sent their troops to follow the army. And this army of elites gathered in five cities, the real commander in chief, was Nangong Lie.

The five City Lords couldn’t miss the scene as they watched Nangong Lie leave with a large number of soldiers. Nangong Yan and several other City Lords’ hearts were considered to be grounded.

“This time, we have troubled Master Nangong. I believe it won’t be long before we can hear the good news of Master Nangong.” The Lord of Hidden Demon City said with happiness.

“This is natural, no matter how powerful that Yan Hai is, I don’t think he can be a worthy opponent to Master Nangong? We just need to wait for the news.” Nangong Yan said proudly.

After some more chats with the City Lords, they left.

No one knew that a good show was about to happen to the team they have sent....DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
