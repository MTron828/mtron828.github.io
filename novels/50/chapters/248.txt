Chapter 249: “Unspoken Intentions (3)”

With Jun Wu Xie’s assurance, Bai Yun Xian sighed in relief. She had already cut her ties completely with the Qing Yun Clan. Anyone with half a brain would be able to think that Bai Yun Xian had been in cahoots with Jun Wu Xie to bring about the deaths of Qin Yu Yan and the other members of her delegation. There was no way for her to return to the Qing Yun Clan anymore.

Over the days, Bai Yun Xian had come to realise from her observation of Jun Wu Xie’s manner of handling things. She found that as long as she did not go against Jun Wu Xie’s wishes, her life can still be rather peaceful.

Besides the poison within her, Bai Yun Xian did not find her life in the Imperial Palace to be lacking, and could be somewhat fulfilling.

With nowhere else she could go, she had learnt to be content.

“There are twelve peaks within the Qing Yun Clan’s control, with the main peak under the command of the Sovereign, the other eleven peaks were overseen by an Elder each. It was said, every peak specialised in a different area of expertise. Among them, the Elder of Cloud Treading Peak was the youngest among all, and he was the son of the previous Sovereign. The current Sovereign was not of the same family tree, but was a direct disciple under the previous Sovereign. Nobody knew how the leadership of the Qing Yun Clan fell into the hands of the disciple, but it was known that the current Sovereign did not get allong well with the Elder of Cloud Treading Peak. The residual support for the former Sovereign had remained significant and the Sovereign had had his hands tied. But in recent years, the Sovereign had secretly moved to remove many of those supporters and the Elder of the Cloud Treading Peak was in a bleak situation. If my Miss intention is to go to the Qing Yun Clan, the Cloud Treading Peak would be a good place to start from and the Cloud Treading Peak’s Elder’s name is Mu Chen. The Qing Yun Clan opens their doors to recruit talents every month, and with my Miss’ extraordinary talents in medicine, it would be a breeze for you to slip into the Qing Yun Clan as a new recruit.”

Since Bai Yun Xian had decided to switch to Jun Wu Xie’s side, she had provided Jun Wu Xie with all the information and every single detail she knew about and hid nothing from her. She had in fact secretly hoped that Jun Wu Xie would be able to totally annihilate the whole of the Qing Yun Clan to prevent any acts of revenge against her in the future.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly, seemingly satisfied with Bai Yun Xian’s detailed and informative narration.

Selfish people are the easiest to manipulate. As long as you hold their lives in your hands, they were extremely cooperative when you need them.

Jun Wu Xie had kept Bai Yun Xian alive, was to use this well of information against the Qing Yun Clan.

Seeing that Jun Wu Xie was satisfied, Bai Yun Xian was feeling encouraged, and she further squeezed every single bit of information she had on the Qing Yun Clan, selling them out thoroughly, saying everything she knew and hiding nothing.

The strongest among them would be the Sovereign of the Qing Yun Clan itself, named Qin Yue, and he had broken through his spirit to the indigo level. Besides the disciples of the Qing Yun Clan, there were some permanent residents who stayed on as guest officers. These people command an indigo level spirit as well. They usually stayed hidden unless someone stirred up trouble within the Qing Yun Clan’s premises, where they would appear and rid the Qing Yun Clan of the trouble.

The Qing Yun Clan opened their doors for the recruitment every month only for a day, and people with outstanding talents in Medicine apply to join the Qing Yun Clan then. If they pass the tests set, they are admitted to the Outer House to study Medicine. The elite can progress in their second year to be admitted to the Inner House to study the Qing Yun Clan’s own unique practice of medicine. If they were lucky, and got selected by any of the Elders or the Sovereign of the twelve peaks themselves, they would be instantly promoted and be directly admitted into the Inner House to practice and develop themselves.

Jun Wu Xie had no intentions of wasting a year of her time at the Qing Yun Clan. At three months the most, she wanted the Qing Yun Clan to disappear from the face of the world!

“Which day monthly?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Bai Yun Xian answered without hesitation: “The fifteenth of every month would be the day they open their doors to receive talented disciples.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded as she contemplated.

Bai Yun Xian thought of something suddenly and her expression grew grave: “There is one thing, and I would ask my Miss to remember it.”

Jun Wu Xie frowned. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Among the twelve peaks, there is one named Hidden Cloud Peak, and its Elder is named Ke Cang Ju. The Hidden Cloud Peak portrays itself to specialise in the research of herbs, but in actual fact, they research more along the lines of poisons. The Hidden Cloud Peak had always set the lowest threshold for the acceptance of their disciples, and they had always accepted the biggest number of them. But..... those disciples had also always ended up dead for no rhyme or reason.” Bai Yun Xian said gravely.
