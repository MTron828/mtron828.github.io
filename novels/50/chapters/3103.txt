Chapter 3104 Finale 3

This would be the last battle ever in Three Realms!

The God of Destruction had no regard for life, treating humans like weeds while Jun Wu Xie had always tried to protect humanity in the world.

And the world was now repaying them in the same manner.

Jun Wu Yao may have had left the world, but he used his dying breath to tell everyone of the battle’s importance.

It was his final gift of love to Jun Wu Xie.

To give it their all!

“Impossible! I am a God! I am the God of this world! You can never defeat me!” The God of Destruction was consumed by madness and kept using the integrated reincarnation spell to try and gain more power.

However....

All the people who had felt threatened before had already escaped. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

All those who had not yet been consumed by the golden light had used all their spiritual power to escape.

There was an endless forest near the Sacred City that was barren all around it. After all the people had escaped, the spell was expanding fast but it still needed time and enough people to capture as a foundation.

On the other hand, the power of faith that Jun Wu Xie was receiving was being given to her out of peoples’ own free will, she neither needed to fight nor snatch to get it. All she needed to do was to accept it into her body.

This would be pivotal in deciding the final outcome.

The increase of the God of Destruction’s power started to slow down while Jun Wu Xie’s kept increasing rapidly. The purity and warmth of the power of faith was the source of her power.

Jun Wu Xie’s attacks started to become more fierce and the God of Destruction was growing weaker and more vulnerable under the barrage of attacks.

The moment that Jun Wu Xie was going to defeat the God of Destruction had finally arrived!

As the God of Destruction fell heavily to the ground, the arrogance he had built up over thousands of years had been completely destroyed and for the first time, fear was showing in his golden eyes. He stared at Jun Wu Xie, unable to believe that he had been defeated by someone from outside of this world.

He could not believe that he would be defeated by someone whom he had always treated as a pawn in his plans.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the fallen God of Destruction whose distraught face had fear all over it. But her own face did not show any trace of joy.

There was no joy, no excitement, only calmness.

“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it!” The God of Destruction stood up once more but his stature was somewhat diminished, he was severely weakened by Jun Wu Xie’s attacks and the integrated reincarnation spell had also worn off leaving him even weaker.

“How could you have beaten me? With what?!” The God of Destruction wailed at Jun Wu Xie like he was in mourning.

Jun Wu Xie pushed him from the altar into the mud and in that moment, his pride, built up over many years, was destroyed along with his dirty and greedy soul.

“You still don’t understand?” Jun Wu Xie said to him coldly.

The God of Destruction gritted his teeth and asked, “Understand?”
