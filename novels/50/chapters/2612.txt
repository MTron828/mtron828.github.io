Jun Wu Xie looked at the light sphere that was floating in front of her. She then raised her eyes and looked at Jun Wu Yao.

The light sphere consisted the purest soul power in the world. It was a treasure given by the Spirit Tree to settle the chaotic energy in Jun Wu Xie’s body.

Jun Wu Yao slightly nodded his head to Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie stretched her hands out and placed the light sphere between her hands.

The light sphere landed on Jun Wu Xie’s palms and turned into a gold mist in that instant before it infiltrated into Jun Wu Xie’s hands.

Jun Wu Xie could clearly feel that when the energy blended into her body, the chaotic energy which was tangling inside her had been cleansed up little by little!

They hadn’t even say anything yet but the Spirit Tree had already known about their purpose of visiting the Soul World. This showed that the things that were previously said by the Spirit Tree weren’t just some groundless rumours.

“Why won’t it finish the words?” After Jun Wu Xie had fully absorbed the light sphere, she looked at the quiet and huge Spirit Tree. It had already gone back to its original form. Every single sentence that it said just now had caused Jun Wu Xie to rack her brains, trying to figure out the meaning hidden in its words.

The Spirit Tree was the spirit life that had appeared the earliest in the Three Realms. It was because of its existence that there were so many souls existing in the Three Realms, and that there was this thing called the Metempsychosis Path in the Soul World.

The things it knew should probably be much more than anyone else in this world.

“It’s the causality that isn’t allowing the Spirit Tree to say it. Once it says it, it will then destruct the causality.” Jun Wu Yao slightly narrowed his eyes. There were some words that even if the Spirit Tree wanted to tell them, it was unlikely that the Principle of Causality would let it do so. The world had its own rules, and even if it was the Spirit Tree, it would also be restrained by the rules.

Jun Wu Xie drew in a deep breath. The Spirit tree had given them some hints, and for the rest, they needed to figure it out themselves.

“The Spirit Tree has mentioned that the enemy of the Soul World have not left yet. I don’t think it is talking about those spirit envoys who has betrayed the Soul World. Does this mean that... there are the people from the Upper Realm staying in the Soul World?” Jun Wu Xie was thinking about the words that were said by the Spirit Tree just now. She had no time to think about the others in detail, but the matter related to the Soul World was her first priority.

After the Contemporaneous Knot was removed from the Spirit Tree, those spirit envoys who had turned their backs on the Soul World could no longer pose any threats to them. Without Meng Qiu, they were just a plate of loose sand. The kind of enemy that was able to let the Spirit Tree to specially warn them definitely wouldn’t be those spirit envoys in the Soul World.

“Before this, I’d been feeling that the way the Upper Realm took their actions was very weird. Why would they want to take the Soul World under their control? But I think I’ve roughly understood it now.” The pair of Jun Wu Xie’s eyes slightly narrowed.

The Spirit Tree had mentioned that in order to conduct the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, besides building the array, there was a second way to hold the event, which was sacrificing 999,000 souls, and use the energy produced from the sacrifices to sheathe the entire Three Realms. As long as Jun Wu Yao and the soul bone were still in the Three Realms, the souls that were sacrificed in the Soul Sacrificing Event would then form an array that was able to swathe everything up, and the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realm could still be carried out!

This was also the reason why the Upper Realm must take over the Soul World. Only the Soul World was able to supply such a large amount of souls.

If it wasn’t for Jun Wu Xie visiting the Soul World in the purpose of looking for the souls of her father, her Master and her Grandmaster, and if it wasn’t for Jun Wu Yao coming to the Soul World in order to find the solution to resolve Jun Wu Xie’s chaotic energy, perhaps they wouldn’t have come to the Soul World in such a short time, and they also wouldn’t have figured out the surreptitious plan of the Upper Realm.

It was most likely that all the plans that the Upper Realm had carried out for the Blood Sacrifice Array were just the camouflage they projected on the surface, whereas under the ground, they had actually prepared another method, which was using the soul entities in the Soul World to pave another road for them to crash the void apart!
