Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Han Shu was breathing hard with anger. In the past, Han Zi Fei would never have said such things, no matter how unhappy she was, it was as if Han Zi Fei had never noticed!

As it turned out, it wasn’t that she was unaware, it was just that she had never said anything about it...

“Alright, you’ve glared at me for several days now. You better glare more at me, once I am married, you can only glare at my portrait.” Han Zi Fei smiled and picked up the book she had left aside, holding it with one hand as her attention returned to reading.

Looking at Han Zi Fei’s indifferent face, Han Shu’s heart was burning up as if it was being baked by fire!

She stood up from her chair seemingly spooked, looked at Han Zi Fei and said, “I forgot to tell you that tonight’s guest is my future husband, and the bearer of the second pair of dual Spirit Rings in the Upper Realm! I’m not sure, when compared with Lord Gu, who is more powerful.”

Han Zi Fei looked up slightly, with a hint of wonder in her eyes.

How could there be dual Spirit Rings?

Han Shu looked at Han Zi Fei’s surprised look with satisfaction and smirked proudly: “So tonight I still have to trouble Sacred Maiden to entertain my future husband.”

Han Zi Fei looked at Han Shu but did not speak.

Her silence greatly satisfied Han Shu.

“Well, Elder told me to pass the message, and I have already done so. I shall not stay any longer, and take my leave now.” Han Shu turned away and left with pride. In the moment she turned around, her eyes were full of intense unwillingness and ambition.

She would not lose every single time to Han Zi Fei. This time, she must win. Whatever the case, she must win the heart of the Lord of Sea Spirit City!

Han Zi Fei looked at the departing posturing of Han Shu, the surprise on her face slowly disappeared, as well as the cynicism between her brows. She put down the book in her hand and frowned while thinking.

“The dual Spirit Rings exponent... Han Shu...” Han Zi Fei had a feeling that something was wrong, but she couldn’t pinpoint what it was. She thought for a long time but got up suddenly and walked towards the bookshelf. She flipped open several ancient books to check something but after searching for a long time, there appeared to be no result.

Eventually, she sat back but the urgency in her grew stronger.

She didn’t have time to bother about others...

No matter who the dual Spirit Rings exponent was, it was not something she could interfere with.

With the sunset, the moonlight shrouded the entire Holy Mountain. As the moonlight shone down on the white snow, the snow reflected the moonlight and it looked extra bright, though much milder than the sun.

Upon Duan Qi’s return, she had ordered the tribe to set up a banquet, and all members of the tribe immediately executed that order. At night, the banquet had already been readied in the big hall of the Sacred Maiden Tribe and awaited for the event to begin.

Duan Qi wanted to avoid mistakes from arising and thus, Elder Yun and her came to supervise the undergoings earlier in the day. Checking over everything repeatedly till they were satisfied with things.

“The time is approaching, do you need to send someone to invite City Lord Yan to come to the hall?” Elder Yun looked at the time and asked.

Duan Qi shook her head: “Yan Hai’s character is elusive. As he had promised, I think he will arrive to the appointment on time. Let’s wait a moment more.” She looked around.

In addition to the few main positions, more than twenty seats had been arranged in the hall, and the beautiful women of the tribe had been seated during this time.
