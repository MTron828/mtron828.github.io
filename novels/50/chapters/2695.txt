Zheng Weilong’s speculation not only surprised her, but even Ah Da was shocked!

Ah Da looked at Zheng Weilong, who was shocked, but he already believed her speculation.

Zheng Weilong was the lowest rubbish in the Upper Realm. Even if she was facing the aura of the mistress of the Discerning Moon City, she still received respect and favour. However, when her innate talent for spiritual cultivation was removed, she was given another specialty, wisdom.

Zheng Weilong’s cleverness surpassed everyone that Ah Da had ever seen. If it wasn’t because she was born without the ability to cultivate spiritual power, with her wisdom, combined with a good innate ability, even the current Discerning Moon City Lord would not be able to hold her back.

“Miss, do you mean ... the change in Sea Spirit City was because there is a formula that can enhance one’s spirit power?” Ah Da asked in surprise.

Zheng Weilong frowned, “According to the current clues, this should be the case. Did you not notice that the mood of the people in the Sea Spirit City is a bit strange? The reason why Sea Spirit City is reduced to its current state is tied in with the weakness of its city dwellers. Although I have no spiritual power, and I can’t sense their strength, but after we entered the city, based on the behaviour of those people we have seen, they did not seem like those who have low powers. In fact ... I have a feeling that the strength of these people in Sea Spirit City are likely to be higher than Long Xuan City, moreover, it can be comparable to Discerning Moon City.”

Zheng Weilong’s analysis hit the main points, and despite having few clues in this situation, she had completely discerned the situation created by Jun Wu Xie.

When Ah Da heard Zheng Weilong say this, he suddenly remembered that almost none of the Sea Spirit City people they saw when they entered the city was at a level lower than Gold Spirit.

Although they didn’t see many people, this probability was already amazing!

“So it is no wonder that Yan Hai can be so calm when facing the threat of Ruan Zhongshan. As it turns out that he already has such a big gambling chip in his hands.” Ah Da recalled Jun Wu Xie’s calmness and arrogance. At first, he thought that Jun Wu Xie was young and had no sense of propriety but now it seemed that it was not the case.

“Something’s wrong.” Zheng Weilong suddenly changed the direction of the discussion. “Although the strength of Sea Spirit City has improved, Ruan Zhongshan came this time alone to find trouble, and because of his overconfidence, he did not bring enough men. To repel Long Xuan City, the best solution is for Yan Hai to kill Ruan Zhongshan in the City Lord’s manor. Once Ruan Zhongshan dies in the hands of Yan Hai, then the soldiers of Long Xuan City will have no leader, and no more combat prowess. But ... Why did Yan Hai give up such a great opportunity? Since he has the confidence to repel Long Xuan City, why didn’t he make the first move? Instead, he gave Ruan Zhongshan a chance to attack?”

A huge knot lingered in Zheng Weilong’s heart. She could not fully read Jun Wu Xie’s approach clearly. Vaguely, she felt that she must be missing something.

“Maybe the kid is too confident. After all, he is young, and even if he is astute, he won’t be able to cover everything. The young are full of vigor. He holds the gambling chips in his own hands, so he may be so careless.” Ah Da guessed.

“Is that so?” Zheng Weilong’s brows did not relax, she had an inkling that things were not as simple as Ah Da said.

Sea Spirit City’s actions during this time were slightly high-profile. Was this because of Jun Wu Xie’s youthful arrogance or something else?
