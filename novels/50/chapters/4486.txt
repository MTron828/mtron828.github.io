Chapter 3082 Seizing Everything 3

However, such a subtle move had struck Jun Wu Xie’s heart inch by inch. Jun Wu Xie’s gaze followed the ball of light.

“It’s still small and not fully formed, but this one is my favorite. It is bright and warm, full of happiness and glory. When I first took it out of its owner’s soul, I’m curious, time has such a firm but warm power. I saw a lot of interesting things in its memory ... Do you want to know? “The God of Destruction’s lips slightly raised. His eyes were not looking at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie was almost a step forward subconsciously, but fortunately Jun Wu Yao pulled her wrist in time.

And Jun Wu Xie’s slight anomaly did not escape the eyes of God of Destruction. The smile on his eyes became more intense.

“This memory is very beautiful, a happy family, a brother who loves, and a woman who sticks to the glory and the country, guards the beloved woman, and the child who was just born ... really ... very happy ... and died obviously. It was as tragic as it was, but after death, there was no bit of resentment, only warmth and a touch of regret ... “The God of Destruction squinted.

“Unfortunately, his survival time is too short, and his memory is too short. I don’t see much. I just know that the woman in his memory ... is exactly the same person who fled ... What makes me more interested is after years of being the Knight of Destruction, there will actually be a person from the Lower Realm who dares to provoke the Upper Realm, a ... a woman with the same name as his newly born daughter ...

“You are a God, you can see all this.” Jun Wu Yao took Jun Wu Xie’s hand and felt Jun Wu Xie’s tension at the moment. She cared about her family beyond everything. Taking care of things, it had become difficult for Jun Wu Xie to maintain absolute calmness.

The God of Destruction shook his head.

“I am God, but I will not waste energy on the humble ones from the Lower Realms, and ... God is not omnipotent, otherwise, why do I want to break the void, I know that there will be someone coming, just an accidental discovery “This person turned out to be my knight and the defector’s daughter, which really surprised me.”

“What did you take away from my father!” Jun Wu Xie said coldly, as if her voice could condense into ice in the next second.

The God of Destruction chuckled: “His memory, and ... his persistence. But unfortunately, when Han Zi Fei came back and insisted on marrying him, I knew that Han Zi Fei should have noticed. But I don’t care, because only their presence will make you appear faster, and now it seems that I placed a good bet, right? ”

“My father is still alive, you can’t manipulate him with this kind of thing.” Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath and forced herself to calm down.

“Oh? Really?” God of Destruction chuckled. He suddenly raised his hands and patted his palms.

The back door of the temple was suddenly opened, and a group of soldiers strode into the temple with strides, and among the soldiers, they dragged two people in shackles.

When Jun Wu Xie’s eyes touched the two figures, the killing intention in her eyes rose to a critical point in an instant!
