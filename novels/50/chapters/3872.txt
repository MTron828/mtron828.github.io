Chapter 2468: Relapse (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Yao walked towards the bed and looked at the virgin blood on the bed sheet, the smile in his eyes thickened. He took a glance over the door which was tightly shut before he suddenly swung his arms and pulled the bed sheet down from the bed. He then kept the bed sheet into his Cosmos Sack nimbly.

The black cat that was lying in the corner, pretending to be dead all the time had witnessed someone’s extremely childish behaviour, but it could only continue to pretend to sleep, not having the guts to make a sound due to his powerfulness.

Even a bed sheet with virgin blood on it was being kept like a treasure, did the Night Regime and the Ghost Army know that you were this childish!!

Sitting on a chair while waiting for Jun Wu Xie, at this moment, Jun Wu Yao was indescribably happy.

However...

A vigorous sound suddenly came from the bathroom.

It was almost in an instant, the black cat that was originally lying on the ground rushed towards the bathroom with a swoosh while Jun Wu Yao’s figure turned into a light beam and dashed into the bathroom.

Inside the bathroom, the big bathtub fell onto the ground with warm water which was still giving off steam flowing all over the floor. Wrapped in a garment, Jun Wu Xie was lying on the ground with a complete paleness on her face. All her muscles tightened up and her whole body was trembling in pain. The blue veins popped up from her skin, spreading across her entire body. They looked exceedingly harsh against her white skin.

It was as if Jun Wu Yao’s chest was heavily punched by somebody, even his breathing seemed to be stopping at the moment. He walked swiftly towards Jun Wu Xie and carried her in his arms.

During the time, Jun Wu Xie’s teeth was biting on her lower lip to the point that it almost bled with her eyes tightly closed, forcing herself to endure the acute pain.

“Little Xie?” With his eyes widened, panic had occupied the entire space of his heart at this moment.

Decisively, the black cat jumped to aside. The moment it saw Jun Wu Xie’s condition, it then knew that... Jun Wu Xie had once again relapsed.

Since when she returned from the Spirit World, Jun Wu Xie hadn’t been suffering a relapse for quite some time. The chaotic energy inside Jun Wu Xie’s body was well suppressed by the treatment of the Spirit Lord. Although it couldn’t be cured, the treatment was still very effective. The black cat had never thought that Jun Wu Xie would now encounter a recurrence again!

Worse, Qin Song and Long Jiu had already returned to the Soul World and now, no one else was able to control Jun Wu Xie’s energy.

“What the hell is going on!” Jun Wu Yao raised his head all of a sudden and looked at the black cat that was being dumbfounded by the scene.

Since the black cat and Jun Wu Xie shared the same body, only it knew what had happened to Jun Wu Xie.

Without further delay, the black cat immediately told him about the forceful methods used by Jun Wu Xie during her cultivation.

Upon hearing it, the colour on Jun Wu Yao’s face was gone in a second.

He wouldn’t have thought that the invincible power of Jun Wu Xie was actually an exchange of her own life.

It seemed like his throat was being choked by someone’s hands, it was so painful that he couldn’t even breathe. Jun Wu Yao had never been feeling so regret of the plan he made that day like the way he did today.

“The people from the Soul World have already gone back. Let’s go to the Spirit World, the Spirit Lord might have ways to handle it!” said the black cat anxiously.

Jun Wu Yao didn’t speak a word. His chest felt so painful to the extent that he was going to suffocate. He stretched his hand out and placed it in front of Jun Wu Xie’s chest with an extremely serious expression on his face.

A cloud of black mist spread out from Jun Wu Yao’s palm. The dark spirit didn’t flow into Jun Wu Xie’s body but rotated anticlockwise around Jun Wu Yao’s hand. The hand which was surrounded by the black dark spirit showed a translucent state in front of the black cat. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

With just a look, it actually had no any difference from those souls!

The black cat widened its eyes unbelievably. As the black mist slowly moved up, wherever it passed by, the skin and flesh of Jun Wu Xie had become the same as a soul, illusory and unreal.
