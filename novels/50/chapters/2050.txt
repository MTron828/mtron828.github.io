“I believe, that all of you here have a certain understanding about the Serene Spirit Towers already, and you should be able to judge whether there is truth in what I am saying.” Wu Jiu said.

Flame Dragon and the others naturally knew that what Wu Jiu had said was the truth, but they had not thought that Wu Jiu would so readily admit the harm the Serene Spirit Towers could bring to the other spirit races. Such candidness was completely unlike Wu Jiu’s personality.

With such an attitude, it only made Flame Dragon and the others even more wary.

Wu Jiu seemed to have felt the bias Flame Dragon and the others were feeling against him and he went on to say helplessly: “For sure, I, Wu Jiu, am not considered to be all that good a person, and am not someone so benevolent that would give up the Serene Spirit Tower just like that. Let me be honest here then. Building this fourth Serene Spirit Tower was not my idea but the Spirit Lord’s.”

“The Spirit Lord?” Flame Dragon was slightly startled.

Wu Jiu nodded his head and said: “The three Serene Spirit Towers from before were experiments the Spirit Lord wanted me to carry out, and he allowed me to let them be used only by human spirits. After going through the trials for so long, the Spirit Lord felt that the Serene Spirit Towers could be used to cultivate our power of the spirit, and hence, he got me to quickly build more Serene Spirit Towers to provide them for the other spirit races.” As he spoke, the corners of Wu Jiu’s mouth curled up with an impatient sneer. “Otherwise, do all of you really think that I will give up this Serene Spirit Tower I have developed over to you so willingly? That is something that we human spirits had painstakingly built little by little and what what has any of you contributed that after it has been built, it has to be given up over to you?”

Wu Jiu’s words caused Flame Dragon and Soul Slayer to be quake slightly in shock. Wu Jiu’s sincere demeanor before had not moved them but had instead put them on their guard and when Wu Jiu was using such a indignant tone without a care with demeaning words, they had instead found it easier to believe him.

Afterall, based on their understanding of Wu Jiu, he was not a generous person and he was one that would never give up the Serene Spirit Tower for no good reason, so they would never just accept it so readily no matter what.

“Now that the fourth Serene Spirit Tower has already been built, we will only need to ascertain the spirit race’s method of cultivation to carry out the final adjustments and it can then immediately be put to use. Seeing that all of you are being so terrified and worried, you can very well just go seek affirmation from the Spirit Lord. Although I am not exactly pleased with the decision that the Spirit Lord has made, but as a vassal under the Spirit Lord, I would naturally abide by the order given to me. You might not want to believe my words, then you can just go seek affirmation yourselves.” Wu Jiu said calm and unruffled with his arms crossed over his chest, a sneering smirk upon his effeminate face, a completely different person from the earnest and sincere one seen just moments ago.

Wu Jiu’s completely disparate demeanor made Flame Dragon and Soul Slayer a little confused. They were not able to determine whether Wu Jiu’s words were the truth or a lie.

“I will verify it with the Spirit Lord, to see whether you speak the truth. And if you dare to try to deceive me, I will have you know the price you will have to pay for it.” Soul Slayer released a humming resonance, the tone highly threatening.

Wu Jiu shrugged his shoulders.

“As you please.”

Poison Ivy had not once opened his mouth throughout, but merely sat on his chair of vines as he looked at Wu Jiu, his eyes not missing the slightest change that came over Wu Jiu’s face.

“If that is all that you want to ask me here today, then I have already finished saying all there is to say. The construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower has completed and after you decide which spirit race will be using it, just inform me directly and I will make the final preparations for it. So, if there is nothing else, then I shall take my leave.” Wu Jiu concluded up his speech, and made to take his leave. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Since Flame Dragon’s question had been answered, there was naturally no reason for Wu Jiu to remain there any longer.
