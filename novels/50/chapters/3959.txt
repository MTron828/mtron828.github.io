Jun Wu Yao smiled, “Things might not be as awful as the way you think it is. As you said, there are two spirit envoys who have already known about it and have already returned to the Soul World. There might be a solution to solve the problem. In the Soul World, there are still many soul entities who are loyal to the Spirit Tree. Before this, let’s find the Spirit Tree to settle the soul power in your body first.”

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and looked at Jun Wu Xie without subsiding the perplexity in her eyes.

“How did you take the seed away at that time?”

Jun Wu Yao was stunned for a moment. With a weird look in his eyes, he let out a slight cough and said, “During the previous time, I had quite a good relationship with the Spirit Tree. Although it couldn’t speak, it was a nice friend to get along with. I thought that its seed was interesting, plus it looked pretty, so I just simply took it.”

“...” Jun Wu Xie was lost for words. The Spirit Tree was the only “friend” that Jun Wu Yao was willing to interact with, but he, on the other hand, instead of doing something nice, he just simply took its seed away just because he felt that the seed was interesting and pretty? If the Spirit Tree was able to talk, it might have already cursed and sworn at Jun Wu Yao for a hundred or a thousand times.

There was a rare awkwardness shown on Jun Wu Yao’s face. Since he had no interest in the sycophancy and the mutual deceptions of the Upper Realm, the quietude of the Spirit Tree had become a nice companion for him. At that time, he often went to the Soul World to stay there for a few days, and if that person’s plan had not been discovered by him, there wouldn’t be any change in the habit.

Instead of saying that Jun Wu Yao was captivated by the seed, it was better to say that he was just fooling around with the Spirit Tree. After all, the seed brought no benefits to him. It just happened to have some healing effects on Jun Wu Xie’s soul, causing its ability to finally obtain its place to shine, or else it would just be the same as those useless treasures which he collected plainly for aesthetic purposes.

Jun Wu Yao walked into the Soul World with Jun Wu Xie. The surroundings were beautiful and alluring, it gave one an illusion of standing in the Three Realm.

Both of them walked side by side. Suddenly, Jun Wu Yao’s steps halted.

Jun Wu Xie too, stopped her steps as she looked at Jun Wu Yao in confusion. Just as the moment when she was about to say something, Jun Wu Yao gestured her to stay quiet and led her to behind a tree.

Between the mountains not far away from them, a group of soul entities suddenly appeared on a tortuous path.

But their appearance had aroused the vigilance of Jun Wu Xie!

There were a few soul entities dragging a very long chain with weapons holding in their hands. More than twenty miserable-looking soul entities were tied up in the hands by the chain, moving forward while being dragged along the path!

The crisp clinking sound echoed in the quiet mountains. The faces of those soul entities who had gotten their freedom restricted were full of wrath, but they could only suppress it and glared at those soul entities who were supervising them with their raging gazes.

“What the hell are you guys looking at? If you don’t stay still and behave well, you are the one to suffer the pain.” The one spirit entity that was holding his weapon in his hand seemed to have a burly stature. He raised his brows while looking at those people who were being restrained with a disdain sneer on his face. While speaking, he slightly pulled open the lower hem of his coat, exposing the long whip that was being coiled up, buckled on his belt.

It was an eccentric long whip where there were peculiar runes all over its body.

The moment those aggrieved soul entities saw the long whip, all their faces immediately went pale.

There weren’t many things in the world that were able to hurt the spirit. Besides the soul power, some of the artifacts that were engraved with runes or spells were able to do so, and that long whip was one of it.
