Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Long Yao was preparing to take action but Jun Wu XIe let go of Bai Zhu. Bai Zhu fell to the floor, his legs too weak to support his weight, the colour had been drained from his face and his air of elegance had been replaced with a sense of hopelessness.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the furious Long Yao and raised her hands, “Please don’t worry Lord Long Yao. I definitely wouldn’t taint this place.” She had on a smug smile that was taunting him at the same time. For some reason, that made her gentle features emit a bewitching radiance, making it impossible to look away.

“What did you give him?” Long Yao stared at her and asked.

Jun Wu Xie did not respond immediately. Her murderous, yet smiling eyes scanned the back room full of the Top Ten masters and finally rested on the heavily bandaged Fang Jinghe.

[“Little...Little Ruo...is gone...she’s gone...”]

[“Little Xie, please....find Little Ruo...”]

In that instant, Jun Wu Xie’s mind was filled with Fei Yan’s cries for help. The night before, she personally went to the place that Fei Yan and Rong Ruo were attacked. What was originally a busy street was no longer and was filled with the putrid stench of blood. Nobody dared step onto the street which in the dead of night, was completely silent.

Jun Wu Xie would never forget seeing a butterfly caked in blood bathed in the moonlight while standing on that street

It was so beautiful, yet so tragic.

Jun Wu Xie’s expression deepened, it was as if Rong Ruo’s every smile and action was being played in front of her eyes.

She recalled, at Cloudy Brook Academy, the gentle and carefree youth that she was stood at the doorway and said with a smile,

[“This must be the new friend that Brother Hua and the rest brough back.”]

[“My name is Rong Ruo, I overheard Qiao Chu call you Little Xie. Do you mind if I call you that as well?”]

She especially remembered that no matter how tough the circumstances, Rong Ruo always had a smile on her face that was as gentle as water.

Jun Wu Xie always thought that Rong Ruo had a beautiful smile. Neither gentle like a lady’s nor steely like a man’s but the type that gave an all encompassing warmth.

But... UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

That smile would never be seen again.

Her heart ached as if someone had dug out a piece of her heart and left a gaping void.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes slowly regained focus. The bottom of her eyes reflected Fang Jinghe’s panic-stricken face. His reflection seemed to burn up in the eyes of Jun Wu Xie.

Fang Jinghe got a fright when Jun Wu Xie looked at him, and his face turned a whiter shade of pale.

He automatically started moving towards the back to hide but Jun Wu Xie’s icy gaze cut through the crowd, giving him no place to hide.

“According to rumours.” Jun Wu Xie said slowly.

“Among the Top Ten masters, one of you is an expert in poison. In that case, I invite Lord Long Yao to get that person to examine Bai Zhu and diagnose what poison I’ve administered to Bai Zhu. If the diagnosis is correct, I will gladly handover the antidote and you will never hear from me again.”

Long Yao was rocked by this statement, Jun Wu Xie was obviously referring to Fang Jinghe!

And Fang Jinghe was the only one who managed to kill one of Jun Wu Xie’s companions in the previous operation.

What did Jun Wu Xie hope to achieve by doing this?
