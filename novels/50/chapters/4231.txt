That face with that pair of beautiful eyes were so familiar that they made Han Zi Fei’s eyes tremble slightly.

WHowever when Jun Wu Xie and Han Zi Fei had eye contact, her gaze was so calm. She nodded at Han Zi Fei and said: “Good to see you Sacred Maiden, I am Yan Hai.”

Han Zi Fei stared at Jun Wu Xie in a daze. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

That silence made Duan Qi feel a little strange. She turned to look at Han Zi Fei in an enquiring gaze.

Of course ...

“It turns out that you are the distinguished guest of my tribe, you are surprisingly young.” Han Zi Fei’s smile bloomed again, raising her eyebrows slightly, but showing a slight disapproval.

Duan Qi frowned slightly. Apparently she didn’t like the way Han Zi Fei spoke, but she didn’t say anything. Today, she invited Han Zi Fei to come over to make an appearance. Han Zi Fei would marry Jun Gu in a few days. Her fate with the Sacred Maiden Tribe would basically end soon.

Now Duan Qi was more concerned about Jun Wu Xie.

Han Zi Fei glanced at Jun Wu Xie before she looked at Duan Qi with interest.

“The message that the two elders brought made me full of expectations, but I didn’t expect ...” Her tone was filled with hidden meaning.

Han Shu who was standing by the side had turned even stiffer. Even a fool could tell that Han Zi Fei’s attitude toward Jun Wu Xie was quite unkind, filled with contempt. This made her want to suppress Han Zi Fei by using Jun Wu Xie. Han Shu could not bear it further. She immediately said, “Sacred Maiden, you made an indiscreet remark. Although Lord Yan is young, other than the Lord, who else can be a Dual Spirit Ring exponent? Sacred Maiden should not judge one’s strength by his age.”

Having said that, Han Shu did not look back at Jun Wu Xie. She pretended that she is fighting injustice for Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie did not respond, and remained indifferent.

Han Zi Fei chuckled and said, “Oh? As Han Shu said, that’s an incredible young man. It’s my fault. Let me toast to you.”

Nonsense, how could my daughter be comparable?

Han Zi Fei’s face remained calm. When she raised her glass to toast, she caught a glimpse of Jun Wu Xie who held a wine cup in her hand. She then put her own wine cup down and picked up a cup of tea instead.

“But I am unable to drink too much, I can only substitute tea for wine. I would like to seek your understanding.” Han Zi Fei laughed and said.

Han Shu stared at Han Zi Fei, she didn’t want Han Zi Fei to underestimate Jun Wu Xie. However, at the same time, she didn’t want Han Zi Fei to pay too much attention to Jun Wu Xie as well, her heart was in conflict.

Jun Wu Xie saw that Han Zi Fei replaced wine with tea, as a smile flashed past her eyes and picked up the tea on the side and held it up, “Sacred Maiden, it’s so polite of you.”

Two of them drank a cup of tea in front of the whole group of maidens, drinking slowly and elegantly. But they did not know that many people’s eyes were ignited with flame.

Han Shu sat in her seat and looked at Jun Wu Xie casually drinking her tea. The only thing that she was short of doing was tearing her own sleeves in anger. She suppressed the anger within and took the initiative to step forward to toast and apologise to Jun Wu Xie. Not only did she not respond to Han Shu, Jun Wu Xie did not speak a word to her.

Han Zi Fei was very rude to Jun Wu Xie. Even though her apology was insincere and she replaced tea with wine, Jun Wu Xie actually accepted it!

At this moment, Han Shu’s hatred towards Han Zi Fei seeped deep into her bones. She could not wait to pounce on her and tear up her beautiful face!
