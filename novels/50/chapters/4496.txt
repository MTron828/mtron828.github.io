3092 Of Dreams And Illusions 1

The God of Destruction was in no rush to kill the three of them, he wanted them to experience the pain of almost dying again and again.

When Qiao Chu and the rest were unable to move anymore, the God of Destruction stood in the pool of blood that surrounded them and looked on proudly. More than half the bones in their bodies were broken and they had suffered massive internal injuries. They did not even have the strength to lift a finger.

But they were still staring defiantly at the God of Destruction, as if they wanted to tear him limb from limb.

“There’s no need to look at me like that. I’ve been kind enough not to kill you as I easily could have but I’ve let you live. Don’t worry, you won’t get off that easily. Since you were willing to sacrifice yourselves to protect Jun Wu Xie, you must be quite important to her. So after I capture her again, I’ll kill you slowly in front of her very eyes.” the God of Destruction laughed, exhibiting all his evil and sinister traits.

Qiao Chu and the rest were lying in the pool of blood unable to move but would have given anything to be able to pounce on the God of Destruction and kill him!

However in their current state, they did not even have the strength to end their own lives, much less kill the God of Destruction. They finally understood why he had let them live, it was not because he could not kill them but because he had decided it was not time yet....

The God of Destruction walked out of the hall, not once looking back at them....

Fei Yan had carried Jun Wu Xie away in a mad sprint resulting in some of the bandages on his face coming loose in the wind and pockets of unhealed wounds oozing puss could be seen.

As he ran, the wind felt like a million little knives stabbing his face at once. But he did not dare to stop and look back in the direction he was running from.

“LIttle Xie...you must hold on...” Fei Yan’s voice was hoarse from the wind and he could not see. Fortunately, in absorbing the Spiritual Ring, his spiritual sense had increased greatly and could sense changes in the atmospheric pressure around him so could navigate without needing to see.

Jun Wu Xie was silent, as if she had gone to sleep.

Fei Yan could not see what Jun Wu Xie looked like at that moment. If he could, he would have been stunned. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were open and her golden eyes were as brilliant as the sun but.....there seemed to be a fog that was covering her eyes, blocking their radiance.

Her eyes were duller than those of the blind Fei Yan.

Jun Wu Xie could not see and could not hear. She had no way of knowing what was happening around her.

At the moment when Jun Wu Yao self exploded, Jun Wu Xie’s entire spirit seemed to collapse instantly, and when the power floating in the hall continued to flow into Jun Wu Xie’s soul, her consciousness was instantly lost in a strange illusion ...

So she had no idea that Qiao Chu and the rest had rushed to the hall and what had happened after they arrived.

All her consciousness had been lost in that mist.

In the mist, she vaguely saw a familiar figure ...
