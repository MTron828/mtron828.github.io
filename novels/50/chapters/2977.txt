Chapter 2978 The Lord

This news spread quickly in the Sacred City. His Lord heard about it.

In the hall, Long Yao knelt down on the cold marble floor with one knee. His stoic face had already been drained of blood as beads of cold sweat trickled down his forehead, slipping down his cheek.

In the hall, Jun Gu and the other two men stood on either side of the hall. The people who called them up today were sitting high and upright.

“I heard that while the selection is still going on, I have already lost five of the Top Ten Experts? Long Yao, you really surprised me.” The sound of indescribable emotions rang in the hall. It’s not loud, but it fell into the ears of other people in the hall. It felt like a heavy hammer, and his heart was tingling.

“I did not do well, please ... please ... ... punish me My Lord ...” Long Yao who was currently kneeling had lost his former arrogance. He was trembling and his eyes only dared to stare at the ground before him.

“Punish? When did I say that I should punish you? Since the selection is not over yet, go ahead and fill in the missing five again.” The man’s voice sounded again. The cruelty in it was not alleviated in the slightest.

The Top Ten Experts, in his eyes, were like a group of captive dogs. Even if they died, there would not be anger, regret, or even a sigh.

“Yes ...” Long Yao did not relax at all.

“Have you met that Yan Hai?” His Lord asked again.

Long Yao said: “I’ve seen him.”

“He really is a Dual Spirit Ring Exponent?”

“Yes.”

“Oh? That is a talent.” There was a faint smile in the solemn face of His Lord.

Jun Gu was standing in the hall. He couldn’t move his eyes. But the corners of his eyes drifted towards the man sitting in the upper position without trace.

In a crescent-white gown, the handsome cheeks looked impeccable, making it impossible to find traces of time. The corner of the man’s mouth seemed to have a mild smile. But for some reason, people didn’t feel the slightest warmth from his smile.

The handsome man was the dictator of the Three Realms. He was called His Lord.

It was also among the Three Realms that the first strong man with a Dual Spirit Ring controlled the most powerful force in this world.

“Jun Gu.” The Lord suddenly said.

“Yes my lord.” Jun Gu calmly stepped forward, kneeling in the hall on one knee.

“Did you ever see Ying’er when you returned from the Holy Mountain?” His Lord smiled with one hand on his chin.

“My Lord, I was in a rush at that time and I did not see Highness Ying.” Jun Gu said.

“Oh. Send someone today to go to the Holy Mountain and ask him to return to the city immediately.” His Lord said.

“Yes.” Jun Gu did not understand why His Lord suddenly wanted to call back Gu Ying. But he appeared obedient.

“Well, it’s not early anymore, the four of you shall step down first. Oh, yes, regarding that Yan Hai, with his strength, it will be a bit of a curse, Chi Yan.” His Lord seemed to have thought of something.

“Yes my lord.” The Knight of Destruction named Chi Yan stepped forward.

“Help me entertain this interesting guest.”

“Yes,” Chi Yan said.

Jun Gu secretly listened to His Lord’s words. His heart was incomprehensible. He did not believe that His Lord knew about Jun Wu Xie’s Dual Spirit Ring from the first day. But why did he suddenly change the way he treated it?
