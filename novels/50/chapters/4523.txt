Chapter 3119 Xiao Xie 3

Shen Yan Xiao stared at the man behind Jun Wu Xie in disbelief, after all those years, those unmistakable purple eyes still haunted her like a nightmare!

Satan!

The Devil King who almost destroyed the world!

What was he doing there?

Instinctively, Shen Yan Xiao shielded Jun Wu Xie behind her own body and shouted to the crowd.

“Help me protect Little Wu Xie!”

The man she was referring to was tall and handsome. His eyes exuded a coldness that only seemed to dissipate when he looked at her.

Di Xiu looked helplessly at the young girl who was pushed in front of him as well as his own feisty wife and suddenly had a headache.

“Satan, you haven’t been destroyed!” Shen Yan Xiao narrowed her eyes as she prepared to use all her power in battle.

Jun Wu Yao looked on in surprise at the woman who was being so hostile towards him, he felt like he had seen her and the people behind her in a dream once.

In that dream, it was this group of people that destroyed him.

However....

“I think you’ve got the wrong person.” Jun Wu Yao said with a laugh, the situation at hand was quite interesting.

“I wouldn’t be mistaken even if you were reduced to ashes!” Shen Yan Xiao retorted.

“Oh? Then maybe you should ask Little Xie who I am.” Jun Wu Yao said. If he did not know what Shen Yan Xiao meant to Jun Wu Xie or that she had once sacrificed her life to save her, he might not have had the patience to say all that to her.

Shen Yan Xiao narrowed her eyes once again and turned towards Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu XIe had a complicated expression on her face.

“Little Wu Xie, this is a bad guy and you should keep your distance from him.” Shen Yan Xiao said with great concern.

Jun Wu Xie’s expression grew even more complicated.

“But don’t worry, I won’t let him harm even a hair on your head.” Shen Yan Xiao continued sincerely.

“...” Jun Wu Xie’s brows were almost knotted.

Just as Shen Yan Xiao was preparing to find out from Jun Wu Xie what Satan was doing there and if he had caused any trouble, a soft and gentle voice suddenly rang out.

“Mother....” Jun Mo Ye, who had been sleeping, was awakened by the commotion and wandered into the courtyard and saw her mother.

“Mo...mother?” Shen Yan Xiao looked at the cute child then back at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

Shen Yan Xiao was speechless.

It was incomprehensible for her to think of Jun Wu Xie as a mother.

“Mother....hug...” Little Mo Ye paid no attention to the stranger in the courtyard and sleepily whined to her mother to pick her up. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie laughed and shook her head at her daughter.

Little Mo Ye was aggrieved at being refused by her mother and started bawling. As she looked around, she saw Jun Wu Yao and said pitifully, “Father...hug...”

“....” When Shen Yan Xiao heard the word “Father”, it was like she was struck by lightning and was rooted to the spot!
