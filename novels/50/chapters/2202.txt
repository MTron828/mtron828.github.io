Ba He could only watch the Spirit Jade Palace Lord getting closer and closer to him. Ah. How familiar he was with that golden light that shrouded the Spirit Jade Palace Lord, but he could no longer use it. For the first time ever, an overwhelming fear soared in Ba He’s heart and the original arrogance had completely disappeared without any trace left. His face had turned a pale shade of white and his body was extremely tensed.

Suddenly, he turned his head towards the elders from the Nine Temples who stood at the side.

“This bunch of wastes, don’t tell me that you intend to just watch this bunch of despicable things destroy our plans? Don’t forget that this matter was passed to the Nine Temples by the Lord. It is because of your incompetence that we were sent here to clean up your mess. If not for us, just based on the way you perform, I’m afraid that you have died a few hundred times already!” He had no other way out and he had to use the method he thought to be most shameful, one that he had disdained from the very beginning – to ask the Nine Temples to help.

The eyes of the elders changed slightly. In fact, they had long been disgusted with Ba He’s arrogance. The reason why they had not made any moves was not because they believed in his abilities because they could not bear to strike out against Jun Wu Xie and the rest.

Their conscience had been constantly pricking them and they could not move a single step forward.

“What are you still standing there in a daze for?! Hurry up and kill off this bunch of imbeciles! What a bunch of useless wastes!” Ba He bellowed out in rage.

The words that he had shouted out were full of insults and it caused the faces of many disciples of the Nine Temples to turn red in anger. Previously, Ba He kept saying that they were a group of dogs that were raised by the Upper Realm. Even now, even though he was asking for help, he still placed himself up high on the pedestal, remaining as arrogant as ever.

An elder of the Spirit Void Temple had on an upward expression, he did not care about Ba He’s life or death, however if the plan had failed, he was afraid of incurring the wrath of the Upper Realm. That was something that they could not afford.

“Spirit Void Temple disciples heed my orders.” That elder struggled with his words as he opened his mouth hesitantly. The moment he opened his mouth, all the Spirit Void Temple disciples looked at him incredulously.

They had been insulted to such a degree, in Ba He’s eyes they were not even comparable to humans. Each word that came out was either a dog, a waste, trash... Did their elder actually want them to help such a person?

That elder had been stared at with the shocked gaze from all around and his face had turned white. How could he not know what his disciples were thinking of in their hearts? Facing the shocked and resistant gazes, that elder attempted to continue his words, however it was as if there was something stuck in his throat. He clenched his fists tightly, trying to suppress something from within.

“What are you all still hesitating about! If we all die, you guys will not have a way to live either!” Ba He roared out in anger.

That Spirit Void Temple elder was stunned momentarily, just as he was about to continue his words, he felt a hand on his shoulder and it blocked the decision that he was about to blurt out. In confusion, he turned around but the decision that he had made had already made him sweat buckets and the pressure that he felt in his heart was overwhelming.

When he looked over, that elder realised that the person who had stopped him was actually Su Jing Yan!

“Elder Su?”

Su Jing Yan looked back at him innocently. Ba He could see everything clearly from where he stood. It was evident that the elder from the Spirit Void Temple looked apprehensive and was just about to give the orders to strike but he was suddenly interrupted by Su Jing Yan.

“Su Jing Yan, you ungrateful white eyed wolf, what do you want to do? Aren’t you afraid that the Heavenly Wolf Temple would not even have any bones left?” Ba He spat out maliciously.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
