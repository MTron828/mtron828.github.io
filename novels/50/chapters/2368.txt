Chapter 2369: A Shocking Conjecture (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Situ Heng clenched his pair of fists with a cold and gloomy look in his eyes. Both the idiots, Qin Song and Long Jiu, were keeping quiet because they were fooled by the little bitch, but even he himself too, was being fooled around. Jun Wu Xie kept on saying that she needed the power to avenge but she never mentioned who was her enemy. It was until when they were in the Spirit Palace, he found out that the one Jun Wu Xie wanted to take revenge on was actually the Upper Realm!

“You’re lucky this time since you escaped. But you are not going to be this lucky next time!” There was a trace of viciousness emerging from Situ Heng’s eyes. It wasn’t his real intention to agree in helping with Jun Wu Xie’s treatment. If there was any possibility, he earnestly hoped that Jun Wu Xie would die as early as possible. However, if he didn’t give any response, with the strength of the Spirit Lord and Qin Song, the treatment wasn’t completely impossible to carry on even without him.

Furthermore...

How could he just sit by and watch Jun Wu Xie getting better day by day?!

Unfortunately, since the Spirit Lord, Qin Song and Long Jiu were on the spot this time, he wasn’t able to use any overly intense tricks. He could only attack purely with his soul power and he didn’t even dare to do it too obvious, but...

For the next time, there wouldn’t be so many people in the underground palace! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

An evil smile bloomed on the edges of Situ Heng’s lips, making his face which was already dark and shady to be more savage.

...

When Jun Wu Xie returned from the Spirit Palace, the discomfort in her spirit had finally worn away. Before she had even reached the house, she saw a flashing light. The moment she took a closer look at it, she became so speechless.

The only thing she encountered was the scene of her spirit rings beating the daylights out of each other. Corpse Flower who had the most robust body looked miserable the most. His strong body was hanging upside down on a tree with a vine. With one of his legs tied up with the vine, he swung pathetically in the wind. His mouth was completely frozen under the crystal clear ice, looking so wronged like he was going to cry.

Below Corpse Flower, there was only the short stature of Little Lotus anxiously jumping up and down. His two short little fat legs were hopping here and there, trying to rescue Corpse Flower while Blood Velvet, Poison Ivy, Poppy and Crystal Orchid were standing steadily at the other side. Whereas for Qiao Chu and the others who were standing aside, they were being some onlookers and were trying hard not to laugh.

“What’s wrong?” Jun Wu Xie walked resignedly towards them. She had only left for six days, how could the six of them have already made such a fuss?

“Mistress!!” Once Little Lotus saw the figure of Jun Wu Xie, he immediately stepped out his short little legs and threw himself into Jun Wu Xie’s arms. His tears were dropping like a kite with broken string. The black cat was so used to it that it held a white porcelain bottle under the chin of Little Lotus with its tail to collect his tears...

“Waahhh... Mistress, save Little Taro!! They are bullying him,” complained Little Lotus while sniffling and crying to the point that he wasn’t able to breathe properly.

Jun Wu Xie raised her head and looked in the direction of the four spirit rings who seemed to be at leisure.

Smiling brightly, Blood Velvet waved his hands at Jun Wu Xie without feeling any guilt. Crystal Orchid looked away calmly while Poppy grinned wickedly. And for Poison Ivy, he was just frowning.

No matter how she observed, four of them had no regrets at all.

“Little Xie, you’re finally back! If you’re still not back, I think they are going to stew Corpse Flower!” Qiao Chu came forward.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Qiao Chu in confusion. “What the hell is going on?”

After taking a glance at Jun Wu Xie, Qiao Chu raised his finger and pointed at Corpse Flower who was hung in the air. “Well... I didn’t expect that your Corpse Flower would have this kind of hobby.”
