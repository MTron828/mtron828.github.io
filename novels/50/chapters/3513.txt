Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie woke up from her coma and beneath her, the floor was icy cold. Her head was throbbing with pain which caused her memory before she lost consciousness to become a fuzzy mess. She tried very hard to recall everything and suddenly remembered the scene where she stood against the Spirit Lord. Her brows creased together and she sat herself up, where she then heard a series of clear clinks.

Four lengths of Soul Binding Chains shackled her four limbs, with the other end all linking to the wall, restricting all her movements.

Jun Wu Xie froze slightly and then noticed that she was locked up in a dark and dank dungeon, her power of the spirit sealed up by the Soul Binding Chains, where she was unable to summon any of her powers.

“How is it? Are you satisfied with your current accommodations?” A taunting laugh sounded suddenly from inside the dungeon.

Jun Wu Xie lifted her head. It was not known from when the figure of Wu Jiu appeared outside the steel bars. All the wounds on his body had healed completely and upon that effeminate and handsome looking face, was a smile that sent a chill through people.

“How pitiful. Such a beautiful young lady and you’ve actually been locked up in this dark dungeon that doesn’t see the light of day. It’s truly..... such a pity.” Wu Jiu said as he looked at Jun Wu Xie smilingly. It was hard to imagine that he could actually recover so completely within such a short period of time.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and looked at Wu Jiu who was absolutely filled with glee. Without even giving it a thought, she knew she was brought in here after she fell unconscious. She was unable to summon up any power of the spirit and she could not even probe one’s spirit aura.

“Where are my companions?” Jun Wu Xie asked coldly. Qiao Chu and the others would have been imprisoned by the Spirit Lord like she was and since she was locked up in here, where would all of the others be?

The corners of Wu Jiu’s mouth carried the hint of a smile as he crouched, bringing himself down to Jun Wu Xie’s eye level.

“What if I told you that they are all dead?”

Jun Wu Xie’s gaze was suddenly overflowing with chilling murder, the thick murderous intent causing Wu Jiu’s eyes to widen. Immediately, he began to laugh even more gleefully.

“It was just a joke. With spirits who have reached the realm of Spirit Outflare, how could I possibly bear to kill them? Rest assured, they are all perfectly fine. Just like you, they have been locked up in other dungeons, and I will not harm them for now.”

“What are you going to?” Jun Wu Xie asked as she stared coldly at Wu Jiu. She did not believe for a moment that Wu Jiu would really be so kind as to want to spare them. Otherwise, the Spirit Lord would not have appeared, and they would not be imprisoned.

Wu Jiu smiled widely at Jun Wu Xie and replied: “What? Didn’t you want to save the Spiritual Bear? You know this as well. The Spiritual Bear is absolutely necessary for me to build the Serene Spirit Tower. But in order to make the Serene Spirit Tower more powerful, it is impossible to achieve with just one Spiritual Bear. I need more, more powerful spirits, and the lot of you, are the best sacrifices I am preparing to present to the Serene Spirit Towers.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wu Jiu’s eyes then flashed with a glint of lunacy.

“Just think about it. Six human spirits capable of Spirit Outflare, cleanly absorbed by Spirit Fire. What a wonderful thing that will be! With all of you being of such great use, how can I possibly bare to kill all of you? If all of you are to die, you can die after you have been sacrificed to the Serene Spirit Tower.”

“You lunatic. The Serene Spirit Tower does not elevate anyone’s cultivation at all. Everything that you are doing is merely just providing nourishment to feed the Spirit Fire on the twelfth level.” Jun Wu Xie continued to look icily at Wu Jiu to say.

Wu Jiu gave a light laugh and then replied: “You are rather smart. Everything you’ve just said is correct, but what can you do? Your words will not be believed by any spirit and you can’t even come out from this cell now. Does it even matter how much you know?”
