Chapter 2805: Rejection (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“To be so forgiving, City Lord Yan, it is really rare.” Duan Qi was satisfied with Jun Wu Xie’s answer. An exponent should have some confidence of his own.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes as she restrained the coldness in her eyes, and after a moment of silence, she said, “Since Elder Duan rarely visits Sea Spirit City, why not stay here for a few days?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie’s suggestion was exactly what Duan Qi wanted, and Duan Qi agreed without saying much more.

Duan Qi’s temperament was solemn, grave and rigid, while Jun Wu Xie was indifferent, therefore between the two, there was nothing much to converse. Very soon, Jun Wu Xie had asked the members of the Night Regime to arrange a place for this group of Sacred Maidens, while she left to hibernate.

After Duan Qi and others arrived at their assigned residence, they spent some moments sprucing it up. The accommodation arranged by the Night Regime was quiet and secluded. Duan Qi didn’t have much to say about it. But when Han Shu and others saw their rooms, their faces immediately turned down.

“Elder Duan, do we really have to stay here?” Han Shu asked, her face an unhealthy green colour. Although the accommodation arranged by the Night Regime was tidy and clean, compared to the accommodation they stayed in White Night city, it looked shabby. As they were already accustomed to the luxuriousness of White Night City, Han Shu and the other women were quite displeased with Jun Wu Xie’s arrangements.

“I think Yan Hai’s temperament is very strange. Although he had promised that he would forgive them, but the way he said it seemed otherwise. Also, he has no respect for Elder Duan! He arranged such a worn out place for Elder Duan to stay in!” Han Shu waved her hands in disgust. There was no beautiful scenery full of flowers and no flourish decorations. Everything here felt shabby to Han Shu.

As far as the first impression was concerned, Han Shu’s impression of Jun Wu Xie was extremely bad.

Except for the strength of the dual Spirit Rings, she could not find any positive aspects of Jun Wu Xie at all.

His appearance could only be considered as average, and his build was small and short, how strong would a person be then?

After seeing Jun Wu Xie, Han Shu began to miss her days spent in White Night City.

Duan Qi lifted her eyes as she swept her gaze past a very dissatisfied Han Shu, she frowned slightly but didn’t assign blame. She looked around the surroundings of the elegant and large house. Although this residence was not luxurious, it was still clean and large. The beds looked simple but the materials used were good.

All of these, Duan Qi could see clearly. But Han Shu and the others, with their limited experience, could not understand.

“You seem to be very dissatisfied with Yan Hai?” Duan Qi looked at Han Shu.

Han Shu pursed her lips, glanced away and muttered, “It’s not that I have any dissatisfaction, but that Yan Hai’s approach is problematic. Although we are here to be mediators for the 72 cities, in the Upper Realm, there is no one who wouldn’t give our Sacred Maiden Tribe some face. But this Yan Hai however, not only didn’t send any men to greet and welcome us, when he met with us, he displayed such eccentric behaviours. He has no manners in hospitality.”

As she was speaking, Han Shu’s gaze swept around the house and past the courtyard, and resignedly said, “Then there is still this accommodation, even if their Sea Spirit City is poor, they still didn’t have to give us such a shabby place to stay in, right?”

Han Shu, no matter which way she looked at it, felt that Sea Spirit City and Jun Wu Xie were not pleasing to her eyes. Her resistance was noticed by Duan Qi, and she couldn’t help but feel helpless.

The reason why Han Shu would reject Jun Wu Xie like this was due to Bai Zhu....
