Luo Qingcheng’s incredulous gaze fell onto the light sword that had pierced her arm. It was embedded deeply in her arm, she could no longer remember how many years has it been that she had been hurt.

After Jun Wu Yao had left the Upper Realm, Luo Qingcheng had became the strongest person after her Master. In the entire Upper Realm, there were countless strong contenders and she had also eradicated many eyesores for her Master. She had also fought against many single Spirit Ring Masters but those people could not even resist her attacks. She looked at them struggling futilely as she trampled on them one by one, step by step. From the beginning to the end, Luo Qingcheng had never received any injury... not even a little bruise.

Luo Qingcheng pursuit for perfection could not let her stand the slightest blemish on her body, let alone such a wound.

Never had she ever expected that a puny Silver Spirit from the Middle Realm would actually inflict a wound on her...

This... was a complete joke!

Luo Qingcheng stared at her wound for a long time. Just as she thought that she was about to fall into madness, she turned her gaze and stared at Jun Wu Xie who was lying in a pool of blood. The hate in her eyes was so intense that it was shocking.

“You can actually hurt me?!” Luo Qingcheng’s voice had changed, she refused to believe that she was hurt by a mere Silver Spirit.

Jun Wu Xie lay on the ground without moving as she stared into mid air when Luo Qingcheng started screaming out deliriously. Suddenly, her lips curled up into a faint and lazy smile, her blood red lips accentuated the mockery she held.

“I’ve hurt you, so? You...are not all that.”

“Shameless! Who do you think you are!” Luo Qingcheng had been completely enraged by Jun Wu Xie’s words. She pulled out the light sword and held it in her hands, the humiliation of being hurt by Jun Wu Xie made her tremble furiously.

Ren Huang was in the midst of battle had already witnessed the battle between Jun Wu Xie and Luo Qingcheng. According to his understanding of the strength of these two people, his heart was already clear and he was extremely worried for Jun Wu Xie. He was afraid that she could not even afford to take a single strike from Luo Qingcheng, let alone injure Luo Qingcheng.

But...

The impossible had happened, this... was really inconceivable!

If his situation permitted, he really wanted to clap his hands in marvel.

Let’s not even mention Jun Wu Xie, even if it was Ren Huang, he may not be able to hurt Luo Qingcheng.

In the end... How did she do it?!

A thread of suspicion sprouted in the heart of Ren Huang.

Jun Wu Yao was willing to take up a large number of enemies and had entrusted Jun Wu Xie to him. He definitely had his own reason for doing that, initially Ren Huang thought that it was because of Jun Wu Yao’s affection for Jun Wu Xie but from the looks of things, things weren’t so simple.

If Jun Wu Yao was captured, the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms would take place sooner or later. Even if Jun Wu Xie escaped this time round, he was afraid that the future would...

However, the moment that Jun Wu Xie managed to inflict a wound on Luo Qingcheng, Ren Huang seemed to have understood something. He could not help but suck in a mouthful of cold air.

Looking at the heavily injured Jun Wu Xie, Ren Huang mind continuously flashed countless conjunctures.

Did this mean that Jun Wu Yao had placed all the bets on Jun Wu Xie?

Jun Wu Xie had an incredible talent but did Jun Wu Yao really feel that.... Jun Wu Xie could defeat the Upper Realm? What kind of trust was this?
