Chapter 796 : “Zephyr Rises Once More (5)”

“Little Xie, what do you think?” Fan Zhuo finally still chose to let Jun Wu Xie to make the decision as up till that moment, Jun Wu Xie’s stratagem had never led them into any major problems.

Jun Wu Xie looked calmly at Fan Zhuo and the others. Whatever Fan Zhuo had told all of them, she had naturally thought about it before. But just as Fan Zhuo had said, their best option now would be to link up to Lei Chen. Afterall, Lei Chen had already taken the first step for them and regardless whether it was to discourage all the pesky talent scouts or to make it easier for them to find the map, linking up with Lei Chen would be the obvious choice for them.

“We’ll do that.” Jun Wu Xie said with a nod.

“Then, do we need to make a trip to the Crown Prince’s Residence now?” Qiao Chu opened his mouth to ask. He could still distinctly remember that Jun Wu Xie’s attitude towards Lei Chen the last two times they met had been extremely cold and indifferent.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“He will come offering himself at our door.”

If Lei Chen had initially come to the Immortals’ Loft because of her Spirit Healing, then after Qiao Chu and the others had put up such brilliant display of their extraordinary powers, Lei Chen would be sure to suddenly realise that the Zephyr Academy in its decline was still of much more great worth, and he wouldn’t let such a good opportunity slip by him.

And Jun Wu Xie’s words had materialised very soon after that.

Just as Fan Jin was still busy handling the talent scouts and people from all the various powers, the horse carriage of the Crown Prince’s Residence slowly rolled to a stop before the doors of the Immortals’ Loft. Lei Chen came down from the carriage and his eyes were met with the squeezy crowd within the Immortals’ Loft.

Just one glance and Lei Chen’s eyes narrowed. But that expression on his face was quickly replaced by a smile, looking just like the usual amicable and approachable Crown Prince as he walked slowly into the hall on the ground level.

All the people who were here trying to recruit the disciples of the Zephyr Academy suddenly saw the figure of Lei Chen among them. The entire hall suddenly fell silent everyone’s eyes turned to the Crown Prince.

“I am glad that everyone holds the Zephyr Academy in such high regard. But the Spirit Battle Tournament has only just begun and no matter what issues you have with them, I would like to request that everyone does not disturb the much needed rest of the disciples of the Zephyr Academy.” Lei Chen said in a gentle and friendly tone, with a wide smile on his face.

Having been resourceful enough to gather news so quickly about the disciples of the Zephyr Academy, the people in the Immortals’ Loft were all definitely smart enough. Lei Chen’s eviction order had been skillfully issued. He had shown all of them due respect, and had firmly made his stand known.

At that time, many people from powers all over the lands were gathered in the Yan Country’s Imperial Capital, and none of them would be dumb enough to openly go against the Crown Prince on his own turf. Everyone immediately put on an awkward smile on their faces and nodded as they went out of the Immortals’ Loft one by one.

Every single one of them could see that Lei Chen had developed an interest in the Zephyr Academy and even if they wished to compete, they knew they were no match for the Yan Country’s Crown Prince.

As the crowd diminished, the wearied Fan JIn was finally able to heave a sigh of relief. Having had to deal with so many people at the same time, had really been a challenge to him. His face was already cramping up from having to smile so much and his throat was so dry that he thought smoke would be coming out of his mouth next.

“It must have been hard on Headmaster Fan. Someone go prepare a pot of chrysanthemum tea for Headmaster Fan.” Lei Chen said, smiling at Fan Jin as he ordered the innkeeper of the Immortals’ Loft to prepare it.

“Thank you Your Highness for your kindness.” Fan Jin’s voice had already turned slightly raspy and he could only smile at Lei Chen.

Lei Chen replied: “Headmaster Fan, you’re working too hard. I have known that the disciples of the Zephyr Academy were highly capable all this time and their performance today had really shown everyone in the Capital City what they are all capable of. I am afraid that the matter will not rest here today and I think it will continue to be harsh for our Headmaster Fan in the coming days.”

Fan Jin smiled bitterly and shook his head.

Lei Chen’s eyes swung up into the second level and he tried to put on an air of careless nonchalance as he asked: “Have they all retired to their rooms to rest yet?”
