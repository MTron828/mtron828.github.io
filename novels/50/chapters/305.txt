Chapter 306: “Obliterate (1)”

When the sky lightened, Qiao Chu left and stood guard outside Jun Wu Xie’s door.

Hua Yao and Jun Wu Xie waited within the Hidden Cloud Peak for the arrival of the Sovereign, Qin Yue.

When Qin Yue appeared at the Hidden Cloud Peak, the new recruits were overawed. They tagged behind the Sovereign with adoration in their eyes.

The man behind the Qing Yun Clan’s might, the man fabled to be the most highly skilled in medicine throughout the lands!

Over the generations of Sovereigns of the Qing Yun Clan, they had all possessed extraordinary skills in medicine. In the early days, the founder of the Qing Yun Clan was the widely famed miracle healer and after he set up the Qing Yun Clan, and over the generations, the people of the lands had come to tag the name of the world’s top healer to the serving Sovereign of the Qing Yun Clan.

Almost daily, people showed up uninvited, hoping for Qin Yue to help them alleviate their pains and ailments. Besides the high demand for treatment and healing, many others swarmed to him for elixirs.

Healing and cultivation of elixirs were never far apart and skilled healers would always have unique recipes for an elixir or two.

At the Qing Yun Clan, it was believed that Qin Yue’s healing skills could bring a man on the brink of death back to life and relieve all his wounds. His elixirs were in great demand as people were bound to fall prey to illnesses and ailments and the sick infirmed, or even severely wounded might not be able to survive the long arduous journey to the Qing Yun Clan.

Moreover, Qin Yue only extended his healing skills to just one patient a month and that privilege was highly sought after. Unless they had in hand something the Qing Yun Clan sought, that opportunity was usually beyond the reach of most people.

In a plea to convince Qin Yue to lend his medicinal expertise, many expert exponents volunteered to stay within the Qing Yun Clan to serve as resident mercenaries, and countless rich families have parted with vast riches for that sense of security the elixirs gave.

In the eyes of the people, the Qing Yun Clan Sovereign held more than just his expertise in medicine.

Not just the Qing Yun Clan’s Sovereign’s healing expertise was highly sought, people fought to impress him just to be accepted as a disciple of the Qing Yun Clan. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The youths were eager to leave a lasting impression on Qin Yue and would have leeched on but the thought of Ke Cang Ju’s sinister face loomed within their minds and they gave up after some time.

Qin Yue’s benign face smiled gently as he walked within the Hidden Cloud Peak and his exalted but harmonious presence put a distance between himself and the respectful disciples and many of them swore to strive to emulate some of Qin Yue’s dominating air.

Under a crowd of adoring eyes, Qin Yue came to Ke Cang Ju’s quarters and entered. The smile on his face disappeared immediately and that benign face clouded, his brow creased into a frown, his foul mood and displeasure obvious.

His face darkened, Qin Yue strode quickly forward, seemingly familiar with the way around. He stood in the study in moments, finding Ke Cang Ju flipping through his ancient texts.

With a bang, Qin Yue slammed the door shut.

Hua Yao looked up from behind his desk, his hideous face splitting into a sinister smile. A little black cat laid lazily upon the desk, its eyes closed, looking like it was fast asleep.

“Our Sovereign seems to be in a rather foul mood today?” Hua Yao said, imitating Ke Cang Ju’s sarcastic tone.

“I want you to concoct a poison for me, one that makes people suffer a fate worse than death, and inflicts unimaginable horrific agony!” Qin Yue’s face was distorted with undisguised hatred and his words dripped with venom.
