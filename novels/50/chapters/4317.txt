Chapter 2913: Teach You How To Be Human (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Looking at the entire Upper Realm, the only person who could enjoy these supreme powers was His Lord alone. Even a proud person like Bai Mo was full of respect for His Lord.

The respect and fear of that absolute power could never be surpassed.

And who was this Yan Hai, according to the rumours?

He was just a young man who had inherited the command of Sea Spirit City when the former city lord had died. According to the rumors, it was said that Yan Hai was lucky enough to have come into possession of some special kind of elixir which prompted him and his soldiers to rise up in strength, thus suppressing the entire 72 cities.

This rumor sounded ridiculous.

Bai Mo was unwilling to believe that the unique Dual Spirit Rings came from that elixir. Not even if he was beaten to death.

However, the moment Bai Mo really saw Jun Wu Xie, the ridicule and disdain in his heart disappeared in an instant. The intensity of his own Spirit Ring was very high even if he hadn’t reached the peak yet, but he had also been reluctant. Even if a Spirit Ring user who was at the peak stood in front of him, he could definitely feel the strength of the opponent’s spiritual power, unlike that of Jun Wu Xie, he could not feel it at all.

Could it be that...

The rumour was true?

Bai Mo’s heart suddenly jumped to his throat. He didn’t forget the relationship between Nangong Lie and Sea Spirit City. Before, he had deliberately provoked Nangong Lie because he didn’t believe the rumors, but he didn’t expect that ... the person in question had actually arrived!

“Yes.” Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow and looked at the nervous Bai Mo.

The Bai Mo’s lips tightened into a thin line, and blood seemed to have drained from his lips.

Just a brief fight, and Bai Mo clearly realized that he was definitely not the young man’s opponent, this kind of insurmountable gap Bai Mo had only experienced from two persons before.

One was the ruler of the Upper Realm, and the other was Ye Jue who had pushed him into the abyss.

And Jun Wu Xie was the third person he met!

He could almost imagine what miserable state he would be in once he started fighting with Jun Wu Xie.

The arrogance that Bai Mo originally displayed was completely absent the moment Jun Wu Xie appeared, and the change was apparent even to the onlookers. Some of them had heard of the strength of Jun Wu Xie but had not witnessed it in person. Today, they finally saw how easily Jun Wu Xie had resolved the confrontation between the two Spirit Ring powerhouses, and even scared one of them. The gap in strength was evident.

This was the Overlord who commanded the 72 cities, it was an existence that was insurmountable.

“Do you have any opinion on Nangong Lie’s cooperation with me?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Bai Mo with cold eyes as her spiritual power was released bit by bit.

In front of everyone, Jun Wu Xie’s entire body was being wrapped in layers of spiritual power, just like a flame burning bright. That immense spiritual power was only released a little but made the people around feel a strong sense of coercion and oppression, making it difficult for anyone present to breathe. One by one, the people around felt like their throats were being squeezed, as their perspiration poured like rain.

Moreover, they couldn’t even stand, as they fell directly onto the ground with pale faces, looking quite suffocated. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even Bai Mo’s face was a little pale, and he never expected that the gap between himself and Jun Wu Xie would be so large. The sense of coercion released by Jun Wu Xie had given him difficulties.
