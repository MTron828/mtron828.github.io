Chapter 3027 Surprise discovery 3

“So many ...” Jun Wu Xie’s gaze swept through the room, and the candlelight was so weak that it couldn’t shine at the end of the room. She seemed to feel that the world in front of her was a huge endless black hole.

Innumerable souls, innumerable crystal balls, fastened by that unknown and that sinister plan.

Jun Wu Yao took Jun Wu Xie into his arms, raised his hand, and lit a flame with dark spirit at his fingertips. The small flame flew to the dark room with the flick of his finger. The place where the flame passed illuminated everything. As the flame advanced, the size of this room was far beyond Jun Wu Xie’s expectations.

The entire room was like a bottomless hole. From the initial entrance, the entire ground begins to extend downwards regularly, from the ground to the bottom, which makes the room look small from the outside, but it’s real area was covered to the ground.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao glanced at each other, and both of them did not speak, but they tacitly moved together and walked deeper in.

A cluster of dark spirit flames ignited at Jun Wu Yao’s fingertips, illuminating the road in front of them like a night pearl.

The road beneath their feet gradually sloped down. They could feel that there were small protrusions on the slate floor that they had just stepped on. It was these uneven protrusions that allowed those shelves to stand firmly on the sloping ground without falling.

Every step they took, where the flame illuminated, neatly arranged shelves that were densely packed with crystal balls could be seen. Under the faint light, faces twisted with anguish and fear on the crystal balls looked like evil spirits crawling out of hell. Such a horrifying sight made one dare not look straight at it.

Jun Wu Yao subconsciously tightened the hand holding Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder, knowing that she would not be afraid, but he couldn’t help but want to protect her.

But the further down, the more “quiet” souls in the crystal balls appeared on both sides. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

To be precise, the souls inside the crystal balls were getting smaller and smaller.

From the initial adult men and women, to where Jun Wu Xie was now at, the souls in the crystal ball have become some young souls. Those souls look up to eleven or twelve years old. Their bodies were thin, their faces were showing panic and anxiety. They didn’t scream or freak out. Instead, they curled up anxiously and were huddled in the corner.

“These are some children ...” Jun Wu Xie looked at the young souls. They were not adults yet. They were all only children. They would not vent their fears, but only subconsciously want to escape the danger they felt.

“It seems that our previous guess was correct.” Jun Wu Yao’s footsteps suddenly came to a halt.

Jun Wu Xie also stopped. The flames in Jun Wu Yao’s hands illuminated the souls on the two rows of shelves in front of them. Compared with the souls of the children who were already considered small before, the souls that appeared in front of them at the moment were much smaller.

Those were the babies who haven’t opened their eyes. They lay in the crystal balls ignorantly, as quietly as they fell asleep.

They didn’t even know what danger was.

Jun Wu Yao made the flame at his fingertips larger and as the illuminated area became wider, they could see that all around them, in the countless crystal balls, they were all filled with small souls of babies!
