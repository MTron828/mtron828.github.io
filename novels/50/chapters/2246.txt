In a flash, there was a trail of blood that trickled down the corner of Jun Wu Yao’s lips. He narrowed his purple eyes as a cold glint flashed by.

Luo Qingcheng’s lips curled up as she looked in relish at Jun Wu Yao who was trying to suppress the life and death worm.

“It hurts, doesn’t it? Being tortured by it for a thousand years yet you are able to maintain your own consciousness. Ye Jue, this doesn’t feel to good, does it? Why should you suppress it, since it is so painful, why don’t you give in to the life and death worm.... At least you don’t have to suffer.” Luo Qingcheng said slowly in a persuasive tone, she no longer had any fear, not because she had the confidence to defeat him but.... Because of the life and death worm that he could not escape from.

Jun Wu Yao’s breathing became extremely erratic and the pain that was tearing his mind apart started to spread throughout his whole body. The blue veins on his neck protruded and it was evident how much pain he was in.

However, even so, he did not reveal any fear nor panic.

A cold smile crept onto her face as she watched him forcibly trying to bear the pain. She no longer had any worry, once the life and death worm had been agitated, even if Jun Wu Yao wanted to kill her, every step he took he would have to bear an earth shattering pain. That degree of pain was felt down right into the nerves, even if it was was a god who descended could not tolerate it. Jun Wu Yao’s forbearance had already reached his limit.

Luo Qingcheng’s gaze swept to the side and was fixated on Jun Wu Xie. She was not a fool, she could tell that Jun Wu Yao had struck out to protect Jun Wu Xie. How could she not see such an obvious thing?

Giving her the Face of Selvan and not hesitating to be embroiled in a bloodbath – all just save her. Luo Qingcheng’s gaze was filled with hatred.

All these should belong to her, not that little slut!

“You seem to care very much about this little slut? That’s good, at first I had no intention to torture her. But now, I’ve changed my mind. I should torture her to death, little by little right in front of you. What do you say?” Luo Qingcheng’s voice was filled with malice as she looked provocatively at Jun Wu Yao, walking closer to Jun Wu Xie step by step.

“If you dare to hurt her, you can give it a try. If she dies, I will follow her.” Jun Wu Yao’s stern and oppressive voice sounded out.

Luo Qingcheng stopped in her tracks, she turned her head in disbelief and looked at Jun Wu Yao with widened eyes.

“You are willing to die for her? Ye Jue! Have you gone mad! Just for this little slut!! You actually!” Luo Qingcheng’s chest started heaving up and down angrily. Jun Wu Yao was an extremely arrogant person, there was no person under the heavens that he would care for. But today, he actually threatened her with his own life! All just to preserve Jun Wu Xie’s life!

“Luo Qingcheng, remember my words. If you dare to hurt her, I would immediately severe my meridians.” Jun Wu Yao clenched his fists tightly, trying to restrain and suppress the torture of the life and death worm. He had an incredibly strong will that was extraordinary, normal people would have gone mad after experiencing such torture.

“You!!” Luo Qingcheng gnashed her teeth as she glared angrily at Jun Wu Yao.

He even threatened her with his own life for this little slut!

He had fled and escape for a thousand years. Even if he had been captured and imprisoned in the dark dungeons, he never had the idea of seeking death. But now, he was willing to kill himself for someone else!

Luo Qingcheng had been shocked thoroughly, she would never doubt his words. She knew very well that he did not speak any lies, if he had said so, it meant that he would do so!

If she really killed Jun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Yao would not live for a second more!
