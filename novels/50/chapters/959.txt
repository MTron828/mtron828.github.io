Chapter 960: “Thousand Beast City (6)”

Qu Wen Hao had given his entire life to the Thousand Beast City and he had been over thirty when he had her daughter Qu Ling Yue with his wife. Even though Qu Ling Yue was a girl, but Qu Wen Hao had showered all his attention and fatherly love to Qu Ling Yue, and despite the current dire straits the Thousand Beast City was currently facing, he was still doing everything he could to protect this daughter of his.

“Chieftain.” Xiong Ba said as he knelt down on one knee.

Qu Wen Hao nodded with a smile and said: “I have greatly troubled Chief Xiong this time.”

“Chieftain is too kind. Being able to bring Young Miss back safely, your subordinate is greatly satisfied.” Xiong Ba said.

“Come sit down.” Qu Wen Hao pulled Qu Ling Yue to the side to take a seat, anxiously looking his daughter up and down. When he saw the rosy cheeks on Qu Ling Yue’s face and was completely unlike the news he had previously heard from the Fire Country where she was gravely injured, his heart filled with joy and relief, but he could not help himself as as questions grew in his mind.

“Ling Yue, you are fully recovered from your injuries?”

Qu Ling Yue glanced at Xiong Ba before she told her father everything that had happened in the Fire Country.

When Qu Wen Hao finishing hearing everything, a strange look came onto his face. He had not thought that Qu Ling Yue’s initially supposed grave injuries, would turn out to be secretly induced under the arrangements of Fire Country’s Emperor! The moment he heard that his daughter had suffered such torment because of the Fire Country’s Emperor’s selfish desires, Qu Wen Hao was enraged. Fortunately Qu Ling Yue immediately told him of the change of regime in the current Fire Country and Qu Wen Hao’s rage was overtaken with several gasps of shock he gave.

“Is all this true?” Qu Wen Hao stared wide eyed in disbelief. From Qu Ling Yue’s words, he realized that the current Fire Country’s rulership had completely changed. The Emperor had been forced to abdicate, while the Empress’, Prime Minister’s and the Fourth Prince’s heads were publicly displayed in shame over their city’s gates!

The Fire Country was the biggest country and they had not found anyone who was their match for many years. So, who would have thought that the one who had completely taken them down this time was not another country, or another power, but was a completely unknown young youth!

“Every single word I said is true, and I witnessed it all with my own eyes.” Qu Ling Yue reaffirmed as she nodded her head.

“Such an intelligent person exist under these Heavens? That is really very shocking to know. That kind of resourcefulness and his extraordinary spirit power level. It is all just too unbelievable.” As the Grand Chieftain of the Thousand Beast City, Qu Wen Hao had seen much in the ways of the world. He had many quite a lot of the strange happenings and extraordinary people of the world before, but he had never encountered a youth so well equipped with both brain and brawn.

Just fourteen to fifteen years old and he was able to toy with the mightiest country in the land within the grasp of his palm? And his spirit powers had reached the green spirit level as well? That was inhuman! That person could only be a demon!

“Young Master Jun is quick witted and nimble minded, and he possesses extraordinary power. He is truly the most extraordinary talent that your subordinate has ever seen in his life.” Xiong Ba praised generously when talking about Jun Xie. To possess such gift and not be proud nor impatient, not rash like many youths at that age, it was indeed very rare to see.

“Hearing the two of you heaping such praise on him, I am rather keen to meet this Young Master Jun myself.” Qu Wen Hao said with a laugh.

Qu Ling Yue was delighted and she immediately said: “Then your daughter is of the same mind as father. Young Master Jun is currently here in the Thousand Beast City as a guest and is currently put up in the Fire Blaze Clan Hall by Uncle Xiong.”

“Oh? Then Xiong Ba you have to make sure that you treat our guest well.” Qu Wen Hao said with a laugh.

Qu Ling Yue and Xiong Ba exchanged a glance with each other. They could see that Qu Wen Hao held admiration for Jun Xie and after thinking about it another moment, Qu Ling Yue suddenly leaned over to Qu Wen Hao’s ear and whispered into it.
