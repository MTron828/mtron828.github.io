Chapter 3006 You Have Returned 1

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao quickly returned to the place arranged by Nangong Lie.

In the room, Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo could already get out of bed and walk around. Although movement was still a bit difficult, they looked much better. Bai Mo and Qiao Chu were kept busy, brewing the medicine on the side. Only Fei Yan was sitting alone in a chair motionless.

Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo had already absorbed the new Spirit Rings. During the acclimation period, Qiao Chu and Fei Yan had absorbed them even faster and although they had obviously gained their strength, there was no smile on anyone’s face.

When Jun Wu Xie returned to the room and saw that scene, her heart constricted.

Since what happened to Rong Ruo, how long has it been since this group of people laughed? She could not remember.

Everytime Qiao Chu and the rest tried to look relaxed in front of her, Jun Wu Xie, through her years of interaction and deep understanding of them, could tell they were all forced smiles.

They did not want her to worry and she did not want them to suffer.

Jun Wu Xie unconsciously touched the Cosmos Sack at her waist and her steps became heavy. It was a rare show of vulnerability and Jun Wu Yao wordlessly put his arm on her back to give her some encouragement.

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath and walked towards her companions.

“Master.” Blood Velvet said as Jun Wu Xie approached. He had a smile on his face which faded fast when he looked at the others in the room.

Qiao Chu, Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo regained their senses when they saw Jun Wu Xie and tried hard to look more upbeat and not so depressed in front of her.

Qiao Chu said in as cheerful a tone as possible, “Little Xie, look how fast I absorbed the Spirit Ring, not bad right?”

Jun Wu Xie looked at Qiao Chen’s smile that carried in it no joy, only suffering.

Her friends should not be in such pain.

“Not bad.” Jun Wu Xie said with a smile, not wanting to break the facade.

Qiao Chu scratched his head and did not know what else to say. He walked over to Jun Wu Yao’s side and stood silently.

Jun Wu Xie inspected the injuries of Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo and found that both of them were recovering well. The Spirit Rings not only gave them powerful spiritual strength, but also improved their physical strength. It was very beneficial for people as badly injured as them.

Lastly, Jun Wu Xie walked over to Fei Yan. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Fei Yan’s face was covered by a heavy bandage with only his nose and mouth exposed. He could not see but sensed Jun Wu Xie’s approach.

“You’re back.” Fei Yan said, his voice was hoarse and had lost the melody that it once had.

Hua Yao and the others at the side clenched their fists silently, holding back their inner pain.

Jun Wu Xie whispered softly.

“Is everything ok?” Fei Yan asked.

“Things are ok.” Jun Wu Xie pursed her lips, carefully opened her cosmos sack and took out the valuable puppet that was inside.

Qiao Chen and the rest were puzzled, not understanding why Jun Wu Xie had brought back a broken puppet. In the midst of their bewilderment, Jun Wu Xie placed the puppet on the table next to Fei Yan.

The little puppet started moving in front of their very eyes!
