Thinking of this, Su Jing Yan couldn’t help but feel nervous for the Night Regime. From the bottom of his heart, he did not want Qiu Yun’s plan to succeed. Although he was in no position to choose because if the Nine Temples had just a little resistance or disrespect, then the Nine Temple Lords who had been captured by the Upper Realm would be sent to death.

It was precisely because of the vicious means of the Upper Realm that the Nine Temples did not dare to speak out. They could ignore their own life and death but they could not let their own Temple Lords be killed because of their own actions.

At this moment, Su Jing Yan prayed hard for a miracle to happen just like five years ago at the Cloudy Brook Academy. There was a person that had appeared and reversed the entire situation!

“You say, how should I dispose the lot of you? Should I break your hands and legs them throw you into the snake pit? Or should I crush each bone in your body and throw you on the ground like a heap of mud? Or perhaps... I could bring your heads back to the Upper Realm and send them to the Dark Emperor and let him appreciate and see the end of you dogs?” Qiu Yun said maliciously.

However, there was still no action from Ye Sha and the rest. They only stared at everything around them indifferently with their cold gaze. It was as if Qiu Yun’s words were just passing words that have been blown away by the wind and had not even entered their ears.

The indifference of the Night Regime further provoked Qiu Yun’s unhappiness and malevolence.

It was this very look!

Qiu Yun could not help but clench both hands into tight fists, the indifference of Ye Sha and the others had made him think of Jun Wu Yao.

The Jun Wu Yao of that year was also like this. When Qiu Yun tried to please him, he still remained detached and aloof. He did not put Qiu Yun in his eyes at all and it was as if Qiu Yun was a sad joke!

But now, things were different.

He was no longer the weak man of the past and Jun Wu Yao had lost all his former glory and was only a prisoner!

So what if Jun Wu Yao was strong? If he had anyone to blame, it had to be himself who was the sacrifice that was necessary for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. No matter how strong he was, could be make the entire Upper Realm his enemy?

A vicious smile spread across Qiu Yun’s face as he raised his gaze and looked at Ye Sha and his men that stood before him. He did not need to worry that they would escape nor worry that there would be reinforcements. No matter how strong the Night Regime was, they were simply a group of wastes from the Middle Realm and here today with him, he had over ten thousand men with thousands of Gold Spirits. Today, even if they had been given wings, they couldn’t fly away! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s really people of Ye Jue that fella, even the arrogance is the same. It’s such a pity though, he has now became a prisoner, what Dark Emperor... it’s all so ridiculous, how can he be worthy of the title ‘Emperor’? He’s just an imbecile who doesn’t know what’s good for him! The Lord is willing to keep his dog life till now only because he is still somewhat useful. And the lot of you here will soon get the punishment you deserve, perhaps you can take the first step into hell and pave the way for your dog of a master!” Qiu Yun spat out vindictively and the maliciousness in his gaze was undisguised.

In that moment, Ye Sha and the rest suddenly pulled their swords out as a trace of anger could finally be seen on his cold face!

“If you dare to tarnish Lord Jue’s name half a word more, I would dismember your body into a million pieces!” Ye Sha narrowed his eyes dangerously as he warned in a cold tone!
