Jun Wu Xie nodded and said. “Yeah. If I’m not sure about it, I won’t be shifting the battlefield to the Lower Realm.”

Jun Qing nodded his head with his head full of thoughts.

“Uncle, are the cities at the border emptied?” asked Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Qing replied. “Just as what you asked, they were all emptied, but what are you planning to do? Though the cities you asked me to empty out can be used to avoid the battle and buy us some time, but with the moving speed of the Upper Realm, I’m afraid that they will just pass through those places without using much time. If no forces are sent to repress them, almost no effect will be shown in blocking them.”

Before Jun Wu Xie entered the Spirit World, she specifically asked Jun Qing to empty out few of the cities in the Lower Realm which were located closest to the Middle Realm without leaving out a single person. Jun Qing understood that Jun Wu Xie was planning to let the gold spirits from the Upper Realm to bear the pressure brought by the environment of the Lower Realm using this method, but... if there’s no one on the defence, the troops of the Upper Realm will just march into the cities and this won’t last any longer.

“Of course, when the time comes, someone will be going, ” said Jun Wu Xie slowly.

“Are you going to let the Night Regime take the lead?” Jun Qing stunned a little. After Jun Wu Xie left, all the members in the Night Regime had collectively went missing. Not even a trace of them was seen in these two months. Jun Qing couldn’t really guess what was the things that Jun Wu Xie planned to let the Night Regime do.

“The Night Regime is surely strong, but no normal people are able to withstand hundreds thousand armies in the troops of the enemy. The strength of the Night Regime is more suitable to be used in the battle. If there’s excess consumption due to them taking the lead, it will just give us harm and we won’t be gaining anything.” Jun Qing frowned slightly.

“It’s not the Night Regime,” said Jun Wu Xie.

“Not the Night Regime?”

Before Jun Qing got his question solved, three figures suddenly appeared in the main hall of the Lin Palace.

“Young Miss!” It was Ye Sha, Ye Mei and Ye Gu who came back unexpectedly at this moment. Three of them kneeled in front of Jun Wu Xie in unison.

“How is it?” There wasn’t any astonishment in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

“Everything is well prepared. There’s no need to worry about, Young Miss.” Ye Sha raised his head with a serious expression on his face, but a trace of a smile could be faintly seen in his eyes.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head with satisfaction.

Whereas Jun Qing and Jun Xian who were sitting aside became more confused, what had Jun Wu Xie got up her sleeves?

“Grandfather, Uncle, just take it easy. I have already arranged everything nicely. There’s no way for the Upper Realm to go off without a hitch in the Lower Realm. Just wait and see.” The face of Jun Wu Xie was brimming with confidence. It was like everything was kept under her control.

It looked like her confidence had affected Jun Xian and Jun Qing. They realized vaguely that the things Jun Wu Xie asked the Night Regime to do were definitely not something as simple as they thought. This might be another hidden card of hers.

After discussing with Jun Qing and Jun Xian for quite a while, Jun Wu Xie then got up and returned to the backyard. The moment Lord Meh Meh and Sacrificial Blood Rabbit saw Jun Wu Xie came back, they immediately pounced on her and gave Jun Wu Xie a big fat hug.

“Soon after this, you guys need to work hard again.” Jun Wu Xie sat on a stone bench in the garden and put Sacrificial Blood Rabbit and Lord Meh Meh on her lap while gently stroking them. Ye Sha and the others were following behind her.

“Please do not worry about it, Young Miss. The experiences of Lord Meh Meh and Sacrificial Blood Rabbit in these five years aren’t able to be compared to the experience of a normal beast spirit. They aren’t the same them in the past five years anymore,” said Ye Sha. Throughout the five years, not only Jun Wu Xie was cultivating all the time, but Lord Meh Meh and Sacrificial Blood Rabbit too, were growing non-stop. Both of them were completely scarred by the scene five years ago. They didn’t want the tragedy to repeat again.
