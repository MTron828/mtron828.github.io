Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows slightly.

For the Banquet of Heroes, they had invited the 72 City Lords, all whom were present. At this moment, a guest had arrived. This guest would definitely be of high profile, otherwise the Ghost Army will not come to report.

“Who is it?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“People sent by Highness Ying,” said the members of the Ghost Army. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were slightly puzzled.

Highness Ying?

She had never heard of this person.

Nangong Lie apparently noticed the doubt of Jun Wu Xie and whispered: “Highness Ying is the Son of the Lord. His status in the Upper Realm was equivalent to the Four Knights of Destruction. He is moody and temperamental. If he suddenly sent someone at this time, it doesn’t matter what the reason is... manners must still be in place. ”

Son of the Lord?

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly and she said immediately, “Please.”

Members of the Ghost Army immediately retreated to the side.

At the banquet, the City Lords of the 72 cities had already exploded with excitement.

They also heard something about this Highness Ying. But the City Lords themselves were not superior enough to contact him and other people of similar status. They could only know about him from hearsay.

However, no one thought that the Banquet of Heroes hosted by Jun Wu Xie could even alarm Highness Ying to even send someone to represent him.

In a moment, everyone’s awe towards Jun Wu Xie increased a few times!

A top ten master Nangong Lie and now, a Highness Ying, both were huge identities whom they could not provoke.

What kind of luck did Yan Hai possess? He could even manage to invite such two big names!

At the time of the discussion, the person sent by Highness Ying had arrived at the banquet. Everyone kept quiet at this moment, looking at the person cautiously and in awe.

A gorgeous woman stood out under the moonlight, and the candlelight fell on the woman’s face, adding a little dazzling halo to her beautiful face. Her long dress trailed behind her as she walked in unhurriedly.

When Jun Wu Xie saw the woman, she was surprised.

It’s her?

“I’m Gu Xin Yan, representing Highness Ying to greet all the City Lords. Here is a congratulatory gift prepared by His Highness for the City Lord of Sea Spirit City. Please accept it.” Gu Xin Yan kept her voice cold and looked up slightly without looking at anyone else, and numbly finished her words.

Jun Wu Xie condensed the slightest surprise in her eyes, slowly got up, and walked towards Gu Xin Yan.

“Thank you for the effort.” Jun Wu Xie said.

A little familiar voice suddenly shocked Gu Xin Yan’s numb heart. She lowered her head subconsciously and looked at the person who said it.

Standing in front of her was a handsome young man, thin, not tall, and did not look dazzling, but had a pair of cold eyes ...

A loud sound hummed in Gu Xin Yan’s head. Her eyes widened slightly. She stared at Jun Wu Xie. But she could not find any trace of familiarity from her expression. It was the voice, which was also very different from her memory. Her words sounded so cold.

Gu Xin Yan came back to her senses, she realized she had lost her composure as she took a deep breath and calmed her mind.

“This is Yan Hai, the City Lord of Sea Spirit City?” She couldn’t help asking.

With no expression on his face, Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were calm, and she said lightly, “Exactly.”
