Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The appearance of Jun Wu Xie sent chills down Wei Ya and Xie Changming’s spines. They thought that Jun Wu Xie’s attention would be focused on the battle but unbeknownst to them, Jun Wu Xie never took her attention away from Luo Qingcheng. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The temporary reprieve granted would make for greater destruction later.

Wei Ya almost instantly stood in front of Xie Changming and Luo Qingcheng as he used his Spirit Ring to ward off Jun Wu Xie’s imminent attack.

“Take Lady Qingcheng away!” Wei Ya gritted his teeth as he summoned up courage to face Jun Wu Xie. His Spirit Ring had already shrunk by one circle and the light emitted was dim. He was afraid that soon, he would not be able to condense out a complete Spirit Ring.

Xie Changming was shocked, the fear made his legs soft. However, Wei Ya’s roar did not allow him to relax for the moment. He could only hold on tight to Luo Qingcheng and retreated step by step. He was afraid that sudden, big movements would attract the attention of Jun Wi Xie.

“Jun Wu Xie! You slut!!” Once Luo Qingcheng saw Jun Wu Xie, she started struggling against Xie Changming.

Due to the struggles of Luo Qingcheng, Xie Changming became unstable on his feet and almost fell. He cursed Luo Qincheng in his heart.

[At a time like this!]

Luo Qingcheng still could not comprehend the current situation? With her current state, how was she able to fight Jun Wu Xie?

This was just seeking death!

If it wasn’t for the superior position of Luo Qingcheng, Xie Changming would not hesitate to give a tight slap to this reckless woman.

Although he had a deep seated hatred for Luo Qingcheng, but in order to keep his life, he had no choice but to restrain the impulsive woman.

“Lady Qingcheng, let’s stay alive and fight back another time. Don’t be impulsive!” Xie Changming advised.

“Get off me!” Luo Qingcheng pushed Xie Changming away unceremoniously. However that gaping wound on her shoulder hindered her movement and strength, and she was unable to distance herself completely.

Luo Qingcheng’s recklessness caused Wei Ya to be even more afraid and nervous as he looked towards Jun Wu Xie’s impending approach. A brief notion to seek death even flashed by his mind.

Disregarding his current condition, even if he and Xie Changming were at their peak, and had teamed up with Luo Liancheng, there was no guarantee that they could defeat Jun Wu Xie.

Just as Wei Ya was worrying about the situation, a figure suddenly appeared by Jun Wu Xie’s side.

“Miss, let me handle this person.” Ye Gu finally appeared on the battlefield. That young face held a pair of eyes, full of murderous intent. He was very clear who was Jun Wu Xie’s target, regardless that it was Wei Ya or Xie Changming, they were just insignificant little rocks in the way of Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly.

Ye Gu immediately looked at Wei Ya and his rosy lips lifted into a bloodthirsty smile.

“Who are you?” Wei Ya looked at Ye Gu in shock. Ye Gu’s whole body was shrouded with jet black spirit, and the power emanated made Wei Ya feel oppressed.

“I am the Dark Emperor’s Night Regime commander-in-chief, Ye Gu. Remember my name so that you remember who killed you while you rot in Hell.” Ye Gu sneered. Ye Gu did not give Wei Ya a chance to react as he charged at Wei Ya.

Wei Ya was still shocked, but he had no time to think about it. Ye Gu’s attack was like a thunderstorm heading towards him. Wei Ya was hard-pressed and suddenly looked extremely embarrassed.

While Wei Ya, who was blocking Jun Wu Xie, was distracted by Ye Gu, Luo Qingcheng was exposed to Jun Wu Xie.
