Nalan Shan then said with a bitter smile: “What else can I do? I cannot possibly leave my Master in the lurch and I do not want Brownie to come to any harm. Only with Brownie taken away from this place, would its safety be assured. I have told cheetah and the others that once I leave here, don’t tell Brownie too much and they will take care of Brownie from then on.”

“You really believe that Brownie will not know?” Jun Wu Xie asked with an eyebrow lifted as she looked at Brownie who was still tightly latched onto her leg. Despite it being such a large and enormous sized brown bear, at that moment, it made people feel that it looked so helpless, and its eyes that were staring right at Jun Wu Xie seemed to be pleading with her.

“Although Brownie is not able to open its mouth to speak, but it understands what is happening around it. It knows you are a good person, and that is why he came seeking your help in the beginning. It also knows what you are intending to do or why would you think it is holding on to me now?” Jun Wu Xie said, her heart feeling a little stifled, as the one thing she was weakest against was exactly with things like this.

Nalan Shan was speechless for a moment. He was trying very hard to convince himself that he had made proper arrangements for everything but a voice in his heart was telling him that everything was not as perfect as he had imagined.

“I can guarantee that once you’re captured by Wu Jiu, it would not even take month before this fool will be just like you, to go charging right in and delivering itself into a trap.” Jun Wu Xie said as she rubbed Brownie’s ears.

Brownie looked at Nalan Shan, its eyes filled with worry and reluctance to part.

Nalan Shan’s eyes did not dare to meet that gaze and he could only lower his head to avoid Brownie’s gaze.

Deeply afraid that if he looked into those eyes, he might waver in the decision he had made.

Jun Wu Xie sighed as she looked at the sorrowful and pitiful state the man and bear pair were in and she decided that she was not going to waste her breath. “I had indeed come looking for you today because of Wu Jiu, but I came here not because I want to stop you from going but am supporting you to go there, and to bring Brownie along with you.”

“What? Bring Brownie along with me? ! Impossible! If I am to bring Brownie, it would be captured by Wu Jiu! I cannot do that!” Nalan Shan immediately became anxious. He had thought that Jun Wu Xie had come to dissuade him. But against all expectations, Jun Wu Xie was not only not dissuading him, she was instead urging him to bring Brownie along with him! Wouldn’t that be throwing Brownie right into grave danger! ?

Not to mention Nalan Shan, even the other four Beast Spirits had immediately jumped to their feet upon hearing Jun Wu Xie’s words, to stare incredulously at Jun Wu Xie in disbelief.

“Please do not take the Spiritual Bear’s safety as a joke. Even if you are the Spiritual Bear’s benefactor, we will not allow the Spiritual Bear to suffer even the slightest hint of harm.” The cheetah said as looked at Jun Wu Xie disapprovingly, seemingly unable to understand why Jun Wu Xie would suddenly make such a suggestion.

Jun Wu Xie did not bother herself with Nalan Shan’s protest but just looked at the cheetah to say: “If it’s Nalan Shan goes by himself, Brownie will come to understand everything that has happened one day. Even if you can stop him for a period, you will never be able to stop his firm resolve. There will come a day that Brownie will go charging out. Do you think that if Wu Jiu were to hang Nalan Shan high up right before all the spirits and put him under merciless torture, you will be able to make yourself stand back and do nothing? And Brownie will be able to do nothing? Don’t think that I am exaggerating just to scare you as Wu Jiu is definitely capable of such things, and even things more cruel than this. At that time, even the few of you here will become rash, needless to mention Brownie.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jun Wu Xie’s words made the cheetah fall silent. For the past half a year, they had protected Brownie together with Nalan Shan throughout the whole period. How could they not have developed any affections for each other? If things were to really develop to the extent like Jun Wu Xie had said, not to mention Brownie, it was feared that it would be just like what Jun Wu Xie had said, that they would go on to act rashly.
