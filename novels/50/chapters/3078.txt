3079 The Final battle 7

God of Destruction’s ferocious eyes stared at Feng Ming.

Feng Ming was just an envoy in the land of Gods. He was the first human being created by the Gods. Because it was the first time to create a living body, some Gods remained in Feng Ming’s body. Divine power, which made him unable to survive in the Three Realms like other people.

In the end, he could only be kept by the Gods and served them.

At the moment when the God of Destruction’s conspiracy was exposed, Feng Ming stood beside the God of Destruction. He watched the God of Destruction arrange everything all by himself, and also looked forward to the moment when the God of Destruction broke the void.

“Good? What’s so good? Why? Why does the power of chaos repel me? Why accept them instead? I am clearly the most powerful God in the Three Realms! At the beginning, the God did not choose me, and even with the remaining power he still has not chosen me! Why? I have now become the only God in the Three Realms! No matter the pedantic God of Light, or whoever, they have disappeared forever. Now the only one who can break the void is only me!” The mask of God of Destruction’s self-confidence was completely torn at this moment. This unwillingness that had been suppressed in his heart for many years and it all came out at this moment.

He never thought of himself as the best of all Gods. When he knew that there was a God who could surpass them, his heart was full of disdain. But when he saw the powerful one with his own eyes, he was deeply convinced by that kind of power. He knew that the reason why God would come to the Three Realms was to pick out the best God among them. He always thought that he was chosen, It must be him ...

However...

His determination was eventually a joke.

That God left with a look of disappointment and regret. His eyes did not stay on God of Destruction even for a moment. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The self-confidence of God of Destruction had been smashed at that moment. The kind of disregard for shame and unwillingness was like a fire, burning his heart.

He swore that one day he would obtain such a powerful force and use his strength to prove that even if the God did not give him such an opportunity, he could win it himself!

When he breaks the void, he will find that God and tell him how wrong the original decision was!

Feng Ming looked at the God of Destruction that had fallen into madness and calmly said: “I am, as a sacrifice, the stronger the better, they have the combined power, which will be beneficial to your plan.”

Feng Ming’s words calmed down the God of Destruction in an instant. He stared ambitiously at Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Xie. The evil smile bloomed again at the corner of his mouth. You are my sacrifice, the stronger you are, the stronger the effect of the Blood Sacrifice Array, hahaha ... hahahaha ... ”

“Do you think that you can really do what you want?” Jun Wu Yao sneered, and the sound of the voice would interrupt the God of Destruction’s ruthless laughter.

The surging dark spirit raged in the palm of Jun Wu Yao, and gradually spread throughout the hall to form a huge sense of oppression. The chaos power and his dark spirit fusion were astonishingly high. This had been higher than the fusion of divine power in Jun Wu Xie’s body.
