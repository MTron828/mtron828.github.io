Ba He raised his head up and looked at the sky. Not a shred of emotion could be seen on his face. The silence in the entire square was so stifling that no one dared to utter a word.

Su Ya looked up weakly and her clear eyes peered into the blue sky above. It looked to be just an ordinary gaze, not at all like a person who was at the brink of death.

“You don’t have to waste your time, my Master will not come.” After staring at the vast skies for a while, Su Ya finally opened her mouth and spoke.

There was no change in Ba He’s expression but he looked at the battered and exhausted Su Ya. After the woman had fallen into his hands, she had not said a single word since. No matter what kind of coercion and torture they rendered, including breaking her beautiful slender fingers like twigs one by one, she remained silent. They even deliberately beat her Junior Brother in front of her until he became a waste, she still did not speak a word. Today, Su Ya finally spoke, but it was not what Ba He wanted.

“Whether he comes or not, it’s not what you have the final say in.” Ba He said coldly.

Su Ya hooked her lips up into a smile filled with disdain.

“Did you really think that if you catch me and my Junior Brother, you can use us as bait and lure my Master out? You are really ridiculous. Or should I say that you are childish, or are you just plain stupid? Compared with the three realms, what can my life be counted as? Even if you kill me, it’s useless.Since you can’t catch my Master, you resort to use such a shameless way to set a trap. Are all the people in the Upper Realm so stupid and ridiculous like you?”

Ba He’s eyes narrowed slightly as a dangerous cold glint flashed through his eyes.

Su Jing Yan was shocked when he heard this. He didn’t understand what Su Ya was up to. Each and every single word was just her own sentence to death, didn’t she know that whatever she said could make Ba He slaughter her in a fit of anger?!

Suddenly, Su Jing Yan seemed to have thought of something.

The reason why Su Ya said this was not that she didn’t care about life or death but she was bent on death!

She wanted to force Ba He to kill her before her Master arrived!

Losing her, this important chip, her Master will never be in danger!

It was clear that Su Ya was bent on sending herself to the doors of death!

“This is all you have? A bunch of impotent wastes with only so much, this old lady here did not put any of you in my eyes, hmph, I really feel sad for you.” Su Ya started laughing eccentrically and the more she laughed, the more blood started gushing out. Her laughter reverberated throughout the square, and once it entered the ears of the people, it hit their soul!

Ba He’s eyes became more and more gloomy. He glared at her but suddenly his lips curled up into a smirk. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You don’t have to waste your strength, I won’t kill you until sunset. Don’t worry, if by sunset and yet your cowardly Master is still not here, I will use the most cruel method in the world to torture you bit by bit. That’s why, for now, you should save your saliva and just wait quietly for your Master. See if he would really save your life, or as you said, completely abandon you.”

Su Ya’s laughter came to an abrupt end for she knew that she had failed to incite Ba He. Although this man was seemingly cold and cruel, he is not without a brain. It was not so easy to irritate him.

In the midst of the silence, a pair of cold eyes in the dark, stared at everything that happened in the square. That bloodied figure on the platform was etched deeply into the eyes, as it stirred up ripples of killing intent from within. After the owner to this pair of eyes quietly blended in with the crowd, the figure moved with amazing speed and bore through the crowd at an incredible speed so fast that no one noticed!
