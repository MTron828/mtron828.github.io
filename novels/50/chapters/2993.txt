Chapter 2994 Dead or alive 3

Su Ruiying hummed a weird song and sculpted the puppet little by little under the dim candlelight. As the puppet became more and more like Bai Zhu from the past, the soul of Baizhu in the crystal ball got weaker.

Until Su Ruiying spliced ​​the puppet’s body and head, and gently flicked the puppet’s hand, there was nothing in the crystal ball. The originally dull puppet in her hand revealed a frightened expression in an instant.

The puppet Bai Zhu struggled like crazy and had even managed to pry itself free from Su Ruiying’s hands. The wooden body that had just been made fell on the table with a click. But he ignored it and wanted to run when he got up.

Unfortunately...

He was now just a puppet with a short arm. He was desperate to escape, But with that small distance, Su Ruiying lifted her hand and pressed him motionless on the table. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What a disobedient puppet. Is this how you repay this way to your benefactor?” The smile on Su Ruiying’s face disappeared little by little. There was a faint glimmer of coldness in her eyes. Bai Zhu, a puppet under the palm of her hand, was already trembling with fright. But Su Ruiying’s eyes glanced at the side of the carving knife, and the other hand took the carving knife up and raised it high.

“Disobedient puppets need to be punished ...”

As the warning that made one’s hair stand on ends came out of Su Ruiying’s mouth, the knife fell instantly, and pierced the puppet’s abdomen fiercely.

Almost instantly, the puppet Bai Zhu, was nailed to the table. It was twitching and showing an extreme pained expression on his face, as if the knife had pierced his flesh!

Throughout the whole process, Su Ruiying was laughing. She seemed to enjoy Bai Zhu’s painful reaction. Until the puppet Bai Zhu couldn’t move because of the pain, she then pulled out the knife and took the weak puppet Bai Zhu off her hand.

“Be obedient, I don’t want my hard work to be burnt to a crisp.” Then, Su Ruiying’s eyes looked at the fire that had been extinguished behind him. There was a puppet’s arm that had been burnt into half.

As if feeling the threat of Su Ruiying, the puppet Bai Zhu shook his body and dared not react any more.

Su Ruiying peeled off the pierced clothes of the puppet Bai Zhu and changed another one for him.

When Su Ruiying stripped off the puppet clothes, Jun Wu Xie, who was standing outside the window, clearly saw that behind the entire figure of the puppet Bai Zhu, a prototype rune totem drawn from some material, which looked quite weird.

Su Ruiying changed the clothes for the puppet Bai Zhu and got up. She put it on the shelf beside her. After reading her work for a while, she took the crystal ball again and pushed open another door in the room. Soon after she entered, she got back outside the room and the crystal ball that was already empty suddenly had a brand new soul ...

Su Ruiying sat back at the table again. After placing the crystal ball, she selected a suitable piece of wood from the pile of wood on the side. She held the carving knife in one hand and the piece of wood in the other. The beautiful face distorted by fear and despair had evoked a smile of delight on her face.
