Chapter 3114 Big Red Lantern Hung Up High

Nobody knew exactly how stubborn Jun Qing was.

That night, neither he nor Yue Ye returned home to the Jun residence.

But Yan Bu Gui, who had already reunited with Su Ya, had seen Jun Qing call Yue Ye out at night to go to the lake for a chat.

After that incident....

Jun Xian never urged Jun Qing to get married again and the Jun household started preparations for a big wedding celebration.

Jun Wu Xie was melancholic, wondering if she would have to change how she addressed her disciple in the future....

...

On the day of the wedding, Jun Qing successfully brought Yue Ye away. As broken-hearted as the members of the Ruilin Army were, none dared to challenge him as they feared for their lives.

Qiao Chu and the rest were greeted by a sea of red decorations as they arrived to celebrate the festivities and each watched as the groom, Jun Qing, got redder and redder as he continued drinking wine.

“Looks like Little Uncle might not be able to perform in the bedroom tonight.” Qiao Chu said with a laugh. To the side, although the members of the Ruilin Army had no courage to challenge him, they did not hold back when it came to insulting him.

Jun Qing would have already been lying drunk on the floor if not for his high alcohol tolerance.

And this was not even counting the alcohol that Long Qi had drunk on his behalf.

“That’s where you’re wrong, even if he’s lying flat on the floor, he still must do it.” Fei Yan laughed. His appearance had fully recovered but his character remained unchanged. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I can’t believe he’s so drunk this early. If this continues, Long Qi will have to carry him back.” Qiao Chu thought out loud.

Fei Yan gently swirled the glass in his hand, “Have you forgotten who is Yue Ye’s teacher? She will surely have something simple like a sobering medicine on hand.”

“....” Qiao Chu remained silent, pretending he never said anything at all.

“Mother...hug...” Jun Mo Ye had just returned to the banquet hall after being in the bridal chamber looking at Yue Ye and immediately asked her mother for a hug when she saw her.

Jun Wu Xie laughed and picked her daughter up and put her on her lap. Jun Wu Yao, sitting to her side, smiled and placed some delicious food on the plate for his wife and daughter to eat.

The family of three looked the picture of harmonious contentment at the table.

Fei Yan could not help but smile at the scene. After drinking a few more, his eyes started to wander towards Rong Ruo, who was sitting next to him.

Rong Ruo’s soul was extracted out of the puppet by Jun Wu Xie and put into a new body. Rong Ruo had requested to be put into a male body and while there was little change to his facial appearance, the broad shoulders and chest gave no hint of femininity whatsoever. He had become a dashing young man.

Rong Ruo was kind by nature and when the women at the wedding celebration saw his gentle smile, they could not help but swoon. However, the attention Rong Ruo was receiving made Fei Yan feel suffocated.

He wished he could stuff Rong Ruo into his pocket, away from the lecherous eyes of those women.
