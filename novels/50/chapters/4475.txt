3071 The Frost Goddess 2

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao looked at each other, and Jun Wu Xie spoke first.

“We are not his underlings but have been sucked into this Chaos Array.”

“I see...In that case,” the woman’s mouth curled up slightly, showing some embarrassment, “Thank you, if not for you, I don’t know how long more I’d have been lost.”

“Who exactly are you?” Jun Wu Xie was very curious about the woman’s identity. From the power she just displayed Jun Wu Xie was sure that she was also a god, or at least used to be.

The woman lowered her head slightly, her eyes closed and a bitter smile formed on her lips.

“My name is Han Shuang, the Lord of Ice and Snow, and people called me the Goddess of Frost.” The woman continued, “At that time, my beloved Sun God was killed by the God of Destruction, imprisoning his body and soul in the Chaos Array. I traveled all over the world, and finally I found the God of Destruction. I could not defeat him and was imprisoned by the Chaos Array. I don’t know how long I’ve spent there and as my divine power and divine body gradually corroded, only my obsession remains... ”

Hearing what the woman said, Jun Wu Xie sighed and said nothing for a long time.

Her intuition was right, Han Shuang was indeed the same as the gods she had encountered before. The difference being her spirit was muddled from spending too much time in the Chaos Array.

“If we can leave the Chaos Array, we will definitely destroy the God of Destruction and return peace to the world.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and clenched her fists tightly. She may not have experienced what the Goddess of Frost went through in the Chaos Array for so many years. But the God of Destruction’s actions had reached breaking point with Jun Wu Xie.

How much happiness had he ruined and how much suffering had he created in order to achieve his goals?

“You will get out.” the woman stood up with some difficulty, the bitterness in her smile dissipated and she had a look of determination in her eyes. She looked at Jun Wu Xie and gave her a warm smile. “My thirst for revenge, after being in the array for so long, has become an obsession and it has given me some chaos power which I am now giving to you both as my final contribution.”

Jun Wu Xie was stunned, she did now know how to express how she was feeling.

The Goddess of Frost would ultimately succumb to the God of Destruction’s plans. By using her power to send them out of the array, it may be the end of her existence in this world, just like the God of Light and the rest of the Gods.

The Goddess of Frost seemed to sense Jun Wu Xie’s hesitation. Her smile turned gentle, no longer cold as ice, but there was an unspoken relief that could be seen. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Although I haven’t seen you before, I felt the pure divine power in your body just now and that power feels both familiar and strange.”

“I have received the grace and gift from the God of Light.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were slightly lowered, those gods contributed the last trace of divine power, to unseal her lost powers. She might have been unable to absorb their divine power, but there were still some traces of theirs in her power.
