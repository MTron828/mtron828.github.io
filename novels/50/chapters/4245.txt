Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Yan Xi’s emotions were very unstable after she had met Duan Qi as the harsh words of Duan Qi had pierced her heart like a needle.

When she returned to her residence, she saw Jun Gu appreciating the snow in his courtyard not far away. The handsome figure before her, standing against the contrasting white snow had occupied her entire heart. She had known for a long time that she would not be able to erase his figure as the intense possessiveness in her became stronger and stronger.

But...

Such a person would marry another woman two days later. She could only stand aside and watch.

Yan Xi was unwilling. She was very unwilling to see the person she’s been guarding for so long to eventually fall into the arms of others!

It could not be anyone else. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jun Gu, belonged to her!

He only belonged to her!

Yan Xi took a deep breath as she converged the emotions in her eyes and slowly walked towards Jun Gu.

“My Lord.”

Jun Gu heard her voice and turned to look at Yan Xi who was walking towards him.

“The Holy Mountain is a good place, it is very quiet and peaceful.” Jun Gu chuckled a little. The tranquility of the Holy Mountain made him feel very peaceful inside.

Yan Xi looked at Jun Gu’s perfect side profile as she felt her heartstrings tug. She tried to keep herself calm on the surface and pretended to ask: “This place might be good but at the same time it’s too cold and lonely. After sometime, you will be bored. ”

Jun Gu laughed and said nothing.

“My Lord, your marriage with the Sacred Maiden is finalized by the Lord. But you ... seem not to be concerned about this matter.” Yan Xi lowered her eyes, covering the emotions her eyes were exuding.

Jun Gu’s personality was gentle and the marriage with Han Zi Fei was decided directly by the Lord. After it was confirmed, he informed Jun Gu directly instead of discussing it with him. When Jun Gu got the news, he was shocked and stunned. He could only obey His Lord’s arrangement.

However, Yan Xi had been with Jun Gu for so long. She had been very observant towards any minor changes in Jun Gu. It was obvious that Jun Gu resisted this marriage and obeyed His Lord’s order and it’s all because of rhinoceros horn’s influence.

At that moment, Yan Xi really wanted to break the scent of rhinoceros horns. But she didn’t dare to, nor could she.

She was very clear that with rhinoceros horns, she may continue to stay with Jun Gu. But if the rhinoceros horn was missing ...

“This is His Lord’s order. I will naturally obey the arrangements of the Lord.” Jun Gu said lightly, but the smile on his face faded. For some reason, there was always a voice in his heart telling vaguely that he shouldn’t be like that. The voice was so ethereal that he couldn’t catch it and couldn’t touch it.

Yan Xi said quietly: “I was born in the Sacred Maiden Tribe. At that time, the Sacred Maiden was already in the tribe. Although I haven’t had much contact with her, I have heard of some things about her. Do you wish to hear it My Lord?”

Jun Gu said, “Oh? What is it?”

Yan Xi said: “This Sacred Maiden’s name is Han Zi Fei and is the third Sacred Maiden of our tribe. She has had a very strong psychic force since she was young. She has the purest bloodline and has always been a person whom the Lord was most concerned about. It’s just that... Han Zi Fei... She has a weird personality and she’s quite stubborn. Just a long time ago, she suddenly fled from the Upper Realm and no one knows where she went. Many people had been sent to look for her. But she couldn’t be reached. This marriage ... I heard that she asked it from the Lord herself ... ”
