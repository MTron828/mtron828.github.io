Chapter 2492: The Isolated Island (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A lone island which appeared on the sea of death, quietly like a small boat.

At this time, the sea was blowing a gust of wind, and the fine rain fell on the calm sea, causing a little ripple.

“Do you want to go on the island?” Jun Wu Xie stood beside Jun Wu Yao, having travelled for the better part of the month, this would be there first time discovering an island. The area of the island was not too small, the trees were dense, and it looked uninhibited.

“Mn.” Jun Wu Yao nodded, as there were some warning signs about an impending storm. It was a good thing for them to have found a small island at this moment.

Especially with Rong Ruo being plagued by seasickness, if they had met with a storm, with the pitching and rolling of the ship, it would have made her condition even worse.

Jun Wu Yao gave the order to disembark. The anchor was dropped. Most of the Night Regime and Ghost Army stayed onboard the ship, only Ye Sha and the other two followed Jun Wu Yao and the rest onto the island. In addition to the three from the Night Regime, a man with a ghost mask also followed the group. The man was the commander of the Ghost Army. He was called Gui Huang, and was one of Jun Wu Yao’s confidantes. He was always silent, Jun Wu Xie had never heard him speak.

The island was very quiet, only the rustling of leaves were heard as the wind blew.

Jun Wu Xie has also brought along the Sea Spirit Beast cub, although at this time, the frightened little guy’s eyes still held some fear but the panic was slightly less than during their initial meeting. Perhaps the cub had some awareness that Jun Wu Xie and her friends were not the enemies who hunted them. And thus, the little guy was rather calm at the moment.

Onboard the ship, they felt that the island wasn’t too small but once on land, they realized that land area of the island was rather vast. At first glance, they could not see the end, expect the dense jungle path in front of them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Finally we are on solid ground. Being on the ship and swaying for so long, I’m really starting to feel uncomfortable. I feel all that swaying is turning my brain into a sticky paste.” Qiao Chu exercised and loosened up his limbs, full of energy and not pathetically wet from the light rain.

Life on the sea more or less made them feel slightly uncomfortable. Previously, when they rushed from the Lower Realm to the Middle Realm, they also took a ship but the journey was not that long, but this time it made him hurt.

Jun Wu Xie walked up to Rong Ruo while carrying the little beast, Black Cat was seated on her shoulders, Lord Meh Meh and Blood Sacrificial Rabbit grovelling by her feet.

Rong Ruo’s face was extremely pale, just now the sudden retching caused her body to feel more discomfort to the point of exhaustion. She was sitting on the reef by the shore at the moment, breathing in big gulps of air.

“Still feeling very bad?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Rong Ruo’s reaction and frowned slightly. It was strange to say that Rong Ruo had been well before, but somehow, there was sudden seasickness these past two days.

Jun Wu Xie had checked on her several times, and she had not found any abnormalities. Besides the weakness of the body, she didn’t find anything else.

It was seemingly just sudden seasickness.

Rong Ruo nodded tiredly, just then when they encountered the Sea Spirit Beasts being slaughtered, perhaps it was the strong odor of blood that made her so nauseous that she nearly vomited bile, waves of pain in her head and her heart felt like there was a boulder pressed against it, and made it difficult for her to breathe.

“I’m going to do some recon up ahead, to see if the island has a suitable cave for rest. With Little Ruo’s condition, she should not go back onboard today.” Fei Yan’s heart was aching, as he suggested to the others his idea.
