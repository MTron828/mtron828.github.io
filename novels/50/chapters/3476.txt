Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Coming out from Nalan Shan’s room, Qiao Chu’s face was filled with smiles. Whenever he thought about the reactions of the cheetah and the others, he just could not help but want to howl.

“What do we do now?” Hua Yao then looked at Jun Wu Xie to ask. Based on his understanding of Jun Wu Xie, he did not believe that Jun Wu Xie’s retaliation would just be this. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“You guys go back first. I’m going to the Serene Spirit Tower to have a look.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Qiao Chu could not hold himself back from jumping up and saying: “Bring me along! Bring me along!”

He really could not wait to see Jun Wu Xie to embark on destruction.

Jun Wu Xie swung her gaze over to Qiao Chu and she said coldly: “You so certain that after you go in there, Rolly will not be affected?” Jun Wu Xie dared to go, because the Spirit Tree’s seed had become a guarantee that even if she was to go there once again, she could be sure that the little black cat would not disappear.

But it was not the same with Qiao Chu and the others.

As expected, upon hearing Jun Wu Xie say that, Qiao Chu’s entire body made like a frost beaten eggplant, withering completely.

“Alright, you come back with me obediently to continue cultivating. Little Xie will be able to deal with her own things, and all we have to do is just to wait to watch the show.” It was rare for Hua Yao to utter such a big bunch of words where he then hooked his arm around Qiao Chu’s neck and dragged him away.

Qiao Chu was feeling rather depressed but with Hua Yao’s “appeasement”, he immediately perked up with vigor and howled about wanting to cultivate seriously as he went bumbling right behind Hua Yao to leave.

Fan Zhuo and the others exchanged a few more words with Jun Wu Xie before they similarly left.

Jun Wu Xie made her way towards the first Serene Spirit Tower, and the queue outside the Serene Spirit Tower continued to snake a long way out.

Jun Wu Xie drew in a deep breath and touched her own face, a helpless smile suddenly rising up upon it as she opened her stride to go walking over towards the guards at first Serene Spirit Tower.

The two human spirits standing in front of the Serene Spirit Tower looked bored as they gazed lazily upon the long lines before their eyes, the corners of their mouths twitching from time to time, seemingly feeling rather impatient.

Standing guard here for the whole day, they were finding it highly boring as they gazed around them. Suddenly, a peerlessly beautiful figure came gliding in within their line of sight.

They saw a young lady with a face of flawless beauty that was seemingly at quite a loss as she approached.

Although the number of human spirits in the Spirit World wasn’t all that small in number, but there were very few young and fair ladies. Having a young lady as pretty as a flower appearing before them so suddenly, it immediately caused the listless and dispirited guards to perk up. They immediately straightened their backs and tried their best to put on their most handsome and suave looks.

Jun Wu Xie’s face looked to be at a loss as she came up to the doors in front of the Serene Spirit Tower. Her appearance had immediately drawn the attention of the human spirits in the queue, the gazes of all the males attracted to Jun Wu Xie’s looks, where the dull and dry wait from being in the queue immediately evaporated.

“These two Big Brothers.....” Jun Wu Xie put on a timid look, her brows knitted together worriedly as she looked at the guards.

That one call of “Big Brother” had almost caused the bones of the two guards to turn to mush, with Jun Wu Xie’s voice sounding so gentle, causing the guards to become highly afraid their fierce looks might frighten the little beauty.

“Lady, is there anything we can help you with?” The two men stumbled over themselves to ask.

“I just moved here and am staying close by. I did not know that there would be so many people queing here. I have some matters to attend to later tonight so, can you..... allow me to go inside first?” Jun Wu Xie said looking visibly distressed, which almost melted the hearts of everyone there.

“Err.....” Even before such flawless beauty, the two guards did not dare to open the door of convenience just like that. Although they were reluctant, they had still hesitated.
