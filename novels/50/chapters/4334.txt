Before Bai Mo, the reason why he could openly challenge Nangong Lie was because there were no restrictions on the time and methods when challenging. Those who wanted to compete for the positions of Top Ten Experts could use all kinds of unscrupulous means, assassinations, poisoning, etc. But now, there was no chance of using them in the arena.

One of the top ten exponents today, the seventh-ranked Fang Jinghe, was a master at using poison. He was able to climb into the Top Ten that year, because using a large amount of poison, he poisoned a number of participants before the selection, including one of the Top Ten exponents at that time and killed him, giving himself an opportunity to ascend the ranks.

Although Fang Jinghe was also a strong exponent who possessed a Spirit Ring, he was not the strongest in that batch. But he had used this method to successfully get everything he wanted. Whoever entered the Top Ten, would have had the best resources to cultivate their own strength. Therefore, Fang Jinghe improved his power little by little over the next millennium.

If he did not resort to poison at the start, it was likely he would not have the ability to ascend to his current position.

Long Yao’s proclamation basically killed off anybody’s hopes of using non-conventional means to obtain victory, making the selections more fair, while increasing the level of competitiveness and savagery in the battles.

“If you understand everything, get lost.” Long Yao waved his hand impatiently, as if dismissing a group of flies.

In the arena, no one dared to have any dissatisfaction with Long Yao’s attitude, and could only withdraw obediently from the arena.

“This year’s trials will be a bit more interesting, but these changes should have no impact on you my Lord.” said Bai Zhu after listening to Long Yao’s words, while looking at Jun Wu Xie with a smile, never forgetting to be reverent.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Bai Zhu disinterestedly and got up to leave.

Of course, Bai Zhu who had no intention of avoiding suspicion, followed the steps of Jun Wu Xie.

“I say, Lord of White Night City, what do you mean by this?” said Fei Yan, who was on the side, with a frown on his face. How thick was Bai Zhu’s skin? Jun Wu Xie ignored him from beginning to end, but he was still shamelessly following her?

Bai Zhu did not think his actions were embarrassing at all, but said very matter of factly, “It’s rare to see my Lord and I have to apologize for past mistakes. I also ask my Lord to give me face, and accept my invitation to a meal.”

Jun Wu Xie looked at the smiling Bai Zhu and replied coldly, “There is no need.”

The smile on Bai Zhu’s face continued. “My Lord, don’t be in a rush to refuse. I know I’m wrong, and I know you do not rate my power highly. However since you will be participating in the selection, I have some information on the Top Ten exponents and I wonder if you could spare some time to look at it? ”

When Rong Ruo heard Bai Zhu’s words, she could not help but frown secretly. Bai Zhu was clever and knew what others needed. Jun Wu Xie was powerful and did not need Bai Zhu’s help. In the selection, she would eventually face the person from the Upper Realm, but before that, Jun Wu Xie must fight with his lackeys.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
