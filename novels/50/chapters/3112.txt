Chapter 3113 A Lady Who Is As Delicate As A Flower And As Exquisite as Jade

Because she was raised in the Jun household, Yue Ye was familiar with the people in the Ruilin Army in which there were many famous doctors besides Bai Xu, Mu Chen and Bai Yun. On account of her knowledge of medicine and blessings bestowed by Jun Wu Xie, she was counted amongst them.

When she was still young, most of the soldiers in the Ruilin Army took care of her as a little sister.

Her good character, in addition to her pretty face, made her the subject of attention and admiration from many soldiers. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What about Yue Ye?” Jun Wu Xie asked Han Zi Fei, not understanding her meaning.

“She isn’t a child anymore and previously, her grandfather had asked me to find her a suitable man. As her master, shouldn’t you put some effort into that as well?” Han Zi Fei chuckled.

“Mother can do as she pleases, I’m not an expert in this area.” Jun Wu Xie sounded a little impatient.

“Yes, Dumb Qiao and the rest are good candidates. Although they are a little older, it matters little since they are Gods and do not age. Why don’t you...” Han Zi Fei suggested.

But that made Jun Wu Xie not know whether to laugh or cry.

The few of them seemed even stranger than her own uncle.

Ever since Fei Yan had his appearance and eyesight restored after becoming a God, he only had eyes for Rong Ruo, who had also become a God.

And Qiao Chu and Hua Yao kept coming and going, not interacting with women.

Only Fan Zhuo seemed relatively normal but whenever he returned to the Lower Three Realms, he was holed up in the Feng Hua School to meet up with Fan Jin and the two brothers would talk for hours on end, there was no room for Jun Wu Xie to intervene.

Upon thinking about it, Jun Wu Xie could not think of any suitable candidates for Yue Ye.

Ye Mei and the rest had nary a romantic bone in their body and just kept doing their jobs of standing guard ever since they entered paradise.

After thinking for a long time, Jun Wu Xie suddenly thought of someone.

“Dumb Qiao and the rest may not be suitable, but Nangong Lie might be.”

“No!” the previously quiet Jun Qing suddenly made his voice heard.

“.....”

The hall fell silent and everyone in it turned to look at Jun Qing.

“Why not? We all know Nangong Lie and he is a good man, which is such a rarity in the Three Realms.” The more Han Zi Fei said, the more she felt Nangong Lie was suitable, seemingly not noticing that Jun Qing’s expression was turning sour.

He looked impatiently at his sister-in-law and stood up suddenly, saying, ” I’m going out for a walk.”

After finishing, he left without waiting for anyone to respond.

Jun Wu Xie was confused, “What’s wrong with uncle?”

Han Zi Fei suddenly laughed and had a mischievous glint in her eye, “What else could it be? The girl he raised has suddenly become a woman and about to be married off, your uncle...couldn’t take it.”
