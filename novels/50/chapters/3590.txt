Chapter 2185: Bloody Battle at the Summit of Mount Fu Yao (9)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

That strong barrier stirred up a huge gale as the little old man who stood at eye of it all stood there calmly. His white hair was bellowing in the wind as his sleeves were flapping about violently and he exuded a suffocating and domineering aura.

Ba He’s gaze suddenly changed and the smile at the corner of his mouth had disappeared entirely.

On the entire body of the little man, not a speck of light emitted from spiritual energy could be found. However, upon closer inspection, a circle of obscure inscriptions were rotating around his right hand. Those obscure inscriptions were floating above his palm but there was a pale blue glow on his palm.

The moment Ba He saw the inscriptions on the right hand of the little man, his expression underwent a sudden change? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This person, how could he be at such a level!

The little man looked coldly at Ba He who stood on the high platform and the gale blocked those black robed man from approaching. He suddenly flung his right hand out! The inscriptions that were rotating around his hand glowed and suddenly became even larger!

The little old man held onto one end of the inscription and the circle became a straight line as bolts of ice blue lightning danced above the inscriptions! The hand that he held onto the inscription swept around his surroundings at once!

The inscriptions with the lightning were like a soft sword that swept all around him! Surrounding the little old man now were many afterimages!

All the black robed men that were closest to the little old man were sent flying out one after another! The area that was hit directly by the lightning was charred black, and it was so deep that the bones were visible!

The battle situation in front of him suddenly changed and the Nine Temples disciples who were initially worried for him were left completely dumbfounded at the scene that had unfolded right in front of them.

Even if you beat them to death, they would have never imagined that under the heavens, there was actually someone who could use a single strike to injure a Gold Spirit so heavily. Gold Spirits were the highest level in the Middle Realm and just so easily...

And...it wasn’t just one Gold Spirit...it was one strike that had sent so many Gold Spirits flying! Just one strike!

They were Gold Spirits, mind you!

However, in front of the little old man, they lost the invisible power of the Gold Spirit and were beaten into such a sorry state without even the strength to retaliate!

The shocked Nine Temple disciples couldn’t find a trace of spiritual movement on the little old man. All they could see was the little old man use that lightning infused inscription to close in on the black robed men as he sent them flying one after another!

This incredulous scene made them completely stupefied!

What on earth was that little old man holding in his hands? It was so powerful!

Ba He’s expression was getting uglier and uglier by the moment and from above, he could see the entire battlefield clearly. The people only knew that the Gold Spirits were strong but they didn’t know that in the Upper Realms, there were people that were far stronger than them!

Just like the little old man in front of them.

Su Ya watched the little old man in a daze and even forgot to struggle for a moment. She had never seen her Master reveal his true power. Even if she was raised by him for many years, she did not know the extent of his strength and how terrible his actual strength was...

Until she saw him sending Gold Spirits flying one after another, she then realized that her Master was truly an extraordinary person.

Ba He saw that the situation had taken a turn and he immediately gave an eye signal to a black robed man that was standing below the platform.

“Stop!” Ba He’s voice reverberated throughout the square.

The Gold Spirits who surrounded the little old man immediately retreated back a few steps.

The little old man narrowed his eyes and his murderous aura was so oppressive that it made them shudder. He turned to look at Ba He but just that single glance made the blood in his whole body freeze!
