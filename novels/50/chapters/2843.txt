When Duan Qi noticed that Han Zi Fei had appeared, the smile on Duan Qi’s face grew faint. Up till now, Duan Qi has regarded Han Zi Fei as a malignant tumor of the Sacred Maiden Tribe and wanted her to leave the tribe sooner rather than later.

Han Zi Fei was not interested in Duan Qi’s intentions. At the moment her eyes met Jun Wu Xie’s, a slight smile was raised at the corner of her mouth. Her eyes soon swept past Jun Wu Xie and looked towards Duan Qi who was a little stiff.

“Elder Duan has been really busy these days. The Sacred Maiden Tribe hasn’t been so lively in a while. With so many banquets hosted, it must be difficult to manage.” Han Zi Fei looked at Duan Qi with a smile.

Duan Qi’s brow furrowed as the ridicule in Han Zi’s remarks made her very unhappy. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I thank the Sacred Maiden for her concern. With so many guests visiting our Sacred Maiden Tribe, it is a happy event. In addition, our Sacred Maiden will marry Lord Jun Gu in two days’ time. One is our Sacred Maiden, the other is one of the Knights of Destruction, both parties are of such precious people. Naturally, we will spare no expense and put in all our efforts to prepare. As for Sacred Maiden, you will meet Lord Jun Gu today, I wonder if you have prepared?” Duan Qi questioned.

Han Zi Fei shrugged slightly and said casually, “Isn’t he just another man? What’s there to prepare?”

“...” Duan Qi’s lips twitched slightly, she couldn’t really take Han Zi Fei’s casual nature.

Jun Wu Xie watched Han Zi Fei tease Duan Qi silently, she would have to say that... she was getting reacquainted with the Senior Zi Fei of the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

The perception of Han Zi Fei was of someone who was stable and gentle, but it was unexpected to find out that she had such a poisonous tongue after she had returned to the Sacred Maiden Tribe. When she returned to the Sacred Maiden, she had let Duan Qi and Han Shu suffer numerous losses, and they couldn’t even express their dissatisfaction, they could only suppress their anger within their hearts.

“It is inappropriate for Sacred Maiden to speak about Lord Jun Gu in this manner, isn’t it?” Han Shu’s arrival at the hall went unnoticed, and she had managed to only catch Han Zi Fei’s words. She automatically walked to Jun Wu Xie’s side, giving Jun Wu Xie what she thought was an extremely sweet smile.

“City Lord Yan.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly.

After Han Shu took up her position, she looked at Han Zi Fei from head to toe complete with disapproval radiating from her eyes.

Today’s Han Zi Fei was also very casually dressed, with no trace of makeup on her face, just like how she was normally in the tribe. It was hard to believe that there was a woman who would dress so perfunctorily, on an important occasion such as meeting her fiance for the first time.

However, whatever Han Zi Fei did was not of any importance to Han Shu. In fact, she’d prefer Han Zi Fei to dress even more perfunctory and half-heartedly, this would surely cause Lor Gu to have some displeasure with her.

“Lord Jun Gu, as one of the Knights of Destruction, is naturally superior to others. Since this marriage was requested by Sacred Maiden to His Lord, it must be taken seriously. Otherwise, won’t it cause others to think that we are a joke and that our Sacred Maiden Tribe do not know hospitality and manners?” Han Shu looked at Han Zi Fei with a snide smile.

Han Zi Fei glanced at Han Shu and chuckled: “It’s really a shame, even if I’m old and haggard, Lord Jun Gu will have to marry me, after all, this is His Lord’s order.”

What Han Zi Fei had said was certainly because she was secure in the knowledge that she had backing, and it made Han Shu’s expression, who had originally wanted to provoke her, change immediately.

Indeed, no one dared to defy the betrothal when His Lord ordered it. Even if Han Zi Fei was an ugly-ass monster, Lord Jun Gu could only bite the gun and marry her.
