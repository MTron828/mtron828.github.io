Chapter 2819: Han Zi Fei (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie’s side has calmed down, but Duan Qi, who was travel-worn, returned to the residence of the Sacred Maiden Tribe with a gloomy face.

Han Shu and others followed behind Duan Qi carefully. Anyone could see that Duan Qi was not in a good mood at this moment.

Duan Qi was an elder of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. In the Upper Realm, she could have anything she wanted. But upon meeting Jun Wu Xie, she hasn’t gotten her way. And with her temperament, for Duan Qi to tolerate till now, that was very rare.

The women in the hall saw Duan Qi and bowed to her politely, but Duan Qi spared little thought and did not respond to them, as she walked into the hall in a great huff.

“Elder Duan.” A woman with a beautiful face stood in the hall, looking curiously at a somber Duan Qi.

“Elder Yun.” Duan Qi looked at the person but was reluctant to say more.

This person was also an elder of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Although she was not as high ranking as Duan Qi, she was also a very important person. Even if Duan Qi has any great unhappiness, she would not reveal it to Elder Yun.

“I heard Elder Duan came back this time and seemed to have brought some guests. I wonder who the person is for Elder Duan to personally invite him back?” Elder Yun said with a smile.

Duan Qi’s somber expression grew dark again. When she thought about Jun Wu Xie’s expressionless face, she felt very chilled.

“He is the new City Lord of Sea Spirit City, Yan Hai..” Duan Qi told Elder Yun, as she narrated what happened before to Elder Yun.

Elder Yun’s face suddenly appeared incredulous.

“Dual Spirit Rings? Is this true?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Duan Qi nodded, “If it isn’t true, why would I bring him back? But this kid is very capable, thus he is quite arrogant. He doesn’t care about soft or hard approaches so if we want him to agree with our request, then we will have to put in a lot of effort. I have already given instructions to prepare a welcome banquet for tonight. I will have the outstanding women in our tribe attend as well. I don’t believe this kid will have his eyes in the sky, with so many pretty ladies in attendance, he will really not be attracted to anyone?”

Elder Yun had not calmed down from the shock of the dual Spirit Ring. But looking at the unhappy Duan Qi, she knew that Duan Qi had suffered a lot of indignity.

But, only the Sacred Maiden Tribe ...

“It’s not difficult, but if you really want to entice him, then you must take this very seriously. Do you want Han Zi Fei to attend the banquet tonight?” Elder Yun slightly hesitated.

“Her?” Duan Qi frowned suddenly.

“How is she doing?”

“Everything is fine, this time it looks like she’s changed her temperament. She’s been very obedient. Perhaps it’s because she has drifted outside for so many years, suffered greatly, and finally is enlightened. She is after all our Sacred Maiden, even though she had made mistakes, before the arrival of the new Sacred Maiden, we also cannot hurt her. Moreover, His Lord has betrothed her to Lord Gu, so I think she has calmed down. “Elder Yun said with a hint of knowing.

After Duan Qi was silent for a moment, she said, “Well, if she had mended her ways, we can let bygones be bygones. Send someone to inform her that there will be a banquet tonight.”

Elder Yun nodded with a smile. She glanced at Han Shu, who was behind Duan Qi, and immediately said, “Han Shu, since you are Han Zi Fei’s sister, and you will convey the news.”

Han Shu was a little shocked and her entire back stiffened. But, she didn’t dare to have the slightest expression of resistance, and could only obey:

“Yes, Han Shu will do as instructed.”
