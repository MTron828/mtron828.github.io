Chapter 2489: A Bloody Hunt (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

This inhuman place really horrified people.

Not yet reaching the Upper Realm, within the hearts of Qiao Chu and others, there was already a deep dislike of the place.

The ocean was calm, there was no wind or waves.

Perhaps the rules of the Upper Realm were too horrible as Qiao Chu and the rest did not ask about anything else regarding the Upper Realm thereafter.

The big ship continued to move forward in the sea of death. After experiencing several storms and before they knew it, half a month had passed.

Rong Ruo began suffer from seasickness. Fortunately, there was Jun Wu Xie and the medicinal pills she provided helped, but she dared not stay in the cabin again. She could only sit on the deck and enjoyed the sea breeze.

Fei Yan followed her silently, like every day for the past five years.

Rong Ruo might have been intentionally or unintentionally avoiding him, but Fei Yan pretended to be ignorant, as he continued to follow after her.

Looking at Rong Ruo’s pale face as she leaned against the deck, it’s inevitable that Fei Yan was a little panicked, but there was nothing much he could do.

“Are you feeling better? If not... Shall I ask Little Xie to bring you some medicine?” Fei Yan asked carefully, unable to conceal the concern in his eyes.

The youth from the past had grown up, he transformed into a tall and handsome adult. However that look of worry upon his brow made one unable to bear.

Rong Ruo looked at Fei Yan whose expression was so helpless. No matter how deliberately she alienated him in the past five years, Fei Yan was so persistent, such that she was at her wits end. She shook her head silently, but this had not happened before, Rong Ruo doesn’t know what was going on, but the sudden dizziness appeared in these couple of days.

Fei Yan didn’t dare to disturb Rong Ruo further as he looked at her pale face and could only feel sorry for her silently.

Suddenly, a faint scent of blood drifted to their noses.

In an instant, their nerves were raised.

Rong Ruo stood up, her brows were wrinkled, Fei Yan also came over.

The odor of blood was very light, it drifted from the bow of the ship. From a distance, across the dark sea, inky blackness suddenly spread. Instantaneously, an ominous premonition arose within the two people’s hearts.

“Quickly find Brother Wu Yao and Little Xie!” Rong Ruo immediately instructed.

Fei Yan did not dare to delay a moment longer and immediately turned towards the ship’s cabin.

As the ship progressed, the inky blackness gradually approached, but it was not black at all, the sea surface was actually stained with blood, icy cold seeping through the darkness.

Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie arrived quickly on the deck, followed by Hao Yao and the rest.

A group of people stood at the bow as they looked at the blood pervading the sea’s surface. That disgusting smell of blood had become even stronger.

Rong Ruo, who was already unwell, retched a few times as the smell of blood invaded her senses and caused her stomach to tumble violently.

“What is that?” Qiao Chu’s eyes widened as he stared at the bloody scene. More than half a month of sailing, it was pretty peaceful. But who would have thought that in such a vast ocean, there would be such a large amount of blood spreading widely, almost covering what they could see of the sea’s surface.

Jun Wu Yao squinted his eyes. On the surface of the sea covered by blood, he could see a huge floating object. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At a glance, Jun Wu Yao opened his mouth to speak.

“It’s the Sea Spirit Beast.”

“What?” Everyone was shocked.

“The people from Upper Realm were hunting for the Sea Spirit Beast, their ship should have sailed through here not too long ago.” Jun Wu Yao half squinted as he replied.

“The people from Upper Realm....” Qiao Chu and the others silently took a deep breath. If they had a single perception of the cruelty of the Upper Realm before, then everything that appeared in front of them would have made them realize that... the madness of the Upper Realm.
