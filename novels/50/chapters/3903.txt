Chapter 2499: A Safe Haven（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The cloud of light extended in front of everyone’s eyes. Behind the darkness was a world of its own!

It was a large underwater cave, supported by a huge halo, as if it was an arcadia existing in the bottom of the sea. There were many small little pale green creatures rolling and playing on the seabed that was fully covered with seaweed. With just a glance, the picture had immediately rendered everyone stunned.

There was almost a hundred little Sea Spirit Beasts gathering in this underwater world, playing and fooling around with each other while a few adult Sea Spirit Beasts were quietly lying on the ground, looking fondly and gently at those little things.

“Here is...” Rong Ruo was amazed by the scene in front of her.

With a trace of a smile gleaming in her eyes, the woman turned around and said. “Welcome to the haven of the Sea Spirit Beasts.”

All the Sea Spirit Beasts were resting peacefully in the supported underwater world. The eyes of the little Sea Spirit Beast which was being carried in Rong Ruo’s arms began to glint the moment it saw its fellow comrades. Its four little claws kept on scratching, trying to get itself down.

Hurriedly, Rong Ruo put it down.

The moment it landed on the ground, the small little thing straight off swished towards its comrades.

“I was quite worried at first when I noticed that someone had come to the island. I felt relieved after I saw you guys treated the little Sea Spirit Beast well and it was until the moment I saw Lord Ye Jue that I realized that you guys aren’t my enemies.” The woman turned her body and looked at them.

It was an accident that she brought them here but she did not regret it. She could feel their care towards the little Sea Spirit Beast. She had even heard their conversation just now when they were at the coastal without missing a word. Since they were worried about the survival of the little Sea Spirit Beast, she would give them the answer then.

“There’s actually such a place... This is amazing...” Qiao Chu widened his eyes, admiring the magical underwater world. There was a layer of invisible force isolating the paradise from the sea water. Take a look around, the ocean was so clear and distinct. Under the illumination of the halo, the sea around them became much brighter, expanding the area that was visible. There were schools of fish swimming in the ocean, as if they were just within their reach.

Jun Wu Yao let Jun Wu Xie down so that she was able to enjoy the miraculous underwater world.

“No wonder you are able to get the spirit core of the Sea Spirit Beast,” said Jun Wu Yao suddenly.

The woman just slightly nodded her head.

The Sea Spirit Beast was a unique marine life. With the special body structure it had, it stayed between the spirit life and the living thing. Every matured Sea Spirit Beast would condense a spirit core in their bodies. It was said that the spirit core was the most valuable treasure of the Sea Spirit Beast and it had once caused the people from the Upper Realm to crazily think of getting it.

However, the Sea Spirit Beasts had a special characteristic. When they found out that they were in danger and that the fate of getting killed was awaiting them, the first thing they would do was to shatter the spirit cores inside their bodies. Once the spirit core in the Sea Spirit Beast was broken, it would then be absorbed into the body of the Sea Spirit Beast a few moments later. Therefore, it was almost impossible for the Upper Realm to get the spirit core. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was exactly because of the preciousness of the spirit core, the effect it showed in one’s body was remarkably fabulous. Whether if it was used in recuperation or soul treatment, the effect it showed was exceedingly strong. It was said to be one of the most valuable treasures that the Upper Realm could ever dream of.

“Those spirit cores are left by the Sea Spirit Beasts that have already passed away. If it wasn’t for these cores, I wouldn’t be able to live till today. I was badly injured that year when I escaped from the Upper Realm. I was ready to die the moment I fell into the sea, but I wouldn’t have thought that I would be saved by the Sea Spirit Beasts. They are my saviors.” While looking at those Sea Spirit Beasts gently, the woman narrated slowly.
