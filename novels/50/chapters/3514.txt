“Jun Wu Xie, you really shouldn’t be standing on the Beast Spirits’ side. With your intelligence and capability, if you are to help me, I can give you everything that you could ever want.” Wu Jiu said temptingly.

Jun Wu Xie snorted derisively and replied: “Everything I can ever want? Including having you dead?”

Wu Jiu was taken aback a moment, before immediately recovering to place the smile back on his face. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You are still being too naive. Do you really think just one Spiritual Bear is all that important? Not to mention just one Spiritual Bear, even if it is the entire Spirit World, or the whole of the Middle Realm, so what? Compared to the three realms, it is so insignificant, and just utterly pathetic. If just by making a little bit of a sacrifice, you come to gain bigger and unmatched power, what does it matter?”

“You are thinking to absorb power of the spirit from the Spirit Fire?” Jun Wu Xie faintly detected a little of Wu Jiu’s evil intentions.

However, Wu Jiu shook his head.

Regardless whether it is in the Lower Realm, Middle Realm, or Upper Realm, even the strongest person among all has a certain limit he can reach. But if there is a way to break through that limit, what will that bring for the future? That is something that you cannot even begin to imagine. Your sights are set too narrowly. It’s just a tiny little sacrifice and you already cannot accept it. That has doomed you to be unable to achieve great things. You will never be able to experience just how magnificent a feat it is to shatter through void!”

“Shatter through void?” Jun Wu Xie repeated as she looked at Wu Jiu. She was hearing those words for the first time but she detected that everything that Wu Jiu was doing was linked to those three words.

“That transcends all power in this world, to become a true god.” Wu Jiu’s eyes were flashing with a fiery fervour.

Jun Wu Xie did not say anything more as she knew, even if she was to continue asking, Wu Jiu would not tell her anything more about that. She then shifted the topic. “So, you used shattering the void to draw in the Spirit Lord?”

Wu Jiu shook his head, his gaze shifting slightly to glance towards the cell opposite Jun Wu Xie.

Under that dim firelight, Jun Wu Xie saw a young child locked up within that shadowy cell. He seemed to be unconscious, and not only his four limbs were shackled by the Soul Binding Chains, but there were two more chains shackled around his waist and neck, and the Soul Binding Chains were at least double the thickness of the Soul Binding Chains on Jun Wu Xie.

“That’s it. I’ve already said enough to you. I’ll advise that you enjoy the final moments you have as..... you do not have all that much time left to be alive.” Wu Jiu said as he stood up, seeming like he did not have anything more to say to Jun Wu Xie, slowly walking away to leave.

Jun Wu Xie’s brows furrowed tightly together, as the situation before her could be said to be extremely bad.

She tried to summon out Little Lotus and Poppy from inside her soul but there was no effect at all after several attempts. The Soul Binding Chains had not only sealed her power of the spirit, it had also trapped Little Lotus and the others within her soul, unable to break free.

After attempting a few more times, she finally gave up. With the state she was in, she wasn’t even able to use her power of the spirit to fabricate a metal wire to undo the Soul Binding Chains.

The only thing she had on her was the little awl and though that awl was small, to the keyhole in the Soul Binding Chain, it was slightly too big.

She was at the end of her tethers.

The only thing that was still fortunate was that she knew Qiao Chu and her other companions were currently not in any immediate danger. Wu Jiu had already stated his motives very clearly and he was keeping them for the Spirit Fire to absorb them, so they would at least still be safe temporarily.

Although they would be safe for the moment, but it would be a calamity for Brownie!

Having finally captured Brownie after so much trouble, Wu Jiu would not give up on his original plan. It wouldn’t be long before Brownie would surely be brought to the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, to undergo the same agony he had gone through before.
