Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Being single for more than 20 years, Qiao Chu and others, just after recognizing Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu, the little surging in their hearts has not stopped. Now they had Bai Mo, they were naturally overjoyed.

“Call your head! If you don’t want to die, get out quickly!” Bai Mo had completely lost his temper. Even if Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie oppressed him, he knew that he really couldn’t beat them. But these five little ghosts who didn’t even have a Spirit Ring dare to oppress him, it was so unbearable!

Bai Mo’s roar made Qiao Chu and others stunned momentarily.

Seeing that Qiao Chu and others’ expressions had changed, Bai Mo sneered with satisfaction, but did not expect ...

“Brother Wu Yao! Your son is no longer obedient again !!!” Qiao Chu shouted out.

That roar was so loud that it stunned Bai Mo completely.

Although...

He didn’t know the origin of the name Brother Wu Yao but he knew that that was how he addressed the demon king. Qiao Chu had clearly heard that. This roar made Bai Mo sweat heavily in an instant.

“Brother Wu Yao, do you want to come ...” Qiao Chu shouted at Jun Wu Yao, who was facing the wall, in a serious manner.

However, before he said this, a small face slammed into his squatting knee.

“Uncle!!!” Bai Mo almost squeezed these two words out of his teeth gap!

Threatened by a young boy who was merely at the Gold Spirit Pinnacle ... Bai Mo had never been so humiliated in his life.

“Sigh! Yes, this is correct!” Qiao Chu ended with satisfaction and rubbed Bai Mo’s head with pride. He gave an extremely happy smile!

However, Bai Mo could only gnash his teeth and endure it.

With Qiao Chu’s lesson learned, Fei Yan and the others who were eager not to be left behind. Bai Mo could only bear a grieved face, shouting numbly.

In his heart, it was already full of scars.

He swore, as long as he regained his freedom, he would! !! !! !!

Run far away! Don’t ever see this group of people again in this life! !!

When Jun Wu Yao took Jun Wu Xie into his dreamland, Bai Mo was tossed around by Qiao Chu and others all night. The next day when Jun Wu Yao opened the door and was ready to meet his cheap son, he saw Bai Mo lying on the ground with two huge dark circles. He looked at Jun Wu Yao with a sad expression.

Jun Wu Yao raised his eyebrows slightly and turned his heels as if he hadn’t seen anything. He took Jun Wu Xie behind him directly into his arms and walked downstairs.

“It’s still early today, go to breakfast first.” Jun Wu Yao’s voice was full of infinite tenderness, but it was all for Jun Wu Xie.

Bai Mo was locked in the empty room again. He was crying and feeling hungry.

When Nangong Lie came to the restaurant with a gift, he was ready to express his gratitude to Jun Wu Xie for helping each other yesterday. He happened to see Bai Mo stepping down from the restaurant with his exhaustion and embarrassment. He walked obediently towards a chair beside Jun Wu Yao and sat down.

This weird scene really amused Nangong Lie.

Looking at Bai Mo, who was sitting honestly next to Jun Wu Yao and eating in silence. Nangong Lie seriously doubted that the person who provoked himself in public yesterday was this fellow!

Just one night that they had not met, Bai Mo looked like a completely different person!
