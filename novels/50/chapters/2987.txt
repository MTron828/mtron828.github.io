Chapter 2988 Strange Ying 1

“But ...” Su Ruiying stared at Jun Wu Xie and then suddenly said: “With your strength, as long as your brain is good enough, he should not be able to do anything to you.”

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Su Ruiying. In fact, even if Long Yao didn’t take the initiative to come to her, she would go to Long Yao. For Rong Ruo, the blood debt with Long Yao was not over yet!

“Chi Yan doesn’t like to be disturbed by others, and it’s not too late at this time. Is Lord Yan interested to come into my manor for a moment?” Su Ruiying suddenly extended an invitation to Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie had some questions about removing one’s memory, so she followed Su Ruiying along with Jun Wu Yao. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jun Wu Xie had finally met all four Knights of Destruction today. None of them were ordinary figures. Chi Yan was just sitting quietly tonight. However, it gave people a strong sense of suppression. Their strength was not weak and even the usually arrogant Long Yao had to converge in front of him. It was known that he was strong. Long Yao was completely suppressed.

The Su Ruiying in front of her gave Jun Wu Xie a very strange feeling. Under the moonlight, she watched Su Ruiying’s gradually elongated shadow. But she did not hear any sound from her.

It was as if she did not even exist; no footsteps and no breath. Her breath was so weak that it was almost undetectable. This point, Jun Wu Xie was already aware of it when she was at the banquet. When it really seemed to be a dead person, there were no fluctuations in the tone when speaking, which made Jun Wu Xie have a familiar feeling.

It seemed that she had returned to her previous life, back to the period of time she was held in the same room with the dead bodies.

However, Su Ruiying walked vividly before her, this strange feeling, Jun Wu Xie really did not know where it came from.

The Sacred City at night was quiet, and the area where Chi Yan was located was sparsely populated. On the large streets, there were only Jun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Yao and Su Ruiying walking in front.

Somehow, Su Ruiying’s footsteps stopped suddenly. Under the moonlight, her figure looked a little gloomy. She turned her head, and the cross scar on her face seemed to be contrary to the eye-catching. It seemed to be laughing.

“Lord Yan, do you value your followers?”

Jun Wu Xie shook slightly and pretended to be calm on her face: “Is there any problem?”

Su Ruiying said with a smile: “According to the rules, today’s banquet only invited you alone. But you have brought him along. To become a Knight of Destruction, you need to be cut off from the past. This had been said by Chi Yan just now. And all those who know about your past will also be killed shortly afterwards. Like this follower by your side, who has heard all the words from the start.”

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly. Jun Wu Yao touched her gently from behind without a trace.

“However ... you can keep him. You can develop him into an accursed and he can continue to stay by your side and serve. As for the others in your city, I’m afraid I can’t keep them.” Su Ruiying smiled, as if thinking of something happy. The thing that was normal was her red lips, as if she was about to bleed with her smile.

It seems that endless death could bring her great happiness.
