Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly, and then his eyes moved away from Duan Qi.

“Then I think, I have made my choice.”

When Jun Wu Xie said this, her eyes passed over Han Shu, who was standing in front of her, intentionally or unintentionally. Even the slightest glance had made Han Shu almost want to scream.

Jun Wu Xie stood up and walked out of her seat. At this moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on her. Everyone knew that Jun Wu Xie was going to announce whom she had chosen.

Almost everyone thought that the person whom Jun Wu Xie was going to choose would Han Shu, who had been devoted and diligent.

Even Duan Qi and Han Shu thought so.

Jun Wu Xie stepped out and stood a little in front of Han Shu. Those cold eyes glanced over Han Shu’s body, and Han Shu had already taken an excited step forward towards Jun Wu Xie!

However...

The moment Han Shu wanted to step forward, Jun Wu Xie’s footsteps suddenly passed by Han Shu.

The moment she passed by, Han Shu froze. She stared, unable to believe that Jun Wu Xie had passed by her ... This simple action meant ... The person was not her!

Han Shu’s eyes were full of shock. She turned around suddenly and looked at Jun Wu Xie unwillingly. She did not believe that Jun Wu Xie did not choose her!

This action of Jun Wu Xie made all the people in the hall hold their breath, as no one thought that the person whom Jun Wu Xie finally liked was not actually Han Shu?

Thinking about Han Shu’s devotion to Jun Wu Xie before, and looking at the present series of things, it seemed like a ruthless slap hard across Han Shu’s face. Her triumph was shattered in an instant.

Han Shu had no chance, but other women now rekindled their hopes. They prayed that they could become the lucky person , staring at Jun Wu Xie’s back unwillingly for a moment.

However, Jun Wu Xie’s footsteps stopped at a table in the corner.

When everyone saw who was sitting at the table in front of Jun Wu Xie, everyone froze.

How could it be her?!!

Yan Xi’s mind had already flown out the hall. She had thought that after leaving the Scared Maiden Tribe, Han Zi Fei would be removed by the most vicious witchcraft. She had not noticed that someone came to her table.

“You’re called Yan Xi?” A slightly indifferent voice drifted into Yan Xi’s ears, as her head shot up at the sound of the voice, suddenly seeing Jun Wu Xie, who was the guest of honour for tonight, standing in front of her.

Yan Xi was suddenly dumbfounded as she looked at the handsome boy in front of her. She had heard about this person from Duan Qi before. She knew that he was the honoured guest of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, and he was the person who would most likely be the one who would have a marriage with the next Sacred Maiden with one of the tribe members, however, why did this person approach her?

Yan Xi only knew something about Jun Wu Xie’s strength. She knew that Jun Wu Xie was a strong exponent who possessed Dual Spirit Rings, except, no matter how strong that person was, was none of her concern. She was already assigned to stay by Lord Jun Gu’s side.

Yan Xi was full of intolerance but she didn’t let it show. She could only say, “Yes, my name is Yan Xi.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. In the silence, she turned abruptly and looked at an astonished Duan Qi and said, “Elder Duan, the person I choose is her, Yan Xi.”
