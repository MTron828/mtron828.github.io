Nalan Shan sighed. Even though Jun Wu Xie had said that, he still felt rather bad about it.

“There’s no need to continue to harp on all this. The construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower has suddenly sped up recently. Have you ever encountered such a situation before?” Jun Wu Xie said, revealing the main purpose she had come to find Nalan Shan.

Nalan Shan’s face turned to one of shock and he quickly shook his head to say: “Never before. The construction of the three Serene Spirit Towers before was done without any interruption from beginning till end. Only for this fourth Serene Spirit Tower had the construction slowed down midway, and it was caused Brownie’s escape.”

Jun Wu Xie then said: “I suspect that Wu Jiu has something up his sleeve.”

“Who do you mean?”

“If building the fourth Serene Spirit Tower did not require the Spiritual Bear, then why had he suddenly slowed down the construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower after the Spiritual Bear went missing? He has suddenly sped it up now but Brownie has not been caught by them. There must be some other reason behind this that gives him no choice but to speed it up.” Jun Wu Xie opened her mouth to say. This was a problem she had been thinking about for quite a while but as she was not all that familiar with the Spirit World, Jun Wu Xie had been stuck in many instances when she needed to make her deductions accurately.

“In that case.....” Nalan Shan fell deep in thought as well. From what he understood of Wu Jiu, Wu Jiu was definitely not a person that would change his original plans for no good reason. But as for what Wu Jiu’s intentions were now, he was not able to judge accurately immediately.

“We came here this time, on one hand, is to look at how all of you are doing, and secondly, we are thinking of going into the fourth Serene Spirit Tower to see what the situation is inside. Now that the Serene Spirit Tower is in such a sudden need for manpower, it provides us with a good chance to investigate.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Nalan Shan was a little worried. But when he saw how determined Jun Wu Xie was, he felt that there was nothing much he could say, but to remind Jun Wu Xie that she must act with utmost caution, to never stay in there for too long, and that she must immediately leave the moment she finds the situation taking a bad turn.

As the fourth Serene Spirit Tower’s construction need to be sped up, that requirement needed a large increase in the number of human spirits. Jun Wu Xie and the others took barely any effort before they all passed the entry requirements, to quickly go into the fourth Serene Spirit Tower’s construction site, as they started to work.

Jun Wu Xie and the companions, together with a bunch of human spirits who had just joined, were led by a man. They were allocated to a place where it was filled with bricks. Judging from the size of those bricks, it could be seen that the Serene Spirit Tower would be built with these bricks. But compared to the bricks used in the other Serene Spirit Towers, the surface of these bricks were smooth and neat, where it was clear that they did not have any runes carved into them yet.

“What all of you need to do is to follow these symbols here, and carve them into these stone bricks one by one, and then place them aside according to sequence.” The man in charge said, giving the newcomers their orders. Building up the Serene Spirit Tower itself would not require too many human spirits, but as every single brick required a corresponding rune to be carved into them, it required a lot of time. The runes needed to be carved into the bricks by hand and could not be substituted by bricks that were made with the power of the spirit.

The tools for the carving was a awl, and everyone was given one. The shape of the rune that they were to carve was then distributed to all the human spirits there. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The instant that Jun Wu Xie was given the awl, she had immediately detected there was something slightly abnormal about it. She could sense a faint trace of some power of the spirit within the small awl, and the kind of power of the spirit was not steady and stable like it should feel after an item had been created, but felt to be rather lively.

After the man in charge relayed his instructions, he then left. Everyone else each picked up a brick, and sat down on the ground to begin carving slowly the rune they had been allocated
