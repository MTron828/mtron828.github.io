Chapter 3020 Punitive expedition 2

“The two are indispensable. If you are not capable, you cannot be a Knight of Destruction. If you are strong, you can’t be a Knight of Destruction without loyalty to His Lord too. Do you understand?”Jun Gu looked at Jun Wu Xie indifferently. In a few words, he successfully polished the sharp words of Jun Wu Xie.

Chi Yan’s expression eased slightly.

Jun Wu Xie understood her father’s thoughts. In this case, she was going to use Chi Yan’s anger to shut him down. Unexpectedly, her father had said it in advance. That saved her a lot of trouble.

Jun Wu Xie followed Jun Gu’s words and said, “If this is the case, I don’t think that with Long Yao’s strength, he is worthy of the title of Knight of Destruction. Fighting me, he can’t even withstand a hundred strokes. With this capability, what right does he have to earn His Lord’s favour?”

Jun Gu was relieved. He almost gave his daughter a thumbs up.

Chi Yan was a lonely man with an arrogant personality. There was one thing that no one can surpass.

That was loyalty to His Lord.

Among the four members of the Knights of Destruction, only Chi Yan was the most loyal to His Lord. All actions were subject to His Lord’s will. He did not care about the things around him.

When Jun Wu Xie mentioned His Lord, naturally, the anger in Chi Yan’s heart ceased.

“Long Yao is as useless as it really is, and this result is also his own fault.” Chi Yan finally relaxed.

On one side, Su Ruiying swallowed her saliva secretly. Chi Yan treated His Lord wholeheartedly. She may not have noticed that although Chi Yan could not take a hundred strokes from her, what was Jun Wu Xie’s strength? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

That was the true strength of a Dual Spirit Ring exponent!

Not to mention Long Yao, even among the other Knights of Destruction, the only person who could withstand the hundred strokes from Jun Wu Xie was only Chi Yan. Besides Long Yao, she and Jun Gu had to make way.

Su Ruiying was afraid to mention these remarks to Jun Wu Xie. As long as Jun Wu Xie did not target her, she wished Jun Wu Xie ignored her existence completely.

“But ...” Chi Yan’s words suddenly turned, his sharp eyes looked at Jun Wu Xie again.

“No matter how useless Long Yao is, he is still a member of the Knight of Destruction . You killed him. This matter is undoubtedly. I have reported it to His Lord. His Lord has given his order. In three days time, he will be seeing you in person. At that time, it is for me to say and how His Lord will decide. ”

“His Lord wants to see me?” Jun Wu Xie was stunned. She did not expect this.

“Yes.” Chi Yan nodded. “How to deal with you, I have no right to ask, only His Lord can decide.”

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly, she didn’t expect that her revenge on Long Yao would drag the one who was hiding behind the scenes so quickly.

Years of planning were just to bring that person down.

And the first opportunity to face up to that person was three days later!

Jun Wu Xie forcibly suppressed the emotions in her heart and remained calm on her face. She said lightly: “Because it is the will of His Lord, I should obey and three days later, I will definitely meet His Lord in person!”

This meeting would herald the drumming of the decisive battle!
