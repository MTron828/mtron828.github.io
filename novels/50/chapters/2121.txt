“Regret? Why would I regret it? Just because of a piece of trash like you and that worthless Spirit Lord? Hahaha.....” The fake Spirit Lord laughed even more arrogantly.

“What if you include us as well?” A voice suddenly rose up within the grand hall.

Several figures suddenly came walking into the grand hall. It was Qiao Chu and the other companions. Besides them, there were Flame Dragon, Poison Ivy, Drunk Lotus and Poppy who came walking out together with them.

Flame Dragon stood right at the back, its gargantuan body slipping into the immense hall, magnificent like an insurmountable high.mountain.

Qiao Chu and the companions came over to stand beside Jun Wu Xie, standing by her shoulders and those of the Spirit Lord.

“I’ve seen shamelessness, but never one as despicable as this. As a dove occupying the magpie’s nest, he’s still being so thick skinned I am left gasping in amazement. Does he really think he is peerlessly unmatched under the Heavens?” Qiao Chu said with a sneer as he looked at the fake Spirit Lord and Wu Jiu.

“You can’t blame them for being overconfident. You must understand that they have not seen much of the world you know?” Fei Yan chirped in from the side, sounding like he was explaining the situation, but the sarcasm in his words could not be any clearer.

“All of you have been rescued as well as I have thought.” Wu Jiu said as he narrowed his eyes, to look at the people before him. He was naturally able to recognize them, as he had almost fallen into their hands. How could he possibly be able to forget all that humiliation?

“We would naturally have to be here, or I would not be able to admire the scene where the scums here suffer a fate that’s worse than death. That would be such a pity.” Qiao Chu said highly fearlessly.

The gazes of Flame Dragon and Poison Ivy had been locked upon the figure of the genuine Spirit Lord all this time where Poison Ivy then suddenly took a step forward to kneel before the Spirit Lord.

“Your subordinate Poison Ivy had not been able to discover Wu Jiu’s wicked intentions earlier and have caused the Spirit Lord to undergo so much suffering. Your subordinate has been sorely incompetent!”

Flame Dragon lowered its enormous head, similarly exhibiting remorse and guilt.

If not for Jun Wu Xie’s rescue of the Spirit Lord, how could they have imagined that the most supreme Spirit Lord of their hearts had been held in captivity by Wu Jiu for a hundred long years! ? And in that one hundred years, the Spirit Lord’s position had actually be occupied by such a despicable scoundrel.

“Flame Dragon is guilty, and I beg for the Spirit Lord to mete out punishment.”

The moment they saw the Spirit Lord, they immediately realized that the Spirit Lord had not changed in those one hundred years, but that the one who had been thought to have lost his equitability was not their Spirit Lord at all!

“Get up. This has nothing to do with both of you. I was a bad judge of people myself, and the fault does not lie with you. The thing that has caused the Spirit World to suffer such great losses is my fault.” The Spirit Lord said with a sigh. How could he possibly blame anyone else? Everything that was happening today, weren’t they all irrefutable proof of his very own incompetence?

“Are all of you done with the blabbering? All of you are about to die anyway, is there even any use of saying all that?” Wu Jiu said sneeringly, staring at Flame Dragon and Poison Ivy.

Flame Dragon raised its head, and glared angrily at Wu Jiu.

“Wu Jiu! As a member of the Spirit World, you betrayed the trust the Spirit Lord had in you, and committed such a vicious and unpardonable crime that brought harm to so many spirits, inciting conflict among the various races. I, Flame Dragon hereby vow, that you and I will not coexist in this life!”

“Tch! Against you?” Wu Jiu did not show the slightest bit of fear, his face filled with utter contempt, as his gaze swept over Jun Wu Xie and the rest of them.

“I had been think how you two rats would have the guts to come make noise here. It seems that you’ve gathered yourself quite a number of helpers. But..... with a whole bunch of losers who had been defeated by my Lord, even gathered together, what kind of a stir will you be able to kick up? You are all merely seeking to be humiliated once again! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Alright, since all of you are being so obstinate, I will not spare you any more chances.” Wu Jiu narrowed his eyes, and suddenly raised his hands to clap his hands together.
