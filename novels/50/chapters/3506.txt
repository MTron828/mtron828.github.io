Jun Wu Xie did not have an opinion on Flame Dragon’s decision as this was afterall the Beast Spirits’ affair, and hence, as a spirit outside of their race, she did not feel she should interfere with it too much.

Nalan Shan’s condition gradually became more stable but Brownie was still unwilling to take a single step away. Wu Jiu was still in a coma and Jun Wu Xie handed him right over to Flame Dragon for them to deal with him.

Jun Wu Xie could not be certain whether the human spirits would retaliate but she must at least be prepared. Qiao Chu and the others did not leave but decided to remain here in the Beast Spirits’ territory for the moment. They would go back and continue with their cultivation only after the Spirit Lord had passed his judgement.

The great battle had caused many among the Beast Spirits to be injured. Fortunately, their injuries were not that severe and they would all recover fully with just a little recuperation.

Brownie was worried sick. With everything that had happened that day, it was feeling highly guilt ridden. Back from that time outside the Spiritual Spirit Loft, not a single one among those five Beast Spirits that had saved him remained. The rhinoceros had died on the spot then and the cheetah and the others had sacrificed themselves in today’s battle. The enormous sense of guilt almost crushed the Spiritual Bear that had undergone so many setbacks, its massive body sitting quietly in a corner, staying beside Nalan Shan without a word.

Jun Wu Xie saw the miserable state Brownie was in and her heart could not help but feel pained.

With conflict came death, and that was disaster that could never be avoided.

Qiao Chu and the companions were not able to rest with their hearts at ease and as they still had a bit more energy, they busied themselves by taking care of the injured Beast Spirits. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They were afterall comrades who had battled beside each other and the Beast Spirits who were originally rather resistant towards those few human spirits now saw Qiao Chu and the companions as one of their own. The three Ring Spirits together with the Yin Yang Bear had similarly been injured and they had now obediently gone back into their respective contracted owners’ bodies to recuperate as well.

Early the next morning, Flame Dragon persuaded and reasoned with Brownie in every way it could to convince Brownie to go see the Spirit Lord together. Brownie looked on longingly, like it couldn’t bear to leave the still comatose Nalan Shan behind, as it trudged out with Flame Dragon to go see the Spirit Lord, lugging the unconscious Wu Jiu along with them.

To prevent themselves from being stopped by human spirits or Weapon Spirits midway, Flame Dragon just went ahead and put Brownie and Wu Jiu upon its back, as they flew threw through the sky, with some flying Beast Spirits accompanying them as escort.

“Wu Jiu is sure to be finished this time. Even if the Spirit Lord does not kill him, I do not think that he will be let off easily. I would like to see how he can still continue with his misdeeds from here on.” Having a night’s rest, Qiao Chu was feeling a whole lot better. He was smoothing out the Yin Yang Bear’s fur with a large comb and he prattled on as he combed.

“Wait till this matter comes to an end and we’ll then be able to continue our cultivation in peace. I really had not thought that we would encounter something like this here in the Spirit World.” Fei Yan was similarly smoothing out the Great Ape’s fur and he was of the same mind as Qiao Chu, waiting for Wu Jiu to be executed.

Hua Yao was applying medicine onto his Double Headed Bone Snake’s wounds at the side, Among their three Ring Spirits yesterday, the one that suffered the most serious injury was the most massive sized Double Headed Bone Snake. It had drawn the attention of the majority of the Weapon Spirits onto itself and its originally tough and resilient white bone body was now covered with injuries, with many of those bones cracked and broken. Hua Yao’s brows were furrowed up tightly together, looking highly pained as well.

The medicine that Hua Yao was using, was an unknown herbal medicine that the Beast Spirits here had brought. According to what those Beast Spirits had said, that medicine was very useful for wounds suffered by spirit bodies.

Jun Wu Xie had been very interested in looking into what the medicine of the Spirit World would really be like but as Nalan Shan was still recuperating and she had promised Brownie that she would take good care of Nalan Shan, she had to remain there to keep watch upon Nalan Shan, unable to free herself up enough to research into the medicine. She had to wait till the dust settled around this entire matter before she would be able to look into it properly.
