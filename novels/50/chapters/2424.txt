Chapter 2425: Overwhelming Force (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The changes on the battlefield left everyone stunned. Just a moment ago, it was impossible to see Luo Qingcheng, but now, she was like a pile of mud on the ground, continuously cursing Jun Wu Xie, as if that was the only thing that she could do.

“Is this... Little Xie’s real strength?” Qiao Chu rubbed his eyes in disbelief, everything before him seemed like a dream, totally unreal.

He thought that for Jun Wu Xie to condense a Spirit Ring within five years was already an incredulous feat, but to have condensed a second Spirit Ring as well. That was just inhumane!

“Double Spirit Rings... This is really...” Fan Zhuo finally found his voice as the initial fear for Jun Wu Xie disappeared at that moment.

Only a sigh.

Exactly what did she sacrifice to be able to achieve the strength she possessed today? The bystanders could only see how glamourous Jun Wu Xie was, but they did not know what kind of pain she has suffered.

If she was not forced into a desperate situation, how could she decide to fight to the death?

The hearts of Qiao Chu and company finally settled down, but Xie Changming and Wei Ya were still bathed in cold sweat. Seeing Jun Wu Xie had once again raised her hand, the two rushed to place themselves between Jun Wu Xie and Luo Qingcheng at almost the same instance.

Two bright auras flashed and the distance between Jun Wu Xie and Luo Qingcheng was extended.

Xie Changming lifted Luo Qingcheng from where she had collapsed on the ground at the first instant, as a paled-faced Wei Ya used his Spirit Ring to block Jun Wu Xie’s path. Although the two men then joined forces to attack, they were trembling with fear.

Facing Jun WU Xie who has double Spirit Rings, even if they joined forces, adding in Luo Qingcheng when she was at her peak, it would have been still difficult.

However....

They had to do this...

Luo Qingcheng was special, if Jun Wu Xie killed Luo Qingcheng in front of them, then even if they were to return to the Upper Realm, there would only be death awaiting them.

Afterall, the Lord only has Luo Qingcheng, this one disciple.

Having personally trained her for the last thousand years, no one could replace Luo Qingcheng’s importance in the Lord’s heart.

Jun Wu Xie looked on coldly as the two men suddenly attacked, her gaze hardly wavered.

Xie Changming and Wei Ya grew more fearful as they observed Jun Wu Xie’s calm and placid face. They were aware that if Jun Wu Xie were to retaliate, the three of them would surely lose their lives.

But, they had to take that gamble!

“Take Lady Qingcheng away!” Wei Ya’s body has been soaked in cold sweat, and bearing the spiritual pressure that emanated from Jun Wu Xie was making him expand a lot of energy. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xie Changming did not dare to delay for a moment longer, and immediately withdrew with Luo Qingcheng, while at the same time, he issued a command to the five hundred troops awaiting orders to attack.

“Jun Wu Xie, I admit, you are terribly strong. Perhaps we are not worthy adversaries, but don’t forget that this battle is not just the three of us. No matter how strong you are, you can’t possibly go against an army five hundred thousand strong!” Wei Ya tried to maintain a calm and stable facade towards Jun Wu Xie.

However, Wei Ya did not detect any sense of worry or panic on Jun Wu Xie’s face. In fact, she was so calm that not a single ripple of emotion could be seen within her eyes.

“Hmm? Five hundred thousand Gold Spirits right?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes turned up slightly. Suddenly fire flashed out of her hand and rose straight into the sky, and exploded in the air.

Soaring Cloud Signal!

When the Soaring Cloud Signal was activated, the Rui Lin Army appears!

It was just that the colour of the light was different from the real Soaring Cloud Signal’s colour. It was pure black.
