Chapter 3040 That Day 3

Rong Ruo hesitated before saying, “This mission has been personally organised by His Lord and starts in just a few days. We will know his true intentions soon enough. There simply isn’t enough time for Gu Ying to benefit from lying. From our past encounters with Gu Ying we know he’s no fool. So if he’s willing to say what he did, I’m quite sure it is true.”

“Don’t tell me those Gods really...existed?” Qiao Chu had doubt written all over his face. He always felt that belief in those things were used as a crutch by weak minded people.

“The Gods did exist, it is just not known if there were any here.” Jun Wu Yao said out of nowhere.

Qiao Chu and the rest looked at Jun Wu Yao in surprise, not knowing how he knew that.

But Jun Wu Yao himself was very clear.

How long ago was it that the Spirit Tree gave the two of them those dreams?

The Spirit Tree had said those strange images were real but they were not of this world. Jun Wu Xie herself had transmigrated here, and could naturally understand such matters.

If in a previous world, there were Gods, there might have once been Gods in this world too.

“Putting aside whether or not the Gods existed, His Lord’s objective is clear. I just can’t see why he wants to find the lost temples so urgently or what he hopes to find inside.” Jun Wu Xie said pensively. His Lord’s every move was related to the Blood Sacrifice Array of the Three Realms. However by mobilising three Knights of Destruction and Gu Ying, it seemed to be overkill.

If one were to say that the lost temples were not important to the Lord, Jun Wu Xie would never believe it even if she were beaten to death.

Nobody could answer Jun Wu Xie’s question as they all had the same question in the minds.

After thinking about it, Jun Wu Yao decided to set off on the mission with Jun Wu Xie disguised as her servant. As Qiao Chu and the rest had made good recoveries and their absorptions of the Spirit Rings had stabilized, Jun Wu Xie asked them to remain in the Holy City to take care of her parents.

His Lord had not involved Jun Gu in this mission and it made Jun Wu Xie uneasy, so she had to prepare for all eventualities. Jun Wu Yao had also sent a message to the Sea Spirit City to parepare some troops to storm the Sacred City when the opportunity presented itself.

After everything had been prepared, Jun Wu Xie inspected her companions’ injuries once more and was satisfied with their recoveries. She also left some medicine with Hua Yao and even left Little Lotus’ Spirit Rings with them as a last insurance policy.

In the following days, whether it was His Lord, Gu Ying or Chi Yan, all of them never sent for Jun Wu Xie. But after Nangong Lie got the news, he came a few times and was quite worried.

Also, by this time, a new batch of Top Ten Exponents had been minted. Jun Wu Yao had allowed Bai Mo to participate in the selection, but Bai Mo decided not to. During this time, he was either practicing or taking care of Fan Zhuo, but it put Fan Zhuo at a loss of what to do.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
