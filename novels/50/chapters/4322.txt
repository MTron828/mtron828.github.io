Chapter 2918: Recognizing ‘Father’ (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“How about you?” Jun Wu Yao looked at Bai Mo with undisguised bad intentions.

Bai Mo cried out loudly and that cry was terribly loud!

The cry shocked Qiao Chu and the others who were in the next room. A group of people walked into the room and saw Brother Wu Yao who represented a powerful and mysterious role in their hearts. They saw him bullying a little kid... Suddenly, their expressions turned somewhat strange.

Somehow... the scene in front of them was too strange ...

“Where did this child come from?” Fei Yan and the rest looked at Bai Mo who was a little dazed.

Qiao Chu said stiffly, “It is said to be the son of Brother Wu Yao and Little Xie.”

“...” Everyone’s jaws started to drop consecutively.

Damn...such speed ...

The eyes of several people immediately turned to look at Jun Wu Xie’s flat belly almost at the same time.

When was he ... born?

Jun Wu Xie was rendered speechless once again as her face reddened slightly: “His name is Bai Mo and he is from the Upper Realm.”

She didn’t have a son yet, at least for now ... no.

“Oh, ha ha.” Qiao Chu suddenly realized, “But Brother Wu Yao, the manner you are treating a child ...”

“He’s a Spirit Ring exponent.” Jun Wu Xie coldly threw out such a sentence.

“...” Qiao Chu sucked in a breath of cold air.

“He almost killed Nangong Lie just now.”

“...” Hua Yao and others’ eyes were instantly frozen.

What was wrong with this world?

A seven to eight year old child was actually a Spirit Ring exponent? One of the Top Ten experts who almost killed Nangong Lie?

The self-confidence of these people had been severely hit.

“He is older than your grandfathers.” said Jun Wu Xie.

“...”

Well, they recovered from their broken confidence.

Now, no one had any objection to Jun Wu Yao’s approach.

Bai Mo looked at Jun Wu Yao in despair, and said ruthlessly: “I am unlucky to fall into your hands. If you want to kill me, please go ahead.”

He confessed ...

Jun Wu Yao suddenly smiled, turning to look at Jun Wu Xie: “Little Xie.”

“Ok?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Are you interested in raising a child?”

“...”

“Just take it as practice in advance.”

“...”

Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao silently. The reason why he brought back Bai Mo was because he already had the thought of being a father?

The most bitter was Bai Mo, who came to find his own death. He was even more confused about the situation before him.

“Come, call Father.” Jun Wu Yao looked at Bai Mo with a smile.

Although Bai Mo’s actual age was not young, his appearance was quite exquisite and cute. As long as he put away his arrogance, he looked like a little lovable bun.

“...” Bai Mo stared, unable to believe what he had just heard.

However, before he had time to resist, a soreness ran up from the soles of his feet, and his whole body was as uncomfortable as being eaten by countless ants.

He stared at Jun Wu Yao’s smiley face, he gnashed his teeth with hatred but ...

“Father ...” The timid voice and soft voice came out of his mouth uncontrollably.

When they heard him call out “Father”, everyone in the room was shocked.

Only Jun Wu Yao’s face still had that bad smile on his face. He raised his hand and pointed at Jun Wu Xie, and continued: “Come, call Mother.”

Jun Wu Xie: “...”

Can she refuse?
