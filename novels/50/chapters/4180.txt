“Oh?” Bai Zhu raised an eyebrow slightly. His words made the other City Lords look at Zheng Ke strangely.

Zheng Ke was a cunning man and had his own plans. Otherwise he would not be willing to surrender to Bai Zhu, who was younger than him. Now that the Sea Spirit City was powerful, it was hard to guarantee that Zheng Ke would not change his mind.

“That Yan Hai is still young, I heard that he is about the same age as Miss Zheng, isn’t it ... Is Brother Zheng looking for a son-in-law?” Nangong Yan asked.

Zheng Ke’s face turned even more ugly.

He felt injustice. He wanted to make use of his daughters to win some City Lords’ support for himself . But his plan was not to include Sea Spirit City. He clearly understands Jun Wu Xie’s unscrupulous plan. Jun Wu Xie really liked Zheng Weilong. Zheng Ke was afraid that she would destroy his Discerning Moon City.

“Oh? There’s no such thing...I wouldn’t dare to have such a son-in-law.” Zheng Ke wiped the cold sweat on his forehead.

Bai Zhu saw Zheng Ke’s nervousness in his eyes and smiled softly: “Brother Zheng doesn’t need to be so nervous, I don’t think Brother Zheng will really make a pact with a tiger. But since Miss Zheng can win the favor of Yan Hai and she has been in Sea Spirit City, it may be good news for us. ”

“Oh?” Nangong Yan raised an eyebrow at Bai Zhu.

“Even heroes fall for beauties. Since Miss Zheng is in Sea Spirit City and is so close to Yan Hai, say, if she wants to set her mind on it, it will be easier than us. Brother Zheng, do you agree?” The reference was to Zheng Ke.

Zheng Ke immediately understood what he meant.

“That being said, the little girl hasn’t been close to me since she was a child. Now that Sea Spirit City is powerful, I’m afraid she’s ...”

“When both Sea Spirit City and White Night City are surrounded by 72 cities, which one do you think is more tempting?” Bai Zhu suddenly said.

Zheng Ke froze completely, he looked at Bai Zhu incredulously.

Bai Zhu laughed: “Ever since I took over the White Night City, I have been very busy. There is always a lack of virtuous help in the house. I have heard that the eldest daughter of Brother Zheng is not smart, but she is a very intelligent woman.If I can marry such a woman, it is definitely a blessing for me. ”

Bai Zhu had already spoken about this. Everyone knew that he intended to lure Zheng Weilong and marry her as a wife of the White Night City!

Nangong Yan looked at Bai Zhu with a smile on his face, and sighed. No wonder Bai Zhu was still able to sit firmly as a City Lord of White Night City. This courage was quite comparable to his mind.

“I understand what Lord Bai meant. Let me send someone to pass the message to my daughter.” Zheng Ke said quickly.

“That would be great. If Miss Zheng is willing, with her repercussions, no matter how strong Yan Hai is, I’m afraid he won’t survive this time. I would also like to ask everyone to let go of each other’s prejudices and combine all our armies and power together. When everyone has returned to your cities, send your troops immediately to attack Sea Spirit City. Let’s give them a big surprise.” Bai Zhu said with a cold smile.

Being the Lord of the 72 cities was never easy.

If Jun Wu Xie wanted to take this position, she had to go through their approval.

With the arrangement of Bai Zhu, the 72 cities took action immediately. Except for Yu Yuanshan who was delayed by Dongfang Ku Bi, all the other cities had joined this battle. The lands of the 72 cities would soon be ignited in flames...
