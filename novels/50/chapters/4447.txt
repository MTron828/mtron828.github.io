Chapter 3043 The Lost Temples 3

After a moment’s silence, Chi Yan said to Qin Qi, “Continue checking, best if you can find the recipe or what happened to Yan Hai in the Sea of Death. You must get to the bottom of both these things. I will not allow anyone with ulterior motives to be by the Lord’s side.”

“Yes!”

Chi Yan nodded slightly and after looking at the weather, announced to everyone, “Since we are all here, let’s set off now.”

After speaking, Chi Yan started walking towards his carriage without giving any further instruction or explanation. Just as he was about to enter, Gu Ying cried out, “Lord Chi Yan, you still have not told us where we are going.”

Chi Yan stopped and turned to look at Gu Ying. He then proceeded to speak in a tone so cold it would have frozen lava. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Highness Ying, His Lord’s orders are for me to lead the mission, so all of you just need to follow my lead. When we get there, I will tell you what needs to be done next.”

Chi Yan’s tone was not courteous and could be considered rude, even. What was more, Chi Yan did not care at all and this did not go unnoticed by Gu Ying.

Gu Ying replied with a slight smile, “So Lord Chi Yan is not going to give us some time to prepare?”

Chi Yan replied, “There is no need for that.” With that he got into his carriage, not giving Gu Ying any time to reply.

Su Ruiying looked at Jun Wu Xie and Gu Ying before getting into her carriage. She had been particularly quiet.

Only Jun Wu Xie, Gu Ying and their companions were left outside the city walls.

Gu Ying shrugged his shoulders and looked at Jun Wu Xie haplessly, “It seems that the two of us are not welcomed.”

Jun Wu Xie looked at him blankly and got into the carriage. After boarding the carriage, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yie sat opposite each other. After a while, the carriage started to move and they officially embarked on the journey.

However, nobody knew what was going to be the mission’s outcome.

In the carriage, Jun Wu Xie was looking at the scenery along the road outside the window. The carriage was specially arranged by Chi Yan. The horses pulling the carriage were extremely fast, and the scenery on both sides of the road became a blur.

“Gu Ying’s situation is almost what we expected.” Jun Wu Yao said.

Jun Wu Xie nodded, “I see it too, Chi Yan and the rest don’t seem to have much respect for Gu Ying. Also I’ve always found it strange that Gu Ying returned to His Lord. In a place like the Three Realms there seems to be no place for a love between father and son. How can a person thinking of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, think of finding his son at this time? ”

Jun Wu Xie pondered it. Gu Ying had been in the Blood Fiend Palace for quite a while and she had heard a lot about the abuse Gu Ying suffered at the hands of his adoptive father.

It could be said that Gu Ying was living a fate worse than death but His Lord did not take him back earlier.

If he really cared for his son, why would His Lord let Gu Ying suffer so much in the Blood Fiend Palace?

But if he did not care, why would he get Gu Ying back and announce to the world that he was his son?

The intentions of His Lord were hard to grasp, but Jun Wu Xie felt that Gu Ying’s return must be related to the Lord’s plan for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms.
