After that banquet that had left almost everyone speechless, Duan Qi and Elder Yun had also calmed down a lot. They finally realized that by extending the invitation to Han Zi Fei for the banquet was arguably their worst decision ever made. And this decision had led them to be afraid of letting Jun Wu Xie choose a woman from the Sacred Maiden Tribe. They feared that Jun Wu Xie would choose Han Zi Fei, that would really make them shed tears of sorrow. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Because of this reason, Jun Wu Xie was left to her own devices these days in the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

The rumours about the Sacred Maiden Tribe were true. Jun Wu Xie had yet to venture to the sacred place of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, and even just at her residence, she felt that her psychic force was more refreshed than before. The past instructions which Han Zi Fei had given to Jun Wu Xie echoed in her ears, and thus she simply used these few days to exercise her psychic force under the supervision of Jun Wu Yao.

Han Shu tried to approach Jun Wu Xie several times, but was stopped by Duan Qi. Although in Duan Qi’s heart, Han Shu was the most suitable candidate, any fool could see the coldness with which Jun Wu Xie had treated Han Shu with.

Before Han Zi Fei married Jun Gu, Duan Qi did not plan to let anyone approach Jun Wu Xie to fawn at her. If there were bad results, no one would be able to bear the consequences.

The last few days were spent very peacefully. Jun Wu Xie even released Little Lotus several times during that period. Little Lotus liked the Sacred Maiden Tribe area very much, because perhaps this was the best place to bring up the Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus.

Time passed quickly, on the Holy Mountain, another group of distinguished guests were ushered in.

A group of men and women slowly walked into the Holy Mountain. The man who led the group was handsome and elegant, his tall and straight posture made Yan Xi, who was walking behind him, felt that the image was perfect.

“This is the Holy Mountain?” Jun Gu’s footsteps paused, and he looked up at the nearby mountain peak. Under the clouds, the snow-capped mountain peak seemed to be a little piece of purity in this world. It made people feel carefree and relaxed.

“Yes.” Yan Xi nodded obediently, although her face was calm,there was a strange look in her eyes. She was silent for a moment, but she raised her head slightly, and looked at Jun Gu’s beautiful profile and asked, “My Lord, do you like it here?”

“I can’t say I like or dislike it. The scenery is very unique.” Jun Gu smiled.

Yan Xi was silent.

“You are a part of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Your return this time, it’s like a homecoming. Are you happy?” Jun Gu asked.

Yan Xi forced a smile and said, “It’s alright.”

There was a wry smile on the corner of her mouth, but there was a strong resistance in her eyes.

It didn’t take long to reach the top of the Holy Mountain.

The Sacred Maiden Tribe has already received the news, and tribe elders such as Duan Qi and Elder Yun have already prepared in advance.

Jun Gu’s status was noble, even their Sacred Maiden Tribe must entertain them carefully. Naturally, everything was properly prepared, not to mention ...

Duan Qi and the rest of the elders were anticipating the arrival of Jun Gu day and night for the past few days. They wanted to marry Han Zi Fei off earlier so that they could handle the matter of Jun Wu Xie. Thankfully, these past days, Jun Wu Xie did not have much contact with Han Zi Fei. This allowed Duan Qi, who had been living in fear and worry, felt a bit of relief.

The Sacred Maiden Tribe was preparing to welcome these distinguished guests.

Of course ...

Han Shu was observing the preparation in one corner, the jealousy in her eyes was almost dripping out.

She turned abruptly and walked towards Jun Wu Xie’s residence.
