Ye Jie served Jun Wu Xie on changing her clothes. The sequelae brought by the pain during the relapse had slowly subsided. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was already late morning, Jun Wu Xie had been staying in the room for quite a while but there was no sign of Jun Wu Yao coming back, causing her to be a little curious. After asking Ye Jie, Ye Jie too, didn’t know where did Jun Wu Yao go while the black cat aside looked slightly worried.

“Little Black.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly spoke.

“Meow?” The black cat seemed to be thinking of something, causing it to be in a trance after Jun Wu Xie called its name.

“Was Wu Yao the one who saved me just now?” Looking at the black cat, it seemed like Jun Wu Xie was asking a question but she had actually gotten the answer in her mind.

Qin Song and Long Jiu had returned to the Soul World, thus no any other person was able to manage her chaotic energy except if they went to the Spirit World and seeked help from the Spirit Lord. However, the entrance of the Spirit World was a few days journey away from their place plus the Spirit Lord couldn’t leave the Spirit World since he needed to sustain the Spirit World. There was no way he would be here.

Therefore, the person who was able to suppress the chaotic energy inside her could only be Jun Wu Yao and no one else.

“Err... I don’t know...” The eyes of the black cat seemed to be looking away from Jun Wu Xie. It wasn’t sure how should it explain everything it saw to Jun Wu Xie.

Should it tell Jun Wu Xie that Jun Wu Yao could simply turn his body into a soul?

Even it itself felt that this was such a crazy and unimaginable thing, let alone Jun Wu Xie.

“What’s going on?” asked Jun Wu Xie with her brows slightly frowned.

Without having any other choices, the black cat could only tell Jun Wu Xie about all the things it witnessed just now.

The fact that Jun Wu Yao was able to turn himself into a soul according to his will and could even choose to transform only his arm had truly surprised Jun Wu Xie.

But before Jun Wu Xie could even think about the issue in detail, Ye Jie who was standing aside was startled and the teacup which she held in her hand clashed onto the ground.

Jun Wu Xie turned her head and looked at Ye Jie in confusion. Ye Jie’s face took on a ghastly expression with her eyes widening in horror.

“What’s wrong?” Looking at Ye Jie’s colourless face, Jun Wu Xie asked.

Ye Jie suddenly realized that the way she reacted was a bit inappropriate. She hurriedly crouched down and picked up the broken cup on the floor piece by piece with her head down, not daring to look into Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. With a small voice, she said. “N-... Nothing...”

Jun Wu Xie stood up all of a sudden and walked to the front of Ye Jie.

Not having the courage to simply move, Ye Jie could only remain her pose of crouching down, pretending to pick up the fragments of the teacup, but after she had finished picking up those fragments, there was no sign of her trying to get up.

Both of them remained locked in stalemate in the room.

“Ye Jie.” The voice of Jun Wu Xie came from the top of Ye Jie’s head.

The whole body of Ye Jie shuddered.

“Lift your head up.”

Ye Jie immediately stiffened, not having the guts to move even a bit.

“Lift your head up,” ordered Jun Wu Xie again.

After hesitating for a long time, only then Ye Jie raised her head up slowly with her pair of big muddled eyes filling with tears.

“Young... Young Miss...”

“You know something, don’t you?” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. Although Ye Jie was clumsy, she wasn’t as fragile as the normal teen girls. There was definitely something wrong with her not being able to control her emotions.

“No... I... I know nothing...” Ye Jie began to panic. When Ye Sha asked her to come over, she had totally no idea of what was going on, but the black cat’s words had made her come into a realization of the things that might have been happening.

Lord Jue clearly had used his soul power to save Young Miss!

But...

He shouldn’t be using it!

“Is it related to Wu Yao?” With her eyes narrowing, Jun Wu Xie didn’t miss any tiny changes in Ye Jie’s expression.

Ye Jie opened her mouth. It seemed like her voice was being stuck in her throat, not letting her to speak even a word.
