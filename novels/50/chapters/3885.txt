Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

He hasn’t even managed to spend some time with his own granddaughter when Jun Xian had already received news that Jun Wu Xie would be heading to the Upper Realm in half a month’s time. He was at once shocked.

The main reason Jun Wu Xie wanted to go the Soul World in the Upper Realm is not only due to her condition, but also to find Jun Gu’s soul. She must make this trip and bring Jun Gu’s soul back. Jun Xian was hapless as he could not stop Jun Wu Xie from doing so.

Qiao Chu and the others also received the news. The first thing they did was to find Jun Wu Xie and one by one and said they also wanted to go along.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t reject their request, Qiao Chu and the others have improved greatly these past years. So even if they went to the Upper Realm, they all possessed the ability to protect themselves.

Apart from Qiao Chu and the rest, Jun Wu Xie did not intend to bring anyone else from the Lower Realm.

Although the powers and capabilities of the Lower Realm folks have increased by leaps and bounds, when faced with opponents from the Upper Realm, they would still expend certain effort. This time, they were giving up the beneficial environment of the Lower Realm as they enter the Upper Realm, where they will be surrounded by dangers from every angle. Jun Wu Yao suggested that Night Regime and Ghost Army come along, afterall, these two troops’ powers are more than sufficient for a tussle with the Upper Realm.

During that half month of preparation time, Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie managed to spend some happy married times together. As for the incident which happened on the second day of their marriage, there was a silent agreement between the both of them to not discuss it. Within that half a month, Jun Wu Xie was either busy preparing more pills and elixirs, or she was busy help Jun Wu Yao prepare for the long journey. There weren’t many intimate moments for them but it developed into some sort of tacit understanding. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

As long as they were together, there was no need for more sweet nothings.

Only.....

Their night ‘life’ had become more ‘rich’, Jun Wu Xie woke up every morning with aches and pains because Jun Wu Yao would wake up every morning and massage his little fellow attentively, that was a good term ‘massage’, but in actual fact, he was taking advantage of Jun Wu Xie.

The day before they embarked on their journey, Jun Wu Xie once again visited the prison.

In a dozen days, the soreness and itchiness of Luo’s body had not stopped. At this time, she has grown so thin that if it was not for the rise and fall of her chest, she was almost no different from the dead.

Bai Yunxian still stood by the side of Jun Wu Xie. In those days, she gave the medicine to Luo Qingcheng every day according to the instructions of Jun Wu Xie, and as she watched Luo Qingcheng descend into further insanity, there was a lingering fear in her heart.

When Jun Wu Xie once again appeared in front of Luo Qingcheng, Luo Qingcheng was already so close to a complete breakdown, and even her line of sight had become blurred. The continuous torment on her body lasted day through night. In this completely silent dungeon, she could not see, could not hear and the last trace of persistence had collapsed under tremendous torture.

“What exactly is the Life and Death Worm?” Jun Wu Xie had someone pour cold water onto Luo Qingcheng’s body, as she asked once again.

This time, Luo Qingcheng had completely no strength to curse at Jun Wu Xie, she has been tortured to the point of dehumanisation. The only thought in her mind is to get released from the torture of soreness and itchiness.

When the torment momentarily receded, she wept uncontrollably with relief.

“This is your last chance. If you don’t answer me, then you will forever live in this sort of torment.” Jun Wu Xie’s volume was not raised, her voice was as cold as the winter storm in February.

“....Sou....Soul.... Worm...” Luo Qingcheng could not take the pain anymore and finally revealed the answer.

“Soul Worm?” Jun Wu Xie frowned slightly.

“I don’t know any more than this. My teacher is the one who created it.... I just know this particular poison affects the soul, as long as you use the Soul power, the poison will activate..... I really don’t know more.....” Luo Qingcheng cried.
