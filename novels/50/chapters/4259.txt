“What are you looking at?” Han Zi Fei said.

Jun Gu was stunned for a moment. When he regained his senses, the sharpness in his eyes disappeared. He was embarrassed when he looked at Han Zi Fei.

“Nothing.”

“Take this medicine.” Han Zi Fei took the elixir in her hand and handed it to Jun Gu.

Jun Gu stared at the elixir of unknown origin. He looked at Han Zi Fei. For some reason, he was full of unconditional trust in her. Even if the world would harm him, it would definitely not be Han Zi Fei.

With no hesitation, Jun Gu took the elixir and placed it directly into his mouth. The whole process made Jun Wu Xie feel very surprised.

She really didn’t know if she should be happy about it or for her father’s unsuspecting silence.

After taking the elixir, Jun Gu only felt that a heat flow was flowing in his body. As if a hot spring was gradually spreading from his stomach to his limbs. The warm touch made him feel unusually comfortable andhe felt as if his consciousness had been pulled away from his body at this moment.

Jun Wu Xie and Han Zi Fei obrserved Jun Gu’s reaction closely. At this moment, they felt as if their their hearts were stuck in their throats.

Jun Gu’s eyes narrowed slightly. The gentle softness appeared on his face, his vision was a little blurred. The figure in front of him became a little unclear and his eyes seemed to be covered with a mist of water. There was a touch of comfort like his body was soaked in the hot spring.

As time passed by minute by minute, Jun Wu Xie almost held her breath and watched every move of Jun Gu.

Jun Gu suddenly regained his senses and looked at everything in front of him. From obscurity to clarity, his eyes became clear. When he saw the person standing in front of himself, he was stunned. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The shadow that had been wandering around in his memory for a long time, would actually appear in front of him today. Jun Gu couldn’t believe his eyes. He opened his mouth and looked at Han Zi Fei ... After hesitating for a long time, he slowly said: “Zi Fei? Really ... is it really you?”

The slightly trembling voice expressed the shock in Jun Gu’s heart.

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Gu and smiled.

Jun Gu’s heart trembled. Suddenly, he stepped forward to embrace Han Zi Fei in his arms with all his strength. He hugged her tightly in his arms. He was afraid that she would disappear from his vision the next moment.

“I thought ... I thought ...” Jun Gu muttered as he held Han Zi Fei, and the trembling voice made the smile on Han Zi Fei’s face could no longer be maintained as her expression crumbled and her eyes became wet.

“What do you think? You fool ...”

“I ... nothing, nothing at all.” Jun Gu took a deep breath and he couldn’t believe that he could ever hold her in his arms again.

“Zi Fei, this is great, we are together again.”

Han Zi Fei just squinted her eyes and smiled. She hugged him without saying a word.

Jun Gu suddenly thought of something. He slightly shuffled back and with undisguised excitement, he said with pride as his eyes sparkled as he said: “Zi Fei, do you know? I saw our child, our Little Xie. She has grown up ... she has grown into a very good woman, and if you ever see her, you will be proud of her.”
