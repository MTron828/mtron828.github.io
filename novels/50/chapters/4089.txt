Chapter 2685: To counter soldiers with arms（1）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

It was peaceful in Sea Spirit City.

Jun Wu Xie walked out of the medicine room and she was covered with the scent of herbs. She just walked into the courtyard, but realized that Qiao Chu and others had been waiting in the courtyard for a long time, but no one dared to disturb her. Hence, they could only wait there and asked Jun Wu Yao some interesting facts about the Upper Realm.

In fact, Jun Wu Yao was not interested in any interesting facts of the Upper Realm at all ...

“Little Xie.” Jun Wu Yao saw Jun Wu Xie and immediately stood up and both arms spread open naturally, ready to give his wife a warm hug.

But Jun Wu Xie stepped back subconsciously, avoiding Jun Wu Yao’s hug.

Jun Wu Yao looked at her with a sorrowful expression and the smile on his face had turned bitter.

“I have poison on my body.” Jun Wu Xie saw the grievance on Jun Wu Yao’s face and immediately raised both her hands to reveal her fair hands that had some white powder on them. If one looked carefully, it could be seen that not only her hands, even the clothes on her body had quite a lot of white powder scattered all over but just because of the colour of her off white robes, one wouldn’t be able to see it at a glance.

“What am I afraid of?” Jun Wu Yao chuckled as his lips curled up as he brought Jun Wu Xie into his arms, without taking heed of the poison on her hand, and even pulled her little hand to drop a kiss on the back of her hand.

“...” Qiao Chu and others who were watching from the side were already dumbfounded.

The poisons that Jun Wu Xie concocted were extremely toxic!

Let’s not say it was taken by others, even if it’s just a little bit had been in contact with one’s skin, one could report to Hades immediately even though its appearance looked as harmless as flour.

Sure enough, this couple was really heaven defying.

Jun Wu Xie had also subconsciously dodged just now although she already knew that Jun Wu Yao was immune to poison. Hence, she no longer prevented his intimate actions and let him be as her gaze fell to Qiao Chu. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Why are all of you here?”

Hua Yao, Fan Zhuo, Rong Ruo, Fei Yan, Qiao Chu and even the three of them from the Night Regime had came over.

“The members of the Night Regime who are ten miles away have just conveyed news that they’ve discovered people from Long Xuan City.” Ye Mei reported.

“Oh?” Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow slightly, they finally came.

“It’s two days earlier than I thought.”

“Little devil, big brother Ye Mei said that Long Xuan City brought many people along this time. Do they intend to snatch by force?” Qiao Chu looked at Jun Wu Xie excitedly with sparkling eyes, looking forward to a fight.

“Let’s quickly beat them up, I have long been displeased at the sight of those people from Long Xuan City!” Fei Yan who was responsible for contacting Xu Zu and the others had long been disgusted by them. His hands were itching to beat them up.

Jun Wu Xie looked calmly at her companions who were all riled up as she took a seat slowly on the stone bench in the pavilion and said indifferently, “Now’s not the time to fight yet.”

“Huh?” Qiao Chu froze for a moment.

Rong Ruo sighed and said, “Hasn’t Little Xie said it before, that the people of Long Xuan City would be using diplomacy before violence?”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Chu was even more confused.

“Although he brought people with him, there might not be a fight.” Hua Yao broke it down in a concise and clear manner.

Qiao Chu was a little stunned.

“Let the people of the Night Regime prepare.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Ye Sha and Ye Mei.

“Yes.” Ye Sha and Ye Mei immediately retreated after they heard her orders.
