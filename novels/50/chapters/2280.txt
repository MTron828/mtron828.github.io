“I don’t know why but I’ve always felt that the exposure of the Night Regime’s route doesn’t seem quite right.” Fan Zhuo narrowed his eyes as he said in contemplation. He had always been one with an acute mind and after hearing the news of the raid this time round, he had always felt that the negligence of the Night Regime seems to be somewhat abnormal.

He did not believe that with their strength that could easily kill a Gold Spirit in seconds would ‘accidentally’ let one go. Moreover, to actually expose their next target so ‘inevitably’ to the opponent.

All these...

Seemed too much to be a coincidence. He always thought that this time round, it was as if someone had once used this method to deal with an opponent.

The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. 1

This style looked too similar to that person’s! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You mean that... The Night Regime had deliberately...?” Hua Yao raised his eyebrows slightly, although his eyes did not reveal a trace of surprise, it was as if Fan Zhuo’s words were what he had thought.

“Do you feel the same?” Fan Zhuo immediately realised that Hua Yao’s thought was probably the same as his.

Hua Yao nodded his head slightly.

“This is really her style, isn’t it? Deliberately revealing flaws to let the opponent think that they can succeed. Everything thrown out front is just a bait. She then just tramples them ruthlessly from behind.” Hua Yao’s gaze became incredibly gentle, seemingly lost in the memories of the past.

After Rong Ruo, Fei Yan and Qiao Chu heard the words exchanged between Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo, they immediately looked at each other. They saw a thread of hope and joy in each other’s eyes.

The style of doing things was too similar to that person’s and they had seen their opponents planted in these traps countless times.

For them who had been deeply involved and had personally participated in such schemes, they only felt nostalgia.

It had been five years... Would they really meet again?

“Somehow, I’m already filled with expectations and can’t wait for the Night Regime to arrive. Qiao Chu’s face lit up with a smile, a smile which was sincere and his heart was beating furiously. Hope and anticipation had already filled the hearts of the five of them.

What they had been waiting for and looking forward to... today they would be finally able to fulfill it!

Long Qi looked at the subtle changes in the expressions of Qiao Chu and the others. He could no longer remember how long the five of them had shown such a carefree smile. Looking at their smiles, it seemed as if it had stirred up something from within him as well as his eyes looked gently upon the lands not far from them. Suddenly, he saw a group of men, cloaked in black, riding on black horses and entering the city!

There were not many people in that group, only a few dozens and this was the same number of people which the Night Regime had for each raid!

“They are here!” Long Qi suppressed the excitement in his heart as he said to them.

Qiao Chu and the rest immediately snapped back to reality and immediately turned to look at the team of men on horseback who were gradually entering the city.

Fire ignited in the eyes of the five of them!

Rong Ruo raised his hand and said, “Everyone, get ready!”

Behind them, there were tens of thousands of soldiers donned in light armour. All of them were soldiers from the Rui Lin Army and had came from the Lower Realm. This time, they had came together with Long Qi, Qiao Chu and the others and their goal was to welcome their Young Miss home!

A gust of wind whizzed past and everybody’s eyes were focused on the men on horseback that had just entered the city. Each step those horses made felt like they were trampling on their hearts.

Clop clop clop...
