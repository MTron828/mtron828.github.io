No wonder Jun Wu Xie would speak such arrogant words to Xu Zu them, she was setting up for the future ascend of the Sea Spirit City!

With the personality which everyone in the Upper Realm had, one would never share the methods of getting stronger with the others if one had mastered them.

“Gosh! You’re going to do something big with this!” Qiao Chu gave a slap on his forehead. Jun Wu Xie was obviously going to fight face to face against the seventy-two cities in the Upper Realm.

Jun Wu Xie slightly lowered her eyes. She had been thinking of this solution for the whole night, and for the current Sea Spirit City, this was the safest way to deal with the problem. The people in the Upper Realm would no longer suspect that the Sea Spirit City had been taken over by someone since no one would really believe the fact that all the people in the city had actually been replaced by other people.

Furthermore...

“I want to find my father,” said Jun Wu Xie in a low voice. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

With a slight astonishment, Hua Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie.

“I don’t know which part of the Upper Realm he’s at. The only thing I know is that he has a rather high position in the Upper Realm. If I want to find him, all I can do is just to climb higher.” A sense of coldness flared across the bottom of Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. In the Upper Realm, she would only have the chance to find Jun Gu if she got to a higher place. The strength of Jun Gu had already surpassed the Top Ten Experts, and he was definitely not a person who a City Lord could simply have the chance to meet, but... what if she annihilated all the cities and wiped off the title of the seventy-two cities...

Then she would surely catch the attention of that person in the Upper Realm, as the higher she went, only then she would have the chance to save Jun Gu.

Jun Wu Xie had no any other choice except for driving herself into the desperation, forcing herself to fight for her life.

No matter if it was the Blood Sacrifice of the Upper Realm, Jun Gu being controlled by the enemy or the life and death worm inside Jun Wu Yao’s body, they were all pushing her, making her in having no choice but to take the risks and dangers.

She couldn’t step back.

Once she stepped back, there would be no home, no family and no love left for her anymore. Everything that she valued and treasured so much would vanish at the instant.

Jun Wu Xie’s words had caused Qiao Chu and the others to sink into silence. It was at the moment that they realized that the extremity and the risks that Jun Wu Xie did were all because there was already no way back for her. Take a step backward and it would be the endless deep abyss; a careless mistake was made and her body would then be crushed into pieces.

The things that she were bearing on her shoulders weren’t as simple as the things dealt by a person, a family, or a country.

“Don’t worry, you’ll definitely find your father.” When Fan Zhuo came back after sending Xu Zu and the people from the Long Xuan City out, he heard all the words Jun Wu Xie said. While smiling, he walked towards Jun Wu Xie and encouragingly patted on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder.

“That’s right! We’ll help you to find him. Since you’ve met Uncle Jun, there will be hope for everything. Isn’t it just fighting against the seventy-two cities? Why would we be afraid of them! We’ll kill them all no matter there are how many of them! It can also be considered of taking revenge for the Lower Realm and the Middle Realm.” Hitting on his chest, Qiao Chu let out his heroic sayings.

“Since we’re going to make the Upper Realm think into the direction which you’re talking about, then I’ll go and make some arrangements. I’ll let the Night Regime spread some stories,” said Hua Yao calmly. They would still need some instigation and “rumors” if they wanted to substantiate the matter.

“Yeah, we should make use of it when Xu Ze them are still here,” agreed Rong Ruo.

As the supporting words of her comrades echoed beside her ears, Jun Wu Xie raised her head and looked at her fellow friends who had gone through thick and thin together with her for years. With a touch of warmth flowing across her heart, the corner of her lips slowly hooked up and curved into a smile.

Was there anything for her to be afraid of when there was such a group of people who were willing to live and die with her, staying beside her?

“I’ll go and ask Senior Zi Fei about the details now so that the Night Regime can be more precise when they spread the news,” said Hua Yao immediately.
