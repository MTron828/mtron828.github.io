Chapter 2356: The Upper Realm (6)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Luo Qingcheng looked at the perfect and exquisite woman in the mirror. She took a deep breath and slightly raised her chin. It just felt like the imperious Luo Qingcheng in the previous time was back again.

“Guard! Get ready, I’m going to the Dragon Trapped Abyss!”

Just as the name had implied, the Dragon Trapped Abyss was a place used to lock up the powerful people, even the tremendous dragon weren’t be able to escape from this place.

This was the most dangerous place in the Upper Realm. It was also a place that people seldom had the guts to step foot on.

With a cold face, Luo Qingcheng walked into the Dragon Trapped Abyss. While walking in the thin fog, she arrived at the entrance of a cave.

Outside the cave, there were more than ten guards standing at two sides of the entrance. After seeing that it was Luo Qingcheng who had come to visit, they immediately opened the big door of the cave. Luo Qingcheng then stepped out her foot and moved forward.

Inside the dark cave, the dim firelight was the only thing that was used to lighten up a few inches of its surrounding. The whole cave was pervaded with a strong pressure. For all the experts there, it felt like one was carrying tonnes of force on one’s back. Even for someone like Luo Qingcheng too, couldn’t help but slowed down her pace after entering the cave.

This cave had the strongest and highest pressing force among all the cages in the Dragon Trapped Abyss. Not only spirit energies of thousands highly skilled masters were used in making the cage, it was also personally built by Luo Qingcheng’s Master. Definitely not a single person was able to escape from the cave.

At the deepest side of the cave, there was a figure in the dark quietly sitting cross-legged on the cold ground. Hundreds of specially made Soul Binding Chains were crisscrossing and interlacing with each other in a complicated method, tying up the person firmly in the dark and silent cave.

A handsome face came into Luo Qingcheng’s sight, illuminated by the light of the flame, causing her to space out for a little. It was a charming face that no any other one was able to compare with it. But in a very short time, she returned to normal by breathing in secretly, making herself to seem cool and arrogant.

“I came here today because I’ve got two news for you.” Luo Qingcheng stared at the person and suddenly said.

However, it seemed like the person was in a deep sleep since his eyes were closed tightly. No response was given.

His act of silence was earlier expected by Luo Qingcheng. During the five years of him being locked up in here, he never spoke to her, not a sentence, not a word. Not even an eye contact, was he willing to give her.

Luo Qingcheng forced back her discontent of being ignored and said in a cold voice. “I don’t care whether if you respond to me. I’m just here to tell you something, both good news and bad news.”

“The good news is that the little bitch you have always been protecting is still alive. And the bad news... Is that after two months, I’ll be torturing her to death with my own hands in front of you!” said Luo Qingcheng in a gloomy and cold tone, with vehement hatred in it.

Though, it was still a complete silence inside the cave. The person trapped in it didn’t open his mouth. His closing eyes too, never once opened.

At last, Luo Qingcheng took a glance at the person, knowing that the person had been paying no attention to her from the very beginning and she will never receive any response towards her words. She turned her head angrily, more hatred gathered in her eyes.

It was when Luo Qingcheng left the cave, the person who was caught suddenly opened his eyes in the dark. It was a pair of violet eyes. A wild and evil smile bloomed on the handsome, but at the same time beautiful face, with the corner of the lips curving a little up with intrigue. The purple eyes were full of evil charm. Not a bit of grimness or depression was seen in his eyes, like he had never been trapped inside the cave.

“It was really... some good news,” chuckled Jun Wu Yao.

It had been five years, he wondered whether his Little Xie had grown up into a lady or not.

Just wait for a while, just wait...
