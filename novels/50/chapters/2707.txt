Qiao Chu and others had a good fight and they left the Ghost Army to deal with the remnants of the battlefield, while Jun Wu Xie returned directly to the city. It seemed that they did not intend to continue the pursuit.

After the battlefield was completely cleaned, Zheng Weilong and Ah Da walked out from their hiding place in the forest.

The loess in front of the gate of the Sea Spirit City had been stained dark red with blood. Even though the corpses were gone, the breath of death still lingered on the soil along with the nauseating scent of blood. It was as if telling everyone not to forget what had happened here.

“The power of Sea Spirit City ... is stronger than I expected.” Zheng Weilong raised her eyes, and today’s battled had completely overturned her perception of Sea Spirit City.

Although she had vaguely guessed that Jun Wu Xie hid some cards, she only guessed that the battle Sea Spirit City and Long Xuan City would be a tie at most. However, after the real battle began, Long Xuan City turned out to be so passive and was beaten into submission in front of Sea Spirit City.

Even Ruan Zhongshan had died in the hands of Jun Wu Xie. Such terrible powers should not belong to the Sea Spirit City at all.

“It seems that the elixir prescription that Sea Spirit City possesses is really powerful, however ... the Sea Spirit City Lord is still too young. Just now in battle, they could have killed all the soldiers of Long Xuan City, but they were not being meticulous, allowing some soldiers to flee the battlefield. It won’t be long before the news of Sea Spirit City’s possession of the prescription spread through the Upper Realm.” Ah Da frowned slightly. He recognized their strength, but also found many shortcomings.

It was true that Sea Spirit City had won this time, but their finishing move was not perfect as the Long Xuan City soldiers who fled would definitely spread the news of this battle. When the time came, even if Sea Spirit City wanted to hide, they would not be able to.

“This kind of abominable elixir will definitely cause a scramble by many parties. Although Sea Spirit City is rising rapidly in strength now, their foundation is lacking. This time they faced Long Xuan City, so they can be rather unaffected. But once the prescription attracts the attention from the other cities, I am afraid they would be facing more difficult opponents.” Ah Da sighed. If only Jun Wu Xie had killed everyone from Long Xuan City, then they won’t not suffer in the near future.

But Zheng Weilong didn’t agree with Ah Da’s words. She frowned slightly as she glanced across blood stained earth, and her bright eyes seemed to be thinking about something.

“Ah Da, you are wrong.” Zheng Weilong suddenly spoke after a long time.

“I am wrong? What does Miss mean?” Ah Da didn’t understand.

Zheng Weilong looked up slightly and looked at Sea Spirit City, and slowly said: “Do you really think that those deserters in Long Xuan City escaped by themselves?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Isn’t it?” Ah Da frowned slightly, as a bystander, he saw the whole battle clearly. Most of the soldiers who could escape were in the outer area. This was only because the people in Sea Spirit City did not start killing in the outer area. And that was their chance to escape.

However...

Zheng Weilong obviously didn’t think so.

Zheng Weilong took a deep breath and said in a low voice: “If it is the Sea Spirit City in the past, it may be as you said, but now it is different. Those from Long Xuan City were intentionally let go by Sea Spirit City!”
