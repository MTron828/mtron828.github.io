Chapter 3004 All“s fair in war 1

The girl spoke in bits and pieces, she did not give any new information from what Rong Ruo had already said, and in some areas knew even less.

After her soul had been liberated from its prison, the girl was immensely grateful to Jun Wu Xie but was unsure about her future. It was only after Jun Wu Xie asked her about how Su Ruiying used the puppets to listen in on people that she remembered.

After she was made into a puppet, she had not always been in Su Ruiying’s house. At first she was sent to the house of the Top Ten Master who caused her death.

That Top Ten Master did not like the looks of the puppet that he was given but pretended to be happy to receive it as it was from Su Ruiying. After Su Ruiying left, he threw the puppet on the floor and started ranting and railing against Su Ruiying, saying how ugly she was.

Who would have known that just a few days later, Su Ruiying returned to his residence to take the puppet back. It was only after she was back in Su Ruiying’s hands did she find out Su Ruiying’s secret.

The girl described the experience as having one’s soul ripped open to see what was inside. She never wanted to relive that memory again.

The girl’s words made Jun Wu Xie fall into contemplation. Obviously, Su Ruiying has a certain ability to control a soul, completely ignoring the soul’s own will.

Jun Wu Xie had planned to let the girl join them in a ruse, but now it seemed that this plan would not work.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao had earlier said things that could not be repeated to Su Ruiying so Jun Wu Xie had to find a way to dispose of that puppet.

The girl sensed the situation and knelt on the table and started to beg desperately.

Rong Ruo felt some pity for the girl, she had peace in neither life nor death, she was indeed pitiful. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Jun Wu Xie thought for a moment then put the girl back in the Cosmos Sack, but not before cutting off a piece of her sleeve. She took the sleeve and lightly charred it with the fire leaving a burn mark and left it on the table.

Both Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao could not sleep that night, Rong Ruo’s situation worried Jun Wu Xie and it left her sleepless. Jun Wu Yao, upon seeing her troubled expression, also could not fall asleep and both of them sat in the room till sunrise.

At dawn, there was a knock on the door.

The raspy voice of a ghost faced man could be heard through the door.

“City Lord Yan, Lady Ying has prepared breakfast and has invited you over”

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly, she carefully put puppet Rong Rao back in the Cosmos Sack and walked out of the room with Jun Wu Yao.

“I’ve got it, let’s go now.” Jun Wu Xie said flatly.

The ghost faced man lowered his head in a respectful gesture but he was really scanning the room out of the corner of his eye and spotted the piece of burnt sleeve on the table. He maintained his silence and led Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao to the dining hall.

Su Ruiying was already seated in the dining hall. When she saw Jun Wu Xie her blood red lips cracked into a smile.
