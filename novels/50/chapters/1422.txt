Chapter 1423: “Not Short of Money (4)”

The shopkeeper’s brows furrowed together as he stared at the expressionless and decrepit looking youth, his eyes filled with disdain.

He had seen many of these impoverished scoundrels before. There had been several other refugees who had wanted to buy land in the Clear Breeze City to live in some time ago and they did not have much money on them. They had then just knelt on their knees at his place to plead and beg without shame, refusing to budge, disturbing him from conducting his business in the shop and had even broken some things.

A businessman only had eyes for profit and the shopkeeper did not have the leisure to want to save those refugees.

“What are you doing?” The shopkeeper asked, his voice tinged with impatience.

Jun Wu Xie replied: “Buying land.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The shopkeeper cast his glance over Jun Wu Xie and his eyes filled up with contempt. He did not say anything to Jun Wu Xie but turned his head towards two assistants who were standing idle at the side to say: “You two dumb buffoons, what are you still doing there dreaming? Aren’t you going to throw this idiot who doesn’t know what he’s talking about out already! ? Don’t let him hold me back from doing business here!”

The two assistants immediately rolled up their sleeves as they walked towards Jun Wu Xie, looking like they were really going to throw Jun Wu Xie out of the place.

Jun Wu Xie’s brows creased together slightly as she stared at the shopkeeper’s disdainful expression before sweeping her gaze over the two approaching assistants.

“What? You do not want to sell them?” Jun Wu Xie asked with a sneer.

The shopkeeper then burst out laughing as he swung his highly mocking glare up and down over Jun Wu Xie.

“Our doors are open for business and we would naturally not refuse to sell. But we still have to look at what kind of people we are selling to as we only sell to people who can afford to pay. Little scoundrels like you should just get out of here and not remain here to be scorned.”

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes slightly and they filled up with a chill.

At that same moment, that prosperous tycoon Old Master Liu had also selected his new manor and under the assistant’s urging, he came walking over to stand before the shopkeeper.

The moment the shopkeeper saw the bling upon Old Master Liu, he immediately knew that that was a big deal coming in and he quickly eased his straight browed frown and chilly eyes, his face a mask of delight as he rubbed his hands in glee before Old Master Liu.

“Has the Old Master picked out his piece of land?” The speed of his change in attitude was truly astounding.

Old Master Liu nodded his head arrogantly, his pudgy arms happily slung around the assistants on each side of him as he said: “It’s alright I guess, being just barely big enough. It will have to do for now.”

“Yes yes yes, seeing that Old Master Liu is a dragon among men, ordinary manors would not be worth of you. You’ll have to put up with this one for the time being and when I come across a good piece of land in future, I will get someone to send the news over to you.” The shopkeeper said with a wide smile.

Old Master Liu nodded in satisfaction.

Meanwhile, the completely disregarded Jun Wu Xie at the side had a chilly expression on her face. The two assistants had already reached her sides and they reached the hands out wanting to throw her outside.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes flashed with a chilling glint.

In an instant, two howls of anguish rang out within the shop!

“ARRGGGH!”

Those howls that sounded just like the squealing of pigs immediately attracted the attention of others within the shop. Even the shopkeeper who was busy entertaining the “expensive” customer was shocked by the sound and he immediately turned his head over to see.

But that one look completely caused his heart to jump!

He saw the two assistants fallen onto the floor and grabbing at their elbows tightly, rolling across the floor in pain. The garish white of bones could be seen protruding out pierced through their arms, a large pool of blood flowing across the floor, the thick stench of blood immediately filling up the entire shop!

Jun Wu Xie still stood chillingly in her original spot, her glacier eyes piercing into one’s soul as she stared at the pale faced shopkeeper.

“You! What do you think you are doing!” The shopkeeper said as his heart thumped loudly.
