Chapter 762: “Flame Spirit Auction House (5)”

“But since Ling Yue is curious whether the Grand Adviser or that man is more outstanding, maybe it might be good if Little Xuan can help clear her doubts and I’ll pretend I did not hear anything and not speak to the Grand Adviser about it.” Lei Chen said with mirth in his eyes as he looked at Fu Xuan sitting at the side, his tone of familiarity shown with his extra endearing form of address.

Fu Xuan immediately blushed as her eyes flashed with joy a very brief moment before she replied: “I can’t really tell who is more good looking, as outward appearances are finally just empty shells. What’s more important is what’s inside, and if we are to judge just based on a face, we might very well just end up with a beautiful but useless idiot anyway.”

Fu Xuan might have put it across nonchalantly, but she might very well just have branded both Jun Wu Yao and the Grand Adviser as idiots from her insinuation in her statement.

Qu Ling Yue’s pure and uncomplicated mind did not capture the veiled innuendoes but Lei Chen fully caught the entire picture. He just smiled and did not comment further on it.

Fu Xuan noticed Lei Chen’s reaction and the corners of her mouth lifted in a smile.

“That man looks to be a perfect gentleman as well. When they came in, he was very protective and he was shielding his companion all that time. It makes me wonder if his small companion is his little brother or something, he was being so sweet.” Qu Ling Yue completely missed the point Fu Xuan was making and she just plopped by the window to stare at the handsome man, her eyes filled with adoration.

Lei Chen laughed and said: “Oh? What kind of a man could make Ling Yue’s heart flutter so? Have you fallen in love with him?”

Qu Ling Yue’s face flushed red and she shook her head in a hurry, saying: “I just find him good looking, and that’s all!” And she didn’t even dare look into Lei Chen’s eyes when she said that.

Lei Chen’s eyes narrowed but they quickly recovered to normal. He made a show of nonchalance and said: “I think I will need to see for myself just how good looking he is that he has got you so mesmerized and starry eyed.”

Qu Ling Yue flushed a deeper shade of red.

Lei Chen followed Qu Ling Yue’s line of sight and turned his gaze in the same direction. As expected, in an inconspicuous corner, he saw the man with his unparalleled good looks. But the mirth very quickly faded out from his eyes and he turned to Qu Ling Yue and said: “Do you know who that man is?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qu Ling Yue shook her head.

Lei Chen replied: “He is from the Zephyr Academy.”

“What?” Qu Ling Yue was stunned.

She was from the War Banner Academy and only two others, the Dragon Slayers Academy and the Zephyr Academy were able to stand on equal footing with them. Since a long time ago, these three academies had always been fiercely competing to suppress their opponents a notch and this inclination had directly rubbed off onto the disciples of the individual academies. When the disciples of these three academies encounter each other, a sliver of their competitive nature would involuntary surface.

“He is from the Zephyr Academy? How does Your Highness know?” Qu Ling Yue asked quickly.

Lei Chen told her: “They had just entered the city a little while ago. When they came in, their portraits were drawn up and handed to me. You already know that the Emperor, my father, has allowed me to be fully in charge of this year’s Spirit Battle Tournament and so I am rather familiar with the key members of the respective academies. Although I have yet to be able to get in touch with the people of the Zephyr Academy, but I am still able to remember their faces.”

Qu Ling Yue’s face creased up in a frown, as she looked at Lei Chen and then turned to look at the man on the first floor.

“But judging his age, he doesn’t look like he is here to take part in the Spirit Battle Tournament.”

“Even if he is not a disciple, he could be here as a teacher or something. The Zephyr Academy only sent a total of ten people this year, including the current Headmaster Fan Jin. Fan Jin had just earlier handed in the namelist of their participants for this year’s Spirit Battle Tournament and this year, the Zephyr Academy has only six people taking part in the tournament.” Lei Chen revealed.
