3050 Forgotten history 2

“Oh? Gods really existed here before?” Gu Ying’s face showed a trace of surprise. If Jun Wu Xie did not know that Gu Ying already knew it, she would have been deceived by his reaction.

Chi Yan said: “Highness Ying, whether or not God has really existed, I will not have to say further. You only need to climb this mountain and you will know everything. Don’t you want to witness this moment with your own eyes? ”

Gu Ying smiled, “Lord Chi Yan rarely said these things to me, but you don’t have to worry. Since Father has asked me to come, even if you didn’t say anything, I would go.”

Chi Yan was unimpressed. “It is the best thing if Highness Ying can naturally obey the command of His Lord.”

With Chi Yan and Gu Ying debating, it may seem calm, but the dark waves were surging.

Jun Wu Xie had become a real bystander. She had no interest in participating in the debate between Chi Yan and Gu Ying. What really made her care was Chi Yan’s words, whether the Gods of the Upper Realms really existed.

What was His Lord trying to find?

To say that His Lord was looking for that lost history, Jun Wu Xie would never believe it. In those lost sacred temples, there must be something very important. That thing may be the key to the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms.

“However, since the Gods have lived here, why have I been in the Upper Realm for so long, I haven’t heard of it, and judging from the response of Lady Ying, she doesn’t seem to know this place.” Gu Ying didn’t take it seriously but he had a pair of attitudes that break the casserole to the end.

Chi Yan’s expression was a bit gloomy. His slightly frowning brows had already revealed his displeasure. He looked at Gu Ying and remained silent for a moment before he said: “In the Upper Realm, the Sacred City is the boundary, and the 72 Cities stand on one side. On the other side, no one is allowed to set foot on the ground. Because it had been deserted for a long time, naturally not many people know that. If Highness Ying wants to know about the story, you can find someone to tell you after completing the task of His Lord. Let me tell you, now we don’t have that much time. ”

Gu Ying shrugged and no longer harped on the subject.

Chi Yan’s face was very unsightly. With a frown, he looked at Jun Wu Xie and said to others: “Is there any problem? If not, after we enter the mountain, you will have to obey my arrangement. Since His Lord left this task to me and I will not allow any mistakes. ”

Chi Yan talked and even Gu Ying who was usually at loggerheads with him didn’t say anything more. Su Ruiying and Jun Wu Xie would naturally kept quiet.

Everyone decided to enter the mountain.

The strange thing was that the mountain seemed to be right in front of them. When they stepped into the mountain, they were very close. But at a distance of half a meter, they could not see the figure of the person in front.

Chi Yan walked in the front, Jun Wu Xie was in the middle. When she and Jun Wu Yao moved forward, they could no longer see Chi Yan in the front.

There seemed to be something special in the air on this mountain. It seemed clear, but it was hazy.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao walked side by side. But after walking for a few steps, she turned her face, she already felt that Jun Wu Yao’s face was a little vague. ... RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But in the blink of an eye, Jun Wu Xie had already unknowingly walked into a mist. Chi Yan’s figure and others had disappeared, let alone Jun Wu Yao who was standing beside her. He was no longer visible!
