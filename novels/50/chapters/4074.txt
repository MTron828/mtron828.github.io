Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Before when I promised you, that as long as you completed the task I assigned you, you can go to Long Xuan City, but ...” Xu Zu’s eyes narrowed slightly, using the cover of darkness to hide the evil intention in his eyes.

“Long Xuan City has always been divided into regions. Although, I can bring you and your brother there, I cannot guarantee that you can enter a good area. But if you can complete this task even more fully; by helping us to observe the movements of Sea Spirit City, then to Long Xuan City, you are the ones who contributed a lot. Long Xuan City never ill-treats the people who have merits. At that time, I can appeal to the City Lord to bring you and your friend to a good area. I can even arrange for you both to train with the troops of Long Xuan City, or let you directly become the guards of Long Xuan City. What do you think of this arrangement? ”

Xu Zu lowered his voice, trying to bewitch his target.

Xu Zuo fully believed in the authenticity of this medicine. What remained was to go back to Long Xuan City to test the actual effect. Once determined, Ruan Zhongshan will definitely take a shot at Sea Spirit City. When the time came, if they could harmonize their attack from within the guards of Sea Spirit City and outside, it would be a beneficial thing for them.

Therefore...

Xu Zu dropped the bait once again, bewitching the ignorant teenager in front of him.

Fei Yan widened his eyes and looked at Xu Zu, as if confused by the promise in his words, it took him a long while to refocus and respond.

“You ... what you’re saying... is it true?”

“Of course.” Xu Zu’s face remained composed, but a vicious flash of light passed in his eyes. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After the mission, who would care about the kid’s life?

Fei Yan’s breathing became quicker. Under Xu Zu’s repeated beguiling, he flushed and said, “Okay! I will do it! I can do anything you need me to!”

Xu Zu smiled with satisfaction. He didn’t arrange any tasks for Fei Yan, but just made Fei Yan pay more attention to the movements of Sea Spirit City, especially the new workshop.

Fei Yan responded without hesitation.

Deep in the night, Xu Zu took his two men and left as quietly as they came, along with their inner expectations and pride.

What they didn’t know was ...

“I almost couldn’t hold back twisting the girl’s neck off!”

In the official residence, Fei Yan rubbed his arms which were shaking uncontrollably. Xu Zu’s self-righteous lie sounded like a lot of nonsense to him, and there was no “technical content”. Compared to the way Jun Wu Xie tricked others, it was simply like mud in the gutter.

Had it not been for the firm will of Fei Yan, he would have just punched that big mouth when Xu Zu started spouting his nonsense.

In the hall, no one left as they waited for Fei Yan’s news. Rong Ruo and the others, upon hearing Fei Yan’s narration, burst into laughter.

Xu Zu’s ability to con others was really too weak, and it was really difficult for Fei Yan to treat himself as an idiot, just so he could accommodate Xu Zu.

Regarding the Upper Realm’s methods of forcibly taking lands, verbal lies no longer hold any meaning to them. Compared to Fei Yan and the others, who had been struggling within the Three Realms for so many years; in a duel of words, ten Xu Zus could not be compared to one Jun Wu Xie.

“Okay, go and change your clothes first.” Rong Ruo couldn’t stand looking at an indignant Fei Yan, as he was still wearing the thin clothes during his meeting with Xu Zu, and said subconsciously.
