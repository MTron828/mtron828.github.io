Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

From the beginning to the end, Qiao Chu and others were completely ignored by Duan Qi . They didn’t even have a chance to introduce themselves. They just followed behind Jun Wu Xie, led by the maidens to the place where they lived.

The coldness of the Holy Mountain spread across the residence. Jun Wu Xie and the others settled down in the residence. The maidens left one after another, leaving two to serve the guests.

Jun Wu Xie assigned the two maidens to the hall to do some packing after which, she gathered Qiao Chu and others together.

“Oh, the Sacred Maiden Tribe is originally Little Lotus’ hometown? Little Xie, do you want to release Little Lotus? Maybe he can see his children and grandchildren here.” Qiao Chu smiled at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Qiao Chu as if she heard nothing.

Zheng Weilong and Ah Da went to their respective rooms after entering the residence. But Jun Wu Xie did not call them over.

Jun Wu Xie sat down on the chair and glanced at the furnishings in the house. Although the maidens were picky, the result was still good. The room was very elegant and noble. The gadgets were extremely delicate. The treasures that the owners of the 72 cities sent them earlier on were not as good as the decorations in the house of the maidens residence.

It’s no wonder that Han Shu would dislike Sea Spirit City to such an extent.

This Sacred Maiden Tribe was truly rich.

“Wu Yao, what have you noticed?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao. Although her spiritual power increased very fast, in terms of perception, she was not as good as Jun Wu Yao. Therefore, she had to find out from Jun Wu Yao the whereabouts of Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu here.

“Zi Fei is here, as for your father ... I didn’t feel his breath.” Jun Wu Yao opened his senses as soon as he stepped into the Holy Mountain. The breath of everyone in the tribe couldn’t escape his perception.

He had sensed the breath of Zi Fei, but had not found the one belonging to Jun Gu.

“He hasn’t arrived yet?” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“According to Duan Qi, there are still a few days before Senior Zi Fei and their parents get married. Uncle Jun Gu may not have reached the Holy Mountain. Little Xie, would you like to take advantage of this time to meet Senior Zi Fei? Maybe you find out something from her. It will be much easier to proceed if she knows about it in advance. ” Fan Zhuo proposed.

Jun Wu Xie thought for a moment, looked up to Jun Wu Yao and said, “Where is she? Is there anyone around her?”

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie. Although there was no abnormality on his face, he sighed in his heart.

Even Jun Wu Xie herself did not realize that her eagerness when mentioning about Zi Fei was not inferior to that of Jun Gu.

“Zi Fei’s strength is quite high. Few of the maidens are her opponents. She is definitely here. But there are no exponents guarding nearby. I think she should be safe for the time being and have some freedom.” Jun Wu Yao replied.

Jun Wu Xie frowned.

“Don’t panic at this moment. Duan Qi has mentioned that the Sacred Maiden Tribe will host a banquet to entertain you. According to the habit of the maiden, if they really want to treat you, they will naturally invite the saints to attend. You might as well wait until tonight to see if it is possible to see Zi Fei before you plan the next step. Will that be better? “Jun Wu Yao warmly said.

Jun Wu Xie thought about it and she agreed.
