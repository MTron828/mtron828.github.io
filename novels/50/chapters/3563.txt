Chapter 2158: Reinforcements from All Sides (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Spirit Jade Palace’s disciples had resolved to follow their Lord. Though the Spirit Jade Palace Lord was moved, he did not relax but immediately went on to make arrangements for several of his disciples to spread the news to all the territories once occupied by the Twelve Palaces in the past.

“My Lord, what are you planning?” The masked girl did not understand. The news that the Spirit Jade Palace Lord wanted her fellow sisters to spread was that a teacher of the Cloudy Brook Academy had been captured. Towards that, she did not understand why.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord then said: “The Nine Temples and the Twelve Palaces have from a very long time ago started to pick out outstanding disciples through the Battle of Deities Grand Meet. All of the disciple selected from there had then been sent into the Cloudy Brook Academy to further their cultivation practice, and released only when they meet the required standards. You must not underestimate the powers of these people though they have pledged their allegiance to powers on various sides, as they all had come out through the Cloudy Brook Academy’s doors afterall, the powers they possess tempered by the Cloudy Brook Academy. It is said that a day as one’s Master makes him one’s father for life! Although I wouldn’t know how many people this piece of news will bring, but even if only a few of them holds some conscience in their hearts, they would still be an additional bit of strength.”

Towards that decision, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had not had much of a choice. They had only five days, and that was just too short. The army in Jun Wu Xie’s hands before had disappeared from everyone’s sight since the Twelve Palaces’ Summit and she had immediately received such news the moment she returned. It was feared that she wouldn’t have enough time to summon for reinforcements.

“We won’t know..... how many people will turn up.....” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord could feel his heart drumming with nerves.

.....

In that afternoon on that day, Jun Wu Xie went to see Tian Ze one more time. Treating Tian Ze’s injuries for the last time, she left behind a large amount of elixirs, and asked Xue Er to take care of Tian Ze on her behalf. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Jun Xie! Are you going to Mount Fu Yao?” Tian Ze saw that Jun Wu Xie was readying things before she set out, and he could not help but feel anxious. Not caring about the wounds on his body, he started to want to get up.

That startled Xue Er to jump over to his side to help him.

“You..... You shouldn’t move yourself too much..... Your wounds will split open again.” Xue Er said with anxiety in her voice.

But Tian Ze could not concern himself with that as he looked at Jun Wu Xie who had already reached the door. “I’m coming with all of you!”

Jun Wu Xie’s footsteps halted and she turned herself around, to look at Tian Ze who was struggling so hard to even get up before shaking her head slowly.

“Master Uncle needs to get some good rest. I will save Master. There is no need for Master Uncle to worry.”

How could Tian Ze possibly listen to her. He forced himself to hobble shakily over to Jun Wu Xie, and gripped Jun Wu Xie by the wrist, his eyes firm and resolute as he said: “I’m coming with you.” Having survived from the very brink of death, Tian Ze’s mind had grown to become calmer.

With such a massively tremendous enemy like the Nine Temples before them, how could Jun Wu Xie and the others possibly be able to stand against them? If he had not told her, Jun Wu Xie would not have even known about the matter at all, and she would not have thrown herself into such a crisis. Knowing very well just how powerful the Nine Temples were, how could he possibly just watch Jun Wu Xie go resist the Nine Temples alone?

Jun Wu Xie pulled Tian Ze’s hand off and said indifferently: “Master Uncle, with the state you are in, not to mention having you help. I fear that when we get to Mount Fu Yao, I will have to split up my attention to look after you.”

Tian Ze was slightly shook, his eyes showing despair and grief.

Jun Wu Xie’s words were cruel and harsh, but it truthfully revealed the reality before Tian Ze’s eyes. Tian Ze looked at his broken and wretched body, a highly bitter taste in his mouth.

That’s right. With the state he was in, it was such an arduous task for him to even walk, so how was he going to take part in the battle?

Even if he managed to drag this badly battered body over to Mount Fu Yao, he would only add on to Jun Wu Xie’s burden.
