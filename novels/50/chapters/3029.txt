Chapter 3030 Chaotic Memory 3

“In the beginning, we were not called the Knights of Destruction. To be precise, the Knights of Destruction was just a whim of His Lord. When Chi Yan and I were beside him, Long Yao and Jun Gu did not appear yet. It was later. Suddenly the idea of ​​forming Knights of Destruction was raised by His Lord. That was the way it was created. “Su Ruiying’s voice was calm.

“Oh? So, you and Chi Yan haven’t lost your memories?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes flashed a chill.

According to the previous statement, to become a Knight of Destruction, you must clear all the previous memories, but from Su Ruiying’s words, she and Chi Yan did not seem to lose the memories of the past.

This question should obviously not be asked by Jun Wu Xie, nor should Su Ruiying answer it.

But that word came to Su Ruiying’s mouth involuntarily, “Yes, Chi Yan is in charge of the Knights of Destruction and I am responsible for the souls. Naturally, I don’t need to clean my memory. Furthermore, we have always followed His Lord. Around me, my memory is only His Lord.”

“Lady Ying, do you remember Ye Jue?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

Su Ruiying’s eyes suddenly appeared to be struggling. But the struggling disappeared in an instant, the green smoke from the incense with a faint scent lingered before Su Ruiying took another breath and it smoothened the chaos in her heart.

“Ye Jue? I remember, of course I remember, that is the person who cares most about His Lord.”

“The person who cares most? What do you know?” Jun Wu Xie continued to ask.

Su Ruiying’s eyes gradually became dull. She opened her mouth to say everything she knew.

At this moment, Jun Wu Xie knew how Jun Wu Yao had been tricked.

Jun Wu Yao did go to the underground palace. In fact, the life and death worm in Jun Wu Yao’s body was planted in the underground palace. At the time, Su Ruiying was also present beside His Lord. She witnessed Jun Wu Yao being planted with the life and death worm.

In fact, not only Jun Wu Yao, but also Long Yao was cleansed of all memories in the underground palace.

But Su Ruiying’s words made Jun Wu Xie feel a little puzzled.

Jun Wu Yao’s memory seems to be blank. He only remembered that he was aware of His Lord’s conspiracy after he got the life and death worm, and then he escaped from the Upper Realm. However, according to Su Ruiying’s statement and Jun Wu Yao’s incomplete memory, His Lord should have seized Jun Wu Yao much earlier. Since he can get the life and death worm on Jun Wu Yao’s body, how could His Lord let Jun Wu Yao escape from the Upper Realm?

Jun Wu Xie always felt that she had overlooked something, and the timing of the life and death worm in Jun Wu Xie looks a bit strange. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The room was quiet. Su Ruiying didn’t hear Jun Wu Xie’s inquiry. She just sat on the chair blankly and stared ahead with dull eyes.

Jun Wu Xie frowned, looking at Jun Wu Yao who was still lying unconscious in bed. Something flashed in her heart, she stood up and whispered in Su Ruiying’s ear. Su Ruiying seemed to be struck by lightning. With this, her dull eyes became clear in an instant and she looked at Jun Wu Xie standing beside her with surprise. Her gazes became a little panicked.

“It’s nothing, Lady Ying can go back first.” Jun Wu Xie said with a cold face.
