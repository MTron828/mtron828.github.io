Thinking back, when they had first met for the first time, she was also like that. She was so frail and so seemingly fragile, it was as if the wind and rain could carry her away. At that time, he would never have thought that this young lady at the brink of death would be tied to him in fate.

Her indifference, her ignorance, her smile, her strength. All of these flashed by in his mind, each picture was so beautiful and he could not bear to forget any of them even for a second.

He had personally witnessed her growth, from indifference, she became someone who slowly discovered anger and various emotions. From the initial unsheathed sword, to a warm embrace.

Remember her body temperature.

Remember her taste.

Remember the feeling of his fingertips when they slid he down her hair.

Remember her awkward but gentle kiss.

Remember the satisfaction and happiness while holding her in his embrace.

Jun Wu Yao’s eyes were smiling and his lips gently raised.

“Meeting you was the best thing.”

With a loud resounding clank, he secured the Soul Binding Chains on his wrist, the very same once had locked him up for a thousand years.

This time, he was the one who took the initiative to put on these deadly shackles.

Jun Wu Xie did not move and stood still in place, fresh blood dripped down from her dress to the ground. She looked at him with wide eyes, although he was so near, yet he seemed so far.

He was just so close. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Suddenly, Jun Wu Xie’s figure flashed and immediately rushed to Luo Qingcheng.

The heart of Luo Qingcheng had long been stimulated by Jun Wu Yao’s words and she was so close to going mad. Seeing Jun Wu Xie’s sudden movement, she could not help but feel surprised.

With such heavy injuries, how could she still move!?

“Seeking death!” Luo Qingcheng fiercely struck out and attacked Jun Wu Xie who had rushed over once again.

However, at the moment when Luo Qingcheng struck out, Jun Wu Yao suddenly appeared and protected Jun Wu Xie in his arms as he used his back to block the blow of Luo Qingcheng.

With the soul Binding Chains in place, he did not even have the ability to defend.

Jun Wu Xie who was protected by Jun Wu Yao was gasping heavily in his arms. Although his hold was very tight, yet it was so gentle. Fresh blood trickled down from his jaw and landed on her forehead, it was so warm and it had scalded her heart.

Jun Wu Xie looked at him in shock, her two hands pushed against him in a futile struggle, her mind completely blank.

“Don’t be impulsive. Be good, listen obediently.” Jun Wu Yao’s magnetic voice reached her ears, they were full of affection and filled with gentleness.

His Little Xie’er had not grown up, she needed to live on and finish her life.

“Don’t go...” Jun Wu Xie held on tightly to his sleeves, refusing to let go.

Jun Wu Yao did not speak much and they ran his fingers down her hair, his eyes strongly suppressed his desire to be with her.

“Ye Jue, if you don’t follow me now, I am not sure if I will abide by my promise.” Luo Qingcheng could no longer take it and spat out in rage.

If not for Jun Wu Yao’s threat, she would definitely kill Jun Wu Xie!

Jun Wu Yao raised his hand and gently pried her fingers off his sleeves.

This was the only way that he could protect Little Xie’er from harm.

“Wait for me.” Jun Wu Xie said in a determined voice.

“Alright.”

“I will definitely save you.”

“Mn, I will wait for you.”

Jun Wu Xie released her trembling hands, she did not know how much willpower she needed to suppress the impulse to hold on to him.

Luo Qingcheng immediately took Jun Wu Yao away as she looked at Jun Wu Xie coldly. As she left, she signalled to a black robed man at the side.

Kill all!

It was absolutely impossible to let Jun Wu Xie live!
