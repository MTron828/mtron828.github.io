Chapter 2217: The Mystery of the Three Realms (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“The reason why the Upper Realm did not strike on the Lower Realm was not because they were too arrogant to but because they did not dare to! At the beginning, they had also tried to send people to the Lower Realm. Unfortunately, the moment those people entered, not only did they suffer from their body’s rejection, what was most terrifying was that not only did the environment in the Lower Realm not help them in any way with the measly spirit qi, but it also had a very strange power – it would continue to drain and empty their spiritual energy from their bodies!” Ren Huang narrowed his eyes as he spoke in a sombre tone.

The environment of the Lower Realm was simply a nightmare for the people of the Upper Realm. Some from the Upper Realm had tried to stay in the Lower Realm but at most in one year, they would be drained beyond exhaustion and die. Since then, no one from the Upper Realm would dare to arbitrarily enter the Lower Realm.

Fortunately for the Lower Realm, with the sparse spirit qi, the strength of the people from the Upper Realm was also incredibly weak. To the people from the Upper Realm, they were of no threat to them hence they had left them alone. Anyway, the Blood Sacrifice Array had been laid out in the Middle Realm, once activated, it would cover the entire three realms.

For all the various reasons, the Upper Realm had left the Lower Realm on its own without care.

With Ren Huang’s explanation, everything became clear in an instant.

The difference between the Upper Realm and the Lower Realm was like the plains and the mountains, the concentration of oxygen in the air differed and with the sudden change in the oxygen level, the body would not be able to adapt and would result in a strong rejection.

It was only that this phenomenon was called altitude sickness in the previous world. In the three realms, instead of the lack of oxygen, it was the lack of spirit qi. In addition, the life expectancy of the people from the Upper Realm was very high, and their dependence on spirit qi was much higher, way beyond an ordinary person’s. Which was why it was difficult to adapt to the drastic difference in spirit qi and it would result in the death from spirit qi exhaustion.

Of course, there were still many different places that existed, that is from the plains to the mountains, it would not squeeze out all the oxygen in the body. However, those from the Upper Realm that went to the Lower Realm would release all the spirit energy from that person’s body at an explosive rate. Those from the Middle Realm did not have a drastic difference from the Upper Realm or the Lower Realm which was why they did not have any excessive reaction.

“That was why they had trapped you in the Lower Realm, in the hopes that the power of the Lower Realm would suppress you?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao, when they had first met, wasn’t it in the Lower Realm?

Jun Wu Yao nodded his head slightly.

Ren Huang looked at Jun Wu Yao with a face full of shock.

“You were trapped in the Lower Realm? But that also makes sense, if you were kept in the Upper Realm or the Middle Realm, it would not be long before you would be able to break free on your own. However, if you were trapped in the Lower Realm, your strength would be drained by the Lower Realm, and it would only accelerate the speed of losing your power...”

The Upper Realm had trapped Jun Wu Yao in the Lower Realm without leaving anyone to guard. They had confidence in the special environment of the Lower Realm. Because of Jun Wu Yao’s overwhelming strength, if it was any other person from the Upper Realm, in a millennium, I’m afraid that that person would have been sucked dry of all the spirit qi by the Lower Realm and would have long turned into a shrivelled up corpse!

“No wonder... No wonder I felt ....that your strength was much weaker than before...” Ren Huang muttered to himself.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord who had been listening at the side all this while almost vomited out blood.

This was called ‘ much weaker than before ‘?

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord most wanted to dig his eyes out, even if he had not witnessed Jun Wu Yao’s strength, he could also sense that it was much stronger than Ren Huang.

With such a startling strength, and yet from the mouth of Ren Huang... it had became ‘weaker’, and not only just ‘weaker’... It was ‘ much weaker ‘!!!
