Chapter 2828: Perfect Acting (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Although Duan Qi and Elder Yun felt that Han Zi Fei’s attitude was a little too frivolous, Han Zi Fei had given a certain amount of face, so naturally they didn’t say much.

Han Zi Fei saw the reaction of Duan Qi and the others as a cold glint flashed across her eyes as a sneer appeared on her beautiful face. She pretended to look at Jun Wu Xie casually and although there was no abnormal expression on her face, she was extremely shocked in her heart.

Why did Jun Wu Xie come to The Sacred Maiden Tribe? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

And...

Han Zi Fei remembered what Han Shu had said before. She couldn’t recover from her shock for a long time.

Her Little Xie turned out to be the strong Dual Spirit Ring exponent?!!

How could this be...

At this moment, the only thing Han Zi Fei could do was to keep calm. She would never let Duan Qi realize that she and Jun Wu Xie knew each other.

In this regard, both Jun Wu Xie and Han Zi Fei had exactly the same idea.

Jun Wu Xie smiled indifferently to Han Zi Fei’s insignificance.

Obviously, Han Zi Fei was smarter than she thought.

Just seeing Han Zi Fei’s situation today, Jun Wu Xie became more confused.

Just like what Jun Wu Yao had mentioned before, in terms of Han Zi Fei’s strength, there was almost no one in the Sacred Maiden Tribe who could suppress it. But why did she return? Back to this prison where she had escaped for thousands of years?

That was where Jun Wu Xie couldn’t understand.

Duan Qi and the other’s reaction towards Han Zi Fei seemed to be worried about her yet they also seem to be guarding against her. Despite all of this, there was no intention of suppressing her at all. Han Zi Fei’s personal freedom seemed to be completely unrestricted. Previously, Jun Wu Xie and others had guessed that she was under control. But now, her situation was completely different from what they had initially thought.

Obviously, it was Han Zi Fei’s own will to return to the Sacred Maiden Tribe and stayed here.

But...

Why?

Jun Wu Xie didn’t understand. If this was Han Zi Fei’s own choice, she would naturally respect it. If Han Zi Fei really finds her beloved, she would give her blessings but this did not include Jun Gu, or at least until Jun Gu had regained his freedom. Jun Wu Xie did not want her father to do anything against his will and be under control.

Thinking of this, Jun Wu Xie suddenly said: “I heard that the Sacred Maiden will soon marry one of the Knights of Destruction?”

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie, a smile flashed across her eyes.

Her little girl seemed to be worried.

“Yes, in a few days, I will marry Lord Jun Gu.” Han Zi Fei said with a smile.

“Lord Jun Gu is the one who became the Knight of Destruction at a later time. I wonder if the Sacred Maiden has ever seen him before?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Han Zi Fei and her heart was a little complicated. She was extremely fond of Han Zi Fei, but ... the person of Han Zi Fei’s marriage would place Jun Wu Xie into an awkward position.

According to her calculations, Han Zi Fei fled from the Upper Realm for thousands of years, but Jun Gu came to the Upper Realm more than ten years ago and had recently became a Knight of Destruction. Han Zi Fei only returned a while ago. According to the timeline, she should have never met Jun Gu before.

If there were no feelings, Jun Wu Xie would do things without any burden.

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie with a smile that did not resemble a smile. Jun Wu Xie’s meaning was clear to her. Her little girl seemed to be tangled about her marriage with Jun Gu.

“Is this important? Lord Jun Gu is the Knight of Destruction. There’s no need to doubt what an excellent man he is. I think it should be the wish of every woman to marry such a man.” Han Zi Fei lowered her gaze and narrowed her eyes as a glint flashed by.
