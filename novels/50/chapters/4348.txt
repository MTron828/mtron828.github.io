The poisonous mist came by unexpectedly. Fei Yan did not have any time to react. When the poisonous mist rushed to his face, a piercing pain suddenly spread on his face!

“Ahhhhhhh!” The harsh scream burst from Fei Yan’s mouth. Suddenly his figure crashed to the ground. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Rong Ruo’s eyes widened in disbelief. She wanted to stand up in a hurry, but with a slight movement, her brain exploded. She froze as if she had broken her tibia. Everything in front of her became extremely blurred .

Fang Jinghe pant lightly as he landed onto the ground. His half squinted eyes looked down at the ground, covering Fei Yan’s sorrowful face. He spat a mouthful of black saliva.

The poison hidden in his mouth was his last life-saving chip. He never expected that he would be forced by a spirit inscription exponent to use the venom in his mouth .

The improvement of Fei Yan’s strength was too amazing. Fang Jinghe almost messed it up. Fortunately, he had the protection of the Spirit Ring. In addition, Fei Yan had been seriously injured and poisoned.

If Fang Jinghe continued to fight Fei Yan, even if he could kill them, he was afraid that he couldn’t retreat.

The selection was imminent. But Fang Jinghe didn’t want to get hurt which directly triggered the lore.

A wailing mourn broke through the sky. The flesh on Fei Yan’s face seemed to be splashed by the corpse water. It turned into a pool of blood, dripping from his fingers. The kind of painful pain of being bitten by the flesh was simply unbearable.

But for a short time, Fei Yan’s hands had been covered with blood. His cheeks were exposed beneath the fingers. There was a piece of good skin even the bones exposed to the air after the flesh was corroded ...

“Oh, little devil, you are a little capable, but you’re still too tender.” Fang Jinghe breathed a sigh of relief, pretending to be arrogant, His eyes were no longer contented like before. Instead he became a lot more cautious and had mustered a lot of killing intent.

This little devil’s strength was so weird that he could not keep him alive!

When Fang Jinghe thought of this, he immediately stepped forward and walked towards Fei Yan.

Fei Yan’s eyes were hurt by poisonous mist. Her eyes were dark and could not see anything. But the pain was so clear. The most terrible thing was that he could feel that when Fang Jinghe approached. He could only use his spirit energy and evoked the poison in his body. Now he couldn’t see or move. There was only a dead end.

He could clearly feel that Fang Jinghe had come to his side. At this moment, he seemed to foresee death coming.

Obviously he did not want to die. He had many unfinished wishes. But Fei Yan smiled for no reason. He raised his blood-stained hand in the dark, showing the gesture that only he and Rong Ruo knew.

He knew that Little Ruo could definitely see it.

Xiao Ruo was smarter than him. As long as he could delay Fang Jinghe for a moment, Little Ruo would find a way to escape.

As long as Little Ruo could survive and escape, what’s the big deal?

He felt Fang Jinghe approaching. That dangerous and murderous force was right in front of him ...

When Fei Yan was ready to face death, that lingering force from Fang Jinghe in front of him distanced away! !!
