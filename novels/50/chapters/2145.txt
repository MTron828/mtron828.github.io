Chapter 2146: Unexpected Happening (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A hunched over figure was shuffling his way past through the crowded street. The figure had a tall and large framed body but it was not known why his back was hunched over so much. The clothes on his body were covered over with filth and his hands that were exposed out of those clothes were festering with sores. His face was completely covered in wounds with most of them rotting and badly inflamed, looking very much a frightful sight.

People who passed him on the road were rather fearful of him where they subconsciously avoided him, the eyes gazing at him helplessly filling up with pity.

This past year, with the Twelve Palaces destroyed, the Spirit Jade Palace rose in power. The places that the Twelve Palaces originally occupied were liberated and the people in the various major cities found their lives becoming a whole lot better. It was hard to imagine that under such circumstances, such a wretched and pitiful person would still appear. From the way he looked, he would seem to be a beggar who was afflicted with a severe illness.

“Ay! Big Brother over there! There’s some steaming hot buns here. Have a few!” A kind hearted youth selling buns could not help himself but to call out when he saw the person’s pitiful state.

That person’s footsteps paused slightly as he turned his head back to look. When the face that had more than half of it rotten was revealed to the youth, the youth was taken by shock with a jump and the smile on his face froze, a trace of horror rising up in his eyes.

The person quickly lowered his head and did not dare to look at the other party anymore, but just said in a hoarse and raspy voice: “No..... No need..... I..... have no money.....”

That voice was extraordinarily grating on the ears, like someone was throttling his throat. If one was to look carefully, they would then discover that the person’s neck had several wounds on it, the flesh at the edges of those wounds curled to expose the insides, where it was clear that he had injured his throat.

The youth gulped saliva back down his throat and only managed to collect back his senses after quite a struggle. He glanced up at his father beside him and saw his father give him a nod. He immediately grabbed a piece of paper and wrapped it around a few buns before running with quick steps to that person’s side, and shoved the buns into his hands.

“You don’t need to pay for these. Just go ahead and eat them. If you go hungry in future, just come to our shop. We do not have much else here, but we can still afford to give you a few buns.” The youth said with a smile.

The person was slightly taken aback, and it was clear that he had not expected to encounter such a kind hearted person as he nodded his head repeatedly looking highly choked up, unable to say another word.

“Looking at the state you’re in, I think you are carrying wounds on your body. You can go to the Spirit Jade Palace branch. They have a free physician there and they will treat you for free.” The youth said kind heartedly.

Ever since the Spirit Jade Palace took over the city, the citizens lived in peace and contentment. With their hands feeling richer, kindness grew more abundant as well.

That person merely lowered his head and nodded slowly, his dry and parched throat squeezing out an almost inaudible “thank you”.

Seeing the man reacting like that, the youth did not say anything more, thinking that the person would go seek treatment.

The person held the steaming hot buns and picked up one with a hand that was covered with festering sores to slowly raise it up to his mouth. When the soft bun went into his mouth, what was just the most common of foods was at that moment more delicious than any exotic delicacy.

Two hot streams of tears fell from his eyes, his hunched over back trembling slightly as he suppressed the agonizing torment he felt inside.

“Meh meh! !” Suddenly, a strange sound sounded out in the street. That person turned his head to look and saw a masked girl together with a youth delicate with delicately attractive features weaving through the people on the street. A big eared rabbit and a rotund little lamb was following behind the youth, the little lamb bleating as it followed, seemingly in high spirits.

But when that person saw the face of the youthful male, he froze completely, and the bun in his hand suddenly fell to the ground.....
