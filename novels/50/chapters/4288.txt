Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

No one in the Upper Realms knows the type of future that the strength of the Dual Spirit Ring would bring. When Elder Luo heard about this young man and Dual Spirit Ring, she changed drastically.

“It turned out to be a strong young man.” Elder Luo’s enchanted face raised a smile, and her look at Jun Wu Xie was no longer so picky.

Elder Yun secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

“Then come in and talk.” Elder Luo’s face eased a little, giving way, Elder Yun and Jun Wu Xie entered the door. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Inside the Holy Land, it was not as dark as an ordinary cave. Like the outside world, it was pure white. The white here was not caused by white snow but built up by layers of cold ice.

At the top of the cave, a number of ice lamps hung high, glittering with a bright light. The light was reflected by the ice inside the cave and the ground, and the whole cave was brightly illuminated.

The slightest chill, seeping from the ice, Elder Yun could not help but tighten her cloak.

The cold chill would cause those maiden with low spirit energy to feel discomfort every time they set their foot in the Holy Land.

As soon as Jun Wu Xie stepped into this holy place, she could feel that her calm spiritual power was being stimulated. It was boiling fast, and that feeling surprised Jun Wu Xie slightly.

No wonder even Han Zi Fei suggested that Jun Wu Xie come here to cultivate, this was indeed the best place to cultivate psychic force strength!

The entire cave area was very wide and large. It would not make people feel crowded and cramped at all. Elder Luo was the sole guardian of the Holy Land. There were several independent igloos in the Holy Land. The residences of Elder Luo, which were relatively small. They were specially provided for elders, maiden and noble guests who come to cultivate in the Holy Land.

Although it was not far from the residences of the Sacred Maiden Tribe to the Holy Land, the temperature difference between the two places was huge. The Sacred Maiden Tribe’s very own spiritual power was not very strong. The tribe could not rely on its own spiritual power to resist the sudden drop in cold temperature. For those who want to cultivate in the Holy Land, they would mostly choose to live directly in the Holy Land.

Those who were fortunate enough to be able to enter the Holy Land to cultivate, naturally want to seize every minute and every second to stay in the Holy Land to cultivate their own spiritual power. If the opportunity was missed, you would never have it again.

Elder Luo took Jun Wu Xie and Elder Yun to visit every part in the holy place.

Jun Wu Xie was very satisfied with the purity of the ice and snow world. Regardless of whether it was the Sacred Maiden Tribe or the Holy Mountain, everyone regards them as holy as they are. After spending several days in the Sacred Maiden Tribe, Jun Wu Xie gradually lost curiosity about this race.

From the perspective of Jun Wu Xie, Han Shu and others’ battles and intrigues were no different from those around them. To Jun Wu Xie, they had disgraced the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

“I don’t know if Lord Yan intends to cultivate here continuously, or ?” Elder Luo’s attitude towards Jun Wu Xie had changed significantly. Although her proud look had not changed, she was finally willing to look at Jun Wu Xie. .

“I will go back at night.” Jun Wu Xie said.

She had a lot of things to deal with. Even if the opportunity was rare, she could not stay here to cultivate in peace for a few days.

“Oh? The decision of Lord Yan is really strange. You must know that rarely any guest who can enter this holy place will choose to leave during the cultivation.” Elder Luo slightly raised her eyebrows, a little surprised by Jun Wu Xie’s reply.
