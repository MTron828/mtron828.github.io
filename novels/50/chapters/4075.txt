Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Fei Yan was talking with exuberance, but upon hearing Rong Ruo’s sudden words, he stiffened and the whole hall became extremely quiet.

“Xiao Ruo ...” Fei Yan turned to look at Rong Ruo, his eyes were dull.

Rong Ruo had just spoke subconsciously, and did not feel that there was anything wrong, but the Fei Yan’s expression made her realize that... she seemed to have spoken out of turn.

“Xiao Ruo, are you showing your concern for me?” Fei Yan opened his eyes wide and looked at Rong Ruo. After he showed his true feelings to Rong Ruo, Rong Ruo had always avoided him, the two people who had once been inseparable, were now distanced. Although they were still great companions in life and death, they are no longer as intimate as the time in Cloudy Brook Academy.

At that time, Rong Ruo and Fei Yan were brought back to the Lower Realm by Yan Bugui. Fei Yan had watched his whole family being massacred and was greatly affected. When he closed his eyes, all he could see was the fiery and bloody scene as if a demon was unleashed from hell. He was so traumatised that he didn’t dare to close his eyes at all. He was also terrified of Yan Bugui.

It was Rong Ruo, who came to his side at that time, no matter how he resisted and screamed, she stubbornly sat with him in the corner. She did not speak nor make a sound. Two small figures quietly sat in the corner of the room for a whole day and night. At that time, Fei Yan was still very young and had just gone through a traumatic experience, and he didn’t dare to close his eyes. His immature body also could not handle the torment of such loss, and slowly they fell asleep.

Strangely, that night, he slept very peacefully. Terrible nightmares never came to bother him again as he slept till dawn. When he woke up, he found that he had fallen asleep while sitting in the corner, and he had rested his head on Rong Ruo’s small shoulder. At that time, Rong Ruo had also fallen asleep.

It was such a silent companionship, but it made Fei Yan’s day more bearable. He was unwilling to go out, he only dared to stay in the room and Rong Ruo accompanied him that way. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When he was young, he didn’t understand emotions, only dependence. When he grew up, this dependence continued. He and Qiao Chu grew up together in Cloudy Brook Academy, and their relationship was very good, but the best relationship was with Rong Ruo.

Until...

At the first awakening of love, the dependence hidden in his heart quietly blossomed and bore fruit.

Unexpectedly, his recklessness had caused Rong Ruo’s resistance.

In recent years, they have not been idle due to Jun Wu Xie’s disappearance, their nerves have been stretched at almost every moment, but Fei Yan could still feel that Rong Ruo has distanced herself from him. To outsiders, it might not seem obvious, but to him it was so clear.

Rong Ruo has not cared for him so thoughtfully for a long time.

“Ahem.” Rong Ruo noticed her mistake and immediately looked away from Fei Yan.

Qiao Chu observed the weird atmosphere in the hall and looked at Fei Yan’s happy face for a moment, and then looked at an embarrassed Rong Ruo for a moment.

Always felt...

Like there was something wrong.

However, Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo thought carefully, and discovered the subtle changes between Fei Yan and Rong Ruo early on.

But, the palm and back of the hand are all meat, and it’s inappropriate for anyone to help them. Besides, there was really no room for them to intervene in such things.

“Xiao Ruo, I know! You won’t not care about.” Fei Yan opened his arms and gave Rong Ruo a hug!

Rong Ruo ducked away immediately.
