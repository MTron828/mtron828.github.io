“This has nothing to do with you.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Yan Wan coldly, as she lifted her hand slightly, that dazzling aura flashed.

Yan Wan finally understood the severity of his situation as he felt cold dread spread all over his body. At this moment, he finally realised that those men he had sent before, were not killed by others. They were killed by one person, Jun Wu Xie herself! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In an instant, blood drained from Yan Wan’s face. He no longer was overly arrogant.

“Then now, you will die willingly?” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes as they radiated with cold light.

Yan Wan’s plan which all depended on the fact that his powers were stronger and that could crush Jun Wu Xie completely. But, Jun Wu Xie had become stronger than him, and his plan vanished in a puff of smoke.

In the Upper Realm, strength was the true way of survival!

No one would have guessed that the tide would turn in this situation. When everyone thought that Jun Wu Xie would face certain death, no one could have known that in a blink of an eye, the person who fall into desperate straits would be Yan Wan!

Even Old He, who had been helping Yan Wan in secret, who having witnessed this scene, his mood plunged to the bottom of the valley. He was once a Spirit RIng exponent, so he knew more than anyone present the true strength of a Spirit Ring. The ring that Jun Wu Xie possessed is extremely strong, it even surpassed the Spirit Ring which he could previously condensed. Yan Wan definitely could not contend against this!

Silence fell upon the whole courtyard. Jun Wu Xie’s words were like a death penalty bestowed upon Yan Wan.

Yan Wan’s face remained white as he looked at Jun Wu Xie in dear. In a blink of an eye, his face suddenly broke into a fake and awkward smile.

“Ah Hai, what are you saying? Don’t tell you that just because of one woman, you want to kill your father? There must be some misunderstanding. Liang Shi Shi is just a cheap woman after all, no need to be so serious.”

The previous questioning was made to look like a joke at this moment. For the first time, Zhang Wan took off his aloof and distant attitude in front of Jun Wu Xie, as if a father was joking with his son.

However, no one could laugh.

“Don’t be serious?” Jun Wu Xie quirked her brows, she had witnessed the speed at which people of the Upper Realm change their attitudes. If she didn’t have a Spirit Ring, how could Yan Wan come up with such a ridiculous explanation?

“My Lord, you didn’t say those things just now. Did you not want me to die?” Jun Wu Xie’s voice did not contain a hint of warmth.

Yan Wan’s face became even more unsightly, but he still had to put up a smiling facade, as he tried to sweet talk Jun Wu Xie, “That was just a joke. You are my son. Why would I be mad at you?”

Jun Wu Xie didn’t speak, she just looked at Yan Wan and his change of attitude, as she seemed to be thinking about something else.

Yan Wan’s heart felt like he had just eaten shit. On one hand, he regretted that he didn’t slaughter Yan Hai when he was born. And on the other hand, he regretted going against Jun Wu Xie at the moment. If he had known that Jun Wu Xie was already a Spirit Ring exponent, even if he had ten times the courage, he still would not go head to head with Jun Wu Xie.

Just as Yan Wan thought could temporarily hold off Jun Wu Xie as he thought of other solutions, the figure of Jun Wu Xie suddenly flashed in front of the crowd.

Yan Wan could barely react, a sharp pain came from his chest.

He looked down at himself in an awkward manner, and saw a bloody hole in his chest that was caused by the Spirit Ring, and widened his eyes incredulously.

“Sorry, I don’t intend to joke with you.” The cold voice of Jun Wu Xie echoed through the silent courtyard.
