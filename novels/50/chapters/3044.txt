3045 The Lost Temples 5

“Lady Ying? Is there anything wrong? You’ve been acting strangely these few days.” The ghoul masked man asked with trepidation.

Su Ruiying shook her head, “I don’t know what’s wrong, I just have a feeling something terrible is going to happen.”

“Is it because of this mission? With Lord Chi Yan at the helm, I’m sure there will be no problem. His Lord must be very confident to make such a decision.” the ghoul masked man tried to reassure her.

Su Ruiying was not comforted and continued to look at the box, “You don’t understand, I can’t put this feeling in words. Oh yes, before when Yan Hai was in my residence, didn’t he ask me to take a look at his servant because he was sick? After that I had a strange feeling, as if I had forgotten something.”

This was troubling Su Ruiying greatly, she felt like she had spent a good amount of time in Jun Wu Xie’s room but did not remember much.

“I’m afraid Lady Ying might be overthinking things, I don’t remember you spending much time in the room so there shouldn’t be a problem. Did what Yan Hai do to Lord Long Yao cause you to be anxious around him?” the ghoul masked man asked.

“I’m unclear myself, that could be it.” Su Ruiying heaved a sigh, her eyes not leaving the mahogany box.

The ghoul masked man saw what she was looking at and said in a gentle tone, “This box has been with you for many years and you still keep it.”

Su Ruiying’s was a little uneasy and said casually: “I don’t know why but as long as I hold it, I feel very at ease, perhaps because of the things inside it.

The ghoul masked man remained silent. In fact, the box’s contents changed frequently, with only the box itself remaining constant. The box was old and had previously been damaged many times and it was only with several repairs that it was able to last that long.

“I’m quite indifferent to Yan Hai for now. Regarding this mission, I am quite afraid. Highness Ying and the Knights of Destruction have never had a good relationship and Chi Yan was quite rude to him earlier. I don’t understand why His Lord sent Highness Ying on this mission, not to mention Yan Hai who hasn’t been cleansed. With Chi Yan’s personality, I fear there will be much trouble. And he had to bring that troublemaker Qin Qi along, who knows how such a frivolous man managed to earn Chi Yan’s trust?!” Su Ruiying frowned but some colour had returned to her face. She detested Qin Qi, a man who did not dare to look people in the eyes always made her suspicious. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Lady Ying doesn’t need to bother with all that, we are only following orders and just need to listen to Lord Chi Yan’s instructions. If there really are issues, it will be between Lord Chi Yan and Highness Ying and have nothing to do with us.” the ghoul masked man sensed something was wrong with Su Ruiying and could only try to comfort her.

“That’s true. Even if the sky were to fall, Chi Yan will be there to hold it up. What do I have to worry about?” Su Ruiying said as if to try and comfort herself.
