Duan Qi frowned as she observed Yan Xi’s reaction. Shrewd as she was, how could she not notice the intention of Yan Xi.

“It was His Lord’s intention to send you to Lord Jun Gu at the beginning since you do indeed have some skills. But, you also need to be clear of who you are and your status.” Duan Qi’s tone was extremely stern.

Yan Xi’s face grew paler, and she could only lower her head as she remained silent.

“Lord Jun Gu is one of the Knights of Destruction, and his status is far superior to others. You should be very clear about your role beside him. I don’t care what you think and what kind of intentions you have. You must be clear that the marriage between the Sacred Maiden and Lord Jun Gu was promised by His Lord. It isn’t for us to disobey that order. Whatever unhappiness you have, you better swallow it.” Duan Qi said coldly.

Yan Xi clenched her fists tightly as an unwilling flame ignited in her eyes. She raised her head suddenly,looked at Duan Qi and said, “Why? Why is it her? Elder Duan! I have been accompanying Lord Jun Gu for so many years! If His Lord had to choose someone from the Sacred Maiden Tribe, then it should be me! Who is Han Zi Fei? She betrayed the Sacred Maiden Tribe and betrayed the Lord. What right does she have to marry Lord Jun Gu??”

The anger that Yan Xi suppressed in her heart broke out at this moment.

She didn’t want to deny or ignore her admiration for Jun Gu. Such an excellent man was someone that no woman in the world could resist. She had always thought that the person who would be standing next to Jun Gu would be her, and only her.

But when she found out that His Lord had betrothed Han Zi Fei to Jun Gu, the shock which she felt was not something that anyone could understand.

Based on what?

She had given so much and waited for so long. Why then, when Han Zi Fei came back, Jun Gu was ‘bestowed’ to her? What was that based on?

“Your question, only Han Zi Fei can answer you. I might as well tell you that this betrothal was not initiated by His Lord but was requested by Han Zi Fei. So, if you want to hate, then hate the fact that you are not comparable to the Sacred Maiden. In the future, even when you stay by Lord Jun Gu’s side, you will only see him and Han Zi Fei being together.” Duan Qi sneered.

Yan Xi took a deep breath and while she obviously didn’t want to admit it, she was very clear that what Duan Qi said was true, but she didn’t understand why Han Zi Fei did it!

“For my Sacred Maiden Tribe, I have already done and instructed what I need to. I hope you are aware of your own position.” Duan Qi looked at Yan Xi coldly, then turned away.

Yan Xi stood alone for a long time.

However, there were two figures who saw clearly what had transpired in the square. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After Han Shu saw Duan Qi left, she turned around and said to Jun Wu Xie, “It seems that we are one step behind, I am afraid that Lord Jun Gu has gone to rest first. ”

She originally wanted to take Jun Wu Xie to see Jun Gu, she didn’t think too much about Han Zi Fei, but she did not expect that when they arrived, they witnessed the conversation between Duan Qi and Yan Xi. However, it was a pity that Han Shu’s spiritual power was not strong enough, and she was also afraid of being found out, hence she did not dare to venture too close. The words exchanged between the two of them, she didn’t manage to hear a thing.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly as she looked at Yan Xi, who was standing alone on the square, there was a flash of coldness in her eyes.

It was really her!

That day in the Soul World, she was the one who had forcibly taken Jun Gu away, and she was the person standing on the square!
