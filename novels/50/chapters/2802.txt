Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Han Shu’s face froze slightly and she looked away, unable to speak further.

Duan Qi glanced at her without saying anything more and headed towards the official residence.

Although Han Shu was told off by Duan Qi, it was not difficult to see that she was second in command to Duan Qi, no other ladies would dare to say she was not.

Outside the City Lord’s manor, Han Shu went to announce their arrival. Ye Sha, who had been waiting for a long time, acted as if he had just heard their announcement, and slowly opened the door to welcome the ladies in.

After entering the City Lord’s manor, Duan Qi didn’t have any outward reaction as she stood coldly in the front of the group, unlike Han Shu and the rest of the women who glanced at every little thing in the residence with faint scorn in their eyes.

Compared with the magnificence of White Night City Lord’s manor, Sea Spirit City Lord’s manor could only be described as unpresentable.

“Please sit down for a while, our City Lord will come soon.” Ye Sha said.

Duan Qi and others took their seats. Han Shu was quite dissatisfied with Sea Spirit City previously, and now she was even more unhappy.

“Your City Lord wants us to continue to wait? Does he not know that we are here? Is this how you treat guests in Sea Spirit City?” Han Shu frowned.

This time, Duan Qi did not stop Han Shu from questioning.

Ye Sha smiled and said, “The City Lord has been delayed by some things, and I kindly ask you to wait a moment. Men, serve tea.”

Several members of the Night Regime were dressed as servants and presented warm tea.

Han Shu just sniffed it and slammed the tea cup onto the table, causing splatters on the table.

“What kind of lousy tea is this? Can this tea be drunk by humans? ”

Ye Sha just stood aside with a smiling face. However, no one noticed the chill that flashed through his eyes.

“Forget it, this tea can’t be drunk at all. A small city is after all a small city. Nothing good can be presented.” Han Shu frowned.

The members of the Night Regime listened to Han Shu’s unceremonious words, and one by one, they were filled with anger.

Where did these girls pop out from? Since entering the residence, everything was not to their liking. Since they didn’t want to be at Sea Spirit City, then why come here?

The members of the Night Regime were thoroughly vexed by these unreasonable and troublesome women. If it weren’t for the fact that they needed to continue the act, they would not want to serve these people tea.

However, Han Shu and others didn’t notice the disgust in the eyes of the Night Regime at all. Instead, they read another meaning in those eyes.

“Oh, a bunch of idiots.” Han Shu acted as if she was high and mighty as she flipped her hair, completely mistaking the disgust in the eyes of the Night Regime as admiration for herself.

Based on appearance alone, Han Shu was very outstanding, and was no way inferior to Gu Xinyan, coupled with the identity of being a Sacred Maiden, it had accumulated into arrogance for her.

However, they hardly realised that ...

As far as her looks were concerned, even if she were to stand naked in front of the Night Regime, they couldn’t be bothered to even look at her. Compared with Jun Wu Xie’s glorious appearance, Han Shu was simply an ugly monster, and she was entirely not self aware.

“When do we have to wait until?” Another Sacred Maiden asked with much impatience, as they had never been treated so flippantly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Duan Qi also frowned slightly, apparently a little displeased.

At this moment, a thin figure suddenly appeared in the lobby of the City Lord’s manor, and for a moment, it attracted everyone’s attention ...
