Chapter 1091: “The Despicable Got Their Way (1)” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In the Thousand Beast City, two youths clad in dark cloaks infiltrated into the city under the darkness of the night. Their movements were nimble as they avoided detection from the city’s guards, silently slipping into the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall.

Standing before the main doors of the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall, a youth pulled out a crude and simple map from his robes and said to his companion beside him: “This should be the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall right? Little Xie told us previously to look for her here after we come into the city, this couldn’t be wrong, could it?”

The dim moonlight shone upon the other youth beside him and the mole of beauty at the corner of the youth’s eye was especially eye grabbing.

“It won’t.”

The youth holding the map immediately stuffed the map into his robes and whispered in a soft voice: “We had really done well on this job and if Xiong Ba doesn’t treat me to a good jar, I will not tell him where the people of the Thousand Beast City have been imprisoned.”

His companions threw him a glance but did not say anything more.

The two slender figures then disappeared in an instant under the pale moonlight.

Inside the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall, Xiong Ba was seated beside the table, as several wine jars lay haphazardly around his feet. His face was all red from drink, but the wine in his cup had not been able to ease his sorrows in the slightest, the deep frown on his face had not relaxed at all.

Qing Yu sat opposite Xiong Ba, his complexion pale, dark rings showing under his eyes.

The stench of wine filled the interior of the room, the oppressive air within making it hard to breathe.

“Sigh..... What is happening here? That the Thousand Beast City..... the Thousand Beast City..... would actually be reduced to such a sorry state. To think that for so many years, we were seen to be so mighty in the eyes of the people throughout the world, but now..... Ha! Betrayal of trust, abandonment of morals, repaying kindness with ingratitude..... Actions of completely despicable minions.....” Xiong Ba was drunk enough that his awareness was already slightly fuzzy. He lifted the wine jar in his hand and took a long draw with a bitter laugh, the cold wine spilling over his clothes, but failing to awaken him from his depression.

Qing Yu stared at Xiong Ba with a complicated expression on his face.

[How many days has it been.....]

Ever since Jun Xie left, the entire Fiery Blaze Clan from top to bottom had seemingly fallen into great misfortune. From the disciples all the way up to Xiong Ba, they had all seemingly collapsed and fallen into ruin, unable to pick themselves up. The things that had happened in the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall that day, had been like a pair of blood stained hands, shredding apart the pride and fierce loyalty of the Fiery Blaze Clan, throwing them all into the deep abyss of having betrayed and abandoned an ally.

“Qing Yu..... How many years have I been the Clan Chief of the Fiery Blaze Clan?” Xiong Ba asked, his head lowered, and he asked in a fuzzy voice as his forehead rested upon the edge of the wine jar.

“I can’t remember clearly.” Qing Yu replied.

“Ha..... I can’t remember either. All I remember is that our Old Chief, when he was dragged before the Grand Chieftain’s Residence by Qu Xin Rui, just before he was executed, he said..... Rather be broken than bent..... Our Old Chief had such strong backbone, and I am just trash instead. Now that the Thousand Beast City had fallen into such a state and I am still helpless to do anything about it. I can’t help the people, can’t help the Grand Chieftain, can’t save the Young Miss..... I am now so useless that I had not even been able to protect a single Spirit Beast! HAHAHA! WHAT A CLAN CHIEF! WHAT BULLSHIT! I AM JUST A SPINELESS PIECE OF TRASH! HAHAHA!..... AN INGRATE WHO”S JUST A SELF SERVING USELESS TRASH! COMPARED TO LIN QUE, HOW DIFFERENT AM I TO HIM! ?” Xiong ba suddenly sat up straight backed, his laughter so filled with despair and hopelessness.

“We were the ones who invited Jun Xie to come. We were the ones who asked him to lend a hand against the predicament the Thousand Beast City was facing. And now? In order to save our own people, we had actually taken his Spirit Beast and sent it into the hands of that old hag! Qing Yu! In my chest..... I feel so infuriated..... it’s choking me..... choking me so bad.....” Xiong Ba lifted his head to look up, to stare up at the roof bathed in the candlelight, and two trails of hot tears, flowed down from the corners of his eyes.

Qing Yu clenched his jaw tight, not daring to say a word, but just downed the wine in his cup silently, seeking to use the alcohol to dispel the guilt and shame that wrenched at his heart.
