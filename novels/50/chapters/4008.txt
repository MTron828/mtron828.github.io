Chapter 2604: Unforgivable Betrayal (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Why?” When Meng Qiu looked at Qin Song, the trace of despair in his eyes had silently disappeared. Even though he looked miserable, but the expression on his face had been as calm and arrogant as ever.

“What does my purpose of doing this have anything to do with you guys? You won’t know what I want, you guys will never know.”

Looking at Meng Qiu, Qin Song never thought that his Master would actually turn into such a person, and up until this moment, there was still no regrets found from his attitude.

“What exactly do we need to know about? Your betrayal? Your lies? I wish that I will never know about it.” Qin Song was completely disappointed with Meng Qiu. The trust and admiration that he had for Meng Qiu after so many years had caused him to hold onto an unrealistic fantasy all the time.

He thought that Meng Qiu might either be threatened by the Upper Realm or he might just be momentarily bedeviled by his mistaken thoughts, resulting him in doing such things, but it was at this moment after witnessing Meng Qiu’s reaction, Qin Song realized that everything that was done by Meng Qiu were all out of his own will. He was never forced.

“Ha! Why would I need your understanding? I was defeated, and that’s my fault for being useless. Life or death, it’s all up to you, do whatever you want.” Meng Qiu sneered.

Qin Song shook his head as he took a few steps backwards. He could feel that Meng Qiu’s soul was vanishing bits by bits. Even if they did nothing, the rebound of the Contemporaneous Knot would also take Meng Qiu’s life.

Why should he dirty his pair of hands then?

Long Jiu had already recovered from the sentiment. He heard Meng Qiu’s words very clearly, but compared to the Master and student relationship between Meng Qiu and Qin Song, Long Jiu’s relationship with Meng Qiu was slightly weaker, because he knew it from the very beginning that it wasn’t Meng Qiu’s genuine thought to look him as his student.

“Old Five, we don’t have to feel sorry for such a guy,” said Long Jiu.

Qin Song let in a deep breath, not speaking anything more.

No one would want to handle Meng Qiu. All they needed to do was just to silently wait for the time to wipe him off from this world.

Meng Qiu himself too, knew that there wasn’t much time left for him as the strong soul power of his was crazily flowing away from his body. At this moment, his dream had gone far away from him, to the end of the world, and he could no longer touch it. Head up, he looked at the stiffened vine that was halting in the mid air with a complex gaze in his eyes.

He was still able to recall the moment when he was first born into the Soul World. As the very first batch of soul entities created by the Spirit Tree, he was so lost, not knowing what to do, and there were just the other soul entities around him, who too, felt the same bewilderment as him. During that period of time, he had no idea about who himself was, and where was he. Even more, he knew nothing about life and death.

And it was this firm and gentle vine that had embraced and softly rocked him who was straying and wandering around.

That was the first time Meng Qiu heard the voice of the Spirit Tree, and this was what it said.

[My kid, don’t be afraid. This is your home, and you are going to live here without having any worries.] Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The voice had awakened Meng Qiu’s soul. The very first voice of his life, that it had been deeply stamped in Meng Qiu’s memory, not being able to be gotten rid off.

Since they were the first batch of spirit envoys, they had no seniors to teach them, and hence, they were lucky enough to be personally guided by the Spirit Tree itself.

That was an honor that the other spirit envoys had never experienced before.

Under the attentive nurture of the Spirit Tree, nearly hundred soul entities got to learn about the Soul World. Despite having their own names, they had also understood that they were soul entities. They knew about the Metempsychosis Path, the Soul Devouring River...

During that time, Meng Qiu felt that he was the happiest person living in the world because he had the tenderest Spirit Tree staying by his side. He loved the Soul World and the Spirit Tree that had given him his life very much. When there were lots of his comrades who had chosen to enter the Reincarnation Path, Meng Qiu had made his choice in continue staying in the Soul World.
