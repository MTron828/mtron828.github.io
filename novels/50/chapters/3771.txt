“What happened? Are you feeling sick?” The Spirit Lord didn’t care much about himself not getting rest for a few days. He immediately came forward to welcome Jun Wu Xie once he saw her coming.

Looking at the Spirit Lord, Jun Wu Xie said. “There’s something I want to talk to you.”

With a trace of doubt in the Spirit Lord’s eyes, he thought that the thing Jun Wu Xie wanted to discuss was about the method he used in suppressing her energy. After inviting Jun Wu Xie to have a seat, he then prepared himself to be all ears.

“You said it before, that all the spirits that entered the Spirit World were selected after their deaths, right?” Suddenly, Jun Wu Xie asked.

It was a sudden question, causing the Spirit Lord to show great astonishment in his eyes. Why would Jun Wu Xie, all of a sudden, mention about it?

“Yeah, that’s right.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“After you came to the Lower Realm, you promised the Lower Realm to give them the medicinal pills that are able to extract spirits from the bodies. You had also opened a door for them for convenience. The thing I want to know, is that except for you, is there still anyone who is able to do the same thing?” Jun Wu Xie asked again.

The Spirit Lord responded: “Except for me, only two of them are able to enter or leave the Spirit World freely. One is Dark Emperor and the other one is the Spirit Tree.”

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and said, “Do you still remember Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord?”

The eyes of the Spirit Lord widened a bit, finally realizing what actually did Jun Wu Xie want to ask about.

“You’re suspecting that both of them were able to enter the Spirit World because there’s someone who’s secretly helping them?” The Spirit Lord’s expression changed. During the time when Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord appeared, the whole Spirit World was nearly devastated. If it wasn’t for Jun Wu Xie who had intervened in the incident, perhaps the Spirit World would have turned into a puppet of the fake Spirit Lord.

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

The Spirit Lord frowned. “I had investigated the case before. There weren’t any record of them entering the Spirit World. Though the record for Wu Jiu was still there, I found out that the actual way of him entering the Spirit World had been wiped out with deceits after further investigation. Actually, I have always been thinking about a question regarding both of their appearances in the Spirit World. It’s true that the Spirit World isn’t comparable with the Soul World, but it still can’t be easily entered by any ordinary person. Even for the Upper Realm experts who owned spirit rings, they definitely don’t have the ability to extract their spirits from their bodies and enter the Spirit World by force.”

“Except for the spirits, the Dark Emperor is the only exception who is able to enter the Spirit World freely. Except for him, it’s almost impossible for the others to do that. If not, the Spirit World would have been long destroyed by someone who has the thought of doing that. Is there anything in your mind?” He asked her.

Still, he had enough confidence in the Spirit World which he built by himself.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t rushed herself to reply to the Spirit Lord’s question. It was as if there was something running in her mind. She thought for a while and then said. “The medicinal pill that extract spirits which you gave to Qiao Chu them, are you the one who did the research and made it?”

Instantly, the Spirit Lord shook his head. “How would I know about these? It’s just that when I was in the Soul World...”

Instead of finishing his words, the Spirit Lord suddenly stopped talking. An uneasy thought sprang into his mind during the conversation, causing the words he hadn’t let out to be stuck like some stones pressing on his throat. His eyes widened. With an unbelievable gaze, he stared at Jun Wu Xie who was seated opposite, stroking the little black cat calmly.

“You...” The Spirit Lord spoke in a shaking voice. “Are you saying that... Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord... had used the same method... to enter the Spirit World?!”
