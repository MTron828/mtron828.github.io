Chapter 2418: Battle of the Spirit Rings (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The battle between Jun Wu Xie and Luo Qingcheng was on the verge of occurring; both of them walked towards the center of the battlefield. No one else from either side took any further steps as their commanders were the ones heading to battle.

The people from the Upper Realm were entirely unworried about this battle. Even faced with death, Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya simply couldn’t believe that Luo Qingcheng would be defeated by Jun Wu Xie – from the look of the situation, this was tantamount to Jun Wu Xie’s death.

On the contrary, Qiao Chu and others were worried about Jun Wu Xie’s decision.

Although they have not crossed paths with Luo Qingcheng, but at that time, the appearance of Luo Qingcheng caused Jun Wu Yao’s hands to be tied and that resulted in the tragedy, Ren Huang was forced to self destruct. They did not know what was Luo Qingcheng’s strength, but they were very clear how strong Jun Wu Xie was. But to be able to have forced Jun Wu Xie’s hand, it must mean that Luo Qingcheng was not weak at all. Looking at the fifty thousand strong army from the Upper Realm, everyone was obediently following Luo Qingcheng’s leadership – if she did not possess great skills, she would not have been able to stand in this position.

Therefore, because of Jun Wu Xie’s decision to fight Luo Qingcheng, they could not object but they could not help but feel nervous for her.

They could only trust in her.

A strong gust of wind hurtled past as two slim silhouettes appeared in that wide open space between the two sides – both beautiful, both cold and unfeeling, yet, each of them gave everyone a distinctly different feeling.

If Luo Qingcheng’s coldness was like the tip of the iceberg, the peak of a snow capped mountain, then the coldness of Jun Wu Xie is like that of a bottomless wintry lake, a calm and composed but obvious alienation. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Xie leapt off her horse and patted it affectionately before letting it gallop away. She then lifted her head slightly to look at Luo Qingcheng who was still seated high on her horse.

Luo Qingcheng was also looking at Jun Wu Xie. To the both of them, this was a battle of vengeance – one was fighting for her Grand Master and loved ones, and the other was just fighting for the sake of appearance and desire.

Equally, that strong sense of hatred was burning within the two individuals even though the battle has not started, and it was making the surrounding atmosphere exceedingly tense.

“Loser.” Luo Qingcheng sneered, as she somersaulted off her horse. The Spirit Ring which appeared within Luo Qingcheng’s hand was blindingly glaring – like the aura of stars falling from the sky at night, it was dazzling.

Luo Qingcheng had not attacked, but the appearance of her Spirit Ring had already caused the surrounding air to be filled with a strong spiritual pressure.

Within the Upper Realm, the strongest single Spirit Ring wielder had appeared!

When Wei Ya and Xie Changming saw the appearance of Luo Qingcheng’s Spirit Ring, they could not help but had a strange gleam in their eyes. From their point of view, the difference between Luo Qingcheng and Jun Wu Xie was that of a cloud and mud. Luo Qingcheng would not need to use her Spirit Ring at all, and she could easily take away Jun Wu Xie’s life.

What Luo Qingcheng wanted was not just to simply defeat Jun Wu Xie. What she truly wanted was to deal a devastating blow to Jun Wu Xie, to completely destroy her, and show her the vast difference between Jun Wu Xie and her.

The eye-catching Spirit Ring contained a powerful force, which made Qiao Chu and others who were watching, even more worried about Jun Wu Xie.

However, Jun Wu Xie just stood still calmly with her right hand slightly raised.

A Spirit Ring with a deep green aura slowly rose from her hand, and gradually expanded. Compared with Luo Qingcheng’s Spirit Ring, the Spirit Ring in Jun Wu Xie’s hand seemed relatively weak, just like the flowers blooming under the moonlight, yet hiding something within the seemingly gentle halo.
