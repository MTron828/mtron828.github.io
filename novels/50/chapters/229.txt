Chapter 230:”Torture (2)”

She had been to the Royal Tomb and the Jun Family’s graveyard. She had turned the places upside down and still did not manage to locate any sign of the Soul Jade.

Qin Yu Yan had decided that Mo Qian Yuan had lied to her.

The price for having deceived the Qing Yun Clan, was not something everyone could bear up under.

She would not kill Mo Qian Yuan, but keep him within an inch of his life. After she manages to force Mo Qian Yuan to divulge the location of the Soul Jade, she would personally bring him back to the Qing Yun Clan, dismember his limbs and leave him soaked in her medicinal urns, which were filled with devastating poison, and make him suffer unspeakable torment, while keeping him alive.

This was the price for deceiving the Qing Yun Clan. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Yun Xian.” Qin Yu Yan called out suddenly. Bai Yun Xian, who had been standing quietly at the side snapped to her senses, and paled visibly, as she fell to her knees in a panic before Qin Yu Yan who sat high up upon the Emperor’s throne.

“Senior! I have wronged you! I will never create such mischief again!” Beads of sweat rolled down the side of her face. People were usually charmed by the gentle facade that Qin Yu Yan portrays, but as a disciple of the Qing Yun Clan who knew the inner workings within well, she knew the terror that hid behind the mask that Qin Yu Yan presented to the outside world.

The Eldest Miss of the Qing Yun Clan who always appeared gentle and affable, was actually a demoness in disguise.

Qin Yu Yan’s area of expertise was not medicine, but the development of poisons!

In Qin Yu Yan’s backyard, tens of enormous medicinal urns were kept. In every urn, it was filled with various brews made from myriad poisons. She would then dismember the limbs, gouge out the eyes and cut off the tongues of people who displeased her and dump them into the urns to conduct her research into her study of poison. These people used for her research were all kept alive and refused death to suffer under their painful existence.

Even the disciples of the Qing Yun Clan were terrified of Qin Yu Yan.

The woman had never been benevolent in her ways, even when their own Qing Yun Clan disciples caused her to be annoyed, they were not let off easy either.

Qin Yu Yan looked smilingly at Bai Yun Xian who was sweating profusely and waved her hand slightly. A Qing Yun Clan disciple appeared from the back of the hall pushing a wheelchair. And seated upon the wheelchair, was the hideous and gruesome Mo Xuan Fei.

“Since you admit to your mistake, you would know what to do. You are my junior, and my father harboured high hopes for you. Being hopelessly tangled with a duke, would not be something my father would like to hear about.” Having said that, Qin Yu Yan threw a dagger at the feet of Bai Yun Xian. “Kill him, and go back with me to receive your punishment.”

Bai Yun Xian was stunned as she stared at the dagger at her feet. She hesitated a moment before she bent to gingerly pick it up. She trembled as she straightened herself and walked unsteadily towards the obviously delirious Mo Xuan Fei.

He had been a suave and charming guy, and he had been reduced to such a sorry state. He lost his good looks, and his elegant charm was missing. He was now just a nauseating pile of rot that smelled just as bad as he looked.

“Can’t bear to?” Qin Yu Yan asked, observing Bai Yun Xian.

“It’s not that.” Bai Yun Xian calmed herself. If it was Mo Xuan Fei in the past, she might have considered herself to have some feelings for him. But after he was reduced to such a state, Bai Yun Xian had given up on any thoughts of that.

‘Kill him and my senior will spare me.’

Without much of a hesitation, Bai Yun Xian drove the dagger in her hands deep into the chest of Mo Xuan Fei. Mo Xuan Fei who had been muddled and delirious for a time seemed to wake up and regain his consciousness at that moment. The distant look in his eyes lifted and he stared befuddled at the hands holding the dagger hilt that stuck out from his chest and turned to look at Bai Yun Xian with his eyes in disbelief and grudging resentment.

“I had no other choice. Having you dead is better than getting myself killed.” Bai Yun Xian whispered through her teeth as she watched the light fade from Mo Xuan Fei’s eyes. And when he breathed his last, Bai Yun Xian turned and knelt before Qin Yu Yan.

“My senior, he is dead.”
