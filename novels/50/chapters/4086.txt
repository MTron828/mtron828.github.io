Zheng Weilong listened to the servant girl’s complaint but only smiled slightly, glancing over the blooming flowers in the courtyard but there was not a sliver of appreciation in her eyes.

“What kind of person Ruan Zhongshan is, I know very well. If my father wants me to come, I will come. As the young lady of Discerning Moon City, I only have to take orders from my father.” Zheng Weilong said calmly, but there was a flash of disgust in her eyes.

“Miss, what are you talking about? No matter what, you are also the young lady of Discerning Moon City. Coming to Long Xuan City was supposed to be Third Miss but ...” The servant girl suddenly thought of something and trailed off disgruntedly.

Zheng Weilong raised her hand to stop the servant girl from continuing.

“There is no need to say this again, since I am here, there is nothing else to say. Since my father asked me to stay here for a while, I will stay.”

The servant girl bit her lips and suppressed her unwillingness.

The blood relationship in the Upper Three Realms were weak and there was no deep father-daughter bond between Zheng Weilong and the City Lord of the Discerning Moon City. She had been raised by a nursing mother in another manor since she was a child. She rarely met her biological mother, let alone her father. It wasn’t until she was sixteen that her father took him back to live in the city’s main residence.

Discerning Moon City was not a small force which was why it held a place in the 72 cities. One reason was that there were many masters in Discerning Moon City, and the other was because the current City Lord was powerful. Zheng Weilong’s father, Zheng Ke, ranked fifth among all the current City Lords of the 72 cities. Moreover, Zheng Ke could condense out a large number of spirit inscriptions which was close to the strength to condense out a Spirit Ring. Such strength made Zheng Ke have absolute confidence, so he did not have to worry that his children would transcend himself.

Therefore, the number of Young Masters in the city was also quite large. Zheng Weilong had four sisters and eight brothers.

Zheng Weilong was Zheng Zheng’s first child, but also the one who was the least favored.

This was simply because Zheng Weilong’s appearance was not the best among Zheng Ke’s daughters. Even though Zheng Weilong’s countenance could be said to be the plainest amongst all of Zheng Ke’s daughters, the main reason that Zheng Weilong was unfavoured was because ... Zheng Weilong did not have any spiritual power.

A person without spiritual power could be said to be non-existent. All those who have survived have been tempered by the blood of the Sea Spirit Beasts. No matter how poor their cultivation were, they would at least awaken the essence of a Gold Spirit after being stimulated by the blood of the Sea Spirit Beast.

But there is always an accident in everything and Zheng Weilong was this variable.

Immediately after Zheng Weilong was born, she was taken to the nursery to undergo the tempering of spiritual awakening, but the blood of the Sea Spirit Beast did not play any role in her, neither awakening her spiritual power nor devouring her life. Although she had survived, but she became the only waste in the Upper Realm who had no spiritual power. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even the humblest beggar in the Upper Realm was stronger than her ...

Because of this, in Discerning Moon City, Zheng Weilong was the young lady who was most ignored. Even her brothers and sisters disdained her. This trip to Long Xuan City should have been her Third Sister but in the end, just because her Third Sister cried in front of Zheng Ke, it made Zheng Ke change his mind and sent her instead.
