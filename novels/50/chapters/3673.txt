In the period of five years, although everyone was convinced that Jun Wu Xie was still alive, but in each of their hearts, down in the deepest recesses, there was still a thread of uncertainty. As long as they did not receive any news pertaining to her, this thread of uncertainty could not be relaxed. They had been afraid and worried and the news received today was the best news it had received over the past five years.

Jun Xian nodded his head slightly, although he tried to cover it up, but it was not difficult to see that he was nervous and excited at this moment.

“Go! Immediately disseminate the news to Jun Qing and the others... The Middle Realm, they have to go to the Middle Realm, Jun Wu Xie is still alive, it has been so many years... How did that child endure it... Quick! Bring Qiao Chu and his companions back to meet with her! No matter what, they must find her!” Jun Xian raised his hand excitedly as his fingertips trembled slightly.

His family’s Wu Xie, his darling little granddaughter. The devastation that happened five years ago, even those who did not participate in it had their hairs stand on ends when they heard what had happened. What more of Jun Wu Xie who had personally experienced it herself? Jun Xian knew that although his granddaughter looked cold on the surface, her deep concern for others was not something that other people could understand.

Personally witnessing her own grandmaster sacrifice himself in order to save her, helplessly watching Jun Wu Yao who had always been by her side, captured. That level of despair ...Jun Xian did not even dare to think how Jun Wu Xie had passed these five years by.

“I will immediately head out to inform Qiao Chu and the others.” Qu Ling Yue stood up and nodded her head slightly to Jun Xian. Although she left in a calm manner, but the hands that were hidden in her sleeves were already trembling uncontrollably.

On the lands of the former Qi Kingdom, between the mountains was an illusory place that had appeared silently five years ago. Qu Ling Yue brought people here and looked at the bamboo house that was just outside the grey light and she slowly walked over.

Five years ago, with the uprise of the Nine Temples, they had suppressed the entire Middle Realm and the Spirit World received inexplicable undulations. In order to protect the spirits, the Spirit Master did not hesitate to consume a large part of his power to transfer the entire Spirit World to the Lower Realm. The Nine Temples had been bitterly searching through the Middle Realm but could never find it. They had long moved to the Lower Realm.

In the bamboo house, several soldiers of the Rui Lin Army saw Qu Ling Yue arrive. Just as they were about to kneel down in ceremony, she raised her head slightly to stop them. Her eyes immediately fell on the beds within the house.

In this area, there were many bamboo houses and the number was comparable to the number of houses in a small city. In each bamboo house, other than the beds, there was nothing else. The bamboo house which Qu Ling Yue had stepped into had twenty beds in it.

On each bed, there was a person sleeping soundly on it. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qu Ling Yue’s gaze swept through the beds in front of her.

Qiao Chu, Hua Yan, Fan Zhuo, Fei Yan, Rong Ruo, Jun Qing, Long Qi, Mu Qian Fan, Little Jue, Wen Xin Han, Lei Chen, Bai Yun Xian, Yin Yan...

The faces of the people on the bed were so familiar. After the turmoil in the Middle Realm and ever since Jun Wu Xie’s disappearance, Qiao Chu and the others delved into a state of madness. If not for Jun Xian’s death order that did not allow them to step one step into the Middle Realm, Qiao Chu and the rest would have already lost their lives as they battled it out with the Nine Temples. With the advent of the Spirit World,Qiao Chu and the others who had once experienced the staggering speed of cultivation in the Spirit World had immediately used their links to the Spirit World via the Yin Yang Bear and the others to connect to the Spirit World. Upon entering an agreement with the Spirit Master, they entered the Spirit World to cultivate!
