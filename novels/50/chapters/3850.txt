Chapter 2446: I Want To Get Married (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head, causing Jun Wu Yao to finally let the rock which was hanging high up in his heart down with a trace of happiness, without him realizing, show up on his face.

Ye Sha and the others who were standing aside couldn’t help but let out their breaths with a sense of relief. Watching the reaction of their Lord, they were not sure if they should be laughing or crying.

Who would have thought that the masterful Dark Emperor who had always been riding the whirlwind would ever experience such a bewildered and perplexed moment?

No any other one besides Jun Wu Xie would have the ability to force Jun Wu Yao into a situation like this.

“Fine, since this is your decision, I have nothing more to say,” Jun Xian sighed. When a girl is of age, she must be married off, he thought. His granddaughter had been hustling for the past few years, resulting in her only going back home once in a blue moon. And now, since they had gotten the dust settled, he thought that he could finally take good care of her in the following years but he never expected that this girl would actually decide the most important affair of her final settlement in life so quickly.

While thinking about it, Jun Xian couldn’t help himself from raising his head and staring at Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Xian was also a man who had engaged in marriage and established a family. He too, had a woman who he loved with all his heart. It was impossible for him to not realize that Jun Wu Yao loved Jun Wu Xie very much just by looking at his reaction.

It was always good if both were attracted to each other.

“Wu Yao, if someday in the future, you bully Little Xie, I won’t be having mercy on you.” Pretending to be dignified, Jun Xian spoke.

However, Jun Wu Yao smiled and said. “How would I bear to do so?”

How would he bear to bully her even a bit?

How would he bear to let her suffer from any wronged?

How he wished he was able to give her the entire world. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jun Xian nodded his head with satisfaction while Jun Qing who was at the side was also smiling in gratification. Both Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao had been sharing all the weal and woe with each other throughout the trials and tribulations. It could be said that both of them had gone through a lot of hardships together. Of course they would not have any objection against their marriage.

“Alright, when are you planning to get married? Your uncle and I will organize and prepare the ceremony.” Though a sigh was let out from the mouth of Jun Xian, the smile shown in the corners of his eyes and the tips of his eyebrows had already disclosed the joy inside him. He was relieved that his granddaughter had found herself a nice settlement.

To be honest, there was no way for a normal man to get along with Jun Wu Xie with the personality she had. She was as cold as ice but there was actually a great passion raging inside her. It was just that not many people were able to bear the pain brought by the ice.

“It’s all up to you,” said Jun Wu Xie. After finishing her words, she pushed Jun Wu Yao aside and spoke while looking at Jun Xian. “I’ll just let grandfather decide everything. Do allow me to excuse myself first.”

After she ended her speech, Jun Wu Xie left the place straight off without even speaking a word to Jun Wu Yao.

Watching the scene, Qiao Chu and the others who had their souls left their bodies after being thunderstruck by Jun Wu Xie nearly injured themselves.

After bombarding them with such an earth-shattering news, Little Xie just simply left like that?

The only purpose she came out of her room was just to announce her marriage with Jun Wu Yao? What else then? She wasn’t going to care about the other things anymore?

Qiao Chu and the rest were truly muddled by the peculiar style of the way Jun Wu Xie behaved. They then looked at Jun Wu Yao who was being left alone in pity, thinking that Jun Wu Yao might be disappointed but it was actually the other way round.

The man grinned so broadly that all he had left to do was to laugh out loud. Was there even any sign of letdown shown?!

At this moment, Qiao Chu and the others had eventually realized that both the two geniuses with impeccable strengths, whether if it was Jun Wu Xie or Jun Wu Yao, had zero knowledge about all the matters related to marriage! It seemed like they thought that everything was done once an agreement was made between them, and they had no awareness of the conditions and the procedures of a marriage at all.

It was as if Qiao Chu was watching two little kids playing house all of a sudden. These indescribably powerful guys who had zero common sense were actually a couple. This was just... fantastic!
