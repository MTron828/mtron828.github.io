Although Nangong Lie was the last one among the top ten exponents, the power of the top ten exponents was not something that ordinary people could challenge at all. Others who have met them would show them due respect as they were afraid to even offend the top ten exponent at the slightest. However, not only did the strange boy not respect him, he also severely wounded Nangong Lie’s guard with his bare hands. He even provoked Nangong Lie’s dignity in public, which was really incredible.

Through the crowd, Jun Wu Xie observed Nangong Lie who was frozen stiff and then observed the child opposite of Nangong Lie, as she suddenly frowned.

With her capability, she could clearly see the lingering spiritual power around the child, and the degree of robustness was far above Nangong Lie’s!

“So, it’s him .” Jun Wu Yao whispered suddenly.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at him suspiciously, and asked softly, “Do you know that child?”

“Child? He isn’t.” Jun Wu Yao chuckled and isolated his and Jun Wu Xie’s voices with his Dark Spirit. “This person’s age is more or less a few thousand years old, but he cultivates his spiritual strength in a special way, and that allows him to maintain a child-like appearance.”

Jun Wu Yao then said: “This person is Bai Mo, speaking of which, he shares some anscentry with White Night City’s Bai Zhu. He was the lord of White Night City in the early days, but because he was not willing to continue being the City Lord, he has lived in seclusion since, practising his spiritual power. He is ruthless, bloodthirsty with an eccentric personality. There was one year when White Night City was in chaos, a City Lord had wanted to request that he come out of his seclusion to maintain the stability of White Night City. But instead, the City Lord and the hundreds of people he took with him were killed by Bai Mo and blood stained the soil of his abode.”

Jun Wu Xie was stunned momentarily as she did not expect that the seemingly immature child turned out to be such a cruel master.

As everyone knew White Night City’s leadership was based on inheritance by blood for a long time. Every City Lord was the child of the previous City Lord. The City Lord of White Night City who went to Bai Mo to ask for help was also related to Bai Mo. Unexpectedly, Bai Mo had actually killed the City Lord without blinking an eye. This was really...

“He should have been one of the top ten exponents a long time ago. But from what I see, he still hasn’t made it. It seems that the injury that time was not light.” Jun Wu Yao rubbed his chin.

“Injury?”

“Not long after I came to the Upper Realm that year, this person heard about me from somewhere and decided to come find me. I was not interested in wasting my time on him, so I gave him a slap. By the time I left the Upper Realm, he seemed like he hadn’t been able to get up from his bed.” The corner of Jun Wu Yao’s mouth kicked up as a wicked smile crossed his face.

Jun Wu Xie remained silent ...

Jun Wu Yao’s time spent in the Upper Realm was not short.

The light slap managed to put an exponent in bed for hundreds of years ... this strength ...

Originally Jun Wu Xie was a bit cautious about Bai Mo, but after listening to Jun Wu Yao’s story, she could no longer associate the fearsome attitude of Bai Mo as a monstrous fiend. She could only imagine a poor little child, laying in bed crying and whining while spitting out blood.

In a sense, Jun Wu Xie was full of sympathy for this little brat who has been “taught” by Jun Wu Yao, he could also be considered lucky to have survived in the hands of Jun Wu Yao ...
