“Even if you want to tear a hole in the sky, you have to tell us that you are well and that us know your situation. Even if the sky collapses, Lin Palace is your home.You are forever our Lin Palace’s child...” Jun Xian’s hands hung heavily from the side of the table, he looked as if he was venting all the worry that had piled up over the years.

Jun Wu Xie held her breath, not daring to speak, she was afraid that the moment she opened her mouth, she would not be able to control herself from all that she had kept bottled up within all these years.

She could be strong, she could be fearless, she could never fall ... Even if they parted forever, she could go on with that last thread of hope...

But...

The only thing that she could not face was the warmth of her loved ones. She was afraid that even if she only had a glance, her strong will would be crushed.

That was Jun Wu Xie’s weakness, and the very thing that she couldn’t escape from and yet it was also something so precious that she could not give up.

“Today, you must promise me. In the future, no matter what you want to do, you must tell me! Your Grandfather may be old and useless but as long as these old bones are here, no one had better dare bully my Granddaughter! Even if I give up this worthless life of mine, you can’t suffer any grievances! Remember this!” For the first time, Jun Xian had talked to Jun Wu Xie in such a tone, but no one dared to intervene. This was a form of the concern that an elder was giving to the younger generation, and as they say, blood runs thicker than water.

“Grandfather... I... Will remember it.” Jun Wu Xie’s voice was trembling slightly as she was trying to hold back something that was about to collapse at any moment.

Jun Xian gasped lightly, trying hard to suppress the currents surged of emotions deep in the depths of his heart as he turned his head away and silently wiped the tears at the corner of his eye.

The highly respected undefeated War God who had once swept through the entire Lower Realm actually could not stay strong in front of his granddaughter. Nothing beats the strong bonds of a family.

Jun Xian stabilized his emotions and slowly reached out for the tea cup in Jun Wu Xie’s hands and drank it.

Jun Qing who stood by the side let out a sigh of relief, as he tried to conceal the emotions that were stirring in his eyes and tried his best to maintain a smile on his face.

Father... He was afraid of Little Xie suffering any grievances.

They had heard all that had happened five years ago clearly from the Spirit Jade Palace Lord. Even though they weren’t there, hearing his description had already made them feel scared. The relationship between Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie weren’t simple and Ren Huang was Jun Wu Xie’s Grandmaster. With the tragic demise of Yan Bu Gui added, they did not dare to even think how she had passed these five years by. Over the past five years, did she even have a peaceful night? Did she always have nightmares and could she even sleep?

“Come, get up.” Jun Xian drank Jun Wu Xie’s tea and said gently. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jun Wu Xie got up quietly and stood in front of Jun Xian.

“Why are you still standing there in a daze for? Quickly, sit down!” Jun Xian patted at the chair beside him and motioned her to come.

That seat had been prepared specially for her. Ever since she had left the Lower Realm, no one had ever sat on it. Jun Xian had said before that that seat was left especially for Jun Wu Xie and no one else was allowed to sit on it.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head and sat down obediently on the chair beside Jun Xian.

Qiao Chu and the others who had followed Jun Wu Xie all revealed a smile after they saw her finally reunite with her family.

Little Xie was finally home.

In the future, no matter how much risk, how strong the enemy was, there was always a place called home and it could protect her from the wind and rain. Even if this home was not invisible, but it was the warmest haven.
