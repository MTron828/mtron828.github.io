Chapter 3009 You Have Returned 4

At that moment Qiao Chu and the rest understood everything.

They finally understood why Rong Ruo refused to accept Fei Yan’s feelings.

It turned out that the one who had grown up with them was a male soul, giving him such an elegant, gentlemanly air. That was why no matter how much Fei Yan expressed his love, he could not reciprocate.

Previously Rong Ruo may not have told him everything as he had always hoped his sister would wake up and he could leave the body in peace. Fei Yan was a good man and he believed his sister would gladly accept his love. But Rong Ruo never expected that his sister would not be able to come back.

After Rong Ruo had finished speaking, Fei Yan seemed to have suffered a great setback and just sat there wordlessly, mouth agape.

Rong Ruo lowered his head, a bit of bitterness flashed in his eyes. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He and Fei Yan had been close since they were young, the last one he wanted to harm would have been him. And yet....it had to be him...

After a long silence, Fei Yan finally spoke.

“Little Ruo, in your eyes, am I like that?”

Rong Ruo was a little stunned.

Fei Yan became very agitated.

“Why do you think I love you? Because of your beauty? Your female charms? I don’t care for those! So what if you’re a man? I don’t care! All I know is that you are Little Ruo, the same Little Ruo that has been through the most painful parts of my life with me, the same Little Ruo that kept me company till dawn, the one who endured Master’s punishment’s with me whenever I got into trouble! You are Little Ruo, then, now and in the future! I only care about you and your soul! It doesn’t matter what form you’re in, as long as your soul is the same, I still want you! Don’t ever think of leaving me again in this lifetime, even if you went to hell, I’d go down there to get you back!”

With every word, Fei Yan’s body was shaking, he was speaking from his soul and they struck a chord within Rong Ruo’s soul.

Rong Ruo looked at Fei Yan in a daze, not daring to believe that his obsession had got so deep.

“Little Ruo ...” Fei Yan’s voice suddenly became very light and you could hear a hint of choking.

“I beg you, don’t leave me again alright?”

“I beg of you....”

The words laced with tears made Rong Ruo’s soul feel trapped in someone’s hand. He could no longer feel pain but his soul still ached.

He did not dare to look at Fei Yan and was afraid to respond for fear that anything he said could hurt Fei Yan further.

Yet the person in front of him was the one he least wanted to hurt.

All the memories from past to present came flooding into Rong Ruo’s mind. They were so clear that they pierced his heart.

Jun Wu Xie and the rest did not know how to solve the issue and silently retreated from the room, leaving Fei Yan and Rong Ruo to have their moment alone. No matter what they chose to do, as sworn companions, they would do their utmost to protect them.

Jun Wu Yao silently followed behind Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie stopped and turned around suddenly, accidentally falling into Jun Wu Yao’s arms.

Her heart ached so badly that she did not know what to do.
