The night in the dense forest started to fade as the warm sunlight peeked through between the gaps of the leaves and the entire forest was illuminated, it was as if there were scattered stars all over.

Jun Wu Xie stirred from her sleep as she awoke to the fresh new day. Over the past few days, because of the large number of wounded people, all the medicine in her Cosmos Sack had been emptied out, only some herbs remained. Fortunately, Jun Wu Yao had given her a small pill furnace at the very beginning so that she could refine and a medicine at her own convenience. It was perfect for a time like this and after she dressed up, she came out of her tent and enjoyed the embrace of the warm sunlight. The warm sunlight had signified that a new day had come and that a fresh start had begun. After she made her preparations, she started to refine new medicines and the rate at which she refined them was like flowing water, however despite this speed, it was still unable to meet the demand. It could only temporarily ensure that the disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace could make this journey, but it was not enough for them to recover their spirit power.

After making the necessary preparations, Jun Wu Xie refined a batch of medicine pills. They immediately set off as they had already rested for a few days and this place was no longer safe to stay.

The disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace had not fully recovered but for the sake of safety, they could only endure the pain as they moved on forward.

Fortunately, although they were injured, they did not drag on anyone’s hind legs as they packed everything up quickly as they embarked on the new journey.

Yan Bu Gui carried Su Ya on his back with his face full of smiles, it was as if he was carrying his whole world on him.

“Little Wu Xie ah, can you still remember everything I’ve said to you before? You are only one step away from the Gold Spirit, I believe that with your talent, it would not be long for you to go beyond the level of the Gold Spirit. When you reach that step, if you would like to advance further, you would need to start to condense spirit inscriptions.” Ren Huang said as he walked beside her, he would be following the Spirit Jade Palace and travel to the Lower Realm together, he could only use the little time they had over the the past few days to try to squeeze all the cultivation methods of the Upper Realm into Jun Wu Xie’s brain. So along the road, without any rest, he kept on speaking.

Luckily, Jun Wu Xie had a high level of comprehension and memory. Ren Huang only needed to say it once and she had it down in her memory, so she listened intently to all his words. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Grandmaster, what you’ve used before at the Cloudy Brook Academy was the Spirit Ring?” Jun Wu Xie remembered the scene of Ren Huang killing the surrounding enemies at the Cloudy Brook Academy, one against a thousand, yet he did not fall into a disadvantageous position. If Ba He had not used Su Ya to threaten him, the massacre would have continued on.

Ren Huang nodded his head and said, “That’s right, that was the Spirit Ring.” He then condensed the Spirit Ring which was surrounded by a blue light on his palm.

At that time, the situation was dire and Jun Wu Xie wasn’t able to come close. Looking at it now from closer distance, she could see that the Spirit Ring was composed of strings of inscriptions, it was just that those inscriptions were a little strange, some of them looked like soul inscriptions yet was not exactly the same.

“Look here, each string of the inscription is independent. They are tapered to the spirit energy in your body, each one different. The larger the Spirit Ring, the stronger the strength. At the initial stage of condensing the spirit inscription, is the very beginning as more and more inscriptions are an extension from it.” Ren Huang patiently taught her that the Spirit Ring was equivalent to those spirit power in the human body and once the spirit inscription was condensed and took form, the spirit power would not disappear but because of the consumption of the spirit energy, it would temporarily fall into a deep sleep. Just like he had forcibly crushed the Spirit Ring, but he had only destroyed the temporary use of the Spirit Ring and the actual Spirit Ring itself was still in his body.

“Cultivating the spirit inscription is to condense spirit energy, they would exist in your veins in the state of nothingness and sink into your dantian.” Ren Huang explained further, “Why don’t you give it a try, see if you’re able to condense a spirit inscription according to what I’ve taught you before.”
