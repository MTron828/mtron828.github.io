Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The voice, indeed was much worse.

Gu Xin Yan was a little disappointed but also seemed to mock herself for her foolish thoughts.

How could that person be here...

After killing Luo Qingcheng, she came to the Upper Realm, but it was also a narrow escape from death, it was better to never set foot here again.

Gu Xin Yan raised her hand, and the guard, who was behind her, was about to present the gift.

“Please sit down.” Jun Wu Xie accepted the gift as she spoke to Gu Xin Yan.

Gu Xin Yan nodded as she moved to her seat with her guard. She was unconcerned about everything here, to her, this feast was just a farce.

However, the 72 City Lords were curious about Gu Xin Yan. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Gu Xin Yan’s appearance was outstanding. Although she was not the finest, she was still quite outstanding. Not only that, they have heard that Highness Ying had been keeping a lady of beauty by his side, and seemed to be inseparable from him. That person is most likely her.

Highness Ying actually sent this person to bring tribute to Jun Wu Xie. That was how much attention is being paid to Jun Wu Xie!

When that group of people thought about it, their hearts trembled.

Only the fear in Nangong Yan’s heart was deeper, even the City Lords of the cities led by him felt even more regretful at this moment.

If they had known that Jun Wu Xie had a certain relationship with Highness Ying, then even if it killed them, they would not have tried to butt heads with Jun Wu Xie.

This was great! They had offended Sea Spirit City, and also offended Nangong Lie, and now Highness Ying was added to the equation, they suddenly felt that even if Bai Zhu did not make a move, their five cities would still be down on their luck.

What the hell did they do wrong!!!!!

The stomachs of the City Lords of the Five City Coalition were all twisted and they were sick with worry but they still had to pretend that nothing was wrong even if their hearts were already bleeding.

The participation of Gu Xin Yan caused a more than subtle shift in the atmosphere of the Banquet of Heroes. It had seemingly highlighted the identity of Jun Wu Xie.

As everyone pondered about how many bargaining chips Jun Wu Xie held, they drank more and more. Just as they were getting intoxicated, Jun Wu Xie put down her white jade cup.

Everyone raised their eyes to look at Jun Wu Xie, waiting for her to speak.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the crowd with no expression on her face and said, “This feast is solely for the purpose of announcing something to everyone.”

Huh?

Something to announce?

Everyone paid immediate attention.

Jun Wu Xie spoke: “From today onwards, Sea Spirit City is the Overlord of the 72 Cities. Anyone who disagrees is welcome to come forward and challenge me.”

As soon as Jun Wu Xie finished speaking, the marble table in front of her shattered from what seemed like immense pressure. It started from the bottom of her white jade cup, and spread like a huge cobweb!

The shattering sound, in the dead silent hall, was like the nerves in the listener’s ears, exploding one by one!

Even the ever-calm Bai Zhu also widened his eyes after hearing Jun Wu Xie’s words.

Overlord of the 72 Cities ...

What... was he talking about?!!

Everyone couldn’t believe their ears. The whole banquet hall fell deadly silent, and everyone was staring at Jun Wu Xie, thinking if they were hearing things.

“Yan ... Lord Yan ... Are you kidding me?” Asked a shivering voice.

72 cities unified?

Was he crazy? !!

Jun Wu Xie calmly looked at the questioning City Lord and said with a loud voice, “The strongest is king, do you not understand this?”

A pop sounded!

The marble table in front of Jun Wu Xie shattered into powder at this moment!
