Chapter 2985 The four knights 4

A slight smile appeared on Su Ruiying’s face. That faint smile dragged her facial features, causing the cross scar on her face to twitch and looked abnormally ferocious.

“I really did not think that a place like Sea Spirit City can still produce talents like Lord Yan. Sea Spirit City is close to the Sea of Death. I wonder if Lord Yan dreams, will you often hear the children cry? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Upper Realm had the habit of infusing newborn babies with the blood of Sea Spirit Beast. Those babies who were not able to accommodate the infusion will die and those small corpses would also be packed in big wooden boxes and placed into carts one after another. They would then be pulled to the beach and thrown into the Sea of ​​Death. The name Sea of ​​Death came out of it. On the dark seabed, many wooden boxes were buried with countless babies.

There had been rumors that in the dead of night, when walking to the Sea of ​​Death, listening to the sound of waves breaking the shore, cries of the babies would come along with the sea water, which belongs to the babies who died.

Su Ruiying’s words seemed a little weird tonight. She was laughing with her red cracked lips like a big mouth in a blood basin, with a cross scar on her face. It looked strange and eerie.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Su Ruiying with a blank expression, wondering why she suddenly mentioned this matter.

That rumor, Jun Wu Xie had also heard of it. She had visited the coast of the Sea of Death at night, but she could not hear anything.

What did the babies know about fear of death and where would there be the grudge of death?

They were still so ignorant, so ignorant, they were taken away, fearing that they would have no chance to avenge their grievances.

“How’s the sound? Does it sound good? Have you ...”

“Ying.” Chi Yan frowned slightly, as if thinking of something. Suddenly he opened his mouth to stop Su Ruiying’s unfinished words.

Su Ruiying’s eyeball turned, squinting towards Chi Yan. The smile at the corner of her mouth also converged a little. She settled down towards Jun Wu Xie’s dumped body, and she recovered her dead face.

“Ying’s temperament has always been like this, Lord Yan please do not be alarmed.” Chi Yan said.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly, but felt some weirdness in her heart. Chi Yan didn’t seem like a thoughtful person. Suddenly he interrupted Su Ruiying’s words, and also said this seemingly harmonious rhetoric. This made Jun Wu Xie feel that he seemed to be hiding something.

In fact, not only the words of Su Ruiying were weird, the existence of the Knight of Destruction was a huge mystery.

According to Jun Wu Yao’s experience in the Upper Realm, the strength of His Lord could be said to overwhelm everything. He did not need any helpers to control the entire Upper Realm, or even the Three Realms. Only few people knew that the four Knights of Destruction were created, and they were hidden in the Upper Realms.

What was this for?

Questions lingered in Jun Wu Xie’s mind, but Chi Yan spoke again at this moment.

“Lord Yan, you are the second strongest person with a Dual Spirit Ring besides the Lord. Your strength has been confirmed in the previous Top Ten Expert. With your ability, you can be more than a Top Ten Expert, so His Lord intends to invite you to take a step higher ... “
