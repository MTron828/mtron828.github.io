Chapter 2155: Sudden Calamity Out of Nowhere (7)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Back when the Spirit Jade Palace was persecuted by the Twelve Palaces, throughout the vast lands the entire Middle Realm was, there wasn’t a place for them to hide, till they were pursued to the foot of Mount Fu Yao, where they had no choice but to run into the mountains.

Mount Fu Yao had Mount Fu Yao’s own set of rules. Without permission, even the leaders of the Nine Temples and the Twelve Palaces were not allowed to enter. But as the Spirit Jade Palace had no other way out, in order to survive, they barged their way in. As the pursuers from the Twelve Palaces were fearful of the Cloudy Brook Academy’s power and influence, they had to withdraw from the place. The Spirit Jade Palace’s people hid in the mountains for several days and they had thought that they would be chased out by the Cloudy Brook Academy. Never would they have expected that the Cloudy Brook Academy’s Headmaster would suddenly appear, and not only did he not chase them away, he allowed them to use a cave in Mount Fu Yao to hide themselves.

And it was from that time that the Spirit Jade Palace began to live inside Mount Fu Yao. Although the Twelve Palaces suspected that the Spirit Jade Palace had never left the place, they did not dare to charge in there because they feared the Cloudy Brook Academy’s might.

It could be said that the Spirit Jade Palace owed the Cloudy Brook Academy a debt as big as the Heavens as if not for the Cloudy Brook Academy’s Headmaster’s offer of shelter, they would all have died under the Twelve Palaces’ persecution.

All of that were things the masked girl had never heard before. Hearing about it today, her eyes were filled with shock.

“Back when the Cloudy Brook Academy closed, I had thought that something was strange. I thought that they would be able to escape and not expected that.....” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s brows creased up. In Mount Fu Yao, it was all due to the Cloudy Brook Academy’s Headmaster help that allowed them to live through one of their most trying period. At that time, the Cloudy Brook Academy’s Headmaster had often gone to the Spirit Jade Palace for idle chat. It wasn’t due to anything else but just because of the benevolence shown to them even though the Spirit Jade Palace Lord was resistant against any form of contact with other men, he still engaged in merry chat with the Headmaster. Throughout the frequent conversation between them, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord could sense that the Headmaster was seemingly hiding from certain forces, but as to who those people were exactly, he did not know.

“How could it be the Nine Temples?” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord was rather puzzled.

Back before the Spirit Jade Palace went into decline, they had had some interaction with the Nine Temples. The Nine Temples greatly respected the Cloudy Brook Academy, just like the Twelve Palaces, never going against the Cloudy Brook Academy’s wishes. All of a sudden, why had it all changed?

“This does not seem like what the Nine Temples will do. If my guess is correct, someone must be pulling the strings from behind.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord said gravely.

“My Lord..... then what should we do? Both Miss Jun and the Cloudy Brook Academy are our benefactors, so we cannot sit back and wash out hands of this!” The masked girl said anxiously.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord was quiet for a long, long while before he lifted his head to look at the anxiously masked girl and said: “Are you..... afraid of death?”

The masked girl was taken aback a moment before she immediately said: “Your disciple is not afraid of death!”

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord suddenly laughed out loud.

“Good. As expected of a disciple of our Spirit Jade Palace.”

“My Lord.....”

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord got up, and pulled his cape over his shoulders.

“Go get Granny Yue. Our Spirit Jade Palace has laid dormant for a thousand years, and the entire Middle Realm thinks our Spirit Jade Palace has lost its backbone. It is time that we let all of them know just what kind of a bunch of people we are in the Spirit Jade Palace.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The masked girl’s eyes shone with a glint of delight, and she immediately kowtowed in gratitude of the Palace Lord’s benevolence, before scuttling out to go fetch Granny Yue without wasting a single moment.

On the way in with the masked girl, Granny Yue was already told about everything that was happening and when she came before the Spirit Jade Palace Lord, her hunched back form halted with one hand held behind her, the other hand gripped around her walking stick, her eyes shining brightly as she looked at the Spirit Jade Palace Lord.

“My Lord, you’ve decided?”
