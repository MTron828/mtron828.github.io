Chapter 3033 His Lord 3

“I have heard a little bit about what happened between you and Long Yao previously. The Upper Realm has always been a place only for the strong. Long Yao lost to you and he only got himself to blame. But ...” His Lord’s words suddenly changed.

“No matter what, Long Yao was also one of the Knights of Destruction. He died so abruptly and now the tasks that were supposedly left to him are left undone. No one has dealt with it yet. Yan Hai, although I will not hold you accountable for killing Long Yao, he has unfinished matters and you need to settle them.” His Lord looked at Jun Wu Xie and said.

“I don’t know what it is about?” Jun Wu Xie said indifferently.

“It’s not a big deal. I was intending to let you over after you became a real Knight of Destruction, but it’s just too late by then.” His Lord paused and said: “I need you to go to a place to help me retrieve a few things. ”

Retrieve a few things?

There was a slight flash in Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

“I have explained to Chi Yan about the specific things. When time comes, he will take you there. As for purging your memories, it will not be too late after you come back.” His Lord said.

“Yes.” Jun Wu Xie responded.

“This operation was originally to be handed over to Long Yao and the four of them, but now that Long Yao is dead, Jun Gu’s strength is not yet stable, so you, Chi Yan and Su Ruiying will go to ... There is a slight deficiency, so I have arranged another person to come over.” His Lord’s gaze turned and raised his hand.

With a clap, a figure came slowly from the other side of the hall.

When the man’s appearance fell into Jun Wu Xie’s vision, her eyes were slightly stunned.

The handsome man walked to the center of the hall, kneeling in front of His Lord in front of Jun Wu Xie and Chi Yan.

“My father.” The man with a smile on his mouth raised his head slightly, but that face was a face that Jun Wu Xie was no longer familiar with.

Gu Ying!

The person who appeared in front of Jun Wu Xie turned out to be Gu Ying!

“Get up.” His Lord said with a smile, “This time to get you back early, there are important things that you need to deal with. You will join Chi Yan for this mission.

Speaking of which, His Lord paused and his eyes fell on Jun Wu Xie.

“Yan Hai, this is my son, everyone addresses him as Highness Ying. Ying’er, this is Yan Hai, which Long Yao mentioned before. This time, both of you must walk together. Both of you are of similar age. You can also take care of each other along the way. ”

Following His Lord’s words, Gu Ying slowly turned around. His seemingly clear eyes and Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes met.

But for a moment, Gu Ying smiled and said politely: “Is this Yan Hai? I have long heard about you before the banquet of heroes. I had some matters to attend to, I couldn’t go in person.Quite sorry about it. I never expected that we could see each other today. ”

The Gu Ying in front of him was gentle and with a sincere smile. If Jun Wu Xie knows what he had done in the Middle Realm and the Lower Realm, it would be difficult to link up the person in front of him with his past.

“Highness Ying, I have not thanked you for your gift previously. I thank you today.” Jun Wu Xie said calmly.

Gu Ying smiled.

“Oh? Ying’er, do you already know Yan Hai?” His Lord raised his eyebrows slightly.

Gu Ying turned around and said: “Reporting to father, I heard that Sea Spirit City was going to host a banquet of heroes of the 72 Cities, so I sent someone to send some gifts previously.”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
