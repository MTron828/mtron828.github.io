Chapter 2891: The Secret of The Sacred Maiden Tribe (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Ling’er’s cries of anguish let Jun Wu Xie quickly learn what the Sacred Maiden Tribe was doing in the dark.

It was evident that the Sacred Maiden Tribe was dependent on the youth potion that Elder Luo had concocted to maintain their youthful appearances despite possessing weak spiritual powers. And in order for Elder Luo to create this youth potion, she needed test subjects but she also could not use anyone from the tribe to conduct such heinous experiments. Therefore, she set her sights on those servant girls who had been brought along by powerful men when they were invited to the Holy Mountain.

And Ling’er was the victim of one such instance. Ling’er was just an ordinary maid, and in terms of the benefits that Li Wan Ting had received from the Sacred Maiden Tribe, even if a servant girl went missing in the Holy Mountain, he wouldn’t be bothered by it. And he wouldn’t cause a scene just for Ling’er.

Therefore, it was more than suitable to capture such a person to be Elder Luo’s test subject.

In fact, it was unknown how many women Elder Luo had been tortured before Ling’er!

Even for Jun Wu Xie, she was extremely uncomfortable with what Elder Luo had done. She abhorred all experiments that use others as test subjects. This was against the will of others and obliterated the living rights of those people. Jun Wu Xie was unwilling to accept it.

Watching Ling’er pour out her pain for the past 500 years, with her face covered in tears, Jun Wu Xie could almost imagine what kind of life Ling’er had lived in these 500 years .

“Save me, please. I beg you” Ling’er looked at Jun Wu Xie and begged. This was her only chance. She didn’t want to live like this anymore.

Elder Luo’s poisonous potions tortured Ling’er to the brink of insanity. Countless of times, she had thought that she was going to die with ushc torture, only to be saved by Elder Luo using other poisonous potions.

Sometimes she could not help but want to end her life, at least that was much better than living in torture.

“Not yet.” Jun Wu Xie said after a moment.

Despair appeared on Ling’er’s face. She thought that the boy in front of her could save her, but she did not expect ...

The little bit of hope shining in her eyes extinguished instantly, as the despair in Ling’er’s eyes almost obscured the light in her eyes.

“According to what you said, Elder Luo’s poisonous potion is successful this time. At least, she will not develop any new potions for the next few days. Hence in the next few days, you will be safe. If I let you go now, you will not be able to escape far anyway. If you want true freedom, trust in me. “Jun Wu Xie spoke to Ling’er in an even tone. Jun Wu Xie had not completed her tasks in the Sacred Maiden Tribe, until then, she would not leave. If she were to release Ling’er now, not only would it alert her enemies, with Ling’er’s current state of health, she might get recaptured halfway by Elder Luo or die on the steep slopes of the Holy Mountain.

“You ... You will you save me?” Ling’er looked at Jun Wu Xie with uncertainty.

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

Ling’er had provided her with useful information, and naturally Jun Wu Xie would not let anyone who has helped her suffer. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This was Jun Wu Xie’s principle.

Except...

The timing was wrong.

Ling’er was not stupid. To be able to enjoy favour from Li Wan Ting for many years, she had to be more than just a pretty face. She had an intelligence about her, and she knew that Jun Wu Xie had no need to lie to her. The young man in front of her was being truthful.

She still had a chance!
