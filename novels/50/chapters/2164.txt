Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

During the last Battle of Deities Grand Meet, Su Jing Yan did not have make any moves at all. He only stood by as a bystander and watched silently. Seeing the Twelve Palaces vying for all the promising youths that participated in the grand meet, during that heated battle, the one and only person that had caught his attention was Jun Wu Xie.

Coming from the Spirit Mastery Tribe of the Middle Realm, this was the key reason for him remembering this youth. At that time, Jun Wu Xie represented the already fallen Spirit Jade Palace and was adamant on entering the Cloudy Brook Academy with the identity as a disciple of the Spirit Jade Palace. That itself had stirred up quite a commotion. Hence, Su Jing Yan’s curiosity had also been piqued about this strange youth and this was how he had an impression of Jun Wu Xie in his memory.

He initially thought that being the sole person from the Spirit Mastery Tribe, Jun Wu Xie would set off a wave of storms in the Twelve Palaces. However, he never had thought that after this youth had left the Cloudy Brook Academy, he seemed to have disappeared entirely and slowly over time, the memory of this youth started to fade.

Suddenly meeting Jun Wu Xie, moreover in such a situation, unless Su Jing Yan was a fool, how could he not see that the reason for Jun Wu Xie to appear here was Su Ya?

“That’s right.” Jun Wu Xie did not evade her answer at all and responded directly to Su Jing Yan’s words. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Su Jing Yan’s expression revealed a slight trace of shock, such a honest and straightforward answer? Just like that?

“Since you know that Su Ya had been caught by the Nine Temples, why do you still dare to come here? Are you seeking your own death?” Su Jing Yan frowned.

“Su Ya is my Master.” Jun Wu Xie replied curtly.

Su Jing Yan was stunned momentarily.

Master?

Just because Su Ya was his Master, he would not hesitate to break into Mount Fu Yao without any regards? Did he not know what kind of people he would make enemies out of?

“What about that? Although Su Ya is your Master, but she has become the prisoner of the Nine Temples. Us knowing each other can also be a form of fate, let me tell you this, even if you have any heaven defying abilities and go all out, there is absolutely no possibility to bring her out of Mount Fu Yao. I advise you to leave as soon as possible, as for today’s matter, I shall take it as it had never happened.” Su Jing Yan said in a low tone and although his words all sounded high and arrogant, but it was strange that his words were all the truth and there were even some anxiety mixed in.

Jun Wu Xie had met all sorts of people that were crafty as foxes and venomous as snakes. They deliberately deceived people with their flowery words, but she could tell that Su Jing Yan was speaking the truth. He was not trying to protect himself and tried to trick her, he was sincerely persuading her to leave for her own safety.

Why was this so?

“Su Ya is my Master, I will not abandon her.” Jun Wu Xie said resolutely.

Su Jing Yan’s brows furrowed even deeper. He had a pretty good impression of Jun Wu Xie. He was rather fond of this interesting youth. But because of the of the Heavenly Wolf Temple’s circumstances that he was unable to invite this youth. Or else, he wouldn’t let go of such a talent to the Spirit Jade Palace.

“Wu Xie, I don’t care who you are but for the matters happening at Mount Fu Yao, these are things that you cannot meddle in. Since you are Su Ya’s disciple, then you should naturally know her strength. But the way things stand, she doesn’t even have the power to turn things around, so even if you risk all you’ve got and come here with the intention to die, nothing will change the outcome. You can’t save Su Ya and will only throw your own life away as well! Since it is a futile effort, why are you still seeking the path of death?”

“Seeking the path of death?” Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes and looked at her shadow that was illuminated by the moonlight. In a sombre tone, she said: “So you want me to watch my own Master die and do nothing?”

Her voice was very faint, but it was filled with deep oppression. Su Jing Yan even felt a trace of killing intent...
