Chapter 2831: Seriously want to marry ? (1)

At the banquet, Duan Qi and Elder Yun had a fright. What they most expected now was that Jun Gu came earlier to marry Han Zi Fei, so that Jun Wu Xie could find her own maiden. Or else, having such a big beauty around like Han Zi Fei, the other maidens were not comparable to her at all.

Where did Han Shu still have the mood to eat? Her pair of eyes were either looking at Jun Wu Xie with affection or staring at Han Zi Fei with her teeth gritted. This woman was really confused and did not know what to do. She mostly kept her head down and said nothing.

Jun Wu Xie had no other thoughts at the moment. She was tangled in the question of “how to convince Han Zi Fei to give up Jun Gu”.

Only Han Zi Fei was full of smiles, enjoying wine and food, and from time to time she glanced at her confused little girl.

By the end of the banquet, the farce was finally over.

Everyone dispersed. Duan Qi and Elder Yun came forward to say a few polite words to Jun Wu Xie and exchange some courtesies while she absent-mindedly replied a few words and left.

When she left, she secretly followed Han Zi Fei instead of returning back to her residence. As she followed her secretly, they arrived at the Sacred Maiden Hall.

Han Zi Fei walked under the silvery moonlight and her black dress added a bit of mystery to her. Her serving maid greeted her diligently but Han Zi Fei waved her hand in dismissal and said: “I drank quite a bit of wine tonight. I wish to remain in the courtyard to wake myself from the drunkness. You can step down, don’t bother me.”

The maid nodded nicely and retreated.

No matter what Han Zi Fei did before, but now she is still the Sacred Maiden of The Sacred Maiden Tribe. Other than the words from the elders, no one dares to disobey her words.

The night was deep and the snow white flowers were blooming on the snow in the courtyard.

Han Zi Fei swept away the frost on the stone bench, sat down indifferently, looked up at the beautiful moon when she said, “Come out.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the quiet courtyard, Han Zi Fei’s voice seemed to have a little echo.

A figure flashed under the moonlight, yet there was no trace on the snow as she appeared before Han Zi Fei.

Jun Wu Xie appeared in front of Han Zi Fei expressionlessly. The moonlight and white snow reflected her pair of confused eyes and she appeared to have lost her usual sharpness and looked a little more bewildered.

“I haven’t seen you for a long time. You little girl has grown up a lot. Can you really wield Dual Spirit Rings?” Han Zi Fei crossed her long legs as she looked at the “noble guest” with one hand propped on her chin.

Jun Wu Xie said: “Yes, I am able to.”

For some reason, she obviously wanted to ask Han Zi Fei. However, it was Han Zi Fei’s question that made Jun Wu Xie respond involuntarily .

Han Zi Fei scanned Jun Wu Xie from the top to the bottom, as if she wanted to find something on her.

“People in the Three Realms, no matter what their physical strength, no matter how high their talents, they can only condense one Spirit Ring at most. That is, no matter how much spiritual power they have, they can only make that one spiritual ring more powerful. Unless you have two spiritual powers in your body, else you cannot divide the spiritual powers at all. However, it is impossible to divide the spiritual powers. If you want to get a Dual Spirit Ring, the other Spirit Ring has to be bestowed upon by another. The Spirit Ring can only be removed when the person is willing to give it before it can be integrated into oneself. How did you get Dual Spirit Rings? “Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie with a sombre expression.
