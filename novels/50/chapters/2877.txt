“Of course. Please rest assured, Lord Yan. I’ll arrange someone to take you to the Holy Land tomorrow.” Elder Yun naturally answered without saying a word. Anyway, it was just to let Jun Wu Xie enter the Holy Land to cultivate her psychic force. There was no loss to the Sacred Maiden Tribe. After all, within the Holy Land, there was a difficult Lord to deal with.

Jun Wu Xie nodded. After getting the answer she wanted, she was not interested in entertaining Elder Yun anymore. She bidded goodbye and left the hall.

From the end of the banquet to the departure of Jun Wu Xie, Duan Qi never said a word. She was depressed and her pursed lips revealed her dissatisfaction at the moment.

“Elder Duan, this matter has come to an end. We can’t do anything about it. You don’t need to worry about this matter anymore. No matter how inferior Yan Xi is, she is from our tribe. We still have a chance.” said Elder Yun, looking at Duan Qi’s distressed face.

Duan Qi took a deep breath as her eyes revealed her unwillingness.

“We know how formidable Yan Hai is. Such a person is most likely to have a new Sacred Maiden this time. But ... Why is it Yan Xi ... Yan Xi’s bloodline is too inferior to even compare to an average bloodline. I’m just afraid ... ”

“There is no other way now. Instead of worrying about this, there is one more thing I want to ask you.” Elder Yun said sharply.

“Just go ahead and ask.”

“Previously ... Highness Ying sent someone to notify us that he will arrive when Lord Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei get married. Why is there no news now?” Elder Yun frowned lightly. Highness Ying’s identity was very delicate in the Upper Realms. He always appears out of nowhere. He is also crowned the Son of His Lord. Although his strength was not as good as that of Knight of Destruction, he could still control the Top Ten Experts. According to rumors, Highness Ying is still young and he was not married ...

As far as Elder Yun was concerned, she felt that if she could get permission from Highness Ying, their maidens could even work with Highness Ying...

Mentioning Highness Ying, Duan Qi’s brows smoothened out a little.

“Highness Ying’s message had just arrived yesterday. The message says that His Lord has something to discuss with him, so it delayed his departure time. It is estimated that it will take several days to reach the Holy Mountain.”

“After a few days, Lord Jun Gu and the rest would have already left ?” Elder Yun was a little puzzled.

Duan Qi shook her head. “Although Highness Ying said that he would come at this time, it was not entirely for the Lord Jun Gu. When Highness Ying was previously retrieved back by His Lord, he was mentally unstable. His Lord keeps sending people to restore his psychic force. However, the best place to repair psychic force is the Holy Mountain on our Holy Land. Therefore, even if Lord Jun Gu leaves, Highness Ying will come. He will remain in the Holy Land for a while to cultivate. Please remember to tell this to Elder Luo. Neglecting Highness Ying will not benefit the Sacred Maiden Tribe. ”

Elder Yun was slightly surprised, and nodded immediately.

“You can rest assured that I will definitely inform Elder Luo about this matter. I will take Yan Hai directly to the Holy Land tomorrow, and inform Elder Luo about this matter.”

“Ok, you just handle this.” Duan Qi nodded. Maybe because Highness Ying was coming. The unwillingness in Duan Qi’s heart started to fade a little.
