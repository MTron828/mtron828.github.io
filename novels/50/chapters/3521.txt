Chapter 2116: The Hero Saves the Damsel (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“That’s right. Why not..... you cajole and wheedle a little for me to spare you?” Jun Wu Yao said with an absolutely roguish augh.

Jun Wu Xie glanced up at him and then said indifferently: “No need.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Her voice had just fallen when her arm hooked around Jun Wu Yao’s neck and pulled his head down hard, as she pushed herself up on her toes to plant a great kiss onto his lips.

“.....”

Against Jun Wu Xie’s brash and unrestrained self that appeared out of the blue from time to time, Jun Wu Yao gradually went from flabbergasted shock to it gradually becoming diminished surprise..... If Ye Mei and his gang were here to see Jun Wu Yao in that state, they would have been speechless.

“Is that enough?” Jun Wu Xie nonchalantly pulled away from Jun Wu Yao slightly, the bright sparkling eyes reflecting his face in them.

Which was still slightly tinged with pink.....

“Cough.....” A cough suddenly sounded.

Jun Wu Xie turned to the source of that sound, and happened to see the Spirit Lord directly opposite her cell looking at her and Jun Wu Yao with an expression showing great hesitation to speak.

Those eyes seemed to be protesting their “lovey-doveyness”.

“When you said that there will not be a problem, was it because you were certain that someone would come rescue you?” The Spirit Lord’s gaze was conflicted as he looked at Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao. Because Jun Wu Yao had swooped in too fast and the light inside the dungeon was too dim, the Spirit Lord had completely been unable to see what Jun Wu Yao looked like at all, merely able to see that a tall man was standing beside Jun Wu Xie.

Because his power of the spirit was sealed by the Soul Binding Chains, the Spirit Lord was not even able to sense the man aura at all.

But he could be certain of one point.

The man who had suddenly appeared in here was definitely not weak!

The intricate Soul Binding Chains had not been able to withstand his power in the slightest and the Spirit Lord was not even certain he could accomplish that when he was at his peak.

“Mm.” Jun Wu Xie had no intention of hiding anything and she nodded her head.

The Spirit Lord’s eyes then had a glint of surprise rise up in them.

Jun Wu Xie turned her head and tugged at a corner of Jun Wu Yao’s sleeve.

“He.....”

“I know, the Spirit Lord.” Jun Wu Yao did not wait for Jun Wu Xie to speak and just went ahead to reveal the Spirit Lord’s identity.

Thinking about it quickly, as Jun Wu Yao had at least fought the Spirit Lord before, Jun Wu Xie then thought it was quite normal that he was able to recognize the Spirit Lord.

But the Spirit Lord was rather surprised that his identity had been recognized so readily. But with the circumstances he was in, there wasn’t much time for him to think too much about that.

“Qiao Chu and the others were also captured. Wu Jiu and that imposter are hiding insidious intentions.....” Jun Wu Xie briefly told Jun Wu Yao everything she had heard from the Spirit Lord about sacrificing the Three Realms in blood, and Jun Wu Yao quietly listened to everything she had to say without showing the slightest surprise.

“That is indeed the style of the Upper Realm. Let’s not talk about these things here. Let’s get the lot of you out of here first.” Jun Wu Yao said with a laugh, as if the earth shattering plot he just heard was nothing significant at all.

Jun Wu Xie nodded in agreement. If they were going to rescue people, they would naturally not abandon the Spirit Lord. She tugged at Jun Wu Yao’s sleeve and Jun Wu Yao immediately understood what she meant. He walked out from the cell and went right before the Spirit Lord’s cell door.

The Spirit Lord’s face was still filled with joy as he had not expected that Jun Wu Xie would really have such a trump card hidden up her sleeve. Having been trapped in this dark dungeon for so long without having ever seen the light of day, he had already lost all hope. He had never thought that his fate would actually be rewritten right from this moment on.

However, before the Spirit Lord’s joy had subsided, in the instant when that tall figure gradually came to be revealed under the sparse amount of light, the smile at the edges of the Spirit Lord’s lips congealed at that very moment and his eyes bulged as he stared at Jun Wu Yao who was just an arm’s length away from him, his face twisting up in disbelieving incredulity!
