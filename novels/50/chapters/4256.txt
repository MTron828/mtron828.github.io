Jun Gu followed closely behind as his gaze was fixated on Han Zi Fei’s back and felt his mood lighten by quite a bit. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Sacred Maiden ...”

“The reason I called you over tonight is because there is a person I want to introduce you to.” Han Zi Fei’s words turned around and looked a little serious to Jun Gu.

Jun Gu shook slightly.

Han Zi Fei said: “Come out.”

When the words landed, a shadow appeared quietly in the silent courtyard.

Jun Gu took a closer look and found that what appeared in front of him turned out to be the young man sitting next to himself at the previous banquet. The young man felt cold and indifferent and he had a pair of extremely bright and clear eyes. All of Jun Gu’s thoughts were on Han Zi Fei’s body at the time. He paid no attention to the young man in front of him.

“You are?” Jun Gu looked at Jun Wu Xie with some doubt.

He didn’t understand why Han Zi Fei wanted to introduce the young man to him.

“Stupid.” Before Jun Wu Xie said anything, Han Zi Fei couldn’t help saying.

Jun Gu looked stiff and somewhat helpless. He didn’t know the reason why. He was always worried that Han Zi Fei was unhappy.

Jun Wu Xie was a little embarrassed ... Seeing her father was abandoned by Han Zi Fei, she felt really confused.

Han Zi Fei raised her eyes and swept around Jun Gu’s waist, and hooked her fingers towards Jun Gu and said, “Take down the copper ball around your waist and show it to me.”

Jun Gu took it down and handed it to Han Zi Fei’s hands. His response was particularly well-behaved.

Jun Wu Xie ... her heart was feeling very complicated.

Han Zi Fei held the copper ball in her hand. The scent of rhinoceros horn sprang out of the copper ball, lingering in her nose. She raised her eyebrow slightly and asked Jun Gu: Did Yan Xi put that on you? ”

Jun Gu nodded honestly.

“Oh, good intentions.” Han Zi Fei tossed the copper ball in her hand and then threw it to Jun Wu Xie who was standing aside: “Is this what you mentioned before?”

When Jun Wu Xie mentioned Jun Gu previously, he once told Han Zi Fei that Jun Gu was probably controlled by the rhinoceros horn, but the specifics were still uncertain.

Jun Wu Xie checked it and saw a burning rhinoceros horn inside the copper ball.

“Do you have a solution?” Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie and asked.

“I can try.” Jun Wu Xie set the copper ball aside and looked up to Jun Gu, “Can I take a look at your pulse?”

Jun Gu looked at Jun Wu Xie in a puzzled manner, before he could speak, Han Zi Fei on the side urged: “Let him check your pulse, there’s no need to be so nervous, I’ve always wanted to know more about my future husband’s body?” She also glanced ambiguously at Jun Gu, as her gaze lingered somewhere below his waist.

Jun Gu’s face turned red and could not even find any words to speak. He only nodded in silence. Han Zi Fei’s behavior was very persistent, but he didn’t know why. He did not hate it, but he liked it very much instead.

Jun Wu Xie could only control herself. Everything that she was doing now was all in a bid to save her father and she had to ignore Han Zi Fei’s teasing to her father ... She calmed her heart as she faced him and checked his pulse. The pulse of Jun Gu was very stable and an ordinary doctor would not be able to find any issues with his pulse. But Jun Wu Xie found some abnormalities in such a smooth pulse ...
