Jun Wu Yao was completely shocked as he stood frozen in place, every molecule in his body screaming at him to pull her into his embrace.

But this time, Jun Wu Yao was able to control his impulse.

Having just recovered just a few moments ago, Qiao Chu turned his eyes and was immediately greeted by such a “crazy and heartless” display of affection, where it almost caused him to vomit out blood. Tormented both in his heart and mind, he clutched at his chest and leaned heavily on Hua Yao’s shoulder to say painfully.

“Little Xie has changed. She’s really changed. She is no longer the same girl I knew in the past.”

[What a pure and innocent budding little girl she was then. Now, she is actually taking the initiative to force a kiss upon Jun Wu Yao!]

[Society in this entire world is crumbling!]

Hua Yao turned to glance at Qiao Chu.

“You’re envious?” Hua Yao asked with an eyebrow raised.

Qiao Chu glared at him and replied: “What is there for me to be envious about? Don’t I still have Brother Hua here..... Oww!”

Qiao Chu had not even finished what he wanted to say when Hua Yao’s leg lashed out with a kick, that sent Qiao Chu tumbling away.

Fei Yan was heartlessly laughing hysterically at the side, like seeing Qiao Chu being bashed up gave him the greatest sense of delight.

Jun Wu Xie held the kiss for a while before she pulled herself away slightly. Looking at the slightly flushed faced Jun Wu Yao, she could not help herself as she poked at Jun Wu Yao’s cheek with a finger.

“Feeling better now?”

“.....” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie’s stern expression, and suddenly felt like crying and laughing at the same time. He reached a hand out to pinch Jun Wu Xie on the chin and said with a laugh: “A little better, but still not enough. Why not you kiss me again?”

Jun Wu Xie blinked her eyes.

Qiao Chu standing at the side was going to go mad. He felt that if he were to stay there any longer, he would get a stye in his eye, and hence he went running outside mournfully. Hua Yao and the others then self consciously retreated out from the room, leaving the space for Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao alone.

“Is it because having my face changed makes it fresher for you?” Jun Wu Xie asked Jun Wu Yao with a serious look on her face. Even if she had not eaten pork before, she would have seen a pig run. Back in the organization in her past life, among the topics of conversation those men in there occasionally discussed about, would be the constant changing of girlfriends.

Jun Wu Yao’s brows furrowed, and then suddenly came right beside Jun Wu Xie’s face, where he lightly bit Jun Wu Xie’s cheek.

It wasn’t painful, but it felt was if there was an element of punishment in that.

“The flesh shell is in the end, still transient. What I care about is you.” Needless to mention that Jun Wu Xie had changed to be so attractive. Back when Jun Wu Xie had disguised herself as a plain and unimpressive youth, Jun Wu Yao had still kissed her when he wanted to!

Jun Wu Xie was coaxed to laugh lightly aloud.

Jun Wu Xie’s laugh immediately caused the stifling repressive feeling in Jun Wu Yao’s heart to disappear without a trace, as if he only needed to see her smile and nothing in the world would be able to frustrate and worry him.

Carrying the looks she had in her previous life, Jun Wu Xie no longer had to worry that she would be captured with all the portraits of her that were everywhere. And she had asked Jun Wu Yao who told her that the alteration of her looks could be extended indefinitely. As long as Jun Wu Xie wished, Jun Wu Yao would be able let her spirit remain in that state.

With everything prepared and only lacking the east wind, Jun Wu Xie had discussed it with Qiao Chu and the others where they agreed that they would go to the fourth Serene Spirit Tower the next day to sign themselves up to part of the construction team.

In the areas surrounding the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, there were still some spirits residing there who had not yet moved away, where Beast Spirits number the greatest. Because the Serene Spirit Tower was urgently in need of recruiting human spirits, quite a number of human spirits were also moving about in the vicinity of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower.

The man who was in charge of recruitment was carrying a book in his hand as he stood at the outer perimeter. Before him were long snaking lines, all of them human spirits here to be interviewed.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
