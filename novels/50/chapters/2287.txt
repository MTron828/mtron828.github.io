How could this be?!

Qiu Yun was stiff and he looked at her face in a daze as inexplicable fear started to radiate from within and spread throughout his entire body.

He stepped back subconsciously as his face paled with shock. He stared at her and under the pressure of immense fear, he still pretended to say in a calm manner: “Kill me? Well, we still have to see if you have this ability! People! Capture this woman and the Night Regime for me!”

He did not believe that Jun Wu Xie was really strong enough to contend with those Top Ten Experts from the Upper Realm!

Qiu Yun’s voice broke the strange silence in the city in an instant. The people who stood by the side finally snapped back to their senses and immediately followed Qiu Yun’s command and they unsheathed their swords and rushed towards Jun Wu Xie!

Su Jing Yan recovered from his shock and had realized that the people whom Qiu Yun had brought along were actually rushing towards Jun Wu Xie. For a moment, he couldn’t care about which side they belonged to but only felt worried for her. Although she seemed a lot stronger than before but no matter what, it was only a span of five years. How much change could that bring? Qiu Yun brought a lot of people along with him and just based on the staggering number of Gold Spirits, they were far more than that of the Cloudy Brook Academy then. Being besieged from all sides by so many Gold Spirits, he was afraid that she would suffer tremendously!

Just as he was worried about her, he suddenly discovered that those people from the Night Regime who stood behind her were extremely calm and not a trace of panic could be seen on their faces. For a moment, he even thought that they looked as if they had no intention to fight... Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

What was going on?

Those people of the Night Regime... had no intention to help her?

Before he could fathom what was going on, countless vines suddenly emerged from the land beneath their feet!

The vines that suddenly emerged seemed to have their own consciousness as they crept up the calves of everyone at an extraordinary fast speed and in the blink of an eye, they had locked each and every single person’s movements!

This was simply something that was impossible!

Qiu Yun who was waiting for Jun Wu Xie to be besieged from all sides was shocked to discover that the people he brought were all trapped as their limbs had been tightly secured by emerald green vines. It was as if each and every one of them were frozen in place as they were stopped and could no longer move an inch!

In the vast city, everyone but the Night Regime and Jun Wu Xie were all tightly bounded by the green vines. Those vines that looked soft and fragile had even bound those Gold Spirits and all those sword intent from before had already been covered by the green.

Jun Wu Xie looked at everything before her calmly as she raised her hand slightly. It was only at this moment that people had noticed the peculiarity of the armour on her hand. No one knew when it had extended and turned into countless small vines, each vine was as thin as a strand of hair and were linked from her fingertips to the soil beneath her feet.

Qiu Yun’s eyes widened as he looked at her incredulously. Even if one used their toes to think, those vines that suddenly appeared were definitely what she did!

How did she... achieve such a feat?

Qiu Yun who was similarly bound by the vines could not move at all.
