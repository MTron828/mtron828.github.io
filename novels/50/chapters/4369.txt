Chapter 2965 Come Out and Die! 9

Long Yao had not yet begun to realise that he was being led by the nose by Jun Wu Xie.

“Of course, if Lord Long Yao has no intention to save Bai Zhu, then so be it.” Jun Wu Xie laid the ball squarely in Long Yao’s court.

Long Yao could no longer guess what Jun Wu Xie’s intentions were and could only look at the defenceless Bai Zhu who was sprawled on the floor with a frown.

“Lord Long Yao, save me, please save me! I don’t want to die!” I’m willing to do anything, as long as you save me!” Bai Zhu was at Long Yao’s feet, crying and begging. He knew that Jun Wu XIe’s hatred for him ran so deep that even if he died there and then, it would not erase the hatred.

Begging her was useless, his only hope was Long Yao.

Bai Zhu understood that his status meant nothing to the Top Ten masters. Just looking at the terror on Fan Jinghe’s face, he knew that even if he begged Fan Jinghe, he would be too afraid to act. Long Yao was his last and only hope.

He was no fool. He knew that he had incurred Jun Wu Xie’s wrath by cooperating with Long Yao and if he died, Long Yao would be thoroughly embarrassed. Although Long Yao did not care for Bai Zhu personally, for his own image and reputation, he could not sit back and do nothing.

As expected, after a moment’s thought, Long Yao said to Fang Jinghe, “Come here and examine him.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Fang Jinghe got a shock when he was called upon by Long Yao. Although he was terribly unwilling, he had no choice but to step forward. Jun Wu Xie’s icy glare gave him a bad feeling about what was going to happen.

When Fang Jinghe was hunting down Rong Ruo and Fei Yan, he never thought his day of reckoning would come so soon.

As arrogant as he was in front of Rong Ruo and Fei Yan, he now felt an equal amount of fear and terror.

Fang Jinghe walked with trepidation towards Bai Zhu, who showed no physical signs of the poison’s effects. Under Long Yao’s instructions, Fang Jinghe took out his own silver needle and inserted it into Bai Zhu’s flesh to check for the presence of poison.

Fang Jinghe had absolute confidence in his abilities regarding poison. After calming himself down, he felt that this was a great opportunity.

Jun Wu Xie had said, in front of Long Yao no less, that if he could identify the poison, she would cause no further trouble. Jun Wu Xie may have been a Dual Spirit Ring bearer, but Fang Jinghe was sure that when it came to poisons, he was unsurpassed in the entire Upper Three Realms.

If he could identify the poison, not only could he save Bai Zhu, he could also heal the rift between them and Jun Wu Xie, killing two birds with one stone.

At that moment, Fan Jinghe was no longer afraid as he felt he had the upper hand and could not help but secretly mock Jun Wu Xie’s arrogance.

How could he have joined the Top Ten masters if not for his knowledge of poison?

How could Jun Wu Xie make a bet with Long Yao over poison? This just played into his hands!

With this attitude, Fan Jinghe’s movements quickened and he held his silver needle with a much steadier hand.
