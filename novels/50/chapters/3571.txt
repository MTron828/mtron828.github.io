“It’s not that I’m letting you do this, but this is the only thing that you can do.” Su Jing Yan said in a grave tone with his brows wrinkled. If it was possible, he really didn’t want Jun Wu Xie to be embroiled in this matter. The situation was too complicated and it was not something that Jun Wu Xie could intervene in.

“I can tell you that even if you’ve exhausted all means to save Su Ya, you still can’t walk out of Mount Fu Yao alive. Su Ya’s destined to die here, catching her is to force her Master to appear. Everything has been set up as an inescapable net and Su Ya is bait. For you to have snuck here undiscovered is because you are unable to find traces of her and even if you managed to find it, she’s heavily guarded. Wu Xie, I know that you are extraordinary but how many Gold Spirits can you contend against?” Su Jing Yan raised his head and looked directly at Jun Wu Xie.

“Gold Spirits, sure enough...the people who caught Su Ya are from the Upper Realm.” Jun Wu Xie’s expression suddenly changed.

Su Jing Yan was completely stunned, the killing intent that Jun Wu Xie exuded was thick and murderous, her face showed the thirst for murder, yet in a split second...how did everything change back to a calm?

Unless...

The previous set of actions was just a facade that she had deliberately showed?

Su Jing Yan suddenly felt that he had been duped by Jun Wu Xie and had said something that he should not have said.

“What are you talking about? I don’t seem to understand.” Su Jing Yan removed his gaze and acted as if he had no idea on what she was talking about.

Jun Wu Xie had no intention to let him muddle through this so easily.

“There is only a handful of Gold Spirits in the Middle Realm. The nine people who are known to the world are the Nine Temple Lords of the Nine Temples. Other than these nine, in the entire Middle Realm, the others who’ve attained the Gold Spirit are all reclusive masters. Currently, the Nine Temple Lords have all gathered together in the Heavenly Wolf Temple. Since they are not here, then who could be the Gold Spirits at Mount Fu Yao? And you also mentioned earlier, how many Gold Spirits can I contend against? It is obvious that the number of Gold Spirits in Cloudy Brook Academy is definitely more than one or two. This is not the power that the Middle Realm can come up with. The Nine Temples has always respected Cloudy Brook Academy and never did any disrespectful things. However, they suddenly turned and caught Su Ya to force the Headmaster of Cloudy Brook Academy to appear. This is not something like what the Nine Temples will do... Su Jing Yan, whether you admit it or not, I have already determined that the people who caught Su Ya are from the Upper Realm.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes slowly raised her gaze. She had pretended to be indignant and desperate before, just to let Su Jing Yan relax his vigilance.

Su Jing Yan was not a bad person and it was not difficult to see that he did not want her to be embroiled in this and lose her life in the process. And it was also because of this that she did not take his life away to silence him right after she had attained the answers she wanted.

Never in his dreams would he have thought that he would have been swindled by Jun Wu Xie and his expression was ugly to the extreme. Jun Wu Xie had already identified everything and no matter how much he tried to change his words, she would not believe him.

After a moment, Su Jing Yan started to sweat profusely and he was soon drenched in cold sweat. He raised his head and covered his face as he remained silent for a long while.

After deep contemplation, he sighed and said: “Since you already know who you’re up against, do you still have to come forward to die? I didn’t lie to you, you really do not have any chance to save Su Ya. Those people aren’t in the same league and are not ones that you can contend against.”

“No matter what, I must save her.” Jun Wu Xie replied in a resolute and determined voice.

Su Jing Yan took in a deep breath and raised his head to look at her. He did not understand, how could Jun Wu Xie be so determined and unfaltered despite knowing who the enemies are?

Was she really not afraid of death?
