Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The insane advancement of Jun Wu Xie made many cities unable to keep still. After Jun Wu Xie successively occupied several cities, the City Lords from other cities were invited to visit the official residence of Blazing Flame City. Six calm and powerful men sat in the study room of the official residence.

Seventy-two cities in the Upper Realm were numerous, however the disparity in strength was also huge. Among the 72 cities, within the top ten strongest cities, one could randomly pull out the soldiers from those cities and they would be enough to destroy the others. None of the other cities dared to provoke these ten behemoths.

They kept each other in check so that the seventy-two cities could establish some sort of stability, but at the same time they could compete amongst themselves, so as to conquer the other cities.

However till now, the ten cities were unable to discern who was the best, yet someone had stood out and broke the deadlock of the seventy-two cities.

Among the six people in the study, one of them was Nangong Yan, Lord of the Blazing Flame City! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Blazing Flame City had been among the top cities since the seventy-two cities were stabilised. Along with the rise of Nangong Lie, Nangong Yan’s son, to the top ten exponents, Blazing Flame city’s prestige also buoyed. Today’s gathering, Nangong Yan had invited the City Lords of the top ten cities.

“Have you heard any news about Sea Spirit City?” Nangong Yan took a sip of tea and looked up at the other five City Lords sitting in the study. For so many years, there have been constant battles between the ten major cities. The City Lords had not gotten together for many years like this, who would have thought that the one to bring them together again turned out to be Sea Spirit City, the city that none of them ever held in regard?

“I have heard some news about Sea Spirit City. It was Yan Wan’s son Yan Hai who took over the title of City Lord. In the past, that boy was low key and reserved, no one could tell he was hiding his talents.” The Lord of Hidden Demon City sneered.

“It was Yan Wan who failed to recognise Yan Hai’s talents. After the death of several of his children, this one left behind was considered a jinx. What is Sea Spirit City, it’s delusional to think that the city could break the deadlock of the 72 cities? I’ve really stayed too long in the backcountry. I don’t know what the Upper Realm is like today.” The City Lord of Epic Vesper City chuckled a little, and seemed to disapprove of what happened in Sea Spirit City.

“Now, the kid from Sea Spirit City has occupied several nearby cities in a row. I’ve obtained news that he doesn’t seem to be stopping. Looks like this kid wants to occupy all thirty-two cities.” The City Lord of Heaven Fiend City touched his chin. Among the 72 cities, ten of them were the strongest.

There were as many as thirty cities which were ranked behind the top ten cities. Although these cities were not as powerful as the top ten cities, they also had their own unique skills to protect themselves, which could be regarded as fairly powerful.

After that, there were those cities with fair strength. There were as many as thirty-two cities. Although there were that many, they did not have great strength and did not possess any special fighting power. Therefore, they hovered among the lower rungs of the seventy-two cities. Although there were seventy-two cities, the top ten cities never once regarded the rest as anything more.

“Invade the thirty-two cities? Yan Hai’s appetite is not small.” The City Lord of Resolute City remarked coldly.

“End of the day, the key is the elixir that Sea Spirit City has. I think everyone here has received that elixir. To be honest, my doctors have no way of researching the elixir formula. They have never even heard of the ingredients.” Nangong Yan frowned slightly as he said this.
