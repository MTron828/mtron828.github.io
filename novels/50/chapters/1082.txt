Chapter 1083: “Severing All Ties (1)”

Qu Wen Hao wept as he begged. There was nothing else he could depend on. His face was deathly pale, his eye bloodshot, looking not a single bit as steady and refined as Jun Wu Xie had seen on that day outside the Heavenly Cloud Chambers. Strands of hair around his temple had come loose and hung down loosely, making him look more worn and wretched, his always straightened back now bent over, all for his daughter.

Jun Wu Xie stared coldly at the sorry looking figure of Qu Wen Hao, and not a ripple of emotion showed within her eyes.

“I beg you, help me..... As long as you are willing to help, you can have whatever you want..... My own life, everything that I own, I can can hand them all to you.” Qu Wen Hao cried out aloud, his hand covering his face.

He knew after all that he had done today, he would never be able to gain the forgiveness of Jun Xie. But for Qu Ling Yue, he could not give up on fighting for this one last sliver of hope.

Qu Wen Hao’s crying plea, did not receive a reply from Jun Xie. Qu Wen Hao knelt there in helplessness, in hopeless abandonment.

Xiong Ba clenched up his fists, and his face creased up in a frown. Forlorn sadness and fierce struggle filled his eyes, but he could not make himself speak.

“From now onwards, I sever all ties with the Thousand Beast City, and whether you die or leave, is no concern of mine.” Jun Wu Xie said coldly. Her voice had just dropped and she immediately turned to leave while carrying Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit in her arms, unwilling to see anymore of the courtyard that was filled with betrayal.

She might not have ever seen Xiong Ba and the others as her own companions, but even though that was the case, she had still given to them a certain level of trust.

But after today, that had been completely obliterated.

Jun Wu Yao’s gaze turned slightly, sweeping a quick glance over the crowd of people from the Fiery Blaze Clan, and he stepped away to follow behind Jun Wu Xie’s steps. When he reached her side, he looked at the side of Jun Wu Xie’s face with that cold expression and he asked: “Little Xie’s personality, is becoming softer and softer?”

If he had not earlier promised Jun Wu Xie that he would not stick his hand into the affairs in the Thousand Beast City, that whole courtyard full of people earlier would all already be dead by now.

Jun Wu Xie replied coldly: “They have nothing to do with me, what’s there to talk about?”

The only relationship she had with the Thousand Beast City had only been for them to work together with her and now that Qu Wen Hao had reneged on that agreement, that layer of relationship no longer existed. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie, and an eyebrow arched up on his face, but he did not say anything more.

The two of them departed side by side, leaving Qu Wen Hao only their cold and chilly backs to gaze after.

Qu Wen Hao watched Jun Xie’s back and in a flustered panic, he could not help but yell: “Young Master Jun! You cannot.....”

Jun Wu Xie’s steps halted. She did not turn back, but only spoke in a highly icy tone.

“There is nothing here, to tell me I cannot.” Upon saying that, she walked away, without stopping in the slightest.

Qu Wen Hao fell forlornly onto the ground, every ounce of his strength drained out of him. But in the next instant, his eyes suddenly exploded with a gaze, looking highly insane and twisted!

He suddenly stood up, and charged right towards Jun Xie!

“Grand Chieftain!” Xiong Ba’s heart jumped in shock. He had never thought that Qu Wen Hao had already lost his mind to such an extent, that he would even think of attacking Jun Xie!

In the instant just as Qu Wen Hao was about to get close to Jun Xie, Jun Wu Xie suddenly lifted a leg, and executed a roundhouse kick behind, to send Qu Wen Hao flying away!

And that one kick that had been like a wild gale that passed, showed a trail of glittering blue spirit power energy, that spread as they dissipated in mid air!

Qu Wen Hao cried out as he slammed against the wall, falling limply to the ground in a heap, continuing to groan in pain.

At that moment, the entire Fiery Blaze Clan Hall fell incredibly silent, as everyone stared wide eyed in disbelief, their gazes fixed upon the seemingly still undispersed glowing blue spirit energy.....
