“City Lord... what do you mean? I don’t understand.” Though Xu Zu was feeling really anxious inside, he didn’t have the courage to voice his question in truculence.

Jun Wu Xie cast a glance on Xu Zu and said, “Just as the literal meaning.”

“...” Xu Ze became even more confused.

Qiao Chu and the others who were hiding in the back hall too, had no idea what was Jun Wu Xie planning to do. There wasn’t any bits of meat or blood of the Sea Spirit Beast left in the Sea Spirit City, and there was no way Jun Wu Xie would go and hunt for the Sea Spirit Beasts just for her to put the Upper Realm off. They had been thinking on how to fudge the issue of them not being able to supply the Sea Spirit Beasts to the Upper Realm even before Jun Wu Xie came back, but they had failed to come out with any nice solution to solve the problem. They could only wait for the return of Jun Wu Xie and let her deal with the problem.

Since Jun Wu Xie had decided to make her appearance in front of those people, they thought that Jun Wu Xie had thought of some good ideas to solve the problem, but...

Her solution was to straight up tell the people from the Long Xuan City that... the Sea Spirit City was unable to provide them the Sea Spirit Beasts?

At the moment, Qiao Chu and the rest of them didn’t seem to be confident with Jun Wu Xie’s solution. It would be fine if it was the other city that they had taken control of, but the main function of the Sea Spirit City was to provide the Sea Spirit Beasts to the Upper Realm, if the provision was discontinued all of a sudden, it was uncertain that it wouldn’t arouse the suspicion of the Upper Realm.

Wouldn’t it be too perfunctory for Jun Wu Xie to give out such a response?

While looking at each other, Qiao Chu and the others had all seen a huge puzzlement in each other’s eyes. Nonetheless, they could do nothing but just quietly wait for the sequel. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Ermm... City Lord, regarding to what you have just said... I am afraid that it isn’t really appropriate for us to report back to our City Lord. Not only the Long Xuan City and the Sea Spirit City have always been in diplomatic relations, both the cities are also near to each other. It’s been so many years but nothing bad has ever happened between the two cities, and both cities too, often take care of each other. We know that quite a lot of things have happened in the Sea of Death recently, but... since there are so many newborns, we can’t have the blood of the Sea Spirit Beast be in a shortage. If it’s allowed, could you please provide us some of it?” Putting up an ingratiating smile on his face, Xu Zu said. Ever since the Sea Spirit City was established, never once before had any cities sent their people to the Sea Spirit City to “beg” for the meat and blood of the Sea Spirit Beast.

The significance of the existence of the Sea Spirit City was to hunt for the Sea Spirit Beasts, whereas providing the creatures’ meat and blood to every city in the Upper Realm was the condition to secure the safety of the Sea Spirit City. Every successive City Lord of the Sea Spirit City would rack their brains to hunt for the Sea Spirit Beasts and used them to exchange for the amicable relationships with the other cities since with the weak strength and the small population of the Sea Spirit City, there was no way the Sea Spirit City was able to go against the enmity shown by the other cities.

Although there were the title of the seventy-two cities in the Upper Realm, the ruler of the Upper Realm had never prohibited the occurrence of warfare between the cities. If the Lord of the city had the capability, he or she could just take down the other cities and make them theirs. The ruler of the Upper Realm would actually be glad to see such things happened.

In the early time, either it was a big one or a small one, there were more than hundreds of cities in the Upper Realm with countless City Lords managing them. Later then, the relatively stronger cities had raised up and attacked neighbouring cities, dominating those cities in order to expand their territories, and after many years of disputes and battles, only then the situation was finally stabilized with the seventy-two cities existing in the Upper Realm until now.

In terms of strength, any other cities in the seventy-two cities was able to defeat the Sea Spirit City easily. The reason they let the Sea Spirit City survive was just that it would be more convenient for them to get the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast.

Once the supply of the Sea Spirit Beasts was cut off, then the reason for the existence of the Sea Spirit City and the main key for the city to survive would just vanish.

Xu Zu simply couldn’t understand what was the new City Lord of the Sea Spirit City thinking about. Did he want to set the Sea Spirit City against the other cities?
