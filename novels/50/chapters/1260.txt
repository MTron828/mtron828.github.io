Chapter 1261: “Plea for Help from Various Countries (3)”

Jun Wu Xie did not say anything more to them and just left silently.

The hearts of the group of rulers were both joyous and sorrowful.

Joyous that the Condor Country had been taken out and no one would be holding them in house arrest any further.

And sorrowful that the disaster might still not be over for them. They need to rush back to their countries immediately, to go stabilize the situation back home!

Jun Wu Xie and her companions returned back to the inn. The entire Condor Country’s Imperial Capital was a scene of peace and harmony, its people completely unaware that their His Majesty had given the land beneath their feet away, and all the more unaware that the lands under these same Heavens, would no longer have the name of the Condor Country.

“In a little while, I will take these two Imperial Edicts out, and announce them to the world.” Fei Yan said as he held the two decrees within his hands, his face lit up with joy.

The Condor Country’s human skin map, was dug out by Ye Sha from within the Condor Country’s Emperor’s Imperial Study and handed to Hua Yao for safekeeping. Away from the full eight maps that they seeked, they were only just short of the last two pieces.

Jun Wu Xie nodded. Having destroyed the Condor Country, she did not feel the slightest bit of joy. She walked over to the side of the bed, and looked at the little Emperor lying upon it.

The lethal toxins of the Scarlet Blood had already been neutralized but the Scarlet Blood still remained within the little Emperor’s body, unable to be fully eradicated. He lay upon the bed quietly, neither moving nor speaking a word, his head of fiery red hair blindingly glaring to the eyes. His scarlet coloured pair of eyes were open as he stared quietly at the ceiling of the bed, still and motionless.

Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit were plopped by the side of the bed, sticking themselves to the little Emperor, but there was still no reaction from him.

Almost the little Emperor life was saved, but the damage that the Scarlet Blood had caused could not be repaired. He was now just like a soulless puppet, without any cognitive ability to think, and no longer possessed any consciousness.

To Jun Wu Xie, being in such a state was just like the people in her past life who had gone brain dead and had turned into a vegetable.

Jun Wu Xie stared at the little Emperor’s tiny face, and pulled out a jade pendant from within her clothes. That jade pendant had been given to her by the little Emperor when they had last parted ways. She took a silver thread and looped it through the pendant, before putting it around the little Emperor’s neck. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Grand Tutor He watched quietly from the side, and could only hide his sorrow within his heart.

“I want to bring him to the Qi Kingdom.” Jun Wu Xie said suddenly.

Grand Tutor He was shocked by the sudden revelation.

“Regarding the matter of the Buckwheat Kingdom receiving the Condor Country’s lands, you can deal with it fully. I want to bring him to the Qi Kingdom as there might possibly be a way to save him.” Jun Wu Xie had suddenly thought of the Soul Calming Jade. The Soul Calming Jade had even been able to save her father who had died in battle so it might not be entirely impossible for it to be able to save the little Emperor as well.

The Soul Calming Jade was itself an artifact from the Spirit World and they were all spirit bodies inside the Spirit World. Hence, the Soul Calming Jade might just be able to help the little Emperor in some way.

The Soul Calming Jade had been split into two pieces. One was on Jun Gu’s body, and the other was placed with Jun Qing for safekeeping.

“Alright.” Grand Tutor He agreed as he quietly wiped the tears away from his eyes. If there was anyone he could still trust throughout these lands, that would only be Jun Xie.

Grand Tutor He stayed behind a little while more and he left thereafter. Qiao Chu and the others busied themselves in preparation for them to spread the news regarding the fall of the Condor Country.

“Ye Sha.”

“What instructions does Young Miss have for me?” Ye Sha replied.

“I will be bringing him back to the Qi Kingdom tomorrow. You remain here and after you have killed Elder Huang, bring his head back to the Qi Kingdom to look for me.” Jun Wu Xie ordered with her eyes narrowed. She was not going to spare Elder Huang for all that he had done.

Ye Sha seemed to want to say something, but when he saw the cold and icy profile of Jun Wu Xie’s face from the side, he quickly swallowed back the words which had been on the tip of his tongue.

“Yes! Young Miss’ wishes shall be carried out.”
