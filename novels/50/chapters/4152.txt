Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The battle of tens of thousands of troops, in Jun Wu Xie’s hands, was child’s play. For the first time, Ah Da experienced true fear.

The City Lord of Sea Spirit City was terrifying.

Zheng Weilong grabbed Ah Da’s arm as she stared unblinkingly at Jun Wu Xie’s back; a back so thin, so slender, but gave Zheng Weilong the belief that she would never fall, and the burning flames were reflected in Zheng Weilong’s eyes, tempting the fire buried deep in her heart to come out.

“Ah Da, do you know ...”

“Yes?”

“The best decision I made in my life is to cooperate with him. I have a hunch that he will change the 72 cities ... No... More accurately, he will change the entire Upper Realm!” Zheng Weilong has never felt like this before, at the very moment, she was so emotionally charged. She had found the light at the end of a very dark tunnel; no matter that person was from hell, she would even step on blood to follow that person!

When Jun Wu Xie returned to the manor, the first thing she did was to bring everyone together to deal with the upcoming matters.

The corpses of the Five City Coalition were too many, and a fire could burn them completely. Jun Wu Xie threw those scorched and incomplete corpses out, a few miles from the gates of Sea Spirit City. The burnt smell could clearly be smelt.

People who passed by Sea Spirit City soon noticed the anomaly. There were those were curious and went to find out what happened. As a result, anyone who had seen the piles of scorched bodies, couldn’t help but vomit and had diarrhea. Under the exposure to the sun, the bodies had begun to rot, it was so disgusting that people had nightmares from the sight.

The most shocking thing was that there were waist cards littered on the ground beside the rotting corpses. Although the corpses were destroyed by the fire, they could still distinguish the origins of the waist cards.

Blazing Flame City, Resolute City, Hidden Demon City, Heaven Fiend City, Epic Vesper City...

Among the top ten cities, waist cards belonging to five of those cities are left next to those corpses, there wasn’t a need to ponder, everyone knew the origin of those corpses...

The news had spread like an epidemic with the 72 cities.

Outside Sea Spirit City, with the corpses of the Five City Coalition piled up high as they were blatantly and unceremoniously discarded by Jun Wu Xie, this was obviously a great slap to the face of the Five City Coalition!

When the news reached Nangong Yan’s ears, Nangong Yan was still discussing with the Heaven Fiend City Lord on how to deal with the recent pressure from White Night City. As a result, both of them were dumbfounded.

“What did you say ?!” Nangong Yan stood up from his chair and stared at the guard who came to report.

“I have just received news that Sea Spirit City has killed all the people we have sent, and those corpses have been thrown out of Sea Spirit City, and the waist cards of our men have also been discarded alongside the bodies as well. They are announcing to everyone their deeds!” The guard said tremblingly.

Nangong Yan’s expression turned even blacker than the bottom of a burnt pot, as the lord of Heaven Fiend City turned an unhealthy shade of green. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

They simply couldn’t believe that the elite men they have sent have all been destroyed by Sea Spirit City. Just a few days ago, they received news from Nangong Lie that Sea Spirit City were aware of the current situation and had allowed them entrance into the city. He estimated that it wouldn’t be too long before they took possession of the prescription... Moreover, the news was still fresh... and yet their soldiers were all dead?!?!

“Where’s the news from? Is it true?” The Heaven Fiend City Lord asked again.
