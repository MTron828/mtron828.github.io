Chapter 3112 The Little Uncle Who“s Forced To Get Married

Jun Gu looked at his wife’s evil sense of humour but did not say anything.

Jun Mo Ye however, believed every word and looked at his grandfather with great admiration, making Jun Gu feel superhuman.

Seeing Han Zi Fei put a smile on Jun Mo Ye’s face, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao could not help but chuckle along.

Jun Mo Ye’s confusion was solved, but Jun Xian seemed to suddenly think of something, and turned to look at Jun Qing who was smiling.

“You still dare to laugh?! Your brother’s granddaughter is already so old, how about you? Jun Xian looked at his younger, less accomplished son while stroking his beard.

Due to Jun Wu Xie’s intervention, nobody in the Jun family aged. Jun Xian, despite looking only like he was in his twenties, he was much older than that.

In the midst of the family’s happiness, Jun Xian could not help but feel sorry for his youngest son. In terms of both character or looks, he was not lacking but after so many years, he remained single and could not find a suitable mate.

In the past when Jun Xian broached the topic of marriage, Jun Qing brushed it aside, saying he wanted to help Jun Wu Xie stabilize the Three Realms. Now that peace reigned over the Three Realms, that excuse no longer held water!

Seeing that his father was bringing up such an unwelcome topic, Jun Qing could no longer smile.

“Well.....” Jun QIng’s mouth remained open for a while but nothing was coming out.

Jun Xian was not going to let him off that easily and said sternly, “Enough with your excuses. If you do not find a wife in three months, I will find one for you and don’t blame me if she isn’t a ravishing beauty.”

Jun Qing looked at his father half crying and half smiling. He always got like this when Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao came home with their baby but this time he seemed resolute and there was no delaying it anymore.

But.....

Jun Qing had no views on such matters but there was one thing he knew. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Whenever he saw Jun Mo Ye, he always had the urge to have a child of his own.

However....

How do you have a child if you don’t have a wife?

Jun Xian continued to nag on and Jun Qing could only lower his head and look towards his siblings for help but they were too preoccupied with playing with Jun Mo Ye to notice his cries for help.

But Han Zi Fei noticed his predicament and said, “Little Wu Xie, if I remember correctly, Yue Ye is still your disciple right?”

Jun Wu Xie was stunned for a moment, she did not expect her mother to bring up Yue Ye.

Yue Ye had been sent back to the Lower Realms at a young age and Jun Wu Xie made her her disciple as she had shown great talent in healing poisons. However, although she was her disciple, Jun Wu Xie did not pay much attention to her and sent her to live with the Jun family to be taken care of.

Over time, Yue Ye had blossomed into a beautiful, young lady.
