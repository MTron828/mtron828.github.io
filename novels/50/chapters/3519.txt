Jun Wu Xie could never have imagined that the thing Wu Jiu was plotting would be so big, and it was not something that just the Spirit World alone could possibly stand against!

“To complete the Sacrificial Array, one hundred and eight totems is required to be established and this one hundred and eight totems will be spread out over the entire Middle Realm. When the totems are all completed and the medium for the sacrifice is done, disaster will then descend.” The Spirit Lord related with increasing helplessness. Having been held captive for so long, the composure he was showing came not from resignation of never being able to regain his freedom, but from being unable to stop the disastrous calamity.

A gasp rose up within Jun Wu Xie’s chest. This was a matter of the gravest importance.....

“In order to stop the plot, the totems must be destroyed. Your name is Jun Wu Xie right? I can help to free you from your restraints to let you leave this place. If you are able to, will you please do everything you can to destroy the Serene Spirit Towers in the Spirit World? I can’t be bothered whether there are any other totems in existence in other parts of the Middle Realm but the Serene Spirit Towers were built up due to oversight on my part. And if I am not wrong, Wu Jiu and that fake Spirit Lord must have come from the Upper Realm and their objective is to construct the totems.” The Spirit Lord said as he looked at Jun Wu Xie seriously. He had come to choose Jun Wu Xie because he could sense that Jun Wu Xie possessed a significant amount of power and from the conversation Jun Wu Xie had with Wu Jiu, he realized that Jun Wu Xie was not alone. She had her companions and they shouldn’t be too weak as well.

But Jun Wu Xie shook her head instead.

The Spirit Lord was slightly taken aback.

“You are not willing?”

Jun Wu Xie then replied: “Not that I am unwilling, but the time is not ripe.”

“Time is not ripe?” The Spirit Lord was a little confused.

Jun Wu Xie then said helplessly: “Even if you free me now and I am able to rescue my companions successfully, with the amount of power we have, we will not be able to stand against the imposter at all. You have seen it for yourself here. We were not able to stand against his might and that is why we have been imprisoned here. So even if I escape from here now, it is feared that before I am able to touch the Serene Spirit Tower, I would be recaptured by them. And being captured by them for the second time, I do not think that I will be allowed to live anymore.”

It wasn’t that Jun Wu Xie was unwilling to help, as the matter no longer only concerned the Spirit World, but was linked to the Three Realms, that included herself, and all the people that she cared about. So how could she possibly stand by and not do anything about it?

But just not now, as it was not yet the right time.

The Spirit Lord realized that he had been a little too hasty but.....

“From what you are saying, the right time might not ever come.” The Spirit Lord said with a bitter laugh. If Jun Wu Xie had another way to deal with it, why would she have fallen into her current state?

“That’s not entirely correct.” Jun Wu Xie said with a shrug of her shoulders. She was captured within the Beast Spirits’ territory this time. If it had been in another place.....

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she suddenly opened her mouth to ask the Spirit Lord.

“Back when the Dark Emperor came to the Spirit World, did you fight him then?”

The Spirit Lord did not understand why Jun Wu Xie would suddenly mention the Dark Emperor. Thinking that she was merely curious, he did not think too much of it and just replied: “I have naturally battled him.”

“Who won and lost?” Jun Wu Xie continued to ask.

The Spirit Lord didn’t know whether laugh or cry as that puerile looking little face revealed a slightly abashed and bitter smile.

“If I had won, why would the Spirit World have submitted to the Dark Emperor back then?”

“Oh.” Jun Wu Xie nodded and then went on to ask: “Lost very badly?”

“.....” The Spirit Lord then felt like he just wanted to cry. Was all this digging up of old wounds really appropriate! ?

“Very badly. Completely not his match.”

[Can you not ask anymore?] He was starting to pity himself a little
