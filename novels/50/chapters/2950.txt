Chapter 2951: Anger (5)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“This time, his appearance is so timely that we can’t just strike it off as a mere coincidence. I think he may have the support of someone big in the Sacred City before he had everything.” Bai Mo looked at Jun Wu Xie seriously. At this point, he had discovered the anomaly earlier.

But at that time, he didn’t care. Because he wasn’t clear yet, he didn’t say much.

But he never thought that ...

“My thoughts are the same as those of Bai Mo. The reason why I will go to you today is because one of the Top Ten Experts is called Qing Ke, ranked eighth among the Top Ten Experts. He is low- profile, and I don’t have a very good relationship with him. But today he came to me and asked if my relationship with you was good. He reminded me secretly that something might happen today. This is why I rushed over.” Nangong Lie frowned.

Maybe Qing Ke knew that was why he came to him.

Nangong Lie had a good relationship with Jun Wu Xie. Even if the Top Ten Experts had something against Jun Wu Xie, it was impossible for anyone to inform him.

Qing Ke’s move this time had inadvertently saved Bai Mo and Fan Zhuo’s lives. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jun Wu Xie fell into silence. In connection with her previous conversation with Jun Gu, her mind was very clear. Qiao Chu’s attack was likely to be Long Yao’s first step against her.

In the selection of the Top Ten Experts, this had happened just after changing the rules.

All these seemed extremely suspicious.

“Ye Jue.” Bai Mo suddenly looked at Jun Wu Yao from the side.

“I heard that your blood has a special ability. Those who have taken your blood will involuntarily obey your orders, right?” Bai Mo said.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Bai Mo. Although he didn’t know where he got the news, but ...

“Yes.”

“Give me a drop,” Bai Mo said loudly.

Jun Wu Yao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Bai Mo looked up at Jun Wu Yao.

“I know you won’t believe what I’m saying now. But I want to tell you that you are a bastard. That kid lying there saved my life. Although Bai Mo is not a gentleman, I don’t bother. What a mean man, if the kid wasn’t trying to save me, he wouldn’t be hurt so much. Return me my spirit energy, I’m going to take revenge. As long as I take your blood, you’re not afraid that I will turn against you! ”

The words of Bai Mo stunned Nangong Lie. He did not expect that Bai Mo would have such a thought.

This requirement was basically equivalent to selling yourself to Jun Wu Yao!

How could you stand this arrogant Bai Mo’s temper?

But looking at Bai Mo’s serious eyes, Nangong Lie didn’t believe it. But he had to believe it.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Bai Mo as if thinking about the credibility of Bai Mo’s words.

Bai Mo was not in a hurry, it ‘s just that this belief had been deeply ingrained in his heart. He had always been alone and rarely associated himself with others. It could be caused by the environment of the Upper Realm, even if it was between relatives, he had never seen such chivalry. He didn’t believe or care about it.

But I did not expect that one day, he would be rescued by a teenager.

The image when Fan Zhuo stood in front of him and threw his own life away for him was deeply embedded in him, branded into his heart. Bai Mo could not forget it no matter what.

There was only one thought in his mind – revenge!

He wanted to break those two bastards into pieces!
