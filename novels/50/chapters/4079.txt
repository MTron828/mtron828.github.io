Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie ... could not be used as measure against normal women.

Fei Yan was at his wit’s end. He could count the number of women he knew with one hand, there were only a few women around him. Even if he wanted to find someone to ask, it was difficult.

Thinking for a while, Fei Yan’s eyes drifted to the person who was accompanying Lord Meh Meh and Blood Rabbit sunbathing, Ye Jie. Having set his mind, he immediately moved to Ye Jie’s side.

Ye Jie was squatting at the edge of the flowerbed, the rotund Hell Rodent laying on her shoulder, both her hands had not been idle, each hand was either scratching the belly of Lord Meh Meh, or rubbing the ears of Blood Rabbit.

“Ye Jie.” Fei Yan said suddenly.

“Ah?” Ye Jie turned to look at Fei Yan, with a smile on her face, her eyes held some doubt.

“Master Fei Yan? Is there anything I can do to help?”

“Oh, I have something to ask you.” Fei Yan said.

“Please go ahead.” Ye Jie stood up and looked at Fei Yan cutely.

“Well ... What kind of man do women generally like?” Fei Yan said, his face flushed.

Ye Jie was stunned.

“I ... just as an example, what kind of man do you like?” Fei Yan was a little embarrassed. This topic ... was really a bit embarrassing!

Ye Jie stared at Fei Yan dumbfounded, she could not say a word.

As Fei Yan felt like he had asked the wrong person about the subject, a voice suddenly floated into Fei Yan’s ears.

“If you ask Ye Jie this sort of question, aren’t you afraid that Ye Gu will kill you?” Jun Wu Xie walked into the backyard and had just heard Fei Yan’s question, and was a little speechless.

Ye Jie and Ye Gu were members of Spirit Soul Race. The innate twin souls within one body cannot be separated in this life. With Ye Gu’s temper, he would not have allowed any opposite sex to ‘taint’ Ye Jie, otherwise ... taintin Ye Jie, was the same as tainting Ye Gu...

Ye Gu would definitely draw his sword and cut the person into eight big pieces.

Luckily, it was Fei Yan who posed the question. Had it been someone else, Ye Gu would have already rushed out to kill the person.

“...” Fei Yan was dumbfounded.

“Little Xie ...”

“Are you confused about Xiao Ruo?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Fei Yan helplessly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Fei Yan nodded as he looked at Jun Wu Xie expectantly, “Little Xie, can you help me?”

Jun Wu Xie was very straightforward ...

“No.”

“...” Fei Yan’s face looked like a frost-bitten eggplant.

“Ah!” Ye Jie suddenly whispered.

Fei Yan’s body quivered as he was afraid that Ye Gu came out to deal with him. He definitely could not beat Ye Gu!

Ye Jie looked like she suddenly realized something as she looked at the Fei Yan seriously, “Ye Jie likes men like Rong Ruo.”

“...” Fei Yan was stunned.

What Ye Jie said seemed to be answering his earlier question, but... the delay in reaction was a bit too long!

“I also like someone like Xiao Ruo.” Fei Yan muttered, but as soon as the words were spoken, he suddenly realized a problem. He looked at Ye Jie and said, “Oh, Ye Jie, although our Xiao Ruo is good, but you have to understand one thing. Xiao Ruo is a woman. Although she likes to wear men’s clothes, she is a woman, so ... you seem to like the wrong person.”

If someone else had said that instead of Ye Jie, Fei Yan felt like he could battle the other person for three hundred rounds.

But Ye Jie just looked at Fei Yan in confusion: “But Master Rong Ruo is not a woman.”
