Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Bai Mo stared at Nangong Lie, and Nangong Lie didn’t know what to do.

But Nangong Lie quickly returned to his senses and talked about the matter at hand with Jun Wu Xie. The next day would be the selection of the top ten exponents and the large number of people who had come to participate in the selection would make the entire process particularly long. Nangong Lie came here today for two reasons, one was to thank Jun Wu Xie for her life-saving grace yesterday, and the other was to tell Jun Wu Xie a clever way to pass the trial.

“This year’s numbers are more than in previous years. The trial of the top ten exponents is nothing but gauntlet where the better exponents win and the losers retreat. The winner will stay in the fighting ring until he is defeated. So if you want to participate in the trials, you don’t need to participate in the first few days of the competition. Anyone who is worth their salt will only start in the later few days. They will not be willing to waste too much energy in front of all the unimportant opponents. ” Nangong Lie spoke of his experience to Jun Wu Xie without reservation.

Each trial would cause a large number of deaths and injuries, and the better fighters would result in more intense battles that would pit “two tigers” against each other.

Jun Wu Xie’s power was very great, but there was no need to waste it. In fact, even Nangong Lie couldn’t understand why His Lord would let Jun Wu Xie participate in the trials. After all, with Jun Wu Xie’s strength, even if today’s top ten exponents joined forces, they were not necessarily her opponents.

If that was the case, would it not be an unnecessary move?

Jun Wu Xie quietly listened, there was not much nervousness regarding this trial.

It was Bai Mo, on the side, quietly absorbing the information that Nangong Lie was providing.

“I heard that this time the trial is hosted by a Knight of Destruction?” Jun Wu Xie asked calmly.

Nangong Lie nodded, “I was just about to tell you about it.”

“Do you already know which Knight of Destruction?” Jun Wu Xie said.

Nangong Lie said, “I received news this morning that the host for this trial is Lord Long Yao.”

“Long Yao?” Jun Wu Xie’s brow lightly frowned. Although Jun Gu was one of the Knights of Destruction, he had not been fully brainwashed and rarely contacted other people in the Upper Realm as he had only entered the Upper Realm for a short time. He knew nothing about the other three Knights of Destruction.

“It’s him?!” Bai Mo, who was beside him, exclaimed surprisedly, immediately attracting the attention of Nangong Lie and Jun Wu Xie.

“You know him?” Nangong Lie looked at Bai Mo with some doubts, truthfully, there was some friction between him and Bai Mo because of yesterday’s events, but these things were common in the Upper Realm. Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were seated at the same table and sharing the conversation, nothing was impossible.

Bai Mo glanced at Nangong Lie, an arrogant and contemptuous aura suddenly appeared on his tender bun-like face, but ... before his proud smile could fully bloomed, his head was suddenly hit!

“Play nicely.” Jun Wu Yao held a pair of chopsticks in one hand, while the other hand that had just taught his “son” a lesson calmly rested on the table.

The force of the slap caused Bai Mo’s chubby face to wince in pain, causing tears to well up in his eyes, and then the arrogance which had vaguely become visible, disappeared in an instant ...

Nangong Lie swallowed his saliva and looked at the person who was crying from one flick of Jun Wu Yao’s hand, and felt a surge in his heart ...UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
