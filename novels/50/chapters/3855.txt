Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Half of the bodies of Qiao Chu and the others were already buried in the flowers and because of the act of Jun Wu Yao blowing away the flowers, although the flowers around him and Jun Wu Xie were blown away, it had caused Qiao Chu and the rest to be buried more deeply into the surrounding flowers. And now, the layers of the flowers in front of them were almost up to their chests. Every single one of them looked at Jun Wu Yao’s act with their eyes wide opened. It became really hard for them to even move a step forward.

Jun Wu Xie stared at Jun Wu Yao for a very long time to the extent that Jun Wu Yao began to question himself if there was really anything that had happened to his body. Jun Wu Xie then asked gravely. “You’re not injured and also not poisoned. Does the life and death worm have any negative effect on you?”

“No.” Jun Wu Yao wasn’t sure why would Jun Wu Xie ask such question but he could only answer honestly. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

There wouldn’t be any abnormality shown before the activation of the life and death worm except that the suppression towards his power would still keep going. Other than that, nothing would happen.

“If there’s no effect, why is your memory degrading?” Jun Wu Xie spoke seriously.

Jun Wu Yao slightly stunned.

Memory degrading?

“There’s no such thing.” Jun Wu Yao had never felt that there was any problem with his memory.

“If so, how would you forget that we have had an engagement?” Jun Wu Xie looked so confused but she truly did not find any problems after checking on Jun Wu Yao’s pulse.

Once Jun Wu Xie voiced her question, Ye Sha and the others who were hiding in the dark nearly spat their blood out!

“I have not forgotten.” Jun Wu Yao too, went blank for quite some time.

“Then why are you asking me to marry you?” Innocently, Jun Wu Xie asked.

“...” Jun Wu Yao’s face turned into a weird expression at the moment.

Whereas, both Ye Sha and Ye Mei who were hiding in the dark straight off knocked their heads onto the wall behind them.

How were they so naive to think that such things like proposing which normal people liked to do would suit their Young Miss?

“You and I have already gotten engaged in front of grandfather beforehand. Don’t you remember?” Jun Wu Xie hadn’t noticed any unusualness. Instead, she lifted her hand up and covered it on Jun Wu Yao’s forehead, seemingly to be a bit worried.

“...” The smile on Jun Wu Yao’s face completely disappeared.

He had finally understood what was the point that had gotten Jun Wu Xie to be tangled in. He let in a deep breath and stood up all of a sudden. There were petals on his plain white clothes and his handsome face was holding on an expression with a trail of wry.

“Little Xie.” Looking at Jun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Yao said.

“Hmm?” Jun Wu Xie stared at him.

“Man should be the one to propose. So, the thing you said before is invalid,” said Jun Wu Yao seriously.

Jun Wu Xie stunned.

On the contrary, Qiao Chu and the others who were standing behind Jun Wu Xie were so close from fainting.

How was it that the man should be the one to propose?!

But before they could even mention the common sense mistake made by Jun Wu Yao, Jun Wu Xie suddenly came to an enlightenment and asked. “Is that so? Then is it necessary for me to inform grandfather?”

She responded with such a genuine expression. Obviously, she had totally believed in the words of Jun Wu Yao!

Jun Wu Yao then replied with a smile on his face. “There’s no need for you to worry about. I’ve asked the Night Regime to prepare the betrothal gifts. All you need to do is to wait for me to marry you.” Jun Wu Yao lifted his hand up and rubbed gently on Jun Wu Xie’s small little head. Although there were some twists and turns during the process, it was still a nice outcome.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head meekly. She knew nothing about all the things about marriage, what Jun Wu Yao said might be right.

While watching the couple speaking nonsense with zero common sense with a straight face, Qiao Chu and the rest of them almost rolled their eyes over.

Please!!

You guys had just gotten engaged in front of Grandfather Jun, what was the point for both of you to beat around the bush!!
