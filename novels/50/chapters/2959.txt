Chapter 2960: Come Out and Die! (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In the entire arena, Long Yao was the only person who saw what Jun Wu Xie did. But he never imagined that she would make a beeline straight to him!

Long Yao was shocked, could it be that Jun Wu Xie was so filled with hate that she would strike directly at him?

Just as Long Yao raised his spiritual power to prepare, Jun Wu XIe bypassed him completely and made her way into the back room!

There was a loud sound and the door of the back room was kicked open by Jun Wu Xie. The force propelled Bai Zhu, who had been hiding behind the door, into the air and he fell heavily on the hard floor.

Bai Zhu had no idea what was going on, he only felt a massive pain in his head, aches all over his body and his vision went blurry.

However, the other people in the room saw everything as clear as crystal.

Jun Wu Xie stood at the doorway, the iciness from her demeanour felt like it could freeze the blood in their veins!

Ordinarily, if one of these arrogant and haughty Top Ten exponents saw Jun Wu Xie come close to them, their blood would almost pump in a reverse direction. When Jun Wu XIe moved that quickly, none of them could see it clearly and none could imagine the consequences if they were to face her in battle.

“Yan Hai! What do you think you are doing?” Long Yao asked as he got over his shock and got out of his chair to look at the scene behind him.

Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes swept across the room and walked forward slowly.

Everyone in the room was shocked and motionless. Only Bai Zhu who had fallen to the floor was still trying to restore his sight.

Long Yao’s expression took a turn for the worse, since he had become a Knight of Destruction, he had probably not been ignored like this!

“Yan Hai! Don’t tell me you’re going to violate the rules of the selection? Don’t you have any respect for the wishes of His Lord?”

Jun Wu Xie paused, gave a slight smile and replied calmly, “I know the rules, don’t worry. I don’t intend to break them, but before that....”

Jun Wu Xie’s voice suddenly became light. She raised a finger and a beam of light shot out and landed on Bai Zhu. The beam of light wrapped itself around Bai Zhu’s leg and with a simple gesture, Bai Zhu ended up at Jun Wu Xie’s feet.

“His Lord’s rules state that outside of the selection, one cannot challenge the Top Ten Exponents. But for someone that is not a Top Ten Exponent, I should be able to do as I wish with him right?” Jun Wu Xie asked although it was more of a statement of fact.

Long Yao stared at Jun Wu Xie, for the first time, he realised that he could not predict the actions of the youth standing in front of him. This, plus the murderous intent he was witnessing, sent a shiver down his spine.

Bai Zhu was so terrified his legs had turned to rubber. He had never expected that the first one to suffer ruin was him! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Lord....Lord Yan, we can talk this over....” Bai Zhu was lifted up by Jun Wu Xie with no resistance. The anger emanating from Jun Wu Xie made it difficult for Bai Zhu to breathe and the fear of death was clearly written on his face.
