Jun Wu Xie’s gaze turned slightly cold as a glint flashed by her eyes.

Ruan Zhongshan could no longer endure it any further!

“Ruan Zhongshan, don’t you think your manner of talking is too arrogant? Don’t you think your appetite is too big? Since when did you have the right to want the things that belong to Sea Spirit City?” Jun Wu Xie coldly retorted.

Ruan Zhongshan leaned back and tilted his chin up and scoffed: “Whether or not my appetite is big, you will know soon. Hmph, Yan Hai, I see that you are young and ignorant that’s why I gave you a way out. Did you think that after you have the elixir, you would be invincible in the world? Your little Sea Spirit City can’t withstand the glory of your treasure. I advise you to know the current affairs and honestly give me the formula and obediently provide the Sea Spirit Beasts and I may still leave you a way to live, but if you don’t know how to act, then don’t blame me for being rude! Your tiny Sea Spirit City is just but a mere speck, it can’t even be placed in my eyes!”

“I won’t give you anything, but I would like to see how rude you would be.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Ruan Zhongshan coldly as her eyes narrowed slightly.

Ruan Zhongshan sneered condescendingly at Jun Wu Xie and said with a mirth, “You can give it a try, can you handle my Long Xuan City’s pressure? Little brat, don’t think that just by being the City Lord of Sea Spirit City, everything would be easy. Sea Spirit City is a fart in eyes of the 72 cities! If not for needing your group of waste to provide Sea Spirit Beasts, did you really think that you can keep such a broken place? ”

“Let me tell you! I am here for the formula in your hand, you have to give it whether or not you want to! My 20,000 strong army of Long Xuan City is a mile away from your Sea Spirit City! If you don’t be obedient and hand the formula to me, do you believe that I will let the three words ‘Sea Spirit City’ disappear forever in the Upper Realm tomorrow?! ”

Ruan Zhongshan thoroughly revealed his plan in front of Jun Wu Xie. Everything happened as her expectations.

Under Ruan Zhongshan’s show of his oppressive might, Jun Wu Xie remained unmoved. She looked coldly at Ruan Zhongshan who threatened her and replied lightly, “I don’t believe.”

Ruan Zhongshan’s eyes narrowed slightly. Jun Wu Xie was definitely the toughest nut he had ever encountered. Be it either a hard or soft approach, none worked. Despite revealing about the army to pressure her into aceeding to his request in desperation, but now it seems that things did not head in the direction he had expected. Looking at Jun Wu Xie’s cold and proud appearance, she had not been affected by it at all!

“Let’s wait and see.” Ruan Zhongshan stood up indignantly, and Xu Zu and others aside stood up one after another.

When he saw Ye Sha step forward, Ruan Zhongshan sneered, “Why? You still want to detain me, with just this bunch of garbage here? Do you think you have the abilities?”

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand at this moment to stop Ye Sha.

“Let him go, I’d like to see if it’s my Sea Spirit City or Long Xuan City that disappears from the Upper Realm.”

Ye Sha stepped back silently when he heard this.

Ruan Zhongshan’s face was a little displeased, Jun Wu Xie’s arrogance had already exceeded his expectations.

“Let’s go!” Ruan Zhongshan flourished his sleeves angrily and left with his men.

After Ruan Zhongshan left, Jun Wu Xie still sat motionless in her chair, as if nothing had happened.

After a short while, Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes slightly and looked at Ye Sha at the side: “Left already?”

The words were strange, it seemed as if they were talking about Ruan Zhongshan, yet it also sounded as if they were talking about someone else.

Ye Sha nodded and said, “Yes, there’s no one left.”

A sneer flashed at the bottom of her eyes.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
