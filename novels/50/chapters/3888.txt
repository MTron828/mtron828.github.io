Gu Ying’s words made the faces of people outside the palace to change greatly. They looked at Gu Ying in incredulity as they could not believe what they had just heard.

Defeated?

How was that possible?

Disregard the five hundred thousand Gold Spirits that they brought with them, but the strength of Luo Qingcheng, plus Wei Ya and Xie Changming, who would be their worthy adversaries in the Lower Realm? They were so powerful, how could they be defeated?

“Huh? Are you sure?” The voice floated out from within the palace and held a hint of laughter. With regard to the judgement of Gu Ying, there was no anger and dissatisfaction, as if listening to an unrelated thing.

“I am not sure about it, at least so far, I have never seen anyone defeat Jun Wu Xie. No matter how many times her opponent is stronger than her, she always has a way to turn the tide to her favour. This time she deliberately used the Soul Bone to bait Luo Qingcheng to come to the Lower Realm. They must have done thorough preparations for the battle. There has been no news of Luo Qingcheng and the others, so they must have been defeated by Jun Wu Xie.” Gu Ying spoke sincerely, these words might be horrible to others, but in his heart, he had already confirmed as such.

“That Jun Wu Xie, is she as powerful as you say she is?” The person within the palace asked once again.

“If she is not powerful, how could she have attracted the attention of Ye Jue. And how could she have escape from Luo Qingcheng five years ago?” Gu Ying asked instead of answering, as his gaze fell upon Nangong Lie who was kneeling aside silently.

“I think, apart from me, Nangong Lie should be the most clear about the strength and methods of Jun Wu Xie.”

Having been pointed out by Gu ying, Nangong Lie’s body subconsciously trembled a little, as if in that moment, the scene of massacre of the Nine Temples floated into his mind, and his hand which was pressed against the floor began to tremble uncontrollably.

Gu Ying let out a slight laugh, as he took in the sorry figure of Nagong Lie, disdain flashed across his eyes.

This person was completely terrified of Jun Wu Xie. Unfortunately, in this lifetime, he would no longer have any courage to face Jun Wu Xie on the battlefield ever again.

“Nangong Lie, speak.” the person within the palace ordered. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Nangong Lie’s body was extremely stiff, and he could only answer with trepidation, “Lord Gu Ying’s words are not false. Jun Wu Xie is really exceptional. In the Middle Realm, everything was going smoothly for us, but her sudden attack caught us off guard, and caused a chain reaction... it’s hard to prevent...”

As Nangong Lie said these words, his heart was already filled with fear. He didn’t want to fight with such a person any more. It wasn’t that he wasn’t willing, but he just couldn’t... Even hearing those three words, Jun Wu Xie, filled him with such terror, what more to fight her.

There was silence in the palace, but few people outside the palace were frightened. That day when they heard from Nangong Lie, they did not bother too much as they felt that Nangong Lie was exaggerating in order to escape blame. However, they didn’t think that it was actually true.

They were still unwilling to believe, but Luo Qingcheng and the others have disappeared for too long, long enough to have caused them unease.

“Forget it, let’s just wait and see.” The voice from within the palace sounded once again although it did not contain a hint of urgency or nervousness. It was as if the person didn’t care about the potential failure of Luo Qingcheng.

“Yes.” Gu Ying was not surprised by the other’s reaction. He did what he had to do and retreated to a dark corner.

In the shadows, the eyes of Gu Ying sparkled with strange brilliance.

Having been apart for some years, he didn’t know when they met again, how would they face each other?

He could not wait.....
