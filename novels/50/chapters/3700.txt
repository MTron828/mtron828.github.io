Jun Wu Xie turned around and lifted her right hand up, and the Spirit Ring that was kept away had once again appeared and was was floating above her palm. Her eyes were cold and there was not the least bit of sentiment in them.

Qiao Chu grasped her hand tightly, refusing to budge as he straightened his upper body and cried out, “If you want to kill then go ahead and kill! I won’t let go!”

Su Jing Yan and others at the side had long been scared witless by Jun Wu Xie’s actions. Su Jing Yan knew Jun Wu Xie from before and he had already understood clearly that the Jun Wu Xie of the past was completely different after five years had passed. Her heart had already been frozen like a glacier.

A touch of killing intent flashed by Jun Wu Xie’s eyes as she swiftly brought that hand down!

Everyone’s heart almost jumped out at that moment!

However, there was no change in Qiao Chu’s expression.

Jun Wu Xie’s hand stopped just half an inch away from Qiao Chu’s head and did not move.

Qiao Chu looked at Jun Wu Xie with unwavering eyes.

Jun Wu Xie’s brow wrinkled as she looked at the stubborn Qiao Chu that had the knack to always make one exasperated before she finally lowered her hand.

“I still have things to deal with, I can’t go back with you all.” This was the only sentence she said upon meeting with her companions after so long.

Although her words were an understatement and was spoken coldly but it made a brilliant smile appear on Qiao Chu’s face.

“What do you want to deal with? We will accompany you!”

It was clear that he still refused to let go.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes but did not say a word.

“Little Xie, do you hate us? Are you still blaming us that we didn’t manage to reach you in time then?” Qiao Chu asked pitifully.

Jun Wu Xie remained silent and indifferent.

Hate?

Why would she hate them?

What she hated was the arrogant Upper Realm and.... her weak and incompetent self.

When Qiao Chu saw that although he had tried all means to persuade her, yet he couldn’t move her at all. He felt a piercing pain in his heart, afterall, having been together with her for so many years, how could he not notice her change? The heart that took so long to warm up had now turned thoroughly cold.

He turned to look helplessly at Hua Yao who was standing at the city gates. Hua Yao immediately made a sign and Qiao Chu’s eyes lit up in an instant as he quietly summoned the Yin Yang Bear out. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The huge Yin Yang Bear was like a tall wall that had suddenly appeared in front of Jun Wu Xie. Before she could react, the Yin Yang Bear suddenly opened its arms and with its furry paws, it immediately embraced her in its arms, as it comforted her as it snuggled closer with its soft and furry belly.

The warm embrace, the familiar smell, was like the last thing that crushed all her defenses. Jun Wu Xie had been forcibly maintaining a strong front for five years, toughening her heart but at this moment, it melted a little and in a blink of an eye, she felt as if she had returned to five years ago. She had returned to the time when all was good and the nightmare had yet to appear.

“Little Xie, Rolly misses you so much, why... why don’t you go back with us? If you don’t go back with us... we... we will not leave as well! Wherever you go, we’ll follow you wherever. It’s just right as well, since we haven’t been to the Dark Regions yet, why don’t you bring us along for visit?” When Qiao Chu saw Rolly holding Jun Wu Xie in its arms, and she had not resisted, he let out a sigh of relief. He stood up and walked to her side as he continued to coax and persuade her with sweet talk.

Jun Wu Xie did not say anything. She just stood in a daze as she let the Yin Yang Bear continue holding her in its embrace. No one knew what was on her mind but the surrounding chilly atmosphere that was lingering around had dissipated by quite a bit.
