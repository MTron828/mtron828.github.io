Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Though before this, Jun Xian had been sceptical about the way Jun Wu Yao deal with everything, but for now, all his doubts had just dissipated. According to Jun Wu Yao’s personality, it was certain that Jun Wu Yao was not one to speak any lie. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“It was really a difficult time for you and Little Xie these five years. Since you have returned now, I wish the best for both of you, do you understand what I mean?” While looking at Jun Wu Yao, Jun Xian said in all earnestness. The moment of him speaking those words showed that he wasn’t the decisive and domineering Duke Lin anymore but just a grandfather who was caring for his granddaughter.

Jun Wu Yao looked astonishingly at Jun Xian. Jun Xian’s words sounded very intriguing but the meaning implied gave Jun Wu Yao thrills.

Jun Wu Yao had never paid his attention to anyone’s judgement towards him and had always scorned to care about any criticism that was being thrown at him, but Jun Xian was different from the others as he was Jun Wu Xie’s grandfather. How could he not know that Jun Wu Xie valued her family very much?

It was obvious that the relationship between both of them had already gotten the acquiescence of Jun Xian just by listening to the words he said today.

“Please do not worry. I will definitely take good care of her.” A genuine smile bloomed at the corners of Jun Wu Yao’s lips with his heart filled with an indescribable contentment at this moment.

Jun Xian then nodded his head with satisfaction.

“Since you are just back, I think you will feel quite tired. Go and have a good rest.”

“Thanks.” Even though he was far more older than Jun Xian in terms of age, this was the first time Jun Wu Yao talked with a person as a youngster.

This subtle change was all because of Jun Wu Xie.

After noticing that Jun Xian had finished his conversation with Jun Wu Yao, only then the curiosity that was long suppressed within Qiao Chu and the others erupted. Everyone pushed over each other, trying to ask Jun Wu Yao questions.

“Big Brother Wu Yao, how have you been for the past five years?”

“Big Big Brother Wu Yao, Big Brother Ye Mei said that it was you and Little Xie that had teamed up to give the Upper Realm an utter rout. What’s going on?”

“Big Brother Wu Yao...”

The bunch of questions was like gunfire kept on shooting at Jun Wu Yao. If it was any other people who were as talkative as them, Jun Wu Yao would have choked them to death on the spot. But since Qiao Chu and the rest of them had the label of “The Partners of Jun Wu Xie” attached to them plus Jun Wu Yao’s love for Jun Wu Xie had far gone beyond the normal range, the way he treated the people she cared was therefore different from the way he normally faced the others.

With patience, Jun Wu Xie answered their questions one by one.

For him, the past five years were just about the time of him snapping his finger. Although he was imprisoned by the Upper Realm, they didn’t torture him but just keep a close watch upon him, not allowing him leave even half a step from the place. Except for the torment of missing his loved one, Jun Wu Yao did not experience any discomfort.

He then went around and told them about him ruling the Ghost City in the Lower Realm.

Since the reversal array was activated, this matter was no longer a secret anymore.

“The reversal array was set up all over the Lower Realm?” Qiao Chu looked at Jun Wu Yao in disbelief with his eyes widened. He thought that the array was prepared only for the battle this time but they were being told by Jun Wu Yao that the whole reversal array was set up in all the grounds of the Lower Realm. Once it was activated, the entire Lower Realm would be enshrouded in the reversal array. Not to mention the people from the Upper Realm that had come to the Lower Realm for this battle, no matter any expert from the Upper Realm stepped onto the ground of the Lower Realm, they would never get rid of the effect on them which was caused by the reversal array.

Just as the words said, even if it was a dragon, it must be coiled and even if it was a tiger, it must be laid down!

If it wasn’t for them witnessing everything, Qiao Chu and the rest wouldn’t believe that Jun Wu Yao had actually prepared such an enormous card in the Lower Realm!
