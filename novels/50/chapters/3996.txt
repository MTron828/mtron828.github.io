Jun Wu Yao gave out a light laugh. He raised his hand and there was a tiny little black snake coiling around his long finger. Followed by a flick from his finger, swoosh, the black snake flew towards Meng Qiu. When it landed on Meng Qiu’s body, it perforated swiftly into Meng Qiu’s soul.

“That’s not up to him,” said Jun Wu Yao flatly.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao. Even though Jun Wu Yao didn’t say anything, she had still understood his intention in making such an action.

The black snake was formed from the dark spirit of Jun Wu Yao, which it was able to control one’s mind and behaviour. Jun Wu Yao had once used this little thing during that time when he was lurking in the Lin Palace. But after the relationship between him and Jun Wu Xie got intimately closer, he had then kept the black snakes that he put on all the people in the Lin Palace back.

The black snake would not take Meng Qiu’s life but it will force him to move according to Jun Wu Yao’s instructions.

“Let him go,” ordered Jun Wu Yao.

Blood Velvet let his hands go. Standing wobbly, Meng Qiu glared furiously at Jun Wu Yao with a raging gaze inside his eyes. However, he could no longer control his body anymore. He kneeled on one of his knees in front of Jun Wu Yao with an obeisance expression on his face as he began to speak something that was against his thoughts.

“Meng Qiu is here to give Lord Jue my service.”

When these words came out of his mouth, Meng Qiu’s mind was still remaining conscious, but it wasn’t able to control his every word and action anymore. It was as if he was being locked into a marionette, Jun Wu Yao would just need to move his fingers and he was then able to control him.

The feeling of his entire soul being grasped in Jun Wu Yao’s hand almost made Meng Qiu crack up.

Under Jun Wu Yao’s control, Meng Qiu brought Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao to the place where the Spirit Tree was planted at. Along their way, they had met quite a lot of black armored spirit envoys and all their faces went pale when they saw Jun Wu Yao. If it wasn’t for Meng Qiu who was walking in the front, holding onto a normal face, they probably would have already gotten panic and ran away.

The fear that Jun Wu Yao once brought to the Soul World was still there. Before those black armored spirit envoys get to figure out the reason of Jun Wu Yao coming to the Soul World, they saw them passing by with Meng Qiu leading in the front. After the terror inside them subsided, they couldn’t help but feel a great admiration towards Meng Qiu who was powerful enough to get along with Jun Wu Yao.

However, what they didn’t know was that it was actually verging on the break down inside Meng Qiu at the moment.

How he wished he could ask for help from all the black armored spirit envoys, but unfortunately, his entire soul had already been controlled by the black snake, preventing him from doing what he wanted to do.

That was the first time Jun Wu Xie saw the Spirit Tree. It was huge and magnificent.

With just a glance and nearly all her sight had been occupied by the huge and beautiful Spirit Tree. Just step a little closer to it and she could feel that it was as if her soul was bathing in the warm spring water- it was so comfortable.

“This is the Spirit Tree?” Jun Wu Xie lifted her head and looked at the quiet and gorgeous tree. The dense leaves were overlapping each other, glowing with faint halo. Even under the sunlight, there seemed to be stars hidden between the pieces of leaves. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Jun Wu Yao nodded. Soundlessly, he slightly moved his finger. Meng Qiu who was standing aside immediately turned around. Facing those black armored spirit envoys who were guarding beside the Spirit Tree, he placed his order, “This is none of your business. Leave.”

Those black armored spirit envoys had earlier been scared out of their wits due to the appearance of Jun Wu Yao, hoping that they could leave as early as possible. One after another, they quickly nodded their heads.

“Remember to bring Long Jiu and Qin Song who are being locked up in the Soul Prison here.” It was plain solemnity on Meng Qiu’s face, and of course the black armored spirit envoys wouldn’t doubt him. After receiving the order, they left.

After all the black armored spirit envoys had gone, Jun Wu Xie straight off called Blood Velvet and Poison Ivy out.
