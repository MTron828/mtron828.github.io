“.....” Nalan Shan’s eyes were wide as he stared, looking in disbelief at the Soul Binding Chains that had been opened so easily, incredulity filling up in his eyes.

Just like that..... unlocked

“Can you still move?” Jun Wu Xie’s attention was not on Nalan Shan’s surprise, her gaze fixed upon the battlefield.

“Sure! Wu Xie..... Thank you.....” Nalan Shan said, highly excited.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at the Soul Binding Chains that had fallen, and the corners of her mouth curled up with a playful smile.

“No need to thank me. Lockpicking was taught to me by someone else and if you want to thank, then thank that imbecile called Shen Yan Xiao.” Upon saying that, the figure of Jun Wu Xie flashed and she had charged straight into the battlefield.

Nalan Shan did not even have the time to think who Shen Yan Xiao was as when he saw the intense battle, his gaze had immediately turned towards Wu Jiu who had a gleeful smile upon his face. With a leap, he lunged suddenly towards Wu Jiu!

“Wu Jiu!” Nalan Shan called out in a loud shout!

Wu Jiu lifted an eyebrow as he looked at Nalan Shan who had come charging right before him and he laughed lightly indifferently.

“What? You want revenge?”

Nalan Shan’s fists were tightly clenched as he said through gritted teeth: “I am going to clean up the sect on Master’s behalf today!”

“You think you can do it! ? You do not have it in you! Nalan Shan, I’ll advise you to know your place. You have never been my match, and if you obediently submit yourself to me, I can forget things in the past. But if you insist on seeking death, I shall then grant you your wish!” Wu Jiu said with a sneering laugh.

“Save your nonsense! Between you and me today, only one will live!” Nalan Shan was no longer willing to hear Wu Jiu spout his nonsense, and he leapt straight at Wu Jiu in a lunge.

Wu Jiu sneered and parried Nalan Shan’s attack, once fellow disciples, but now fallen to such a stage that they were fighting to the death.

The entire battlefield was one big mess of chaos, and there were no longer any so called spectators around them.

The battle royale of the three races, reached an intensity never seen before.

The human spirits and Weapon Spirits won out by a notch with their superior numbers, driving the Beast Spirits back step by step, but the Beast Spirits were steadfast in holding their line, defending with their lives to keep the enemies out of the Spiritual Bear’s perimeter of safety, refusing to budge another single step!

With mournful wails, Beast Spirits turned into puffs of green smoke one after another, disappearing without leaving a trace behind. Their comrades did not even have time to mourn or feel sorrowful about their disappearance as they were being overwhelmed by the endless waves of enemies that engulfed them.

Brownie gave out a roar of unease, as t saw with its own eyes its fellow beasts disappearing into nothing in order to defend it, its heart growing extremely anxious.

Disappearing.....

That’s right, spirits did not die, but they disappeared.

From the moment when their flesh bodies died, they turned into spirits where they either reincarnated and were reborn, or they came to the Spirit World and continued to live in spirit state.

But the moment that their spirits scattered and dispersed, their existence were then completely erased.

Without a drop of blood, without leaving behind a corpse, as they leave the world they were so familiar with, never to appear ever again.

Disappear, a word that was more frightening than death.

When they disappear, it meant that they would bid goodbye to everything in this world forever!

“Let me go! I can kill them!” Brownie had wanted to break free from the cheetah and the others who were holding him back, but they had dug their claws in to stop him, refusing to budge.

“You cannot go!”

“Why not? My fellow beasts are shedding their blood for me! Am I supposed to just hide behind them like a turtle with its head inside its shell and live ignobly? I refuse to!” Brownie roared in rage.

The cheetah held on to Brownie’s leg and said almost pleadingly.

“You cannot go. If we are to witness with our own eyes having lost you, it would be a fate worse than death for us. Their sacrifice is for the sake of ensuring your safety so do not let their sacrifice become a joke!”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
