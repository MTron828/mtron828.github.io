Looking at the mess in the room, Jun Wu Xie had no panic at all. Instead, she moved two steps back, allowing the night breeze that blew across the yard swept off the bloody smell that was coming straight at her.

Within minutes, there came a flurry of footsteps hurrying over here!

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and flattened out the drapes on the end-ridge of her clothes. She then turned around and looked at the entrance of the yard.

Yan Wan who hadn’t showed himself up before this had now arrived hastily with a mansion of guests behind him. Old He too, was following beside him in a hurried pace.

“What’s going on?!” The moment Yan Wan entered the yard, he frowned and berated.

Once the bunch of guests who were following behind Yan Wan stepped into the yard, they immediately smelled a dense odour of blood, and almost every single one of their hearts gave out a shudder!

After everyone got to see clearly at the view of the yard, they were all dumbfounded...

There was only Jun Wu Xie standing alone under the moonlight in the quiescent yard, but behind her inside the wide opened door, it was a totally different sanguinary picture!

Liang Shi Shi, face colourless, was lying naked in a pool of blood. There were bruises all over her dead body, showing clearly that she had been suffering some kind of inhuman torment before she died. Her pair of eyes had already lost the gleam that she once had, they were dim and dull.

At the very first instant, everyone came to a realization that something horrible had happened!

Old He quickly went into the room and checked on Liang Shi Shi’s breathing. At the end, he announced with a mournful expression, “Master... The Mistress...She is gone...”

Old He’s words had made everyone at the scene to suck in a cold breath.

Liang Shi Shi was dead!

Just at the night when Yan Wan held a birthday feast for her, she died in her own room, with such a wretched and pitiful way...

Even if they did not dare to have a closer look at the death situation of Liang Shi Shi, they could already guess it with just only a glimpse. Liang Shi Shi might have lost her chastity before she was murdered!

There was actually someone in the Sea Spirit City who had the god damn nerves to do such an audacious thing in the official residence.This was just unbelievable!

At the moment, almost everyone had gotten their eyes fixed on Yan Hai, the only person who was standing in the yard.

Before they arrived, he was the only one here, and also, they knew that before this, Old He had asked him to go and convince Liang Shi Shi so that he would attend the banquet, but after leaving for quite a long time, there was still no sign of Yan Hai coming back. It was until when they heard the scream, that everyone’s soul was then awakened by the great shock!

Could it be that...

This was really done by Yan Hai?

Had he gone crazy?

Even if he and Yan Wan disliked each other very much, there was still no need for him to go so far and do such a rebellious thing in the official residence at this time!

Everyone was thunderstruck by everything that had happened in front of their eyes. They couldn’t believe what they saw at all.

“You this unfilial son! How could you do such insane thing!” Eyes widening, Yan Wan glared at Jun Wu Xie who was standing outside the room of his wife with both his eyes suddenly full of blood, and it seemed like the blood almost dripped out from his eyes.

Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes glanced over those group of people who had come over in truculence. After she soundlessly gave a reassuring look to Jun Wu Yao and Qiao Chu them who had come together with the crowd, she then locked her eyes onto Yan Wan.

From the very beginning, everything that had happened tonight was a trap designed by Yan Wan to set her up. Yan Wan knew that he would definitely not be able to kill Yan Hai personally if there wasn’t any deadly mistakes done by him, and thus, the purpose of holding the birthday feast today was to force the appearance of Yan Hai, leading the moguls in the Sea Spirit City to witness his “crime” in order to bring him a verdict of guilty, giving Yan Wan the reasons to kill him!
