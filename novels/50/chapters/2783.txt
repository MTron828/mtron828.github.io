“This kid is the Lord of the Sea Spirit City, Yan Hai?”

The boy in front of him looked very petite. He didn’t look like a powerful opponent. Many generals did nott understand why the 72 City Lords were so afraid of Jun Wu Xie that they sent out such a huge alliance army to attack Sea Spirit City.

In their opinion, those in front of them were just harmless kids. They needed no effort to fight him .

“Yan Hai, are you here to surrender?” Many generals couldn’t help laughing when they saw Jun Wu Xie come out of the city alone. How could a small Sea Spirit City be their opponent of two million troops? Jun Wu Xie appeared alone at this time. What else could he do besides surrender?

“If it’s surrender, I’m afraid it’s too late. Our lord of the city has given an order. Today, you will burn your own Sea Spirit City to the ground. You can only blame yourself for dying and offending all the lords of the cities. No God can save you. ”

The harsh words echoed from the army far and wide. They were not in a hurry. In their eyes, Sea Spirit City was already a dead city. There was nothing they could do.

Qiao Chu and others standing on the city wall saw the arrogance of the armies of the 72 cities.

Qiao Chu rolled his sleeves several times and tried to rush down, but was stopped by Hua Yao.

“Brother Hua! Why are you stopping me? You should let me go down and I will break the heads of those assholes!” Qiao Chu said angrily.

Hua Yao shook his head slightly and calmly, “Look.”

“What do you want me to see?” Qiao Chu wondered. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Hua Yao’s eyes fell on Jun Wu Xie who was outside the city gate. Facing the ridicule of the army of 72 cities, Jun Wu Xie remained calm. There was no anger or shame in her cold eyes. She looked across at the millions of troops in front of her calmly.

That calmness could never be a facade.

“Little Xie must have her plan. Since she hasn’t let us out of the city, we can’t go out of the city as we wished as it might ruin her plan.” Hua Yao said coldly. All that Jun Wu Xie had done was for a motive.

That was to attract the attention of the Lord, and thus have the opportunity to find Jun Gu. But the 72 cities were so insignificant to him. He will not even bother to ask a question. Jun Wu Xie wanted to make use of the Sea Spirit City as a base to do something earth-shattering that draws the attention of the Lord. This was the only possible way.

The honor and disgrace of the Sea Spirit City has nothing to do with them. The supremacy position of the 72 cities had never been in the eyes of Jun Wu Xie. What she wanted was to confuse them and let the dispute happen and hustle directly pass on to the Lord. By then, the Lord would realize that there was an extraordinary character in the 72 cities!

Therefore, even if you know that Jun Wu Xie’s behavior was crazy and extreme, but Hua Yao did not dare to stop her or stop the dispute from happening.

Several of them had experienced life and death. They saw their family members slaughtered before their eyes. They knew the pain of the separation of blood relatives. How could people stop Jun Wu Xie from saving Jun Gu?

“But ... What else can Little Xie do? That’s a two million army!” Qiao Chu frowned, this time the 72 cities had put in all their capital. They were all ready to annihilate the Sea Spirit City in one fell swoop. Jun Wu Xie was alone facing this storm. He was a little uncomfortable against this behemoth.
