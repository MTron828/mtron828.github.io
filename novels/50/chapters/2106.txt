Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Poison Ivy, you can’t even protect yourself here and you still want to stick your nose into other people’s affairs?” The Second Disciple’s eyes flashed with a moment of vicious malice and he immediately turned to say respectfully to the Spirit Lord: “Reporting to the Spirit Lord, Poison Ivy is involving himself into it.”

The Spirit Lord’s eyes narrowed up slightly and his gaze swept over Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy suddenly felt as if an unseen power had his throat clutched in its grasp, and it was highly agonizing. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Bring him back as well” The Spirit Lord said coldly.

“Yes, Spirit Lord!” Without another word, the Second Disciple immediately got his men to bind up the prisoners with a wave of his hand.

Poison Ivy was not going to allow anyone to touch Jun Wu Xie and the companions and he fought against the oppressive aura the Spirit Lord had released to push his vines out, that speedily twirled and weaved into a web before Jun Wu Xie and the others.

“What audacity! Poison Ivy! Are are rebelling against the Spirit Lord! ?” The Second Disciple roared.

Poison Ivy did not even look at the Second Disciple at all, a fox borrowing on the ferocity of a tiger, but was looking with an unwavering gaze at the Spirit Lord, his eyes filled with doubt and disbelief.

“Spirit Lord, why are you doing this?”

The Spirit Lord turned to look at Poison Ivy. After a moment’s silence, he suddenly opened his mouth to say: “Poison Ivy, what am I like in your heart?”

Poison Ivy lowered his eyes and then said feeling rather painfully and conflicted: “Spirit Lord, you created the Spirit World and gave us spirits a safe place to reside in. You are an irreplaceable benefactor in all our hearts and have always been righteous and impartial, benevolent and forgiving.”

That was the impression all spirits had of the Spirit Lord in their hearts. What Poison Ivy said was just what all the other spirit felt.

The Spirit Lord suddenly laughed as he looked at Poison Ivy’s conflicted expression before saying with a joyful laugh: “So, in all of your hearts, I am actually so perfect. I am truly very happy to hear that.”

Seeing the Spirit Lord smile, Poison Ivy secretly heaved a sigh of relief inside. But before he could even recollect himself, a powerful surge of oppressive aura suddenly severed off his consciousness!

Poison Ivy fell to the ground without a sound, and the vines blocking the human spirits’ way dissipated away together with that.

“If I am truly so great, then why do you not obey my order?” The smile on the Spirit Lord’s face disappeared, to be replaced by a heart chilling callousness.

“Take them all away.” The Spirit Lord tossed out that statement and then turned around to leave.

The Beast Spirits at the sides were unable to move, suppressed by the spirit aura. They could do nothing but to stare in incredulity at the Spirit Lord they found so unfamiliar to them before their eyes.

When did their Spirit Lord become so cruel?

The Second Disciple acknowledged the order given to him and went on to gleefully and arrogantly get his men to bind Jun Wu Xie and the others up tightly before dragging them away.

Under the countless pairs of eyes of the Beast Spirits, the group of human spirits blatantly dragged Jun Wu Xie and her companions away. Many of the Beast Spirits wanted to rush forward to stop them but they were all unable to move.

It was until the team of human spirits had disappeared from sight that the spirit aura that engulfed their bodies started to fade away.

“What is exactly..... happening here?” All the Beast Spirits began to stand up, their hearts filled with horror. They just could not understand what had happened in that scene they had just seen.

Just what was their Spirit Lord really doing?

While the mass of Beast Spirits were still stunned and frozen in their places, a dark shadow lay concealed within Flame Dragon’s cave, its sharp gaze from its pair of eyes peering through the swathe of darkness inside to watch everything that was happening outside. The dark shadow then soundlessly took a step back, and looked at Nalan Shan who lay protected within two Spirit Reinforcement circles. It was clear that Jun Wu Xie’s Spirit Reinforcement runes had worked and the Spirit Lord had not noticed Nalan Shan’s presence.

Beneath the notice of all the other Beast Spirits, that little black shadow then shot out lightning quick from Flame Dragon’s dark lair, carrying itself at its fastest speed in a mad sprint towards its intended destination.
