Han Zi Fei felt that she was not a responsible mother.

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie closely. At this moment, there wasn’t any of her usual calmness and confidence. Instead, there was a hint of worry and panic that were apparent in her eyes.

No woman could maintain a strong image in front of her children. That was the softest part of their hearts.

After many months of pregnancy, going through the pain of giving birth, it was like cutting off a piece of meat from the mother!

Even if she hadn’t seen her child for many years, even if she hadn’t raised the child herself. But the blood relation could never be severed. For many years, Han Zi Fei had been awakened by the illusion of the child in her dreams during the nights. She saw the dim figure in her dream and sensed strong hatred from her.

She was scared. She was really scared.

She could withstand the loneliness for a thousand years. She could withstand the ruthless pursuit of the Upper Realm. She could withstand the contempt of the entire tribe.

However, she couldn’t take Jun Wu Xie’s “I hate you” ...

Jun Wu Xie looked at the nervous and trembling Han Zi Fei before her. She wanted to open her mouth to say something but her voice seemed to be stuck in her throat. She couldn’t say it. She turned her head blankly and searched for Jun Wu Yao’s presence.

Jun Wu Yao smiled at her slightly. That familiar smile was like the moonlight that calmed down the storm and soothed the waves of Jun Wu Xie’s heart. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

When Jun Wu Xie looked back again at Han Zi Fei, she finally opened her mouth.

“I don’t hate you, I’m happy, I can find you, my mother.” Jun Wu Xie’s voice was very light, almost inaudible. At the same time, when she finished speaking, she finally gathered her courage and hugged Han Zi Fei’s shoulder, that seemingly powerful, but thin shoulder.

Han Zi Fei took a deep breath and her inner joy and liberation made her cry again. She didn’t know what to say, she just hugged Jun Wu Xie and cried like a child.

Jun Wu Xie, from panic to calmness, was filled with happiness that she had never experienced before.

She had a grandfather, a young uncle, Jun Wu Yao, Qiao Chu and others. And now, the heavens had sent her parents to her. This great happiness brought everything she needed to experience in this life. She never knew that the blood relatives were so subtle and magical.

Even if the truth was unknown, the entanglement had never disappeared. Since she saw Han Zi Fei’s first glance, the subtle relationship in the bloodline had bound them together.

Jun Gu stood aside in a daze for a long time, until Jun Wu Yao made a hand gesture to release a seal and Jun Gu suddenly realized that his girl had grown this big.

With this determination, Jun Gu finally let go of his doubts. He strode forward and embraced the two most important women of his life, into his arms.

“It’s good now, it’s good now. Our family is finally reunited.” Jun Gu smiled. His eyes faintly gleaming with tears.

He thanked the heavens for the kindness.

To let him regain the treasure from this life. No matter how difficult the future would be, he would face it willingly.

For his wife, for his daughter.

Jun Wu Yao looked at the family of three hugging together. The smile on the corner of his mouth grew wider. As long as Jun Wu Xie was happy, he had nothing to ask for.
