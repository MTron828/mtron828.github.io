Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The members of the Night Regime who were guarding Fei Yan’s “home” immediately came to notify Fei Yan when they noticed Xu Zu and his peers’ movements, Fei Yan immediately changed his “outfit” and hurried back.

When Xu Zu and his men were about to smash the door open, Fei Yan, who was dressed as the young soldier, opened the door. He had a piece of clothing draped across his shoulders and looked barely half awake as he rubbed his eyes while opening the door.

“Hey? Why are you here?” Fei Yan pretended to be surprised at Xu Zu and the others’ arrival.

“We’ll talk inside.” Xu Zu carefully looked around, and immediately pushed himself into the house.

They looked around and after they determined that there was no one else in the room, asked Fei Yan, “What I’ve instructed you before, have you done so?”

“Ah! You mean ...” Fei Yan pretended to suddenly realized as his expression became tense. He lowered his voice and said, “My Lord, rest assured, I have received one medicinal pill. I’ve obtained this pill through a good friend, but he only had one portion of this pill. In order to get it from it, I had to promise that I would bring him along to Long Xuan City. I hope.... That My Lord won’t blame me. I’m too lowly... I don’t qualify to receive this medicinal pill.”

Fei Yan said all these in a helpless manner, with a hint of timidity and greed in his eyes. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xu Zu looked at Fei Yan in disapproval, a slight disdain for him rose in his heart.

This kid didn’t look like he had any ability. If it wasn’t because they wanted to obtain the news first, they wouldn’t have favoured such a weakling. But regardless, the medicinal pill is now in their possession.

“No problem, since you are working for us, we will not ill treat you and your brother. As long as we can determine the effect of this medicinal pill, we will immediately take you to Long Xuan City. Rest assured.” Even though there was so much disdain in his heart, Xu Zuo’s face still bore a look of camaraderie.

Fei Yan was naturally grateful and thankful. At the urging of Xu Zu, the bottle of medicine that Jun Wuxie gave him in the morning was handed to Xu Zu.

Xu Zu’s eyes changed a little when he saw the medicine bottle. He took it and opened the cap carefully. The strange smell slowly diffused out of the bottle, although the slight bloody smell was mixed with bitterness of the herbs, it still stood out.

Even though Xu Zu had just taken a whiff of the medicine, he could feel the spiritual power within his body rise up. His eyes flashed sharply and he immediately closed the lid.

But the waves of desire in his heart were surging forward.

This medicine ...

It’s true!

He could already feel an impact on his spiritual power just from a light whiff. If he swallowed the whole thing, who knew what amazing changes it would bring!

Xu Zu’s heart was shocked and joyful, suddenly he glanced to the side where Fei Yan was looking at him with a puzzled look. He immediately sobered up and recovered his usual arrogant demeanour.

“We’ll send this medicine back first, while you wait here. We won’t treat you badly.” Xu Zu had originally planned to leave after obtaining the medicine. What promise? It was all bullshit. Only the promises between the strong could be fulfilled, but for the weak, the only way was to tolerate things.

But now, Xu Xu suddenly changed his intention.

“Sir, you ... won’t you take us away with you?” Fei Yan pretended to be afraid.

Xu Zu said: “Don’t worry, your good will, Long Xuan City remembers.”
