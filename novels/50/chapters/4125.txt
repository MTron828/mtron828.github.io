Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Zheng Weilong, who came along with the army, looked at this scene not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Just a few days ago, Jun Wu Xie suddenly asked her what other cities were around the Sea Spirit City, but Zheng Weilong didn’t think much about it, and she drew a picture of the distribution of the 72 cities. Jun Wu Xie glanced at the picture, and selected East Peak City, she then asked Zheng Weilong to draw a portrait of Dongfang Ku Bi. When the portrait was finished, Jun Wu Xie actually brought her soldiers to East Peak City...

The speed of the whole process and the speed of action really made Zheng Weilong startled.

It was really a case of a small disagreement that caused a fight, and there were no signs whatsoever.

Jun Wu Xie had attacked Long Xuan City because Ruan Zhongshan threw the first punch, but to then attack East Peak City ... Zheng Weilong really didn’t understand.

However, as a person with no spiritual powers, Zheng Weilong knew from childhood that she had to learn self-preservation. Therefore, she could not work hard on her strength, so she then had to work hard on studying everything about the Upper Realm. The distribution map of the 72 cities, even the faces of all the current city owners, she could draw them with her eyes closed.

The portrait Fei Yan held onto was painted by Zheng Weilong in accordance with Jun Wu Xie’s request.

Fei Yan was still threatening to strangle Qiao Chu. Qiao Chu was still hiding behind Hua Yao, treating him as a shield. Since no matter how angry Fei Yan was, he would not hit Hua Yao, and thus that allowed Qiao Chu to escape Fei Yan’s wrath.

While they were arguing, the soldiers on the gate tower of East Peak City on the tower were unsure. They heard the dialogue between Qiao Chu and Fei Yan, but they knew clearly that the person who shot an arrow at their City Lord was Qiao Chu.

Seeing the fierce look of Fei Yan directed towards Qiao Chu, the soldiers were even more afraid.

The destructive power of the arrow was great. If it wasn’t because the target was Dongfang Ku Bi, no one could have avoided it. Because Dongfang Ku Bi escaped that arrow, the Sea Spirit City people were blaming that archer. However, with that archer’s capability, if he was from East Peak City, he would be someone who stood out!

However, within the troops of Sea Spirit City, that person was actually being scolded, and he even did not defend himself and hid behind someone...

What a brutal army it was!

As soon as the soldiers of East Peak City thought of the destruction of Long Xuan City, they couldn’t help but think about the fierce fighting power of Sea Spirit City. The moment they thought about fighting those ‘beasts’ below, they felt their legs tremble. The battle had yet to start but they’ve already lost their morale.

Dongfang Ku Bi felt that he was extremely out of luck. He only said a few bad things about Sea Spirit City back at his official residence and before he knew it, the people in the Sea Spirit City came knocking at his city’s gates. Moreover, there was no chit-chat... This was something that Dongfang Ku Bi had never thought of.

Even though he was terribly angry, Dongfang Ku Bi no longer dared to show his head. Who knew if Sea Spirit City would shoot arrows the moment he appeared?

The pain on his cheek kept reminding him about the “cruelty” of Sea Spirit City.

What happened to the challenge? What happened to a confrontation?

The moment he showed his face, an arrow was shot at him! How could they speak on good terms?!

Qiao Chu was scolded by Fei Yan, Jun Wu Xie just looked at them for a long time, and finally said, “Forget it.”

“Ye Sha, call for the challenge.” Jun Wu Xie said to Ye Sha on the side.

Ye Sha immediately took a step forward, stood in front of the gates of East Peak City and called out!
