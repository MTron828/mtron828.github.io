Chapter 3069 The Chaos Array 3

Jun Wu Yao wore a frown on his face, if he and Jun Wu Xie being trapped in the chaos array for 100 years was only the beginning, who knew what was next.

......

After the Chaos Rules dispersed, Jun Wu Xie remained in the same spot for a few more days. It was there that she and Jun Wu Yao spent 100 years together, watching sunrise and sunset together. If she thought about it, it was not a lonely period.

In addition, the 100 years have improved her temperament and also gave her more understanding of her own power.

This, was chaos.

Early the next day...

Walking towards the ancient valley.

As they got deeper into the valley, Jun Wu Yao heard a strange song.

At first, he thought it was a side effect of being trapped for 100 years but as time went by the song got more and more miserable.

“Little Xie, do you hear that?” he asked Jun Wu Xie. If he was really imagining it then she would not have heard it too.

“Yes.” Jun Wu Xie replied. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Be careful, there are strange things in this valley.” Jun Wu Yao warned her as he felt uneasy.

After a while, they came upon a stream, which was the source of the song.

“Little Xie...” Jun Wu Yao was staring into space, his expression changing slightly.

Even without Jun Wu Yao’s reminder, she had already noticed the same thing.

Above the void, was a beautiful woman in a long flowing gown with a smile that would capture anybody’s heart. However she seemed distant.

“When he looks, I will dance. His smile resembles the sun, but he said my coldness reflects the ice... The years have passed without me knowing. I ask him, where are you? Where you are is where I am. I ask him again, when are you cold?”

The song stopped. That beautiful lady let out a tinkling laugh, as if she was a young girl as she stared lovingly into the emptiness. Her movements were light and gentle.

Below, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao looked at each other. The woman seemed to be rambling to nobody in particular.

“Excuse me...” Jun Wu Yao said cagily to the woman.

The woman was very disturbed when Jun Wu Yao spoke to her.

Instantly, her smile disappeared and unease, fear, anger and pain all came to the surface and could be seen in her eyes.

Next, ice started to fall from the sky and covered the world in a sheet of ice.

“This time, can you still use your warmth to melt my ice? I miss you so much.” The woman shed tears of ice and the world fell into a deep silence.

“What sort of great power is this....” Jun Wu Yao saw that it was enveloping him, Jun Wu Xie and everything that surrounded them.

Even Jun Wu Xie, normally so calm, was feeling something strange.

“Without my sun, what use is snow....what use is the whole world? I miss him. Where he is, is where I am.”

In an instant, the entire world was covered by snow, sleet and frost.
