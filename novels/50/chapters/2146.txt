Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Meh meh! !” Lord Meh Meh followed behind Jun Wu Xie, bouncing along the entire way as it looked at the little black cat seated safely upon Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder, its little heart filled with envy, jealousy and hatred, hating the fact that it was not small enough, or it would be able to stand upon Jun Wu Xie’s other shoulder! !

Jun Wu Xie’s heel was then stepped upon by one of Lord Meh Meh’s hoof and she couldn’t help but halt in her steps. She turned around to look at Lord Meh Meh who knew it had done something wrong and she immediately felt like she didn’t know whether to cry or laugh.

Lord Meh Meh had its eyes turned away, looking like a little guilt ridden child, not daring to look into Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

Jun Wu Xie finally could not help but laugh and shook her head as she bent down to scoop Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit up into her arms. The two adorable little beasts were not really that heavy, but also not that light at the same time. But with the great increase in Jun Wu Xie’s powers, she would be able to carry them all even if there were a few more of them.

When the masked girl saw that Jun Wu Xie had stopped, she halted her steps as well.

Jun Wu Xie had just carried up the two adorable beasts securely in her arms and straightened her body to continue to make her way forward when she suddenly saw a highly wretched looking person making a mad dash through the crowd of people to come rushing hurriedly straight towards her.

The girl wearing the mask immediately narrowed her eyes and she suddenly moved her body to come right in front of Jun Wu Xie to block the way, immediately pulling out the sword hanging from her hip.

That person was running frantically, and bumping his way through the crowd, he finally came before Jun Wu Xie, but was knocked in the shoulder by someone and he fell in a flurry right onto the ground right in front of Jun Wu Xie.

A rotting stench wafted out from that person’s body, and Jun Wu Xie just stood there to stare at the person on the ground.

“Jun..... Jun.....” The person struggled, wanting to get up. But that fall had further weakened his already frail body. He forcefully propped his upper body up, and a pool of blood could be seen to have collected under him.

“Who are you! ?” It was the first time the masked girl opened her mouth to speak in front of Jun Wu Xie, and Jun Wu Xie actually felt a sliver of familiarity in that voice.

But without waiting for Jun Wu Xie to think further, the person on the ground opened his mouth and he was barely able to utter out two words that shook Jun Wu Xie right to the core.

“Su..... Ya.....”

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes quivered, as she stared in surprise at the person.

Su Ya.

Her Master, the Master who was willing to risk her life to protect her!

Jun Wu Xie immediately sensed that something was not right and she immediately crouched herself down, putting Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit back on the ground, to go forward and lift the person’s shoulders to look into the person’s face. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

That face, could no longer be called a person’s face. From his forehead to his chin, there wasn’t a single piece of healthy flesh anymore, the rotten wounds dripping with thick sticky pus, looking highly disgusting.

“Jun Xie..... Save..... save..... Su..... Ya.....” The person tore out those heartrending words from his parched throat.

Those stuttering words, caused Jun Wu Xie to freeze in spot.

Save Su Ya.....

That did those words really mean?

The person seemed to be highly distraught, and unable to hold out any longer, he fell into a complete dead faint after saying those words!

The figure of Ye Sha appeared beside Jun Wu Xie in the next instant.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes widened slightly, and an ominous feeling rise up in her heart right at that moment.

“Young Miss?” Ye Sha said in a low voice.

“Bring him back!” Jun Wu Xie said immediately. No matter who this person is, his words had greatly shook Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

“Yes, Young Miss!” Without another word, Ye Sha immediately carried that person up onto his shoulder.

Jun Wu Xie had already lost the heart to go find Jun Wu Yao, but immediately got Ye Sha to bring that person back to the Spirit Jade Palace branch!
