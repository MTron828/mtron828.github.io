Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

During the conversation, Yan Xi had left. Han Shu wanted to take advantage of this rare “solitary” opportunity to establish a deeper bond with Jun Wu Xie.

In the end...

“Since Lord Jun Gu has already taken a rest, then I will go back first.” Jun Wu Xie left such a sentence without a moment more, she left just like that.

Han Shu was dumbfounded ...

When she regained her senses and wanted to catch up with Jun Wu Xie, she discovered that the figure she had been seeking had already disappeared.

At this moment, there was only one person who could tell Jun Wu Xie the answer that she seeked most.

“Why are you here?” Han Zi Fei was sitting in the study and saw the figure suddenly coming in through the window, raising her eyebrows slightly as she put down the books in her hand.

“Who is Elder Luo? What is the witchcraft she studied?” Jun Wu Xie asked her doubts directly.

Han Zi Fei froze slightly. She never thought that Jun Wu Xie would come to find her and ask about this.

“What do you know?” Han Zi Fei did not answer Jun Wu Xie’s question directly.

“I saw Yan Xi.” Jun Wu Xie said: “Yan Xi is an apprentice to Elder Luo. She controlled my father with the rhinoceros horns, so ...”

“So you’re thinking, is the poison from Ye Jue’s body the result of Elder Luo’s witchcraft?” Han Zi Fei continued Jun Wu Xie’s unfinished words.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

Han Zi Fei laughed lightly.

“You are very clever, but you don’t know well enough about the Upper Realm. Elder Luo does have some skills, but to suppress Ye Jue’s poison is definitely not something that she can make. Only His Lord knows where it came from, that’s why you don’t have to ponder too much on it. But if you have the opportunity to enter the Sacred Land to train your psychic force, you will have the opportunity to get close to Elder Luo instead. Since you want to unravel the secrets of the life and death worm from Ye Jue’s body, you must understand more about the poison, do you understand? “Han Zi Fei said in a warm voice.

“Mn.” Jun Wu Xie answered. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie with a smile and suddenly asked: “Do you love him very much?”

“What?” Jun Wu Xie froze slightly, looking at Han Zi Fei in amazement.

Han Zi Fei chuckled: “The moment you attained some clues, you came to me so eagerly to ask. Doesn’t this show that you love him very much?”

Her little girl had grown up. She seemed cold but there was warmth hidden within her.

Jun Wu Xie opened her mouth but for a while, she didn’t know what to say.

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie’s dumbfounded expression and couldn’t help feeling happy.

“Alright, I shan’t tease you any further. You better head back soon. Now that Yan Xi is back to the Holy Mountain, presumably Jun Gu is here too. I don’t think it will be long before Duan Qi should come to see me to discuss meeting with your father. When I meet you again, I won’t be able to have a conversation like this. You know, they are all guarded against you and me right now. ”

Jun Wu Xie was still left a little speechless by Han Zi Fei, but she also knew how serious the matter was and she could only leave as she had her answer.

In an instant, Jun Wu Xie disappeared.

Han Zi Fei looked at the empty study, but the smile at the corner of her lips slowly dissipated, and her pair of beautiful eyes drooped slightly There was a lingering figure in her heart.

My husband, we are going to meet again.

Our marriage this time round, would be held in front of our daughter.

Do you know?

Are you happy?
