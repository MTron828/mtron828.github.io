Chapter 3065 On The Eve Of The Battle 2

“What the hell happened, why did you suddenly ...” Jun Wu Yao pulled away from Jun Wu Xie slightly, but when he looked at Jun Wu Xie again, he was stunned.

Jun Wu Xie no longer had the disguise she wore as Yan Hai and had reverted to her original appearance. But her eyes...were a light gold colour...just like the child that grew up with Jun Wu Yao in the dream world.

“Your eyes?” Jun Wu Yao reached up and stroked Jun Wu Xie’s face.

“This is the Lord’s or I should say, the God of Destruction’s plan. He needs more spiritual power to destroy the void but cannot get it from those other Gods. So he lured you and me here....” Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and brushed Jun Wu Yao’s cheek. She felt calm, so calm that it surprised herself.

From what Jun Wu Xie said, Jun Wu Yao understood everything.

“Why would he spend so much effort to revive your divine powers?” Jun Wu Yao thought the Lord’s plan was curious, Chi Yan and Su Ruiying might have been a match for Jun Wu Xie before she regained her divine powers but definitely not after.

He could not shake the feeling that they had missed something important.

The God of Destruction plotted something so elaborate just to force Jun Wu Xie into regaining her divine powers? How would that benefit him?

“No matter his motivation, I have to thank him for that.” Jun Wu Xie blurted out.

“What?”

Jun Wu Xie’s eyebrow was slightly cocked, and she produced a small golden flame from her fingertip. She pushed that flame into Jun Wu Yao’s chest before he had time to react and the flame was quietly absorbed into his body.

“What is that...” Jun Wu Xie was going to ask that question when he felt a force radiating from his chest to all parts of his body and removing all blockages along the way!

A look of surprised flashed across his purple eyes.

“Since it was a poison from a God, only a God could unlock it.” Jun Wu Xie looked up and smiled at Jun Wu Yao’s surprised face. She had memorised the recipe for the life and death worm that she had seen at Su Ruiying’s house but could never unravel its mysteries until she regained her divine powers and finally, she understood.

It turned out that....

From the start, it was never something that could be made by a human.

Jun Wu Yao himself used to be a God, and only Gods could make things to suppress other Gods’ powers.

This sort of thing could be easily dealt with if one had a grasp of one’s divine powers. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

With his long dormant powers returned, blood was surging through Jun Wu Yao’s body, causing him to take a deep breath. It was a feeling that was hard to describe.

“Luckily there is you.” Jun Wu Yao held back his elation, lowered his head and kissed Jun Wu Xie on the lips.
