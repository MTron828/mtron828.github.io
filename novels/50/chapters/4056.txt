Xu Zu was the most powerful among them, but now, he vomited blood in front of their eyes. This picture really shocked the people of Long Xuan City.

But Jun Wu Xie sat umoving in her chair as her eyes, which were as cold as a thousand year old iceberg, swept across everyone from Long Xuan City.

“These little people of Long Xuan City want to test my strength, isn’t there proper etiquette in Long Xuan City?” Jun Wu Xie said coldly, that bloody color bloomed from her eyes, as the scent of blood made her wrinkled her brow.

Xu Zu suddenly raised his hand and signaled to those frightened companions to sit down. He raised his hand and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, as he looked up at an indifferent Jun Wu Xie, but he no longer had suspicion and disdain in his eyes.

He could clearly feel the tremendous strength of Jun Wu Xie’s spiritual power. Don’t talk about a confrontation, unless the other party did not want his life, he was afraid that he would have already died just now.

“It was indeed rude of me, please forgive me Lord.” Xu Zu was forcefully enduring the immense pain in his chest as he got up to apologise to Jun Wu Xie. He no longer dared to be scornful and disrespectful.

Exactly how strong was Jun Wu Xie, Xu Zu was not all that clear, but he knew that it was definitely much stronger than him.

“If you are disrespectful again, I don’t mind helping your City Lord teach you all a lesson.” Jun Wu Xie said it nonchalantly.

Xu Zu’s heart clenched as he gulped tensely. He was extremely depressed.

Yan Wan was treacherous, but he was also extremely cunning. Even if there was really a city that made trouble for him, he would laugh and put priority in maintaining good relations with the other city. But evidently, this new City Lord did not care about such matters as he handled Xu Zu without any sense of kindness.

This depressing loss, Xu Zu could only suffer in silence as he knew that he was not Jun Wu Xie’s match. So even if there was hatred in his heart, he could not show even a trace of it.

“Yes, I humbly accept your lesson.” Xu Zu said obediently.

Jun Wu Xie sneered.

Xu Zu sat back with fear in his heart. When he raised his eyes again, it was with respect as he looked at Jun Wu Xie.

“Speak, why are you here at Sea Spirit City?” Jun Wu Xie asked slowly and deliberately. By the side, Fan Zhuo’s timely approach to fill up Jun Wu Xie’s teacup, as he lowered his eyes to conceal the laughter in his eyes.

The show of strength by Little Xie was swift and efficient, and what a joy it was to watch!

When he thought about how arrogant and tyrannical Xu Zu and his gang was since they arrived in Sea Spirit City, and then now Xu Zu looked like an obedient grandson, Fan Zhuo felt extremely satisfied.

Xu Zu ignored the pain wrecking through his body as he put a bold face on and said, “The blood of the Sea Spirit Beast for Long Xuan City is supplied by the Sea Spirit City previously, but now Sea Spirit City has not supplied the blood, flesh and skin of the Sea Spirit Beasts for more than half a month. There has been a lot of newborn in Long Xuan City, and we are in need of the Sea Spirit Beast blood. Thus, my City Lord commanded me to come and ask you, Lord of Sea Spirit City, with regards to the flesh and blood of this Sea Spirit Beast... When will it be available again?”

Xu Zu’s speech had become more cautious, as he was deeply afraid of offending Jun Wu Xie, his words and sentences were measured.

Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes focused on Xu Zu who was filled with trepidation, and she replied unhurriedly, “Not available.”

“Ah?” Xu Zu was stunned.

Not available?

What did he mean? ? ?
