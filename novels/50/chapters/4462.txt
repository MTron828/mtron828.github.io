3058 Killing recovery 4

“Ye Jue, don’t be overconfident.” Jun Wu Yao’s tone displeased Chi Yan’s heart. Except for His Lord, Chi Yan never bowed his head in front of anyone, never in the past and future!

“Confident?” Jun Wu Yao sneered. He raised it slowly with one hand. The black dark spirit gathered in his palm a little, like a burning black flame, as if it would engulf everything into the abyss.

His chin lifted slightly, and the evil smile spread from the corners of his lips.

“For you, how can I not be confident? I only ask you the last time, where is he? If you don’t want to say ... I will let you suffer until you speak.”

“I won’t tell you, you have no chance to know.” Chi Yan said coldly.

“Oh?” Jun Wu Yao chuckled abruptly, his figure slowly rising up into the air, conquering, watching Chi Yan and the others.

Since his reunion with Jun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Yao had been immersed in happiness with Jun Wu Xie. That warm sense of happiness warmed his cold heart a little, and it calmed the killing that filled his heart. Even if he returned to the Upper Realm that disgusted him, even if he tried to strangle those disgusting people several times.

However, he knew very well that Jun Wu Xie didn’t want him to strike easily. She didn’t want to expose him to danger, and he was willing to consolidate the killing spirit in his heart, standing behind her, watching her plan and her confidence.

Of course ...

Now, the killing spirit in Jun Wu Yao’s heart had been completely ignited, there was nothing more unbearable than the fear of losing Jun Wu Xie.

“Then, let’s take a good look at the taste of despair.” Jun Wu Yao’s faint voice spoke with a sweet voice with a non-smiling tone.

But the sound passed into Su Ruiying’s ears, but it made Su Ruiying’s blood seem to freeze in an instant. A fear that had never hovered in her heart. She wished to escape from here immediately, from the man who just watched and made her feel the death!

Su Ruiying’s premonition was correct, just at the moment when Jun Wu Yao’s voice fell, the demon in his hand expanded in an instant, a huge black flame, as if swallowing the sun, and the dark shadow enveloped the earth, and the wind blew suddenly. The green grass floats and the fallen leaves were flying, like a precursor to a landslide!

The powerful coercion seemed to be able to smash people’s internal organs instantly!

The four puppets around Su Ruiying made a crisp cracking sound under strong coercion. A series of cracks cracked like a cobweb on the face of the puppet, and the soul sealed in the puppet flowed out of the crack crazily!

So strong! !

Su Ruiying had never felt such a powerful coercion, the puppet guarding her seems to burst in the next second. She subconsciously looked at Chi Yan, but found that ...

Chi Yan’s face was so ugly!

Chi Yan thought that Jun Wu Yao, who had been restrained by life and death worm would no longer have such a powerful force. But the strong coercion over his head, but even he could feel the great pain!

How powerful was Jun Wu Yao exactly?

Chi Yan couldn’t guess at all. At this moment, Chi Yan realized for the first time that he had erroneously underestimated Jun Wu Yao’s strength. This realization came too late.

The dark spirit in Jun Wu Yao’s hands had already condensed and smashed downwards!Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
