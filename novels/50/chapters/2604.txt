Meng Qiu wholeheartedly guarded the Spirit Tree, making that his only goal. Within the thousand years, his goal never changed.

As long as it was matters instructed by the Spirit Tree, he would do it accordingly, only because he wanted to hear the Spirit Tree’s voice.

Even if it were only a few words.

But....

As spirit lives in the Soul World increased, the Spirit Tree had handed over the Spirit Envoy teachings to those Spirit Envoys who had been in the Soul World for many years. Meng Qiu had initially mentored a lot of Spirit Envoys and felt that this was the mission given to him by the Spirit Tree. And he did his best every time. However...

The Spirit Tree spoke to him less and less, the Spirit Envoys kept increasing; the Spirit Tree named each new Spirit Envoy and as there were too many, it consumed much of the Spirit Tree’s time. As more Spirit Envoys were born, Meng Qiu’s sense of existence became lower, and he began to hate that feeling. He did not like to stand at a distance and look at the Spirit Tree being surrounded by other Spirit Envoys. It was an eye sore to Meng Qiu

That gentle and soothing voice gradually drifted further away from him.

Even if he struggled to cultivate and surpassed all the Spirit Envoys in the Soul World, and was most qualified to guard the Spirit Tree, the Spirit Tree still did not increase the number of times it spoke with him.

Even until later...

The connection between the Spirit Tree and Meng Qiu was severed, and Meng Qiu did not hear the Spirit Tree’s voice for a thousand years. He was not used to it, and even hated the situation.

Every time he saw the newly born Spirit Envoys being embraced by the vines, in his heart, that sense of hatred could not be covered up. Only the water from the Soul Devourer River could calm his raging heart.

But, because of one Spirit Envoy’s entreatment, the Spirit Tree abolished the use of the Soul Devourer River.

In that moment, Meng Qiu realised that the warmth of the Spirit Tree never belonged to him...

As long as there were other Spirit Envoys, and as long as there were new births of souls, the Spirit Tree would never belong to only him!

The darkness in his heart grew bigger little by little, as it gradually consumed Meng Qiu’s soul. He no longer desired for the Spirit Tree’s appreciation. He found the Contemporaneous Knot and buried it within himself and the Spirit Tree undetected.

He thought.....

Only like this will make the Spirit Tree belong to him.

Meng Qiu looked at the vine that hadn’t touched him in a thousand years, and sorrow shone through his eyes.

“In your heart, am I just like any other Spirit Envoy? There is no difference?” Meng Qiu suddenly spoke, his tone held a mix of sorrow, pain and disappointment.

He looked at the Spirit Tree, that tree which had stood unmoving for a thousand years, it was clear that it could only be heard in the spiritual world, but subconsciously, in Meng Qiu’s heart, the Spirit Tree was no longer a tree, it became an obsession that he was unable to give up.

“Even if I betrayed you, you also can’t be bothered right? Ha ha.... No matter what I do, in your eyes, I’m dispensable.”

He did not care about the conditions given by the Upper Realm, he did not care if he could gather more power, from now until the end, the thing he wanted most to possess, was IT.

The soul was disintegrating bit by bit, weakness made Meng Qiu unable to hold on to his last dignity, suppressing the unwillingness and grief in his heart for many years.

His accusation made Qin Song and Long Jiu slide into shock.
