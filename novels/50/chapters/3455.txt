“I understand the secret behind the Serene Spirit Tower now. Wu Jiu harbours evil intentions afterall, as he seeks to destroy the entire Spirit World!” Having come to understand the use of the Spirit Reinforcement runes, Jun Wu Xie was getting rather excited.

And the more she understood, the more she came to realize that the Serene Spirit Tower was not a place that was provided for human spirits to cultivate in. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was just a great big slaughterhouse!

“Wu Yao, the Spirit Reinforcement runes in the Serene Spirit Tower is actually an enormous spirit sacrificial array! It constantly uses its own power to elevate the cultivation of the people that come in, making them stronger, till they have been strengthened to a certain level, they would be transformed into power of the spirit, to feed that ball of Spirit Fire inside!” Jun Wu Xie said as she looked at Jun Wu Yao. She had not thought that the truth would be so shocking. She had initially arranged the Spirit Reinforcement runes based on those in the Serene Spirit Tower and had felt the same feeling that she had felt back in the Serene Spirit Tower before. The power of the spirit had surged into her body uncontrollably but she had known that was a sign of danger.

But when she reversed the sequence of the Spirit Reinforcement runes, what she then got was the true and proper way to elevate one’s power of the spirit!

The four Serene Spirit Towers, were essentially speaking, four enormous slaughterhouses. It constantly induced the human spirits who came inside to grow in strength, till they were powerful enough to be absorbed by the Spirit Fire on the twelfth level. Having understood the sequence of Spirit Reinforcement runes, and combined with Nalan Shan’s investigations, the truth then floated up to the surface.

“Sacrificial?” Jun Wu Yao’s eyes narrowed slightly. When that word fell in his ears, his eyes had unconsciously turned purple. Intense emotions then roiled within his eyes, and he forcibly suppressed the surge rising inside, to continue to listen to what Jun Wu Xie had to say.

“That’s right. Sacrificial. The real purpose of this combination of Spirit Reinforcement runes is sacrifice. It sacrifices spirits that grow to become powerful enough, to provide more power to the Spirit Fire.” Jun Wu Xie said, drawing in a deep breath. No wonder Wu Jiu had never been willing to cultivate in the Serene Spirit Towers. He must have known the truth behind the Serene Spirit Towers and that was why.

All spirits that went inside would be affected by the Spirit Reinforcement runes from the first time they stepped in there and even after they have left, that effect would not be severed. Like Little Black’s current condition, their power of the spirit would be unknowingly absorbed. No matter how far they went away, they would not be able to cut off that link and the only way to completely eradicate those effects would be to destroy the Spirit Reinforcement runes in the Serene Spirit Tower.

Having unraveled the Serene Spirit Tower’s secret, Jun Wu Xie had however fallen deep into another big question.

Based on this arrangement of the Spirit Reinforcement runes, the power of the spirit that was absorbed by the ball of Spirit Fire would not be able to be withdrawn. Even Wu Jiu would not be able to horde the power of the spirit for his own use. So why was he doing this? He had racked his brains to build the Serene Spirit Towers and had even abandoned his own disciples. What could his motives really be?

“No matter what he is thinking of doing, it will not be anything good.” Jun Wu Yao said with his eyes narrowed.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. Now that she knew the real truth, then the only way to save Little Black would be to completely destroy the Spirit Reinforcement runes in the first Serene Spirit Tower completely. Otherwise, even if Jun Wu Xie and her companions had already left the Spirit World, the little black cat would still not recover from its condition.

“I need to go to the first Serene Spirit Tower once more.” Jun Wu Xie said.

“You’re sure?” Jun Wu Yao asked as he looked at Jun Wu Xie with an eyebrow raised.

Jun Wu Xie replied: “Only I am able to use Spirit Reinforcement, and only I will be able to reverse the Spirit Reinforcement array in there!”
