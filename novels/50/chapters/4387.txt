Chapter 2983 The four knights 2

Jun Wu Xie already knew the identities of the other three people. This woman should be the last person among the Knights of Destruction.

“You are Yan Hai?” Chi Yan’s sharp eyes fell on Jun Wu Xie’s body. He was obviously the host who had invited her as the guest but his gaze was as sharp as a knife’s edge, without any politeness. He sized her up viciously without hiding his intentions.

“Yes.” Jun Wu Xie said calmly.

“Who is that person behind you?” Chi Yan’s gaze fell to Jun Wu Yao who was behind Jun Wu Xie. His brows furrowed slightly. Apparently he did not expect that Jun Wu Xie would bring someone along to this meeting.

“My attendant.” Jun Wu Xie said.

“Today, I’m hosting a banquet yet Lord Yan brought someone else along. Is it that you worry and do not feel at ease?” Chi Yan asked.

Jun Wu Xie said, “In recent days, my followers have repeatedly met with danger. I don’t know if they have offended anyone in Sacred City. He is the only one available. It is to protect myself and also to protect him. ”

There were no fluctuations in her speech but her words were thorny. As soon as her words came out, Long Yao who was seated in the hall widened his eyes incredulously.

The Sacred City was not small and it had a lot of people. But there were few things that could escape their Knights of Destructions’ vision. Long Yao had encouraged the Top Ten Experts to provoke Jun Wu Xie. None of the people present were unclear. Now, Jun Wu Xie said these words out, wasn’t this a provocative slap to his face?

Chi Yan also glanced at Long Yao at this moment, apparently knowing what happened previously. But he did not mean to delve deeper. He just said: “Only the strong enough can be accommodated in the Sacred City. The people around Lord Yan were weak and got themselves injured. This is their destiny. Lord Yan, please sit down. ”

In his cold words, there was no slightest comfort. In Chi Yan’s eyes, Qiao Chu’s injuries were because they were weak and incompetent. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the Upper Realm where survival was the fittest, the weak could only die. Even if they die, they won’t get any sympathy.

A hint of coldness flashed by Jun Wu Xie’s eyes and she did not hide it. She walked to the empty seat and sat down. Jun Wu Yao was playing a role as a follower perfectly. He stood silently behind Jun Wu Xie. Behind Jun Wu Xie, his head was half lowered, as if he didn’t exist at all.

“Lord Yan has been to the Sacred City for quite some time. His Lord has heard that Lord Yan has great strength but as His Lord has a lot of matters to attend to it is inconvenient to meet you in person. Today, I am here to host a welcome dinner for Lord Yan. How many people does Lord Yan recognise from this banquet?” Chi Yan asked.

Jun Wu Xie sneered in her heart. What a good excuse. That Lord sitting in that high position had been busy planning his Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms all day long. He had no time to think of other matters. And this welcome banquet......

After she slayed five of the Top Ten Experts, whether this was truly a welcome banquet or one guised with the malicious intent for massacre, it was really open to question.

Although Jun Wu Xie thought so, there was no expression on her face. She raised her eyes and swept her gaze through the hall casually. At the moment when she met Long Yao’s gaze, her mouth aroused an ironic smile.

“I think besides Lord Chi Yan, I think I can only recognise Lord Long Yao.After all, we had met each other too many times in the Top Ten Experts selection. I think Lord Long Yao recognizes me as well, right?”
