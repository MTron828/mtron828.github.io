How did they do that?

They really wanted to know but they didn’t dare to ask too much at this moment.

After the battle, Luo Qingcheng who had the seeds of Blood Velvet buried in her body was sent into the dungeon by Tian Ze. The power shown by Tian Ze during the battle was already strong enough to be compared to the power of the members of the Night Regime.

And now, the expression on the remarkably handsome face of Tian Ze was showing that he was trying really hard to suppress the killing intent within him. While glaring at the back of Luo Qingcheng, it seemed like his killing intent would erupt anytime.

He would never forget that it was this person that had caused the death of Ren Huang.

“Hand her to me.” Suddenly, Su Ya walked near him without him realizing. There wasn’t any emotion shown on her gorgeous face. She was just staring at Luo Qingcheng with her eyes full of complexities.

Tian Ze slightly stunned, seemingly a bit hesitant.

If he was said to be having a bone-deep hatred towards Luo Qingcheng, then the intense hatred towards Luo Qingcheng harboured within Su Ya could be described as wanting to grind her bones into dust since not only their Master, Ren Huang was killed by Luo Qingcheng, Su Ya’s beloved, Yan Bu Gui was also killed by her.

“Senior...” Tian Ze looked at Su Ya with hesitation. Though he really wished that he was able to kill Luo Qingcheng right away, he knew that it would be too easy for her to just die like that if he couldn’t control his rage and kill her straight off.

“Don’t worry. I won’t kill her. How would I let her die so easily when she’s yet to pay back all the sins she did?” With the corners of her lips curving up, Su Ya sneered.

Tian Ze then nodded his head.

Luo Qingcheng was now in the worst state. The beauty that she once owned was now gone. There wasn’t even a piece of fine skin left on her face and all her clothes were broken and torn apart. Burnt red flesh could be seen by looking through the pieces of charred black on her skin after being stuck by the thunderbolts. With her black hair scattering messily on her back, her mangled bloody face looked even more scarier now.

As the most beautiful woman in the Upper Realm, Luo Qingcheng was once an unsurpassed beauty of the generation.

But now, who would be able to connect this indescribably ugly woman to her? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“A bunch of bitches.” With her back hunched, Luo Qingcheng stared at Su Ya who was walking in front of her with a malicious gaze in her eyes. Those Soul Binding Chains which were used on Jun Wu Yao before were now all tying on her limbs, causing her body which had just finished suffering from huge torments to worsen. Her entire body was so painful that it seemed to be ruptured at the moment.

Every step she walked was a huge torment to her.

Looking coldly at Luo Qingcheng, Su Ya didn’t reply to Luo Qingcheng’s curse.

It was until the moment Luo Qingcheng was brought to the “prison” which Jun Wu Xie had earlier prepared for her, the steadiness that she strived to maintain crumbled and collapsed.

It was a very clean and tidy “room”. There wasn’t any furniture in it except for a clean mattress. Compared to the dark prison, this room was far more better to stay.

However, the face of Luo Qingcheng drained of colour and turned pale at the mere moment.

This was because the four sides of the wall in the room were all covered with big bronze mirrors. Every single wall in the room was a huge “floor mirror”. Not only the wall was covered with mirror, but also the ceiling and the floor. One was able to see one’s reflection anytime and anywhere while staying inside the room...

Dressing herself up in front of the mirror was usually a thing that every woman would love to do, but for the Luo Qingcheng now, this had become the most horrible thing to do in this world.

“No! I’m not going into it!” Luo Qingcheng’s crackly screams echoed in the empty room. With her eyes widened in disbelief, she couldn’t actually believe what she had just seen.
