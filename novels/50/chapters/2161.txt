Chapter 2162: Long Time No See (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In the Cloudy Brook Academy, every blade of grass and wood she was once familiar with was still there, but the many faces that she knew from before were no longer there. Upon the academy’s wide main avenue, several teams of people were carrying torches while they patrolled. The closer it was to the peak, the denser the number of patrols were. And within the Cloudy Brook Academy itself, there were a guard post every ten steps, the entire place tightly guarded. If not for the fact that Jun Wu Xie used powers almost comparable to that of a Gold Spirit, it was feared that she would have exposed her location the moment she got close to the Cloudy Brook Academy.

Jun Wu Xie passed fleetingly through the darkness without anyone noticing anything. She wasn’t blindly searching aimlessly around the academy but was carefully observing every bit of movement in there.

Ye Mei had almost turned the entire Cloudy Brook Academy upside down and the only place he had not gone into was coincidentally the Spirit Mastery Faculty that Jun Wu Xie was at back then!

Jun Wu Xie had spent an uncountable amount of time with Su Ya in the Spirit Mastery Faculty and now that she had come to the outside of the Spirit Mastery Faculty, a sliver of chagrin rose up in her heart, and that sense of indignation went on to fuel the hatred she felt towards the enemy.

Even with Jun Wu Xie’s current level of power, she could not sense the presence of anyone inside the Spirit Mastery Faculty but that, fundamentally speaking, could not possibly be a fact as the inside of the Spirit Mastery Faculty was at that moment well lit with lights, and Jun Wu Xie had clearly seen from the windows the vague shadows of several people but had not been able to sense anyone inside.

As she had thought, they had kept a hand well hidden! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed. She had thought that there must be something strange with the place that Ye Mei was unable to investigate and now that she had come here herself, she was more certain that her guess was correct. People that she was unable to sense, must definitely hold powers of the Gold Spirit and above!

As far as the eye could see in the entire Middle Realm, how many Gold Spirits were there in total? Even if there were reclusive ones who hid themselves, their numbers could not possibly be more than she could count on one hand. But the number of people in that loft was clearly more than five people!

Jun Wu Xie could almost be certain that Su Ya was being hidden in the Spirit Mastery Faculty!

That thought had just risen up in her mind when Jun Wu Xie almost could not suppress the impulse to charge into the Spirit Mastery Faculty to rescue Su Ya, but she finally managed to hold herself back in the end.

Su Ya was at that moment in their hands, and if she were to charge in there recklessly, even with Jun Wu Yao beside her, the enemy would still have a chance of killing Su Ya first.

And Jun Wu Xie was not about to take Su Ya’s life as a joke!

Since those people were using Su Ya as a lure to force the little old man to show himself, it was thought that before deadline in the next three days, Su Ya would be safe.

Jun Wu Xie silently retreated back under the darkness, her cold eyes hidden under the darkness of night shining with a sinister icy glint. No matter who those people were, anyone who dared to harm her Master, would have to pay the price in blood!

Within the Cloudy Brook Academy, besides the Nine Temples’ disciples patrolling the place back and forth, some of the Nine Temples’ Elders would also pass occasionally. The went about silent without a word throughout, and even when they saw people they were on familiar terms with, they only exchanged glances. The atmosphere in the whole Cloudy Brook Academy was extremely queer, and deathly quiet.

A handsome looking man carried a wine urn in his hand and walked by on the academy’s main avenue. The elderly man by his shoulder merely nodded his head at the handsome man but did not say anything, passing each other just like that.

A sliver of a smile hooked up the corners of the man’s mouth as he went walking towards the place he was staying at.

Walking till he came beside the dark and shady trees, the man suddenly heard a faint sound. His steps slowed slightly as a unremarkable looking youth dressed in the Heavenly Wolf uniform came walking towards him. In the instant that the youth was just passing his shoulder, the man suddenly halted his step and he said.

“Hold it.”
