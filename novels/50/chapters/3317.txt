Chapter 1907: “Incoming Storm Expected (4)”

Yue Ye shrank her head back into her shoulders, looking rather bashful.

Qiao Chu immediately jumped right out.

“Little Ye, you do not have to be afraid. Although our Master looks ugly, he has a very tender heart. Oww!” The moment Qiao Chu’s words left his mouth, he was thrown to the ground by a kick from from Yan Bu Gui.

“What do you mean by I look ugly! ?” Yan Bu Gui hollered as his eyes glared fiercely. [How was he ugly! ?]

“That’s right! Our Master’s looks is termed as manly. What do you know?” Fei Yan went on to fan the flames eagerly on the side.

Qiao Chu rubbed at his sore behind and threw Fei Yan a fierce gaze.

“Grand..... Grandmaster..... Hello....” Yue Ye said timidly.

Yan Bu Gui had never seen such an adorable little fellow, that soft and mushy voice causing his heart to blossom with joy, needless to say how delighted his face had been with smiles. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Good good good. What a obedient child.”

[See here. This is what a little toddler girl should be like. Now look at the two female disciples he has under him.]

Look at Jun Wu Xie..... still so young and already so steady, who had always made Yan Bu Gui feel that he had picked up a disciple for free, without having to do a single thing.

And then look at Rong Ruo..... Yan Bu Gui clutched his hand to his chest.

In the beginning when she had just been brought in, she had also been a sensible and obedient little girl. How did she turn out like this.....

He clearly already had two females disciples already, but it was only after he saw Yue Ye that Yan Bu Gui truly understood what a female disciple should be like.

Yue Ye was still a little nervous but unfortunately for her, it was long before she was snatched away by Qiao Chu and Fei Yan to have the poor little thing address them as Uncle Master. In order to coax the imp to address them as Uncle Master, the two of them had even taken out quite a haul of things, quickly stuffing a small pile of treasures into Yue Ye’s hands.

Yue Ye had not expected to receive such a passionate welcome as she turned to look at her elder brother, a little dazed. Yue Ye nodded his head slightly at her, his eyes filled with a comforted smile.

“I had no given anything back in the Shadow Moon Palace and since you’re Wu Xie’s disciple, it will only be natural I have to show some kind of indication.” Jun Qing who had been smiling the entire time without a word suddenly opened his mouth to say, where Yue Ye then blinked her eyes blankly to come walking over to Jun Qing with her arms overflowing with gifts.

Jun Qing’s countenance had just that one tiny bit of similarity to Jun Wu Xie’s, looking handsome and gentle that did not make people nervous. He smiled charmingly, which quietly soothed the nerves in Yue Ye’s heart.

Jun Qing took out a jade pendant, and placed it in Yue Ye’s hand.

“This was originally prepared for your Master, but looking at her, I think she would have no use for it. It is now just right for you instead.” Jun Qing said with a smile.

Yue Ye stared, bedazzled by that smile.

The countenance of the Jun Family’s members were all unparalleled or Jun Wu Xie would not possess looks that could bring ruin to cities and countries, and Jun Qing was naturally the same.

Till everyone who was supposed to give her a gift had finished, nothing else could fit into Yue Ye arms anymore and she had no choice but to have Yue Yi help her carry a portion of her load.

The night grew deep and everyone went back into their rooms to rest. They knew that a big battle awaited them the next morning and they needed to preserve their energy and keep their spirit.

After everyone went back and fell into peaceful sleep, there were two people who would not be able to find peaceful rest.

In the Dragon Slayers Palace Lord’s room, the air was filled with the thick stench of blood. He sat upon a chair, a flask of strong fiery wine clasped in his hand. His bloodshot eyes were narrowed to a slit as he stared at the garishly bloodied figure tied upon the rack.

Gu Ying had been stripped of his shirt and tied to the rack, his taut chest filled with brand new wounds, hot red blood flowing out continuously from those wounds.

In just a few short hours, he already looked a completely different person from when he was taken away from the banquet. There was no sign of his lavish clothes, replaced only by wicked looking wounds covered under bright red blood.
