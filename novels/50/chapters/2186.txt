The Spirit Ring was the supreme power of the Upper Realm. Unlike spiritual power, each and every inscription contains an enormous power. The more inscriptions that can be condensed, the larger the volume of the Spirit Ring. However, to condense the Spirit Ring wasn’t a simple task.

The little old man crushed his own Spirit Ring. If he wanted to condense it again, he would require a certain time, but Ba He would never give him any time.

“Catch him.” Ba He said maliciously.

All the Gold Spirits who had retreated before immediately changed their traction and rushed towards the little old man. The little man raised his head and at the corner of his mouth a trail of fresh blood trickled down. This was caused from the backlash of crushing the Spirit Ring forcefully on his own. Although he knew that this was Ba He’s trap, but for Su Ya, he had to do this.

Ba He looked at the little old man that had offered himself up and at the bottom of his eyes he could not help but reveal a trace of anticipation.

The little old man closed both of his eyes. He was willing to do this; both Su Ya and Tian Ze had both been dragged into this because of him. He could not overlook this and simply discard them.

Just at the moment when everyone thought that the little man was going to be caught!

Boom! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A loud explosion resounded from the main hall at the side of the square!

The towering hall was completely blown up in a deafening explosion!

The white bricks were blasted apart and hurled out the broken remnants like a hail and shot right out into the square!

A glint of shock flashed by Ba He’s eyes as a huge stone flew directly towards the high platform!

He ferociously stomped his foot down and flew up!

A loud bang resounded and the large stone stood majestically on the high platform and it had smashed the wooden support of the platform.

Everyone looked at the scene completely dumbfounded, the continuous rain of stones fell upon them and everyone in the square could only dodge.

Before Ba He could figure out what had happened, there was a series of more than ten explosions that resounded one after another and the pavilions that surrounded the square had been blasted into smithereens in an instant!

Countless stones rained upon them and smashed mercilessly into the square. There were some that were wrapped in flames and as they fell onto the ground, leaving marks with sporadic flames all around!

The oppressive atmosphere in the square was suddenly broken by this sudden attack. Although they were Gold Spirits, however under such a dense hail that was raining upon them, they had to subconsciously dodge as well.

The besiege of the little old man had been hindered at this very moment!

The little old man was shocked when he saw everything unfold before him. The square was now a complete mayhem as shattered stones continued to rain down and the burning flames made everything plunge deeper into chaos. Suddenly, the little old man looked anxiously at the broken platform.

There was a figure that flashed by, but at the moment that his eyes reached it, it had already freed Su Ya from the wooden stake.

The eyes of the little old man glistened!

“All of you calm down! It’s only some broken stones, what is there to be afraid of?!” Ba He looked at the square where chaos had ensued, and with an angry roar, the noisy square regained calm in an instant. He raised his hand and a golden light appeared, immediately disintegrating the rocks flying towards him into a powder.

Those Gold Spirit also calmed down immediately, and following Ba He’s move, they knocked down the broken stones.

Let’s not say even that the Gold Spirit, let alone the Purple Spirit or the Blue Spirit, they would never be hurt by these trivial broken stones, but all this had happened too suddenly and made them lose their composure.
