Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

However arrogant and proud Wei Ya and Xie Chang Ming were before, at that moment a deep seated fear was spreading through their hearts. Once the double Spirit Rings appeared, their self confidence was shattered and they were unable to maintain their fighting spirit.

“How is it that you have... double Spirit Rings...” Luo Qingcheng fell to the ground as the wound on her shoulder was bleeding profusely. Waves of intense pain coursed through her body but it was not sufficient to erase the utter shock she had.

It was impossible!

How was it possible that Jun Wu Xie has double Spirit Rings?

If Jun Wu Xie had such an unbelievable power, then why was she defeated by Luo Qingcheng five years ago?

Luo Qingcheng refused to believe that within a span of five years, Jun Wu Xie was able to cultivate and achieved such heights. If that were true, then everyone in the Upper Realm would be a great big joke. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

A thousand years of cultivation, but yet unable to beat a girl with a mere five years of cultivation.

“You do not need to know.” Jun Wu Xie stood in front of Luo Qingcheng as she condescendingly watched the woman who once destroyed her ideal life.

If it wasn’t because of Luo Qingcheng, Great Master Ren Huang would not have commited suicide, Yan Bu Gui would not have died while protecting Su Ya, and Jun Wu Yao would not have been captured. On that day five years ago, what she experienced was like torture from the depths of hell, and today, she was going to return all that anguish to Luo Qingcheng, ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times!

Luo Qingcheng breathing began to increase with panic as she lifted her head to look at Jun Wu Xie.

Against the sun, Jun Wu Xie’s body was bathed in a golden hue, making it difficult for anyone to see her expression.

For the first time since she was born, Luo Qingcheng tasted fear. The Spirit Rings in both Jun Wu Xie’s hands were like a nightmare, shattering the confidence and arrogance that Luo Qingcheng had accumulated for the past thousand years.

Luo Qingcheng was once considered the best exponent in the Upper Realm, and her Spirit Ring was renowned as the strongest ring in existence. Her natural talents, her innate skills allowed her to be picked by her master, and after a thousand years of cultivation, trained her to be the strongest exponent in the Upper Realm, second to none. She had never been defeated, nor has she ever suffered any injuries during battle.

The pride and confidence that Luo Qingcheng has built up over the last thousand years looked exceedingly pitiful in front of Jun Wu Xie.

The appearance of the double Spirit RIngs cemented Luo Qingcheng’s defeat.

“Why didn’t you reveal the double Spirit Rings earlier? Are you making a fool of me?!” The sense of fear which Luo Qingcheng had never felt before caused her to lose her mind. She was unwilling to accept it – it was obvious that Jun Wu Xie was wounded by her before, but with a blink of an eye, their roles were reversed.

She was being played a fool with Jun Wu Xie’s deliberate omission.

Jun Wu Xie’s face still hold the calmness as before, while watching Luo Qingcheng descend into madness. “Fooling you? Sorry, I only want to see you plunge from the clouds, that’s all.” said Jun Wu Xie with indifference.

Regardless of Luo Qingcheng’s pride, what Jun Wu Xie truly wanted was not only to destroy her powers, even more than that, she wanted to crush her arrogance, just like what Luo Qingcheng did to Great Master Ren Huang.

To kill Luo Qingcheng was easy for Jun Wu Xie. But, just as how Luo Qingcheng wanted to torture her to death, how could she let Luo Qingcheng off with an easy death?

This dance of desperation was the funeral song which Jun Wu Xie had prepared for Luo Qingcheng.

“How does desperation taste?” Ju Wu Xie’s eyes slightly turned up as she admired Luo Qingcheng’s great fall from grace..
