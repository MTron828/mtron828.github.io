Chapter 3038 That Day 1

Chi Yan frowned slightly and hesitated for a moment before saying: “Yan Hai is very strong and emotionally very mature, completely unlike someone of his age. If harnessed well, such a person can be a great asset and will make us more powerful. However his violent streak makes him also very unstable. Your subordinate really hopes that he can be cleansed before participating in this operation. After all ... This operation is of great importance to His Lord, and your subordinate is not willing to disappoint you after so many years of planning. ”

The Lord chuckled softly, and his slender, beautiful fingers tapped rhythmically on the handle.

“Yan Hai is very smart and powerful and to have achieved that at his age is no accident. Your concerns are clear to me, and I understand your loyalty. But, Chi Yan, I obviously have my reasons for wanting you to set off as soon as possible and for Yan Hai to be on the operation.”

His Lord’s eyes narrowed and the smile disappeared from his face, “He and Ying’er must look for the lost temples together, they are the only ones that can find them. Do you understand?”

Chi Yan froze for a moment before a stunned expression came over his face.

The Lord leaned against the back of the chair, he crossed his legs. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I have my own reasons for doing so, I just need you to watch over them.”

“But your subordinate cannot guarantee that I can control Yan Hai’s power and as for Highness Ying....” Chi Yan’s eyebrows furrowed, he had complicated feelings towards Gu Ying.

Being His Lord’s son, Gu Ying enjoyed special treatment and even the Knights of Destruction had to give him a wide berth when they encountered him. But to Chi Yan, he did not regard Gu Ying as his master, he saw in Gu Ying’s eyes the same wild ambition that he once saw in Long Yao’s.

It was just that Gu Ying hid that ambition more thoroughly, and Gu Ying was smarter and more cunning.

“You don’t need to worry about that, I will have a way to deal with it. The only thing you need to remember is that when the lost temples are found, only the two of them are to enter. You and Ruiying cannot even place half a foot inside.” His Lord said gravely.

Chi Yan didn’t understand His Lord’s plan, but out of loyalty to His Lord, he agreed.

“Alright, it’s getting late, you should go back and get ready. Leave as soon as possible, don’t waste time.” His Lord said as he waved Chi Yan away.

Chi Yan immediately excused himself.

After Chi Yan left, a figure appeared in the hall. The man had white hair despite a very young and handsome appearance, but his eyes were those of someone who had gone through deep suffering.

“Your grace, your wish will soon be fulfilled.” That man knelt down before His Lord in a gesture so reverential that it even exceeded Chi Yan’s.

If Chi Yan had not left, he would have known that the man next to His Lord was Feng Ming, the most Divine Doctor of the Three Realms.

Feng Ming was extremely skilled in medicine, but he is the exclusive doctor of His Lord and rarely treats others. Although his strength was not high, Chi Yan and others needed to be polite when they saw him because he had the trust of His Lord.

The Lord looked at the prostrating Fen Ming and smiled, “Will it be quick? I’ve lost count of how long I’ve been waiting for that day.”
