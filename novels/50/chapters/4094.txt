Jun Wu Xie looked at Xu Zu as a piercing chill flashed by her eyes.

Xu Zu had finally managed to wipe away the shadow of Jun Wu Xie from before and he was relying on Ruan Zhongshan’s support and had mustered up the courage to blatantly show his anger in Jun Wu Xie’s face.

However, when Jun Wu Xie’s cold gaze swept over him, Xu Zu only felt that he was burned by a flame. Although Jun Wu Xie didn’t say a word, Xu Zu suddenly thought of that impetuous moment when he had recklessly explored Jun Wu Xie’s strength and suffered terribly. That fear that had been buried deep within the depths of his heart that had been forcibly suppressed by him suddenly burst forth and the mouth which was incessantly chattering just before suddenly froze. The unspoken words seemed to be stuck in his throat and he couldn’t say a word more.

When Ruan Zhongshan saw the change in Xu Zui, he was startled. Although Xu Zu was not a top master, he was also a considerable power in Long Xuan City. He had heard Xu Zu talk about Jun Wu Xie’s spirit power from before and though he was shocked, but he didn’t care much about it. He thought that after Xu Zu’s strength had risen, he should no longer be suppressed by her.

But ...

Who knew that Jun Wu Xie didn’t do anything, but simply glanced at Xu Zu with a cold glare and Xu Zu had been frightened to this extent!

This kid really had such an ability?

Ruan Zhongshan took a deep breath and the serious expression on his face suddenly eased up a bit. He raised his head as looked at Jun Wu Xie and his attitude was completely different from before.

“City Lord Yan, the words spoken before may be a little bit harsh, but all of this is for you, for the sake of Sea Spirit City. You know that Sea Spirit City is not far from our Long Xuan City, and the exchanges between our two citites can be considered quite close. It has been peaceful for many years. You have just taken over the Sea Spirit City so you may not know enough about the 72 cities and may have to be extra vigilent in some considerations when doing things. ”

“I have been in charge of Long Xuan City for many years, and I must say that I have a little experience of things between the cities. The 72 cities seem to be peaceful on the surface, but in fact, there are constant battles under that facade. If the Lord has not consolidated his forces over the years, I am afraid that the 72 cities would have already been at war with each other for a long time. Your Sea Spirit City has a shallow foundation and if it has to go against the 725 cities at this time, it is definitely not a good thing, so I also hope that you can think about it. “Ruan Zhongshan had changed his initial strong tone to a mild one instead and the sudden change left people speechless.

In fact, what Ruan Zhongshan really wanted to do was to force Jun Wu Xie to spill everything about the elixir and let her understand the possible danger of this sudden decision of Sea Spirit City. She would then have to choose to win over Long Xuan City to safeguard her city. At that time, Ruan Zhongshan would have the excuse to share the elixir’s formula.

Ruan Zhongshan was very clear that the lowly medical skills of the healers in the Sea Spirit City could not be compared with Long Xuan City. The reason why such elixir could be refined was definitely because of the formula.

Since the Sea Spirit City was able to refine it out, it would not be a problem for Long Xuan City.

What was imperative now was to let Jun Wu Xie follow his intentions and tell him the formula.

Ruan Zhongshan looked intently at Jun Wu Xie and said in a sincere tone: “I already know what you said to Xu Zu before, but this matter is no small matter. I didn’t let Xu Zu tell the other cities. As of now, only our Long Xuan City knows about the matter of severing the supply of Sea Spirit Beasts. ”
