Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

As the crowd stood dumbfounded, black flames shot up the hooves of the Flaming Bone horse that Jun Wu Yao was riding, and suddenly, it shot from the ground up to mid-air, and spirited those two eye-catching persons away.

In that instance, there were exclamations amongst the crowd.

There was no bridal sedan chair to greet the bride – which lady wouldn’t long for a husband to escort her to the wedding ceremony!

The Night Regime heard the signal as they turned aboutfoot, the end of the line becoming the start as they headed off the direction they came from, following Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie’s figures. From start to end, there was no clamouring from the Lin Palace, everyone was shocked into silence by this peculiar and aggressive wedding ceremony.

Sitting upon the fiery horse, wild winds howled and blew at Jun Wu Xie’s hair, she remained safe and quiet within Jun Wu Yao’s embrace, as she listened to the beat of his heart.

Rapid and powerful, the frequency of his heartbeat betrayed the tension of Jun Wu Yao at that moment.

Jun Wu Xie smiled at this but did not say anything.

Once which was Ghost City, now has been reconstructed into something new, and even though sunlight couldn’t poke through, but the place was lit up by countless of candles.

Fiery red foxtail lilies paved a path, the Flaming Bone horse stopped on its own at the front of the door. Within the Ghost City, it was already filled with people. Jun Xian sat at the central position as he watched the two persons dismount from the horse, a deep smile spread from the corners of his eyes.

Jun Wu Yao pulled on Jun Wu Xie’s hand, as they took steps which brought them into the line of sight of the crowd. Their steps were slow but steady, the hand which he held was his whole world.

The sounds of the celebration around him melted away from his ears, and the only thing he could hear was his own heartbeat.

Jun Wu Xie was pulled forward by Jun Wu Yao, her cold eyes fell upon his side profile and showed a trace of confusion as everything because somewhat surreal.

“You are dying.”

In that icy cold cave, the first voice that echoed through the dark as his.

[You are trapped?”

That was the first time she spoke to him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Huh? You mean these little things?”

“I release you, you save me.”

As Jun Wu Xie stared at his side profile, he could not help but think of the first time the two of them met. In the cold and darkness, between him and her, there was only a trade for survival and freedom. She lived and he attained freedom.

But unknowingly, from that moment on, they tied together inexplicably.

Suddenly, Jun Wu Xie’s steps paused.

Her paused caused Jun Wu Yao to also stop. He turned around and a pair of purple eyes just started at her unblinkingly, a little nervous, a little expectant.

“Do you remember the first thing you said to me?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly asked.

Jun Wu Yao was slightly distracted as Jun Wu Xie’s actions led the guests to be stunned. This was the biggest, most amazing wedding ceremony they have ever attended and Jun Wi Xie’s questions piqued their curiosity.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie as the surprise in his eyes turned into a smile.

His smile made his eyes squint, filled with some yearning as he said gently, “You are dying.”

That voice contained laughter and made everyone shocked.

“You are trapped?” Jun Wu Xie replied.

Jun Wu Yao lifted his hands as he curled his fingers around her soft hair.

“Huh? You mean these little things?”

“You release me, I save you.”

The strange dialogue between the two persons made everyone present confused. It was obviously so strange but unknowingly, it made the people feel some sort of indescribable sense of happiness and contentment. The meaning behind those words were something only the two of them knew.
