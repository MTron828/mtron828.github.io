Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

When Jun Wu Xie stepped into the hall, the many women who had been waiting in the hall for a long time couldn’t help but look at Jun Wu Xie. What they saw was a delicately handsome young boy but didn’t look anything special.

Having been told that the guest was of noble status and they needed to spend more effort dressing up, the women could not help but be disappointed.

The teenager in front of them was far from what they had expected.

Only Han Shu’s eyes sparkled when she saw Jun Wu Xie. If she wasn’t afraid that she would ruin her image in Jun Wu Xie’s mind, she really wished she could immediately walk up to Jun Wu Xie to show off her looks today.

“City Lord Yan.” Duan Qi walked towards Jun Wu Xie first, a rare stiff smile appeared on her serious face.

“Please sit down,” Duan Qi said.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly and sat down in her place.

Elder Yun observed what Duan Qi dubbed as the unparalleled young man in secret. From the appearance alone, she could not see anything special about him, except that his eyes were abnormally cold.

“This is Elder Yun. The other elders in the clan still have some things to deal with. After all, Lord Gu and the Sacred Maiden will be married in the next few days. Today, I am accompanied by Elder Yun. We hope City Lord Yan does not mind.” Duan Qi spoke politely, but did not dare to mention whether Han Zi Fei would be present. The message previously conveyed by Han Shu seemed to indicate that Han Zi Fei didn’t care much about today’s banquet. Duan Qi had no other choice, but in her heart, the impression of Han Zi Fei dropped even more. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Oh? The marriage is nearing. Then, is Lord Gu coming soon?” Jun Wu Xie said indifferently.

Duan Qi had long noticed that Jun Wu Xie was very concerned about Jun Gu, but she didn’t think much about it, she thought that Jun Wu Xie just wanted to win over Jun Gu, after all, the Knight of Destruction was not someone whom ordinary people could come into contact with. Even as a city lord in one of the 72 cities, one was not privy to meeting him at all.

“Lord Gu should be here in the next two days. If City Lord Yan doesn’t mind, you can always go with us to welcome Lord Gu.” Duan Qi smiled.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly, it seemed that Jun Wu Yao’s previous assessment was correct, and Jun Gu had not yet reached the Holy Mountain.

Duan Qi saw that Jun Wu Xie’s reaction was one of indifference. Naturally, he didn’t want to be snubbed despite showing good intentions so she just exchanged a glance with Elder Yun, and each took her seat. Today’s protagonist was not them.

They had arranged for Jun Wu Xie to be seated in such a way that she would be able to see all the women at the banquet today. The hall was brightly lit and the warm light made the beautiful faces more attractive. They were all anticipating finding out which one of the women had caught Jun Wu Xie’s eye.

Han Shu’s position was closest to Jun Wu Xie. Moreover, today she had specially dressed up for the banquet. She watched as Jun Wu Xie, who was sitting alone, glanced around at the other people in a calm manner.

Because the appearance of “Yan Hai” was not top-notch, coupled with his young age, and combined with Jun Wu Xie’s own petite figure, he looked like a young boy who hadn’t puberty yet. It was difficult for the women of the Sacred Maiden Tribe to associate him as the dual Spirit Rings exponent. Most of them were observing from the sidelines.

And this happened to coincide with Han Shu’s thoughts.

“City Lord Yan.” Han Shu rose up while pretending to be elegant, took a cup of wine and walked to Jun Wu Xie’s table in an enchanting manner, as she looked at Jun Wu Xie with feigned shyness and interest and said, “Before in Sea Spirit City, I had misspoken much and I asked that City Lord Yan to not blame me. I will give myself the forfeit of finishing one cup of wine as an apology for my behaviour.”
