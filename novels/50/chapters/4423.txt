Chapter 3019 Punitive expedition 1

The death of Long Yao caused an uproar in Sacred City.

When Jun Wu Xie passed this news to Qiao Chu and others, she received Chi Yan’s invitation that night to his residence for a discussion.

Jun Wu Yao accompanied Jun Wu Xie along. Before leaving, Qiao Chu and others could not help but worry. They consoled Jun Wu Xie before she left.

This was the second time Jun Wu Xie saw Chi Yan. Unlike last time, when Jun Wu Xie saw him this time round, his cold face was covered with a layer of gloom.

Su Ruiying and Jun Gu were also invited along. When they saw Jun Wu Xie, the expressions in their eyes were very different.

Chi Yan glanced at Jun Wu Xie and his previous “enthusiasm” was gone.

Jun Wu Xie sat down on the side and observed him, looking for any changes.

“Yan Hai, the reason I called you over today, you should be clear right?” Chi Yan looked sternly at Jun Wu Xie and said coldly.

Jun Wu Xie said: “Is it because of Long Yao?”

Chi Yan nodded. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Long Yao’s death exceeded everyone’s expectations. Although Chi Yan had heard about the enmity between Long Yao and Jun Wu Xie, he had never ever thought this would be the outcome. What annoyed Chi Yan was the last time when Jun Wu Xie and Long Yao were in the same house, they were each other’s eyesore. It was Long Yao’s provocation against Jun Wu Xie. Jun Wu Xie did not seem to have any reaction towards Long Yao.

This made Chi Yan unprepared. He even thought that Long Yao would continue to provoke Jun Wu Xie but he wouldn’t dare to be too overboard. He didn’t ask too much, but he didn’t expect ... The real strike was not by Long Yao. It was Jun Wu Xie instead. And ... he was killed in such a short moment!

There was simply no time to spare for anyone.

“What’s wrong?” Jun Wu Xie didn’t seem to think there was any problem with killing Long Yao. Her calm eyes did not reflect any guilt at all.

Chi Yan’s brows could not help but wrinkled, and Jun Gu on the other side could not help worrying, fearing that his daughter would have suffered a great loss.

Su Ruiying was very clever. There was no response from beginning to end, as if it was none of her business.

“Long Yao is one of the Knights of Destruction. The Knight of Destruction is directly under His Lord. This person can’t be killed just as you like to.” Chi Yan said coldly, his voice clearly showing displeasure.

Jun Wu Xie was not really a Knight of Destruction yet. Even if she had become one, there was no reason to kill other knights. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be a mess?

“I have already killed him.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Chi Yan without showing any weakness.

Chi Yan’s face became more ugly.

“The rule of ‘the strong shall prevail and the weak shall perish’ is how the Upper Realm has always been. But it seems that those with the title of Knights of Destruction are an exception. Lord Chi Yan should have informed me earlier, so that I would have known that no matter how incompetent a Knight of Destruction is, I can’t kill one. “Jun Wu Xie’s words shocked Su Ruiying.

Su Ruiying looked at Jun Wu Xie in disbelief and could not believe that such shocking words would actually be uttered in front of Chi Yan.

Wasn’t she mocking the Knights of Destruction and labelling them as incompetent?

Chi Yan’s face turned darker. He almost had an outburst several times which caused Jun Gu’s heart to tighten. Before Chi Yan spoke, Jun Gu immediately said: “Yan Hai, you are wrong, what really matters for a Knight of Destruction is not this title, but the strength and loyalty to His Lord! “
