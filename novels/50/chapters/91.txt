Chapter 92: “First Slap (3)”

No one believes that Jun Wu Xie is capable of producing the Jade Dew pill, the authenticity of it does not make a difference .

Jun Wu Xie looks at Mo Qian Yuan thinking, if Bai Yun Xian refuses to verify the pill’s authenticity, she knows how to make her do it. With Mo Qian Yuan’s intervention, she remains silent.

With Mo Qian Yuan dragging Qing Yun Clan’s name into this, Bai Yun Xian was forced to verify the pills’ authenticity. Veiled under her calm exterior, her heart fostered a deep hatred for Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qian Yuan, as no one has ever dared to speak in such a manner to her.

Bai Yun Xian smiles coldly, and opens the medicine bottle.

In the brief moment the lid is opened, a balmy fragrance permeates the air, an all too familiar smell, exactly like the Jade Dew pills scattered on the ground.

Bai Yun Xian paled, eyes widened in surprise.

“Impossible .....” As a disciple of Qing Yun Clan, Bai Yun Xian had made the Jade Dew pills countless times, and its fragrance, is deeply ingrained into her heart.

The smell from this bottle, is exactly the same?

The flabbergasted look on Bai Yun Xian made Mo Xuan Fei sit up tensed, his face darkening.

“Are you convinced?” Jun Wu Xie asks, eyebrows slightly raised, bringing her cup of tea to her mouth, slowly, calmly sipping.

“I am not done.” Bai Yun Xian answers, through gritted teeth.

Pills glistening like white jade poured from the bottle into her hand, no different from those scattered across the floor. Bai Yun Xian turned the pills over and over again in meticulous scrutiny, as a chill crept into her heart.

These are clearly Jade Dew pills!

“How could this be ......” Bai Yun Xian’s lips trembled, unable to believe herself. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Mo Xuan Fei saw the disbelief in Bai Yun Xian’s eyes and his heart sank. He hurriedly jumps to his feet, and insinuates: “Even though the appearance and smell do have similarities, the pills are after all fake. Rest assured Yun Xian, for the insolence Jun Wu Xie has shown you and the disrespect to Qing Yun Clan, justice will be meted out.”

I will not allow Bai Yun Xian to admit the authenticity of those Jade Dew pills!

Bai Yun Xian looked blankly at Mo Xuan Fei, before it dawned on her.

That’s right, it is up to her to say whether those Jade Dew pills are real or fake. If she proclaims them fake, they will be deemed fake, irregardless of authenticity.

Bai Yun Xian composed herself, putting up her usual cold front.

“Miss Jun, these are not Jade Dew pills of the Qing Yun Clan.”

“I see now what disciples of Qing Yun Clan are like.” said Jun Wu Xie as she threw a bitingly frosty glance at Bai Yun Xian who was struggling to maintain her forced facade of calm.

Bai Yun Xian felt chilled from those eyes.

“If they are not Jade Dew pills, what are they?” Jun Wu Xie asked, head tilted slightly, staring at Bai Yun Xian.

“They are just some spices, can’t even call them medicine.” said Bai Yun Xian stiffly.

“Oh?” Jun Wu Xie questioned as her eyes flashed.

“Miss Jun, trying to pass off these inferior imitations as the real deal, I must say I have been rather slighted.” Bai Yun Xian Jun intoned seeing Jun Wu Xie’s silence, confident the situation is under her control.

Jun Wu Xie sat calmly stroking the little black cat. Bai Yun Xian was about to continue on her tirade when Jun Wu Xie murmured: “I sent a bottle to His Majesty.”

Bai Yun Xian stood with her mouth agape, twitching.

What did she say!

“By now, the Imperial Doctors who should have verified it’s authenticity, and sent it to His Majesty.” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes, watching the paled and stiffened face of Bai Yun Xian.

Bai Yun Xian’s stood lips trembling, reeling from the shock.

Mo Xuan Fei’s face darkened, he never would have imagined, Jun Wu Xie hid such a hand!
