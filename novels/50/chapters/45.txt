Chapter 46: “It’s a Small World (1)”

“The difference...ahhh... The difference” the unkempt youth wailed in anguish as the difference in patrons was apparent.

“You want those Eastern Pearls?” Jun Wu Xie pointed to the Eastern Pearls on display.

The youth nodded.

As she weaved her way through the crowd to get to the front, she was surprised to find two familiar figures standing within the crowd.

A handsome young man dressed in a grand brocade with a beautiful young maiden dressed in elegant white robe by his side stood before the stall. This attractive couple was was eye catching as people kept sneaking glances to admire them. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“This place has some good stuff.” The young man said gently as his almond eyes were glued to his lady companion.

The lady simply nodded with an air of arrogance.

The little black cat which was by Jun Wu Xie’s side went ballistic. It’s fur stood on ends as it hissed.

[That adulterous couple!]

The couple was precisely Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian.

Jun Wu Xie casually glanced over without much response.

“These two Spiritual Gems as well as these nine Eastern Pearls are quite something!” Mo Xuan Fei chirped. Ever since that incident, Bai Yun Xian had been very gloomy and never smiled. He had tried all means and ways to make her smile but nothing had worked when he suddenly thought of Ghost City. With all its novelties and rare items, he was sure he could find something to cheer her up with!

After strolling about Ghost City for quite sometime, Bai Yun Xian was not moved. She was Qing Yun Clan Sovereign’s disciple! What rare things had she not seen?

They had combed almost the whole market place when she finally found something that caught her interest.

Each spiritual gem was barely the size of of her pinky finger nail however it was considered big and it was filled to the brim with spiritual energy as both of their contractual spirits had reacted to it.

The nine Eastern Pearls made even a prince of a state sigh as Mo Xuan Fei looked at them with admiration. Such exquisite quality Eastern Pearls in the Imperial Treasure Vault were very rare.

“These nine Eastern Pearls are a perfect fit for the crown that I’ve specially prepared for you. Do you like them?” He nudged her tenderly as he looked into her eyes, seeing if she understood the hidden meaning behind his words.

Bai Yun Xian nodded coyly as she finally let out a smile.

While this couple continued their flirty exchange, the crowd was busy whispering amongst themselves and spun some tales of their own. Everyone around them had long known who this infamous couple was.

Previously when Mo Xuan Fei and Jun Wu Xie were officially engaged, Mo Xuan Fei had been the subject of sympathy. Everyone had pitied him and empathized with him. However now that he was together with Bai Yun Xian, he became the object of jealousy and hate as people around stared at him enviously.

Jun Wu Xie was notoriously known throughout as a tyrant. Although she was as beautiful as a flower, her personality and actions had overshadowed her looks. Not many could stand that fiery temper of hers!

Bai Yun Xian was completely different, not only was she beautiful, she exuded an aura of a celestial being with her gentle demeanour and soft spoken manner. To top it off, she was Qing Yun Clan Sovereign’s disciple! No matter what, she was the goddess of many men and when news was out that Mo Xuan Fei and her were together, it aroused the animosity all around.

People respected Bai Yun Xian all the more when they saw her in real life and berated Jun Wu Xue as they chattered among themselves.

Word for word, all these had been heard by Jun Wu Xie but she remained calm and collected. Not a single reaction or expression could be seen.

Instead, the little black cat standing by her lost all its patience and saw red. All it wanted to do now was to charge at all these imbeciles standing before it and wipe them all out! It hissed menacingly.

[What do these imbeciles know?! How can they even compare that woman with my Mistress?]
