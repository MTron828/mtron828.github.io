“Don’t worry, we won’t do anything reckless. We will follow whatever said by you and Big Brother Wu Yao.” Qiao Chu promised as he patted his chest.

There was a faint smile emerging from the bottom of Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

Yeah, who would care if it was the Upper Realm?

As long as her friends and her beloved were by her side, was there still any obstacle in this world that they could not cope with?

...

At the same time, in the Upper Realm.

There were few big tall men kneeling on the ground outside the main hall. Though they had cool expressions on their faces, cold sweat was running down their foreheads.

There wasn’t any brightness coming out from the dark hall. There was no way they were able to observe the situation inside the hall clearly.

Those people outside the hall were all enshrouded in a depressing atmosphere. Every single one of them was able to feel the huge pressure that was pressing on them. Nangong Lie too, was kneeling in the line with his head down, not making a sound.

“There’s still no news from Qingcheng yet?” A low deep voice came from the main hall.

“My Lord... Not yet...” A man outside the hall responded carefully.

A few months ago, Luo Qingcheng, together with Wei Ya and Xie Changming, had led five hundred thousand Gold Spirits into the Lower Realm with the purpose of taking back the soul bone from Jun Wu Xie, but as the time passed day by day, no message was sent from the troops, and this made them a little anxious.

Even if the power of the forces brought by Luo Qingcheng wasn’t said to be able to give the Lower Realm an instant kill, there was still no doubt that they had the ability to overwhelm them.

At first, they thought that they were able to receive the news of victory half a month ago, but none of them would know that...

Up till today, not even a strand of hair could be seen. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was as if the five hundred thousand forces were being thrown into the bottomless and boundless sea, not even a wave was surged. Noticing the situation, they were truly surprised.

“May... Maybe there’s something that has gotten them delay, or it could be that the people in the Lower Realm are too tricky, I believe that there will be some news if we wait for a little longer,” said a man with cautious tone.

It was a complete silence inside the main hall. The deadly silence had caused everyone’s heart to pound faster.

Except for Nangong Lie, it was all numb on his face.

Were we really going to get the news we wanted if we waited any longer?

Ha...

After a long time, there came the voice again from the hall.

“Gu Ying.”

As the voice came, a dark figure walked out from a corner outside the hall. The good-looking man tripped towards the hall with an innocent and hearty smile on his face. Under the astonished eyes of those men, he then stood still in front of the hall.

“Your subordinate is here.” With a smile in the corners on his lips, Gu Ying slightly bent his waist forward and bowed politely.

The expressions of those men became a little weird after they saw Gu Ying, some were putting on a disdaining face while some were holding onto a fearful expression on their faces. They hid their expressions very well, not letting the person beside them to notice any changes in their faces.

“You said that you had fought against Jun Wu Xie before this?” There was a slight speculation in the voice.

“Yes,” answered Gu Ying.

“In your opinion, how is her strength?”

Gu Ying narrowed his pair of eyes while a figure that he could never forget in his life and a pair of cold but observant sharp eyes appeared in his mind.

“In terms of strength, she can’t be considered as the top, but her means to take actions are brilliant. She’s kind of a rare genius and she’s really good at utilizing every beneficial conditions to defeat an expert.” It was not hard to notice the acknowledgment of Gu Ying for Jun Wu Xie from his words.

“Qingcheng and the others haven’t sent us any message until now. What do you think about this matter?” The person in the hall asked again.

With his lips curving up, Gu Ying gave out a sneer. He glanced over those people who were kneeling on the ground and said presumptuously. “My Lord, I don’t think we need to wait anymore.”

“Oh?”

“The fact that there isn’t any news heard from Luo Qingcheng them only shows one result.”

“What is it?”

“They have already lost the battle.”
