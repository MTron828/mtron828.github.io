“Intentionally let go? Why? Is Sea Spirit City not afraid of the news being leaked and getting besieged?” Ah Da didn’t understand even more. For Sea Spirit City, the news leak was not a good thing. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zheng Weilong shook her head. “I had some doubts previously, but now I understand. Whether it is the supply of Sea Spirit Beasts being cut off or the news of the elixir being leaked to Ruan Zhongshan, all these things have been meticulously planned by the Sea Spirit City Lord. Even the confrontation with Long Xuan City this time, and the escape of those soldiers are all part of his grand plan.”

“How is this possible? Why would the Lord of Sea Spirit City do this?” Ah Da was slightly startled as Zheng Weilong’s guess was a bit too frightening.

Zheng Weilong said: “You just witnessed the battle. With the strength of Sea Spirit City, there would have been no difficulty in encircling all the enemy soldiers. Since Yan Hai dared to oppose Ruan Zhongshan in this way, I don’t believe it he will ignore those deserters. So, I suspect that all this is deliberately arranged by him. He wants to let the news of the elixir be leaked and let everyone know how strong this elixir is, such that a weak city like Sea Spirit City can destroy Long Xuan City’s army. ”

Zheng Weilong revealed all her predictions in one go. Since the time that Jun Wu Xie deliberately let Ruan Zhongshan off, she had detected something weird. And with the connection she made of the battle today, those inextricable parts were made clear.

“What exactly does Yan Hai want to do? Doesn’t he know how dangerous this will be? Does he really have the ability to go against all of the 72 cities? He has already cut off the supply of the Sea Spirit Beasts, and that has caused a lot of dissatisfaction among the cities. If the news of today’s battle broke, Sea Spirit City will soon become the target of more criticism.” The more Ah Da thought about it, the more he couldn’t understand. He believed Zheng Weilong and her judgment would not be wrong. But... This was really incredible.

“Perhaps ... that’s what he wants.” Zheng Weilong’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a strange gleam flashed in her eyes.

“I think ... I may have found an opportunity.” Zheng Weilong’s face suddenly burst into a smile, and she walked towards the gates of Sea Spirit City. As she stepped on the blood stained soil, she had also embarked on a path of no return.

Ah Da was dazed for a moment but immediately followed Zheng Weilong into the Sea Spirit City. This time, they did not sneak in, but walked openly into the gates.

Even though they had just finished battle, the two guards, who stood by the city’s gates, did not search Zheng Weilong and Ah Da and allowed them into the city.

Zheng Weilong headed towards the City Lord manor and stood outside the main door. She could still sense the bloody smell from the battle on the guards outside the residence, but their faces did not have any blood from the battle.

Zheng Weilong took a deep breath, raised her hand and knocked on the gates that would change her life.

The door was opened a moment later. Ye Sha, who had stepped on Xu Zu’s head outside the city, had changed into clean clothes. He looked at Zheng Weilong with a hint of question in his eyes.

“I am Zheng Weilong from the Discerning Moon City. And I seek an audience with Lord Yan Hai.”
