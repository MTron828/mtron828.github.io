Wu Jiu took a deep breath and the expression on his face turned to look a little hard pressed, but very quickly, he regained back the smile from before.

“No need for that. I was only joking with you. I am naturally just as respectful of Master as you. Men, escort Master back to get some rest.”

Jiang Yun Long immediately arranged for people to bring the previous Spirit Master away. The previous Spirit Master was unwilling to leave, as he could not leave Nalan Shan here alone, a lone wolf in this place.

“Master, I will be fine. You go back first.” Nalan Shan said earnestly as he held the previous Spirit Master’s hand.

The Spirit Master was still unwilling but he was dragged away by several human spirits. Although he possessed a great set of powers, but as Wu Jiu had restrained him with Soul Binding Chains, he was unable to summon up any of it.

Nalan Shan watched longingly as the previous Spirit Master was dragged away but he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart as with the previous Spirit Master brought away from the place, he would be safe. Wu Jiu would not dare to lay a hand on the previous Spirit Master before everyone here.

Nalan Shan stood up and stared at Wu Jiu who was all smiles, a subtle change coming over his entire person and demeanor.

“My good junior, you have really come forward by yourself as I have expected. I really do not know whether I should say that you’re too honest or just dumb. Do you think that by coming here yourself, you will be able to ensure that that beast will be safe? As long as you are here, it will come here sooner or later.” Wu Jiu looked at Nalan Shan with a smile. He had never thought much about Nalan Shan’s gentle and passive disposition. He waved his hand and Jiang Yun Long immediately stepped forward, a set of Soul Binding Chains in his hands.

No matter how powerful a spirit’s power of the spirit was, once they were shackled by these Soul Binding Chains, they would not be able to free themselves, where their power of the spirit would be sealed up, impossible to summon.

The previous Spirit Master had been caught off guard when Wu Jiu had clamped those Soul Binding Chains on his wrists and affected by the Soul Binding Chains, he had naturally not been Wu Jiu’s match where he was then captured.

Nalan Shan calmly looked at Jiang Yun Long as he walked to come before him.

The corners of Jiang Yun Long’s mouth were tinged with a venomous smile. Back when Nalan Shan had managed to escape before, he had felt highly indignant. Now that Nalan Shan had fallen into his hands once again, he was naturally overcome with glee.

“Uncle Master, do you want me to put these Soul Binding Chains on you or do you want to do it yourself?” Jiang Yun Long asked as he shook the Soul Binding Chains gleefully, looking every inch like a vile scoundrel who managed to get his way.

Nalan Shan laughed out loud scornfully, and then turned to look at Wu Jiu.

“Wu Jiu, the reason you want to capture me is merely for you to catch the Spiritual Bear. Do you really think that your ploy will succeed?”

Nalan Shan’s words immediately caused the surrounding Beast Spirits who were watching to quake in shock, their incredulous eyes suddenly turning to fall upon the figure of Wu Jiu.

Wu Jiu had already guessed that Nalan Shan would say that. Unflustered, he went on to say nonchalantly: “Nalan Shan, your way of seeking to drive a wedge between me and the Beast Spirits isn’t all that new at all. I’m sure the appearance of the brown bear I am seeking to capture has been clearly seen by the Beast Spirits outside the Spiritual Spirit Loft back then. In order to protect it, you are insisting that it is the Spiritual Bear. Are you thinking that the Beast Spirits are all idiots? Which Spiritual Bear would be so barbaric looking with such a wretched coat of brown fur, where it was not even capable of human speech and did not possess unmatched powers.”

The astounded Beast Spirits then quietened down a bit. The incident back at the Spiritual Soul Loft had been witnessed by fellow spirits of their race and they had confirmed that Wu Jiu’s target was a brown bear that did not possess much power. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Nalan Shan then laughed disdainfully and said: “Are you certain that that is not the Spiritual Bear?”

Wu Jiu then said highly confidently.

‘It’s naturally not. The Spiritual Bear is the spiritual leader of the Beast Spirits and commands an equivalent standing with that of Flame Dragon. Could I possibly be so ignorant? Moreover, such an absolutely maniacal thing like capturing the Spiritual Bear is something I will never do. The Beast Spirits are my friends and how could I possibly do something that will let my friends down?”
