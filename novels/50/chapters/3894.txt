Chapter 2490: Bloody Hunt (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Along the sailing route, the surface of the sea that was originally calm was full of carcasses. It was as if the huge dead bodies had been abused, there wasn’t even a complete body seen on the sea. Those huge creatures that Qiao Chu and the others had never seen before were just floating wretchedly on the bloody sea with only a small part of their remaining bodies exposed in the air.

One... after another...

They stood there stunned, looking at the large amount of carcasses on the sea.

Within a short moment, the number of carcasses on both sides of their boat that they had passed through had gone up to hundreds!

If it wasn’t for such large amount of slaughters, how would the sea in this region turn bloody red?!

“What the hell are they trying to do?” Rong Ruo couldn’t stop retching. While looking at the startling Hell of Asura, her face was scarily pale.

“Hunting. They might have found a group of Sea Spirit Beasts. In order to hunt all the beasts down, they couldn’t bother to collect these bodies. After they have killed all the beasts, they would follow the trails of their blood back and collect these bodies,” said Jun Wu Yao with his eyes staring at the bloodied sea.

While glancing over those dead beasts, Jun Wu Xie didn’t look good on her expression.

Sometimes, there would be some heads floating on the surface of the sea, causing Jun Wu Xie to be able to see the appearance of the beasts clearly.

It looked like a dragon. It seemed like the green scales that were attached on its body were still shining with coloured glaze. The colour of pale green was very beautiful. The milky white antlers weren’t sharp at all; they looked like the antlers of an elk, slightly curved and round. Such creatures should be one of the stunning views under the ocean. Even though Jun Wu Xie had never seen them before, she felt that creatures like these weren’t ferocious living things.

But those eyes that were reflecting to the little waves of the sea water were now soaking in the blood, dull and gloomy.

“Ask Ye Sha to adjust the sailing direction. We’ll head around here.” After staying silent for a while, Jun Wu Yao ordered.

Before entering the Upper Realm, he wasn’t planning to fight with the people from the Upper Realm here.

Not making a sound, Fan Zhuo went to find Ye Sha.

Whereas the other people who were on the deck remained quiet while looking at the scene.

The sanguinary picture seemed to be the first shock given to them by the Upper Realm.

Brutal and bloodied.

“What’s that!” Suddenly, Rong Ruo’s eyes locked on the carcass of a Sea Spirit Beast on the sea.

Jun Wu Xie immediately looked over the direction pointed.

A vigorously struggling bloody object could be faintly seen from the ripped stomach of the dead body of the Sea Spirit Beast.

It was almost in an instant, Jun Wu Xie transformed the Face of Selvan into an armor and straight away flew towards the direction pointed by Rong Ruo after a pair of wings were formed on the armor.

The moment she landed on the huge body and saw the small little red figure in a close distance, her heart gave out a sudden tremble.

All the people on the deck were staring at the act of Jun Wu Xie. They saw Jun Wu Xie entered the stomach of the Sea Spirit Beast, seemingly to be searching for something. After a few moments, she flew back to the deck with a round bloody object in her arms.

Jun Wu Xie landed on the deck, only then everyone was able to see clearly that it was actually a beautiful little creature curling itself up on Jun Wu Xie’s hands. Although its body was covered with blood, it was still unable to hide its beauty. It was just a small little one with its whole body covered with pale green scales. There were two thumb sized milky white antlers on its forehead. With just a glance, it looked exactly like a baby dragon, but four of its claws weren’t sharp. Its back was grown with a pair of thin and flappy wings, sticking tightly onto its back. Its wings were almost transparent, wetted by the blood. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

With a pair of big eyes widened in terror, it looked at the people around it.
