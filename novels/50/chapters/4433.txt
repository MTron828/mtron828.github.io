Chapter 3029 Chaotic Memory 2

Looking at Jun Wu Yao’s painful expression, Jun Wu Xie’s heart lifted up instantly.

“This place, I’ve been here ...” Jun Wu Yao held his forehead, his temples swelled, and the fragmentary pictures were too cluttered. He couldn’t keep his head clear.

Seeing Jun Wu Yao’s situation getting worse and worse, Jun Wu Xie decided to leave temporarily. She took Jun Wu Yao’s hand and went all the way back .

When he returned to the room, Jun Wu Yao’s condition still did not improve. Jun Wu Xie touched his forehead. The high temperature surprised her, but when she looked at his pulse, there was nothing abnormal.

Jun Wu Yao almost fell into an unconscious state, lying on the bed. His eyes were closed and his brow frowned deeply.

In Jun Wu Xie’s mind, he kept thinking about the words of Jun Wu Yao.

He said that he had been to the underground palace before. But when did he go?

Jun Wu Xie had no way to ask. She could only sit quietly beside the bed, watching Jun Wu Yao in pain.

When the first ray of sunlight reached the earth, Su Ruiying walked out of her room with a pair of tired eyes. Last night, she failed to close her eyes. She was worried that Jun Wu Xie would deal with her. She went out early in the morning, highly vigilant as she cautiously scanned her surroundings. After ascertaining with the ghoul masked man that Jun Wu Xie did not have any special movements last night, she was slightly relieved.

It’s a pity that Su Ruiying had no time to breathe when the ghoul masked man suddenly said that the follower of Jun Wu Xie was sick and that Jun Wu xie had requested for Su Ruiying to have a look.

No matter how unwillingly Su Ruiying was, she was still not a doctor. What’s the point of her having a look?

However, the fear in her heart made Su Ruiying hurry over.

Upon entering the room, Jun Wu Xie was sitting by the bed and the follower was lying on the bed quietly. Su Ruiying tried hard to make her face look calmer.

“Yan Hai, how is your follower sick? Do you need me to ask the doctor to come?” Su Ruiying asked.

Jun Wu Xie slowly raised her eyes, looked at Su Ruiying and shook her head slightly. “It’s not a big problem. Lady Ying, please come over. There are some words that I want to ask you.”

Su Ruiying’s face stiffened. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“What’s the matter?”

Jun Wu Xie didn’t speak directly, and looked at the chair aside.

“Why is Lady Ying so nervous, aren’t you going to sit down and talk?”

Su Ruiying sat down uncomfortably, seemingly calm. But in fact, she felt as if she was sitting on a bed of needles. She was waiting for Jun Wu Xie to speak, but Jun Wu Xie didn’t seem to be in a hurry. After she sat down, Jun Wu Xie’s gaze fell on the bed and was in deep thoughts.

The time ticked by and the uneasiness in Su Ruiying’s heart continued to deepen in such silence. When her inner fear reached its peak, Jun Wu Xie finally opened her mouth.

“How long has Lady Ying followed His Lord?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said, her eyes swept lightly by the incense burner beside her.

Su Ruiying was stunned slightly as she subconsciously replied: “Thousands of years, too long, and I ... can’t remember.”

“So long? But before, why hasn’t anyone heard of the Knights of Destruction? Or this only rumoured around in the past thousand years?” Jun Wu Xie asked very naturally.

Su Ruiying vaguely thought that the question of Jun Wu Xie’s was a little strange, but she didn’t know what was going on.
