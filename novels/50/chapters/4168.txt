Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Bai Zhu was trying to outcast Nangong Yan. Everyone could hear it.

However, Nangong Yan was blackmailed and he didn’t have the courage to retaliate.

Nangong Lie’s fierce gaze turned towards Nangong Yan. His last trace of gratitude to Nangong Yan was gone.

Nangong Yan was very experienced and deep in his calculations. He had seen the talent of Nangong Lie since he was a child. He did not deliberately suppress it like Yan Wan. Instead, he was very kind to Nangong Lie since he was young. It was commendable even though Nangong Lie knew that Nangong Yan had the intention to make use of him. He would still faintly imagine that there might still be a trace of father-son feeling between them.

As a result, after Nangong Lie became one of the the top ten masters. He also took great care of Blazing Flame City. It was because of his support that Blazing Flame City had a strong backup to fight against White Night City.

Now Nangong Yan had ruined everything, crushing the last of hope in Nangong Lie’s heart! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It’s a rumor, but why take it seriously.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

The sharpness in Nangong Lie’s eyes also slightly converged, and he said, “Yan Cheng said that there are many people who like to spread rumours around. Days have been spent too leisurely that people start talking nonsense. They should be careful of what they are saying.. ”

Nangong Yan shivered when those words were obviously meant for him.

None of the people could understand the threat in Nangong Lie’s words. They had realized that the largest chip in the Blazing Flame City was gone. Nangong Lie had decided to break bonds with Nangong Yan. But by losing Blazing Flame City, they were afraid that he would no longer have the power to fight back.

But...

When Blazing Flame City lost the biggest power, Sea Spirit City gained a strong backing.

Nangong Lie’s words were cold, but he was extremely polite towards Jun Wu Xie. Even the blind could see that respect, compared with that towards Nangong Yan.

The relationship between Nangong Lie and Jun Wu Xie made everyone curious.

Didn’t Nangong Lie bring people to fight against Sea Spirit City?

Why did the people in the five cities die and Nangong Lie shifted to support Jun Wu Xie?

A huge question hovered in everyone’s head, but they were not stupid enough to ask about it. Not to mention that Nangong Lie’s identity would not allow them to question. Jun Wu Xie’s capability and the strength of Sea Spirit City were enough to shut them up.

“This is good, this is good, I’m so foolish, and punishes himself by drinking three cups.” Bai Zhu can be said to be the biggest winner. He was watching Nangong Yan eating. He was happier than anyone else. Anyway, he did not offend both Jun Wu Xie and Nangong Lie. He was naturally happy.

Bai Zhu drank three glasses of wine in a happy mood and sat down.

Contrary to Bai Zhu’s smile, Nangong Yan’s face almost turned black.

Having offended one of the top ten masters, even one of the top ten cities and could not stand against it.

Nangong Yan had never expected that he would shame himself in front of other City Lords and ended up putting himself against Jun Wu Xie and offend her!

While everyone was wondering how Nangong Lie was going to end this with Nangong Yan, members of the Ghost Army charged in hurriedly into the banquet. They kneeled down on one knee before Jun Wu Xie.

“Reporting City Lord, a guest has arrived.”
