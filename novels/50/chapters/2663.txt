Chapter 2664: Believe It Or Not, It’s Up To You（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

After Xu Zu and his people left the Sea Spirit City, they rode with whip and spur to Long Xuan City without wasting any time along the journey, and finally arrived at the city gate of the Long Xuan City after travelling for several days and nights.

Xu Zu straight off urged his horse and rushed into the city. He then leapt off the horse outside the official residence of the Long Xuan City and walked into the building.

Compared to the Sea Spirit City that was built at the seacoast, not only the area covered by the Long Xuan City was wide, everything inside the city was also way more prosperous. The people who were walking here and there in the city were all wearing colourful and luxurious clothes. The whole city was divided into two regions, where one was the “Rich Area”, which belonged to the Gold Spirits, whereas the other one was the “Poor Area”, a place where the plebeian people with poor strength lived. Both the two regions were parted clearly, that normal people weren’t allowed to step into the Rich Area besides working time. Except for doing the dirtiest and the most exhausting work, they didn’t even have the right to walk on the streets of the Rich Area.

Although the Long Xuan City wasn’t considered that powerful among the seventy-two cities, it was still better than the Sea Spirit City. Its City Lord, Ruan Chongshan, had been holding onto the position for thousands of years, which it could be considered a really long duration among the other City Lords in the seventy-two cities. Although every City Lord was the apex in their respective cities, it still couldn’t deny the fact that there will always be talented people born in this mortal land every age, and there surely would be one day where they were surpassed by the others, being taken down from the position of the City Lord.

Ruan Chongshan certainly had his own ways and capabilities for him to be able to work as the City Lord of the Long Xuan City for such a long time.

Xu Zu entered the city palace in a hurry pace. Inside the palace was interspersed with halls, pavilions, and lofts. There were clouds of flowers decorating all over the place. Even the maids who were sweeping the floor of the corridor were prettier than one after another, it was just that Xu Zu had no thoughts in admiring those beautiful maidens now.

“Xu Zu, you’re back?” The majordomo of the city palace said with a smile on his face when he saw Xu Zu.

“Is the City Lord there? His subordinate here has something urgent to talk to him!” said Xu Zu quickly.

The steward responded, “The City Lord is now having flower viewing with the Young Miss from the Discerning Moon City. If you have anything urgent, I’ll inform the City Lord.”

Stunned, Xu Zu was startled by the news.

Different from the Long Xuan City and the Sea Spirit City which were located at the outlying area, the Discerning Moon City was located near the middle part of the Upper Realm. With countless experts living in the city, the powerfulness of the Discerning Moon City ranked really high among the seventy-two cities.

Normally, such a strong city like the Discerning Moon City wouldn’t even bother to interact with cities of such level like the Long Xuan City, but... Xu Zu had been to the Sea Spirit City for just a period of half a month, he was then told about this news when he returned. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The Young Miss from Discerning Moon City... why is she here?” Heart heavily pounding, the yearning he had for the stronger city could hardly make him calm himself down. If it wasn’t for him worrying that the majordomo would find something wrong about him and report it to Ruan Chongshan, how Xu Zu wished he could immediately rush forward and made his appearance in front of the Young Miss from the Discerning Moon City.

“Seems like it’s something about the Sea Spirit Beast, but I’m not sure about the details,” replied the majordomo.

While being fully aware that there were things which he had no place to ask further about it, Xu Zu didn’t insist on getting to the bottom of the matter. Instead, he had chosen to change the topic of the conversation, “I have something about the Sea Spirit City to report to the City Lord. This is really urgent, please help me to inform the City Lord.”

After nodding his head, the majordomo immediately turned and went into the backyard, leaving Xu Zu alone in the fronthall to wait for him.

Few moments later, the majordomo returned to the fronthall and told Xu Zu, “The City Lord said that he’ll be waiting for you in the study room, I’ll bring you there now.”

“Sorry to trouble you,” said Xu Zu in a respectful manner as he followed the majordomo to Ruan Chongshan’s study room.

The moment Xu Zu passed by one of the side yards which was located in the backyard, a silvery laugh came into his ears, leading him in subconsciously wanting to raise his head up...
