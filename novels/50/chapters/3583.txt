Chapter 2178: Bloody Battle at the Summit of Mount Fu Yao (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

That once beautiful and alluring face was now covered with countless wounds. Lacerations deep enough to even see the bones were slashed across her cheeks, and seeing the raw flesh and blood that had upturned slightly made people feel their blood curdle from the depths of their heart.

That woman’s arm was hanging weakly, as a piece of white bone was jutting out of her elbow...

Without question, she had been tortured to a breaking point and it seemed that with just one touch, her fragile life would be snuffed out. But in that woman’s eyes, you can’t find a single thread of fear or sorrow. In that pair of bright eyes, it was full of arrogance and disdain. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Su Jing Yan stood among the elders of the Nine Palaces. When he saw the appearance of the woman with his own eyes, his heart could not help but tremble.

That woman wasn’t any stranger, it was the very Su Ya who had been caught by the Upper Realm!

Since the day that Su Ya was caught, other than seeing her on the first day, the people from the Nine Temples never had the chance to see her again. Until today, Su Jing Yan still remembers that she remained proud despite being captured. She was not at all like a prisoner who had been defeated at the hand of others.

However, the Su Ya of that day and her today, was completely different. Just looking at the countless wounds on Su Ya’s entire body, Su Jing Yan could already guess what Su Ya suffered what kind of torture in the hands of the Upper Realm. That pair of slender and beautiful hands, had now been twisted and contorted that the original shape of her fingers could not even been recognized and they were just hanging weakly.

How much pain did she have to endure?!

Su Jing Yan took in a deep breath, even knowing that Su Ya fell into the hands of the Upper Realm, he knew that she wouldn’t have it easy but seeing her today, it made Su Jing Yan scared witless, such a heavy injury, wasn’t it enough to kill a person? The reason why Su Ya could live to this day definitely was not the people from the Upper Realm being merciful but they must have used some special methods to keep her life hanging by a single line.

Such a wound, even if she survives, she would be left with a disability that she cannot recover from for life. Such a startling beautiful woman was tortured into such an appearance.

At this moment, Su Jing Yan was mortified at the cruelty of the Upper Realm.

Su Ya was taken to the stone statue, where the high platform with a cross wooden frame had already been set up, and that high platform was filled with dry wood.

“Go up.” A black robed man barked as he impatiently looked at the unkempt Su Ya, and there was not a trace of pity in his eyes.

Su Ya glanced at the man calmly as her cracked mouth lifted into a sneer, but the smile made her unhealed wound split again and blood started to trickle from the corner of her mouth as the crimson fresh blood made her look extremely devilish!

Su Ya looked at the execution ground prepared for her. She did not hesitate one bit but raised her wounded feet and stepped up the ladder.

The black robed man tied her to the wooden frame and poured a bucket of oil from the top of her head until she was completely soaked in it. He then left the platform and moved away from the long ladder. A dozen black robed men with torches surrounded the platform. There were also traces of oil on the dry wood piled up under the elevated frame. It was apparent that they had been poured over similarly with oil beforehand.

Although there were a dozen torches, in such a scenario, even if a small spark fell on it, it would cause a fire and burn everything in an instant.

Su Jing Yan looked at it all furtively as his gaze rested at the man standing in front of the black robed men. That man had a towering stature with an imposing disposition and on his eyebrows there was a scar.
