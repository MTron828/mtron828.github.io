Chapter 2568: Meng Qiu (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Since Jun Wu Yao had come, maybe he would have the solutions to save the current Soul World!

At this moment, Qin Song had already forgotten the conflict that existed between Jun Wu Yao and the Soul World. Compared to the fate of the Spirit Tree, everything didn’t seem to be that important anymore.

“It’s simple,” said Jun Wu Yao.

Qin Song’s eyes immediately lit up, even Long Jiu was looking at Jun Wu Yao with a blazing gaze.

They were waiting.

They were all waiting for the very last hope to descend.

“The Contemporaneous Knot, as the name suggests, it’s the sharing of fate between two individuals. The one who casts the knot is able to totally seal off the energy of the one who is being knotted, and they will share the same wounds and injuries. It’s not hard to remove the seal. One just needs to bury the soul entity who has cast the knot, into the soul that has been cast with the knot.” In a flat tone, Jun Wu Yao stated. This was a rare seal, and its sealing progression was long and complicated. Not a single mistake was allowed to make while carrying out the sealing.

And once the knot was cast, there would be certain risks that both the individuals would need to take on. Even Meng Qiu would need to bear the huge danger after he cast the knot on the Spirit Tree, which if there was someone else who had injured the Spirit Tree beforehand, then Meng Qiu would also have to suffer the same damage.

Moreover, once the seal was activated, Meng Qiu too, had no way to stop it.

He truly went all in on this matter.

“Lord Ye Jue! Please! Save the Spirit Tree!!” How Qin Song wished that he was able to get out of the Soul Prison immediately, not for the others but just for Jun Wu Yao to agree to lend them his hand to save the Spirit Tree.

“If I don’t want to save it, why would I come here?” Jun Wu Yao arched his eyebrows. He actually wasn’t much interested with the things in the Soul World, but the Spirit Tree was the only one that was able to resolve the chaotic energy of Jun Wu Xie, and so... no matter how apathetic he was about it, he would still have to interfere in this matter.

Just thought about it as a way to pay back for his behaviour of taking away the seed from the Spirit Tree.

While being overjoyed at the news, Qin Song was so surprised that he couldn’t even speak a word. He was just looking at Jun Wu Yao with his mouth open.

Meanwhile, their conversations had already been delivered into the bamboo shed, causing those spirit envoys who earlier had the despair expression holding onto their faces to finally gleam with a trace of brightness in their eyes after listening to everything they said. All of them stood up and squeezed themselves to the door, looking at Jun Wu Yao through the narrow air outlet with their eyes glowing.

They could feel it vaguely, that maybe... there was still hope for the Soul World!

If it was Jun Wu Yao... maybe there was still a chance for them to turn the tables!

“Lord Ye Jue! We’ll leave the Soul World to you!”

“Lord Ye Jue, representing the entire Soul World, we’re really grateful for your great kindness!”

Since when the spirit envoys in the room were captured, this was their first time to show their vitality. Even though they weren’t able to leave the Soul Prison, it still couldn’t hinder the imperative desire inside them.

The teen boy who was originally sitting huddled in the corner had also stood up due to the excitement shown by his comrades. Because of his short stature, he couldn’t get to the door, and also, he couldn’t see what kind of person the “Lord Ye Jue” who his comrades kept on calling was. The only thing he knew was that, this name had brought them hope.

While facing the exhilaration of those spirit envoys, there weren’t much emotions on Jun Wu Yao’s face. With the demonic smile still hanging on his face, his eyes fell onto Jun Wu Xie.

“Little Xie, what are you thinking about?” Jun Wu Yao noticed that a moment ago, Jun Wu Xie looked a bit out of sorts in her eyes, seemingly to be thinking of something.

Recovering from the daze, Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao’s pair of eyes and slightly stunned. After a while, she then asked, “What’s their purpose?”

“Huh?” Jun Wu Yao looked at her, puzzled.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
