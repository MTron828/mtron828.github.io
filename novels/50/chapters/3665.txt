Despair shrouded each and every one of them, they could not resist and could only be resigned to their fate as they toiled on endlessly, working under the scorching hot sun that seemed to drain out every single bit of water from their bodies.

That youth slumped his shoulders as he tried to comfort himself. It was just that such self comfort was illusory.

Cracked lips, callused hands and body drenched in sweat continued being tormented under the sun.

A dilapidated sheepskin water bag was brought to the front of the youth as he raised his gaze and realized that a young man who had been silent all this time had held out a water bag to him. He looked back at that silent young man nervously before whispering a ‘thank you’ raspily before accepting the water bag and drinking the water in small sips.

That young man retracted back his line of sight. He was covered in dust like all the others and his appearance could not be seen clearly, but his gaze was very distinct and that stood out from all the rest. Everyone’s gazes had been numbed and had lost their lustre but that young man’s gaze was firm and the youth could not help but stole a few more glances.

This young man had joined this construction at the same time as he did and had been here for half a month but he had never said anything. He had been working earnestly in silence and that had earned him a few whip lashes less.Occasionally, he would help out the weaker companions like this youth. He took care of the others around him but he was not very articulate.

“Big Brother, thank you.” The youth thanked him again after drinking the water and returned the water bag. The young man just nodded without saying a word.

On the other side, the supervisors had began to round them up and in less that ten minutes, everyone was once thrown back to continue their labour.

All the way from noon till late into the night, they had toiled hard and could finally drag their exhausted bodies back to rest.

That youth woke up in the middle of the night as he groggily walked out to take a leak when he discovered that a tall silhouette had suddenly appeared at the back of the palace. Slightly startled, he squinted his eyes and when that figure under the moonlight turned back, he was so shocked that he was rooted to the ground.

“Big...Big Brother...” The youth looked at that young man who walked out of the palace in surprise. It was that Big Brother who had given him water earlier today. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

That young man had also discovered the presence of that youth and his brows were slightly furrowed.

After being in a daze for a while, the youth finally snapped back to his senses as his eyes shifted to the side subconsciously and with stiff strides, he walked to the edge.

“I must be too sleepy, how could anyone come out at such a time.” The youth muttered out, not knowing if he was speaking to himself or to that young man.

The killing intent in that young man’s eyes immediately dissipated and he chuckled before his tall figure disappeared silently into the night without any trace.

Only after that young man had left did the youth return from his stupor as he swallowed his saliva and looked at the spot where the young man had stood before as he patted his chest nervously.

In such a land of tribulation, if that young man could escape, then it was a relief. The youth had already made up his mind that he would never divulge what he saw tonight to anyone. Their meeting was fleeting and he decided to take it as a dream and let it disappear into his memories.

Darkness cloaked the lands and in the desolate wilderness, a black shadow moved forward swiftly like the wind, from the wilderness to the mountain forest at the side. The black shadow melded into the darkness as he took a few leaps and very soon entered the vicinity of the mountain springs. After looking around to ensure that he had not been followed, he then walked through the small waterfall and completely disappeared without a trace.
