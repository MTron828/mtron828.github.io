Chapter 2968 Ridiculous poison king 3

Bai Zhu looked like a water bag hanging on a rack of bones. It looked gooey and extremely disgusting.

His features were also exaggerated. The thin skin started to sag terribly. The corners of his mouth started to droop all the way to the jaw. With the exaggerated sagging, his skin was hanging loosely against his muscleless bones, revealing the cold white bones.

This scene made everyone look dumbfounded. No one had seen such a weird scene before them. It was no longer a person but a mess.

“Fang Jinghe! What the hell is going on here?” Long Yao’s face had turned blue and purple. Fang Jinghe only said that Bai Zhu had no signs of poisoning. But in a blink of time, Bai Zhu became like this?

Fang Jinghe panicked. Huge beads of perspiration continued to trickle down his forehead. His eyes widened in horror as he saw Bai Zhu’s disgusting mucus wrapped in the skin. Fang Jinghe almost vomited immediately.

“I ... I don’t know ... I really don’t know ... Lord Long Yao, when I tested the drug just now... You have seen it. I really did not detect any poison!!” Fang Jinghe fell to the ground. He sat on the ground trembling, his emotions distraught as he struggled to explain to Long Yao.

“What a waste!” Long Yao’s face turned so ugly that Bai Zhu became like this. Even a fool knew that it was the poison given by Jun Wu Xie. But Long Yao could not understand what poison it was exactly?

Why couldn’t even Fang Jinghe the Poison King find out?

Long Yao looked up and looked at Jun Wu Xie who was standing aside. He was just a thin boy. But for some reason, Long Yao had a kind of fear in his heart at this moment.

Colorless, odorless poison that could not be detected. The effect would be so strong. All of that made Long Yao feel a chill in his heart. If this poison was used on his body ... Long Yao really dared not think any further.

“Save ... Save ... Me ...” Bai Zhu was struggling in pain. He watched as he turned into this inhuman and devil-like appearance. It was terrible that he didn’t feel any symptoms. His sufferings occurred silently and the kind of relative calmness in the spirit exacerbated his fear of death.

As if he had never suffered anything, he was being pushed step by step towards the abyss of death.

No pain would dispel his despair and fear.

Such fear of death quietly approaching under the extreme silence had even surpassed the pain that the body could bear.

At this moment, Bai Zhu wished that the poison in his body could make him intolerable, so he would not have such fear. He would not have to look at his pathetic self.

Bai Zhu’s call for help did not receive any response. Even Fang Jinghe was helpless, who else among the Top Ten Experts could solve it?

Bai Zhu seemed to be aware of his own ending. His actions had become more and more strenuous. His muscles had turned into pus, wrapped in thin skin. Each of his bones had fallen abnormally. Looking at Jun Wu Xie, with a plea in his eyes.

“Ughh...”

“This is what you deserve.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Bai Zhu coldly, without the slightest sympathy in her eyes.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
