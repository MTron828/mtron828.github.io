Chapter 3013 Fast death 1

“When does My Lady intend to strike?” The ghoul masked man looked at Su Ruiying.

Su Ruiying frowned and said, “Wait for him to visit the next time. Yan Hai might be going to deal with some matters when he goes back. He will become a Knight of Destruction soon, what else is there that he can’t let go of?”

Su Ruiying was very puzzled, and the ghoul masked man also knew nothing about it.

Long Yao, who had left Su Ruiying’s residence, had returned to his place with a good mood.

With the strength of Jun Wu Xie, it was almost impossible to plot against her. An arrogant person like Long Yao, even after witnessing Jun Wu Xie killing five of the Top Ten Experts in person, he had deeply felt the strength of the Dual Spirit Ring exponent. Naturally, he would not be stupid enough to confront her directly.

Before Jun Wu Xie became a true Knight of Destruction, the only person who could strike Jun Wu Xie without anyone knowing would be Su Ruiying.

Su Ruiying was responsible for erasing the memory of the new Knight of Destruction. It was also the most vulnerable time. No matter what Su Ruiying had done during the process, no one would know.

In fact, Su Ruiying also said that Long Yao’s move was somewhat redundant. Because of Long Yao’s narrow-mindedness, he was not willing to leave the slightest chance to his enemies.

In particular, his own invincible enemy.

“Yan Hai, no matter how powerful you are, I don’t believe that you can still hide this time!” Long Yao’s eyes flashed a shadow of a bird of prey, as if he had seen the appearance of Jun Wu Xie in the future. It made him feel very happy.

Just as Long Yao was proud of his plan, a voice suddenly sounded in Long Yao’s ear.

“Long Yao.”

In the empty alley, the sound suddenly appeared to make Long Yao slightly stunned. Knowing his status in the Upper Realm, only His Lord and the Knights of Destruction dared to call him his name. At Least everyone else would address him as Lord.

But the voice seemed a little strange, only a trace of familiarity. But he couldn’t remember who it was for a while.

Long Yao turned around unconsciously, wanting to see who was so bold. When he turned around and saw the person coming, he was stunned!

The figure standing at the end of the alley was slightly thin. It makes Long Yao feel more fearful than any other figure.

“Yan ... Yan Hai?” Long Yao looked at the figure in shock. He couldn’t imagine that he would meet Jun Wu Xie at this time. “What are you doing here?”

For some reason, Long Yao felt a panic in his heart. He didn’t even realize it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie slowly walked from the entrance of the alley to Long Yao, and the reflection of the wall enveloped her. Even at dusk, it was as if darkness fell, making people feel dim.

“What? Naturally I have come to return you the favour.” Jun Wu Xie’s slightly cold voice echoed in the alley.

An uneasiness lingered in Long Yao’s mind. His cells seemed to be tense at this moment. His right leg stepped back subconsciously.

“Return the favour? I don’t remember what kind of favour I have given you. Did you remember it wrongly?”

Jun Wu Xie’s footsteps did not stop. The unhurried pace seemed to step on Long Yao’s heart.

“Lord Long, a noble person like you are forgetful. You asked those Top Ten Experts to take care by presenting me with such a ‘gift’... I haven’t returned it yet.”
