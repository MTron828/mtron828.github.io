Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Roar!” A huge black shadow flew out and stood in front of Lord Meh Meh, prepared to battle with the Gold Spirits before them.

Over a hundred Gold Spirits had been blocked by these two spirit beasts and could not advance any further.

Su Jing Yan looked at this scene dumbfounded however, he had not put down the vigilance in his heart.

Even if they had the help from these few spirit beast’s, so what about it? They were facing a thousand Gold Spirits!

Su Jing Yan could see that both Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit were overlord level spirit beasts, they were already regarded as the pinnacle of the spirit beasts. However, against a Gold Spirit, there was still a gap!

If they really wanted to block them, they will have to fight with their lives on the line.

“Just some measly spirit beasts dare to block my way?” One Gold Spirit sneered as he scoffed in a condescending tone.

In the eyes of the Gold Spirits, so what if the spirit beasts are at the overlord level? They were just some random wastes that they could kill at will!

However, Lord Meh Meh and black beast did not take a step back. If they retreated, then Su Ya’s death was imminent. Jun Wu Xie had entrusted Su Ya to them so how could they not live up to their Mistress’ wishes?

Jun Wu Xie was currently engaged in a Bloody battle, as her spirit beast and soul beast, how could they retreat!

“Roar!” Lord Meh Meh and the black beast roared towards the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit behind them. The Sacrificial Blood Rabbit turned to cast a final glance at its companion’s before it made its way to escape with Su Ya with renewed determination.

Su Ya was too heavily wounded, she could not even resist any enemy in her current condition. If they met with any enemies, she only had death awaiting her.

“Let... Let me down...” Su Ya murmured softly in the embrace of the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit. Her jaw had been fixed back in place by Jun Wu Xie but even opening her mouth rendered pain but it could not surpass her in the inner fear that was in her heart.

Her Master and her disciple had fallen into such a desperate situation just in order to save her. How could she escape alone?

The Sacrificial Blood Rabbit did not utter a sound but ran forward in desperation. All that the Nine Temple disciples could see was that a fiery red figure sweep past them and each of them stood there stunned in place.

“You are all a bunch of wastes! Why are you standing there in a daze for? Hurry and bring that beast and slut back!” One Gold Spirit that was blocked by Lord Meh Meh berated those Nine Temples disciples harshly.

However, those Nine Temple disciples seem to have not heard anything and just bowed their heads down in silence.

It was because they felt afraid, afraid that they could not even do anything to help the teacher who was akin to their saviour. They could be called despicable, incompetent, but the very least... let them be able to hold on to the last thread conscience and to stick to the stubborn notion by not acting on it.

The Nine Temple disciples hung their heads low in place and even quietly opened a wide and unobstructed path and let the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit to pass through quickly. This movement made the Gold Spirits enraged, as the attacks against Lord Meh Meh and the black beast became fiercer and fiercer with each passing moment.

In the blink of an eye, on Lord Meh Meh, there were countless deep wounds that even the bones were visible. Fresh crimson blood had dyed its once pure white fleece similarly red, blocking hundreds of Gold Spirits was tantamount to seeking death however, it refused to budge a single step. It relied on its gigantic stature to block off the path completely!

The black beast had countless lacerations across its body, because Jun Wu Xie had strengthened it before so it relentlessly attacked all the Gold Spirits that were attacking Lord Meh Meh. Using its sharp fangs and razor claws, it continued on its assault to the best of its abilities.

Blood flowed like a river...

Hot blood flowed all over the ground, as Lord Meh Meh was enormous, it was hard to estimate the amount of attack that it had received. Even standing straight proved to be difficult as it used its hind legs and its tail to swipe at those Gold Spirits that tried to bypass it.
