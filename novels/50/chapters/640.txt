Chapter 641: ‘Spirit Reinforcement (3)”

Jun Wu Xie gave up on the idea after hearing Fan Zhuo out. If these runes are similar to those on Hua Yao’s spirit ring, then it could very possibly bring about much greater effects to their spirit rings.

Unfortunately, they knew almost nothing about the meanings behind those characters, and there was no way they were able to put them to good use.

It was highly possible that they contained great power, were they then supposed to just watch that invaluable opportunity slip by right before their eyes?

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed in thought and she suddenly turned to look at Fan Zhuo.

“Teach me how to forge rings.”

Fan Zhuo was shocked and taken aback by the sudden request.

“You want to give it a try?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

Fan Zhuo sighed and said: “If are really interested, after we come back from the Heaven’s End Cliff, I’ll teach it to you then. Alright?”

“Sure.”

After coming to an agreement with Fan Zhuo, Jun Wu Xie did not say anything more on it, but just sat on one side, staring at the characters she had scribbled on the piece of paper, scrutinizing every single one. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Fan Zhuo, on the other hand, continued to forge spirit rings for the others.

Daylight faded and the darkness of night fell across the land. Qiao Chu and Mu Qian Fan returned fully loaded with bags and bags of equipments and many other things. After they stored everything away properly, Qiao Chu could not wait a moment longer as he rushed to see Fan Zhuo, crowding round to watch Fan Zhuo forge the spirit rings.

The process of the forging of spirit rings was long and arduous. Just a single day was not enough for him to forge everyone’s spirit rings.

Jun Wu Xie watched and observed what the entire process of forging a spirit ring entailed, whatever else she wanted to understand would require her to slowly ponder and contemplate before she could gain a better understanding of it.

Back in her room, Jun Wu Xie sat at the table in the middle. The little black cat lay on the table looking at its Mistress seemingly thoughtful expression. Lord Meh Meh had just been well fed and it was lying on the bed with all four of its hooves splayed flat out, fast asleep.

“Were it an entire verse on a page, or short sentences jumbled up together...?” Jun Wu Xie said it out aloud as she was pondering. She had just stumbled upon a way to use Spirit Reinforcement but was still unable to bring it a step further, and it greatly frustrated her.

She thoughtlessly dipped her finger into her cup of tea, and traced out on the table with her wet finger, the symbols currently swimming endlessly in her mind.

The little black cat lying quietly at the side swished its tail lazily in the air. It was already late into the night, and Jun Wu Xie did not look the least bit sleepy, but it was already feeling weariness creep in. It stretched its body and stood up, taking two steps forward, wanting to leap off the table.

However, a sudden surge of a blazing hot sensation, shot up from under its paw!

The next moment, a ball of fire completely engulfed the entire little black cat!

“MEOW! ! !”

[WHAT THE HELL!!]

The sudden roaring and raging inferno shocked the little black cat into a shriek as all its fur stood up on their ends. It quickly leapt off the table but the ball of fire was still around its entire body. Under a series of meows and screeches, the little black cat darted and leapt all over the room, attempting everything it could to extinguish the fire on its body.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were wide with shock as she stared, seeing the ball of flames engulf the little black cat.

A few seconds later, the ball of flames suddenly disappeared. The little black cat was bathed in a layer of cold sweat, its claws dug deeply into the drapes at the window. Its sharp claws had torn up the curtains with two long stretches across it.

“Meow.....”

[What was that just now? It almost shocked meow~ to death!]

The little black cat jumped off from the drapes and snuggled deep into Jun Wu Xie’s arms, still trembling heavily, seemingly not fully recovered from the sudden shock.

“Are you alright?” Jun Wu Xie looked down at the little black cat in her arms. The phenomenon that had occurred on the little black cat earlier intrigued her endlessly.

“I don’t know..... Suddenly..... I just caught fire.....” The little black cat wailed pitifully. It had just wanted to go sleep, what went wrong?

Jun Wu Xie lifted the little black cat, and turned it all around to inspect it all over. She saw that the little black cat was completely unscathed, and its fur was still just as luxuriously smooth.
