Chapter 2744: The beginning of carnage（1）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“What about it?” Jun Wu Xie asked without hiding her intentions.

The only way was to lure all the armies into the Sea Spirit City so that none of them could escape and live.

From the beginning, Zheng Weilong had predicted Jun Wu Xie’s intention wrongly. Jun Wu Xie had never thought of making use of the 72 cities. What she wanted was to conquer the 72 cities in the fastest time!

Since the Five City Coalition welcomed her in, she had no reason not to seize the opportunity.

“Do you think that with your Sea Spirit City, you are really capable of fighting against five cities? Yan Hai, you are just too arrogant! ” Liang Cheng forcibly suppressed his fear and shouted out with false bravado.

“Oh? Is that right? ” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes as a cold glint flashed by. Mu En and the others felt a bitter cold rising from the bottom of their feet instantly.

“There are five armies in this Sea Spirit City. Do you think you can really do what you want? Believe it or not, upon my command, your whole Sea Spirit City will be covered with blood! ” Liang Cheng had the courage to hollar but alas, that wasall he could do. He did dare to fight with Jun Wu Xie. If he started the fight, he would definitely die!

“Go ahead to give your command.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly replied.

Liang Cheng was shocked. All he said was to embolden himself and to delay the time. The blood scent was so strong and suffocating that in a moment, the soldiers outside realized that even if you had super powers, there was no way to escape from the siege of the Five City Coalition.

But Jun Wu Xie’s reaction was surprisingly calm. She didn’t seem to notice Liang Cheng’s idea at all.

A feeling of forbode suddenly rose in Liang Cheng’s heart.

“What did you do?” Liang Cheng asked subconsciously.

Jun Wu Xie calmly looked at Liang Cheng and said, “Killed them.”

“... You... Who did you kill? Except for Guan Hu... ” Liang Cheng’s unease grew stronger and stronger.

Jun Wu Xie slightly raised both her hands and looked around.

“All the people who don’t belong to Sea Spirit City.”

“Guan Hu.”

“Five City Coalition.”

“And...”

After Jun Wu Xie gave her command, her figure disappeared completely. Mu En and the other people had realized the danger. They wanted to mobilize their spiritual power and make a defensive posture in the shortest time. But the cold light swept between them like lightning!

It was too fast for them to even respond!

When the figure of Jun Wu Xie finally appeared back in her original place, Mu En and the others who had put on a defensive posture remained in their original positions. As Jun Wu Xie gently patted off the dust from her body, the three people stood stiff and instantly fell onto the ground. Their heads lost support in the instant and rolled down the ground accompanied by the gushing blood .

“You guys.” Only dead silence across the yard after Jun Wu Xie’s last two words.

Zheng Weilong stood on one side and witnessed the whole process. Both her legs went weak. She barely grasped onto the tree trunk beside her and managed to prevent herself from falling into the river of blood.

Dead... Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

All dead ....

In such a short period of time, Jun Wu Xie had killed all the commanders of other cities except Nangong Lie!

At this moment, Zheng Wei Long did not dare to guess Jun Wu Xie’s mind again. She could never imagine that Jun Wu Xie would be so crazy.

Jun Wu Xie knew that all the Five City Coalition were in the city. However, she did not hesitate to kill them. Nothing could stop her.
