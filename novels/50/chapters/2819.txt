Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

There was a faint floral scent in the small, quiet hall. The floral scent was not clingy, but with a refreshing fragrance, people could smell it for a long time.

As soon as Han Shu stepped into this small hall, her expression became ashen and with every step she took, she had an urge to immediately turn away from the place.

However, she couldn’t.

“Where is the Sacred Maiden?” Han Shu asked out loud, seeing the handmaid in the small hall.

“The Sacred Maiden is in the study,” answered the handmaid.

Han Shu sneered secretly.

The study, again the study.

Obviously she was the Sacred Maiden of the Sacred Maiden Tribe and thus had a very high status. But that person however liked to do these meaningless things, like reading those tattered books. Who was she putting up an act for?

“Alright, Elder Yun told me to tell her something. I’ll go find her.” Han Shu said with a tensed face.

The handmaid nodded obediently.

From the small hall to the long corridor, through the gorgeous courtyard, watching the carved jade gazebo, watching the water crystals blended with snow color inlaid on the ground, Han Shu’s heart was a little gloomy.

This was the small house where the Sacred Maidens lived. It was also the most luxurious place in the Sacred Maiden Tribe. The best things in the entire tribe were sent here for the Sacred maiden to enjoy.

As a child, Han Shu had dreamed countless times that she could live in such a good place, but reality was bloody and cruel.

Walking all the way to the study, Han Shu could no longer remember the many good things she saw.

Since Han Zi Fei fled, the small hall was also left empty, and only the handmaids would come clean it every day, the others were not allowed to enter at all.

Taking a deep breath, she raised her hand and knocked on the door.

“Who is it?” A gentle and pleasant voice sounded in the room.

Han Shu said: “Sacred Maiden, it’s me, Han Shu.”

There was no sound in the study, and Han Shu could feel a hot sting on her face. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

She and Han Zi Fei shared the same mother. Why, was it that Han Zi Fei who got all this, and not her?!!

Before Han Han’s unwillingness started to burn, the door of the study was opened suddenly.

A woman appeared. She had an exquisite face, wearing a very simple goose-yellow long dress, with long black hair hanging behind her. Although it was the simplest dress, it was more eye-catching than the March sun. She was too beautiful for people to look away.

Han Zi Fei ...

The third Sacred Maiden of the Sacred Maiden Tribe was also the most beautiful woman in the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

Every time Han Shu saw Han Zi Fei’s face, she could not help but want to tear it off.

“Sacred Maiden.” Han Shu lowered her head to try and cover up the unwillingness in her eyes.

“Han Shu? Why are you free to come to me today?” Han Zi Fei’s voice was mild, there was a sharp and heroic look between the eyebrows, she was not as delicate as an ordinary woman.

“What’s the matter, come in and talk.” Han Zi Fei laughed lightly, turned and walked into the study, she casually sat down at the desk, and set aside the unread books.

Han Shu stepped into the study. The rows of bookshelves in the entire study were filled with old books. With the many years that had passed, the books could only be preserved in the cold environment of the Holy Mountain, and therefore were still intact. But upon closer observation, each of those books seemed to have been read countless times, the cornes were a little frayed.
