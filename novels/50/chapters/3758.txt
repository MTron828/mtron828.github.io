“Well, I’ve already delivered the words, I will leave it up to you to decide what you want to do. After all, the person that Jun Wu Xie seeked was you, if you want to blame anyone, it would be that you underestimated her then.” Gu Ying stood up after saying his piece, he no longer held any interest in seeing her twisted expression. After seeing her perfunctory nod, he left with the woman behind him.

After walking out of Luo Qingcheng’s courtyard, Gu Ying halted his steps for a moment and he suddenly turned to look at the woman behind him who had remained silent all this while.

“Gu Xin Yan, should you be happy or should you be angry? Jun Wu Xie is still alive, perhaps this might be good news to you.” Not a trace of anger could be heard from Gu Ying’s voice and the woman whom he was facing froze for a moment before she raised her head and met his gaze. On that beautiful face, there was no longer any of the brilliance from before, she calmly looked at him with a numb expression.

Five years ago, Gu Xin Yan could not face Jun Wu Xie and chose to leave the shelter of the Spirit Jade Palace on her own accord. She did not think that the things that followed thereafter would develop to such a point. When she heard of the bloody battle at Cloudy Brook Academy, she had a bad premonition and when she heard people discussing about the disappearance of the Spirit Jade Palace, she finally understood that a terrible thing had happened.

Gu Xin Yan started subconsciously searching for traces of Jun Wu Xie but after searching for half a year, she had not found anything. And the more she searched, she started hearing startling rumours, until.... the Upper Realm sent people to take over the Nine Temples. On a fateful day, Gu Ying suddenly found her and without her consent, he brought her to the Upper Realm and told her how terrible the battle was and what Jun Wu Xie had experienced.

Just by listening to all that had happened, Gu Xin Yan was mortified.

As far as the facts were concerned, Gu Xin Yan did not hate Jun Wu Xie. The person whom she wanted to exact her revenge for her father was Gu Ying, however... The current her no longer spoke about her father’s revenge, even her own freedom had been limited by Gu Ying and had been reduced to become a serving girl who was forced to stay by his side and listen to his orders.

Gu Ying waited for a long while and no longer waited for her to speak. He did not seem to pay much attention to her response as he chuckled and turned to walk towards the carriage by the side.

“No matter what your thoughts are, at least I am happy. At first, I thought that... she had died in the explosion. But now that she is well and alive, things are going to be interesting... I don’t know how Luo Qingcheng is going to tidy up this mess that was caused by her own blunder, I am really...looking forward to it.” After he finished speaking, his figure disappeared into the carriage.

Gu Xin Yan took a deep breath and forcibly suppressed the rapid palpitations of her heart, she could only clench her fists tightly and followed up quickly.

Jun Wu Xie, you can only go forward, nothing must happen to you anymore!

As soon as Gu Ying left, Luo Qingcheng raised her hand and smashed away the tea cups on the table. The tea flowed spilled all over the table and dripped onto the floor.

On Luo Qingcheng’s face, there was a tiny crack and it was like a fine crack on ice which very soon spread over the surface like a spider web and tiny pieces of skin started falling. However, the infuriated Luo Qingcheng was not aware of the changes on her face.

The person who was guarding by the side was shocked to see the half face that was revealed beneath. The original peerless complexion had fallen off and what was left was a raised red and purplish uneven scar that was filled with dark red pus.
