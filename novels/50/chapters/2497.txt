“Thank you.” Jun Wu Yao did not decline further as he carried Jun Wu Xie and stood up.

Coincidentally, Ye Sha and Fei Yan hurried back, having not figured out the situation, they were dragged into the dense jungle by the woman.

Fierce winds amidst the downpour, thunder rolled and lightning flashed. The already dark, gloomy skies of the sea of death was now filled with thunder and lightning.

Within the dense jungle, the strange woman was agile and nimble, as if she was a black panther who lived in the dense jungle, she passed through all the narrow gaps with ease.

Jun Wu Yao used his Spirit Powers to create a barrier that sheltered him and Jun Wu Xie against the wind and rain.

Jun Wu Yao’s gaze fell on the woman’s figure, with a trace of doubt in his eyes.

“Who is she?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao in confusion, the sudden appearance of this person who harboured no ill intentions towards them.

Jun Wu Yao explained, “In the Upper Realm, there aren’t just only idiots and fools. There is a sect called the Sacred Maiden Tribe. The whole sect only has women. It is said that their blood is pure, and they are the most devout believers of the gods. They have a high standing in the Upper Realm and the whole tribe is devoted to guarding the Holy Mountain, hence they rarely go down the mountain. Can you still remember that one of the conditions of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, is that the Holy Virgin of the Sacred Maiden Sect performs the full ceremony?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Through the thousands of years, the Sacred Maiden Sect only had two Sacred Maidens born. One is Luo Qingcheng, however, even though Luo Qincheng was a pureblood Sacred Maiden but she is not the most orthodox one. The other is the most orthodox person, but a thousand years before, that person suddenly defected. She seemingly evaporated from the Upper Realm. I have not met that person but I recognize the pureblood Sacred Maiden ring. She is the one who defected those years ago, the pureblood Sacred Maiden.” Jun Wu Yao smirked, if he didn’t know that this person was the nemesis of the Upper Realm, he would not have let her near Jun Wu Xie.

“Why did she defect?” Jun Wu Xie still held her suspicion. It was to be said, to be able to escape from that sort of environment, and with such an important identity, this person’s ability was not to be underestimated.

“Don’t know. Just that she wanted to rebel, killing a group of scared maidens who were guarding the Holy Mountain and fled. That much was clear.” Jun Wu Yao did not care about the business of others, and what exactly happened, he didn’t spend much effort to find out. He just knew the gist of it.

Jun Wu Xie nodded once again.

Qiao Chu and the rest who didn’t know the situation, only found out through Rong Ruo about the alarming situation, and they all breathed a sigh of relief when they found out that she was not in present danger.

Ye Sha and Ye Mei were holding Lord Meh Meh and Blood Sacrificial Rabbit respectively. The two silly babies have been used to these two exclusively as “pillows” in these last few years, and so they were very cooperative. Rong Ruo held on to the little Sea Spirit Beast as they walked amidst the group. Her previous ill feelings seem to have disappeared.

After a long walk, the woman finally stopped in front of a cave. The cave looked big, and there was a huge tree outside. The woman waited by the cave entrance and saw that Jun Wu Xie and the others had caught up, and she continued to walk into the cave.

The cave was completely dark, It seemed like a bottomless pit. Fortunately, they were not weak, so even in the blinding darkness, they were still able to see the path ahead.

The cave didn’t look very deep from the outside, but even though the people walked on for a long time, but they could not see the end. The road seemed to be inclined but they didn’t know the situation and could only continue to follow the woman.

After a long while in darkness, a little light suddenly appeared in front of their eyes.
