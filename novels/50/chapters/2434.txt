Slap!

At that moment, a brisk sound echoed in the silent carriage. It was such a clear and crystal sound but it sounded so grating on Jun Wu Yao’s ears.

Jun Wu Yao slightly stunned. The stinging pain on his face caused him to recover instantly from the shock. While looking at the stiffened hand of Jun Wu Xie in the air, complex emotions appeared in his purple eyes.

The slap came so suddenly.

“Idiot.” A murmur came out from Jun Wu Xie’s mouth.

Jun Wu Yao lowered his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie. There wasn’t any unhappiness in his mind. The confusion shown in his eyes was just him worrying about her behaviour.

“Idiot!” Jun Wu Xie suddenly raised her head.

The moment his eyes met Jun Wu Xie’s eyes, Jun Wu Yao held his breath. It was as if somebody was grabbing onto his throat, giving him a suppressing pain.

There were two lines of tears hanging on the peerlessly stunning face, flowing noiselessly across the face which once had him thought for countless times. Her tears were like two sharp blades, slicing over his heart.

“Little Xie...” Jun Wu Yao’s voice was unusually husky. His eyes which were normally calm were now surging with huge and stormy waves. With his eyes widened, he stared at Jun Wu Xie who was crying quietly.

This was the first time Jun Wu Xie shed her tears in front of him.

The Jun Wu Xie in the past would never make a sound or drop a tear when facing any obstacles or suffering from any pain.

He thought that she was the most persevering woman in the world. The word “surrender” would never be found in her world.

But he didn’t know that...

The tears of the most persevering woman in this world was actually so cold... so heartbreaking...

His heart felt so painful, as if he was going to faint in the next second. It felt like he was being sliced for a hundred thousand times, causing him to be unable to breathe properly. The two drops of tears seemed to be turning into a huge rock pressing on his heart, crushing it into pieces.

“Don’t cry... Little Xie... Stop crying...” For the very first time, Jun Wu Yao panicked. How he wished he could break free of the chains around him and wipe the tears hanging on the corners of her eyes out.

He never realized that there was such a thing in this world that was able to crush all his calmness and self-control without him noticing.

“You idiot! Who allowed you to leave me alone!” The lips of Jun Wu Xie were slightly trembling. Suddenly, she raised her hand and swung it towards Jun Wu Yao’s face.

But this time, her hand didn’t land on the face of Jun Wu Yao. At the last moment when her hand was going to slap on his face, the white and soft little hand turned into a fist and hit softly on his chest. One after another, slowly and gently, she kept on beating on his chest. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Who had allowed you to make the decision yourself... You..this idiot...” Jun Wu Xie couldn’t stop her shoulders from trembling. Biting hard on her lips, she lowered her head down, unwilling to let anyone see the weakness she was showing now.

It had been five years.

Was there anyone who was able to understand how had she gone through the whole five years?

After witnessing the scenes of Jun Wu Yao being caught, Ren Huang sacrificed himself , followed by the death of Yan Bu Gui. How did she survive through all of these...

Be parted in life, or separated by death.

Everything had been overwhelming her since that day during five years ago. She didn’t even want to recall how did she live through these entire five years.

There wasn’t a time that she was not feeling anxious. She was worried that the progress of her cultivation wasn’t fast enough. She was also worried that there wasn’t enough time for her to stop the Blood Sacrifice of the Upper Realm. She was worried that... it was too late for her... to save him ...

The fist of Jun Wu Xie hitting on his chest was getting weaker and slower, as if it was a breeze blowing across his chest. But at this moment, all the organs in Jun Wu Yao’s body felt so painful, as if they were all being toasted in the raging fire.
