Chapter 3021 Entering the tiger’s den 1

“What? Are you going to see His Lord yourself? Isn’t ... isn’t this too dangerous?” As soon as Qiao Chu heard the news brought back by Jun Wu Xie, he jumped up from the chair. He simply could not believe his ears.

Hua Yao frowned deeply. This situation was quite unexpected. No one thought that His Lord would demand to see Jun Wu Xie at this time.

Jun Wu Yao was lost in contemplation. Among the people present, he was the only one who had close contact with His Lord. He personally taught His Lord’s skills. For this action, he was the most qualified to say something.

“Brother Wu Yao, look at this ...” Fan Zhuo looked to Jun Wu Yao, hesitating.

“I can’t judge his style of action. You cannot guess him as a person.” Jun Wu Yao admitted frankly.

If he could guess His Lord’s thoughts, he would not have fallen into his trap.

“I will go.” Jun Wu Xie said in a resolute tone.

“At this point of time, we have no way to retreat. No matter what His Lord wants to do, I can only face up, so there may be a glimmer of hope.” Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath. She had taken ninety-nine steps. She was just left with this last step.

She had to go.

If she backed off at this time, all her previous efforts became meaningless. And, now, even if she wanted to back off, she would not be able to leave.

“I’ll go with you.” Jun Wu Yao said.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“I’ll go by myself. If something goes wrong, at least there’s still you.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao firmly. The reason why she hasn’t exposed Jun Wu Yao to the vision of the Upper Realm was to keep the last move.

Jun Wu Yao understood her intentions, although he could not bear it, he still nodded, acceding to her request.

Qiao Chu and others could not stop worrying and paced about anxiously. There was nothing that they could do. They could only pray and hope that His Lord did not find out anything.

“You don’t have to be so nervous, unless His Lord has a pair of heavenly eyes, we have done everything so secretly, he cannot find anything out.” Jun Wu Xie appeased her companions.

Having said that, who wouldn’t be nervous with the single thought of Jun Wu Xie meeting with that person alone?

In order to divert the attention of her companions, Jun Wu Xie said: “There is still a period of time before I meet with His Lord, there is still a person, maybe I should also pay a visit first.” Jun Wu Xie’s gaze changed slightly when she mentioned this.

“Su Ruiying.” Jun Wu Xie said.

When she mentioned the name of Su Ruiying, Fei Yan on the side almost subconsciously reached out to the table next to him. The puppet on the table was sitting quietly and he saw Fei Yan’s uneasiness. Although he was helpless in his heart, he still raised his hand and appeased Fei Yan’s finger.

“If the purpose of His Lord is to use the souls of the Upper Realms to activate the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, then I have reason to believe that those souls should be in the hands of Su Ruiying.” To destroy the enemy’s plan, you can start from many aspects. Before she faced His Lord, she needed more chips.

“If I remember correctly, refining the life and death worm would also require a lot of souls. I might get a more accurate answer from Su Ruiying.”
