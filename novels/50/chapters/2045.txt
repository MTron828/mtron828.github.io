After Jun Wu Xie came to a decision, she immediately went to find Qiao Chu and the others, to tell them about the Serene Spirit Tower’s secret.

And during this period that Jun Wu Xie was researching into the Spirit Reinforcement runes, the Spirit World descended into a bout of chaos.

With the construction of the fourth serene Spirit Tower completed, it created quite a stir that rocked the Spirit World. While the human spirits in the ever present snaking queues outside the three other Serene Spirit Towers waited for their turns, Wu Jiu suddenly released out the news.

The fourth Serene Spirit Tower would not just be enjoyed exclusively by human spirits, but could be handed over to the other spirit races to use as well.

It must be known that the construction of the three Serene Spirit Tower from before had pushed the disadvantaged human spirits up to new peaks. Be it Beast Spirits, Weapon Spirits or even the Plant Spirits, they were all looking at the human spirits with envy. For all living beings under the Heavens, who didn’t want to pursue stronger power? And in the Spirit World, one’s strength or weakness in the power of the spirit was the only standard, that was able to provide for everything.

And the fourth Serene Spirit Tower would now be made available for for spirit races other than human. That piece of news immediately quaked through the entire Spirit World.

The animosity felt against the human spirit race by the other spirit races and their resistance towards the Serene Spirit Towers were mainly due to the fact that they could not use them, only allowing the human spirits to grow stronger. But now, with the completion of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, it changed the entire situation completely!

But.....

Complete authourity over the fourth Serene Spirit Tower was still held by the human spirits race alone. At that moment, a clash fighting over the rights of attribution for the fourth Serene Spirit Tower immediately kicked up an immense storm that swept over the entire Spirit World.

Although the human spirits were displeased that the newly constructed Serene Spirit Tower would not be kept exclusively for their own use, but when they thought that they already had three Serene Spirit Towers, they did not protest against Wu Jiu’s decision too much in order to not create too much strife.

Hence, an immense amount of conflict and dissent quickly rose up between the Plant Spirits, the Weapons Spirits, and the Beast Spirits.

Among the rocky mountain range with its jagged peaks, countless Beast Spirits were gathered outside the Flame Dragon’s cave. They came in large groups and gathered together there, incessant bestial roars rising up towards the clouds, all their protests exceptionally unified in one direction, only about the fourth Serene Spirit Tower!

The Flame Dragon stood outside its cave, its deep dragon eyes looking at its fellow Beast Spirits voicing their protest continuously.

“Lord Flame Dragon! Since Wu Jiu has already agreed to yield out the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, isn’t it the best time for us, the Beast Spirits to rise? Even those weak and helpless human spirits were able to gain so much progress in the Serene Spirit Tower, if we are to go in there, we will become more powerful than them!” A black bear with a feisty temper stood with its enormous body erect and let out a roar, its voice filled with an insuppressible excitement.

They yearned to become stronger. The existence of the previous three Serene Spirit Towers had already proven how useful they were. They had enabled the far inferior human spirits to gradually catch up to them and in their envy, the Beast Spirits had also grown somewhat nervous. The Beast Spirits were afterall the greatest in number in the Spirit World and before the Serene Spirit Towers were built, the human spirits could not even be compared to them in the slightest. But after the three Serene Spirit Towers were built in quick succession, the human spirits were showing signs of overtaking them!

But among all the excited voices, voices also rose up in skepticism.

“Wu Jiu has always been crafty, shielding the human spirits. When the three Serene Spirit Towers were built before, it wasn’t as if we had not made requests just like this, but we had always been rejected. But now, he is suddenly giving up the fourth Serene Spirit Tower. Could things really be just so simple?” A large python coiled up upon a rock said with a hiss, spitting its red forked tongue.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
