“You are...crazy...” Shaking his head, Qin Ge looked at Jun Wu Xie. He had seen how much she went through for the past five years. All that suffering, all that torment, all that pain. At first, he didn’t really care about it. But now, it seemed like he had been totally defeated by this woman who often got on his nerves due to her stubbornness. Did this person really think that there was nothing for her to be afraid of in order to take revenge?

“It’s not like I am going to die for sure,” said Jun Wu Xie while gasping.

“Well, since living death is not considered as death...” On the other side, Long Jiu whispered to himself. Not to mention Jun Wu Xie was the one who suffered from all of these, even a big tall adult man like him couldn’t bear to look at Jun Wu Xie every time when she was in pain. It felt like she died and was resurrected from the dead time and time again.

“You can’t go on like this anymore if you still want to continue your cultivation. Since Old Nine and I have come out for years, we aren’t able to absorb the soul power here and the amount that can be suppressed is getting smaller and smaller. Didn’t you say previously that the Spirit World is located in the Lower Realm? Though it can’t be compared to the Soul World, it would still be nice if we are able to revive some soul power after entering Spirit World. Sure, it would also benefit you if you are going to cultivate there.” Qin Song sighed. There were some unexplainable emotions inside him.

He should be hiding everything from Jun Wu Xie if he wanted to get the seed of the Spirit Tree as soon as possible. Jun Wu Xie was still able to hold up for some time. They could just leave her alone and let her continue her cultivation and sooner or later, her body would collapse and explode. However, if she was capable of cultivating in the form of spirit, it might be possible to stabilize her condition and thus, her death will be postponed indefinitely...

After he finished speaking, Qin Song realized that something began to affect his judgement but to his surprise, he had no regrets about it.

“Yeah! What Old Five said is reasonable, how about you follow us to the Spirit World? At the same time, you will also suffer less.” Long Jiu was an outspoken person without any tact. For him, Wu Jun Xie was a nice person and he didn’t really want to see her suffering all the time. Since the Spirit Tree had unlimited lifespan, he was able to wait patiently for the seed even if Jun Wu Xie lived through a hundred more years.

While looking at Qin Song and Long Jiu, she was stunned a little. The suggestion they gave was somewhat out of the scope of their task.

“We just want to retrieve the seed of the Spirit Tree. We don’t want to hurt anyone.” Qin Song found himself an excuse which did not sound really persuasive.

Jun Wu Xie took a glance at Qin Song, causing him to look away awkwardly.

Yet, Long Jiu didn’t notice anything. He was trying very hard to encourage Jun Wu Xie to continue her cultivation in Spirit World so that her agony could be reduced.

“Let’s go.” The black beast rub itself on the back of Jun Wu Xie’s hand. Except for Qin Song and Long Jiu, only the other two creatures and it had seen how much Jun Wu Xie suffered. More than anyone else, it knew about her tolerance level towards pain. If even Jun Wu Xie couldn’t take it... it doesn’t even want to imagine about that.

Jun Wu Xie thought for a while and ended up nodding her head.

If there was a chance to be alive, who in this world would want to die?

“Then just go for a rest today. Remember your grandfather’s advice. Stop cultivating and have a good rest. There will be more time for you to cultivate in spirit form when you reach Spirit World. Don’t be too anxious about it.” Qin Song could not help but to advise her. He was afraid that Jun Wu Xie would risk her life to cultivate again.

“Alright,” responded Jun Wu Xie. She felt grateful for Qin Song and Long Jiu. Actually, they could have just taken the attitude of a cold onlooker and watched on the sidelines, like how Situ Heng behaved towards her. But they were willing to reach out to her. No matter what their intention was from the start, Jun Wu Xie had already kept their good intentions in her mind. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

If there was any chance later, she definitely was going to repay them.
