After telling Ling’er to maintain her cool in this situation, Jun Wu Xie gave Ling’er a kind of elixir which could help Ling’er to control her voice and ensured that Elder Luo would not accidentally find out that her voice had been restored.

After understanding what she needed to know, Jun Wu Xie stepped out of Elder Luo’s igloo, relocked the door, and left the Holy Land while Elder Luo was still away.

Outside the Holy Land, among the brilliant white snow-capped mountains, there was no one around. Little Black was swishing his tail in the arms of Jun Wu Xie.

“I knew it, this Sacred Maiden Tribe is definitely not as virtuous as it may seem, otherwise, why would Mother Jun escape from here?” Little Black twitched his whiskers.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. She had initially planned on practicing in the Holy Land for two more days before going to find Jun Wu Yao and the others, but what she saw and heard today forced her to go back immediately.

One Gu Ying.

One youth potion.

All these made Jun Wu Xie unable to stay in the Holy Land any longer.

She urgently needed to pass these two pieces of news to Jun Wu Yao, and she also needed to inquire about the youth potion from Han Zi Fei.

Walking all the way from the Holy Land, Jun Wu Xie did not see a single person along the way. She kept walking at an extremely fast pace and within a short time, she had arrived at her former residence under the moonlight.

“Little Xie? Why are you back today?” Jun Wu Xie hadn’t entered the room yet but Jun Wu Yao had already felt her presence, as he appeared in front of her in a flash, like a streak of lightning. His smiling eyes held a hint of wonder.

If he remembered correctly, shouldn’t Jun Wu Xie be back at least by tomorrow?

“I found something. I think I need to talk to you. Where is my mother now?” Jun Wu Xie said.

Jun Wu Yao said, “I’ll take you there.”

It was definitely not easy for Jun Wu Xie to change her plan. Jun Wu Yao didn’t delay, he held onto Jun Wu Xie and then disappeared from the courtyard.

After the marriage of Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei, Jun Gu immediately abandoned his former place of residence, and grandly moved into Han Zi Fei’s sanctuary, and dismissed the maids of the sanctuary on the grounds of not wanting the others to disturb them.

Today, only Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu were left in the Sanctuary.

When Jun Wu Yao arrived at the backyard of the sanctuary with Jun Wu Xie, Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu seemed to be discussing something. Jun Gu keenly noticed a faint presence, and was subconsciously alert, but when he turned his head, he immediately saw his daughter and son-in-law and relaxed his vigilance immediately.

“Little Wu Xie? Ye Jue? Why are you here?” Han Zi Fei got up and greeted them the moment she saw Jun Wu Xie.

“Mother, father.” Jun Wu Xie alighted from Jun Wu Yao’s arms, and looked at her parents in respect. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What happened? I heard that you are going to the Holy Land today? And you returned so early? Were you angered by that demon Luo?” Han Zi Fei looked at her daughter with a smile, the “demon Luo” obviously meant Elder Luo.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head. She looked at Han Zi Fei with a smile on her face. It was hard to imagine that Elder Luo’s youth potion would appear in her mother’s body.

No matter what kind of poison potion, there would be certain destructiveness, and Ling Er’s internal body was weak combined with her rosy face made Jun Wu Xie a little worried. She had yet to check the pulse of Han Zi Fei.

“Mother, can you show me your pulse?” Jun Wu Xie said.
