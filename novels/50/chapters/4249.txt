“Furthermore, I look good even without getting dressed up. If I do dress up, wouldn’t it make other women in the temple feel ashamed and kill themselves? I’m just thinking for the sake of the Sacred Maiden Tribe.” Han Zi Fei said with a wide smile as the words tinged with laughter filled Han Shu’s ears and made Han Shu want to jump onto Han Zi Fei and throttle her to death!

Han Zi Fei’s appearance was unmatched within the Sacred Maiden Tribe, and as she said, even if she was so undressed, her appearance has far surpassed that of the other women.

However, such crazy words turned Han Shu white with intense anger, and her eyes seemed to want to spit out fire!

Jun Wu Xie silently watched as Han Zi Fei humiliated Han Shu, as she sighed inwardly. Whether it was appearance, wisdom or eloquence, Han Shu was not up to par with Han Zi Fei. But Han Shu’s jealousy made her continuously bring disgrace onto herself; it was really a case of being tired of living.

“You ... how can you be so narcissistic!” Han Shu was made so furious by Han Zi Fei that she could think clearly, the finger pointing at Han Zi Fei was trembling in anger.

“Isn’t what I said true?” Han Zi Fei was not at all bothered by Han Shu’s accusation.

Actually ...

Although Han Zi Fei’s words were savage, they were true, but these words... made anyone who heard it furious.

Was the implicit meaning comprehended?

Did restrain mean anything?

“Well, you are not the one marrying me. Why do you need to be so affected? My looks are not meant for you, why do you need to worry so much about it?” Han Zi Fei glanced at Han Shu with little interest. She was not interested in petty fights with Han Shu, she just said a few words in order to pass the time.

Han Shu was so angry that she couldn’t utter a word. Even Duan Qi couldn’t help frowning. Han Zi Fei’s behavior was too recalcitrant and Duan Qi couldn’t help but worry. After seeing Jun Gu If she still looks like this, I wonder if it will cause anything.

This marriage was indeed ordered by His Lord. If Han Zi Fei provoked displeasure from Jun Gu, the marriage would not be overthrown. However, Jun Gu’s status was high, and his displeasure with Han Zi Fei might drag the Sacred Maiden Tribe down and this was something that Duan Qi did not want as a result.

“Sacred Maiden, the more one speaks, the more one might err. As the Sacred Maiden of our tribe, you need to pay attention to your words and actions, so as not to discredit our tribe.” Duan Qi warned.

Han Zi Fei still did not take it seriously: “Soon, it won’t be of concern.”

“...” Duan Qi’s forehead wrinkled even more.

However, everything that happened in the hall was clearly observed by one person. That person walked slowly into the hall as she looked at a haughty Han Zi Fei. The resentment in her eyes burning like fire, not unlike or lesser than Han Shu’s emotions.

“The Sacred Maiden has not changed, even after so many years. Only, the Sacred Maiden will be married to Lord Jun Gu and if you carry such a temperament still, I am afraid that it will cause a lot of trouble to Lord Jun Gu.” A cold voice suddenly cut the air in the hall.

Jun Wu Xie and others looked towards the direction of the voice and saw an exquisitely dressed Yan Xi with a tensed look on her face. She was looking at Han Zi Fei but there was nothing but ill intent in her eyes.

When Jun Wu Xie saw Yan Xi, her eyes narrowed slightly, she would never forget that it was this woman who had ruined her plan to rescue Jun Gu, and she would never forget the rhinoceros horn fragrance on this woman...
