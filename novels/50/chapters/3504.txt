Chapter 2099: Face Slapping of the Ecstatic Rapture Palm (26)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Everything that was happening had fallen right into what Jun Wu Xie had planned. She watched coldly on at the predicament that the human spirits were caught in. They only needed to come rush back into the Beast Spirits’ territory and even if the human spirits joined forces with the Weapon Spirits, they would have to tread warily as anything that concerned the Spiritual Bear concerned the entire Beast Spirit race. What they would face would then not just be one Beast Spirit, nor would it be vengeance from just a group of Beast Spirits, but the wrath of every single Beast Spirit throughout the entire Spirit World!

The Second Disciple was a little flustered. As he looked at the roaring Beast Spirits with their fangs bared, his body immediately tensed up.

Even though he was rather confident of the powers he possessed individually, he wouldn’t have the guts to dare say he would survive from an onslaught of so many Beast Spirits.

Soul Slayer then arrived belatedly, leading his Weapon Spirits. Before they had even come close, they already saw that the Second Disciple and his men were completely blocked off. Soul Slayer who had thought to rush in to snatch up the Spiritual Bear suddenly halted its advance, to stand unmoving in its spot.

“Boss? Aren’t we continuing with our pursuit?” A spiked mace hummed as it came hopping up beside Soul Slayer. Seeing that Soul Slayer did not seem to be going forward to lend their assistance, it could not help but become a little confused.

“We’re not. We’re going back!” Soul Slayer’s voice was a little cold.

“Go back? But, if we do not capture the Spiritual Bear, the Serene Spirit Tower.....” The spiked mace did not understand.

Soul Slayer suddenly said: “Do you really want the Weapon Spirits be become enemies with all the Beast Spirits?”

Soul Slayer had dared to go against the Beast Spirits back at the Serene Spirit Tower because there hadn’t been that many Beast Spirits there then, and the temptation of the Serene Spirit Tower had just been too great. But now, no matter how great the allure of the Serene Spirit Tower was, it wasn’t great enough for it to want to use its own spirit soul to exchange for it.

To declare that the Weapon Spirits were attempting to use the Spiritual Bear’s life to exchange for the Serene Spirit Tower before every single Beast Spirit in the Spirit World would undoubtedly be a declaration of war!

When it saw the sides of the mountains completely filled with Beast Spirits, it was then that Soul Slayer thought of backing out from the whole thing for the first time. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Although the Serene Spirit Tower was definitely a good thing, but it was not able to guarantee that they would be able to withstand the maniacal vengeance of the entire Beast Spirit race.

Soul Slayer’s words startled quite a number of Weapon Spirits to their senses. They realized the gravity of the entire situation and they then followed Soul Slayer to tread back the way they had come quietly, without saying a word.

The Second Disciple was already trembling with fright from the Beast Spirits’ aggressive stance and had thought that he would wait till Soul Slayer led the Weapon Spirits in before he would go against the Beast Spirits. But the instant that he had just seen the figure of Soul Slayer, he did not even have enough time to be relieved before he saw Soul Slayer suddenly turning itself around to lead the Weapon Spirits away from the place!

Immediately, the Second Disciple felt as if a bucket of cold water had been thrown right over his head, extinguishing the last sliver of hope in his heart.

Wu Jiu had been captured, Jiang Yun Long had been killed, and the Weapon Spirits had given up on providing reinforcements from fear..... The series of events seemed to have pushed the Second Disciple into a rather hard pressed position.

“If you do not wish to die, then scram!” Qiao Chu said sneeringly, as he leapt off from the shoulder of the Yin Yang Bear, staring hard at the terrified Second Disciple.

The Second Disciple stared mournfully at the horde of spirits before his eyes, his heart long filled up with numbing fear. It must be known that the Beast Spirits were the most cohesion and united race among all and even when just any one of their regular Beast Spirit was bullied, other Beast Spirits would readily lend a hand, what’s more they were talking about their Spiritual Bear here?

“Second Senior, should we, go back now?” A man standing behind the Second Disciple said fearfully. With their numbers, it would not be possible for them to be a match for the army of Beast Spirits before them.

The Second Disciple gritted his teeth tightly and then suddenly said: “Flame Dragon! Are you really going to lead the entire Beast Spirit race to openly defy the Spirit Lord’s orders! ?”
