Chapter 3087 This Is Vengeance 1

The God of Destruction turned hysterical. He had carefully plotted and planned for many years. But in the end, he was greeted with such an unacceptable result.

The otherworldly soul was lost. He could no longer activate the array for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms!

“Damn you! Damn you! Ye Jue! You are so damned!” God of Destruction roared like crazy, he walked down from the throne. His golden eyes had already turned bloodshot. He wished to find back Jun Wu Yao’s soul and crush it into powder, or imprison it for tens of thousands of years for as long as it could survive.

However, all his anger and hatred had vanished.

Jun Wu Yao chose to end his life decisively.

Whether it was the real body or the soul, it would eventually disappear in this world.

That was the most complete counterattack given to the God of Destruction and the most powerful change that God of Destruction could not stop.

A loud roar exploded from the mouth of God of Destruction. He couldn’t bear that the plan he had plotted for so long was destroyed by Jun Wu Yao. His crimson eyes looked at the silent Jun Wu Xie.

Everything was gone, he could no longer break through the void and set foot firmly in the realm that he had seeked all his life.

“Ye Jue, do you think that if you die, everything can be over? I will destroy ... destroy everything you want to protect!” The God of Destruction evoked a cruel smile as he walked towards Jun Wu Xie, step by step with a malicious glint in his eyes.

“Ye Jue did this for you? He chose to sacrifice himself for you. Hahaha ... It’s really touching, Jun Wu Xie, isn’t this very touching? Hmmm? The person whom you love, the person whom you’ve always wanted to protect had given up his own life so decisively and met such an end. What a pity ... It’s all because of you, it’s all because of you that he had chosen to die.” The words of God of Destruction were like a hypnotic chant as he pushed Jun Wu Yao’s death onto Jun Wu Xie as his blood red eyes stared venomously at her like a viper.

“Bullshit! Wu Yao ...” Han Zi Fei immediately understood the intention of God of Destruction. He clearly wanted to let Jun Wu Xie’s heart fall into huge guilt, so as to destroy Jun Wu Xie’s consciousness.

But Han Zi Fei’s words were just spoken, and God of Destruction swept away with a cold eye. The guards guarding Han Zi Fei immediately covered Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu’s mouth, unwilling to let them say any further.

In the silent hall, only the breath of death enveloped everyone’s heart as the God of Destruction looked as if he had just walked out of hell, every step was imbued with pure evil.

“Do you love him very much? Do you love him as much as he loves you? He is willing to give up his life for you, how about you? Do you wish to continue to survive with his sacrifice? Escape from here with his soul fragments?” The God of Destruction approached Jun Wu Xie step by step, watching Jun Wu Xie standing motionless, the vicious cold light flashed under his eyes.

Jun Wu Yao ruined his lifelong dream. Even if he died, he could not remove the hatred in his heart. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He wanted to destroy Jun Wu Yao’s loved one, the one whom he had sacrificed himself in order to protect. He would use the cruelest array in the world to let Jun Wu Xie live forever in eternal life and never get relief.

That was his revenge against Jun Wu Yao. Even if Jun Wu Ya’s soul had already dissipated!
