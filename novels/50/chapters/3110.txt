Chapter 3111 Jun Mo Ye’s Confusion 1

As the child of two gods, all Jun Mo Ye wanted to do everyday was climb on to Lord Meh Meh, hug Blood Sacrificial Rabbit under the sun and watch the stars with her uncle, the Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus.

She was only three years old but already had a dilemma.

She had followed her parents to her grandparents house but....

“Mother, why do I have two maternal grandfathers?” Jun Mo Ye looked up at her mother who was cradling her, confusion written all over her cherubic face.

Everyone in the Jun family was gathered in the great hall of the Jun residence, enjoying each other’s company. However when the innocent child asked that question, the entire hall fell into silence.

Jun Xian, whose energy beguiled his white haired appearance, looked at his confused granddaughter, turned his gaze to Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei and coughed to attract their attention.

Jun Gu was momentarily at a loss and did not know what to do.

Over four years ago, after the God of Destruction had been defeated and the Three Realms returned to peace, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao left the Three Realms to reside in the Heavenly Realm. Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei then returned to the Lower Three Realms to live with Jun Xian, Jun Qing and the others in the Jun residence. Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao visited occasionally and even though distance was no longer an issue with their powers, each visit was still cherished by all. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Little Ye Ye, why do you ask?” Han Zi Fei looked at her husband’s state with amusement, smiled at the child and reached out her hand saying, “Come to grandmother.”

After receiving a nod of approval from her mother, Jun Mo Ye slowly made her way to her grandmother’s side, asking to be picked up.

“I saw a grandfather in a room in the courtyard.” Jun Mo Ye looked at his grandmother with her dark gold eyes as she said it.

Instantly, the entire family understood what was going on.

When Jun Gu was chosen by the God of Destruction, he was given a new body. When he and Han Zi Fei returned to the Lower Realm, he discovered that his original body had been kept in good condition by the family. However, his soul had stabilized in his current body and transferring it might have had negative side effects so after discussing with the family, the decision was made to remain in his current body.

As for his original body, nobody in the family was willing to get rid of it even though it was just an empty shell. In any case, with Jun Wu Xie’s power protecting it, the body was incorruptible. So it just sat in a room in the courtyard and a servant would clean it regularly.

Jun Gu always felt a little awkward regarding this matter and whenever he saw his other self lying motionless on the bed, he always felt a little breathless with awe.

Since neither his father nor his wife was willing to put that body into the ground, he had no choice but to get used to it.

As the years passed, Jun Gu had all but forgotten about it and did not expect his granddaughter to discover it.

“That’s your grandfather too. He has two bodies and can switch them whenever one is tired. Isn’t he great?” Han Zi Fei smiled at her granddaughter.
