“Bai Zhu, is there any news on Yan Hai?” asked Long Yao.

Bai Zhu lowered his eyes and reported respectfully, “There is none. Since the incident, he is nowhere to be found. I have sent my men around the city to check, once there is news I will report to you immediately.”

“Are you sure the people around Yan Hai are so important? Could we have provoked him so much that he will avenge them regardless of the rules??” Long Yao had a hint of doubt in his voice. The mobilisation of the Top Ten Exponents to perform such vicious attacks on Jun Wu Xie’s companions was entirely due to Bai Zhu.

Bai Zhu narrowed his eyes and reaffirmed, “Your subject is sure, they are always together, they have not left his side since they entered the Sacred City. Yan Hai is aloof by nature and does not keep much company, not even interacting much with Nangong Lie, who is such a famous person. Yet this bunch of people have been with him since they were in the Sea Spirit City, based on my observations, they are as close as a family.”

Not Master and subordinates, but rather like companions. The term “companion” was almost unheard of in the Upper Realm and it was only after prolonged observation did Bai Zhu come to this conclusion.

Just as Bai Mo had guessed, Bai Zhu was never sincere towards Jun Wu Xie. He had toiled for many years and put in much blood and sweat in White Night City in order to fight and obtain supremacy over the 72 cities. But Jun Wu Xie’s appearance completely broke the existing structure of the 72 cities and shattered Bai Zhu’s long held dream!

How could Bai Zhu not hate her?

What he had worked so hard for was so easily taken away by someone. How could he live it down? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, Bai Zhu knew that going against Jun Wu Xie based on his strength alone was an exercise in futility.

Bai Zhu was no fool and knew that he was not her match. Cooperating with Long Yao was his best option as Jun Wu Xie was in possession of Dual Spirit Rings. Moreover, she had not been called on by His Lord and he knew this was his best and last chance.

Murdering Jun Wu Xie’s companions and forcing her into a mistake would give Long Yao an opportunity to strike by using the might of the Sacred City to force her into submission. Without Jun Wu Xie, the 72 cities would revert to the chaos of old and it would be an opportune time for the White Night City to rise!

Bai Zhu’s ambition had led him to this stage with no room for retreat. He was very clear that Jun Wu Xie was highly intelligent and after the attack on her companions, would quickly piece together the events of the past few days. She could easily kill Bai Zhu with a flick of her wrist and as long as she had not retaliated against the Top Ten Exponents, Bai ZHo dared not leave Long Yao’s side.

“Alright, from today onwards, Fan Jinghe and the rest of you, walk around the Sacred City openly. I want to see if Yan Hai will defy His Lord’s orders!” Long Yao said with a cold laugh. According to the rules of the selection, challenging the Top Ten could only be done within the parameters of the contest and the Top Ten were not scheduled to take part until the end. Under normal circumstances, Jun Wu Xie could possibly have waited but could she still do so if she was filled with anger?
