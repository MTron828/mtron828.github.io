While waiting for the meal to be ready, Fei Yan moved discreetly to Rong Ruo’s side as she was talking to Fan Zhuo. Rong Ruo could only pretend she didn’t notice his presence, and continued to discuss with Fan Zhuo about the possible movements from Long Xuan City.

It was Fan Zhuo, however, who felt a sharp gaze upon his person. And when he looked up, he saw that Fei Yan was staring at him in an unblinking, unfriendly manner.

“...” Fan Zhuo glanced at Rong Ruo, who was still talking to him, and instantly felt that he was getting innocently implicated in something just with his mere presence.

Among them, only Jun Wu Xie and Rong Ruo were women, but years of life and death situations had long blurred any gender distinction between them. He did not treat Jun Wu Xie and Rong Ruo as women at all. It was simply pure brotherhood!

But...

As far as Fei Yan’s reaction was concerned, it was absolutely anger.

As Rong Ruo ignored him, Fei Yan would stare at himself. Fan Zhuo felt a tingling sensation on his scalp as he turned his head knowingly towards Qiao Chu, who was eating some fruits as he wandered around freely, and said: “Er Qiao, go with me to the backyard, I want to speak with you.”

Qiao Chu, who was waiting for delicious food, was suddenly shouted at by Fan Zhuo, and he was stunned and blanked out for a bit before returning to himself.

“Ah? Ok ...” Qiao Chu responded, but his mind was a mess.

Fan Zhuo had already stood up, dragging the clueless Qiao Chu to the backyard, with the quick witted Hua Yao following them.

In the hall, only Jun Wu Yao, Jun Wu Xie, Fei Yan and Rong Ruo were left.

Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie had not spoken, they just sat there drinking tea, the sense of their presence was almost zero.

Without Fan Zhuo and the others to use as a shield, Rong Ruo just wanted to avoid Fei Yan’s intense staring. She had no shields left. After being stared at for a long while, Rong Ruo finally returned Fei Yan’s gaze.

“Stop playing around. Now is not the time to be fooling around.” Rong Ruo’s voice held a trace of helpless.

“I’m not fooling around.” Fei Yan wrinkled his nose. “Since when did I fool around with you? All that I have said is true, but you just don’t want to believe it.”

Fei Yan was very depressed. Although he was usually a little sloppy and carefree, but with regards to that matter, his feelings towards Rong Ruo, he never once joked about. But he didn’t know if Rong Ruo intentionally or unintentionally treated his words as a joke.

Rong Ruo took a deep breath and looked at Fei Yan, who had grown up together with her. Maybe it was because the two of them were brought back by Yan Bugui those years ago, Fei Yan had always cling on to her. Before it wasn’t much, but since that incident, their relationship gradually changed, and it caused Rong Ruo to be vexed.

“I didn’t have a good rest yesterday. I’m going back to my room, I won’t eat.” Rong Ruo sighed as she stood up, without waiting for Fei Yan’s response, left.

Fei Yan was left in the hall. As shameless as he was, looking at Rong Ruo’s departing figure, he wasn’t able to hide the desolation within his eyes. He flattened his lips, lowered his head, turned and left for the backyard.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao observed all of it, but said nothing.

In the backyard, Ye Jie was squatting on the edge of the flowerbed, watching Lord Meh Meh and the Blood Rabbit sunbathing on the grass.

Because Jun Wu Xie had been very busy, these two silly beasts were taken care of by Ye She and Ye Mei. Today, since the two of them were chased into the kitchen, and Ye Gu was simply too impatient, so he asked Ye Jie to take over.
