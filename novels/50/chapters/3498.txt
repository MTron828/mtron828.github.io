Rong Ruo’s brows knitted up.

Suddenly, a black shadow came hurtling down from the skies, to crash heavily right into the midst of the opposing Beast Spirits and human spirits!

In the instant that that black shadow fell, it kicked up an enormous cloud of dust. When the dust cloud finally dissipated, the appearance of that black shadow was then revealed to everyone.

That one look however caused everyone to be properly stunned. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Lying there in a heap was not anybody else but the haughty, high and mighty Wu Jiu!

A silvery figure then descended right after. Under everyone’s speechless flabbergasted gaze, the silver figure landed right beside Wu Jiu, the magnificent figure of Jun Wu Xie clad in Selvan’s Armour.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the stunned human spirit reinforcements and she suddenly pressed the light sword she held in her hand against Wu Jiu’s neck.

“Whichever one of you takes another step forward, I will kill him immediately.” Her voice was as chilly as ice!

Within the pair of eyes that were showing, blood curling murder could be seen emanating from them!

Wu Jiu’s Second Disciple was frozen in a daze. He stared in disbelief at Jun Wu Xie, where his gaze then fell upon the crumpled form of Wu Jiu under Jun Wu Xie’s foot.

[The leader of the human spirits, Spirit Master Wu Jiu..... who reig ns above all human spirits, the Wu Jiu who was so powerful he was unbeatable..... has actually been..... defeated?]

[How is this possible! ?]

Wu Jiu’s Second Disciple was shocked into speechlessness. Not even in his dreams would he have thought that his Master would fall in defeat at the hands of another person.

Wu Jiu was in an extremely wretched state, the clothes on him badly tattered and torn, his power of the spirit spilling out from the slash wounds inflicted by the light sword. His entire body was in so much pain that it felt as if it was falling apart, his face haggard and highly aggrieved. He was lying with his face on the floor, and Jun Wu Xie’s foot was on his back, unable to move an inch.

However elegant looking Wu Jiu was in the past, he was now equally just as wretched.

“Mas..... Master.....” The Second Disciple’s voice was already beginning to tremble. All of this had gone far beyond anything he could have expected.

The human spirits fell deadly silent. But for the Beast Spirits, the fire of hope had been reignited. They stared with intense anger at Wu Jiu under Jun Wu Xie’s foot, that shining silver figure reflected in their eyes like a saviour descended!

Soul Slayer noticed that things had taken a strange turn and he forcibly put some distance between itself and Flame Dragon, to go rushing over right before Jun Wu Xie.

“Don’t move.” Jun Wu Xie swung her eyes over to look at Soul Slayer, the point of the sword of light pressing slightly into Wu Jiu’s neck.

Soul Slayer immediately halted its approach towards Jun Wu Xie, the two blood red rubies seemingly filling up with a sliver of shock.

Because of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, interaction between Soul Slayer and Wu Jiu had also grown more frequent. Although Soul Slayer still did not like Wu Jiu from the bottom of his heart, it still had to admit that Wu Jiu wielded the strongest power among the human spirits, where even the previous Spirit Master that had retreated into seclusion was not as powerful as him.

But, that very Wu Jiu had been defeated? And at the hands of an relatively unknown young female human spirit. That unbelievable fact, made it hard for Soul Slayer to be able to digest.

“Let me Master go! Or not a single spirit present here today can even think of escaping from here today!” The Second Disciple said through gritted teeth.

Jun Wu Xie raised her chin slightly, her clear eyes turning to look scathingly at the Second Disciple who just threw down some harsh words.

“Let him go? Impossible. But you can try me. If you dare to take just a single step forward, I will slice off his head right in an instant. Using our lives in exchange for Wu Jiu’s wretched life, we would have earned.”

The Second Disciple glared with hatred in his eyes, like he wanted to skin Jun Wu Xie alive and swallow her whole.

“What do you really want?” The Second Disciple then asked.

Jun Wu Xie laughed derisively. “Get your people and the Weapon Spirits out of here. Once we return back to the Beast Spirits’ territory, I will then naturally release your Master.”
