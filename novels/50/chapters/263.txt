Chapter 264: “First Impression (3)”

Mu Chen walked up and stood before Jun Wu Xie, staring at the unusually calm youth before his stern expression broke into a smile.

“What’s your name?”

“Jun Xie.” Jun Wu Xie replied.

The youths who were anticipating the expulsion suddenly felt that situation seemed rather odd, as the Qing Yun Clan’s Elder was being rather mild. Shouldn’t he be throwing Jun Wu Xie out by now?

“Will you be interested to come to the Cloud Treading Peak?” Mu Chen asked gently.

Jun Wu Xie was surprised, but her face showed no emotion.

Mu Chen’s words created a stir among the applicants as they had expected to see Jun Wu Xie thrown out for her actions, but they could only stare at Jun Wu Xie in shock at what was happening.

How did it come to this?

The brat who challenged and offended the sanctity of the Qing Yun Clan should have been taken down! But he had been earned the interest of the Elder of Cloud Treading Peak instead!?

If he were to be accepted into the Cloud Treading Peak, he would immediately become a full fledged disciple of the Qing Yun Clan!

Who would have thought that Lady Luck would cast her smile upon such an unremarkable petite youth!?

All that was needed was just for Jun Wu Xie to agree, and she would become a disciple of the Qing Yun Clan, a true and earnest disciple of the Qing Yun Clan’s inner house!

That was a stroke of luck that many of them could only dream of, and the other youths harboured a deep jealousy as they clenched their jaws in rage.

While waiting to hear Jun Wu Xie’s reply, another voice sounded suddenly!

“Hold it, Elder Mu.” A sharp and sinister voice suddenly spoke and it could be clearly heard by all present. Ke Cang Ju seemed shrouded in gloom as he walked towards Mu Chen, his hideous face was unreadable.

Mu Chen frowned, his displeasure with Ke Cang Ju visible.

“What’s the matter, Elder Ke?”

Ke Cang Ju dragged his feet over the distance, his bowed back making him look more sinister. The hem of his robe had old bronze bells attached to it and they jingled with every step that Ke Cang Ju took.

“Those two lads there, I want them.” Ke Cang Ju raised his hand, and a wrinkled bony finger pointed at Jun Wu Xie and the stunned Qiao Chu who stood beside her. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mu Chen’s heart sank at that moment.

“Elder Ke, what is the meaning of this? I had earlier declared that Cloud Treading Peak would accept her as a disciple. If Elder Ke is in need of more disciples, go look elsewhere!”

Ke Cang Ju scoffed: “Does that mean Elder Mu is making things difficult for me? I will have these two lads today! If Elder Mu has any objections to it, you can go take it up with the Sovereign. If the Sovereign agrees with you, I will hand over the lad, Jun Xie, over to you. If he disagrees, it would be better if Elder Mu remains silent.”

Mu Chen clenched his fists, hidden within his sleeves, as he stared furiously at Ke Cang Ju. Everyone knew he was on extremely bad terms with Qin Yue, and Cloud Treading Peak had always received the least resources. In contrast, Ke Cang Ju enjoyed the best support and was on friendliest terms with Qin Yue. If he were to go ask Qin Yue, Qin Yue would never stand on his side and would surely reject him.

This fella, was obviously hijacking!

The two Elders started arguing in front of everyone, and it only made the others youths who were deeply jealous of Jun Wu Xie hate her even more.

What was so great about that brat that he was able to cause two Elders of the Qing Yun Clan to argue and fight over him!?

Unknown to everyone, the Jun Wu Xie whom the youths were jealous off, did not feel a single bit of joy. She frowned slightly at Ke Cang Ju who had suddenly just butted in. She had not expected that Ke Cang Ju would step forward to snatch from Mu Chen.
