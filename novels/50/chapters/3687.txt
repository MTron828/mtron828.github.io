When the people of the Night Regime stepped into the city, the vast streets were empty and not a figure could be found. Everything was strangely quiet.

Ye Sha narrowed his eyes and looked at the strange atmosphere around him. He secretly made a sign to his companions behind him and the members of the Night Regime immediately pulled the reins. They went into a formation and formed a circle as they carefully observed the situation around them.

The next moment, the city gates suddenly slammed shut!

That thunderous sound echoed under the silent skies!

Outside the city gates, Qiao Chu and the others who had came with their teams had yet to enter the city and was directly blocked from the sudden closure of the gates.

“Damn it! So there was an ambush after all!” Fei Yan cursed out with rage when the city gates suddenly slammed shut.

The huge city gates had cut off their connection with the Night Regime who had been isolated from within.

“Break this door down for me!” Qiao Chu immediately dismounted his horse and the Flame Dragon Gauntlets appeared on both his hands as a scorching flame lit up before him.

In the city, Ye Sha and his men were vigilant as they stood and scanned the surroundings. The next second, countless figures from all over the city poured out as tens of thousands surrounded them in the blink of an eye!

Qiu Yun walked slowly into the encirclement with his hands behind him, each and every step was filled with arrogance.

“Dark Regions? Night Regime? Oh... It’s really a bunch of sly mice. And here I thought how great the Night Regime was but looking at the lot of you now, it’s just a bunch of wastes that only dare to imitate the dog and steal chickens.” Qiu Yun raised his eyebrows slightly as he looked at the members of the Night Regime had been thoroughly surrounded. His arrogant gaze swept over them with undisguised contempt. It was as if those standing before him were not a group of people but were just some dogs that were not worth mentioning.

Ye Sha remained silent as he looked at Qiu Yun. He was not at all affected by the words of Qiu Yun, he only secretly signalled to the others of the Night Regime as they gradually narrowed the distance between them, as they stood in a defensive stance, preventing the enemy from any sudden attacks.

“Why so silent? Not going to say anything anymore? Don’t you like to destroy things? You have already destroyed more than a hundred palaces and raided the various divisions of the Nine Temples. Did you really think yourselves as omnipotent and invincible? Well, I would like to see today, how great your skills are and see if you are able to leave this place alive.” Qiu Yun’s lips curled up into a sneer, the chaos that the Night Regime had ensued had completely aroused all the anger in his heart. Today’s action which he had employed an overwhelming manpower was just to let this bunch of wastes know that their trifle actions were nothing in his eyes!

What about the Dark Regions? That’s all there is to the Dark Emperor’s power!

They were merely just a circus act from the Middle Realm and could not enter the eyes of the Upper Realm!

The atmosphere in the entire city had became extremely stifling at this moment. Qiu Yun had mobilised a huge force of Gold Spirits from the Upper Realm and in addition, there were also the elite disciples from the Heavenly Wolf Temple and the Obscure Soul Temple which had exceeded ten thousand. To have over ten thousand people surround a few dozen, even though the Night Regime were the very people who had quaked the entire Middle Realm but it was still difficult to contend against such a huge number of people. Facing such a staggering number of enemies, it would be a battle of attrition and would wear them out!

Qiu Yun was not in a hurry to send the Night Regime to hell, the past half month, the shame he had suffered would be paid back a thousand times today!
