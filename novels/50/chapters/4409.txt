Chapter 3005 All“s fair in war 2

“Did City Lord Yan have a good rest yesterday?” Su Ruiying enquired with a smile. The morning sunlight was bright and dewy but when it fell on her face, it could not remove the darkness on her face.

Jun Wu Xie took a seat while Jun Wu Yao very consciously stood behind her as if he was really just her servant.

“It was alright.” Jun Wu Xie said lightly.

Su Ruiying did not say much and just smiled. The breakfast was eaten in relative silence. She asked Jun Wu Xie when she would accept the cleansing and she replied saying that she still had some matters to settle and would go through with it once they were done.

Su Ruiying did not think too much about it and expressed her agreement without asking further.

After breakfast, Jun Wu Xie left together with Jun Wu Yao. Su Ruiying personally sent them off and watched as they disappeared from sight.

The smile on her face had faded away.

The ghoul masked man quietly approached Su Ruiying from the side. Su Ruiying looked at him and asked, “Where is it?” The ghoul masked man knelt down and reported with trepidation, “Your servant is useless. The puppet was nowhere to be found, all I could see was a piece of the puppet’s clothing in the room.”

As he said that, he handed over the piece of cloth he had retrieved from Jun Wu Xie’s table to Su Ruiying.

Su Ruiying looked at the cloth, saw the burn mark and threw it on the ground.

“Looks like Yan Hai is quite intelligent, the puppet seems to have been burnt and destroyed. What a pity that I don’t know what he said last night.” Su Ruiying sighed with regret that she could not learn what Jun Wu Xie had said the night before.

“Lady Ying, hasn’t Yan Hai been chosen by His Lord to be the fifth Knight of Destruction? Would it be good if His Lord found out you are spying on him like this?” The ghoul masked man asked carefully.

With Su Ruiying’s status in the Upper Realm, she could do almost anything she wanted but when it came to fellow Knights of Destruction, there was always a certain level of respect that had to be observed.

Jun Wu Xie had gained His Lord’s favour and would eventually become a Knight of Destruction. Su Ruiying’s actions of inviting her to her residence to spy on her was a bit overboard.

Su Ruiying stared daggers at the ghoul masked man, causing him to tremble in fear.

“What do you know? No matter what I do now, do you think he will remember later on? Moreover, although Yan Hai is untouchable, his bodyguard is nobody special. But even though he is not very outstanding, he has a certain charisma and that is what I lack in my collection.” As Su Ruiying spoke, she started exuding a manic obsessiveness that shocked the ghoul masked man.

Whoever Su Ruiying set her sights on would not have a good ending. Even after they died, they would be stuck in limbo as her playthings. The ghoul masked man had seen this many a time but was unable to have any sympathy for them.
