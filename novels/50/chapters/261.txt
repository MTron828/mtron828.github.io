Chapter 262: “First Impression (1)”

Jun Wu Xie stood unmoving, rooted to the spot. Before Qiao Chu could even react, Jun Wu Xie stretched out her hand and gripped the wrist of the Qing Yun Clan disciple.

In the next moment, the disciple was flung heavily to the ground!

“How dare you! Are you tired of living!? The Qing Yun Clan will not tolerate such impunity!” What audacity! Laying your hands on our disciples even before being accepted!?

The shouts that erupted shocked the crowd. They had been focused on displaying their best talents when the shouts shocked them into silence as they stared at the scene where the shouts had come from. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When they saw what had happened, they were all visibly stunned.

Was that brat asking to be killed? He dared strike a Qing Yun Clan disciple? Did he even want to enter the Qing Yun Clan!?

Some were shocked, some were smiling in glee. Everyone was competing for a spot to enlisted into the Qing Yun Clan, and with every competitor that dropped out, it just meant a higher chance for the rest.

All of them thought, Jun Wu Xie had just forfeited her chance!

Qiao Chu was frozen in place, and sweat trickled down his face. This kid was usually so quiet, and without any warning, he had suddenly placed them both in such deep trouble!

They were still being assessed for goodness sake, and Jun Xie just suddenly decided to strike at a Qing Yun Clan disciple right before the Elders! They would definitely be thrown off the mountain next!

“I’m so dead! Brother Hua is so gonna kill me.” Qiao Chu cried tearlessly as he stood beside Jun Wu Xie. Realising that Jun Xie had just stirred a hornet’s nest, Qiao Chu nevertheless readied himself to take on the Qing Yun Clan disciples. Even if both of them were to be thrown out, he must never allow the Qing Yun Clan to lay a hand on this genius right beside him.

Looking at his thin arms and legs, Jun Xie would not be able to take a beating. If anything untoward was to happen to the genius, Brother Hua won’t be the only one beating him up.

Not only the eyes of the mass of youths were attracted to the scene, even the Elders turned to look towards Jun Wu Xie.

The Elder with a long flowing white beard frowned and exclaimed with annoyance: “Kids nowadays, have no respect for rules and regulations. The Sovereign had not been wrong, this is a circus!”

Mu Chen stared darkly at Jun Wu Xie, but did not say anything. No one had noticed, that when the silent Ke Cang Ju had turned to see what had created such a ruckus, his eyes had flashed a moment, but had been suppressed just as quickly.

Just as the disciple was about to make his move, Jun Wu Xie suddenly said: “Spirit level orange, third stage, upper body veins and arteries congestion, lower body hollow, cold artery constricted.....”

A string of names of the body’s veins and arteries overwhelmed the disciple as his hand froze in mid air, his mouth gaped open in amazement as he stared at Jun Wu Xie.

What Jun Wu Xie had mentioned earlier were the major arteries that were critical to the development of spiritual powers. As a disciple of the Qing Yun Clan, he was naturally aware of the condition of his own veins and arteries within his body. An orange leveled spirit at twenty over years of age was nothing noteworthy in the Qing Yun Clan, and he had always pursued vigorously to become skilled in medicine or attain higher spiritual powers, but a detailed diagnosis of his body’s veins and arteries by his Teacher had told him exactly what Jun Wu Xie had just said!

“How..... how did you know?” The disciple asked, his face pale.

Jun Wu Xie retracted her hand from the man’s wrist, and wiped at her fingertips carefully with a handkerchief before she said slowly: “With Flame Tailed Flowers, you can treat the midsection to relieve the upper body congestion, use the leaves of Moist Luck plant to soak in baths to clear out the lower body, and.....”

Jun Wu Xie went on without pausing as she gave the solutions and treatments for every condition that the man’s veins and arteries were inflicted with. When she finished, she took a step back and stared at the stunned disciple.

If her long narration had fallen on the ears of the youths behind her, it might not have meant anything to them. But the Elders of the Qing Yun Clan were all well versed in Medicine, and they only needed to hear those words and they fully understood the significance of those very words!
