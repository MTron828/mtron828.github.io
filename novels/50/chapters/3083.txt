Real body?

The words of the God of Destruction suddenly gave Jun Wu Xie’s heart an ominous hunch, and her eyes fell on the man Feng Ming was pushing.

From the illusion given by the Spirit Tree, Jun Wu Xie once saw Jun Wu Yao from the previous life. At that time, his eyes were more of an arrogance and disdain, as if he wanted to destroy everything in the world. That look was exactly what she had seen when Jun Wu Yao had just walked out of the cave carrying with him a trace of cynicism. But after getting along with Jun Wu Yao for a long time, the look in his eyes gradually changed. There was more gentleness in his eyes, and a little less of a grudge.

Jun Wu Xie was very reluctant to believe the words of God of Destruction. But the fact made her believe. Her eyes swept over to Jun Wu Yao’s expression. From the subtle changes in his face, Jun Wu Xie knew that what God of Destruction said was true. No one would know better than Jun Wu Yao the reliability of the truth.

But...

What should she do?

Just when Jun Wu Xie hesitated on how to take care of the predicament in front of her, Jun Wu Yao standing beside her suddenly made a move. He suddenly raised his hand as the black dark spirit instantly rushed towards the ‘him’ who was seated on the wheelchair!

The speed was so fast that Jun Wu Xie had no chance to speak.

When Feng Ming saw the dark spirit rushing towards the “other Jun Wu Yao” on the wheelchair, he immediately stood in front of the wheelchair and used his power to counter it. However, even so, Feng Ming’s figure was blasted out in an instant as he fell directly to the corner of the hall and vomited out a mouthful of blood when he fell to the ground.

Jun Wu Yao’s actions made everyone in the hall dumbfounded.

As a servant serving the gods, Feng Ming had been infected with great divine power for thousands of years. Even though he was not a real god, his strength was not inferior to Chi Yan.

Even so, Feng Ming couldn’t even get up after a blow from Jun Wu Yao.

It was conceivable that Jun Wu Yao’s prescription was so powerful. If there was no Feng Ming around, he would directly hit Jun Wu Yao’s real body. I was afraid that it would be completely destroyed.

“Ye Jue! Are you crazy? You even want to destroy your real body?” The God of Destruction suddenly widened his eyes. He never thought that Jun Wu Yao would do such an extreme act.

“Don’t you want to die? Tell you the truth. As early as when you came to the Three Realms, I had already noticed you. At that time, you had yet to separate from your real body. It was me who used divine power to separate your soul from your body and gave you a new body. If you dare to destroy your real body, your soul will disappear with it. Have you thought about it? ” The God of Destruction stared intently at Jun Wu Yeo, he had witnessed his crazy moments before but he had never seen Jun Wu Yao so ready to risk everything like now.

When Jun Wu Yao came to the Three Realms that year, he did not use his real body. At that time, Jun Wu Yao was so powerful that it made people tremble in his presence. The God of Destruction knew that if Jun Wu Yao was kept in that state, it would be impossible to take him down.

Therefore, the God of Destruction took advantage of his own convenience as the God of the Three Realms and thought of all ways to separate Jun Wu Yao’s soul and body.
