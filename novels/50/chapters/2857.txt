The joy of recognition filled this family of three. After a long silence, Han Zi Fei finally calmed down her emotions. She wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and stepped back a little. When she saw Jun Wu Xie’s wet shoulder, she couldn’t help laughing.

That laughter influenced Jun Gu and Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie turned her head to look at her shoulder with a shy smile on her face. The smile made Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei feel unusually warm.

“Now that my daughter is found, what are you going to do now?” Han Zi Fei straightened her emotions and stared at her man.

Jun Gu’s scalp felt numb. He understood that his wife and child had to settle some matters after this.

“I am not sure too ... My mind has been confused during this time. It seems to be sober, but it is not actually. I see many things with my own eyes. But my actions are completely beyond my control.” Jun Gu sighed.

Since the last time he met Jun Wu Xie in the Soul World, Jun Gu’s consciousness had been a little chaotic. He was no longer ignorant of anything that had happened to him. He could see and hear but he could not respond to it. All his actions seemed to be connected by countless thin lines and controlled in the hands of others. He could not refuse or choose. He could only be guided by others.

Han Zi Fei and Jun Wu Xie looked at each other. Jun Wu Xie knew something.

“It seems that I guessed right. The Upper Realm is controlling father with rhinoceros horn incense. But since father woke from his consciousness the last time, he has not been completely suppressed. So long he owns the rhinoceros horn incense, he can never regain back himself.” Jun Wu Xie said.

“What now? He has taken your elixir. In future, will he ...” Han Zi Fei hesitated a little.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“I have broken the rhinoceros horn’s link to father. Even if this rhinoceros horn still exists, it will not have any effect on his father. I can assure you of that, mother.

Han Zi Fei breathed a sigh of relief, glancing at Jun Gu with some worries.

Jun Gu smiled a bit helplessly. He didn’t expect that he would fall into such a state. In fact, he had died on the battlefield many years ago. No matter what, he still had a day to live. These few years, he lived with humiliations. He was controlled by others. Even his wife and daughter had to worry so much for him.

Even if Jun Wu Xie and Han Zi Fei didn’t say anything, Jun Gu knew very well that they would appear here in order to save themselves.

Although ... He had caused a lot of trouble for his wife and daughter. The salvation from the two women he loved so much, Jun Gu’s heart was really happy ... But ... He dare not say it to Han Zi Fei.

“Ah ... that’s, your grandpa and uncle, are they all right?” Jun Gu looked at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie nodded, “Very well, they thought you had died in the country, only later ...”

Jun Wu Xie simply and clearly explained what happened in the Lower Realm to Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei. Han Zi Fei had contacted Jun Wu Xie before. She heard that Jun Wu Xie said that she was somewhat prepared. However Jun Gu had no idea that while he was away these years, the Three Realms had undergone such a huge turmoil!
