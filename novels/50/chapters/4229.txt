Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Since Han Shu left Han Zi Fei’s residence, she made up her mind to win over that dual Spirit Rings exponent, but Jun Wu Xie’s previous indifference towards her was not fake. Han Shu pondered about it and figured that it was probably because of her impetuous words that had left a bad impression of herself with Jun Wu Xie. And that had led to the coldness Jun Wu Xie exhibited towards her. After which she crafted a plan by using her apology to resolve the ‘dissatisfaction’ that Jun Wu Xie ahd with her.

However, Jun Wu Xie had only raised her eyes slightly to look at Han Shu, who was obviously putting up an act in front of her, with utmost calm in her eyes.

Han Shu had thought by apologising in advance, even if Jun Wu Xie had any dissatisfaction with her, she would take this opportunity to ease the tension a little, but...

The smile on her face had turned almost stiff, but Jun Wu Xie still looked at her with those cold eyes.

Han Shu could feel herself squeezing out cold sweat, and struggled to maintain the smile on her face. She then drank the cup of fine wine she still held in her hand, and tipped it over to show Jun Wu Xie that it was emptied.

“City Lord Yan, please do not take offense with me, I have apologised to you.” After Han Shu drank the wine, the alcohol added a little blush to her otherwise fair face, and under the candle light, she looked more beautiful.

However, there was still no reaction on Jun Wu Xie’s face, she had neither accepted Han Shu’s apology nor refused.

This made Han Shu, who had prepared a full belly of moves, want to puke. At that moment, she did not know what to do...

Duan Qi looked a little anxious, Han Shu and Han Zi Fei were born of the same mother, but because they had different fathers, their pureblood lineage was very different. However, the most likely candidate to have a pureblood descendant, if possible, Duan Qi hoped that it would be Han Shu and Jun Wu Xie.

If Jun Wu Xie wanted Han Shu to be his wife, the Sacred Maiden Tribe would not say anything, as long as if the female baby bore by Han Shu was left with the tribe.

However, Jun Wu Xie’s unresponsiveness really caused Duan Qi to start pouring out cold sweat on Han Shu’s behalf.

After Han Shu’s limbs had turned numb from Jun Wu Xie’s unnerving stare, a figure appeared at the entrance of the hall.

“Today is really lively, our Sacred Maiden Tribe hasn’t entertained guests in a long time.” The gentle and pleasant female voice echoed in the quiet hall and had surprised everyone who heard it.

When Jun Wu Xie heard the familiar voice, her hands, which were hidden within her sleeves, could not help but involuntarily clenched themselves.

Han Shu, who was standing opposite her, felt as if she was struck by lightning when she heard the voice, as she turned abruptly to look at the person who had entered the hall.

The hall was already covered by moonlight, and the person, who was clad in a pure black dress, walked slowly into the bright hall. Although it was such a somber black, however when worn by the person, it didn’t seem at all rigid, instead it looked as if that colour belonged to her.

Han Zi Fei!

Han Shu stared unbelievably at Han Zi Fei, who was walking into the hall, and her eyes seemed to want to spit out fire.

Han Zi Fei already looked amazing. Although she had not applied any makeup today, she was still more beautiful than any of the women in this hall. Even the well-dressed Han Shu, when compared to Han Zi Fei, lost.

There was indeed such a person, even dressed in coarse linen, who would be unable to hide her absolute beauty.

Han Zi Fei was that person. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Han Shu’s hand holding the wine glass tightened a little, and the smile on the corner of her mouth disappeared in an instant.
