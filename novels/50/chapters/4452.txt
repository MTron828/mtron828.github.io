Chapter 3048 The Lost Temples 8

“All those who have witnessed those glories are dead, you can go ask them.” Jun Wu Xie fired back coldly. She knew what Qin Qi was trying to do and had no interest in trading blows with a peon.

Qin Qi went completely white, he had never imagined Jun Wu Xie to be so cold and hard. He was under the impression that no matter what, she had to give Chi Yan some face. After all, she was a newly minted Knight of Destruction and needed Chi Yan’s help to gain His Lord’s trust even more.

In the end....

Not only did Jun Wu Xie not give any face, she completely embarrassed Qin Qi. Even someone as thick-skinned as Qin Qi could not bear it anymore.

“Ah, I’m a little sleepy and will be going back to my carriage to rest.” Sensing a bad situation, Su Ruiying made an excuse to leave.

She was afraid of Jun Wu Xie and even more afraid of Chi Yan and so had no interest in participating in any conflict between the two.

“Lord Yan has a good sense of humour...” Qin Qi laughed dryly but his eyes betrayed a venomous look. “Since Lord Yan has no interest in this, I will not bother you further.”

After that, Qin Qi rose and walked directly towards Chi Yan’s carriage.

After Qin Qi had gone, Gu Ying spoke.

“Lord Yan does not seem to like Qin Qi?”

Jun Wu Xie looked at Gu Ying, keeping silent.

“However, if I were in your shoes, I wouldn’t have been so harsh with him. Qin Qi is not strong but he only dared to ask you that because he was directed to do so by Chi Yan. Chi Yan is already suspicious of you and treating Qin Qi like that could lead to more conflict in the future.” Gu Ying just wanted to state his opinion, not caring whether Jun Wu Xie replied to him.

Jun Wu Xie replied, “Instead of caring so much about me, perhaps Highness Ying should think more about your own situation.”

The smile on Gu Ying’s face faded in an instant, and he looked at Jun Wu Xie differently.

“What does Lord Yan mean by that?”

“Highness Ying knows what I mean.” Jun Wu Xie got up and returned to her carriage with Jun Wu Yao without waiting for a reply.

Gu Ying and Gu XIn Yan were the only two people left by the campfire.

The smile on Gu Ying’s face had completely disappeared and his eyes narrowed slightly, looking at the campfire in front of him.

His situation....

If he could understand, why would he be here?

Back in the carriage, Jun Wu Yao reached out and held Jun Wu Xie in his arms, using the warmth of his body to disperse the night’s coldness.

“You’re testing Gu Ying?” Jun Qu Yao whispered.

“Tonight, except Su Ruiying, who is not testing boundaries?” Jun Wu Xie said lightly.

Jun Wu Yao chuckled and kissed Jun Wu Xie on the head, “Go to sleep.”

“Ok.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Under the cover of dark, everyone in the carriages had things troubling them.

Early next morning, the four carriages set off. Chi Yan seemed to be in a great hurry and did not want to waste even a second. Fortunately everyone was still strong and was not affected by the long journey.

Except Gu Xin Yan, who was the weakest and the turbulence made her face pale.

Chi Yan naturally did not care if she lived or died but what was surprising was that Gu Ying made no attempt to ask Chi Yan to slow down but instead just gave her some medicine to settle her discomfort.
