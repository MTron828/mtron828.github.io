Chapter 3028 Chaotic Memory 1

Jun Wu Xie stood in the darkness as if she had fallen into the abyss of the souls. Everywhere, there were countless souls.

“This is His Lord’s plan.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes swept over the babies. The souls were sleeping quietly without any movement. They were cut off from their vitality and slept shortly after their birth in this small crystal ball, waiting for the day of final demise.

When imagination turns into reality, the degree of cruelty doubles.

“I suddenly feel that the people in the Upper Realm are very pathetic.” Jun Wu Yao said.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes, “Yeah, how sad this is. Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. Why the need to sacrifice the blood of theThree Realms? Once the blood sacrifice begins, I am afraid that even the creatures connected to the Upper Realm will also be destroyed.” Those who follow in the footsteps of His Lord, have desperately created blood sacrifice arrays. Even Luo Qingcheng was tempted by such power, and completely lost her human nature at that time.

But how could they know that they could not obtain powerful power at all? Their existence was to dedicate their souls to the blood sacrifice. In the end, there was only one person who could truly break the void and gain the supreme power. These people were just pitiful and sad funerary items.

Perhaps, until the day they die, they would then realize that they were just a group of chess pieces.

Ironically, they paid everything for it.

“How can the person who created all this care about the life and death of others? What he wants has always been the most powerful force. The desire makes him addicted, he can’t see everything around him, he can only see that supreme position. “Jun Wu Yao was not amused, he never felt that a supreme position was a glorious thing. He had always felt that the world was so uninteresting. War, surviving and fighting were all about killing and just a means to pass the time.

It was only until he met Jun Wu Xie. It was then he had his own perseverance. The idea of ​​fighting to protect a person.

The concept of being strong, His Lord and Jun Wu Yao stood on each opposite end.

After they had walked for a long period, not knowing how many souls they had seen, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao finally walked to an end.

It was a huge underground palace. The whole palace was a giant circle. Around the circle, there were four pillars of blue flames, and these blue flames illuminated the whole palace. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At the center of the circle, there was an altar made up of an unknown material. On the platform, blood stains could be seen.

Jun Wu Xie subconsciously wanted to walk forward, but Jun Wu Yao suddenly pulled her wrist.

Jun Wu Xie turned her head with doubt when she discovered that Jun Wu Yao’s complexion had turned pale and he looked like he was suffering in pain. His brow quietly frowned and a hand pressed against his temple.

“What’s wrong?” Jun Wu Xie was startled.

Jun Wu Yao gritted his teeth without speaking, he didn’t know how to explain to Jun Wu Xie, the pictures that suddenly appeared in his mind.

Fragmented, but painful pictures.

Those chaotic pictures seemed to overlap with everything in front of him. He vaguely saw the face of His Lord. In this underground palace enveloped in the blue flames, he was bound by his hands and feet and placed on the altar.

He saw His Lord laughing, and saw Su Ruiying standing aside with his head down, the scene was truly terrible.
