Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Xu Zu stood still at his own place in stunned, as if someone had poured a pail of cold water onto him, it felt so cold that every single pore on his body shrank.

After giving out the commitment, Jun Wu Xie left without even looking back, leaving those dumbfounded people from the Long Xuan City who hadn’t been able to restore their calmness since then alone in the main hall.

Everyone did not expect that there was actually this one day where the inferior Sea Spirit City would release such a brave and militant utterance.

“Everyone, please?” While forcing himself to hold back the laughter, in a pretentiously elegant manner, Fan Zhuo gestured them to leave.

Face greened, Xu Zu pursed his lips so hard that blood drained from his lips. He gave Fan Zhuo a deadly stare before he left the place together with his people from the Long Xuan City. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, the astonishment was still inside them, not being able to subside.

Jun Wu Xie’s decision would bring a change to the situation of the entire Sea Spirit City. To Xu Zu’s party, it was no doubt that Jun Wu Xie’s decision was nothing different from drawing ruins upon herself, but what they had failed to realize was that it was actually a nightmare that was awaiting the Upper Realm in the future.

After Xu Zu them left the city palace, Jun Wu Xie turned into the back hall. Before she could even speak anything, Qiao Chu and the others who had been eavesdropping in the back hall all the time immediately moved towards her, packly crowding around her in just an instant.

“Little Xie, what are you trying to do?” Qiao Chu stared at Jun Wu Xie. They had been waiting for Jun Wu Xie to come back to solve the problem of the resources of the Sea Spirit Beasts, but even if they were beaten to death, they still couldn’t have thought that Jun Wu Xie would actually go to such an extent.

Everything that had happened today seemed to just be Jun Wu Xie informing the emissaries of the Long Xuan City about the matter of terminating the provision of the Sea Spirit Beast, but in fact, it was Jun Wu Xie announcing to the entire Upper Realm, that the Sea Spirit City was going to completely cut off the supply of all the Sea Spirit Beast resources!

The people in the Upper Realm had long accustomed to using everything in the Sea Spirit Beast, and the decision that was made by Jun Wu Xie had totally broken the rules of the Upper Realm which had been complied for thousands of years!

Not only it wouldn’t solve the awkward situation which the Sea Spirit City was now in, it would instantly push the entire Sea Spirit City to the cusp of the public opinion. It wouldn’t even need a moment of thought for them to know that the moment Xu Zu got back to the Long Xuan City, the decision Jun Wu Xie made would just act like a wildfire, burning the prairie, spreading rapidly to every single place in the Upper Realm. The tremor that came after that would then set up an upsurge of chaos in the whole Upper Realm!

By that time, it would be impossible for the Sea Spirit City to remain lowkey even if they wanted to.

Qiao Chu and the others couldn’t understand it at all, why would Jun Wu Xie changed her strategy all of a sudden? Before going to the Soul World, wasn’t she planning to keep a low profile and move step by step by using the Sea Spirit City as the camouflage?

Then how came... the way she acted would suddenly become so extreme?

Not only did Qiao Chu not understand it, even Hua Yao and Rong Ruo who were usually wise thinking were also confused by the decision Jun Wu Xie made.

Looking at her fellow friends who were all showing an anxious expression on their faces, Jun Wu Xie said slowly, “I’m doing what I’m supposed to do.”

“Huh? What does that mean? Are you planning to destroy the Sea Spirit City? Is it that you want to change the location of our base?” Qiao Chu scratched his head, puzzled, not being able to keep up with Jun Wu Xie’s mind.

Jun Wu Xie then explained, “Any lies will eventually be revealed one day. Since we’ve chosen the Sea Spirit City, sooner or later, the Upper Realm will notice that something had gone wrong if we stop providing the Sea Spirit Beasts to them for a long period of time. It’s as well better to straight away tell them that we’re going to cut off the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast, and there’s nothing they could do about it.”

“I know, but... isn’t this too risky? Once the news are spread out, the City Lords of the other seventy-one cities might break into outrage.” Qiao Chu felt a little helpless. If they didn’t choose to take over the Sea Spirit City but the other cities during that time, there wouldn’t be so many problems now.
