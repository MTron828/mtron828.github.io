Chapter 2953: Anger (7)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie’s back as he felt his heart ache.

She didn’t say anything, didn’t cry nor did she show any anger. She was as calm as still water.

However, Jun Wu Yao knew that the calmer her response was, the more turbulent her heart was.

“Wu Yao, I have started to regret it.” Jun Wu Xie said suddenly.

Jun Wu Yao was stunned momentarily.

“At the time, when I was in Cloudy Peaks, if I did not cooperate with Qiao Chu and the others, then they would not be involved in this struggle. Then Little Ruo would not ...” Jun Wu Xie said abruptly. She couldn’t continue her words, she didn’t want to believe that the gentle Little Ruo had left forever.

For the first time, Jun Wu Xie questioned her encounter with Qiao Chu. If they didn’t meet her, they might find a place to live in mountains and rivers after they had their revenge for their family and they no longer needed to encounter any more perilous situations.

Jun Wu Yao looked at the back of the distressed Jun Wu Xie and at this moment, Jun Wu Xie herself did not realize that she had fallen self blame.

“It’s not because of you. If you never met, how would you discover the secret of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms? If you didn’t journey together, the Three Realms would one day be destroyed.” His shoulders were a little stiff and his body was exuding a touch of coolness.

Finding the path of hope, there were thorns, blood, sacrifice, but no retreat. Just as Jun Wu Xie had always believed in, behind her were the people she treasured. She could not retreat.

“Matters in the Three Realms cannot be undertaken by you alone. You must not take unnecessary pains and lead yourself into a dead end.” Jun Wu Yao was a little worried. Last time, when Yan Bu Gui and her Grandmaster perished, he was not with her. He did not dare think how she faced the departure of the people who were important to her?

She really treasured...

Jun Wu Xie didn’t say anything. She just relaxed her taut body and leaned softly against Jun Wu Yao’s arms. She clutched Jun Wu Yao’s outer robe with one hand, and buried her head in his chest.

“...It hurts so much ...” She gave a suppressed cry filled with pain.

Jun Wu Yao frowned and felt even more distressed.

“Wu Yao, my heart ... it hurts.”

Jun Wu Xie’s repressed voice finally choked at this moment. She didn’t dare to think about it. Days in the future, every corner of the world, she would never find that familiar figure. The gentle, attentive woman who was as warm as the sun in March ... She had suddenly disappeared just like that ...

“Why ... why did things turn out like this...” Jun Wu Xie clutched Jun Wu Yao’s collar tightly, venting a little bit of sadness that she couldn’t reveal in front of her companions. She didn’t dare to show a trace of sadness in front of them, knowing that if she revealed her sadness, it would only make their hearts more pained.

She was human, not a machine. She knew what pain was. She was reluctant, unwilling, angry and hated it.

Jun Wu Yao silently embraced Jun Wu Xie in his arms. He could clearly feel that the placket on his chest was slightly wet, a little moist and warm ...

“I will take revenge, I swear ...” Under the moonlight, Jun Wu Xie made her oath. Today, she must pay back a hundred times everything they suffered!

People in the Sacred City did not know yet. The blood spilled today had unveiled the prelude to the upcoming torrential storm ...

Chapter 2954: Schemes and Intrigues (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

After a few days of the selection, the audience’s interest was beginning to wane. It was on the fourth day that the Spirit Ring bearers started competing and the selection started to get interesting.

The City Lords of the 72 Cities also started to appear and although they were not intending to be ranked, they hoped for an opportunity to show their prowess.

Dongfang Ku Bi was also in the crowd but his strength was not high. He came to the Sacred City purely to pass some time and soak in the atmosphere.

“Did City Lord Yan not come today?” Dongfang Ku Bi looked around the arena but did not see Jun Wu Xie present. This made him curious and he asked his guards.

In fact, Dongfang Ku Bi had seen Jun Wu Xie two days ago but before he could even go up to her, he saw Bai Zhu following closely behind her. When he saw that look of impatience on her face, he decided not to add to her troubles by going to speak with her.

But he never thought...

“No” The guard shook his head.

Dongfang Ku Bi had a pensive look on his face. In regular circumstances, Jun Wu Xie not turning up would have not been an issue but he had heard that the night before, the inn that Jun Wu Xie had been staying at was attacked and two of the attackers were members of the Top Ten exponents. The inn had been razed to the ground.

There was a lot of chatter regarding this in the Sacred City with everyone offering a different theory. Some suspected it had something to do with the newly appointed Overlord of the 72 Cities while others speculated it was nothing more than a disagreement between martial arts experts.

As to what actually happened, nobody had a clear picture.

“Is there any progress on what you were checking on?” Dongfang Ku Bi looked serious. He did not know why but he suspected the day before’s incident had something to do with Jun Wu Xie. After the fire, Jun Wu Xie seemed to have vanished. Dongfang Ku Bi wanted to ask if he could help with anything but did not have the chance.

“Your subordinate is useless, I really could not find anything.” The guard said with his head lowered. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Dongfang Ku Bi sighed deeply and furrowed both his eyebrows. He took another look at the arena, “Even Bai Zhu isn’t here today, could something really have happened? He has always been clinging onto the Overlord.”

Dongfang Ku Bi was very troubled and did not have any interest in watching the selection.

And today, Long Yao still sat stonily in the judge’s chair with a shadowy figure lurking behind him.

“Lord Long Yao, I have done what you asked. Although those people are not dead, they are very seriously injured. If you do this, you will surely anger Yan Hai.” The figure behind Long Yao was none other than the recently disappeared Bai Zhu. He had a respectful smile on his face and had several people standing behind him.

“Oh? How powerful are the people with Yan Hai that even the Top Ten exponents could not kill them? This is your report to me? It’s such a disappointment.” Long Yao said, disappointment dripping from his voice.

Five out of the Top Ten exponents were used in this operation, Long Yao’s intention was not to merely injure them!
