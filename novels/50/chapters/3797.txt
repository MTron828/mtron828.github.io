Su Ya didn’t give Qiao Chu and the others any chance to respond and straightaway said. “Since all of you are so free, have a drink with this woman here then!”

“Huh?” Qiao Chu and the rest were stunned for a moment.

“What? You all are not willing to do so?” Su Ya raised her eyebrows, causing Qiao Chu them to tremble like a quail, not having the guts to say the word “no”.

Whereas for Jun Wu Xie, she was quite surprised to see Su Ya’s attitude. Ever since she came back, Su Ya almost didn’t get in touch with her. She thought that Su Ya wasn’t able to forget the things that had happened five years ago. Even both of them met each other, it will only make her recall the death of Yan Bu Gui.

“And you, come with us!” Noticing Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were on her, Su Ya crooked her finger handsomely to beckon Jun Wu Xie.

Not knowing if she should cry or laugh, Jun Wu Xie suddenly felt that she was back again in the past five years. It felt like she had returned to Cloudy Brook Academy and to the small little Spirit Mastery Faculty.

Su Ya was already such a casual and domineering person during that time.

“Yes, Master.” Jun Wu Xie got up and responded politely.

The personality of Su Ya was crisp and straightforward. If she said she wanted to drink, then of course she would be going to have a good drink. They didn’t leave Lin Palace but just borrowed Duke Lin’s back hall. They then ordered the servants to take out the precious wines which Jun Qing had been cherishing for years. This really made Jun Qing to feel sad for quite a while.

Qiao Chu and the others were literally dumbfounded by the sight of hundreds of fine wines filling up the entire hall.

Su Ya was going to let them drink to death!

“Come on, you all here are a group of men, don’t be dilly-dally like a woman. Just drink!” Su Ya carried a jar of wine and poured it into her mouth right after she opened the seal.

Qiao Chu and the rest looked at each other with a bitter look on their faces. They had no other choice but to follow the instructions given.

At the moment, Qiao Chu received an uncountable amount of killing eyes from Fei Yan and his other friends. If it wasn’t for him being a busybody and insisting on asking Jun Wu Xie about her hidden plans, they wouldn’t be caught by Su Ya!

Qiao Chu knew that it was all his fault. All He could do was just to pick up the jar of wine sadly and drink with his Grandmaster.

Jun Wu Xie was the steadiest among them. Earlier when she was in Cloudy Brook Academy, she was ordered to soak in the pool of wine by Su Ya. Even someone like her who couldn’t hold her liquor very well had already acquired the skill of drinking thousands cup of wine without getting drunk.

“The others, drink!” Su Ya finished the jar of wine in only one breath. Her face turned red due to the effect of the alcohol. She threw away the jar on her hand and said while pointing at Ye Sha and his group of people who came together with Jun Wu Xie.

Ye Sha and the rest broke out in a cold sweat. However, they saw Jun Wu Xie secretly nodded her head at them, causing them to only accept their fate. Each of them picked up a jar of wine and began to drink.

Jun Qing who was passing by the back hall was still feeling down about the fact that the fine wines which he had been keeping for years were being wasted by Su Ya. But the moment he saw the behaviour of Su Ya forcing every person she saw to drink with her, he was so scared that he left the place immediately even before he was able to feel sad.

The jars of wine were unsealed one by one. Some of them who were at first feeling awkward seemed to be getting high due to the alcohol effect. There was no need for Su Ya to say anything. They would just pick up any wine themselves and continue to drink. A moment later, the jars of wine were half emptied. When the night came, there were already full of drunken bodies lying on the ground in the back hall of Lin Palace and only a few jars of wine were left.

Among those people, Jun Wu Xie and Su Ya were the only two people who were still staying sober. Both the master and the student were already gorgeous enough, but now that they were filling with a haze of intoxication, both their faces blushed, causing them to look more beautiful to the point that whoever saw them weren’t be able to move their eyes away.

Su Ya threw away an empty jar and let out a hiccup. While looking at the red face of Jun Wu Xie who was pretending to be calm, she said. “Give me your cosmos sack.”

Jun Wu Xie had drunk quite an amount of wine. Though her fingers were shaking slightly, she took out her cosmos sack and passed it over to Su YaVịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
