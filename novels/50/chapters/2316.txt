Chapter 2317: Washing the Nine Temples with Blood (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“All...all dead?” Da Han’s expression immediately crumbled as he stood there completely dumbfounded. The Heavenly Wolf Temple was the head of the Nine Temples and it was the strongest. They had a lot of people assigned to the Heavenly Wolf Temple, and many of them were experts who were able to condense out a Spirit Ring. Although they still could not condense out a complete Spirit Ring, but they were a whole lot stronger than an ordinary Gold Spirit.

But...

Actually all... died? !

“How could this be?” Da Han was flabbergasted as he stood there stunned in place, all his words before were akin to slapping his own face.

He was still laughing at Jun Wu Xie being a mouse that was bluffing, and he was going on and on about their own impenetrable defenses. Whoever thought that just as his words had been uttered out, his face ushered in a solid slap, and this resounding slap was an extremely loud one.

The Night Regime came and their target of the first attack was the most powerful Heavenly Wolf Temple in the Nine Temples. The meaning of Jun Wu Xie was very obvious. Even the strongest Heavenly Wolf Temple had been trampled under her feet. In the Middle Realm, there was no one who could block her determination to wash the Nine Temples with blood!

For a moment, the entire hall was silent, and the atmosphere was so depressed that people felt that even breathing became difficult.

You must know that in the entire Heavenly Wolf Temple, there were nearly ten thousand Gold Spirits despatched from the Upper Realm!

But...

All of them were annihilated? !

What was even more frightening was that every hour, there would be news. An hour ago, they had not received any news of the attack, but after an hour, they had received the horrendous news of the annihilation of their entire force!

An hour, ten thousand of Gold Spirits had died just like that!

What sort of terrifying battle prowess!

Even the usually overconfident Da Han was stumped by this fighting force. His face alternated into a shade of white for a while before turning green.

Before they digested the tragic news of the Heavenly Wolf Temple, another battle report came in. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Reporting to Master Nangong, there’s trouble! The Obscure Soul Temple had been destroyed!”

“What!”

“Reporting to Master Nangong, the Celestial Temple had been destroyed!”

“The Obscure Soul Temple had been destroyed.....”

“...”

One after another, ominous battle report came in succession, each report without exception was news of total annihilation!

Receiving eight battle reports continuously had left everybody in the hall in a daze and all those from the Upper Realm almost couldn’t hold back vomiting out a mouthful of blood!

In less than ten minutes, Eight Temples out of the Nine Temples had been destroyed, and the only remaining one was the Spirit Void Temple!

This was simply unbelievable. Each temple was far apart from each other. It was impossible to travel to so many temples in such a short period of time. The only explanation was that the Night Regime had split up and assaulted the Nine Temples concurrently. And they had ended around the same time as well. Eight battles had all ended within ten minutes, and all the people from the Upper Realm have died in the Eight Temples, not even one was alive!

At this moment, even Da Han who was standing in the hall in a daze no longer had the previous arrogance. His face turned completely ashened as his eyes were open wide in horror. If these news weren’t received in reports, as a person from the Upper Realm, he really would have thought that it was a play staged by Jun Wu Xie and the Nine Temples.

In all the Nine Temples, the number of Gold Spirits stationed in the various temples each numbered at least ten thousand. If the Night Regime had divided their assault, this also meant that they themselves had divided their own strength.

If it was said that the Night Regime had consolidated all their power and broke through one of the Temples, perhaps everyone would not be so surprised. But they had divided into several forces and even attained victory!
