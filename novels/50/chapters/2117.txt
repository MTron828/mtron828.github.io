Chapter 2118: The Ruler of Face Slaps Returns (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Face of Sylvan? Are you certain?” Hearing the three words, Face of Sylvan, the imposter’s eyes suddenly lit up.

“I could not have been mistaken. For something that could morph and change into so many forms, besides the Face of Sylvan, no other magical artifact is like that.” Wu Jiu said with clear certainty.

The imposter then creased up his brows.

“Hasn’t the Face of Sylvan already been taken away by that person? There was a rumour in the Middle Realm before that after that person was captured, his subordinates had mistakenly thought that he had fallen in battle and buried all his treasures into his tomb. Why would..... it suddenly show up on a human spirit?”

“That’s right, I had thought that it was rather strange as well, but now that Jun Wu Xie has already been caught by us, this matter about the Face of Sylvan will be cleared up sooner or later.” Wu Jiu went on to say. “That person had taken away quite a number of the Upper Realm’s magical artifacts and the Supreme Lord was greatly infuriated by that. Unfortunately the whereabouts of all those magical artifacts are still not known and if we are able to establish a breaking lead through the Face of Sylvan, we might just be able to bring back an extra gift to the Supreme Lord.”

“If that is true, that would naturally be for the best.” The imposter then replied.

Just as the two of them were secretly scheming up their plot, a cold clear voice suddenly came floating into the grand hall!

“What will be for the best? Why not tell me about it as well?”

In almost the same instant, Wu Jiu snapped his head up and looked towards the source of the voice, to see a figure that had appeared at the doors into the grand hall suddenly!

It was a petite little figure, but as it fell into Wu Jiu’s eyes, it kicked up a Heaven stirring wave inside him!

“Jun Wu Xie? How did you come to be here! ?” Wu Jiu stared with incredulous disbelief at Jun Wu Xie who had appeared at the doors of the grand hall, unable to believe what he was seeing. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A mere half an hour ago, he had just spoken to Jun Wu Xie down in the dungeons and he clearly remembered that Jun Wu Xie’s limbs had been securely shackled up with Soul Binding Chains. With her power of the spirit sealed, how could she possibly have escaped out from the dungeons? And how did she come to appear here?

Jun Wu Xie walked into the grand hall calm and composed, her gaze sweeping over Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord.

“If my memory serves me correctly, didn’t you “invite” me to come?”

The fake Spirit Lord narrowed his eyes and stared calmly at Jun Wu Xie, as a glint of malice flashed within his eyes.

“I have underestimated you. I had not thought that you would be capable of shaking off the binding restraints of the Soul Binding Chains and escaping from the dungeons. But just as well, as I have a few things I want to ask you about.” The fake Spirit Lord said as he looked at Jun Wu Xie nonchalantly. From his point of view, Jun Wu Xie was just so insignificantly small, and also so foolish. It did not matter how she had managed to escape out from the dungeon, but even when she knew that the difference between their powers were so far apart, she had not gone into hiding nor try to run away, instead sending herself to her own doom, which was just so laughable.

Even though she had escaped, the fake Spirit Lord was certain that he would be able to throw her back into captivity once again

“Oh? What could it be about?” There wasn’t the slightest bit of nervousness on Jun Wu Xie’s face.

“You have the Face of Selvan on you?” The fake Spirit Lord asked.

Jun Wu Xie was silent for a moment before she suddenly nodded her head.

“That’s right. I hold the Face of Selvan.”

“Where did you get the Face of Selvan from? If you come clean without any subterfuge, I might make things a little easier for you, or I might just choose to allow you to leave. However you are going to choose, depends entirely on you.” The fake Spirit Lord was employing the stick and carrot, seeking to coax out information about the Face of Selvan from Jun Wu Xie’s mouth.

Jun Wu Xie was no fool, and she could naturally see the interest the fake Spirit Lord was showing towards the Face of Selvan.

But.....
