“No need.” Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“No need?” Zheng Weilong was dumbfounded.

Jun Wu Xie had neither prepared for war nor did she intend to fight, which was completely different from Zheng Weilong’s earlier guess.

Unless Jun Wu Xie had wanted to surrender before the fight?

Zheng Weilong’s heart suddenly dropped to the pit of her stomach. She really couldn’t figure out what Jun Wu Xie wanted to do.

“How about Qiao Chu and the others?” Jun Wu Xie asked suddenly.

“Already on the wall.” Zheng Weilong said.

Jun Wu Xie nodded and said nothing more as she walked towards the outside of the city.

Qiao Chu and the others had already ascended the walls surrounding Sea Spirit City earlier in the morning, and they now stood together with a group of Night Regime warriors.

Both sides had yet to start fighting, but the cursing and trash talking...

“The cowards of Sea Spirit City, when are you hiding till? Are you turtles going to hide in your shells??” The Alliance army yelled and scolded outside.

And upon the walls ...

“Piss off! If you have the ability, you can come on in!” Qiao Chu stepped on the stone wall as he yelled at the army situated not far away.

For a while, the battle of tongues raged on on both sides. With just Qiao Chu, one person, he was eloquent refuting all their curses with witty expressions. It was a stalemate.

Hua Yao and others stood on the side as they silently watched Qiao Chu engage in his ‘Big Kill’ mode. so silently, watching Qiao Chu start the “Big Kill” mod. At this moment, they realized that Qiao Chu was not only powerful, but he was second to none! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The people in the opposite camp had been scolded by him till they were so frustrated that they almost puke blood!

Qiao Chu was in delight as he kept scolding the opposing forces, but Jun Wu Xie suddenly appeared behind him and patted him on the shoulder.

“Don’t worry, I haven’t scolded ...” Qiao Chu thought that Hua Yao and the others couldn’t listen to anymore, but he turned around to find Jun Wu Xie standing behind him, and suddenly became serious.

“Little ... Little Xie... you are here?”

“What are you doing?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Qiao Chu.

Qiao Chu scratched his head and said, “Well ... you weren’t letting us fight? And those guys cursed at us so badly, so I just wanted to teach them how to be polite, so I said ... some words ...” Qiao Chu looked at Jun Wu Xie seriously.

Upon hearing his explanation, Fei Yan and the others had already rolled their eyes many times over.

He only said a few words??

He literally cursed out the 18 generations of the opposing forces!

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Qiao Chu, and with her one glance, it made Qiao Chu feel guilty and he had to change the subject.

“Well ... what are we going to do now? The morale on the other side is on an up. I’m pretty sure the battle will start soon. So are we still going to stand guard?”

“No.” Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

Qiao Chu’s eyes brightened.

They were going to start fighting!

“I’m going to fight.” Jun Wu Xie said.

“What do you mean?” Qiao Chu didn’t understand.

Hua Yao and others had a vague feeling that something was off.

But Jun Wu Xie didn’t bother explaining further to them. She raised herself to her toes and sprung up. Her figure turned into a stream of flowing light, and she flew down from the wall!

Several generals who had cursed at Qiao Chu before, suddenly became aware of the stream of light which flew down from the wall of Sea Spirit City, they were shocked as they waited to take a closer look.

And what they saw was...

A slender figure, standing alone in front of the closed gates of Sea Spirit City and faced an army two million strong from the 72 cities!!
