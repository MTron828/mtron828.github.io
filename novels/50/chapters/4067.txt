Fei Yan succeeded in duping Xu Zu. He immediately rushed back to the City’s official residence, and informed his friends who were waiting for his news. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The information has been put out. What do we want to do now?” Fei Yan looked up at Jun Wu Xie who was sitting on the main seat of the hall. Xu Zu was considered cautious, as he “bought” off a lot of “residents” of the Sea Spirit City, and he managed to find out quite a bit of information. However, even though he was careful and cautious, he could not stop the fact that the whole city had replaced its core. Those who were “bought” by Xu Zu; whether civilian or soldier, none of them were not from the Night Regime. And Fei Yan had played along as well.

“Wait.” Jun Wu Xie said unhurriedly.

“Wait?” Fei Yan was a little puzzled.

“Long Xuan City will not easily believe that the information is real. They will continue to probe. In a month, after you have given them the thing, they will test it out and be sure.” Jun Wu Xie picked up her cup of tea as she slowly savoured it. Although the Upper Realm was not a pleasant place, but then things here were quite good; for example the tea at Yan Wan’s residence was so much better than the best tea in the Lower Realm.

It was no wonder that Jun Wu Yao in the past had despised the Jade Nectar.

“But... what do I give to them?” Fei Yan was confused, everything that he said to them was purposefully instructed by Jun Wu Xie. As for what kind of medicinal pills... where to find them.

Jun Wu Xie flung a little pill bottle that was in her hand as Fei Yan quickly rushed to catch it.

“When it’s time, give them this.”

Fei Yan was full of curiosity as he opened the bottle, a strange smell was emitted from the bottle and Qiao Chu, who was sitting beside him, could not help but stretched over to snoop.

The scent was unfamiliar and hard to place, there was some bitterness from the herbs used, but contained some fragrance as well. After careful smelling, the smell was also mixed with a touch of blood.

“This medicine...” Hua Yao noticed the faint bloody smell, and couldn’t help but look at Jun Wu Xie. As far as he knows, Jun Wu Xie detested the bloody smell the most, and even till today, her dislike had not changed. She categorically did not using any blood to prepare remedies.

“Dragon Blood Grass.” said Jun Wu Xie.

The Dragon Blood Grass was a rare medicinal material. The grass was reddish and when crushed, its sap would give off a faint bloody smell, and it was often used as a medicine primer. Except that the Dragon’s Blood Grass was very rare, when Jun Wu Xie attacked Qing Yun Clan, she only managed to find just a few Dragon’s Blood Grass.

The news which Jun Wu Xie released, was that the medicinal pills were refined with the use of Sea Spirit Beasts. It was not uncommon to refine the medicinal herbs with flesh and blood. However, those medicinal pills had a certain characteristic, that no matter what kind of refining method was used, and however many herbs were combined, the bloody smell could not be covered.

Jun Wu Xie had replaced the Sea Spirit Beast’s blood with Dragon Blood Grass, hence it was impossible to tell the exact component in this medicinal pills.

Obviously, Jun Wu Xie had prepared this medicine earlier on, as the plan had formed in her heart.

“Done! Then I will give this medicine to them when the time comes. Little Xie, tell me honestly, this medicine... Is there any special effects?” Fei Yan looked at Jun Wu Xie meaningfully.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at the curious expression of her little friend. She just lowered her eyes slowly and did not explain anything.

Whether this medicine could make Long Xuan City believe in the rumors that she released, only time can prove so.
