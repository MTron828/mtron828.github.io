Chapter 2763: What a loser（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Nangong Yan looked at Nangong Lie unbelievably. He was unwilling to believe that Nangong Lie was still alive.

The rest of the Five City Coalition were all dead. There was no reason that he would spare Nangong Lie!

But no matter how unbelievable he felt, Nangong Lie strutted across and walked past him. The moment Nangong Lie’s gaze swept by Nangong Yan’s body, Nangong Yan felt a great murderous intent.

That dense murderous intent stunned Nangong Yan!

Nangong Lie had never looked at him with such an expression and it was obvious that he had become the target of Nangong Lie’s hostility.

Nangong Yan’s blood was frozen at this moment. He panicked and scolded Jun Wu Xie like a thousand times in his heart. There was no news of Nangong Lie at all. What kind of means did Jun Wu Xie use to kill the Five City Coalition? However, those who had seen it could not help but have goosebumps. No one would think that Jun Wu Xie would leave Nangong Lie alive.

Now that they thought about it, they had not seen the dead body of Nangong Lie, everything was just a guess.

At this moment, Nangong Yan wished that Nangong Lie had died!

Those said words, Nangong Lie might have heard them all!

Nangong Lie glared coldly at Nangong Yan whose face had turned pale. He walked to Jun Wu Xie’s side, nodded slightly to Jun Wu Xie and sat down next to her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

There was a strange silence in the entire banquet. Everyone’s eyes could not help looking at Nangong Lie and Nangong Yan’s body language. Nangong Lie’s attitude towards Nangong Yan made them look forward to a good show.

The smile in Bai Zhu’s eyes grew stronger.

Even if Nangong Yan was the smartest, he was still defeated by Jun Wu Xie. He seriously suspected that Jun Wu Xie intentionally let Nangong Lie appear at this moment so as to push all the responsibilities and spoke ill of Nangong Yan. With these happenings, the timing was just perfect!

“Lord Nangong.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

The cold voice agitated Nangong Yan to fight him right away.

“Sit down.” Jun Wu Xie said indifferently.

Nangong Yan’s whole muscles were tightened to the extreme. He sat for a while before sitting back stiffly. His face was ugly like never before.

What he said before, Jun Wu Xie, the City Lords of the 72 cities as well as Nangong Lie had heard it all. There was no need for anyone to say a word. When Nangong Lie came to him, he realized that he was being framed!

At this moment, Nangong Yan could only lower his head. He tried not to let himself and Nangong Lie had any eye contact.

Of course, Bai Zhu was unwilling to let him have his way.

“I haven’t seen Master Nangong for a long time. Now let me borrow a gift to pay respect to Master Nangong.” Bai Zhu stood up with a smile, and generously toasted Nangong with a glass of wine.

Nangong Lie had a somber face, and raised his perfunctory toast.

Bai Zhu did not intend to stop there. He glanced at Nangong Yan, whose face turned from white to black, and smiled, “Master Nangong has been a guest in Sea Spirit City for quite a while?”

“Yes,” said Nangong Lie.

“It turned out that the rumors from the outside had surfaced. I heard it before. It seems that Master Nangong was dissatisfied with Sea Spirit City before bringing the Five City Coalition to Sea Spirit City. Now it seems that I have made a mistake by believing what others have said.” Bai Zhu said in an apologetic tone. But every word was poking into Nangong Yan’s heart. Weren’t these spoken by Nangong Yan who said it just not too long ago?
