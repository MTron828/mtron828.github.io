But even though that was the case, none of them among Qiao Chu and the others dared to go into the Serene Spirit Tower even once.

There was something that was harmful to spirits who were non human and none of them dared to risk their Ring Spirits by going there.

“Whoa! These old arms and legs of mine are about to break off.....” Qiao Chu had cultivated for one whole day and he had fallen back onto the grass completely exhausted. Although cultivating one’s power of the spirit was not tiring, but it was so utterly dull where they would sit there for an entire day, not moving even an inch. Though it could be said that just sitting there for such a long period was not tiring on the body, but it was still dry and exhausting on the mind.

Qiao Chu’s mournful wail shocked his other companions awake from their cultivation.

Jun Wu Xie opened her eyes and looked at Qiao Chu who was rolling around on the grass. She could not help but smile as she shook her head. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Don’t cry so piteously. It’s not all that tiring but you’re being too noisy. I’ll say Dumb Qiao, how old are you only? And you’re complaining about your old arms and legs. Could you be already falling frail before getting old?” Fei Yan asked as he glanced meaningfully all over Qiao Chu’s body with an eyebrow arched up.

Qiao Chu sat up with an indignant howl, his hands held protectively over his chest, looking like a aggrieved little lady who had been bullied.

“Who said I’m getting old before I turn frail. This little lord here is just brimming with vitality!”

“I really can’t see it.” Fei Yan continued to poke at Qiao Chu with a smile.

“It’s better than being a pervert who is always dressing himself up as a girl!” Qiao Chu retorted.

Fei Yan’s eyes narrowed and his fists crackled loudly.

“I am thinking that you have not gotten a thrashing for too long and your skin it itching.”

Qiao Chu was not bothered as he retorted in challenge: “Do you think I’m scared of you? Don’t blame me for not reminding you that you are now in spirit form and you don’t have your monstrous strength any longer. If it comes to a fight, nobody knows who will end up being the one thrashed!”

A corner of Fei Yan’s mouth was twitching from Qiao Chu’s taunts and he jumped to his feet to pounce on Qiao Chu. The two youths then immediately rolled into a ball of scuffling upon the grass.

Hua Yao, Fan Zhuo and Rong Ruo were not able to calm their hearts enough to continue to cultivate with the racket and they just sat there upon the grass to watch Qiao Chu and Fei Yan going at each other.

Suddenly, Jun Wu Xie sensed something strange.

“Stop fighting.”

Jun Wu Xie’s voice made Qiao Chu and Fei Yan stop immediately.

“What’s wrong?” Rong Ruo asked, looking at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie’s power of the spirit was stronger than any of them and hence she was able to sense any movements in the Tranquil Dream Forest better than anyone.

“Someone’s coming.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes, carefully listening for the tiny sound.

The Tranquil Dream Forest had long become a place that few people stepped into. In the two weeks that they cultivated in here, the companions had not seen any other spirit appear here besides themselves.

“The source of the sound is coming from the direction of Nalan Shan’s house and it’s approaching right towards us.” Jun Wu Xie said.

In that instant, the youths were all on their guard.

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and gestured for them to climb up into the trees. Without another word, Qiao Chu and the other companions scuttled right up the nearest large tree and quietly concealed themselves among the dense cover of the leaves.

In moments, a group of human spirits came to the grass patch that Jun Wu Xie and the others had been just before, and the leader of the group of spirits was someone familiar, Meng Yi Liang.

“Senior Meng, would you say that that Jun Wu Xie is really here in this forest?” A man looked at Meng Yi Liang to ask.

Meng Yi Liang looked around where he was standing. They had been in the Tranquil Dream Forest for a period but they had not discovered anything. “She should be here. Search carefully. If we can’t find Nalan Shan, then we need to dig Jun Wu Xie out. Otherwise, it will not be easy for us to answer when we go back.”

“Why will Eldest Senior want us to find a little lass?” Another man asked in puzzlement, as they had not even known that such a person existed before.
