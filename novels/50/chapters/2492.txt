Chapter 2493: The Isolated Island (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“I’ll go with you.” Ye Gu walked near him. His strength was preceded only by Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao. It would be better for them to be prepared if they faced any danger.

“Okay.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head and sat down while leaning against Rong Ruo. The small little Sea Spirit Beast that was lying in her arms widened its big eyes and looked at Rong Ruo’s pale face. Quietly, it stretched its wet little tongue out and licked on the back of Rong Ruo’s hand.

Looking at the little Sea Spirit Beast in surprise, Rong Ruo’s eyes met a pair of clear and beautiful big eyes, causing a trace of smile to emerge from Rong Ruo’s face.

“It seems to like you.” Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes. The Sea Spirit Beast had no body temperature. Its entire body was cold as this was the characteristic of most of the marine lives. Hugging the little Sea Spirit Beast in this hot and sultry weather was just like hugging a thermostatic cold little ice cube.

“It’s cute.” Rong Ruo smiled and patted on the head of the little Sea Spirit Beast.

Ye Gu and Fei Yan were still discussing about exploring the island whereas Qiao Chu kept making fuss about wanting to follow them.

The small rain was pitter-pattering in the thick forest, making lots of dripping sound. There were a pair of eyes hidden in the dark, quietly gazing at the group of people at the coastal, as if it was a cheetah hidden in the dark side, silently without everyone knowing.

“Its clan has gone now, how is it going to survive after that?” Rong Ruo looked at the small little Sea Spirit Beast that was licking her hand all the time, feeling slightly worried. She wasn’t sure if it was her psychological function doing things but it seemed like the comfort brought to her by this little thing had lessened the discomfort she felt in her body, leading her in regaining the colour on her face.

Jun Wu Xie too, didn’t know about the answer. She could only raised her head and looked at Jun Wu Yao.

“Sea Spirit Beast with such age basically doesn’t have the ability to protect itself. Even if it’s lucky enough to survive from the hunt of the Upper Realm, there are still many ferocious sea beasts living in the Sea of Death. Those sea beasts aren’t able to hurt the adult Sea Spirit Beast, but they are considered deadly to the newborn Sea Spirit Beast. Moreover, the little Sea Spirit Beast is an exceedingly delicious meal to those sea beasts.” Looking at the little thing in Jun Wu Xie’s arms, Jun Wu Yao explained.

The strong shall rule over the weak, such principle did not only exist in the Upper Realm, but also the world of the beasts.

“Can we bring it along with us?” Jun Wu Xie asked with a slight plea. She could never forget the scene when she carried this little thing out from the stomach of the adult Sea Spirit Beast.

The vibe of death was enshrouding around the colour of blood, and this small little life was the only thing to survive. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, Jun Wu Yao shook his head.

“Though the Sea Spirit Beasts are able to live on the land, staying away from the sea water for a long time will witten their lifespans. They belong to the ocean.” How wouldn’t Jun Wu Yao figure out the thought of Jun Wu Xie? Of course he wouldn’t reject her if he could, there were already so many dumb and cute little creatures like these turning around Jun Wu Xie anyway.

Unfortunately, it was a no for the Sea Spirit Beast.

Jun Wu Xie frowned. It was such a young Sea Spirit Beast but neither it was allowed to follow them nor survive by its own, did its mother risk its life to protect it just for it to face the upcoming death?

“But if we are able to find other Sea Spirit Beasts, we can try to entrust it to them. The Sea Spirit Beasts are tame animals. They often take good care of the little Sea Spirit Beasts with deep affection. No matter if it’s the kid from the same clan, or if it’s the kid they give birth to, they would put all their effort in raising the little Sea Spirit Beast.” Jun Wu Yao couldn’t bear to see Jun Wu Xie frown as he continued on.

“They are far more kinder than the Upper Realm.” While stroking on the head of the small little Sea Spirit Beast, a trace of coldness flashed across Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.
