Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie knew that what Jun Wu Yao said was the truth. In the past, Jun Wu Yao frequently disappeared and when he came back, there was always a strong smell of blood lingering on his body. At first, she didn’t really care much but gradually after time passed, she started to guess that every time he disappeared, he was dealing with his enemies that were hot in pursuit. The stench of blood came from those people.

Those people had long set their eyes on Jun Wu Yao.

In order for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms to succeed, to break through the boundaries and reach the powers of the true gods, they would never ever let go of Jun Wu Yao.

“Otherworldly Soul, does that mean that you’re not from this world? Who are you then?” Jun Wu Xie asked softly.

Jun Wu Yao looked at her and said, “I don’t know.”

“You don’t know?”

“When I arrived in this world, I didn’t have any memory at all. The only thing I knew was that I do not belong here. I first arrived at the Upper Realm and it was until then when they discovered that I was an Otherworldly Soul that I came down to the Middle Realm. That year when I was trapped in the cave, I was filled with hatred. But that was all before I had met you. After meeting you, I realised that this was the greatest gift that this world had given to me.” Jun Wu Yao tilted her small face up as he looked at her with a scorching gaze that was filled with indulgence.

“Being able to meet you, even if my soul scatters, I have no regrets.”

Jun Wu Yao had no good feelings towards this world, be it a person or any matter, everything was just like a game to him. If he felt like it, he could unify the Middle realm and suppress all the other forces. Once he was tired of it, he could simply get rid of the Upper Realm’s encirclement. Only her, who had suddenly appeared could have brought forth a ray of light into this gloomy world of his.

He had once thought about letting those people pay with the price of their own blood to satiate his hatred.

But now, all he wished for was to be able to stay by her side for a long time, passing each day ordinarily. Building a small hut in the mountainous forest, spending the rest of their lives together. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Once, he fought for hate. But now, he fought for love.

With just a difference of a word, he felt as if he had been given a new lease of life.

The past seemed to have dissipated like a cloud of smoke, the only thing that remained unchanged was only her.

“I don’t want you take any risks.” Jun Wu Xie said in a stifled voice.

The smile on his face deepened as he discovered a thread of worry that he had never seen before in her eyes. But the cause of this worry was because of him and he felt exhilarated. This was an emotion that was solely for him, and it made him feel like a hundred flowers had bloomed and the sun was shining brightly.

“Seeing you like this makes me very happy. It makes me so happy that.... I can’t help but want to kiss you,hmm?” He had purposefully made an exaggerated expression of being in a dilemma as he teased her.

The moment he finished his words, Jun Wu Xie suddenly looked up and leaned forward and pressed her warm lips to his.

Jun Wu Yao was stunned for a moment but he tightened his arms around her, the sweetness of her lips made everything that was on his mind disappear at once.

He slowly closed his eyes as he embraced the warmth and love that she had delivered as his arms tightened bit by bit, as if he would never let her leave his embrace.

There was one thing that he would never ever say.

The Otherworldly Soul of the three realms was no longer him alone and the other person was someone that he would give his life up to protect!

Even if he was in danger, he was willing to bear it all alone.

Just to protect her and let her world be filled with flowers, all in exchange for a lifetime of peace.

Under the silvery moonlight, the two of them were lost in a kiss, a moment that was so beautiful and sweet.
