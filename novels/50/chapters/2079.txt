Chapter 2080: Face Slapping of the Ecstatic Rapture Palm (7)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Soul Slayer was slightly taken aback, not knowing what Wu Jiu was going to say. The situation before its eyes had truly far exceeded anything it could have expected. It had never thought that Wu Jiu would really be so audacious to dare to put the Beast Spirit’s Spiritual Bear in captivity!

“Why?”

Wu Jiu suddenly laughed out loud. He stared at the Spiritual Bear viciously and he spat out through gritted teeth: “Because the construction of every Serene Spirit Tower requires a sufficiently powerful spirit body as its support, and the supporting spirit for the fourth Serene Spirit Tower is the Spiritual Bear!”

“What! ?” Soul Slayer was completely stunned.

“Haven’t you been so keen on getting your hands on the fourth Serene Spirit Tower? Weren’t you wishing that the Weapon Spirits would be able to become stronger through the Serene Spirit Tower? Then the opportunity is now right here before your eyes. Once we capture the Spiritual Bear, I guarantee that within just five days, all of the Weapon Spirits will be able to go into the Serene Spirit Tower to cultivate, which would give all of you more power than you have ever possessed. Soul Slayer, I am doing all this for the good of all of you Weapon Spirits. The fourth Serene Spirit Tower was not built for the human spirits but for all the Weapon Spirits!” Wu Jiu’s eyes said as his eyes flashed schemingly.

Soul Slayer was so overcome with shock it was unable to open its mouth for a long while, its mind a whirl of chaos. The thinking ability of Weapons Spirits was already not that strong in the first place and Wu Jiu’s words had further caused Soul Slayer to be unable to think calmly.

Capture the Spiritual Bear, construct the fourth Serene Spirit Tower.....

The two blood red rubies set deep within Soul Slayer seemed to be turning between Wu Jiu and the Spiritual Bear in turn.

“There is no need for you to worry. Constructing the fourth Serene Spirit Tower is the Spirit Lord’s idea and the Spirit Lord id aware is well aware of the requirements of building the Serene Spirit Tower. If I do not have the Spirit Lord’s permission, how could I possibly dare to make a move on the Spiritual Bear? Soul Slayer. The opportunity now rests right before you. I can help you capture the Spiritual Bear, and I can help you finish up the construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower. This opportunity that’s hard to come by in a thousand years is placed right before your eyes. Are you going to give up on the fourth Serene Spirit Tower or are you going to give it a gamble for the sake of gaining the Weapon Spirits powerful might? The final choice, is now yours to make.” Wu Jiu deviously pushed the entire matter right onto Soul Slayer. He knew very well that the human spirits they had brought here would not be able to battle the horde of Beast Spirits present, but there were many more Weapon Spirits who had come. If the Weapon Spirits joined them, he saw that he would then be able to drive back the Beast Spirits and to capture the Spiritual Bear!

Soul Slayer was hesitant. It was exactly their desire for the Serene Spirit Tower that had brought about the constant strife between the Weapon Spirits and Beast Spirits and countless Weapon Spirits had died in that period. They had finally won the Serene Spirit Tower after so much hardship, were they now going to give it all up for nothing?

Soul Slayer was feeling a little disgruntled. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Flame Dragon seemed to sense that Soul Slayer was wavering and it suddenly said: “Soul Slayer, do not fall for Wu Jiu’s ploy in driving a wedge between us! The Spirit Lord will never allow a Serene Spirit Tower that needs the Sacrificial Bear as a sacrifice!”

Soul Slayer did not make a noise.

Wu Jiu then said sneeringly: “Flame Dragon, you did not even have the courage to seek affirmation with the Spirit Lord. Do you think that your words can be trusted?”

Jun Wu Xie was watching Soul Slayer secretly and she then shot a meaningful glance at Qiao Chu and the others.

She had a feeling that Soul Slayer’s answer would definitely not be the one that they wanted to hear.

Having received Jun Wu Xie’s signal, Qiao Chu and the other companions immediately ordered the Yin Yang Bear, the Double Headed Bone Snake and the Great Ape to ring themselves around the Spiritual Bear in a protective circle.

After a long moment of silence, Soul Slayer then finally opened his mouth.

“All Weapon Spirits hear my order!”

Flame Dragon’s heart sank.

“Today we assist the human spirits to capture the Spiritual Bear, in order for the Weapon Spirits to rise. Prepare for battle!”

At the same moment that Soul Slayer’s voice fell, a gleeful smile instantly blossomed on Wu Jiu’s lips.

He had placed the right bet!
