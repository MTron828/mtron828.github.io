Jun Wu Xie reached out to take the woman’s pulse, and she found that the woman’s pulse was extremely chaotic. What she saw was a person nearing death, but when Jun Wu Xie looked closely, she saw that the woman’s complexion gradually turned from pale to rosy, and her complexion became very healthy. The haggardness from before seemed to have disappeared in an instant and her sunken cheeks became plump again.

Within a span of just a few minutes, the woman’s appearance and complexion had changed so much that it alerted Jun Wu Xie of its strangeness.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the sleeping woman and thought for a moment. Just then, Little Black appeared and jumped onto Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder.

“There is something strange with the Sacred Maiden Tribe. I think that this Luo person is similar to her daughter, there is nothing good about them.” Little Black twitched its nose slightly and sniffed the scent in the room. Having been together with Jun Wu Xie for a long time, although it had never studied medicine, it had a certain understanding of medicinal properties.

Regarding the changes the woman underwent, it was a bit shocking. She was obviously on the verge of death but now she looked radiant. Even for a proficient medical practitioner like Jun Wu Xie, it was impossible for her to create a medicine with such a rapid aftereffect. After all, for any nourishing medicine, the lesser side effects you wanted, the slower the medicine would take effect. To strengthen the constitutions of the internal and external were completely different.

With such a rapid external effect, it was clear that there would be severe side effects.

Otherwise, this woman’s pulse would not be so confused.

“Do you want to wake this woman up and find out more?” Little Black looked at Jun Wu Xie, it’s eyes sparkled.

Jun Wu Xie nodded, and took out a Consciousness Pill from her Cosmos Sack. The Consciousness Pill was one of the pills that Jun Wu Xie had to save life. The refining process was extremely tedious, and the time spent was very long. Hence she rarely used them, but this time Jun Wu Xie did not hesitate.

The survival of the Sacred Maiden Tribe did not concern her, but she had not forgotten that her mother was also a member of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. If, according to Elder Luo had said, the ability of the Sacred Maiden Tribe to maintain their youth till today could be connected to that youth potion. Jun Wu Xie had never heard Han Zi Fei mention that she had used any potion before. But in any case, she had to clarify.

Jun Wu Xie expertly opened the woman’s mouth and placed the Consciousness Pill into the woman’s mouth. She lifted the woman’s jaw with her palm, allowing the woman to swallow the pill naturally.

Then Jun Wu Xie stepped back and waited for a moment.

The drowsy woman gradually showed signs of sobriety, her closed eyes trembled slightly and opened slowly.

As she opened her eyes, Jun Wu Xie’s figure came into focus, astonishment filled her expression. And that immediately changed into something akin to survival instinct and excitement!

She kept opening and closing her mouth, wanting to say something to Jun Wu Xie, but she couldn’t even utter a single sound from her throat.

Jun Wu Xie found that the woman’s tongue was intact, raised her hand to feel the woman’s throat, using her spiritual power to explore the woman’s vocal cords, but she did not find any abnormalities. However, the woman was unable to speak, which Jun Wu Xie concluded that it was due to the effects of the drugs.

When it came to medicine, there was nothing that Jun Wu Xie couldn’t solve. She immediately took out a panacea from her Cosmos Sack.
