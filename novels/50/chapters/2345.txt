Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Standing behind Jun Wu Xie, there were six ring spirits. In addition to Little Lotus, Poison Ivy and Poppy that looked the same as they did five years ago, there were three more figures that they had never seen before.

The man standing at the end gave the feeling of untainted, pure white snow. Dressed in white, his flawless skin was almost translucent, he had long white hair, even his eyebrows and eyelashes were pure white. What was even more captivating was that pair of unforgettable silvery white eyes, it was as if he was a snow elf from a snow world that had been untainted.

Standing next to the white-haired man, was a tall man who looked very valiant. Under his robes was a strong and sturdy figure, although he was clearly giving off a strong sense of oppression, but his face had on a wide smile that made people unable to fear him the slightest.

The appearance of these two ring spirits seemed to be a bit strange. Rather, the one standing between them, a youth clad in red with red hair who resembled closest to a human. He looked to be about the age of fifteen or sixteen and had on a bright and pure smile all the time. This ring spirit looked like Drunk Lotus but a much younger version. His face was less haughty than Drunk Lotus and he wore a smile that made people feel close. Even that pair of dark red eyes did not make people feel that there was any discomfort, but instead, it made them feel that he was a beautiful little youth.

Qiao Chu and the rest swept their gazes several times over three new ring spirits. It was very strange that they had never seen these three people in the Spirit World before.

“Little... Little Xie...these all...are your ring spirits?” Qiao Chu swallowed his saliva subsciously. Putting their fighting prowess aside, just by the sheer number of ring spirits already would have scared someone to death?

It was already very gratifying that a person had a ring spirit, but Jun Wu Xie was simply a maverick. Five years ago, she had already crushed the confidence of everyone with three ring spirits, and now five years later, she actually had six ring spirits! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Qiao Chu felt that his self-confidence had been shattered to smithereens.

It was infuriating...

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly.

“We’ve never met them before.” Rong Ruo looked at the three new ring spirits, with a trace of doubt. If they added up the years, they had also spent quite a considerable amount of time in the Spirit World, all in all they were there for about six years. Even if they had not met all the spirits, but the plant type ring spirits were rare and if they had met before, they would never forget.

“The few of us don’t really like to go out and walk around.” Standing at one side, the valiant man answered straightforwardly but the moment he opened his mouth, Qiao Chu who was standing opposite him immediately froze!

A sour and rancid smell flowed out of his mouth and rushed to Qiao Chu’s face and the disgusting smell made Qiao Chu’s face turn white instantly.

Oomph!

What kind of smell was this?!

Did... did this guy just eat a dead person?!

Qiao Chu held his breath, afterall, the other party was Jun Wu Xie’s ring spirit. He could not be so rude outright hence he could only endure it as his complexion changed from white to green as he tried his hardest to hold on.

The ring spirit realized his mistake the moment he opened his mouth and he subconsciously wanted to apologize to Qiao Chu, but as his mouth was just about to open, Qiao Chu’s face looked as if he had just ate some faeces and his face almost turned purple!

With a bam, a cold light swept from the front, and the ring spirit who was about to open his mouth again to speak was suddenly covered by that cold light. A layer of crystal clear ice completely condensed on his mouth and sealed the mouth that was about to open!
