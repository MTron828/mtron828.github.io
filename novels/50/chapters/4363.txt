Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie’s appearance made Long Yao acutely aware of the flaw in his plan but he was not going to give up just like that.

And at that moment, Bai Zhu clearly saw Jun Wu Xie standing on the platform from a crack in the back room.

Her murderous intent was palpable.

Bai Zhu’s heart instantly jumped to his throat. He did not expect Jun Wu Xie would go directly to the arena, much less that the situation would turn into this!

There was nothing in Bai Zhu’s heart and mind except fear. He was lucky that at that moment, he was in the back room.

“Lord....Lord Long Yao....what....are we going to do now?” Bai Zhu asked in a trembling voice.

If Jun Wu Xie was really prepared to challenge the Top Ten exponents, then would Long Yao’s carefully thought out plan be laid to waste?

Long Yao’s mood had also turned sour, he looked out at the arena. All the participants were looking at Jun We Xie with nothing but fear in their eyes, it did not take a genius to figure out that nobody else would dare get up on the platform that day.

Long Yao’s gaze narrowed and through the deathly silence, he finally spoke.

“The one on the platform, could it be Lord Yan Hai of Sea Spirit City?”

Jun Wu Xie raised her head, matched Long Yao’s wild stare with an icy look of her own and said matter of factly, “Yes.”

Long Yao sighed deeply, and spoke again, “Does anyone in this arena want to challenge Yan Hai?”

The only response Long Yao got was a sea of petrified looks.

In the Upper Realm, nobody dared to challenge the power of the Dual Spirit Rings, it was something that nobody would think of challenging in their lives.

Long Yao’s expression grew angrier, it was as he expected. But if he allowed Jun Wu Xie to succeed, what would happen to his plan? Long Yao narrowed his eyes once again and said, “Yan Hai, since nobody dares to fight you, you may challenge the Top Ten exponents. Tell me, who do you want to challenge?”

Long Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie with half closed eyes, he was already hatching another plan. So what if Jun Wu Xue turned up?

According to the rules of the selection, Jun Wu Xie could only challenge the Top Ten exponents after winning the selection. If she won, she would replace that person in the Top Ten ranking. But if she failed, she would have to go through another selection.

With Jun Wu Xie’s power, with the hatred in her heart added into the mix, meant she would definitely not go easy in the battle. However, no matter how much she wanted revenge, she would only be able to kill one person at most while her companions were attacked by five!

How would she deal with the remaining four after killing one?

Long Yao was waiting for Jun Wu Xie to make her choice.

At this moment, in the back room, Fang Jinghe and the others were looking at each other nervously, terrified to be named by her. They knew whoever that was called would have a slim chance of survival!

Jun Wu Xie looked coolly at Long Yao, her gaze then looked beyond him and into the back room.

That look gave Bai Zhu, who was hiding in the room, a big surprise. It was as if she knew he were inside the room!

As Bai Zhu was percolating in his thoughts, Jun Wu Xie disappeared from the arena so suddenly and with such speed that it made the audience gasp!Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
