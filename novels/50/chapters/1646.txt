Chapter 1647: “The Secret Worry of the Blood Fiend Palace (5)”

From the beginning to the end, Gu Ying just followed silently at the side, quietly looking at Gu Xin Yan who was showered with Gu Yi’s doting love, the smile never once fading from his face.

Gu Xin Yan’s return put Gu Yi in a extremely good mood and he held a great welcoming feast on that very same day, inviting all the disciples that came back to gather together, celebrating the fact that Gu Xin Yan had come back.

Gu Xin Yan sat right beside Gu Yi, a faint smile on her face, but just looking at that smile and one could see that it was a little forced, a little stiff.

“Little Yan, is there anything on your mind? After you came back this time, why do I feel that you are rather gloomy?” Gu Yi asked as he looked at Gu Xin Yan, his eyes full of worry. This daughter of his, had been cradled within his hands from young, never letting her suffer any anguish. Now that he saw that Gu Xin Yan was looking so distracted, he could not help but feel a little worried.

Gu Xin Yan jumped slightly and immediately shook her head.

“No, I’m just a little tired that’s all.” Gu Xin Yan said with a slight smile to brush the matter off, not revealing how much of a struggle and conflicted she had been feeling this entire time.

Every night in her dreams, the same figure would always appear, seemingly neither close nor faraway. It seemed as if she could reach out and touch it but everytime she stretched her hand out, that person became further and further from her, no matter how she tried..... she was unable to reach it.

“It has been hard on you. It’s good that you’ve come back.” Gu Yi said benignly.

Gu Xin Yan smiled and did not say anything. When Gu Xin Yan turned her eyes back, her gaze suddenly spotted Gu Ying who was seated in a corner and staring at her with smile on his face.

That smile just sent chills running through Gu Xin Yan.

She and Gu Ying were step siblings from the same father. Gu Ying’s mother was married to Gu Yi before Gu Xin Yan’s mother and when Gu Xin Yan was still a very young child, she had seen Gu Ying’s mother. She was an extremely beautiful woman and Gu Xin Yan still remembered now the day when she had stumbled into that little courtyard and saw that lady playing the zither under the peach blossom tree.

That was the most beautiful woman Gu Xin Yan had ever seen in her life.

Gu Ying’s mother.

Of the Nine Temples, the Young Lady Lord of the Spirit Void Temple.

And the most beautiful person throughout the entire Nine Temples and Twelve Palaces.

It was once rumoured that the Young Lady Lord of the Spirit Void Temple was the most beautiful person throughout the entire Middle Realm and countless highly talented and good looking men had tried all ways and means seeking to merely win a smile from her. Gu Yi had been one of those pursuers at that time and it was not known why the Young Lady Lord of the Spirit Void Temple had chosen to marry Gu Yi but what was once seen to be a match made in Heaven receiving the blessings of many just changed entirely in the end.

Within the Blood Fiend Palace, no one dared to mention that person. The very young Gu Xin Yan had only seen that person once when she unconsciously stumbled upon her and saw that she was truly indeed very beautiful.

But for some reason unknown to everyone, Gu Yi changed entirely as a person after he married the Young Lady Lord of the Spirit Void Temple, no longer so loving and indulgent when he had pursued for the fair lady’s hand, to have turned to become cold and distant.

Even the birth of Gu Ying had not been able to salvage all of that. On the day that Gu Ying was born, Gu Yi was receiving Gu Xin Yan’s mother into the Blood Fiend Palace as his bride, the entire Blood Fiend Palace filled with endless celebratory festivities, but not a single person remembered about the Young Lady Lord who was labouring in childbirth.

Gu Xin Yan could no longer remember when the Young Lady Lord passed away but only remembered that her death had come and passed without a whisper. It was only after several years had passed that Gu Xin Yan came to know about the news.

It wasn’t that Gu Xin Yan was unaware of the great disparity in the way Gu Yi treated her and Gu Ying.

They were both children of his, but the harsh manner that Gu Yi treated Gu Ying sometimes highly flustered Gu Xin Yan.
