Chapter 2434: It’s Been A While (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie’s fingertips swept through the tough Soul Binding Chains, the ice cold blasts from her fingertips spread throughout the chains, and gently, a couple of the Soul Binding Chains cracked, and crumbled to dust.

What was a noisy, chaotic battlefield seemed to have descended into silence in that instance as the Soul Binding Chains were removed by Jun Wu Xie. She walked towards the carriage, staring intently at the closed door of the carriage. Her cold eyes observing any sort of silent movement.

Jun Wu Xie stood in front of the carriage door unmoving. The strong scent of blood permeated her nose. The smell that was once detested, now constantly lingered on her body.

The cold eyes were just looking at the door quietly, seemingly hesitating and wavering.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes drooped as she raised her hand to push open the closed door.

In the middle of the carriage, a familiar figure was imprinted onto Jun Wu Xie’s eyes, as it was overlapped with the lingering memory of that same figure.

“You came.” Jun Wu Yao sat in the middle of the carriage with Soul Binding Chains wrapped around him, unable to move. But the warm smile on his face seemed to draw people in.

He sat quietly within that small space in the carriage, just like a drawing that was isolated from the surrounding horror. It blocked out the noise, blocked out the killing as time seemed to have solidified at that moment. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Jun Wu Xie stared at Jun Wu Yao dumbly, seemingly returning to the time when both first met several years ago.

At that time, not unlike at present, he was also bound by the Soul Binding Chains, trapped in total darkness.

Under the light of the setting sun, Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes traced that familiar face, as if searching for something.

A separation of five years, finally, they meet again.

There was a hint of a smile on Jun Wu Yao’s face as he looked at that little lass. After 5 years, the girl from his memories seemed to have undergone a metamorphosis. Those brows and eyes, although still familiar, contained more coldness in them.

A smile bloomed from the corner of his mouth, as Jun Wu Yao’s smiling purple eyes gently traced inch by inch of Jun Wu Xie’s face. As with the past five years, each time he dreamt, it was the same. It was just that, that smile as the moments passed, slowly solidified on his lips.

The smile in Jun Wu Yao’s eyes slowly faded as he looked upon Jun Wu Xie. He did not understand why instead of feeling excitement for the reunion, he instead felt a sense of suffocation, an indescribable sense of oppression.

Obviously standing before him was the little fellow of his dreams, but without knowing why, this meeting caused his heart to suddenly seize up.

His Little Xie.

There was something different.

But it was unclear exactly what was different.

Jun Wu Yao only wanted to break the chains binding him and to hold her in his arms. There was nothing else that could suppress the longing and emotions within his heart.

But.....

Jun Wu Xie came out of her stupor and slowly walked towards the center of the carriage. She bent slightly at the waist and with her long, pale hand, covered the Soul Binding Chains that were wrapped around Jun Wu Yao’s body. Thick eyelashes fanning her downturned eyes hid any expression. She didn’t utter a word, as she slowly drew her fingers over the Soul Binding Chains.

“Little Xie?” Jun Wu Yao seemed to be dumbstruck, as an unexpected heartache rose up in his chest. This Little Xie was definitely different from the past, and although he could not pinpoint exactly what it was, it caused him to feel suffocated with a sense of repression.
