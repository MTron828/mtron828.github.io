Chapter 3018 Fast death 6

“Lady Ying... Lord Long Yao is indeed dead. Lord Chi Yan has sent someone to verify it and his death has been confirmed ... and well... it seems that even his soul has also been completely ...” The ghoul masked man did not go on, only because the news received from Chi Yan was really incredible.

Not only was Long Yao dead, even his soul was destroyed. He did not know what kind of power had done such a feat.

It seems like...

There was no chance of rebirth forever.

Su Ruiying knew everything about souls. She didn’t need the ghoul masked man to explain any further. She had already had a rough idea and her face turned pale. The puppet that had been carved halfway suddenly dropped on the table.

“Who did it?” Su Ruiying asked stiffly.

The ghoul masked man replied: “It is Yan Hai.”

“It’s him indeed!” Su Ruiying took a deep breath, not surprised by this answer.

The strength of a Knight of Destruction had surpassed the Top Ten Experts. Looking at the entire Upper Realm, there were only three people who could kill Long Yao.

She and Jun Gu could not do anything, only His Lord and the head of the Knight of Destruction Chi Yan could. But now, there was one more person, Jun Wu Xie.

Long Yao came to find her before. It was because Long Yao and Jun Wu Xie had conflicts before, so he wanted to make use of her strength to deal with Jun Wu Xie so that she had no chance to get revenge.

However, no one thought that shortly after Long Yao found Su Ruiying, he was killed by Jun Wu Xie, and furthermore, he was killed in front of masses!

It seemed that Long Yao’s worry was not wrong, but it’s a pity ... He still couldn’t escape...

“Yan Hai mentioned before that he still had some matters to deal with, is it possible that... He was referring to Long Yao’s matters?” Su Ruiying’s heart was startled, and she suddenly felt that she had almost stepped into the abyss.

The vengeance of Jun Wu Xie was stronger than she thought. She never thought that Jun Wu Xie would seek revenge for her companion’s life to such an extent.

“Lady Ying, Long Yao is dead, so previously what Long Yao had entrusted you to do...” The ghoul masked man asked nervously.

Su Ruiying’s complexion suddenly changed. She slapped the ghoul masked man directly with her hand and angrily said, “What do you mean by entrusted me to do, you don’t have to talk about it. Long Yao came to see me, but I didn’t even bother about his request! Take care of your mouth, and if you let this matter reveal a bit, I will let you thoroughly dissipate! Do you understand!?”

Su Ruiying glared at him fiercely and he quickly cowered and nodded anxiously.

“Get out! I’m upset when I see you!” Su Ruiying cursed, and the ghoul masked man stepped back out tremblingly.

But Su Ruiying was still afraid.

Jun Wu Xie looked cold and indifferent. She was not like a person who sought revenge for the smallest grievance. The reason why Su Ruiying dared to agree with Long Yao’s request was that he had something on her. And she felt that Jun Wu Xie was no threat.

But Long Yao’s death made Su Ruiying realize for the first time that Jun Wu Xie was not as harmless as she seemed on the surface.

At the thought of almost carrying out Long Yao’s request and preparing to create indelible damage to Jun Wu Xie’s memory during the cleaning process, Su Ruiying felt a chill run down her spine.

“Long Yao, you died well. Death is really good. Since you are dead, you can’t bother me anymore.” Su Ruiying hugged her arms and spoke coldly.
