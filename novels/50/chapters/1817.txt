Chapter 1818: “Grace and Grudge Distinctly Separated (2)”

Jun Wu Xie’s front foot had just stepped into her own little courtyard and had not even warmed her seat when she saw Yue Ye running over huffing and puffing, her little face flushed pink from running.

“I..... I had not been able to thank you. This..... Take it as a gift in thanks, to thank you for saving my brother.....” Yue Ye said as she looked nervously at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie was holding a fresh apple in her hand and she had been about to bite into it when Yue Ye came suddenly to offer her thanks and she was interrupted.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the fragrance sachet Yue Ye was holding in her hand and then looked up into her pink tinged little face, to finally choose to put the apple down.

“Your elder brother and I are fellow disciples and saving him is a matter within reason, so there is no need for you to thank me.” Jun Wu Xie said indifferently.

Yue Ye however shook her head. “For saving his life, if you do not need words of thanks, then please accept this small little token.” Upon saying that, Yue Ye did not even give Jun Wu Xie the opportunity to reject it but just put the sachet on the table and then running out in a hurry.

Truly, coming without casting a shadow and departing without leaving a trace.

Jun Wu Xie was speechless as she stared at the fragrance sachet on the table. Looking at the sachet, it wouldn’t be considered to be exquisite and the needlework seemed a little badly done. It was not hard to see that it must have been something that Yue Ye had made herself.

“Meow?” The little black cat appeared silently, and went forward to sniff at the fragrance sachet before reaching a paw out to scratch at it a bit.

[That little imp brought this strange thing here for what? It’s a trick! Definitely a trick!]

Other people might not know what Yue Ye had done before clearly. But the little black cat who had always been in Jun Wu Xie’s body definitely knew everything about what Yue Ye had done previously.

Back when Yue Ye had come to find Jun Wu Xie the last time, she had spilled her tea in a moment of fluster, seemingly hopelessly clumsy. But in that moment of confusion, she had soundlessly thrown a tiny pill into the spout of the teapot.

To cause the pot of tea to turn into calamity for an entire pool of koi fish.

Jun Wu Xie picked up the fragrance sachet to take a look at it, where she then put it before her nose to sniff at it. The fragrance sachet was emitting a faint scent of lily and from the tiny gaps in between the simple and crude stitching, dried and treated petals of lily could still be seen.

But within that light fragrant scent, Jun Wu Xie detected a little bit of another scent that was almost indiscernible.

That scent was a little similar to that of lilies but just with a tiny tinge of bitterness, and under the scent of lilies, it was not obvious at all.

Jun Wu Xie creased up her brows.

“Looks like someone wants to cut me some slack.” A smile then rose within Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

The other day, the drug that poisoned a whole pool of koi had astounded her. But today, the drugs in this fragrance sachet were although not as strange and peculiar, but it was highly interesting.

What matter more was..... Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The drugs in this fragrance sachet would not bring any kind of danger to a person, but was instead like the kind of elixir that she had given to Yue Yi to take, that made a person mistakenly think that their bodies were unwell, and growing weaker by the day, but their bodies were actually highly vigorous and healthy.

Such drugs, brought absolutely no harm to the human body, but was just a form of deception.

The drugs between the two instances were sharply different that made Jun Wu Xie seem like she discovered something, a point that gradually cleared up the guesses she was holding in her heart.

“Meow?”

[Could this thing be something that that old fart Elder Yue forced the little imp to bring here?]

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“I think there is a need for me to have a good little chat with Yue Yi’s little sister.” Upon saying that, Jun Wu Xie picked up the fragrance sachet and slipped it into her sleeve.
