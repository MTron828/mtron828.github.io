Chapter 2969 Ridiculous poison king 4

Bai Zhu stared at Jun Wu Xie in a dumbfounded manner. In his mind, countless images appeared at this moment.

At that time, he had just attained the position of the White Night City Lord. When the White Night City was in trouble, he was fortunate to have several confidants left by his father, which aided him through the most difficult years. After the White Night City was stable, his strength had also been stable. He could still remember that day where he hosted a banquet and invited the elders to drink together. But alas, he poisoned the drinking water.

Great achievers neglect small details.

This was what Bai Zhu had always believed in. No matter whether it was a danger on the surface or a possible threat, he would not hesitate to eradicate it.

Therefore, knowing that as long as he did not actively provoke Jun Wu Xie, she would not retaliate against him. Bai Zhu still thought more, he was extremely unwilling to have Jun Wu Xie accomplish his dream. ... He was not resigned....

Just as Jun Wu Xie said.

Everything today ... DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He deserved it ...

If it wasn’t for excessive suspicion and expansive ambitions, Bai Zhu could be at ease with his city lord position of White Night City. Jun Wu Xie would not take away any power from him. A man’s heart who was not content is like a snake which tries to swallow an elephant. He finally took this step.

The cooperation with Long Yao prompted him to stand on the opposite side of Jun Wu Xie.

If Bai Zhu didn’t join Long Yao and scheme against Qiao Chu and their companions, if he had not chosen to go directly against Jun Wu Xie, maybe she would not have used such a terrible poison against him. But what Bai Zhu had messed with was irreversible. That unforgivable sin!

Bai Zhu suddenly slumped onto the ground as his bones had become abnormally weak. He found it very laborious to even support his own head to look at Jun Wu Xie.

Long Yao’s expression was slightly haggard. Looking at Bai Zhu’s appearance, he was helpless. It felt as if Jun Wu Xie had thrown him a few slaps on his face. His face felt a hot sting.

“Yan Hai, don’t forget about this place, you can’t dirty it!” Long Yao seemed to want to support his confidence.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Long Yao and swept away.

“Rest assured, I remember.”

Long Yao gritted his teeth. He didn’t know what Jun Wu Xie would do next. Bai Zhu’s condition would easily stain the area within a three metre perimeter. However, Jun Wu Xie’s calmness made Long Yao feel uneasy.

Just when Long Yao was uneasy, Bai Zhu who was paralyzed on the ground suddenly twitched violently. His pus suddenly swelled, and the whole person instantly became a meatball, with blood vessels and blue veins spreading thin. It looked really disgusting.

Fang Jinghe, who was closest to Bai Zhu, was so frightened that he ran away. He was afraid that Bai Zhu would splash on him when he exploded.

Others were also prepared to retreat.

At this moment, Bai Zhu’s consciousness was blurred. There was no pain, it was as if it was amassing. At the moment when his body was expanding, every cell and every nerve on his body seemed to be crushed by a boulder. His eyes turned white and his mouth started to foam.

What was more frightening was that Bai Zhu’s throat seemed to be blocked by a kind of mucus, which rendered him unable to make a sound under the severe pain.

At the moment everyone thought that Bai Zhu’s body would explode. The surface of Bai Zhu’s skin exuded a burst of steam, and white mist drifted with the wind. Bai Zhu’s body was like a deflated ball. In the same way, it dried up quickly, but the skin that was originally pink had instantly turned yellow, and clung to his bones tightly.
