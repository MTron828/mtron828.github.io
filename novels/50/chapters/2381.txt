“I don’t understand what you are talking about.” Situ Heng retorted coldly.

Jun Wu Xie was not at all surprised by Situ Heng’s denial. She just sat on a chair by the side and looked provocatively at him before she continued on: “Don’t understand? Then why did you react so passionately before? Each and every word was full of suggestion that misled others that the Spirit Lord had harmed me.”

Situ Heng’s heartstrings tightened!

At that moment, he thought that her death was imminent. Naturally, he did not have too many concerns. With the death of Jun Wu Xie, others would only grieve for her death, who would be concerned about his suspicious behaviour? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, now that Jun Wu Xie was safe and sound, all that he did was indeed extremely suspicious.

Now, Situ Heng knew that no matter what, he could never admit it. He could only harden his resolve and said: “Don’t tell me it isn’t true? Ten rounds of treatment was carried out under the advise of the Spirit Lord. I was merely following his instructions. If you have any accident, is it not related to him?”

“You really do care about me very much. Hmm...?” Jun Wu Xie said it in an indifferent tone.

“I have said before that your life and death have nothing to do with me. What I care about is the seed of the Spirit Tree in your body. If the seed of the Spirit Tree is damaged, I will not be able to complete my mission.” Situ Heng replied calmly.

“You are a very clever person.” Jun looked at Situ Heng as she raised an eyebrow.

Now that things had come to this, Situ Heng could still maintain his facade, he was really a deep person, but...

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand slightly, and with her movement, the black cat fell on the table beside her. Under the gaze of everyone, the black cat spat out a red ball onto the table.

“Qin Song, Long Jiu, both of you are from the Soul World. Can you tell me what this thing is?” Jun Wu Xie pointed to the red ball on the table.

Qin Song and Long Jiu were puzzled. They could not understand what her question had in relation to Situ Heng’s innocence. But they could not do anything until things were clarified properly.

Qin Song held the dark red ball in his hand. At first he didn’t notice any abnormality, but as he used his soul power to probe it, a dark red mist lingered on his palm. In a flash, his face suddenly had a great change!

A group of flames condensed by his soul power appeared in his palm immediately and the mist was completely burned.

Long Jiu’s face by the side had also turned extremely ugly.

“This thing, where did you come from?!” Qin Son furrowed his brows deeply as he looked seriously at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie gaze fell onto Situ Heng.

“This thing was given to me by Situ Heng here, administered during the process while treating me.”

When they heard her explanation, Qin Song immediately swept his gaze to Situ Heng, his gaze as sharp as a knife.

“Situ! Is what she said true? This Soul Devourer... was it really brought out by you?” For the first time ever, Qin Song had revealed such a grave tone.

Situ Heng’s face had turned ashened. As soon as he saw the black cat spit out the red ball, he had been petrified on the spot. He couldn’t believe what he saw.

In the face of the barrage of questions from Qin Song, Situ Heng gritted his teeth.

How could this be!

How could this little wretched bitch contain the Soul Devourer and protect her soul from damage? !

This was simply impossible!

It was impossible to isolate the Soul Devourer and not harm the soul!

Jun Wu Xie looked at Situ Heng’s ashened face, and suddenly said: “Are you very curious as to why this thing is not in my soul? Moreover, I can even take it out?”
