Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A fire razed the former Cloudy Brook Academy to the ground, but it also lit up the flame in everyone’s heart as they looked forward to the day that they could exact their revenge.

“Why don’t Master Bai Xu come with us to the Lower Realm? Your medical skills are high and you can teach the doctors in the Lower Realm.” Rong Ruo smiled as she looked at Bai Xu and invited him to follow them on their journey back.

Bai Xu had already heard the exchange between Jun Wu Xie and Nangong Lie and had understood that they intended to ambush the people of the Upper Realm in the Lower Realm. In order to see the Ren Huang’s revenge carried out, he had no qualms and nodded.

But if they were talking about medicine...

“You don’t have to comfort me. Compared to Jun Wu Xie’s skills in medicine, I really pale in comparison.” Bai Xu chuckled, as the only Medical Sage in the Middle Realm, he had once thought that his own medical skills were unparalleled in the world. However, after he met Jun Wu Xie, he knew that he was just a frog sitting at the bottom of a well. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“That Little Xie is a perverse genius, let’s not compare with her.” Qiao Chu interjected.

Jun Wu Xie did not pay any heed to the words of her companions, she knew that they said it all to console Bai Xu.

“Little Xie, when do we set off to return to the Lower Realm?” Hua Yao rode his horse over and came to her side. The path that they were now on was currently headed in the direction of the Dark Regions, not the Lower Realm.

“I have to go back to the Dark Regions and deal with some things first.”

Hua Yao exchanged glances with Fan Zhuo who was at the side and at the same time, they had an answer in their hearts.

The things that Jun Wu Xie had to deal with were most probably related to the matters of the Soul World.

As they made their way back to the Dark Regions, everyone was exhausted after such an eventful day. They had a day filled with bloody battles and when they arrived at the Dark Regions, the Night Regime who had gained victory did not hold any celebrations but each and every one of them calmly returned home to have a good rest.

Just as Jun Wu Xie arrive at the entrance to the palace, the figure who came to welcome her made her brows furrow.

That person was one of the three people sent by the Soul World – Situ Heng. Among the three of them, he was the one whom the Night Regime disliked the most.

Ye Gu was walking behind Jun Wu Xie and the moment he saw Situ Heng, his expression turned extremely unsightly. But for the others, it was the first time meeting Situ Heng. They had stayed here in the Dark Regions for half a month and had met Long Jiu as well as Qin Song. As for Situ Heng, they had only heard of his name but had never met him.

Situ Heng looked to be about twenty eight to twenty nine years old. His countenance was good but he looked a little old-fashioned. His pair of gray eyes seem shun and despise everything in the world, and coupled with a stiff expression. This was a stark contrast with his face and when people looked at him, they could not help but feel a little uncomfortable.

Situ Heng’s gaze was only on Jun Wu Xie and he was oblivious to everyone who was behind her and treated it as if they did not even exist. It was as if they were air.

“I heard that you want to go to the Lower Realm?” Situ Heng asked in a raised tone, with a hint somewhat like an interrogation.

“Yes.” Jun Wu Xie replied straightforwardly.

“You should have not forgotten about the agreement between us? You have repeatedly delayed... what are you trying to do?” There was a hint of dissatisfaction in Situ Heng’s voice. Towards her recent moves, he wasn’t too thrilled. If not for Qin Song stopping him, he would already have gone to look for her. Fortunately, nothing cropped up. Forget about the previous times where she had gone out. Now, she even wanted to go to the Lower Realm!

“I haven’t forgotten, I have to go to the Lower Realm. I remember the agreement which is why I’ve come back today to tell you all to prepare. Tomorrow, we will set off to go to the Lower Realm.” Jun Wu Xie replied as she looked at him in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.
