Whether Bai Zhu meant it or not, this was exactly what Jun Wu Xie needed.

After a moment of silence, Jun Wu Xie nodded slowly, and Bai Zhu immediately led the way with a smile.

Looking at Bai Zhu who was fawning over Jun Wu Xie, Bai Mo’s brows were deeply wrinkled. Standing to the side, Qiao Chu watched Bai Mo give an extreme expression, and couldn’t help but quipp, “My nephew, it is truly amazing how thick the younger generation’s skin is!”

Jun Wu Xie might as well have carved the words “Get Lost” on her face, but Bai Zhu could still behave in such a familiar manner. This really made Qiao Chu’s stare with his eyes wide open.

Bai Mo licked his lips and looked at Qiao Chu with a complicated expression.

“Idiot”

Qiao Chu was confused at getting scolded by Bai Mo. Before he could react, Bai Mo went forward, which confused Qiao Chu. “This is a matter for the Bais, what does it have to do with me?” Qiao Chu scratched his head silently.

Rong Ruo sighed aloud, “Bai Zhu is being so attentive, that there is definitely more than meets the eye. Bai Mo should be thinking this too and thus reacted as such.”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Chu was a little confused.

Hua Yao spoke up, “The end game is not yet certain, but with Bai Zhu’s status, there is no need to fawn over Little Xie in this manner. Although Little Xie has become the Overlord of the 72 cities, she will never intervene. It can be said that as long as you don’t provoke her, things in the 72 cities will remain the same, and Bai Zhu will maintain his current status in White Night City. No matter how much he tries, the Little Xie won’t give him more.”

Bai Zhu’s attention was a bit overboard, but Jun Wu Xie could not possibly have failed to notice what those at her side already have.

Several youths had their own opinions and although not obvious, they were watching Bai Zhu’s every move.

Bai Zhu led Jun Wu Xie and the rest to a restaurant in the Sacred City. He very arrogantly reserved the whole floor, ordered a tableful of delicacies, and generously treated Jun Wu Xie and the others to a meal.

During the banquet, Bai Zhu sat down next to Jun Wu Xie, as if he already knew what Jun Wu Xie was interested in. Bai Zhu did not talk much nonsense, but went directly to talking about the current Top Ten Exponents.

“My lord, please look over there.” Bai Zhu said as he raised his hand, He arranged to be at the window on the second floor of the restaurant so that when he raised his hand, he was pointing at someone below.

The man was wearing a light, pale green gown and had a tall and thin build, he was so thin he seemed to consist of skin, bone and not much else. His cheeks were sunken, and dark rings under his eyes. Next to him were a few burley guards, and everyone who walked on the road was trembling and respectful.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and looked at the man, waiting for Bai Zhu’s next words.

“That is Fang Jinghe, who is ranked seventh among the Top Ten masters and the one with the most devious means. He may not be the strongest, but his skills are not to be looked down upon. If my Lord fights with him in the future, please be careful. This person’s skill is poisoning, and has trained up great immunity by having poisons in his body at all times. If he injures you, even a minor injury will spread because of the toxin and kill you.” said Bai Mo seriously and sincerely.
