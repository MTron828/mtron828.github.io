“Oh? In that case, it was unhappy that Master Nangong wanted to come to Sea Spirit City?” Bai Zhu asked with a smile.

“Whatever it is, just ask Master Nangong yourself.” Nangong Yan hummed coldly.

Bai Zhu smiled and did not speak again.

Everyone knew Nangong Yan’s shamelessness. Nangong Lie was his son, and he was one of the top ten masters. He had always been taking care of Blazing Flame City. But as soon as Nangong Lie disappeared, Nangong Yan started to put the blame on Nangong Lie in order to ease the relationship with Sea Spirit City. He was really ruthless.

There were a lot of discussions at the banquet. But everyone disagreed with Nangong Yan.

Outside the banquet, on a second-floor building in the City Lord’s manor, a figure looked through the window and saw all the happenings in the banquet. Each and every word from Nangong Yan was heard clearly.

Nangong Lie held the window frame firmly. His eyes seemed to have ignited a fiery flame under the candlelight. He looked at Nangong Yan sitting at the banquet. His face tensed up with nervousness.

Never would it come across his mind that Nangong Yan would be so heartless and had no affection for him at all.

He protected Blazing Flame City for so many years, but as a result he became a scapegoat for Nangong Yan.

What is he?

“Heard that clearly?” A slightly cold voice sounded from behind Nangong Lie.

Nangong Lie clenched his both fists tightly. After a long silence, he turned his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie, who was sitting behind.

Jun Wu Xie did not kill him. He even treated him for his injuries and helped to relieve his depressed mood. Nangong Lie did not understand why Jun Wu Xie kept letting him off time and time again. He had seen for himself how cruel and ruthless Jun Wu Xie was. She did not even spare any of the Gold Spirits in the Middle Three Realms.

Her heart was colder than ice, but ...

Why didn’t she kill him?

Nangong Lie couldn’t understand.

“What do you want me to do?” Nangong Lie took a deep breath and looked at Jun Wu Xie, he couldn’t guess her mind.

“The Upper Realm only respects the strong. I am way stronger than you. Do you need me to teach you how to do it?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Nangong Lie. Nangong Lie was young and had no serious intentions, so she spared him his life, and moreover, she needed someone who knew his way and led in the Upper Realm.

Jun Wu Yao could not do this role as he could not reveal his identity.

Zheng Weilong couldn’t because she was not influential enough.

Only Nangong Lie could fulfill this role.

Nangong Lie widened his eyes slightly and looked at those cold eyes. The next moment, he knelt down on one knee, and lowered his proud head in front of Jun Wu Xie.

“Nangong Lie meets his master.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head with satisfaction as she slowly stood up and walked towards the door.

“Come on, it’s time for the banquet.”

Nangong Lie was stunned. He stood up with flames ignited in his eyes.

At the banquet, the sound of music stopped abruptly and peoples’ voices stopped immediately. Their eyes could not help looking at the entrance door of the banquet. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Only a young man was seen walking into the banquet accompanied by two guards. The look of the young man was so outstanding, but the breath emanating from his body was very strong. That cold and indifferent temperament was a total opposite of the hustle and bustle of the banquet and no matter how noisy it was, it could not break that isolation and indifference emanated.
