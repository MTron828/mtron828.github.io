Only for this set of rhetoric, Ruan Chongshan did not fully believe that it would be useful to him, but he still needed to know after he tried it, but it was the first time that the medicine had been taken over. To the point, anyway, this medicine comes from Sea Spirit City. As long as it is determined that this medicine is really effective, will Sea Spirit City be able to escape?

Seeing Xu Zuqiang put up the elixir into the mouth with ecstasy, Ruan Chongshan’s eyes narrowed slightly, observing Xu Zu’s reaction smoothly.

The two men who had gone to the Sea Spirit City with Xu Xu before to take the medicine looked at Xu Zu with an envious look. They looked at the non-smoke and gave the medicine to Xu Zu, so they had the authenticity of the medicine. Great trust.

“Do you feel anything?” One of them couldn’t help saying.

Xu Ju touched his stomach. From the entrance of the elixir, he felt a warm current slip from his throat into the abdominal cavity, feeling very delicate, but on the other hand, there has not been much change.

“How can it be so fast.” Xu Zu glanced at the man, knowing that the other person was jealous.

“Since you took the medicine, go back and wait for it, and when it comes into effect, come back and tell me in detail.” Ruan Chongshan has to be more stable. How precious is the magic panacea in the world, even if it is in the Sea Spirit City The god of medicine is almost its god, but he still has some doubts about the effect of this medicine.

However, Xu Zu was just about to speak, and suddenly, the warm current in his belly suddenly spread to his whole body, throbbing in every vein of his! A blazing hot current wrapped around Xu Zu’s whole body, instantly made Xu Zu’s face flushed, and the big sweat beads continued to leak from Xu Zu’s forehead!

The sudden change made everyone in the hall unexpected and Ruan Chongshan, who was originally sitting on a high position, was also surprised to sit slightly upright, and his cautious eyes stared at the red face Xu. Died.

Just in front of Ruan Chongshan, Xu Zu’s spiritual power continued to rise in the blink of an eye. The speed of its rise was simply unbelievable!

Ruan Chongshan’s eyes widened involuntarily. His strength was far higher than that of Xu Zu. The change of Xu Zu’s spiritual power can be said to be very clear. The spiritual power originally contained in Xu Zu’s body was like being forced by people. Infused with huge energy in general, it was constantly expanding!

So fast!

Rao Chongshan, an old-fashioned man, was also shocked by the scene in front of him. He thought that even if this medicine was real, it was as effective as the rumor of the Sea Spirit City, and it took some time to absorb to achieve the effect, but did not I thought that Xu Zu had just swallowed the elixir, but in the blink of an eye, the effect had already occurred!

And the speed of improvement was so fast!

Suddenly, Ruan Chongshan’s eyes flashed a ray of light, watching the spiritual power of Xu Zu rising steadily, swiftly climbing to the peak of the Gold Spirit, if it was following the normal route, Xu Zu’s talent wanted to break this boundary, It will take at least fifty years, but ... Now, with a single elixir, Xu Zu suddenly crossed the 50-year gap!

If you hadn’t seen it with your own eyes, Ruan Chongshan couldn’t believe it. Under the sky, there really was such an elixir!

The spiritual strength of Xu Zu’s body only appeared gentle after climbing to the peak of the Gold Spirit peak, but then his spiritual strength was firmly set on the level of the Gold Spirit peak.
