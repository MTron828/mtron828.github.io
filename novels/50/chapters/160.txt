Chapter 161: “Playing Judge (3)”

The Emperor shut his eyes, unable to watch the horror before him.

He had thought, with Qing Yun Clan’s might, Jun Wu Xie would not have dared to harm Bai Yun Xian. He realised he couldn’t be more wrong.

Jun Wu Xie doesn’t dare?

What a joke!

She was just as vicious to Bai Yun Xian as she was to Mo Xuan Fei!

Mo Qian Yuan was stunned and stood rooted to the ground, he had meticulously planned a variety of ways to force the Emperor to abdicate, and they were now all useless with Jun Wu Xie’s simple and pure brutal ways.

“Wu Xie, what are you doing?” Mo Qian Yuan gulped and asked in a whisper.

Jun Wu Xie spared him a glance and laughed coldly: “Isn’t it obvious?”

“.....” He was utterly stumped!

Jun Wu Xie had previously planned her moves while protecting the sanctity of the reputation Jun Family, in the massacre of officials, or taking over control of the Imperial City. She had planned flawlessly and no one could find fault with her actions.

But today, she was unrestrained, and dispenses punishment without reason.

Jun Wu Xie torment of Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian today, seemed to be in revenge for their past actions.

Two hours seemed to have flown by. Bai Yun Xian was frantic and covered in perspiration. She could not unseal the blocked arteries. Mo Xuan Fei did not even have the strength to howl anymore. He could only stay kneeling on the floor, shivering.

“Why..... Why is it still blocked.....” Bai Yun Xian’s eyes were red with panic, she had used all that she learnt, but to no avail. Even the various medicines from Qing Yun Clan she had with her, which she stuffed into Mo Xuan Fei, were of no use at all.....

“You lied to me, didn’t you? He was already.....” Bai Yun Xian trembled as she looked up at Jun Wu Xie, and her voice trailed off. She did not dare to take that haughty tone with Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie raised her brow in amusement as she saw the defeat in Bai Yun Xian’s eyes, and took a step towards Mo Xuan Fei.

Bai Yun Xian recoiled in fear as she stepped up.

Jun Wu Xie did not even bother to look at her, and just put her hands at the sides of Mo Xuan Fei’s knees, and pulled out two blood stained needles. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The needles were what blocked the arteries. Without removing the needles, no matter what medicines Bai Yun Xian fed to Mo Xuan Fei, it would be in vain.

“Check him again.” Jun Wu Xie said coldly.

Bai Yun Xian stretched a trembling hand to Mo Xuan Fei’s wrist. Her eyes widened in surprise,as she slumped in disbelief.

The blocked arteries were now cleared, but the disruptions in the pulse that came after told Bai Yun Xian that Mo Xuan Fei had lost his legs!

Two hours!

Just two hours!

The arteries were blocked for a mere two hours and it had turned Mo Xuan Fei into a cripple for life!

Bai Yun Xian had always bragged on her outstanding skill in Medicine. She was seen to be one who was gifted even among those of the revered Qing Yun Clan and even caught the eye of the clan chief to be accepted as a disciple under his personal tutorage. But today, she did not even possess the ability to cure Mo Xuan Fei of his condition. Her lifelong learning in Medicine, was shown to be mere “child’s play” in the face of Jun Wu Xie.

All her arrogance and dignity, fell apart and shattered at that moment. Bai Yun Xian looked up in despair at Jun Wu Xie, and saw in those cold eyes, the glamour and confidence she once enjoyed, utterly crushed and scattered.
