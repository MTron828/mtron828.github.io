Chapter 2351: The Upper Realm (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

During the time Jun Wu Xie entered the Spirit World, there was a rainstorm happening in the Upper Realm...

The wind howled while the rain showered down the earth with its bean-sized raindrops splashing everywhere on the ground. Outside a grand palace, there was a messy and miserable figure kneeling on the wet cold floor. While letting the rain fell non-stop on his body , the figure did not move a bit.

It was completely dark inside the palace and not a sound can be heard.

“You are saying that you were defeated by a woman from the Lower Realm?” Suddenly, a deep voice came out from the dark palace.

Nangong Lie who was kneeling on his knees under the rain couldn’t stop his whole body from trembling, causing him to slow down his breath at the same moment. Lowering his head and pushing both his hands to the front, he bent his body down until his forehead touched the ground. The torrential rain beat ruthlessly against his body, trying to snatch away the warmth on every inch of his body parts.

“It’s my inability to complete the task, please do punish me, My Lord.”

There was no response coming from the dark palace and everything was frighteningly quiet, except for the pouring sound of the heavy rain echoing besides Nangong Lie’s ears.

He was severely injured by Jun Wu Xie in the Spirit Void Temple. Although Su Jing Yan and his people did give him some help, they didn’t actually take that much care of him. He went to the Middle Realm because he was given a mission to build the Sacrificial Array totems there, but today, he returned with failure. Not only one hundred and eight Blood Sacrifice Palaces were destroyed, but all the troops he brought were completely annihilated. Nearly ten thousand of the Gold Spirits were gone and he was the only one standing on his last legs, with injuries and pain all over his body.

After a long time, the voice came out from the palace again.

“Is the soul bone with her?”

“This is what she said but the truth is still unknown,” replied Nangong Lie honestly.

“I got it. You may leave now.”

Nangong Lie left humbly with a wet body, not knowing which part of him was soaked in the rainwater and which part was soaked with his perspiration.

“Tell the whole thing to Qingcheng.” Once again, the voice from the palace said.

A black shadow then came out from the palace and flashed by.

In a quiet and elegant yard located somewhere, a cool but graceful figure was standing beside a crystal clear pond. Her pair of eyes, gazing in coldness, looked slightly down at the koi fish swimming under the water.

“Lady Qingcheng!” A guard walked towards her in a hurried pace and then kneeled on his single knee beside the pond.

The woman standing by the pond was Luo Qingcheng, the one who had personally went to the Middle Realm in that year. The past five years did not leave any trace or mark on her face. She turned her head a little, looking at the guard.

“What’s the matter?”

“His Lord has sent someone here. They are at the front yard now,” said the guard.

Luo Qingcheng frowned lightly.

“Master sent someone here?” Didn’t hesitate much, Luo Qingcheng stepped forward and headed towards the front yard.

When Luo Qingcheng arrived at the living hall in the front yard, two figures came into her sight. There was an extremely handsome young man drinking a cup of tea leisurely while sitting on a chair. Not saying a word, a poker-faced woman was standing behind him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lady Qingcheng was quite surprised after seeing the faces of the visitors clearly.

“Oh, It’s you?”

The man simply put down his cup and raised his eyes. His smiling eyes looked into Luo Qingcheng’s which were full of astonishment.

“Now what? Seem like Lady Qingcheng does not welcome me here.” The man raised the corner of his lips and gave a seductive smile. Though his smile came out more dazzling due to his beautiful face, it sent shivers down people’s spines for no reason, causing them to be afraid of looking straight into it.
