“What matter?” Jun Wu Xie said, not batting an eyelid.

That person was slightly dazed, his wretched eyes swept over several people around Jun Wu Xie, as he decided if he should speak or not.

“They are alright.” Jun Wu Xie said. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

That person softly said, “That is, previously Young Master asked me to put poison into Master’s meals... I did so, the medicinal effect is not strong, but it fulfils Young Master’s requirement...”

This man was a subordinate of the city’s palace. Because he was able to handle affairs smoothly and slyly, and knew also how to win the hearts of the people, he managed to obtain a good job within the palace. However, because of his limited strength, it was difficult to climb up. It was unknown how he managed to hook up with Yan Hai.

After listening to this person’s words, Jun Wu Yao knew that that the feelings were not limited to Yan Wan’s desire to kill Yan Hai, but Yan Hai has also had intentions of patricide.

Before Yan Hai went out to sea, he specially found this person, and asked him to search for a poison that will wear down the body and plant in into Yan Wan’s meals. He also promised that if in the future Yan Hai becomes the Master of the city, he will grant the man a government position.

This piece of news is indeed interesting. Not only did Jun Wu Xie quirked her eyebrows in surprise minutely, even those around her were inwardly speechless.

This was really ‘like father, like son’!

This old man was preparing to harm his own son, but his son had already taken the first time in trying to poison his father!

This type of thing could only ever happen in the Upper Realm.

“What sort of medicine? Let me see.” Jun Wu Xie asked calmly, that person immediately took out a prescription from his person and handed it to Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie took a glance, and saw the types of herbs used, and instantly knew what the poison was.

This poison was indeed dastardly, once taken beyond a month, even if it was discovered, it was very difficult to eradicate. Even with the antidote, the patient would be unable to recover his original body’s condition. It was quite vicious.

Unless one knew about the relationship between Yan Hai and Yan Wan, who would have known that a son would specifically prepare a poison for his father?

“You’ve done well in this matter.” Jun Wu Xie returned the prescription to the man, as she cast a glance at Fan Zhuo. Fan Zhuo immediately stepped forward and gave the man a bag of gold.

With a heavy bag of gold in hand, that man’s eyes were staring straight at it.

One must know, in the Upper Realm, any sort of gain is directly linked to one’s capabilities. He did not have pure intentions, and his strength was passable. Sloughing away in the palace for a year did not equate to that much money!

“Thank you Young Master! Thank you Young Master! To be able to carry out tasks for Young Master, it is truly my honor. In the future, whatever you need me to do, Young Master please just tell me. I will certainly do my utmost best, and spare no effort, even to my last breath.”

“Anything else?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

That man cleared his throat, and grasp the bag of gold carefully in his embrace. He looked around and carefully said, “I may not know too much about other matters, but I’ve heard an official say that the Master seems to be very unhappy about Young Master’s performance. That Liang Shi Shi seems to have a lot of pillow talks with Master, saying that she wants to deal Young Master. Young Master, you should be more careful, Master’s temperament is vague, I also heard...”

The man paused and discreetly gulped, “Young Master had a few brothers, who when they were born, they were discovered to have good innate talent. Logically, it is reasonable to say that they can handle the initial training, but.....”
