Chapter 158: “The Show Begins (5)”

What really ticked the Emperor off was that Jun Wu Xie had just stood there without a single word. Even if he chose to overlook that she arrived in the main hall without a bow or salutation to his Majesty as the Emperor, she did not even offer a single word of greeting! What an outrage! However, all he could do was to offer an amiable smile to his best ability.

The Emperor could not figure out what went wrong. He was almost rid of the Crown Prince, and even if he disregard that he had suddenly made a complete recovery, he had despite the odds garnered the total support of the common people! It had baffled him for a long time, but thinking back on it after seeing the pair standing in front of him, it all started after Mo Qian Yuan and Jun Wu Xie began to get close!

An obnoxious Young Miss from a declining Lin Palace, and an incompetent Crown Prince who was heavily poisoned.....

Put these two people he could have snuffed out with a snap of his fingers in the past together, and they had somehow brought upon him disaster as he had never encountered, practically placing his head on the guillotine.

And here they are, all the way in the main hall of the Imperial Palace, steps away from his throne.....

The Emperor would have roared with rage at their impunity, but he realised that the situation was not the same as before.

“Rise to your feet, you were doing it all in the interest of the kingdom, how would I place blame upon you?” The Emperor spat out those words and they left a bitter taste in his mouth.

“Your son here am ill versed in the ways of medicines and poisons, hence I have specially invited Jun Wu Xie here. The fact that the people were able to overcome this crisis in the poisoning incidents was all due to the efforts of Jun Wu Xie.” Out in the city, Jun Wu Xie had given the credit to Mo Qian Yuan to win him support, but here within the Imperial Palace, Mo Qian Yuan would give credit where it was due.

Hearing that, the Emperor was taken aback.

But to the ears of Bai Yun Xian, it prickled her she could not help but sneered condescendingly: “Her efforts?” Nobody here knew the poison better than she did, who was Jun Wu Xie to claim she could neutralise the poison?

Jun Wu Xie’s cold stare turned on Bai Yun Xian, her seemingly expressionless eyes made the hair on the back of Bai Yun Xian’s neck stand, as a chill ran through her.

“Suffering, Deglaze, Mandela.....” Jun Wu Xie recited offhandedly a long list of over ten herbs’ names, and besides a handful of common herbs, the majority were names the others in the main hall had never heard of.

The others were uncertain, but Bai Yun Xian paled noticeably as the names of the herbs were fully listed out by Jun Wu Xie.

How did she know!?

How is that possible!?

Bai Yun Xian listened in disbelief. Jun Wu Xie had just listed all the components to the exclusive Qing Yun Clan poison. The complete list, without variation! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The formula for the poison was only known to Qing Yun Clan! How did Jun Wu Xie come to know it!?

After Jun Wu Xie unhurriedly recited the list of herbs, the corners of her mouth turned up slightly, and her cold gaze fell upon Bai Yun Xian’s face. “Do not humiliate yourself by conducting child’s play such as this.”

Bai Yun Xian’s face darkened and she started trembling in indignation as she stared at Jun Wu Xie.

Child’s play!?

Mo Xuan Fei upon seeing the trembling Bai Yun Xian, went up and embraced her. He then saw the eyes of Jun Wu Xie and froze.

Those eyes! Eyes he would never forget!

He had seen those same eyes on the night of the massacre. Jun Wu Xie had stood with those eyes in the sea of blood, looking like the devil come from the pits of hell to claim those lives.

With just that one glance, Mo Xuan Fei almost fell to the floor. But with Bai Yun Xian pale as a sheet and still trembling, he gritted his teeth and stood up to Jun Wu Xie.

“Jun Wu Xie. What impunity! Yun Xian is an honoured guest of the Kingdom of Qi, and is to be treated with respect!” He had to protect Bai Yun Xian! Till the Qing Yun Clan gets here and saves them.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Mo Xuan Fei who was standing up for Bai Yun Xian, and her smiled widened.

That smile, made everyone in the main hall cringe and the hair on the back of their necks raised in warning!
