Elder Luo had been guarding the Holy Land for many years.The number of people visiting the Holy Land was usually very little on normal days. However, with Jun Wu Xie’s arrival over the past few days, it had brought a strange silence to the Holy Land.

Elder Luo sat in the room and looked through the open window and peered at Jun Wu Xie, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground to cultivate her psychic force. There was a strange flash in her eyes. When she left the Holy Land yesterday, she found her disciple Yan Xi.

She was the only disciple that Elder Luo had. Not to mention how much she liked her, but for some special reasons, she could leave the Holy Land for a long time. His Lord needed a person who knows witchcraft. Elder Luo found Yan Xi in her own tribe by chance.

Yan Xi’s status as a maiden was considered low. She was not content with that. Such a mentality was the most suitable for learning witchcraft. Therefore, Elder Luo took care of Yan Xi. Yesterday, Yan Xi had already told Elder Luo the matters between her and Jun Wu Xie. She had told everything she knew about Jun Wu Xie to Elder Luo and thus Elder Luo had a better understanding about the identity of Jun Wu Xie.

The City Lord of one of the most barren cities among the 72 Cities was able to defeat the other cities and unify a land that had been scattered for thousands of years. This alone made Elder Luo look at it with respect.

Yan Xi was also her disciple. For such an outstanding young boy to match with her disciple, Elder Luo was naturally very satisfied. Yan Xi was quite obedient to her, so as long as Yan Xi could grasp Jun Wu Xie’s heart, in the future, Elder Luo could use Jun Wu Xie’s Dual Spirit Ring to achieve many of her own goals.

Looking at the slim boy on the ice, Elder Luo’s eyes had already involuntarily emerged an ambition.

In terms of strength and mind, she never thought that she was worse than anyone in the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Previously, she would combine with a man and give birth to a baby girl in order to gain a higher status. But she did not expect that the child she gave birth to was still not as good as Han Zi Fei who was born from the stomach of an ordinary tribe person. In fact, Elder Luo had been studying witchcraft since a long time ago. She was accompanied by those poisons all day. Her body had long been unsuitable for childbirth.

However, for her ambitions, she still fought. But the result was a complete loss. Instead of letting Luo Qingcheng oust Han Zi Fei from the position of the Sacred Maiden, her own body was injured instead. The damage caused her to be in the Holy Land these years to cultivate her body through the Holy Land. Otherwise she would not recommend Yan Xi to His Lord instead of going by herself.

In that fight, Elder Luo was completely defeated. But now, looking at Jun Wu Xie in the Holy Land, Elder Luo’s ambition that has been extinguished for a long time was rekindled. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“No hurry, no hurry.” Elder Luo retracted her gaze, and a gloomy smile appeared on her beautiful face. The smile fell on Ling’er’s eyes. She shivered.

Elder Luo sorted out her thoughts, removed a few bottles of poison, and then got up and walked towards Jun Wu Xie outside the door.

During Jun Wu Xie’s cultivation, she felt that Elder Luo was approaching. She slowly opened her eyes and watched Elder Luo walk towards her enchantingly.

“I am afraid that Lord Yan is tired, why not take a break?” Elder Luo said with a smile.
