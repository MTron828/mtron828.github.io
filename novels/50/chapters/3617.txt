Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

When Jun Wu Xie tugged at Jun Wu Yao’s sleeves, Jun Wu Yao lowered his head as he gently nuzzled his nose against her forehead. Only after that did he gently let her down.

Jun Wu Xie took in a deep breath and slowly walked towards the door.

The Blood Sacrificial Rabbit’s mission was to ensure the safety of Su Ya. The only ones who could stop it would only be those who were familiar with Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie walked to Yan Bu Gui’s side, he was carrying Su Ya and his tears were streaming down without any indication of stopping. Although Su Ya looked at Yan Bu Gui calmly, in her eyes, there were ripples of grievance, blame, happiness as well as indescribable palpitations.

“Master...” Jun Wu Xie called out softly.

Yan Bu Gui who was immersed in the onslaught of emotions and the pain of seeing her suffer finally came back to his senses. He raised his head but saw an attractive youth looking back at him. He found this youth strangely familiar yet he had not met him before. Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and tore her mask off and revealed her original appearance. Only did Yan Bu Gui recognise that the youth before him was that cheap disciple of his.

“Wu Xie...” The rims of his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse.

“Master, Su Ya will be fine, believe me. I can heal her.” Jun Wu Xie said gently as her gaze met with Su Ya’s as she read the appreciation in Su Ya’s eyes.

Although they have not met for so many years, in order to protect her, he left her side enduring everything. How could his heart not feel any pain? He had been living despondently over the years, it was also a punishment for himself. Only until a year ago, when he was reminded by Jun Wu Yao, he then threw everything aside and chased after Su Ya.

During this whole year, he had been searching and searching, going through sleepless nights and had almost gone through every piece of land in the Middle Realm just to find that figure that was embedded deeply in his heart.

He had searched for a long, long time and had never thought of giving up. But only until a few days ago, he suddenly heard the news released by the Spirit Jade Palace and rushed over immediately. However by the time he had arrived, there was only the unrecognizable Cloudy Brook Academy and the severely injured Su Ya.

That beautiful lady who was arrogant in his memory, had became ruined like that. That peerless face was no longer there, everything was devastated but with a single glance, he had immediately recognized that pair of eyes. In just but an instance, his entire world crashed.

No one could understand that at the moment his world crashed down upon him, how desolate he felt...

“You... can really... heal her?” Yan Bu Gui’s voice carried a deep sense of trepidation. He did not care about her face being disfigured, did not care whether if she could stand among ordinary people in the future. Even if she remained at this, as long as she could live on, he was willing to stay by her side forever. He was willing to be her two legs and bring her to go over mountains and rivers, he was willing to be her hands, supporting her in everything under this boundless sky.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

Only then did Yan Bu Gui’s despair in his eyes dissipate as he looked at Su Ya with gritted teeth, trying his best to restrain himself from the excitement that had erupted from his heart.

“Little Ya, you heard it, you’ll be fine. Everything will be fine, I will never ever leave you. I’m sorry... really very sorry... really... really ...sorry...”

Who would have ever thought that this big man with such towering stature would cry so helplessly like a child.

Su Ya endured the pain as she lifted her broken hand and gently used her finger to caress his cheek.

“So useless, already a person’s Master, yet you still like to cry so much...”
