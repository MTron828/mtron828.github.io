As the sun disappeared into the horizon, the beautiful orange glow connected with Heaven and Earth into a line.

The atmosphere in the entire group was tense because of Jun Wu Yao and Ren Huang’s actions. Everyone held their breath at this moment, and no one dared to make the slightest noise.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord expression had turned grave. If it was pursuers, it could be the Nine Temples, or possibly people from the Upper Realm. If he could choose which opponent, he would rather it be the Nine Temples!

Jun Wu Yao’s eyes narrowed dangerously and a cold glint flashed by his purple eyes.

“Ren Huang.” Jun Wu Yao broke the silence.

“Who is it?” Ren Huang asked nervously, history was not as good as Jun Wu Yao, his perception was not as strong either.

“I leave Little Xie’er in your care.” Jun Wu Yao suddenly said. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“What? What do you mean by this?” Ren Huang was stunned for moment, the words that Jun Wu Yao just spoke... Why did he have such a bad feeling? He... Did he discover something?

“Ye Mei, act according to my previous orders.” Jun Wu Yao did not reply Ren Huang at all.

A moment of grief flashed by Ye Mei’s eyes, he clenched his fists tightly and that struggle happened just for an instant before he flashed and appeared by Jun Wu Xie’s side.

Yan Bu Gui carried Su Ya up, his gaze remained on Jun Wu Yao’s back.

The atmosphere at this moment was full of intrigue.

“Are there really pursuers? What are we waiting for? Let’s hurry!” The Spirit Jade Palace’s Lord was extremely nervous.

Jun Wu Yao took in a deep breath, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly turned cold. He stared at the black shadow that covered the sunlight and said, “It’s too late.”

“It’s too late...” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s heart dropped immediately.

Before he could finish his words, a large black figure had entered his sight.

A dense army of black robed men stepped into the remaining sunlight, entering the sight of everyone. It was at that moment that everybody’s tension had reached the highest!

The Spirit Jade Palace’s Lord held his breath instantly, as he looked incredulously at the large group of black robed men who had suddenly appeared in front of them. They were wearing the same as those of Ba He and the others and the surrounding spiritual pressure was so familiar...

It wasn’t too long ago that they had experienced the same oppressive atmosphere back at the Cloudy Brook Academy!

Gold Spirits!

They were all Gold Spirits!

The army that had suddenly appeared before them were actually... all... Gold Spirits....

Only the heavens know that the army before them was even larger than that of the Cloudy Brook Academy!

The sound of hooves resounded, and each and every sound seemed to step on the heart of the Spirit Jade Palace Lord.

The black robed men lined up uniformly and gave way. A black horse wearing a light armour came from the rear of the army. On the horse, was a stunning lady with a frosty gaze!

When Ren Huang saw the woman’s appearance, the blood in his whole body was almost frozen. His eyes widened as he looked at the person before him incredulously, he could not believe that the pursuer would actually be her!

Luo Qingcheng sat on the horse and slowly trotted in front of all the black robed men. Being shrouded with a radiant glow, she looked like a divine being that had transcended, however that pair of cold eyes was locked onto Jun Wu Yao from the very beginning.

“Ye Jue, I haven’t seen you for a long time. Have you been well?” She said in a cold tone, her eyes stared at that handsome and perfect face of Jun Wu Yao, fixed and unwavering.
