Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Fei Yan stunned slightly. In the next second, there was a huge explosion. The strong air flow blew him up, his body mixed with blood and water. Numerous rubbles rubbed past him like a blade cutting his shirt and tearing his skin.

The thick bloody smell filled every corner at this moment. The strong airflow made breathing difficult.

Fei Yan could only subconsciously clasp the ground under him so that he does not rush to a farther place.

What exactly happened?

Fei Yan’s heart was beating wildly. He wanted to open his mouth and call Rong Ruo. But his lips, which had been corroded by the poisonous mist, were already stuck together. He opened his mouth a little, and the strong wind poured into his throat. It hurts.

The intense shock finally stopped after a long time.

Fei Yan groped up in the dark and sat halfway on the cold ground.

He could not feel it ...

Feel the breath of anyone.

The breath belonging to Fang Jinghe had disappeared without trace. The murderous force and the creepy coercion were dissipated at this moment, as if it had never existed.

But...

He couldn’t find it....

He could not find a trace of breath belonging to Rong Ruo. He could sense a little bit before. But now ...

“Little ... Ruo? ... Little... Ruo ...” The panic that he had never experienced filled the Fei Yan’s heart at this moment. He stretched out his hands in the dark, groping an inch on the ground anxiously. His spirit was strained to the extreme. His pair of scarred hands constantly groping on the broken ground, trying to find his most precious treasure.

However, all he could find was the cricket rubble, and some sticky liquid that he did not know.

“Little Ruo ?! Little Ruo, where are you? Don’t scare me ... Don’t scare me ... You say something !!! Say something !!!” The huge fear filled Fei Yan’s heart. How he wished he could see.

Let him have a look, or just a glance!

“Little Ruo !!!”

The desperate growl resounded on the broken street.

In the desperate silence, a sound of footsteps suddenly arrived. Fei Yan’s spirit was tense. But in an instant, his tense spirit suddenly relaxed. He felt ...a familiar presence.

“Qiao...Qiao Chu, Brother Hua? Is that you?” Fei Yan raised his head, his voice trembling faintly.

On the empty street, Qiao Chu who was bathed in blood, stood on the unrecognizable gravel and looked at everything in front of him. Every pore in his body shrank. His blood-stained face stared to the extreme. His figure flickered a little. Hua Yao almost fell to the ground from his shoulder. He hurriedly stabilized his body, but his blood was stuck in his throat.

“Qiao Chu?” Fei Yan could not get a response. He could only speak again. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qiao Chu’s eyes swept across the blood-stained street. From the ground to the walls, everywhere was covered with fine blood spots, like a hell.

Above the earth, he saw a red butterfly. A huge butterfly dyed with blood, soaked in every slate.

“Qiao Chu, Hua Brother! You speak! Did you see Little Ruo? Did you see her !!!” Fei Yan was going to be tortured by this silence!
