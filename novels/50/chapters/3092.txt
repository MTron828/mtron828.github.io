The figure was slender and had an aura around him. It seemed that he was the only person who could dispel the fog.

Jun Wu Xie kept looking at the figure and her heart felt as if it had been crushed.

She stared blankly at the figure for a long time until the figure smiled at her and reached out his hand, when her legs seemed to have a mind of their own and started moving towards the figure.

“Wu Yao!” Jun Wu Xie threw herself into the arms of the familiar figure but it was a mirage and her body passed right through it.

Jun Wu Xie stared and looked at her empty hands. She turned around and could still see Jun Wu Yao looking at her, smiling gently.

Her lover that she could not touch....

In Jun Wu Xie’s eyes was a look of hopelessness that had never been seen before.

“Little Xie....” Jun Wu Yao’s voice rang in Jun Wu Xie’s ears. The voice was both very gentle and tragic at the same time.

“I’ve always been here and always will be by your side. As long as you don’t forget me, I will be in your soul forever.” Jun Wu Yao said gently, with a sweet smile on his face.

Jun Wu Xie balled her hands up into fists, she could not accept such an outcome....

How did it turn out like this?

“Don’t be upset, you still have unfinished business and I’m still here.” Jun Wu Yao frowned slightly, he could not bear to see Jun Wu Xie in pain.

He wanted badly to hold her in his arms but this had become an impossibility.

When his real body exploded, he gave up the possibility of holding her in his arms ever again.

However....

He had no regrets.

When he self exploded, he had prepared for the worst. He did not expect that because of his previous training in the Chaos Array, he and Jun Wu Xie would have chaos power which should not have existed in this world. The bond that the shared power gave them meant that when he self exploded, his soul got absorbed into hers.

It was just that....

Only a few damaged souls could leave such a scar.

Therefore, Jun Wu Yao was very satisfied.

More importantly, when the fragments of Jun Wu Yao’s soul merged into Jun Wu Xie’s, he suddenly discovered that the divine power in Jun Wu Xie’s soul was not fully released, the seals were only partially removed, but there was more that was still sealed up.

And he was using the chaos power to release the seals on her divine power bit by bit.

“Little Xie, don’t be sad. Do you remember your grandfather, uncle and parents? They are waiting for you, continue to battle the God of Destruction so he cannot perform the Blood Sacrifice Array of the Three Realms. But he will not let off anyone who is close to you or I....” Jun Wu Yao wished he could go into battle with her, unfortunately....

The images of her loved ones suddenly flashed through Jun Wu Xie’s mind. She looked up and the despair in her eyes was fading away.

“Protect them, just as you have always done, I will be with you through it all.” Jun Wu Yao reached out his hand and placed it on Jun Wu Xie’s head, just like he had done countless times before...
