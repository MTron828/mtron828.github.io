Chapter 3109 Finale 8

Jun Wu Yao’s return dispelled the gloom from everyone’s hearts. They were all happy for Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

“Erm...you two can reconnect later, we have important business to discuss now.” The man could not help but disturb the long suffering lovers. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jun Wu Yao looked coldly at the man, for some inexplicable reason, whenever he saw that constantly smiling face, he always had the urge to punch it in.

“Don’t look at me like that. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have the chance to reunite with Li...ah Wu Xie.” The man hummed.

“If you have something to say, just say it.” Jun Wu Yao did not appreciate the sentiment.

The man pouted, he and Jun Wu Yao just could not get along. He then turned to Jun Wu Xie and said, “Although the so-called God of Destruction has been destroyed and the Three Realms has returned to peace, the havoc he caused will not be fixed so easily. Since your powers have been restored and have also earned the faith of the people of this world, you need to step in for the missing Gods of this world and protect it.”

“What?” Jun Wu Xie was shocked.

“Eh...we hope you return but for now you need to be the God of this world and guide it back to normalcy.” The man said.

Jun Wu Xie was silent but Jun Wu Yao retorted, “Why should she?”

The corner of the man’s mouth twitched, he was still just as annoying even after so many reincarnations! He really did not understand why he was with Jun Wu Xie.

“I wasn’t asking you, I was asking Wu Xie.” the man replied.

Jun Wu Yao gave a cold scoff.

Jun Wu Xie was frowning slightly, she did not seem too interested in the plan laid out by the man. She just wanted to find a quiet, scenic mountain to live out the rest of her days with Jun Wu Yao.

The man saw her hesitation and said with a smile, “Don’t be too quick to say no. If you become the God of this world, you can make all your loved ones, even those who have passed, Gods of this world as well to protect the world with you.”

Jun Wu Xie was a little tempted as she thought of Rong Ruo, Yan Bu Gui and the rest.

“Furthermore, I’m not supposed to tell you this but you can even see the girl who lost her life for you in a previous life.” The man threw another enticement at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes turned wide in amazement, “Xiao Xiao?!”

The man smiled and nodded his head, “Yes, she is now the main God in our world and if you become a God, you can surely see each other.”

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath and said to the man, “Alright, I agree.”

The man smiled contentedly, completely oblivious to Jun Wu Yao’s contemptuous look.

“So we leave this world to you, hopefully you can restore its balance and peace.” The man raised his hands and two bursts of golden light flew from his fingertips and entered Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao’s bodies between their eyebrows.

Little Yang, do you think your own disagreement is all that matters? If Jun Wu Xie says yes, Jun Wu Yao would not ever disagree.

The man was very proud of himself for succeeding in his ploy.

When the divine power entered through their eyebrows, they both felt it permeate their whole body and awaken a strange sensation within them....
