“You’re welcome, so long as you’re optimistic. This time round, there are definitely people who are waiting for a good show. By that time, there will be a good show. You just have to follow me.” Dongfang Ku Bi patted his chest with lofty sentiments as his eyes revealed some excitement.

The corner of Yu Yuanshan’s mouth twitched slightly, all he could do was to nod his head.

In the City Lord’s manor, Jun Wu Xie was looking at the stacks of congratulations cards sent. The hall of the City Lord’s manor had been filled and piled up with treasures piled up like a mountain Ye Jie held the Hell Rodent and squatted one side while stuffing its mouth with all sorts of treasures.

“Meh?” Lord Meh Meh kicked its small hoof against the piles of gold and silver, its limbs were tied up with a circle of pearl chains, and it looked down at the huge pearls with its head down, and it looked like it was having a good time.

However, the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit jumped among the treasures. Not knowing which City Lord had sent the congratulatory gift, it pulled a huge emerald cabbage, humming and hugging with his paws and feeling satisfied.

The black cat sat calmly on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulders, looking at the appearance of two silly ones speechlessly.

When Qiao Chu and the rest arrived, they had to lean one side before they could squeeze in. The Hell Rodent could swallow a large number of treasures. But it was slower than the speed of the treasures rushing in.

In addition to the gifts given to the Banquet of Heroes from many cities, a congratulatory gift was also additionally sent to celebrate Jun Wu Xie becoming the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City. Even though this matter had passed for a long time, they still sent in the gifts using this reason.

“It feels so wonderful ...” Qiao Chu could not find the chair anymore, and sat down on a pile of gold and silver treasures with a happy face.

“Help yourself.” Jun Wu Xie looked up from the gift lists and glanced at her friends.

“No, it takes up too much space.” Rong Ruo waved her hands immediately. They didn’t have a ring spirit like the Hell Rodent who could store things. There was no place to put these things at all. Besides, it was Jun Wu Xie who reimbursed them all the expenses. They didn’t have to spend a single cent.

“Most of the 72 City Lords have already arrived. The few other City Lords from the top ten cities are still on their way. But I heard that even Nangong Yan has come. This Nangong Yan is really shrewd. He was defeated so badly previously and he still dared to attend the feast. ” Fan Zhuo said as he found a place to stand.

“The City Lords of the top ten cities are not fools, else they would not be held in this high position.” Jun Wu Xie said faintly. She didn’t care if Nangong Yan would come or not. His presence made no difference.

“I am definitely looking forward to it, what kind of expression Nangong Yan and the rest would have when they arrive.” Fei Yan touched his chin, what he loved most was to watch a good show!

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes slightly and looked at her few companions who seemed very relaxed and slowly asked, “Are you very free?”

Fei Yan and others immediately looked at her, stunned momentarily.

Jun Wu Xie suddenly stood up and threw all the things at Qiao Chu.

“Do the records.” After that, she left without looking back.

“...” For a while, Fei Yan and others looked at each other wryly.

If they had known earlier ...

They wouldn’t come over to join in the bustle.

Was it too late to regret now?

The people from the 72 cities had been arranged properly, and there were still a few days before the Banquet of Heroes. Those City Lords had greatly changed their impression of Sea Spirit City, but they still couldn’t hide their curiosity ...
