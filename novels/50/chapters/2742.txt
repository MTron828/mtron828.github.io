“Yan Hai! What do you mean?” Liang Cheng woke up from shock, staring at Jun Wu Xie’s unbelievable expression.

Jun Wu Xie stared at them coldly as the wind gently blew and she smoothed the folds of her cuffs and said lightly: “That’s what it means.”

As soon as Jun Wu Xie’s words landed, her figure disappeared again. Liang Cheng hair all stood on ends. Liu Yi and Mu En felt their scalps turn numb.

Suddenly, a pungent bloody smell permeated the air.

The fresh red blood splattered on them like rain and the warm sticky blood fell on Liu Yi’s face, making her originally charming face even more enchanting. When she saw Guan Hu, she seemed to have seen a ghost fall onto the ground instead.

Guan Hu’s head has been twisted off, blood from the broken wound at the neck gushed out, and the bloody skull grunted to Mu En’s feet. Touching it, Mu En’s face instantly turned pale.

The blood rain came down one after another, but there was a slender figure standing independent from the blood rain. The spiritual force supported by the air hood isolated the blood. However, Jun Wu Xie wasn’t stained the slightest bit.

Like a ghost from hell, the breath of death covered the whole bloody courtyard.

“... Crazy ... You must be crazy !!!” Mu En’s face was pale. His face was covered with Guan Hu’s blood. The warm blood soaked his shirt, tinged with the breath of death. Sticking on to his skin was the warm blood. But it made him feel as if he was immersed in ice water and it made shiver in the cold. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Xie was crazy!

She actually killed Guan Hu in public!

This was a deliberate and direct provocation!

What made Mu En even more frightened was the power of Jun Wu Xie. There was not a trace of resistance before and after the killing of Guan Hu. In the eyes of Jun Wu Xie, Guan Hu could only wait to be slaughtered. He was helpless.

The strength of Mu En and others were comparable to the Guan Hu. It was because of this that they will be selected by their respective City Lords to compete with each other. They thought that it would be easy to come to the Sea Spirit City to take the prescription. At the same time, Jun Wu Xie should have been kneeling down on the ground, shaking in fear whilst holding the formula, begging for his life.

However, they did not expect an evil spirit crawling out of hell instead...

“Crazy?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyebrows rose slightly. Cold eyes swept past Mu En and others, who were stained with blood and water. “No, this is just the beginning.”

Jun Wu Xie’s voice echoed into Mu En and others’ ears like a death call. For the first time, they felt endless fear and despair from their hearts. Dealing with someone that they would never consider as an opponent or give any attention to, they now realize what real terror was.

“Yan Hai! Do you want to be the enemy of the Five Cities ?!” Liu Yi shivered and the coldness from her bones made her clenched her arms subconsciously. She was frightened and stared at Jun Wu Xie.

Even if the three of them joined forces, they would still be unable to take her down.

Liu Yi saw the killing intention in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. Even if Guan Hu had died, her ruthlessness had not come to an end. Instead, the three of them were her target now.

This was the real danger that was impending ...
