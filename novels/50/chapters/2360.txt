“Forget it, let’s just skip this topic. Our purpose of visiting here this time is to revive some soul power through the help of your Spirit World. Don’t you welcome us?” said Qin Song while smiling.

The Spirit Lord shook his head and smiled. “Why won’t I? It’s even too late for me to welcome you.”

( Boxno vel. co m ) “Well then, thanks for your help.” Qin Song grinned.

Both the old friends were reunited. The tacit understanding they possessed between each other had enabled them to fully comprehend all those words which had never been spoken openly during their conversation.

“It’s quite late now. Let’s go and have some rest. We will discuss it in detail tomorrow morning.” Qin Song stood up and said goodbye. He then left together with Long Jiu and Situ Heng.

After a while, the Spirit Lord also left the place. The feast slowly ended as more people began to leave.

Jun Wu Xie returned to her accommodation which was arranged by the Spirit Lord with Qiao Chu and the others crowding around her. After they went back to their respective rooms to get some rest, Jun Wu Xie suddenly walked out of her room. Looking at the Spirit World which she was familiar with, the look in her eyes was cold and cheerless. Little Black once again transformed into a black cat and jumped onto Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder. It then looked around with its eyes opening wide.

“Are we going now?” Swaying its tail, the black cat asked.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t respond. Suddenly, the figure of hers flickered and disappeared from the place she was first standing at in just a blink of an eye.

In the Spirit Palace, though it should be the time to rest, there were few figures in the main hall of the Spirit Palace. Qin Song, Long Jiu and Situ Heng who were the first to leave the dinner was now standing in the hall. With a serious expression on his face, the Spirit Lord raised his eyes and stared at the entrance of the main hall.

Soon, Jun Wu Xie’s figure appeared in the sights of four of them.

“You came?” Qin Song looked at Jun Wu Xie while smiling.

Jun Wu Xie nodded at him. Just now, during the feast, Qin Song and the rest had been trying to avoid speaking about the abnormality of her body. Instead, they requested to leave in advance. At that time, whether it was for the Spirit Lord or Jun Wu Xie, both of them had already guessed the intention of Qin Song’s behaviour.

“It’s surely easier to deal with smart people,” laughed Qin Song. Since the Spirit Lord and him had known each other for many years, the Spirit Lord would definitely understand his style of acting. But the fact that Jun Wu Xie too, was able to get what he meant made him feel that this was why things could be easily done.

“What actually is it that made you feel inconvenient to talk about just now?” The Spirit Lord frowned. He knew about the intention of Qin Song leaving first but he thought that it was only because Qin Song had something to talk to him privately. He didn’t think that Jun Wu Xie was also involved.

Qin Song straightened his face and looked at Jun Wu Xie. After he saw Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly at him, he spoke to the Spirit Lord. “We came to the Spirit World, firstly, is to revive our soul powers. Secondly, we need your help to do something which is more important.”

“Oh? What is it?” questioned the Spirit Lord.

While his eyes narrowed a little, the smile hanging on Qin Song’s lips faded away.

“When we found Miss Jun, we had come to an agreement, that we will be helping her in her revenge and after she finished her revenge, she will return the seed of the Spirit Tree to us. I think you have already found out that the soul power of Miss Jun is way more stronger compared to the past five years, haven’t you?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The Spirit Lord nodded. Indeed, Jun Wu Xie’s soul power was several times stronger than the power she had in the past. It was just that the Spirit Lord didn’t really think deeply about it. Now that Qin Song had mentioned about it, he suddenly came to a thought that the development of Jun Wu Xie’s soul power was actually going too fast.

“To be honest, our second purpose of coming here is to ask you if you are able to stabilize both Miss Jun’s soul power and spirit energy using the cultivation in the Spirit World,” said Qin Song.

“What do you mean?” The Spirit Lord had a feeling that something bad was going to happen. When did the soul power and the spirit energy become comparable with each other and is able to be discussed in the same topic?
