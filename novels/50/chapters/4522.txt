Chapter 3118 Xiao Xie 2

The entire courtyard was eerily quiet and the figure that emerged from the light had been frightened into silence.

They stared at the Little Devil King who had been hit by a beautiful girl!

What surprised them even more was the lack of retaliation.

“Little Wu Xie, that’s certainly a special way to greet someone...” Shen Yan Xiao rubbed the sore area on his face. What had happened to LIttle Wu Xie to turn her so violent?

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath, strode forward and stared at the hateful woman in front of her with hatred in her eyes, “Greet you? Why should I have to be polite to such an arrogant and stupid woman like you?!”

“....” Shen Yan Xiao was stunned, as the Main God for many years, she had become accustomed to people hanging on her every word but when faced with Jun Wu Xie’s intense stare, she could only stand silently as she let her vent.

“You’re very capable aren’t you? You’re very powerful when standing in front of me? How did I not know that you’re capable of such dedication? I don’t care for your protection!” Jun Wu Xie didn’t hold back as she continued staring at the woman who died for her.

She never felt any care or concern in her previous life and the only person who treated her well or could make any inroads into her heart was the hateful woman standing in front of her.

But....

It was this woman who used her own life to protect her during a time of great danger.

But that scene became a nightmare for Jun Wu Xie that she has not been able to forget!

She would never be able to erase the memory of seeing her fall in front of her.

That was in a previous life where all the warmth she ever knew was wiped out in front of her very eyes....

How she wished that the one who died was her instead!

“Damn you! Damn you! Who said you could save me?!” Jun Wu Xie howled, the repressed anger of two lifetimes boiling to the surface.

As Shen Yan Xiao stood there bearing the brunt of Jun Wu Xie’s anger, any grievances she had disappeared and she smiled a little as Jun Wu Xie continued. She then extended her arms to give Jun Wu Xie a hug.

“Alright, I admit my mistake, don’t be angry anymore. You saved me so many times, but I’m not allowed to return the favour even once?” Shen Yan Xiao said gently but with a bittersweet tone in her voice.

It was good that they didn’t forget each other.

“I don’t appreciate it.” Jun Wu Xie retorted.

Shen Yan Xiao chuckled slightly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Little Wu Xie had never changed, she was incredibly soft hearted but her pride always made her keep an icy cool demeanor and an even sharper mouth.

Jun Wu Xie gradually calmed down after her initial burst of anger. The holy light had attracted the attention of quite a few people and made Qiao Chu and the others who were resting in the house go out to take a look.

They arrived in the courtyard to see Jun Wu Xie locked in an embrace with a beautiful woman they had never seen before and standing behind the woman were several tall figures.

“Brother Wu Yao....this is....” Qiao Chu inquired hesitantly.

Jun Wu Yao just shook his head.

“My apologies, I am Little Wu Xie’s friend from long ago and I came to see how she is doing.” Shen Yan Xiao said cheerfully and looked up to greet Jun Wu Xie’s family and friends. But the first person she cast her eyes on blew her away!

“Satan!!!”
