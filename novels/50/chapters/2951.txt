Bai Mo’s resolution surprised Nangong Lie. But how things should be handled from here on depends solely on Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Wu Yao raised his hand slightly. He gently touched Bai Mo’s eyebrow. Those sealed forces poured into Bai Mo’s body in an instant.

Bai Mo’s eyes widened in surprise.

“This is what you deserve.” Jun Wu Yao looked at Bai Mo and said.

If Bai Mo really left Fan Zhuo and ran away alone, he wouldn’t even think of getting back his own spirit energy in this life. But Bai Mo’s words had convinced Jun Wu Yao to give him back the spirit energy. Regardless of whether he would really stay for revenge, it didn’t matter. He was very clear what Qiao Chu and the rest meant to Jun Wu Xie. They had lost Rong Ruo. They could not lose anyone else. Otherwise Jun Wu Xie would...

Bai Mo stared at Jun Wu Yao dumbly. He struggled for a while to say something, but in the end he said nothing. He stood still and stared at Jun Wu Yao brightly.

Jun Wu Yao had already looked at Jun Wu Xie. What happened today was so sudden and he was extremely worried about Jun Wu Xie’s current mood.

“Bai Zhu, Long Yao, Top Ten Experts...” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. Now, all the clues have been stringed together. If she still couldn’t understand it, she was really a fool.

In this selection, it was clear that His Lord had fiddled. Although he might not have specifically ordered anything but he only needed to push the ambitious Long Yao to the position of the examiner and something shocking would happen.

“Miss Jun, what are you going to do now? During this time, you can rest assured that they can recuperate here. This is my private place and few people know about it. As long as they don’t go out, it is relatively safe here. Nangong Lie looked at Jun Wu Xie and said. Now that things had happened, he had more or less guessed the ins and outs of it, everything else was still up to Jun Wu Xie to decide.

The moment Jun Wu Xie let her emotions take over and ran to find the Top Ten experts for revenge, she would directly violate the rules of the selection. Even if she killed those people, Long Yao could catch Jun Wu Xie for violating the rules. Long Yao would then mobilize all the forces in the Sacred City and destroy Jun Wu Xie completely.

Even if Jun Wu Xie could overpower them and won’t be arrested easily but it would mean that she could no longer participate in this selection.

No matter how you look at it, everything that happened today was like a trap set up and dedicated to Jun Wu Xie, waiting for her to jump into it.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t say anything. Her gaze was frosty when she suddenly turned her head and looked at Jun Wu Yao and called out to him: “Wu Yao.”

“Yes?”

Jun Wu Xie whispered something gently in Jun Wu Yao’s ears. Her voice was so soft that even Nangong Lie and Bai Mo could not hear anything at all. All they could only see was Jun Wu Yao nodding his head at Jun Wu Xie.

After speaking, Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath. But the flames of anger burning in her chest did not disappear the slightest. She was fuming instead.

“It’s getting late, I will deal with it.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly as a glint flashed by.

Nangong Lie and Bai Mo didn’t dare to ask further and they left first.

In the courtyard, there were only Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao. Under the cold moonlight, their shadows were cast by the moonlight.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her head slightly and looked at the moonlight on the ground. Her silence made everyone feel depressed.
