If this amount could only be exchanged for ‘fair’, then the other teams in the same batch could only be described as ‘garbage’.

Evidently, the relationship between Yan Wan and Yan Hai was even more distant than Jun Wu Xie had imagined.

Jun Wu Xie understood but didn’t react, she just stood quietly in the hall.

“Young Master’s first time out at sea and you could reap a good harvest. Like father like son!” A soft voice suddenly drifted into the hall.

A slender figure came out from the back of the hall. A woman with an alluring face and a lithe figure, sashayed flirtatiously as she walked to the side of Yan Wan. The face held a happy yet seductive smile as she leaned her head on Yan Wan’s shoulder.

When Jun Wu Xie’s gazed touched the woman, a flash of suspicious arose.

In Yan Hai’s confession, he never mentioned the presence of such a woman.

“It’s only in the hundreds. I’ve prepared so many good crew for him, and also assigned him the route where the Sea Spirit Beasts are most active. If he can’t manage to catch that many beasts, that it will be really strange.” Yan Wan sneered at the woman for praising Jun Wu Xie disapprovingly.

That woman smiled lightly as she coquettishly nudged Yan Wan’s shoulder.

“My Lord, you are joking again. If you didn’t look after Young Master, how would be so successful? My Lord, you may be harsh towards Young Master, but you actually give him the best. And with Young Master’s innate talent, he won’t let your expectations down.”

One couldn’t tell if Yan Wan was angry or happy as he stared at a silent Jun Wu Xie who seemed to be thinking of something. After a moment, Yan Wan said, “Yan Hai.”

Jun Wu Xie lifted her head and looked at a stern looking Yan Wan.

“This is your stepmother, Liang Shi Shi. If you see her in the future, please pay your respects.” Yan Wan said suddenly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie was slightly dazed. Initially, Yan Hai mentioned that not long after he was born, his mother fell severely ill and passed away. No other woman appeared by Yan Wan’s side. Unexpectedly, Yan Hai was out at sea for a month, and upon his return, he suddenly had a stepmother!

Luckily the person who stood in the hall was Jun Wu Xie, if it was the real Yan Hai, his face would certainly be as black as a burnt pot.

Liang Shi Shi slowly took a step forward, as she intentionally cast a gentle look at Jun Wu Xie.

“Little Hai, we finally meet today. Although your father is stern towards you, but when you were not around, he was constantly talking about you.”

Jun Wu Xie quirked her eyebrows as she looked at Liang Shi Shi. Liang Shi Shi’s words were very interesting. In the Upper Realm, there was actually someone who was trying to alleviate the lack of parent-child sentiment?

Liang Shi Shi smiled brilliantly but Jun Wu Xie didn’t bother with a single word. Yan Wan, who already unhappy, saw Jun Wu Xie’s indifference, and his brows furrowed even more.

“It’s been a whole day since you’ve had that face on. What’s wrong with you? Your stepmother is talking to you. Are you mute?”

Jun Wu Xie smirked to herself, but she took great pains in saying, “Stepmother.”

“Good.” Liang Shi Shi seemed to not mind as she smiled.

“There is nothing else, go and do what you need to do.” Yan Wan gave a very brusque order. Evidently he completely did not have the so-called deep love of a parent.

Jun Wu Xie said nothing further and left, she did not want to stay on any longer.
