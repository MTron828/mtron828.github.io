Be it Su Ya or Jun Wu Yao, she refused to make a choice between the two of them.

The little black cat sighed softly as it quietly watched her immersed self from behind. The smell in the entire room was extremely toxic as it watched her busy formulating the poison and constantly putting in various poison pills in her mouth. These were so toxic that even powerful spirit beasts in the ranks like Lord Meh Meh was unable to resist, let alone people?

Jun Wu Xie’s distance from these poisons was the closest and not only was she constantly engulfed in the smell, she also directly came into contact with those herbs that were highly poisonous. If not for using the detoxifying pills, she herself would be poisoned.

Outside the room, Jun Wu Yao watched the two silly fluffballs that had been thrown out by the black cat. He narrowed his eyes but not a single emotion could be seen from that pair of deep purple eyes.

“Lord Jue.” Ye Mei silently appeared beside him.

“Mmn?” Jun Wu Yao raised his gaze slightly.

“Ye Gu has brought news that the things that Lord Jue has instructed has all been arranged.” Ye Mei replied.

Jun Wu Yao nodded his head slightly, his face did not reveal any hint of emotion.

Ye Mei remained silent but his eyes were filled with complexity.

“Lord Jue, do you really want to do this? I know that you are doing it all for the sake of Young Miss but if you expose your whereabouts so soon, I’m afraid that those from the Upper Realm would gain the upper hand and it would do you no good.” Ye Mei could not bear it anymore and spoke out, the things that Jun Wu Yao wanted to do made him worry.

“Tell me then, if I don’t do anything, will they not harm me?” Jun Wu Yao raised his brows and said in a sneer.

Ye Mei stiffened when he heard this, in fact, no matter what he did, those people had their sights set on Jun Wu Yao and would never let him go.

“Since I dare to arrange this, then it means that I can bear the consequences. There’s no need for you to say anymore.” Jun Wu Yao did not let anyone question his orders.

From the eyes of Ye Mei, it could be seen that he was struggling to hold something back.

Jun Wu Yao looked at the tightly shut door thoughtfully, but what exactly was on his mind was something no one knew.

If it was not him, then it would be Jun Wu Xie. If the Upper Realm knew that there was another Otherworldly Soul other than him, and know that Jun Wu Xie was one as well, then they would never let go of her.

In order to ensure that nothing goes wrong with the Sacrifice of the Three Realms, they would be more than happy to have a few more Otherworldly Souls. This was one thing that Jun Wu Yao would absolutely not allow.

“Ye Mei, come here.” Jun Wu Yao suddenly called him over.

Ye Mei stood up and walked closer to him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Jun Wu Yao whispered something into Ye Mei’s ears and after listening, Ye Mei’s eyes suddenly flared wide open. His complexion paled instantly to a shade of white and with a bam, both knees slammed onto the ground, with a terrified expression, he looked at Jun Wu Yao pleadingly.

“Lord Jue, please consider it again!!! Please think twice! This matter...it is absolutely impossible! Even if Lord is willing, if Young Miss finds out, she will definitely....”

“Little Xie is far stronger than you think she is.” Jun Wu Yao smiled as a glint of maliciousness flashed by his eyes that initially had a hint of indulgence.

Ye Mei’s face was white as sheet, his shoulders trembled uncontrollably. Never had he felt such fear, no words could even come out.

“Ye Mei, you have to remember clearly what we’ve talked about today. Do not ever forget.” Although Jun Wu Yao’s gaze was not on him, but his words were clearly meant for him.

Sweat trickled down Ye Mei’s forehead, with furrowed brows and pained eyes, he could only reply with a choked and sombre tone: “Your...your subordinate obeys....”

These words were spoken with an incredible amount of restraint as he suppressed the overflowing emotions that wreaked havoc within him.
