Chapter 1889: “The Twelve Palaces’ Summit (3)”

Gu Xin Yan stiffened her lips and hesitated for a long while before she opened her mouth.

“Father is intending to hand Big Brother over to them?”

Gu Yi’s voice deepened as he said: “Do you think there is still a way to turn things around in this matter? The person who died is the Dragon Slayers Palace’s only Young Lord and even if they are still able to go on to elect a new successor, it wouldn’t be from the same bloodline of the current Dragon Slayers Palace Lord. With the Dragon Slayers Palace Lord still upon his seat, he is in control of the entire Dragon Slayers Palace and how could he not be aware that he would lose power in future? Zhuge Yin’s death had left him with no other way out and he would definitely set his sights fixed upon our Blood Fiend Palace. Although our Blood Fiend Palace’s might surpasses the Dragon Slayers Palace by a notch, but if the Dragon Slayers Palace goes against us with everything they have, the price we’ll have to pay will be difficult to bear. Even if we win, we will have sustained great losses and it will no longer be possible for us to compete with the Flame Demons Palace anymore.”

“But Zhuge Yin really wasn’t killed by Big Brother! I can be a witness to that! Father, Big Brother has bent his back and strove for the Blood Fiend Palace for so many years so you cannot do this.” Gu Xin Yan was naturally aware of Gu Yi’s concerns but she could not understand why her Father could be so cruel to her elder brother.

“It is not as if we are unable to take the Dragon Slayers Palace on, are we really going to hand Big Brother over just like this?”

“The price is too big to pay, and there is no need for that.” Gu Yi said as he shook his head.

Gu Xin Yan’s eyes widened slightly as she looked at Gu Yi in disbelief.

Because of their Young Lord’s death, the Dragon Slayers Palace could give everything they had but her Father had decided to hand his son over in order to avoid losses.....

One knew without even having to think that once Gu Ying was given over into their hands, just what kind of a terrifying result he would face. Vengeance for having killed one’s son would not allow the enemies to coexist but with Gu Ying similarly being his son, how could Gu Yi be so heartless?

Seeing the shock on Gu Xin Yan’s face, Gu Yi was startled and he immediately softened his tone of voice to say: “Little Yan, it’s not that your father is cold hearted, but for the sake of the Blood Fiend Palace’s future, I have no choice but to do this. The Flame Demons Palace had always been watching us like a hawk and if our strength took too big a beating, the Flame Demons Palace will definitely come after us to pursue victory and our situation will then be highly awkward for us.”

Gu Xin Yan lowered her gaze. No matter how Gu Yi explained it, she was still unable to accept his methods.

Sensing Gu Xin Yan’s resistance, Gu Yi sighed helplessly.

“The reason you are opposing it, is it because my words have greatly disappointed you?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Gu Xin Yan did not reply.

“Little Yan, I know that you have always been meticulous when carrying out your tasks but your heart’s too straightforward and righteous, and I can understand why you are unable to accept all this. You are thinking that Gu Ying as my son, your elder brother, and I am being too cruel by sending my flesh and blood right into the jaws of the tiger. But have you ever considered what if he is not your elder brother, and he’s also not my son but just another disciple in the Blood Fiend Palace?” Gu Yi said meaningfully as he looked at Gu Xin Yan.

Gu Xin Yan’s eyes widened slightly as she looked at Gu Yi in disbelief.

Gu Yi pointed at his own face.

“Look at me, and then look at yourself. Does Gu Ying look similar to you in anyway?”

“How did.....” Gu Xin Yan’s face was one of great shock.

“Little Yan, when I married Gu Ying’s mother, I had really loved her with my heart. But I had not thought that I will turn out to have been used so laughably. In the time that we were married, she had never allowed me to touch her once, and I had respected her wishes. Moreover, she was a princess of the Nine Temples, so I had naturally treated her with respect. But after several months, she gave birth to Gu Ying.”
