Chapter 2096: Face Slapping of the Ecstatic Rapture Palm (23)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Master! ! !” The Second Disciple cried out in surprise. All the human spirits were shocked by Jun Wu Xie’s action.

Jun Wu Xie had used a hundred percent of her power with that kick, which sent Wu Jiu flying high up into the air. If he were to fall down from that height, even if he did not die, he wouldn’t be too far off from it.

“Save the Spirit Master quick! !” The Second Disciple shouted at the top of his lungs, leading every single one of the human spirits to go speeding towards where Wu Jiu was hurtling to, their hearts set on catching Wu Jiu. Even Soul Slayer was stunned, never having expected that Jun Wu Xie’s actions would be so crude and brutal. In an instant, everyone else were frozen.

And it was at that moment that countless vines shot out from Jun Wu Xie’s Selvan’s Armour, sweeping past every Beast Spirit and Plant Spirit at the speed of lightning. Poison Ivy was working in cohesion with Jun Wu Xie, the two spirits controlling an innumerable number of vines that twirled around the bodies of all the Beast Spirits, Plant Spirits, and around Qiao Chu and the gang!

“Go!”

The instant Jun Wu Xie’s voice fell, the silver wings on her back flapped vigorously, widespread as she rose quickly into the air. Dragged along by Jun Wu Xie, all the Beast Spirits bound up by the vines were suddenly up in the air!

Poison Ivy wrapped several vines around Jun Wu Xie’s waist and the vines from his other hand pulled Nalan Shan and Brownie right up!

The powerful strength of the Face of Selvan manifested in full glory right at that moment as several hundred Beast Spirits were lifted up into the air!

In shock, Flame Dragon then used its great dragon tail to scoop up several Beast Spirits onto its back as it soared into the air following behind Jun Wu Xie!

“Look! They are escaping!” Soul Slayer suddenly snapped back to his senses. Seeing that Jun Wu Xie and the others were actually using vines to bring all the Beast Spirits out from there together with the Spiritual Bear, Soul Slayer’s mind immediately started to whirl loudly!

The Second Disciple could not be bothered with anything else and only wanted to catch Wu Jiu and get themselves out of there. But before Wu Jiu had even fallen to the ground, a vine then came flying out with a swoosh, to lash right around Wu Jiu at the waist, dragging him away!

All the human spirits on the ground were flummoxed. They stared with gaping mouths as they watched Jun Wu Xie ostentatiously fly past in the sky while dragging several hundred Beast Spirits with her, their eyes almost popping out of their heads.

It was at that moment that they all then realized that they had fallen into Jun Wu Xie’s ploy!

Jun Wu Xie had never intended to make a deal with them at all. Everything that she had done was merely to divert their attention, so that they would not discover her real intentions.

The Beast Spirits have escaped, and even Wu Jiu was taken. The Second Disciple immediately felt as if the sky was falling.

“Give chase! Do not let them escape!” The Second Disciple then shouted, highly nervous.

What was then seen, was a great big bunch of human spirits and Weapon Spirits running in a mad sprint with their heads lifted up towards the sky, while over their heads, a dense pack of Beast Spirits were gliding high up through the air.....

It was a rather grand sight to behold!

For Jun Wu Xie to be dragging so many Beast Spirits, it would not be the kind of weight that the silver wings of the Face of Selvan could truly be able to withstand. But candidly put, those Beast Spirits were spirits, and spirits weighed a whole lot less. Even though it was such a grand sight to see, in actuality, adding up the combined weight of all those spirits was not even equivalent to that of a young adolescent elephant.

After a spirit coalesced its body, it could alter its own weight at will and that was the reason why Jun Wu Xie dared to weave up such a scheme!

“This is just too cool!” Held by Poison Ivy and “gliding” through the air, Qiao Chu could not help but exclaim out in joy, the feeling was just too exhilarating! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Only Little Xie is capable of dreaming up such an idea.” Fei Yan said with a laugh, as he evilly waved at the bunch of fellas who were pursuing them doggedly on the ground.
