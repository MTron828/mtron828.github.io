Chapter 2447: The Cute Lord Jue (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The news of Jun Wu Xie’s marriage spread and caused many big waves. The news didn’t just spread, it spread like wildfire.

The soldiers who just finished the battle were resting when the news hit, creating chaos like a pot of porridge.

Isn’t this double happiness?

The celebration of matrimony followed after the victory of battle?

Happiness has arrived so suddenly!

The happiest was of course the groom-to-be, Jun Wu Yao. The smile on his face has not disappeared ever since the announcement from Jun Wu Xie. Even the members of the Night Regime could all feel the the vibrant joy of their master.

“Is Lord Jue getting married with Young Miss?” Ye Gu was seated on the stone bench in the yard, as he bit into an apple enthusiastically.

Ye Sha and Ye Mei stood aside with hints of smiles on their faces. This courtyard was originally meant to be their place of residence. They have not yet returned to the city where the Lin Palace was located. This place was just a temporary residence.

Logically speaking, Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie should stay in the same courtyard, but Jun Xian had requested very seriously for Jun Wu Yao to leave, and Jun Wu Yao could not reject that request. So it was with a tinge of regret that Jun Wu Yao had to stay in the same courtyard as with the Ye trio. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I guess so. Just not too sure about the date...” Ye Mei joined in the discussion.

Truth be told, given the characters of Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie, it wasn’t easy for them to reach the point of marriage!

It might be unclear to the bystanders, but to the three of them who were constantly around Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie, having seen their interaction countless of times before, they simply cannot bear to look. An obviously domineering Lord Jue, when standing in front of Young Miss, he became so... strange.

They were previously worried about when those two persons would take the next step. Little did they know, Young Miss was much more bolder than Lord Jue!

“So... What Young Miss did today was a marriage proposal? Shouldn’t it be the guy who proposes?” Ye Gu asked, slightly frowning. He was not a person whom Jun Wu Yao refined, he was a member of the Spirit Soul Race. He had lived in the “normal person” environment for more than ten years. As such, with regard to “normal people” behaviour, he could comprehend more.

Naturally, when compared to the Night Regime, those guys literally have zero common sense.

There was no questioning Jun Wu Yao’s abilities, or that of his Night Regime—the mere mention of them strikes fear. But when it came to common sense... it was appalling how none of them had any.

“Huh? It is like that?” Ye Mei looked at Ye Gu curiously. He came into being in the Ghost City and there was no such thing as marriages or “normal people things” in Ghost City.

“If I recall, it is like this, and also some sort of betrothal gift? A matchmaker? And some other nonsense. I can’t remember in detail.” Ye Gu said nonchalantly, his memories too far gone and was unable to remember much.

Ye Gu was not being clear while Ye Mei and Ye Sha did not understand. They did not realize that Jun Wu Yao was just a couple of steps behind them as they carried on their conversation.

“Proposing marriage, is done by the guy?” Jun Wu Yao questioned suddenly.

Upon hearing the sudden noise, Ye Gu and the rest, who were chatting happily/excitedly, stood up straight. The relaxation and idleness on their faces disappeared and they once again became the fearsome Night Regime generals.

“Lord Jue!” Ye Gu looked at Jun Wu Yao with a straight face, as if he was the one who was just gossiping!

“You were saying just now...” Jun Wu Yao frowned slightly.

Ye Gu was shocked, he was caught red-handed!
