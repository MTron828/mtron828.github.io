Chapter 2638: An Unexpected Incident (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

With the seed of the Spirit Tree being catalysed, Jun Wu Xie had noticed the change in her soul in these few days. The soul which was damaged when destroying the Soul Sacrificing Event was healing up really quickly, and during the healing process, Jun Wu Xie could clearly feel that her soul was gradually getting stronger and stronger. Once it was fully recovered, the strength of her soul would definitely surpass the previous condition of her soul!

Due to the little Spirit Tree in her soul, not only her soul had become stronger, even Drunk Lotus and the others had also turned more and more powerful because of the influence of the little Spirit Tree. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It didn’t need to take much thought to realize that the Spirit Tree of the Soul World was the one who had taken the responsibility for the souls of the Three Realms all by itself. Although the little Spirit Tree in Jun Wu Xie’s soul had just started to grow, the power it held could be easily approximated.

But, this was just the advantages brought by the little Spirit Tree that had just begun to grow. As time passed, the bigger the little Spirit Tree grew, the stronger the soul power it would emit.

Not to mention what kind of changes it would cause to Jun Wu Xie, the fact that those plant Ring Spirits that were staying inside Jun Wu Xie’s body were able to acquire the nourishment from the little Spirit Tree was already enough to let them scream in excitement!

While feeling glad about it, there was still an unsolved mystery that kept wandering in Jun Wu Xie’s mind. During this period of free time, Jun Wu Xie had taken the opportunity to ask the Spirit Tree and her question was related to Jun Gu...

At that time, the Spirit Tree had told her that her father was at the Soul Ascending Altar, and she too, had actually met him, but... the way they met each other wasn’t what she had once imagined.

Too many things had happened that day, and even Jun Wu Xie wasn’t able to figure everything out in detail at that moment, but now, as she thought about it again, she noticed a lot of things which she had been neglecting all the time.

Jun Gu was still alive, but he wasn’t staying in the Soul World as the way Jun Wu Xie expected, instead... He belonged to the Upper Realm!

Even until now, Jun Wu Xie could still recall the astonishment she felt when she first saw Jun Gu, and also the bewilderment Jun Gu showed when he saw her.

Jun Gu did not remember her. If it wasn’t for her who had stimulated Jun Gu’s memory, Jun Gu might not be able to recognize her at all, and after Yan Xi appeared, the reaction displayed by Jun Gu was just an utmost agony. To be said even more precisely, a few moments before Yan Xi showed up, Jun Gu was already slightly out of sorts.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t notice it before, but now it suddenly came to her mind, that the moment when Jun Gu showed his abnormality, she seemed to have smelled a scent.

To Jun Wu Xie, it wasn’t an unfamiliar smell.

It was the scent of a burnt Rhinoceros Horn.

Since ancient times, the Rhinoceros Horn was said to be a type of weird incense. There were countless myths and rumours about the Rhinoceros Horn, and what Jun Wu Xie had learnt about, was that the Rhinoceros Horn could make a certain impact on one’s memory and mind, and as the time of taking the scent increased, the effect it showed would also increase!

If she wasn’t wrong, every weird reactions shown by Jun Gu were all because of the Rhinoceros Horn!

But...

How would Jun Gu fall into the hands of the Upper Realm?

Wasn’t he supposed to be in the Soul World?

Only the Spirit Tree was able to answer the question.

“Looks like you’ve already met your father.” The vine of the Spirit Tree touched the centre part of Jun Wu Xie’s eyebrows. During these few days, due to the little Spirit Tree always staying beside it, the Spirit Tree got to recover a little bit of its power, causing it to be finally able to converse with Jun Wu Xie.

“My father... What has happened to him? Why is it that he...” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes.

“This is an incident which no one could have foreseen.” There was a trace of helplessness heard in the voice of the Spirit Tree.
