In the end... how strong was he really?!

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord looked at Jun Wu Yao as if he were a monster.

There was no element of surprise in Jun Wu Yao’s reaction, he simply looked down at his own hands as he clenched them and stretched them out.

“Mn, my current strength is only a tenth of what it was.”

“....” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord was so shocked that he was stunned in place like a block of wood.

Damn!!!

Only a tenth!!!!!

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord felt that if the person standing in front of him was not a monster, then was he a God?

He should be a God!! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even Jun Wu Xie was shocked silly by the words of Jun Wu Yao. The current Jun Wu Yao was already so strong, but according to him, it was only a tenth of what it was....

No wonder there was not even a ripple of wave that stirred up the Middle Realm, it was entirely suppressed by him! She believed that even in the Upper Realm, Jun Wu Yao was also going about and doing everything according to his own whims?

Unifying the Middle Realm should have been just done in jest...

No one could imagine how strong Jun Wu Yao was at his peak...

Ren Huang was the only one amongst them that knew about Jun Wu Yao’s past, with regards to the words of Jun Wu Yao, he did not deny and only nodded his head in agreement.

“Looks like the Lower Realm is really not somewhere the people from the Upper Realm can go to.”

“Not exactly, I was bound by the Soul Binding Chains, if not for those chains, I would not have been drained of so much spirit energy.” Jun Wu Yao shook his head slightly, in fact when he had been captured, he was seriously injured and his strength had drastically fallen to that of an ordinary level. Because of his injuries, he was left helpless in the Lower Realm.

After being rescued by Jun Wu Xie, strength had recovered by a little, but it was at a very slow rate.

“Do you think that everyone else is like you?” Ren Huang’s lips twitched, in the entire Upper Realm, the only person who could resist the environment of the Lower Realm would only be that person, or else the Lower Realm would have been in their plans from day one.

Jun Wu Yao shrugged.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes suddenly lit up.

“If we were to say that the Upper Realm does not dare to step into the Lower Realm, then wouldn’t it be the best choice for Grandmaster to go to the Lower Realm? Not only you, even the Spirit Jade Palace can also stay there temporarily.”

A trace of surprise flitted across Ren Huang’s face, Jun Wu Xie’s words seemed to have lit up a new road for him.

Since the Upper Realm had discovered his traces, even if he escaped again this time, as long as he remained in the Middle Realm, it was just a matter of time before he had to confront the people from the Upper Realm. After this painful lesson, the means of the Upper Realm would only become more cruel, escaping a second time was impossible.

Ren Huang was originally from the Upper Realm, however he had lived in the Middle Realm for a few thousand years. Hence, his body had already been acclimatized to the deficiency of the spirit qi in the environment. If he were to go to the Lower Realm, there wouldn’t be too big a reaction as his body had already been adapted. This plan was really feasible!

“That’s right, if we were to go to the Lower Realm, even if they wanted revenge, it would take some time to track us down. By the time they have discovered traces, they would not be able to reach their hands down so blatantly. In the Lower Realm, they do not have any subsidiary powers such as the Nine Temples.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord also voiced out.

“This is a brilliant idea, it’s just that... We know nothing about the the Lower Realm. If we were to just arbitrarily go over, I’m afraid that the Lower Realm’s side might not react well.” Ren Huang had some hesitations, after all he was not familiar with the Lower Realm, who knows what troubles may come.
