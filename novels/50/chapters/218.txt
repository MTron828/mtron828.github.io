Chapter 219: “Third Slap (1)”

Smoke filled the air outside of Lin Palace. A big group of the Rui Lin Army gathered in front of its gates, and facing them, were ten men from the Qing Yun Clan delegation.

“I say, let’s not waste time. Your weak attempt at resistance is futile, and I’ll advise you to hand over the Soul Jade peacefully and save yourself the pain and humiliation.” A disciple of the Qing Yun Clan turned his wrist around repeatedly, a pair of black half finger gloves covered his hands.

He looked towards the Rui Lin Army soldier whom he had flung to land before the Lin Palace’s gates with a single punch, contempt written across his face.

Behind him, there were three other disciples dressed in the Qing Yun Clan’s livery, and six others dressed in individually different attire who were obviously top exponents from allies of the Qing Yun Clan who accompanied them on this trip to Qi. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The terrified commoners huddled at the side. The chaos had been going on since yesterday when the Qing Yun Clan had suddenly attacked the Lin Palace. If the Rui Lin Army had not arrived in time, the Lin Palace might have fallen to these foreign intruders.

The Rui Lin Army soldiers who gathered in front of the Lin Palace had swelled, numbering in the hundreds, but the Rui Lin Army who had the advantage of numbers, were being systematically oppressed by the group from the Qing Yun Clan.

In just a short day, the Rui Lin Army wounded had gone beyond a hundred, while the Qing Yun Clan had suffered no losses.

At that moment, Jun Xian stood dark faced, surveying the chaos in front of him. They had crossed swords for a long period but only the four Qing Yun Clan disciples from the group had stepped up to fight. The other six had just watched from the sidelines.

The four who had fought, looked about thirty years of age, and they all had level green spirits and beyond.

Judging from quality of the exponents sent, it could be seen that the Qing Yun Clan had placed a rather high priority on retrieving the Soul Jade, as not a single one of them were easy pushovers.

“Father, let me do it.” He had been seated in the wheelchair, and kept up the pretense of being crippled. He could no longer hold down the anger boiling within. Throughout the day, he had been forced to witness soldiers from the Rui Lin Army, brothers in arms to him, wounded and oppressed by the people from the Qing Yun Clan. The knot that had twisted his insides had grown as he sat holding himself back, but now it threatened to explode in his rage.

The Qing Yun Clan was too much!

Jun Xian remained silent, his gaze on the men behind the Qing Yun Clan disciples.

Among the six, the youngest of them had lived beyond a half century, and a few of them looked older than Jun Xian himself. They had stood back, not because of their old age, but because the QIng Yun Clan’s disciples were able to handle the situation they faced and there was no need for their expertise.

Jun Xian was very certain, that among the six at the back, every single one of them was more than a match for him!

Jun Xian had a green leveled spirit, if he were to join forces with the Bone Corroding White Owl, they might be on equal standing with the disciples of the Qing Yun Clan, but.....

The other six, way outclassed Jun Qing by too much.

Jun Xian had held Jun Qing back all this time at a heart wrenching cost of his men in the Rui Lin Army as he had been very certain if he or Jun Qing had partaken in the fight, the other six men would not have stood idly by.

Based on his calculations, the weakest among them, must at least have achieved lower spectrum of the level blue spirit. And once the move, he expected the Lin Palace to fall!

“What? Still not giving up?” The man wearing the black gloves arrogantly raised his chin. His gloves were his contractual ring spirit. With the boost from his ring spirit, he could take down a male lion with a single punch. Ordinary soldiers would not be able to stand up to single punch of his!

“The tiny Lin Palace, should not have arrogantly gone against the Qing Yun Clan, if you persists on your folly, we will bring our wrath upon you.” After a long day’s worth of skirmishes, the disciples of the Qing Yun Clan were getting impatient.
