“Release her first.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Ling’er was stunned momentarily as she felt that this gentleman’s words were not quite right. Before she could think about it, the “Elder Luo” who tortured her for 500 years actually obeyed the gentleman and released her.

When her feet landed, Ling’er’s eyes widened unbelievably, looking at the eyes of “Elder Luo”, full of shock.

“From today onwards, you will be free, but I want to ask you to do me a favor.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Ling’er who was still in shock.

Ling’er absentmindedly looked at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie explained her intention.

Hua Yao disguised as Elder Luo. There was no difference in appearance or form. The only thing missing was the imitation of Elder Luo’s behavior and habits. This was something that Jun Wu Xie did not know as Elder Luo was usually alone. Among the Holy Land, only the elders in the tribe had some understanding about Elder Luo. However, it was impossible for Jun Wu Xie to capture Duan Qi.

Therefore, Ling’er would play a key role in this.

She was held captive by Elder Luo for a full five hundred years. During these five hundred years, she spent the day and night with Elder Luo. For the person she hated, Ling’er naturally knew Elder Luo’s habits better than anyone.

Ling’er had no fear after knowing that “Elder Luo” was Jun Wu Xie’s companion. Her hatred towards Elder Luo and the Sacred Maiden Tribe made her decide to help Jun Wu Xie.

Without anyone knowing, Elder Luo of the Sacred Maiden Tribe had been replaced by Hua Yao.

When night fell, Hua Yao replaced Elder Luo in the Holy Land while Jun Wu Xie took the sleeping Elder Luo and returned to her residence.

A cold sensation spread from Elder Luo’s whole body. She woke up slowly from drowsiness, and a little light imprinted in her eyes. Her brain was a little groggy, and the moment before she opened her eyes, everything was fuzzy. When she saw the scene in front of her, she was stunned!

The scene in front of her was no longer the Holy Land she was familiar with, but the side hall of the Sacred Maiden Tribe!!!

“Elder Luo had a good sleep?” A familiar voice sounded in Elder Luo’s ears.

Suddenly she raised her head and saw Han Zi Fei sitting at the side.

“Han Zi Fei! What do you want to do!” Elder Luo’s eyes widened in disbelief. She didn’t expect that she would fall into Han Zi Fei’s hands. She quickly scanned the room and found that “Lord Yan” was among them. In addition, there were two men with unique temperament in the room.

Anxiety suddenly shrouded Elder Luo’s heart.

“Han Zi Fei! Even though you are married, you are still a maiden from the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Don’t you know how sinful it is to hold the elders in private custody!” Elder Luo shouted in a bluff.

Han Zi Fei chuckled a little, watching the pretending calm Elder Luo and said: “You can rest your throat. There is no one here except us. Even if you shout out of the sky, no one knows you are here.”

“Furthermore, do you think I would care about sins? I dared to run away in the past. Now that I have captured you here, what else am I afraid of?” Han Zi Fei said in disdain.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
