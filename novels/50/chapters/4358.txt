Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

After a few days of the selection, the audience’s interest was beginning to wane. It was on the fourth day that the Spirit Ring bearers started competing and the selection started to get interesting.

The City Lords of the 72 Cities also started to appear and although they were not intending to be ranked, they hoped for an opportunity to show their prowess.

Dongfang Ku Bi was also in the crowd but his strength was not high. He came to the Sacred City purely to pass some time and soak in the atmosphere.

“Did City Lord Yan not come today?” Dongfang Ku Bi looked around the arena but did not see Jun Wu Xie present. This made him curious and he asked his guards.

In fact, Dongfang Ku Bi had seen Jun Wu Xie two days ago but before he could even go up to her, he saw Bai Zhu following closely behind her. When he saw that look of impatience on her face, he decided not to add to her troubles by going to speak with her.

But he never thought...

“No” The guard shook his head.

Dongfang Ku Bi had a pensive look on his face. In regular circumstances, Jun Wu Xie not turning up would have not been an issue but he had heard that the night before, the inn that Jun Wu Xie had been staying at was attacked and two of the attackers were members of the Top Ten exponents. The inn had been razed to the ground.

There was a lot of chatter regarding this in the Sacred City with everyone offering a different theory. Some suspected it had something to do with the newly appointed Overlord of the 72 Cities while others speculated it was nothing more than a disagreement between martial arts experts. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As to what actually happened, nobody had a clear picture.

“Is there any progress on what you were checking on?” Dongfang Ku Bi looked serious. He did not know why but he suspected the day before’s incident had something to do with Jun Wu Xie. After the fire, Jun Wu Xie seemed to have vanished. Dongfang Ku Bi wanted to ask if he could help with anything but did not have the chance.

“Your subordinate is useless, I really could not find anything.” The guard said with his head lowered.

Dongfang Ku Bi sighed deeply and furrowed both his eyebrows. He took another look at the arena, “Even Bai Zhu isn’t here today, could something really have happened? He has always been clinging onto the Overlord.”

Dongfang Ku Bi was very troubled and did not have any interest in watching the selection.

And today, Long Yao still sat stonily in the judge’s chair with a shadowy figure lurking behind him.

“Lord Long Yao, I have done what you asked. Although those people are not dead, they are very seriously injured. If you do this, you will surely anger Yan Hai.” The figure behind Long Yao was none other than the recently disappeared Bai Zhu. He had a respectful smile on his face and had several people standing behind him.

“Oh? How powerful are the people with Yan Hai that even the Top Ten exponents could not kill them? This is your report to me? It’s such a disappointment.” Long Yao said, disappointment dripping from his voice.

Five out of the Top Ten exponents were used in this operation, Long Yao’s intention was not to merely injure them!
