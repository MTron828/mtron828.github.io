Chapter 338: “Overpowered (1)”

Just as Qiao Chu and Hua Yao came back, they saw Qin Yue breathe his last. They were not in the least concerned about it though that man was the Sovereign of the mighty Qing Yun Clan. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“We’ve got it.” Hua Yao nodded to Jun Wu Xie.

“It is time to send everyone on their way. Mu Chen, it’s time to get your disciples off the mountain.” Jun Wu Xie turned to leave resolutely, and the rest of them followed after.

In the main hall, the members of the Qing Yun Clan were still too terrified to move. As they watched Jun Wu Xie leave, they wanted to heave a sigh of relief, but Jun Wu Xie’s words just before she left made them shiver uncontrollably.

Three massive beasts finished up the massacre within the main hall and the place was bathed in a bright shade of red. The bloodbath was seemingly used to cleanse this mighty clan of its sins and filth.

As they walked down the Blue Cloud Peak, the bodies of its disciples lay scattered all over, unmoving in death. Even till the last moment of their lives, they did not know what killed them.

The once bustling Cloudy Peaks, were now covered in a shroud of silence. Throughout the journey from the Blue Cloud Peak to the Cloud Treading Peak, Mu Chen did not see anyone still alive.

Jun Wu Xie had delivered on her promise. To annihilate all within the Qing Yun Clan!

“What do you have planned next?” Hua Yao asked, turning to Jun Wu Xie. The matter with the Qing Yun Clan had come to a close and from here on, the Qing Yun Clan ceased to exist anymore.

Jun Wu Xie pondered a moment as she surveyed the majestic peaks that had once housed the mighty Qing Yun Clan, and replied softly: “I want to make a trip home first.”

She had been away from home for a long time, and it was time she went back.

“We’ll go back with you then! Mu Chen said he needs to stay a while longer to sort things out with the disciples of the Outer House and the resident mercenaries, and will go to the Qi Kingdom in about two weeks to look for you. We’ll accompany you back, and after you have settled your own things, you can help us to refine the elixir.” Qiao Chu said excitedly. After hanging around Jun Xie for a time, he felt that Jun Xie was a good companion to have around.

Jun Xie was still so young, but the schemes that meticulous mind came up with astounded him completely.

Even when faced with the all powerful Qing Yun Clan, the enemy had crumbled and fallen into the depths of hell before that mind. Hanging around a little demon like that, made his days so much more exciting!

Jun Wu Xie looked at the enthusiastic Qiao Chu, and nodded after a moment’s thought.

This time, with Hua Yao’s and Qiao Chu’s help, she had achieved her objective to obliterate the Qing Yun Clan much more smoothly. Compared to her initial plan, she was able to shorten the process by two weeks.

As with any cooperation, they would have to keep to their word.

In Jun Wu Xie’s mind, she had recognised Hua Yao and Qiao Chu as her temporary allies in their cooperation. Little did she know, that this chance meeting that resulted in their first alliance, would bind their lives together for the rest of their lives.

The three of them made their way down the mountain, and left the tying up of loose ends to Mu Chen.

As the trio ambled down the mountain together, Qiao Chu was excited, and he chattered on non-stop, but Hua Yao and Jun Wu Xie remained silent.

Suddenly, when the trio reached the halfway point, two figures appeared at the summit of the Cloudy Peaks.

The two figures saw the peaks littered with bodies, and their eyes sparked in interest.

“What is wrong with the Qing Yun Clan? It had been just half a year and they have fallen to such a pitiful state?” The attractive looking man said with a laugh as he surveyed the scattered bodies, but his eyes flashed with a malicious chill.

The other man frowned. At that moment, the gem bracelet he wore on his wrist emitted a green glow and the man gasped.

“A plant ring spirit actually exists in the Lower Realm!!”
