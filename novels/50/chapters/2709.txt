Ye Sha led Zheng Weilong into the residence. Zheng Weilong walked slowly with her back upright. After reaching the hall, she raised her eyes and saw Jun Wu Xie sitting in the main seat of the hall.

Although it was evident that they were just engaged in battle, there was no emotional fluctuations on Jun Wu Xie’s face. She remained seated calmly, as if nothing had happened.

“Zheng Weilong pays respect to my Lord.” Zheng Weilong said politely.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly and looked at Zheng Weilong with his chin propped on one hand. Even before Ruan Zhongshan brought his soldiers to Sea Spirit City, the Night Regime was already monitoring Zheng Weilong and Ah Da till now. They had listened in on the conversation between Zheng Weilong and Ah Da, and had passed the information to Jun Wu Xie.

With these clues given by Jun Wu Xie alone, Zheng Weilong was able to analyze the situation close to the real thing, her intellectual capabilities was beyond comparison to a normal person’s.

Jun Wu Xie had someone check on Zheng Weilong’s identity and background which turned out to be very interesting.

A piece of ‘trash’ with no spiritual power, but with an ingenious heart. Maybe if she was used properly, she would be a great helper.

“What has brought Miss Zheng to my city?” Jun Wu Xie said lightly.

Zheng Weilong looked at Jun Wu Xie and wondered how she would broach the subject. Suddenly she chuckled: “My Lord, you don’t know why I have come to your city? The moment I wanted to enter Sea Spirit City with my subordinate, I’m sure your men have been keeping us under observation. Also, I’m sure that my Lord also knows of my conversation with Ah Da. Otherwise, how were we able to enter the city without any hindrance?”

Zheng Weilong’s words made Ah Da stunned!

Did Jun Wu Xie send someone to monitor their action early on?

Jun Wu Xie looked at Zheng Weilong, her cold eyes seemed to be judging the truthfulness of Zheng Weilong’s words, and she said a moment later: “The young lady of Discerning Moon City is really smart.”

Zheng Weilong smiled humbly and said, “It’s not that I am smart, but it is because my Lord didn’t hide anything. Otherwise, how can I sit here safely?”

Zheng Weilong didn’t realize that she was being monitored at first, but from the time she entered the Sea Spirit City and all the way to the official residence, even Ye Sha didn’t ask or announce her presence, and had let her see Jun Wu Xie almost immediately. The smooth-sailing process was not normal, especially since Jun Wu Xie had just ended a fierce battle; such relaxation of vigilance was abnormal. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In addition to all these that could only be arranged by Jun Wu Xie, Zheng Weilong could not think of any other reason.

Whether it was Zheng Weilong or Jun Wu Xie, they were extremely intelligent people who were rare in the world. Some things need not be said too clearly but they would already understand...

“What do you want?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly looked at Zheng Weilong.

“I want to be free.” Zheng Weilong raised her chin slightly. “I don’t want to be anyone’s pawn anymore. I want to control my own destiny.”

“Then what can you bring to the table?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows slightly. When talking to an intelligent person, there was an ease of mind.

“Everything in the 72 cities.” Zheng Weilong said, almost to herself.

“Oh? How?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“I am the Miss of Discerning Moon City. Even if I am inconspicuous, I still grew up in Discerning Moon City. Discerning Moon City is not in a low position among the 72 cities. My Lord wants to let everyone in 72 cities know about what had happened in Sea Spirit City today...”
