Chapter 2182: Bloody Battle at the Summit of Mount Fu Yao (6)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In the memory of all the Cloudy Brook Academy disciples, their headmaster, was someone who despised worldly conventions and had a smile on all day. He did not have the slightest presence that a headmaster should have, he was more like a child that never grew up.

But today, the headmaster who stood before them was the opposite of their memory!

Although his back was hunched, there was not a single smile on his face. Furious flames were burning in that gaze of his and the entire atmosphere around him was shocking to the extreme!

Was this the same headmaster of Cloudy Brook Academy?

That little old man who was like an old child who was idle and playful all day?

The image in their memory was far from reality, and everyone was stunned for a while.

Ba He looked at the little old man standing in front of him, and his cold lips raised into a smug smile.

“It seems that your disciple doesn’t know you either. She insists that you won’t come, but you still came.” Ba He glanced at the anxious Su Ya and looked at the little old man proudly.

The little old man narrowed his eyes as a dangerous atmosphere surrounded him, and when he saw Su Ya, his heart wrenched.

Su Ya was the first disciple he had ever received. During his lifetime, he only received two disciples. One was Su Ya and the other was Tian Ze. These two were abandoned orphans, but they were brought back and raised by him. From babbling young toddlers, they grew up to become a bright pair of beautiful woman and handsome man. It could be said that it Su Ya and Tian Ze were more like his daughter and son.

The daughter who was doted on and raised by his own hands was actually brutally tortured by Ba He. The smile that the little old man had on for a thousand years finally collapsed at this moment. The unprecedented anger had erased the smile off his mouth. He looked at Su Ya who was weakly shaking her head, she had been severely wounded that even shaking her head was such a tedious task for her and it could be seen how bad her actual condition was.

“Yeah, she doesn’t know enough about me, just like you.” The little old man’s lips curled into a sneer, and he looked at Ba He: “Do you know, what are the consequences of touching my disciple?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ba He scoffed and said: “The consequences? I don’t know what my consequences are but as for yours, I already do.” The moment his last word ended, he waved his right hand!

In a flash, nearly a thousand black robed men came out in a flash from behind the stone statue. In the blink of an eye, they surrounded the old man and blocked all escape paths.

The old man’s cold eyes swept over the group of black robed men around him, and there was a deep killing intent in his eyes.

“The consequence of yours is to be executed here, but I can give you another choice.” Ba He smiled coldly: “If you hand over the soul bone, I will let your disciple go, and you can atone for your crime of stealing the soul bones through death!”

“Stealing?” The old man suddenly laughed out loud and his laughter was full of ridicule. “The soul bone never belonged to your master. Your futile attempt to try to use the soul bone to fulfill the preposterous plan of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. It is simply a pipe dream! You can never find the whereabouts of the soul bone in your life!”

Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms!

The words of the little old man made the disciples of the Nine Temples shocked and stumped like wood. No matter how stupid they were, they would never misunderstand the words of the old man.

What in the world... was the purpose of this group of black robed men?
