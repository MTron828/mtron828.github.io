Chapter 3099 Killing A God 5

It was a shame that....

Even before they could rejoice in their sudden increase in strength, their power was extracted from their bodies as soon as it reached its peak!

One by one their powers came out of the bodies as beams of light and headed towards the temple.

In an instant their ecstacy turned to unbridled fear and they could only howl in fright as they tried to escape the light. But with their strength being continuously sucked out of their bodies, they could only rely on their legs to take them away as fast as they could run!

But they could not run nearly as fast as the light was expanding and in no time at all, the nightmare disguised as a golden dream had swallowed everyone in its path!

Bai Mo and Nangong Lie were still a distance away from the light but could hear the screams of pain coming from those who were inside it and sensed great danger. They both felt their powers heightened and decided at the same time to start escaping the Sacred City!

...

Inside the Holy Temple, Jun Wu Xie and the God of Destruction were locked in a fierce battle that shook the earth and made thunderous noises with each clash. The beautiful and ornate buildings in the temple could not withstand the force of the battle and were being turned into rubble.

Dust and ash were flying everywhere and in a short time, the once incomparably beautiful Holy Temple became a barren battlefield.

The hall was collapsing and the guards feared for their lives. In their panic, they forgot they had to control Han Zifei and Jun Gu. In order to save their lives, they untied Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu, and ran out of the hall as fast as they could.

Han Zifei and Jun Gu, who themselves did not have an easy route to freedom, were in no rush to escape. They quickly picked up Qiao Chu and the rest and managed to get them out of the hall just as the entire hall collapsed!

However, nobody cared about the badly injured Feng Ming. He could only sit in the hall and hopelessly look up at it collapsing onto him with.

With a loud crash, the hall turned into a pile of rubble and buried the filthy soul of Feng Ming within it.

When Han Zi Fei and the rest walked out of the hall, they were shocked by the scene that awaited them.

After the golden light passed through it, the once prosperous city was no more and looked like a wasteland. The people who had come out of their houses were now corpses on the ground, their faces frozen in agony as their power was ripped out of their bodies and absorbed by the golden light.

“What is that?” Jun Gu asked while supporting Fan Zhuo and Qiao Chu in each arm as he looked at the carnage and destruction in front of him.
