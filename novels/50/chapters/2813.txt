Chapter 2814: Holy Mountain (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

After Han Shu reported, she secretly observed the closed carriage.

From the Sea Spirit City to the Holy Mountain, the journey took almost half a month. In order to reach the Holy Mountain as soon as possible, they hardly made any stops along the way. They slept in the carriage at night and continued on their journey. Fortunately, Sea Spirit City had arranged extremely spacious and comfortable carriages that didn’t toss them around too much. Even though it was comfortable, it was still a torturing journey for maidens such as Han Shu who was weaker in spirit energy.

The soreness on her body could no longer be described. What made Han Shu feel like vomiting blood was that she had made all preparations before departure and she had no chance to win over the City Lord of Sea Spirit City. Rushing throughout the journey, there was no chance to get near Jun Wu Xie. She only saw her a few times.

Every time Han Shu saw Jun Wu Xie’s figure, Jun Wu Xie returned to the carriage before she had time to take action. Han Shu was annoyed and angered.

Han Shu was beautiful. Although she was not a saint, she was also a half-sister to the third saint and often follows Duan Qi when she went out. It could be said that with her looks and her identity of the holy maiden, no matter where Han Shu went, she was the focus of much attention. A large number of men would rush to please her.

Even in the White Night City, Bai Zhu spoke to her politely. But Jun Wu Xie had tore down Han Shu’s confidence.

After seeing Jun Wu Xie for the first time, it seemed that Jun Wu Xie hadn’t looked at her even once. This made Han Shu very frustrated.

Because of the relationship between Bai Zhu and Han Shu previously, she was too lazy to talk with Jun Wu Xie. But now, Duan Qi tempted Han Shu with such an offer and it was up to Han Shu to achieve it. In the end....

Han Shu glared at the carriage that hadn’t responded for a long time, and there was gloom in her eyes.

A moment later, a slightly indifferent voice came from the carriage.

“Got it.”

Subsequently, the carriage door was opened. Jun Wu Xie, dressed in a goose yellow robes, slowly walked down from the carriage. As she landed on the ground, her eyes naturally passed over and stood in front of her, trying to maintain a sweet smile. Han Shu looked at the tall peak in front of her.

“This is the Holy Mountain?” Qiao Chu and others also got out of the carriage, looking at the majestic peak before them that hid into the clouds.

The Sacred Maiden Tribe was different from the entire Upper Realm. Each maiden was very valuable to the tribe. In addition, they had already abandoned spirit energy cultivation. Therefore, every baby girl born in the Sacred Maiden Tribe did not have to experience the suffering of the stimulating spirit energy.

In certain sense, it could be considered a blessing. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Why are these soldiers here?” Fan Zhuo’s eyes fell on the elite soldiers at the foot of the mountain.

“These are the warriors sent by His Lord to guard the maidens.” Duan Qi said, her slightly raised chin and clear tone were all showing her pride.

Seeing Duan Qi’s appearance, Qiao Chu could not help but purse his lips.

In addition to being polite to Little Xie, this old wicked woman was so hateful that he couldn’t wait to use his chin to face her and send her arrogance flying!

Jun Wu Xie stood at the foot of the Holy Mountain and looked at the majestic peak in the clouds, but in her heart, her mood had already turned sombre and serious.
