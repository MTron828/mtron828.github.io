Jun Wu Xie looked at Duan Qi, sneering in her heart. Her tone remained flat: “Oh? Marrying a maiden from The Sacred Maiden Tribe?”

Duan Qi nodded and said, “Yes, my maiden only invited the top exponents of the Upper Realm. It’s His Lord’s promise. In order to protect the stability of the Upper Realm, I would like to inform Lord Yan that most of the pure saints are matched with the most powerful people in the Upper Realm. The first and second saints are assigned to His Lord. Now the third saint is given to The Knight of Destruction. My intention to Sea Spirit City is to make peace with the 72 Cities. The other is to find a suitable partner for another maiden of our tribe. ”

“Now, looking at the Upper Realm, there is no other capable person like Lord Yan. I can assure you that as long as you agree, Lord Yan can freely use the holy place on the Holy Mountain to cultivate, and that holy place is our forbidden land. The forbidden area of ​​the tribe can only be cultivated in that place by the elders and sages. Although the holy place cannot improve spiritual power, it is unique for the improvement of spiritual power. Lord Yan’s strength is already at its peak and the improvement of psychic force is one of the top powers that many yearn for. Our clan only asks for a baby girl born in the future, if it is a baby boy, Lord Yan can take him. We will never interfere.” Duan Qi looked at Jun Wu Xie astutely. In fact, she concealed some of the conditions, such as the first three saints. Although she has been assigned to others, no matter whether there are boys or girls left, the saints have no right to intervene. But about Jun Wu Xie, Duan Qi wanted to hide it.

They need a new saint too much.

Jun Wu Xie calmly listened to Duan Qi’s words. When Duan Qi mentioned The Knight of Destruction and the third saint, it’s no doubt the person is Han Zi Fei!

Even though her heart was desperate for an answer, Jun Wu Xie still looked indifferent as if she did not have much interest.But she casually asked: “Oh? Allowed with a Knight of Destruction? I wonder who that knight is? ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Duan Qi didn’t ponder and replied, “Of course it’s the youngest, Lord Jun Gu.”

Jun Wu Xie’s heart suddenly skipped a beat!

It was really her father!!

However, Duan Qi did not notice the shock flashing through Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. She continued rambling on by herself: “The following sentence is true, and after one month, Lord Jun Gu and my saint will marry on the Holy Mountain. If Lord Yan is keen, why don’t you follow us back and attend the ceremony? Lord Jun Gu is amiable and gentle, if he meets a talented person like Lord Yan, I believe he will praise you in front of His Lord as he likes talents.”

Jun Wu Xie forcibly suppressed the shock in her heart, but she calmed down quickly. She looked at Duan Qi who had thrown a bait a little, although there was a chill in her eyes, but she quickly covered it up.

“Oh? Aunt Duan is kind.”

“Contacting a strong man like Lord Yan is naturally good for making new friends. Lord Yan doesn’t need to respond immediately. Think about it for a few days.” Duan Qi pretended to be casual, she saw that Jun Wu Xie’s did not show much interest. But she had a lot of interest in Jun Gu. She only thought that Jun Wu Xie wanted to climb up.

Jun Wu Xie said, “Since Aunt Duan has graciously invited, then I should attend.”
