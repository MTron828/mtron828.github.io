The several Beast Spirits fell silent. Obviously, they were not able to refute Jun Wu Xie’s words properly.

They had stood against Wu Jiu before and they naturally knew how maniacally cruel a person he was. They knew very well that Jun Wu Xie was definitely not exaggerating her words to cower them and that Wu Jiu was clearly capable of such deeds or to be even more cruel.

Nalan Shan fell back into his chair utterly distressed, the helplessness and defeat almost burying him.

He could not let the previous Spirit Master down, nor could he ignore Brownie and Wu Jiu’s venomous cruelty was forcing him into a corner where both choices were equally hard for him.

Brownie let out a whimper and finally released the paws it had around Jun Wu Xie’s leg to shift itself slowly to go to Nalan Shan’s side. It then embraced Nalan Shan into its broad and solid chest as it made a series of soft cries, seemingly trying to appease Nalan Shan’s emotions that were going out of control.

Fan Zhuo and the others who were watching from the side found it hard to continue to watch the scene and Qiao Chu then moved himself soundlessly to go beside Jun Wu Xie to tug at a corner of her clothes, his face tearlessly mournful.

“Little Xie, if you have a way out of this then tell it to them straight. Seeing them like this is just too agonizing to watch.”

If this had happened to them where they were made to choose between Yan Bu Gui and their own Ring Spirits, they would definitely go mad.

Although Brownie was not Nalan Shan’s Ring Spirit, but Nalan Shan had long treated Brownie as a close companion of his.

The flesh on the palm and on the back of one’s hand was flesh just the same and it was little wonder why Nalan Shan was feeling so conflicted.

Jun Wu Xie blew out a breath and opened her mouth to say: “If all of you trust me, then just do as what I say. I will not let you fall to harm. I will let you, Brownie, and the previous Spirit Master to come out safely from this calamity.”

Nalan Shan raised his head up from the utter dismay he was in, to stare at Jun Wu Xie with eyes filled with eager anticipation.

“Three days later, bring Brownie together with you.” Jun Wu Xie then said.

“You cannot!” The several Beast Spirits at the side immediately jumped up in protest.

Qiao Chu immediately delivered a sharp rap onto the head of the cheetah and exclaimed in infuriation: “Hear the whole thing out before you protest!”

Having suffered a rap from Qiao Chu’s fist on its head, the cheetah looked at Qiao Chu in aggrievement. This human spirit would completely not be a match for it in the past but just the aura upon the lad’s body now already made it understand that if it was to raise a paw against him, it would only suffer a hapless thrashing.

“You feel that it’s dangerous because you think that once Brownie goes there, it would be surrounded and attacked. But you have instead forgotten Brownie’s identity. Brownie is the Spiritual Bear, an irreplaceable spiritual leader among the Beast Spirits. Could the Beast Spirits possibly just stand there and watch with their own eyes their very own Spiritual Bear being taken away?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“Although what you have said is correct, but as the Spiritual Bear is so frail and weak now, it is unable to show its power as the Spiritual Bear and the Beast Spirits would then not know its real identity. Even if we were to tell them, they would not believe us.” The cheetah meant to jump to its feet but before Qiao Chu’s fist that was held up threateningly, it laid itself on the ground as it muttered.

Jun Wu Xie then countered: “What if I have a way that will allow Brownie to restore some of its powers?”

The cheetah’s eyes then lit up slightly. The biggest problem they were facing was that Brownie was not able to show its powers as a the Spiritual Bear and had no way of getting help from the Beast Spirits.

Nalan Shan had also raised his head up in surprise, to look highly expectantly at Jun Wu Xie.

“You know of a way to let Brownie recover?” This was something that Nalan Shan had been pondering about for a long time. He had tried many ways with the cheetah and the others to let Brownie recover its powers but to completely no avail. Although Brownie had recovered a little, but it was not nearly enough to restore its power to like it was before, unable for it to show the Spiritual Bear’s powers. Half a year’s time to a spirit was afterall just too short a period and it was not sufficient to bring about a change of any import.
