“You ... Are you kidding me? Lord Yan is very formidable. But ... is it possible to kill tens of thousands of people in one second...? How is this possible, are you dazzled?” Dongfang Ku Bi’s expression was stiff and unacceptable.

What Ah Da said to him was just a big lie. And he was not foolish enough to believe it. He could tell it at one glance.

Kill tens of thousands with one stance?

What a joke, even the Top Ten Experts could never do this.

Zheng Weilong frowned slightly. She looked at Ah Da seriously: “Ah Da, what is going on? I know you won’t be kidding at this time. But what you have said was hard to believe.”

Ah Da looked at Dongfang Ku Bi, who didn’t believe it. Zheng Weilong nervously said, “There is always a possibility that it could happen. I’m telling the truth. Because Lord Yan is not an ordinary person at all. . ”

“Ah? Is he a monster?” Dongfang Ku Bi found it very profound.

“He’s not a monster, but an evildoer.” Ah Da narrowed his eyes that he couldn’t fade away the scene he just saw.

“He is a Dual Spirit Ring wielder. Like the Lord, he has the Dual Spirit Ring!”

“What!!!!” Dongfang Ku Bi looked pale and had on a terrified expression.

Zheng Weilong stumbled as she held onto the chair’s handle to stabilize herself. But her eyes were staring big and looking at Ah Da incredibly.

“Dual ... Dual Spirit Ring? Ah Da, are you sure you saw that right?” Zheng Weilong felt that her voice was shaking uncontrollably.

Ah Da nodded silently.

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed it all. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The first appearance of the Dual Spirit Ring previously had buried tens of thousands of enemies. Such memories, he will never forget in this life!

Dongfang Ku Bi took two steps backwards and sat on a chair with his buttocks. His raining sweat soaked his clothes.

There was silence in the hall. Dongfang Ku Bi and other people went into a huge silence.

Dual Spirit Ring?

Dual Spirit Ring!

Isn’t this really a joke!

“Ha ... ha ha ha ... ha ha ha ha ha ha ...” All of a sudden, Dongfang Ku Bi laughed. He turned back and smiled and he reached out his hands to cover his face.

The laughter was so loud that it shattered the shock and lifelessness in Zheng Weilong’s heart.

“Haha, my God ... 72 cities have fallen ... Really fallen... Dual Spirit Ring? Ah ha ha ha, Dual Spirit Ring! How do they fight? How do they fight? No wonder they are trying to run away. Now, let alone their two million troops, even if they invited the Top Ten Experts, I’m afraid that Lord Yan alone could kill them! “Dongfang Ku Bi laughed and his tears flowed. At this moment he understood why Jun Wu Xie was previously calm. Because from the beginning, Jun Wu Xie had looked down on the million bold warriors!

The 72 cities were defeated without any suspense, not even the courage to battle.

I’m afraid it won’t take long, Bai Zhu and others will be scared off in their respective cities and hide in the duvets, and dare not go out?

Zheng Weilong breathed a long sigh of relief.

Also at this moment, Jun Wu Xie and the others returned to the City Lord’s mansion. Zheng Weilong immediately stood up from the chair when he saw Jun Wu Xie. He looked at Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. It was no longer an admiration, but a kind of fanatical worship.

This was the power that really controls everything!
