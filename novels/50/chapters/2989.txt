Chapter 2990 Strange Ying 3

The tiny doll stiffly climbed up from the ground, dragging his long clothes, and stood at Su Ruiying’s feet with his head lowered and remained motionless.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the scene before her with surprise. It was just before that moment when the figure moved, she seemed to feel a breath of humanity.

But...

How can that be?

Su Ruiying looked at Jun Wu Xie’s surprise. Her bloody mouth twitched with pride. She supported her chin with one hand, raised a hand, and twirled her finger in a large circle above the little puppet. It was as if there was something pulling it as it followed and spun around.

The breath that had just disappeared appeared again at this moment.

“These little toys, I have done these during my spare time.” Su Ruiying’s gaze moved to the other puppets on the table, and her long nails crossed the heads of those puppets. “In the Upper Realm, no matter if they’re strong or they are lacking in their abilities, there’s one thing in common. They are so beautiful, like the eccentricity of God, each of them were born so beautiful and it makes people fond of their appearance with one look.”

Su Ruiying’s gaze and finger swept over the puppets. A strange breath, along with her movements, surfaced and spread throughout the hall.

Maybe it was an illusion. Jun Wu Xie found that the puppets that had been in the range of her finger sweep by Su Ruiying seemed to be trembling.

“Lady Ying.” At this moment, the low voice sounded again. A man wearing a black robe and a ghoul mask appeared at the entrance of the hall with a tray in his hand.

“Tea has been brewed.” He said respectfully.

“Leave it there.” Su Ruiying slightly lifted her chin.

The ghoul masked man stepped forward, lowered his head and served the tea. When he was serving it to Jun Wu Xie, a cold glint flashed by her eyes. There was also an inexplicable cold glint that flashed by Jun Wu Yao’s eyes.

“Just drink some casually, I don’t usually have guests here. It’s rare that there are guests today.” Su Ruiying took a cup of tea and drank herself. Those puppets stood still on the table. The ghoul masked man took the puppet up and wiped the dust with his cuffs, and put it back in its original position. He then retreated from the hall.

“Yan Hai, if you want to become a Knight of Destruction, there are still a lot of hard experiences that you need to go through. Anyway, in the future, you will have to come over quite frequently so I think it’s better to stay with me for a few days. This will save you from running around. “Su Ruiying said with a smile, but her eyes swept over Jun Wu Yao’s body. Her movement was very fast, making it impossible for people to notice.

“Alright.” Jun Wu Xie would not refuse naturally. Su Ruiying was too strange and by staying here, it would be more convenient for her to investigate the situation. Especially ... The tempering session which Jun Wu Xie suspected was related to what Jun Gu had lost. It’s just that during the tempering session, his memory was likely to be affected by the rhinoceros horn and he couldn’t remember anything afterwards.

Su Ruiying was very satisfied with Jun Wu Xie’s reply and immediately found the ghoul masked man to arrange for Jun Wu Xie’s residence. She said that she was a little tired, and went back to rest first at the temporary residence.
