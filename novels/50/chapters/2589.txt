Chapter 2590: Plot Twist (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Meng Qiu who had collapsed on the ground couldn’t even make a sound, let alone getting up.

It was so painful all over his body, as if it was going to shred apart anytime. He could only lie feebly on the ground with his eyes big widening.

This was the gap between him and Jun Wu Yao.

Even the First Spirit Envoy of the Soul World seemed to be so weak in front of Jun Wu Yao, not even able to withstand a single blow. It was as if the incident that had happened thousands of years ago had once again reoccurred. However, Meng Qiu had now been labeled as a traitor, he was no longer fighting for the Spirit Tree.

“I’ll leave him to you.” Jun Wu Yao strode back and turned his head, looking at Blood Velvet.

Blood Velvet smiled exceedingly brightly as he walked near Meng Qiu who was lying limply on the ground. While grinning, he squatted down and looked at Meng Qiu who was unable to move.

“Hi, I’m Blood Velvet, nice to meet you.” Blood Velvet gave out an extremely dazzling smile, just like the handsome teenage boy from the neighbourhood. His head of red hair looked particularly striking under the sunlight.

“What... What do you want to do...” Eyes widening, Meng Qiu stared at Blood Velvet. There were also a lot of plant soul entities living in the Soul World, but those soul entities were behaving really quiet ever since they were born. They were planted all around the places in the Soul World, and they seldom turned themselves into the shape of a human and moved around.

“Nothing. I’m just following the instructions given by Lord Jue to remove the Contemporaneous Knot from your soul,” said Blood Velvet, giggling.

“Wh-... What...” Staring incredulously at Blood Velvet, Meng Qiu simply couldn’t believe his ears!

Remove the Contemporaneous Knot? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ye Jue really wanted to remove the Contemporaneous Knot?

Wasn’t he going to destroy the Spirit Tree?

At this moment, Meng Qiu had finally come to a realization that his constant ego had completely gotten him into a big, big trouble!

He shouldn’t be assuming that Jun Wu Yao would really leave the fate of the Spirit Tree aside.

“You want to save the Spirit Tree... but you’re actually hurting me?” Meng Qiu felt so painful that he couldn’t even move his body. All he could do was just moving the pupils in his eyes and looked at Jun Wu Yao with an appalling gaze.

He and the Spirit Tree had already been synced together by the Contemporaneous Knot, but Jun Wu Yao had still given him such a sharp blow!

For information purposes, any injuries that existed on his body would be aggregated ten times worse on the Spirit Tree. Jun Wu Yao’s assault had nearly taken half of Meng Qiu’s life, in that way, the damage it brought to the Spirit Tree would be worse!

However, Jun Wu Yao didn’t even cast a glance at him but just wrapping his arm around Jun Wu Xie.

Slap!

Blood Velvet straight away gave Meng Qiu a slap, causing Meng Qiu to be dumbfounded at the moment.

“I’m saying hello to you, do you know that it is very rude of you to not look at me?” Still keeping the smile on his face, there was a tenebrous gaze coming out from Blood Velvet’s scarlet eyes, making one’s hair stand on end.

“You!” Even in his dream, Meng Qiu couldn’t have thought that he would actually receive a slap from a plant spirit!

“Though I did say that you’re dumb, but you’re actually really dumb. My Master had earlier told me to bury the seed of the Blood Velvet into your body. Although it can’t remove the Contemporaneous Knot, my seed is still able to block off the connection of the knot, and so...” Blood Velvet rolled his sleeves up, exposing his pair of fair and pretty hands in the air. Just at the moment when Meng Qiu’s fear soar up all of a sudden, both his hands turned into numerous thin roots and they then pierced vigorously into Meng Qiu’s chest.

“There’s no need for you to worry about the Spirit Tree being affected at all. Even if you are beaten to death, the Spirit Tree will still be fine.”

The roots of Blood Velvet pierced into Meng Qiu’s soul, resonating with the seed in his body. At the instant, there came an acute pain, almost blowing apart the soul of Meng Qiu!
