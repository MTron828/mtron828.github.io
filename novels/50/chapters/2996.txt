Chapter 2997 A Shocking News 3

Fortunately, Little Ruo’s soul was still present. As long as the soul existed, she could still live. Even on the Reincarnation Path, they could still find her!

“He’s very tired.” Jun Wu Yao looked at the puppet and out of the corner of his eye could see Jun Wu Xie’s complicated expression. He raised his hand, pricked his finger and dabbed a drop of his blood on the puppet’s forehead.

The exhausted puppet seemed to have received a fresh lease of life as its spiritual energy received a boost and its eyes appeared brighter.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao in amazement, Jun Wu Yao said, “My blood can give spiritual energy a boost. Don’t worry, it’s just a physical effect and won’t make him subservient to me.

Jun Wu Yao’s blood had a great many uses but other than using it to build the NIght Regime and Ghost Army, he hardly used it. Although Jun Wu XIe knew that Jun Wu Yao’s blood could greatly improve the strength of Qiao Chu and the others, she had not suggested it.

Although they yearned for strength, they did not want to lose themselves. The Night Regime was created by Jun Wu Yao but they were not and thus, did not choose that path.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. Jun Wu Yao always knew when she needed any kind of help, this unspoken understanding between the two would never disappear.

To love a person was not to be stubborn and insisted on what you thought was best. Thinking about and giving what the other person really needed was the way to truly love.

This was both a form of respect and a mark of trust.

“LIttle Ruo, you must have many things to say to me right?” Jun Wu Xie said Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The puppet nodded its head.

Jun Wu Xie sighed, she guessed that the puppets made by Su Rui Ying could not talk. Jun Wu Xie took as apparatus for Spirit Reinforcement out of the Cosmos Sack and gently wrote a series of incantations on Rong Ruo’s body.

This sort of Spirit Reinforcement could let a soul’s voice be heard. Jun W Xie had never found much use for it in the past but it was proving to be extremely useful.

After the Spirit Reinforcement was complete, the previously silent puppet made its first sound.

It was a hoarse yet gentle male voice.

“Little Xie, I never imagined you would see me like this.”

The unfamiliar voice had such a familiar tone to it. It really surprised Jun Wu Xie.

“Little Ruo, you are....” Jun Wu Xie had suspicion in her voice.

Why did Rong Ruo have a male voice? Furthermore, Jun Wu Xie had previously noticed that the puppet had a male body, which was why Jun Wu Xie did not think of Rong Ruo when she first saw it.

Puppet Rong Ruo laughed bitterly, and with the help of Spirit Reinforcement, let Jun Wu Xie in on a secret previously unknown to any human.....
