Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Han Shu exhausted her efforts as she wanted to be the most beautiful person today, but with the appearance of Han Zi Fei, it had obscured the spotlight on her.

In the presence of Han Zi Fei, Han Shu’s countenance was that of a withered flower, she was no longer breathtaking.

The moment Duan Qi saw Han Zi Fei, she involuntarily frowned. She had no opinion with regards to the appearance of Han Zi Fei, but she was informed that this was a welcome banquet, and yet she attended wearing a black dress. Although it looked beautiful, it was not appropriate for today’s occasion. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However ...

Duan Qi secretly glanced at Jun Wu Xie and found that Jun Wu Xie turned her face slightly, as if looking at Han Zi Fei.

“What? Do you not recognise me?” Han Zi Fei smiled nonchalantly, her long sleeves fluttered slightly as the evening breeze blew, causing the candles to flicker in the hall.

The candlelight flickered, but it dazzled the human eye and shocked the mind.

All the women in the hall stood up and saluted Han Zi Fei in unison: “I pay my respects to the Sacred Maiden.”

The corner of Han Zi Fei’s lips kicked up into a smirk as she waved her hand casually.

“Elder Yun, I wonder if I’m late?” Han Zi Fei’s eyes shifted slightly to look at Elder Yun sitting in her chair.

Elder Yun said with a smile, “Your timing is just nice. The Sacred Maiden has been busy with wedding matters in recent days. It’s been hard on you. Please sit down first.” Elder Yun’s reply was ingenious. In terms of time, Han Zi Fei was a little late. However, Elder Yun did not intend to slap the Sacred Maiden in her face in front of outsiders, naturally she had to find something to gloss over.

Han Zi Fei sat down in her seat casually, and glanced around the hall while everyone was seated. Only Han Shu remained standing stiffly in front of a table. In that position, Han Shu was blocking the person behind her from full view. Han Zi Fei could only glimpse a petite figure, but could not see the actual appearance.

“I heard that there are esteemed in the tribe. Naturally, I wanted to come join in the festivities.” Han Zi Fei said with a light smile.

Elder Yun secretly breathed a sigh of relief. She was very afraid of the mess Han Zi Fei might have caused in today’s occasion.

Duan Qi still frowned, looking somber.

Han Zi Fei looked at Han Shu who stood stiffly rooted to the ground and she raised her eyebrows slightly. The smile upon her lips grew larger.

“Han Shu, why are you just standing there? Unless the esteemed guest is so precious to you that you can’t let others take a look?”

Han Shu was stunned by Han Zi Fei’s words and stared fiercely at Han Zi Fei.

Elder Yun said: “How can it be? Han Shu had some misunderstandings with City Lord Yan previously, that’s all. Han Shu, you have drank the wine, you should go back to your seat. I don’t think City Lord Yan will argue with a young lady like you. It was just a misunderstanding.”

“City Lord Yan?” Han Zi Fei froze slightly as a subtle feeling suddenly rose in her heart.

Elder Yun smiled and said, “Yes, this esteemed guest is incredible. He was once one of the lords in the 72 cites. But now, he has unified the 72 cities under his leadership. Han Shu, please go back to your seat and let the Sacred Maiden meet City Lord Yan. ”

Han Shu pursed her lips, nodded slightly, and reluctantly moved away.

The moment Han Shu moved away, Han Zi Fei’s eyes stared unblinkingly at Han Shu’s back. The ‘City Lord Yan’ mentioned by Elder Yun had somehow made her think of someone.

And when the man behind Han Shu revealed to Han Zi Fei, the smile on Han Zi Fei’s face froze in an instant!
