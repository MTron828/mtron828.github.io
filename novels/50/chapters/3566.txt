Tian Ze had said it before. These people were trying to capture the little old man to force him to hand over a precious artifact, and that artifact had something to do with the Blood Sacrifice Array.

The Blood Sacrifice Array was a plot by the Upper Realm. The Nine Temples had always been respectful to Mount Fu Yao before and had never shown the slightest disrespect. But they have suddenly struck..... This did not seem like the way the Nine Temples would act.

“Does Little Xie mean to say that upon Mount Fu Yao now, there are people from the Upper Realm hidden currently?” Jun Wu Yao asked, his brow slightly arched up as a glint of murder flashed in his eyes.

Jun Wu Xie then said: “I cannot be certain. It is just my guess.”

But looking at the the current circumstances, it was highly possible the situation was as she had thought. If this was truly the Upper Realm’s doing, then it was obvious that inside the loft that Ye Mei did not dare to go into would be hiding powerful people from the Upper Realm, and that was why the Nine Temple Lords had not come.

But there was another thought that Jun Wu Xie had in her heart. She beckoned with her hand for Ye Mei to come forward, and she then whispered a few sentences in his ear. Ye Mei immediately nodded his head and disappeared from his spot. But in a blink, Ye Mei came back. Upon his return, he held a set of clothes embroidered with a wolf emblem in his hands.

Jun Wu Xie took the clothes and changed into them under Jun Wu Yao’s cover. She altered her looks and looking at Jun Wu Xie wearing the Heavenly Wolf Temple’s uniform, she had changed herself into a unremarkable looking youth.

“There’s still three more days’ time and I need to check whether there is any other thing that is strange here on Mount Fu Yao.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and said. If this was in the past, she might not dare to infiltrate herself among the Nine Temples’ forces as the Nine Temples were afterall not like the Twelve Palaces. Powerful pugilists were abundant among them and just the number of Silver Spirits were terrifyingly many. But now, Jun Wu Xie’s powers was already about to breakthrough to the Gold Spirit and as long as they were people with powers below that of the Gold Spirit, they would not be able to detect her true level of strength.

For the Nine Temples to choose to be subservient to the Upper Realm, it was something that should not surprise anyone. But if that was truly the case, then why had the Nine Temple Lords shut themselves in? Wouldn’t this be a great opportunity for them to show their loyalty to the Upper Realm?

A vague guess swirled in Jun Wu Xie’s head which made Jun Wu Xie feel she really needed to get a clear picture of the situation on Mount Fu Yao.

“If you want to check things out further, just go ahead and do it. I’ll just stand back and protect you.” Jun Wu Yao said with a smile as his finger hooked up a lock of Jun Wu Xie’s dark hair and toyed with it at the end of his fingertips. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

With Jun Wu Yao’s powers, even Gold Spirits could not possibly be able to detect his presence, and there was no need for him to change his looks.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. It was the final three days, she had to keep a tight grasp on them!

The sky gradually turned dark and Mount Fu Yao was enveloped by night. Changed into the Heavenly Wolf Temple’s uniform, Jun Wu Xie already petite figure that was concealed by the darkness of night slipped silently through the mountains. With her current level of power, not a single one of the patrolling soldiers detected a thing.

From mid mountain to the peak, it took just a few moments. The night shrouded Mount Fu Yao became exceptionally quiet, and the clusters of firelight weaved through the mountain forest like a roaming dragon, the bright lights illuminating the way to the Cloudy Brook Academy right at the top.

Based on what Ye Sha had said, the number of people the Nine Temples had sent here numbered in the tens of thousands. If the Cloudy Brook Academy had not been so vast, it would be hard to accommodate every single one of them. But among the tens of thousands, a large part of them have been sent out to patrol the mid mountain areas and to guard the mountain’s foot, leaving only a small portion of their people up on the summit.

Jun Wu Xie slipped into the Cloudy Brook Academy without a sound. Having left from this place for such a long while, she had not thought that she would come set foot into the Cloudy Brook Academy again, and to find that the place was still the same, but the people have completely changed.
