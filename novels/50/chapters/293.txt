Chapter 294: “Substitution (3)”

“That despicable Ke Cang Ju, really deserved to die.” Qiao Chu said, suppressing his anger.

The three of them entered the room, and Hua Yao searched the wardrobe for a clean suit of clothes to change into. Ke Cang Ju only had clothes of a dark shade and did not find one that suited his taste.

In Ke Cang Ju’s study, there were many medical books. From the worn and tattered state of the books, their pages had been obviously well flipped. The most worn ones of them were several books on poisons. Jun Wu Xie flipped through them quickly and threw them in a corner.

“So Brother Hua can even change his voice? I had not known about that, this is a first.” Qiao Chu was sitting on a chair at the side, and suddenly remembered that when he had heard Hua Yao speak earlier, his voice had been exactly the same as Ke Cang Ju’s.

Hua Yao did not answer him and turned to Jun Wu Xie: “What do you want to do next?”

Jun Wu Xie’s objective was not in conflict to theirs, but they were still different after all.

“Why don’t you tell me what are your intentions instead?” Jun Wu Xie walked to the side and sat down slowly, feeling their cooperation had been rather smooth so far.

Hua Yao and Qiao Chu exchanged a glance for a moment before Hua Yao finally said: “We need to find a map.”

Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow.

“I had initially suspected the map to be in Ke Cang Ju’s hands, hence, I got myself admitted to the Hidden Cloud Peak as a disciple to find it. But I had just searched the premises here and did not find anything. If I am not wrong, the map should be with Qin Yue at the moment.” Hua Yao continued to explain.

“I’ll kill them, and you’ll look for the map.”

“...........” Qiao Chu was speechless at Jun Wu Xie’s nonchalant tone when speaking of committing cruel murder and blatant thievery. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Jun Xie was being just too calm about it!

“When do you intend to make your move?” Hua Yao asked.

“Not right now. After all, I am eyeing the whole Qing Yun Clan.” Jun Wu Xie said as she lowered her eyes. She was in no hurry to make her move yet as the Qing Yun Clan was huge after all. Even for her, to wipe them out in its entirety would not be a simple task. It would not be too hard to just kill Qin Yue, or the Elders, what was difficult to achieve was to send the whole Qing Yun Clan into the abyss at the same time.

The Qing Yun Clan’s Inner House had disciples totaling near a thousand, and they are spread all over the Cloudy Peaks with the twelve individual peaks also housing disciples who resided in their summits. If they were to stir the hornet’s’ nest and kill Qin Yue, it would drive the other Elders into action, and Jun Wu Xie might not be able to get out of it in one piece.

Moreover, she still did not intend to spare anyone of them.

People might call her cruel or even vicious, it did not matter.

The disciples of the Qing Yun Clan were not innocent in her eyes.

Qin Yu Yan had been determined to obliterate the whole of the Qi Kingdom just for the Soul Calming Jade, and she had not bothered to concern herself about the innocence of the people and the commoners.

From Jun Wu Xie’s point of view, anyone who harmed her grandfather and uncle would pay the price with their lives. And her vengeance would not only be upon the mastermind, but onto any persons involved or linked to it!

She wanted the whole Qing Yun Clan to disappear from the face of these lands at the same time, and she needed a little more time to prepare for it.

“Ke Cang Ju and Qin Yue enjoyed an exceptional relationship. With this appearance, I might be able to gather important information.” Hua Yao was extremely pleased with the way things are going for them. If not for Jun Wu Xie, he would not be able to disguise himself as Ke Cang Ju so completely. Killing Ke Cang Ju would have been easy for him, but he would not be able to substitute himself for Ke Cang Ju’s double, and Jun Wu Xie had helped them solved a thorny issue for them.

“If there is anything you need from us, just let us know. As long as it is within our capabilities, we will give it our best shot.” Hua Yao said.
