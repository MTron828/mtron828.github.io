Chapter 1100: “Face Slap – Eleventh Form (2)”

With Qu Xin Rui roaring scream, the women were overtaken with fear and terror. They were shaking uncontrollably as they subconsciously pressed themselves against their family members. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The citizens at the city’s gate moved to shield the womenfolk behind them, an obvious sign that they were not going to hand their women over again.

Qu Xin Rui stared at the stance the citizens were taking and her face grew dark and ominous. She swung her eyes over to the haggard looking Qu Wen Hao and shouted at him coldly: “Qu Wen Hao! Aren’t you going to gather up the prisoners! ? Don’t you want to see your daughter and wife anymore! ?”

Qu Wen Hao’s mind was suddenly shaken as he looked up in realization. He walked to go in front of Qu Xin Rui looking highly panicked and flustered and asked: “Where is my wife..... Where is she..... Why do I not see her..... Everyone else came back, why isn’t she here.....”

Qu Xin Rui sneered coldly and said: “I would naturally take extra good care of the Thousand Beast City’s Madam and if you still want to see your wife, then get the guards to capture all the women!” With the bargaining she held in her hand, Qu Xin Rui wasn’t about to give it up. Before she gains control of the Fire Country through Jun Xie, the people of the Thousand Beast City must remain within her control.

Qu Wen Hao turned his head around looking dazed as he looked at the citizens of the Thousand Beast City. On those faces, he saw the grief and struggle within the people themselves. He saw the backbone that the people of the Thousand Beast City had lost slowly being recovered. Those people who had been deeply fearful of Qu Xin Rui no longer acted as cowardly as they did before. Their eyes filled with steely determination as they pushed their womenfolk behind them, their chests puffed up, showing their defiance.

Qu Wen Hao’s gaze swung from the faces of the people onto the terrified women behind them. Those women were also the citizens of the Thousand Beast City but they had been captured by Qu Xin Rui many years ago, to be imprisoned within a dungeon where they did not see the light of day. Having not been exposed to the sun for long periods, their skin had taken on an extraordinary pale sheen. Their eyes were wide with horror as they stared unblinkingly at Qu Wen Hao, their Grand Chieftain, as their eyes pleaded soundlessly.

Qu Wen Hao felt as if something had stuck in his throat as he looked at the countless pairs of eyes filled with despair, and he found that he could not make himself give the order.

“Qu Wen Hao! Do you really want your family broken apart! ?” Qu Xin Rui saw that Qu Wen Hao was still not moving after so long and she screamed out impatiently.

Qu Wen Hao’s entire body was shaken awake once more as unbearable images flashed through his mind, surging with a ferocity that was like a needle, that was stabbed into his consciousness.

“Grand Chieftain..... She is lying..... She is lying! The Madam is long gone.....” One of the women suddenly screamed out from among the crowd. The voice tore through the air and reached Qu Wen Hao’s ears, which hit him so hard he staggered back several steps, as the blood completely drained out from his face!

“What nonsense are you spouting! Guards! Have that slut executed right now!” Qu Xin Rui’s eyes suddenly flashed with nervousness, and she screamed out in exasperation. Shen Chi who was standing right behind her immediately stepped forward, wanting to silence the woman who had spoken up.

But Qu Wen Hao suddenly stood before Shen Chi, blocking his way forward. He lifted his head and looked at Qu Xin Rui, his eyes wide with rage.

“WHERE IS MY WIFE!”

Qu Xin Rui was startled, and she fought to suppress the frantic panic that threatened to rise in her heart as she said in mock displeasure: “Qu Wen Hao! Who do you think you are talking to! ?”

“WHERE IS MY WIFE!” Qu Wen Hao roared, his eyes red and bloodshot.

Qu Xin Rui cursed under her breath and said: “Your wife is still alive and I have her imprisoned separately. Do not listen to the nonsense that that slut is spouting!”
