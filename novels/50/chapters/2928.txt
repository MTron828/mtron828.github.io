Long Yao did not rush to reply, as his gaze swept across the crowd in the arena. His attention focused on a thin figure in the crowd.

It was a good-looking youth. Throughout the selection, he was very quiet. No matter how much the elegant man sitting beside him sought his attention, he didn’t even give as much as a smile in return.

Long Yao’s was caught up in that moment because of that image.

“Sir?” The guard called out nervously.

Long Yao returned his senses and raised his chin slightly, but did not look away from Jun Wu Xie.

“That youth, is he Yan Hai, the Lord of Sea Spirit City?” Long Yao asked, in a deep, gravelly voice.

The guard followed Long Yao’s line of sight, and after seeing Jun Wu Xie’s image, he nodded slightly.

“Yes”

“Oh?” Long Yao raised his eyebrows slightly, and there was an indescribable flash of light in his eyes. “This is the second person in the Upper Realm who has the legendary Dual Spirit Rings. Seriously ... I would never have guessed.”

This drew a sneer from Long Yao’s face. He could not reconcile the image of a big and powerful person with the youth in front of him.

He was too young and thin and looked like he could not withstand even the slightest wind or rain.

Such great power was really hidden in such a small body?

Long Yao could not help but stare at Jun Wu Xie. Jun Wu Xie quickly looked in his direction and although separated by distance, their gazes met and there was a moment of connection but it was all too fleeting.

Long Yao retracted his gaze and accompanied by the guard, sat up from the high position. His large frame took a step forward and was in everyone’s sight.

There was silence in the arena, and no one dared to make a sound.

Jun Wu Xie frowned slightly, for some reason, when her and Long Yao’s eyes met, she got a bad feeling in her heart. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

But she did not know where that feeling came from.

She was sure that she and Long Yao had met for the first time today. It was rare that a complete stranger could elicit such a strong feeling from her. At the same time, Long Yao started speaking to the crowd..

“Today is the first day of the Top Ten Exponents selection contest. I am also participating in this competition for the first time. What I have seen today is utterly disappointing ... My Lord wants the truly strong, the ones who deserve the title of the Top TenExponents! Instead, this was rubbish. If the future selections are just as meaningless, then you can get out of the Sacred City, the Sacred City will not tolerate such garbage! ” As soon as Long Yao spoke, everyone in the arena was stunned!

The merciless insult was like a bucket of ice cold water poured over everyone’s head. Even the person who won that day was as good as dead from Long Yao’s contempt!

“Looking at this pile of garbage, it’s just a waste of my time. I’m too lazy to tell you more, except this!” Long Yao’s look stiffened: “My Lord has ordered that anyone who wants to challenge the top ten exponents must challenge them during this selection and in this arena only. No one may attack the top ten privately at any other time or place, or they will be killed!

As soon as Long Yao’s words finished, everyone couldn’t help but let go of their breath!

This is the first time His Lord has changed the rules of the selection of the top ten exponents since its inception!
