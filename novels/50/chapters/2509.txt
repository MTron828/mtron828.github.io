Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

What was even worse was that after the moment the arrow pierced through the chest of the last person, it suddenly changed its direction and shoot towards the others, as if it had its own thoughts!

Yan Hai was the strongest among them, and was also the one who ran away the fastest. Not having the guts to even turn his head back, he was just busy blaming his parents for not giving him a few more legs when he was born!

The bloody smell behind him was getting thicker and thicker, he could almost feel the deadly arrow getting closer to him.

Within the blink of an eye, there were already numbers of bodies collapsing on the seacoast. The red blood soaked into the soft white sand and spread across the seaside, blending into the crystal blue sea water.

Seemingly to sense the upcoming danger, the moment when Yan Hai had almost gotten to the ship, he suddenly released his spirit energy and threw the nearest strong man around him backwards! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A bloodcurdling scream came behind Yan Hai. The arrow that was chasing after him came to a slight pause after it hit his “shield”, creating the last bit of opportunity for Yan Hai to jump onto the deck with all his energy, dodging himself far away from the lethal seacoast!

“Why are you still standing there! Leave!” The whole body of Yan Hai was already dripping with sweat when Yan Hai got onto the ship. Hurriedly, he shouted at the terror-stricken people on the deck.

Recovered from the shock, those people quickly heaved the anchor in, preparing to escape after they realized the severity of the matter!

Staring at the two ships that were about to leave the coast, Zi Fei who was standing at the seaside raised her hand and called her arrow back. The arrow then transformed into a pair of red wings, lifting Zi Fei up to the sky in an instant as the wings spread open behind her!

Yan Hai simply couldn’t believe everything he saw. This was the first time he had seen that someone was able to transform the Spirit Ring to such extent!

Even Luo Qingcheng, who was given the title of the strongest Spirit Ring in the Upper Realm, couldn’t achieve doing this.

Who the hell was this deicide!

“Shit! Give me the spear gun!” All the hair on Yan Hai’s body stood on end. Once she caught up to them, there was only death awaiting them. He took the spear gun and crazily shot at Zi Fei who was flying midair, so did the other survivors of the Sea Spirit City.

There were hundreds of people left on the ships, peppering Zi Fei with their shots. Those compact attacks were just like the rainpour, swishing through the air in the direction of Zi Fei!

While glancing over the coast with the corners of his eyes, Yan Hai was so nervous that he wished the ship could sail faster.

Just hold it for a little longer, soon, they should be able to leave the isolated island. No matter how strong was the woman, she wouldn’t be able to fly for such a long time using her Spirit Ring!

Just a little more left!

A little more!

Suddenly, Zi Fei who was flying in the air stopped chasing, causing Yan Hai to immediately feel a sense of relief. He then inwardly made the decision to straight off report the incident that had happened on the isolated island to the City Lord once he had returned to the Sea Spirit City. There must be some ulterior motives for the person to kill them! Who would have known if there were some priceless treasures hidden on the island!

Both their ships were slowly getting further from Zi Fei, but before they could even let out their breath of relief, thinking that there was finally a chance for them to escape, those people suddenly stiffened.

“Young...Young Master...” A crew member patted on the shoulder of Yan Hai with his whole body trembling.

“Shut up!” cursed Yan Hai wrathfully.

“There... There...” Stammering, it seemed like the person had been scared out of his wits.

While being in a rage, Yan Hai turned his head and glared at the direction of the bow, but the view in front of his eyes had caused his heart to immediately fell into the bottom of the valley...

Without them knowing when, there were ten huge ships appearing on the sea around their two ships. The huge body of the ships had girdled the two ships of the Sea Spirit City in the middle of the ocean!
