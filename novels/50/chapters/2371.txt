The vicious thoughts in his heart made the smile on Situ Heng’s face to contort and became more and more wretched. He controlled the soul thread with one hand while he stealthily took out a medicine bottle from his waist pouch, quietly opened it and poured it on to the palm which was in control of the soul thread. Very soon, the soul thread was covered with an extremely thin layer of dark red and this faint tinge was masked by the glow of the spirit fire and even if someone was standing at the side, that person would not be able to find any anomalies.

Situ Heng stared at Jun Wu Xie who had her eyes closed and his lips curled up into a smile that would absolutely creep people out.

Just a little bitch that did not know death, did she really think that she was even worthy to have the Upper Realm as her enemy?

Without her even realizing anything, he will just let her dive down to hell with such ignorance!

This could be considered his ‘kindness’ to her.

One and a half day passed by in the blink of an eye and finally, Situ Heng cut off the connection with the soul thread at the precise time. At the same moment the connection was severed, Jun Wu Xie opened her eyes slowly and compared with the pain at the end of the first round, she was feeling much better at this moment. But after all, she had gone through a few days of continuous cultivation and her face was still somewhat pale.

Situ Heng’s face had reverted back to the usual indifference. He frowned slightly and looked at Jun Wu Xie as he slowly stood up.

“I didn’t expect that you would help me.” Just when Situ Heng was about to leave, Jun Wu Xie suddenly spoke out.

Situ Heng’s footsteps paused momentarily and as his back was facing her, there was a sneer on his face but the sneer disappeared very quickly. When he turned his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie, there was no longer any trace of it.

“I am not trying to help you, but I’m doing all of this to protect the seed of the Spirit Tree. I hope that you are not mistaken. I still hate you but what Qin Song said is right, the seed of the Spirit Tree is in you. If you were to die, it would be difficult to ensure that the seed would not be harmed in any way. I am not helping you but merely completing my own duties.” What Situ Heng said was ruthless but it was very consistent with his usual stubborn temperament.

That pair of grey eyes that had no emotions met with Jun Wu Xie’s cold gaze.

Jun Wu Xie was very clever and this was something that Situ Heng was very well aware of. Before he succeeded, he could not let her have any doubts so he had to be extremely careful around her.

“So that’s the reason.” Jun Wu Xie did not seem to have noticed anything amiss and simply nodded.

Situ Heng looked as if he was not willing to talk further as he turned away and left. There was nothing out of the ordinary in his speech and actions. One wouldn’t be able to discover anything suspicious.

Only until Situ Heng left the underground palace did the figure of the Spirit Lord appear beside her. He looked at Jun Wu Xie who just stood up and asked, “How was it?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“A very clever pretender.” Jun Wu Xie said coldly. Situ Heng had always been stoic and expressionless, stubborn to the bone. If she had not been on guard and became suspicious, he would really have been able to fool her with his words. After all, Situ Heng had never been nice to her yet he suddenly agreed to help her. This was contradictory to his usual actions but he had found an excellent excuse to counter it.

“After he succeeded Long Jiu, it looked as if he had placed something in his hand. Do you feel any discomfort anywhere?” The Spirit Lord frowned, his face riddled with worry. Because she had explicitly told him that no matter what he saw, he was not to appear. So the Spirit Lord could only observe everything in the secret room in the underground palace but could not do anything at all.
