Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Oh!

Hadn’t the Five Cities just have a big argument with Sea Spirit City? !!

The crowd was confused. But the minds of the top ten cities was not something they could predict.

At the same time, in a magnificent palace in the Upper Realm, a handsome man crossed his slender legs and looked at the news that had just been delivered in his hands while his eyes narrowed slightly. The sexy lips evoked a mysterious smile as he propped his chin on one hand as he fanned that paper with the other.

“Banquet of heroes? This is interesting. If I remember correctly, shouldn’t the Sea Spirit City be the humblest among the 72 cities? Yet they are hosting the Banquet of heroes? How could this happen?” The man looked up with query as he stared at the black robed man before him.

“My Lord, I don’t know about this matter. I only know that the Sea Spirit City has changed a lot recently. Since the new City Lord had taken over, the strength has increased greatly. Now, the 72 cities have spread the news that Sea Spirit City has gotten a good treasure which has greatly improved the strength of the entire city. Not only have they conquered a few nearby cities, the five cities brought by Nangong Lie were completely destroyed.” The black robed man said.

“Oh? So interesting?” The man raised an eyebrow slightly.

“So far, there’s no news at all from Nangong Lie. I guess that most of his subordinates are dead. Since Sea Spirit City can kill the Lord Nangong who is one the top ten masters, its strength is not to be underestimated.” The black robed man said.

The handsome man waved his hand in a disapproving manner and lazily retorted: “Nangong Lie has been abandoned since he returned from the Middle Realm. To the Lord, keeping him by his side is just like keeping an abandoned dog. Looking at his pathetic face now, he should no longer be considered as one of the top ten masters. He has died. In fact, it’s Yan Hai of ​​the Sea Spirit City ...” The man touched his chin, his eyes narrowed dangerously.

“He’s definitely fierce, strong and interesting enough. Ask the Young Miss to come here.” The man said.

The black robed man immediately retreated. After a while, a delicate and charming lady with a pale complexion entered the hall.

Gu Xin Yan stood in the hall. When she looked up, she saw the handsome and graceful man sitting on the seat above.

In the Upper Realm, Gu Ying was in a high position. Who could be of equal status? And yet, there was a special superior status.

After she saw the familiar yet strange face, Gu Xin Yan couldn’t help but look down.

“Are you looking for me?” Gu Xin Yan’s voice was unusually calm. She had been worn away by all her vigor when she was under house arrest all these years. Now she was just a bird that could not fly and escape.

“There will be a Banquet of heroes held in Sea Spirit City. You can represent me and give some gifts to that Yan Hai.” Gu Ying looked at the lifeless Gu Xin Yan with a smile.

“Why do you want me to go? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll run away?” Gu Xin Yan lowered her head and said in a muffled voice.

“Where can you escape to? My sister, this is the Upper Realm. This is no longer the Middle Realm. You are no longer a noble Young Miss. So even if I let you run around the entire vast lands of the Upper Realm, tell me, with your current capabilities and beautiful appearance, how long can you survive?” Gu Ying said sarcastically with a smile, revealing his cruelty and ruthlessness.
