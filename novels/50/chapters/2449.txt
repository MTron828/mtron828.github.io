Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

This was the first time that Jun Wu Xie saw Jun Wu Yao dressed in white. While he looked good, he also looked out of sorts. Somehow the wash of white was unsuitable for him.

The fragrance from the flowers filled her nose as Jun Wu Xie looked at the sea of flowers held suspended from Jun Wu Yao’s hands. She was momentarily stunned.

Not knowing why, she thought of her past life where she once walked along the street and saw men holding bouquets of flowers awaiting.

At that time, Jun Wu Xie did not know what they were doing. Even now, she does not understand what Jun Wu Yao was doing as well.

An indulgent, evil smile hung from Jun Wu Yao’s mouth. That madness was inconsistent with his white clothing. Although he looked handsome, it made people feel out of place.

Qiao Chu and the rest, who were affected by the sea of flowers, stared dumbly at a seemingly different Jun Wu Yao. Every pair of eyes were wide opened.

There was only Jun Wu Xie in Jun Wu Yao’s eyes as he looked at Jun Wu Xie who was surrounded by thousands of flowers. Among the hundreds of types of flowers, not one could rival her beauty.

“Little Xie” Jun Wu Yao called to her smilingly.

Jun Wu Xie slowly blinked, as she fingered the flowers at her waist level.

“What are you doing?” Jun Wu Xie asked Jun Wu Yao somewhat confusedly.

Jun Wu Yao’s smile was frozen as his eyes involuntarily turned towards the Ye trio who were gesturing to him.

Ye Mei was going mad with urgency as he gesticulated, even roping in Ye Sha, every sort of action to do with a marriage proposal.

As Jun Wu Yao swept his gaze past them, he walked slowly towards Jun Wu Yao, stepping onto the sea of flowers as he approached Jun Wu Xie. He knelt slowly in front of her, following the actions that Ye Mei and the other two taught him earlier. He took Jun Wu Xie’s hand and looked up at her.

However.....

After kneeling on the “flowers’, Jun Wu Yao realized a fatal mistake.

The thickness of the sea of flowers were fat beyond his expectations. There was no depression when he took a step, and even when he got down on one knee, he was unexpectedly still taller than Jun Wu Xie by half a head.

This.....

Was not what they had planned.

At that moment, Jun Wu Yao did not know how to proceed, as he just knelt on one knee in that same spot. He stared unblinkingly at Jun Wu Xie, who had much doubt swimming in her eyes.

The confusion in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes deepened.

That expression was akin to asking what the heck was Jun Wu Yao doing.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes became restless with anxiety as a strong wave of hot air rolled up from under his body. The petals under his feet fluttered everywhere due to the strong current of hot air. Jun Wu Yao removed all the flowers between the two of them, and once again knelt on one knee in front of Jun Wu Xie, as he held onto her hand with deep affection and asked, “Little Xie, will you marry me?”

A look of shock appeared on Jun Wu Xie’s face as she looked at Jun Wu Yao for a long moment, before asking, “Did the Upper Realm injure you?”

Jun Wu Yao was in a slight daze as he could not comprehend why she would ask this, and could only shake his head and said, “No.”

“Did they feed you any sort of medicine?” asked Jun Wu Xie again.

Jun Wu Yao still shook his head. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Jun Wu Xie wrinkled her brows lightly, as she suddenly grabbed Jun Wu Yao’s wrist to take his pulse.

“I’m really ok.” Jun Wu Yao let out a sigh of exasperation.

But Jun Wu Xie’s brows remained furrowed, as she looked at Jun Wu Yao with incomprehension.
