Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Moreover, their speed of moving was getting faster and faster. The mutated Earth Dragons and the mutated Thunder Eagles had very good teamwork. It seemed like these mutated huge monsters were launching the sudden attacks with awareness.

“Check it out? As if the Lower Realm deserves our investigation?” Luo Qingcheng sneered. “It’s just a few huge monsters and all of you were already so scared. What a bunch of rubbish. If you are really afraid of these trash from the Lower Realm, you can just go back now. I don’t need some chicken-hearted cowards like you.”

Wei Ya lost the guts to speak after listening to what Luo Qingcheng said. All he could do was just to command the army to recondition themselves in a short time and continue to move onwards after that.

However, there was not a place where they didn’t suffer the attacks from the various kinds of mutated behemoths as they marched forward. Before those huge monsters appeared, they didn’t find anything suspicious, but the raids would always happen so suddenly.

One after another, the sudden attacks came, causing the troops of the Upper Realm to be worn out both physically and mentally. The forces of the Upper Realm had been integrated for years and these Gold Spirits had almost no experience in battling. During the time they received the order of going to the Lower Realm, they had no doubt that they were going to win the battle, but who would know that the moment they arrived at their destination, they would be suffering so much from the unstoppable sudden attacks.

The thing that was even more terrifying was that those huge monsters seemed to have the ability to judge and make decisions. They would always launch their attack whenever the troops of the Upper Realm began to slacken off. They would also retreat without any hesitation after causing a large amount of dead and injuries, as if they were fooling around with the troops of the Upper Realm.

It was originally a journey that could be finished in only one day, but due to the behemoths that were always bothering them, the troops of the Upper Realm was forced to finish the trip with a total of five days.

The part that annoyed them the most was that after they had already received the mutated monsters’ attack and had fully prepared themselves to take the following one, those cunning monsters would always change their ways to attack.

It didn’t matter whether if it was during their time to rest or it was during the quiet midnight, those mutated behemoths were always able to grab the chances to give the troops of the Upper Realm a great attack!

For the whole five days, there wasn’t a time where the troops of the Upper Realm was able to relax themselves. Both their muscles and mind were in the most tense state.

It was not hard for them to deal with the mutated monsters with the number of people and the strength they had, but the thing that got them mad was that those monsters would never attack them face to face. The attack was either coming from the ground or the sky, and they would even appear in the woods and in the empty cities that they were passing through. The power of these behemoths might not be able to compare with the power of the five hundred thousand soldiers, but the size of their humongous bodies had become a nightmare to them.

If the bodies fell onto them, such astounding weight was already enough to smash their bones!

“Where the hell do these fellas come from!” During the short break, Xie Chang Ming smashed a rock beside him with his teeth clenched. Although the number of people they lost during the five days of battle wasn’t that much and was maintained below ten thousand, the fact that they had no choice but to force themselves to be alert anytime had made them almost want to collapse.

Even if they were a group of ferocious tigers, they were still not able to handle the sneak attacks coming from leash by leash of cunning foxes days and nights. Although it didn’t really bring any serious damage to them, the irritation of being provoked kept on wandering in everyone’s heart.

“These behemoths are definitely from the Life World, but... how did they become like this?” The eyebrows of Wei Ya frowned unconsciously. The waves of behemoths that attacked them these few days were all from the Life World, but there was a big disparity in the strength between those monsters and those in the Life World.
