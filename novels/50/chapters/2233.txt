Ren Huang looked at her incredulously, he could not understand how a few millenniums could make such a woman change so drastically.

Luo Qingcheng suddenly laughed out malevolently, sitting high above on the horse, she raised her chin arrogantly as she looked down at Jun Wu Yao and said, “Ye Jue, remember that all of this is what you seeked on your own.”

Jun Wu Yao sneered and ignored her.

Luo Qingcheng suddenly raised her hand and her eyes had turned malicious and mad. She said coldly: “Other than Ye Jue, kill the rest!”

Under her command, the black robed men behind her immediately took action, rushing out almost in an instant!

This force here was even larger than that at the Cloudy Brook Academy and they were all Gold Spirits!

It was a complete catastrophe, the sky seem to be falling.

At this moment, for Jun Wu Xie’s side, this was definitely a catastrophe. The battle at Mount Fu Yao had already caused them to suffer heavy losses. The Spirit Jade Palace disciples were all wounded and resting for a few days was not enough for them to completely recover. 90 had not recovered completely from its heavy injuries and Jun Wu Xie was still wounded. 10 did not even have the strength to stand on her own. Even Ren Huang was injured from the previous battle. Only Yan Bu Gui who had arrived later, Jun Wu Yao and Ye Mei who did not participate in the battle before preserved their strength.

Ye Mei could still contend against the Gold Spirits but Yan Bu Gui’s strength was not sufficient to even be placed the eyes of the enemy.

This battle, could be said to be a calamity!

Even the usually calm Jun Wu Xie had turned pale.

The black robed men first targeted Jun Wu Yao. He was completely surrounded by them. They needed to capture him alive, however as for the rest of the people, only death awaited. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Little Wu Xie, you must be careful. Grandmaster here will stake these old bones to protect you no matter what.” Ren Huang had never revealed such a dignified expression before. Even when he was at the Cloudy Brook Academy, he did not show such an expression.

Under this pair of warm and gentle gaze filled with love and devotion, Jun Wu Xie had a sudden sense of decisiveness....

“Grandmaster, I can fight.” Jun Wu Xie said, the enemies had been very clear about their goal, they would catch Jun Wu Yao and kill everyone else. She had expected this moment ever since she had found out Jun Wu Yao’s identity. She had already guessed that sooner or later, she would face such danger.

Just that...

It all came too fast, too sudden that she had no time at all to even react.

“Silly child, this battle here has no room for you to fight. Jun Wu Yao had entrusted you to me because he wants you to be safe. You must not be impulsive.” Ren Huang gave her a final glance before he directly engaged the onslaught of the black robed men. There was no more time!

The blue Spirit Ring manifested in Ren Huang’s hands. He condensed all his power into his Spirit Ring, his gaze was filled with unwavering determination, both hands swept out and the Spirit Ring unfolded and forced the black robed men to retreat!

Fresh blood splashed everywhere at this moment and the originally tranquil mountain path had ushered in a bloody hurricane. Countless black robed men rushed at him at a volant speed without any hesitation!

It was just but a moment that everything had suddenly changed. Fresh blood splashed all around as a bloody path was paved. The Spirit Jade Palace disciples could not stop this impending massacre!
