However, the moment Ye Mei touched Jun Wu Xie, he noticed that she seemed to have completely lost her consciousness and fell suddenly. Ye Mei was shocked as he quickly reached out to catch her!

Jun Wu Xie had fainted and when Ye Mei saw the injury on her chest, his heart almost stopped for a second. He did not know that she was that heavily injured, when he had seen it with his own eyes, he was so shocked that he started to sweat profusely.

The chest of Jun Wu Xie had been raptured and the broken bones mangled with her flesh could be seen. If he did not see it with his own eyes, Ye Mei could not imagine that person could stand up after suffering such a fatal injury!

Looking at the acupuncture point that the silver needle was in, a cold glint flashed and this was extremely glaring. She had used such a life risking method just to give Luo Qingcheng that one final blow.

Ye Mei only felt that his heart was sour and his throat felt as if he had followed a huge rock.

There was no hesitation in the slightest as Ye Mei took off his coat and wrapped it around Jun Wu Xie’s body and carried her up carefully. Even though his actions were light and extremely gentle, however with each movement, large amount of blood gushed out of her mouth and very soon, Ye Mei had been thoroughly soaked in her blood.

Ye Mei endured the uneasiness in his heart as he carried her to Ren Huang’s side. When Ren Huang lowered his head and saw how seriously injured Jun Wu Xie was, he raised his hand to wipe off the blood from her mouth. But no matter how much he wiped, blood kept flowing out.

Ren Huang’s eyes were bloodshot, after taking in a deep breath, he raised his hand over her wound and a warm halo flashed and disappeared immediately after.

“Go!” Ren Huang’s face had turned a shade of white as he said coldly.

Ye Mei nodded and on the other side, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had already carried Su Ya up. Su Ya was forcibly pulled away from the embrace of Yan Bu Gui, and her eyes were on the brink of despair, that pair of eyes stared at the figure that fell in a pool of blood.

Hope was obviously just in front of them, yet... why did the heavens want to torture them so?

“Quick! Go!” Ren Huang shouted. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord and Ye Mei no longer hesitated. They had already guessed the plan of Ren Huang in their hearts, but they had no other choice...

The disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace stood up and supported each other as they retreated along with the Palace Lord and Ye Mei.

However, how could those black robed men from the Upper Realm let them escape so easily? They gave chase immediately!

“Stay for me!” Ren Huang roared out angrily and that roar was like a clap of thunder and it was so loud that it pierced their eardrums. Those black robed men immediately stopped in their tracks were inwardly shock. They looked at that lone figure in the wind that had blocked them from pursuing those that had escaped.

Ren Huang’s stooped back that made him look old and frail had actually made people feel that he was very strong at this moment. He gave off an oppressive pressure that was stifling.

“Today, this will be my, Ren Huang’s last battle! Not one of you can even think of taking another step forward!!” The moment he finished his words, a large circle suddenly rose from his body as a large concentration of spirit power started resonating. Air started to twist as wind started to stir beneath him and started to rise on the soles of his feet. In the blink of an eye, his silver hair turned black, his stooped back became ramrod straight and he had regained his youth!
