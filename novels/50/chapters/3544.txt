“Your subordinate has already discussed it with the Spirit Jade Palace Lord, to continue to search the areas around the Twelve Palaces’ forces for the existence of other rune totems. The locations of the forty eight rune totems are not without a common trait. In the places where the runes have been carved, they are all places where spirit power is most robust. Your subordinate thinks that other rune totems might be in such similar locations and we have determined some targets. Preparations are being made to go investigate them.” Ye Sha reported.

Jun Wu Xie nodded and suddenly, she thought of something.

“Places where spirit energy is most robust? Throughout the Middle Realm, is there a place that with more robust spirit energy than Mount Fu Yao?” Mount Fu Yao, held special meaning to both Jun Wu Xie and the Spirit Jade Palace.

After the Twelve Palaces were destroyed, all the members of the Spirit Jade Palace had come out from the cave in Mount Fu Yao and never gone back. But hearing Jun Wu Xie say that now, it made Ye Sha suddenly remember the place that all of them had missed out on.

That’s right. If they’re talking about robust spirit energy, then Mount Fu Yao would naturally take first place.

“Has any of you gone to Mount Fu Yao?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Ye Sha shook his head.

“We did not have the chance to.....”

Just searching for the forty eight rune totems concealed within the Twelve Palaces had already taken up all their time. They had just managed to find the Twelve Palaces’ last rune totem yesterday. The Twelve Palaces’ branches and main palace had had their floors all dug up and they had just found those forty eight totems and there was nothing more.

“I want to make a trip to Mount Fu Yao.” Jun Wu Xie said as she looked at Jun Wu Yao.

“Sure, I’ll accompany you.” Jun Wu Yao said with a slight nod of his head.

Based on the forty eight places Ye Sha and the others had discovered inscriptions of the rune totems, it was highly possible that Mount Fu Yao was concealing a place just like that as well. Making a trip there might just yield some unexpected results.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord was currently deploying his disciples under him to search for any signs of other rune totems within the original territories of the Twelve Palaces and it was not yet known if there would be any results.

“Over this period, has there been any unusual movements with the Nine Temples?” Jun Wu Xie turned to Ye Mei to ask. Her plans back at the Twelve Palace’s summit had almost resulted in an accident because of Gu Ying. Although Jun Wu Yao’s appearance had turned the whole situation around, it was thought that the people Gu Ying brought were very possibly from one of the Nine Temples, people from the Spirit Void Temple. Although Jun Wu Yao had slaughtered them entirely, but it was impossible that the Spirit Void Palace were not aware of their deaths.

Ye Mei shook his head and said: “They haven’t made any unusual moves. The Nine Temples is still as quiet as before. In the beginning after Young Miss and Lord Jue had just left, we were worried whether they would carry out any acts of vengeance, but they did not. Even the Spirit Void Palace had been extraordinarily quiet.”

Jun Wu Xie lifted an eyebrow slightly, feeling that something was not right. The Nine Temples had always been cohesive and united, completely different from the Twelve Palaces where internal conflict had been strife. The Nine Temples had never fought each other which allowed their might to always remain oppressively above the Twelve Temples.

But over this period, the Nine Temples had been too quiet. It could even be said that the Nine Temples had been unusually quiet for the past thousand years where they had shown an attitude of total disregard towards the Twelve Palaces’ attempts to expand. Such a change might not have seemed obvious over such a long period of time but if one was to carefully think about it, they would feel that the Nine Temples’ docility seemed to have begun right after the Dark Emperor “fell”.

Regardless whether Gu Ying had brought his band of people to come to the Twelve Palaces’ summit without authorization or not, since he was able to mobilize the power of the Spirit Void Palace, it also proved that the Spirit Void Palace had acknowledged Gu Ying’s identity.
