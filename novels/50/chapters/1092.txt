Chapter 1093: “The Despicable Got Their Way (3)”

Xiong Ba’s strange reaction was noticed by Hua Yao and Qiao Chu and Qiao Chu slowly retracted the wide smile on his face, as he asked cautiously.

“What’s wrong..... Don’t tell me something has happened?”

Xiong Ba clenched his fists up tight unable to look at Qiao Chu straight in his eye.

Qing Yu’s lips trembled slightly and opened his mouth slightly. From Qiao Chu’s words earlier, it had held within them a message in no uncertain terms.

They had already found the place their people had been imprisoned.

Although Qiao Chu and Hua Yao were still highly energetic, but judging from their dust filled clothes and the mess their hair was in, it was not hard to see that they had not gotten any rest through the period. As they had just said, in order to track down the whereabouts of the imprisoned people of the Thousand Beast City, they really had not even been able to shut their eyes at all for the past few days and nights but they had still rushed all the way here to the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall in the first instance just to deliver the news into their hands.....

Xiong Ba and Qing Yu could not even meet the eyes of Qiao Chu and Hua Yao as the clear eyes of the two youths would just reflect the deep shame the two men were feeling at that moment.

“Can’t you just say something? What exactly happened?” Qiao Chu asked in confusion as he looked at Xiong Ba and Qing Yu who were avoiding his gaze and a sense of unease rose within his heart, the hand holding the wine jar slowly lowered.

“Young Master Qiao..... We..... We have let all of you down.....” Qing Yu squeezed out those few words in a trembling voice, sounding like every single word took all his courage to say.

The confusion in Qiao Chu’s eyes deepened and he was about to ask more about it when Hua Yao at his side suddenly raised a hand and stopped him from asking.

“Little Xie is not at the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall?” Hua Yao asked, his eyes narrowing up. Xiong Ba and Qing Yu were reacting strangely and that had given rise to an uneasy guess to creep into his mind.

Qing Yu nodded his head solemnly.

“Where is Little Xie now?” Hua Yao asked in a chilling tone.

“We..... We..... don’t know.....”

“Why did he leave?” Hua Yao’s voice was turning icy.

Qing Yu fell silent and hung his head, his hand holding the wine cup tightening its grip, and a clear crack sounded, a line suddenly appearing upon the wine cup in his hand.....

“Brother Hua.....” Qiao Chu was feeling rather nervous as he stared at the side of Hua Yao’s face. The two of them have been close for many years and he could see the rage currently brewing deep within Hua Yao’s eyes.

Qing Yue clenched his jaw tight and did not know what to say. While Xiong Ba, after a momentary struggle within his heart, finally spoke: “We’ve let down Young Master Jun. The Thousand Beast City owes him just too much..... Qu XIn Rui abducted our Young Miss and forced the Grand Chieftain to use the Spirit Taming Bone Flute to snatch Young Master Jun’s Spirit Beast away from him.....”

*(A form of swearing) “Your uncle!” With a loud crash, Qiao Chu smashed the wine jar in his hand by Xiong Ba’s feet and his attractive countenance immediately twisted up with a surge of unbridled rage!

The clear and crystalline wine exploded with the smashing of the wine jar, splashing all over Xiong Ba, but he did not react in the slightest. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It was you guys who had so persistently begged Little Xie to help you! In the end, without batting an eyelid, you have sold us out! What does this thing that happened in the Thousand Beast City have anything to do with all of us! ? Just because all of you are unable to save the person, what right do you have to make Little Xie sacrifice his own Spirit Beast! ! !” Qiao Chu shot forward to come before Xiong Ba and picked up the towering Xiong Ba in his hand, his face contorted with rage!

“This is what you mean by cooperation? Selling out your ally without the slightest hesitation? If we had known that the Thousand Beast City was like this, we shouldn’t have agreed to come help you right from the beginning!”
