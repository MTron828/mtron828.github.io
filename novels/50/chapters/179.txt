Chapter 180: “Might of Qing Yun Clan (2)“

“The purpose of our journey is not just for Miss Yun Xian, but to retrieve an item our Clan Chief desires. Eldest Miss, you had not been out for a time, it’s might be good to come out for a spot of fresh air.” The old man said with a laugh.

The girl in blue smiled and did not say anything more.

As they rolled along the bustling streets, the people’s eyes were attracted to the convoy and crowded the sides of the streets craning their necks to get a better look. On the second level of a restaurant along the street, Jun Wu Xie sat by the window and looked down at the convoy of carriages that just entered the Imperial City.

“Qing Yun Clan.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. There were a total of ten carriages, and excluding the coachmen driving the horses, there were at least two passengers per carriage.

“Bai Yun Xian told us, there were about ten people from the Qing Yun Clan arriving and the leader among them is the daughter of the Qing Yun Clan’s Clan Sovereign, Qin Yu Yan. Accompanying her was an Elder of the Qing Yun Clan, Jiang Chen Qing and eight disciples from the clan. They will be escorted by fifteen expert exponents not from their clan.” Mo Qian Yuan who was sitting at her side verified that against the list Bai Yun Xian gave them. Qing Yun Clan was the topmost clan in medicine, and many mighty powers were eager to lend them a hand. The fifteen exponents must have been gathered from those powers.

“Bai Yun Xian had no knowledge on the fifteen exponents,but she gave us very detailed information on the people from Qing Yun Clan. Jiang Chen Qing had already broken the blue level barrier with his contractual spirit, a level rarely seen. Besides him, the other Qing Yun Clan disciples have at least achieved the yellow level and beyond. The Qing Yun Clan have sent a mighty force this time, they mobilized a blue spirit, and gathered fifteen exponents from external forces. I believe those fifteen exponents are not too far off from Jiang Chen Qing by much.”

Jun Wu Xie listened quietly and thought it through. According to the norm in the speed in training, for a person to break the blue level barrier, he has to be over a hundred years old. But according to Bai Yun Xian, Jiang Chen Qing was only just past seventy. From the red level to blue, he had shortened the average time needed by an astounding thirty over years, he must be extremely gifted!

In a broad sense, no exponent from the Kingdom of Qi had broken the blue level spirit barrier. Her uncle was already perceived to be gifted, and he had only managed to achieve the top end of level yellow. Her grandfather had struggled in the green level for more than two decades and have not managed to break blue.

From green to blue, it might be a difference of one level, but for one who is not gifted, it will take them sixty long years.....

For the average person, even if immediately after their contractual spirit awakens, they train and developed nonstop every single day, they will be one hundred and seven years old to achieve a level green spirit, provided they do not meet with any difficulties breaking all the level barriers and ascend successfully to the next level, before they can even achieve green.

If they meet with any mishaps breaking the barriers, the time taken is compounded.

It might be easy to raise spiritual powers, as all it takes was concentration. But breaking level barriers had smashed the hopes and dreams of many.

You did not need to be gifted to raise your spiritual powers, but it was essential when you attempt to break level barriers.

Many have trained half their lives, and only managed a level orange spirit.

Jun Wu Xie bit down on her lip in thought, her spirit was a measly level red one. Although she had an inkling she was about to break into level orange, in the face of a blue spirit, she would be annihilated in the blink of an eye.

It’s not enough!

Not strong enough!

Qing Yun Clan had easily mobilized a mighty blue spirit, and their might stood before her, an unscalable mountain on her heart, making her gasp for air.

The might of Qing Yun Clan, had steeled Jun Wu Xie’s heart, to avoid having the Jun Family go against Qing Yun Clan at all cost, for now.
