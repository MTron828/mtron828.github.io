Jun Wu Xie pulled back on the reins and the magnificent horse raised itself up as it kicked its front hooves, coming to a stop about five steps before Ye Sha and the others.

“MEH MEH MEH~! ! !” A spherical white ball suddenly shot out from Ye Sha’s arms, burying its head right into Jun Wu Xie’s embrace.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her head and looked at Lord Meh Meh who was madly being an absolutely adorable fluff ball and her eyes could not help but show traces of a smile.

“Meh meh.....” Lord Meh Meh raised up a tiny hoof and stroked Jun Wu Xie’s body, its underbelly facing up to reveal its soft unprotected belly as it made highly aggrieved noises for having missed Jun Wu Xie so much, the sounds making people’s hearts melt. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A year’s time, to Jun Wu Xie had passed in just a blink of an eye. But to Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit who were filled with nothing but longing, every single day felt like a year. Having gotten so used to being by Jun Wu Xie’s side and smelling the refreshing scent on her, used to munching upon the scrumptious green grass around Jun Wu Xie’s feet. Being parted for one whole year, it only made the two adorable and foolish beasts miss Jun Wu Xie increasingly.

Jun Wu Xie lifted a hand up to rub Lord Meh Mehs tummy and Ye Mei who was on one side also stood up, to carry the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit who was trembling hard with excitement over into Jun Wu Xie’s arms.

The Sacrificial Blood Rabbit was trembling so hard it could not even stand firmly but to lean into Jun Wu Xie’s arms as it rubbed its furry little head against Jun Wu Xie’s chest.

The little black cat stood upon Jun Wu Xie’s shoulders as it stared at the two dumb beasts whose eyes were brimming with tears and it harrumphed indignantly. Seemingly haughty and proud, its swishing curled up tail however revealed the amount of joy it was feeling.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie who was surrounded by the ignorant beasts with an indiscernible smile. When he saw the gentleness in her eyes when she lowered her head, his heart turned uncharacteristically soft, where he wished that she would be free from worries in this life for her.

“Lord Jue.” Ye Sha said respectfully to Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Wu Yao nodded slightly.

“Everything has all been prepared. Will Lord Jue and Eldest Miss first go get some rest?” Ye Mei said

Lord Mei Mei and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit were so excited that they could not calm themselves. With the two adorable beasts acting all coy and cute in her arms, Jun Wu Xie was not able to ride her horse at all. Hence, Jun Wu Yao carried Jun Wu Xie up and let her sit side saddle before him, before he rode forward together with her. Ye Sha then took the initiative to lead Jun Wu Xie’s stallion, and followed behind with Ye Mei and Ye Gu.

Urging the horse to go before the city gates, Xue Er and the masked girl standing upon the slope immediately came running down, to kneel respectfully before the horse carrying Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie.

“Disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace, have under the orders of the Palace Lord, come to welcome you.” Xue Er’s voice rang out loud and clear, while the masked girl just knelt quietly beside her, her head lowered in silence.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Jun Wu Yao, knowing that the news of their return must have been sent out by Jun Wu Yao through some special method to Ye Mei and the others in advance, and that piece of news had then been transmitted to reach the Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s ears.

“The Palace Lord has already prepared places for both of you to rest so will you two please come with us?” Xue Er said pliantly.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly.

“Thank you.”

Xue Er was immediately shocked by the favour shown to her and she quickly shook her head.

“Miss Jun is the Spirit Jade Palace’s great benefactor and you do not need to mention it at all. We are merely just doing what we should be doing.” Xue Er had only seen Jun Wu Xie dressed as a male before and had never seen Jun Wu Xie’s real looks. Seeing it today, she was so shocked she thought she was gazing upon a celestial being. She had not known that there was such a beautiful looking young lady in this world. Her eyes and brows were like Heaven’s most perfect creation, where not the slightest flaw could be seen. Even though she was a girl, under that countenance, it was feared that she would be mesmerized and enthralled just the same.
