Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Yao’s whole arm had transformed into a spirit appendage, wave upon wave of soul power actually flowed through his arm and into Jun Wu Xie’s body. The whole room was shrouded in silence.

His eyes were filled with Jun Wu Xie’s face in pain, how much pain she was suffering that her normally cold face became twisted and contorted?

Jun Wu Xie’s heart felt like it was shattered into many pieces, but he didn’t dare stop the movements of his hand even for half a minute.

The black cat was shocked silly by the scene in front of it.

It had following Jun Wu Xie for so long, and had certain understanding towards the soul bodies. Although it knew that there were certain special ways that could allow the soul to exit the human body, but it didn’t know that in this world there was someone who could directly transform part of his body into a soul body.

This is absolutely..... Beyond logical.

The black cat didn’t dare to ask much at this moment as it looked on in worry at Jun Wu Xie.

The blue veins that covered the whole of Jun Wu Xie’s body slowly receded under the guidance of Jun Wu Yao. The pain that filled her face also slowly disappeared.

Once the pain has passed, Jun Wu Xie slowly opened her eyes, Jun Wu Yao’s imposing expression fell into her eyes.

“Don’t speak.” Jun Wu Yao said lowly, his voice was suppressed and squeezed out from his chest.

Jun Wu Xie opened her mouth but truly could not speak.

Only when Jun Wu Xie’s condition appeared to have stabilized, then only did Jun Wu Yao receded his power and transform his arm back without much effort, as he swept Jun Wu Xie into his embrace.

There was that one second where he thought he would have lost her.

Jun Wu Xie also didn’t expect that she would relapse at that moment. She didn’t want to tell Jun Wu Yao about this matter, but it looked like..... 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

...

It could not be hidden anymore.

She thought that Jun Wu Yao would say something to her, but he just silently carried her and placed her upon their bed and wiped her sweat from her body.

“I need to go out for a while.” Jun Wu Yao kissed her forehead.

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

Jun Wu Yao turned and left. The black cat jumped onto the bedside at that moment, looked at Jun Wu Xie and said, “He knows about your cultivation.”

Jun Wu Xie let out a soft sigh.

Having walked out of the room, Jun Wu Yao closed the door gently. Ye Sha and the rest, who stood guard at the door, saw Jun Wu Yao appear. Their faces were straight but their eyes held meaningful smiles.

However, they could not any trace of enjoyment from Jun Wu Yao’s expression.

Jun Wu Yao’s face was very unsightly, his brows were wrinkled as he stepped away from his room.

“Lord Jue.....” Ye Mei sensed something uncharacteristic as he looked nervously at the unsightly face of Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Yao’s expression suddenly tightened, and he spurted blood from his mouth.

Ye Sha and Ye Mei’s faces turned pale!

Jun Wu Yao raised his hand at the same moment, stopping them from expressing their shock. He frowned and raised his hand to his bloody lips while he gestured to them to keep quiet.

Ye Sha and Ye Mei both stood frozen at the same spot.

Lord Jue’s life and death worm actually activated.

What was happening? How did the life and death worm suddenly activate?!

Jun Wu Yao endured the pain caused by the life and death worm. He raised his hand and wiped the blood that splattered on the ground, he dare not leave a trace of the bloody smell.

His little fellow was very sensitive to the smell of blood. He did not want her to know this, any of this.
