Han Zi Fei raised her eyebrows slightly, and Yan Xi, who was obviously picking trouble, had no fear at all.

“Oh? When was I ever rude to Lord Jun Gu?”

Yan Xi said coldly, “You said he was a fool. Lord Gu had come for your marriage, and the Sacred Maiden said he was a fool. Isn’t it ...”

Before Yan Xi’s words were finished, Jun Gu’s face showed a little anxiety. In fact, he didn’t care what Han Zi Fei said, instead he thought her voice was particularly nice. He was willing to be scolded by her or even let her curse him a few more words.

Before waiting for Jun Gu to speak, Han Zi Fei suddenly laughed, interrupting Yan Xi’s unfinished words.

“What are you laughing at?” Yan Xi frowned slightly.

“I am laughing at you for your nosiness.” Han Zi Fei shook her head slightly and looked at Yan Xi helplessly. “You are so diligent in protecting my future husband. This makes me cry and laugh at the same time. He didn’t say he’s dissatisfied or anything so what makes you so angry? ”

“You!” Yan Xi wanted to fight back. But Han Zi Fei didn’t give her any chance at all.

“Jun Gu, let me ask you, if I call you a fool, are you happy?” Han Zi Fei looked directly at Jun Gu.

Jun Gu was so afraid that Han Zi Fei misunderstood himself, and quickly said, “No, there is nothing wrong with Sacred Maiden’s words. In a few days, we will be husband and wife. You ... whatever you say, I would love to listen ...”

Jun Gu’s response was like a basin of cold water, which was directly splashed on Yan Xi’s body, making her sit in a chair stiffly with her eyes staring daggers.

Han Zi Fei was very satisfied with Jun Gu’s answer and nodded slightly: “Although we are only to be married in a few days, if you don’t mind, can you pay a visit to my maiden’s hall tonight?? ”

As soon as Han Zi Fei’s remarks landed, there was a gasp in the whole hall.

Everyone looked at Han Zi Fei with an incredible look.

Their Sacred Maiden’s proposal may be too bold?

Before marriage, she invited Jun Gu to go to her place at midnight. This ...

Yan Xi looked at Jun Gu almost for the first time with her eyes full of struggles, as if praying that Jun Gu ignored the request of Han Zi Fei.

However...

“Yes Sacred Maiden, I will obey your request.” Jun Gu answered without saying a word, and there was a hint of excitement in his tone.

Yan Xi was completely dumbfounded. She didn’t understand why the calm Jun Gu would behave like a changed person after seeing Han Zi Fei. His energy was like a boy who had just met his first love.

Even Jun Wu Xie could not understand her father’s reaction ...

After this remark, Han Zi Fei didn’t speak again. She looked at Jun Gu with a blushing face, making Yan Xi gnash her teeth.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t respond much, just because she received a hint from Han Zi Fei.

At a banquet, they ate heartily and Duan Qi ended it all early. She wished that Jun Gu would marry Han Zi Fei back earlier. She was naturally happy to facilitate the marriage of the two.

Nearing the end of the banquet, Jun Gu looked at Han Zi Fei’s back, and wanted to keep up with her but he was pulled by Yan Xi.

“Lord Jun Gu ... You really want to go ...” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jun Gu nodded with a smile, pulled out Yan Xi’s hand and chased directly after Han Zi Fei. Leaving Yan Xi alone, standing still.

A forlorn and torn expression as she felt her heartbreak.

In the courtyard of the Sacred Maiden Hall, the silvery moonlight streamed down and Han Zi Fei had dismissed all her servants to leave as she stood alone on the pure white blanket of snow.
