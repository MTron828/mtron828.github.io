“We won’t run. We will definitely not run before we see you die without a place for burial, or we just wouldn’t be able to bear to leave.” Jun Wu Xie retorted back mockingly.

Wu Jiu’s teeth gritted with pure and intense hatred. Heavens knew where this young lady had crawled out from, that she would go against him in every instance!

“Then you can go down into Hell together with that damned animal!”

“Animal? For you to curse the Beast Spirits’ Spiritual Bear like that might not be all that appropriate you know?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said with a smile, her eyes flashing with a crafty glint.

“Spiritual Bear? Har? What Spiritual Bear? You are just as ignorant as Nalan Shan to be taking that damned animal as the Spi.....” Wu Jiu had not even finished his sentence when he was suddenly stupefied. He stared with eyes bulging and mouth hanging open at the Spiritual Bear, with so much hatred brewing in those eyes that it seemed like they wanted to bore two holes right into the body of the Spiritual Bear!

Brownie’s body was gradually expanding bit by bit as all four of its thick and stout limbs grew more massive continuously. The human spirits that surrounded it were flabbergasted with shock by everything that was happening before them as Brownie’s constantly increasing size was pushing them back step by step, and not a single one among them dared to take a step forward!

“How are things turning out like this.....” Wu Jiu glared incredulously at Brownie’s fur that was gradually turning a dark golden sheen, and his eyes that had been collected and filled with glee was replaced by utter shock.

All the Beast Spirits were staring wide eyed at that moment, captured in awe at the constantly changing Brownie. The beast that had been just a brown bear was actually slowly turning to become their most sacred Spiritual Bear that must not be defiled in any way!

How is this possible! ?

The Beast Spirits were all stunned beyond words, and the words Nalan Shan had said earlier resounded unendingly within every one of their minds.

The brown bear is the Spiritual Bear.....

The brown bear is the Spiritual Bear.....

The brown bear.....

That is their very own sacred Spiritual Bear! !

In that instant that all of them saw the Spiritual Bear, they all fell obsequiously onto their knees, prostrating themselves fully to the ground as they let out an emotional roar.

The rising and falling beastial roars reverberated outside the first Serene Spirit Tower, weaving into a moving symphony, rising up in a song of praise!

That was the piety the Beast Spirits held towards the Spiritual Bear, the worship of their faith!

The lies Wu Jiu told collapsed onto itself right at that moment.

The appearance of the Spirit Bear completely exposed the ugliness and venomous side of Wu Jiu’s!

Line after line of light gold runes then began to cover over Brownie’s dark gold body of fur, to become a pure and holy body that countless Beast Spirits could only pine for in their dreams!

“Wu Jiu, I have returned!” Brownie said as it lowered its head, its vengeful gaze staring at Wu Jiu who was caught up in utter shock. Throughout countless days and nights, in a dungeon that saw not the light of day, it was restrained in Soul Binding Chains till it could not even move, but to be trapped in dismal sorrow and darkness, enduring the torment that Wu Jiu inflicted onto it, tolerating the agony while its power of the spirit was being drained out of its body bit by bit.

Having walked out from that hopeless and desperate situation, it was not just the longing for freedom, but more about the hatred he had come to hold against Wu Jiu!

The raging burning flames of vengeance flared inside Brownie’s chest. It had endured through despair and humiliation, seeking only for the moment it would exact its revenge today!

It had come back!

Coming out before its enemies with its unmatched power of before! It would use its claws to tear through Wu Jiu’s ugly and evil soul, and send him on his way to Hell!

Upon witnessing the return of the Spiritual Bear, countless Beast Spirits tilted their heads back and let out accompanying roars, the highly emotional roars quaking the eardrums of everyone present painfully!
