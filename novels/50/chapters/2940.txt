Of course.

At this moment, Fei Yan still intended to let her go first and defend on his own.

Rong Ruo’s heart started pounding madly at this moment.

Defend?

How to defend?

That was a true Spirit Ring Exponent!

She and Fei Yan had just condensed the spirit inscriptions. They were stronger when they were together. Even if that was the case, they were still not Fang Jinghe’s opponent.

If you go, you might live, if you stay, you will definitely die.

Fei Yan was not recalling his childhood mischief. He simply intended to use his life to exchange for hers!

Both of them knew very well that they were not Fang Jinghe’s opponents at all. If they insisted on bloody battles, only death awaited them!

Rong Ruo took a deep breath and quietly released Hell Butterfly. The small sized Hell Butterfly appeared on the street full of blood. People couldn’t even think of its existence, even Fei Yan who stood in front of Rong Ruo was not aware.

This time, Rong Ruo did not release Hell Butterfly. She raised her blood-stained hand, and secretly held it in her hand, seemingly inadvertently wiping the blood on the corner of her mouth. She stuffed the Hell Butterfly that had accompanied her for years into her mouth ...

“Boy, I didn’t see that you have quite a bit of courage. You work so hard. The lady behind must be special to you right?” Fang Jinghe was not in a hurry to start, in his opinion, Whether it was Fei Yan or Rong Ruo, they were already his prey. How long they live and when they die depends entirely on his mood.

Murdering was too casual for Fang Jinghe. He no longer remembered how much blood was stained in his hands. He no longer remembered how many desperate eyes he had seen before these people died.

Killing made him feel bored. Admiring the struggle of his prey was his greatest joy.

Fang Jinghe’s eyes fell on Rong Ruo’s body. Rong Ruo was wearing men’s clothing and dressed like a man before. He had no idea at first, but he just realised it. He clearly felt that the boy in front of him was actually a woman. Her slender hand bones were fragile and sensitive. Under heavy blows, Rong Ruo’s shirt was still a little messy, her hair band was broken. Her black hair was covering her shoulders. Her face was pale due to the blood loss and looked particularly soft.

Staring at Rong Ruo’s small and white face, Fang Jinghe licked his lips involuntarily.

“I didn’t realise there is a little beauty here.”

The cold voice made Fei Yan’s hair stand. He held back the severe pain, raised his head and stared at Fang Jinghe fiercely: “If you dare to hurt her for a second, I will not let you go even if i die!!! ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

As soon as the Fei Yan’s words landed, Fang Jinghe held his breath. He looked at the Fei Yan with a tough face and laughed suddenly.

“Hahaha, don’t let me off? Why don’t you let me off? Little kid, don’t force yourself to hold on with your little skill. I can pinch you to death with just one finger. But rest assured, that I will not bear to hurt such a beautiful woman. I will take good care of her. I have not enjoyed her, how can I kill her? “Fang Jinghe’s mad laughter was as harsh as the crow’s tweet.

Fei Yan trembled. The anger of his heart was burning in the flames. At this moment, how he wished that he could have that incredible power to protect Rongruo from being insulted like this!

“Or, do you hope that I show my love for her in front of you?” Fang Jinghe said viciously.
