Jun Gu walked into the main hall and smiled, “I am Jun Gu, pleased to meet everyone here at the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

Duan Qi stood up immediately with a diligent smile on her face. But her heart was a little flustered and she couldn’t help but wondered if Jun Gu had heard the conversation between Yan Xi and Han Zi Fei? At this moment, she could not help complaining about Yan Xi’s big mouth. No man would be willing to marry a snobbish woman. What Yan Xi said just now, it seemed to intentionally force Han Zi Fei to answer and let Jun Gu ‘inadvertently’ hear it.

“Lord Jun Gu is too polite. Since the Lord is here, it is better to take a seat first.” Duan Qi said from her seat and walked up to meet Jun Gu in person, but observing Jun Gu’s reaction at the same time.

Deeply afraid of Yan Xi’s move that would make Jun Gu had some dissatisfaction with Han Zi Fei.

Duan Qi was not at all concerned about Han Zi Fei’s behavior but now that Han Zi Fei was the Sacred Maiden of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, if her reputation was ruined, it will also have a great impact on the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

“Sorry to have troubled you.” Jun Gu nodded with a gentle smile.

It seemed that Jun Gu had no dissatisfaction. Duan Qi felt relieved.

Yan Xi watched Jun Gu sit down beside her. But her eyes involuntarily looked at the opposite Han Zi Fei, and she sneered secretly. Since Jun Gu entered the main hall, she did not look at Han Zi Fei. Yan Xi was very proud of his response.

Han Zi Fei noticed Yan Xi’s provocative gaze, but smiled slightly and did not make trouble with it.

When Jun Gu sat down, Yan Xi quickly regained her gaze, pretending to look at Jun Gu and said: “Lord Jun Gu, the Sacred Maiden is the one sitting opposite you, don’t you want to take a look?”

Yan Xi’s voice might not be loud but clear enough to be heard by Jun Wu Xie who was sitting nearby. Yan Xi’s seemingly thoughtful behavior seems to be highlighting Jun Gu’s disregard for Han Zi Fei.

Jun Wu Xie’s brow frowned slightly. Even though she didn’t want her father to marry a woman in such a situation, Yan Xi making trouble with Han Zi Fei still made Jun Wu Xie very unhappy. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jun Gu didn’t seem to notice Yan Xi’s provocations. He just looked in the direction that Yan Xi had shown.

A figure came into his view and in that moment, with just one glance, Jun Gu’s entire body jolted in shock.

The soul that has been silent for many years seemed to have been splashed with water. Jun Gu looked at Han Zi Fei in a daze as her eyes seemed to have sucked him deep into a mesmerizing trance which was imprinted in his heart. For a moment, he had lost all senses and the usual calmness on his face disappeared at this moment ...

The whole hall was in silence.

Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu looked at each other, the cynical smile still hung on the corners of their mouths.

Everything around him seemed to be gone at this moment.

Between heaven and earth, there was only the both of them.

The images that had been deeply sealed in his memories seem to overlap with this moment.

In that year, he was young and handsome as he donned on a silver armor and was riding on that blood-stained land. She was dressed in white and had the air of an independent woman. He pursued the thief and killed him with his sword as blood splayed all over. This was the scene when they had first met.

That year, he was struck silly as he looked at her in a daze, as his heart was captured. She smiled sweetly and felt that she had met a silly fool.

None of them would have thought that just this one moment, their lives would be entwined.
