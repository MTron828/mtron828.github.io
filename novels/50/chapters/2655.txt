Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

It was the uniqueness of the Sea Spirit City that had made its unspoken rules.

No matter how disinclined Jun Wu Xie and the others were, there was no way they were able to change the position of the Sea Spirit City in the Upper Realm. If Jun Wu Xie did according to what Qiao Chu and the others thought, which was finding an excuse to temporarily fudge the issue of the city not being able to provide the Sea Spirit Beasts, it was able to solve the problem for some time, but just as what Jun Wu Xie had said, with the amount of reliance that the Upper Realm placed on the Sea Spirit Beast, such excuse could definitely not last too long. In the lack of supply of the Sea Spirit Beasts, the people of the Upper Realm would crazily barged into the Sea Spirit City to find the reasons, and by that time... it would be even harder for Jun Wu Xie to deal with the problem.

Once the Upper Realm found out that the Sea Spirit City was no longer hunting the Sea Spirit Beasts, then it wouldn’t take long time for them to notice the abnormality in the city.

However, the utterance made by Jun Wu Xie today had resolved the possibly existing peril. By saying that the Sea Spirit City was going to discontinue the supply of the Sea Spirit Beasts, she meant monopolization, indicating that the Sea Spirit Beast would be fully owned by the Sea Spirit City. Hence, the people from the other cities would only criticize the despotism of the Sea Spirit City without knowing that they had already stopped harming the Sea Spirit Beasts.

It could be said that such action of Jun Wu Xie had avoided some plight, but at the same time, it had also brought her even greater risks.

No matter how one weighed, it felt like there were both pros and cons in the decision Jun Wu Xie made.

“Just let them be. If they are unsatisfied with it, they can just come. The title of the seventy-two cities will eventually change one day.” Jun Wu Xie glanced over her comrades with some thoughts wandering in her mind. The messages hinted in the casual speaking tone of her had gotten Fei Yan and the rest of them astounded.

The title of the seventy-two cities... would eventually change?

With her eyes slightly widening, an astonishing guess formed rapidly in Rong Ruo’s mind. Staring at Jun Wu Xie, she asked, “Is it that... you want to launch attack at the seventy-two cities?”

“Why not?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows.

“But the ranking of the Sea Spirit City in terms of strength is simply not enough to fight against the other cities. Even though we have the Night Regime and the Ghost Army now, won’t it be strange if there’s a sudden boost in our power?” Rong Ruo frowned. Though Jun Wu Xie’s idea was good, it didn’t suit the situation of the Sea Spirit City. If there was someone who was heedful enough to pay a little more attention to the matter, it wasn’t guaranteed that he or she wouldn’t notice that something had gone wrong.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“No, it won’t.”

“It won’t?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head, “With the words that I’ve said just now, it won’t.”

“What does that mean?” Even Rong Ruo couldn’t figure out the intention of Jun Wu Xie in taking such an action.

“The existence of the Sea Spirit Beast is unique. Their bones, flesh and blood have a really great effect in boosting up the spirit energy. Though the Upper Realm has already made full use of the Sea Spirit Beast, it still hasn’t been fully developed yet. The time when I was at the isolated island, Senior Zi Fei had once told me that if one got to truly make full use of all the special characteristics of the Sea Spirit Beast, not only the spirit energy will be enhanced, but also the whole aspects of the person. It’s just that there’s only a few of them in the Upper Realm who know about this, but once someone finds it out and uses it on oneself and one’s subordinates, then it wouldn’t be impossible for one to build a troop of strong forces in a short period of time.” There was a gaze of coldness glinting in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. The Sea Spirit Beast was extremely useful, and in the perspective of the Upper Realm, the Sea Spirit City was lacking in everything, but the city would never be bereft of the Sea Spirit Beasts!

Jun Wu Xie’s words had caused Rong Ruo and the others to fall into astonishment. They then immediately got what Jun Wu Xie meant.

The reason of the Sea Spirit City monopolizing the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast was that the city had discovered the methods to strengthen their power by using the Sea Spirit Beast. If such an explanation was used in the Upper Realm, a place where only the strong should rule over the weak, then it would truly be the most reasonable exposition ever!
