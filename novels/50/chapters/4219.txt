“Lord Yan.” A soft voice suddenly sounded in Jun Wu Xie’s ears.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her gaze as Han Shu appeared by her side. She looked at Jun Wu Xie with a sweet smile and pinched her clothes with her hands shyly, her ‘innocent’ posture pushing her bosom together, making it very obvious.

Jun Wu Xie frowned slightly. But Han Shu smiled as if she had never noticed Jun Wu Xie’s dissatisfaction. “That’s where our saint maidens lived. The temperature will change rapidly on our way up. Lord Yan, please keep warm and don’t catch a cold.”

Han Shu’s sudden affection made Qiao Chu dumbfounded.

The first time when Duan Qi and Han Shu saw Jun Wu Xie, they didn’t say a good word to her. Even the dull Qiao Chu could tell that Han Shu did not like Jun Wu Xie. However, Han Shu became a different person on this journey. All of a sudden, she showed dedication and interest in Jun Wu Xie.

Qiao Chu looked at Hua Yao and he shook his head slightly. Apparently they were not interested in Han Shu’s changes.

Who knew what Duan Qi had used to brainwash Han Shu during the journey here. Han Shu’s eyes almost turned green when she looked at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie had no interest in Han Shu’s pretentiousness. She ignored Han Shu’s attempts and walked towards the entrance of the Holy Mountain. Jun Wu Yao accompanied Jun Wu Xie and walked past Han Shu as if nothing had happened.

Han Shu only felt that there was a cold war. But she did not know what was going on.

However, Qiao Chu and others have noticed the dissatisfaction of a certain Lord. They could not help looking at Han Shu sympathetically. They couldn’t imagine it, after Jun Wu Xie completed her rescue mission, they could not help but wonder how this ruthless woman would be dealt with by Jun Wu Yao. What form of death would she embrace?

Come to think of it, most of the women who have exposed their thoughts to Jun Wu Xie were pure hearted and very kind in nature, but their minds were dull. At least they were protected by Jun Wu Xie, hence Jun Wu Yao would naturally not do anything drastic.

But Han Shu ?

Ha ha.

Who did she think she was?

Jun Wu Xie probably didn’t even know what she looked like.

Han Shu was thrown aside by Jun Wu Xie’s indifference. She did not respond for a while, until Duan Qi coughed when she led Jun Wu Xie into the mountain. Looking at Jun Wu Xie’s cold back, an unknown fire quietly ignited and began burning in her heart .

She had never been ignored!

To think that with her appearance and identity, all good men would try all ways to please her and had always treated her like a goddess just to get her interested.

As for Jun Wu Xie, she was the first person and the first time that she had to please someone like this. This was the first time she hit a nail.

This really made the confident Han Shu very embarrassed. But she couldn’t show it, she could only suppress the resentment in her heart and kept up with the team’s progress.

However, the other two maidens who competed with Han Shu were very happy when they saw Han Shu facing setbacks.

They had been giving Han Shu face solely because she was relying on her status as the third saint’s sister. Finally, someone could teach Han Shu a lesson!
