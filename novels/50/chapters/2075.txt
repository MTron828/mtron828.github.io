Jun Wu Xie lifted an eyebrow and looked at Jiang Yun Long, an icy chill rising up in her eyes.

“It’s not because I can hide well, but it’s due to your stupidity. I waited for half a year in the Tranquil Dream Forest and did not see you appear once. If that isn’t due to your stupid, then what?”

Jun Wu Xie’s words angered Jiang Yun Long so much he almost vomited out blood. He stared at Jun Wu Xie in disbelief and raised up a finger trembling with rage as he said: “You said you were in the Tranquil Dream Forest? Impossible! I had gone to search the Tranquil Dream Forest before, and you were not there!”

“I was there, and that is why I am saying you are stupid.” Jun Wu Xie said indifferently as she looked at Jiang Yun Long who was fuming mad from humiliation.

Jiang Yun Long was so angry his teeth were clenched tightly together. Jun Wu Xie’s words made him feel so incredibly dumb. He had turned the entire Spirit World upside down and he had not been able to find any signs of Jun Wu Xie. Even if you beat him to death, he would not have thought that Jun Wu Xie would be in the Tranquil Dream Forest, the first place that he had searched for quite a long time.

With the being the truth, it made Jiang Yun Long wish for nothing more than to be able to strangle Jun Wu Xie, feeling deeply that he had been played by Jun Wu Xie properly!

Jiang Yun Long’s face turned a greenish tinge, and Jun Wu Xie was highly satisfied by the expression he was making.

Wu Jiu’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Poison Ivy and Jun Wu Xie who had appeared in succession. He had thought that the Spiritual Bear was already as good as in his hands today and things could come to an end. Never had he expected that these two individuals would come charging out to completely throw his plans in utter upheaval. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“To the two of you here, I do not care for what you have come here, but this is not a matter that the two of you should interfere with. Towards everything that the both of you have done before, I can choose to not pursue the past, but hope that you do not push things too far. Leave here today and do not stir up anymore trouble. The human spirits will still remain as your friends.” Wu Jiu did not want any trouble to grow. Soul Slayer was still waiting there impatiently and there was no meaning in dragging things on any further. Complete the construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower as quickly now and he would have all the time in the world to deal with Poison Ivy and Jun Wu Xie after that.

“Not pursue the past? How generous of you! You really move me to tears.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly curled her mouth up to laugh sneeringly. She then tilted her chin up slightly and looked at Wu Jiu who was fighting to hold himself back before she said: “You might not want to pursue the past but that’s not what I want. Apologies, but I did not come here today to seek your forgiveness but am here to settle scores with you!”

“Settle scores with me? You?” Wu Jiu suddenly burst out laughing. The fact that he did not want to waste anymore time did not also mean that he was afraid of Jun Wu Xie. No matter how powerful one human spirit was, she couldn’t be a match for him.

“Since you have refused the proffered wine, then enjoy the wine in punishment! I do not mind playing this thing out with you as I would really like to see what kind of extraordinary feat you can pull off, to be able to defeat this army tens of thousands strong!” Wu Jiu’s eyes flashed with a glint of malice and with a wave of his hand, the group of human spirits that had been standing behind him immediately joined the battlefield. Several hundreds of human spirits surrounded Jun Wu Xie and the others, looking fully intent on finishing them off completely.

Jun Wu Xie eyed the human spirits surrounding them coldly, her gaze passing fleetingly over them to look towards the Beast Spirits who were continuing to watch before she retracted her gaze completely calm and composed.

Jiang Yun Long let out a roar and led the human spirits in a charge towards Jun Wu Xie.

All of a sudden!

A massive black shadow came falling down from the sky and a white bone snake’s tail swept in a wide swath through the area. A bear’s roar and a ape’s screech sounded over the human spirits’ howls that soared up towards the Heavens!

Five handsome looking figures shot right into the battlefield, to land firmly beside Jun Wu Xie.

“You want to move against Little Xie? You’ll have to first measure how much you weigh.” Qiao Chu’s lips split into a wide smile, as the Yin Yang Bear stood up straight behind him, and its thick and stout bear paws spread wide open before it showed off its sharp fangs to send a deafening roar that shook the Heavens straight towards the human spirits!
