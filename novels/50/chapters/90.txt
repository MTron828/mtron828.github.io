Chapter 91: “First Slap (2)”

“The Jade Dew pill’s recipe is an exclusive and tightly guarded secret recipe within our Qing Yun Clan. Based on the time needed to refine this pill, it’s already wrong. To completely refine the Jade Dew pill, you need at least three to five days. You spent only half a day and you claim it’s the Jade Dew pill? Do you think I’m a child and you can easily fool me?” Bai Yun Xian laughed coldly, she absolutely did not believe that the contents in the porcelain bottle was the Jade Dew pill.

The refining method to this pill was unique to their Qing Yun Clan, others did not know that the time to refine such a pill would take such a long time. This Lin Palace Missy simply wanted to pull a fast one and stuffed some medicinal pills, claiming the contents in the bottle to be the Jade Dew pills. If she let such mockery drag on, it would really be a huge joke.

“Three to five days?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and looked at Bai Yun Xian in a condescending manner as if challenging her.

Bai Yun Xian sneered.

“Why don’t you say something after verifying it?”

After talking so much, wouldn’t the facts speak for itself?

“There is no need for that.” Bai Yun Xian scoffed as she raised the bottle up in an attempt to throw it.

Mo Qian Yuan swiftly got up, with a set of resolute eyes, he said, “Miss Bai, why are you in such a hurry? We just need to verify the contents of the bottle. Unless Miss Bai is worried that you aren’t able to recognize the Jade Dew pill?” Mo Qian Yuan secretly clenched his fists under his long sleeves. After hearing the time needed to refine the Jade Dew pill, his mind was thrown into disarray.

However when he saw that Jun Wu Xie was cool and composed, he did not know why but his heart had also calmed down.

Her expression was still serene and remained unaffected by Bai Yun Xian’s comments. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He should believe her, he told himself.

Mo Qian Yuan’s unconditional trust towards Jun Wu Xie had prompted his previous actions and his questions had forced Bai Yun Xian to do a verification.

Yes, forced to.

“Your Highness, what do you mean?” Bai Yun Xian’s expression was getting uglier and uglier.

“I’m sure Miss Bai is able to determine Qing Yun Clan pills quite easily, and you are a very sensible person. Regardless whether the pills refined by Jun Wu Xie are the Jade Dew pills, if you do not personally verify it, it might cast a doubt whether or not you have the ability to accurately verify if the pill is genuine or not? Others might think you may be eager to destroy evidence?” Mo Qian Yuan had made his decision to carry this through with determination.

Bai Yun Xian had no way to back down. If she does not verify the authenticity of it, wouldn’t it let their imaginations run wild and they might really think of something so preposterous?

“Your Highness is this determined to protect Jun Wu Xie? If that’s the case, then I shall do as you wish. However, if the pills which she has refined are not the Jade Dew pills, then Your Highness will also bear the same guilt of slandering my Qing Yun Clan.” Bai Yun Xian replied curtly.

“Alright.” Mo Qian Yuan gritted his teeth, he was going all in.

Mo Xuan Fei secretly sneered, it was not that he didn’t pave a road for Mo Qian Yuan, he was suicidal and was courting his own death.

Regardless whether the Crown Prince has power or not, the Emperor and Mo Xuan Fei cannot touch him directly as they needed to uphold their reputation. Now that he had threaded on this path of no return on his own by offending Qing Yun Clan, they did not need to dirty their own hands and let Qing Yun Clan crush him.

Mo Qian Yuan ah, Mo Qian Yuan, you are stupid beyond redemption. You actually offended Bai Yun Xian for this woman?
