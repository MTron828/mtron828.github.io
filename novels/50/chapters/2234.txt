Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace who were still riddled with injuries from the intense battle before at the Cloudy Brook Academy felt overwhelmed. In the previous battle, before they had arrived, Jun Wu Xie and the rest had already been engaged in battle and they had appeared in the midst of it as reinforcements. Their presence had caught Ba He off guard but now, the tables have turned and things were different from before.

The black robed men who had suddenly appeared before them were like death gods who had crawled out of hell. They were swift and their actions precise, wherever they flashed by, before those delicate girls could even react, they had already fallen to the ground without any breath left.

Although this group of black robed men were also Gold Spirits, however each and every one of them had strength comparable to that of Ba He!

In just a few short moments, this quiet mountain path had already turned into a river of blood. Those precious lives that were just lost a few moments ago had all fallen silently. Their eyes were wide open, reflecting the shock and unwillingness they felt. They had clearly found a new path filled with hope and they were so close to a safe haven. However, Heaven had forsaken them and made a huge joke with their lives.

They were so close.... VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Just a little bit more... now they could no longer go back to the familiar green mountains and rivers, they could no longer touch those beautiful flowers nor smell them.

A thousand years of silence, in exchange for a year of freedom. In their lifetime, their freedom had been so short, before they could see what other beautiful things this world had to offer, they had fallen into a pool of blood, their lives lost forever.

The disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace who had survived from the first waves of attacks looked at the pile of bodies in front of them. Just ten minutes ago, they were still chatting happily with each other, as they envisioned their new lives, looking forward to a life filled with peace and hope. However, at this moment, the shadow of the death gods had shrouded the heads of all of them, sisters in arms who had once supported each other and had accompanied each other for a thousand years.... Had fallen in silence in front of them...

“Fight with them to the death!” The masked girl clenched her trembling fists tightly, facing this moment of desperation as countless black robed men came at them and ended their lives.

There was no room for retreat!

“Aaaaaahhh!” Cries of anguish resounded all around as blood covered their vision. The disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace had completely lost their minds as they charged at the black robed men without any regards for their own lives, even if they knew that they were sending themselves to their own deaths, they did not retreat a step.

Even if they killed one was good...

Even if they killed one was good...

Each and every one of them was prepared to die, they could die but they would never humiliate the name of the Spirit Jade Palace and they would not let the murderers who killed their sisters run around so rampantly.

The tranquil mountain path had been thrown into turmoil as blood splashed everywhere, as if this world under the sunset had been stained with a bloody fog.

When the Spirit Jade Palace Lord saw that the disciples that he had spent the last millennium with were slaughtered like lambs, one by one were slain and his eyes turned bloodshot, red with rage!

Those were his disciples that he had raised with my own hands, as if they were his own children!

“I’ll kill you all.” His rage soared to the sky and he no longer engaged with the black robed men in front of him. He immediately turned and mustered all his strength and rushed towards those black robed men that had attacked the disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace. However, this move of his had left his own back completely exposed to the opponent!
