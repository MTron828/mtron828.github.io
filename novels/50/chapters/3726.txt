Jun Wu Xie’s voice was cold like ice and sounded like a death knell.

Da Han who had crumbled back onto the ground was sweating buckets. He could not get up and could only stare hatefully at Jun Wu Xie with a pair of red eyes.

“You damned bitch! Who do you think you are! How dare you talk to Master Nangong like this! Do you think that you alone can flip the sky? Let me tell you bitch! You will die very miserably, very... ah ah ahhhhh!” Before Da Han could finish his swearing words, Jun Wu Xie figure appeared before him like a ghost. A light sword appeared in her hand as she casually slashed it across his left palm.

A blood curdling scream rang out and it completely covered up all the swearing from before.

Jun Wu Xie looked coldly at Da Han who was writhing in pain. A few of the strong men from the Upper Realm saw that she had attacked their companion and immediately wanted to rush to save him, but just as they stepped forward.... Jun Wu Xie raised her head and swept through the few of them with a cold gaze. Immediately, the feet of those people froze as if they had been frozen in the snow and could not even advance half a step.

An invisible sense of oppression permeated from Jun Wu Xie and it shrouded the entire hall. The pressure was so strong that it caused the people in the hall to feel as if there was someone strangling their necks tightly as an excruciating pain and suffocation swept over them.

Even Nangong Lie under this strong pressure oozed out cold sweat. He lifted his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie. He did not expect her to be so strong, all she did was to release some pressure and even he himself had been affected.

In desperation, Nangong Lie had to release his own Spirit Ring and a red Spirit Ring appeared in his hands. When the Spirit Ring came out, it immediately lessened the pressure in the hall, and everyone who was suffering finally had a chance to breathe at the moment.

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes slightly as she looked at Nangong Lie who held the Spirit Ring. She flicked the sword in her hand and the blood splashed onto her skirt, bit by bit, like a blooming flower. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Bitch, death awaits you!” When Da Han who was writhing in pain saw Nangong Lie release his Spirit Ring, he was elated.

It was a pity that he did not manage to feel happy for long as the light sword in the hand of Jun Wu Xie had pierced into his right hand next.

The blood curdling scream resounded in the hall once again and everyone who heard it felt their hair stand on end. The people from the Upper Realm secretly heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Nangong Lie release his Spirit Ring. Even though they were arrogant by nature, they had already noticed the huge disparity between themselves and Jun Wu Xie. Now that when they saw that Nangong Lie had made his move, they finally saw a glimmer of hope.

No matter what, Nangong Lie was also one of the Top Ten Experts in the Upper Realm. Before he released the Spirit Ring, he was suppressed but now that his Spirit Ring was out, the disparity between the enemy and him would be apparent immediately!

However, there was not a trace of any joy in Nangong Lie’s heart. He did not dare relax one bit and instead, his heart felt even heavier. Something that was overlooked by everyone was now lingering on in his mind.

From what Su Jingyan had mentioned before, Jun Wu Xie could also condense out a Spirit Ring!

When neither of them had used the Spirit Ring, Nangong Lie had already lost to Jun Wu Xie. At this moment, he used the Spirit Ring to fight against her but he had to know that...she had not revealed her own Spirit Ring yet!!!
