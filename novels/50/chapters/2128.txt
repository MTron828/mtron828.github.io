With the matter in the Spirit World settled, Qiao Chu and the others were finally able to continue their cultivation with any worries. Brownie was always ignoring the Beast Spirits’ incessant pursuit and interception, doggedly running off to mix around with Nalan Shan, causing countless Beast Spirits to want to cry but no tears came out, feeling that their very own Spiritual Bear had been snatched away from them.

But Jun Wu Xie’s heart did not fall back into peaceful calm. Having been in the Spirit World for so long and after Little Lotus and Poppy had searched for so long, she still had not managed to locate any sign of her father, Jun Gu, giving her no choice but to go seek the Spirit Lord’s help.

The Spirit Lord was the Spirit World’s creator and his perceptive senses encompassed the entire Spirit World. If he chose to, he would be able to find any single spirit he wanted to seek.

But even after the Spirit Lord searched through the Spirit World more than ten times, he was not able to find Jun Gu’s spirit soul, a point that the Spirit Lord found hard to comprehend.

“I’m sorry. I really can’t find your father’s spirit. Are you certain..... that he has come to the Spirit World?” The Spirit Lord asked as he looked apologetically at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie’s brows knitted up slightly. The Soul Calming Jade had protected her father’s soul and logically, her father’s spirit should have come to the Spirit World. But..... why was she unable to find him? Jun Wu Yao who was seated beside her then gave her tiny hand a squeeze, as a form of consolation.

“I have sent people do look into it and in the last ten plus years, we did not have anyone who looks like your father come to the Spirit World.” The Spirit Lord said carefully as he looked ar Jun Wu Xie. Every spirit who comes into the Spirit World, would go through a certain form of registration soon upon their arrival. He had checked through it, and he had not found anything.

“I don’t know.....” Jun Wu Xie sighed. She had thought that she would be able to find Jun Gu’s spirit on this trip to the Spirit World and let her father return home, but..... things were not turning out as she wished.

“You mustn’t be too disappointed though. Do you remember the Spirit Tree I told you about?” The Spirit Lord then asked.

Jun Wu Xie raised her head slightly, and nodded her head as she looked at the Spirit Lord.

“The Spirit Tree, is the purest spirit form that birthed the entire world. The Middle Realm has the Spirit World, and up there in the Upper Realm, they have the Spirit Tree. Back when I created this Spirit World here, I had just emulated the way the Spirit Tree did it. At the place where the Spirit Tree stands as its support, there are spirit souls living there as well. Maybe..... Just maybe your father might be there.” The Spirit Lord said with a laugh.

Upon hearing that, Jun Wu Xie’s eyes immediately lit up.

But the Spirit Lord’s words suddenly took a sharp turn. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Although that might be the case, I do not suggest that you go to the Upper Realm. I have already told you about the Sacrifice of the Three Realms. It is highly possible that Wu Jiu and that imposter were sent here by the Upper Realm and from the way things stood, they had started moving from a long time ago and it was feared that things were not all that peaceful within the Three Realms. Although the four totems in the Spirit World were destroyed, there are one hundred and eight totems for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. They had even been able to infiltrate into the Spirit World so gaining entry into all the other places would be a piece of cake. I am inclined to think that the Middle Realm is already filled with other totems and we do not know when their plans will be complete.” The Spirit Lord could not help but be worried. This was no longer turmoil that affected just the Spirit World alone. It now encompassed the entire Three Realms.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed up her eyes and an image of the enormous runes circles carved in the dungeons beneath the Serene Spirit Towers rose up in her mind involuntarily. The four rune circles were exactly the same, all seemingly depicting strange ferocious beasts like a dragon or tiger. And it was not known what they drew those runes with that they could not be erased. They could only break it by completely destroying the objects the runes were appended onto.

“You are saying that they could possibly have drawn up these rune totems in other places throughout the Middle Realm?” Jun Wu Xie then asked.
