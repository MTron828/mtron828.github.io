Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Han Zi Fei was a little puzzled. But she still held out her hand for Jun Wu Xie to check it. It turned out that Han Zi Fei’s pulse was abnormal. Her brows frowned immediately.

“What’s wrong?” Jun Gu noticed the anomaly of Jun Wu Xie, and couldn’t help worrying.

Jun Wu Xie spoke out what she saw and heard when she was with Elder Luo. After speaking, Jun Gu and the rest were stunned.

Even Han Zi Fei was shocked.

“I ... I have lived in the Sacred Maiden Tribe since I was a child. But I haven’t heard of it, I don’t know if I have used it.” Han Zi Fei frowned slightly. She couldn’t help but think of the weirdness of the tribe.

Han Zi Fei had lived in the Sacred Maiden Tribe since she was a child. She did not notice the eternal youth of the maidens. Those books in her study room only recorded that the maidens could maintain their youth by their racial characteristics. But did not expect that all of these turned out to be false!

Obviously, the youth worm in the hands of Elder Luo was not the original way for the maidens to perpetuate their youth. But they could no longer verify it.

The most critical question now is what were the risks they faced then they took the youth worm?

“In the Upper Realms, only the maidens’ babies did not need to undergo the quenching of the Sea Spirit Beast’s blood. But they may use the youth worm to replace the Sea Spirit Beast’s blood to maintain one’s youthful appearance. It’s difficult to find out if they take it or add it to their daily diet. I think only the elders of the tribe are aware of this matter. Whether that youth worm is harmful, it will cause panic among the tribe. “Jun Wu Xie frowned. In fact, she suspected that the maidens would use poison to keep their youth. In addition to the beauty, only fear is, there might be a deeper meaning to it.

The Sacred Maiden Tribe was naturally excellent in psychic force. But they were so barren of spiritual power. They lack the ability to protect themselves. If they wanted to protect themselves, they could only make the Scared Maiden Tribe into an extremely excellent and mysterious race.

Psychic force was one, while eternal youth was second.

“Will the youth worm cause damage to your mother’s body?” Jun Gu holding his wife’s hand. He was very worried as they had finally reunited and this situation had happened, which made Jun Gu uneasy.

Jun Wu Xie pressed her lips, “I don’t know.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Regarding worm poison, she was more confused and puzzled. She did not know much about it.

“It’s not difficult to know the truth.” Jun Wu Yao, who had never spoken, suddenly said.

Jun Wu Xie and the other three immediately looked at Jun Wu Yao.

“I don’t think the youth worm will have much side effects. After all, this poison is taken by Duan Qi and other elders. But to determine everything, just get hold of Elder Luo and ask her. “Jun Wu Yao shrugged slightly.

Jun Wu Xie’s mind suddenly came to her senses. Only because this matter was related to her mother, there was a loophole in her thinking.

Being too concerned might create chaos.

“It’s not difficult to catch Elder Luo. But she is the guardian of the Holy Land, and other elders would occasionally contact her. If she disappears suddenly, I’m afraid it will cause unnecessary trouble.” Han Zi Fei said.

“I know what to do.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes lightened slightly!
