Chapter 1115: “I Came To Bring You Home (2)”

Jun Wu Yao’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Looks like it has not forgotten you completely. Maybe, within its subconsciousness, it still holds an impression of you. You have not kept it with you in vain.” Seeing that even when when its consciousness was being controlled, it was still being so obedient, Jun Wu Yao was feeling rather satisfied.

Jun Wu Xie’s head was lowered, as she gently stroked Lord Meh Meh. After a while, Lord Meh Meh actually fell asleep within her arms and a tinge of gentleness flashed within Jun Wu Xie’s eyes that even she herself had not been aware of.

That gentleness in her gaze, slowly melted the icy chill away from her eyes.

“Reporting to the Young Miss! We have discovered Qu Ling Yue.” Ye Sha suddenly appeared and said. Qu Xin Rui had been handed to Ye Mei to guard alone, and he had followed behind Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao to come investigate the Heavenly Cloud Chambers.

Jun Wu Xie’s body suddenly stiffened slightly.

“Where?” She asked in a low voice.

“Within the Heavenly Cloud Chambers’ underground dungeon.”

“Bring me there.” Jun Wu Xie said, her eyes narrowing up.

Inside the Heavenly Cloud Chambers’ underground dungeon, the several guards that guarded the place had been disposed off by Ye Sha and blood splattered all over the floor. Under the dim flickering candlelight, it was dark inside the pried open iron door. Jun Wu Xie stood outside the cell, staring into the darkness inside, and no one knew what was going through her mind at that moment.

“Qu Ling Yue is right in there. Her condition..... is rather bad.” Ye Sha said hesitantly.

Qu Ling Yue’s condition, could not in fact be merely described with a singular word like bad. If it had been anyone else, Ye Sha might not have been so careful with his words. But Qu Ling Yue’s predicament was somehow linked to Jun Wu Xie and he really did not dare to be too forthright with his words on the actual situation.

Jun Wu Xie slowly opened her stride to walk towards the dark and dank cell, where the inside of the cell was permeated with the thick stench of blood.

In the moment just as Jun Wu Xie was about to step inside the cell, a hand reached out to hold her back pulling on her arm.

Jun Wu Xie turned her head back calmly, seeing that Jun Wu Yao was staring at her with a strange look in his eyes.

“You can choose not to see her.” Jun Wu Yao said, staring straight at Jun Wu Xie. Although she was trying very hard to suppress the emotions within her heart, but he could somehow feel that Qu Ling Yue’s predicament had left a wound so deep it went right to the bone right across her heart.

“It had been because of me.” Jun Wu Xie said through gritted teeth. If not for Qu Xin Rui’s earlier revelation, how would she have known that Qu Ling Yue had developed feeling for the youth she had crossdressed to become? And she wouldn’t have possibly known, that the reason Qu Ling Yue had to suffer all of this, was just because the youth she portrayed herself as, had been a little more friendly to Qu Ling Yue that had incited the jealousy of Qu Xin Rui.

The smile at the corners of Jun Wu Yao’s lips faded a little and his deep and penetrating eyes stared into Jun Wu Xie’s clear ones.

“Even if it wasn’t for you, as the daughter of the Grand Chieftain of the Thousand Beast City, the day will come where she will still end up being used to threaten Qu Wen Hao, or else, why had she not been captured together with the others? She had only wanted to leave Qu Wen Hao with a sliver of hope and over the years, Qu Wen Hao’s care and concern for his only child had only grown and intensified, inadvertently giving Qu Xin Rui a stronger hold over him.”

Whatever that had happened to the Thousand Beast City, Jun Wu Yao was not in the least bit interested. If not for the fact that Jun Wu Xie was here, he wouldn’t have appeared here at all. But he had noticed that Jun Wu Xie had developed a certain degree of guilt towards Qu Ling Yue for everything that had happened to the girl.

To a usually cold and indifferent Jun Wu Xie, this was a situation very rarely seen, and Jun Wu Yao did not wish for Jun Wu Xie to be affected by anyone.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes lowered slightly, and she did not refute Jun Wu Yao’s words, but merely said softly: “I need to go in and see her.”
