Chapter 1558: “Pay One Back in His Own Coin (1)”

Gu Xin Yan followed Jun Wu Xie, strolling aimlessly within the Cloudy Brook Academy. The two walked for quite a while and Jun Wu Xie did not even open her mouth to speak at all, which made Gu Xin Yan a little jittery.

Truth to be told, with Jun Wu so suddenly inviting her out like this, it had been completely out of her expectations. She had seen the kind of circumstances Jun Wu had been in and she knew that Lin Hao Yu’s plan had worked. But Jun Wu had not shown the slightest weakness in front of all that and even when he was made fun of by a bunch of youths everyday, Jun Wu acted like nothing had happened, treating everything indifferently.

The cold indifference of Jun Wu had greatly frustrated Gu Xin Yan. She had consented to Lin Hao Yu to go stir up all this with her silence on the matter but her aim at the end of it all was to win Jun Wu over to join the Blood Fiend Palace. But she had still not achieved the results she had thought.

Till today.....

Looking at Jun Wu’s cold profile backlit by the setting sun, the expression on Gu Xin Yan’s face was rather complicated as she strove to maintain the brilliant smile on her face.

In terms of looks, Jun Wu could only be considered to be delicately attractive. Without mentioning how numerous the men with handsome and striking looks there were in the Blood Fiend Palace, just merely in the Cloudy Brook Academy alone, there was already quite a number of handsome looking youths. But without knowing why, Gu Xin Yan actually felt that Jun Wu under that glorious setting sun seemed to look much better than she remembered him to be.

“Jun Wu, what did you want to talk to me about?” Dispersing the distracting thoughts far away, Gu Xin Yan finally could not hold it in any longer but to ask. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She was very curious why Jun Wu had come to find her today. [Was it because he could no longer endure the torment everyone was inflicting upon him and was about to ask her for help?]

Jun Wu Xie stopped in her tracks and turned her head slightly towards Gu Xin Yan.

“You are in the Ring Spirit faculty?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Gu Xin Yan was rather taken aback, not understanding why Jun Wu would suddenly mention that. She stood speechless for a while before she nodded her head.

“Yes.”

Although Gu Xin Yan has rather strong spirit power, she had gone to take part in the Ring Spirit competition during the Battle of Deities Grand Meet . Her Ring Spirit was a weapon type and it was a rare variant kind that could transform itself. It was a long whip but it could also transform itself into dual swords in the course of battle, a highly rare kind.

Variant weapon Ring Spirits were very rarely seen in the Middle Realm and even if Gu Xin Yan was not the Young Miss of the Blood Fiend Palace, with just her Ring Spirit, she would still be highly valued. That was also a source of where Gu Xin Yan’s self confidence was from.

But.....

[Why was Jun Wu asking her about that?]

[This was turning out rather differently from what she had thought.]

“Can you show it to me?” Jun Wu Xie went on to ask.

Gu Xin Yan’s eyes were filled with bewilderment, unable to comprehend why Jun Wu was suddenly showing such interest in her ring spirit. But as she still hoped to be able to rope Jun Wu into the Blood Fiend Palace, a minor matter like showing her ring spirit was something she would naturally not reject.

Gu Xin Yan summoned out her Ring Spirit very quickly like she wanted to show Jun Wu Xie her Ring Spirit’s might. In an instant, a silver long whip appeared in Gu Xin Yan’s hand. The shape of the whip was rather unique, not like the rounded shape of other whips. The length of the whip was like a blade’s edge, its form flat, its two edges at the sides almost as thin and fine as a cicada’s wings, no different from a real blade.

Instead of saying that was a whip, Jun Wu Xie felt that it was more like a flexible sword that was incredibly long.

“Move it and see.” Jun Wu Xie said.

It was the first time Gu Xin Yan was seeing someone making a request of her so naturally but she did not feel any loathing towards it. The resplendent silver whip threw out a series of chilling silver glittery light in her hand, the flexibility of the long whip much much better than a flexible sword.
