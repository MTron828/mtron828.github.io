Jun Wu Xie and the companions found Nalan Shan very quickly. Compared to the last time they met, Nalan Shan’s situation was a little worse off. A sorrow filled face that upon seeing Jun Wu Xie and her companions appear, merely forced a smile that barely tugged at the edges of his mouth.

In the room, Brownie was seated upon the floor just like before, as with it large pudgy paws, it pawed a few things here, and toyed with another few things there. Seeing Jun Wu Xie, it immediately shifted it great big rear, to lumber over to Jun Wu Xie’s feet, and raised a big furry paw to hug Jun Wu Xie’s leg, acting highly coy and coquettish.

What Jun Wu Xie could not resist the most were such furry and adorable creatures. She could not help but to stretch a hand out to rub Brownie’s big round head, her eyes filled with delight.

“All of you have grown stronger by a lot.....” The gaunt and sallow looking Nalan Shan noticed that the power of the spirit on the bodies of Jun Wu Xie and her companions had grown a lot more robust than before, to the extent that they were not inferior to his own in the slightest. That discovery greatly surprised Nalan Shan. The last time she saw Jun Wu Xie felt to be about half a year ago and half a year’s time did not count as anything much to a spirit body. A lot of new spirit souls would not even have shedded themselves off of the translucent emptiness of being a new soul but upon Jun Wu Xie’s body, he could no longer see the slightest bit of a new soul’s state.

“Mm.” Jun Wu Xie nodded. With Brownie hugging her leg, she was unable to immediately dislodge herself but just allowed Brownie to continue to latch on as she remained standing in her spot. Qiao Chu and the others just nonchalantly went to find a seat for themselves with only Fan Zhuo, who had not been able to stroke Brownie had his eyes turned to pass fleetingly over the other Beast Spirits, looking highly forlorn.

The Beast Spirits seemed to notice Fan Zhuo’s “fevered” gaze and felt rather coy but shifted themselves in the end and placed their tails on Fan Zhuo’s knee. Fan Zhuo immediately stroked them feeling highly satisfied.

“.....” Qiao Chu stared at the “furvered” pair that were Jun Wu Xie and Fan Zhuo, finding it hard to imagine how the two of them were able to love furry creatures all that much.

Prime examples of to not judge a book by its cover.

“About the previous Spirit Master, I have heard about it.” Jun Wu Xie said candidly to Nalan Shan.

Nalan Shan was slightly taken aback, as he then shook his head with a bitter smile on his face.

“Hence, you have come to find me to tell me that it is a trap and do not want me to go?” Nalan Shan said with a sigh. “Whatever you want to say, I can fully understand. But I am indebted to my Master for all the instruction and guidance he has given me and now that he has fallen into unexpected calamity, how could I possibly sit back and not do anything about it? If I am to just watch him fall under Wu Jiu’s venomous hand and shut my ears in order to save myself, then how am I any different from Wu Jiu? Wouldn’t I be worse than a nefarious beast just the same?”

“I know that if I go, I will not be able to come back alive. It isn’t only for a day or two that Wu Jiu has hated me, but I still have to go. Regardless what he will do to me when I show up, it is the least I must do as a disciple. Rest assured that I will not bring Brownie. I have already discussed it with the cheetah and the others. Once I leave here, they will immediately take Brownie away and hide in a place that I will not know of. So, no matter what kind of method Wu Jiu employs to pry my mouth open, he will still not be able to find Brownie.”

Nalan Shan was making arrangements for Brownie like he was preparing for his funeral. In another three days, he would be going to the first Serene Spirit Tower to finally conclude the whole matter. He had thought about it for a long time, and had prepared everything he could for it, seeking to not let down the gratitude he had for all his Master’s guidance, and to not let Brownie fall into danger.

“Do you think that things will be fine just as long as they do not find Brownie?” Jun Wu Xie asked with an eyebrow raised as she looked at Nalan Shan.
