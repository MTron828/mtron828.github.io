Chapter 2927: The Start Of The Selection (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

When Jun Wu Xie conquered the 72 cities, although Jun Wu Xie already showed her strength, and the Lords of the 72 cities were terrified, this did not erase the fact that Bai Zhu and the 72 Cities Lords’ attempt to overthrow Jun Wu Xie. However, the power of Jun Wu Xie’s Dual Spirit Rings gave Bai Zhu no chance of winning.

From Qiao Chu’s years of experience, a hypocrite, such as Bai Zhu, could be seen a mile away.

Bullying the weak and fearing those above him was Bai Zhu’s nature

However....

Qiao Chu was curious as to what Bai Zhu’s reaction would be if they found out that White Night City’s most powerful Lord had become Jun Wu Xie’s “son”.

However, Bai Mo did not realise Qiao Chu’s intentions, but instead glanced at Qiao Chu impatiently, and then looked away.

What happened to White Night City?

He had already killed one Lord of White Night City, what was another to him?!

Just as Qiao Chu was eagerly awaiting to watch a good show, Bai Zhu had come right up to Jun Wu Xie, with a hypocritical gentle smile on his face.

“My Lord, it has been a long time since we last met, but I trust you are well?” Bai Zhu’s tone of humility was extremely overboard. No one could have ever imagined that Bai Zhu, the former City Lord of the top city of the 72 cities, would be greeting a mere “youth” so humbly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As soon as Bai Zhu got up and walked around the arena, many people focused their attention on him, and when those people saw the object of Bai Zhu’s fawning, they understood everything.

Even they were unable to come forward and have a few words with Jun Wu Xie, not to mention Bai Zhu.

Given the power of Jun Wu Xie’s Dual Spirit Rings, there would not be many people able to compete with her in the Upper Realm. Naturally, being on good terms with Jun Wu Xie would be the best choice at this time.

The only thing was....

Because the 72 cities previously jointly declared war on Sea Spirit City, many City Lords had fear in their hearts. This fear kept them from stepping forward and exposing their necks, but instead decided to watch Jun Wu Xie’s reaction to Bai Zhu.

If Jun Wu Xie was able to accept the ‘courageous’ Bai Zhu calmly, then they would naturally dare to go up and fall at her feet!

“I am alright.” Jun Wu Xie responded blandly, belaying an extremely cold attitude.

However, Bai Zhu seemed to be completely oblivious to Jun Wu Xie’s coldness. He sat down where Qiao Chu had moved before, and looked at Jun Wu Xie with a smile, saying, “Fortunately, My Lord is forgiving towards the previous incident, your subject Bai has never had time to apologize to you. Meeting you by chance, and coming to you uninvited, I hope you are not offended. “Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. In truth, she had no plans to settle the score with Bai Zhu at all. The 72 cities were just a platform for her. After gaining the attention of His Lord, the significance of the Overlord title was negligible.

“My guess is that you have come here today to watch the selections. Am I right? But with your skills, it’s natural that such a competition is not a problem, and there is not much to see in the early stages of the selection. There is only one point which my Lord should stay a little longer today as I hear that at the end of today’s selection, Lord Long Yao will announce the will of His Lord.” Bai Zhu did not care if Jun Wu Xie paid him any heed as he murmured to himself while still looking very natural. That self absorbed look made Bai Mo furrow his brow.
