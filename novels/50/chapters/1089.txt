Chapter 1090: “Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned (2)”

“Oh? Then from what you’re saying, you do not really need this Spirit Beast to obey your orders?” Shen Chi asked as he looked at Lord Meh Meh who was lying on the floor with its eyes closed. He had just been thinking that it was rather strange that the Spirit Beast was being a little cold towards Qu Xin Rui.

Now, it seemed that there was an explanation for that.

The reason why Lord Meh Meh would suddenly appear here was only due to the Spirit Taming Bone Flute but the person who was really able to use the Spirit Taming Bone Flute was Qu Wen Hao, and the only person that would be able to make the Spirit Beast adhere to orders was just Qu Wen Hao alone.

But Qu Wen Hao had thrown the Spirit Taming Bone Flute to Qu Xin Rui on the very first day which showed that he was unwilling to do anything further than that.

“Although Guardian Grade Spirit Beasts are rare, but if they would not submit themselves to use as I wish, why should I force the issue? I only wanted the Spirit Beast to use it to coerce Jun Xie to accept my suggestion and as long as it remains here in my hands, Jun Xie will be sure to turn up once again. As long as I am able to make him submit and allow me to mobilize the might of the Fire Country to accomplish my goals, that would be enough.” Qu Xin Rui said with a laugh, pretending to have unconsciously knocked the Spirit Taming Bone Flute a few times upon the side of the lounge chair, the crisp knocks sounding clearly within Heavenly Cloud Chambers.

As the sound rang out repetitively , Lord Meh Meh opened its eyes as if it was slightly put off by the sounds.

Qu Xin Rui instead found it rather amusing and repeatedly used that to try to agitate Lord Meh Meh.

Shen Chi observed Qu Xin Rui’s wicked sense of humour and said: “I’m afraid you do not seem to mean what you said. With a Guardian Grade Spirit Beast right before your eyes, are you really completely unmoved?”

Qu Xin Rui stopped her hands’ actions and turned to look at Shen Chi.

[How could she not be tempted?]

[If not for the fact that the Spirit Taming Bone Flute could only be used by the Grand Chieftain of the Thousand Beast City, she would already have snatched it away. It was because she had no way of making the Spirit Beast obey her orders that she had said those pompous words of indifference.]

“What’s most important is the Fire Country and all other things are not as critical.” Qu Xin Rui said, her eyes narrowing up. She had suddenly lost the interest in teasing Lord Meh Meh with what Shen Chi had said and she put the Spirit Taming Bone Flute aside. Without the disturbance, Lord Meh Meh was finally able to close its eyes again to rest.

“About this Spirit Beast, Qu Wen Hao would find out about it very soon and he will surely kick up another big fuss about it.” Shen Chi reasoned.

Qu Xin Rui replied: “What’s there to worry about? You just have to cut off a finger from that slut and send it straight to Qu Wen Hao and tell him to be good and obedient. If he dares to kick up a fuss, then it will not be as simple as giving him a few additional grandkids. I can jolly well make mincemeat out of his daughter and if he really wishes for that to happen, he is welcome to stir things up.”

Shen Chi gave a low chuckle. Towards Qu Xin Rui’s highly cruel and extreme methods, he was not going to discourage her in any way but was in fact more than happy to agree with it.

“Alright. I’ll go do it now.” Upon saying that, Shen Chi immediately turned and left. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In the basement level of the Heavenly Cloud Chambers, Shen Chi’s hands were held behind his back as attendants behind him held up fire torches, to throw light into the dark dungeon cell.

Within a metal cage, faint sounds of metal chains dragging against the floor reached them and under that harsh dragging noise, pitiful wails of utter despair were mixed inside, a wail squeezed right from deep inside the soul, extremely horrifying to hear.

Shen Chi’s steps stopped in front of a metal door and the door was slowly opened. The inside of the cell was very dim and the muffled wails came from within the dim darkness. Several men in various states of undress at at the moment that the door was opened, hugged a clump of their clothes and walked out from the cell. They saw Shen Chi and they immediately nodded their heads reverently, their eyes tinged with fearful respect.

Shen Chi cast a glance at them and the sides of his mouth lifted in a cruel smirk.

“The taste of the Young Miss of the Thousand Beast City, should be rather good right?”
