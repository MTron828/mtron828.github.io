Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath. “Nalan Shan will definitely do as he says.”

The interactions with Nalan Shan had let Jun Wu Xie understand his character, highly righteous and a person that would not just stand back to see the previous Spirit Master suffer under Wu Jiu’s malicious hand. He would definitely appear!

“Like the moron he is, even knowing full well that it’s a trap, he will still go in order to save the previous Spirit Master.” Poison Ivy said with a click of his tongue. Although his tongue was venomous, he felt rather helpless. “I think he will turn up by himself and not bring the Spiritual Bear. He is the first to discover the peculiarity in the Serene Spirit Tower and he will definitely try to avoid letting Wu Jiu’s plan succeed.”

However, Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“Once Nalan Shan appears, Wu Jiu’s plan would have succeeded, regardless whether Nalan Shan brings the Spiritual Bear.”

“Why?” Qiao Chu could not help but ask at the side.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Qiao Chu and said: “If Wu Jiu can make use of the previous Spirit Master to lure out Nalan Shan, then he can use Nalan Shan to make Brownie come out.”

Spirits who were righteous would not be able to avoid such a venomous trap. Even when they knew full well that they would be walking into a deep abyss with no hope of reprieve, they would still step into the trap in order to save the person they cared for deeply.

And Nalan Shan was like that, with Brownie being the same.

They would not allow people that they cared for to suffer because of themselves.

It might be said to be dumb, but people had to respect them for that.

Jun Wu Xie’s words was also what Poison Ivy was worried about. He did not like to interfere with other people’s affairs, but as the Serene Spirit Tower implicated too many people, he had to take the step forward. He had thought to go discuss the matter with Flame Dragon before, but before he was able to do it, he had been dragged into Jun Wu Xie, to become her Ring Spirit.

“Then we must not let Nalan Shan go! Isn’t it clearly a multi layered plot? Wu Jiu is just waiting for him to walk right into the trap so Wu Jiu can get his hands on Brownie! !” Qiao Chu was furious. What Wu Jiu was doing was as good as defying the Master and destroying the name of one’s ancestors, going against the very grain of humanity, something that no one would be able to accept!

“With Nalan Shan’s character, no matter what we say, we will not be able to change anything. Moreover..... We do not know where he is.” Poison Ivy said with a sigh. From Jun Wu Xie’s mouth, he had come to know the secret in the Serene Spirit Towers, which made him vaguely realize that Wu Jiu’s motives were not as simple as he had imagined.

If it was because authourity, he had become the one party that the Spirit Lord trusted the most. And if it was because of power, he held in his hands all the human spirits in the Spirit World, so why would he throw the biggest force he held into the abyss to have the Serene Spirit Towers devour them?

Poison Ivy just did not understand what Wu Jiu was thinking. With the way Wu Jiu was doing things, it made it impossible for anyone to guess what his real motives were.

“I know.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

Poison Ivy was slightly taken aback.

Jun Wu Xie came walking away from within Jun Wu Yao’s arms. She looked at Poison Ivy and said: “I need to have a chat with Nalan Shan.”

Poison Ivy then replied: “That stubborn block of wood will not listen. Even if he believes what you say, it is not possible that he will give up on any opportunity to save the previous Spirit Master.”

“I do not need him to give up on that. I will be asking him to go.” Jun Wu Xie said abruptly.

“Ask him to go?” Poison Ivy was suddenly a little confused. [Why can’t he understand what Jun Wu Xie was saying?] DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

“You go tell Flame Dragon to encourage the Beast Spirits to go watch at the date and time that Wu Jiu had set up.”

Poison Ivy still did not understand what Jun Wu Xie was going to do. But as her Ring Spirit, he would naturally trust his Mistress’ judgement.

“Although Flame Dragon’s position and standing has been damaged, but with a small task such as this, it shouldn’t be too difficult.”

“When the time comes, you can also bring the Plant Spirits to go watch the spectacle. On that day, a great show will surely come to play at the first Serene Spirit Tower.” The corners of Jun Wu Xie’s mouth curled up into a sneer. It was high time she retaliated.
