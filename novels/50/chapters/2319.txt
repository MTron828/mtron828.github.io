Chapter 2320: Washing the Nine Temples with Blood (7)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Although Da Han spoke viciously, he could already condense out one to two spirit inscriptions. Although it was not a complete Spirit Ring, but he could also be considered strong. Otherwise, how would he dare to speak so loudly in front of Nangong Lie?

However, it was precisely that such a strong person from Upper Realm was taken down by Jun Wu Xie so easily. He was so severely injured that he could not even stand.

Those who were initially skeptical about Jun Wu Xie’s strength no longer harboured any other thoughts but fear. They shed off the pretense of calmness they once had as each and every one was trembling like a frightened quail, nervously staring at Jun Wu Xie’s every move, afraid that they would be the next person to suffer.

Nangong Lie’s face became extremely ugly as he had initially thought that the arrival of Jun Wu Xie could still be dealt with. With the arrangement of forces in the Spirit Void Temple, he had thought that he could delay them for a while, but never had he imagined that while they were still shocked by the annihilation of the eight temples, Jun Wu Xie had already extended her claws to the Spirit Void Temple. In just but a moment, the guards outside the Spirit Void Temple had already perished. Looking at the deliberate manner she did her entrance, it was obvious that everything pointed to a disaster!

What a terrible level of fighting prowess! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Nangong Lie did not even dare think about it.

With his strength, he couldn’t even sense the massacre that happened just outside nor could he sense the arrival of Jun Wu Xie. Just this point had already made him feel terrified.

Nangong Lie felt a wave of fear that he had never felt before as he started to tremble. The fear that overtook him made his muscles tense and he could not pull his eyes away from Jun Wu Xie.

“Jun Wu Xie, who are you really? What kind of blood feud do you seek with the Upper Realm? Do you really want to be enemies with us?” Nangong Lie forcibly suppressed the uneasiness of his heart, trying to make himself look calm but as soon as the words were uttered out, a slight trembling in his voice had revealed his true thoughts inside.

Jun Wu Xie looked back at him in the eyes and said coldly: “I just want to kill all of you, that’s all.”

Just want to kill all of them, that’s all?!

Nangong Lie’s eyes flared wide open, the “you” said by Jun Wu Xie did not just mean them, but the entire Upper Realm!

In the end, how much hatred was there that Jun Wu Xie would even have such a ridiculous idea of ​​being enemies with the entire Upper Realm?

“Why?” Nangong Lie did not give up. He did not understand, with the strength of Jun Wu Xie, why should she be against the Upper Realm? If she wanted, with her ability, she would be able to obtain a prestigious status in the Upper Realm and it was highly probable that with her talent, entering the TopTen Experts was a matter of ease.

Glory, splendour, wealth and rank were just at her fingertips, yet ... why did she have to choose such a precarious choice?

Jun Wu Xie looked at Nangong Lie calmly and she was clear that Nangong Lie was uttering so much nonsense just to delay the time so that his heart could calm down.

“Do I still need a reason to kill you all?” She slightly raised her eyebrows as she said in arrogance.

Just a sentence and all the words of Nangong Lie were blocked and he could not find any words to refute her.

“There’s no need to say anything more, I’ve already said that I want to wash the Nine Temples with blood, so there will be a bloodbath. Make your move.” Jun Wu Xie said impatiently, the strong stench of blood was irritating her nose. The smell that once made her feel disgusted was plaguing her on this bloody path she chose. She could not escape it.

She had chosen to walk this path herself, even if she had to bear a heavy sin, she had to go on!
