“Then how will the imposter compare to you?” Jun Wu Xie continued to ask.

“.....” He did not feel like answering at all.....

“My power of the spirit had already weakened by quite a lot at that time. But if it was before I was weakened, then he would still pale slightly in comparison.” The Spirit Lord answered despite the pain in his heart, fighting to maintain his composure.

“Then, there will not be a problem.”

“No problem?” The Spirit Lord was getting more confused. [ Just what kind of medicine was Jun Wu Xie selling in that gourd of hers 1 .]

Jun Wu Xie did not say anything more but just sat inside her cell. The Spirit Lord had said quite a lot earlier and besides the Upper Realm’s plot in seeking to offer the Three Realms up in a sacrifice in blood, there was another point that got Jun Wu Xie’s attention, which was the Spirit Tree!

Jun Wu Yao had once planted a seed from the Spirit Tree into her body and the Spirit Lord said that his soul was born from the Spirit Tree. Would that then mean..... that the Spirit Tree was in the Upper Realm?

But how did the seed of the Spirit Tree come to fall into Jun Wu Yao’s hands?

Doubts and suspicions grew layer upon layer, and Jun Wu Xie could not fathom things out clearly at that moment.

Wu Jiu was in an extremely good mood from having captured Jun Wu Xie and the others. After he went to see the imprisoned Qiao Chu and the others one after another, the then walked out from the dungeons and went off to seek an audience with the “Spirit Lord”.

However, Wu Jiu’s front foot had just stepped out from the dungeons when a dark shadow slipped fleetingly into the place. Before the two guards standing at both sides of the entrance even realized what was happening, they already found themselves completely engulfed by a black mist, and they fell to the ground unconscious.

“Has Little Xie even missed me at all?”

The voice that was tinged with smiles suddenly floated over from outside the dungeon. Jun Wu Xie who had her eyes closed in rest opened them up suddenly, as a delighted sparkle of surprise she did not even realize herself rising up within!

She saw a tall slender figure standing silently outside the dungeon, where the dim firelight shone upon that extraordinarily handsome countenance, and fell right into Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

“You’re just too much. Didn’t we agree that I was to wait for you at home? How could you have come running to such a place instead? People who break their promises should be punished you know?” The corners of Jun Wu Yao’s lips had a lazy smile hanging from them as he stood leaning against the outside the jail cell, his devilish purple eyes filled with thick smiles.

“Wu Yao.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao, her eyes then rising with a smile.

Jun Wu Yao then lightly touched the metal bars of the cage in front of him two times, and the three finger thick metal bars immediately broke right off!

Striding with a graceful gait, Jun Wu Yao walked into the jail cell and came to crouch down right in front of Jun Wu Xie, where he then held Jun Wu Xie’s hands so naturally. Seeing the Soul Binding Chains around her wrists, his eyes flashed with an almost imperceptible glint of murder. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“These things are really..... such a huge eyesore.”Jun Wu Yao’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the palm holding Jun Wu Xie’s small hand suddenly lifted up a finger, to lightly draw a line over the Soul Binding Chain.....

With a loud thunk, the Soul Binding Chain shackled around Jun Wu Xie’s wrist actually snapped apart, and fell right onto the floor.

In the instant that the Soul Binding Chain came off, Jun Wu Xie could feel her arm recovering a bit of her power of the spirit.

Jun Wu Yao raised his hand and passed it over Jun Wu Xie’s four limbs fleetingly, and all the Soul Binding Chains were broken open in an instant.

Having regained freedom, Jun Wu Xie immediately stood up.

Jun Wu Yao then stood up with her.

“For breaking a promise, you are going to punish me?” Jun Wu Xie asked as she looked thoughtfully at Jun Wu Yao. She had not forgotten what Jun Wu Yao had said earlier.

Jun Wu Yao laughed lightly and lowered his head as he lifted up the wisps of hair that had fallen over the side of Jun Wu Xie’s face to his nose to take a whiff, his enchanting eyes slightly narrowed.
