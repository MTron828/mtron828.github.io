The battle continued to heat up as blood flowed like a river. Even the little old man was riddled with wounds. Now that he was without the Spirit Ring and on top of that, he was suffering from the severe backlash that had caused his strength to fall drastically.

Time passed slowly as each second ticked by, although the Gold Spirits had incurred some damage, it wasn’t too much and this had pushed Jun Wu Xie’s side into a bitter battle.

“Little brat, is this what you said by paying back tooth for tooth, blood for blood? Ha ha ha! What a ridiculous joke!” Ba He used one leg and kicked Jun Wu Xie as he watched in delight as she fell heavily towards the ground. From beneath the mask, blood was trickling out and when he saw that, he looked on with relish and it made him laugh even more maniacally.

If not for the strange armour on Jun Wu Xie, Ba He had the confidence to kill her without question. But seeing his progress, it would just chip of more of his time on the final result would not change!

Jun Wu Xie supported herself up with a push as more fragments of the Face of Selvan fell off. The skin that was exposed was covered with countless gashes with varied depths and lengths, her body was soaked thoroughly in fresh blood but in that pair of cold eyes, there was not a trace of fear but an even more unwavering determination that stared back at him.

“What? Still not giving up? You’ve yet reached the level of a Gold Spirit, but even if you did become one, in my eyes it is just an ant that could be crushed at will.” Ba He sneered.

Jun Wu Xie took out a bottle of medicine out and poured it into her mouth. As she raised her hand, her eyes glazed over those broken rubble has scattered all over the ground. The flames on the ground had yet been extinguished the temperature in the square continued to rise. The temperature had risen to such a degree that it had made the people feel extremely uncomfortable. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A cold glint flashed by her eyes as she suddenly stood up. Her figure was shaking slightly but the hands that were holding onto the light swords steadied and supported her body.

Just a little bit longer, she had to hold on for a while more!

Just for a little while more!

Ba He sneered as he looked at Jun Wu Xie, in his eyes, her stubbornness and insistence was very ridiculous and a complete joke to him. Knowing that she was not his opponent, knowing that she was sending herself to death, she still insisted on not retreating.

There was actually such an idiot under the heavens!

“Little brat, there is no medicine for your stupidity, Su Ya doesn’t have long to live. Let me tell you this, even if I do not kill her today, with the degree of her wounds, she can live no longer than three days. Oh... I almost forgot, early this morning, I ordered someone to give her something. With those things in it, let alone three days, is it even possible to pass tonight? Ha ha ha, to save a person who is about to die, even throwing away your own life, you are really a funny person.” Ba He laughed extremely cruelly, he knew that both Jun Wu Xie and the little old man were willing to save Su Ya at the expense of their own lives, however he chose to divulge the cold truth to Jun Wu Xie.

They were saving a person who was about to die anytime.

Such a twisted joke made Ba He exhilarated, he was thrilled happy to see the pained eyes of Jun Wu Xie.

However, there was no fluctuations in that astute gaze of hers, only her killing intent had not reduced one bit.

“She is my Master.”

Even if it was a person about to die, as long as there was a breath remaining, she would save her!

Ba He’s eyes became cold as the corner of his mouth curled up into a smirk filled with disdain.

“Since you Master and disciple have such a deep relationship, then I shall graciously send you first to the nether world to welcome your Master!” Ba He raised his hand viciously, Jun Wu Xie was currently exhausted and shows like an arrow at the end of its flight, she no longer had any strength left to block this blow.

Just as Ba He was about to strike, suddenly a thunderous roar came from the entrance of the square!

He turned to look and saw a group of people bustling into the square ferociously!
