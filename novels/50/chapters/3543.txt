Although Qiao Chu and the others had initially suggested whether they should come to the Middle Realm to try and see if they could remain here in their spirit forms, they were finally frightened into going back by Jun Wu Yao’s statement saying: “When the spirit leaves the body for too long, they might no longer be able to return”. Of course Jun Wu Xie was deeply suspicious whether Jun Wu Yao was intentionally scaring them but it was a fact that the Spirit Lord had mentioned before that when a living soul leaves its body for too long a period, even if it did not cause one the severe consequences of being unable to return to his body, it would still affect them greatly, possibly leading to a spirit soul to become unable to perfectly join with his flesh body, to show symptoms of repelling.

Ye Sha nodded.

“Did any of you discover anything within the Twelve Palaces?” Playing teasingly with Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit, Jun Wu Xie had not forgotten the important business at hand. Jun Wu Yao had come out from the Spirit World for a while before to order Ye Mei and the others to go investigate whether there were any Sacrificial Array totems within the Twelve Palaces and they did not know whether they had discovered anything.

Upon mentioning about that, Ye Sha’s expression immediately changed, and his gaze grew grim. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Reporting to Young Miss, in regards to the orders from Lord Jue, we have looked into it clearly jointly with the Spirit Jade Palace. In the territories of each palace’s subordinate powers among the Twelve Palaces, every palace had four branches each hiding a secret underground chamber. In those underground chambers, we found strange runes.” Ye Sha said with his brows creased together. Back when the Twelve Palaces were destroyed, the Spirit Jade Palace had absorbed all of the Twelve Palaces’ forces. Although they had checked to see whether they were things like secret passages and such, they paid more attention on the main palaces and were not that meticulous with the branches.

Until Jun Wu Yao came back and handed the task over to them, they then had to look into it carefully. They took a few months to turn the Twelve Palaces inside out to finally find the runes in the hidden underground chambers where they then destroyed them one by one.

“Every palace among the Twelve Palaces had four branches with those runes, a total of forty eight locations. We have followed Lord Jue’s orders to have them destroyed.”

Speaking about runes, the eyes of Ye Sha and the others could not help but show intense loathing, to the extent that they were suppressing their hatred. Those feelings rose up in them for no rhyme or reason and Jun Wu Xie did not notice anything strange.

“As expected, the Upper Realm is preparing to make a move.” Jun Wu Xie said as her eyes narrowed slightly. Based on what Ye Sha said, the forty eight underground chambers found within the Twelve Palaces seemed to have existed from a long time ago. It was obvious that they were not just built within the past hundred years. They did not have any entrances and were completely sealed. It was feared that even the Twelve Palace Lords themselves did not know that those underground chambers were actually hidden under their branches. If not for the fact that Ye Mei and the others had checked so thoroughly where they broke through the floors of the branches, they would not have discovered the underground chambers that were hidden two meters below.

Such well concealed underground chambers would have been almost impossible to discover if they had not been told beforehand.

But it was not known when those runes were carved and who had been responsible for them.

Although the rune totems in the Spirit World had been carved out within the past one hundred years, but Wu Jiu had concealed himself at the previous Spirit Master’s side for almost a thousand years, and it was not known when the fake Spirit Lord had appeared in the Spirit World.

Jun Wu Xie vaguely felt that the Upper Realm’s plot to sacrifice the Three Realms must have been carried out from a very very long time ago, with one hundred and eight rune totems spread out all over the Middle Realm. Jun Wu Xie and her people had currently destroyed only less than half that number, and it was not known where the other fifty six rune totems were hidden.
