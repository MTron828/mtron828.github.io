Chapter 2933: Descending Into Danger (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The first two days of the selection were boring and made the spectators restless. On the first day, many people were in the arena to watch the trial and the number of people on the second day had dropped by almost half. When it came to the third day...

“Little Xie, do you still want to go today?” Qiao Chu stared at Jun Wu Xie. In truth, seeing the people of peak Gold Spirit Peak fight for their lives all day, was utterly boring for him.

Although Qiao Chu was now trying to condense Spiritual Inscriptions, it was only a bit higher than the peak of the Gold Spirit, but for him who had experienced countless blood battles, the ‘enthusiastic’ fighting in the ring couldn’t stir his blood.

Although the foundations of the Upper Realm were strong, they were too powerful, resulting in many lost fighting opportunities. The strong exponents in the Upper Realm could, at best, have one-on-one battles. Compared to the battles involving tens of thousands in the Lower and Middle Realms, there was much less blood and excitement.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head. “I received news from my father yesterday. Today, Wu Yao and I are going to see him and my mother.”

At the mere mention of Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei, Qiao Chu and the others’ eyes lit up.

However, these youths were very clear. Given Jun Gu’s status as a Knight of Destruction, there would be many guards and strong exponents surrounding him. With the skills of Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao, sneaking in to meet Jun Gu would not be difficult. But it would not be so easy for the rest of them.

“Then please help us pay our respects to Grandpa and Grandma,” Qiao Chu said.

Jun Wu Xie nodded with a slight smile forming across the corner of her mouth.

“Alright, I want to go into the city to see what’s there as well. I won’t go to the stadium today.” Fei Yan shrugged. Watching two days of the selection made his eyes go dizzy, plus the constant presence of Bai ZHu disgusted him. He really did not want to go anymore. He turned his eyes and looked at Rong Ruo expectantly.

“LIttle Ruo, do you want to go and take a look?”

As he said this, Fei Yan’s eyes were full of tension and worry, and he was afraid that Rong Ruo would reject him.

Maybe it was due to Fei Yan’s worried expression but after only a moment’s hesitation, Rong Ruo nodded her head, indicating her agreement.

Fei Yan and Rong Ruo intended to go out for a walk and Qiao Chu and the rest naturally did not want to stay in the restaurant. He and Hua Yao were also ready to go out for a walk, while the singular Fan Zhuo said he was willing to stay in the restaurant. Jun Wu Xie did not force it and directly pushed Bai Mo to Fan Zhuo as a companion.

Bai Mo, “...”

Could it be that nobody wanted his opinion?

It was a shame that no matter how angry Bai Mo was, whenever he saw Jun Wu Xie’s smiling face, he had no response except to go with the flow and he dared not speak out at all. He could only lower his head in sorrow and self pity.

Got it!

He said nothing, okay?

When each person formed their plans, the group separated.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao deliberately disguised themselves to make their looks less attractive.

Qiao Chu liked good food, and naturally dragged Hua Yao to a delicious place, but Fei Yan and Rong Ruo, intended to look at the scene in the Holy City and see if they could get some useful information. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Back in the restaurant, only Fan Zhuo and Bai Mo remained, both of them staring at each other. Bai Mo grunted arrogantly and turned to his room.

Although....

This was an excellent opportunity to escape, but ... Bai Mo’s spiritual power was still blocked by Jun Wu Yao! !!
