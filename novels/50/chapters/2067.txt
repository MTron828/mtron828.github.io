Jiang Yun Long’s footsteps paused slightly as he turned to look towards the young lady he had just passed. The other human spirit standing at the side was rubbing his chin as he said: “I had not thought that there would be such a beautiful lass among the human spirits. Heh heh, that’s really something.”

That person was also Wu Jiu’s disciple, a human spirit that cultivated with Jiang Yun Long on the twelfth level

Jiang Yun Long retracted his gaze and the corners of his lips stiffened indifferently.

“Now is not the time for you to be admiring beauties. It’s only three more days to the time that Master has set for Nalan Shan. We must make sure that things proceed smoothly at that time or otherwise when Master comes blaming us, both you and me would not be able to escape it.”

Jiang Yun Long did not pay too much attention to beauties, as compared to a beauty, he was more keen on power and authourity.

“Yes, Eldest Senior.” Having been admonished, the man quickly restrained his lecherous thoughts and stoically followed behind Jiang Yun Long to walk up to the twelfth level.

The location that Wu Jiu and Nalan Shan were to meet was right outside the first Serene Spirit Tower and before that happens, Jiang Yun Long and his men needed to check if there was anything unusual in the Serene Spirit Tower once more, and to inform the spirits cultivating inside and those waiting in line outside that the first Serene Spirit Tower would be temporarily closed three days later.

Jiang Yun Long and his fellow disciple went to check one round throughout the place and did not discover anything unusual. Feeling relieved, they then went back to report it to Wu Jiu.

Wu Jiu was at that moment sampling some wine in the courtyard and hearing Jiang Yun Long’s report, he then nodded his head in satisfaction.

“Master, are you certain that Nalan Shan will really turn up three days later?” Jiang Yun Long asked.

“That character of his, has not changed at all for so many years. Knowing that the previous Spirit Master is in my hands, he would not dare to not turn up.” Wu Jiu curled up the corners of his lips, and a malicious smile bloomed upon his face. Placing his own Master in captivity, to coerce his fellow disciple, were in his eyes something inevitable and as it should be, without feeling the slightest bit of guilt or remorse.

“Soul Slayer has been urging us again. Your disciple has done as you said and appeased him with reassurance. Looking at him, I think he will not be able to wait much longer.” Jiang Yun Long said.

Ever since the Weapon Spirits seized the rights to the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, Soul Slayer had often come urging Wu Jiu to quickly complete the modifications to the Serene Spirit Tower, to let the Weapon Spirits be able to go into the tower to cultivate.

“No need to worry. Once I have Nalan Shan in my hands, it will not be long before the Spirit Bear will deliver itself into my hands. Soul Slayer is being so anxious only because it wants to go into the Serene Spirit Tower itself. Arrogant and conceited. For the Weapon Spirits to have such a leader, it’s just laughable.” Wu Jiu said nonchalantly, his words showing complete indifference towards Soul Slayer.

“It thinks that it’s unmatched under the Heavens. If not for the act that the runes on its blade is deadly against spirits, the position of the leader of the Weapon Spirits will not be his.” Jiang Yun Long quipped in agreement.

Wu Jiu shrugged his shoulders.

“Leave him be. If not for him, we will not have the result we see today. Flame Dragon and Poison Ivy ad been rather clever to not have gone to verify it with the Spirit Lord. If not for Soul Slayer’s foolishness, my plans would not have progressed so smoothly.”

Fools were only needed to be of use to him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jiang Yun Long nodded his head.

“Go. Make sure things are properly prepared for what’s going to happen three days later. Make sure you receive your Uncle Master well and not embarrass yourself.” Wu Jiu said with a wave of his hand, and Jiang Yun Long immediately retreated.

Drinking for a little while more, Wu Jiu felt it was a little dull and he got up to walk towards the dungeon.

In the dungeon, the previous Spirit Master’s limbs were bound by four chains. Hearing the sound of footsteps, the previous Spirit Master raised his head slightly and saw Wu Jiu’s good looking face that was tinged with a sliver of disdain.
