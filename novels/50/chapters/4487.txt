Chapter 3083 Seizing Everything 4

Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei were bound together by chains of Soul Binding Chains. Huge chains were linked between them. The soldiers standing around them looked at them rigidly with cold eyes. From the looks of it, their pale faces and blood stains on the clothes reveal that before that, they had been tortured a lot.

However, when they saw Jun Wu Xie, a gentle smile appeared on their faces at the same time. That smile seemed to be telling Jun Wu Xie that they were fine.

But the anger in Jun Wu Xie’s heart was ignited in an instant.

“You thought, I would do nothing and let you come here? You are really naive.” The God of Destruction sneered, “But I was really surprised, I thought that otherworldly souls would not care about the life and death of people in the Three Realms. I did not expect that you seemed to care about your loved ones and friends. ”

The God of Destruction looked at Jun Wu Xie and laughed wildly.

The reason why the God of Destruction indulged Long Yao to provoke Jun Wu Xie was to try to test Jun Wu Xie’s temperament. Jun Wu Xie did not become disappointed. She used unmercilessly means to get revenge on Long Yao because Long Yao wanted to kill the companions around her.

Jun Wu Xie’s revenge and the importance of Qiao Chu and the other companions made the God of Destruction more aware of the weightage of the chips in his hands. That was why he would let Jun Wu Xie enter directly into the Seven World of Dreams.

Because what he had in his hands was enough to contain Jun Wu Xie!

“You deserve to die.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and looked at the God of Destruction murderously.

The God of Destruction simply laughed.

“I deserve to die?”

“Hahaha, then, you can come and try now, kill me, you and Ye Jue, kill me with your combined power you got, and then ... you can watch it with your own eyes, your parents, die in In front of you, ha ha ha. ”

The rampant laughter of God of Destruction echoed in the hall. The laughter was extremely harsh. The smiles on Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu’s faces almost vanished.

“Little Wu Xie, you listen.” Han Zi Fei suddenly said.

Jun Wu Xie raised her head and looked at her mother whom she had not had time to spend time with.

“You can’t let his plan succeed. Otherwise, it is not just me and your father, but everyone in the Three Realms. Even if you give up now, he will not stop. It’s just a matter of dying now or later. To exchange your father’s life and mine with his life, is a good bargain! “Han Zi Fei was blessed with extreme calmness at this moment. She had been in close contact with the God of Destruction and knew his cruelty.

Whether Jun Wu Xie gave up, she and Jun Gu could not escape. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Zi Fei, for so many years, you still haven’t changed a bit. You really are disgusting.” God of Destruction frowned and looked at Han Zi Fei. But he did not let Han Zi Fei come here to say that.

Han Zi Fei raised her eyebrows disapprovingly and looked at God of Destruction: “That’s really sorry, my human nature can’t change in this life, if I can make you feel disgusted, it is really my honor.”

God of Destruction snorted coldly, no longer talking nonsense with Han Zi. He looked directly at Jun Wu Xie and said: ” It’s up to you how you choose, and ... I want to tell you a little, even if you have the combined power, you are still not my opponent. I have to remind you that the person Feng Ming is pushing, is none other than Ye Jue’s real body!”
