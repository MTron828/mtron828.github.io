Chapter 2117: The Hero Saves the Damsel (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Dark..... Dark.....” The Spirit Lord was staring at that devilishly handsome countenance. Even if that face had been turned to ashes, he would still be able to recognize it!

That was obviously the Dark Emperor! !

Jun Wu Yao raised up his brow slightly as he looked at the Spirit Lord who was overcome with shock and he went on to say teasingly: “Having not seen you for so many years, I would not have thought that you would turn into such a shortie”

The Spirit Lord’s face flushed a deep red immediately and it was not known whether it was from rage or humiliation.

[What kind of a joke was that?] Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

[Jun Wu Xie’s trump card is actually the Dark Emperor?]

“You are not dead afterall.” The Spirit Lord was finally able to regain his composure after a long while and he said thoughtfully as he stared at that countenance that had not changed for a thousand years.

Jun Wu Yao just laughed but did not respond.

The steel bars could not stand against Jun Wu Yao at all and the thick Soul Binding Chains immediately broke apart under a casual touch of Jun Wu Yao’s finger.

Having been imprisoned for a hundred years, the Spirit Lord was finally freed from his bonds and the suppressed power once again returned to his entire body. The feeling made him want to roar out in exhilaration and never in his dreams had the Spirit Lord ever thought that the one to break him free from his predicament would turn out to be Jun Wu Yao!

“I still need to..... thank you.” The Spirit Lord expressed his gratitude to Jun Wu Yao a little bashfully.

The corners of Jun Wu Yao’s mouth curled up into a devilish smile that just made the Spirit Lord’s skin crawl.

“That little tyke is really the Spirit Lord?” The little black cat that had followed Jun Wu Yao here leapt up onto Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder. Back when Jun Wu Xie and her companions had been captured, only the little black cat had not appeared, but had remained hidden within the Flame Dragon’s cave. Only after the imposter had left, it had then rushed back to Jun Wu Xie’s house in the shortest time possible and extended an invitation for this great demon lord to come.

“Mm.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

The little black cat’s gaze that was looking at the Spirit Lord then turned thought provoking.

But Jun Wu Xie did not have the leisure to discuss the Spirit Lord’s “miniature” stature further with the little black cat but to immediately drag Jun Wu Yao to go rescue Qiao Chu and the others.

.....

In the Spirit Palace’s grand hall, Wu Jiu stood on the lower segment as he looked up at the imposter seated up upon the throne, a strange smile upon his face.

“The Spiritual Bear is now in our hands. Now, the fourth Serene Spirit Tower’s construction must continue immediately. There must be no further delay.” The imitation “Spirit Lord” said as he stared gravely at Wu Jiu from his seat high above.

Wu Jiu then replied with a smile: “Rest assured my Lord, the matter will be resolved very soon. It won’t only be about completing the fourth Serene Spirit Tower. We have not only captured he Spiritual Bear this time, but we’ve also gotten Flame Dragon, Poison Ivy, and Jun Wu Xie together with her companions. With that, the fourth Serene Spirit Tower’s Spirit Fire will be able to grow very quickly and stabilizing the totems is now well within sight.”

The imposter nodded his head slightly, seemingly highly satisfied with the current situation.

“We have already spent so much time in the Spirit World. In order to come into the Spirit World, the price you and I have paid should be very clear to you. If we do not get everything completed as soon as possible, both of us will definitely find it hard to answer or it in future.” The imposter continued to say.

Wu Jiu replied: “Now that everything is within our grasp, there will be not be anymore accidents cropping up. Throughout the entire Spirit World, who could possibly be a match for my Lord? But there is one matter that I have yet to be able to report to my Lord.

“Oh? What is it?” The imposter asked.

“Among the human spirits that my Lord managed to capture, the only young female among them, which would be Jun Wu Xie, she carries the Face of Sylvan on her.” Wu Jiu said with his eyes narrowed. How could he be able to forget the scene where Jun Wu Xie had used the Face of Sylvan to defeat him?

If not for the great might of the Face of Sylvan, how could he possibly have been defeated?
