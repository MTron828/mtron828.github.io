Jun Wu Yao looked at it for a moment, and then returned his gaze. In the face of absolute strength, any conspiracy and tricks would be broken by a punch.

Therefore, no matter what Chi Yan and Su Ruiying do, for Jun Wu Yao, it was futile and useless. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

......

“Su Ruiying, now, you can summon it.” Chi Yan admired the stitched corpses before him, as if looking at the most precious treasure, before he turned towards Su Ruiying.

Upon hearing this remark, Su Ruiying nodded, and suddenly, a monstrous spiritual power emerged, as if a giant wheel had rolled over, covering this side of the world.

Visible to the naked eye, if the ripple-like black mansions quickly flowed into the corpse floating in the void and the anger on the corpse became more frightening.

“Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ye Jue, you know, this corpse is made up of thirty-six top strong men. From the heart to the limbs, from the eyes to the hair, everything is the best part of the strong men, plus the strongest soul power summoned by Su Ruiying, will be combined with this corpse puppet, what will happen afterwards ... are you scared, scared! Are you scared, hahahaha! ”

At this moment, Chi Yan seemed to be crazy, and laughed wildly.

As Chi Yan’s words fell, the corpse puppet, who had been stuck in death, suddenly opened his eyes, and his body was strong enough to deter the sky, all the things in the forest wailed, the birds and beasts retreated, and even the fiercest monsters and slumbers were dormant.

“Corpse puppet ...” Jun Wu Yao sneered. This Chi Yan was really confident, did he think that he could defeat him with such a thing? The ignorant ... are really fortunate.

“Ye Jue, this is the power that His Lord has given me. The thirty-six strong men in the world take their strongest parts and refine this strongest corpse puppet, you today ... will die!” Chi Yan flashed coldness in his eyes, with strong self-confidence.

Soon, the seemingly weird corpse puppet, plus the strongest soul summoned by Su Ruiying, finally recovered. There was no wind automatically, accompanied by the monstrous murderous breath, slowly floating above the void, those fierce eyes staring at Jun Wu Yao.

“Kill, kill him, let him feel your invincible power!” Chi Yan laughed loudly.

As if to cater to Chi Yan’s words, the corpse puppet said nothing, and took out a fiery red sword from its waist.

Swish!

Suddenly, the corpse puppet disappeared into the distance in a flash.

“It’s so fast!” Su Ruiying couldn’t help but exclaim. The speed of the corpse puppet had reached the limit that ordinary people could imagine, like an invisible wind, but with a momentum beyond the thunder!

In the distance, Ye Jue raised his eyebrows, and Chi Yan’s corpse puppet was indeed very strong. This was beyond doubt, otherwise, Chi Yan would not be so confident.

However, no matter how strong this corpse puppet was, in front of Jun Wu Yao, it still feels like a painful ant bite, and it was not worth mentioning.

Suddenly, the corpse puppet appeared before Jun Wu Yao within a few inches of the same monarch. At the same time, the corpse puppet waved a sword in its hand.

Swish!

A gigantic sword intent seemed to cover the whole world and turn into an endless sea of ​​blood, like the Stygian River leading to the Nine Nether. Jun Wu Yao was like a lone boat in the Stygian River, as if he would be destroyed forever at any time.

Today, under the sword of the corpse puppet, this world has become the kingdom of the sword. The blood of the sword filled in the entire void, and the shadow of the sword was like a curtain of blood beyond the limit of time and power. To split the world and create a whole new world.
