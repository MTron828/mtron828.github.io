Chapter 2111: Secret Within The Spirit World (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

It was a little fella who had a face with handsome features, looking to be no more than seven or eight years old. His scrawny body was wrapped within loose clothes, skinny like a thin sheet of paper. But on that small little face, was a pair of eyes that did not fit his age, steady and calm. That pair of eyes, though the rest of him was looking rather wretched, gave people a feeling of composed elegance.

Although that description when used upon a child about seven or eight years of age was rather strange, described him perfectly.

Looking at that child made Jun Wu Xie unable to help herself but to think of Little Jue, the young bumbling little tyke. Back in the Dark Emperor’s tomb, Jun Wu Yao had tried all ways and means to improve his deficient consciousness and thinking about him now, he should have recovered by this time. Growing up over the past few years, he might have now matured to become a adolescent youth from that young little child.

However, what really surprised Jun Wu Xie was this child’s looks. Exquisitely good looking, and it could well be imagined how handsome a specimen of a man he would surely grow up into. But that very same handsomely featured face made Jun Wu Xie feel as if she had seen it before, like he was a younger version of the Spirit Lord.

That’s right.....

That face was exactly the same as that of the Spirit Lord that Jun Wu Xie had seen before! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

But a little more puerile and softer, his gaze completely different.

“Are you thinking of escaping?” The child gazed at Jun Wu Xie for a while, before he suddenly opened his mouth to say.

Jun Wu Xie was slightly taken aback.

“I overheard your entire conversation with Wu Jiu earlier. You must really want to save yourself and your companions right? I can help you.” The child said in a tone that belied his age, steady and composed, without the slightest immaturity. If she disregarded that voice that was still slightly youthful sounding, no one could have imagined that such a tone of speech could possibly come out from the mouth of such a young child.

“Who are you?” Jun Wu Xie asked as she looked at that strange child.

The young child’s eyes lowered, and the pair of light grey eyes glinted with a tinge of bitter laughter.

“If I were to tell you I am the Spirit Lord, will you believe it?”

The child’s words caused Jun Wu Xie to freeze, as her gaze stared unwaveringly upon that small little face that looked exactly like the Spirit Lord’s, her mind analyzing incessantly, the believability of that statement.

“It’s alright. It does not matter even if you do not believe it.” That child said as his lips stiffened, as his mouth revealed a bitter smile.

“I believe you.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

The child immediately lifted his head up, like he had just grasped upon the last life saving straw of grass, the dimmed and lightless eyes suddenly rising up with a bright sparkle.

“You believe what I said? Why?” The sparkle in the child’s eyes did not fade away, seeming to be anticipating for something.

Jun Wu Xie then replied: “I am acquainted with a particular Plant Spirit, who told me what the Spirit Lord was like. But the current Spirit Lord is not anything like what he described at all and you also have a face that looks exactly like the Spirit Lord, except.....”

“Except that I am quite a bit younger?” The child said with a rather desolate laugh. He raised a hand to touch the chains upon himself, the slight movement tugging on the Soul Binding Chains that made a crisp clinking sounds ring out.

Within that dark and dank dungeon, that sound pierced the ears painfully.

“What is really happening? As the Spirit Lord, how did you end up in such a state? And who is that person out there?” Jun Wu Xie was willing to believe the child before her eyes was the real Spirit Lord but..... what was happening?

The child sighed lightly.

“Are you willing to hear me out?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly.

The child’s measured voice then slowly rose within the dark and dank dungeon, unraveling the secret within the Spirit World.
