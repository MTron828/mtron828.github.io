Only after Jun Wu Xie raise her hand slightly did Blood Velvet stop the catalysis of the seed.

At this moment, Situ Heng was crumbled on the ground like a heap of mud, all the madness that just happened made him cut a sorry figure. His body was still twitching every now and then and his hair was in a complete mess. This was a huge contrast with his usual prim and proper image.

“Wu Jiu... and... I was the one ...who taught them the method of entering the Spirit World....” Situ Heng’s mouth was still twitching involuntarily as he squeezed the words out of his mouth. That pain that he had just experienced was something he would never want to experience a second time in his life, it was better to die if he was to be put through that torture once more.

The moment his words came out, it was as if a bolt of lightning had struck. Qin Song who was by the side opened his eyes wide in shock. For the matters pertaining to the fake Spirit Lord, the Spirit Lord had told them about it in brief before. When they first heard about it, they were all horrified. No matter what kind of method they employed to enter the Spirit World, never would they have ever thought that this was all done by Situ Heng!

“Who instructed you to do this?” Jun Wu Xie asked flatly, towards Situ Heng’s confession, she was not surprised one bit.

“It was.. the Lord... The ruler of the Upper Realm... I.. I didn’t have a choice...” Situ Heng trembled as he spoke, after personally experiencing her might, the fear she had instilled in him made him no longer dare to harbour any rebellious thoughts. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes dangerously, the Lord that Situ Heng mentioned should be the Master of Luo Qingcheng.

“Situ Heng! You actually dare to betray the Soul World!” Long Jiu was infuriated and immediately rushed to Situ Heng and grabbed him on his collar tightly.

They were all spirits that had been borne from the Spirit Tree, the Spirit Tree was like a parent to them, their creator. One thing that the Soul World could not tolerate was betrayal!

Although the Soul World was in the Upper Realm, but it was not under the jurisdiction of the Upper Realm. It could be said that the Soul World and the Upper Realm were two forces that each minded their own business. And the Soul World managed the spirits strictly and forbade them to interact with the people from the Upper Realm. Situ Heng was clearly aware of his wrongdoings and in order to help the Upper Realm, he did not even hesitate to bring out the medicinal pills and the Soul Devourer from the Soul World!

This was already an irrefutable betrayal!

Situ Heng looked helplessly at Long Jiu and muttered, “I didn’t have a choice... I didn’t have a choice... the Upper Realm wants the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. Did you think that the Soul World would be able to stop them? The moment the blood sacrifice begins, the Soul World would be implicated. I don’t want to die! All I want is to live! That person had promised me that as long as I helped him do his bidding, he would let me go! All I want is to live on! What is wrong with that!”

“You bastard!!” Long Jiu was enraged and immediately threw a punch at Situ Heng in his face. He couldn’t believe that they had been working together for so many years, yet Situ Heng’s heart had turned traitorous long ago. What was even more terrifying was that even till now, Situ Heng did not have a sliver of guilt or remorse in his heart.

Situ Heng flew across the floor but he did not argue with Long Jiu, all he did was look at Jun Wu Xie with trepidation.

“Other than you, who else in the Soul World has a relationship with the Upper Realm?” She pressed.

Situ Heng no longer dared to pull any tricks in front of Jun Wu Xie and could only honestly spill everything he knew, one by one.

As far as he knew, in the Soul World, other than him, there were at least ten over Soul Masters that had defected to the Upper Realm. And out of these people, there was also one who was in charge of the Soul Devourer. This was why he was able to easily get his hands on it.
