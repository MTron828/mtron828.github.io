Jun Wu Xie only glanced at Qin Song and had no other reaction.

“This is more like it, it was only different just now.” He chuckled in relish. Jun Wu Xie had been this way for five years and it was only just now that she had revealed a trace of gentleness at the bottom of her eyes and that had made him rather surprised.

Jun Wu Xie ignored Qin Song’s words as she took a step back and closed the door directly.

Staring at the that suddenly closed on him, Qin Song touched his nose helplessly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He seemed to be....not very popular.

Qiao Chu and the others stayed in the Dark Regions for five days. During this period, in addition to taking in the special sights in the Dark Regions, they spent the rest of the time taking turns to stay by Jun Wu Xie’s side, irregardless of where she went. They followed her closely like a shadow and she could only concede in helplessness. Seeing this sparked joy for Ye Sha and the few of them.

Seeing more and more emotions other than coldness on her face, although these were only subtle changes but it had already made them exhilarated.

Although Long Qi was also thrilled to have found Jun Wu Xie, but as a General of the Rui Lin Army, he had many responsibilities at hand, more than what Qiao Chu and the rest had. It was such a rare occasion that they could come to the Dark Regions and not to mention that there were ten thousand soldiers who had accompanied them on this trip. Long Qi had been very active in asking for training methods for his soldiers.

The Rui Lin Army was the number one force in the Lower Realm while the Night Regime was the strongest in the Middle Realm. As a soldier, Long Qi could immediately tell at a glance that they were extremely disciplined and had access to exceptional training resources. During this time, he spared no less effort to ask Ye Gu to share with him the training methods and towards Long Qi’s persistence, he could only concede as the Rui Lin Army was attached to the Lin Palace which was equivalent to being linked with Jun Wu Xie. Since the Night Regime was created by Jun Wu Yao and before he left, he had already relayed to them that the days following, they would be handed over to Jun Wu Xie. That was why, in essence, the two armies were already considered a family.

Of course, Fei Yan and the others would not miss such an opportunity like this. Although they had grown a lot, they still had some gaps in terms of actual combat experience if compared to the Night Regime. So whenever they were free, they would engage with Ye Mei and Ye Sha to exchange pointers but they still didn’t forget to send a person to follow Jun Wu Xie at any one time. It was as if they were afraid that she would vanish into thin air anytime.

What Qiao Chu enjoyed most at the Dark Regions was to laze in Jun Wu Xie’s palace and watch her bury herself in a pile of scrolls and at the same time, he would be lazing by the side on a lounge chair eating fruits.

Just like what he was doing at this very moment.

“Little Xie, I’ve noticed something strange.” Qiao Chu who took a bite out of a pear asked Jun Wu Xie with his mouth full.

Jun Wu Xie raised her head in the midst of all her work and looked at the leisurely and carefree Qiao Chu that made one’s hair stand up in anger who had on a curious gaze.

“I’ve noticed that everyone in the Dark Regions is using dark spirit...what is dark spirit exactly? Do you know? I feel that dark spirit is even more powerful than spirit energy.” Qiao Chu sat up as he said. This query had been in his heart for many years but it was just that he never had the courage to ask Jun Wu Yao.

It was said that the Night Regime of the Dark Regions harnessed a different power that could surpass all those who used spirit energy.They had the opportunity to exchange pointers with them and it was exactly like those rumours. They had discovered that it was indeed true that the power was far more terrible than the ordinary spirit energy that they had.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her gaze and was silent for a moment. She slowly said, “Everyone from the Dark Regions had taken Jun Wu Yao’s blood before. His blood can change the spirit energy in them and.... A majority of the members of the Night Regime cannot considered to be an ordinary person anymore.”
