Chapter 2432: To Whom Was The Heaven Going to Give Its Mercy (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Xie Changming was still grabbing onto Luo Qingcheng’s sleeves, but once his eyes met Jun Wu Xie’s, all his hair stood on its end at that moment. His whole body started to tremble involuntarily as if there was an electric current flowing through it. He didn’t even have the guts to look at her, not even once.

Luo Qingcheng flung Xie Changming’s hand off and glared at Jun Wu Xie with a dark and gloomy face.

“As expected, this looks right for you.” Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes glanced over Luo Qingcheng. Was there still any glamorousness and elegance seen on the Luo Qingcheng right now?

Half of her face was as horrible as a goblin while the other side of her face was terribly twisted due to her extreme hatred and jealousy, causing her to lose the very last beauty she would ever have. Her clothes looked filthy, stained with the colour of blood. She was no longer the “Lady Qingcheng” who was once standing in the position which was far above everyone anymore.

Luo Qingcheng’s eyes were glaring with malicious hatred. She hated Jun Wu Xie very much and earnestly wished that Jun Wu Xie would die right away in front of her. But the acute pain in her shoulder was reminding her all the time that she was no more an opponent of Jun Wu Xie.

“You bitch! It’s too early for you to be so happy! My Master will definitely avenge you if you kill me! You sure won’t be dying peacefully!” While trembling with her wrath raging all over her body, how Luo Qingcheng wished that she was able to rush forward and tear Jun Wu Xie’s face into pieces.

Remaining silent, Jun Wu Xie just stared at Luo Qingcheng who was going crazy. With her own hands, she had crushed the arrogant of Luo Qingcheng bit by bit into fragments and pushed her into despair, but...

It was still not enough.

It was still far from being enough.

Luo Qingcheng’s life wasn’t even enough to pay back the deaths of Yan Bu Gui and Ren Huang.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t speak any more words to Luo Qingcheng. The only thing she did was just lifting her left hand up with an ice blue Spirit Ring floating around it while exuding a fascinating light.

She still remembered the moment before Ren Huang exploded himself five years ago. In order to keep her alive, he forced his Spirit Ring out of his body and transferred it into Jun Wu Xie’s body to stabilize her life, but nobody would ever think that the Spirit Ring would blend itself into Jun Wu Xie’s body and become another energy of hers.

Jun Wu Xie slightly flicked the tip of her finger. The ice blue Spirit Ring left her hand and expanded in the mere moment, trapping the whole person of Luo Qingcheng inside the Spirit Ring.

Luo Qingcheng couldn’t resist the Spirit Ring. Her Spirit Ring was earlier being depleted when the reversal array was activated. Jun Wu Xie was originally stronger than her. There was no way for her to fight against the upcoming fate.

Luo Qingcheng was fettered by the Spirit Ring with blue lights floating around her.

All of a sudden, numbers of thunderbolts flashed out of the Spirit Ring!

One after another, cracks of thunder struck on the body of Luo Qingcheng!

“Arghhhhhhh!” Shrilling scream came out of the mouth of Luo Qingcheng at the moment. The extreme pain brought to her by the thunderstrike had caused her entire body to twitch and collapse on the ground. She tried hard to get herself up and stand still but the pain was so strong to the point that every inch of her skin and every bundle of her nerves seemed to be suffering a huge torment at this very moment!

Luo Qingcheng’s clothes which were already messy and dirty and was shredded into pieces after the storm of the thunder lights. Wherever had the lightning struck onto, pieces of charred black were stamped on the skin of Luo Qingcheng, making her white soft skin to turn into hideous burnt skin.

Xie Changming who was a few steps away from Luo Qingcheng was totally dumbfounded by the things that happened in front of him. He was being scared out of his wits, causing both his legs to totter and he then fell on the ground. With his eyes widened in horror, he looked at Luo Qingcheng who was trapped in the Spirit Ring crying painfully with her body twitching here and there. He couldn’t actually believe that the miserable woman in front of him was Luo Qingcheng, who was supposed to be the top of the Top Ten Experts of the Upper Realm...
