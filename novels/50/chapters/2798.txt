Bai Zhu was really doomed this time. If he had known that Jun Wu Xie was a Dual Spirit Ring exponent, he would never lead anyone to attack Sea Spirit City. He would definitely be the first person to please Jun Wu Xie and garner her support.

The force of The Dual Spirit Ring had surpassed the power that they could use to suppress it. The strength and capability of Jun Wu Xie would soon attract the attention of His Lord. His Lord would never question the struggle of the 72 cities. The only thing he cared about was the power of the Upper Realm. Only when it reaches a certain level of strength, it could then draw the attention of His Lord and as long as it was a power that catches the eyes of His Lord, all would be closely surrounded by His Lord.

That had higher status than other City Lords.

Thinking of offending Jun Wu Xie by now, Bai Zhu was extremely regretful. He even complained about why Jun Wu Xie did not show all her strength at the Banquet of Heroes that day. If he had known this, what else would he have to do? Continue on struggling?

It was not only Bai Zhu who was shocked by the news of the Dual Spirit Rings. During the retreat of the 72 cities, the commanders of each city had already passed the news back to their respective cities. It was estimated that at this moment, in 72 cities, many City Lords like Bai Zhu would regret and vomit blood.

Compared to Bai Zhu’s vomited blood, Duan Qi’s reaction was a bit weird. After the fright on her face had faded, she recovered her calmness, and looked at Bai Zhu, whose face was extremely ugly: “Is Lord Bai afraid?”

Bai Zhu turned back and looked at Duan Qi, his heart suddenly moved, immediately got up and knelt down in front of Duan Qi.

“Aunt Duan, please save me!”

Duan Qi said: “Save you? How do I save you? Do you want me to fight against the Dual Spirit Ring? Not to mention that even I don’t have that kind of strength. His Lord will know this person. This person was so powerful that he will surely be known by His Lord. How can I offend the person whom His Lord wants? ”

Bai Zhu quickly said: “Aunt Duan you have misunderstood! I never thought of asking you to turn against Yan Hai. I know Yan Hai’s capability. I understand my past behaviours and approach are ridiculous. But now that the big mistake has been made, I want to redeem myself. I am afraid that the Lord Yan will not be happy to see my face. So ... I wish to seek help from Aunt Duan to be a middleman for me and tell Lord Yan that I know that I am in the wrong and will repent. If Lord Yan can forgive me, I will lead the entire White Night City to apologise to him and follow his lead in future.

Bai Zhu was really afraid to offend Jun Wu Xie. The consequences were unimaginable, and the army of the 72 cities had cut off his retreat route. Only by seeking Duan Qi’s help maybe was a turnaround for him.

Duan Qi did not immediately respond to Bai Zhu’s words, but just squinted her eyes and thoughtfully looked at Bai Zhu.

“Aunt Duan please save me, save the White Night City! As long as Aunt Duan is willing to help me,I will send a generous gift to thank you for your great grace.” Bai Zhu begged.

Duan Qi sighed and said, “By the way, I came here per Lord Gu Ying’s request. Now that you have decided to give up, it’s just that I don’t know if the Lord Yan would do me this favor.”

“Thank you, Aunt Duan!” Bai Zhu thanked her quickly.

Duan Qi raised her eyes, but with her own thoughts in her eyes.

“Since you said so, do other City Lords have the same intention as well?”
