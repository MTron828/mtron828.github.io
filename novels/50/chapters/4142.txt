In less than a second, Nangong Lie stiffened, thunderstruck and bolted to the ground as his entire body started shivering and the fear that was forcibly suppressed in his heart suddenly surged out at this moment!

That petite and slender figure overlapped with that nightmare in his memory!

It was her?!!

Nangong Lie couldn’t believe his eyes, he thought he saw a vague familiar figure flash by the seaside just ahead!

His mind seemed to have exploded and subconsciously, he wanted to take a closer look at it but when he looked intently, he realized that the sudden appearance of that shadow of a figure had disappeared without a trace.

Was it an illusion?

Nangong Lie covered his chest and shook his head vehemently, wondering if he had hallucinated...

But that elusive figure seemed so real that he couldn’t ignore it.

Was it real? Or was it an illusion?

While Nangong Lie was still stunned and confused by the seaside, Jun Wu Xie who had walked by the seashore had returned to the manor to tease Lord Meh Meh and the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit...

Jun Wu Xie ignored Guan Hu and others in the Sea Spirit City for three whole days. No matter how much fuss Guan Hu and the rest had kicked up, Jun Wu Xie acted as if she did not receive any news at all.

Guan Hu and the others had never been treated so coldly before and they were on the verge of leaving with rage. If it was not for the fact that Nangong Lie did not agree with the notion of war, they would already have brought all their people to storm down the City Lord’s manor and wash it with blood first thing in the morning!

“What kind of attitude is this? It has been three days and yet your City Lord still hasn’t come to greet me?! What does he mean by this!” Guan Hu bellowed fiercely at a member of the Night Regime.

A hint of disdain flashed by the eyes of this man, but on the surface, he had on a face full of apprehension as he said nervously: “No ... it’s not that our City Lord who doesn’t want to see you, but ... the City Lord said that because Master Nangong has been reluctant to meet... So, he doesn’t know how to arrange it... After all, Master Nangong is one of the Top Ten Masters. If he did not meet Master Nangong and met you directly instead, if Master Nangong found out about it ... I’m afraid ... ”

This was the first time the members of the Night Regime loosened their mouths, but this was also what Jun Wu Xie ordered them to say.

Guan Hu originally wanted to explode, but the people of the Night Regime actually dragged Nangong Lie out as a shield and this made him speechless ...

Among them, the status of Nangong Lie was the most honorable. It didn’t matter how many of them were here, even if they changed it to their City Lord, in front of Nangong Lie, they could only give way.

Jun Wu Xie’s remark was indeed true. In principle, she should first call on Nangong Lie.

Even if he had been ignored for three days, he had to suppress his inner anger and admit it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He couldn’t say anything, otherwise if it was passed on to Nangong Lie’s ears, would he still have his life?

Nangong Lie who was scared by the flashing figure on the seashore that night and was currently drenched in cold sweat had no idea that he had been dragged out once again by Jun Wu Xie as a shield, and directly suppressed the resentment of Guan Hu.

When Liu Yi and others realized that they could not invite Nangong Lie so arbitrarily, they were afraid that it would be difficult to see Jun Wu Xie when they suddenly received a piece of news...

Nangong Lie had fallen ill ...

Suddenly, he had fallen ill ...

By the time Liu Yi met Nangong Lie, Nangong Lie’s face was as white as a sheet and looked a little dazed.
