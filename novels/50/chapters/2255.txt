Chapter 2256: Searching（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The collapsed forest looked as if it had been hit by a tsunami, devastation could be seen everywhere. The thick trunks had been smashed broken by rocks and debris was everywhere. Looking at the damage of the trees, this should have happened within a month.

Qu Ling Yue and that youth walked into the mountains with a team following close behind, even though it had been a long time, but they could still smell the faint scent of blood the moment they entered the mountains.

Within a month, despite the torrential rainfall and strong winds, it still could not wash away all that blood that had seeped deep into the ground. One could imagine what had happened here before.

“Fei Yan, take some people and look around.” Qu Ling Yue’s heart started to beat furiously as a strong sense of uneasiness manifested in her heart. They had received the news from Jun Wu Xie over a month ago, from the Lower Realm to the Middle Realm, they had been rushing on the road without rest. After finally reaching the Middle Realm, they had only met up with Tian Ze and a disciple from the Spirit Jade Palace. After that, they had rushed all the way up to Mount Fu Yao but the Cloudy Brook Academy was completely deserted and devoid of life. However, all the remnants of the battle, from the blood stains and broken pavilions had made them feel extremely worried.

They could not find any trace of Jun Wu Xie and they could only search separately in the vicinity of Mount Fu Yao without stop.

Qu Ling Yue and Fei Yan had teamed up in search of Jun Wu Xie, along the way, their hearts were tormented. They wanted to find her yet they were afraid that if they found her, the results would not be what they wanted.

Fei Yan nodded silently, even for his optimistic personality, at the moment he could not even force out half a smile.

With a heavy and depressed heart, they split up and started their search.

After searching for half a day, from when the sun was hanging in the mid-sky till it set, they still could not find anything.

Fei Yan was somewhat depressed, that lingering stench of blood had constantly reminded him that something big had happened here. He harboured some hopes but yet he hoped that there would be no result this time round. It had been so long, yet the stench of blood had still not dispersed. He hoped that the blood did not belong to Jun Wu Xie and her people, at the same time, he hoped that perhaps they had been injured and were temporarily hiding.

His heart was in turmoil, as he searched for traces all around.

“It’s you!” A voice suddenly rang out from behind him.

Fei Yan turned around immediately and saw a ragged, dirty lady looking at him in surprise.

However, this person was not the person Fei Yan was looking for.

“You are?” Fei Yan looked at her with query.

That lady’s eyes sparkled and when she saw Fei Yan, she had thrown away the wild fruits that she had picked.

“I... I am a disciple of the Spirit Jade Palace! I’ve seen you before! You are... Young Miss Jun’s companion!”

Fei Yan’s heart skipped a beat!

Spirit Jade Palace? Young Miss Jun!

Almost in an instant, Fei Yan rushed to that lady’s side and with trembling hands and widened eyes, he asked: “You are a disciple of the Spirit Jade Palace? Have you seen Wu Xie? Where is she?”

That lady was startled by Fei Yan’s reaction and was nervous for a moment. Only after some time did she return from her stupor, with a trembling voice, she said: “We..we..we don’t know where Young Miss Jun is...we ...”

That lady was nervous as she continued on her story while stammering. She revealed to him all that had happened on that fateful day and her words were like thunderclap to him as he stood rooted to the spot in shock.

Jun Wu Yao had been captured? Jun Wu Xie’s Grandmaster had sacrificed himself?!

What...what happened in the end!!!!!
