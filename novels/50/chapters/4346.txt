“Asshole!” Fei Yan roared. At the moment of roaring, a gush of blood spurted from his mouth. A severe pain spread throughout his body in an instant. The pain was like gnawing in the bone marrow. Here, each of his bones felt as if it was about to crack.

Huge sweat beads covered Fei Yan’s forehead. For a moment, his clothes were wet.

“Boy, don’t be so agitated. Don’t you know that I’m one of the best at poisoning among the Top Ten Experts? So what if you can take one blow from me? Even if I stop my next shot, the poison in you is enough to send you to hell. Tell you honestly, the more you stimulate the spirit energy in your body, the faster the poison will spread. If you don’t want to die so early, stay there and don’t move, maybe wait for me to finish enjoying this little beauty. After that I will give you a good death. “Fang Jinghe said wildly. At this moment, he had already stepped forward towards Rong Ruo who was behind Fei Yan.

Fei Yan could only bow his body. By moving his fingers, his bones felt broken.

His eyes were covered with blood. He stared fiercely at Fang Jinghe, who was approaching step by step.

Fang Jinghe looked disdainfully at the seriously injured and poisoned Fei Yan when he passed him. He sneered, lifted his feet, kicked Fei Yan and he flew out.

“Good for nothing, don’t learn to block the path like a dog.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Fei Yan fell onto the ground, every cell on his body was screaming in pain. He resisted the severe pain of heartbreaking, raised his head, and watched Fang Jinghe walk in front of Rong Ruo holding out that sinful hand ...

An unprecedented anger exploded in the heart of Fei Yan. He seemed to return back to more than a decade ago. That night when the whole family was slaughtered. He could only peep through a gap in a box where his mother hid him. He watched the people from the Twelve Palaces waved their butcher knives and beheaded his father, his mother and his sister. The red blood spread on the ground, like a blood-red carpet, which printed his eyes red .

Fear, anger, unwillingness, and helplessness filled Fei Yan’s heart that year.

That night, he lost everything.

Because of his weakness.

That night, he became all alone.

Because of his incompetence.

Time seemed to freeze at this moment. Everything before Fei Yan became extremely slow and empty. He could not hear any sound, but could only see Rong Ruo’s pale face. He was quietly enveloped by a faint light. Fei Yan’s body was expanded a little bit, but the invisible light had formed a giant ape-like light body around Fei Yan’s body. The light enclosed Fei Yan in it.

A loud noise exploded in the street.

Fang Jinghe, who was just about to enjoy the little beauty in front of him, became aware that a mighty force was striking him at a rapid speed. He subconsciously withdrew from it. In the blink of an eye, a black shadow hit the slate where he was, it turned black with a huge dent. Cobweb-like cracks were all around the dent on the slate. The cracks kept expanding and continuously spread outwards, as if even the whole earth shook with it!
