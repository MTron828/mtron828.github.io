Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Su Ya wanted to pull Jun Wu Xie, but she couldn’t move a single bit. The vines that were wrapped around her were so warm and gentle.

Ba He narrowed his eyes and looked at Jun Wu Xie who had suddenly appeared as his eyes saw through her strength.

“It’s only a little brat who hasn’t even reached the Gold Spirit, to repay blood with blood, to pay a tooth for a tooth? How outrageous! Did you think that ...you, can actually save them?!” Ba He scoffed as his gaze swept towards the little old man and said, “Alright then, since you are Su Ya’s disciple, today, I shall send the three generations of Masters and disciples to hell!”

With one hand, Ba He waved and the Gold Spirits who had retreated had immediately stepped forward once more and surrounded the little old man.

The little old man’s gaze sharpened and the flames in his eyes that had disappeared before had once again been ignited. After Su Ya had been rescued, he no longer had any qualms left. Never would he have thought that Jun Wu Xie would appear here, not to mention, in less than two years, she was almost ready to step into the realm of the Gold Spirits. At such a young age, this was simply too astounding that would make people stare with wide eyes with their tongues tied. If it was another place with different set of opponents, she would definitely create a miracle.

Miracles, however, would not appear here.

“Little brat, bring your Master away. Leave the things here to me.” The little old man said in a heavy tone.

In Jun Wu Xie’s hands, the vines from the Face of Selvan turned into two swords of light. It glistened brilliantly under the sun.

“Please forgive me for not complying.”

The little old man gave a glimpse of surprise, even though he was taken aback by the growth of Jun Wu Xie, but the ones that were standing right in front of them were a thousand Gold Spirits from the Upper Realm! With the current strength of Jun Wu Xie, there was no way she could confront them. If she stayed behind, she was simply seeking her own death!

“‘Since I’ve already acknowledged my Master, and entered into discipleship, if I abandon my Master’s Master and escape on my own, that would make me a cowardly disciple. How could I be worthy to call her Master then?” Jun Wu Xie said with determination, since she was here, she had no intention of escaping. Today, if not for her death, it would be Ba He’s!

Shock appeared the eyes of the little old man. Never would he have thought that Jun Wu Xie had came with such unwavering determination.

Suddenly, the little man laughed loudly.

“Good, good, good. This old man did not judge wrongly, Little Ya also did not misjudge you. What a good kid, you have proven yourself to have an excellent disciple of Little Ya! From today on, this old bones here will fight with you to the end!” An ice blue light suddenly shrouded his entire body as a strong air flow started to circulate all around as the surrounding air began to distort.

“This disciple obeys!” A cold glint flashed by her eyes and the vines that were wrapped around Su Ya was cut off and she flew downwards!

The moment when Su Ya fell, a fiery red figure jumped into the air and caught her securely.

The Sacrificial Blood Rabbit had revealed its true form and held Su Ya gently with its large ears and with its powerful hind legs, it thumped hard and immediately bolted out from the centre of the battlefield! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Want to escape? Not so easy!” Ba He’s eyes flashed maliciously and with a stomp of his foot, he flew up and chased!

Just as his figure flew into the air, a silver streak of light rushed towards him!

A resounding bang reverberated throughout the entire summit of Mount Fu Yao!

With a light sword in each hand, Jun Wu Xie blocked Ba He’s way. Her slender figure stood valiantly in mid air and she had blocked Ba He with her light swords and refused to budge an inch!

“Damn brat, are you looking for death?” Ba He gritted his teeth furiously and looked at Jun Wu Xie who was blocking his path. He did not expect that a mere Silver Spirit would actually dare to obstruct him!
