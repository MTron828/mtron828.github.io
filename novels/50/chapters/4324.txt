Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Yao had seen Jun Gu’s and Han Zi Fei’s love for Jun Wu Xie. The kind of happiness that came naturally was different from just love, but it also exudes warmth and it made others reluctant to look away.

It was also from that moment that Jun Wu Yao would inadvertently imagine that if he and Little Xie had children, would he be a qualified father like Jun Gu?

For this, Jun Wu Yao was a little uneasy, so ...

The unlucky Bai Mo had automatically delivered himself to the door and was picked up by Jun Wu Yao to practice...

“Nothing, if you like it, keep it.” Jun Wu Xie glanced at Bai Mo who was stiffly standing by the side.

Only Jun Wu Yao and her were capable of arranging such a matter on a Spirit Ring exponent so casually.

Jun Wu Yao smiled, he knew that his Little Xie understood him.

The one who felt most melancholy about the entire matter was Bai Mo.

Since he was powerless to resist, he could only accept fate.

Jun Wu Yao didn’t torture Bai Mo any further after asking him to call them Father and Mother twice. He then sealed Bai Mo’s spirit with dark spirit and tied him with a rope and threw him in the room next to them.

Looking silently at Jun Wu Yao’s simple and rude means, Jun Wu Xie suddenly felt the need for such practice.

Anyway, this was a cheap son they had picked up halfway, if it were their own son was so tied up and thrown away ...

Jun Wu Xie did not know why but she suddenly felt a trace of sorrow for the children who had yet arrived to this world.

“Bai Mo’s temperament looks strange, but he is not a full-blown villain. He is a paranoid who focuses on himself. He is very interested in improving his strength but is scared of death. For the time being, there will be no trouble.” After Jun Wu Yao had played a Father’s role, he reached out and took Jun Wu Xie into his arms. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

From the moment Bai Mo recognized him, he would not be able to let him go. Thanks to Bai Mo’s face, he could also be used by Jun Wu Yao to practice. Else, he would have been in a different place.

“Mn.” Jun Wu Xie nodded, naturally she thought of this.

“But ...” Jun Wu Yao’s words suddenly changed in a different direction, “Our child’s appearance must be much better than his, and his talents and qualifications are definitely much better than him. Now, we could only make do with this. . ”

Jun Wu Yao’s tone was full of expectations for his future children, and he did not conceal his disdain towards Bai Mo...

If Bai Mo who was next door knew that Jun Wu Yao had disliked him to be his son, he must have cried hard.

To think that he was a Spirit Ring exponent who possessed the ability to single out the Top Ten Experts, but was arrested by a Father maniac figure who threatened him to be his son ... Who could understand this hardship?

“I don’t want to let him be born in such a world.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were lowered. Because the twists and turns in the previous life made her more careful with her future children. The current Upper Realm was more dangerous than the world in her previous life. Even if it’s more dangerous, she was unwilling and would not let her child be born in times of danger.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie, and the smile on the corner of his mouth was a little deeper. He held Jun Wu Xie’s small face and said firmly: “Okay, let me work with you to build a world for us. The world where our children can be born! ”

She wanted to give their child the best of everything, and how could he disagree?
