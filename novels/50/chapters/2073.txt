Nalan Shan then stared with his eyes fixed unwaveringly at Wu Jiu.

“Remember what you just said.”

“I remember it very clearly.” Wu Jiu said with a light laugh and then gave Jiang Yun Long a signal with his eyes. Without caring whether Nalan Shan was willing or not, Jiang Yun Long then clamped the Soul Binding Chains upon Nalan Shan’s wrists.

“Uncle Master Nalan, shall we?” Jiang Yun Long said gleefully as he gave Nalan Shan a push.

Nalan Shan glanced at him but did not shift his feet a single step.

Jiang Yun Long seemed to become a little impatient, cursing inwardly that Nalan Shan was just struggling in vain before everyone. He had already fallen into his Master’s hands and he was still acting all high and mighty here. Wait till they put him in the dungeons and he will need to be taught a good lesson to vent out all this frustration.

“Hurry up and not waste everyone’s time.” Jiang Yun Long stretched his hand out in impatience, pushing Nalan Shan roughly on the shoulder.

Suddenly!

A Heaven shaking roar of a bear shot up into the sky.

Several huge figures came shooting out from among the masses of spirits, to charge straight towards where Nalan Shan was standing! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yun Long’s heart quivered, quickly pulling himself away from Nalan Shan.

“Roar!” The massive brown bear stood blocking right in front of Nalan Shan, to face the hastily retreating Jiang Yun Long and to let out a furious and rage filled roar.

Beside Nalan Shan, with the brown bear leading them, were four other Beast Spirits circling around Nalan Shan. They were all in a defensive stance, and it was clear that they wanted to ensure Nalan Shan’s safety.

In the instant that Wu Jiu saw the brown bear, he immediately shot to his feet from the chair. Great delight brewed in his eyes and his hands were trembling with ecstatic excitement as he stared at the roaring brown bear where he then laughed out loud hysterically all of a sudden.

“Hahaha! Nalan Shan, Nalan Shan. See how stupid you are. You thought you could protect the beast but had not thought that the beast would care so much for you that it could not even wait a single moment before running all the way here to come save you. This is so funny it’s killing me.” Wu Jiu was really laughing uninhibitedly without restraint. He had thought to capture Nalan Shan in order for him to force the Spiritual Bear out and that it would be at least a few days before that would happen. Never had he thought that when Nalan Shan had barely just stepped in here today, that Spiritual Bear would immediately come deliver itself straight to his door. How could Wu Jiu not be delighted by that?

Nalan Shan looked at Brownie and the several Beast Spirits who had suddenly appeared, his eyes not showing the slightest bit of surprise, looking like he already knew that this would be the result all along. Looking at Brownie who was roaring incessantly, Nalan Shan raised his hands that were restrained by the Soul Binding Chains and rubbed Brownie on its head as he said gently: “It’s alright. Don’t go hurting your throat.”

Brownie then calmed down under Nalan Shan’s touch. It turned its head and looked obediently at Nalan Shan, immediately stopping its roaring.

Wu Jiu laughed scornfully and his gaze turned to sweep over the surprised Beast Spirits all around. “My Beast Spirit friends. Look clearly here. Is this brown bear here your Spiritual Bear?”

Coming to know that Brownie that was standing beside Nalan Shan was the target that Wu Jiu was seeking to capture, all the Beast Spirits turned their heads to gaze upon the bear, like they were going to stare holes right through Brownie’s body.

The brown fur did not possess the golden lustre of the Spiritual Bear, and though massive, it did not exude any powerful aura from its power of the spirit. The mass of Beast Spirits shook their heads inwardly. This was not their Spiritual Bear. Their Spiritual Bear was not so weak.

The reactions of the Beast Spirits fell into the eyes of Wu Jiu, and Wu Jiu’s eyes then showed a gleeful glint.

He had dared to have so many spirits gather here today because he was certain that the Spiritual Bear whose power of the spirit had been mostly absorbed by the Serene Spirit Tower would not be able to show up in a state that exemplified the Spiritual Bear, and that the current state of the Spiritual Bear would look to be just an unremarkable brown bear Beast Spirit in everyone’s eyes.
