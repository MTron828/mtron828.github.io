“Senior Zi Fei... I don’t think I’ve seen her today,” said Rong Ruo.

Han Zi Fei usually woke up early, and they could always see her playing with the little Sea Spirit Beasts in the yard of the city palace early in the morning. However, she hadn’t showed up today.

“I’ll go and find her,” said Fei Yan.

However, before Fei Yan left the back hall, Jun Wu Yao had already come walking in.

“You don’t need to go,” said Jun Wu Yao.

“Big Brother Wu Yao,” Fei Yan stunned slightly.

Jun Wu Yao’s gaze looked straight at Jun Wu Xie. It seemed like there was something inscrutable in the pair of his purple eyes.

“Zi Fei has already left last night as she has something to deal with. She has asked me to come and say farewell to you guys.” Naturally, Jun Wu Yao walked to the side of Jun Wu Xie.

“She has left?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao, surprised, “What happened to Senior Zi Fei? She left so suddenly.”

She left so suddenly that she didn’t even have the time to say goodbye.

Unknowingly why, there was an inexplicable sense of loss suddenly emerging from Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

Jun Wu Yao could only sigh inwardly while watching Jun Wu Xie’s reaction without showing any emotions on his face. He lifted his hand up and gently rubbed on Jun Wu Xie’s small little head as he said, “Zi Fei is from the Upper Realm, and the reason she comes back this time, besides being invited by you to the Upper Realm, she has something which she needs to deal with by herself. I’m sure she has already thought about it carefully before deciding to leave. If she needs help, she’ll tell us, but if she doesn’t say anything, we’ll just cause her trouble if we go and ask her.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Without having further thoughts, Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. She too, had a really independent character, and hence, she wouldn’t specifically doubt Han Zi Fei’s behaviour.

“If that so, ask everyone to keep an eye out so that we can reach out to Senior Zi Fei in time whenever she needs help,” said Jun Wu Xie while looking at Jun Wu Yao. Even she herself had failed to realize that the way she cared for Han Zi Fei had gone a little too much.

However, Jun Wu Yao’s eyes did not miss to catch all of these. While smiling, there was a trace of helplessness coming out from his eyes. Even though both the mother and the daughter did not acknowledge each other, it still wouldn’t cut off the imperceptible induction between the consanguinity no matter what.

“I’ll inform them.”

Jun Wu Xie gave a slight hum as her response.

“Since Senior Zi Fei has left, you’ll need to tell me about the information of the Sea Spirit Beast, Little Xie.” Hua Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie. Besides Han Zi Fei, the person who knew about the Sea Spirit Beast the most should be Jun Wu Xie.

“Alright, I’ll tell you letter,” Jun Wu Xie responded.

“What are you planning to do? Seems like you guys are doing something big.” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie serious side profile with a trace of a smile gushing out from the bottom of his eyes. Just by looking at her, he was already able to know that this small little lady was going to do something big and earth-shattering.

Of course, Jun Wu Xie had then told everything about her plan to Jun Wu Yao without hiding any contents.

After listening to her plan, Jun Wu Yao couldn’t hold himself from letting out his laughter.

“Only you’ll do such crazy things.”

Inciting the wrath of the seventy-two cities just by using the Sea Spirit City, the only weapon they got in their hands. Exactly whose insanity and extremity had this girl resembled from?

“Isn’t that good?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows.

Jun Wu Yao chuckled and responded, “Yeah yeah yeah, every decision you make is good.”

To ensure that Xu Zu and his people were able to “find out” the rumors before they left the city, Jun Wu Yao immediately called Ye Gu, Ye Sha and Ye Mei and placed his order regarding Jun Wu Xie’s plan, whereas the Ghost Army was still remaining their original acting style, which was mainly moving in the dark.
