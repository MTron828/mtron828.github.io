2975 Stronger as a team 1

A long time after Jun Wu Xie’s departure, the deathly silence still did not disappear. The bloody smell lingered in their noses and it wasas if it was telling everyone that death was so close to them.

No one would care about the Top Ten Experts and how they died. After recovering their senses, the crowd immediately ran away from the arena. They could no longer bear the suffocating blood smell.

Qing Ke walked for a long time before he left the arena. When left the arena and went to see Long Yao, he found out that Long Yao long disappeared.

After leaving the arena, Jun Wu Xie went directly to the place arranged by Nangong Lie.

The blood stench on her was too strong. Within the Sacred City, everyone who walked passed her stepped back subconsciously.

When she reached almost the end of the alley, the black cat came out of Jun Wu Xie’s body. It shook its tail, and slipped onto Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder.

The black cat had a strange feeling towards the current Jun Wu Xie. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, they returned to that night, the night where everything was burned down.

“Mistress,” the black cat whispered.

Jun Wu Xie’s footsteps did not stop.

“Everyone will be okay. Maybe we will defeat His Lord and find the Soul Tree. Maybe the Soul Tree has a way to save Rong Ruo.” The black cat said carefully. It was clearer than anyone that Jun Wu Xie’s hate came more from the death of Rong Ruo.

That kind of irreparable, sad thing.

Jun Wu Xie’s footsteps paused and looked up at the sky. She was in deep thoughts.

In the room, Bai Mo was restlessly pacing up and down. He glanced around the room. When he saw Drunk Lotus and the rest were taking care of Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo, his eyes finally fell on Jun Wu Yao at the side.

“Ye Jue, you’re so assured to actually let Yan Hai go alone? Long Yao had the intention to take his life.” Bai Mo muttered helplessly.

Jun Wu Yao raised his eyes slightly and looked at Bai Mo. “Your mother is much stronger than you think.”

“...” Bai Mo opened his mouth and wondered whether he should have cursed Jun Wu Yao instead.

Just as Bai Mo was thinking whether to slip out to take a look, the door suddenly opened.

Jun Wu Xie smothered in the smell of blood appeared before Bai Mo.

Bai Mo had just wanted to come forward and say something, but he was instantly stiffened by the dark aura on Jun Wu Xie’s body. If Jun Wu Yao had already restored his spirit energy, with his dark energy, it was enough to make him faint.

“How is their condition?” Jun Wu Xie had no thoughts at this moment and no longer wanted to bother about the smell on her body. After entering the room, she immediately looked at Drunk Lotus and her other Ring Spirits.

Plant Ring Spirits had certain natural healing powers. Although Blood Velvet was not as powerful as Little Lotus, they could heal the damaged veins. Before Jun Wu Xie left, she summoned all the six Ring Spirits to guard beside Hua Yao and the others.

“It’s pretty stable.” Crystal Orchid wiped Fan Zhuo’s cheek gently as he replied.

“Mm.” The corpse flower suddenly made a muffled sound, pointing to Fei Yan sitting next to him.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes turned to Fei Yan. His injuries were not minor and were even more serious than Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo’s. He was the one who should rest the most.
