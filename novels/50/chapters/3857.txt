Chapter 2453: The Cute Lord Jue (7)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

This was not a suitable place for them to stay for a long time. For the sake of their lives, they should just leave quickly!

When Jun Xian returned to the manor, he saw Jun Qing sitting pathetically on the stairs in front of the entrance together with a group of the guards from the Rui Lin Army. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jun Xian slightly stunned. He stepped forward and asked. “Why are you guys sitting here?”

Jun Qing raised his eyes, seemingly about to cry. The slight movement of his had caused the treasures in his arms to make several clanking sounds. Under the illumination of the candle light, his arms were full of white jades, gemstones and gold.

“Father...”

Jun Xian was a little surprised. He then noticed that these people who were sitting in front of the entrance were each carrying a pile of treasures, as if they had just robbed the Exchequer.

Beside the one Rui Lin Army who was sitting at the very end, there was a round and fat Hell Rodent pulling out a jade which it spat half way out from its mouth with its two tiny little claws. Its big round eyes glanced covertly over the Rui Lin Army who was holding on an apathetic expression beside it. It then craftily sneaked the jade into his arms before it continued to pull things out from its mouth.

“What’s going on?” Jun Xian was totally confused.

“These are the betrothal gifts given by Lord Jue.” Ye Gu moved a step forward and spoke in an especially formal manner.

“Betrothal gifts?” Jun Xian couldn’t make it out at all. Just at the moment he decided to move forward and open the entrance door, there suddenly came a loud shout from Jun Qing.

“Don’t open the door!”

However, it was still too late for him as Jun Xian had already pulled open the tightly closed door.

The moment the door was opened, those shiny and dazzling treasures were like the tides, gushing out from the inside of the door!

Ye Gu reacted immediately by straight off pulling Jun Xian to aside, away from the “dangerous site”.

With a continual cackling sound, there were treasures lying all over the floor behind the door.

Jun Xian then found out that all the space of the mansion had already been fully occupied by these treasures. With just a quick look, it was as if they had entered the treasury of the richest country in the world.

“Father, when are we going home? We can’t stay here anymore.” Jun Qing looked at Jun Xian with a bitter smile. He thought that all they needed to do was just to happily organize and prepare the ceremony for Jun Wu Xie’s marriage but they did not expect Jun Wu Yao to do something like this. Well, and now, they could no longer stay at this place anymore.

With the corners of his lips twitching a little, Jun Xian could only order all the people in the mansion to move temporarily into the other houses.

Fortunately, the city where they were staying at had already been emptied out before the battle started. There wasn’t any other resident in the city except for the combatants, or else... all of them might need to sleep on the streets tonight.

Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie were both late to the scene. After receiving the message of them changing their location of lodgings, Jun Wu Yao straight away brought Jun Wu Xie to the mentioned place.

The moment Jun Qing opened the door and saw that it was the two of them who had returned, he smiled bitterly and gave Jun Wu Yao a look. After Jun Wu Xie entered the mansion, only then Jun Wu Yao left.

Inside the mansion, Jun Xian was gently rubbing on the corner of his eyebrow. While looking at Jun Wu Xie who had just returned, he seemed to have something to tell her but he wasn’t sure about the way to start the conversation.

“Little Xie... I think we should... postpone your wedding ceremony... to the time when we return to the Lin Palace,” Jun Xian had no choice but to said. His original plan was to hold the ceremony in the city right away but the betrothal gifts sent by Jun Wu Yao had completely occupied their temporary mansion. And now, it was difficult for them to walk even a step in the mansion, let alone getting married.

Obediently, Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. After all, she wouldn’t have any objection against his suggestion since she didn’t know anything about marriage.

“Just now, where did Wu Yao bring you to?” Jun Xian let out a sigh and changed the topic of the conversation.

“We went to the lake and watch the lanterns,” answered Jun Wu Xie honestly.

“The lake? But there isn’t any lake near the city.” Jun Xian looked puzzled.

“There’s one a hundred miles away from here,” said Jun Wu Xie.

“...” Jun Xian almost couldn’t breathe. The way Jun Wu Yao brought Jun Wu Xie out and flew for a hundred miles was just for them to take a look at a lake?!
