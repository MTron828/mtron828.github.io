Chapter 1120: “Crumble and Fall (1)”

Xiong Ba was stunned for a moment. He did not say anything but just bent his back and bowed deeply to Fan Zhuo. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When Qiao Chu and the others arrived at the Heavenly Cloud Chambers, Jun Wu Xie was tending to Qu Ling Yue’s wounds and when the youths saw the thin and pallid girl lying upon the bed, all of them tacitly did not open their mouths at all so that they would not disturb Jun Wu Xie’s treatment of Qu Ling Yue’s wounds.

They had all thought what Qu Ling Yue was put through really pained the heart but when they really saw how Qu Ling Yue looked now, they realised that what the girl suffered must have been worse than anyone of them could have imagined.

“I think..... I might not hate Qu Wen Hao that much anymore.” Qiao Chu said, rubbing at his nose.

Betrayals were intolerable, but when Qu Wen Hao was forced to witness his own daughter being humiliated in such a manner, he must have completely lost his mind then, and he had only made the only choice a father could have made at that time.

“I hope that she will recover fully.” Rong Ruo said with a frown, her eyes filled with sympathy.

For a full day and night, Jun Wu Xie sat at Qu Ling Yue’s bedside, her treatment of Qu Ling Yue’s wounds never stopping for a moment. It wasn’t till evening the next day, when dusk shone through the window, that the unconscious Qu Ling Yue’s eyes finally fluttered open.

What met her eyes was no longer the dim and dark cell, but an elegantly decorated room. Within the room, a faint fragrance of herbs hung in the air and the pain upon her body had seemingly faded away.

[Is this a dream?]

Qu Ling Yue blinked, staring at the smooth silk draped over the top of the bed.

“You’re awake.” A voice tinged with a slight raspiness sounded in Qu Ling Yue’s ear from the side.

Qu Ling Yue’s heart jumped, struggling a little as she turned her head. Jun Wu Xie’s cold countenance appeared within her eyes.

“Jun Xie.....” Qu Ling Yue immediately felt her face turn hot.

[Why had Jun Xie appeared beside her bed?]

In a panic, Qu Ling Yue wanted to bury her head under the blanket but when she lifted her hand and tried to pull the covers, a sharp pain suddenly shot through her from her wrist.

She saw very clearly that her two wrists, were wrapped up with rounds and rounds of bandages, the glaring white a huge contrast against the welts and bruises on the rest of her arms, which was like a sudden bolt of thunder, that woke her up rudely from her beautiful sweet dream!

Those long nights of unimaginable horrors and torment, the memories of those unthinkable scenes, surged like the tide into her mind. Her eyes flared wide open, the terrifying memories that drove her into despair, immediately threw her into a cold and freezing lake!

“Argh! ! !”

[That wasn’t a dream!]

[That had all been real!]

Qu Ling Yue’s emotions fluctuated between the extremes once more and she struggled in a fluster to try sit up, wrapping herself up tightly within the blanket, not willing to give Jun Xie another glance!

“Leave! Just leave!” Like an injured little beast, Qu Ling Yue did not want to see anybody, especially Jun Xie.

She had become like this. So dirty..... So very filthy.....

She did not want Jun Xie to see her in such a miserable state. She would rather that she had died in that cell, then to let her person she treasured so in her heart to see her in her current state.

Jun Wu Xie looked puzzledly at Qu Ling Yue. Initially, Qu Ling Yue’s emotions had already recovered to normal but in an instant, she had broken down and crumbled once again, the helpless screams coming out from her, were so pitiful to hear.

Jun Wu Xie’s brows creased together as Qu Ling Yue incessant violent struggles had once again split the wounds she had just bandaged up and the blood had seeped through the bandages, showing up as bright red stains.

“Do not look at me..... I beg you..... Do not..... Do not look at me.....” Qu Ling Yue begged tearfully as she buried herself within the blanket, her entire body shaking in fear.
