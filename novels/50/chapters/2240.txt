The strength of the Spirit Ring is determined by the number of inscriptions condensed. Ren Huang had boasted himself as one of the top ten experts in the Upper Realm, but he had never expected that ... Luo Qingcheng’s strength had reached such a height!

To be able to actually use the Spirit Ring to fly in the sky... This was simply unbelievable!

Luo Qingcheng flew up on the Spirit Ring and confronted Jun Wu Xie in the air. Her deep purple dress fluttered in the wind, as the sun gradually set, that colour had a strange and sinister feel to it.

“At first I did not want to waste my time on such a worthless person like you, however since you’ve come seeking death, I shall fulfil you. You can rest assured that I would leave your corpse intact. If you want to hate someone, don’t hate me, it’s only that someone wants me to catch you back. It’s just that... He doesn’t mind that it’s only your corpse, that is why... After killing you, I’ll take you back to save all the trouble.” Luo Qingcheng’s tone revealed a trace of viciousness, she had on an inexplicit smile that made her look even more frightening.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes.

Who was it that wanted to catch her?

Before this, she had never met Luo Qingcheng before. However, Luo Qingcheng seemed to know her and it led her to think that someone must have told Luo Qingcheng something. And that someone... Who could it be?

A vague figure flashed by her mind but the situation in front of her did not allow her time to delve into it. Luo Qingcheng who was the front of her had already rushed towards her!

It goes without saying that using the Spirit Ring to fly with a person on it would use a large amount of energy.

Surprisingly, Luo Qingcheng’s speed of flight was not inferior compared to the Face of Selvan’s silver wings. In just a few moments, Luo Qingcheng had already rushed towards Jun Wu Xie and at the same time, Jun Wu Xie had changed direction trying to widen the distance between them.

Unless she had no choice, she definitely did not want to get struck by Luo Qingcheng!

Seeing that Jun Wu Xie managed to avoid her strikes, Luo Qingcheng snickered . Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I would like to see how fast you can run.”

Whether it was to fulfil that promise between that person or for the Face of Selvan, Jun Wu Xie must die!

In the depths of Luo Qingcheng’s heart, the moment that she had discovered that the Face of Selvan had appeared in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, she was already determined to kill her. She could not tolerate the fact that there was actually someone who had received the special attention from Jun Wu Yao. She could not let that person live, it seemed as if her very existence was a satire for her.

Mocking her incompetence.

Mocking Jun Wu Yao’s disdain for her!

“Young Miss!” Ye Mei’s heart was in turmoil as he looked at the two figures in the air. At this moment, he could no longer care about anything else. He used his fastest speed and shook off his opponent as he rushed towards the encirclement ahead where Jun Wu Yao was!

Now that things have come to this, the only one who could save Jun Wu Xie was Lord Jue!

Among the thousands of people, each time Jun Wu Yao raised his hand, he had easily taken away several lives. Countless bodies fell around him and have piled up into a little hill. Blood was everywhere and had seeped deep into the ground and the stench of blood was extremely dense. The amount of blood that had flowed into the ground would take many years to be cleansed.

A cold glint flashed by Jun Wu Yao’s eyes, the endless massacre had awoken that blood lust that had remained dormant for so long. Fresh blood spilled and every inch of land around him was saturated with blood and the strong smell had stimulated his senses and it was as if it was trying to smother the uncontrollable beast that was hidden deep in the depths of his heart.
