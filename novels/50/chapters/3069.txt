Chapter 3070 The Frost Goddess 1

CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Between heaven and earth, everything was buried under a layer of snow.

Jun Wu Xie looked up at the woman and was surprised at the terrible power she possessed but she also felt something familiar about the power.

It was obviously bone chillingly cold but also seemed to possess a faint warmth.

“Return my radiant sun!” The woman screamed, exuding a boundless chill.

“This does not seem to be the product of Chaos.” Jun Wu Xie said while looking at the mad woman.

“Little Xie, I don’t sense a physical body, she seems to be some sort of apparition.” Jun Wu Yao said, a theory forming in his mind.

Previously, when Jun Wu Xie returned from the Seven Storey Dream World, she said that she had met many gods and experienced their regrets. The power that this woman possessed did not seem to be of this world, it felt more like....

“God power? But all the gods have fallen, how could there be one in the chaos array?” Jun Wu Xie had her doubts but could not deny the logic of Jun Wu Yao’s theory. Not only did Jun Wu Yao feel this way but she had the same thoughts herself.

The power she was witnessing in front of her had too many similarities with what she had seen from the gods in the Seven Storey Dream World.

The only difference was that the woman in front of them seemed to have gone mad but the gods she encountered before were still in control of themselves.

“Little Xie, if I’m not wrong, this person is the same as the gods you saw previously but there is no body, only the manifestation of her obsession.” Jun Wu Yao said coldly.

Just as they had ascertained her identity, the woman suddenly screamed at them.

“It was you who killed my radiant sun!”

The woman descended from the sky and rushed towards them.

In that same instant, Jun Wu Yao’s Dark Spirit, which surrounded his body, rose rapidly, and brought this icy world into complete darkness.

Jun Wu Xie squinted slightly, raised a hand and a bolt of golden power came out from her fingertip to reinforce Jun Wu Yao.

Rumble!

The two powerful forces collided against each other, like two great beasts locked in a violent battle.

In the next moment, there were constant ripples between the sky and the earth, and monstrous shockwaves swept in all directions. The mountains and rivers in the distance collapsed under the force of the clash.

When faced with this combination of power, a pained expression appeared on the woman’s face, and the madness in the eyes dissipated a little for a moment.

“God....power?”

The impact of two powerful forces quietly touched the woman’s soul. She was slightly shocked, the madness in her eyes gradually faded, and she finally stopped attacking. Beside the gravel, her face was pale and her breath was very weak. She put her hands over her chest as she stared at Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

“You were sent by....the God of Destruction.”

There was pure vitriol in the woman’s voice, the words God of Destruction rolling off her tongue like acid.
