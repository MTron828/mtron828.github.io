3053 Lost divine power 1

However, his decision was resisted by other Gods. The result was a battle of Gods that no one knew about.

It was also from that time that the Gods stayed in the Three Realms and the miracles began to disappear bit by bit. The God who believed in love was defeated, and the God who harnessed the will of destruction won. He could finally use everything in the Three Realms to break the void to master that supreme power.

However... Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At the last moment, that God suddenly found out that to truly break the void, the world they now created was not enough. In addition to the endless souls, he needed the power of other Gods, And ... from the power of another world.

“We’ve all been defeated, trapped in this Seven World of Dreams. He has not killed us, just waiting for the day when all the conditions are put together, to seize our divine powers. I don’t know what method he will use, I don’t have any ability to stop him, but ... you can.” The woman spoke slowly. She used to be one of the Gods from this world. She was defeated because of her poor strength. Her physical body was no longer there, and what appeared in front of Jun Wu Xie was only her Godly thoughts, and the only thing she left in this world.

The battle between the Gods was not imaginable by ordinary people. Even if the God of Destruction won, he could not deprive the power of other Gods to achieve the condition to break through the void, his divine power alone was not enough.

“This Seven World of Dreams, only Gods can set foot in, your soul belongs to the Gods ...” The woman looked at Jun Wu Xie. From her eyes, Jun Wu Xie saw a firm belief.

God ...

Jun Wu Xie trance thought of everything she had seen in the environment of the Soul Tree. The woman in the dream was already herself, but ... she never thought that she would be a God.

“Although I know that this request will be overboard. But ... please save this world, even if you don’t belong here, please, save it for the sake of all lives.” The smile on the woman’s face had dispersed. She put down the paper umbrella, folded her hands and looked at Jun Wu Xie, her eyes full of pleading.

Jun Wu Xie was silent for a moment as she sorted through the immense amount of information that appeared in her.

After a long time, Jun Wu Xie said: “If you don’t say that, I will do the same. Here, there are my loved ones.” Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath, and already had a rough idea in mind.

She realized that all this was a planned game.

It was a God who stood at the pinnacle of the Three Realms who had devised this game of chess. Every step she took was anticipated by that God.

Step by step, to the point where he needed it!

The Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms were just a lure.

The God dressed in human coat stood in the supreme position of the Upper Realms, designed everything, deliberately released the news of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, deliberately led her to step by step to the Upper Realm and deliberately brought her to Seven World of Dreams.

Perhaps, the reason why her soul appeared in this world was also deliberately arranged by that God. Otherwise, she should have died in that explosion long ago.

After she had grasped the situation, Jun Wu Xie completely understood!

“If I didn’t guess wrong, here, I can find my lost divine power, right?” Jun Wu Xie looked at the woman and spoke slowly.
