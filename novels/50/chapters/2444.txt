Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A loud bang sounded!

Jun Wu Yao sprang up from his chair as he stood frozen solid at the spot. That pair of gorgeous purple eyes widen for the very first time.

Jun Qing’s chin dropped to the floor.

Qiao Chu was so shocked that he fell off his chair!

This was too explosive!

Did they not just return from the battlefield? They haven’t even managed to clean off the blood splatters on their bodies, so how did... the topic of marriage come up?!

“Little...” For the first time, a tremble was detected in Jun Wu Yao’s voice. He looked at Jun Wu Xie unbelievably, as emotions in those purple eyes churned like the turbulent waves, and his heart seemed to want to jump out of his throat in an instant.

“Are you willing to marry me or not?” Asked Jun Wu Xie in a straight forward manner, without registering the shock in Jun Wu Yao.

“I’m willing!” Jun Wu Yao replied without a hint of hesitation. An unstoppable sense of excitement exploded and burned within his heart. He could not rein in his emotions and that propelled him to take quick steps towards Jun Wu Xie as he wanted to hug her. However, as he neared her, he only dared touch her shoulders cautiously and his fingertips trembled slightly, as those eyes looked at her with great ecstasy.

“Are you serious? You want to marry me?” For once in his long life, Jun Wu Yao was uncertain of himself.

“If you take me as your wife, I will marry you.” Jun Wu Xie replied calmly, her light words sounded as if she was just discussing the weather.

However, her rather random suggestion lit a fire in Jun Wu Yao that was bordering madness.

“I will marry you!” Jun Wu Yao immediately hugged Jun Wu Xie, his heart was full of unprecedented satisfaction

Hie little fellow says she wants to marry him?!

What in the world is more perfect than this?!

Jun Wu Xie did not make a sound, nor did she protest while being hugged by Jun Wu Yao. The warmth of his body slowly spread across her skin as her face remained buried in his chest, a smile broke where no one could see.

Really such an... idiot.

Jun Xian was the first to recover from his shock after a long moment and eyed the two persons hugging as he cleared his throat in embarrassment.

“Cough.”

Jun Wu Yao seemed to have returned to his senses a little, as he softly released Jun Wu Xie. But his eyes reflected a never before sense of overwhelm.

To get married.

These words to him were so unfamiliar, yet, it brought his so much joy.

Prior to meeting Jun Wu Xie, he never wanted any woman. Being alone had already become a habit, and the appearance of someone would make him feel burdensome.

Only her.

He could not help but wanted to tie her to his person so that she could never leave.

The feeling of gain and loss, Jun Wu Yao definitely experienced it.

The feeling of bittersweetness made people willing to indulge in it, as they were unable to extricate themselves.

“Little Xie, are you serious?” Jun Xian tempered the shock in his heart with much effort. He never expected that his own granddaughter who doesn’t really open her mouth, but when she did, brought such an earth shattering news.

After Jun Xian spoke, Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie nervously, his hands sweating as he held onto her shoulders.

He was waiting, and anticipating. The pair of purple eyes held strong expectations as he looked at the love of his life.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at the slightly lost Jun Wu Yao with a smile in her heart. She turned to look at Jun Xian as she nodded her head casually without flinching.
