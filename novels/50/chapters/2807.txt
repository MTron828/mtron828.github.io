“What? Jun Wu Xie was stunned.

“I am not sure either. I only heard them saying that Han Zi Fei has returned to the Holy Mountain. But I am not sure if Han Zi Fei is a senior..” Ye Gu said.

Jun Wu Xie’s heart thumped a little. Han Zi Fei didn’t say her full name to them. She only said that she was Zi Fei. She was also from The Sacred Maiden Tribe. Ye Gu happened to hear it when he and Zi Fei left. The time was basically the same.

Jun Wu Xie immediately turned to look at Jun Wu Yao. When Han Zi Fei left, the only one who had seen her was Jun Wu Yao.

“It should be her.” Jun Wu Yao knew exactly what Jun Wu Xie wanted to ask.

“Why did she go back?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao inexorably. At that time, Han Zi Fei had exhausted much energy before escaping from the Upper Realm. She hid for thousands of years. After living an easy life, why did she jump back into the fire pit?

Jun Wu Yao lowered his eyes and did not look back at Jun Wu Xie’s gaze. He said lightly: “She goes back and naturally she has what she needs to do.”

Jun Wu Xie’s brow frowned, but she couldn’t calm down.

This was the first time that Han Zi Fei had heard the news after she left. But she did not want to appear abruptly and so shocking. At the same time, another news story had sought Jun Wu Xie’s attention .

That was Han Zi Fei’s marriage.

“Knight of Destruction ...” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly. These four words were extremely sensitive to her. Jun Gu was now one of the knights of destruction. But no one knew which one Duan Qi was referring to...

“Which Knight of Destruction is it?” Jun Wu Xie asked Ye Gu.

Ye Gu shook his head.

“Duan Qi didn’t say, the subordinate didn’t know either.”

“Little Xie, aren’t you worried, the Senior Zi Fei’s marriage partner is ... your father?” Qiao Chu on the side listened for a long time, and finally understood what happened.

And now it made sense and confused people at the same time.

Han Zi Fei suddenly returned back to The Sacred Maiden Tribe and she was about to marry one of the Knights of Destruction. Jun Wu Xie’s father was arrested by the damn Lord to brainwash him to become one of the Knights of Destruction. If it was the same person ... ... Qiao Chu couldn’t imagine how much headache this thing would cause.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t say anything. Hua Yao looked at Qiao Chu from the sides with a slight frown and in them was a trace of blame.

They had thought about this problem. But no one dared to talk about it.

Han Zi Fei was friends with them. She was their most respected predecessor. She was also very gentle towards them. But Jun Gu was Jun Wu Xie’s father ...

If they really ran into each other, it would put Jun Wu Xie in a difficult position.

What Jun Wu Xie wanted was to rescue Jun Gu. If someone else was next to Jun Gu, she could kill him. Now it’s not anyone else but Han Zi Fei. Jun Wu Xie couldn’t make this move.

Moreover, Han Zi Fei’s reason for returning to The Sacred Maiden Tribe was unknown. If she threatens Jun Wu Xie, he will go to the rescue. But ...These two things had never happened before and it was really unexpected. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“For the time being, Duan Qi will definitely come to look for you these days. If you want to know the exact information, just try to ask her.” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie a little bit unbearably. He knew her too well. At that moment, he could not say more with his worrying mind.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly, but her heart was complicated.
