“I’m sorry... I’m so sorry...” Jun Wu Yao couldn’t reach out his hands and hug her. The only thing he could do was just to frown deeply and look helplessly at her trembling in front of him.

His Little Xie shouldn’t be suffering this much pain, but he was the one who...

Jun Wu Xie no longer spoke. All she did was to weep continuously with her shoulders trembling, unwittingly revealing the pain suppressed within her for the past five years.

At first, she thought that she was able to fight beside him, but after all the things that had happened five years ago, she was later exposed to the most cruel reality.

Bloodied and beaten.

With the most brutal way, she was told about her weakness and her patheticness...

Jun Wu Yao had never felt so panicked before. Even if it was that particular day five years ago, he was so sure about all the things that might be happening. He knew that what would be happening after that as everything was never out of his plan.

Except for her.

At this moment, only then Jun Wu Yao realized that with the way he acted during that year, how devastating the pain he brought to Jun Wu Xie was.

He had no courage to speak to her. He could only stare at her quietly with his eyes full of regret and fondness, almost tearing apart the narrow space in the carriage.

After remaining silent for quite a long time, Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and grabbed onto the Soul Binding Chains that were tying on Jun Wu Yao. Without raising her head up, all she did was to just break the chains apart with her bare hands using the energy of her Spirit Rings.

Crack!

The cracking sound of the Soul Binding Chains echoed in the carriage.

The moment he was freed from the chains, Jun Wu Yao couldn’t even stay still for a minute and he immediately pulled that little body of hers into his arms. He hugged her so tightly, as if he was trying to blend her into his bones and blood so that they wouldn’t be separated apart again.

“I’m sorry. It’s all my fault that you suffered this much. Just punish me if you want. Please... don’t cry.” Jun Wu Yao hugged Jun Wu Xie very tightly. He thought that there wasn’t anything for him to be afraid of anymore in this world, but he didn’t realize that her tears would make him so afraid to the point that he felt like it was the end of the world.

He was willing to pay everything he had just for her to not shed even a drop of tear from now on.

With her eyes closed, Jun Wu Xie just let Jun Wu Yao hug her without saying a word. The hug that she had been waiting for so long felt so warm. The breath that belonged to him was so comforting. All of these was real. They were no longer the illusions in her dreams and she would never suffer the despair in her dreams again.

His body temperature was real. His hug was real. His breath... was also real...

Five years had passed and Jun Wu Xie was finally able to once again recall the meaning of being at ease.

It was as if no matter what kind of hardships or powerful enemy they would be facing, there was nothing to be worried about as long as he was beside her.

In the narrow carriage, Jun Wu Yao was quietly hugging his entire world.

It was clear that she had already grown up but it felt like the girl in his arms was still as tiny as the girl in his memory. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He thought that she was strong and persistent enough but he forgot that she was no longer the cold-hearted Jun Wu Xie who was completely isolated from the outside world.

She had learnt about love, passion and also pain.

The girl in his arms was so small that he didn’t dare to put much force in hugging her. It felt like a little more force added would hurt her.

The only thing he could do was just to hug her affectionately while feeling the warmth she brought to him after separating for five years.

This time, he would never let go of her again. No matter what kind of enemy they would be facing in the future, he wouldn’t be leaving her alone to endure everything again.

“I’m sorry.” Though a low and husky voice was heard beside Jun Wu Xie’s ears, she didn’t give any response.

[I’m sorry for letting you to endure everything by yourself for so long.]

[I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have left you.]

[I’m sorry... ]
