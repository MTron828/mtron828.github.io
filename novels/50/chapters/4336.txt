Chapter 2932: A Dangerous Omen (5)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie looked at Fang Jinghe, who was surrounded by guards while walking on the street. This was the person Nangong Lie had mentioned to her in the past. It was this person’s underhanded means in the past that made many people with insufficient strength and ill intent start to think about getting into the Top Ten Exponents by any method necessary.

However...

For any method or any strategy. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The first person to use it was a genius, the second was a fool.

After Fang Jinghe used poison, all who came to participate in the Top Ten Exponents selection would have already taken precautions, and they would rarely fall for the same trick. So the current situation where His Lord changed the rules was really weird. After all, people like Fang Jinghe had only one trick up their sleeves.

“Fang Jinghe can be regarded as the most unscrupulous of the Top Ten exponents, and he is cruel by nature. Anyone who comes up against him must be careful.” said Bai Zhu as he looked at Jun Wu Xie.

“I had heard that he was leaving his residence today, so I invited you, my Lord to come here.”

Bai Zhu appeared as sincere as possible in front of Jun Wu Xie. If it was not for the fact that everyone knew that Bai Zhu colluded with the other city lords of the 72 cities in an attempt to overthrow Jun Wu Xie, people would be totally unaware what a wicked person he was purely based on his actions today.

After all, with Bai Zhu’s handsome appearance and elegant manner, coupled with a calming voice that sounded like flowing water in a gentle stream, it was easy to be charmed by him.

Qiao Chu stared at Bai Zhu secretly, becoming more confused with the more he saw. He really could not figure out what Bai Zhu’s intentions were and could only peek at Bai Mo’s reaction from time to time as a gauge.

However, he found that Bai Mo looked very displeased since he took his seat.

Perhaps Qiao Chu was staring at Bai Mo a little too intently that even Bai Zhu became aware of it. Bai Zhu had just noticed that a little brat accompanied Jun Wu Xie and his surprise could be seen in his eyes.

“And this is?” asked Bai Zhu.

“This is the son of our Lord.” Qiao Chu replied without good intention, he suddenly and unexpectedly developed a bad intention in his heart.

As soon as Qiao Chu said this, Bai Mo, who was at his side, immediately glared at him.

Bai Zhu had a look of surprise on his face.

“I would not have guessed that my Lord already has a child at his age...” If he remembered correctly, Yan Hai was not that old, how could he have such a big son?

Jun Wu Xie said nothing, but Bai Mo looked at Bai Zhu with exasperation, “Can’t I be adopted?”

“...” Bai Zhu did not expect this little rascal to have such a big temper. That look gave him a bit of a chill, but soon he returned to normal.

“Sorry, I have overstepped my boundaries.”

Bai Mo tsked coldly and turned away, no longer caring about Bai Zhu.

After sitting for a while, Bai Zhu continued telling Jun Wu Xie about the other strong exponents, and then they went their separate ways.

The second day of the selection was still boring, but Jun Wu Xie still attended. She was more interested in observing Long Yao and seeing if any Top Ten exponents appeared in the arena. Bai Zhu seemed to be infatuated and as long as he saw Jun Wu Xie, he would spontaneously go to her and continuously kept a smile on his face no matter how cold Jun Jun Xie treated him.

Since Bai Zhu did not do anything other than sit near Jun Wu Xie, and rarely spoke, it was difficult to find a reason to chase him away. As such, Jun Wu Xie could only choose to ignore his existence.

When the selection ended, Bai Zhu would quickly leave on his own. Even Qiao Chu, who was very straightforward, also felt there was no reason to lay a hand on him.
