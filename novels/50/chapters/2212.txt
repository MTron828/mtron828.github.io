Yan Bu Gui tried his best to hold back all the tears.

“I won’t cry, you too...don’t..”

Only now did Su Ya realize that her tears had long fallen silently, but her injuries were too heavy and she could not even feel her warm tears.

“My two Masters, we should get going, Master Su Ya still needs treatment.” Jun Wu Xie did not want to interrupt this precious reunion between Su Ya and Yan Bu Gui, unfortunately, this was not the correct time and place for this.

Yan Bu Gui nodded his head, not willing to let go of Su Ya, he immediately carried her up gently as if holding the most precious treasure in the entire world.

Jun Wu Xie’s mouth raised in to a smile, before she could even take two steps, she had been brought back into the embrace of Jun Wu Yao.

“You’re always caring about others, it is time that someone cares about you too.” Jun Wu Yao said teasingly as he bit her cheek lightly as if punishing her.

Jun Wu Xie allowed him to do whatever he wanted to, without bothering about it, she only drilled herself into a more comfortable position.

Perhaps she was able to understand how Su Ya felt in Yan Bu Gui’s embrace. That feeling of pure bliss, even if the pain was unbearable, it was not able to erase the feeling of completeness that the heart felt. No matter how good was an elixir under the heavens, it could not be compared to the company and protection of a loved one.

“Really good.” Jun Wu Xie said in a low voice.

Jun Wu Yao raised an eyebrow and looked at her.

“What is really good?”

“Having you...”

Jun Wu Yao’s expression was suddenly stiff as his heart was filled with unspeakable happiness. To hear these words, he was willing to give up everything.

“At least you still have a conscience.” He said to her in a blaming tone yet his eyes were shining. Even the little old man standing at the side could see it clearly.

The little old man touched his chin, today was filled with pleasant surprises one after another.

Followed behind the Spirit Jade Palace Lord, the girl wearing the mask silently looked at Jun Wu Xie who was in the arms of Jun Wu Yao and there was a the hint of relief in her eyes.

As they descended Mount Fu Yao, no one stopped. A thousand people from the Upper Realm had been wiped out in Cloudy Brook Academy and it would not take long for this to be passed to the ears of the Upper Realm. At that time, it is feared that the entire Middle Realm would be greeted by a torrential storm of vengeance.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord did not leave but brought everyone to escort Jun Wu Xie and the rest. Today’s matter, no one could escape. The Spirit Jade Palace could no longer return. They had to give up their new rise in power, otherwise they would be the first to bear the brunt of the vengeance of the Upper Realm. The moment the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had decided to help them, he had already understood this point. There was nothing such as regret, instead, he felt a rush of relief and happiness, the awakening of the blood which had been suppressed for a millennium. Once awakened, he felt as if he had been reborn.

Everyone stopped temporarily in the forest not far from Mount Fu Yao. Among them were many wounded people and they could not hurry on the road without stop for a day and night.

Jun Wu Xie took out some items from her Cosmos Sack. The Spirit Jade Palace Lord had made proper preparations beforehand as he took out many things to set up camp with. A group of people immediately came forward to set up camp in this forest. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The sun set as the moonlight shrouded the quiet forest. The fire had been started, indicating that a new day was coming. The tired Spirit Jade Palace disciples took out the medicine and redressed the wounds before falling into deep slumber. Jun Wu Xie’s injuries had been stabilized and she started to treat Lord Meh Meh and those severely injured patients. When she saw Lord Meh Meh who was bundled up with bandages so much that it looked like a dumpling in Ye Mei’s embrace, Jun Wu Xie could not help but went forward to plant a kiss on its little horn as she said in a gentle whisper: “You’ve worked hard.”
