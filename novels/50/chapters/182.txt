Chapter 183: “Crossing Swords ‘Covertly” (1)”

The Qing Yun Clan group entered the Imperial Palace, and Mo Qian Yuan followed right after. The delegation of over twenty were invited into the main hall.

Only lowly palace maids and other palace functionaries were present in the main hall with Mo Qian Yuan to face the “visiting guests” from Qing Yun Clan. With Mo Qian Yuan having been poisoned for a long period which damaged his body, his spiritual powers had not developed much. His measly spiritual powers in the eyes of the present group, would not stand up to a single strike.

“Where is Yun Xian?” Jiang Chen Qing had just sat down and maintained a dark expression, ignoring the refreshments the palace maids had served.

Qin Yu Yan sipped at her tea with her head lowered, a smile on her lips, but not saying a word.

“I have instructed for her to be invited here, please rest your legs a moment more.”

When Bai Yun Xian came to the kingdom, she had received the highest form of treatment and Mo Xuan Fei had gone to great lengths to win her favour. Bai Yun had been arrogant, but Mo Xuan Fei had not been treated dismissively like he was now.

Jiang Chen Qing does not even bother with basic pleasantries with the Emperor of a kingdom!

The Elder of Qing Yun Clan, must really be somebody! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jiang Chen Qing glanced at Qin Yu Yan, and seeing that she was not going to say anything, he suppressed his displeasure at the situation.

A tiny kingdom like Qi was beneath his notice. Compared with the might of the Qing Yun Clan, the kingdom’s strength was reduced to almost nothing. If it had not been for Bai Yun Xian’s message, they would never have come.

Moments later, a lady in white ambled in leisurely.

Bai Yun Xian was dressed in a white brocade dress, her hair held with a pearl hair ornament. She entered graciously, and was taken aback for a moment by the numerous people in the main hall, before she composed herself and walked in with poise.

“My respects to you, Eldest Miss. Elder.” Jun Wu Xie knelt in reverence.

From the time Bai Yun Xian appeared, Jiang Chen Qing’s gaze had been locked on her. His penetrating eyes had surveyed her several times over, verifying Bai Yun Xian had not been mistreated in anyway, before the look of disapproval faded from his face.

“Yun Xian, have you been fine here? Father was worried sick upon receiving your message, but he is still in seclusion and was unable to leave from the clan. Hence, he had instructed Uncle Jiang to accompany me on this trip, to see if you have been treated well.” Qin Yu Yan stood up with a laugh and helped Bai Yun Xian up to her feet. Her smile on her face was so gentle that you can almost feel the warmth, but the expression on Bai Yun Xian face was a tad bit stiffened.

In the short moment that Qin Yu Yan helped her up, Qin Yu Yan had her fingers on her wrist feeling her pulse!

“I regret that I have troubled Master with this. I was not thinking straight. I was anxious and lost my mind. I beg for Eldest Miss’ and the Elder’s forgiveness.” Bai Yun Xian said with her head lowered, not daring to move her wrist.

Qin Yu Yan’s knowledge of medicine was way beyond hers. She might have been a direct disciple of the Qing Yun Clan Sovereign, but she can’t be compared to his daughter. With Qin Yu Yan taking her pulse, she had to feign ignorance, but her heart was bursting with anticipation.

When Jun Wu Xie had given her the poison, she had taken her own pulse. It had been steady, with no signs of having been poisoned.

Can Qin Yu Yan detect that she had been poisoned? If she can detect it, does that mean she has the ability to remedy it?

Bai Yun Xian raised her head, and looked at Qin Yu Yan expectantly.

And, Qin Yu Yan finally let go of her hand, her gentle smile still on her face.

Bai Yun Xian’s eyes dulled.

As expected, Qin Yu Yan did not detect the poison.
