“Let me help you.” Jun Wu Yao’s voice was suppressing great pain, his Little Xie must know something, otherwise she would not have stopped him.

Jun Wu Xie was in such great pain that she could not speak and could only shake her head.

If it’s not her, then it’s him.

If she had to choose, she’d rather it be her.

The chaos that wrecked through her body was extremely painful but it won’t cost her her life. But if the Life and Death Worm continuously surged then it would speed up the death of Jun Wu Yao.

As the both of them were fighting each other, Hua Yao and the rest, who were standing aside, were perspiring in panic. The sudden abnormal behavior of Jun Wu Xie caused them to panic and they were completely unaware of what had happened.

However, at the moment, they were unable to question Jun Wu Xie as they stood silently to the side and prayed.

“Be good, listen to me. I am fine.” Jun Wu Yao lowered his voice and used a gentle tone, as if to persuade a little child, but Jun Wu Xie’s expression was resolute.

The chaos attached fast and left people helpless. The blue veins erupted had already spread from her arm to her neck. Against her pale skin, the violent blue veins crept slowly upwards, from her neck to lower jaw, gradually extending to her cheek.

Inch by inch the lines of veins are like knife stabs to Jun Wu Yao’s heart.

When the blue veins covered her entire body, Jun Wu Xie was wrecked in such extreme pain that her consciousness was fuzzy. She clenched her teeth tightly, her eyes closed in pain, and the hand holding Jun Wu Yao’s wrist was not released, as she remained squatting. It was as if she had exhausted her whole body strength.

“Rong Ruo.” Jun Wu Yao’s voice trembled with suppressed emotions.

“Here!” Rong Ruo was surprised.

“Pull her hand away.” Jun Wu Yao squinted his eyes, regardless of whether Jun Wu Xie agreed or not, he had to do this.

Rong Ruo’s expression showed signs of an internal struggle. Although she did not know what was actually happening to Jun Wu Xie, she could see that Jun Wu Yao had to help Jun Wu Xie, however, Jun Wu Xie was opposed to him doing so. There was a strong possibility that by Jun Wu Yao helping, he might bring great harm to himself.

“Quick.” Jun Wu Yao looked up, his purple eyes were bloodshot and looked very frightening.

Rong Ruo did not dare to delay further as Jun Wu Xie’s current state made her distressed. She hurriedly put the little Sea Spirit Beast down and reached out to pull Jun Wu Xie’s hand away.

However, Jun Wu Xie’s hand remained in a death grip, holding on extremely tightly to Jun Wu Yao’s wrist. No matter how hard Rong Ruo pulled, it remained steadfastly clenched, Rong Ruo didn’t dare to use her Spiritual Power to pry her hand open as it would hurt the bones of Jun Wu Xie’s hand.

“Little Xie, let go.... Listen to me, I know what I’m doing. Nothing bad will happen. Be good and let go of your hand alright?” Jun Wu Yao could only suppress his heartache and gently persuaded her.

Only at this point, Jun Wu Xie no longer had a hold on her consciousness. She could not hear what he was saying at all. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Just when everyone was in a hurry to do anything, a black shadow suddenly burst out from the side of the forest.

Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo, in a moment of alertness, stood protectively in front of Jun Wu Yao and the others.

A person dressed in strange clothes appeared in front of their eyes. That person’s head was not big and was wearing a light armor made of scales, with a light blue mask over the face with a long bow behind. It was a strange sight to behold.

This island was actually inhibited?!

Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo did not dare to relax. At this moment, Jun Wu Xie was in a terrible condition and could not suffer any attacks at all. The two men immediately stood their ground, ready to attack at anytime!
