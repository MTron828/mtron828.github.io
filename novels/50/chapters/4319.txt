Jun Wu Xie walked towards Jun Wu Yao. Both of them were ready to go back, but they waited for a while ...

“What do you want?” Jun Wu Xie turned her head and looked at the people that followed them all the way.

The person behind Jun Wu Xie was not someone else, it was Bai Mo who was previously pressured by Jun Wu Xie.

There was no arrogance in Bai Mo. Blood has not returned to his face at all as his small and white face turned even paler. That pair of big bright eyes blinked along with the delicate features seemed to be alive and pathetic like a little doll. There was not a sliver of maliciousness at all.

Bai Mo pursed his lips and looked at Jun Wu Xie. His pair of big black eyes suddenly glanced at Jun Wu Yao who stood next to Jun Wu Xie. No matter why, he always felt that this man looked a little familiar. But after searching his memory, he couldn’t match the face to anyone familiar that was similar to this person.

Bai Mo’s gaze turned around and fell on Jun Wu Xie again. Those big black eyes, looking at Jun Wu Xie were sparkling, but he didn’t speak.

Jun Wu Xie was too lazy to deal with him, so she pulled Jun Wu Yao and left.

With Bai Mo’s strength, no matter what he wanted to do, Jun Wu Xie didn’t care.

Bai Mo followed like a small tail. He followed Jun Wu Xie all the way back to the restaurant from the street, Bai Mo actually followed until Jun Wu Xie planned to return to the room.

Jun Wu Xie turned silently, watching Bai Mo following with silence along the way.

“What on earth do you want?”

Unwilling? Want to take revenge?

Who knows, when Jun Wu Xie said this, Bai Mo’s eyes suddenly filled with tears. He stood at the entrance of the restaurant and suddenly burst into tears in public.

“Woohoo, dad, don’t you want me anymore? I don’t dare to be naughty anymore, please don’t discard me... ohh ...

The sudden cry and accusation was so bad. It instantly stunned Jun Wu Xie in place. She watched the killing god who almost killed Nangong Lie. Yet, now he was suddenly crying helplessly in front of her, panting for breath.

The loud and aggrieved voice instantly attracted the attention of the pedestrians around him, and everyone’s eyes were casted on Bai Mo and Jun Wu Xie in the cry.

“...” Jun Wu Xie was a little dumbfounded. Even though she was smart, she really couldn’t figure out what Bai Mo was doing.

Bai Mo was crying and aggrieved, and the number of onlookers attracted was huge.

The corner of Jun Wu Xie’s mouth twitched slightly. She thought Bai Mo was ridiculous. How could she give birth to a son this big at her age that looked like a child again. But “Yan Hai” was not. He was just twenty years old. He couldn’t have such a big child.

However...

However, Bai Mo’s next move made Jun Wu Xie truly realize what utterly shameless meant.

Bai Mo cried and rushed towards Jun Wu Xie. Just at the moment when Jun Wu Xie dodged subconsciously, Bai Mo suddenly fell on the side of Jun Wu Yao’s leg. His pair of small hands directly held Jun Wu Yao’s thigh, crying out loud.

“...”

Jun Wu Xie understood that this fellow’s confession was not towards her, but Jun Wu Yao instead. He was confessing towards Jun Wu Yao who seemed to be twenty-six or seven years old.

Just that...

Did Bai Mo know who he was trifling with?

Suddenly, Jun Wu Xie sympathized with this unlucky child.
