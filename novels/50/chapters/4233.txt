Han Zi Fei’s words made a hint of worry flash by Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

What Han Zi Fei conveyed to her, made it clear that she was willing and this marriage was voluntary and not forced upon by others.

That...made Jun Wu Xie really tangled.

“Since you have not met him before, Sacred Maiden is still willing to entrust yourself to him for life?” Jun Wu Xie looked up. She wanted to save Jun Gu, but she didn’t want to hurt Han Zi Fei. So ... she hoped that Han Zi Fei would dispel this thought.

“Other than being famous, I’ve heard that ... Lord Jun Gu is modest, handsome and powerful, so why not?” Han Zi Fei looked at her worrying little daughter with a smile, and the idea to tease her even more lit up in her mind.

Their own children were the best and all parents wanted their children to be happy. She saw Jun Wu Xie’s calmness and sensibility. Han Zi Fei felt happy, but couldn’t help but feel a little distressed.

How many setbacks did it take to make this young Jun Wu Xie hone into what she is now?

This wisdom and calmness only made Han Zi Fei feel bad for all that Jun Wu Xie had experienced in the past.

Her child should have grown up happy and carefree ...

Jun Wu Xie’s brow frowned slightly. She was not good at words at first. Facing Han Zi Fei’s determination, she really did not know how to respond. If she was not worried about revealing her identity in front of the Sacred Maiden, she really wanted to summon the black cat out. The black cat’s sharp teeth were much easier to use than hers.

Looking at her worrying little girl, Han Zi Fei laughed out and was in a good mood. Her gentle laughter tinkled across the hall, but she did not know what kind of thoughts had roused up in the others.

At this moment, Han Shu was silently gnashing her teeth. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After meeting Jun Wu Xie, she had never said a few words to her. She always had a cold expression. Her words were precious like gold, even towards Duan Qi she rarely spoke, but ...

Ever since Han Zi Fei appeared, Jun Wu Xie’s attitude had changed significantly!

Instead of being disgruntled because of Han Zi Fei’s rudeness, she accepted Han Zi Fei’s apology so easily. Now she could even chat with Han Zi Fei. Even a fool can see Jun Wu Xie’s attitude towards Han Zi Fei was much better than that of others!

Although there was no smile at all and not much was communicated, Han Zi Fei was the only person whom Jun Wu Xie looked straight at.

This alone was enough to make Han Shu’s chest hurt.

Why?

Why did she get to have all the good gains?

Was Han Shu really not comparable to Han Zi Fei?!!

Han Shu became red-eyed and stared intently at Han Zi Fei.

At the same time, Duan Qi and Elder Yun’s expressions turned sombre.

Han Shu was concerned about everything only because of jealousy. But Duan Qi and Elder Yun did not have this mindset. They had realized that Jun Wu Xie treated Han Zi Fei specially. Although Han Zi Fei did not react at all, this was not what they wanted to see!

As known, the reason why they invited Jun Wu Xie to the Holy Mountain was to let Jun Wu Xie choose a woman among the maidens to continue the next generation. But among these women, only Han Zi Fei was not included!

Han Zi Fei will marry Jun Gu in a few days. If Jun Wu Xie fancied her, how will they explain to Jun Gu?

This was not the result that Duan Qi and Elder Yun wanted to see. But they had just realized their mistake and looked at the beautiful Han Zi Fei under the illumination of the lights. They finally realized that Han Zi Fei’s appearance was outstanding!
