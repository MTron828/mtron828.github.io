Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Elder Duan, please be appeased. Han Shu is wrong. But... hasn’t Han Zi Fei returned to the Holy Mountain? If Elder Duan wanted to conceive a Sacred Maiden, would it not be better to use Han Zi Fei as the base? Although Han Shu’s head was lowered, and she sounded docile and obedient, her heart was very unwilling.

Hearing Han Shu mentioned Han Zi Fei, Duan Qi’s brow wrinkled further.

“Han Zi Fei has entered into a marriage contract with the Knight of Destruction and she will be married one month later. The Lord has personally arranged for this marriage, and even if she had a child, the child will not belong to our Sacred Maiden Tribe.”

Han Shu pursed her lips and didn’t dare say anything further.

“I know what you are thinking, but you must understand that regardless if it’s Bai Zhu or Yan Hai, they are just tools we use to conceive a new Sacred Maiden. Once you are pregnant, you will not be able to meet them any longer. So, you best stop whatever you are thinking.” Duan Qi glanced at Han Shu, a clear warning in her tone.

While she was at White Night city, Han Shu had already fallen for Bai Zhu. All she could think about was the glorious wealth of White Night City, and Bai Zhu’s warm and radiant smile. How could she even like Sea Spirit City?

But Duan Qi’s warning was already stuck in her head. Even if she did not want to, she would never dare to disobey Duan Qi’s order.

“I understand,I am willing to abide by Elder Duan’s arrangements.” Han Shu muttered.

“Fine, as long as you understand the seriousness of this matter, that’s enough. Now, go take your rest. Tomorrow I will meet with City Lord Yan to discuss your affairs.” Duan Qi waved her hand to dismiss the women.

Han Shu and others did not dare to speak further, and they retreated silently.

But Duan Qi didn’t pay any further attention to them. After the women’s conversation was over, a black shadow quietly ran out from their home. The black shadow moved at great speed, as it left the accommodation and headed straight for the city’s official residence. And in the blink of an eye, the black shadow had already arrived in the backyard of the city’s official residence.

In the backyard, Jun Wu Xie was sitting in the gazebo, and Jun Wu Yao, Hua Yao and the others were sitting beside her, seemingly waiting for something.

The dark shadow quickly fell in front of Jun Wu Xie and whispered: “Miss, Lord Jue.”

“So?” Jun Wu Xie looked up slightly and looked at Ye Gu who was kneeling in front of her.

Early on, when she asked the men to arrange for accommodation for Duan Qi and the other women, she also secretly sent Ye Gu to their residence. Ye Gu was the strongest among the Night Regime. Within the Upper Realm, there were very few people who could detect his presence. Although the mental prowess of the Sacred Maiden Tribe was strong, their spiritual power was very weak, and therefore it was impossible for them to detect the presence of Ye Gu.

“This aligns with Lord Jue’s earlier assessment. Duan Qi really wants Miss and one of the women from the Sacred Maiden Tribe to conceive the next generation. And the lady in question is the one who has been chattering non-stop.” Ye Gu frowned.

Upon hearing Ye Gu’s words, Jun Wu Xie couldn’t help but look at Jun Wu Yao and she found Jun Wu Yao looking at her with a “I am right” look. Jun Wu Xie turned back to Ye Gu, and said, “Anything else besides that?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Gu hesitated for a moment, and after glancing at Jun Wu Yao, he continued: “Besides that, Duan Qi also mentioned Senior Han Zi Fei. She has a marriage contract with one of the Knights of Destruction which is ordered by the Lord. “
