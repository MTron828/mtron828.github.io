“Mmph...” The ring spirit whose mouth had been frozen looked aggrievedly at the ring spirit dressed in white. He pointed to the ice on his mouth and seemed to have wanted to say something.

“Shut up.” That white clad ring spirit creased his brows, seemingly losing all his patience.

That tall and sturdy ring spirit slouched his shoulders and retreated to the side in dejection. However, he did not forget to apologize to Qiao Chu as he looked at him apologetically and nodded his head.

Only now did Qiao Chu dared to breathe in and he was appalled by that rancid stench!

Even though they were a little further away, Rong Ruo and the others also caught hold of the rancid stench. If they closed their eyes, they would have really thought that they were standing in a mass grave with rotting corpses thrown everywhere.

“Don’t blame Little Taro, he... did not do it intentionally...” Little Lotus walked up to the front as he tiptoed and used his small hands to gently pat the hands of the ring spirit with the tall stature, seemingly trying to comfort him.

“Little...Little Taro?” Qiao Chu looked at Little Lotus with wide eyes. Such a strong and valiant man who was taller than him by a head, was actually called... Little Taro?

The naming sense of these plant ring spirits were really...mystifying!

“He is a great devil taro, you can also call him a corpse flower. He was born with the smell of carrion.” Poison Ivy sighed lightly with relief and explained.

“Corpse... corpse flower...” Qiao Chu widened his eyes.

The corpse flower, they had seen it seen before, it was huge in size and was a purely “carnivorous plant” that emitted a smell similar to a rotting corpse to attract insects and small animals. It would lure them close to it and then swallow them.

It was no wonder that the moment the mouth of the corpse flower was opened, Qiao Chu was almost smothered to death. One must know that the corpse flower has the “famous name” of the world’s most smelly plant!

When the corpse flower heard Poison Ivy introduce him, he bashfully raised his hand and scratched his head. Looking at this big friendly giant, there was no way people could connect him with the cruel flower of killing.

“Then this is...” Qiao Chu finally digested the information...ah...no wonder it was Little Xie’s ring spirit. Apart from the Little Lotus, there really wasn’t anyone normal. He looked in the direction of that white clad ring spirit who had saved him just now. In the nick of time, at the moment the corpse flower wanted to open his mouth once again, the white clad ring spirit immediately sealed his mouth. This has saved Qiao Chu from another round of trauma.

At that time, Qiao Chu was dizzy after being smothered with that sudden attack of stink and did not have time to see what the white clad ring spirit did.

“Crystal Orchid.” Poison Ivy said.

Qiao Chu looked blank and it was obvious that he had never heard of the name of this plant before.

However, Fan Zhuo behind him widened his eyes as he looked at the cold face of Crystal Orchid that did not seem human.

“Crystal Orchid? Is it the rumoured flower of death from the netherworld?” Fan Zhuo looked at Crystal Orchid with curiosity.

“Come... from the netherworld... Little Zhuo, don’t scare me.” Qiao Chu touched his arm, and there was already a layer of goosebumps raised on both arms.

The appearance of Crystal Orchid was extremely beautiful, and he gave people an ethereal feeling. That almost translucent skin coupled with that fair complexion was so beautiful that people couldn’t move their eyes away. But how could such a beautiful ring spirit be related to the word “netherworld”? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Fan Zhuo cleared his throat and looked at the shocked Qiao Chu and explained: “This is just a metaphor. It is said that crystal orchids do not need the nourishment of sunlight and grows in darkness. They also emit a faint glow in the dark and it’s as if they grow on the path to the netherworld as a guide, and... it gets its nutrients from the rot of other plants.”
