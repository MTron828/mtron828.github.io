By the time they had calmed down, the square was already in a complete mess. The shattered rocks had left countless deep pits on the floor and flames were scattered all around as the temperature of the surroundings began to rise rapidly.

Ba He was furious when he saw all of this. He narrowed his eyes dangerously but immediately felt that something was amiss and when his eyes swept towards the wrecked platform, he shouted out: “Quick! Go and get Su Ya!”

A few Gold Spirits immediately rushed over to the wrecked platform and started searching through the dry wood.

Boom!

A loud blast reverberated throughout as a powerful explosion came from that very location and those Gold Spirits that were close to it were caught in it!

A silvery white figure suddenly appeared before Ba He. Under the resplendent sun rays, a pair of silver wings glistened and a silver armour that was shrouded in a layer of golden light appeared like a god descending from the heavens. In the hands of that figure, was Su Ya who had been brutally tortured to the brink of death!

“Who are you!” Ba He was shocked to see the sudden emergence of this mysterious person. As the series of explosions came about so suddenly, it was obvious that someone had made special arrangements beforehand. However, Mount Fu Yao had been under their tight control all this while, how did this person break in?!

The sudden appearance of the silver figure made all the surrounding Nine Temple disciples gape in shock as they looked wide eyed at that silver armour. Never had they even seen such a striking armour before. When that pair of silver wings flapped, each blade on the wing reflected the sunlight and it was a dazzling sight to behold. That silver figure carried the blood soaked Su Ya and other than that pair of eyes that were visible, the figure was completely covered in that resplendent armour.

It was a pair of extremely cold eyes, as if it was ice that could not melt even after a thousand years that encompassed an enormous killing intent that had been frozen within.

Not to mention Ba He and the people from the Nine Temples were all shocked with the sudden appearance of this mysterious figure, even the little old man was completely taken aback by everything that happened before him.

The figure carrying Su Ya did not speak but lowered the head and looked at Su Ya who was suffering in pain. Seeing Su Ya suffering from the unbearable pain but trying her hardest to endure it by biting her mangled lips, an anger that soared towards the heavens began to well up in the eyes of that figure.

Su Ya stared at the person with curiosity, she had never met this person before, why did this person save her?

The silver mask that covered that person’s face started to disappear bit by bit and when the entire countenance was revealed, Su Ya was incomparably shocked and stared at that face in a daze.

An attractive face was revealed to her, it wasn’t entirely outstanding, but what was unforgettable was that pair of limpid eyes with a chilling gaze.

Su Ya’s eyes widened in shock, even in her dreams she would never think that the very person who saved her would be...!

“Your disciple came late, Master has suffered.” When Jun Wu Xie looked at Su Ya’s disfigured face, her heart felt as thought is had been slashed by a thousand knives. Although her voice was very soft and there seemed to be no emotion in it, but beneath it all, was anger and killing intent that had been forcefully repressed and was on the verge of breaking free any moment.

Su Ya stared back at her and not knowing where her strength came from, she lifted her hand up and tried to pushed herself away.

Her distorted fingers were full of blood and when her hands touched Jun Wu Xie’s silver armour, it left a stain of black blood on it.

Su Ya was trying to drive her away. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Master, your disciple remembers your words. Today, your disciple will follow the rules of Master; to repay blood with blood, to return a tooth for a tooth!” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes as a murderous glint flashed by. The Face of Selvan extended its vines and held Su Ya up as Jun Wu Xie carefully placed a pill into Su Ya’s mouth and shortly after, the silver mask once again covered the killing intent that was apparent on her face.
