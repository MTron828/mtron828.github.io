Chapter 2981 Enemy approaching 3

Jun Wu Xie was very quiet tonight. She followed behind Jun Wu Yao, raised her head slightly, and looked at the back of the tall figure walking before her.

Even in the crowd of people, that person would shield her from the crowd. In this dense place, he would create a peaceful place for her.

In the previous life, Jun Wu Xie had never thought about what happiness was. She never had the luxury of possession. The kind of things that could only be seen in the books had always been strange to her. Out of reach to her.

But now, everything was different.

The warmth from her palm was so real. That hand was strong and hot. Even if there was a storm, it would not loosen, making her feel at ease.

Jun Wu Xie felt that it was precisely because she had been given this chance after she had transmigrated and had attained so much happiness. Family, companions, and lover. She had a strong attachment to this world. She was reluctant to lose the warmth that she had now. She could not let go of this world with these lovely people disappearing in front of her eyes, so ...

That was why she came to the Upper Realm.

Jun Wu Xie always had an illusion. In the midst of it, there seemed to be an invisible force guiding her, letting her come into this world, letting her meet these people. She experienced everything that she needed to.

There was pain, challenges, laughter, and tiredness ... But she didn’t regret it.

No matter where the power came from, she was grateful. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

For the first time, she was grateful for the gods that may exist in this world.

At least she had it.

At least she had warmth.

At least, she was happy.

She was most willing to do anything to attain all these.

Jun Wu Yao, who walked in front of her, suddenly stopped. In the crowd of people, he turned subconsciously. In the moonlight and in the wall, he saw that touch of her standing in his shadow. A small figure whose smile would melt one’s heart when he saw it bloomed.

It turned out to be so beautiful, making him forget everything for that moment. He just wanted to stand there and look at her.

Until the end of his life.

“I’m very blessed.” Jun Wu Xie smiled from the bottom of her heart. She was not afraid of the treacherous path of mountains of swords and the sea of fire ahead as what was supporting her from behind was what she valued most, utmost care and concern.

Jun Wu Yao took a deep breath, holding her little hand tightly and pulled her in front of him as he bowed his head unexpectedly and dropped a kiss on her lips.

“I’m more blessed than you.”

Because I met you, so I am more blessed than you.

Jun Wu Xie smiled foolishly. The snow and ice melted and flowers bloomed. Under the moonlight it added a touch of beauty.

Jun Wu Yao looked at her definitively, as if to imprint her in his soul. Then he turned around and pulled Jun Wu Xie forward.

Only by overthrowing the schemes and destroying the plans of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms could they then truly enjoy happiness.

However, the boulder accumulated in their hearts seemed to be lighter at this moment. Their pace became lighter as well.

Chi Yan’s mansion was not his actual residence. It was just a cover up and there were several residences of this kind. But the real residence that the Knight of Destruction really lived in was only known to themselves and His Lord. Their power and status were just below His Lord. But for unknown reasons, this was rarely known.
