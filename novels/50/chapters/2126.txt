Chapter 2127: The Ruler of Face Slaps Returns (10)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The amount of torment that Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord suffered was something that was hard to imagine by normal people. Seeing their faces contorted and twisted up in agony, it caused Soul Slayer to become completely stunned. At that moment, despair and fear filled its body as all his words of betrayal earlier stuck onto his body like life sucking talismans.

“Spare my life, Dark Emperor! Spare my life!” Soul Slayer was unable to kneel and it could only fall flat onto the ground, where its body was seen to be trembling faintly, his words of plea accompanying Wu Jiu’s mournful wails that reverberated through the grand hall.

However, Jun Wu Yao did not even once glance towards Soul Slayer at all, as if even giving hims a single glance would be too much of a waste in his eyes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That fool there, will be left for you to deal with.” Jun Wu Yao said with a sidelong glance at the Spirit Lord.

The Spirit Lord immediately fell onto one knee and lowered his head to say sincerely: “Thank you Dark Emperor for your help, the Spirit World will forever submit ourselves to you.”

After having experienced all this, the Spirit Lord finally understood that there was no disadvantage in pledging their allegiance to Jun Wu Yao. Jun Wu Yao was not a tyrannical ruler and he only seeks for them to submit themselves to him. To people who submit to him, he never made harsh demands, and would not order them to do anything that went against their morals or Heaven’s ethics.

Back when Jun Wu Yao unified and ruled the Middle Realm, besides the initial thrashing he gave till they submitted, he had not struck against them anymore after that, and did not interfere with their ways at all. Things had gone back to being as peaceful as if he had never appeared before.

Jun Wu Yao did not hold much interest in having the Spirit Lord’s pledge of allegiance as if not for Jun Wu Xie, he wouldn’t have bothered himself with the Spirit World’s affairs.

Tossing the matter of the Spirit Lord’s submission to the back of his mind, Jun Wu Yao stretched his hand out to pull Jun Wu Xie into his embrace. Compared to the cold indifference from before, his face then rose with a smile.

“Little Xie, in what manner do you want them to die?” Jun Wu Yao asked with a smile. It was feared that only he was qualified to spout such arrogant words.

“Anything,” Jun Wu Xie said as she looked at Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord calmly. Letting them live another second in the Spirit World would just disgust people.

“Little Xie, you’re still as benevolent as ever.” Jun Wu Yao said with a laugh. He went on to raise his hand and the black mist clutched around Wu Jiu’s and the fake Spirit Lord’s neck suddenly bored into their bodies. Countless lines of black blood covered over their bodies at a speed visible to the human eye, the bulging veins burrowing under their skin and beginning to swell, twisting up as they snaked to reach every single part.

At the moment when the black blood lines filled every single part of their skin, the blood veins then exploded!

Black mist wafted in the air within the grand hall, and there was no sign of Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord to be found in there.

The two biggest culprits who had stirred up so much turmoil in the Spirit World for the past hundred years had their lives taken away by Jun Wu Yao so nonchalantly...

It was till the black mist had gradually dissipated that Flame Dragon and Poison Ivy who stood shell shocked in the grand hall slowly regained their senses. Their gazes swept over every corner of the grand hall, as if they were trying to look for a sign of Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord.

But, no matter how hard they searched, there wasn’t the slightest trace of them left.

The deaths of Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord, had occurred so effortlessly under Jun Wu Yao’s hands, which had been as easy as crushing two tiny ants!

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would have believed that the Dark Emperor who had thrown the Spirit World into panic would now become their benefactor who saved the entire Spirit World?

Flame Dragon and Poison Ivy looked at each other and they saw in each others’ eyes, shock and deference.....
