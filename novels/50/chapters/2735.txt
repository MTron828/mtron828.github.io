Chapter 2736: Not Seeing（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“No.” Jun Wu Xie said so coldly as she got up and left.

See Nangong Lie? If Nangong Lie knew her identity, even if he saw her, he wouldn’t even dare to stay a moment longer in Sea Spirit City...

Zheng Weilong couldn’t figure out what was happening with Jun Wu Xie, and could not help but showed some confusion.

Rong Ruo patted Zheng Weilong’s shoulder kindly, “She has her plan.”

Zheng Weilong smiled bitterly. She thought she could completely guess the intentions of Jun Wu Xie, but now it seemed as if she had been over confident.

Jun Wu Xie’s words were titillating as she did not intend to see anyone from the coalition. However, Guan Hu and the others were kept in the dark, thinking that Sea Spirit City was being timid and acquiescent by allowing them into the city; that Sea Spirit City must have been so frightened by their might, that they didn’t even bother to approach the city’s official residence but instead put on airs and waited for Jun Wu Xie to personally come and invite them to the official residence.

To the point where Liang Cheng had already set up his posturing as he sat in the hall of his residence with the soldiers of Resolute City forming two rows on each side of the hall; looking aggressive and intending to show off their strength to Jun WU Xie.

However...

As Guan Hu and the others sat dead in their respective residences for a day, they didn’t even saw a hint of Jun Wu Xie’s shadow.

With his eyes looking towards the sunset, Guan Hu, who had been suffering from back pain, could not help but ask him men.

“Where did the Lord of Sea Spirit City run off to die? Did he meet Nangong Lie first?”

Guan Hu’s men shook his head and said, “I haven’t heard anything of that sort. Our men guarding the outside of the official residence did not see Yan Hai walk out of the main residence’s gate at all.”

“Didn’t come out?” Guan Hu was slightly stunned, he felt it was impossible.

The lord of this Sea Spirit City was so timid that he was unafraid to bully the weak but cowered in the face of the strong. He might have destroyed a couple of surrounding cities but upon seeing them, wasn’t he scared witless and welcomed them into his city?

Theoretically, shouldn’t Jun Wu Xie be diligent and paid her respects to them, one by one? Why wasn’t there any news till now?

“Did you look closely? Did Yan Hai leave from other doors?”

His men still shook their heads.

Guan Hu was getting impatient. Putting on airs was one thing, but if he allowed others the opportunity to get in contact with Jun Wu Xie first, and someone obtained the prescription first, then wouldn’t their efforts have been in vain?

Guan Hu had started to get up to go to the city’s official residence but sat back down again as he felt that he was losing face. He raised his hand to instruct his men to send for the guards at the official residence.

A member of the Night Regime was called over, and Guan Hu in all of his inflated self worth and arrogance said to the Night Regime member,

“Go and tell that boy, Yan Hai, that I have something to say and tell him to come and see me.”

“Yes.” The member of the Night Regime responded earnestly as Guan Hu nodded with satisfaction.

As soon as the member of the Night Regime left Guan Hu’s house, the ‘respect’ on his face disappeared without a trace.

“You want our Miss to personally come and see you? Dream on!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After saying that, he shook his sleeves and left.

Liu Yi, Liang Cheng and Mu En’s situations were the same as Guan Hu. They had been waiting impatiently for Yah Hai to show up, but they were not willing to lower themselves to look for him. They could only get their men to send messages. However, not a single word from them had reached Jun Wu Xie’s ears. The moment the members of the Night Regime left their residences, they put those words at the back of their minds.

So much so that...

Guan Hu and others sat late into the night within their respective halls, and still Jun Wu Xie did not appear.
