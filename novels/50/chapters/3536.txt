Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Although Jun Wu Xie wanted to go back sooner to check if there would be any rune totems among the Twelve Palaces, it was still at least a month or two till the time that the bodies of Qiao Chu and the others would fully recover. And if Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie were to leave, then it would be very tough for Qiao Chu and the companions to leave the Spirit World.

It was Jun Wu Yao who came up with a solution to that. He left the Spirit World first temporarily, and handed the task of searching for the rune totems over to Ye Mei and the others.

And over that period, Jun Wu Xie and her companions used the time to continue with their cultivation, to increase their power of the spirit as much as possible, as only by strengthening their spirits would they be able to make themselves much more invincible.

The Spirit Lord’s soul was weakening, but Jun Wu Xie was able to make use of the Spirit Reinforcement runes to let the Spirit Lord cultivate his power of the spirit as quickly as possible and she shared the method with the Spirit Lord completely as well. That made the Spirit Lord feel as if he had been given the greatest treasure and he immediately promised to provide Jun Wu Xie and her companions the best of environments for their cultivation.

The couple of months passed in a blink, and the powers of Jun Wu Xie and the companions came to a peak. Even the Spirit Lord was greatly impressed with their current level of powers.

That one year had seemed long and endless, but in the passage of time, it was merely an unnoticeable moment.

On the last day before they were to part, the Spirit Lord booked the entire Spiritual Spirit Loft to hold a feast for Jun Wu Xie and the companions. He had also dragged Nalan Shan, Brownie, Flame Dragon and the previous Spirit Master as company.

“Are you guys really going to leave?” Brownie said as it sat on a special chair. Because it’s body was too massive, when it lowered its head to look at Jun Wu Xie, the Spiritual Bear was just like a giant. But within that pair of jet black eyes, they were filled with thick reluctance to part, looking highly aggrieved like those of a small child’s.

Although Brownie had already regained the power due to the Spiritual Bear, and was now capable of human speech, deep in its heart, it still felt extremely affectionate towards Jun Wu Xie and her companions who had helped it before. Speaking from its age as the Spiritual Bear, Brownie was still a very young spirit existence. The size of a fully mature Spiritual Bear would be one whole time bigger than the Ying Yang Bear.

It might be the deaths of the cheetah and the others that was making Brownie’s heart feel highly remorseful and uneasy. Despite the fact that peace had returned to the Spirit World, the unease in its heart had not dissipated.

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand up and rubbed Brownie on the head, the furry texture under her hand so comforting her eyes narrowed up.

“Can’t you just not go?” Brownie asked as it stared highly pitifully at Jun Wu Xie. Nalan Shan beside Brownie could not help but gave a sigh. Towards the young lady Jun Wu Xie, the longer he knew her, the more surprised he was with her. If not for her arrival into the Spirit World, Wu Jiu’s insidious scheme would have succeeded one fine day.

It was as if Jun Wu Xie was like a gift the Heavens had specially bestowed onto the Spirit World.

“I will still come back here in future.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes turned soft and gentle. She then raised her eyes, to seemingly look askance at Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Wu Yao nodded his head slightly, like he was agreeing to the expectant look from her. “Really? Then when will you guys be coming again?” Brownie asked, its eyes shining brightly.

Jun Wu Xie was feeling rather helpless under Brownie’s adorable pair of eyes.

When they would be coming back to the Spirit World? She was not certain. If it was possible, she would naturally wish for it to be after she had dismantled at Upper Realm’s Sacrificial Array, as it would only be at that time that she would have the leisure to revisit old places.

But looking at Brownie’s highly eager eyes filled with so much anticipation, she could not bear to say all that aloud.

Qiao Chu at the side noticed Jun Wu Xie’s quandary and he immediately broke into a wide smile as he lifted his foot to discreetly nudge the Yin Yang Bear who was happily huddled beside him, chewing on bamboo.
