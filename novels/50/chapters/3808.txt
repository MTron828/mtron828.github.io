Chapter 2404: Beat Them to Death（4）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

This was Jun Wu Xie’s first “greeting gift” specially prepared for the Upper Realm, and it was also one of the chips that Jun Wu Yao left for her!

This move had left even Jun Qing and others shocked.

“I suddenly want to see... the battlefield ahead.” Jun Qing felt the blood of a soldier pulsating from within and heat radiated from his chest. He couldn’t wait to see the scene of the battle between the behemoths and the Upper Realm.

“There’s no hurry.” Jun Wu Xie said . “There will be ample time for that later and opportunities are aplenty.”

The battle with the Upper Realm had only just started and the good part of this play had yet been staged!

At the same time, the army of the Upper Realm had begun to move towards the city at the border of the Lower Realm. The silence around them has made the troops of the Upper Realm somewhat apprehensive but at the same time, they felt their blood boil with pent up rage. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I say, how powerful can that little slut called Jun Wu Xie be? It’s as if she’s all that but look at her guts, we have yet to arrive but all the garbage in the Lower Realm had been scared away like scurrying rats. Hmph, they even abandoned their own city.” Xie Chang Ming looked at the empty city before them and the corner of the mouth curled up into smile filled with disdain.

The vast city gates were wide open and with a single glance, the streets in the city were empty and other than the howling of the wind that bustled through the alleys or the wide streets, silence shrouded the entire city, and there was no semblance of anyone living in this city.

Retreated without a fight?

Wei Ya raised his eyebrows slightly as he stared at the first city they reached with disapproval.

“So, this is the guts of the Lower Realm?” Wei Ya sneered.

Before his laughter ended, suddenly, the ground under the armoured horses began to quake violently. The tremors made the stones on the ground shake and this sudden turn of events spooked the horses and made them cry out in fright. The sharp neighs of the horses suddenly resounded all around!

“What’s the matter!” Xie Chang Ming’s face changed immediately as he tried to tighten the reins, not letting the remaining horses lose control, but the ground under the horses’ shoes started to tremble more and more, from a small vibration to a huge tremor, it seemed as if an earthquake was impending!

There was a loud bang, and the ground beneath them suddenly started to crack and very soon, countless cracks appeared. More than a dozen monsters with the size as large as the mountain peaks drilled out of the ground. Each and everyone of them had a massive towering body, and those hundreds of Gold Spirits that were on top of them were thrown off in all directions!

“What is that!?” Wei Ya’s eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at the huge monsters that suddenly appeared. The monsters were covered with earthy hard scales and their colour camouflaged well with the soil. They were huge, but their speed was alarming!

From the bottom, they suddenly rushed out and hurled the forces of the Upper Realm all around. They did not wait for the soldiers around them to react in time and prepare for the battle when they suddenly changed direction and smashed their behemoth bodies on the ground. Even the powerful Gold Spirits could not withstand such a devastating crush from such a behemoth and the ground was dyed in red as a river of blood started to flow!

The monsters that had mashed up blood and meat on them quickly drilled back into the ground immediately after they successfully created such a pandemonium, leaving only a huge deep hole in their wake and made it impossible for anyone to catch their disappearing figures!

In just the blink of an eye, the army of the Upper Realm was torn apart by the sudden appearance of several dozens of those giant monsters. Incomplete corpses scattered by those monstrous huge holes that remained. These holes were also filled with the remains of those mashed up mess of corpses that had been pulverized into a meat and bloody paste.

The acrid stench of blood smell smothered everyone’s nose in an instant!
