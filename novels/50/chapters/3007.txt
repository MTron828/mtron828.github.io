Chapter 3008 You Have Returned 3

Puppet Rong Ruo stared blankly at Fei Yan, not daring to believe his reaction. At that moment, the puppet did not know what to do.

In the house, all you could see was Fei Yan blindly looking for that last bit of hope.

After keeping silent for a long time, Jun Wu Xie finally said, “Little Ruo, tell him.”

After hearing Jun Wu Xie’s words, everyone in the room froze and looked at her in disbelief. Fei Yan especially stopped everything he was doing.

“Little Xie..what...what are you saying? You clearly know that...” said Qiao Chu. Fei Yan’s madness was already difficult to accept and now Jun Wu Xie too?

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo had confused looks in their eyes but when they looked at Jun Wu Xie’s expression and then the puppet, a shocking thought came into their minds and they reached out to cover Qiao Chu’s mouth.

“Little Ruo?” Fei Yan said with a little more confidence, Jun Wu Xie’s words seemed to confirm his suspicion.

“It’s me.” the puppet said with constrain.

Fei Yan smiled brightly, he finally found the source of the sound and reached straight towards the direction of the table, instead of feeling around blindly.

“Little Ruo, I knew it, I knew you didn’t....” Fei Yan stopped in his tracks as his fingers did not feel the familiar warmth of a body as he expected but instead felt the cold, lifeless bumps of a wooden puppet. The mental picture he formed made him so silent he might as well have been dead.

“Little....Little Ruo...”

Fei Yan did not dare to believe what he was feeling. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Puppet Rong Ruo looked down sadly at Fei Yan’s finger that was resting on his shoulder.

“I’m here, just that I’m a puppet.”

“How could this be....” Fei Yan managed to squeeze out.

“When I self exploded my soul, I didn’t expect that I still wouldn’t be able to protect you, Fei Yan. I’m so sorry.” Rong Ruo said regretfully.

But Fei Yan started shaking his head, “Little Ruo, you don’t have to be sorry at all, I’m the one who is sorry! It was me who was useless and didn’t protect you! If I wasn’t so weak, you wouldn’t....you wouldn’t....”

“You wouldn’t have chosen to self explode to save everything.”

Fei Yan’s last sentence seemed to be caught in his throat, cutting it as it came out. He sounded crestfallen, as if he was crying.

That was a hopelessness he would never forget, in that moment he felt like his whole world had ended.

If Jun Wu Xie had not told him that Rong Ruo’s soul could still be found, he might not have had the courage to live on!

By then, Qiao Chu and the rest were clear on the puppet’s identity. Although they had a million questions in their minds, they could wait as the joy of a friend returning and the feeling of hopelessness turned into joy outweighed it all.

They would be satisfied as long as Rong Ruo existed, no matter the form!

Faced with Fei Yan’s self-blame, Rong Ruo’s eyes were filled with pain. He did not know what to say as he had always understood what type of feelings Fei Yan had for him

But...

“Fei Yan, I am a male and a member of the Spirit Soul Race. I am just Rong Ruo’s secondary soul, and the real main soul was my sister, so...” At that point, Rong Ruo did not know what else to do other than to deliver the cruel truth to Fei Yan.
