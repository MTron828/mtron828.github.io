Ye Sha still wanted to say something but after being glared at by Ye Gu, he finally closed his mouth.

“In three days, I no longer want to see any Palaces related to the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. Do you understand?” Jun Wu Xie said in a sharp tone.

“Your subordinate obeys!” Ye Sha and the others said in unison.

“In a month’s time, wash the Nine Temples with blood. You may go.” Jun Wu Xie waved her hand and dismissed them.

The three of them immediately retreated.

Until the three of them had left the main hall, Ye Sha raised his eyebrows and looked puzzled. Ye Mei was by his side glared at him in silence.

“You are really a fool! Why the heck did you have to mention the Rui Lin Army in front of Young Miss!” Ye Mei really wanted to slap Ye Sha silly.

Ye Sha looked back at Ye Mei innocently.

“I... I just thought that Young Miss must be worried about the people of the Lin Palace. It is not safe for the Rui Lin Army to appear in the Middle Realm that was why I thought of informing Young Miss and see if she had any arrangements.” Ye Sha really felt that he was innocent, after all, he was truly thinking for her. The Rui Lin Army was extremely important to her and if anything happened to them, then... wouldn’t Young Miss be sad?

“You really are....” Ye Mei glared at him hatefully.

“Both of you should just speak less. If there is any arrangement to be made, Young Miss would decide for herself.” Ye Gu who stood by the side let out a sigh.

Over the past five years, on the surface, it didn’t look as if there was any notable changes in Jun Wu Xie. However, only they knew that, the Young Miss... had changed indeed... Her heart had became colder.

In those five years, she had never been to any other place except for the Dark Regions. Ye Sha once asked if they should transmit the news of her being alive to the Lower Realm and she did not have any response. She had changed silently, she only had them in her eyes but this change to them was not something they were very happy to see.

This should not be part of her growth, but a distorted change that had been forced by the harsh realities that crashed down upon her.

Everything that happened then, to what depth that blow had triggered, only she herself knew.

From that day that Jun Wu Yao left, only Ye Mei himself saw the tears of Jun Wu Xie. It was at that moment that he finally understood that she had suffered a great stimulation. Over the following five years, he had never seen a single drop of tear from her, he had never seen the semblance of a smile and her expression was always cold and distant. There was no shred of emotions on her face and it was as if everything in this world could no longer affect her.

She was alive.

All just for revenge!

Revenge on the Upper Realm!

Ye Sha fell into silence, he has stayed by her side for the longest. The words he had said just now was not because he did not know how she felt but... He really could not bear to see her force herself into such a state and closed everything else away.

It was not easy for Young Miss to learn to smile, but on that fateful day five years ago, it has robbed her of all her smiles.

“Ye Gu.”

Suddenly, Jun Wu Xie’s voice sounded from behind and the three of them glanced at each other.

Ye Gu waved his hand and gestured to Ye Sha and Ye Mei to leave first before he turned around to enter the main hall once more. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“May I know what instructions does Young Miss have?” Ye Gu walked into the main hall and knelt down on one knee.

Sitting on the throne, Jun Wu Xie was stroking the fur of the black beast.

“Send people to keep watch. Don’t let... Anything happen to the Rui Lin Army.”
