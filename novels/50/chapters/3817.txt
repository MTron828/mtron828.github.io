“The soul bone?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows and looked at Luo Qingcheng. “Come get it yourself if you want it.”

The way Jun Wu Xie behaved was so casual and relaxing that her attitude had totally gotten Luo Qingcheng triggered. She couldn’t understand it at all. How could this rubbish who had once completely defeated by her still had the courage to speak in such an arrogant tone to her?

Because of Jun Wu Xie, Luo Qingcheng was blue in the face. Wei Ya and Xie Chang Ming who were standing behind Luo Qingcheng exchanged a look with each other and straight off spoke their words out.

“Such ignorant little bitch. Do you really think that we aren’t able to do anything to you just because you’re now standing in the Lower Realm? Let me tell you the truth, we don’t even need to put much effort in fighting with you. It’s just a matter of simply lifting a finger. Trash like you don’t deserve our attack, not even once.” Xie Chang Ming sneered. Before he met Jun Wu Xie, he had already imagine the figure of the person who had such boldness and recklessness to provoke the Upper Realm.

However, after seeing Jun Wu Xie in real life, Xie Chang Ming found out that the person was just a petite woman. She looked so weak and fragile. It seemed like she couldn’t even take one punch of his. Then, he looked at the five youths beside Jun Wu Xie. They were not that old and no matter how he observed, they didn’t look like some veterans who had long experienced the warfare at all. Xie Chang Ming couldn’t help but found everything he saw ridiculous.

“With this amount of people and you think that you are able to fight against the five hundred thousand forces we brought here. How funny!” Xie Chang Ming took a look at the Night Regime behind Jun Wu Xie. There weren’t many people in the Night Regime, the most an estimation of a hundred thousand of them. With only this amount of enemies, there was no way for them to stop the five hundred thousand armies!

“Stop struggling. Otherwise, you’re not going to die looking good!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

While looking at Xie Chang Ming who was acting all wild and presumptuous, Jun Wu Xie slightly raised her brows. There wasn’t any emotion shown in her cold eyes.

“Not going to die looking good? But I feel like you guys look worse,” said Jun Wu Xie all of a sudden.

Xie Chang Ming stared at Jun Wu Xie in confusion with his eyebrows frowning a bit, whereas the expression of Wei Ya who was standing beside him turned dark immediately.

Since they entered the Lower Realm, they kept on suffered from the attacks of the mutated behemoths, causing them to be pressed for time when having rest, let alone tidying up themselves. Furthermore, the movements of those mutated behemoths during every attack were so big that the dust and soil were always flying everywhere. This had made the army of the Upper Realm who were at first marching valiantly and spiritedly to be covered with dust while on the opposite side, every single person from the Night Regime who was standing behind Jun Wu Xie looked smart and energetic!

Xie Chang Ming took quite a long time to realize the actual meaning hidden in Jun Wu Xie’s words, causing the expression on his face to turn dull at the moment.

Not to mention the Gold Spirits from the Upper Realm, even Wei Ya and him were both worn out and weary in these few days. They didn’t even have the time to wash themselves due to the continuous attacks from the mutated behemoths. The armour they wore were dirtied with dust and blood stains while their faces were all grey...

Once Xie Chang Ming recalled everything he went through the entire time, he was filled with extreme hatred to the point of clenching his teeth until they were going to break each other into pieces.

“You little bitch! You thought that you are able to stop us just with those monsters?! You are really looking down on the Upper Realm! Today, I will definitely let you know how you actually look like!” Xie Chang Ming bellowed.

Jun Wu Xie glanced over Xie Chang Ming’s twisted face without any concern and calmly, she said. “Well, I look good.”

“...” Xie Chang Ming was so angry that he almost spat his blood out after listening to Jun Wu Xie’s words.

When did he said that she was good looking!

This little bitch looked so cool but why the words she spoke once a time would always got on his nerves!
