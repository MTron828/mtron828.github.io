Chapter 2986 The four knights 5

On top of the Top Ten Experts, was the Knight of Destruction. Chi Yan’s words had been very obvious. His Lord intended to make Jun Wu Xie the fifth Destruction Knight!

There was no slight change of expression on Jun Wu Xie’s face. She just looked at Chi Yan calmly. When she came to the Sacred City, if the first invitation she received was to join the ranks as a Knight of Destruction, Jun Wu Xie might not be so surprised. After all, the strength of the Dual Spirit Ring had surpassed the ordinary exponent. She was bound to stand at one of the highest levels. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But the arrangement of His Lord made Jun Wu Xie somewhat surprised. To Jun Wu Xie, the selection of the Top Ten Experts was as simple as playing a game. His Lord was aware of it, but he still allowed her to participate. After she revealed her true strength, His Lord once again sent out an invitation. This time the invitation was the Knight of Destruction that Jun Wu Xie had guessed before.

This arrangement couldn’t help but make people feel a little elusive, and as Han Zifei said that His Lord’s thoughts were really not easy to guess.

“Lord Yan?” Chi Yan couldn’t wait for Jun Wu Xie’s response, and frowned involuntarily. In his view, any orders from His Lord was like a gift. Jun Wu Xie didn’t immediately thank him. Instead she showed some hesitation. This intriguing hesitation made Chi Yan quite dissatisfied. He seemed to feel that the majesty of His Lord was ignored by Jun Wu Xie.

“Why? Lord Yan, is being a Knight of Destruction not worth a second look?” Long Yao saw an opportunity to bump at Jun Wu Xie. Although that was what he said, he couldn’t wait for Jun Wu Xie to quarrel with him and reject the invitation of His Lord. It was best to make a big fuss, and completely tear the face with His Lord, this would be the best.

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes slightly, glanced at Long Yao coldly. She looked at Chi Yan and said: “His Lord’s arrangement, I shall obey.”

Jun Wu Xie always felt that there was something hidden behind His Lord’s work style. But she needed an opportunity to enter the tiger’s lair. If she retreated here, all her previous efforts would be in vain.

Chi Yan’s face eased a little, and nodded in satisfaction.

“The Knight of Destruction is dedicated to the existence of His Lord. Everything that we have was bestowed upon us by His Lord. Lord Yan, your strength is enough for you to become a Knight of Destruction. If you want to truly stand by His Lord, these are far enough. “Chi Yan’s words suddenly changed.

“After becoming a Knight of Destruction, you must be completely cut off from your past, whether it is your Sea Spirit City or the entire 72 Cities. After you become a Knight of Destruction, everything that you had will have nothing to do with you from now on. After that, you are no longer the owner of the Sea Spirit City. This is the memory and past. You have to give up, do you understand? ”

Give up her memory?

Jun Wu Xie’s heart jumped slightly. She subconsciously thought of Jun Gu’s plight. Previously, Nangong Lie once said that the Knights of Destruction appeared at very strange times. They seemed to appear out of thin air. As before, no one had ever seen them before they became the Knights of Destruction, let alone their origins.

Now it seems that the Destruction Knight may not be without the past. It was simply obliterated by His Lord. If she had not happened to meet Jun Gu in the Spirit World, the rhinoceros horn would have completely eliminated Jun Gu’s memory. If given a few years, Jun Gu would be like Long Yao and the rest. They would only be faithful dogs to His Lord, and forget everything they once were.
