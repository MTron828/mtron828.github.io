Everyone’s eyes widened in shock as they stared at Jun Wu Xie. They never dreamt that the purpose of this Banquet of Heroes was for Jun Wu Xie to unify the 72 cities under one.

At this point, not only was Nangong Yan’s expression dreadful, even the smile on Bai Zhu’s face had faded.

After so many years of in-fighting amongst the top ten cities, no one had emerged at the top. No one would also dare to be so arrogant as to announce that they would become the Overlord of the 72 Cities. In the end, the first that Jun Wu Xie appeared in front of the all the City Lords, and said such astounding words, the entire banquet was shaken to its core.

The strength of Sea Spirit City, the fall of Nangong Lie, and the congratulations of Highness Ying made the City Lords of the other cities afraid. But, those were not enough to make them bow down before Jun Wu Xie.

Bai Zhu frowned as he watched Jun Wu Xie. Even though he knew that the purpose of this Banquet of Heroes was not simple, he really did not expect that Jun Wu Xie’s appetite would be so big!

“Lord Yan, divisions within the 72 cities already exist. If you speak like this, aren’t you being a little too arrogant and conceited?” The City Lord of Austere Heart asked with a grimace.

Jun Wu Xie looked at him nonchalantly and replied calmly, “If anyone is dissatisfied, please issue your challenge.”

The City Lord of Austere Heart City said, “Lord Yan, we are now in your Sea Spirit City, and your Banquet of Heroes did not allow us to bring our guards. How can we dare to fight you?”

In the entire official residence, except for those City Lords, the rest present were under the command of Jun Wu Xie. If someone really wanted to challenge Jun Wu Xie, who knew if that person would still have a whole corpse? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At this moment, the City Lords have already severely cursed Jun Wu Xie in their hearts. If it was a one-on-one fight, most of them were confident that they would be able to defeat Jun Wu Xie. However, they were all trapped in a critical situation, who would dare to make the first move?

They had all thought that the Banquet of Heroes hosted by Jun Wu Xie was for her to fight for Sea Spirit City’s status within the 72 cities, so they attended to give her face. However, no one expected her intention to be so great. What she wanted was not simply a position within the 72 cities, but she wanted to rule over all the cities!

Jun Wu Xie said: “I promise that only I will fight, the rest of my men will not do anything.”

Jun Wu Xie’s remarks caused some changes in the expression of many City Lords, but still no one dared to step forward.

At this moment, Nangong Yan and Bai Zhu exchanged a glance. The two of them had fought for many years in order to obtain the Overlord position but they didn’t expect that halfway through, a Jun Wu Xie would appear.

Where vested interests were concerned, there were no eternal enemies or eternal friends.

If Bai Zhu was going to shame Nangong Lie in front of Jun Wu Xie, then now he was going to change directions.

Both men reached a consensus in each other’s eyes. Nangong Yan immediately changed his line of sight and whispered to the City Lord of Heaven Fiend City.

“Since Lord Yan is so confident, then I shall challenge you.” The City Lord of Heaven Fiend City stood up and walked over the open space of the banquet hall.

Heaven Fiend City was one of the top ten cities. Naturally, the strength of the City Lord of Heaven Fiend City was strong. The other City Lords were secretly relieved when they saw the challenger to be the City Lord of Heaven Fiend City. They were not top-tier cities, and the battle for power was irrelevant to them. However, if Jun Wu Xie really became the Overlord of the 72 cities, then their power would be reduced, and they obviously did not want to see that happen.
