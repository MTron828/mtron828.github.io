Jun Gu left too fast, such that Yan Xi could not even begin to stop him. Seeing Jun Gu’s departing figure disappeared in front of her, Yan Xi suddenly shuddered.

No!

Jun Gu can never enter a battlefield!

The never-before intense fear permeated Yan Xi’s heart.

When Jun Gu heard Jun Wu Xie, those three words, he displayed a vague sense of strangeness. Yan Xi did not dare to let the both of them meet!

Yan Xi’s vague gut feeling was that the woman who was with Jun Wu Yao, was actually Jun Wu Xie from the Lower Realm!

Yan Xi’s heart was filled with fear.

Jun Gu was from the Soul World, but she is not very clear about the origin of Jun Gu. She only knew that Jun Gu was the person who held the favour of His Lord, and even surpassed the importance previously attached to Luo Qingcheng. Jun Gu’s past had been wiped clean by His Lord. The only thing he remembered was his own name. No matter how his past was cleansed, he was not able to wipe clean Jun Gu, this name and thus this name as kept.

Jun Gu...Jun Wu Xie...

Even though there were many surnames in the Three Realms, the abject fear of Yan Xi’s heart was not reduced.

“Look after the Soul Sacrifice!” Under the great pressure of fear, Yan Xi did not dare to hesitate for a moment longer. She issued an order to that soldier and immediately gave chase after Jun Gu!

Within the Soul Mountain, the army of the Upper Realm was utterly defeated. Death here did not stain the area suddenly red as the death of souls would not leave even a trace.

Only the number of the army which had been steadily decreasing that made people look terrified.

On the battlefield, it became the playground of Poison Ivy. The vines that burrowed deep into the ground came and went without a trace, yet it could take away human life in an instant. The seeds of Blood Velvet dispersed with spread with his hands and feet and fell upon and was absorbed into the bodies of the Upper Realm soldiers, the seeds snatched their souls wildly.

The happiest thing on the battlefield was Corpse Flower. In the past, he was bullied till he could not speak, but now, he was now without any scruples. His body, which was thick and strong, was like a meat grinder on a rampage. Anyone who wanted to escape was blocked by Crystal Orchid’s ice wall, awaiting their demise.

On the entire battlefield, the soldiers from the Upper Realm mourned, and the war showed a one-sided situation.

Jun Wu Xie was a killing machine reincarnate. She swept through the whole area, with her current strength, the existence of Upper Realm soldiers were like ants.

With a raised hand, a soldier from the Upper Realm flew, and the figure of Jun Wu Xie once again turned into a flowing light which rushed into the battle.

Just as she was about to start killing more, a cold intent suddenly came from behind her!

Jun Wu Xie changed her direction in almost an instant, the moment her body flew up, a huge crater was blasted into the spot she was previously standing on!

Jun Wu Xie was shocked, and before she could even think more closely, a voice drilled into her ears. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Little Miss, you have good capabilities.” The voice was gentle and smiling, but it was contrary to the fierceness on the battlefield. As Jun Wu Xie was about to look up to see the owner of the voice, that person had already turned into a black shadow, so fast that even Jun Wu Xie couldn’t see clearly!

Astonishment floated into the heart of Jun Wu Xie, she did not expect that there was such an exponent in the Upper Realm, but there was no time to consider further as the shadow had already come at her again!

The speed of the man was extremely fast, and Jun Wu Xie could only use all her power to defend, the two figures flashes, but they couldn’t see each other’s appearance.
