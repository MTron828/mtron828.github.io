Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

These women were all selected from the Sacred Maiden Tribe as the most suitable to conceive the next generation. Tonight they were gathered together for the banquet, and each one was beautifully dressed.

It was hard to imagine that, with the status of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, that one day, these women would be gathered together to be selected by another person. If this news reached the 72 cities, there would be many people who would be surprised.

Han Shu was the most eye-catching tonight. She was wearing a white long dress, embroidered with silver lines. It looked like nothing special at first glance, but under the lights, the silver lines glittered as if stars were draped over her body. wearing a star-like beauty. The white dress contrasted her long black hair, along with that exquisite face, and she stood out greatly among all the flowers.

“Han Shu.” Duan Qi was satisfied when she saw how Han Shu was dressed today.

Han Zheng stepped forward and greeted, “Elder Duan.”

“You have dressed well today.” Duan Qi said, she rarely gave praise.

Han Xuan was pleased that the tips of her brows rose, but she fought hard to repress her pleasure, lest it ruined her beautiful make up.

“Thank you Elder Duan for complimenting me. Women should dress up for their beholders. Han Shu also hopes that today, someone can appreciate the beauty of Han Shu.”

The position of the Holy Son provoked Han Shu’s will to fight, and today’s meeting with Han Zi Fei made it rose even more. No matter who the other party was, as long as she could beat Han Zi Fei, she would do her best to fight!

“Have you passed on my message to Han Zi Fei?” Elder Yun asked, she didn’t care about how Han Shu was today. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Han Shu lowered his eyes as she tried to restrain the resistance in her eyes and replied obediently, “Yes, I have.”

“Oh? What did she say?” Duan Qi asked.

“The Sacred Maiden didn’t seem to have much interest in today’s banquet. I spent a bit of effort but I’m not sure if the Sacred Maiden has taken heed of your words.” Han Shu bad-mouthed Han Zi Fei without batting an eyelid.

Sure enough, Duan Qi’s brow was already furrowed.

Duan Qi didn’t like Han Zi Fei. She was so inflexible and rude. Even though Han Zi Fei was the Sacred Maiden, she still had to be disciplined by the elders. And Han Zi Fei’s escape from the Upper Realm had made Duan Qi very dissatisfied with her. If it wasn’t for the fact that the next Sacred Maiden had yet to present herself, and also that Han Zi Fei had requested His Lord to betrothed her to someone, Duan Qi would never have tolerated the existence of a rebel.

“Well, it is said she changed, but I think she’s still the same. I don’t know how she did it but she actually managed to get His Lord to forgive her transgressions, and even arrange a marriage for her. Such bewitching sorcery, and to think that she is our Sacred Maiden. It’s completely disgusting.” Duan Qi didn’t give any leeway as she showed her disgust for Han Zi Fei.

Han Shu held a trace of smugness in her eyes as she secretly smiled.

But Elder Yun had replied, “Forget it, she has been like that since she was a child. Since she has returned, let’s not bring up the past. Besides, she will marry Lord Gu in a few days and leave Holy Mountain. Bringing these issues up will make others look down upon our Sacred Maiden Tribe. How Han Zi Fei is, is not important, what is important is the reputation of our Sacred Maiden Tribe.”

The words of Elder Yun calmed Duan Qi’s dissatisfaction slightly.

At this moment, the handmaid from outside the hall informed them that Jun Wu Xie had already arrived outside the hall. Duan Qi and Elder Yun looked at each other and immediately adjusted their emotions.

“Hurry, bring him in!”

After a moment, Jun Wu Xie walked into the hall alone. Tonight’s banquet, Duan Qi only invited her. Even Jun Wu Yao and the others were not allowed to participate, so Jun Wu Xie had to attend the banquet alone.
