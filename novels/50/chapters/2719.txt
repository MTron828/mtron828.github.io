Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

However, the soldiers’ reaction made Dongfang Ku Bi very angry. They seemed to not hear Dongfang Ku Bi shouting as they still shriveled their necks and dared not extend their heads.

Dongfang Ku Bi was trembling in anger, but there was no time to fuss with the soldiers. He immediately ascended the gate to see what the situation was outside his city, but when he saw the scene outside the city, he was instantly shocked...

Outside the city, there were a lot of soldiers dressed in black light armor. Each of them was aggressive, and with a sweeping glance, there were tens of thousands of them!

Dongfang Ku Bi’s eyes widened instantly. The tens of thousands of soldiers in front of him, in terms of demeanour or imposing aura, they were not inferior to any army from a big city. How was it that they did not look like they had just ended a battle?

“This ... this is the army of the Sea Spirit City?” Dongfang Ku Bi felt as he had been slapped. Those words that he had just yelled at the soldiers now sounded so funny.

Heavy losses?

Where can it be seen that such a group of iron-blooded lions had just suffered heavy losses?

No matter how you looked at it, it was also a group of crazy warriors who were ready to go to war at any time!!

However, before Dongfang Ku Bi could sober up from his shock at Sea Spirit City’s military momentum, a cold light flew towards him from outside the city!

Dongfang Ku Bi mobilized his body’s spiritual power almost instantly, as he speedily avoided that cold light. However, the sharp airflow of the cold light managed to leave a bloodstain on his cheek!

An arrow was nailed to the pillar behind Dongfang Ku Bi, and half of the arrow was deeply embedded into a column made of mahogany. There was only fierceness there, which made Dongfang Ku Bi’s expression pale.

The person who released this arrow was at least at the pinnacle of Gold Spirit!

At this moment, Dongfang Ku Bi could understand why the soldiers under his command didn’t dare to take the lead. Anyone who dared to stick out his head would be shot into a hedgehog by arrows. After all, not everyone possessed Dongfang Ku Bi’s skills, to be able to escape this attack.

“Damn it! What exactly does Sea Spirit City want?” Dongfang Ku Bi was shocked and started to cold sweat. He didn’t think that the people in Sea Spirit City were so crazy, that they even dared to shoot an arrow at him!

Little did they know...

“You idiot! You shot at the wrong person!” Outside the city, Fei Yan raised his hand and gave Qiao Chu a punch.

Qiao Chu looked at Fei Yan sadly, clutching his chest, “Did I shoot wrongly?”

Fei Yan waved his hands and a portrait appeared, the person in the portrait looked exactly the same as Dongfang Ku Bi.

“Didn’t you prepare well before you came here? You didn’t look carefully at the portrait of the Lord of East Peak City that Zheng Weilong painted for us? The person you just shot at is Dongfang Ku Bi!! We managed to get him to appear in front of us and you shot at him! What if you killed him? See if I don’t strangle you!” Fei Yan looked like he was about to strangle Qiao Chu, scaring Qiao Chu that he hid behind Hua Yao and sought shelter.

“Don’t blame me. Who knew that the Lord of the City will appear suddenly, and besides that he looks casual, I didn’t know that he is the Lord of the City. I’m just following the orders of Little Xie, and shoot at the person who sticks his head out ...” Qiao Chu said, albeit guiltily.

“No need to explain, the real reason is that you are stupid! If I knew you’d spoil things, I should have just made you cook for our troops!” Fei Yan glared at Qiao Chu. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qiao Chu narrowed his neck and muttered.

“I’m willing to do it, the question is do you dare to eat ...”
