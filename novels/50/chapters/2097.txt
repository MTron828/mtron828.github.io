Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Hand my Master over!” The Second Disciple said to Jun Wu Xie through tightly clenched teeth, looking quite a miserable sight from having run the entire way.

Having been pointed out, the Beast Spirits then turned to look at Jun Wu Xie and that was when they suddenly discovered that the person Jun Wu Xie was holding in her hands was Wu Jiu, the Spirit Master! !

Wu Jiu had fallen into a semi conscious state. Although Jun Wu Xie had been rather gentle with the Beast Spirits, she was rather brutal towards Wu Jiu. Wu Jiu was already severely wounded and having taken that kick from Jun Wu Xie with her full strength, he was now slipping into unconsciousness, unable to even say a word.

The Beast Spirits who had not gone to the Serene Spirit Tower were stunned, thinking that the situation before their eyes did not seem right no matter how they looked at it. Many of their fellow Beast Spirits had wounds on their bodies and the human spirits were looking rather aggressive while Jun Wu Xie was even holding Wu Jiu in her hands..... Looking at the circumstances, something big seemed to be brewing....

Flame Dragon had landed before the gathered Beast Spirits, and after he put down the Beast Spirits on its back, its immense body that was as big as a small mountain blocked out the venomous gaze the Second Disciple was staring at Jun Wu Xie with. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“This is the Beast Spirits’ territory, and it’s not a place you can do as you please.”

“Flame Dragon, does this mean you are going against us now?” The Second Disciple said as he glared at Flame Dragon.

Flame Dragon was not to be cowered. “Since you have tried to capture our Spiritual Bear, I do not have to show you any courtesy.”

The moment those words came out from Flame Dragon’s mouth, the puzzled Beast Spirits immediately realized the severity of the situation!

[The human spirits captured their Spiritual Bear?]

All the Beast Spirits turned their heads uniformly upon the enormous dark gold figure, surprise showing in all their eyes.

[The Spiritual Bear!]

[It’s really the Spiritual Bear!]

The Second Disciple was feeling highly frustrated, but worried about Wu Jiu’s safety, he then wanted to lead his men to charge forward, completely regarding everything else.

But the Beast Spirits who had regained their senses immediately realized that the human spirits would harm the Spiritual Bear and despite still not having a full picture of what was exactly happening, just that one point alone was enough to make them step forward!

“Roar!”

“This is the territory of the Beast Spirits, and we do not welcome the intrusion of the human spirits!”

The Beast Spirits close by came running at almost the same moment to Flame Dragon’s side, their enormous bodies blocking Jun Wu Xie completely and securely. The densely packed rows of Beast Spirits grew more and more, the flying Beast Spirits quickly spreading the news to reach the ears of every single Beast Spirit at the fastest speed possible!

The matter concerned the Spiritual Bear, and not a single Beast Spirit would stand back and do nothing.

In just the blink of an eye, several thousand Beast Spirits came walking out from their lairs. They all came speeding straight towards Flame Dragon’s side.

In mere moments, the number of Beast Spirits that gathered there had reached a staggering number.

The mass of Beast Spirits formed a impenetrable wall before the human spirits, as the rocky mountains sitting on both sides grew crowded with more and more Beast Spirits!

The Second Disciple stared in shock as he looked at the quickly increasing number of Beast Spirits who were rushing over with such lightning speed, having become more numerous than the combined numbers of them and the Weapon Spirits put together. At that moment, fear then rose up within the Second Disciple’s heart.

The Beast Spirits had always been the biggest and most numerous spirit race in the Spirit World, having stood at the top of the Spirit World’s food chain for a long period of time. Going against the Beast Spirits would definitely be a mistake as even the haughty and arrogant Wu Jiu had not dared to openly capture the Spiritual Bear because he had wanted to avoid going against the Beast Spirits in open conflict.

The shade of the Second Disciple’s face was becoming uglier and uglier. The Beast Spirits that could be seen everywhere one looked, their wary and guarded beastial gazes, caused the human spirits to lose all their earlier bravado, their shoulders slumping as they leaned inwards towards their centre, deeply fearful that they would be skinned and swallowed up alive by these Beast Spirits!
