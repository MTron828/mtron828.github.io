Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Corpse Flower was hung on the tree for an entire night, no matter how much Little Lotus pled, he could not save him.

The very next day, Jun Wu Xie went to the Spirit Palace early and this time, only the Spirit Lord was waiting for her. As for Qin Song and the others, they only needed to follow the arrangement and take over at the specific time.

After experiencing it once, the second round went by very smoothly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The next person after the Spirit Lord was Qin Song and after that was Long Jiu, followed by Situ Heng who was the last person for this second round.

After the previous disappointing experience, Long Jiu was determined to try his best to hold it for a longer time but in the end, the result was not very much different. When he could no longer hold on, he could only helplessly turn to look at Situ Heng who had entered the undergone Palace not too long ago.

Situ Heng seemed to have placed all the prejudice he had against Jun Wu Xie away and today he had made it on time. This made Long Jiu secretly heave a sigh of relief.

“I... can’t hold on any longer. Situ, let’s switch?” Long Jiu looked at Situ Heng and smiled bitterly.

Situ Heng walked over not say a word and immediately took over the control of the soul thread.

The moment Long Jiu retracted his own soul power, he slumped to the ground in exhaustion and lay flat. The process of this suppression was not complicated but to continuously transmit soul power was draining for him. When he turned his head and saw the indifferent Situ Heng who was concentrating hard, his lips could not help but curl up into a smile.

“Situ, I’ve misunderstood you. I really didn’t think that you would be willing to help this little lass. I thank you on her behalf.” Long Jiu struggled to sit up as he beamed.

However, Situ Heng did not pay any attention to the words of Long Jiu, all he did was control the soul thread with his usually indifferent face. Long Jiu felt a little embarrassed as he touched his nose awkwardly and pulled himself up quietly. After standing at the side for some time to determine that there was nothing out of the ordinary, he then left.

Only after Long Jiu left that on Situ Heng’s indifferent face, a smile that had a hint of contempt appeared.

Help Jun Wu Xie? He had to be kidding. Why would he?

Situ Heng’s sinister gaze fell onto Jun Wu Xie who was currently meditating with her eyes closed. In the midst of all the viciousness’s swirling in his eyes, there wasn’t any of the urgency from before.

Over the past few days, when the others were helping Jun Wu Xie suppress all the chaotic energies in her body, Situ Heng had been deep in contemplation. With Jun Wu Xie’s current state, it was not hard to wreck her soul, even if he did not do it directly, as long as there was a sudden interruption to the control of the soul thread, Jun Wu Xie’s soul would sustain heavy damage. However..... This was not enough to kill her.

Although Situ Heng disdained Jun Wu Xie, but he had to admit that over the five years, her growth had indeed exceeded his expectations. Even if she was seriously injured, if she wanted to kill him, it would not be an impossible task.

Jun Wu Xie was a thorn that Situ Heng had to remove. He could not leave such a person who harboured such strong enmity against the Upper Realm who possessed such an outstanding talent to continue to live.

However, at the same time, he did not wish to put himself in any potential danger. If he rushed things, it would only result in losses for both sides. He clearly had the advantage, so how could he do anything stupid?

After pondering over it for a few days, Situ Heng finally thought of an insidious plan. He would not let anything happen to her suddenly nor would he allow her to discover anything out of the ordinary. He would let her greet death without her knowing and at the same time, her death would bring about even more chaos and mayhem.
