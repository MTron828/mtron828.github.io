Chapter 143: “Insidious Woman (1)”

Within the Imperial Palace, Mo Xuan Fei looked on nervously at the fifty Yu Lin Army soldiers with Bai Yun Xian standing beside him. Behind them several palace maids held up trays of medicinal wine. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yun Xian, you asked to summon them here, what do we do next?” Mo Xuan Fei queried.

Bai Yun Xian looked at the fifty Yu Lin Army soldiers with a sinister gleam in her eyes.

“I have something good for them. This is medicinal wine from the Qing Yun Clan, it greatly speeds up the development of spiritual powers with your training. With the Rui Lin Army running rampant, we need to raise the power of the Yu Lin Army as well.

Mo Xuan Fei looked at Bai Yun Xian blankly, and hesitated a moment but kept his silence.

The fifty Yu Lin Army soldiers were joyous at the news. They were just ordinary soldiers and having been suddenly summoned by the Second Prince, they were rather antsy. Over the past few days, with the Rui Lin Army having the Imperial City locked down, the Yu Lin Army was powerless to retaliate, and they were forced to hole up within the Imperial Palace.

The Emperor had not made any moves either, that night’s clash with the mighty Rui Lin Army had the Yu Lin Army turn into mice. They did not dare engage the Rui Lin Army in any form of conflict.

The men were thinking that they would be thrown into an arduous mission, but what a surprise! They were presented with such a heavenly gift!

All things from Qing Yun Clan were treasures beyond compare!

“You men are the selected elite of the Yu Lin Army, and protecting the Emperor is your duty. This medicinal wine will help you become strong within a short period of time.” Bai Yun Xian waved her hand forward and the palace maids brought the wine to the soldiers.

The Yun Lin Army soldiers held the cups gingerly, looking at their cups longingly.

Sinister malice flashed just a moment in the eyes of Bai Yun Xian and quickly returned to normal.

“Drink up, brave soldiers, you shall gain the strength to protect the Emperor.” she coaxed tenderly.

The fifty soldiers downed the wine in a single gulp. The bitter medicinal wine burned in their bellies, and the soldiers started to feel hot, the effect showing on their bodies as they turned a shade redder. They could feel the spiritual powers within them churning, as though they were growing, and the soldiers rejoiced at their perceived heightened powers.

“The Jun Family has been antagonizing the Imperial Family, and you men shall become the heroes that saved the Imperial City! Tonight, you will be secretly deployed to several allocated stations spread throughout the Imperial City. Once you are there, stand down and hide your identities. Stay within the rooms provided and concentrate on your training till the day we launch our counterattack, the day you see glory!” Bai Yun Xian swept her eyes over the soldiers, as she incited the men into fervour.

They were bestowed with the rare medicinal wine from Qing Yun Clan, and entrusted with such an important mission for the Imperial Family. It seemed their moment has come! To soar to new heights!

No one among them doubted Bai Yun Xian but were extremely grateful for the favour shown to them.

“For now, go back and rest up, and disguise yourselves as common citizens. You are the hope of the Kingdom. Do not allow your identities to be exposed as the safety of the Imperial City lies in your hands.” Bai Yun Xian beamed at them, her pretty face seemingly to shine with pride for them. The Yu Lin Army soldiers were captivated and stared foolishly for a long while, till Mo Xuan Fei’s irritated look drove them scrambling out.
