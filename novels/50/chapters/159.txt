Chapter 160: “Playing Judge (2)”

Since Mo Xuan Fei had always regarded himself far superior above the others, with his snobbish persona and high almighty attitude, from now on, let him have a taste of looking up at others instead.

“Jun Wu Xie! You’re mad! When are you going to stop being so crazy? My master will soon arrive in the Imperial City, at that time, I’ll make sure you....”

*Slap* *Slap* *Slap*

Before Bai Yun Xian could finish scolding, Jun Wu Xie raised her hands and ruthlessly slapped her delicate hands across Bai Yun Xian’s face three times!

This time she held nothing back as she gave three resounding slaps across Bai Yun Xian’s delicate face.

The three slaps were so loud and sudden that even Mo Qian Yuan who was standing nearby shrank his neck back in response.

How merciless!

“I asked you to save someone, why are you still sprouting so much nonsense?”

Bai Yun Xian reeled back in shock, never had she thought that in this world, someone actually had the audacity to hit her!

Bai Yun Xian had her hand on her burning cheek, as she stood there momentarily stunned, yet to wake from the shock of being hit.

The Emperor was dumbfounded, this Jun Wu Xie was really crazy! She actually dared to hit Bai Yun Xian?!

“You...You dare to hit me?!” Bai Yun Xian’s voice was trembling, full of indignation as she pointed at Jun Wu Xie, her whole body shaking with anger.

Jun Wu Xie looked at her indifferently as she stepped forward and gave another tight slap across Bai Yun Xian’s face, raised her leg and ruthlessly kicked Bai Yun Xian’s chest which sent her flying.

“Would you like me to verify that again?” Jun Wu Xie’s lips curled up into a blossoming smile.

Bai Yun Xian’s mouth hung a trace of blood, by now her hair was completely disheveled, gone were her haughtiness and elegance, they were replaced by dread and fear. She was looking at Jun Wu Xie with eyes that reflected terror in them, she felt as if she was looking at the devil.

In Qing Yun Clan, Bai Yun Xian always had an exalted status and no one had ever dared to even touch her as they all held her in reverence.

However, all that had changed ever since she met Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie simply answered with her actions that not only did she dare beat her, she was not going to go soft on her as well.

For the first time in her life, Bai Yun Xian finally understood the word fear as she experienced it first hand, crumbling all her defences and washing away all her pride.

“Drag her over.” Jun Wu Xie turned her head slightly her head and looked at the two Rui Lin soldiers behind her.

They both took uniform strides towards Bai Yun Xian, each held one arm of hers and dragged her over to Jun Wu Xie.

Bai Yun Xian attempted to struggle free but to no avail. Her opponent was the Rui Lin Army as each man held her firmly with an iron grip in front of Jun Wu Xie.

“You... you... you cannot touch me! My master is Qing yun Clan’s Sovereign...” Bai Yun Xian was like a trembling little mouse standing in front of a cat. Bai Yun Xian looked at Jun Wu Xie with a pair of pleading eyes, this was the first time she had ever met such a crazy person who completely disregarded Qing Yun Clan. Despite using such tactics, Bai Yun Xian could feel that in the eyes of Jun Wu Xie, Qing Yun Clan was like an ant.

“Oh?” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes, raised her hands and landed another resounding slap across Bai Yun Xian’s face.

“Qing Yun Clan, was is it?”

Bai Yun Xian stared at Jun Wu Xie with her mouth agape, she felt her scalp go numb, feeling as if she was falling deep into the depths of hell. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Get up and save your lover. He can’t stand now and all he can rely on is you, Qing Yun Clan’s disciple.” Jun Wu Xie sneered as the two soldiers immediately grasped her intentions as they dragged Bai Yun Xian over to Mo Xuan Fei’s side.

Bai Yun Xian was scared witless from Jun Wu Xie’s sudden change in disposition and when she looked at Mo Xuan Fei’s knees she could not help but tremble even more.
