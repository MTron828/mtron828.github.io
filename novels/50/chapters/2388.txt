Chapter 2389: Concern

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Sorry.” Jun Wu Xie said sincerely, while they were staging the play, she had clearly seen everyone’s worries and although she felt guilty but she had to continue acting on.

“What are you saying?!” Qiao Chu stared at her and said, “Is there a need to apologize between us? Little Xie, are you treating us as outsiders? Oh, I am so sad...” Qiao Chu pretended as he struck his own chest with exaggeration, to the point that Hua Yao and the others around him looked at him as if they were looking at an idiot.

This little brat, he was never serious no matter what occasion it was.

Jun Wu Xie was startled by Qiao Chu’s reaction and the corner of her lips curled up slightly. There was a hint of laughter that she could not hold in but in the end she did not laugh out.

“The matters of today were shocking, all is good as long as you are fine.” Rong Ruo smiled sweetly as she looked at Jun Wu Xie.

No matter what, as long as Jun Wu Xie was safe and sound, they felt assured.

“Cough... I think that... Everything is not over yet.” Fan Zhuo who was by the side suddenly said.

Everybody could not help but looked at him.

Not over yet?

Was there any danger that they had overlooked?

Just as he finished his words, several figures clamoured and rushed into the room.

A loud and anxious voice rang out in the room.

“Where is Little Xie? What the hell is going on?!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Jun Xian strode hurriedly into the room with large steps with Jun Qing and Long Qi following closely behind. When the figure of Jun Wu Xie fell into his line of sight, Jun Xian’s face immediately stiffened.

“Little Xie? Are you all right? What happened?” Jun Xian grabbed his granddaughter’s hand and looked at her carefully, making sure that she was fine. His hands were trembling and only after sweeping his gaze up and down several times did he ascertain that there was nothing wrong with her did he relax a little.

The moment he saw Jun Xian, Qiao Chu immediately lowered his head with a guilty conscience.

How could he have forgotten this!

“Grandfather? Why are all of you here?” Jun Wu Xie was surprised and looked at the anxious Jun Xian and Jun Qing. She did not understand why her grandfather and uncle would suddenly appear in the Spirit World.

“Qiao Chu and the others had sent an urgent message and said that you... Cough... Well, it’s no longer important. Tell me what happened? Is your soul all right?” Jun Qing stood by her side and looked at her with concern.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head, but her heart had already understood everything clearly.

It must have been Qiao Chu and the others who thought that she was in danger and had sent an urgent message to the Lower Realm. This had alerted Jun Xian and Jun Qing and sent them here in a flash.

Thinking of this, Jun Wu Xie’s gaze could not help but wander off towards Qiao Chu and gang.

They immediately avoided her gaze, some lowered their heads while some turned their heads to admire the wall, their methods of avoiding was extremely childish!

In Jun Wu Xie’s heart, she let out a sigh. She had underestimated her companions’ concern for herself and she knew that they did it out of good intention. She also knew that the little play that she staged had scared them. She could only look at Jun Xian and said gently, “Grandfather, I’m fine. It’s just that a little accident happened, the cultivation method that the Spirit Lord taught me is very special. Qiao Chu and the rest did not know and misunderstood. Look, am I not standing here before you? All fine?”

Even if she said that, Jun Xian was still ill at ease. He pulled her to the Spirit Lord and started asking questions.

The Spirit Lord understood tacitly as he smiled and reassured Jun Xian that her soul was fine. Only after his repeated reassurance that there was nothing out of the ordinary did Jun Xian put down all his worries.
