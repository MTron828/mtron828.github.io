Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“The Lin Palace?” Jun Gu frowned. With a stinging pain suddenly transmitted into his brain, the smile on his face disappeared, and there came a trace of agony emerging from the bottom of his eyes.

It was as if his dizzy brain had been churned up by someone using a knife, it felt extremely painful.

The words “Lin Palace” was just like a lightning bolt, striking into his brain, illuminating the pictures that had been long buried under his memory.

Pieces of pictures flashed across his mind!

While being in a daze, he seemed to have seen a familiar building. In the tranquil yard, there seemed to be an elderly, dressed in a light armor, admonishing him about something.

However, everything came so suddenly and also disappeared in such a quick speed, that Jun Gu couldn’t catch a look of anything at all in the middle of the great pain.

“Have you forgotten everything? The Lin Palace? The Rui Lin Army? Grandfather and little uncle?” Jun Wu Xie kept pushing on him. The reaction of Jun Gu had given her some hope. Eagerly, she wanted to know the answer.

“What are you... talking about...” A sharp pain came overwhelming and Jun Gu felt that his brain was almost going to explode. Scurrily, he stepped backwards with one of his hands pressing on his temple, forcing himself to bear the pain which was constantly gushing over him.

The battle was still going on but no one had the guts to get near both of them, not even one step closer.

The colour on Jun Gu’s face was getting worse and worse. While pressing on his head in pain, he looked at Jun Wu Xie who was in front of his eyes, and it seemed like something was going to break through and burst out of his brain.

“Father... Can’t you remember it?” Brows furrowed, Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Gu.

Boom!

Jun Wu Xie’s words were just like a thunderbolt, striking into his brain!

Eyes slightly widening, he stared at Jun Wu Xie who was standing in front of him.

“What... What did you call me?”

Father?!

“Jun Wu Xie, this is the name that you and mother have given to me, don’t you remember?”

While looking at Jun Wu Xie in stunned, the acute pain in his head seemed to have completely disappeared at the moment. It was as if the havoc around him had gone so far away from him, and Jun Wu Xie’s voice was the only sound left in his ears.

Father... Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She said that he was her father.

But...

Why couldn’t he recall anything?

“Jun Wu Xie, my... daughter?” Toilsomely, Jun Gu spoke Jun Wu Xie’s name. They were such simple words, but the moment when the words left his tongue, his throat felt so painful, as if it had been cut by a sharp blade.

Jun Wu Xie slightly nodded.

Suddenly, the perplexity in Jun Gu’s eyes disappeared. He looked sober, as if he had just woken up from a dream. Dumbly, he looked at Jun Wu Xie.

It was as if the fog that was winding around his brain all the time had been dispersed by the strike of lightning. The dusty memory began to emerge and it seemed like those... clear and vivid scenes were narrating the past story which he had long forgotten.

When he was young, he was dressed in an armor, involving himself in the military expedition with his father, and after becoming an adult, he was the one who had led the Rui Lin Army and conquered the battlefield. Showering under the moonlight while standing in the sea of flowers, he held his wife’s hand and stood beside her...

He had no idea how long had these scenes been forgotten, but they were so clear and lucid.

Suddenly, the corners of the lips of Jun Gu hooked up and curved into a fond and gentle smile.

“You’ve grown up so much?” Jun Gu lifted his hand up and caressed naturally on Jun Wu Xie’s head.

Jun Wu Xie’s heart throbbed.

“Why am I here?” Jun Gu looked around. Everything in front of him felt so unfamiliar to him. He clearly remembered that... he was dead. Amid the flames of war, he had foreseen his death, but... why was he still alive?

While observing the change of Jun Gu, without having the time to think about any other things, Jun Wu Xie felt inwardly relieved.

She was right, he was her father!
