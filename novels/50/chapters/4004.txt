The sudden scenes had caused Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie to sink into a temporary state of bewilderment, but both the two hearts had successfully broken through the heavy clouds, with their perseverance and tenacious still remaining.

Even if it was their previous lives, so what?

Since they had already gone through reincarnations, were now using different bodies and had all their past memories removed, then these would be their rebirths. These were their brand new lives, and they had nothing to do with the previous lives.

The only thing that was worthy enough for them to feel sentimental about was the little bits of connection between them that was left after undergoing their reincarnations, which had led them in getting together. Though they appreciated it, they had no plans in inheriting everything about their past lives. The paths that they had walked on during their present lives were all paved by themselves, what had it to do with their previous lives?

Jun Wu Yao had finally understood the reason of him reacting abnormally during the moment when he saw the appearance of Jun Wu Xie’s soul. It might probably be the memory pieces from his previous life. There was too much obsession in it that it couldn’t be completely wiped off, but now, the uncontrollable emotions had totally disappeared. Jun Wu Yao was very sure about it, that the very last fixation had already vanished quietly.

Slowly, Jun Wu Yao moved a step backwards, slightly distanced himself away from Jun Wu Xie since now wasn’t the time for them to tangle themselves up in their previous lives that had long, just like the flowing water, gone. The most critical thing now was to remove the Contemporaneous Knot on the Spirit Tree and resolve the peril of the Soul World.

Little Lotus and the others had totally no idea about what both of them had just experienced. They were just thinking that Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie looked a little dazed, but very soon, they were back to normal. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After stabilizing the condition of her mind, Jun Wu Xie began to focus on delivering her soul power, and weird things never appeared again after that.

Everything went back into serenity. Poison Ivy and Blood Velvet were going really smooth with the elimination. No matter how hard Meng Qiu glared at them, even to the extent of making himself blind, he was still unable to alter the current situation. He could only looked at the halo emitted by the Spirit Tree spreading out bits by bits, with its brightness going from weak to strong. The kind of despair which he had never experienced before soared up from the bottom of his eyes...

It was up till the moment when Blood Velvet took out the last piece of Contemporaneous Knot using his roots that the Spirit Tree could finally regain its glory!

Blood Velvet and Poison Ivy drew themselves away from the Spirit Tree and Meng Qiu at the same time. The condition of Poison Ivy was rather good, but Blood Velvet seemed to have lost all his energy, causing him to straight off stumble onto the ground. He looked very weak with his pale face.

If it wasn’t for Jun Wu Xie who had acted as his support, Blood Velvet would probably not be able to fully remove the Contemporaneous Knot from the Spirit Tree even after using up all his soul power!

Jun Wu Xie raised her head up. Looking at the Spirit Tree who had gotten its halo spread all across itself, Jun Wu Xie slightly widened her eyes. The Spirit Tree before this had already given her a sacred feeling, and after the seal of the Contemporaneous Knot was removed, the Spirit Tree had also gotten to display its exact appearance. Those leaves that were originally sticking tightly together began to spread out little by little, whereas those vines that were dangling lifelessly on the branches suddenly started to swing gently. In just a twinkling, there came a gold halo covering on those green vines!

One of the vines that was enshrouded with the gold light slowly held itself aloft and stretched towards Jun Wu Xie. Subconsciously, Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao. Seeing that Jun Wu Yao slightly nodded his head to her, only then she chose not to avoid the upcoming vine.

When the vine touched the centre part between Jun Wu Xie’s eyebrows, a soft and gentle voice was suddenly heard inside her mind.

“Thank you, the kid who came from afar. You’ve let me free from the suffering. Welcome to the Soul World.”

The voice was as gentle as the water. Whoever that had heard it, even if it was only a sentence, he or she would naturally arouse the thoughts of protecting the voice inside them.

This was the voice of the Spirit Tree, and also the voice of the origin of all the souls in this world.
