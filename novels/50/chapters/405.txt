Chapter 406: “Unexpected Twist (1)”

Yin Yan was feeling uneasy as he paced within the faculty building. The uneasiness had started after Jun Wu Xie entered Gu Li Sheng’s office. Half an incense stick’s time passed and the two still had not appeared which only intensified Yin Yan’s worries.

That fact that Jun Xie had caused Gu Li Sheng to make an exception to personally recruit the boy into the Spirit Healer faculty early during enrollment and to decide to take in just one disciple for the year made Yin Yan very nervous.

Just as Yin Yan was still pacing worriedly, the door to the office was suddenly pushed open and Yin Yan hid hurriedly in a corner.

He saw only Gu Li Sheng by himself, bursting out of the office and slamming his door shut with a loud bang.

Yin Yan frowned, from what he had observed when Gu Li Sheng left his office, he instinctively felt that things were not as bad as it seemed.

Gu Li Sheng had always been amicable to everyone, to both disciples of the Spirit Healer faculty and to disciples from the other faculties. He was always good natured and steady, never seen to have lost his cool. Unlike today, when he had stepped out of his office in a fluster and walked off hurriedly.

“Did that brat Jun Xie cause Master to be so flustered?” Yin Yan whispered softly to himself.

Very soon, Yin Yan got the answer to his query.

It had been less than two hours before Gu Li Sheng hurried back. He went straight into his office and moments later, Jun Xie walked out through the door. And Yin Yan noticed one fine detail. When Jun Xie came out of the office, the jade badge that was hanging upon his chest had been removed. The jade badge that proved that one was from the Spirit Healer faculty.

His heart leapt when he spotted that point.

After Jun Wu Xie came out the office, she had immediately walked out of the Spirit Healer faculty, never once looking back.

The series of actions by Jun Xie that Yin Yan observed from the shadows, told Yin Yan that Jun Xie had been expelled from the Spirit Healer faculty! !

Within just a short day, news of Jun Xie being expelled from the Spirit Healer faculty spread quickly throughout the Zephyr Academy.

If it had been anyone else, it might not have attracted so much attention, but Jun Xie had already caused such a big commotion all the way from his enrollment to his first day at the academy. By now, not a single person within the Zephyr Academy had not heard of the name, Jun Xie.

He was assumed to have been admitted into the academy in glory and the future held endless possibilities for him. A boy so blessed with fortune was admitted into the Spirit Healer faculty but had unexpectedly been expelled from the faculty just hours after he had first stepped in there! His fall came so quickly and unexpectedly and that put everyone in great shock!

The Spirit Healer faculty had expelled unsuitable disciples through their doors before, but that was after a whole school year’s observation before it was decided. But in Jun Xie’s case, he had just gone to the Spirit Healer faculty barely hours into his first day there when he was unceremoniously driven out! That was surely the first time the Spirit Healer faculty had done that!

The news spread swiftly, like wildfire in a dry field. The youths who had been deeply envious and jealous of Jun Xie, had upon hearing the news, rejoiced at Jun Xie’s downfall.

The endlessly fortunate brat that gained the hatred of everyone just the day before, had now become the biggest joke in the academy!

It had taken only a blink of the eye for Jun Xie to fall facedown into the mud from her envied position high in the clouds!

In just one day, Jun Xie had, from being the object of everyone’s envy, suddenly turned into the butt of everyone’s joke.

All of this, was unknown to Jun Wu Xie. After she had left the Spirit Healer faculty grounds, Jun Wu Xie had returned to the dormitory. It was the time when everyone else were engaged with their training and the whole dormitory was empty, with her being the only person there.

As she sat down at the side of her bed, Jun Wu Xie pulled out a jade badge carved into the brand of the Beast Spirit faculty.

It was given to her by Gu Li Sheng himself, before she left that office.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
