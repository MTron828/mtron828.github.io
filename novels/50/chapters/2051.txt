Wu Jiu swept his gaze over Flame Dragon and the others before leading Jiang Yun Long out from the place.

“Master, we’re leaving just like that?” Jiang Yun Long suppressed his voice to whisper beside Wu Jiu’s ear. Wu Jiu’s meeting with Flame Dragon and the others had been so short Jiang Yun Long just could not believe it.

“It was already enough.” Wu Jiu’s eyes flashed with a trace of venomous mirth and his gaze swung unnoticeably towards the few Beast Spirits standing not too far away from the entrance of the Flame Dragon’s cave.

It did not matter whether Flame Dragon and the others believed his words or not as they would surely seek verification from the Spirit Lord. And no one knew better than Wu Jiu what the result of that would be. With everything that he said outside the Flame Dragon’s cave today, it was believed that it would take long before it would spread throughout the three great spirit races. Even if Flame Dragon and the others wanted to hide it, it would not be possible to do it.

The corners of Wu Jiu’s mouth had a hint of chilling smile hanging off them as he slowly disappeared out of sight from Flame Dragon and the others.

It was until the figure of Wu Jiu had completely disappeared from sight that Flame Dragon then lowered its head, to look at Soul Slayer and Poison Ivy.

Poison Ivy had not once opened his mouth from beginning to end like today’s discussion had nothing to do with him at all. If not for the fact that Plant Spirits were well known to be eccentric and that Poison Ivy’s personality was like that, others might have found it strange.

“I will go seek affirmation from the Spirit Lord today, to see if Wu Jiu speaks the truth.” Soul Slayer’s tone was hard as steel, seemingly highly concerned about the Serene Spirit Tower.

Flame Dragon nodded its head, and expressed that it would verify it with the Spirit Lord as soon as possible as well, where Soul Slayer then took its leave.

“Do you want to come in to sit for awhile?” Flame Dragon looked at Poison Ivy. Although the two of them could not be considered to be close friends, they enjoyed friendly relations with each other.

The corners of Poison Ivy’s eyes lifted slightly, as he raised his head up to look at the enormous Flame Dragon.

“You should not have chosen to speak with Wu Jiu at this place.” Poison Ivy finally said.

“Oh? Is there anything inappropriate about it?” Flame Dragon asked, looking at Poison Ivy in incomprehension.

Poison Ivy curled up his lips. “Although the intelligence of Beast Spirits have developed quite a bit, but its still rather retarded. With that brain of yours, you’ll be played to death by Wu Jiu.” Poison Ivy’s voice was filled with thick contempt.

Flame Dragon was already used to that venomous tongue of Poison Ivy’s and did not feel displeased in anyway, but was more concerned with the meaning in Poison Ivy’s words.

“Is there anything strange in what Wu Jiu said earlier?” Flame Dragon then asked. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Poison Ivy shook his head.

“Everything he said was true. I believe there wasn’t a single word of untruth in all that he said today, including the matter about the Spirit Lord asking him to build the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, it would definitely be true as well. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have brought up the Spirit Lord’s name when he clearly knew that you do not trust him at all.”

“Since that’s the truth, then what is inappropriate about it?” Flame Dragon was even more confused. It found itself completely unable to understand what Poison Ivy was talking about.

Poison Ivy stood up and unraveled the vines as he stared at Flame Dragon in silence, his gaze slowly moving to look behind Flame Dragon.

Flame Dragon turned its head around uncomprehendingly and suddenly discovered that on the peak near to its cave, were several Beast Spirits showing high excitement in their eyes. Beast Spirits had very good hearing and their conversation with Wu Jiu earlier had not been consciously isolated with power of the spirit. Hence, every single word that Wu Jiu said to Flame Dragon earlier had fallen right into the ears of those Beast Spirits!

Flame Dragon was taken aback. He could faintly sense that something was wrong, but in that instant, it did not know where the problem exactly was.

“On the Spirit Lord’s side, I will not be going to seek verification. A warning on account of having known each other for so long. It is best that you do not go ask for affirmation. Not confirming it will be better than having it confirmed.” Throwing those words, Poison Ivy then left.
