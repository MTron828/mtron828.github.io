When Bai Zhu received Gu Ying’s message, his confidence increased greatly, and he immediately assembled an army together with the other city lords and marched toward the Sea Spirit City.

However, there was another scene unfolding in Sea Spirit City.

In the City Lord’s Manor, Zheng Weilong delivered the news that Zheng Ke had just sent to Jun Wu Xie. Qiao Chu and others sat side by side as they read the hand-written letter by Zheng Ke.

“This Bai Zhu really has too many moves, it seems like he does not have any limits! In order to bring Little Xie down, he can even resort to selling his charms!” Qiao Chu looked astonished.

Even though Bai Zhu who was the Lord of White Night City, which was also the number 1 city among the 72 cities, before fighting, he had already sold his charms, and had wanted to lure Zheng Weilong into poisoning Jun Wu Xie. This person had such an innocent face but yet possessed such a treacherous mind.

Zheng Weilong sat quietly by the side. When she got the letter, she felt a little bit surprised. She had already guessed that when the 72 cities became enemies with Sea Spirit City, Zheng Ke would definitely make use of the convenience of her presence in Sea Spirit City. But... she didn’t expect that it would be Bai Zhu who wanted to use her instead.

With regards to Bai Zhu’s identity and status, he could have any sort of women. Instead, he wanted her to be the mistress Lord of White Night City. He really spared no effort.

“Why did you give the letter to me?” Jun Wu Xie asked as she looked at Zheng Weilong. “Given the current situation of Sea Spirit City, you should show that you have abandoned the 72 cities alliance and chose Sea Spirit City. Why?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jun Wu Xie knew that Zheng Weilong was a smart person, but Zheng Weilong had absolutely no understanding of her and Night Regime’s strength. Judging from the current appearance, it would seem that Bai Zhu had the pressing advantage whereas Sea Spirit City appeared to be isolated and helpless.

Except for those cities which were taken over by Jun Wu Xie earlier, the rest of the cities were on Bai Zhu’s side. Moreover, the loyalty of those cities which Jun Wu Xie had taken over were not only questionable, but their strength were among the weakest within the 72 cities, and even if those cities were to dispatched fully, they might not even be able to within the attack from the rest of the 72 cities.

In such a situation, even a fool knew who had the winning advantage, but yet Zheng Weilong still chose to continue her cooperation with Jun Wu Xie.

Zheng Weilong looked at Jun Wu Xie with a very calm face.

“I have already chosen to cooperate with you, my Lord, so I won’t go back on my word and be a turncoat. I won’t bother talking about morality and morals. I, Zheng Weilong, from beginning to the end, want my freedom. Even if I agreed to Bai Zhu’s proposal, I will only move from one cage to another. Currently, Sea Spirit City has not been destroyed, and I am of some use to Bai Zhu, and he might treat me with courtesy. But once Sea Spirit City is destroyed, even if he married me according to his promise, I am but a piece of waste with no spiritual power, what will I amount to in White Night City? I will only be under house arrest to live out the rest of my life. Since I’m in a no-win situation, why would I walk right into a trap?”

Zheng Weilong’s words were very straightforward. She did not pledge her loyalty to Jun Wu Xie, nor did she say anything moving. Everything she mentioned was based on her own vested interests, but in that sense, it was the complete truth.

“You will be glad of the choice you made today.” Jun Wu Xie raised her hand slightly, and turned the letter sent by Zheng Ke into ashes.
