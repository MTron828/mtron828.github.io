Chapter 2651: I’m The City Lord (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

He was the City Lord?

How was it possible!

Wasn’t the Sea Spirit City the land of Yan Wan?

Hardly recovered from the shock, Xu Zu looked at the delicate looking boy who was just casually sitting in front of him, simply couldn’t believe everything that he had just heard.

Yan Wan’s fixation towards the Sea Spirit City was extremely deep. He valued power and authorities more than anything else, if not, he wouldn’t have personally killed so many of his kids in the past. The fact that Yan Hai was lucky enough to have his life spared was all because the aptitude he showed wasn’t that outstanding in the beginning. How was it possible for Yan Wan to let his kid who would turn into a threat of his in the future stay in the Sea Spirit City?

“Are you kidding me?” Xu Zu immediately repudiated Jun Wu Xie’s words. Not to mention that the strength of Jun Wu Xie had already been negated by Yan Wan from the very beginning, there was no way her age would overtake Yan Wan’s age. No matter how talented a person was, how would someone surpassed Yan Wan who was already over one hundred years old at such a young age?

This was totally a joke!

“Kidding? I’m sorry but I never joke with outsiders. If I’m not the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City, why would you think that I have the right to sit here?” With her brows slightly cocking, a domineering gaze suddenly emerged from Jun Wu Xie’s cold clear eyes.

The body of Xu Zu stiffened in that instant. It was definitely not a gaze which an ordinary person would own. If it wasn’t for him to witness it with his own eyes, he too, couldn’t have believed that such a young boy would actually have such a sharp gaze.

With an extremely indecipherable expression on the faces of the other people from the Long Xuan City, the way they looked at Jun Wu Xie became really weird.

Though they hadn’t been paying much attention to the Sea Spirit City, they still knew about the most rudimentary information of the city.

Yan Wan had already moved Yan Hai out of the official residence. He didn’t even allow Yan Hai to stay long in the official residence. They didn’t notice it just now, but after listening to what Jun Wu Xie said, only then they suddenly came to a realization that it was actually abnormal for Jun Wu Xie to appear in this place, and what got them even more astonished was the seat which Jun Wu Xie was now sitting on. Wasn’t it the main seat which only the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City had the right to sit on? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If Yan Wan wasn’t defeated by Jun Wu Xie, how was it possible for Jun Wu Xie to sit on that position?

“You... are the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City?” Xu Zu’s voice suddenly became weaker. If everything Jun Wu Xie said was true, then he would need to reappraise her strength.

A teenage boy who was able to snatch the position of the City Lord from his father’s hand at such a young age was definitely not an ordinary character.

Even though Xu Zu didn’t believe that Jun Wu Xie was able to breakthrough the level of a Gold Spirit and condense spirit inscriptions at such a young age, but if it was true that she was capable of taking down such a cunning opponent like Yan Wan, then the artifice used by Jun Wu Xie to trick people would probably be way more appalling than her strength.

Subconsciously, Xu Zu released an unnoticeable spirit energy, trying to scrutinize the strength of Jun Wu Xie, but such an action had caused Xu Zu to break into cold sweats!

He couldn’t sense how exactly strong Jun Wu Xie was!

Such a case would only happen in one situation, that Jun Wu Xie’s strength had far gone beyond Xu Zu’s strength, resulting him in not being able to detect anything.

Just at the moment when Xu Zu was inwardly feeling terrified, a violent spirit energy suddenly traced onto the probing spirit energy which he released and gushed back into him, smashing on the pulse of Xu Zu in the twinkling. The vigorous hit had caused an acute pain to radiate from Xu Zu’s chest, leading him in spatting out a mouthful of blood!

A pungent smell of blood permeated through the main hall of the city palace within seconds. All the people from the Long Xuan City was so shocked that they stood up subconsciously and stared at Xu Zu who was coughing blood, dumbfounded!
