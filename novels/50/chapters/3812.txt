Chapter 2408: Beat Them to Death (8)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

After being attacked by a group of mutated behemoths, they were so annoyed that they felt as if blood had welled up in their chests but they couldn’t spit it out even if they tried to do so.

It had been five days. They had been staying at the Lower Realm for a total time of five days but up till today, even the shadow of a living human was nowhere to be seen. Forget about destroying the entire Lower Realm, they were just busy dealing with those mutated behemoths during these few days.

“Is there any response from Lady Qingcheng? I am going to die in frustration because of those huge monsters if things still keep going on like this!” How Xie Chang Ming wished that he was able to fight against the huge monsters face to face. It sure must be better than the situation that they were facing now, always worrying whether when were they going to suffer the next sudden attack again. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Lady Qingcheng isn’t in a good mood these days. I think we better not go and provoke her any further.” Wei Ya shook his head. They were elites coming from the Upper Realm. However, they were miserably being played havoc by the huge monsters after they had entered the Lower Realm. Wouldn’t it be embarrassing to the Upper Realm if news like this had gotten to the public?

Wei Ya could faintly tell that all the raids they received for these five days were intentionally aimed towards them, and there was a big possibility that the one who was hiding behind the scene was Jun Wu Xie, who had tricked them into coming to the Lower Realm!

“No wonder, I wondered why that little bitch had such courage to provoke the Upper Realm. It turns out that she has gotten all these things ready in the Lower Realm beforehand. What a crafty person.” Wei Ya sneered while inside him, the hatred towards Jun Wu Xie who he had never seen before increased.

“Crafty? I think it’s better to say that she is as timid as a mouse! Does she really think that she is going to win over the Upper Realm just by using these things? How funny.” Xie Chang Ming let out a curse in a small voice. Though he sounded like he was disdaining her, he was actually thinking of wanting to drag Jun Wu Xie out and eat her alive.

Before they could even get some rest, noises were heard from somewhere in the campsite. Under the sky of midnight, a blue fire blazed towards the campsite. Wherever the blue fire got to, all it left was just a trail of devastation with numbers of the Gold Spirit screaming painfully in the burning blue fire!

“Shit! Here they come again!” With the veins on his forehead popping up, Xie Chang Ming immediately stood up as he cursed under his breath.

Were they not done yet!

“Let’s go and have a look first!” Wei Ya frowned and said.

A group of mutated behemoths had launched an attack. The army of the Upper Realm were once again forced into combat without getting enough rest.

The blue flames were raging in the dark night, illuminating the earth which was first covered with darkness while the sizzling heat waves heated up the ambient air in just a few seconds.

Luo Qingcheng who was resting in her tent noticed the commotion. Her beautiful arched eyebrows formed a deep frown. She walked out of her tent and saw the soldiers from the Upper Realm launching attacks continuously at those large creatures with her face looking a little twisted under the illumination of the blue flames.

Rather than heading to the battlefield, she straight off walked towards the carriage which Jun Wu Yao was imprisoned in it.

The moment the guards who were guarding around the carriage saw Luo Qingcheng walked near them, they quickly straightened their backs. During these five days of tangled warfare, they were the only ones who didn’t need to participate in the battle. Their only task of coming to the Lower Realm was to make sure that Jun Wu Yao couldn’t escape from the carriage.

“Open the window.” Luo Qingcheng’s gloomy voice raised in the dark night.

Of course, those guards did not dare to speak a word. They immediately opened the shut window carefully. The blue light shined into the carriage through the window, lightening a small part inside the carriage, causing a cold but straight figure in it to be seen vaguely.

“You are feeling very proud now, aren’t you?” Looking at Jun Wu Yao who was sitting in the carriage without moving a bit, Luo Qingcheng narrowed her eyes with a blaze glinting inside them.
