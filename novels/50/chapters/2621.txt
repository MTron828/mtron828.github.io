Chapter 2622: The Soul Sacrificing Event (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“What?” Yan Xi slightly widened her eyes, that snivelling soldier reported about the strength of Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

Yan Xi’s face suddenly turned hideous to the extreme. She thought that the one who could bypass the Soul Sacrificing Event and rush to Soul Mountain would be only Jun Wu Yao. True, Jun Wu Yao was very powerful, but his strength was sealed with a strong spell, also with his own power, tens of thousands of enemy soldiers couldn’t possibly force him into retreat, but it was not difficult to temporarily delay the pace of his offensive attack.

But no one expected that with the arrival of Jun Wu Yao, wasn’t just him alone!

From what the soldier said, Yan Xi learned that there was not only a strong and intrepid woman with Jun Wu Yao but she also possessed a number of powerful Wood Spirits!

Wood Spirits attacks were inherently strong and aggressive, and the killing effect would multiply in such a large melee. This situation was not what Yan Xi expected.

“What woman? Where is the woman from?” Yan Xi grabbed and lifted the soldier up in anger, as she stared at him like she wanted to peel and swallow him alive.

“I... I don’t know... the woman is terrifying... The Wood Spirit and the Beast Spirit which she summoned are too strong, we...we are not their opponents at all.” The soldier was already scared witless. He saw Jun Wu Xie pass through the battlefield like a hurricane, reaping through the lives of countless companions. And those Wood Spirits summoned by Jun Wu Xie were one more ferocious and violent than the previous. A huge vine swept through everything and instantly killed nearly a thousand people!

This was definitely a nightmare!

“Trash! You are really a bunch of trash! 30,000 people can’t hold the battle for a while, what do I need you for?” Yan Xi threw the man on the ground and stomped angrily. She looked at the Soul Sacrificing Event which was reaching completion. If Jun Wu Yao and his team could not be stopped at this time, then the Upper Realm’s plan that was deployed in the Soul World for so long, it would be game over for them!

At this moment, Yan Xi’s heart fell to the bottom of the valley. Who would have thought that Jun Wu Yao would actually mount an attack in the Soul World at this time?

If it was a day later...even a half day, their plans would be completed.

“Forget it. Their strength is simply not enough to stop Ye Jue. Eve if you killed him, it does not help the situation.” Just as Yan Xi was flustered, a gentle voice drifted into her ears.

Yan Xi froze for a moment and she turned her head to look. She didn’t realise when Jun Gu had walked out of the main hall as he looked at him very calmly.

“Get up. Don’t let everyone fear the battle. Even if it is a strong enemy, we must not lose the will to fight.” Jun Gu looked at the scared soldier, his heart was a little uncomfortable. The fear on the soldier’s face made him feel very bad, as if in his subconscious, the soldiers under his command should not be so timid.

“Lord Jun Gu... Why did you come out?” Yan Xi looked at Jun Gu with shock. After coming to the Soul World, Jun Gu had never left the main hall. This was what Yan Xi always intended to do, even now. Yan Xi had not intended for Jun Gu to appear.

“The enemy is currently advancing, and you want me to avoid it?” Jun Gu’s brows wrinkled.

“No...not...” Yan Xi was a little surprised at his words.

“They are not the opponents of Ye Jue. To stop Ye Jue from advancing, I have to step up. The matters of the Soul World are handed over to you. I will go meet him.” Jun Gu smiled lightly as he pointed his toes gently, and suddenly flew toward the side of Soul Mountain!
