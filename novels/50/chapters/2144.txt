When she went out, Jun Wu Xie did not forget to alter her appearance. As afterall, when she had come into the city with this face, it had caused quite a stir. Jun Wu Xie was highly averse towards such reactions and in order to not draw anybody’s attention, she pulled out “Jun Xie’s” face and put the mask on before dressing herself up as a male youth. She then stepped out through the door. But on this trip, she brought along “the entire family”.

The little black cat had naturally occupied the position on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulders, while having just been reunited, Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit had most definitely not wanted to be left behind at home to wait, but tagged along behind, leaving only Ye Sha alone to follow hidden within the shadows.

Jun Wu Xie came walking out into the Spirit Jade Palace’s branch and when she was passing the main hall, she bumped right into Xue Er coincidentally. Xue Er looked in surprise at Jun Wu Xie dressed up in male clothing as the masked girl stood silently without a word at Xue Er’s side.

That countenance was not unfamiliar to Xue Er. Wasn’t that the way Jun Wu Xie had altered her looks into when she came to the Spirit Jade Palace for the first time?

“Young Mas..... Miss Jun, where are you going out to?” In that instant, Xue Er really did not know how to address Jun Wu Xie.

[She is rather strange. Miss Jun is as beautiful as a Heavenly goddess, why does she always like to dress herself up in male clothing? Although her disguise as a young youth could also be considered as delicately attractive, but compared to Jun Wu Xie’s real looks, this is as unremarkable as dust.]

“Where are the runes in the city located?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“Ah! That’s where you want to go!” It immediately dawned upon Xue Er. She was just about to open her mouth when she suddenly glanced at the girl beside her before she said: “The way to that place is a little too confusing to direct you to, why not let my Senior bring you there?”

Jun Wu Xie’s gaze then moved to fall upon the girl wearing a mask on her face.

Feeling Jun Wu Xie’s gaze on her, the body of the girl stiffened slightly and she lowered her head down, not daring to meet Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

“We’ve troubled you.” Jun Wu Xie said.

The girl shook her head silently, still not saying a single word but just turned and went walking towards the door, seemingly like she was leading the way for Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie went on to follow her. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xue Er blinked her eyes as she watched the figures of her Senior and Jun Wu Xie leaving one behind the other. Looking at Jun Wu Xie walk out from the Spirit Jade Palace branch, she saw the little black cat resting upon Jun Wu Xie shoulders and also two adorable beasts hopping and leaping as they followed behind. Seeing that, she could not help but burst out with a tinkling laugh before she went on to continue with her tasks in a great mood.

When they came out of the Spirit Jade Palace branch, the masked girl continued to walk ahead of Jun Wu Xie, maintaining a distance away that wasn’t close but close enough to not let Jun Wu Xie lose sight of her. She remained very quiet, not saying a single word the entire way, but stopped slightly to look at Jun Wu Xie when they needed to make a turn. When she saw Jun Wu Xie was still following her, she would then continue on her way forward.

“That fella is a little strange.” The little black cat said wrinkling up its nose, its furry tail swishing behind Jun Wu Xie’s back.

Jun Wu Xie had naturally noticed the masked girl’s strange demeanor but she did not detect any enmity coming from the masked girl. She did not feel that the masked girl disliked her, but it was more like she was fearful of her.

Even after thinking for a long while, Jun Wu Xie still could not recall having seen that disciple in the Spirit Jade Palace before. If they had not encountered each other before, why was there such fear? Jun Wu Xie could not understand it but she did not think too deep into it as she wasn’t a person who liked to stick her nose into other people’s affairs. Everyone had their own way of living their lives and she had no right to interfere.
