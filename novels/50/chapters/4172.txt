Jun Wu Xie stood up and looked at the tall figure of Heaven Fiend’s City Lord.

The whole banquet settled down in that moment as everyone was focused on both figures.

As long as the Heaven Fiend’s City Lord defeated Jun Wu Xie, then what Jun Wu Xie said would be reduced to a joke. Moreover, no one believed that the young man in front of the Heaven Fiend’s City Lord could really defeat him.

How old was Yan Hai?

Even if he possessed abnormal innate talent, he still wouldn’t have reached the level of cultivation, accumulated over a thousand years of Heaven Fiend’s City Lord.

This challenge had not yet begun but everyone was convinced who had won.

Heaven Fiend’s City Lord looked at Jun Wu Xie with contempt flashing in his eyes.

Jun Wu Xie could have established a foothold among the 72 cities with the bargaining chips she held in her hands, but unfortunately she was too eager to become the Overlord of the 72 cities. This enraged everyone present. This time, Jun Wu Xie would be sent to hell. And the previous issue with the Five City Coalition army would disappear.

“Lord Yan, the sword doesn’t discriminate, so please be careful.” Heaven Fiend City Lord said, but he had already decided in his heart that he was going to kill Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie looked on calmly at Heaven Fiend’s City Lord. There was no change in her expression, she did not even have the intention to summon her spiritual power.

Instead, the Heaven Fiend’s City Lord had no intention of giving Jun Wu Xie time to prepare, he condensed his Spiritual Inscriptions and rushed towards her head on!

The strength of the Heaven Fiend City Lord was rather high, although he had not condensed a complete Spiritual Ring, but the number of Spiritual Inscriptions he possessed was very considerable. When the dazzling Spiritual Inscriptions shone under the moonlight, the pressure in the air made the night breeze more frantic!

“The strength of the Heaven Fiend’s City Lord has improved again.” Bai Zhu said to Nangong Yan as he looked at the Spiritual Inscriptions on the Heaven Fiend’s City Lord.

Nangong Yan chuckled. At this moment, he had formed a temporary alliance with Bai Zhu to destroy Jun Wu Xie. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“He’s still a young man, unable to remain calm.”

The two looked at each other and waited for Jun Wu Xie to enter hell in penance for her arrogance.

Everyone held their breath as they watched the Heaven Fiend’s City Lord rush at Jun Wu Xie. Compared with the mighty momentum of Heaven Fiend’s City Lord, Jun Wu Xie was too calm. She was calm to the point even when the Heaven Fiend’s City Lord was right in her face, she still didn’t react.

“Oh, this Lord Yan is so frightened that he doesn’t dare to move huh? It’s no wonder ...” Before the onlookers could finish speaking their taunting words, something earth-shattering had taken place on the other side of the battlefield!

Originally, Heaven Fiend’s City had rushed towards Jun Wu Xie with powerful Spiritual Inscriptions, but he hadn’t even touched the sleeve of Jun Wu Xie and he was suddenly hit by a streak of purple light!

The speed was ultra fast that made all those waiting to watch the good show freeze.

They only saw the figure of Heaven Fiend’s City Lord flying towards the banquet area and slammed heavily onto one of the banquet tables. With a loud bang, the marble table shattered!

Everyone was stunned by the scene in front of them!

They didn’t realize what had happened, wasn’t Heaven Fiend’s City Lord about to hit Jun Wu Xie?

Then when, in a blink of an eye, he was flying by himself?

Subconsciously, the eyes of everyone there were drawn to Jun Wu Xie, but as they looked at her, everyone shuddered.
