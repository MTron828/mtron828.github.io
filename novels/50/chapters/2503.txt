Zi Fei also realized that her emotions were out of control, so she found a topic and covered the past. They had not thought that they would talk about these things and thus felt somewhat helpless.

Right then, outside the barrier of the safe haven, a giant Sea Spirit Beast suddenly came over and was constantly slamming against the barrier with its body, making a dull sound.

The sound echoed within the safe haven. It was loud as the thunder!

ZI Fei’s eyes sharpened instantly. She stood up with a woosh and her figure turned into a ray of light and rushed towards the impacted barrier.

When the Sea Spirit Beast, who was hitting against the barrier, saw Zi Fei, it suddenly stopped, as its huge body continually rolled in the sea, as if trying to send some message to Zi Fei!

“Damn it.” a low curse was uttered by Zi Fei.

She suddenly lifted her longbow, turned around and walked outside.

“What? What is happening?” Qiao Chu and the others, who had been playing with the little cubs, seemed to have realised that there was something wrong. They stood up immediately and walked over to Zi Fei’s side.

The expression in Zi Fei’s eyes sharpened even more, like a sword released from its scabbard, its cold, steel tip gleaming sharply.

“The people from the Upper Realm are here.”

“What!!” The news shocked everyone present.

The people of the Upper Realm are here?

What is the meaning of this?

“We found traces of the Upper Realm people hunting the Sea Spirit Beasts before we came to the island, but... their destination was not anywhere close to this island.” Fan Zhuo’s brows were knitted, before they came onto the island, in order to avoid meeting people from the Upper Realm, they had changed their navigation course, but who knew, they were still going to face to fools!

“The storm last couple of days may have made them change their course. We cannot let them stop over on this island, if not, they will very quickly discover these little Sea Spirit Beasts.” The tone of Zi Fei became very ominous. The cubs of the Sea Spirit Beasts were extremely fragile, and recently, this was the Sea Spirit Beast hunting season for the Upper Realm. Hence, many of them would leave their cubs in the safe haven and go out to hunt for food alone. The Sea Spirit Beast from earlier was probably one of the parents of the little cubs. When it found traces of the Upper Realm, he was eager to tell Zi Fei the news.

The little Sea Spirit Beasts cubs were extremely fragile, but they were the Upper Realms favourite hunting targets. Once they caught the cubs, they won’t immediately kill them. Instead, they would think of a way to bring the cubs back to the Upper Realm to see who can rear the little cubs. If these cubs were domesticated since young, then they would not know any basic survival skills, more so, the Sea Spirit Beasts were unaware of their own ill-fated destinies. And as they grew, the people from the Upper Realm would think of ways to kill them while at the same time preserving their Soul Cores!

The safe haven housed more than a hundred little Sea Spirit Beasts, and once discovered, it would be a disastrous catastrophe!

Zi Fei could not keep still any longer, she told Jun Wu Xie and friends to be careful, and rushed out the safe haven with her longbow.

The little Sea Spirit Beasts within the safe haven seemed to sense the impending danger, they gave up playing and gathered within the adult Sea Spirit Beasts for comfort and protection.

“Well.... What do we do? We can’t just leave Zi Fei to deal with the Upper Realm garbage alone right?” Qiao Chu face was stiff. Their goal was to avoid the Upper Realm people, but these people were knocking on the door. If they wanted to avoid, then the only way was to leave.

Everyone’s gaze fell collectively onto Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
