Chapter 332: “Sixth Slap (4)”

One of the Elder’s face had turned all aghast at the bloody scene before his eyes and he could only watch on in horror. Upon hearing Qin Yue’s shout, he snapped back to his senses and moved to run out from there to call for help.

However, before he could step out through the door of the main hall, a massive black shadow loomed and knocked him back inside!

The massive black beast stood blocking the exit with its body, with its head hung low as it growled. The beast opened its jaws, revealing sharp pointed fangs! The Elder who had almost been knocked unconscious from the blow looked up towards the door. When he saw the black beast, he suddenly lost all strength in his legs.

Blood sprayed within the main hall and the Blue Cloud Peak disciples were falling one after another. Under the assault of the two humongous beasts, the three youths stood untouched in the middle, watching calmly as the the bodies of the fallen started to pile up.

Jun Wu Xie stood in the eye of the storm and observed the deathly pale Qin Yue. She watched him silently and the ice in her eyes intensified.

Qin Yue felt the chill run up through his body when he saw those icily frosty eyes.

He could not for his life remember when he had offended these angels of death. They were obviously still so very young, but their ring spirits had grown so powerful!

Watching them, even the highly skilled Qin Yue did not dare step into the battle.

He had seen their capabilities and he knew in his heart that he was still no match for the three ring spirit beasts killing his disciples! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The fear in Qin Yue rose again, and terror gripped him as he felt the closing approach of death looming over his head.

He could see it in his mind, all his disciples slaughtered, and their blood covered every square inch of the floor in the main hall. Their bodies piled up high, surrounding the only clean white marble visible under the three youths’ feet.

The catastrophic battle before him would not bring a scratch on the trio standing in the middle.

Qin Yue and the Elders were all held in terror, they had always been revered and held in great esteem by all the people throughout the lands. They never would have thought that three mere kids could make them taste this fear, a bitter taste in their mouths.

Haughtiness, dignity, did not matter to them at that moment as they had been shattered to bits. Their usual upturned noses and complacent attitude were gone and they stood trembling, unable to move a muscle, wishing in futility that this was all just a bad dream.

“Who is the one that needs to escape now?” Jun Wu Xie beamed at Qin Yue and the Elders who were huddled closely together.

Only one Elder within the hall was still calmly seated. His eyes met Jun Wu Xie’s and he stood, walking slowly to stand with the three youths.

“What is Mu Chen doing?” Cai Zhuo asked, hiding behind another Elder, as he peeked out to see Mu Chen walking towards Jun Wu Xie.

Qin Yue’s eyes were fixed on Mu Chen back.

“You are better than I thought you were. It is my honour to have worked together with you.” Mu Chen stepped through the pools of blood on the floor and stood before Jun Wu Xie, his face beaming with the first smile that came truly from his heart in more than a decade.

“It isn’t over.” Jun Wu Xie smiled back.

Qin Yue could not take his ears off the conversation Mu Chen and Jun Wu Xie were having. He burned at Mu Chen’s treachery and his face turned red.

“Mu Chen! You are in cahoots with them!? You would destroy the Qing Yun Clan!? How could you? As an Elder of the Qing Yun Clan!!” Mu Chen was the last person he would have expected to turn against the Qing Yun Clan.

Mu Chen’s father had been the previous Sovereign of the Qing Yun Clan and Mu Chen grew up within these Cloudy Peaks. His love and passion for the Qing Yun Clan was way beyond what anyone else here held.
