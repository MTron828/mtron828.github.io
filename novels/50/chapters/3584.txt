Chapter 2179: Bloody Battle at the Summit of Mount Fu Yao (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Ba He, that was the name of the man.

Although Su Jing Yan only heard Ba He’s companion call out his name once, but he already understood that Ba He was the commander of these Gold Spirits. All the Gold Spirits here obeyed Ba He, and the strength of this person made even their Nine Temples Lords extremely afraid of him.

He still remembered the moment when Ba He first brought people to the Nine Temples. The moment the Nine Temple Lords saw Ba He, each of their faces paled one by one and were trying to suppress their fears but they still trembled involuntarily.

This man had the strength to make the Nine Temple Lords fear.

Su Jing Yan’s heart was tight, and his eyes fell on Su Ya on the high platform.

Her whole body was soaked with oil. Under the flushing of the smoldering oil, the blood on her face was lighter, revealing the colour she had. In such a dangerous place, she did not show a little bit of fear of death, only calm. ... abnormal calm... as if she was waiting for the advent of death.

Even though he knows that Su Ya was not Ba He’s opponent, Su Jing Yan still admired the woman silently. She didn’t show any pain or torment on her face despite such torture. It was not that she didn’t feel any pain but she refused to reveal any weaknesses in front of her enemy – her pride did not allow her to.

She was extremely endurant, all just to preserve her dignity!

Su Jing Yan’s breathing became more and more heavy, and his mind continued to show the scene of that the night that he met Jun Wu Xie.

It had been three days, but he had not seen her. Su Jing Yan thought that she would forcibly save Su Ya during the past three days, but she did not appear at all, what was she up to?

From the bottom of his heart, Su Jing Yan hoped that Jun Wu Xie would give up rescuing Su Ya. After all, it was difficult to save Su Ya under the eyes of a thousand Gold Spirits, even if there was the Dark Emperor on her side, it was still an extremely dangerous feat.

Thousands of thoughts swirled in his mind, but Su Jing Yan knew that he couldn’t do anything. He was the elder of the Heavenly Wolf Temple. Even if he was dissatisfied with the cruelty and sinisterness of the Upper Realm, he could not speak a word lest he receives the anger of the Upper Realm. It would spell the doom of the entire Nine Temples!

There was a blanket of unusual silence in the entire square, as the disciples of Nine Temples were suppressed by the might of the black robed men. Even if they see Su Ya’s horrifying appearance and desperate situation, they did not dare to make a single sound. They could only lower their heads as the pungent smell of the oil assaulted their noses as the wind bellowed.

A Nine Temples disciple secretly clenched his fist. He was hiding among the Nine Temples disciples. A pair of burning gaze crossed the crowd and looked at Su Ya on the high platform.

“Don’t be impulsive, we can’t fight them.” The companion standing next to him secretly pulled his wrist.

The man gnashed his teeth, but his eyes revealed helplessness.

He once stood out from the Battle of Deities Grand Meet, and had enrolled into the Cloudy Brook Academy. Although he was not a disciple of Su Ya, but he had met her on several occasions. If it was not an unintentional sentence from Su Ya’s that had guided him, he was afraid that he would not have the opportunity to graduate from the Cloudy Brook Academy and joined the forces of the Heavenly Wolf Temple.

Even though she was a teacher that had helped him greatly, but he could only watch Su Ya suffer under the hands of the Upper Realm. The incompetent condemnation felt like countless ants biting his heart.

Not only him, but among the other disciples of the Nine Temples, there were also a few men who had malevolent eyes. They had to endure hard and restrain themselves.
