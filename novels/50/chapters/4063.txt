It took quite a long time for Xu Zu and the others to recover from the shock after leaving the official residence.

“B-... Boss, the thing that Yan Hai said just now... Is it true? Why do I feel like this is kind of suspicious?” One of them held onto a bewildered expression on his face. The words that Jun Wu Xie said just now were ambiguous. They didn’t even get to make any response before they were “asked” to leave.

With a ghastly expression on his face, Xu Zu frowned, seemingly to be thinking of something.

“Boss, if this is true, what should we do?” The people from the Long Xuan City began to panic. They didn’t expect things will turn out to be like this when they came. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Not providing the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast?

Things like this had never happened before in the past thousands of years.

“In my opinion, that bastard isn’t trustworthy. He has just taken over the position of the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City and he thinks that he is very powerful, but what he doesn’t know, is that the Sea Spirit City is just a nobody among the seventy-two cities! Does he really think that he can just do whatever he wants? Let’s report this to the City Lord when we get back to the city and let the City Lord teach Yan Hai a lesson. Didn’t there’s this old saying, that a man with downy lips is bound to make slips? Under the management of Yan Hai, the Sea Spirit City will come to an end one day,” said a disciple from the Long Xuan City deprecatingly.

“Yeah, once His Lord knows about this matter, he will no longer sit on the position of the City Lord.”

“What the hell do you know about it!” Furious, Xu Zu hooted. Meanwhile, in his mind, he was thinking about everything that Jun Wu Xie had said today.

The Sea Spirit City would send an ample amount of the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast to the seventy-two cities every month. Therefore, even when the provision had been halted for a month, with the reserved stocks they had in every city, there wouldn’t be any problems. Just take the Long Xuan City as an example, the amount of the blood of the Sea Spirit Beast that they stored was enough to sustain for half a year. However, that was the very last shot of their storage. The situation wasn’t that distressed now, but if Jun Wu Xie really decided to completely cut off the provision, there would surely come a day when the storage was all used up.

“His Lord wouldn’t care whether if the Sea Spirit City will provide the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast or not, even the Top Ten Experts don’t really need the Sea Spirit Beast anymore. We, the people from the seventy-two cities, are the ones who need the Sea Spirit Beast. Do you really think that everyone will take the Sea Spirit Beast as some kind of treasures?” Brows furrowed, Xu Zu wasn’t really in a good mood.

“His Lord wouldn’t care about it?” One of the men from the Long Xuan City was stunned.

“His Lord has never touch the matters of the Sea Spirit Beast. These are all managed by the seventy-two cities. His Lord would only care whether if there’s any talented experts in the cities. He doesn’t even bother to meddle in other things.” Xu Zu had been serving beside the City Lord of the Long Xuan City for quite a long time. Though Xu Zu had never seen His Lord before, he had heard quite a lot of rumors regarding His Lord from the City Lord of the Long Xuan City.

The managing system of the Upper Realm was very disorganized. The excessive freedom they owned had often caused a lot of things to be out of control. It seemed to be a really free and easy management, but in reality, there were always huge risks coming along with it no matter where you were, and what position that you were holding on.

“Then-... Then what should we do?” The people from the Long Xuan City began to go weak in their bodies.

“What can we still do? To be honest, it’s all up to the City Lord, but it’s true that Yan Hai the bastard is acting a little too arrogant. We need to blunt his edge and let him learn about the rules of the seventy-two cities.” Xu Zu touched his chest which was still faintly radiating pain.

“Take a look around the Sea Spirit City before we leave. Yan Hai’s decision comes so suddenly, and the matter about him taking over Yan Wan is quite fishy. He might be hiding something,” said Xu Zu with his eyes narrowed.
