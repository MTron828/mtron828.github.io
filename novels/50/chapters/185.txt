Chapter 186: “Crossing Swords ‘Covertly’ (4)”

Mo Qian Yuan was not aware of these secrets of Jun Wu Xie, he only knew Jun Wu Xie’s skill and prowess in Medicine far surpassed any one he had ever seen. His own life was saved by Jun Wu Xie, and he trusted her unconditionally.

“Arrangements can be made for you to be there, but please be careful while you are there. Qin Yu Yan commands respectable spiritual powers, but Jiang Chen Qing’s powers are insanely strong!”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly and a question suddenly came to mind: “The request to treat Mo Xuan Fei was made by Bai Yun Xian?”

Mo Qian Yuan shook his head, “No, I had intended to bring it up during the banquet, to request for their help, as a topic for conversation. Actually..... I think even if I had not asked, Bai Yun Xian would not have passed up on the opportunity. She will not give up without a definitive answer from the Qing Yun Clan. Only when the Qing Yun Clan affirms that they are not be able to rid Mo Xuan Fei of the poison, will she resign to her fate. I know that if I had not asked, Bai Yun Xian would have tried all ways and means to make Qin Yu Yan lend a hand, to decide on which side her loyalty should lie.”

Mo Qian Yuan paused before he continued: “I didn’t think it would have been so easy to enlist their help in the treatment without having to say much.”

Qing Yun Clan’s willingness to lend a hand had come too easy.

Though Mo Qian Yuan had a good impression of Qin Yu Yan, he somehow felt, that it was unusual of Qing Yun Clan to agree just like that.

“Before they agreed to it, I distinctly saw Jiang Chen Qing’s face darken considerably and was afraid he would give vent to his frustration then. Surprisingly, Qin Yu Yan suddenly agreed.”

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes in thought. She was not present, and did not know how it all happened. She had thought that Qing Yun Clan only agreed with Bai Yun Xian’s incessant pleas. The situation at hand was too different from what she expected.

Saying that was because Qing Yun Clan’s prerogative was to save a human life at all costs, would have been laughable.

Countless have died at the hands of the Qing Yun Clan, and they had not saved them. People who are of no value to them, will never get an ounce of sympathy of effort from them.

The Kingdom of Qi and Qing Yun Clan did not share close ties, and Mo Qian Yuan has already ascended to the throne. Hence, Mo Xuan Fei did not have a chance at the throne anymore. The Qing Yun Clan will not waste their time on a downtrodden duke. Moreover, it was due to this duke that a disciple of their own clan had embarrassed and shamed them like this.

Whichever way she looked at it, Qing Yun Clan had no reason to want to lend their expertise.

But, they have done just that.

“Have those palace maids and eunuchs serving the Qing Yun Clan watch them. Inform me of all that they hear.” Jun Wu Xie had to tread carefully. If she was found out, to be carrying out all these actions behind their backs, it will not be just her alone, but the whole of the Lin Palace that will meet their maker.

Before she is strong enough, she will take each step carefully.

“Maybe..... Just maybe, they are being kind? And will leave after staying a few days?” Mo Qian Yuan ventured carefully. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jun Wu Xie shot him a stare. “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.”

Mo Qian Yuan shuddered, and understood the reason for Jun Wu Xie’s caution. “I’ll make sure they watch carefully!”
