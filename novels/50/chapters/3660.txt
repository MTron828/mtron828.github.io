The wind was raging, the heavy scent of blood filled the air and the mountain been flattened in an instant. Such a phenomenon could not be overlooked and it had naturally aroused the attention from the nearby villages. Each and everyone of them scurried to hide and only after a long time when there was no longer without any other abnormalities did they run out one by one.

Standing from a height, one could only see the mountain that once stood tall looked as if it had been cut off from the side as the entire mountain top had disappeared from the sight of people without a trace. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Seeing such a sight had stirred the hearts of the villagers. Many of the villagers were ignorant and thought that they had angered the gods. They all knelt down in fear in front of their village and bowed to the place where the mountain had been levelled.

The steady sound of horseshoes walking on green grass could be heard from the distance as it continued on the meandering path that led to the village. When a youth, whose gaze had a hint of anxiety, suddenly saw that in front of that small village lay a group of villagers who were bowing with reverence at a certain direction with their hands together in prayer, he wrinkled his brows slightly. He raised his hand slightly and the team behind him stopped. A lady with a cold and arrogant temperament at the side looked at him and nodded her head. That youth dismounted his horse and walked straight towards the villagers.

“May I know the reason why you are all bowing here?” That youth asked in a crisp voice.

The villagers who were sincerely worshipping felt impatient being disturbed in the midst of their prayers, however when they raised their heads, they found that it was a handsome young man. For a moment, after been stunned momentarily, all that impatience had dissipated after seeing all those men clad in light armour behind him. With a smile, one of them answered: “Young Master, you should not be from around, right?”

That youth nodded his head.

That villager heaved a sigh of relief before saying, “Young Master does not know, in a village nearby, we don’t know who had done something evil and incurred the wraths of the gods that they had meted out their divine punishment. Fortunately, the gods are merciful and they only gave a small warning without hurting anyone. That is why... we only want to confess our sins here as we pray with our sincere hearts to them.”

That youth slightly arched his eyebrows and felt that the words spoken by that villager were ridiculous.

Gods?

What the hell was this?

He was still a little unclear so he turned his head and looked at that lady that was seated on top of the horse.

Her brows were slightly furrowed, revealing a trace of confusion, she too dismounted her horse and walked over to continue asking, “Warning? What warning?”

When the villagers saw that such a noble lady had arrived, they were all in a daze. That lady did not have a stunning appearance but her imposing manner made people ignore her appearance and did not dare look straight at her.

After being in a daze for some time, that villager finally returned from his stupor and pointed at the distant mountain.

That mountain was considerably tall, although it was not considered majestic but the strange thing was that the top of the mountain looked very odd, it was as if someone had purposely broken it off.

“That mountain does look a bit strange...” That youth narrowed his eyes as he looked at the lady beside him and said: “Qu Ling Yue, say... Doesn’t that mountain look as if it was a remnant after a large battle?”

His words made her slightly shocked.

A remnant after a large battle? Being able to level a mountain, there was only that person who was capable of such a feat!

Where that person was, would also mean where Jun Wu Xie was!

“Hurry, let’s go and have a look!” Her voice was tense as she immediately rushed back to her horse.

“Alright!” That youth did not say anything further as he mounted his horse as well and the group rushed forward without any stop towards that strange mountain.
