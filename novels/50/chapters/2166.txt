Chapter 2167: One Thousand Gold Spirits

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“The Upper Realm is not something that you and I can contend against.” Su Jing Yan shook his head and smiled wryly. “Why are you so persistent?”

The division of the three realms, the Lower Realm, the Middle Realm, the Upper Realms. Just from the first word, the division of powers was apparent. With just the words alone, the powers were visible. The people from the Lower Realm were just like ants to the Middle Realm and in the eyes of the Upper Realm, those from the Middle Realm were just like fish meat.

Among the three realms, the Upper Realm was almost legendary. The Middle Realm may have some connections with the Lower Realm. However, the Upper Realm had already formed at the beginning of the creation of the Three Realms. At that time, there wasn’t any Lower Realm nor Middle Realm. It just comprised of a chaotic mix of barbaric forces where dynasties had yet been established and it was none other than the chaotic savage lands.

In the eyes of many, the Upper Realm was akin to the realm of the gods. Rumours had it that the strongest of the Upper Realm were omnipotent; they could call forth the wind and rain, and could even transform beans into soldiers. What difference was there between them and the Gods?

There were even rumours that the existence of the Lower Realm and the Middle Realm was created on the whim of the leaders of the Upper Realm. The two realms did not exist then. Only because of this novel thought from the Upper Realm did the current realms come into existence.

“Perhaps in the eyes of others, the Nine Temples are already strong enough, but I am not afraid to tell you that in comparison with the Upper Realm, we are even not even comparable to an ant. The strongest Gold Spirits in the Middle Realm are only ordinary in the Upper Realm and just anyone from the Upper Realm is as powerful. I am not an alarmist, I can tell you now that there is a thousand Gold Spirits in Cloudy Brook Academy! Can you even fathom what this means? Even if you have three heads and six arms, you can’t compete with these thousand Gold Spirits!” Su Jing Yan’s voice held a trace of despair, everyone here knows the Nine Temples and Twelve Palaces, but they didn’t know that in the eyes of the Upper Realm, what were they even?

A thousand Gold Spirits!

Jun Wu Xie was shocked!

She had already guessed that it was not easy to go against the Upper Realm, but she did not think that the highest levels in the Middle Realms, the supreme Gold Spirit, once the Upper Realm decided to start, the first strike would be ... a thousand Gold Spirits?

A thousand Gold Spirits! ! !

What a horrific number!

Don’t even mention Jun Wu Xie herself, even if she mobilizes the forces of the Lower Realm, and even if the Twelve Palaces are willing to help, and adding on the Nine Temples , however, even with the might of all three forces, just based on hundreds of thousands of army, that itself was not enough to contend against this thousand Gold Spirits!

“The ones who had tortured my Master and Master Uncle, was it the doing of the Nine Temples?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly asked.

Su Jing Yan was stunned for a moment, and immediately understood that Jun Wu Xie was referring to Su Ya and Tian Ze.

Su Jing Yan shook his head.

“Torture? They don’t even want these two people to be held under us. From catching to imprisonment, they did it all by themselves. Do you think that in their eyes, we are qualified to intervene in their affairs? I’m not afraid of your jokes, in the eyes of the people from the Upper Realm, us Nine Temples are just like their dogs, a dog I tell you, how can I dare to act?”

Su Jing Yan’s words were not fake. Tian Ze thought that it was the doing of the Nine Temples because he saw the disciples of the Nine Temples and had mistakenly thought that those from the Upper Realm were also from the Nine Temples. He did not know that the Nine Temples was only a bystander from the beginning to the end. They did not even have the qualifications to touch their prisoners.

Although Tian Ze was an apprentice of the little old man, there were some things that the little old man did not let his apprentice know too much.

Knowing too much was dangerous for Tian Ze and Su Ya.
