“I’ve told you what I know. Please let me go...” Yan Hai’s face was covered in tears and snot, his head made a little pit in the sand from his vigorous kowtowing.

Unfortunately, no one sympathised with him. After, the Night Regime and Ghost Army had storm on board the Sea Soul City’s vessels and slaughtered everyone, they searched the ships and found a large number of Sea Spirit Beasts carcasses in the cargo holds of the two ships. Most of the bodies were dismembered. The bones and skin were piled up together, while the bottom of the holds were densely packed with jars of wine. However, the jars were not filled with fine wine, but with a large amount of fresh blood; blood belonging to the Sea Spirit Beasts.

The Sea Spirit Beasts’ organs and innards were dug out and placed in other jars. And in the galley of the ships, blood eyeballs were still being boiled in pots.

People had needs, and it was the law of nature to survive. But if it was outside of survival, it was just cruel to use that as an excuse to hunt and expropriate these creatures without restraint.

In nature, even the most ferocious tiger would also know its limits, in order for the prey to thrive moderation is required. But the greed of the Upper Realm knew no bounds.

Even the Night Regime and Ghost Army who were so accustomed to killing, upon seeing the places filled with blood, could not control the anger which rose in their hearts.

“I’ll leave it to you to handle it.” Jun Wu Xie said to Zi Fei.

Zi Fei nodded.

Yan Hai pleaded for mercy incessantly, but before he could finish, Zi Fei swiped at his neck.

Blood sprayed but there was no sadness at this moment. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Looking at Yan Hai in a pool of blood, Jun Wu Xie suddenly bent down and plucked the jade pendant from his bloody waist.

“You like?” Jun Wu Yao quirked his eyebrows, as he didn’t think that thing was any good.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“I thought of a way.”

“What?” Jun Wu Yao looked similingly at Jun Wu Xie, wondering what was going on in her mind.

Jun Wu Xie cleaned the blood off from the jade pendant as her gaze swept over the people surrounding her and said, “Our target is the Upper Realm, but if we were to go directly, we might get discovered by others. But what if we change our identity?”

Jun Wu Xie had just finished speaking and Jun Wu Yao’s eyes lit up.

“What you’re saying is, you want to disguise as Yan Hai and the others?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded, “Why not? The two ships are still in good shape, the relationships between parents and children are not harmonious, and now the people here are all dead, so no one will know exactly what happened here.”

There are two ships on this line of the sea soul city. Now all the members are dead here, and they will not be discovered by anyone. The reason why Jun is not thinking of this method is because of the identity of Yan Hai.

Sea Soul City had these two ships on this particular route, and now that all the crew are dead, no one would discover what happened, Jun Wu Xie was able to come up with this plan because of Yan Hai’s background.

Seventy two cities, Sea Soul City’s young master, although the relationship between parent and child is average in Upper Realm, but with such an identity, it would ease their movements.

The Upper Realm created such chaos in the Lower and Middle Realms, it was time to pay them back!

Jun Wu Yao laughed lightly as he lifted his hand to pat Jun Wu Xie’s head. “This is not a bad plan, except that Night Regime and Ghost Army troops are too large to fit all into these two vessels.”

Jun Wu Xie lifted a brow, “Sea Soul City’s ships are not just these two.”

In that instant, everyone understood what Jun Wu Xie was implying!

She wants to kill all the Sea Soul City ships, and replace them with their own people!
