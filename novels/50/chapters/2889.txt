Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

When the woman saw the elixir in Jun Wu Xie’s hand, her eyes were filled with terror.

“Don’t be afraid, I am not going to hurt you. I know that you are tortured by Elder Luo. If you want to save yourself, trust me.” Jun Wu Xie looked into the woman’s terrified eyes and lowered her voice.

The woman looked at Jun Wu Xie motionlessly, as if struggling. After a long struggle, she nodded slowly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Jun Wu Xie placed the pill into the woman’s mouth, and the woman felt a coolness flowing into her throat, causing an almost-forgotten sensation in her numb throat!

“Save ... Save me!” That was the first sentence the woman said while sobbing.

“Please, help me out! Please, please!” The woman’s tears burst in an instant, and she shivered like catkins in the wind.

“Who are you? Why are you here?” Jun Wu Xie asked, looking at the woman.

The woman cried and said, “I am the family member of Lord Li Wan Ting!”

Jun Wu Xie was a little surprised. The Li Wan Ting that the woman mentioned, Jun Wu Xie had heard of him before. This person was one of the top ten exponents in the Upper Realm and he was ranked first! But how did Li Wan Ting’s family member fall into the clutches of Elder Luo?

Soon, everything the woman said resolved the doubt in Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

Li Wan Ting became famous thousand years ago, and later he became one of the top ten exponents. His reputation was illustrious and he had great prestige in the Upper Realm. This was the ideal man that the Sacred Maiden Tribe was looking for. Thus, 500 years ago, the Sacred Maiden Tribe sent an invitation to Li Wan Ting, requesting that he come to the tribe to choose one of their members to conceive the next generation of Sacred Maide. Naturally, Li Wan Ting did not want to miss out on a good opportunity, and he immediately brought an entourage of attendants to the Holy Mountain to keep that appointment.

This woman was one of the people brought by Li Wan Ting at that time. Her name was Ling’er, and she was a servant girl who had been with Li Wan Ting since she was a child. Because of her beauty, Li Wan Ting kept her by his side, and although she was a servant in name, she was actually one of his mistresses.

However, Ling’er also knew that she had low spiritual strength and in a lowly position. Hence, although she knew Li Wan Ting’s purpose in coming to Holy Mountain, she didn’t dare to disagree.

At the Holy Mountain, Li Wan Ting and a member of the Sacred Maiden Tribe caught each other’s eyes, and they were married. During the period of time before that woman got pregnant, Li Wan Ting lived on the Holy Mountain for a long while, along with the others who came with him.

Ling’er didn’t have any intentions at that time, she just wanted to serve Li Wan Ting in a peaceful manner, in order for her future days to be well.

But she didn’t expect that on the night the woman got pregnant, she was ordered to serve the woman. However, she suddenly felt disoriented and fainted. When she woke up again, she was chained to the wall in the igloo.

For five hundred years, she did not struggle to break out of her bondage, she was trapped in that igloo, and became the test subject for Elder Luo’s potions. Occasionally, there would be people cultivating in the Sacred Land, and in order to distract other people’s attention, Elder Luo muted her with poison for five hundred years.

Over the past five hundred years, Elder Luo has used various kinds of poisons from time to time on Ling’er. Ling’er often thought that she would die, but she survived, and it was better to bear such a life than the torture of death....

“The women of the Sacred Maiden Tribe are all evil spirits! When I was locked up here on the first day, I saw with my own eyes Elder Luo throwing the woman, who had been trapped and tortured to death here, into the ice cellar at the back of her house. ” Ling’er started sobbing.
