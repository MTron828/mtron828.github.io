Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“You!” Elder Luo was blocked by Han Zi Fei’s presumptuous words, but she knew very well that Han Zi Fei had always been lawless.

Han Zi Fei was also not interested in talking with Elder Luo, and looked directly at Jun Wu Xie: “If you have any questions, just ask.”

Jun Wu Xie got up and walked to Elder Luo.

Jun Wu Xie did not understand why “Lord Yan” had colluded with Han Zi Fei.

“Lord Yan, what do you mean?” Elder Luo chuckled coldly.

Jun Wu Xie looked at her blankly.

“I invited you over today to ask you something, and I hope Elder Luo can cooperate.”

“Oh? That’s how Lord Yan invites people? I have now seen it.” Elder Luo was a little flustered in her heart, but the expression on her face was still tough.

“Nothing, just want to ask you, what is that youth worm you give to the maidens?” Jun Wu Xie said straightforwardly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Elder Luo’s face changed sharply, her eyes subconsciously glanced aside, and her voice became a little unnatural.

“What youth worm? I don’t know what you’re talking about!”

“Little Wu Xie, can’t just leave this person to me? Interrogating such a person, I think I have more experience.” Suddenly her father said out in front of her. He had a lot of experience fighting with his father and interrogating prisoners of war and spies during the war.

“No need to bother my father.” Jun Wu Xie shook her head and reached out from the Cosmos Sack around her waist to take out an elixir.

Elder Luo had not yet understood why Jun Gu called this “Lord Yan” Little Wu Xie, nor did she know why Jun Wu Xie called Jun Gu “Father” from her mouth.

There was no room for resistance. Elder Luo swallowed the elixir stiffly. It didn’t take long for a strange feeling to form in her body. Her complexion turned from white to red, and her sharp eyes turned confused. The spirit of alertness seemed to relax at this moment. Her whole person looked a little lazy and blushing, as if drunk.

“Little Wu Xie, what did you use on her?” Looking at Elder Luo who was formerly aggressive and turned drunk, Han Zi Fei couldn’t help but look at Jun Wu Xie curiously.

“An elixir for making illusions.” Jun Wu Xie said. Elder Luo wanted to use the orchid flower on her. It was only polite that she returned this “kind” gesture back to her so that she would not be considered rude.

This elixir was refined by Jun Wu Xie when she was free. It is a modified product of the last orchid flower. It could not only let people relax their vigilance, but also let them unknowingly reveal the secrets that they never want to tell!

However, this elixir had a weak effect on those with strong spiritual power. It was most suitable for people with strong mental power and weak spiritual power like Elder Luo!

Thanks to the elixir, Elder Luo had put down all vigilance. Now Jun Wu Xie could ask her questions to get all the answers she wanted.

And the answer to this question surprised Jun Wu Xie, and it made the other four people in the room have a new understanding of the Upper Realm and His Lord!
