Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

She could not have Jun Gu. On the other hand if she treasures Lord Yan’s admiration towards her, she may not be inferior compared to Han Zi Fei in the future!

Yan Xi’s eyes were ignited with ambition. She looked at Jun Wu Xie as if looking at a big tree that could help her step on Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu under her feet.

“Since the Lord Gu has granted her, then this matter ...” Duan Qi no longer wanted to bother about this. The only good news is.... Although Yan Xi was not the most suitable person, she is a member of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. If Jun Wu Xie has Yan Xi, the remaining baby girls in the future can still remain in the Sacred Maiden Tribe, and they are very likely to become maidens.

“Thank you Lord Jun Gu.” Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and thanked him.

Jun Gu cleared his throat and pretended to look at Jun Wu Xie coldly: “Even though this is the case, it still depends on Yan Xi’s will.”

“Oh, Lord Yan is so outstanding. Who in the world would dislike you?” Han Zi Fei sneered.

His girl must be the best in the world. Chop up anyone who dislikes her.

Jun Gu pretended to helplessly glanced at Han Zi Fei.

Yes, yes, our best girl!

But on the surface, he still pretended to be just and fair to Yan Xi: “Yan Xi, what do you think about this?”

Yan Xi looked at the man whom she had been obsessed with for years and looked at Han Zi Fei standing next to him, and looked at Jun Wu Xie standing in front of herself. That last trace of love was covered up by her ambition. She pretended coquettishly and said: “What will Yan Xi have? It is thanks to my Lord and Lord Yan that I can be favored by Lord Yan. I am already fortunate enough, I dare not ask for more.”

This was her answer.

“That’s good.” Jun Gu nodded. This was enough to act along with Han Zi Fei’s tricks.

At this moment, Jun Gu approved. Yan Xi was willing. And the whole matter naturally came to an end. Even if Duan Qi was reluctant, she could only stay with her smile.

After all, she did not want to offend either Jun Gu or Jun Wu Xie.

Throughout the banquet, the most desperate person was Han Shu. She watched her last chance slip away from her fingertips. Looking at Yan Xi who had snatched everything from her, with a smile on her face, and her hatred almost drowned her.

“Lord Yan, since my Lord has granted you, I will be yours in the future. But I have unfinished work with my Lord, please give me a few days grace.” Yan Xi’s heart had both joy and sadness. She did not forget the key, her eyes slipped over the copper ball around Jun Gu’s waist, her eyes darkened slightly.

Previously, His Lord asked her to follow beside Jun Gu to control his consciousness with rhino horns. Now that Jun Gu got married and Yan Xi had already obtained the will of His Lord to hand over this law. Han Zi Fei, it would be more convenient for her to control Jun Gu in the future.

Yan Xi was not willing to do this before. Now she was very fortunate. In this way, she could have more opportunities, instead of watching Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu showing off their affection.

“Good.” Of course, Jun Wu Xie had no other words.

Yan Xi nodded cleverly, covering the half of her scratched face, and retreated gracefully.

Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei exchanged a look, and also found a reason to leave. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Seeing that things had come to an end, Elder Yun retreated the other maidens from the hall, leaving herself, Duan Qi and Jun Wu Xie.
