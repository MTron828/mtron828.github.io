Meng Qiu sat down on the ground, lost and hopeless, he did not notice the gaze of Qin Song.

Long Jiu was still bawling, until he almost could not breathe, the sound made people collapse. Crystal Orchid glanced at Corpse Flower, lifted his foot and kicked Corpse Flower’s buttocks.

Corpse Flower, whose mouth was sealed shut, smashed into the front of Long Jiu, he could not break his fall in time, and slammed into Long Jiu’s face. At the same time, Crystal Orchid immediately dispelled the frozen seal on Corpse’s Flower’s mouth.

“Wu wu... vomit!!!” Long Jiu’s face was smothered by Corpse Flower’s “poison gas”, the taste instantly made Long Jiu forget about his wailing as he fell down to one side and retched.

Corpse Flower quickly covered his mouth as his other hand pointed accusingly at the Crystal Orchid, indicating that he was framed!

However, Long Jiu, who had been fumigated till he nearly cried, didn’t have any energy left to bother about it.

“Take off their chains.” Jun Wu Xie raised her hand, and she threw the long whip, which she took from the black armored Spirit Envoy, to Poison Ivy, who caught it. He gave a couple of flourishes of the whip and broke the chains binding Long Jiu and Qin Song.

Long Jiu, who regained his freedom, had no time to rejoice, as the smell of Corpse Flower caused his tears to continue flowing down madly.

Qin Song rushed to the front of Meng Qiu, who was sitting on the ground, and dragged him upright in one move. Qin Song directed a fierce punch onto Meng Qiu’s face.

Meng Qiu, who had been adversely affected by the Contemporaneous Knot, and whose power was already rapidly deteriorating, and thus he was hurt by Qin Song’s punch. He fell straight to the ground, and he was embarrassed. Meng Qiu didn’t say anything, he just stared at the ground, no one knew what he was thinking about.

“Why?” Qin Song glared at Meng Qiu, the anger in his chest was burning bright.

He would never forget that when he sneaked into the area of the Spirit Tree and saw that image of Meng Qiu’s betrayal. He could never forgive Meng Qiu’s betrayal!

Meng Qiu used to be the mentor of Long Jiu and him, and was also the most admired Spirit Envoy. Once upon a time, he and Long Jiu’s goal was to become a powerful Spirit Envoy like Meng Qiu and guard the Spirit Tree. However Meng Qiu’s betrayal shattered that trust in the both of them.

The betrayal of a Spirit Envoy was not enough to make Qin Song so angry, only Meng Qiu was different.

“Why did you betray the Spirit Tree! What benefits did the Upper Realm give you? That you could do such a thing!” This was the first time Qin Song flew into a rage. The mentor who was once supreme in his heart became the lackey of the Upper Realm. How could he accept that?

Meng Qiu propped up his upper body and slowly turned his head to look at the angry Qin Song. He turned his gaze towards Long Jiu, and his gaze finally fell on the vine that belonged to the Spirit Tree, which was held suspended in the air for a long while.

Suddenly, Meng Qiu laughed, his laughter turned from small to large, full of complex emotions.

“You both are really good brothers. What you said, Long Jiu has also asked me, the exact same question.” Meng Qiu looked at Qin Song, the apprentice he once admired.

As the first Spirit Envoy of the Soul World, Meng Qiu had taught many Spirit Envoys. The innate talents of Spirit Envoys were similar to human beings. There was good and bad. Qin Song was the one with excellent qualifications, his heart was calm and he was keen. Meng Qiu spared no effort to help cultivate Qin Song.

As Meng Qiu had said, he looked down on Long Jiu, but he appreciated Qin Song very much. Because Qin Song has a good relationship with Long Jiu and always brought him along, Meng Qiu eventually acquiesced to Long Jiu learning beside Qin Song.
