Chapter 321: “Sheep turned Predator (5)”

Not just the Cloud Treading Peak disciples, even the disciples of the Qing Yun Clan’s Outer House would be spared. Those disciples did not really belong to the Qing Yun Clan and there was no need to hurt the innocent.

“Fan emotions?” Mu Chen was puzzled.

Jun Wu Xie explained: “During this period, Ke Cang Ju had prominently flaunted the authority that Qin Yue had given him and offended all the other Elders of the Qing Yun Clan completely. Qin Yue had shielded Ke Cang Ju’s actions tightly and the other Elders are feeling very edgy. If the son of the last Sovereign stood forward at this moment, I believe the other Elders would jump at the chance to rally behind you to drive the Qing Yun Clan in chaos. By that time, Qin Yue’s time in the Qin Yun Clan would be up.”

“How are you going to do it?” Mu Chen grew more and more shocked the more he heard. He realised that the turmoil that had been brewing within the Qing Yun Clan had been stirred up by these three youths singlehandedly. And if he was not wrong, the one making the decisions among the trio, should be Jun Xie, the youngest one among them!

He was able to pull off a plot on such a big scale at such a young age. Mu Chen could not imagine what kind of environment Jun Xie had grown up in.

And he wondered how mighty the Jun Family was that they dared take on the topmost clan across the lands, the Qing Yun Clan!

“You wouldn’t understand even if I told you.” Jun Wu Xie waved her hand tiredly. She really wasn’t too good at explaining things in detail.

Seeing that Jun Xie was refusing to say more, Mu Chen stopped himself from probing anymore.

“After the Qing Yun Clan is obliterated, it would cease to exist. If you do not have any pressing business or anywhere else to go, you can go to the Lin Palce in the Kingdom of Qi.” Jun Wu Xie gave it a thought, and decided to provide Mu Chen with a good alternative after everything. She believed that Mu Chen would have no intention to stay on in the Qing Yun Clan, that had turned rotten to the core under Qin Yue’s hands.

Mu Chen might still be young, but he possessed respectable skills and knowledge in the nurturing and development of veins and arteries. And no matter how highly skilled Jun Wu Xie was in Medicine, she could not split herself. To sufficiently sustain the medical needs of the hundred thousand strong Rui Lin Army, needed more than the strength of a lone Jun Wu Xie.

If she could enlist the help of Mu Chen and his disciples, the Rui Lin Army will rise up faster!

Jun Wu Xie did not only plan to just make herself stronger, but to strengthen every single person in the Rui Lin Army as well. Only when the Jun Family held more chips within their hands, can she ensure her grandfather and uncle to live a life of leisure without any worries.

Mu Chen stared at Jun Wu Xie and he remained silent for a moment. “If you help me to kill Qin Yue, I will bring my people to the Lin Palace and reside there for three years. Within those three years, I will exhaust all that I hold in repayment for what I will owe you.”

Jun Xie had killed Ke Cang Ju, and if he were to kill Qin Yue as well, Mu Chen vengeance would be exacted. He did not want to owe Jun Xie that debt of gratitude and had decided he would repay him with his skills in medicine.

“That is a deal.” Jun Wu Xie nodded, in satisfaction, not minding the fact that Mu Chen saw through her underlying intentions.

Intelligent people knew what they should do without having to prod them.

The discussion on their secret cooperation was finished, but Mu Chen was hesitant to leave just like that. He turned to Jun Wu Xie and said: “The news that I came storming into the Hidden Cloud Peak must have spread to the ears of the other Elders. I cannot walk out of here just like that.”

Jun Wu Xie produced an elixir within her hands and threw it to Mu Chen.

“Swallow it.”

Mu Chen swallowed the elixir without hesitation and stepped out to bring his unconscious disciple back.

“What did you give him?” Qiao Chu stared after Mu Chen as he left, his curiosity highly piqued as he bugged Jun Wu Xie.

“Mu Chen and Ke Cang Ju were opposing enemies for a long time. Ke Cang Ju would not allow Mu Chen to bring his disciple back so easily. Hence..... he would have to pay a certain price.” Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes. They needed to put on an act, and a complete act is required. Mu Chen would be a good ally, and he was smarter than Mo Qian Yuan.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
