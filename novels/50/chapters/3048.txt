As they got further from Sacred City, Jun Wu Xie had noticed that the path they were taking was in the completely opposite direction of the 72 Cities. This road was sparsely populated and there were some dense forests earlier on. After that, there were mostly rugged mountain roads and valleys all over the gravel. There was no other single person around, not even the shadow of a bird.

If it wasn’t Chi Yan leading the way, Jun Wu Xie would find it hard to imagine that in the Upper Realm, there existed such a desolate place. Even Jun Wu Yao had never been here before. At first, Jun Wu Yao only appeared nearby and found this place. There was nowhere else to go further, so he didn’t proceed on.

On the last day of the first month after departure, Jun Wu Xie’s carriage was parked under a towering mountain, which was extremely high and steep, even the trained horses could not move forward on such a steep mountain.

Chi Yan made everyone get off the carriage and prepare for it. They talked about walking up the tall mountain.

Jun Wu Xie stood at the foot of the mountain and looked up at the towering peaks. In the Upper Realm, there had always been a rumor that the Holy Mountain where the Sacred Maiden Tribe lived was the highest peak in the Upper Realm. But the Holy Mountain seemed so small compared to this big mountain. Such a behemoth was taller than any high mountain that Jun Wu Xie had seen in her previous life. At a glance, she could not see the peaks hidden in the clouds, as if they were in them. What was displayed in front of her was just the tip of the iceberg.

At the command of Chi Yan, the crowd got out of the carriage and stood at the foot of the mountain looking at the high mountain before them. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Chi Yan, this mountain ...” Su Ruiying also froze when she saw the high mountain. Obviously, before today, she didn’t even know of its existence here.

Such a high mountain seemed to have been forgotten by all the people in the Upper Realm. To reach it, one had to pass through the wilderness, crossed the mountains and it was hidden in the clouds. Standing at the foot of the mountain, everyone seemed so insignificant.

Chi Yan looked up at the mountain and finally opened his mouth. This was the first time he had spoken with the crowd since he set off.

The moment when the cold voice sounded, it also revealed the purpose of their trip.

“This mountain is the destination we are about to climb, and what the Lord is looking for is on the top of this mountain.”

“His Lord ... what exactly is he looking for? This mountain, haven’t you heard of it before?” Su Ruiying didn’t understand at all. She asked herself deeply about His Lord’s trust in her. Although she was not as important as Chi Yan, she should also know about this. Just that about everything about this mountain, she heard it for the first time. But looking at Chi Yan’s expression, he seemed to have known it for a long time.

Su Ruiying’s inquiry happened to be what Jun Wu Xie thought. She looked at Chi Yan with her eyes fixed, waiting for Chi Yan’s reply.

SInce they have arrived here, Chi Yan did not seem to have any plans to hide it. He said straightforwardly: “At the beginning of the Three Realms, there were gods, the gods created the Upper Realms, and created the rules of the world. But I don’t know since when, those gods that created everything suddenly disappeared, and the miracles they left behind faded away a little bit. This time His Lord let us come to find the temple where the gods lived and find out the reason why the gods disappeared, and what they have left behind. ”
