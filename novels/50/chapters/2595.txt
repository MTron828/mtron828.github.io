Jun Wu Xie was shocked by the picture in front of her, but her body walked uncontrollably toward the two children.

The two children were very small, they looked like they were at the age of just learning to walk, two pairs of different coloured eyes looked at her with undisguised curiosity.

“Who are you?” The child with the golden eyes looked at her with a squint and asked in a soft voice that was a little nervous.

The other child with the purple eyes kept quiet, and stared at her with a guarded look.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t know what exactly was this strange scenario, she couldn’t control any of her own actions; she bent down and held the two children in her arms. Within the chaos of the haze, the two children’s appearances became clearer.

Although they were still young children, but the two children were very good-looking, just like the porcelain dolls that were carved with jade, unable to take one’s eyes off them.

“Who are you?” the golden eyed child asked again.

Jun Wu Xie’s mouth opened involuntarily, as she slowly said a word that made her feel strange.

“Li Ya.”

The two children looked at her confusedly, but she did not open her mouth again. Her voice sounded with the usual the coldness, but it also revealed a hint of gentleness.

“From today, I will teach you to create this world.”

The moment she spoke, the eyes of the child, who had been silent, lit up in an instant... Those eyes held a trace of familiarity to Jun Wu Xie...

However, the picture abruptly stopped.

The chaos of the mist disappeared. Jun Wu Xie didn’t realise when, but she was standing by a meandering stream. In the stream, a beautiful boy was bathed in sunlight. The golden eyes held a bright smile, and the boy turned around and saw Jun Wu Xie, the smile on his face suddenly widened. He raised his hand, water droplets dripped from his fingertips, refracting the radiant light in the sunshine.

“Sister Li Ya! Look! Water! I created the water!” The golden eyed young boy spoke with unabashed joy.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t know what expression she held as she just stood calmly by the stream.

What was the splendid sun shining high, but suddenly there were clouds covering the sky!

The sun was swallowed up by the clouds, a shadow fell upon the land.

Jun Wu Xie raised her head, but within the dark clouds she saw a teenager, floating in the air with his hands spread out. There seemed to be thunder and lightning flashing from his hands, which is related to the dark clouds in the sky.

The juvenile’s appearance was beautiful with a devilish charm, his face held some inexperience and frivolity; as that pair of purple eyes stared unblinkingly at Jun Wu Xie. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Li Ya, this is thunder.” The voice of the purple eyed boy was impudent and egotistical. Jun Wu Xie didn’t know why but she felt such a familiarity to the boy.

Distractedly, the youth and her maintained eye contact for a while and without understanding why, it felt so unfamiliar.....

The chaos split sky and earth apart, the mountains and rivers...were born in succession. Transcending the passage of time, the images in front of Jun Wu Xie continued to flash, and finally it paused at a moonlit night. She stood under the moonlight, as a touch of warmth appeared from behind her.

“Li Ya, can you stay with me forever?” The low-pitched, soothing voice suddenly came from behind her, and her hand hanging from the side of her body was suddenly held!

Jun Wu Xie turned and met the eyes of the other person, but in an instant, Jun Wu Xie’s heart was shattered.
