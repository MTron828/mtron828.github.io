Chapter 2611: Premeditation (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

What did Jun Wu Yao mean by those words?

“Lord Ye Jue, what do you mean? What’s...” Long Jiu stared at Jun Wu Yao, not daring to think deeply about the meaning of Jun Wu Yao’s words.

Even Qin Song couldn’t help his eyes from widening.

There wasn’t any astonishment found on the face of the Spirit Tree. While looking calmly at Jun Wu Yao, it suddenly spoke, “You’ve guessed it.”

Long Jiu and Qin Song were completely dumbfounded at the moment.

The Spirit Tree didn’t even deny Jun Wu Yao’s statement. Instead, it responded with...”You’ve guessed it”?

What had he guessed?

Did this mean that it was the Spirit Tree who had planned for its seed to be taken away by Jun Wu Yao at that time? Had the Spirit Tree earlier known that Meng Qiu would betray the Soul World?!!

Long Jiu and Qin Song were astounded by their own thoughts!

They didn’t even want to think more about it.

Jun Wu Yao simply just shrugged his shoulders, “Before this, I was just a little doubtful about it, but after Blood Velvet told me that the area covered by the Contemporaneous Knot was wide, I was then sure about it.”

During that year, Jun Wu Yao didn’t really have much interest in the seed. It was the Spirit Tree who had told him a lot of interesting information on the contrary, causing him to seize with an idea of stealing the seed. There wasn’t any difficulties faced when he took the seed away. Although the Spirit Tree did send its people to search for him, but the fact that no news was heard after that had caused Jun Wu Yao to feel a little weird.

After all, the seed that was taken by him was the seed that the Spirit Tree prepared to make it as its heir. Wasn’t it too easy for him to just simply take the seed away?

At first, Jun Wu Yao thought that it was after Meng Qiu had gotten in touch with the Upper Realm that he had decided to persecute the Spirit Tree all of a sudden, but the existence of the Contemporaneous Knot was far before the past thousand years. It was obvious that the time when the Spirit Tree was cast with the Contemporaneous Knot was much earlier than the time when Meng Qiu began to be in contact with the Upper Realm.

Hence, by inference, the fact that Jun Wu Yao was able to take the seed away so smoothly, this might probably be the premeditation of the Spirit Tree.

“You knew that Meng Qiu had the thoughts of treachery but because you had no idea what was he actually planning to do, and so you handed me the seed and let me take it out of the Soul World?” Looking at the Spirit Tree, although the gaze of Jun Wu Yao was slightly sharp, there was no rage in his eyes.

The Spirit Tree let out a soft sigh. While facing Jun Wu Yao’s query, it didn’t make any refutation about it except for one.

“I’d been aware of Meng Qiu’s things before that. However, this isn’t the reason of me letting you take away the seed. In fact, it’s the other two reasons, which one of it was because of the Upper Realm, and for the other one...” The Spirit Tree didn’t finish its words but with a trace of bizarreness in its eyes, its gaze fell onto Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie stunned a little. What the Spirit Tree was trying to say... was that she was the second reason of it letting Jun Wu Yao to take the seed?

“Qin Song, Long Jiu.” The voice of the Spirit Tree suddenly changed.

Long Jiu and Qin Song, who had earlier been flabbergasted by the truth to the point that their souls left their bodies, were still being in a state of confusion uptil now. Even after they were called by the Spirit Tree, they were still feeling a little dizzy.

“Please leave first,” the Spirit Tree requested. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The following topic wasn’t something that they were allowed to listen to.

Though Long Jiu and Qin Song appeared to be a little dazed, they wouldn’t hesitate to follow the orders given by the Spirit Tree. Obediently, they left the Spirit Tree and guarded at the outer side spontaneously, preventing the other spirit envoys from getting near to the Spirit Tree.

They could vaguely notice that the things that the Spirit Tree was going to talk about after this might probably be something really important.

After Long Jiu and Qin Song left the place, only then the Spirit Tree raised its eyes and looked in the direction of Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.
