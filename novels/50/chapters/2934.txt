Jun Wu Xie found Jun Gu’s residence quickly after following the instructions mentioned in Jun Gu’s message. It was heavily guarded, but for her and Jun Wu Yao, it was as simple as entering a deserted area. In no time at all, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao entered the house.

Being a Knight of Destruction, Jun Gu’s residence in the Sacred City was very spacious.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao saw the figures of their parents in the courtyard.

“Father, mother.” When Jun Wu Xie saw her parents, her expression softened greatly.

Han Zi Fei, who had been living in Sacred City for a while, dropped all nobility when she saw Jun Wu Xie and stretched her arms out to embrace her daughter.

Jun Gu looked on with a smile and shook his head, his eyes met Jun Wu Yao’s, with whom he had a tacit understanding and both their eyes were filled with affection for their respective wives.

“You’re finally here. If you were delayed any longer, I’m afraid your mother would go in person to see you.” Jun Gu sighed helplessly. Jun Wu Xie’s status in the Upper Realm meant that she was noticed wherever she went. As soon as Jun Wu Xie entered the Sacred City, Jun Gu had already received the news. If it weren’t for being afraid that it would attract too much attention, Han Zi Fei would have already gone to Jun Wu Xie.

Han Zi Fei glanced at the man of the house, “Our daughter has gone through so much suffering, if you as a father are not heartbroken, I am.”

“...” Jun Gu was taken aback and did not know whether to laugh or cry. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“How can I not be heartbroken? Alright, let them sit and rest. The way you are hugging her might scare her away.” Jun Gu said.

Han Zi Fei still had the pained expression on her face, but was really just feeling heartbroken for Jun Wu Xie and pulled Jun Wu Xie to sit down in the gazebo.

“We asked you to come, firstly because your mother misses you and secondly, due to the Top Ten Experts selection.” Jun Gu said seriously as Han Zi Fei stopped her complaining.

“It seems that there are quite a few differences between this Top Ten Experts selection and previous ones. Do you know something about that?” Jun Wu Xie guessed.

Jun Gu nodded, “It seems you have noticed, because I entered the Upper Realm relatively late, I have not experienced any selections. For this selection, His Lord has already made some moves, he let Long Yao be the examiner of the selection, this alone is highly suspicious. Long Yao is very cruel and unforgiving. He’s the second person to become a Knight of Destruction and has great pride, even sometimes looking down on me. He is thinking of becoming the highest position below His Lord, and he often has disagreements with the other two Knights of Destruction. This time, the Lord did not call you directly but asked you to participate in this selection and it is really disturbing me. ”

Jun Gu’s brows were lightly furrowed. He was indifferent to matters of the Upper Realm but this time, it was relating to his own daughter. He did not know why but he felt that the selection was specially designed by His Lord’s to deal with Jun Wu Xie.

After all, there was no need for someone with the power of Jun Wu XIe to participate in this competition, for no one there would be a match for Jun Wu Xie.
