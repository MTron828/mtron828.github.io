Chapter 2130: Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“To sacrifice the Three Realms in blood, you cannot do away with the Blood Sacrificial Array and the sacrificial medium.” The Spirit Lord said.

“What is a sacrificial medium?” Jun Wu Xie did not really comprehend the term.

The Spirit Lord then replied: “I do not know in detail, but just the general gist of it. They will require a spirit soul not from this world, and with the unique qualities of the otherworldly soul, they will then be able to open up a channel for the sacrifice.”

[Otherworldly soul?]

When Jun Wu Xie heard those words, her heart trembled slightly. On the surface, those two words possibly meant a soul that did not belong to this world, and Jun Wu Xie herself had been a foreign soul that had been warped here, which also meant she was not of this world.

Caught up in her shock, Jun Wu Xie did not notice the cold glint that flashed in the eyes of Jun Wu Yao seated right beside her.

“Talk about otherworldly souls has been around from a very long time ago, but as to what it is exactly, I do not know clearly, and am not aware whether they have found it. But now that they have started on building the Sacrificial Array, I would assume that they have already found their target.” The Spirit Lord went on to explain further with a sigh.

“If their plan is allowed to succeed, then it was be calamitous for the Three Realms, as all living beings in the Three Realms will then be wiped out.” The Spirit Lord said, suddenly raising his head up to look at Jun Wu Yao.

“Dark Emperor, I know that you are indifferent and have never liked to be constrained. But this matter concerns the entire Middle Realm and I beg for the Dark Emperor to help us! Save the Three Realms from its disastrous fate!” As he spoke, the Spirit Lord stood up and knelt.

But before his knees could even land, Jun Wu Yao stuck one of his long legs out and lifted the Spirit Lord’s feet right off the ground.

“There is no need for that. Even if it’s not for the Three Realms, I will not allow their plan to succeed.” Jun Wu Yao said, his eyes flashing with a cold sneer.

The Spirit Lord was taken aback and he froze for a good while before he recovered and said: “The Dark Emperor already knew of this matter before?” He had not seen Jun Wu Yao show the slightest sign of surprise or shock all this while.

“Mm.” Jun Wu Yao answered half heartedly.

“We will have to trouble the Dark Emperor. If there is anything that the Spirit World is able to do to help, the Spirit World will spare no effort!” The Spirit Lord then said in delighted surprise. Jun Wu Yao’s might made him dare to hold more hope towards the entire matter.

Afterall, the one that would be able to stand against the Upper Realm, would not be an ordinary person.

Jun Wu Yao waved his hand dismissively, not really caring for the Spirit Lord’s generous gratitude.

Instead, it was Jun Wu Xie who suddenly said: “I want to go back.”

“Hm?” Jun Wu Yao raised up an eyebrow slightly.

Jun Wu Xie turned her head to look at Jun Wu Yao, her eyes with determination written all over them

“Since the Upper Realm is intending to set up the Sacrificial Array in the Middle Realm, then I must go find all the totems and destroy them.” Jun Wu Xie had a feeling that the Twelve Palaces would definitely have such rune totems among them! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, if you say we go back, then we’ll go back. As per your wish.” Jun Wu Yao said with a highly indulgent smile.

“What are you talking about? Go back?” The Spirit Lord was a little confused as he listened at the side.

Jun Wu Xie then said: “My flesh body is not dead, and I am not a dead spirit, but a living soul.”

The Spirit Lord’s eyes widened, his eyes utterly incredulous.

Since time immemorial, only one person had been able to come walking into the Spirit World as a living person, only Jun Wu Yao! Even if you beat him to death, he would never have imagined that Jun Wu Xie had actually also..... But as he turned to see Jun Wu Yao’s doting and indulgent eyes as they looked at Jun Wu Xie, the Spirit Lord was immediately dumbstruck.

Unless he was blind, or he would not be able to miss the tender lovingness Jun Wu Yao was showering upon Jun Wu Xie.

But.....

The Dark Emperor had actually fallen in love with another person?

Just the thought of it was already so unbelievable. If he had not seen it with his own eyes, the Spirit Lord would never have believed such a thing at all.

“Cough..... The Dark Emperor is indeed all powerful.” The Spirit Lord was highly tactful, but even thinking with just his big toe, he already knew who had brought Jun Wu Xie in here.
