Chapter 2377: Thrilling moment (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

When Hua Yao saw that Qiao Chu was so distraught that he could not even speak, he could only force himself to calm down. “When Little Xie came back, she was still fine but her soul suddenly became extremely weak. We have sent people to look for the Spirit Lord. However, as for the reason behind it, we aren’t exactly sure. After she came back, she did not touch anything unusual and did not eat anything.”

Nothing unusual? She did not eat anything as we?

But the weakness came so suddenly, he never expected such a thing to happen.

The face of Qin Song was extremely ugly. He could only continuously transfer his soul power to Jun Wu Xie, trying to prevent her soul from dissipating. Long Jiu who was at the side finally snapped out of his stupor and he quickly strode forward and did the same thing as Qin Song.

However, even with the two of them, they were still unable to match the speed of the soul power that was flowing out of Jun Wu Xie.

Situ Heng stood by the side and looked at all the anxious people in the room. At the bottom of his eyes, there was an undetectable glint of disdain.

He had waited for two months and finally the day that he had waited so long for had arrived.

The Soul Devourer had already penetrated deep into Jun Wu Xie’s soul. Having used her soul as a nourishment for two months, even if Qin Song and Long Jiu used all their powers, it was absolutely impossible to reverse the situation. Once traces of the Soul Devourer were revealed, even a Great God would not be able to rescue her!

Situ Heng was ecstatic and was immensely pleased with the results, but his face did not have the slightest change in expression.

Not enough...

It still wasn’t enough.. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

How could he be satisfied with just this little achievement? How could Jun Wu Xie’s death satisfy his ambitions?

A sudden rush of footsteps resounded and a flustered Spirit Lord walked into the room under the watchful eyes of everyone. The moment he just received the news from Qiao Chu, he rushed over without stopping and when he saw the frail and weak Jun Wu Xie lying on the bed, he was completely stunned in place.

“How can Miss Jun be so weak?” The Spirit Lord widened his eyes incredulously.

Hua Yao could only repeat his explanation, not daring to leave anything out. They could only hope that the Spirit Lord had a way to save her.

Even those who did not understand much about matters pertaining to the soul knew that if things carried on this way, they were afraid that..they would not be able to keep Jun Wu Xie’s soul!

“It’s impossible... everything had been very smooth, how could she suddenly become like this... It doesn’t make any sense...” The Spirit Lord furrowed deeply and looked very troubled.

The few generals of the Rui Lin Army who were standing in the room were so anxious that they were close to tears. All they could do now was to look at the Spirit Lord with hope. “Spirit Lord, please help our Young Miss! Our Young Miss... she can’t have another accident!”

The Spirit Lord was flabbergasted.

At this moment, a cold voice suddenly sounded out.

“Spirit Lord, this thing started because of you. I think that you should give us a proper account.” Situ Heng who had been silent all this while suddenly spoke out at this moment. And at this moment, he had attracted the gaze of everyone present.

“What do you mean? What do you mean when you said that this was started by the Spirit Lord?” One of the generals of the Rui Lin Army caught the implied meaning in Situ Heng’s words.

Situ Heng sneered and looked directly at the ashen faced Spirit Lord and said: “What do I mean? You shouldn’t ask me, but ask the Spirit Lord instead. Your Young Miss’ soul was in chaos and this time, she came specially to the Spirit World to resolve it. The Spirit Lord had proposed a method that had never been used before and wanted to try it to resolve the condition of your Young Miss. But from the look of things now, it seems that this method seems to be counterproductive.”
