Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Looking fearlessly at Jun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Yao just let her check his pulse.

Jun Wu Xie’s mind was enshrouded in doubts. After checking over and over again, she found no problem from his pulse. Jun Wu Xie’s pulse was very stable, there seemed to be no sign of him being injured.

“Do you feel relieved now?” Jun Wu Yao patted Jun Wu Xie on her tiny little head.

“Yeah,” respond Jun Wu Xie flatly.

“It’s quite late now, I have asked Ye Mei and the others to prepare breakfast, don’t you want to have some?” Jun Wu Yao suggested.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“I’m going to the Lin Palace.”

“Do you want me to go with you?”

“No, I have something to talk to grandfather.” Jun Wu Xie wasn’t going to let Jun Wu Yao accompany her.

Jun Wu Yao could only let her be.

Jun Wu Xie removed the Spirit Rings and freed Ye Sha and the rest of them. Except for restricting their movements just now, she did not let the Spirit Rings hurt them.

After getting their freedom back, Ye Sha and the others immediately stood aside obediently with their thoughts full of questions.

They had clearly seen the condition of Lord Jue just now, how was he alright now after just a few moments later?

Although their minds were filled with questions, they were not that dumb to ask their questions in front of Jun Wu Xie.

“I’ll go back first.” Once again, Jun Wu Xie took a look at Jun Wu Yao.

With a smile, Jun Wu Yao nodded his head at her.

Jun Wu Xie then turned her back and left with the black cat.

Until the moment Jun Wu Xie had completely left his sight, the smile on Jun Wu Yao face disappeared instantly.

“Lord Jue, what’s going on?” Ye Mei looked at Jun Wu Yao who seemed to be in good condition with a surprised expression on his face.

With his eyebrows frowning deeply, Jun Wu Yao pressed his lips together. The healthy complexion that was hanging on his face just now was nowhere to be seen. Without speaking, he waved his hand and turned back into his room quietly to have some rest.

He had been repressing the strong pain forcefully using his dark spirit. Who would have known that he was enduring the piercing pain whenever he did a single movement? Whereas, the expression on his face was a deliberate disguise which he put on with his dark spirit, and even the pulse was a result of his guise.

Even though he couldn’t bear the pain brought by the life and death worm, he must still endure it!

He would definitely not let Jun Wu Xie worry about him. For the past five years, he had been owing her too much...

...

Jun Wu Xie left the Ghost City together with the black cat. Once the Ghost Army who was at both sides saw her, they would bow politely to her. The dressing of the Ghost Army was similar to the dressing of the Night Regime. It was just that every single person of them was wearing a specially made mask on their faces, never exposing their faces to the public.

The black cat was sitting on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder. After they met Jun Wu Yao, Jun Wu Xie had not been speaking anything. She looked the same as usual but the black cat that was extremely close with Jun Wu Xie noticed faintly that there was something weird with Jun Wu Xie.

The black couldn’t tell specifically about what was going on but Jun Wu Xie seemed to be a bit out of sorts.

“Where are we going?” The black cat raised its head and found out that the route they were taking now wasn’t the way to the Lin Palace.

It was more like... the way to the past palace of the Qi Kingdom.

“To the prison,” answered Jun Wu Xie slowly. At the moment, her calm eyes were covered with a layer of bitingly cold ice.

“Why are we going to the prison?” The black cat was confused.

“I want to meet Luo Qingcheng.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her pair of eyes, a trace of killing intent flashed across her eyes.

“What do you mean?” The black cat slightly stunned.

“Wu Yao have disguised his pulse with his dark spirit, there must be something wrong with him.”

Either it was during her previous incarnation or the life she was living through now, she had been a doctor for two lifespans. The number of pulses that she had been diagnosing was far more than thousand times, how would she not be able to distinguish that there was something wrong with Jun Wu Yao’s pulse!Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
