Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Yao had on his usual smile as he looked down at Bai Mo who was crying, and as a smile with other intentions flashed by his eyes.

There were more and more people watching. The gazes of the people were really stinging. Jun Wu Xie was still thinking about how to solve the matter before them when Jun Wu Yao suddenly raised his hand and picked up Bai Mo who was clinging on his leg.

The seemingly light movements contained irresistible hegemony. Although Bai Mo did not wish to be pushed away, he found that he was like a child in the hands of this man. He did not have the slightest ability to resist and he was lifted up like a little chick by Jun Wu Yao.

Only a moment later, Bai Mo stopped crying. He stared at Jun Wu Yao and discovered his sinister smiling eyes looking back at him.

“Since you know you are in the wrong, I’ll spare you. Now, come back with father.” Jun Wu Yao’s voice was intoxicating. His voice passed into Bai Mo’s ears and made him feel agitated. Staring in horror.

This voice!

This voice!

The moment Bai Mo wanted to speak, he found that his voice was blocked by a tyrannical force. No matter how he screamed, he couldn’t make a sound.

Under great fear, he could only be helplessly held in Jun Wu Yao’s hands.

Jun Wu Yao said to Jun Wu Xie: “Go back first.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. For a while, she didn’t understand what Jun Wu Yao wanted to do. She followed him into the restaurant.

When walking into the restaurant, everyone gave a curious look at Jun Wu Yao. What made them curious was Bai Mo who Jun Wu Yao held in his hands. But everyone just glanced casually and pretended he was not there. They had just heard it clearly that the child had called Jun Wu Yao “father”.

It seems that the disobedient child was misbehaving. They did not care much at all.

No one noticed the extreme fear that filled Bai Mo having that Jun Wu Yao was holding him in his hands!

Jun Wu Yao easily placed Bai Mo in the room. Jun Wu Xie walked behind. When he was about to close the door after entering the room, he heard some movements. Qiao Chu popped up from the opposite room, and he looked curiously. When he saw Bai Mo in Jun Wu Yao’s hand, his expression was obviously dull for a moment.

“This child ...” Qiao Chu stared blankly.

Where did this child come from?

Jun Wu Yao chuckled and said, “My son.”

With a bang, Qiao Chu’s jaw smashed to the ground. His incredible eyes moved back and forth between Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

Damn!

He already knew that Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were a pair of evildoers. Their brains and strengths were very comparable, but he didn’t expect that ... They even had a baby at such an amazing speed. To have such a big son? !!

Qiao Chu’s expression changed.

This world had turned into a fantasy ... was this all an illusion? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Before waiting for Qiao Chu to calm down, Jun Wu Xie had calmly closed the door. Jun Wu Yao raised his hand and threw the “son” of his to the ground.

When his butt fell to the ground, Bai Mo almost bounced. He stood trembling with his feet, his pair of small hands pointing at Jun Wu Yao constantly.

“You ... you ... you ... it’s you !!!” Bai Mo stuttered.
