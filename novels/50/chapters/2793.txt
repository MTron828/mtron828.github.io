On the same day, Jun Wu Xie released Nangong Lie after her victory in the Middle Realm. She wanted Nangong Lie to convey the important message to the Upper Realm so that Luo Qingcheng would bring Ye Jue to the Lower Realm, to the extent of even using the soul bone as a bait.

Of course, when Luo Qingcheng took two strong men and an army along to the Lower Realm to fight, he also took the Ye Jue with her.

But till now, Luo Qingcheng did not return nor did she convey any more news. Everyone knew that she was afraid and she had already lost. There was always a detail that was ignored by Nangong Lie, and that was the whereabouts of Ye Jue!

The purpose of Jun Wu Xie’s words that day was clearly about Ye Jue. Luo Qingcheng was defeated which meant that Ye Jue was freed.

Nangong Lie looked at Jun Wu Yao’s face from the side and his blood suddenly rushed fervently.

The powerful army around Jun Wu Xie, wasn’t that the Night Regime that the Ye Jue had established in the Middle Realm?

So ... this mighty man made him completely imperceptible, maybe ...

When Nangong Lie’s mind shook, Jun Wu Yao felt his sight as if turning his head, and looked at Nangong Lie with a smile.

This glance made Nangong Lie’s legs weaken.

The army of the 72 cities faded like the tide, leaving only the sores on the ground and the pungent blood smell. Jun Wu Xie looked at the army coldly, and slowly retracted the dual spirit rings. Turning around, the locked gate of the Sea Spirit City opened at the same time, just like welcoming the return of the victory ...

Inside the City Lord’s manor, Dongfang Ku Bi was restless. Zheng Weilong frowned as Jun Wu Xie just left, leaving them clueless to what she was thinking.

“I can’t waste any more time. I’ll go get the army to prepare.” Dongfang Ku Bi couldn’t sit still and immediately got up and left.

Ah Da appeared at the entrance of the hall at this moment.

When Zheng Weilong saw Ah Da, he stood up and said, “What’s going on outside?”

She had no spiritual power and could not participate in the battle. In order to ensure her safety, Jun Wu Xie only allowed her to stay in the City Lord’s manor. Zheng Weilong sent Ah Da to check the movement outside the Sea Spirit City.

Ah Da’s face was a little pale. Standing in front of Zheng Weilong for a while, she said nothing as if she just got provoked .

Ah Da’s response made Dongfang Ku Bi more nervous, and an ominous premonition lingered in his mind.

“What’s going on?” Zheng Weilong couldn’t help urging.

Dongfang Ku Bi no longer wanted to wait.

“Forget it, I’ll see for myself!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“No need to go.” Ah Da said suddenly.

His words gave a slight pause to the footsteps of Dongfang Ku Bi, and Zheng Weilong’s eyes appeared to be in doubt.

“No need to go? What does this mean? Could it be ... Could it be ... He’s already ...” Dongfang Ku Bi asked with a shaking voice.

Ah Da took a deep breath and looked up suddenly.

“What ?!” Dongfang Ku Bi’s eyes widened incredibly.

“Retreat? Why did they retreat?” Zheng Weilong looked surprised.

Ah Da stared down: ” Lord Yan has defeated them.”

“Lord Yan?” Dongfang Ku Bi and Zheng Weilong both looked blank.

Ah Da said solemnly: “Lord Yan fought against an army of the 72 cities all by himself. His one move has killed tens of thousands of enemies. The army in 72 cities was frightened and has now fled.. ”
