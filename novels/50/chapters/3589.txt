Chapter 2184: Bloody Battle at the Summit of Mount Fu Yao (8)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Ba He’s words stirred the surrounding Nine Temples disciples and they were trembling with rage as they clenched with fists tightly.

Ba He did not care about revealing the truth about the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms at all. The number of people that had been dispatched by the upper Realm was enough to wipe out everyone at Mount Fu Yao. If the disciples of the Nine Temples dare to resist, he will make an order to kill them together along with the rest!

Therefore, all the elders did not dare to move, nor could they move. They themselves did not fear life and death, but they could not bring the entire Nine Temples along into this futile destruction.

Ba He’s outrageousness made the little old man’s face uglier and uglier to behold.

“Heaven and earth are not benevolent, thinking that everyone else is a dog. The Upper Realms really think that everything in this world can be disposed based on your own whims! I am afraid, you still do not have such a qualification!”

Ba He sneered: “Do not have such a qualification? The winner is crowned King and the defeated plundered. Since you will die today, why bother wasting so much saliva!” Ba He raised his hand and gestured to the surrounding black robed man to tighten their encirclement around the little old man!

A thousand Gold Spirits!

What a terrible force! Su Ya who stood on the high platform shuddered. Although the scorching hot sun was blazing down on her, but she felt that it was more like a hail storm instead. She was no longer able to speak and could only make indistinct noises anxiously at the little old man, but it was all in vain. The incessant ‘ ah’ that she uttered seemed to be urging the little old man to leave.

She was now an arrow at the end of its flight, even if she was saved, she wouldn’t have much time left. She did not want her Master to put himself in danger all because of her!

The voice of Su Ya echoed in the silent square, and her voice made the eyes of the little old man extremely deep.

The little old man no longer looked at Ba He, but looked at the anxious Su Ya with a very gentle look.

“Little Ya’er, be good and wait for Master. Master will take you home soon.” The smile on the face of the little old man was warm like a father’s.

Su Ya’s eyes were wet in an instant.

She did’nt want!

She did not want her Master to be caught up in a bloody battle because of her! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Su Ya was raging within, but no one could know the despair in her heart.

A thousand Gold Spirits, tightened the encirclement step by step. The golden spirit energy that shrouded those black robed men was extremely dazzling, it was as if the blazing sun was resonating and pulsating with it.

Like a huge golden circle of fire, they narrowed the encirclement a little bit, as their menacing eyes locked onto the little old man’s body.

“Seeing that your old pile of bones is so pitiful, and you still need to go against this thousand Gold Spirits, do be careful. Don’t break any bones, it would even be too tragic a sight.” Ba He stood on the high platform and looked at him arrogantly from high above.

“Don’t kill him, just ruin him enough and leave a last breath.”

This sentence was cruelty that made one tremble!

As soon as Ba He finished speaking, a Gold Spirit who was very close to the little old man immediately dashed forward and turned into a streak of golden light and rushed towards the little old man!

Everyone’s heart almost rushed up into their throats!

The Nine Temples disciples widened their eyes and were extremely worried for the little old man. In their hearts, they did not want Ba He to win!

“Hmph! Overestimating yourself!” The little old man scoffed and before the golden streak of light could even come close to him, it was suddenly hit by an invisible force and it was sent flying!

A huge gush of blood immediately rushed out of the throat of the black robed man who was sent flying and before he knew it, he slumped heavily onto the ground!

At this moment, a strong hurricane rose from the feet of the little old man! The wind was whistling fiercely, and outside the little old man’s body, formed a barrier that shredded everything!
