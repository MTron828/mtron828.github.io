Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Heavenly Wolf Temple’s disciple immediately paused in his steps and turned around, to stand respectfully in place.

“You are a disciple of the Heavenly Wolf Temple?” The man raised up an eyebrow slightly, his face filled with an easy smile, his gaze falling upon upon the wolf emblem on the other party’s chest. Those clothes were the standard uniform of the Heavenly Wolf Temple and the clothes on the man’s body had the same wolf emblem, but his were more luxurious compared to those on the youth, and it could be seen with just one look that his position in the Heavenly Wolf Temple was not ordinary.

“Yes.” The youth nodded and replied.

The man stared with measuring gaze at the youth, and it seemed thoughts of teasing the kid had risen up in his mind.

“Since you’re a disciple of the Heavenly Wolf Temple, why did you not greet me when you saw me? Could you have forgotten your manners?”

The youth’s shoulders stiffened and it looked like he had suffered a shock as he said hurriedly: “Your disciple wouldn’t dare. Your disciple greets Elder Su! It was too dark just now and your disciple was in a hurry and failed to notice Elder Su. I beg for Elder Su to not take offence.”

The voice of that youth was clear, and was a little frantic, a little anxious, not sounding like he was pretending.

Su Jing Yan’s brows lifted up slightly, completely not expecting the other party to really be able to recognize him and his position. He had initially thought that the disciple looked highly unfamiliar and was suspicious of the other party’s identity, never expecting that the kid would be able to immediately know that he was the Heavenly Wolf Temple’s Elder Su the moment he opened his mouth.

[Could he have thought too much about it?]

Su Jing Yan’s brows creased up slightly, as his sliver of suspicion towards the youth faded away with the call of “Elder Su”.

“Where are you going to from here?” Su Jing Yan asked without showing any change in his expression.

“Your disciple has just gone to the toilet and lost my patrol mates. I am rushing to go join them..... and that is why I was a little anxious. I beg for Elder Su to forgive me.” The youth was still trembling, like he was feeling rather frightened.

Su Jing Yan was silent for a while and really could not find anything strange. For this mission, the Heavenly Wolf Temple had sent a whole contingent of one thousand five hundred men. With such a great number, even he would not be able to recognize them all. But as he had felt that the youth’s actions had been rather peculiar, he had stopped and questioned the kid, though he had gotten nothing out of him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Maybe he had just been overthinking it. Mount Fu Yao was now under heavy guard and it was all in preparation of setting up an inescapable web for a particular person, and how could any regular person be able to sneak in here undetected? Moreover, although one might be able to alter their looks but they would not be able to hide their age. The youth was petite in size and his limbs thin and slender, not a single sign of old age on his skin. There was also that clear and puerile voice, which was not something that person would be able to imitate even if he wanted to.

Thinking about that, Su Jing Yan then waved his hand dismissively, and said disinterestedly: “Go.”

The youth quickly nodded and was his face filled up with delight as he turned around to leave.

Su Jing Yan watched the youth’s small back and could not help but feel how funny his jumpy suspicions seemed now. He then turned around as well and went walking towards his intended destination.

But.....

He had not even taken five steps when an icy cold dagger was suddenly held horizontally across his throat.

“Do not make a single sound or I cannot guarantee that I will not slit your throat.” A low raspy voice of a man suddenly sounded from behind Su Jing Yan’s back. That man had come in so suddenly that Su Jing Yan had not even had the chance to defend himself. His arms were twisted behind his back by the man and he could not move, as a drop of cold sweat slid down Su Jing Yan’s forehead without a sound.

[He had been too careless!]
