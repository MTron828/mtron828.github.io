The woman bent down and picked up a small little Sea Spirit Beast. The big eyes of the little Sea Spirit Beast moved between Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao. The woman put her hand on its forehead, a smile then went across the bottom of her eyes.

“The kid likes you.” Raising her eyes, the woman looked at Jun Wu Xie and said.

Jun Wu Xie wasn’t surprised at the case at all. After all, there was nothing she could do.

Due to her plant Spirit Rings, basically those herbivorous beasts would always favour her.

However, what surprised Jun Wu Xie was that, when the woman covered her hand on the forehead of the little Sea Spirit Beast, she seemed to be able to perceive the thoughts of the little Sea Spirit Beast. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You can feel its thought?” Jun Wu Xie looked at her curiously.

The woman slightly nodded.

“The strong psychic force is the special ability of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. As the blood of a sacred maiden gets purer, the force she holds will also become stronger, as for me... I should be able to fully communicate with them using my psyche. The year when Ye Jue was caught, the Upper Realm was in a gory chaos and even the coastline was affected. The Sea Spirit Beasts told me about the news after they witnessed it... I think His Lord has already started his plan, why are you still thinking of going back?” The woman let out a soft sigh.

“Avoiding the problem is never the way to solve it,” replied Jun Wu Yao.

The woman forced a smile with her gaze once again falling onto Jun Wu Xie. “You seem to be much more different from the past when I met you. I still do not know who this lady is...”

“She’s my wife.” The moment Jun Wu Yao spoke his words, he couldn’t help himself from slightly puffing his chest out with an appearance of pride.

The fondness in his eyes was able to make all the women in the world to envy Jun Wu Xie.

“This is really... shocking.” With her eyes slightly widened, the impression given to her by Jun Wu Yao in the previous time was obviously not the type of man who would get married.

More specifically, the Ye Jue during that year was just like a monster, appearing in the Upper Realm, causing a panic for a period of time.

Jun Wu Yao didn’t really care about it.

Meanwhile, Jun Wu Xie had already stretched her hand out and patted on the little Sea Spirit Beast in the woman’s arms. No matter when, she had no resistance towards such lovely creatures.

“Is the Sacred Maiden Tribe the only people to be able to communicate spiritually with them?” The eyes of Jun Wu Xie were gleaming brightly.

The woman seemed to notice the expectancy of Jun Wu Xie. The fact that the nature of such cool-looking little lady was just like a kid was really interesting to her. With a small laugh, she said. “This isn’t an absolute thing. There are people whose psychic force are originally stronger than the others. If one makes the effort to cultivate, one might be able to achieve such level. The speciality of the Sacred Maiden Tribe is just that they are born with extremely strong psychic force. They aren’t unique, but just born with some advantages.”

It sounded simple from what the woman had just said, but Jun Wu Yao knew it very well that the strength of the psychic force of simply one ordinary person from the Sacred Maiden Tribe was far beyond the expert who was capable of condensing spirit inscriptions.

Compared to the spirit energy and the soul power, the strength of the psychic force seemed to be a little weaker, but if it was elevated to a particular level, intangible murder would just become something that could be done with just a stretch of hand.

There was no need to fight as the attack formed by the psychic force was already enough to silently kill the opponent.

But since Jun Wu Xie was so curious about it, it wasn’t really appropriate for Jun Wu Yao to spoil the mood of his little wife since it was rare for Jun Wu Xie to gain interest in something. As her husband, of course he would fully support her.

The woman caught the gleaming passion that flashed across Jun Wu Xie’s eyes, making her pounding heart to suddenly skip a beat.

“If you want to learn it, I can teach you.”
