In the city palace of the Sea Spirit City, Zi Fei who was wearing a mask was sitting beside the pond in the backyard while watching the little Sea Spirit Beasts swimming happily in the pond with a soft and tender gaze in her eyes.

After receiving Jun Wu Xie’s message, Zi Fei and the members of the Night Regime had gone to the Sea Spirit City by ships, and after she arrived, she found out how scarily had the entire Sea Spirit City changed.

Zi Fei was once a part of the Upper Realm, and she wasn’t that unfamiliar to the Sea Spirit City. That year when she was being chased after by the Upper Realm, the Sea Spirit City was the last place where she had escaped to. She could still remember that the Sea Spirit City during that time was pervaded with disgusting smell of blood and there were people who had the blood stains of the Sea Spirit Beasts on their clothing walking on the streets and alleys like it was nothing.

This place was just like a purgatory, cruel and ruthless.

But now, the Sea Spirit City was completely different.

It hadn’t been a month yet since Zi Fei came to the Sea Spirit City, but she was already able to notice the change of this city. The members of the Night Regime and the Ghost Army were successively transferred to the Sea Spirit City, replacing the original residents of the Sea Spirit City, and now, the people who were seen walking in the entire Sea Spirit City were all disguised by the Night Regime and the Ghost Army.

Without everyone realizing, the entire Sea Spirit City had already been completely taken over by Jun Wu Xie! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Senior Zi Fei.” Qiao Chu walked into the yard in a hurry pace. While looking at Zi Fei who was playing with the little Sea Spirit Beasts beside the pool, he grinned and said.

Zi Fei turned her head. Looking at Qiao Chu, she slightly nodded.

“How are these little things doing these days? Seems like they are fully recovered. Maybe they can return to the Sea of Death not long after this?” With his neck stretched, Qiao Chu took a glimpse at the pond. Before this, Jun Wu Xie had invited Zi Fei to the city mainly to save and heal those Sea Spirit Beasts that were being bred in captivity.

During the whole month, all Zi Fei did was healing those Sea Spirit Beasts. Those Sea Spirit Beasts that were once perennially caged while constantly supplying their blood to the Sea Spirit City had almost recovered after being taken care of by Zi Fei. It was just that the wounds on the Sea Spirit Beasts which were caused by the bamboo pipes were too severe that they were yet to fully heal up. If they let the Sea Spirit Beasts get back to the Sea of Death right away, it might probably cause their wounds to deteriorate, and thus, all they could only do was just to let the Sea Spirit Beasts stay in the Sea Spirit City momentarily, so that they were able to recuperate from the damage.

What was even more knotty was those little Sea Spirit Beasts that had been caught since young. They had been locked up in the Sea Spirit City when they were still innocent, not knowing anything about the world but just looking at their comrades suffered. They had no parents to guide and look after them. They didn’t even know the swimming direction to head to the Sea of Death.

At first, Qiao Chu and the others tried to release those little Sea Spirit Beasts that had been rescued, back to the Sea of Death, but the outcome had gotten them appalled. The moment those little Sea Spirit Beasts that had long left the ocean returned to the Sea of Death, they immediately let out a blood curdling and confusing scream, wandering at the seacoast, not willing to leave.

Without having any other options, Qiao Chu and the rest of them could just only bring those little things back and let Zi Fei teach them bit by bit, about the basic knowledge that should be known by a Sea Spirit Beast.

“It’s almost time. Just wait for a few days more and we can then send them back to the isolated island. There, the adult Sea Spirit Beasts will teach them more things.” Zi Fei chuckled. She wholeheartedly liked these little lives coming from the Sea of Death.

“That’s good.” Qiao Chu scratched his head. He too, liked the little Sea Spirit Beasts, but he was born to be a clumsy person who didn’t know how to hold himself back, that everytime when he carried the little Sea Spirit Beasts in his arms, those small little creatures would become so scared that they just screamed the hell out of their lungs. And now, all he could do was just to quietly watch them from aside.
