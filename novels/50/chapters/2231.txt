Jun Wu Yao’s lips curled up as he slightly raised his chin and looked at Luo Qingcheng, and a storm brewed in his eyes. That smile held a trace of disdain, with no intention to even respond.

The moment Luo Qingcheng spoke, Ren Huang had immediately kept Jun Wu Xie behind him protectively.

Jun Wu Xie who stood behind Ren Huang found that his entire back had been soaked in cold sweat.

“Grandmaster, who is she?” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes, this person’s aura and demeanour was completely different from those black robed men. Seeing the way they treated her with respect and reverence, it was obvious that her status was not low, and it could be seen that it was even a few levels higher than that of Ba He.

“Luo Qingcheng, the Glacial Holy Daughter – Luo Qingcheng.” Ren Huang’s voice was stiff, never had he imagined that he would meet Luo Qingcheng here.

“Little Wu Xie, listen carefully. Later, as soon as you have the chance, run for it, don’t look back no matter what happens. You are not allowed to look back.” Ren Huang’s voice was filled with never heard before tension and sombreness.

“Is she very strong?”

“Strong, naturally strong. Her talent is extremely high, coupled with the ambitions of the young, moreover she inherited the bloodline of the Holy Daughter. Her spirit power is purer than mine, her cultivation speed is faster and not to mention... That person with the double Spirit Ring had always treated her well. Luo Qingcheng is that person’s disciple that he had personally taught, her strength is extraordinary and she is the youngest amongst the top ten experts in the Upper Realm. Her rank was several above mine when I was still in the Upper Realm. At that time, my strength was weaker by a bit, but if it’s now....” Ren Huang did not continue to say, even if Luo Qingcheng had yet to strike out, he could already feel that her strength had long surpassed his by large margin. After all, he had left the Upper Realm for a few thousand years and had lost the chance to stay at the best place for cultivation. However, Luo Qingcheng had been cultivating in the Upper Realm for thousands of years. Her current strength had increased so much that Ren Huang could no longer be held in comparison.

Luo Qingcheng’s Master was the number one person in the Upper Realm, he could also be said to be the number one in the entire three realms. She was an extremely talented individual, in addition to her special bloodline, her cultivation was like a tiger that had grown wings. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

It could be said that Luo Qingcheng’s strength and status was only second to none.

It’s just that...

Why was it her?

Ren Huang no longer had the heart to think too much, now that the Upper Realm had sent down one of the top ten experts. He couldn’t help but lament in his heart... if only it was someone else... For it to be Luo Qingcheng... It seems that the Upper Realm had lost their patience and had hardened their hearts. It’s just that... For Luo Qingcheng to appear here, was he the reason or was it Jun Wu Yao?

For the moment, Ren Huang was unable to ascertain, however faced with such a precarious situation at hand, it could be said that the current situation was the worst possible situation. No matter who Luo Qingcheng’s target was, she was really lucky, both he and Jun Wu Yao were at the same place!

No wonder Jun Wu Yao had said those words, he should have already discovered the opponent’s identity then.

Faced with Jun Wu Yao’s indifference, on Luo Qingcheng’s cold and arrogant face, there was finally a crack in her expression. With a slight tremble, she pursed her lips and looked at that proud man in front of her. This man had never placed her in his eyes.

“Ye Jue, today I am representing my Master and catching you back to the Upper Realm. Based on our former relationship and past sentiments, if you would quietly surrender, I will treat you well, I will not let you suffer along the way nor suffer any grievances. Shall we?” Luo Qingcheng suppressed the longing in her heart as she kept looking at Jun Wu Yao, strongly enduring the impulses of her heart.

Jun Wu Yao raised his brows slightly, his smile deepened.

“Do I know you?”
