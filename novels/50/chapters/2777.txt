Chapter 2778: Gu Ying’s thoughts (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Luo Qingcheng’s whereabouts were unknown. Although there was no news about her death from the Upper Realm, with Bai Zhu’s intelligence, he definitely had guessed that Luo Qingcheng could no longer be relied on. Without Luo Qingcheng, Bai Zhu’s only hope was Gu Ying. If Gu Ying turned to help Jun Wu Xie instead, there was really no support for Bai Zhu at all.

At this point, Bai Zhu wanted to calm down, but he couldn’t.

Gu Ying looked at Bai Zhu’s slightly flustered face with a smile, and said a moment of silence: “Are you afraid?”

Bai Zhu froze slightly and lowered his gaze.

Gu Ying chuckled and said, “You don’t need to worry. Though the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City is interesting, it’s useless to me. If the 72 cities were in his hands, then the Upper Realm will be embroiled in a wave of storms. I won’t help him in this battle. ”

Bai Zhu breathed a sigh of relief.

“Highness Ying is brilliant! I can’t help but wonder where Sea Spirit City got the elixir from. It can increase one’s overall power. Previously, that foolish Nangong Yan wanted to suppress the Sea Spirit City, but the result was Nangong Lie and the Sea Spirit City has become an ally. Before the Banquet of Heroes, Nangong Lie praised Yan Hai many times. Once the war starts, he will definitely side with Sea Spirit City. Yan Hai himself has the strength of a Spirit Ring exponent. If we include Nangong Lie, then the outcome ... ”

Bai Zhu kept talking. Gu Ying was not going to help Jun Wu Xie which means that he still had a chance.

“Spirit Ring exponent?” Gu Ying’s face showed a hint of surprise. He really did not expect the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City to be as powerful to the extent of wielding a Spirit Ring.

“Yes, the lad is very arrogant and holds a certain power. Otherwise we would not have such a headache?” Bai Zhu smiled bitterly.

Gu Ying narrowed his eyes and said after a while: “There’s no need to worry about Nangong Lie. His failed mission in the Middle Realm had rendered him almost useless, especially after suffering only from a minor injury. After returning, he is still very weak. Maybe he was not capable at all. Since Yan Hai has the ability to connect with one of the Top Ten experts, how about I send you another one?”

Immediately, Bai Zhu revealed a joyous expression on his face, as he looked at Gu Ying in disbelief.

“Highness Ying ... who are you sending to me?”

“Duan Qi.” Gu Ying said.

“Duan Qi? You mean Her Excellency Duan Qi?” Bai Zhu became nervous.

This Duan Qi whom Gu Ying mentioned, was an influential figure in the Upper Realm. That Duan Qi was from The Sacred Maiden Tribe. She was the elder of the tribe. Her strength was the top in The Sacred Maiden Tribe. In the name of the elders, it was impossible to withdraw from the list of the Top Ten Experts. But even without such a name, Duan Qi’s strength alone was enough to compete with the Top Ten Experts.

Even Luo Qingcheng was recommended by Duan Qi to the Lord at the time. Luo Qingcheng was there and when he met Duan Qi, he had to respectfully call her Aunt Duan.

It’s just that Duan Qi had a weird temperament and lives on Saint Peak. Few people could contact her. Even though she was a strong woman, no one could please her and get close to her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gu Ying had appeared in the Upper Realm only over the past few years but he even managed to establish a relationship with Duan Qi and was able to invite her to help him accomplish tasks...this really made it hard for Bai Zhu believe it.

“Exactly, Duan Qi has been idle recently, and it’s not difficult for her. With her help, your chances will be greater.” Gu Ying said.
