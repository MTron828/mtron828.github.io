Chapter 3089 This Is Vengeance 3

“Ha ha ha, oh, this is really touching ...” The God of Destruction looked at Qiao Chu and the others that stood before him. Suddenly he smiled with his bloodshot eyes. His gaze glazed past them as he looked at Jun Wu Xie standing behind them quietly with unconcealed malevolence.

“Jun Wu Xie, are you very touched? So many people are willing to die for you ...” The God of Destruction curled his lips. The thrill of revenge in his heart grew stronger and stronger. He stretched out his hand to point at Qiao Chu and said to them:

“Qiao Chu, Hua Yao, Fan Zhuo ... Ah, this ugly monster, should it be Fei Yan?

The God of Destruction’s fingers suddenly stopped when he touched the Fei Yan bandages on his face.

Fei Yan’s eyes stared sharply at the God of Destruction, but the God of Destruction laughed.

“It’s really pitiful to become such an inhuman and ghost-like figure and still thinking that you can come to save Jun Wu Xie. You really have too many partners and they are all willing to die for you. Ah, just like ... Ye Jue. “God of Destruction said with a smile on his eyes.

His words were like a bombshell and exploded in Qiao Chu’s heart.

Ye Jue?

Wasn’t that the name of Brother Wu Yao?

How could this guy say ...

“What kind of shit you talking about! You will die, not Brother Wu Yao. Don’t think that you can provoke alienation here!” Qiao Chu couldn’t help but yelled. His heart was faintly uneasy, and he was only aware of it now. Jun Wu Yao’s figure at al in the Sacred Hall. But according to the news given by Nangong Lie, Jun Wu Yao should have entered the temple together with Jun Wu Xie!

But... Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Where was he?

“Provoking? Ha ha ...” The God of Destruction smirked and raised his hand: “It’s a pity, if I said it’s not true, then ...” The God of Destruction looked at Qiao Chu’s Jun Wu Xie .

“Jun Wu Xie, how could she be so depressed?”

The deep voice of God of Destruction made a chill run down the back of Qiao Chu and the others and what scared them even more was the words from God of Destruction.

Jun Wu Xie’s state was indeed not right. From their appearance to the present, Jun Wu Xie had not said a word. She never even raised her head. The silent response made Qiao Chu feel even more panicked.

“Little Xie, Brother Wu Yao ...” Fan Zhuo turned his head slightly and asked Jun Wu Xie.

However, Jun Wu Xie stood motionless with her head down without a sound. Her breath was so weak that it was almost imperceptible.

No crying, no anger, no wailing ...

Only the faint breath sound echoed in the repressed hall, as if ... she could disappear at any time.

Jun Wu Xie’s reaction almost assumed everything God of Destruction said. Qiao Chu’s heart fell to the bottom of the valley in an instant.

“No matter what you said, as long as we are here, don’t you dare to touch Little Xie!” Hua Yao took a deep breath and forcibly suppressed his inner grief. It was not the time to feel sad when they are facing the enemy now. Jun Wu Xie was in a strange situation. Even if they were in pain, who else could replace Jun Wu Yao to protect Little Xie?

“Oh? You are handling your emotions really well.” God of Destruction chuckled and a sharp murderous intention flashed in his eyes.
