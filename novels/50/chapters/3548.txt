Chapter 2143: Heaven Defying Breakthrough (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

On the second day that she returned to the Spirit Jade Palace, Jun Wu Xie did not rush herself to go to Mount Fu Yao immediately, but instead gave herself one good day of rest. Over the past one year, her spirit had lived outside of her body and before she came back, the Spirit Lord had said that she might be a little unused to it, where she would need a period of time for her to adjust back to the way it was before.

But though she had waited a few days on her way back here, Jun Wu Xie did not discover any signs that her spirit did not meld completely with her body, which differed with what the Spirit Lord had said. She had asked Jun Wu Yao about it but Jun Wu Yao’s reply had been very vague, only telling her that she had two souls in one body which was rather unique and the fact that the Spirit Tree’s seed acted as reinforcement, her discomfort would then be reduced.

But.....

It did not feel like it had been reduced, but just that there wasn’t any discomfort at all!

“What is the Mistress looking at?” The little black cat asked as it jumped up onto Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder. Standing beside the stool, Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit were not as agile as the little black cat and all they could do was to just hop foolishly by Jun Wu Xie’s feet as they attempted to jump into her arms to seek her caress.

Jun Wu Xie stared at her hands, her mind seemingly thoughtful.

Having come back for so long, she had not felt any signs of her spirit power coursing through her. If not for the fact that the sense of touch of her hands felt different from when she was a spirit body, she really wouldn’t be able to tell that her spirit had already returned into her flesh body.

Jun Wu Xie stared for a while, and then suddenly turned her palms up, to attempt to turn her spirit power into flames within her palm like she had done before.

But.....

The purple flame she expected to see did not appear.

But a ball of silverish flame that was tinged with gold? That was what suddenly appeared in the palm of her hand.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes flared wide as she stared, looking in surprise at the ball of silver flames dancing in her palm.

‘BAM!’

Hiding high up on a beam in the room to watch over Jun Wu Xie, Ye Sha suddenly crashed heavily onto the ground. His eyes were filled with utter shock, where it was clear he could have landed on the ground nimbly, he had fallen clumsily on his face.

But his eyes were fixed unwaveringly upon the dancing flames that was a mix of silver and gold in Jun Wu Xie’s hand.

“Young Miss..... You..... You are about to rise up into the realm of the Gold Spirit! !” Ye Sha quickly climbed to his feet, the shock still evident on his face. The ball of fire in Jun Wu Xie’s hand was just too blindingly alluring and he just could not take his eyes off it.

“What?” Jun Wu Xie was lightly taken aback, unable to react properly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Sha immediately fell to one knee, and his voice was filled with immense delight.

“Congratulations Young Miss! You’re about to embark on a breakthrough to the Gold Spirit!”

“Gold Spirit?” Jun Wu Xie asked as she looked at Ye Sha, and then turned back to look at the flames she had conjured up with her spirit power, staring a little entranced at it. She had rushed the entire way back here and not summoned up her spirit powers at all. Moreover with Jun Wu Yao at her side, there wasn’t even the chance for her to need to do that and hence, she did not know the level of her current powers at all. It was the tranquil and peaceful state of her spirit powers that made her feel as if they had disappeared instead.

Never ever had she thought.....

Ye Sha’s heart was more shocked than Jun Wu Xie was feeling. Beginning all the way back from the Lower Realm, he had remained by Jun Wu Xie’s side. Towards the speed that Jun Wu Xie’s powers grew at, he knew it better than anyone else. Jun Wu Xie’s growth in spirit power had been extremely fast, and it was also because she possessed a plant type Ring Spirit. Her speed surpassed those of all the supposed prodigies, and it could be said to be rather Heaven defying.

But.....

However Heaven defying it was, it could not compare to the change he was seeing right before his eyes.

Above the Purple Spirit was the Silver Spirit, and the Palace Lords of the Twelve Palaces from before had only been Silver Spirits. When Jun Wu Xie left, she was clearly only at the Purple Spirit’s fourth stage! Who would have thought that after staying in the Spirit World for only one year, Jun Wu Xie had completely skipped the Silver Spirit level, to charge straight towards the Gold Spirit! ?
