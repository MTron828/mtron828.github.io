Only after Ye Mei finished his words did he notice Qiao Chu and the rest who were behind Jun Wu Xie. For a moment, he stood there completely dumbfounded.

“Big Brother Ye Mei, it’s been a while!” Qiao Chu leaned to the side and waved at Ye Mei enthusiastically.

Ye Mei was still in a daze as he looked at the people before him in shock.

“Qiao Chu? Rong Ruo? Hua... Why are you...” Ye Mei’s startled gaze darted over the few people, he had never imagined that this time, Jun Wu Xie would actually bring these few rascals back.

The surprise in his eyes dissipated only after his gaze met with Ye Sha’s. After seeing Ye Sha nod his head discreetly, the tacit understanding between the two made him understand that these had all been arranged by Ye Sha.

“Hey hey, isn’t this a pleasant surprise? Isn’t it unexpected?” Qiao Chu laughed out when he saw Ye Mei’s expression. He immediately flashed him a bright and brilliant smile.

The shock on Ye Mei’s face faded and it was immediately replaced by a sincere smile from the heart.

“This is a pleasant surprise and really unexpected, welcome to the Dark Regions.”

Perhaps with the arrival of this bunch of companions, it could slowly let Young Miss slowly emerge out of all that repressed emotions harboured up within, just this thought alone made him very happy.

“What did you say just now? Who is creating a din?” Fei Yan had caught the crux of the matter that Ye Mei had mentioned earlier.

Ye Mei regained his composure and the smile on his face vanished in an instant. With a wry smile, he said: “Who else could it be? Of course it’s...”

“Hey, hey, hey! Little brat! How could you be so untrustworthy and not stick to your words? We’ve already agreed that you are not to leave our line of sight and yet you snuck out! This is a violation of our agreement!” Before Ye Mei could finish his words, an unusually loud voice thundered out from within the hall.

A figure whom this thunderous voice belonged to was seen rushing out from within.

A burly man with an elegant face appeared before them.

That man seem to not have noticed the presence of Qiao Chu and the rest as he only stared at Jun Wu Xie with his deep grey eyes as he walked towards her. He had a delicate and refined baby face but when placed on that tall and macho body, let’s not to mention how conflicting that was.

“Little brat, if you do not stick to your words then let us just forget about the agreement between us!” That man furrowed his brows as he stared hard at Jun Wu Xie who had just returned. There was a strong dissatisfaction in the tone of his voice and he was dressed differently from the rest of the people from the Dark Regions. He was wearing grey robes that made him look like a valiant immortal....if one didn’t look at his face.

Jun Wu Xie looked at that explosive man unperturbed and replied in a calm manner, “I only went out to deal with some things.”

“Then couldn’t you have told us about it first? We would have accompanied you!” That man lashed out stubbornly.

Qiao Chu who was at the side blinked his eyes as he looked at that bold and unrestrained man before him. With a face full of surprise, he quietly sneaked over to Ye Sha’s side and asked in a curious whisper: “Big Brother Ye Sha, who is that? He doesn’t look like anyone from your Dark Regions.”

The people of the Dark Regions were unusually cold and quiet from their dressing to temperament but the man in front of him was the polar opposite.

Ye Sha replied, “It’s just but a group of unwelcome guests.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“What do you mean by unwelcome!!!” Ye Sha’s words had been heard by that man and he immediately shot him a glare and said in an extremely dissatisfied tone: “Do you think that we really want to stay here? If not for that item in your hands, we would not be willing to stay in such a cold and forsaken place!”
