Chapter 3036 His Highness Ying 3

“Highness Ying is too kind.” Jun Wu Xie said flatly.

Gu Ying said with a smile: “This time, Father let us act together, I wonder what Lord Yan has heard?”

Jun Wu Xie shook her head, “Nothing, I just received the news.”

“I see, although I don’t know the specifics, I heard my father mention it a few times before, that this time’s plans are related to those lost temples.” Gu Ying said.

“Lost temples?” Ju Wu Xie cocked her eyebrow, this was really the first time she had heard of it.

Gu Ying nodded, In the past, there were Gods in the Three Realms. They created the separations between the realms as well as its mountains and rivers but never revealed their true forms. According to legend, in the early days of the Three Realms, the people experienced many miracles and thus had faith in the power of the Gods and built temples to worship them in. The Three Realms then were much more peaceful than they are today and over time, the miracles and signs left by the Gods started to disappear. There are a few special places left that are remnants of that time but as time passes, both their number and strength are reducing.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“A long time ago, people were saying that the Gods of the Three Realms had disappeared, leaving nothing and their disappearance was a mystery to all. Father has sent us to find the lost temples that were built on the sites of the first miracles. These sites have been lost to landslides and earthquakes.” Gu Ying continued narrating this little known bit of history to Jun Wu Xie.

Nobody knew if the Gods of the Three realms really existed, it was tens of thousands of years ago and nothing could be verified. Furthermore, stories of the Gods were being told less and less. In the Three Realms, its inhabitants didn’t recognise any Gods and the stories that were being told were about His Lord.

“How are we supposed to find them if they have disappeared so long ago?” Jun Wu Xie felt something very odd about His Lord’s plan. And the stories about the Gods and the lost temples seemed too far fetched to be true.

Gu Ying shrugged, ” I don’t know, all the main leads have been given to Chi Yan. He is in charge of this operation. Although I am my father’s son, I’m just following orders, no different from you.”

Gu Ying paused, and then said again: “However, since three Knights of Destruction were mobilized at the same time, I think my information is accurate. I really want to see if the forgotten history is true, did the Gods really exist? ”

Jun Wu Xie looked at Gu Ying without saying anything. She was not familiar with Gu Ying, yet Gu Ying said so much in front of her, he was such a fool. Jun Wu Xie could also feel Gu Ying’s intention to win her over .

Jun Wu Xie who had just been promoted to the position of Knight of Destruction was obliged to follow His Lord’s plans yet His Lord’s own son was trying to win over as his new subordinate. How interesting.
