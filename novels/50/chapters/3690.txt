Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Huh? Did I hear wrong? You said that you....want to dismember my body into a million pieces?” A trace of surprise flashed by Qui Yun’s face before he started laughing out loud as if he had heard the most ridiculous joke. In a taunting stance, he stretched both hands out and looked at Ye Sha as he said in an unbelievable manner: “And how are you going to do that? With just the few of you here? Let’s not talk about my force of ten thousand men, even if they do not do anything, I can just simply kill off each of you one by one! The ones who would be dismembered into a million pieces would be you guys... don’t you think so?”

Qiu Yun swept his gaze across the men behind him and raised his eyebrow as he said in contempt : “What? You can’t tolerate other people speaking bad of Ye Jue, is it? Is he so sacred and inviolable in your hearts? It’s a pity...such a pity...”

He lowered his hands slowly as he looked at Ye Sha and his men and said, “That strong and powerful Dark Emperor in your hearts is now living like a dog, locked up in the dungeon, bound by the Soul Binding Chains. Do you want me to tell you how pathetic he is right now? Dark Emperor...haha..he is now just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, so what if I said that he is an imbecile? Not only is he one, he’s also a piece of trash! Even if I trample him in mud, what can you do to me?”

Qiu Yun spoke callously, unafraid of anything, he did not believe that the people before him could do anything to him.

Towards the envy and jealousy he felt towards Jun Wu Yao, he had no qualms about the world knowing about the miserable state he was now in. He wanted everyone to know that the once mighty Ye Jue had now been reduced to a pathetic worm who did not even have the freedom of his own body.

The eyes of Ye Sha turned extremely cold as a strong killing intent stirred from the depths of his eyes. In the Night Regime, there was an ironclad law – no one was allowed to insult Jun Wu Yao at all, or else the Night Regime would definitely give it their all and kill that person without scruples!

“Those who insult the Lord, die.” Ye Sha said coldly.

Qiu Yun scoffed as he looked at them struggling in futile, stubbornly acting all calm and unperturbed without any shred of apprehension.

“Die? Well, I’m standing right in front of now. I would like to have a look and see what kind of abilities you have to kill me!”

“Did you really think that no one has the ability to kill you?” Suddenly, a cold voice sounded above everyone!

The moment that voice rang out, Qiu Yun’s expression changed slightly. He raised his head subconsciously and the moment he looked up, he saw a figure clad in silver proudly standing in mid air!

A beautiful countenance that could bring down cities suddenly appeared in front of everyone and no one had noticed when this slender figure that was standing in the air had actually appeared!

She had appeared without any sound, even one as powerful as Qiu Yun had not even noticed it! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

When that familiar figure entered Su Jing Yan’s vision, it was as if he had been struck by a thunderbolt and he stood rooted in place as his whole body started to tremble uncontrollably!

Silver armour, a pair of silvery white wings and that stunning countenance that could bring down cities... It was exactly like five years ago, in the midst of Cloudy Brook Academy, the very person who had once created that miracle!

She was still alive...

She was still alive!

Su Jing Yan’s breathing stopped for a second as he stared at that figure standing proudly in mid air.

It was so ethereal yet so powerful, compared to five years ago, that face now had less of naïveté and it and had a more cool edge to it!
