A thunderous explosion echoed throughout the vast wilderness as scorching hot waves swept out with the explosion. Countless rubble rained down as the people around started to cry out in fear as they escaped. Clouds of dust swirled up as chaos ensued. Those black robed men left as quickly as they came.

“Wait...” The young man from the Rui Lin Army could only watch helplessly as he saw them leave at an alarming speed. By the time the words left his mouth, they had already left and he could only watch their departing backs in a daze. His heart started thumping fervently.

“Big brother, who are they?” That youth shrank back in fear, he thought that the guards were extremely strong but he did not expect that they could not even bear the assault from mere dozens of people. In just five minutes, they had all been annihilated. The strength of those black robed men had already exceeded their cognition. Even Gold Spirits could be slaughtered so casually.

Were this group of guys even human?!

The young man of the Rui Lin Army did not speak as a huge feeling of annoyance smouldered his chest. He should have gone up and asked when that man had first appeared!

Damn it!

Uncle Liu who was supported by that youth was gasping as he advised warily, “Little brat, don’t ask any further. Those people are not people whom you and I can provoke.”

“Uncle Liu, do you know who they are?” That youth gasped in surprise.

Uncle Liu looked around cautiously and only after determining that no one was paying attention to their conversation, he said softly: “A thousand years ago, the Middle Realm was not like this. What Twelve Palaces, what Nine Temples, they were but an ignoble existence. Then, when the Dark Regions existed, the Nine Temples did not even have a say in anything. It was only after the Dark Emperor had fallen and the Dark Regions suddenly disappeared. A thousand years has passed already. This time, even after the Nine Temples had did so many wicked deeds and spent a great deal of effort but yet they still could not find the location of the Dark Regions. I thought that the Dark Regions would just lay low but ha ha ha, I didn’t think that they could not endure it any more and started to retaliate. Just watch, provoking the Dark Regions, the Nine Temples only have the consequences to bear!” Uncle Liu’s voice was filled with gusto and satisfaction. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The actions of the Nine Temples over the past few years had been nothing but horrendous and they were even more tyrannical than the Dark Regions. The Dark Regions only suppressed the major forces but did not touch the ordinary people.

After the Nine Temples had taken over the Middle Realm, many people began looking forward to the return of the Dark Regions. Many prayed that the Dark Regions would come forth once again to suppress the Nine Temples.

And now, they had finally saw hope!

“Uncle Liu, you... You mean... that they are... people from the Dark Regions?” That youth widened his eyes in excitement.

Uncle Liu replied, “Other than the Dark Regions, who can still use the power of the dark spirit? Just wait and see, the good days of the Nine Temples have come to an end!”

The words of Uncle Liu tugged at the heartstrings of the youth, looking at the ruins of the Palace, his eyes were filled with yearning.

Did the Dark Regions really make a comeback?

In the midst of the strange silence, that young man from the that Rui Lin Army took a deep breath. He had to head back quickly and let Jun Xian know of what he had seen with his own eyes today. He had to let the entire Lower Realm know!

He immediately turned and departed in a hurry, no matter what that youth shouted at him, he did not look back.

His steps were swift and as he hurried on, his heart was full of hope and expectation.

He was still alive, this time around he had appeared but with the identity of the Dark Regions. Then, does this mean that... Young Miss.... She is well and alive? Was she... Also at the Dark Regions?!
