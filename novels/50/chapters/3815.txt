“Jun Wu Xie!” Luo Qingcheng gnashed her teeth as she looked hatefully at that familiar figure. Five years had passed and not once has she forgotten what she had done! She would not forget all the shame of that day!

The lady standing in front of the black army was wearing a silver light armour and rode on a white horse. It was a stark contrast with the surrounding soldiers dressed in black, while this black army seem to be “greeting” the arrival of Luo Qingcheng as more and more of them poured out from the city gates. The large army in black looked ready to welcome the army from the Upper Realm.

Luo Qingcheng pulled the reins and the army behind her stopped immediately. Everyone’s gaze concentrated on the black army that suddenly appeared.

All this appeared as if they had been waiting for the Upper Realm to arrive.

Jun Wu Xie sat on top of the majestic horse and advanced forward with the army of the Night Regime behind.

On the watchtower behind her, Jun Xian stood tall and looked at his granddaughter who stood proudly in the wind as he glowed with pride.

“This day has finally arrived.” Jun Xian sighed softly but there wasn’t a trace of sadness in his voice. Instead, there was a calmness and sharpness of a veteran’s experience in his tone.

“Duke Lin, please rest assured. Young Miss would surely prevail!” Standing at his side, Mu Chen said in an unwavering tone. Both himself and Bai Xu were skilled in medicine and just their strength alone, they were not suitable to participate in such a fierce battle. They had been arranged to stay at the rear and were ready to treat the injured soldiers.

Luo Qingcheng nodded his head, his gaze fixated on Jun Wu Xie’s back.

At Jun Wu Xie’s side, there were her companions who were going to fight beside her.

Qiao Chu, Fan Zhuo, Hua Yao, Fei Yan and Rong Ruo... This time they will fight against the army of the Upper Realm together with Jun Wu Xie, and will not repeat the mistake of five years ago!

The entire Night Regime had all assembled behind her as she led them forward and stopped about a hundred metres before Luo Qingcheng and the army of the Upper Realm. Jun Wu Xie once again saw the culprit who had destroyed everything she held dear to – Luo Qingcheng.

“I haven’t seen you for a long time, I didn’t expect you to be still alive. What a long life you have.” Luo Qingcheng sneered as she looked at Jun Wu Xie in the distance, her eyes filled with malevolence and burning with hatred.

The past five years had not left any traces on Jun Wu Xie. Instead, her features looked more defined and refined, looking all the more captivating than before. Compared to five years ago, she appeared even more beautiful than before. Five years ago, Jun Wu Xie already had a peerless countenance which Luo Qingcheng could still be compared to. However, after five years, Jun Wu Xie’s appearance had not changed much but with more refined features, and after the tampering of her temperament, she exuded charm that Luo Qingcheng could no longer compare to. This made more hatred and rage well up from within Luo Qingcheng.

Luo Qingcheng was extremely irritated when she saw her appearance.

Why?

It was the same five years but why did she have to suffer such tremendous humiliation but Jun Wu Xie appeared even more beautiful? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Luo Qingcheng’s hatred had soared to the sky and she could not wait to tear up that beautiful face and slash it into pieces!

Jun Wu Xie sat on the horse calmly as she lifted her cold gaze and swept it by Luo Qingcheng’s face which was filled with hatred.

“If I haven’t killed you yet, how can I die?” Jun Wu Xie’s voice was very loud but it was clearly heard by everyone.
