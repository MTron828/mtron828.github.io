“Today, if it’s not your death, then it would be mine. You can forget about thinking of taking another step further!” Jun Wu Xie said with her eyes narrowed as a cold glint flashed by her eyes. She held a light sword in each hand and held them crossed in front of her with her silver wings flapping behind her as she rushed towards Ba He!

“Hmph! Overestimating your own ability!” Ba He scoffed and said, “Catch Su Ya, no one is allowed to escape. I want all three of them to die without a place for burial!” As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately flew towards Jun Wu Xie!

A black and silver figure instantly clashed in the air.

Upon Ba He’s order, the rest of the Gold Spirits immediately chased after the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit.

“Who dares to move!” The little old man roared out as his body turned into a streak of light and rushed to the front of all the Gold Spirits. In a flash, he arrived before them as he turned his spirit energy into a formless blade and swept out. With one sweep, he had lopped off the head of one Gold Spirits.

Blood gushed out like a geyser from the neck of that man! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Blood rained down upon the little old man and he was dyed crimson in an instant.

“Want to catch my disciple, you will have to pass through me first!”

Those Gold Spirits were shocked by the murderous intent of the little old man and couldn’t help but take a step back. However, when they saw that Su Ya was brought out of the battlefield by the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit, they no longer cared about anything else and directly rushed towards the little old man. Hundreds and hundreds of Gold Spirits had encircled him and swarmed towards him like bees and swallowed the little old man!

For a moment, carnage ensued and the entire square was covered with a disgusting stench of blood.

Hundreds of Gold Spirits had deterred the little old man, even if he had three heads and six arms, it was still impossible for him to stop all the Gold Spirits.

Seeing that the little old man was besieged from all sides, some of the Gold Spirits immediately passed by the battlefield and chased after the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit.

The Nine Temple disciples had long been frightened silly from the scene that had unfolded before them. Each and every one of them stared with wide eyes and as they witness this gruesome and bloody battle.

Su Jing Yan secretly clenched his fists. The moment Jun Wu Xie had appeared, he understood that she had not given up rescuing Su Ya.

How bold was this? Knowing that the opponent that she was facing was a thousand Gold Spirits, yet she had refused to give up, wasn’t this tantamount to seeking her own death?

Looking at the Gold Spirits closing in on the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit, his heart was inspired by Jun Wu Xie and the little old man’s determination and his blood started to boil. He could not help but take a step forward, however, another elder from the Heavenly Wolf Temple that was standing by his side immediately grabbed his shoulders.

“You can’t go.” That elder said with furrowed brows, his eyes was filled with conflict as he was trying very hard to endure and it was obvious that he was extremely dissatisfied with Ba He.

“I....” Su Jing Yan was trying to find words but couldn’t find any.

“If you stand up to help, and the Nine Temples will be destroyed by the Upper Realm.” That elder said while he tightened his grip on Su Jing Yans shoulder.

They couldn’t move, nor did they dare to. If they struck out, their own deaths weren’t important, however, they would drag the entire Nine Temples down along with them.

Su Jing Yan clenched his teeth tightly and forcefully repressed his inner impulses and reluctantly retreated. He looked up and when he saw that the Gold Spirits were gradually closing in on the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit, his heart almost rushed up his throat!

“Roar!!” A loud furious roar reverberated throughout the square as a large white figure rushed out from the messy ruins. With its towering body, like a huge rock, it immediately sent all those Gold Spirits that were chasing after the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit flying!

The huge spirit beast snarled as it revealed its fangs as it stood defensively before the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit and Su Ya as it roared out vehemently!
