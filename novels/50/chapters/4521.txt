Chapter 3117 Xiao Xie 1

The night was silent.

After Qu Ling Yue left, Jun Wu Xie sat in the courtyard for a long time, until Jun Wu Yao walked to her under the moonlight and sat down beside her.

“What are you thinking about?” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie, and the love in his eyes was apparent.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head.

“Nothing much, just that time has passed by so quickly and so many people and things have changed.”

“Changed for the better or worse?” Jun Wu Yao inquired with a smile.

Jun Wu Xie sighed, “Do you think Xiao Zhuo has really let it go?”

Jun Wu Xie did not know how to react.

At the time when the God of Destruction was vanquished, there was a being that was not destroyed with him, it was Gu Ying. Gu Ying was a soul that had been released by the God of Destruction but somehow managed to gain a mind of its own.

After the God of Destruction died, Gu Ying’s soul was truly liberated, no longer subject to any restraint. When the God of Destruction died, Gu Ying did not leave, but appeared in front of Jun Wu Xie, as if he was waiting for something.

At the time Fan Zhuo was conscious but let Gu Ying go in the end...

Among them, only Fan Zhuo and Gu Ying had bad blood between them but Fan Zhuo decided to let him go.

Gu Ying’s soul was finally taken away by Gu Xin Yan but nobody knew where he was taken to.

“It was his own decision so I believe he would be at peace with it.” Jun Wu Yao replied. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In that game of chess, everyone was just a pawn in the God of Destruction’s game.

Jun Wu Xie sighed softly, “What about Little Mo Ye?”

“She’s asleep, Hua Yao is carrying her and I came to see you.” Jun Wu Yao replied.

Jun Wu Xue smiled and held his hand as she stood up.

Just as she was about to leave the courtyard, a holy light appeared suddenly and shone on an empty space in the yard!

The holy light was dazzlingly bright, making it impossible for anyone looking at it to open their eyes.

The sacred and pure light rooted Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao to the ground.

A petite figure emerged from the light.

“Hmm? What place is this? Did the main God trick me again?” A suspicious voice pierced the silence in the courtyard.

When Jun Wu Xie heard that voice, it was like she had been struck by lightning and froze to the spot!!

The figure casted its eyes over the courtyard and when it saw Jun Wu Xie, it suddenly burst out into a bright and radiant smile!

“Wu Xie!” A beautiful voice rang out from the person’s mouth. She was a beautiful and captivating young woman with not a single flaw on her face and radiated a strong energy.

Her warm beauty stood in contrast with Jun Wu Xie’s cool beauty but both were equally beautiful.

“Little Wu Xie! I’ve finally found you, I’ve missed you so much!” the beautiful woman rushed towards the rooted Jun Wu Xie with her arms outstretched.

But Jun Wu Xie suddenly regained her senses and raised her hand to strike the onrushing girl in her face!

The girl was stunned and looked at Jun Wu Xie. In her eyes there was no anger, just a sense of sadness and grievances.
