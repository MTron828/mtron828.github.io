“There is no need to tell a dead person who I am.” Jun Wu Xie said slowly and yet the words that she said were cold to the extreme.

Her words made Qiu Yun’s face change immediately.

“What do you mean? Did you really think that just relying on you, you’ll be able to kill me?” Qiu Yun suppressed the uneasiness in his heart as he acted calm on the surface as he looked at her.

The silver wings behind Jun Wu Xie was slowly moving and beneath the silver wings was a trace of wind and using them, she slowly walked down as if she was descending a flight of invisible steps.

The whole city was thrown into a state of silence as everyone’s eyes were concentrated on Jun Wu Xie at this moment.

From mid air, the woman who suddenly appeared descended from the sky like a Goddess. No one could pull their gazes away as that beautiful countenance paired with the valiant silver armour had a domineering air to it.

Amongst the disciples of the Nine Temples present, there were many who had participated in the battle of the Cloudy Brook Academy five years ago. At that time, they had all witnessed the tenacity and wisdom of that young girl but yet the one that stood before them today had made them realize that her reappearance had made them feel awe and respect from the depths of the heart which had never disappeared.

No one would ever have thought that in a span of five years when she appeared once again, her entire temperament had undergone a complete change. In the past, she was only cold and detached and people only felt appreciation. Yet now, it made people feel fear and reverence.

When her feet touched the ground, the silver wings behind her started to dissipate as specks of light gathered on the armour behind her and completely disappeared.

Everybody within the city seemed to be entranced by every move of hers, not willing to pull their gazes away. In their hearts, there seemed to be a huge stone pressing upon it and no one dared to speak. Even those Gold Spirits who were usually arrogant had remained silent and as their strength was stronger than those from the Nine Temples, they could sense that Jun Wu Xie was extremely powerful.

“Killing you isn’t that big of a deal.” After Jun Wu Xie had descended on the sky, her cold gaze casually swept over Qiu Yun’s body and the chill in her eyes seemed to be able to freeze the blood of a person immediately!

Qiu Yun shuddered just from a sweep of her gaze, he was like a person who had been grasped by his throat and he could not help but feel his body go cold.

With the narrowed distance between Jun Wu Xie and Qiu Yun, he could feel her power more clearly. However despite this, he felt even more unbelievable because he realized that he could not even determine her strength!

How could this be?! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiu Yun was extremely shocked by his own discovery. Initially, he had thought that Jun Wu Xie could be one of the strong experts from the Dark Regions and would have a decent strength but when he really felt her strength from a closer perspective, the uneasiness in his heart could no longer be suppressed and spilled out like water out of a broken dam!

He could not perceive the exact power of Jun Wu Xie but he could feel the pervasive pressure that was suffocating.

Such a situation was absolutely impossible if the person was weaker or comparable to him. There could only be one explanation for this!

The strength of Jun Wu Xie was far above his!

As soon as this thought emerged in his mind, he was so shocked by that he was drenched in cold sweat. Never would he ever have imagined that this young woman in front of him would actually be much more powerful than him!
