Chapter 1134: “Getting a Wife (4)”

Before this, those who had still been secretly thinking whether Jun Xie would just wed Qu Ling Yue carelessly in haste to merely get it out of the way, had upon seeing the extremely grand and elaborate team for the reception, immediately shut their mouths.

They could only silently grit their teeth, and look upon the girl they held in shame, as she was given to enjoy the wedding that all the girls could only dream of!

Within the Heavenly Cloud Chambers, Qu Ling Yue was dressed in an intense, fiery red wedding dress, standing highly ill at ease by the window. Outside the tightly locked window, the celebratory sounds of gongs and cymbals floated in, as her nervous hands tugged hard at the elaborately and intricately embroidered wedding dress, her hands covered in cold sweat.

With visibly trembling hands, she finally summoned enough courage to push open the window!

In the instant the window was opened, bright red flower petals fluttered in with the incoming rush of the breeze onto her face, as she saw the Thousand Beast City covered in a sea of flowery red, an innumerable amount of flowers having lit up the city who had just come out from a terrifying crisis, the intoxicating fragrance of flowers seeping deep into her nose!

The breeze gently blew through her hair, and her eyes stared wide, as she took on the breathtakingly beautiful scene right before her eyes.

The enchanting flowery sea mesmerized her eyes, everything seemingly a dream to her, so beautiful she wouldn’t be able to bear waking up from it.

“Like it?” A voice slightly tinged with a slight chill sounded out behind Qu Ling Yue suddenly.

Qu Ling Yue turned around in surprise, immediately seeing Jun Xie standing at the opened door, both arms crossed, looking calmly at her amidst the clamour.

Having avoided Jun Xie for so many days, but that very countenance that had been etched deep right into her heart and bones had not been wiped away in the slightest. In that moment that she saw Jun Wu Xie, her eyes suddenly shone with panic tinged with a sliver of bashfulness.

Even when she knew very well that the figure there was just like her, both of them girls, but without knowing why, Qu Ling Yue was still unable to quell that palpitation in her heart, as she looked upon the face of Jun Xie, her heart still beating madly as it always did when seeing “him”, the surge of emotions quickly turning her face red.

“You..... you don’t need to do this..... I know..... you are doing it for my own good.....” Qu Ling Yue stumbled over her words, her head lowered, suddenly feeling she was rather despicable. She understood the reason why Jun Wu Xie was doing this, and knew that Jun Wu Xie was a girl, but deep down in her heart, she still could not eliminate that wishful longing.....

Just for that one moment would be enough, even if she had to die the next second, she only wished..... to let this dream, last that little longer.

She didn’t want to wake, really..... don’t want to wake.

Just her remain within her despicable greed for this bits of bliss..... just a little bit.....

“You look, really ravishing today.” Jun Wu Xie said seriously, staring at Qu Ling Yue.

Qu Ling Yue’s eyes stared widely, as a cool gust blew in from outside the window, bringing in with it a flurry of flower petals, that swirled between her and Jun Wu Xie, making it such an enchanting sight that made one just wish they could make time freeze at that moment.

Jun Wu Xie touched her nose and coughed lightly to say: “Today the person going through the rites for the ceremony will be Hua Yao, as I..... do not know anything about all these. But rest assured, that I am still the one marrying you.”

Qu Ling Yue’s eyes flashed briefly, her face red as the night’s banquet hall. She lowered her head, and nodded obediently.

“If you are ready, then go downstairs first.” Jun Wu Xie said.

“Alright.” Qu Ling Yue’s head was still lowered, not daring to lift it up to look at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie did not have much more to say anyway and turned to walk out from the room. But she had just barely gone out Qu Ling Yue’s sight when she was wrapped up into a familiar embrace.

“I had not known that Little Xie could coax people so well.” Jun Wu Yao said through narrowed eyes, as he smiled at Jun Wu Xie.
