Twice, their schemes had been destroyed. Yan Wan and Old He were bewildered. Subconsciously, they had a strange feeling. Ever since returning from his voyage to sea, Yan Hai seemed to be different.

Only this point, Yan Wan hadn’t noticed nor cared until all those things happened, he abruptly came to a realisation that Yan Hai was no longer the little puppet that he controlled.

“That little bastard.... He’s become so bold!” Yan Wan’s eyes flashed a trace of viciousness. Since Yan Hai had already made his move, he was afraid that there was a scheme in place, if this continued...

“Go get Liang Shi Shi here.” Yan Wan said coldly. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Astonishment flashed in Old He’s eyes, he wanted to say something but Wan Wan sneered, “He was on the Upper Realm army roster but if he is courting death, even if there was the roster, it will not help him! Old He, don’t tell me you still want to allow that feel to do as he pleases? In the end, you and I will suffer.”

Old He thought carefully and sighed. He turned from the hall and left. Not long after, a prettily made up Liang Shi Shi walked in to the hall.

These days, Yan Wan’s mood was bad, which also caused Liang Shi Shi to be scared witless. She was deeply afraid that she did something wrong, and made things worse.

Yan Wan’s eyes are cold at this time, his cunning, snake-like eyes swept across Liang Shishi’s charming face.

“My Lord?” Liang Shi Shi felt scared at being stared at by Yan Wan as she approached him gently.

“You come here.” Yan Wan stretched out his hand towards Liang Shi Shi.

At this moment, Liang Shi Shi vaguely felt that Yan Wan was a little scary, but she couldn’t disobey. She could only obediently walked towards Yan Wan and hold his hand.

Yan Wan looked at Liang Shi Shi from close quarters. If Ling Xin was the top beauty of Sea Spirit City, then Liang Shi Shi was the glamorous one; not only was her face pretty, her figure was exceptionally lithe. Otherwise Yan Wan would not have married her in the first place.

“Tonight is your birthday, why don’t we host a banquet?” Yan Wan’s expression is murky, as he raised his hand to stroke Liang Shi Shi’s coquettish face, as he thought about things.

Liang Shi Shi was stunned, “But today is not my birthday.....”

Yan Wan’s eyes upturned, “Then from today onwards, it is.” As he spoke, he held onto Liang Shi Shi’s hand, gripping it just a little tighter.

Liang Shi Shi bore the pain silently, as she didn’t dare to scream. Her face turned pale and tears fell from her eyes as she looked at the malevolent face of Yan Wan.

“Yes... Today is my birthday.”

Yan Wan was satisfied and relaxed his strength, he suddenly pulled Liang Shi Shi into his arms and sat down. Liang Shishi panicked, not knowing what Yanwan was thinking, she could only assume a submissive attitude.

No matter how distinguished her identity was towards others, in the hands of Yan Wan, her good and bad was all controlled by his moods. If he was happy, she was the lofty, arrogant woman but if he was unhappy, she dared not utter a single word.

“Old He, go call Xiao Wei and the rest here.” Yan Wan looked up at Old He, who was in the hall, his voice sounded so venomous that it made people have goosebumps.

Old He looked Liang Shi Shi, who was keeping quiet out of fear, as she lied within Yan Wan’s embrace, with downturned eyes and left the hall.

Not long after, Old He led a couple of strong guards into the hall of the official residence.

“My Lord!” Several guards immediately kneeled.

A malicious cold gleam passed through Yan Wan’s eyes.
