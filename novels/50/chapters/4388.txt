Chapter 2984 The four knights 3

Long Yao was already furious in his heart, he never thought that Jun Wu Xie would dare to ridicule him in front of so many people. She even had the audacity to speak in such a manner, when he heard her words, it made him want to vomit blood.

“Of course, how can I not recognize Lord Yan?” Long Yao gritted his teeth and stared at Jun Wu Xie as he squeezed out his words.

Jun Wu Xie had killed Bai Zhu before him. She killed Fang Jinghe and the others, not leaving any intact body at all. It really was a resounding slap to Long Yao’s face, so much that, after that Long Yao took the initiative to resign from His Lord, he did not want to go to the arena again.

Now, even when passing by from outside the arena, Long Yao could recall Jun Wu Xie’s splendid performance in front of everyone that day. He would never forget how questionable those eyes were in the arena.

The Knight of Destruction was someone who stood on top of the Top Ten Experts. When everyone else saw him, they had to bow down and salute. Such a sacred and tall image disappeared under the bloody massacre of Jun Wu Xie. Everyone knows that the Top Ten Experts as well as Bai Zhu, were the people of Long Yao. But Jun Wu Xie killed these six people in front of Long Yao...without even leaving any bones behind.

Long Yao had been stifled by this over the past few days and it was so suffocating that he was still mulling over it .

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows in disapproval. In the face of Long Yao’s anger, she had no fear at all. The enmity between her and Long Yao had been made. No matter whether she humiliated him in public and showed unconcealed animosity, it was all his fault for instigating the Top Ten Experts to attack Qiao Chu and the others. He was the cause of Rong Ruo’s death and this was more than sufficient to become her target for all the grief and enmity.

This hatred would eventually come to an end.

“Since you recognize Long Yao, then I will not introduce him much.” Chi Yan seemed to have not noticed the undercurrent between Long Yao and Jun Wu Xie. He still had on the same expression as he looked to his side and said: “The one beside Long Yao is Jun Gu, a Knight of Destruction.”

Jun Gu heard his introduction and smiled as he gave a polite nod to Jun Wu Xie.

Because Jun Gu’s temperament was very gentle, he was the best person to get along with among the Knights of Destruction. Therefore, no one felt surprised at his friendliness towards Jun Wu Xie.

Instead, it was the woman beside Jun Wu Xie.

“This is Su Ruiying, another Knight of Destruction and the only woman among us.” Chi Yan looked at the woman beside Jun Wu Xie. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

That woman heard his words and turned her head slightly. She looked at Jun Wu Xie again. This time she got closer, and Jun Wu Xie noticed that Su Ruiying’s eyes were different from ordinary people. Her outer circle of the black pupil showed a circle of gray-white. When looking away from a distance, the circle of gray-white and the white of the eyes merged.

“Lord Yan, from Sea Spirit City?” Su Ruiying suddenly said as she stared directly at Jun Wu Xie. The gray circle of her eyes made her entire eyes look dim. No light, no difference to the dead.

Her eyes didn’t move. Being stared at by her always gave people the illusion of looking at the dead.

If it was someone else, I’m afraid she would have goose bumps.

But for Jun Wu Xie, who was used to corpses for so many years, there was no impact. Jun Wu Xie calmly said, “Yes.”
