Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

If it weren’t for Ye Mei and Ye Sha holding the fort, these brutes from Long Xuan City would have died many times before in the Sea Spirit City.

Jun Wu Xie quietly listened to everything that Qiao Chu said, looked up at Hua Yao and the rest who were standing at the back hall. Although they were as agitated as Qiao Chu, but in their eyes held a certain anger, they were obviously tormented by the people of Long Xuan City.

This sort of opponent who could be easily crushed with one finger, but yet for practical reasons, they had to allow them to run amok in order to keep the peace, must have really depressed the rest. This was not something that ordinary people could endure.

“Only Fan Zhuo’s temperament could withstand them a little. We don’t dare to meet those guys now, we’re afraid that if we can’t stand it anymore, we will just take their heads off.” Fei Yan was eager to roll up his sleeves for battle.

At first, they could still withstand it, but in the end, the thing that angered Fei Yan the most was... 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Rong Ruo had once talked to these people. The result was that the shameless bastards actually dared eyed the beauty of Rong Ruo and even hinted for Rong Ruo to accompany them. At this, it really angered Fei Yan and if Rong Ruo hadn’t stopped him, he would have chopped the Long Xuan City people up into meat sauce.

“Little Xie, what do you think? Do you want to... coax them first to stabilize the situation?” Qiao Chu touched his chin, they had just established their base in the Sea Spirit City, and in order to ensure that they were not noticed by the Upper Realm, they would have to conceal their strengths and bide their time.

Jun Wu Xie did not speak, but took the mask and wore it. The appearance of Yan Hai obscured the stunning face. After Jun Wu Xie made sure that her true appearance was well masked, she stepped into the hall.

In the hall, the people of Long Xuan City were still yelling at Fan Zhuo, and even the good-tempered Fan Zhuo was already burning with rage.

“What can you do? If you can’t do anything, get lost! The Sea Spirit City has no one else? They actually let a brat like you take care of us? Where’s Yan Wan that old man? Call him out, I am not interested in dealing with an immature, little brat like you!” A man from Long Xuan City looked impatiently at Fan Zhuo.

Fan Zhuo took a deep breath and forced down the dissatisfaction in his heart. Just as he was about to say something, a hand was placed on his shoulder.

Fan Zhuo turned his head to look at the owner of the hand and he saw Jun Wu Xie who was pretending to be Yan Hai, whom without his realisation had entered the hall. The quiet and cold eyes sent him a slight signal to stay calm.

Fan Zhuo was slightly stunned.

“Let me handle this.” Jun Wu Xie spoke slowly.

Fan Zhuo hesitated slightly, and finally nodded and retreated to the side.

The men of Long Xuan City, who simmering with anger, suddenly saw the appearance of Jun Wu Xie, and one by one had wrinkled brows.

“Who is this little brat, let you handle? Who do you think you are?” A big, fouled mouth man started shouting.

Jun Wu Xie, lightly and calmly sat down in the main chair of the hall, her face held no trace of anger, she was totally calm as she sat leisurely. Her cold eyes lifted slightly while looking at the ‘uninvited guests’ from Long Xuan City and slowly said,

“I am Yan Hai.”

“Yan Hai? What the hell?” The man of Long Xuan City did not buy it, but what another person said suddenly: “You are Yan Hai? The son of Yan Wan?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly.

“Yes.”
