But now that their souls have changed, the current Jun Wu Xie could not even bother putting Mo Xuan Fei in her eyes, the whole day he was thoroughly ignored, indeed, this made Mo Xuan Fei very unhappy.

Mo Xuan Fei thought that after he abandoned Jun Wu Xie, upon hooking up with his new love, she would be busy crying and may even attempt hanging herself, she would be brought to her knees while begging him. Who knew, she acted as though nothing had happened and even worse she treated him as if he was air. What’s more, she further entangled herself with the Crown Prince!

This was completely different from what he had thought!

When he had abandoned Jun Wu Xie, she should have been very heartbroken, how could she be so calm?

Mo Xuan Fei’s words made Mo Qian Yuan’s eyes flash a cold murderous intent.

“Whoever I choose to interact with, younger brother do not need to worry about it.”

Mo Xuan Fei eyes was staring at Jun Wu Xie the whole time, seeing that she had no response, his heart got more irritated as he brazenly retorted, “Imperial Brother has misunderstood, I was worried for Imperial Brother, as a prince, the Crown Prince of our State of Qi, whoever Imperial Brother chooses as a bride must also be able to be a mother to our Nation. Some people may be beautiful, but in reality are not very bright, Imperial Brother does not know her very well yet, I was really worried Imperial Brother would be fooled.”

Mo Qian Yuan was very unhappy, since when did Mo Xuan Fei had the right to come over to the Crown Prince residence and start finding fault at everything? Just as he was about to rebuke Mo Xuan Fei, he discovered that Jun Wu Xie who had kept her head down all these while had suddenly looked up.

A pair of cold eyes with a hint of smile, as if full of mockery looked towards Mo Xuan Fei.

“Is making a fool of oneself very fun?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly spoke up, as she casually glanced at Mo Xuan Fei and Bai Yun Xian.

“What did you say!” Mo Xuan Fei stared incredulously at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie glanced that Jade Dew pill.

“Meow”

Suddenly a black cat jumped on the table, it’s bushy tail inadvertently swept the bottle of pills off.

As the bottle fell, a shattering sound could be heard as a few white pills rolled onto the carpet.

“Jun Wu Xie! Look at what you have done!” Mo Xuan Fei bellowed angrily as he stared fiercely at Jun Wu Zie, Bai Yun Xian’s pills had been ruined!

Jun Wu Xie did not even cast a glance to him, just stared at the little black cat as in jumped onto the carpet. It went over to the exposed white Jade Dew pills and sniffed, but the next second, Jun Wu Xie pulled it back into her embrace.

“Do not eat, it’s dirty.”

Jun Wu Xie’s comment instantly made Bai Yun Xian and Mo Xuan Fei’s complexion turn green.

She actually said that Bai Yun Xian’s refined pills were dirty!

Bai Yun Xian’s face was completely black, she knew who Jun Wu Xie was and also knew the relationship between Mo Xuan Fei and Jun Wu Xie had before. This woman had previously stuck onto Mo Xuan Fei like glue, how dare she say such a thing?

Mo Xuan Fei was about to say something but Bai Yun Xian raised her hand, stopping him.

“Miss Jun.” Bai Yun Xian slowly spoke, her cold voice had a trace of pride and displeasure.

Jun Wu Xie ignored her as she continued fussing over the little black cat and even started brushing it’s fur.

“Although this Jade Dew pill is not a top tier medicine, but also very rare, and now that you’ve ruined the Crown Prince’s pills, don’t you feel that you are too rude?” Bai Yun Xian looked at Jun Wu Xie as though she was an eyesore, Jun Wu Xie was a Missy of Lin Palace, so what? Before her, compared to Qing Yun Clan, Jun Wu Xie was simply nothing!

In front of her, Qing Yun Clan Sovereign’s disciple, let’s see what kind of reply can she give, Bai Yun Xian sneered inwardly.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Bai Yun Xian in a condescending manner, “Rare?” She raised an eyebrow slightly, seemingly focusing on Bai Yun Xian’s Jade Dew pill as she felt a little ridiculous.

What was this attitude?! Bai Yun Xian frowned.
