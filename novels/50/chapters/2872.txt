Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Yan Xi stared at Han Shu in disbelief. Unexpectedly, this woman who had spoken to form an alliance with her previously would become so ruthless now. She saw the jealousy in Han Shu’s eyes, and that hatred was no less than that of Han Zi Fei’s !! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Yan Xi was completely awake. The alliance between her and Han Shu ended here. Regardless if she would be taken away by Jun Wu Xie today, Han Shu hated her the same.

The fast changing relation from an ally to an enemy had made Yan Xi understand how dark Han Shu’s heart was. But ... Yan Xi did not intend to end it here.

There was a hint of viciousness in Yan Xi’s eyes. A mist of water was brewing in her eyes. She raised her head pitifully, looked at Jun Wu Xie resentfully, and her lips trembled slightly: “Lord Yan ...”

The soft voice passed into Han Shu’s ears, making Han Shu raise her hand again.

But with this slap, Han Shu failed.

Jun Wu Xie grabbed Han Shu’s wrist and stopped her.

“Lord Yan? You ... don’t be fooled by this slut! She is not a good person at all, why do you protect her like this?” Han Shu looked at Jun Wu Xie with a grieving expression on her face.

Jun Wu Xie said nothing, throwing away Han Shu’s arms with a cold face.

This simple move made Han Shu’s face turn pale. Yan Xi, pretending to be pitiful, hid behind Jun Wu Xie and looked at Han Shu with a proud and provocative look.

That look almost made Han Shu crazy again.

“Yan Xi! You shameless thing! You were just a humble slut in the Sacred Maiden Tribe. If you didn’t deliberately please Elder Luo and begged her to teach you witchcraft to get the attention of His Lord. You desired to climb higher, begging Elder Luo, begging His Lord and Lord Jun Gu. Now, you are still trying to seduce Lord Yan. You bitch, you will die a violent death!” Han Shu smashed all the hatred on Yan Xi and wanted to grab and scratch Yan Xi’s face.

While Yan Xi pretended to be hiding behind Jun Wu Xie in shock, she looked proudly at Han Shu.

Duan Qi watched the farce that was about to stage in front of her. For the reputation of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, she could no longer sit back and watch. She rushed out and pulled Han Shu aside who was insane and scolded: You had enough! What do you look like now? You can afford to lose this person. But the Sacred Maiden Tribe can’t afford to let you be so disgraceful! ”

Duan Qi’s yelling made Han Shu find her rational. Looking at the proud Yan Xi standing behind Jun Wu Xie, her heart was thrown into the flame of jealousy. Looking at Duan Qi, she cried and said, “Elder Duan! You have to decide for me, Elder Duan, you don’t know what kind of person Yan Xi is. She is the one doing harm to Lord Yan ...

“You shut up!” Duan Qi’s good temper is now flushed with anger by this farce. She scolded Han Shu and immediately looked up at Jun Wu Xie, but her mind was extremely complicated.

If she could, she hoped Han Shu would be chosen. But who could imagine that the person turned out to be Yan Xi.

Looking at Jun Wu Xie siding Yan Xi, Duan Qi had no idea at this time. She could only pray that Jun Wu Xie would not really go to Jun Gu and that Jun Gu would not let Yan Xi go.
