While holding the smiles on their faces, those people who were being cold-shouldered did not feel embarrassed at all, whereas Old Wu who was still holding onto a gloomy expression had earlier been pushed away unknowingly to somewhere else.

But he wouldn’t have known that...

Their crew was actually really lucky.

The bunch of people who Old Wu envied so much had already been fed to the creatures in the sea!

Walking along the street from the harbour into the Sea Spirit City, Jun Wu Xie who had disguised herself into Yan Hai had been covertly observing the Upper Realm. All the things here were so unfamiliar to her. It seemed to have no much difference from the Lower Realm and the Middle Realm, but one would immediately notice quite a number of minutiae after taking a closer look.

In the Sea Spirit City, the weaker ones would always put on a fawning smile on their faces while the stronger ones would normally act in an arrogant and presumptuous manner. It was when the rules and regulations were supplanted by the strength of one’s power, that humans were forced to put their masks on and disguise themselves.

Qiao Chu and the others were following behind Jun Wu Xie, looking around at the Sea Spirit City. From the moment they first got their eyes on the city, they didn’t like the place. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The humidity of the air beside the sea was very high, and there was a dense smell of blood permeating through the humid air.

“Little Xie... what are we going to do now?” Stealthily, Qiao Chu got beside Jun Wu Xie. They were now stepping on the territory of their enemy, and once their identities were exposed, they would be crazily besieged by the people from the Upper Realm within minutes, even Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao wouldn’t be able to deal with the entire Upper Realm chasing after them with the invincible powers they had.

“We’re going to meet the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City,” answered Jun Wu Xie.

“Huh?” Qiao Chu stunned.

Jun Wu Xie looked calmly at Qiao Chu. Before killing Yan Hai, she had already figured out the current situation in the Sea Spirit City while the Night Regime and the Ghost Army had also learnt the duties they needed to do after returning to the city from the mouth of the people on the ships of the Sea Spirit City.

After returning to the city, every crew leader would need to make a hunting report in a specific place. The number of Sea Spirit Beasts that had been hunted was included in the contents of the report.

However, due to Yan Hai’s special status, there was no need for him to go to any places as the person he should be reporting to was his father, also known as the ruler of the Sea Spirit City – Yan Wan.

Since Jun Wu Xie had taken over the identity of Yan Hai, in order to not let the others notice any abnormality, it was for sure necessary for her to meet Yan Wan, the city lord of the Sea Spirit City.

“Yan Wan is Yan Hai’s father, will he notice anything?” Qiao Chu was a little worried. As the quote said, no one knew a man better than his own father, forget about the others, but Yan Wan was the father of Yan Hai, what if Jun Wu Xie accidentally gave herself away...

“Where do you think is this place?” With her eyebrows slightly raised, Jun Wu Xie cast a glance at Qiao Chu.

Qiao Chu stood in stunned at the moment. Subconsciously, he took a look at his surroundings and was then enlightened after he saw those people who had a weird expression on their faces...

They were now in the Upper Realm, a place that knew nothing about the family relationship. It was an extremely common thing for a son to kill his father during the authority dispute in the Upper Realm. Being in such an environment, the bonds of blood were just some absurd and ridiculous jokes.

“There’s no need to worry, I’ll go with you,” Jun Wu Yao let out a slight laugh. He was dressed like a normal youth with his stunning face hidden under the ordinariness, except that the pair of his devilish sharp eyes were still able to attract one’s soul.

“Don’t you get caught,” said Jun Wu Xie.

“Yan Hai” was the only person who was allowed to meet Yan Wan.

Jun Wu Yao chuckled, “Them? They don’t have the capability to find me.”

Where else in the Sea Spirit City would have such an expert who were able to notice his arrival?
