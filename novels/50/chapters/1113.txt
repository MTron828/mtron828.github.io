Chapter 1114: “I Came To Bring You Home (1)”

Within the Heavenly Cloud Chambers, the many favoured men were putting on pretences of affectionate as they awaited their “Mistress’” return, when unexpectedly, the people they saw crashing through the doors of the Heavenly Cloud Chambers were Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

“What are you people doing here? The Great Aunt is not here today. If there is something you want to see her about, you can return another day.” An alluring looking favoured man said arrogantly as he turned to look at Jun Xie. At the moment his gaze fell upon Jun Wu Yao, his eyes flashed with a momentary shock but it quickly disappeared.

However, his voice had just dropped when his head was separated from his body and blood gushed out immediately, splattering all over the other favoured men around him.

In an instant.

Howls reverberated within the Heavenly Cloud Chambers. When had these bunch of soft favoured men living in luxury been exposed to such a terrifying scene before?

They had enjoyed Qu Xin Rui’s backing all these time and even before the Thousand Beast City’s Grand Chieftain, they had been smug and highly arrogant. Suddenly seeing themselves being so nonchalantly slaughtered, they were immediately scared out of their wits.

The favoured men who had been so proud and arrogant just a moment before suddenly turned into birds startled by the twang of a bow (Chinese idiom translation), curling up their bodies tightly as they scrambled to hide in a corner, trembling visibly.

Jun Wu Xie was not about to waste her breath of these men without dignity. She went straight up to the top floor of the Heavenly Cloud Chambers and there, she saw the familiar sight of Lord Meh Meh.

Lord Meh Meh was lying upon the snow white fox fur, sleeping peacefully, the Spirit Taming Bone Flute placed just beside it. It did not not care about anything else surrounding it and the only thing that could make it react was only the Spirit Taming Bone Flute.

Many a time, Qu Xin Rui had wanted Qu Wen Hao to use the Spirit Taming Bone Flute to control Lord Meh Meh, but Qu Wen Hao had flatly denied her and totally refused to give in to her for this matter, completely giving up all his rights on the Spirit Taming Bone Flute. But besides him, Lord Meh Meh wouldn’t heed anyone else’s instructions and without any orders given to it, Lord Meh Meh had only instinctively stuck itself close to the Spirit Taming Bone Flute.

In a state of grogginess, Lord Meh Meh sensed that someone was approaching. It subconsciously opened its eyes and saw the tiny petite figure that had appeared before it.

It tilted its head slightly, and looked calmly at the youth approaching it, but did not do anything else.

“I came to bring you home.” Jun Wu Xie bent her body over, stretching a hand out towards Lord Meh Meh.

Lord Meh Meh was filled with confusion as it looked at Jun Wu Xie. This person’s aura made it feel highly comforted, as its consciousness that was suppressed by the Spirit Taming Bone Flute continued to be assaulted. There seemed to be a tiny voice within its heart that was telling it that the person before its eyes posed no danger to it, and that it should accept her embrace.

“Meh?” The person before its eyes was strangely familiar but no matter how hard it tried to think, it could not remember who she was. But deep within its sea of memories, there was a fuzzy figure, who was replicated by Jun Wu Xie’s figure before its eyes.

“Its consciousness is being suppressed and it cannot recognise you.” Jun Wu Yao said gently to Jun Wu Xie, as he observed Lord Meh Meh. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jun Wu Xie’s gaze fell upon the Spirit Taming Bone Flute at the side and she picked it up. Lord Meh Meh immediately stood up, its eyes highly mystified, but did not show the slightest intent to attack.

The voice deep within its heart was continuously telling it that it must not do anything to harm Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie slipped the Spirit Taming Bone Flute behind her back and reached out to carry Lord Meh Meh within her arms. Initially, Lord Meh Meh was rather squirmish as it twisted its body around, but as the all too familiar scent wafted into its nostrils, it slowly calmed the agitation within its heart. It finally wiggled its tail and found itself a comfortable position before snuggling into the embrace.
