Chapter 2999 Soul Transfer 2

Before Rong Ruo had time to digest this, the lady had put him on the table and started carving a new puppet.

Rong Ruo did not know how to describe that experience, the feeling he got, when his soul was being forced into an unknown shell, was one of sheer hopelessness.

In Su Ruiying’s hands, he was like a puppet with no autonomy. Everything was subject to Su Ruiying’s will. If Su Ruiying did not give the puppet the power to lift the seal, he could not move.

What was even more frightening was that as a puppet, he could still see, hear and process everything around him, he just could not move at all.

Rong Ruo did not know what was going on but was not willing to be Su Ruiying’s plaything. So when she was testing the puppets, he resisted and as a result, got sliced in the face by a knife and thrown into the fire. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was at that moment that Rong Ruo understood how it felt like to have one’s soul tortured.

As each little part of the puppet was burnt, his soul felt like it was being consumed by the fire bit by bit.

Fortunately, Su Ruiying had something on that day and had to leave the house soon after throwing Rong Ruo into the fire. After being in the fire, Rong Ruo suddenly gained control over the body and immediately escaped the fire.

But he was a puppet, locked in Su Ruiying’s house with no means of escape. He thought that would be how it ended but at that moment, he realised Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were there....

This was the last glimmer of hope for Rong Ruo.

“The puppets in Su Ruiying’s house all have souls and she can see and listen to what the puppets see and listen to. I realised that the puppet in your room was listening in on what you were saying so I got you to go outside.” Rong Ruo’s eyes had a serious look to them.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were considered cautious people but who in the world would have thought that Su Ruiying would have such a devious power?

If Su Ruiying retrieved the puppet from Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao’s room when they went out, she could find out everything that Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao said in the room through the puppet.

The result of that could not be predicted....

Rong Ruo told Jun Wu Xie everything he knew. At that moment, he was happy that he could protect his friend at a time when he was in such a poor state himself. This gave him a reason to be happy in the midst of his suffering.

That feeling of protecting one’s friends.

But Jun Wu Xie could not muster even half a smile. Every word coming from Rong Rou felt like sharp blades piercing her heart, giving her unbearable pain.

No matter how much Rong Ruo tried to make light of the situation, Jun Wu Xie was unable to imagine the suffering he had endured during this period.

Such a noble and proud soul had been imprisoned in such a small puppet, to become a toy for people...

At this, a murderous intent was rising in Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

The woman who had tortured Rong Ruo’s soul....deserved to die!
