Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Luo Qingcheng glared deadly at Jun Wu Xie. How she wished she was able to break free of the chains and choke her to death. She had never hated someone before like she hated her. This was the demon who had destroyed her everything, pushing her down cruelly from the highest cloud, causing her to own nothing.

Powerful strength, beautiful appearance and supreme status, everything was ruined by Jun Wu Xie.

It was exactly just as the way she destroyed all the things that Jun Wu Xie had owned five years ago.

What went around came around!

“You bitch! You won’t end well!” Luo Qingcheng didn’t know how should she vent her hatred out anymore. She couldn’t move and even if she got her freedom back, she was no longer an opponent of Jun Wu Xie.

“If I know it earlier that I would end up like this, I shouldn’t be this softhearted during that time. I should slice you into pieces!” Luo Qingcheng regretted so much. How would she ever know that a useless trash who was unworthy of even mentioning would send her to the Hell five years later?

“Softhearted? You’re really good at finding excuses for yourself.” Looking deprecatingly at Luo Qingcheng, Jun Wu Xie had never thought of Luo Qingcheng’s kindness as the reason for her survival. Her life was exchanged by using Jun Wu Yao’s five years of freedom and the death of Ren Huang. It had nothing to do with Luo Qingcheng!

“Are you done? If you’ve finished talking, I have something to ask you.” Jun Wu Xie did not plan to waste her breath on Luo Qingcheng. The purpose of her coming today was not to quarrel with her.

“I won’t tell you anything. Don’t even think about it!” Luo Qingcheng sneered. She said that she had something to ask her? How naive was Jun Wu Xie for her to actually think of asking her something? She would rather die than answer any questions asked by Jun Wu Xie.

Looking coldly at Luo Qingcheng, Jun Wu Xie slowly took out a bottle of drug from her Cosmos Sack.

“Answer or not, it’s not up to you.” Jun Wu Xie glanced over Bai Yunxian and said. “Let her drink it.”

Without speaking anything, Bai Yunxian took the bottle and walked towards Luo Qingcheng. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The expression of Luo Qingcheng became horrified at that moment. The poison which Jun Wu Xie used on her five years ago made her suffer five years of torment. No matter how strong her hatred for Jun Wu Xie was, it was still not able to wipe off the fear she felt for Jun Wu Xie.

“What poison are you going to use on me again! I won’t tell you anything! I’m not going to drink it! Screw you!” Eyes widening, a scream with an altered tone came out from Luo Qingcheng’s mouth. She looked at Bai Yunxian who was walking towards her with the bottle of drug holding in her hand in horror, the face which was originally ugly and hideous became even scarier to look at due to her scream.

Bai Yunxian felt no pity for Luo Qingcheng at all. No matter how powerful Luo Qingcheng once was, now, she was just a piece of meat on the chopping board, waiting to be cooked by the chef.

Bai Yunxian forcefully opened Luo Qingcheng’s mouth and poured the drug into it. After that, she stepped aside.

Bai Yunxian had learnt the venomous of Jun Wu Xie’s poison before with her own eyes. She knew it very well that no matter how determined Luo Qingcheng was now, once she took the drug, even the most persistent saint would take the surrender.

Among the Three Realms, no any other one would have higher medical skills than Jun Wu Xie.

If she insisted, there wasn’t any answer that she couldn’t get.

After watching Luo Qingcheng took the drug, Jun Wu Xie did not hurry herself to speak. Instead, she was just standing aside calmly while Bai Yunxian who was being considerate had asked someone to bring Jun Wu Xie a chair so that she was able to sit comfortably in the room, waiting quietly for the poison in Luo Qingcheng’s body to take effect.

The burnt black face of Luo Qingcheng was covered with twisted hatred. Unwittingly, a kind of weird feeling began to spread across her whole body.
