“She has fled for a thousand years. She came back suddenly and made such a request as soon as she returned. My Lord ... I’m a little scared ... Although I was a maiden of the Sacred Maiden Tribe and she’s our Sacred Maiden... But Yan Xi had served My Lord for many years. With the Sacred Maiden’s character ... ” Yan Xi looked at Jun Gu with a worried expression.

What Duan Qi and others wanted was to keep the good reputation of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Therefore, no matter what Han Zi Fei has done, they will try to cover it up. But Yan Xi thought differently.

What does the Sacred Maiden Tribe have to do with her?

Why should she cover up those matters for Han Zi Fei?

After Yan Xi finished speaking, she watched Jun Gu’s reaction secretly. The fact that Han Zi Fei rebelled and fled the Upper Realm secretly was enough to destroy the image of her. Yan Xi even made it clear that the marriage was initiated by Han Zi Fei. Highlighting to Jun Gu that all these were Han Zi Fei’s arrangements.

Yan Xi was unable to prevent this marriage. The only thing she could do was to let Jun Gu hate Han Zi Fei as much as possible.

She even felt that Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei were not compatible.

After listening to Yan Xi’s words, Jun Gu didn’t react much. His calmness made Yan Xi feel a little nervous.

For a while, he noticed the strangeness in Yan Xi. The good-natured Jun Gu smiled and said, “Thank you for reminding me to have a certain understanding of my future wife. But now that I have come to the Sacred Maiden Tribe, this matter was originally approved by His Lord, there is no room for further discussions. The Sacred Maiden Tribe has arranged a banquet in the evening, you must be tired, why don’t you take a rest first. ”

Jun Gu was not interested in the story of the Sacred Maiden Tribe and that Sacred Maiden, whom he was about to marry. How that person’s temperament or character did not make any difference to him. The resistance that lingered in his heart and that steel control of obedience had disturbed his mind, hence he had no intention to think about it all.

“I’m not tired, but My Lord can take a good rest, My Lord... do you blame me for talking too much?” Yan Xi looked at Jun Gu nervously.

Jun Gu smiled and shook his head

No matter what Yan Xi said, she was just wasting her own breath. Jun Gu was not interested in anything she said. Yan Xi could only go back to the room first but she was looking forward to today’s feast. If Han Zi Fei was to create trouble, this would make Jun Gu dislike her.

Time passed, minute by minute, as the moonlight was cast over the Holy Mountain. Duan Qi and the others meticulously prepared for the banquet to celebrate the arrival of Jun Gu. This time, they had invited Jun Wu Xie along to the banquet.

On one hand, it was to attract Jun Wu Xie’s attention through Jun Gu, and the other was in hope that the arrival of Jun Gu will completely make Jun Wu Xie lose interest towards Han Zi Fei.

No matter what their purpose was, it was meaningless to Jun Wu Xie. As long as she could see Jun Gu, she was fine with anything.

“Do you need me to accompany you tonight?” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie who was putting on her mask as he sat comfortably on the armchair with his legs crossed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Since he had arrived in the Upper Realm, he had lived a leisurely life. Usually, no matter what, Jun Wu Xie did not need him to do anything. She was adamant about keeping him hidden in the Upper Realm as much as possible. .

This was the first time for so many years Jun Wu Yao had felt the delicate feeling of being “protected” by others.
