Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie, “We’re not the souls of this world.”

Jun Wu Xie was enlightened. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jun Wu Yao reached out his hand and wrapped Jun Wu Xie around his arms, “Let’s go now.”

The speed of the light that was spreading across the Soul World was too fast. If they continued to let it be, the entire Soul World would be annihilated. Jun Wu Yao wasn’t afraid of being sacrificed. In the past, he just didn’t like the feeling of being used by someone, but now, he definitely wouldn’t allow the plan of the Upper Realm to be carried out successfully.

It was all just because...

He was no longer the only otherworldly soul in the Three Realms. Once the Soul Sacrificing Event was held successfully, Jun Wu Xie too, would be sacrificed!

Not even wanting to waste a second of time, Jun Wu Yao immediately flew towards the summit of the Soul Mountain while carrying Jun Wu Xie in his arms!

All Qin Song and Long Jiu could do was just watching the back figures of both the two people who were leaving with an expectant gaze.

On the peak of the Soul Mountain, wails of the souls kept on bursting one after another. It was such a shrill scream that it almost pierced through one’s eardrums!

While standing beside the Soul Ascending Altar, Yan Xi looked at the light which was gradually spreading through the entire Soul World with a trace of viciousness flaring across her eyes. Inside the prisons that were located around the Soul Ascending Altar, the first batch of spirit envoys who were being affected had already become the oblation of the Soul Sacrificing Event. The soul entities of theirs were getting more and more transparent. While twitching with their mouths opened and eyes staring big, it could be vaguely seen that the soul power was still constantly evaporating from their bodies, flowing towards the light sphere, making the spirit envoys the sacrificial offerings of the Soul Sacrificing Event.

“Very good. It won’t take long before the plan of His Lord succeeds.” Yan Xi looked at everything that happened in front of her eyes in satisfaction. Even if Ye Jue was in the Soul World, so what? Once the Soul Sacrificing Event began to show its effect, it would be the time for him to be sacrificed, and the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms... would soon turn into reality.

By that time, no one else was able to stop all of these!

“Lord Yan Xi!” All of a sudden, a soldier from the Upper Realm came anxiously to Yan Xi with an extremely ghastly expression hanging on his face.

“What’s wrong?” Yan Xi frowned slightly. She didn’t want to be bothered by anything in such a critical timing.

“There are enemies on the Soul Mountain! They are heading here at a very fast pace!” Shivering in fear, the soldier responded.

“There are soul entities who are able to resist the Soul Sacrificing Event?” Yan Xi knitted her brows into a deep frown. Once the Soul Sacrificing Event began, the soul power of all the soul entities who were enshrouded under the light would immediately be extracted out from their bodies, same went to the people coming from the Upper Realm, and this was why they had all pinned up the badges, that were used to isolate themselves from the Soul Sacrificing Event, beforehand.

Nevertheless, it was said that there were still soul entities who were coming over here?

“It’s... It’s Ye Jue...” said the soldier, trembling.

Yan Xi’s eyes suddenly widened!

This was too fast!

Yan Xi raised her head and looked at the huge sphere of light that was still constantly absorbing the soul power, eyes narrowed.

“No matter how, stop him! Do not let him get near to the Soul Sacrificing Event!” Severely, Yan Xi placed her order.

Just give her a little more time and the Soul Sacrificing Event would be completed!

Just stall for a few moments!

The blood of every single soldier from the Upper Realm ran cold in terror. The name of Ye Jue was just like a nightmare which couldn’t be gotten rid off from their minds, but Yan Xi had given her order, there was no way they would have the courage to disobey her, and thus, they could only forced themselves to the mountainside of the Soul Mountain to block the route of Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie!

“Everyone, go and block him! Do not let him get to the peak of the mountain!” Yan Xi shouted. The plan was so close to succeed, she definitely wouldn’t allow any mishaps to occur at this period of time!

A large amount of soldiers rushed towards the mountainside of the Soul Mountain, and at the same time, Jun Wu Yao had already stepped onto the Soul Mountain with Jun Wu Xie. There was only one path to the summit of the mountain in the dense mountain forest, and the whole Soul Mountain had already been sheathed by the green light.
