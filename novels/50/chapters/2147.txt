Chapter 2148: An Accident Occurs (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The person that Ye Sha carried back was brought right into her own room by Jun Wu Xie. Ye Sha carefully laid the person down onto the bed and retreated to the side.

Xue Er saw Jun Wu Xie and her group suddenly return and was actually feeling a little curious where she was about to go in to ask about it when she saw the masked girl shaking her head at her. She immediately did not dare to ask any questions but just stood by the door.

The person lying on the bed caused Jun Wu Xie to crease up her brows. The amount of wounds on his person was shocking to see and after looking through his condition, it made Jun Wu Xie’s breathing become slightly repressed.

The wounds on the person’s body did not have a single one that was fatal, but were inflicted on every part of him to give him the most agony. The nails on both his hands and feet have been pulled right off and there were two bleeding holes about two thumbs’ width at his shoulder blades. His arms, face, back and chest were filled with gory wounds and a chunk of flesh had been sliced off from his thigh.

It was hard to imagine how this person could have held out with such a badly battered body to drag himself all the way to this place.

With such severe injuries, even if none of them were fatal, add them all together with the rotting and inflammation, it would be able to take a person’s life as well!

Jun Wu Xie did not dare to delay another moment. The words the man had said before he fainted had terrified her. She must save this person no matter what, or she would not be able to eat or sleep well.

She brought out a whole bunch of elixirs and medicines, generously pouring them into the person’s mouth. She used a small scalpel to cut away the rotten dead flesh and cleaned out the wounds, disinfected them and proceeded to sew them together.....

Jun Wu Xie conducted herself systematically without getting flustered. Although she worked speedily, she did not miss anything out.

Xue Er who stood by the door watched Jun Wu Xie work her godly hands of healing, and her eyes could not help but widen, her face one of complete amazement.

“Miss Jun is just superb. One will not be able to find a physician that would be able to match her healing skills throughout the entire Middle Realm.” Xue Er said in a low voice to the masked girl.

But the masked girl did not reply to her words, but just looked on a little worriedly as she watched the busy Jun Wu Xie carrying on with the treatment.

The name Su Ya was one that she had heard before. That was the name of Jun Wu Xie’s Master in the Cloudy Brook Academy. Jun Wu Xie valued her Master very much and that person’s words earlier would definitely have worried Jun Wu Xie.

Basin after basin of blood filled water were carried out. Xue Er and the masked girl wanted to help and they silently went to prepare hot water, taking up the menial task.

The round of treatment went on for an entire day, going on until Jun Wu Yao came back. Jun Wu Xie had just finished with all her treatments and throughout one whole day, she had not even had a sip of water, the anxiety in her heart causing her to be unable to stop for even a second.

“What happened here?” Jun Wu Yao asked with an eyebrow raised as he looked at the blood covered Jun Wu Xie standing by the bed. If not for the fact he knew that the blood was not Jun Wu Xie’s, it was feared that he would already have given to rage.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head, and Ye Sha hurriedly walked over to come over to Jun Wu Yao from the side, to relate the series of events that had happened earlier to Jun Wu Yao. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jun Wu Yao’s brows furrowed together slightly. Jun Wu Xie was seemingly cold and indifferent, but her heart inside highly valued her ties and bonds in her relationships with her loved ones. She was like that with family, and she was the same with her Masters.

Jun Wu Yao immediately walked over to the side of the bed, and looked at Jun Wu Xie who stood beside him with her head lowered. Understanding the kind of worry and unease that filled her heart, he did not say a word, but merely bit through the skin on his finger, and dripped a drop of his blood into the person’s mouth.

Jun Wu Xie’s healing abilities was unparalleled, but that person was just too severely injured. Even if all his wounds were tended to, it was feared that he would still need a few days before he would regain consciousness, and Jun Wu Yao knew that Jun Wu Xie would not be able to wait that long.

Upon seeing Jun Wu Yao’s action, Ye Sha who was standing at the side wanted to say something, but was finally unable to voice it out.
