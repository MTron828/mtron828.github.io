3072 The Frost Goddess 3

That was probably why the Goddess of Frost had a sense of familiarity to her.

The Goddess of Frost was stunned for a moment then smiled, “Oh it is the God of Light, no wonder you feel familiar to me. I still remember the paradise back then but it’s only a dream now.”

Whether it was a dream or not, it was now no more.

As soon as she finished speaking, two bolts of power shot out from her eyes and went into Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao’s bodies before they had time to react.

“The only reason I was able to hold out this long was thanks to this chaos power but now I am sober and my beloved is not with me anymore.” her figure was gradually disappearing while she smiled faintly.

The Goddess of Frost looked into the distance, as if looking for the lost shadow of her other half.

“He is alive when I was not, I am alive but he is..... Dancing with him for long days, he dances alone.... A soft sigh, after years of chaos... I am far apart from him, I’m here and he isn’t. I ask if he is cold, where he is, is where I am. Where he goes, is where I shall go.....”

With that, along with two trails of tears, the Goddess of Frost disappeared.

As she disappeared, it started snowing. It was a beautiful sight but when the snowflakes fell on their bodies, they carried a sense of cold desperation, representing the love that the Goddess could never retrieve.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the falling snowflakes and stretched out her hand to catch one in her palm. As it melted in her hand, she suddenly clenched her fist.

“I will take revenge on your behalf.”

Jun Wu Yao went to Jun Wu Xie’s side, wrapped her fist in his hands and said, “All debts will be repaid one day.”

“The God of Destruction wanted to trap us in the Chaos Array forever but instead we have gained new powers. It has turned out for the best.” Jun Wu Xie unclenched her fist and could feel the new power coursing through her.

She wanted to repay him a 100 times over!

There was a loud sound, like a sonorous clanging of a large bell.

The both of them, using their newly gained chaos power, took towards the hold that suddenly appeared in the sky and finally left the Chaos Array.

When they emerged, they saw the guards they had slain just a few moments ago, they were lying in their still fresh pools of blood. It was as if only a few moments had elapsed.

“In the end, time in the Chaos Array has no meaning.” Jun Wu Xie squinted her eyes. They had spent such a long time in the array but on the outside it was over in the blink of an eye.

Jun Wu Yao nodded slightly, everything in the Chaos Array was like a dream. It was like a strange dream that he and Jun Wu Xie had experienced together. But the power in their bodies was real.

“I want to see what his reaction is when the God of Destruction sees us.” Jun Wu Yao’s lips curved into an unrestrained evil smile. Having planned and calculated every step for so long, finally the God of Destruction had made a miscalculation.
