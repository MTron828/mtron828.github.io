Chapter 3054 Lost divine power 2

The God of Destruction was unable to break the void by his own power, he needed more divine power. Whether it was herself or Jun Wu Yao who had the power, the difference was that the power of Jun Wu Yao was deliberately suppressed by someone and her power had long been lost.

That man tried hard to coax her into the Seven World of Dreams to recover her lost power, and thus became his real help for breaking through the void!

Jun Wu Xie understood everything thoroughly, and the person who had been fighting with her was not just a person, but a God!

“You are right.” The woman smiled slightly. “He is very smart. We have been trapped in the Seven World of Dreams for too long. We cannot leave, nor can we escape. We are trapped in this little dreamland. The middle is a kind of torture. We can’t stop him. He knows very well that we can no longer endure this kind of suffering, and you are not only his hope, but also our hope. ”

The woman smiled slightly. She picked up the paper umbrella on the ground again, and as the paper umbrella fell into her hands, the calm lake was undulating in an instant, and the lake formed a huge water curtain under the waves. The figure turned into a little star in an instant.

“Soul from another world, I would like to give my soul to you, only at the moment of your divine awakening can you save the world and restore it to its former peace.

The woman’s final voice dissipated in the water curtain, and the lake exploded suddenly, turning the water droplets as fine as raindrops, which were scattered all over Jun Wu Xie’s body.

Jun Wu Xie only felt a refreshing feeling spread all over her body, covered with lake water all over her body, but yet there was no moisture at all. The water droplets that refracted the sun, like the stars in the environment, started to be absorbed into her body little by little, until they disappeared...

In an instant, the consciousness of Jun Wu Xie suddenly fell into a darkness, all the scenery in front of her disappeared in a moment without a trace, she vaguely saw that there was such a ray of light lingering in the darkness, she was moving towards the light...

Among the green mountains, Su Ruiying stared blankly at everything in front of her. Her eyes were filled with an indescribable panic. She turned to look at the people around, looked at the ghoul masked man, looked at Chi Yan, looked at Qin Qi, Looking at Gu Xinyan and Jun Wu Yao ...

But only the figures of Jun Wu Xie and Gu Ying were absent.

“Chi Yan! Where is Lord Yan Hai and Highness Ying?” Su Ruiying looked at Chi Yan with an incredible look. She had been walking at the end of the team before, but after entering the mountain, Jun Wu Xie and Gu Ying were in Her eyes became more and more blurred, until she entered the mountain, she could no longer see Jun Wu Xie and Gu Ying.

These two people, in front of her, disappeared completely without a trace.

“It’s all been done.” Chi Yan suddenly said and stopped. He had just reached the foot of the mountain and he had no plans to move on.

Qin Qi was extremely obedient standing next to Chi Yan. He took out the paper umbrella that had been prepared, and shaded Chi Yan from the blazing sun. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s all been done? What do you mean?” Su Ruiying panicked. To be honest, she had been a Knight of Destruction for so long, but she had never been able to understand Chi Yan’s temperament. She only knows that Chi Yan was a very stubborn person. He only obeyed His Lord’s instructions, and he would not pay attention to anything else.

“It means literally. The purpose of our mission has been achieved. You can continue to wait here. The rest is not what we need to do.” Chi Yan said calmly.
