Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Only the unknown bloody smell was strong.

“That’s enough, leave us.” However, Ruan Chongshan did not burst in anger as they had anticipated, he lifted his hand to wave off the group of healers.

The group of doctors were shaking with fear as they left, thinking that they had not been able to complete the task this time, and they would be scolded. But they did not expect that Ruan Chongshan would be so ‘kind’ today.

A group of doctors didn’t dare linger around, in a blink of an eye, they ran away.

The steward once again packed the elixir and placed it in Ruan Chongshan’s hand.

“It seems that the person whom you obtained this from is quite reliable.” Ruan Chongshan’s face was not displeased, instead it held a smile.

The group of healers who were called to the residence was to make sure that the elixir was not rubbish. Although those doctors could not be compared to the divine doctor who worked for His Lord, they were also quite capable in Long Xuan City. Even with rare elixirs, although they could not recreate it, it was not difficult to distinguish one or two medicinal properties. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But upon seeing this elixir, none of those healers could recognize it, to the point of not being able to discern the herbs used in making the elixir.

On the contrary, with such a situation, it only made Ruan Zhongshan feel relieved.

It seems like this medicine should not be fake.

“Yes.” Xu Zu stood earnestly in front of Ruan Chongshan, but his heart felt a little diffident.

Ruan Chongshan was a weird character, he looked fierce and solemn, but in fact, everyone who had been with him for a long time knew about his suspiciousness and paranoia. The reason why he called those healers to check this elixir, in addition to ensuring that the people in Sea Spirit City did not tamper with the pills, was also a kind of defense against Xu Zu. After all, the Sea Spirit City elixir was so mythical that it was difficult to guarantee that it would not evoke greed in the hearts of others.

Thinking of this, Xu Zu could not help secretly gulp.

“I just don’t know if this medicine can really enhance the spiritual power.” Ruan Zhongshan squinted his eyes. In fact, with his current strength, there was not much requirement for this elixir, but if this medicine could be used to improve the standard of soldiers in Long Xuan City, then the status of Long Xuan City among the seventy two cities would be greatly improved.

With just this, Ruan Chongshan would not easily let go of such an opportunity.

“I don’t know the whole ...” Xu Zu said cautiously.

Ruan Chongshan’s eyes slowly fell on Xu Zu’s body, as he thought, “To try and find out if this medicine really works, there is a simple way ...”

Ruan Zhongshan didn’t finish his words, but how could Xu Zu not know what he meant. Even though he seemed calm on the surface, but Xu Zu’s palms, sticking to his side, had started to sweat involuntarily.

Who didn’t want an elixir that can improve spiritual power?

Xu Zu ‘s reaction did not escape Ruan Chongshan ‘s eyes. Ruan Chongshan suddenly crossed one leg over the other as he leaned back, “Xu Zu, this matter with Sea Spirit City, you did it, and you brought back the elixir. Would you like to try the effect of this medicine?”

Xu Zu was glad, but he did not dare to reveal the slightest. He could suppress his inner excitement and knelt on one knee and said, “It all depends on My Lord.”

“Okay.” Ruan Zhongshan nodded slightly and said to the steward on the side: “Give him the medicine.”

According to Xu Zu’s previous description of this medicine, this medicine was only helpful to those around Gold Spirit level, and strong players like Ruan Chongshan who have reached the strength of Spiritual Inscriptions would have no effect.
