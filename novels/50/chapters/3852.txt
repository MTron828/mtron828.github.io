Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Ye Gu was a serious person. Although irascible, he was the one who had the greatest dedication to his work, or else he wouldn’t be guarding at the mausoleum alone for a thousand years.

But after spending quite some time with Ye Mei and Ye Sha, Ye Gu had somehow uncovered the roguish side of him. But actually, Ye Sha and Ye Mei had also been going through a strange transmutation like this.

“Lord Jue, just now I...” Ye Gu was slightly nervous. As the leader of the Night Regime, he was the one who should be setting up an example for the others the most but...

“Tell me once again about all the things you know.” Jun Wu Yao frowned and said.

“Huh?” With his eyes widened, Ye Gu looked at Jun Wu Yao.

What were the things he knew? What should he say?

Ye Gu was confused.

After clearing his throat, Jun Wu Yao moved his sight aside and said. “The things about getting married. Something like proposing.”

This time, Ye Gu had finally gotten it!

Well, it was true that Ye Gu had understood what he meant but his expression became more awkward after that, whereas on the other side, Ye Sha and Ye Mei was trying hard to hold in their laughter. They had long gotten used to the peculiarity of Jun Wu Yao.

After all, Lord Jue had never been normal when it was about Young Miss.

Without having any other choice, all Ye Gu could do was just to bite the bullet and talk about the bits and pieces he knew about marriage. He couldn’t really remember the details and after he saw Jun Wu Yao stare at him with his eyebrows frowned, he began to panic and the way he spoke became even more confusing.

However, Jun Wu Yao did not notice his change. After finished listening to him quietly, he just ordered for the three of them to leave.

Ye Gu immediately ran away swiftly and escaped.

The moment Ye Sha and Ye Mei moved their legs, getting ready to leave, Jun Wu Yao called their names.

“Lord Jue?” Both of them kneeled on their single knees at once, waiting for Jun Wu Yao to speak. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With his eyebrows slightly frowned, Jun Wu Yao spoke after thinking for a long time. “Both of you go and...”

At the side yard, Jun Wu Xie was lying on the couch while having fun with Lord Meh Meh and Sacrificial Blood Rabbit. By comparing to the coldness she held not long before, there were more emotions on her white clean face now.

A row of people were seated neatly in the room.

Those people were Qiao Chu, Hua Yao and the list went on.

After experiencing the shocking thrills Jun Wu Xie brought to them, the few of them hesitated for quite some time before they came to find her.

It wasn’t their fault that they were being overly anxious. It was just that the things Jun Wu Xie did were so astounding that they still hadn’t recovered from the astonishment uptil now.

While being constantly stared at by number of eyes, without feeling any uneasiness, Jun Wu Xie was still sitting leisurely on the couch. Her fingers scratched gently on Lord Meh Meh’s stomach. She then moved to pinch the big ears of Sacrificial Blood Rabbit softly and also did not forget to stroke the hair of the black cat.

Qiao Chu and the others had come for a while but Jun Wu Xie seemed to not notice their purpose of visiting. She was just having fun with her cute creatures.

The few of them looked at each other, trying to convince the others to speak first and in the end, the one who was being pushed to make a start for the conversation was Qiao Chu.

“Little Xie, when are you going to... marry Big Brother Wu Yao?” Qiao Chu forced himself to look at Jun Wu Xie.

“Anytime.” Flatly, Jun Wu Xie said.

Qiao Chu wanted to cry.

Your casual attitude would make Big Brother Wu Yao cry!

“Cough... What is it again... You’re not going to prepare something?” Qiao Chu mentioned again.

“What do I need to prepare?” Jun Wu Xie sat up and looked at Qiao Chu with a confused expression on her face.

Qiao Chu wiped his face. Hmm, as expected, she knew nothing.

“You might not have to care about the others but... doesn’t the bride needs to make her own wedding dress?” replied Qiao Chu.

Jun Wu Xie showed him an expression, seemingly to asked him what the hell is a wedding dress.

Qiao Chu really wanted to cry. All he could do was just to poke Hua Yao who was sitting aside softly.

“Brother Hua, otherwise, you tell her?”

“Why?” Hua Yao was puzzled.
