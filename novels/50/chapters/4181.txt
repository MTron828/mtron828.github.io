Chapter 2777: Gu Ying’s thoughts (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Bai Zhu and team returned to White Night City. He returned back to his manor by himself. When he just opened the door, he saw a figure sitting on the main seat. When Bai Zhu saw the man, he was stunned. But after regaining his consciousness, he stepped forward and kneel down on one knee.

The person sitting in front of Bai Zhu was actually Gu Ying!

Gu Ying smiled, looking at Bai Zhu kneeling in front of him. He smiled at Bai Zhu with his curved eyes. He raised his hand slightly, and said casually: “Get up, take a seat first.”

Bai Zhu stood up tremblingly, then retreated to the nearest chair and sat down.

“How was the Banquet of Heroes?” Gu Ying raised an eyebrow at Bai Zhu.

Bai Zhu’s heart was slightly shaken. But he did not express his fright. Dealing with Jun Wu Xie was much easier compared to Gu Ying. He had a kind of intimidation that inevitably oozed out from his bones. No one had thought that Bai Zhu and Gu Ying knew each other. Although Gu Ying’s appearance was a surprise, he had anticipated it.

“The Sea Spirit City Lord has a big appetite and wants to conquer the entire 72 cities. Now the emotions of the City Lords are very agitated.” Bai Zhu said.

“Oh? He wants to take over the entire 72 cities?” A glint flashed by Gu Ying’s eyes before he continued. “I heard that the City Lord of Sea Spirit City is very decisive. But I didn’t expect it to be so crazy. But I like this lunatic. The 72 cities have been peaceful for too long and have been under control by the Top Ten Experts for so many years. To have a great City Lord like you to kneel and bow to the Top Ten Experts, don’t you feel grieved?

Bai Zhu was silent.

Gu Ying chuckled and said, “The City Lord of Sea Spirit City is indeed interesting. But dealing with the joint attack of the 72 cities will not be easy at all.”

Bai Zhu heard some meaning in Gu Ying’s words. He suddenly asked, “Your Highness, do you mean you want to render your help?”

No one knows that Bai Zhu and Gu Ying have been in contact since several years ago. Although Bai Zhu battled with Nangong Yan, he was regarded as the most ambitious and smartest City Lord among the 72 cities. He knew it very well that if he wishes to take over all the cities, solely relying on them was not enough. Even the other four City Lords who are now collaborating White Night City have their own thoughts. However, there was a common enemy before them that they will need to temporarily cooperate. Once the Flame City was repelled, the next thing Bai Zhu would face was the betrayal of the former ally.

Therefore, Bai Zhu already took action earlier. Blazing Flame City had a Nangong Yan and Bai Zhu had secretly contacted Luo Qingcheng, one of the Top Ten Experts. Now they were waiting for the decisive battle so he could use Luo Qingcheng’s power.

But who knows, there was an accident in the middle of it!

Bai Zhu did not take the initiative to make friends with Gu Ying, but he dropped by his mansion on his own. Gu Ying had a special identity. Bai Zhu naturally had no reason to refuse such an ally.

Just...

Gu Ying’s bad temperament made the self-confident and intelligent Bai Zhu elusive and afraid.

Previously, Gu Ying sent people to the Banquet of Heroes. Bai Zhu vaguely realized that Gu Ying was interested in Jun Wu Xie. Now, the Banquet of Heroes had just ended, Gu Xin Yan had not yet returned home yet, but he had already taken the initiative and came to Bai Zhu. This made Bai Zhu a little confused.
