Chapter 1073: “Lure the Tiger Away from the Mountain (1)”

In the next few days, Qu Xin Rui did not send anyone to go invite Jun Xie over and Jun Wu Xie was able to enjoy a few days’ peace.

This day, Jun Wu Xie woke up bright and early and she received news that Qing Yu brought in to her.

“Young Master Jun, the Grand Chieftain would like to invite you to make a trip to the Grand Chieftain’s Residence. He said he has something he wants to discuss with you about.” Qing Yu said as he stood in front of the door to Jun Xie’s room, but not daring to take a single step inside, as in that room at that moment, a great demon lord sat.

Jun Wu Xie was smoothing out Lord Meh Meh’s wool and suddenly hearing Qing Yu’s words, she lifted her head and asked: “Qu Wen Hao?”

“That’s right.” Qing Yu nodded.

Jun Wu Xie could not help but creased her brows. Although she had privately established an agreement with Qu Wen Hao, but all their conveyance of information and news were only done through Qu Ling Yue and Xiong Ba. Besides that day at the birthday banquet, she had never directly communicated with Qu Wen Hao and all that was done to avoid Qu Xin Rui from becoming suspicious.

That was a point that she knew well, and Qu Wen Hao as well.

But today, Qu Wen Hao had suddenly extended an invitation to her and it was after she had rejected Qu Xin Rui, which made Jun Wu Xie can’t help it but to feel that it was all rather strange.

“Is it mentioned what this is about?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Qing Yu shook his head. “It was not mentioned, but I was told that it was about something important and he needs to speak to you personally.”

Jun Wu Yao had his chin rested in his upturned palm as he looked at Jun Wu Xie. In regards to the situation in the Thousand Beast City, he had gained a better understanding of everything in the past few days.

“Going?” He asked.

Jun Wu Xie was silent a moment before she nodded her head.

Qu Wen Hao’s invitation was definitely strange but she still had to go find out what it was.

“I”ll go with you.” Jun Wu Yao stood up gracefully. When Qing Yu at the door saw Jun Wu Yao stood up, he was so shocked that he fell back two steps. In the past few days, Jun Wu Yao had not shown up much within the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall but every time that he saw Jun Wu Yao, Qing Yu would always be so terrified to become like a terrified little chick. Xiong Ba had simply decided that he would not even take a single step into this courtyard himself, wishing that he would never ever have to see that devilish demonic lord ever again.

“Alright.” Jun Wu Xie nodded.

Qing Yu then hastily retreated.

Jun Wu Yao saw the room door close before he said: “It’s Qu Xin Rui’s doing?”

Jun Wu Xie put Lord Meh Meh on the floor and then said slowly: “Qu Wen Hao would not initiate such direct contact with me as that would only cause Qu Xin Rui to be alerted. I had just refused Qu Xin Rui’s invitation a few days ago and although things have been calm and uneventful since, I’m thinking there’s still trickery up her sleeve. Today’s invitation must be the work of Qu Xin Rui.”

“If someone is seeking her own path to death, I wouldn’t mind granting her wish.” Jun Wu Yao said as a smile slowly blossomed at the ends his mouth. He had promised Jun Wu Xie that he would not interfere with this but if Qu Xin Rui was in such a hurry to seek her death, he thought it wouldn’t be nice for him to refuse her.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Jun Wu Yao, but did not comment. They tidied up a little and went out the door.

The guards sent from the Grand Chieftain’s Residence were waiting outside the doors of the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall. Jun Wu Xie carried the little black cat in her arms and left with the guards with Jun Wu Yao beside her.

Xiong Ba waited till the figures of Jun Xie and Jun Wu Yao had completely disappeared from before the doors of the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall before he came out sneakily from inside.

Qing Yu was speechless as he looked at his own Clan Chief, the look on his face showing contempt for the cowardly act.

“Why is the Grand Chieftain suddenly looking for Young Master Jun?” Xiong Ba was feeling rather puzzled. If the person who brought the news to them was not Qu Wen Hao’s trusted aide, he really would have assumed that it was just a fake information that Qu Xin Rui had ordered people to come give them.

Qing Yu couldn’t understand the rationale behind it as well.

Just as the two of them were still cracking their heads over it, a towering figure suddenly came to the main doors of the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall.
