The words that Jun Xian had said then had recovered the situation that was about to collapse. His words had spurred on their spirits and the entire Rui Lin Army have been thoroughly motivated, as if revitalized, their grandeur was even more imposing than the past. At that moment on, the entire Lower Realm had mobilized all their forces and integrated under the leadership of Qu Ling Yue. They had undergone rigorous training and had been cultivating at a crazy speed. The Rui Lin Army had been sent in large batches to the Middle Realm to pay attention to the movements in the Middle Realm.

“In just two more days, it will be time for the Young Master Qiao Chu and his companions to come out of seclusion. At that time, I would need to head back to the Lower Realm for a while. The rest of you are to keep observing the movements of the Middle Realm. If there is any abnormality, please send news back as soon as possible.” Gu Li Sheng said.

“Yes!”

After asking a few more questions and ascertaining the recent movements of the Middle Realm, Gu Li Sheng waved his hand and the men of the Rui Lin Army immediately dispersed.

In the half built Palace, that youth woke up in trepidation upon hearing the boisterous shouts from the supervisors. Everything that happened last night flashed by in his mind and that youth was worried about that young man. But when he got up, he saw that the young men that had disappeared last night stood amongst the crowd. Looking at him, it looked as if he had just woken up as well.

The youth blinked his eyes in disbelief, after he had determined that he was not hallucinating, that youth stood up and started to doubt if last night’s matter had even happened at all.

Last night, could it be that he was really dreaming?

The supervisors waved their whips and hurried them. The youth did not dare to delay any further and hurried on.

The complexion of the middle aged man from yesterday did not look too good. He was pale and his movements sluggish. Just as he walked under the scorching sun, cold sweat started to trickle down his forehead and his figure started to sway. Fortunately, that youth had noticed it and had quickly rushed to his side to support him.

“Uncle Liu!” When the youth touched the middle aged man, he felt that his body’s temperature was abnormally high and his face immediately revealed unprecedented anxiousness.

Uncle Liu swallowed some saliva but a wave of dizziness swept over him and he held the youth’s arm on one hand and barely stabilized his body.

“Uncle Liu, have you fallen sick?!” That youth asked anxiously, he had just came here for a short time and in the beginning, he had a hard time and had suffered many whiplashes. Thanks to Uncle Liu’s care, he had became familiar with everything quickly. Now that he saw that Uncle Liu had fallen sick, he was so anxious that he had almost cried out.

“Don’t say anything, I’m fine.” Uncle Liu shook his head and did not dare to show his discomfort. Over here, anyone found to be sick would not receive any treatment. All that awaited them was exile. Once the supervisors discovered that he had fallen sick, then he would not even be entitled to that bit of food and water but be directly thrown into the wilderness to survive on his own. He had been here for so long and he had seen countless companions die this way so even if he was sick, he did not dare to show it.

That youth gnashed his teeth, his eyes were filled with anxiousness but he knew that for Uncle Liu’s condition, all he could do was to endure it.

“You two over there, hurry up! Are your bodies filled with lazybones? Are you looking for a lashing?! Huh?!” When the supervisor at the side saw that the youth and Uncle Liu stood there without moving, he in that he went over and waved his long whip in his hand and lashed out without any mercy. That whip landed on that youth and Uncle Liu. That searing sensation immediately made them frown in pain.

Uncle Liu fell to the ground directly and his unwell body started to convulse the moment he fell.

“Uncle Liu!” That youth cried out and rushed to his side in a panic as he tried to support Uncle Liu.
