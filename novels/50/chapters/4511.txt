Chapter 3107 Finale 6

Victory had not brought joy, just a pervasive sadness.

The blood red mist was slowly starting to recede from the Three Realms and sunlight started to bathe the land in a fresh dawn.

However the sunlight brought no warmth to Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

Just as everyone was wallowing in sadness, a bright ray of light pierced through the sky and a figure surrounded by a golden aura appeared.

When they saw the figure, everyone was shaken out of their stupor.

Could it be that the God of Destruction was not dead?

When the figure walked out of the circle of light, everyone was stunned.

Out of the light appeared an extremely handsome man with golden eyes, smiling and looking warm and friendly.

“I guess a pathway has been opened.” The handsome man looked at the mess around him and sighed involuntarily.

“The destructive power here is on par with that brat, Satan’s.”

“Who are you?” Jun Gu asked the stranger while standing in front of his wife and daughter to shield them.

The man sensed Jun Gu’s apprehension and tried to wave him off, laughing, “Don’t be anxious, I am not a bad person. I’m here to look for her.” He pointed to Jun Wu Xie who was still within the embrace of Han Zi Fei.

Jun Gu frowned slightly and exchanged a look with Han Zi Fei.

Han Zi Fei took a step forward, “Just who are you exactly?”

The man laughed, “I am a God but not one of this world. I have transcended these worlds and am part of the God World. I am here at someone’s request but also to help Miss Wu Xie fulfill her destiny.”

“What do you mean?” Han Zi Fei stared cautiously at the person in front of her. If it was not for him not exhibiting even the slightest hostility, she would have really suspected that the person was there to cause trouble.

“I think....it might be more appropriate for me to talk to Wu Xie herself.” The man said with some difficulty.

Han Zi Fei hesitated a moment and released Jun Wu Xie from her embrace after exchanging a knowing look with Jun Gu.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were bloodshot from all the crying but was stunned when she saw the person in front of her.

“It’s been a while.” The man looked at Jun Wu Xie somewhat wistfully.

“It’s you?” Jun Wu Xie was stunned.

“Little Wu Xie, do you know him?” Han Zi Fei asked with caution. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie replied, “I can’t say that I do but I have seen him in a dream before.”

In the environment created by the Spirit Tree, other than Jun Wu Yao, there was a child. That child had golden eyes who always had a smile on his face unlike Jun Wu Yao. The face before her was as she remembered it albeit more mature.

Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu were not totally clear about what was going on but if Jun Wu Xie had met him before, then he was probably not an enemy.

“I’m so happy that you still remember me.” The man smiled and scratched the back of his head. “I have received many blessings from you but have not had the time to thank you. However we have many days ahead of us for that and for now, let’s talk about the matter at hand.”
