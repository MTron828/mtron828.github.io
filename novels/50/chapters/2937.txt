The two walked on the street one after the other. The bustling crowd suddenly disappeared. Rong Ruo paused her footsteps. She looked at the figure standing at one end of the street.

“Little Ruo?” Fei Yan’s mind was all on Rong Ruo’s body. He hadn’t noticed the previous situation. Suddenly, he saw Rong Ruo stopped and he couldn’t help being curious.

Rong Ruo turned around without giving Fei Yan any chance to speak. She grabbed Fei Yan’s hand.

Fei Yan’s face was flushed completely. A moment of joy just rose from his heart. Suddenly he found that Rong Ruo’s expression was very dignified. He pulled her toward the direction that he came from.

“Don’t talk, just go.” Rong Ruo deliberately lowered her voice and sounded in Fei Yan’s ears.

No matter how ignorant Fei Yan was, he realized the abnormality of the matter. He quickly turned his head and looked at the street behind him.

The street was empty. There’s only one figure standing at the entrance to the street. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The appearance of that person surprised Fei Yan!

It was a skinny man, and his sunken cheeks looked a little sick. At the thin corner of his lips, there was a creepy smile. The hollow and gloomy eyes looked straight at him and Rong Ruo.

Fang Jinghe! !!

In Fei Yan’s mind, the identity of that person quickly emerged.

Fang Jinghe, one of the Top Ten Experts, wasn’t the one they saw that day?

But how did he appear here?

Why did he look at him and Little Ruo with such dangerous eyes?

Fei Yan didn’t have time to think about it. He subconsciously sped up his steps, and backhandedly walked away with Rong Ruo. Regardless of why Fang Jinghe appeared here, his eyes only made Fei Yan feel very dangerous. Anxiety emerged from the bottom of his heart, as if a voice in his heart urged him to leave immediately.

Of course ...

Fei Yan and Rong Ruo failed to get out of that street.

Fang Jinghe, who was not far behind them, did not know when they appeared in front of him. He happened to block their only way!

Fei Yan was almost subconscious, defending Rong Ruo behind him. The smile on his face disappeared in no time. He attentively looked at Fang Jinghe. Every cell in his body seemed to be cold and exploded in the cold wind.

Fang Jinghe’s skinny face had a creepy and grinning smile on his face. His eyes looked like poisonous snakes, with a disgusting contempt. He looked up and down at Fei Yan and Rong Ruo.

“Please give way.” Fei Yan forced himself to calm down. The other party was one of the Top Ten Experts, not his ability to fight with. If he took the initiative, he and Rong Ruo would suffer.

Fang Jinghe raised his eyebrows slightly. He did not respond. He did not move away either.

Fei Yan took a deep breath and pulled Rong Ruo away from Fang Jinghe’s side.

However, Fang Jinghe stretched out his hand at this time and once again blocked their way.

“You two, aren’t you from the Sacred City?” Fang Jinghe narrowed his eyes and looked at Fei Yan and Rong Ruo with indignation.

“No.” said Fei Yan.

Fang Jinghe raised his chin slightly and said, “No wonder you don’t understand the rules well. Don’t you know that in the Sacred City, you have to bow down and greet when you see the Top Ten Experts?”

Fei Yan’s eyes shook slightly. Even if he had never been to the Sacred City before, he knew that Fang Jinghe’s words were sheer rumours!
