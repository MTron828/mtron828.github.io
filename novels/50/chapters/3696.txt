A mournful scream resounded in the vast city and countless birds flew away in fright. All the Gold Spirits turned pale as they saw Qiu Yun convulsing and rolling about the ground. None of them would ever have thought that in the Middle Realm, there would actually be such a terrible person that could easily let the powerful Qiu Yun fall into such a situation where living was worse than death.

Those purple inscriptions ran all the way from Qiu Yun’s neck to all over his body at a very fast speed. In his blood, it felt as though there were countless bugs tearing at his blood vessels and that boring pain made him scratch all over incessantly. His original rough skin had became frail and it was like a blister being burst open and through the thin skin, the blood vessels could be seen clearly. Qiu Yun scratched incessantly and his skin was like a fragile flap was easily torn as a smelly thick yellow liquid spurted out from his wound and everyone at the side could not help but retch.

Those Gold Spirits who had came from the Upper Realm had also worked for the Top Ten Experts before. Although the Spirit Ring was rare but it was not as if they had never seen one before. It was just that they had never seen this type of Spirit Ring that could attach itself to a human body and bring about the effect similar to that of poisoning.

It was better to be hacked and end one’s life than to suffer such torment. At this moment, they had already given up all hope to survive but were praying in their hearts... They would rather be turned into a chunks of meat by those vines than to let Jun Wu Xie’s Spirit Ring touch them!

Ye Sha stood by the side and the people of the Night Regime looked coldly at Jun Wu Xie tyrannizing the entire scene. There was no trace of mercy for Qiu Yun in their eyes, only a cruel death awaited for those who had the audacity to besmirch Jun Wu Yao!

Ye Sha’s gaze fell onto Jun Wu Xie and that lone cold back made his gaze turn complicated.

Young Miss had became strong. Strong enough to imbue fear into everyone, this was supposed to be a good thing but beneath it all was her closed heart.

The constant blood curdling screams spurred the nerves of everyone present. Let’s not mention those Gold Spirits, even those disciples from the Nine Temples began to choke and tremble. They had never seen such gruesome torture and Jun Wu Xie had easily made Qiu Yun fall into such a precarious situation where living was worse than death. Such an extreme method made everyone feel uneasy and absolutely horrified.

Su Jing Yan’s eyes widened as Jun Wu Xie’s figure was imprinted in his mind. It left a trace of terror that could not be erased. He knew that Jun Wu Xie was very strong, but her strength did not lie in her power but that incredible growth that no one could control. He could still remember that when he first met her, she was just but a Purple Spirit. But after slightly over a year had passed, when he met her for the second time, she had already stepped into the realm of the Silver Spirit. This time, after five years.... Jun Wu Xie’s growth was even more dazzling...

Spirit Ring...

That was actually a Spirit Ring! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

How did she achieve such a feat in five years? From the peak of a Silver Spirit to a Gold Spirit, and even condensing out a Spirit Ring?!

This was not something any ordinary person would even dare to think about!

Jun Wu Xie had used the span of five years and completed the path of cultivation and achieved what no one else could. Some had even spent five hundred years and could not attain results close to this.

She... was she even human??!

Even if it was Su Jing Yan, he was no longer sure that the one that stood before him was a person or a monster!
