“Little Xie’s method is just too Heaven defying, I almost could not bear to stop.” Qiao Chu said as he stretched out his legs, looking still unfulfilled, as he had become obsessed with the feeling of sensing the surge of strong power of the spirit entering his body.

He had a feeling that if he was given a few more months’ time, he would be able to reach a level in the Spirit World that was as high as a Purple Spirit outside.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the exhilarated Qiao Chu, and then slowly lowered her eyes. The discovery she made in the fourth Serene Spirit Tower had brought her a result that went far beyond her expectations, never having thought that Spirit Reinforcement could really be applied onto accelerating the growth of one’s power of the spirit. But there was a limit to that kind of advancement where once one reached a certain level of power, the speed becomes much slower.

Being almost as good as a new spirit, to Qiao Chu and the companions, using Spirit Reinforcement to commence on their initial stages of cultivation, it was as if they were taking a rocket. But as the accumulated power of the spirit grew more and more in their bodies the speed of growth in their cultivation then slowed down.

Jun Wu Xie was guessing that was due to the limits that their souls were able to withstand that brought about the change.

The Spirit Reinforcement runes in the Serene Spirit Tower would completely ignore the fact whether a spirit soul would be able to withstand that much power, but continue to forcibly imbue them with more power of the spirit, till the spirit soul was unable to withstand it and went on to burst and explode, to then be absorbed by the twelfth level’s Spirit Fire. After Jun Wu Xie’s modifications, that Spirit Reinforcement runes no longer had the power to forcibly infuse a spirit with power of the spirit, but allow the spirit to passively absorb it. Although it placed a limit on the amount of power that could be absorbed, it made it much safer. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At least throughout the half year that they had been cultivating, Qiao Chu and the companions had not felt the slightest bit of discomfort, but have instead felt very much more invigorated.

“I heard Little Xie say that you want to go to the first Serene Spirit Tower. When are you going to do that?” Fei Yan asked curiously. Before they had even restarted on their cultivation, Jun Wu Xie had already planned and prepared to go into the first Serene Spirit Tower to wreck destruction, so that Little Black would be able to recover, but in the entire half year that they had been here in the Tranquil Dream Forest, they had not seen Jun Wu Xie show any inclination of doing that.

“Very soon.” Jun Wu Xie said expressionlessly, her mind seemingly rather distracted. She had a hand held over her chest, her brows slightly furrowed. Over the past half a year, the progress of her cultivation had been extremely fast, and she had not felt any discomfort throughout. Jun Wu Yao often came to the Tranquil Dream Forest to accompany her while she cultivated, and Little Lotus and Poppy came occasionally as well, bringing her updates on any news of Jun Gu.

Having searched for a good half year, Little Lotus and Poppy had seen every single spirit that appeared outside the three Serene Spirit Towers but they still had not seen any spirit that looked similar to Jun Gu, the news causing Jun Wu Xie to feel a tinge of despair.

The time that Jun Wu would have come to the Spirit World would not have been that long ago as ten years’ time in the Spirit World was as fleeting as a snap of one’s fingers.

Jun Wu Xie then could not help but start to think whether Jun Gu had already gone to the Serene Spirit Tower and have his spirit soul sacrificed to the Spirit Fire. That was an answer that only Wu Jiu would be able to provide as all spirit that had attained extremely high powers in the Serene Spirit Tower and were absorbed by the Spirit Fire would have gained Wu Jiu’s favour before they were absorbed, becoming Wu Jiu’s direct disciple. To know whether Jun Gu had been sacrificed, Wu Jiu was the only person Jun Wu Xie could ask.

“Little Xie? What is on your mind? You look like you have a lot on your mind.” Qiao Chu asked when he saw Jun Wu Xie’s perturbed face, and he could not help but to wave his hand before Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

Jun Wu Xie snapped back to her senses and shook her head slightly to say: “It’s nothing. Just that there is a strange feeling in my chest.”
