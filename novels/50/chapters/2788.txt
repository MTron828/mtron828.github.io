Fear spread quickly in the army with force of a prairie fire, bloody taste became stronger and thicker. The shadow of death shrouded everyone’s head.

“You ... what are you still afraid of ... We have more than two million troops, are we afraid of dying after two people are dead?!” A general screamed in extreme fear as he was afraid of himself being heard and obliterated by Jun Wu Xie. He immediately dispatched several teams of soldiers to protect himself.

“That’s right, he is all by himself. Even if she kills, there’s a limit to it! Everyone, rush up together! Let’s see if he can really multitask and kill us all!” Another general also shouted.

When they arrived, a military order had been issued by the City Lords. If the Sea Spirit City could not be destroyed, they would be dead even if they returned.

It was expected to be an extremely simple and overwhelming battle. However, the heart of the military had been disturbed by the two generals killed by Jun Wu Xie before the battle started. If this continues, they would not have a chance to fight and they had to accept the military death order for their survival during the battle.

There were shadows of death on both sides, and the generals would rather fight here in the actual battle.

They were scared by Jun Wu Xie, but they had not completely lost their minds. They knew that Jun Wu Xie was powerful, however, they had not forgotten their own advantages in this battle.

The two million troops behind them were their last chips.

“Give your best shot!” The generals of the cities seemed to have the same consensus. Dealing with Jun Wu Xie was so difficult. If they were to wait for the whole army of the Sea Spirit City to leave its city for the battle, there would be a lot of uncertainties. It would be better to take advantage of this chance where Jun Wu Xie was arrogant to fight alone. This was the best opportunity to take it down first!

A roar echoed from the 72 cities armies. The terrified and pale-faced soldiers were awakened from the roar of their generals. Everyone raised their spiritual power and whistled towards Jun Wu Xie.

On the city wall, Qiao Chu and others watched Jun Wu Xie standing alone outside the gate of the Sea Spirit City. A hundred meters away, an entire army was running towards her in a sweeping force.

Qiao Chu’s fists were clenched tightly to the extent of them bleeding. He tried to rush down a few times, but was pressed back by the words of Hua Yao. But his bloodshot eyes stared at Jun Wu Xie. Every part of him was ready for battle.

Although Hua Yao and others couldn’t guess a clue from the expressions. They could already guess that the spiritual power emanating from them was ready to support Jun Wu Xie like Qiao Chu.

Standing on the side, Nangong Lie looked at Qiao Chu and others in amazement. With his strength, he could clearly detect Qiao Chu’s level of spiritual power. Among them, the strongest just entered into the cohesive spirit level were not expert levels. But for no reason, Nangong Lie felt that the concentration of spiritual power in Qiao Chu and the rest of them were much stronger than that of normal people. This meant that their spiritual power could bring damages that were far higher than the level they belong to!

These guys were not ordinary characters!

Nangong Lie trembled slightly. Jun Wu Xie was the strongest among all. None of these people had great potential like Jun Wu Xie!
