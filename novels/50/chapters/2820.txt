Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Han Shu stepped into the study. The rows of bookshelves in the entire study were filled with old books. With the many years that had passed, the books could only be preserved in the cold environment of the Holy Mountain, and therefore were still intact. But upon closer observation, each of those books seemed to have been read countless times, the cornes were a little frayed.

The book here, Han Zi Fei had already flipped through countless times. During the time that she spent in the Sacred Maiden Tribe, she had always kept herself in the study, accompanied by these books.

Han Shu didn’t understand this hobby of Han Zi Fei. This study was just a decoration for the first two Sacred Maidens. It wasn’t until the appearance of Han Zi Fei, that the studies were really used. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Han Zi Fei was a freak. But to the entire Sacred Maiden Tribe, she was a maverick.

She was apparently the most honored Sacred Maiden, but she chose to defect, to abandon all her superior lifestyle, to abandon His Lord’s favour. She survived on the outside on her own for thousands of years but yet she finally returned.

Han Shu and Han Zi Fei were similar in age, and they had more or less grown up together. It was not until their teens that Han Zi Fei was identified as the third Sacred Maiden. It was then that Han Shu truly realised the gap between her and Han Zi Fei.

That was the gap that she, no matter what, could not close.

“Please, sit.” Han Zi Fei raised her eyes and saw a very rigid Han Han standing by the door, a smile twitched on her lips.

Han Shu lost focus for a moment, and then sat down on the chair. No matter how much she didn’t want to admit it, as long as she stood in front of Han Zi Fei, she could not help but felt a strong sense of inferiority.

“Yes ... Elder Yun asked me to look for you.” Han Shu took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down.

“Oh? What’s wrong with Elder Yun?” Han Zi Fei raised an eyebrow and asked.

“Elder Duan and I came back this time with some guests. Elder Duan is going to host a banquet to entertain those guests, so you need to attend tonight.” Han Shu said.

“Me?” Han Zi Fei laughed suddenly. “What has the guests of the Sacred Maiden Tribe to do with me? I only remember that in a few days’ time, I will marry Lord Gu. Why do I need to see other guests? Is this how the Sacred Maiden Tribe use their Sacred Maiden?”

Han Shu’s expression stiffened, as she felt stumped by Han Zi Fei’s poisonous tongue.

This woman looked gentle and spoke softly, but she occasionally had a poisonous tongue and would say things that made people speechless.

“What kind of guest is able to make Elder Duan and Elder Yun put in so much effort and go through so much trouble?” Han Zi Fei held her chin with one hand, and squinted at Han Shu.

Han Shu was irritated by Han Zi Fei’s stare, and she could only glanced away and said, “Naturally it is someone special. You just need to show up. If you don’t want to attend, go tell the two Elders yourself!”

“You hate me?” Han Zi Fei said suddenly.

Han Shu was shocked as she looked at Han Zi Fei in disbelief. She simply could believe what Han Zi Gei was talking about!

Han Zi Fei’s smile grew even deeper. “To be precise, you hated me since you were a child. You haven’t changed at all, my little sister.”

Han Shu’s face turned an ugly shade of purple as she death glared at Han Zi Fei.

“It’s a pity that no matter how much you hate me, you can’t kill me, you can only stare at me with such a mean look.” Han Zi Fei said with a smile.
