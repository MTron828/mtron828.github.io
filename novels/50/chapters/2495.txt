The man seemed to notice their caution and raised his hands with the fingers wrapped in the leather gloves stretched out, in a gesture to signal to Hua Yao and the others that he had no malicious intent.

“I don’t have bad intentions, I just want to help her.” A gentle female voice drifted from behind the mask.

Hua Yao and the others did not take her word for it and continued to look at her with suspicion.

“Her Soul Power and Spirit Power are in conflict with each other, if we don’t remove the obstructions fast, it will inflict severe damage to her. I am not your enemy, I do not have any ill intentions towards you.” The mysterious woman spoke, her voice was mild but it didn’t contain any feminine suppleness, instead she sounded somewhat heroic.

“Who are you?” Jun Wu Yao spoke up at this moment. With Jun Wu Xie resisting his help, he could not do anything.

That person looked at Jun Wu Yao who had spoken and let out a breath saying, “Ye Jue, I know of you. You might not know me, but we have one thing in common, we are enemies of the Upper Realm. If you believe me, I can help you.”

“Who exactly are you?” Jun Wu Yao lowered his voice. How did this person know him?

The enemy of the Upper Realm.

The lady saw that Jun Wu Yao belatedly refused to lower his guard, therefore she took out a silvery white ring from her waist.

Jun Wu Yao’s gaze came up on the ring and there was a slight change in him.

“Sacred Woman Clan?”

“Yes!” said the woman.

“The pureblood Sacred Maiden who escaped the Upper Realm a thousand years ago?” Jun Wu Yao suddenly asked. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

That person was stunned, and after keeping silent for a moment, smiled bitterly and said, “It is me.”

“Let her come.” Jun Wu Yao said.

Hua Yao and the rest were surprised since they did not know who this person was but yet, Jun Wu Yao accepted her identity.

Jun Wu Yao even believed her, so they naturally did not obstruct her further.

That person let out a breath silently as she approached Jun Wu Xie’s figure. Rong Ruo looked at her curiously.

Pale blue mask hid her features, only revealing a pair of calm and beautiful eyes. Although no one knew how she looked like but based on this pair of eyes, it was not hard to guess that the person’s appearance would be refined.

Jun Wu Yao nodded slightly to Rong Ruo, and only then did she release her hand from Jun Wu Xie and took a step back.

“How did you know her condition?” Jun Wu Yao watched the other person cautiously.

The person spoke, “Because she isn’t the first person who suffers from conflicting powers. If I didn’t have the cultivation of the Soul World, how did Lord Jue think I manage to escape the Upper Realm at that time?”

There was a slight surprise in the eyes of Jun Wu Yao.

Unexpectedly, this person actually chose the same method as Little Xie.

The person no longer said anything more and just observed the condition of Jun Wu Xie. She then took out a bottle of medicine from a dilapidated cosmos sack.

“Open her mouth.”

“What is that?” Jun Wu Yao asked.

“The spirit nucleus of Sea Spirit Beast, it can relieve the agitation caused by the clash of the powers.”

“You can obtain the spirit nucleus?” Jun Wu Yao stared into the person’s eyes.

“There is no time to explain. If you don’t believe then...” that person raised her mask and poured the medicine into her mouth and drank it. With her mask back in place, she looked at Jun Wu Yao seriously.

“Open Little Xie’s mouth.” Jun Wu Yao instructed Rong Ruo.

Rong Ruo immediately stepped forward, and as gently as possible, pried opened Jun Wu Xie’s tightly sealed mouth, and the person immediately poured the medicine into her mouth.
