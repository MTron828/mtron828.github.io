“I have already discovered the issue with Meng Qiu, but I just didn’t think that he would be used by the Upper Realm. I let you take the seed away, in order to maintain the ‘bloodline’, and it was also for the one beside you.” The Spirit Tree looked at Jun Wu Xie, its eyes were unusually gentle, with a smile on the corner of its mouth.

“Me?” Jun Wu Xie felt a little bit strange, “How do you know that Jun Wu Yao will meet me?”

The encounter between her and Jun Wu Yao was an accident. Moreover, she was not a soul of this world, but she was born again and took up her current shell.

When Jun Wu Yao left the Upper Realm, she did not exist in this world at all. Yet, the Spirit Tree said that it was for her?

The Spirit Tree smiled and said: “All things in the world are predestined, I know that you will eventually meet.”

Jun Wu Xie cast a glance at Jun Wu Yao, she felt that what the Spirit Tree said was very strange.

“How did you know?” Jun Wu Yao frowned.

The Spirit Tree replied: “Did you not just see the past that belongs to both of you.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The words of the Spirit Tree made the hearts of Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie trembled slightly. They all knew that the Spirit Tree was referring to the illusions and realistic dreamscape. What Jun Wu Xie thought was right, that dreamscape was what the Spirit Tree wanted them to see.

“I don’t think that those things hold any meaning for us.” Jun Wu Yao said coldly. How was the past related to their present?

“It doesn’t make much sense, but amidst everything, you would still have met. You are not souls of this world, but you are sent here by the power of another world. Have you ever thought about the reason?” The Spirit Tree spoke, neither too fast nor slow.

“Even if you don’t want to think about it, it did happen before. The Upper Realm want the souls from the outside world to activate the Blood Sacrifice Array, smash the void into pieces; if is not you, then it is her. The beings of the Three Realms are innocent, although I don’t dare affect cause and effect in the world, but I can give it a push. Ye Jue, I know why you are returning to the Upper Realm. But I want to tell you that what you know is not everything. The Upper Realm cooperating with Meng Qiu to capture the Soul World is not just for the occupation of this piece of land.”

“What do you know about it?” Jun Wu Yao perceived that the Spirit Tree knew much more than him.

The Spirit Tree was not supposed to intervene in anything in the Three Realms. It existed as a nurturer of souls for the Three Realms. It was a creator; the creator of this world’s souls, but in a sense, it was also a bystander; unable to control the changes in the Three Realms and could only exist in this Soul World.

“Some things, I can’t say, but you can find clues on your own. I can only tell you now that the enemies you will face, only you can resolve. If you like this world, then you should guard and protect it with your heart, and it will bring you unexpected returns.” When the Spirit Tree finished speaking, the figure gradually faded, turning into a body of blue smoke and melting into the body behind.

“In the Soul World, your enemies have not left yet. The Blood Sacrifice Array, apart from the spell casting, can be casted with 999,000 souls with the sacrifice of a million souls. Even if the souls of the outside world and the soul bones which escape to the ends of the earth, as long as they are still within the Three Realms, the Blood Sacrifice Array can still be carried out. This is the only thing I can tell you... The rest must be discovered by yourselves...” The Spirit Tree eventually returned to its body, the human form dissipated and the golden light which was suspended in the air, slowly floated towards Jun Wu Xie.
