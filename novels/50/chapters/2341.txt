Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie returned to the room which she had not been to for a long time. Everything in the room was how she left it, nothing seemed to have changed at all. The table and chairs were wiped clean, the items on the table were obviously new, but it looked exactly the same as the teapot she used in the past.

Jun Xian waited for her for a long time, every day, he would think about whether or not she would return that very day. He refused to let his granddaughter suffer any bit of grievance, to the extent that her room was cleaned regularly and the tea table and chairs were changed every three months, but there is no change in their appearance.

Three months and another three months passed like that, those things that had never been used were discarded because of Jun Xian’s stubbornness. He only wanted to give her the best and the things that she was most familiar with. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Sitting on the soft bed, Jun Wu Xie was deep in thought as she reminisced about the past. In just but a moment, she had returned back to a few years ago, at the time where everything had not happened yet. It was as if she looked up, she could still see that person with that charming sly smile, standing in front of her door, looking at her affectionately with a smile.

Creak...

The door was suddenly pushed open, and Jun Wu Xie subconsciously raised her head. What appeared before her was not that person in her dream, but the black beast who came in with Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit.

A figure paused in front of her door, but left after the door was pushed open. Jun Wu Xie knew that it was Su Ya...

This pair of Master and disciple had a deep level of mutual understanding. Su Ya understood the pain of Jun Wu Xie and likewise, Jun Wu Xie knew Su Ya’s sadness.

“Master Su Ya sent us here and left immediately after.” The black beast walked to her side as it rubbed itself affectionately against her knees while Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit brushed their claws on the rug before jumping up onto the bed and lay down beside her.

“I know.” Jun Wu Xie replied softly, some things could not be resolved by others. And she was the same as Su Ya.

Jun Wu Yao was still alive, even though he had lost his freedom, Jun Wu Xie was confident that she would certainly save him.

But Yan Bu Gui...

Yan Bu Gui had died while trying to save Su Ya. When the Spirit Jade Palace Lord rescued Su Ya, she was found beneath him. By then, his body was already a bloodied mess.... And after hearing it from Qiao Chu and the others, Jun Wu Xie came to know that Yan Bu Gui had died... and they had tried to find Yan Bu Gui and Ren Huang in the Spirit World, but they came back with disappointing results.

Jun Wu Yao and her, although separated, they were both were still alive. But Su Ya and Yan Bu Gui were separated by death...

“In the future, when I head over to the Upper Realm, I will go to the Soul World and have a look.” Jun Wu Xie slowly stroked the luxurious fur of the black beast. The Spirit Lord had once said that some heroic spirits may enter the Soul World, although the possibility was very slim, but it was not completely impossible.

As long as there was a glimmer of hope, Jun Wu Xie will never give up.

Just as she was thinking about it, suddenly, the back of her hands were covered with bulging blue veins. Her blood vessels seem to be propped up by a powerful force, spreading directly along her hand to her arm!

For a moment, Jun Wu Xie’s face had completely turned into a shade of white. Even for her who had a steel willpower and a high threshold of pain, she was already trembling and gritting her teeth painfully. Cold sweat continued oozing out of her body. She could only shrink her shoulders and forcibly endure the excruciating pain that was tearing her apart!

Jun Wu Xie fell straight down on the bed, her small body was in so much pain that she curled into a ball. The expression of the black beast by her side changed greatly, while Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit were panicked and worried.

Suddenly, the figure of Qin Song was seen dashing into the room and he immediately pulled her up and looked at her hands that were full of blue veins. When he saw what condition her hands were in, his brows furrowed deeply.
