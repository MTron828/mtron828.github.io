Chapter 2797: Duan Qi (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The army of 72 cities assembled more than two million people and attacked the Sea Spirit City. They ended up defeated. More than two million soldiers fled with their tails.

In White Night City, Bai Zhu had not received any news. He sat in the backyard of the City Lord’s manor.

As the largest city among the 72 cities, the White Night City’s manor was beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The huge backyard was full of flowers, pavilions and clear water around the rockery.

It was noon that Bai Zhu was sitting in the pavilion with a gentle smile on his face. But opposite him was a woman with a beautiful but slightly serious face.

“Aunt Duan, are you comfortable living here?” Bai Zhu said with a smile.

The woman sitting opposite Bai Zhu looked only twenty-seven, but she gave people a feeling of seniority. Her eyes seemed to contain vicissitudes, and her mouth drooped slightly, and she didn’t smile naturally. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Still alright.” Duan Qi said blankly.

Bai Zhu laughed with a smile on her face, but her heart was cramped.

After Gu Ying left that day, it was not long before Duan Qi came to White Night City. Gu Ying wanted Duan Qi to go to the Sea Spirit City as a reinforcement. But Bai Zhu felt it was a trivial matter. However, the return of the Sea Spirit City had created some fear of Jun Wu Xie’s potential. But after he thought calmly, he wondered how a troop of more than two million from the 72 cities could not even win a Sea Spirit City?

Even if there were two strong Spirit Ring men, Jun Wu Xie and Nangong Lie, they would not be able to stop the two million army.

Therefore, Bai Zhu kept Duan Qi in the house and hosted her well.

The status of The Sacred Maiden Tribe in the Upper Realm was very special. That was, the Lord had recognised their three past successive dynasties. Only few people could set their foot on the Holy Mountain where The Sacred Maiden Tribe was located. It was said that there were countless treasures on the Holy Mountain. The propagation of the maidens was also very unique. Only women were allowed to stay. When the maidens had reached the marriageable age, the senior maiden would select a group of talented men from the Upper Realm to have a happy child with the saint.

If a boy was born, he would be taken away by the father from the Holy Mountain., If it was a girl, she had to remain in the Holy Mountain.

It could be said that the entire Sacred Maiden Tribe was a very closed race. They might not have the supreme strong psychic force, but they have a strong spiritual power. Men who were selected by the Sacred Maiden Tribe were all famous and formidable in the Upper Three Realms.

Just like the men among the Top Ten Experts, most of them were selected by the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

Once invited by the Sacred Maiden Tribe, almost no one will refuse. It was better to give birth to a girl and stay in the Holy Mountain. If she were to give birth to a boy, he could inherit the strong psychic force from the saint.

Moreover, after agreeing to the request of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, the Sacred Maiden Tribe would also serve him, and this was what Bai Zhu wanted.

Bai Zhu wasn’t worried that Sea Spirit City could win. Under the two million army, Sea Spirit City and Jun Wu Xie would soon be destroyed. However, the period of contact with Duan Qi would be very important for Bai Zhu. With Duan Qi’s appreciation, perhaps he could have such an honor.

Therefore, Bai Zhu became more and more attentive in front of Duan Qi.

“How’s the battle ahead?” Duan Qi looked at Bai Zhu and asked.

“Some seniors are worried. They want to come to see how powerful the Sea Spirit City is, but they are not enough to reach the two million army. Your Highness invited you to come here for the sake of security. I don’t think it is necessary to invite Aunt Duan to participate in this battle. “Bai Zhu laughed.
