Chapter 2365: Stabilizing the Spirit (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The soul power absorbed through the cultivation of the Spirit Reinforcement was the pure energy coming from the Spirit World. But now, the energy that was flowing into Jun Wu Xie’s spirit was guided by the Spirit Lord. It seemed like those soul power had been slowing down their flowing pace consciously while waiting for her to regulate the power herself. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It was a complete silence in the underground palace. Standing aside, Qin Song and the others were watching the act of the Spirit Lord in amazement.

Long Jiu’s eyes widened even more, they were filled with astonishment.

Before that, he had never met the Spirit Lord. He also didn’t actually know how powerful the Spirit Lord was. But the method used by the Spirit Lord today was so magical and amazing. With the way he consumed his soul power to guide Jun Wu Xie, it contained high limits towards the strength of his soul power. Long Jiu had been watching for more than two hours but there was still no sign of the Spirit Lord being exhausted. At the moment, his perception towards the strength of the Spirit Lord came to a great change.

“Wow... The power of the Spirit Lord is really...” Strong!

Long Jiu couldn’t help but marvelled.

Qin Song who was standing beside him lowered his voice and said. “He was once the strongest spirit in the Soul World, otherwise how would the Spirit Tree feel relieved to let him leave alone? Though the Spirit World isn’t comparable to the Soul World, he built it himself with his soul power. The power he has isn’t something that you can imagine. But it seemed like quite a lot of his soul power had been used up in building the Spirit World. The power he had when he left the Soul World was even more than the amount he has now.”

There were full of admiration for the Spirit Lord in Qin Song’s word.

All the spirits that were transformed from the seeds of the Spirit Tree were very strong but among them, the Spirit Lord was the strongest. The Spirit Tree wasn’t able to move but it had its own consciousness. It cared and loved the spirits it created like they were its own children. If the Spirit Lord wasn’t strong enough, how would the Spirit Tree allow the Spirit Lord to leave its protection of the Soul World with ease?

Long Jiu nodded his head emotionally and stopped himself from simply speaking.

The assistance cultivation done by the Spirit Lord had gone through for a whole day. It was till the second day that he finally felt a bit uncomfortable. The moment he realized that there was something wrong regarding his condition, he gave Qin Song a look and Qin Song then immediately replaced him. Both the spirits cooperate so well with each other that the soul thread linking on Jun Wu Xie didn’t even break. The switching was totally perfect.

“Just keep going on using this method, her condition should be stabilized after ten more rounds.” The Spirit Lord looked a little pale, but he didn’t hurry himself to leave.

While looking at the good-looking Spirit Lord who was standing beside him, Long Jiu couldn’t stop his eyes from glancing at the tall and thin body of the Spirit Lord. Subconsciously, he swallowed his saliva.

For real though, this guy had always been hiding his light under a bushel.

The duration of Qin Song in assisting Jun Wu Xie’s cultivation was one or two hours shorter than the Spirit Lord, but it was still considered as quite a long time. Without talking much, Long Jiu took his place, feeling keen to try how long can he sustained.

Unfortunately, it had only been one day and one night, and Long Jiu already felt like the soul power inside his body wasn’t able to sustain any longer, causing him to exchange his position with Situ Heng.

However, when it was Situ Heng’s turn, Jun Wu Xie who was meditating noticed that the energy flowing into her body suddenly became vigorous. It was not as gentle as the previous one. Not like an auxiliary, but more of an invader. The only thing she could do was to quickly adjust the soul power in her body and made an effort to scatter the ferocious soul power which was rushing into her body to other parts of her spirit. This made Jun Wu Xie who had been persisting for five years to experience a huge pressure.

But one round was yet to come, she couldn’t stop or else everything would have been gone to waste. On the other hand, it will also cause more damage to her!
