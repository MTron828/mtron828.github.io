Zheng Weilong stood in a pool of blood and looked at Jun Wu Xie whose bloodstained hands looked elegant yet cold under the sunlight. There were no traces of blood on her clothes at all. The red blood seemed to tarnish her holiness but at the same time, it carried an eerie stride.

“What’s that argument about?” A cry came from Nangong Lie’s room. The closed door was slowly pushed opened. Zheng Weilong stared at Jun Wu Xie. Then she realised that Jun Wu Xie had left and was already walking towards the room.

The moment the door opened, Divine Doctor Lu, with a somber face, lifted his eyes to see a blood soaked land. Liu Yi and others were trying to please Nangong Lie not long ago. In a pool of blood, their heads and bodies lay severed, as had their breath.

When he saw the scene, his legs weakened instantly. He fell to the ground. He could not believe what he saw. Looking at the horrific scene before him, he knew that all the high profile earlier has gone.

In the room, the other doctors heard the sound and came by. When they came to the door and saw the bloody scene, their legs turned weak.

Of course, Jun Wu Xie had quietly approached the door. She ignored Divine Doctor Lu and the rest. She raised her hand slightly, and the Spirit Ring appeared from her palm. The doctors were almost scared to death.

Everything was quiet and thrilling at the same time.

In the room, Nangong Lie’s head was swollen and painful, but the pungent blood smell irritated his breath again and again. He strove to stand up and wanted to see what was happening outside. The moment he got up, the sight was enough to stop his breathing for a moment.

The murderer had come. Behind that person, all one could see was crimson blood, blooming like death flowers, exactly like what happened then in the Middle Realm!

“It’s you ... really is you ...” Nangong Lie was so shocked and almost fell off the soft couch.

Even though the person in front of him has changed her appearance, her breath didn’t change.

He knew it was her!

It must be her!

“Are you here to kill me? You are finally here ...” Nangong Lie whispered incoherently. Although he was alive, he had dreamt many times that he was killed by Jun Wu Xie. He always has a hunch that he will die in her hands.

“I won’t kill you, I have something to ask you.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Nangong Lie.

“What do you want to ask? Did you kill Luo Qingcheng and the rest? Are they dead?” Nangong Lie stared at Jun Wu Xie closely.

“No, they are still alive, and will live a long time.” Jun Wu Xie said lightly. There is no way that she would let Luo Qingcheng die so easily? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Now, it’s my turn to ask you.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly. There was another reason why she would let the Five City Coalition entered the city, and that was Nangong Lie!

Being one of the Top Ten Masters, he will definitely know more than the 72 Cities.

“What do you want to ask?” Nangong Lie feared Jun Wu Xie. The invisible frustration and humbleness made him unable to resist Jun Wu Xie at all. From deep within, his fighting spirit was completely obliterated.

“Among the Upper Realm, is there someone named Jun Gu?” Jun Wu Xie asked coldly.

Nangong Lie’s expression changed!
