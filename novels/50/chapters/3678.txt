Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Unable to catch hold of anyone from the Night Regime, the Rui Lin Army could only helplessly secretly observe the movements of the Night Regime. Over time, they had already figured out the actions of the Night Regime.

The main target of the Night Regime were those Palaces built by the Nine Temples, however, even those that were still being constructed had already been demolished by them over the past two days. Just as the Rui Lin Army had thought that they had missed that ‘golden opportunity’ to have a chance encounter with them, the Night Regime had already proceeded on to the next step in their plans.

The Night Regime had already shifted their target and their raids on the various branches of the Nine Temples began. Blood flowed like a river and the strangest thing that happened was that those that had died tragically under the hands of the Night Regime were all mainly Gold Spirits from the Upper Realm. The rest were those traitorous dogs that had defected and had became the lackeys of the Upper Realm.

Those that had survived the bloodbath were those disciples of the Nine Temples that had been forced to obey the Upper Realm. Not one of them had been hurt.

Such an obvious treatment could be seen by any ordinary person.

The Night Regime was obviously flushing out anyone from the Upper Realm!

The Rui Lin Army secretly applauded them, while they tried to track the Night Regime, all they wanted to was to find the opportunity to speak with the people of the Night Regime and check on the whereabouts of their Young Miss.

Such a scenario of chasing and fleeing the scene had on about for about half a month.

It wasn’t until a group of the Rui Lin Army that had been staking out at a branch of the Nine Temples had managed to catch the opportunity when the Night Regime carried out their bloodbath. In the midst of the massacre, a group of men from the Rui Lin Army were running towards the Night Regime with excitement.

After annihilating this branch of the Nine Temples, their hands were still stained with fresh blood and as they were preparing to leave, they saw a group of stalwart men dressed similarly in light armour rush towards them with happy smiles on their faces. This scene truly made those cold-blooded killers from the Night Regime stunned silly for a moment.

These people... Where did they come from?

Had they been overstimulated? Didn’t they see them carry out a massacre? Why were they beaming with smiles?

That smile made all the members of the Night Regime have goosebumps as they watched the smiling members of the Rui Lin Army approaching, they subconsciously raised the swords in their hands.

“Stop.” A cold voice resounded from within the Night Regime.

The people of the Night Regime immediately sheathed their swords and stood ramrod straight.

Ye Sha stepped out with a grim expression as he looked at that group of approaching men from the Rui Lin Army.

“Big Brother Ye Sha! You are Big Brother Ye Sha! We have met before in the Lower Realm, I am a vanguard of the Rui Lin Army!” Staking out here for more than half a month and finally having this chance to contact the Night Regime, that vanguard almost cried out.

Ye Sha did not say anything but looked coldly at the men before him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Big Brother Ye Sha, we don’t have any other meaning, we only want to ask if Young Miss.. Is she alright?” The vanguard was suppressing the excitement in his heart as he looked at Ye Sha with anticipation.

Over the past five years, everyone in the Rui Lin Army had been most concerned about Jun Wu Xie’s safety, they were willing to stay in the Middle Realm in the hope that they could one day welcome Jun Wu Xie and bring her home.

Ye Sha looked at the faces of the people of the Rui Lin Army that were filled with expectations. Suddenly, he lowered his gaze, turned around and said to the people of the Night Regime: “Go to the next destination.”

After that, he did not look back and left with the Night Regime.

Everyone in the Rui Lin Army were extremely anxious in their hearts but they could not catch up with the Night Regime and could only watch them leave further and further away.

For a moment, all of them stood there in a daze.

Ye Sha did not dare look back and could only let out a sigh helplessly.

Young Miss, she isn’t alright, but she’s not willing to let you all know...
