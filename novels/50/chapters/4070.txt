“What you said is true?” Ruan Zhongshan frowned slightly. If he didn’t know that Xu Zu didn’t have the courage to deceive him, he couldn’t believe the news from Sea Spirit City.

“It’s true! I have already said to that person, asking him to find a way to get the elixir in hand, and within one month, I will collect the medicine.” Xu Zu said.

Ruan Chongshan didn’t speak, his eyes held careful thoughts.

The entire being of the Sea Spirit Beast was a treasure trove. This was a well-known fact within the Upper Realm. In the early years, some people had indeed wanted to use the Sea Spirit Beasts to experiment with new things, but it was all very piecemeal. There were many rumors about the Sea Spirit Beasts from thousands of years ago. Among them, there was one saying that the Sea Spirit Beasts’ flesh and bone were used in medicine to achieve magical effects.

Expect this had just been a rumor for thousands of years. Although many people have tried, in the end, no one was able to get any real results.

Therefore, the Upper Realm had long abandoned the study of Sea Spirit Beasts. After reaching the strength of condensed spirit inscriptions, their degree of dependence on Sea Spirit Beasts gradually began to fade away. To seventy-two city masters, whether there was still a resource for the Sea Spirit Beasts was inconsequential. If condensing a Spirit Ring was achieved, then the Sea Spirit Beasts no longer held any meaning to them.

Because of this, regardless if it was His Lord or the top ten masters, they did not care about the resource of the Sea Spirit Beasts. Only the seventy-two cities, in order to strengthen their own powers, would attach so much importance to the Sea Spirit Beasts.

Seventy-two cities seemed to be on par, but everyone knew there were differences.

Apart from the city lords’ own strengths, the strengths of their people within the cities and the number of strong people also determine each city’s position within the seventy-two cities.

Therefore, a very strange phenomenon had appeared among the seventy-two cities. The city owner not only wanted to prevent the emergence of men who were stronger than himself, but he also hoped that the strength of the city residents would be improved.

One had to take precautions but also take risks, it was a subtle balancing act.

The need for Sea Spirit Beasts to boost the strength of a powerful person was becoming less of a concern. However, the news from Sea Spirit City had attracted much of Ruan Zhongshan’s attention.

Based on his current strength, as long as the other party had not reached the level of spiritual inscriptions, that person was not his opponent at all. If the Long Xuan City’s exponents could be more powerful yet still within his control, that would definitely be a good thing.

“Call the steward to come in.” Ruan Zhongshan suddenly said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xu Zuo was a little startled but did not dare to hesitate. He immediately went out and called the housekeeper in.

“How long can the reserve of Sea Spirit Beasts we have in the city last?” Ruan Chongshan looked at the housekeeper.

“It can last for up to a year and a half.”

Ruan Chongshan nodded with satisfaction, then looked at Xu Zu.

“I leave it to you to deal with things in Sea Spirit City. It’s best to get in touch with that person within one month.” If the Sea Spirit City can really use the Sea Spirit Beast to make the elixir, then, the sudden toughening attitude of Sea Spirit City could be explained, and ... this elixir would absolutely appeal to the seventy-two cities!

Although Long Xuan City was stronger than Sea Spirit City, it did not amount to much within the seventy-two cities.

If there was really that kind of medicine ...

Ruan Chongshan’s eyes narrowed slightly as he turned predatory towards the elixir.
