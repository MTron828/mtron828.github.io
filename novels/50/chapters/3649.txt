Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The shock and astonishment in his heart intertwined but Ren Huang did not have the opportunity to dwell on it. The situation in front of him no longer allowed him to waste any more time. Although Jun Wu Xie had injured Luo Qingcheng, however she herself was severely injured and was just a step away from death’s door. The Jun Wu Xie now was in a dire situation, she no longer had any strength left to evade, what more fighting back? Luo Qingcheng just needed to simply strike out and she would be able to take away Jun Wu Xie’s life!

Cold beads of sweat formed on Ren Huang’s forehead.

At that time, Luo Qingcheng was already glaring malevolently at Jun Wu Xie as she gnashed her teeth in rage. She could not stand the fact that she was actually hurt by such weak person, and she raised her hand furiously and threw the light sword towards Jun Wu Xie!

That light sword turned into a streak of light and flew towards Jun Wu Xie’s chest at an incredible speed!

Jun Wu Xie sucked in a deep breath with her eyes narrowed. She wanted to evade but she could not!

She could only silently wait for her impending death.

She was really...

Unreconciled!

Just as that streak of light was about to run through her chest, a slender figure suddenly rushed to the front and held her in a tight embrace. And it was at that moment, Jun Wu Xie felt a warm sensation.

At that critical moment, that light sword had ran through that person who had hugged her!

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes widened incredulously as she looked at the person who had suddenly hugged her.

The person who had blocked that sword for her turned out to be that masked girl who always stood by quietly. At this moment, her face was still covered with the mask and only a pair of pained eyes could be seen. That light sword had penetrated body from her back and the bloodstained sword tip pierced through her body. She had flung herself forward in an attempt to use her body as a shield; the tip of the sword was only less than half an inch away from Jun Wu Xie.

But it was also this less than half an inch that had saved Jun Wu Xie’s life!

Fresh crimson blood dyed the entire surroundings red, that pair of hands remained tightly fixed on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulders, her pair of eyes stared unwaveringly at Jun Wu Xie.

“Live.... you have to....live....” A weak and pained voice was heard and although her eyes were filled with tears, there was no hint of regret in them.

“Who... Who are you actually...?” Jun Wu Xie stared at the girl who had used her own life to block that sword for her.

That girl did not speak but used her bloodstained hands to take out a bottle as she mustered all her remaining strength to lift her hand up and stuffed a medicinal pill into Jun Wu Xie’s mouth.

Jun Wu Xie’s body suddenly trembled, she was very familiar with that pill that had just entered her mouth. It was just after they had descended Mount Fu Yao and she had instructed Ye Mei to distribute to all the injured Spirit Jade Palace disciples this medicinal pill. The quality of this medicinal pill was not bad, on that day that Jun Wu Xie had known the degree of difficulty in saving Su Ya, she had prepared all of the best medicinal pills along with her.

Although this particular medicinal pill was not enough for her to recover immediately, it was sufficient to keep her away from the risk of excessive blood loss and it was enough to save her life.

But... Why did this girl not eat the medicinal pill? She had been keeping it aside... for what reason?

That girl did not speak, with the light sword pierced through her body, every little movement inflicted great damage on her body and she knew clearly that she was close to death. She had hoped that Jun Wu Xie could live on.... Even if it was only a one in ten thousand chance, it was enough!

“Promise me... you must live...” Her voice sounded even weaker and Jun Wu Xie had noticed that the girl’s body had already been covered with various wounds. She had been severely injured even before she had flung herself forward to block that sword for her. With such serious injuries, how could she rushed forward at such a critical juncture and stop that fatal blow for Jun Wu Xie?Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
