“Brother Hua, we ...” Qiao Chu had been putting up with it as he watched those people who were about to rush up to Jun Wu Xie, he was so tense that the veins in his face and neck were bulging out.

Hua Yao’s brow furrowed as he took a step forward.

As Hua Yao and the others weren’t able to bear with it much longer, a slender figure appeared suddenly above the city wall.

“If you make a move now, Little Xie’s efforts will fail.” The familiar voice drifted into the ears of Qiao Chu and others as it gradually pulled them back to being rational.

Qiao Chu and others immediately turned around.

They didn’t even realise when Jun Wu Yao had appeared on the wall as they looked at his black clad body. Although Jun Wu Yao’s appearance was modified, no one could ignore that imposing manner he exuded. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Brother Wu Yao!” Qiao Chu exclaimed.

Jun Wu Yao stood on the city wall, watching Jun Wu Xie who was being gradually engulfed within the encirclement, but his eyes narrowed slightly with a faint trace of smile within them.

Nangong Lie was surprised at the sudden appearance of Jun Wu Yao. Even with his strength, he did not even notice the arrival of Jun Wu Yao, and even at this moment as Jun Wu Yao stood in front of him, and he could not feel the slightest breath of Jun Wu Yao.

Who exactly is this person?

Nangong Lie watched Jun Wu Yao stealthy. After being in Sea Spirit City for a time, he only knew that the man in front of him as Brother Wu Yao, which was how Qiao Chu and the others had addressed him, and that Jun Wu Xie and this man seemed to be husband and wife. As for his origins, Nangong Lie knew nothing about it. The only thing he knew was that Jun Wu Yao’s strength was far above himself!

“Brother Wu Yao, are you not going to lend a hand?” Qiao Chu said anxiously.

Jun Wu Xie was unwilling to risk the possibility of Jun Wu Yao revealing his actual identity. Therefore since they arrived in the Upper Realm, she never let Jun Wu Yao do anything.

Jun Wu Yao chuckled.

“These ants, how can they hurt her? Why should I lend a hand?”

Jun Wu Yao’s words momentarily stunned Qiao Chu and the others. That trust in Jun Wu Xie seemed to have penetrated deep into Jun Wu Yao’s bone marrow.

“Look at her, the power of Little Xie. This moment is the moment of true liberation. Don’t miss this wonderful scene.” Jun Wu Yao’s smiling voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

The moment he finished speaking, down below the Sea Spirit City wall, a bright light suddenly shone! !!

The army of the 72 cities rushed at Jun Wu Xie. Several angered generals rushed forward, thinking that they could take the opportunity to cut off Jun Wu Xie’s head in the melee, and then they would be famous!

However, just when they thought that Jun Wu Xie could not possibly turn the tide of battle...

Jun Wu Xie, who had been standing still all the time, suddenly moved!

The light sowrd that she held in her hand suddenly disappeared, a gleam of violet light was born in her left hand, while a more dazzling green light condensed in her right hand!

The two dazzling rays of light exploded in an instant, and a strong airstream rolled up wind around her within the radiu so a hundred meters as it disrupted the squawking army, along with their whining horses and wailing.

Those generals, who were blinded by the dazzling light, could only try to stabilize the mounts underneath them so that they would not let themselves fall off their horses!

Accompanying the chaotic movement, the two dazzling rays of light gradually gathered into a halo, and condensed into a pair of different colored spiritual rings in Jun Wu Xie’s hands!
