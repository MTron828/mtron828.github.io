Jun Wu Xue noticed the change in Jun Wu Yao and the ecstasy in her eyes went down a little, “What’s wrong? The Soul Ascending Alter... Is there anything wrong about it?”

Jun Wu Yao recovered from the shock and slightly shook his head.

“There’s nothing wrong with the place. It’s just that the Soul Ascending Altar is a place where the spirit envoy who has committed a serious crime in the Soul World is executed, but ever since the day the Soul World is established, the Soul Ascending Altar has never been used. Why... is your father there?” Without thinking much about the other things, Jun Wu Yao was just feeling a little weird about the fact that her father was there.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head. She knew nothing more. The Spirit Tree had only given her three words, “Soul Ascending Altar”, regarding the location of Jun Gu.

They could only asked Long Jiu and Qin Song if they wanted to know about the detailed situation of the Soul Ascending Altar. Although Jun Wu Yao had visited the Soul World many times, he always spent most of his time staying together with the Spirit Tree, and he rarely went to the other places in the Soul World.

Both of them walked out and saw Qin Song and Long Jiu standing outside, seemingly to be thinking of something. After they saw them coming, Long Jiu and Qin Song quickly stepped forwards and greeted them.

Although they were really curious about the conversations between the Spirit Tree and the couple, Qin Song and Long Jiu were sensible enough to not ask anything.

“Where’s the Soul Ascending Altar?” While looking at them, Jun Wu Xie asked.

“The Soul Ascending Altar?” Long Jiu and Qin Song looked at each other, not expecting that Jun Wu Xie would actually asked about the location of the Soul Ascending Altar.

To be honest, the Soul Ascending Altar was considered a forbidden area to all the spirit envoys in the Soul World. Except for those who were guarding there, it was rare for the spirit envoys to go to the Soul Ascending Altar.

“Why do you want to go to the Soul Ascending Altar? That... isn’t really a nice place for you to go.” Long Jiu scratched his head. Could it be that the Spirit Tree had told both Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao something about the Soul Ascending Altar?

“I want to go and find my father. The Spirit Tree said that my father is at the Soul Ascending Altar,” explained Jun Wu Xie.

Long Jiu and Qin Song were immediately enlightened. Before this when they left the Lower Realm, Jun Wu Xie had once asked them to help her find Jun Gu, Yan Bu Gui and Ren Huang in the Soul World. However, when they got back to the Soul World, the chaos had already happened and they didn’t have the time to look for them.

“If you guys want to go, we can bring you there,” said Qin Song. Now that Meng Qiu was dead, those black armored spirit envoys were just a flock of sheep without a shepherd leading them, and most importantly, the Contemporaneous Knot on the Spirit Tree had been removed. Those spirit envoys who were faithful to the Spirit Tree would no longer have to restrain themselves. In terms of numbers, the amount of the black armored spirit envoys was far behind Qin Song them.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. However, instead of hurrying to the Soul Ascending Altar, she went to the Soul Prison together with Qin Song and Long Jiu to free those spirit envoys who were locked up.

When the black armored spirit envoys who were guarding outside the Soul Prison noticed the appearance of Jun Wu Yao, they couldn’t even pluck up their courage to fight. There was no need for Jun Wu Yao to do anything as the black armored spirit envoys had just straight off fled from the place.

Even until the moment when those spirit envoys got out of the prison, they had still not realized the change in the Soul World. After Long Jiu told them everything, only then they came to an enlightenment that the Soul World had actually been extricated from Meng Qiu’s control!

“The Spirit Tree said that the enemy of the Soul World is still here. In my opinion, there might be people from the Upper Realm staying in the Soul World.” While looking at all the spirit envoys who had regained their freedom, Jun Wu Xie repeated the words that were said by the Spirit Tree to them.

However, there wasn’t any bits of nervousness seen from those spirit envoys at all. As long as the Spirit Tree had gotten rid of the Contemporaneous Knot, they had nothing to be afraid of.

Qin Song had sent part of the spirit envoys to the location of the Spirit Tree in order to protect its safety whereas the others had started a battle to hunt down all the traitors in the entire Soul World.
