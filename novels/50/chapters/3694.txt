Qiu Yun simply could not believe that his strength which was only after the Top Ten Experts in the Upper Realm would actually be restricted by these frail looking vines. But no matter how much spirit energy he used to attack, he could not break any of them!

How were these vines? These were clearly something monstrous that’s way more tenacious than the Soul Binding Chains!

“Did you think that with ten thousand people, I would have no way to deal with you?” Jun Wu Xie’s cold voice resounded out at this moment and the moment her voice was introduced into his ear, it was as if he had stepped into a nightmare and his body quaked!

He raised his gaze and looked at that silver figure which was slowly approaching him. His heart started to beat wildly, as if it would jump out of his throat the very next second. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Killing you, has always been.... a very simple thing.” Jun Wu Xie raised her gaze and slowly walked towards Qiu Yun. For each step she took, wherever her figure passed, those were bound by the vines gave out a cry of despair. The vines wrapped around those people seemed to have turned into sharp steel wires which suddenly tightened and the people were bound were cut into countless pieces of meat in an instant! Even their bones weren’t spared!

Snap!

It was a scene of gore and carnage behind her as those who were bound by the vines were like blossoming flowers of blood, blooming behind her. Hot blood splashed, mixed with minced meat and broken bones as they fell onto the ground and very soon, a dense stench of fresh blood permeated the air.

The bloodbath behind her formed a trail of blood along the path that she had walked, and it became a long red carpet and followed each and every step of hers, that garish red was a startling symbol of death.

Let’s not say those disciples of the Nine Temples, even those Gold Spirits who were bound by those strange vines had died without a complete corpse and they could not even make the slightest resistance.

Qiu Yun’s eyes widened in horror. He had never felt fear like this before and the moment he looked at her eyes, he realized that they did not resemble a person but that it was as if that was a devil that had crawled up from hell that would leave nothing alive in its path, not even chicken and dogs!

“Don’t... Don’t come over!!” For the very first time in his life, he felt the coming of death and he could no longer maintain the façade of calmness on his face. He screamed out in trepidation as tears welled up in his eyes as he clamoured in panic. There was an no longer any arrogance and smugness from before.

Qiu Yun’s screams echoed into the sky above the city and in the midst of the retching smell of blood, he watched on helplessly as he saw Jun Wu Xie approach him step by step. Each step she took felt like she was stepping on his heart and he felt a sharp pain in his chest.

At this moment, in the eyes of Qiu Yun, Jun Wu Xie was no longer a human being. Before she had even really made her move, she had only used some vines casually and it had already washed the city in blood. Thousands of Gold Spirits had died so easily, the strength of Jun Wu Xie had already exceeded Qiu Yun’s prediction. Let alone him, even if the Top Ten Masters of the Upper Realm came, they would not be able to gain any advantage at all!

This was simply a one-sided massacre! Even if you beat Qiu Yun to death, he would never ever have thought that the trap that he had set up for the Night Regime was actually sending himself directly to the devil!

He had no idea who Jun Wu Xie was. How did such a person that had never appeared in the Upper Realm before could harness such a terrible power?!

But what was even more terrifying was that....before her, he did not even have the chance to escape!
