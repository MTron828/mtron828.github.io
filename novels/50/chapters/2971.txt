Chapter 2972 I want to challenge six of them 2

The words of Jun Wu Xie didn’t just shock everyone. Long Yao froze. He did not expect that Jun Wu Xie would make such a request. The requirement was exactly the choice that could satisfy Jun Wu Xie’s thoughts of revenge.

For a while, Long Yao’s complexion changed greatly. The selection of the Top Ten Experts. Although there were regulations that the winner could only challenge one of the Top Ten Experts, no one had stipulated how many people one could challenge in this field!

Long Yao finally understood at this moment why Jun Wu Xie appeared here today.

Her purpose was for this challenge.

An opportunity to justify and send all enemies to hell.

Long Yao calculated everything but overlooked the courage of Jun Wu Xie’s. The Top Ten Experts may be unattainable in the eyes of others, but in the eyes of Jun Wu Xie, she was afraid of nothing.

At present, Jun Wu Xie’s words have been said. Even if Long Yao wants to find an excuse to turn around, it was already impossible.

The Top Ten Experts who were still glad that they could escape the calamity, felt ashamed after hearing Jun Wu Xie’s words. They all seemed to be broken up and could no’t stop shivering.

It was impossible to say that there were six people. That is, the Top Ten Experts and ten people were all present. How can they dare to confront a strong exponent possessing a Dual Spirit Ring?

To know that in the Three Realms, the only Dual Spirit Ring exponent before them was their ruler. The one who they dare not even say a word more.

Now, after Bai Zhu’s strange and tragic death, who still has the courage to fight against Jun Wu Xie?

Unfortunately, no amount of fear could stop this from happening. Jun Wu Xie’s eyes crossed the crowd and looked over at them.

“Long ... Lord Long Yao ...” Fang Jinghe’s teeth started to tremble incessantly. He didn’t know what to do. He just looked desperately at Long Yao.

They would die. They were very clear of what they had done to Qiao Chu and others. But now, they did not dare face it.

Long Yao’s face was extremely ugly but there’s nothing he could do now. He thought that he had grasped Jun Wu Xie’s weakness but he did not expect that in the end, Jun Wu Xie would turn the tides. He did not expect such an outcome. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Go on,” Long Yao said coldly.

Fang Jinghe and others were dumbfounded. Long Yao was sending them to their deaths?

“Long ... Lord Long Yao, you ... you can’t ...”

“I asked you to go down! Are the six of you really afraid of him? Even though he has the strength of the Dual Spirit Ring. But she is alone. You are the Top Ten Experts, the most powerful in the Upper Realm. To have the six of you join forces, you may not lose to Yan Hai.” Long Yao looked coldly at the Top Ten Experts.

Their faces had all turned pale. But at this stage, they did not have any room to maneuver and turn the tides. They could only walk down the broken room one by one and slowly walked onto the ring.

The people who came to the arena today would be watching a great show. They thought that the real game would take a few days to start. They didn’t expect that the match would be promoted to the challenge of the Top Ten Experts and to challenge six at one go!

On the field, everyone’s eyes widened with excitement.
