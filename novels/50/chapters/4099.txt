Ah Da was not a person from Diminishing Moon City. He was a person whom Zheng Weilong had rescued back from the brink of death when she was younger. He was very skilled, but he almost died under the pursuit of his enemies.

In the Upper Realm where relationships between humans were fragile and weak, it was rare to meet someone like like Ah Da who valued morality. He started to follow by Zheng Weilong’s side after he managed to survive to repay her life-saving grace. He stayed by her side and protected the weak her who had no spirit power. Before Zheng Weilong became an adult, Ah Da had lost count of the number of assassination attempts he had fended off from her ‘brothers and sisters.

In terms of strength, if compared with Ruan Zhongshan, Ah Da’s ability to condense spirit inscriptions was similar, but in terms of stealth, Ah Da prevailed.

Ah Da immediately told Zheng Weilong everything he heard in the City Lord’s manor.

She did not speak for a long time after hearing his report as she sought to digest the startling information.

“You mean, the reason why Ruan Zhongshan worked so hard to move the army was all for a formula of an elixir that belongs to Sea Spirit City?” Zheng Weilong furrowed her brows slightly after she heard his report.

When he started amassing his army, she already felt that something was off. If not for that, she wouldn’t have snuck along, but it had never crossed her mind that all Ruan Zhongshan did would actually be for an elixir’s formula?

Immediately, the thought that crossed her mind was that the formula was definitely not something simple! She was sure about it!

“When Sea Spirit City stopped the supply of Sea Spirit Beasts, Ruan Zhongshan sent someone to Sea Spirit City to enquire, but then it seemed like something happened ...” Zheng Weilong narrowed her eyes as she thought back about Ruan Zhongshan’s slightly odd behavior before his departure. She immediately discovered what was odd about it and she asked: “Do you remember the person whom Ruan Zhongshan brought into his residence for a short time?”

Ah Da nodded.

“What’s was odd about that person?”

Ah Da thought for a moment before saying: “The man has been to the City Lord’s manor once before. Ruan Zhongshan originally sent him to Sea Spirit City. He was not very powerful, but after he entered the City Lord’s manor for the second time and after he stayed there for a period, his strength suddenly soared. Although he still did not breakthrough to the peak of the Gold Spirit, he’s definitely much stronger than before.”

Ah Da paused and said, “Hmm...I felt that it was a little strange before. There are many geniuses in the Upper Realm, but those people had shown a certain talent when they’re just a few years old. However, that person has passed the age. In terms of his original strength, he is not considered to be exceptionally talented, but he has made great progress in such a short period of time. This situation is intriguing. ”

Xu Zu’s sudden increase in strength has garnered Ah Da’s attention. With Ah Da’s ramblings, Zheng Weilong fell into contemplation.

Long Xuan City, Sea Spirit City, surge of spirit power, sudden interruption of supply of Sea Spirit Beasts, and a formula that Ruan Zhongshan led the army to snatch ...

All the clues started to click together in Zheng Weilong’s mind, and gradually connected ...

Suddenly, Zheng Weilong opened her eyes.

“The formula for an elixir that could increase one’s strength?” Zheng Weilong suddenly said with shock as she continued to mumble to herself, “That’s right! The formula that Ruan Zhongshan wants must be a formula that can increase one’s strength! And that formula must use a lot of Sea Spirit Beasts as materials... No wonder ... No wonder Sea Spirit City would suddenly interrupt all supplies to the 72 cities!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Zheng Weilong’s heart suddenly started beating faster as all the answers that came together made her shocked!
