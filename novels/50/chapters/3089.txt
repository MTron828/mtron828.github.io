3090 This Is Vengeance 4

“Don’t worry, you’ll be joining Ye Jue soon and the one you want to protect, Jun Wu Xie, will be joining you as well...oh no...I won’t let her die that easily, after all, she is the woman who Ye Jue sacrificed his life to protect. I will take care of her properly and let her witness the deaths of all those dear to her, keeping her in an eternal state of torture. Your arrival is a true gift that allows me to increase her suffering!” The God of Destruction laughed cruelly, his plan to break through the void had been ruined by Jun Wu Yao’s death.

The God of Destruction was full of hatred and only exacting revenge ten or a hundred fold would quell it.

“Protect Little Xie well.” Fan Zhuo looked at his companions, all having the same resolution in their hearts.

Today, if they could not live, they would all die together!

They would not let the God of Destruction succeed even if they had to give their lives!

In what seemed to be the same instant that Fan Zhuo spoke, Fei Yan put Jun Wu Xie over his shoulder and ran out of the hall as fast as he could.

Fei Yan’s injury had not fully healed and was the least ready for battle among the four of them. But he was still stronger than Qiao Chu and the rest so the best strategy was to get Jun Wu Xie as far away from danger as possible.

The God of Destruction saw Jun Wu Xie being carried out and wanted to give chase. However at that moment, Qiao Chu, Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo summoned their Spirit Rings and fused them with their own souls!

Before, when they managed to survive the attacks of the Top Ten masters, it was because their souls had merged with their Spirit Rings. Now that their souls were fully healed, going through another fusion would increase their strength tremendously!

A dazzling aura surrounded them, taking the shape of their Spirit Rings. Their power could be seen wafting in the air and their bodies grew larger and covered the exit to the hall.

“You’ve overestimated yourselves.” The God of Destruction laughed.

It was undeniable that their current strength would have put them at the top of the Three Realms, higher than even the Top Ten masters who had attacked them previously. But their opponent was not a person...but a God!

In the blink of an eye, they were sent flying by the God of Destruction. If they were not protected by their spiritual power, all their internal organs would have been crushed.

Even so, when they fell to the ground, they still coughed up blood and in that blood there were bits of flesh. They had already suffered internal injuries.....

Before the God of Destruction could think of giving chase to Jun Wu Xie, Qiao Chu and the rest stood up once more and rushed towards him, not caring about their lives.

The three of them were like moths to a flame, knowing the battle was futile but were still unwilling to give any quarter. If they could delay the God of Destruction by even one second, giving Fei Yan more time to get Jun Wu Xie further away, it would be worth it....ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
