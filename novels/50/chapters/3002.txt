Chapter 3003 A Tyrant’s Cruelty 3

According to Rong Ruo, after his soul was imprisoned in the puppet, he had no control over his pupper body. It was only after Su Ruiying’s actions that he was able to have control over the puppet.

When he was thrown into the furnace, he had no control over the puppet’s body and could only resign himself to getting burnt. He was only able to escape when he suddenly gained control over the puppet and made a break for it.

Looking at the burn marks on Rong Ruo’s back, Jun Wu XIe had an idea. She removed the clothes from her other puppet and tried to rub off the markings on its back with her hand. But it was to no effect.

The markings were made with an unknown material and had already bonded with the wood of the puppet. Trying to remove it was basically impossible.

Jun Wu Xie patiently and carefully examined the markings on the back of the puppet and after a long while, found some familiar markings. She took out some Spiritual Reinforcement tools and started to draw a new layer on top of it.

The moment Jun Wu Xie finished her last brush stroke, the previously immobile puppet suddenly started moving!

The puppet sat blankly on the table, desperately clutching the pile of little clothes and anxiously looking at Jun Wu Xie and the rest.

Rong Ruo looked on in surprise, other than himself he had not seen another puppet break free of Su Ruiying’s control and move freely.

Jun Wu Xie had a glint in her eyes, she understood everything clearly now.

“Su Ruiying’s markings are a form of Spiritual Reinforcement. I can roughly guess its meaning even though I can’t be entirely sure. I used another Spiritual Reinforcement on top of it and managed to neutralise its effects.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Jun Wu Xie did not expect that the Soul Reinforcement she had accidentally seen in her previous life would have so much use now but she did not know either the origins of the Soul Reinforcement or what its uses were.

Rong Ruo was a little dazed, then started to chuckle to himself. If Su Ruiying found out that the method of controlling puppets that she had worked so hard on was so easily neutralized by Jun Wu Xie, she would have had a fit.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the trembling puppet and said softly: “We have no intention of hurting you. If you are willing to cooperate with us, we can help you to restore your freedom.”

The puppet looked at Jun Wu Xie blankly. After a moment of hesitation, she nodded decisively.

Jun Wu Xie used the same Soul Reinforcement drawn on Rong Ruo’s body on the puppet, and soon they heard the voice of the soul trapped in the puppet. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That puppet was originally a woman from one of the 72 Cities and because of her great beauty, was sent to one of the Top Ten Masters by her City Lord to gain his favour. But the one she was sent to was cruel and she had no strength to resist. It was not long before she could not take the treatment and died.

After her death, her soul came under the control of Su Ruiying and was turned into a puppet, just like Rong Ruo.

As that puppet was describing what it went through, it was crying continuously but there were no tears visible.

After all, she was now a puppet and no matter how much pain she was going through, was unable to shed even a single tear.
