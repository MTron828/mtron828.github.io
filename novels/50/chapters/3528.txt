The instant that clap of his hands sounded, a shadow appeared slowly from the back of the grand hall.

Soul Slayer came out from under the Spirit Lord’s shocked gaze, to come stand beside Wu Jiu.

“Soul Slayer?” Flame Dragon’s eyes widened, as he stared in disbelief at the figure of Soul Slayer standing beside Wu Jiu.

“The Spirit World does not only consist of stubborn and obstinate fools like you. There are also outstanding talents who know what’s good for them.” Wu Jiu said with a sneering laugh.

Wincing pain spread through Flame Dragon’s heart. It could not understand why Soul Slayer would want to stand on Wu Jiu’s side. Didn’t Soul Slayer hear everything that had just been said?

“Soul Slayer! Wu Jiu harboured such evil intentions and held the Spirit Lord captive. The one sitting up there upon the throne now is not the Spirit Lord that all of us have pledged allegiance to! Our Spirit Lord is the one standing here, how could you.....”

“Flame Dragon, there’s no need to continue.” Poison Ivy’s brows were knitted together. Towards all this, he did not seem to be surprised.

“Why?” Flame Dragon’s face was filled with incomprehension.

“You’re still being such a fool Flame Dragon. Do you really think that just because he’s some useless Spirit Lord and he is worth having all spirits bodies pleading their loyalty to him? Stop pulling my leg. With one’s self interest before them, real loyalty does not exist at all.” Wu Jiu continued to sneer.

Flame Dragon stared at Wu Jiu, and then turned to stare at Soul Slayer, still unable to believe all of that.

“Soul Slayer, just what..... are you thinking? It’s the Spirit Lord who created the Spirit World and that gave all of us a place to live in, allowing us to escape the fate of living as homeless wandering spirits. You clearly know that Wu Jiu and that imposter have evil intentions, so why would you go stand on their side! ? Soul Slayer! Answer me!”

Flame Dragon’s sense of loyalty caused it to be unable to accept Soul Slayer’s betrayal.

Flame Dragon was not on too familiar terms with Soul Slayer, hence, when Soul Slayer had fought aggressively during the struggle for fourth Serene Spirit Tower, and when Soul Slayer had chosen to stand on Wu Jiu’s side when they were trying to capture the Spiritual Bear, though Soul Slayer’s choices were showing a lack of righteousness and justice, Flame Dragon could still see it as Soul Slayer caring more about the strengthening the might of the Weapon Spirits and Soul Slayer might have been bewitched by Wu Jiu. But when it came to loyalty to the Spirit Lord, how could it choose to be a traitor?

To betray the Spirit Lord who gave them everything here?

Why?

Wu Jiu glanced at Soul Slayer, the corners of his mouth curling up with a smile, seeming like he wanted Soul Slayer to answer Flame Dragon’s question.

Soul Slayer was silent for a rather long while before its voice then rang out within the grand hall.

“Don’t the humans have a saying that people are willing to die for riches and birds die for food? I am very grateful to the Spirit Lord for what he has done, that allowed all of us to have a place to live in. But a person will climb up to greater heights while water flows down into lower depths. Flame Dragon, I do not think there is anything wrong with the choice I made. What Wu Jiu promised to me, is what the Spirit Lord is unable to give. So what is wrong with choosing as per my wish?”

“Soul Slayer!” Flame Dragon’s eyes were filled with shock, unable to believe that it had just heard such callous and unfeeling words coming out from Soul Slayer’s mouth.

Wu Jiu nodded his head in satisfaction and turned to say to Jun Wu Xie and the others: “Is there anything wrong with what Soul Slayer has chosen to do? I promised Soul Slayer that if they help us complete the construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, not only will we give to them more powerful might, we will give them back their original bodies, where they no longer need to live as spirits.”

New bodies.....

That was something that so many spirits could only dream of. Although mighty power of the spirit was great, it could not beat having one’s own body, where the allure of being able to live in the world was just irresistible.

And Wu Jiu was using just that most enticing temptation to reinforce Soul Slayer’s determination in his betrayal.
