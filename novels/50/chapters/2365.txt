The abnormality of a spirit couldn’t be judged easily by the bystander. Therefore, the Spirit Lord and the others won’t be able to notice the discomfort that was experiencing by Jun Wu Xie.

In the underground palace, Situ Heng was seated with his legs crossed without any expression on his face. There wasn’t anything weird on his emotionless face.

Jun Wu Xie’s spirit was now enduring torment but she couldn’t get out of this circumstance.

With a gloomy glare in his eyes, Situ Heng stared at the stiffened figure of Jun Wu Xie. A murderous intent flashed across his eyes.

One day had passed with just a blink of an eye, Situ Heng finally kept his soul power back and ended the first round of controlling her energy. The moment Situ Heng removed his soul power, the soul thread that was linking with the centre part between Jun Wu Xie’s eyebrows dissipated and the light of the spirit fires that was originally gathering together too, began to scatter in all directions.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t move a bit and was still sitting on the round platform even when Situ Heng had gotten himself up and moved to the side. The Spirit Lord then immediately went to have a check on Jun Wu Xie but he did not dare to simply touch her.

While on the other hand, Long Jiu seemed to be a little nervous. “How is it? How is it? Is there any effect?”

The Spirit Lord shook his head. “I have never used this kind of method. I can’t really tell that if it’s effective or not.”

Throughout the ages, Jun Wu Xie was the very first person to cultivate the Soul World Cultivation Method with her mortal body!

The Spirit Lord and the rest waited for a long time before there was movement coming from Jun Wu Xie who was sitting on the round platform. The tightly closed eyes opened slowly and a pair of calm and cool eyes came into their sight.

At that time, the Spirit Lord and the others let out a sigh of relief.

“How is it?” asked the Spirit Lord while looking at Jun Wu Xie.

After a moment of silence, Jun Wu Xie replied. “It’s okay.”

A trace of gladness appeared on the Spirit Lord’s face.

“That’s good. You may have a rest for a day and we’ll proceed on the day after tomorrow. You may feel a little uncomfortable at first, but slowly, it will be better,” said the Spirit Lord. Knowing that there wasn’t any strong energy repellence felt by Jun Wu Xie was the best thing ever.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. While standing up, she tended to wobble and it scared Long Jiu so much that he almost went forward to support her. However, Jun Wu Xie waved her hands and stabilized her body. She then tardily walked out from the underground palace. There wasn’t any odd expression seen on Jun Wu Xie’s face when she brushed past Situ Heng. Agilely, the black cat walked behind Jun Wu Xie.

The Spirit Lord and the others in the underground palace didn’t notice any strangeness the entire time. They were just sincerely feeling happy for Jun Wu Xie. No matter if Jun Wu Xie was able to fully recover using this method, at least it did have its effect based on the current view.

Jun Wu Xie who was already outside the underground palace failed to bear the sore and pain in her spirit. She sat under a big tree while leaning her back on its trunk without making any noise. Although she was in her spirit form, her face didn’t look good. It was even to the extent of being scary.

“There’s something wrong with Situ Heng!” Since there wasn’t anyone around, the black cat jumped on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder and spoke urgently to her. Both its and Jun Wu Xie’s spirits shared the same body and the connection between their spirits was very close. When Jun Wu Xie was regulating her soul power, the black cat could feel it clearly too. There wasn’t any problem with the soul power of the Spirit Lord, Qin Song and Long Jiu.

But when it was handed over to Situ Heng, the condition was totally different!

Even the black cat was able to feel the great discomfort from the extreme aggressive soul power, let alone Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes, with coldness glinting under them. After sitting for a while, she got up. She didn’t return right off to get some rest. Instead, she turned back and headed towards the Spirit Palace.

Just when the Spirit Lord went back to his resting place and prepared to rest, he suddenly saw Jun Wu Xie who should have left once again appeared outside the door of his room. He was surprised to see her.
