Chapter 11: “Assault”

“I’m hungry.” Jun Wu Xie’s main priority was to get well fast – the longer she left it to those quacks...she shuddered just from the thought of it.

Jun Wu Yao left her in the care of the servants and quietly disappeared.

After storming out from Lin Palace, Bai Yun Xian’s face was full of discontent. No matter how much Mo Xuan Fei tried to coax her, she simply ignored him.

“If it wasn’t you who had requested me, do you think I would have even stepped into that place? Who does she think she is?” Bai Yun Xian huffed as she bit her lower lip. As Qing Yun Clan Sovereign’s disciple, the number of people seeking her was as long as a dragon, however on the account of Mo Xuan Fei, despite her own reluctance she still went over. The result? She was driven out! She had never suffered from such humiliation before.

“Yun Xian, why waste your energy over a waste?” he cajoled her.

“No matter what, you are a Prince of a kingdom! By lowering your head in front of another...you....” Sneered Bai Yun Xian.

Mo Xuan Fei’s face flushed with embarrassment.

“Do not be angry, I will definitely take revenge for you.” Appeasing her was the key.

Sure enough, after hearing those words of his, Bai Yun Xian’s expression was slightly better. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Don’t forget this promise of yours.” She peeked over at him.

“Definitely, I won’t make any empty promises.” Mo Xuan Fei heaved a sigh of relief.

To cheer her up, Mo Xuan Fei did not directly head back to the palace. Instead, they travelled in the carriage with a team of guards and went out of town to sightsee. Only when she finally revealed a smiling face after watching the sunset at the famed ‘Sea of Flowers’ did they head back to the city.

On their way back, in the carriage Mo Xuan Fei was holding onto Yun Xian’s hands as they leaned on each other.

The carriage came to an abrupt stop. The carriage was travelling at a relatively fast pace and when it was stopped so suddenly, they almost fell out of the carriage.

“Why did you stop!” bellowed Mo Xuan Fei.

But no one responded to his question.

As he went out to reprimand them, he could see a silhouette of a person quietly standing in front of the entourage as the darkness of the night enveloped him. The light from the flames of the torches could not reach his face.

“Who is there?” Mo Xuan Fei asked with a guarded expression. By this time, Bai Yun Xian had also stepped out of the carriage.

The team at the front watched the stranger cautiously as they watched him slowly raised his slightly opened hands when he suddenly clenched his fist.

Instantly all the bodyguards’ bodies burst at the same time, splattering blood everywhere.

“Aaahhhhhhhh!” Bai Yun Xian let out a shrill scream as the bloody remains splattered onto her beautiful skirt.

The fire torches all fell to the ground, turning their surrounding into a wall of fire. In the middle of it all were two frightened figures closely huddled together.

Watching the ring of fire, a lone figure took a step back. “Unfortunately, I don’t have a good temper.” He whispered under the moonlight.
