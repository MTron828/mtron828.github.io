Chapter 3023 Entering tiger’s den 3

Jun Wu Xie sat calmly in the chair beside Su Ruiying. There was no slight expression on her face, only her pair of cold eyes that had swept over Su Ruiying. She could see that Su Ruiying’s heart was shaking but could only maintain the smile on her face.

“Cough... Ah Fu serve tea.” Su Ruiying concealed her guilty mood as much as possible.

The ghoul masked man quickly retreated, and after a while he served the tea but Jun Wu Xie did not accept it and simply left the tea that was placed on the table beside her.

Su Ruiying couldn’t wait for Jun Wu Xie to speak. Her heart was beating wildly as she tried to retain her calm facade, “It’s so late, Yan Hai, what is the matter?”

Jun Wu Xie finally said, “It’s not a big deal, but I’m going to see His Lord three days later, and I feel a little bit unsure. After all, I have never seen His Lord before.”

Su Ruiying was relieved after hearing her words.

“Oh, this is the matter you are referring to.”

“Otherwise?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows slightly.

Su Ruiying smiled a little stiffly and awkwardly: “For this matter, you don’t have to be too nervous about it, since you are the one chosen by His Lord, His Lord will not embarrass you. You can rest assured. His Lord is very kind to us Knights of Destruction, and his temperament is also very good. ”

“Oh? Really?” Jun Wu Xie said quietly.

“That’s natural. If I change someone else, I might not dare to be so stubborn. But we are different. The existence of us Knights of Destruction was selected by His Lord himself. It is completely different from other people. We belong directly to His Lord. On the other hand, our power also comes from His Lord. When you become a Knight of Destruction, you will understand that everything I said today is true. “Su Ruiying seemed to relax her vigilance and said nonchalantly.

“Your strength is already very strong. If there is any blessing from His Lord, it will be better.”

“However, Chi Yan had said before that it was uncomfortable. Before the ceremony, could I not see His Lord?” Jun Wu Xie naturally asked her question. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, Su Ruiying chuckled with a smile: “That’s Chi Yan deliberately trying to test you. The few of us also met His Lord before becoming a Knight of Destruction. After all, we will serve ourselves to His Lord. If His Lord has not seen it with his own eyes, how can he be assured? ”

“I was curious. When did you find out that Chi Yan tested you. And unexpectedly something happened to Long Yao halfway and His Lord would see you in advance ...” , Su Ruiying’s expression was obviously a bit stiff. She secretly looked at Jun Wu Xie and saw that she did not find out anything.

And Jun Wu Xie had already obtained the result she wanted to know the most. It turns out that His Lord asked to see her in advance, not a special case, but a situation that every Knight of Destruction would encounter. As a result, they were nervous previously. Now they could relax a little bit.

Jun Wu Xie secretly exchanged a look with Jun Wu Yao. Their thoughts were known to each other but left unspoken.

“Anyway, there shouldn’t be any problems for His Lord to see you. If you still have something to worry about, just ask me.” Su Ruiying’s attitude turned good at this moment, it was just that ugly face that people couldn’t get close to.
