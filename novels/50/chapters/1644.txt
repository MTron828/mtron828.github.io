Chapter 1645: “The Secret Worry of the Blood Fiend Palace (3)”

Gu Ying’s face was slapped hard and blood spilled out from the corner of his mouth. But there wasn’t even the slightest bit of anguish in Gu Yi’s eyes, his gaze remaining just as cold, not in the least bit like the eyes of a father looking at his child.

“Do you even realize your mistake in this at all?” Gu Yi asked in a frosty tone.

Gu Ying calmly tilted his head back to look straight into Gu Yi’s eyes with his face still showing a brilliant smile. But the trickle of blood spilling over the corner of his mouth looked highly horrifying. However, his eyes still filled with mirth like the person who had been struck was not him at all.

“I know my mistake now.” Gu Ying replied obediently.

“Useless piece of trash. Since you know you’ve done wrong, why haven’t you gone to receive your punishment?” There was the slightest tinge of sympathy in Gu Yi’s tone, the way he treated Gu Ying was vicious like the way he treated an enemy.

“I will obey.” Gu Ying nodded slightly, turning his back to silently walk away.

Gu Yi stared at Gu Ying’s back, his eyes filled with disdain.

Who would have thought that the Palace Lord of the Blood Fiend Palace would be on such bad terms with his own son?

Gu Ying slowly walked out from Gu Yi’s line of sight, the smile on his face not reducing in the slightest as he walked past disciples of the Blood Fiend Palace. When the disciples saw Gu Ying, they all subconsciously lowered their heads, not daring to stare at the wretched state Gu Ying’s face was in.

This was not the first time that such a situation had occurred and it was not known why the usually amiable Palace Lord was so hard hearted towards the Young Lord. It had been like this since Gu Ying was very young. Gu Yi had been extremely harsh and strict towards him, so much so that others who saw it felt their hearts wince. Initially, people had thought that the Palace Lord had seeked to mould his son to be a dragon among men and that was the reason he was being so strict. But Gu Yi wasn’t so harsh with his daughter Gu Xin Yan but acted like what a real father would. Although there were times he was strict as well, most of time he displayed great care and doting indulgence towards Gu Xin Yan.

Gu Ying walked through the Blood Fiend Palace like there was no one around, the glaringly red five fingered palm print and the streak of blood at the corner of his mouth causing others to not dare to look at him. He walked alone towards the Blood Fiend Palace’s dungeon, the place where disciples of the Blood Fiend Palace received their punishment.

Inside the dim and dank dungeon, were various chilling tools of torture. When the disciples within the dungeon saw Gu Ying appear, they immediately went forward to bow in deference.

Gu Ying ignored them completely and instead walked on his own towards the torture rack.

“I came to receive punishment.” Gu Ying said highly nonchalantly.

The men on duty at the dungeon looked at each other and then stepped forward without a word to help Gu Ying remove his outer robe, leaving him only with his thin under robe before strapping him onto the torture rack.

The crackling sounds of the whip reverberated within the dim dungeon, sounding unusually prickly to the ear under the silence of the place.

The sounds went on for half a day, and it only stopped when it was deep into the night.

The disciple meting out the punishment had already retreated out from the dungeon and in that dim dungeon, only Gu Ying who was covered all over in blood was there all alone strapped upon the torture rack, his head drooping down, the thin inner robe torn to shreds by the countless lashes of the whip, the crisscrossing wounds with his flesh torn and turned outwards, blood congealed upon the gaping wounds. Only on that handsome face was there no trace of a wound, but was extremely pale and drained of all colour.

Gu Ying eyes were both closed and his hair slightly messed up. He looked like he had fainted but was still tied to the torture rack with the ropes around his hands. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Suddenly, a black shadow walked out from under the dim flickering light, to look at Gu Ying tied up upon the torture rack and his brows creased together slightly.

“Young Lord.”

Gu Ying’s eyes opened slowly as he raised his head, revealing a long lash mark around his neck running down all the way from his ear to his collarbone.
