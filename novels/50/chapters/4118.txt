The front gates of the City Lord’s manor was opened, the stone steps in front of the door were stained with blood. The corpse next to the stone steps was shocking and the blood trail extended from the stone steps to the door.

“Well, now I’ve seen everything. This City Lord of the Upper Realm is too tragic. This person had died and no one has collected his body, that’s fine. Just a few days after his death and his residence has been snatched by a group of demons and monsters. This is really uncomfortable.” Qiao Chu looked at the mess outside the city’s official residence. The chaos in Long Xuan City had astounded him.

If this matter occurred in the Lower and Middle realms, even a village chief would have received a better treatment than Ruan Zhongshan.

At least there were some people who collected their corpses, but Ruan Zhongshan’s body was added into the pile of corpses and burnt by Ghost Army.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t say anything, she just raised her foot and stepped into the manor.

But before she stepped onto the stone steps, a figure ‘flew’ out from the door!

Jun Wuxi leaned slightly sideways, and avoided that mass of dark shadows.

The dark shadow slammed on the hard slate floor and vomited blood.

It was a man in his early forties. There were countless of colourful ribbons hanging from his body, large and small wounds covered his body as well. However, he immediately got up from the ground and wiped the corners of his mouth. He pointed at the residence and cursed, “Liu!! If you have the ability, then fight one-on-one with me! What’s the point of having backup?”

As soon as the curses left his mouth, a sturdier looking man of the same age came out of the City Lord’s manor. Although he also had a lot of blood on his body, he seemed to fare much better than the first man. He was followed by two thin men.

“Lao Yu, what you said is not right. I’m not the only one with backup, it’s just that the people you brought with you is a bunch of trash! Once they are dead, you can barely handle it. How can you blame me?” The man whose surname was Liu sneered and looked at the bruised Lao Yu with disdain.

Jun Wu Xie and others were standing aside, but the two people did not seem to notice their existence at all, or maybe they didn’t even bother about Jun Wu Xie at all.

“Yo, these two are very angry, what’s the story?” Qiao Chu watched with interest and couldn’t help asking Zheng Weilong, who stood to the side.

Zheng Weilong lived in Long Xuan City for more than a month. Although she rarely went out, with Ah Da’s help, she was very clear about Long Xuan City’s situation. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“These two people were once the most powerful exponents under Ruan Zhongshan, they have just broken through to Gold Spirit and are starting to consolidate Spiritual Inscriptions. In the entire Long Xuan City, their strength is second only to Ruan Zhongshan. Now that Ruan Zhongshan is dead, these two exponents are naturally the main candidates for the title of City Lord.” Zheng Weilong told Qiao Chu and the others truthfully all that she knew.

Qiao Chu nodded.

Jun Wu Xie suddenly said, “In the present Long Xuan City, the two of them are the best?”

Zheng Weilong froze slightly, wondering why Jun Wu Xie had this question, but nodded.

“Yes.”

After Jun Wu Xie heard Zheng Weilong’s words, she suddenly lifted her feet as her figure flickered from Zheng Weilong’s eyes and disappeared on the spot!
