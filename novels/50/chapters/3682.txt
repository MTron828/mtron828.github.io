When that figure appeared in Su Jing Yan’s mind, even he himself was shocked.

How could it be her?

Su Jing Yan felt ridiculous about his own speculation as he left. Now that a torrential storm had stirred up in the Middle Realm, the Nine Temples could not even protect themselves. Only by obeying Qiu Yun’s orders could they keep their own people alive, as for everything else, they could only resign it to fate. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Dark Region.

Ye Sha, Ye Mei and Ye Gu knelt on the floor before Jun Wu Xie on one knee as they reported the results over the past few days.

“Over the past few days, the Nine Temples had been more vigilant and has employed a large force and are searching more thoroughly throughout the Middle Realm. Among the several divisions that have been attacked yesterday, there were some people hidden and it seems that they were trying to follow us.” Ye Sha reported in a sombre tone.

The sharp blade that had been asleep for a thousand years, once the Night Regime had unsheathed their swords, tt had caught the people from the Upper Realm completely off guard. Their appearance was pivotal at such a time and in just half a month’s time, they had unleashed all the bloodlust that had been suppressed for the past millennium.

Jun Wu Xie was sitting on the throne and stroking the magnificent coat of the black beast leisurely.

“They can no longer sit still.” Jun Wu Xie slowly lifted her gaze as a cold glint flashed by.

“Yes.” Ye Sha nodded his head, it wasn’t something that needed much thought. The arrogance of the Upper Realm would not tolerate such a thing. They were attacked continuously and each time, the casualties were immense and not a living soul was left. Their face had long been swept away, so how could they endure it any longer?

“Give them a chance.” Jun Wu Xie said suddenly.

A hint of surprise flashed by Ye Mei’s eyes.

“Young Miss, do you mean... To let them know of our route?” Ye Mei was somewhat uncertain, doing this... Wouldn’t that mean exposing part of Night Regime’s whereabouts?

She nodded her head slightly.

“Let them have a taste of their own medicine. It is time to close the nets.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes dangerously as a flash of murderous intent streaked by.

Everything that had happened before was just but an appetizer. The main dish had not been served yet.

All those people from the Upper Realm, I hope that you can still take whatever is coming your way!

“Yes, your subordinate will go prepare immediately!” Ye Mei did not ask any but followed her orders with devotion.

Over the past five years, Jun Wu Xie’s growth had been silent, even they did not know what was her current strength was. However, with regards to the trust in her, the three of them had never questioned that. This was because... this was the reason that Jun Wu Yao had left them to her in the first place.

“Young Miss, your subordinate had a brief contact with the soldiers of the Rui Lin Army today. They asked... If you were safe?” Ye Sha who had been deliberating for a long time finally reported everything that he had encountered today. In fact, long before this, each time they had went out for their mission, he had already noticed that there were people who were observing them but they did not have any hostility. He had guessed that the other party was most likely to be the people of the Rui Lin Army which was why he did not dawdle on each time after completing a mission. Upon completing the mission, he would immediately leave with the Night Regime, not wanting to have any contact with the Rui Lin Army.

However...

After today’s brief encounter, he had discovered that the Rui Lin Army had never once forgotten Jun Wu Xie. They had been lingering about in the Middle Realm all this while, it seems that it was to find Jun Wu Xie.

Facing the persistence of the Rui Lin Army, Ye Sha’s heart had softened.

Jun Wu Xie remained silent, there was not a thread of emotion reflected on her face. She only lowered her gaze and only after long while did she ask, “How did you reply?”

“Your subordinate... did not say anything.” Ye Sha replied.

“That is enough.”
