When Jun Wu Yao carried Jun Wu Xie up in a princess hold, his lips were hooked up. In that smile, there was deep affection and a look full of indulgence.

The little old man was shocked at the sudden appearance of Jun Wu Yao. From the battle till now, he had not discovered the presence of anyone else and yet when he saw the appearance of that person, his face was immediately changed.

“It’s you!”

Jun Wu Yao’s gaze fell onto the little old man as he raised his brows up slightly.

The little old man suddenly laughed out.

“No wonder this little brat was so daring. It turned out that he is with you, I really didn’t think that you and I would actually have a day that we would meet each other.” The little old man’s voice held a tinge of laughter in it. Between Jun Wu Yao and him, they were actually old acquaintances.

Jun Wu Xie opened her eyes because of the little old man’s voice and when she saw the expression on her Grandmaster, she could not help but look at him puzzledly.

“Little brat, this man beside you is quite a dangerous one.” The little old man bellowed with laughter as he looked at her.

Jun Wu Xie blinked her eyes, how could she not understand the meaning behind his words?

The little old man was related to the Upper Realm as well as the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. So with regards to Jun Wu Yao, it seems that they had long known each other.

“So what about it?” Jun Wu Xie retorted.

The little old man lost his smile, after all it was this little brat who had such audacious courage that had actually came up with such a scheme to contend against a thousand Gold Spirits without any change in expression. Looking at it, it seems that the origins of Jun Wu Yao had been discovered. If Jun Wu Xie was afraid, then it wouldn’t be Jun Wu Xie at all.

“Yeah, so what about it....” The little old man’s voice held a hint of loss.

“Grandmaster, we should not stay here any longer, we need to leave at once.” Jun Wu Xie reminded him.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord walked over and when he saw Jun Wu Yao, he was stunned for a moment. His expression was a bit complicated but he did not say anything.

Ye Mei carried the heavily wounded and unconscious Lord Meh Meh and followed the team. The little black cat nimbly jumped onto Jun Wu Yao’s shoulder as it looked worriedly at the wounds on Jun Wu Xie. It was really rare that it had put down its fear of Jun Wu Yao. Not to mention, it even daringly set on that great devil king’s shoulder and even more shocking was.... Jun Wu Yao did not say anything.

Drunk Lotus, Poppy and Poison Ivy were in great condition, hence, they walked behind and each guarded the rear on each side, taking up the role of protecting the team.

When they reached the entrance of the Cloudy Brook Academy, the team suddenly stopped.

Outside the main gates of the Academy, there were a few figures. One of which was the Black Sacrificial Rabbit who had escaped with Su Ya.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s expression changed slightly. He was just about to rush forward but he saw the little old man raise his hand to stop him.

Outside the gate, a handsome tall man was kneeling on the ground. In his arms that he was holding so carefully and tenderly was the very Su Ya who had been riddled with injuries. That man’s face was full of tears, his pained eyes revealed his heartbreak yet he was so gentle and cautious, afraid that any movement of his would bring great pain to her.

When the little old man saw that man, he could not help but let out a sigh.

Jun Wu Xie who was in the arms of Jun Wu Yao slowly opened her eyes and when she looked over, her lips curled up into a warm smile.

Outside the gates, that person was carrying Su Ya was not anyone else but Yan Bu Gui who had left a year ago in search of Su Ya ....

Whoever thought that after so many years when the two of them met each other again, it would be such a scenario?
