Situ Heng did not speak, but the maliciousness lurking in his eyes had revealed his inner doubts.

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and stroked the little black cat on the side with affection. In a wistful manner, she said: “In the world, there exists a special type of soul. Although there are two souls but they share an entity. Even though you tried to use the soul thread to embed the Soul Devourer into my soul in the midst of the treatment, you didn’t know that there was another soul within. I am one with it, and it is born with the ability to devour the soul. It is not difficult for it to extract the Soul Devourer which you buried in my soul.”

There were very little who knew the actual relationship between the black cat and her. But today, she did not mind to let him know before his death.

“I really didn’t think that... you are such a scheming little bitch!” Situ Heng gnashed his teeth and glared hatefully at Jun Wu Xie. Things had already progressed to such a stage, he knew that his end was inevitable.

Soul Devourer was a poison that only exists in the Soul World. Here in the Spirit World, other than the Spirit Lord, only him, Qin Song and Long Jiu came from the Soul World. Qin Song and Long Jiu were always together, and they did not have any intention to harm Jun Wu Xie. The only other person left with an ulterior motive would be him.

Not to mention...

Jun Wu Xie had clearly seen through his schemes but she did not do anything before because she was waiting for him to close the net himself!

At this moment, Situ Heng’s heart was filled with remorse. He should have just killed Jun Wu Xie directly. He should never have been so greedy. He tried to severe the relationship of the Lower Realm and the Spirit World by provoking them with the death of Jun Wu Xie. If he didn’t do that, where would so much trouble stem from?

No amount of regret could reverse the current situation. Situ Heng can glare hatefully at Jun Wu Xie, as if he wanted to swallow her alive.

“Situ... Why did you do this? No matter how much you dislike the little lass, you shouldn’t commit such a mad thing!” Long Jiu couldn’t accept it all. Situ Heng’s words were equivalent to acquiesce. He couldn’t understand why his companion would do such a terrible thing.

“Little lass? Hah! She is but a little bitch. With merely a few words, she is able to confuse you and Qin Song, get you two all muddled up and twirl the two of you round her fingers. I am not as stupid as the both of you!” Situ Heng sneered, not a sliver of regret could be seen.

“Did you think that she will really give you the seed of the Spirit Tree? Stop dreaming, the seed of the Spirit Tree is so rare and part of her soul is lacking. If she gave the seed to you, wouldn’t that spell her own death?! Did you really think that she will fulfill her promise? Stupid! I despise you two idiots! You are just a bunch of useless waste!”

Long Jiu’s face turned green when he heard Situ Heng.

Qin Song looked painfully at Situ Heng. Situ Heng had always been stubborn and grumpy, but he still did not understand why Situ Heng did this. If he killed Jun Wu Xie, the seed of the Spirit Tree would also be damaged. Did he hate her that much?

“Why should you use these glorious words to cover up your true purpose? Are you really doing all of this for the good of the Soul World?” Jun Wu Xie’s clear voice rang out at this moment. “If it is for the Soul World, why do you have to provoke the relationship between the Lower Realm and the Spirit World? Situ Heng, you have given me the answer to my first question, but as for my second question, would you be so kind as to tell me? Where do your allegiance lie? Is it the Spirit Tree or someone from the Upper Realm?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The moment Jun Wu Xie uttered these words out, both Qin Song and Long Jiu who were at the side sucked in a cold breath deeply!
