Chapter 2398: The Army of The Upper Realm (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“If the battle begins, do you really think that there’s any need for you to fight?” Wei Ya raised his eyebrows and said.

Xie Chang Ming slightly stunned. He then immediately got what Wei Ya meant.

It was just some little cats and dogs from the Lower Realm, did they even need to lift a finger?

The five hundred thousand strong army was already enough for them to destroy the entire Lower Realm.

“Nope, I must cut off the bitch’s head by myself,” said Xie Chang Ming arrogantly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Jun Wu Xie belongs to me.” Suddenly, a cold voice came into the ears of Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya. The moment both the people who were originally chatting happily heard the voice, they quickly hid the smiles on their faces.

“Lady Qingcheng.” Xie Chang Ming looked respectfully at Luo Qingcheng who had also turned her head and stared in his direction, not daring to show any disrespect on his face.

Luo Qingcheng looked at Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya who were being extremely deferential towards her with a cold glare in her eyes. She heard their conversation. Not a word was left out. She totally didn’t care about everything they said, except for one thing...

“Both of you listen carefully. You can kill anyone in the Lower Realm if you want to, but Jun Wu Xie... She must be left to me.” The pair of Luo Qingcheng’s eyes slightly narrowed. Jun Wu Xie’s life belonged to her. Only when she tore Jun Wu Xie into pieces with her own hands, then her hatred could be extinguished!

There was a strong murderous intention in the cool voice. Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya couldn’t help but shudder after listening to her words.

Luo Qingcheng was actually much younger than both of them, but except for His Lord, there was no any other one in the entire Upper Realm had the guts to be rude in front of her. Though Luo Qingcheng was younger, her talent was prodigiously higher than everyone that they could only be left far behind. She was also the only student of His Lord in the Upper Realm. Either it was her strength or her status, her place was far beyond anyone in the Top Ten Experts of the Upper Realm.

Even if it was someone presumptuous like Xie Chang Ming had no other choice but to hold his high horse back and remain well-behaved like a quail when he was in front of Luo Qingcheng.

“Yes... Your subordinate understands.” Xie Chang Ming carefully replied. Although Luo Qingcheng’s character was cool at the beginning, people wouldn’t be fearful of her. But after she had caught Ye Jue for the first time thousand years ago, Luo Qingcheng’s personality suddenly became unpredictable. Her moody personality had caused everyone to slowly hold her in awe.

However, Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya had vaguely realized that there was a trace of strong hatred in Luo Qingcheng’s words. The hatred was targeted at Jun Wu Xie, the person they just mentioned not long ago.

Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya were quite surprised at the case. They were completely confused. Why would Luo Qingcheng who had only one over her and millions under her in the Upper Realm hate a hillbilly from the Lower Realm so much?

There were questions wandering in both their minds but they could only respond politely and mind their own business since they didn’t have the balls to ask even a word about it when facing Luo Qingcheng.

“Lady Qingcheng, is it true that Jun Wu Xie has the soul bone in her hands? Will it be a lie she deliberately released?” Wei Ya braced himself to open his mouth and asked. He simply couldn’t understand why a little bitch from the Lower Realm would have the soul bone.

“True or not, we will know very soon, you don’t have to ask much,” said Luo Qingcheng in a cold voice. Whether if the soul bone was with her or not, she was still going to take her life!

The humiliations and the torments that Jun Wu Xie brought to her in these five years, she would pay it back one by one!

She wouldn’t be able to get rid of this strong hatred that weighed her heart if she failed to crush Jun Wu Xie into a million pieces!
