The thought that Jun Wu Xie was going to be reprimanded by Nangong Lie excited Guan Hu and the others, and they immediately followed.

Although Zheng Weilong felt that Jun Wu Xie’s attitude was too indifferent, she was not going to say anything in front of the people from the five cities. She could only follow after Jun Wu Xie earnestly.

In the room in the backyard, Nangong Lie was sitting on the soft couch, his handsome face was bloodless, even his lips were extremely pale. It seemed that the whole person was very wan and sallow.

The doctors, who came with the army, was standing next to Nangong Lie. Several of them took turns to diagnose the pulse for Nangong Lie. They have changed the medicine many times but Nangong Lie still looked the same with no improvements.

“Master Nangong, this is stasis of qi and blood, and you still need a lot of cultivation.” An old man with white hair looked respectfully at Nangong Lie and said in a deep voice.

When the old man spoke, the other doctors immediately submitted meekly to his diagnosis.

“Since Divine Doctor Lu said so, I will pay more attention to myself.” Nangong Lie nodded slightly, he was very polite to the one who spoke.

His illness came on suddenly and no one knew why. However, Nangong Lie was very clear on the cause. It was because of that illusion which appeared on the seaside that day, which scared him till he fell ill. If this information spread, he would be the laughing stock for everyone, unfortunately, it was still the truth.

Even Nangong Lie himself didn’t understand why he was so afraid of that person. He only knew that within his lifetime, he never wanted to see her again...

When Divine Doctor Lu ordered other doctors to decoct medicine for Nangong Lie, a slender figure suddenly appeared at the door.

Nangong Lie, who was on the verge of shutting his eyes to rest, suddenly saw the nightmarish from the corner of his eye. It was only for a moment, but he immediately sprung upright from the soft couch, as he stared right into the figure’s eyes, and said in shock, ” It’s you!!”

Nangong Lie’s shout frightened everyone in the room. They couldn’t help but look towards the object of Nangong Lie’s gaze, but they only saw a young man with a handsome face and a thin figure as he stood outside the door without any expression.

“Master Nangong? What’s the matter with you?” Guan Hu and others, who were standing behind Jun Wu Xie, asked nervously when they heard the sudden roar from Nangong Lie, as they rushed up to him one by one, squeezing Jun Wu Xie further to the back of the group.

Nangong Lie was slightly stunned, but completely ignored the questioning of Guan Hu and the others. His eyes only noticed the petite figure by the door.

As petite and thin as was his dream, that figure had contained a terrifying power. However when Nangong Lie saw the person’s appearance clearly, his heart which had leapt to his throat seemed to have suddenly been suspended in mid-air.

Not her!

Not that person!

The figure standing by the door was clearly a handsome young man. Although his appearance was handsome, his looks were far from the glamorous face of that person. Although his eyes were cold, it lacked the ferociousness of that person.

Not her ... Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Nangong Lie suddenly realized what was happening. His entire body collapsed back onto the soft couch as if deflated. He was already very weak, but he was so surprised that his qi and blood were rolling over and over, clashing chaotically within his body. His face turned from white to purple.

Divine Doctor Lu stared at Nangong Lie’s strange behavior and frowned suddenly.

Just now Nangong Lie was still alright, what could have, within a blink of an eye, made Nangong Lie’s face turn so bad?
