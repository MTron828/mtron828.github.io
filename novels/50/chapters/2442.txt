Chapter 2443: He Had No Other Choice (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Earlier when Jun Wu Yao left the Upper Realm, he had been setting up the reversal array in secret. The title “Dark Emperor” and the Dark Region were just a camouflage he used to distract the Upper Realm. All the while, the Lower Realm was the actual place where he carried out his real plans. Only by making use of the unique features of the environment in the Lower Realm, they would be able to constrain the movement of the Upper Realm.

He had been planning and organizing everything for a thousand years. Besides the Night Regime, another force was left in the Lower Realm by Jun Wu Yao – the Ghost Army.

The Ghost Army had never participated in any battle and they would never expose any of their specialities in public. Since the establishment of many countries in the Lower Realm, they had been building up the Ghost Cities surreptitiously as a cloak to set up the reversal array.

Jun Wu Yao had never drawn upon the troop of armies as this was also his most crucial card in dealing with the Upper Realm. He knew it from the outset that the Upper Realm would probably persecute him, and thus, he had ordered the Night Regime beforehand to build his mausoleum in the Lower Realm if he was said to be dead.

And no one had ever realized that the mausoleum of the Dark Emperor was actually meant to be the activation section of the reversal array!

This was the main key of the reversal array which the Twelve Palaces had once tried to search.

Even when it was during the fall of the Dark Emperor thousand years ago, not once did the Ghost Army, hidden in the Lower Realm, take any action. Setting up the reversal array was their one and only mission.

After all, Jun Wu Yao’s plans which he had been mapping out for thousand years had finally kicked in.

Qiao Chu and the others listened to his story in great trepidation. There was no any other words that they could think of except for the word “admiration” filling all over their minds. Whether if it was the means which Jun Wu Yao pulled on or the strategy that was plotted by Jun Wu Xie, it was the kind of fearless attitude that they could never achieve!

No wonder both of them would make it together. They were no ordinary people!

“Big Brother Wu Yao, you’re really something else! This is such a deep hidden card! No wonder Little Xie is able to keep going after suffering through the devastation. It turned out that you have gotten everything ready.” Qiao Chu stroked his chin with enlightenment, not realizing that his words had caused the expression on Jun Wu Yao’s face to change.

Astutely, Hua Yao noticed that the smile on Jun Wu Yao’s face had faded away. He secretly pulled Qiao Chu’s sleeves, asking him to shut up. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Though this was a valiant plan, the sacrifices were so huge that it certainly couldn’t be endured by a normal person.

After receiving Hua Yao’s hint, Qiao Chu quickly realized that he had said something inappropriate and he then looked away awkwardly.

Jun Wu Yao’s expression looked slightly serious. He looked in the direction of Ye Sha who was standing aside and asked. “How has Little Xie been these five years?”

The joy of reunion had diluted the worries he had. But Qiao Chu’s words had led him to suddenly realizing that Jun Wu Xie... might not be having a good time during these five years.

With his face turning pale, Ye Sha lowered his head down without having the courage to speak.

“You tell me,” said Jun Wu Yao while pointing at Ye Mei.

Looking nervously at Jun Wu Yao, Ye Mei didn’t really know how should he respond at the moment.

How had Jun Wu Xie been these five years?

They didn’t even know how to answer the question.

The Night Regime would never lie to the Dark Emperor and that was exactly why they weren’t able to answer him.

They couldn’t tell Jun Wu Yao that Jun Wu Xie had not lived her life well, not even for a bit.

The silence of Ye Sha and the rest had caused Jun Wu Yao’s face to frost. Even though there wasn’t any response, he had already gotten the answer in his mind.

For the past five years, his Little Xie... had not been doing well at all!

He felt a constant pain radiating from his heart. Even though he wasn’t told about her exact condition and he didn’t actually get any answer from them, the moment he thought of Jun Wu Xie not having any good time during these five years, Jun Wu Yao would then get deeply depressed.

“Grandfather.”

All of a sudden, a cold but clear voice came into everyone’s ears.
