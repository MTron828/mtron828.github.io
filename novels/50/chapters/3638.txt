Jun Wu Yao’s words immediately made Luo Qingcheng’s face turn extremely pale in an instant. She clenched teeth tightly and continued looking at him.

He did not recognize her?

He actually said that he did not know her!

Luo Qingcheng’s face had turned a deathly shade of white as she glared at him coldly, like a glacier that had been frozen for tens of thousands of years.

Ren Huang who stood by the side had already been sweating non-stop, Luo Qingcheng had released an oppressive pressure that he had a hard time resisting, and Jun Wu Yao seemed to have taken relish in angering Luo Qingcheng again and again.

Luo Qingcheng took in a deep breath as she tried to suppress the feeling of vomiting blood.

“Ye Jue, I’ve already given you a new choice, now that your strength has been sealed, with your current strength, you are not my opponent at all. I’ve wanted to let you have an easier life, however since you do not know what is good for you, then don’t blame me for being merciless.” She tightened her grip on the reins and straightened her back, refusing to reveal any actions out of the ordinary. However, there was a glint of twisted madness that flashed through her eyes and that made Ren Huang extremely shocked!

Luo Qingcheng...

How did she change to become like this?

It was very hard for Ren Huang to even imagine that the Luo Qingcheng of that year would actually have such a crazy and distorted look in her eyes. At that moment, she seemed to be completely different from the cold and proud woman in his memory. In the eyes of Luo Qingcheng, a flurry of uncontrollable emotions started to brew, extremely dangerous emotions at that.

“Just relying on you?” Jun Wu Yao looked at her in her in disapproval, and contemptuous gaze may her grip her reins even tighter.

It was still such a gaze, for thousands of years.... It had never changed, in his eyes she was still such a small existence...

Luo Qingcheng’s eyes narrowed slightly, the bitter and painful sourness that she had tried so hard to repress in the depths of her heart gradually turned into a twisted wave. She smoothened out her brows, her face relaxed as her lips curled up into a cold smile. That pair of eyes swept around the surroundings.

“It turns out that this treacherous dog is here as well. This saves me a lot of time.” Luo Qingcheng’s gaze fell onto Ren Huang.

Hearing her unpleasant words made Ren Huang’s face slightly stiff. Before he could even react, he had already noticed that Jun Wu Xie who was behind them wanted to rush out. He immediately clasped her wrist and kept her behind, but his face remained the same, unwilling to reveal anything out of the ordinary.

“Luo Qingcheng, you’ve changed.” Ren Huang frowned slightly.

Luo Qingcheng looked at him and suddenly laughed.

“Changed? You are right, I have changed. I became stronger. If I want to kill you now, it is no different from killing a Gold Spirit. Ren Huang, you had the opportunity to gain such strength but you chose to give it up. It’s really lamentable, those who betrayed Master do not have the right to live.” A malicious glint flashed by her eyes.

“Luo Qingcheng, do you really want to help your Master? Don’t you know his true purpose? He wants to sacrifice the three realms! To use Ye Jue as a sacrificial offering, are you really willing....”

“Shut up!” Luo Qingcheng shouted out and interrupted the words that Ren Huang had yet to finish. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“The Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, to shatter the void and take a step into the Realm of Gods. People of your level only harbour your own illusions of cherishing the world, however, you all are too short sighted. Since there is a need for a sacrifice, how could we miss the otherworldly soul? Ye Jue will be sacrificed and you also must die!” Luo Qingcheng’s eyes flashed with twisted madness, and that distortion made her original beautiful face change into one filled with malevolence.
