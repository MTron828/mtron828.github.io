Chapter 2103: The Lull Before the Storm (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Poison Ivy was just as respectful of the Spirit Lord as the Spirit Lord had an upright character and would never be biased towards any of the spirit races. But that kind of a situation had suddenly taken on a subtle change over the past hundred years. Logically, the four spirit races all had a equally relevant presence beside the Spirit Lord, just like the Spirit Master of the human spirits.

But it was not known from when it had started that the Plant Spirits, the Weapon Spirits and the Beast Spirits slowly lost the Spirit Lord’s favour. The leaders of the three spirit races became more distant with the Spirit Lord and only the human spirit’s Spirit Master Wu Jiu remained close by the Spirit Lord’s side, gaining deep trust from the Spirit Lord.

The once balanced relationships had then been broken due to the bias shown by the Spirit Lord and the majority of the resources in the Spirit World began to lean towards the human spirits. It was until the construction of the Serene Spirit Tower, where the first Serene Spirit Tower occupied the territories of other spirit races that the original residents raised a protest up to the Spirit Lord. But the countless number of protests had seemingly sunk like rocks into the vast ocean, causing not even a significant wave upon the waters.

The first Serene Spirit Tower was completed, the second Serene Spirit Tower was completed, the third Serene Spirit Tower was completed.....

As the number of Serene Spirit Towers grew greater in number, the leaders of the three other spirit races besides the human spirits almost had no chance of even being able to see the Spirit Lord, where every audience that they sought did not come back with any response, like the Spirit Lord was fully determined to support the human spirits in their quest to become stronger.

Towards that, from initially feeling puzzled and aggrieved, the other spirit races then came to see that as the norm.

“I do not think that the Spirit Lord is completely unaware of the things happening with the Serene Spirit Tower. The Spirit Lord created this very Spirit World, and every single spirit in here cannot escape his senses. It is not possible that he does not know that the next Spiritual Bear had appeared and he could not possibly be unaware that the Spiritual Bear’s powers was gradually declining.....” All this time, a terrifying guess had always been swirling in Poison Ivy’s heart where it even caused him to develop doubts against the trust he had in the Spirit Lord’s impartiality.

That was a point that was absolutely not permitted to manifest in the Spirit World.

Hence, even if Poison Ivy had spoken his suspicions aloud before Flame Dragon had left, knowing Flame Dragon’s unbending character, Flame Dragon would not have only refused to listen to Poison Ivy, but would have turned hostile against Poison Ivy for doubting the Spirit Lord.

Jun Wu Xie quietly listened to Poison Ivy’s words, and a faint ominous feeling rose up in her heart.

For a sudden change to happen in any being, it always signalled that something unexpected has happened.

Whenever something turns suddenly abnormal it must be the devil at work!

“I could just be thinking too much into it. We’ll know when Flame Dragon comes back.” Poison Ivy said as he shook his head. For so many years in the Spirit World, his unconditional compliance to the Spirit Lord caused him to waver in his own suspicions.

“Or you might not be overthinking it?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

Poison Ivy was startled.

“Help me watch Nalan Shan.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly stood up, and walked over to her companions.

“Little Xie? You do not need to look after Nalan Shan anymore?” Qiao Chu asked with a smile as he looked at Jun Wu Xie walking over.

But there wasn’t the slightest hint of a smile on Jun Wu Xie’s face. She looked up at the dim skies of the Spirit World and her eyes narrowed slightly.

“Have Nalan Shan hidden away immediately.” Jun Wu Xie then said.

“What?” Qiao Chu was taken aback. Hua Yao and the others then came walking over. Jun Wu Xie’s words had drawn their attention.

“There could be a change in plans, and Nalan Shan’s condition would not be able to withstand any further distress.” Jun Wu Xie’s voice had turned cold.

“Little Xie, what has happened? Why are you suddenly saying that?” Rong Ruo could detect the tension in Jun Wu Xie’s tone.

Jun Wu Xie was just about to reply when a tiny speck of a shadow came hurtling down from high up in the sky!Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
