Chapter 3110 Finale 9

The Gods’ Paradise.

Two years had passed since that man appeared and Jun Wu Xie was observing the Three Realms through the God mirror, happy that balance had been restored and the people were happy. She was stroking Little Black in her lap when a sphere suddenly rolled next to her leg.

She looked down at it and was stunned by what she saw.

A pair of sorrowful, pleading eyes belonging to Lord Meh Meh were looking up at Jun Wu Xie, tugging at her skirt.

Before Jun Wu Xie could understand what was going on, she spotted a fair and tender little doll walking drunkenly towards her side, as the little baby grabbed Sacrificial Blood Rabbit in a hold by its tail. The little baby opened its toothless mouth to make some babbling sounds and waved its hands at a bleating Lord Meh Meh who was seeking refuge at Jun Wu Xie’s feet.

“Meh meh meh!” Lord Meh Meh shouted in fright as the baby came closer.

Just as the baby was about to pick up Lord Meh Meh, a large figure appeared behind him and scooped the baby up.

“Ahhh...” The baby released Sacrificial Blood Rabbit’s tail from its hand and continued to make a humming sound.

The baby looked up, saw Jun Wu Yao’s handsome face and stopped making a fuss.

“You shouldn’t have agreed to his suggestion, I told you he was up to no good.” Jun Wu Yao held his baby and walked up next to his wife with an exasperated look on his face.

After they accepted the proposal, both of them became the Gods of this world and Jun Wu Xie summoned the souls of Yan Bu Gui and the rest to become Gods inn to assist to protect the world.

However...

It was no easy feat to bring order to a world that was in such a mess. Even with Qiao Chu and the rest helping, Jun Wu Yao found himself busy beyond expectation and could not find time to spend with his wife. Even the baby that he was holding was born out of stealing some time away.

Jun Wu Xie looked up at her husband and child, her eyes filled with happiness.

When the baby saw its mother, it immediately waved its hands in the air asking for a hug, totally disregarding it’s father.

“Aren’t Little Lotus and the rest helping too?” Jun Wu Xie chuckled.

Jun Wu Yao sighed, their Ring Spirits had become God Ring Spirits, greatly increasing in power, not to mention their own God Powers. The Soul World had been reopened and the Three Realms had also gradually changed. Just that...

“But you’ve been spending less time with me.” Jun Wu Yao complained.

Jun Wu Xie couldn’t help but chuckle at Jun Wu Yao’s pitiful face and waved him close. When he leaned in, he felt a warm and gentle touch on his cheek.

“We still have a long time ahead of us.” Jun Wu Xie said with a smile.

Jun Wu Yao broke into a smile as well and took Jun Wu Xie into her arms, “No matter how long, it won’t be long enough.”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
