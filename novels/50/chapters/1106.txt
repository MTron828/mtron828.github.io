Chapter 1107: “Face Slap – Eleventh Form (9)”

Xiong Ba and the people in the crowd found themselves suddenly bathed in cold sweat. They wanted to stop the attack but with their measly powers, they were finding it difficult to even see Qu Xin Rui’s movements, and they could forget about wanting to stop her.

However, at the very instant that Qu Xin Rui was just about to reach before Jun Xie!

Several figures had suddenly appeared right in front of Jun Wu Xie! They received the full brunt of the attack from Qu Xin Rui and her men!

Purple coloured spirit power light flashed in midair, and five youths with purple spirit power emanating from their bodies appeared suddenly before everyone’s eyes!

Having five Purple Spirits appear at the same time made the entire Thousand Beast City fall dead silent. Everyone was staring in shock with their mouths wide agape as they looked at the five highly handsome looking youths.

They all looked to be only about seventeen to eighteen years of age but the spirit power glow surrounding their bodies shocked everyone right to their bones!

Qu Xin Rui and Shen Chi, together with his men, were forcefully pushed back. And it was only when they landed back on the ground that they noticed the people who had held them back were actually such young youths!

“How is this possible! ?” Qu Xin Rui’s eyes were wide with disbelief! She was actually seeing the all too familiar purple coloured spirit power light upon these youths! When they had clashed earlier, she had been able to feel the powers of the youths. Their spirit powers could not be considered to be that of a true Purple Spirit, but they had employed the method that only existed in the Middle Realm to temporarily raise their spirit powers to breakthrough to the Purple Spirit level!

That unique method, Qu Xin Rui had only witnessed it used in the Middle Realm, and absolutely no one in the Lower Realm knew how to use that!

“All of you are from the Middle Realm!” Qu Xin Rui exclaimed as she stared at the handsome looking youths.

“Whether we are or not, you are not in a position to ask.” Qiao Chu replied as he swung his arms to loosen his muscles, a brow lifted up on his face as he stared at Qu Xin Rui. When Qu Xin Rui had revealed the real reason for Qu Wen Hao’s betrayal earlier, he had already longed to be able to tear this venomous woman into a thousand pieces!

Although he wasn’t really on familiar terms with Qu Ling Yue, but to put such a simple and innocent young girl through such a horrendous and terrifying ordeal, he really could not make himself stand back any longer!

Qu Xin Rui stared at them, her eyes filled with intense hatred. Never in her dreams would she have thought that in the Lower Realm, would she see this bunch of youths who possessed the ability to temporarily raise their spirit power levels!

Although Purple Spirits achieved from such a method, were not comparable to true Purple Spirits, but in a all out brawl, wanting to defeat them within a short period of time would still require quite a big amount of effort from them.

“These are the affairs of the Soul Return Palace and if all of you do not want to get tangled up with trouble, you had better not stick your nose into this!” Shen Chi said with his face creased up in a frown, as he stared at Qiao Chu and the others. He did not believe that this bunch of youths were people from the Lower Realm. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“And what if we insist on courting trouble?” Qiao Chu challenged, his eyes narrowed.

“Do you think we are unable to see through the abnormality in your powers? In an all out battle, how can five of you be a match for us! ?” Shen Chi said through narrowed eyes. Things have progressed to such a stage that exceeded all their expectations. They did not know where this bunch of youths had popped out from, and why were they on Jun Xie’s side.

Shen Chi did not know, but it couldn’t be any clearer to Xiong Ba and Qing Yu who were standing among the crowd!

Standing in front of Jun Xie, were the other five disciples the Zephyr Academy had sent to the Fire Country’s Capital City to participate in the Battle Spirit Tournament!

These bunch of youths had come to the Thousand Beast City together with Jun Xie, but had temporarily split ways just before they entered the city. Xiong Ba knew that this bunch of youths held extraordinary powers, but..... even if you beat him to death, he would never have once thought that the powers of the youths had already reached the Purple Spirit level!
