Qiao Chu just felt his heart taking a strong hit deep inside! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Xie then regained her senses as she looked at Poison Ivy, seemingly trying to digest the news.

Poison Ivy had become highly calm and composed. If truth was to be told, although he did not think all that well of humans, Poison Ivy had to admit that he had a rather good impression of Jun Wu Xie, remembering the time when Jun Wu Xie was carrying the little black cat, the anxiety that showed in her eyes, the kind of deep worry that could not be feigned.

The little black cat was merely another spirit body and it did not look to be all that powerful. But even though that was the case, Jun Wu Xie was still seen to be so anxious for the little black cat. Maybe it was from that day onwards that Poison Ivy was destined to become Jun Wu Xie’s Ring Spirit.

“Mistress seems to have become a lot stronger.” Poison Ivy had already become Jun Wu Xie’s Ring Spirit and he was naturally acutely aware of Jun Wu Xie’s condition. From the level of power of the spirit Jun Wu Xie possessed, he could clearly feel that Jun Wu Xie had grown to become much more powerful compared to before. If not for the fact he knew the amount of time that had elapsed so clearly, Poison Ivy wouldn’t be able to believe that any spirit would be able to grow from a weak and frail new spirit to now reach a stage where she possessed the ability to execute a spirit outflare in just a matter of half a year’s time!

That’s right, now that Jun Wu Xie had stepped into the realm of executing a spirit outflare, looking at all the human spirits throughout the entire Spirit Realm, only four spirits had been able to achieve such a level. But Jun Wu Xie had now become the fifth person so easily and Poison Ivy had no choice but to change his opinion of his new contracted Mistress.

“Mm.” Jun Wu Xie said as she calmed her emotions. It was exactly because her spirit soul’s power had increased in strength that she was able to withstand the arrival of the third Ring Spirit, but the identity of the Ring Spirit..... had truly astounded her.

Just like how Poison Ivy felt, Jun Wu Xie did not feel that much against Poison Ivy as well.

Poison Ivy looked around himself and quickly realized that he was in the Tranquil Dream Forest. He lived just at the outer perimeters of the Tranquil Dream Forest and regarding the fact that Jun Wu Xie and her companions had returned to the Tranquil Dream Forest, he had noticed it but just had not bothered himself with it.

“Will Mistress be remaining here to continue with your cultivation?” Poison Ivy seemed to have quickly accepted the fact that he had become Jun Wu Xie’s Ring Spirit and in truth, he had long discovered that Jun Wu Xie was not a deceased spirit soul and that her flesh body was still living.

“We’ll stay here for a few more days before we will go to the first Serene Spirit Tower.” Jun Wu Xie said with a nod of her head.

Poison Ivy’s brows furrowed slightly. “That is not a suitable place for Mistress to go to.” As he spoke, Poison Ivy’s gaze then turned to fall upon the unconscious little black cat lying at the side.

Because Poison Ivy had become her Ring Spirit, Jun Wu Xie knew the kind of loyalty a Ring Spirit had for their Master and hence she did not need to hide anything from Poison Ivy. She told Poison Ivy everything about what she discovered in the Serene Spirit Tower and her intentions to destroy the first Serene Spirit Tower to save the little black cat.

Poison Ivy listened to everything silently but the creased brow did not relax in the slightest but to knit even more tightly together.

“The Serene Spirit Tower is really such a evil and sinister place.” Poison Ivy had felt that there was something wrong with the Serene Spirit Towers all this time but he had never thought that the Serene Spirit Tower would devour spirits. To the Spirit World, that piece of news was just devastating!

“Isn’t that just the truth! That Wu Jiu is just a heartless and maniacal demon! To think that he could make himself build such a terrifying place so passionately, and had even wanted to use the Spiritual Bear to complete the construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower! He’s absolutely just dreaming. He can just forget about capturing the Spiritual Bear for all his life!” When Wu Jiu and Jiang Yun Long were mentioned, a ball of rage just rose up in Qiao Chu. Because of the Yin Yang Bear, with Brownie being a bear spirit as well, Qiao Chu had come to like Brownie very much! ! !
