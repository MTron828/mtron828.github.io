Jun Wu Xie was really looking forward to the God of Destruction’s reaction when he found out that not only were they not trapped in the Chaos Array, they actually grew stronger in it!

The outside of the temple reeked of blood and inside, the God of Destruction was casually sitting in the high position, resting his chin in one hand.

Below the high position, Feng Ming cut a solitary figure in the hall.

“My Lord, the Chaos Array has been broken, I’m afraid it can’t hold them any longer.”

The God of Destruction waved his hand dismissively, ” That’s ok, Ying’er has returned and brought back the powers of the God of Light and the others, just as I wanted. Even though they’ve broken out, it’s too late to stop the Blood Sacrifice Array of the Three Realms.”

The God of Destruction had a crazed look in his eyes, he had been waiting for this day for a long time.

“But my Lord....” Feng Ming was still a little worried.

But the God of Destruction was in no mood to listen any further, “Have you done what I’ve instructed you to?”

Feng Jing took a moment, then nodded his head and said, “It is done.”

“Then let them come, I want to see what trouble these two sacrificial lambs can cause before they are finally put down. Let them have a last hurrah and an illusion of hope.” The God of Destruction chuckled and the remaining facade of warmth was thoroughly torn down by the venomous expression in his eyes.

“Whether it’s this boring world, or those weak gods, they should have been eradicated a long time ago. The strong survive, why don’t they understand it?”

The God of Destruction’s laughter was low and menacing, sending shivers down the spines of those who heard it.

In the midst of his laughing, both figures appeared at the door of the great hall.

The God of Destruction stopped laughing and looked up at the two people standing at the entryway.

“Welcome, my sacrifices.” The God of Destruction leaned back and crossed his legs, the madness on his face there for all to see.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the face in front of her that was identical to the God of Light’s but only had cruelty on it.

“We have no interest in being sacrifices.” Jun Wu Yao said flatly.

The God of Destruction laughed.

“But you can’t stop this.” He raised his hand and a red mist started coming out of the ground and soon everything around them had taken on a blood red colour.

“You’re too late, Ying’er has already brought me the powers of the God of Light and the others and the Blood Sacrifice Array has started. How can you reverse all of this?”

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. It was hard for her to believe that Gu Ying was really willing to be the pawn of God of Destruction. Previously Gu Ying clearly intended to break free of the control of the God of Destruction, but why did he still fall on the side of God of Destruction?

“You’re really ruthless to use your own son as a pawn.” Jun Wu Yao said.

The God of Destruction paused momentarily before laughing out loud.

“Son? Haha...You’ve got it all wrong Ye Jue. How could he be my son?”
