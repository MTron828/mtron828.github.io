Chapter 86 : Ill Intent (4)”

“Jun Wu Xie, if you do not understand, do not shamefully say such things! This Jade Dew pill is concocted with Qing Yun Clan’s secret recipe, how many people dream of obtaining it but not able to have it.” Mo Xuan Fei could not resist saying, somehow today’s Jun Wu Xie’s remarks had made him feel somewhat uneasy, even his manner of talking had become somewhat chaotic.

Even if he had abandoned her, she should also continue admiring him in her heart, ignoring him like just now, how could she!

Previously she had fawned all over him and was at his beck and call, she was love stricken and everytime she looked at him, her eyes were filled with admiration. That was all in the past, now she treats him like air, this new contrast made Mo Xuan Fei feel irritable.

“Dream of obtaining it but not able to have it?” Jun Wu Xie just made light of what Mo Xuan Fei had said, as her clear eyes were looking at the pair of adulterers hopping about.

That remark sounded very familiar, when they were in Ghost City, didn’t the crowd also use a similar phase, “many wanted but could not get their hands on” with the Qing Yun pill?

In the end, it was still rejected by other people, well, it was that old man who knew his stuff.

“Meow.” Little black cat nestled comfortably in Jun Wu Xie arms as it looked at the pair of adulterers with disdain.

[Really a disgrace, parading out here like fools when they treat such level of pills as rare pills. My Master makes much better quality pills and much better than that master of yours. So what are you even being so proud of? She can easily outdo your master not to mention you.] Little black cat scoffed as it raised it’s little nose in the air full of pride.

Bai Yun Xian had never been mocked by anyone so directly in her entire life and the other party was just a young missy who did not even have the right to hold her shoes?

“This is Miss Jun despises my pill? But this pill was not given to you, you have damaged the Crown Prince’s medicine, I’m afraid it is not appropriate.” Bai Yun Xian proudly glanced over at Mo Qian Yuan, Lin Palace in the country is certainly powerful, but if compared to Qing Yun Clan, they were like ants, if Mo Qing Yuan was not a fool, naturally he would know what to say.

If Jun Wu Xie were to offend Qing Yun Clan Sovereign’s disciple, this was not a wise choice.

Bai Yun Xian looked over at the couple as she started from Mo Qing Yuan and her gaze eventually rested on Jun Wu Xie.

Bai Yun Xian was right, whoever who had brains knew who to choose out of the two, Mo Xuan Fei was a classic example and he chose Bai Yun Xian.

Mo Qian Yuan sneered, “My things are Wu Xie’s things, what she wants to do with it, I do not mind.” Then he looked at Jun Wu Xie warmly, full of affection in a doting manner.

So what if it’s Qing Yun Clan?

Bai Yun Xian and Mo Xuan Fei are close, this was a well known fact, even if this time he had chosen to support Bai Yun Xian, what could he have gained?

Mo Qing Yuan was not a fool, he knew Jun Wu Xie was his real ally.

Bai Yun Xian’s face appeared a hint of surprise, Mo Qing Yuan was obviously standing on Jun Wu Xie’s side.

Mo Xuan Fei secretly gnashed his teeth, he did not know how Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qing Yuan had hooked up together, they have only met each other a few times? If say love at first sight, it should have been at the instance they had first met. But when Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qian Yuan met was at Mo Qian Yuan’s birthday banquet and at that time she had clearly fancied Mo Xuan Fei, not the Crown Prince! This did not happen too long ago and now they are on such close terms?

First Jade Nectar wine was generously being given to Jun Wu Xie, and now he is directly opposing Bai Yun Xian to protect Jun Wu Xie.

Mo Qian Yuan’s brain is not working? To protect Jun Wu Xie, he was not even afraid of offending Qing Yun Clan ?

“It’s only some medicinal pills.” Jun Wu Xie retorted defiantly, she felt that Bai Yun Xian was very funny, she was making a mountain out of a molehill and kicking up such a fuss.

“It’s only some medicinal pills? The way you’ve put it sounds really easy, do you know how much time and effort Yun Xian had spent making those pills? You spoil your cat and pamper it without even doing anything to it. It was your cat that knocked them off the table and yet you don’t want to account for anything. Imperial Brother has already protected you and said not to pursue the matter any further, I naturally did not say anything, but since when could you make such irresponsible remarks? ” Mo Xuan Fei laughed coldly. Mo Qian Yuan looked at Jun Wu Xie’s indifferent expression face and found her dazzling.
