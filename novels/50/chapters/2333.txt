“It’s not a big deal! Just leave it to me! Whatever you want to eat and whatever you want to play, just say the word!” Qiao Chu slapped Long Jiu’s back, the two of them were like long lost brothers and seeing their sudden comradery, Qin Song and Hua Yao who were standing by the side could not help but shake their heads.

It was apparent that...only be these simpleminded people would be so easily attracted to each other....

“Alright, please go ahead with what you were busy with. Old Nine and I will head back first to pack. As for Situ’s words, you don’t have to worry too much about it. He’s always been like this – stubborn and rigid. His heart is wholeheartedly wrapped around the mission given by the Spirit Tree and doesn’t know how to be pragmatic, please don’t mind him.” Qin Song reached out and pulled Long Jiu back as he laughed and exchanged some words with Jun Wu Xie before he left with Long Jiu.

Looking at the back of the Qin Song they left, Fan Zhuo touched his chin and said: “This Qin Song is a smart person.”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Chu grabbed his head, his impression of the Qin Song was not bad. He felt that Qin Song was quite gentle and his temperament was somewhat similar with Fan Zhuo’s, giving people the feeling of a needle hidden in cotton.

“He knows that the seed of the Spirit Tree is in the body of the Little Xie. Even if their means are tough, they can’t grab it forcibly. It is better to follow Little Xie’s whims, lest they infuriate her and cause Little Xie to blow herself up. If that happens, they would have completely failed their mission. That’s why I say that he’s really more intelligent, at least much more than that Situ Heng.” Fan Zhuo could see everything clearly, how well Qin Song treated Jun Wu Xie, or it could be better said to stabilize Jun Wu Xie. After all, the seed is in Jun Wu Xie’s body, they couldn’t be too forceful, otherwise the jade will be burned and they wouldn’t be able to reap anything.

“In any case, I think that Qin Song is much better than that dog shit Situ Heng. How could that guy be so hateful? It’s as if everyone owes him millions of dollars.” Qiao Chu grunted with disapproval, from the first glance, he did not like Situ Heng very much.

“He has always been like this. If not for Qin Song and the Long Jiu suppressing him, we don’t know how much more trouble he’ll stir up.” The moment Ye Gu mentioned Situ Heng, he was also riled up and did not hold back his dissatisfaction. If it was not for Jun Wu Xie needing to learn the cultivation method of the Soul World, he would have already sent people to throw Situ Heng out.

“There’s no need to pay him any heed.” Jun Wu Xie said calmly, she had no need to pay attention to such trifling matters like Situ Heng.

Since Jun Wu Xie had said so, Qiao Chu and the rest naturally did not continue this discussion any further and they could only go back to their residences to pack up and prepare to go back to the Lower Realm.

For this trip back to the Lower Realm, Jun Wu Xie would be bringing all the people of the Night Regime along. When the Night Regime gathered in front of Qiao Chu and the others, they realized that everyone in the Dark Regions...belonged to the Night Regime! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was no wonder ... before, they had felt that the Dark Regions gave people a feeling like a military camp, because there was no ordinary people living here at all. Everyone here had fought in battles!

Because the number of Night Regime was too great, Ye Sha, Ye Mei and Ye Gu each led a group, but their destination was the same. When they stepped out of the Dark Regions, Jun Wu Xie turned around and looked at the place where she had lived for five years – the very place where Jun Wu Yao had built with his own hands.

In the past five years, she had spent her time here and it was a harbor for her to pull herself together. Five years ago, Jun Wu Yao seemed to have expected that something untoward might happen to him so he arranged for Ye Sha and the rest to stand by in the Dark Regions until the last moment. With his departure and her survival, the Night Regime found her, and delivered his intent to her.

This was the biggest bargaining chip left by Jun Wu Yao for her and it was also the driving force behind Jun Wu Xie to keep going on.

The gaze of Jun Wu Xie darkened.

Perhaps Jun Wu Yao had long guessed that under such a heavy blow, she would face despair, so... He left her hope, so that she would not fall into the abyss any further and let her stand up firmly once again.
