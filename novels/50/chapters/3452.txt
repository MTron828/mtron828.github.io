Chapter 2042: Joint Plot

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The reason so many human spirits had come forward was because Wu Jiu had promised one condition, that all human spirits who participated in the construction of the Serene Spirit Tower would enjoy priority access into the tower to cultivate after the Serene Spirit Tower’s construction was completed.

Because of the addictive allure to the Serene Spirit Tower, it drew many human spirits to come rushing forward for conscription. The number was so immense that all the avenues leading towards the outside of the Serene Spirit Tower were filled to almost overflowing.

When Jun Wu Xie and the companions reached the outside of the Serene Spirit Tower, they did not immediately rush over to register for conscription. Rong Ruo quietly released the Hell Butterfly, sending it out to search and locate Nalan Shan. Just before Nalan Shan left, he had told Jun Wu Xie that he would put three wooden chairs outside the house he would be hiding in, and that one of them would only have three legs.

The Hell Butterfly came to know the location very soon and it relayed the information to Rong Ruo. After Rong Ruo ascertained the direction, she immediately led Jun Wu Xie and the others there.

It was a highly inconspicuous little hut, and a ball of orange Spirit Fire was lit upon its roof.

Rong Ruo walked over to the front of the door and rapped upon in rhythmically and in sequence, a code that they had agreed upon with Nalan Shan before as well.

After a few moments, the door was slowly opened a crack and a large furry head peeked through the tiny gap to look at Jun Wu Xie and her companions standing outside. Seemingly finding that it looked to be safe, it then opened the door fully. Behind the door, was the cheetah that was currently nursing its wounds and after it pulled the door open with its paws, it retreated back a few steps.

Jun Wu Xie and the companions then quickly walked inside.

No matter how small the houses in the Spirit World looked from the outside, the wide expanse of space after one walked inside was not something normal people were able to imagine.

In the house, Nalan Shan was seated behind his desk, conscientiously flipping through the books that lay open on the desk. Brownie was seated upon a carpet at the side, and it was not known from where it found a ball made of cane, as it toyed with the ball with its thick and heavy paws. The other three Beast Spirits besides the cheetah were just lying quietly at the side as they rested.

Hearing that someone had entered, Nalan Shan immediately raised up his head. As his gaze passed over Rong Ruo and the other familiar figures, his eyes finally rested upon the figure of Jun Wu Xie.

His eyes were tinged with a trace of surprise, as he did not seem to remember having seen this young lady before.

“It’s me.” Jun Wu Xie opened her mouth to say.

Hearing the familiar voice, Nalan Shan immediately breathed out in relief. He knew better than to go ask Jun Wu Xie how she had managed to change her looks but instead went on to say warmly: “Quickly take a seat first. How is the situation out there recently?”

Ever since that day that Nalan Shan had brought Brownie away in escape, they had found this little hut and had been hiding in here. To avoid being discovered by Jiang Yun Long, he had not once stepped out through the door throughout the entire period.

Not to mention just Nalan Shan, but even the cheetah and the other Beast Spirits had not dared to step outside as well, as they had shown their faces before Jiang Yun Long before.

“The situation has not yet become that bad, but Wu Jiu and Jiang Yun Long have really been just too much. When they could not find you, they then sought to capture Little Xie to interrogate her. Because of that, Little Xie had no choice but to change her looks. Those two fellas are just abominable.” Qiao Chu immediately vented his grouses without holding back.

When he heard that Jiang Yun Long wanted to capture Jun Wu Xie, Nalan Shan’s eyes flashed with a sliver of surprise. He stared in shock at Jun Wu Xie, his eyes seemingly apologetic.

“I’m sorry, I have dragged you into this.”

“Gurgle.....” Brownie who had been focused on playing with its toy seemed to understand what Qiao Chu and Nalan Shan were saying and it shifted its enormously rounded behind to come right next to Jun Wu Xie, as it raised up a furry paw to paw at Jun Wu Xie’s calf.

Jun Wu Xie rubbed Brownie’s large furry head and said in a calm voice: “There’s nothing to be sorry about. Even if it’s not because of you, I will still end up coming against them sooner or later.”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
