Chapter 1019: “A Young Girl’s Heart”

In the subsequent few days in the Thousand Beast City, life could only be described as dry and uneventful for Jun Wu Xie. She almost never left her room and even Qing Yu did not see not see any sign of Jun Xie in the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall.

Everytime he suggested to Jun Xie to bring him out on a tour of the Thousand Beast City, he was quickly rejected by Jun Xie.

That had however freed up some time for Qing Yu to deal with some of the tasks his position required of him that had accumulated up previously.

Qu Ling Yue came down to the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall on the fifth day after Jun Xie came to the Thousand Beast City. She knocked on Jun Xie’s room door as she stood uneasily before it.

“Young Master Jun, are you in there?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The room door was slowly opened and Jun Xie appeared before Qu Ling Yue. And that one glance almost made Qu Ling Yue laugh out loud. Jun Wu Xie after having altered her looks disguised as a boy, could still be considered to be delicately attractive looking. But the delicate features on that face was always tinged with a slight chill which made the boy feel rather unapproachable. But at that moment.....

Jun Xie was carrying the round wooly Lord Meh Meh in his arms, while upon his left and right shoulders, were perched the little black cat and a snow white big eared rabbit. At first glance, those three adorable little fellows had instantly added quite a significant level of amusement to Jun Xie’s otherwise chilling demeanor.

Qu Ling Yue tried to hold herself back with much difficulty before she was able to not laugh out aloud.

“Come in.” Jun Wu Xie said expressionlessly.

Qu Ling Yue followed the youth in behind obediently and immediately upon entering, she could smell a faint fragrance of herbs. The scent was very nice smelling but when she swept her gaze over the entire room, she could not spot any traces of herbs at all.

“Something you need?” Jun Wu Xie asked, putting Lord Meh Meh upon the table, before picking up the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit and the little black cat to put them on the table as well. Fortunately, Guardian Grade Spirit Beasts were able to alter their weight as well when transforming their bodies or with her thin arms and slender legs, it would really be rather tedious to carry around all three of those adorable looking beasts.

“Erm, it will be the end of the month soon and Father made me come to ask whether you have any plans made.” Qu Ling Yue said, looking at Jun Xie, the smile upon her face from earlier had faded, her expression stern and serious.

At the end of every month, Qu Xin Rui would bring all those people she had released at the beginning of the month back out of the city and release another batch of prisoners only in the beginning of the next month. If they wanted to find out where Qu Xin Rui imprisoned all the people of the Thousand Beast City, that was the only window period that allowed them to do anything to find out.

“No.” Jun Wu Xie answered very calmly.

Qu Ling Yue was slightly shocked. Jun Xie had been in the Thousand Beast City for several days now and she had not seen him take any action. It was not that she did not believe in Jun Xie’s capabilities, but as she knew absolutely nothing about what the youth was planning, she could not help but feel slightly uneasy about it.

“Aren’t you going to meet with any of the people who came back from there? And try to ask where they had been imprisoned?” Qu Ling Yue asked cautiously with trepidation.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head. “As the entire Thousand Beast City has fallen under the control of that person, anyone who comes in contact with those people would be discovered by that person. Moreover..... if she dared to release those people, it would mean all those people has no idea where they had been imprisoned. It would just be a waste of time to ask them and only serve to alert the enemy instead.”

The proper way to resolve the predicament the Thousand Beast City was facing, would be from outside, and not from within.

Qu Ling Yue then said: “Young Master Jun has guessed it correctly. For all those people who had been released, their family members had asked the released prisoners and tried to decipher where they had been hidden in imprisonment but none of them were able to tell them anything. After they were sent out of the Thousand Beast City, all of them would quickly be knocked out and by the time they regained their consciousness, they were already back in captivity.”
