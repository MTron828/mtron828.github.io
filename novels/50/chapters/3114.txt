Chapter 3115 Can I Hug You?

Jun Qing was stumbling over himself and had to be helped to his room by Long Qi who was almost as drunk as him. The men from the Ruilin Army, while sore that the flower in their midst had been taken away, acknowledged that it was by a man they ultimately admired and stopped making a fuss.

The banquet was nearing its end, and the crowd started to disperse.

As a member of the Jun household, Jun Wu Xie sent off the guests with Jun Gu and the rest of the family.

A figure walked hesitantly towards the main door of the Jun residence.

“May I have a few words with you?” Qu Ling Yue said to Jun Wu Xie, who despite becoming a mother and showing some weariness from the years that have passed, she still looked as radiant as she did in her past.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head, passed her tired child to Jun Wu Yao and walked together with Qu Ling Yue to the backyard.

Lei Chen, who had arrived at the banquet with Qu Ling Yue, did not follow them. But as she stood at the doorway watching them walk away, his heart was overcome with bitterness.

Jun Wu Xie and Qu Ling Yue strolled in the garden under the moonlight and the flowers, seemingly aware of her godly presence, seemed to bloom even brighter.

The red silk was hung high and as people were leaving, the Jun family’s joy was obvious but their joy was not shared by everyone present.

Qu Ling Yue and Jun Wu Xie both said nothing as they walked through the garden and sat down. Both beauties had completely opposite demeanors.

Qu Ling Yue had long cast away the image of a young, naive woman after going through her numerous trials and tribulations and no full blooded man would dare to underestimate her.

She was a steel blooded queen, and was no longer the Qu Ling Yue of old, a spoiled girl from a big city.

It was only at this moment, as she was seated next to Jun Wu Xie, that a smile could be seen on her face. Their long shadows, cast by the moonlight, made them seem worlds apart despite the fact that they were so close to each other.

“I grew up in the Thousand Beasts City. Although my mother died young, my father loved me greatly and never let me suffer any hardship. I believed the world was good and the occasional flash of evil I saw had nothing to do with me. My father used to say that when I got older, I should find a man that truly loves me and is devoted to my happiness and that it didn’t matter whether he was rich or talented.” Qu Ling Yue said with a laugh, her shadow moving in unison with her.

“I never thought I would experience what I did, even know it still feels like a nightmare, like it wasn’t real. But I can’t deny that it did happen although now I can’t remember everything that happened, maybe it’s my subconscious trying to forget it.

Qu Ling Yue’s voice cracked. She turned to look at Jun Wu Xie who was looking at her calmly and silently but could feel an unmistakable gentleness in the look.

The gentleness...

Made her feel like crying.

“Wu Xie.” Qu Ling Yue said softly.

“Yes?”

“Can...I give you a hug?” Qu Ling Yue’s voice was barely audible and trembling ever so slightly.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
