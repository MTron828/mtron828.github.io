Jun Wu Xie locked herself up in a room and did not allow anyone else to come close. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

They were pressed for time and after speaking with Su Jing Yan, she had a thorough understanding of the entire situation at hand. If she could, she was not willing to let Jun Wu Yao have a hand in this that was why she had to come up with another solution. She had to personally prepare for the fight against those thousand Gold Spirits.

Reaching the realm of the Gold Spirit was so powerful that it was beyond an ordinary person’s imagination. Not only did the powerful spiritual power give them strength, but it also shielded and protected their bodies.

Jun Wu Xie took out all the herbs that were stored in the Cosmos Sack, fortunately it was big enough and she had the habit of bringing all these things with her all the time which was why she had all these on her.

She was not so stupid to strike something hard with brute force. If she really did that, it was imperative that Jun Wu Yao would have to be involved so she decided to utilise what she was best skilled in and use all her knowledge in the concoction of medicine as well as poison to minimise this possibility.

The most poisonous herbs, the most toxic juices and the most poisonous powders, she started to think of all the poisons that she could remember and started to work.

Now that she was about to become a Gold Spirit herself, she had a better understanding on how powerful and resistant a Gold Spirit was towards poison. To poison a Gold Spirit, not any ordinary poison would suffice.

Over and over again, Jun Wu Xie delved into a state of enlightenment as she continued to experiment poison after poison, as the surroundings around her seem to blur into nothingness. She concentrated fully to concocting the poison, putting it all in this last strike!

The little black cat lay quietly by the side, with it, there was Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit. The three stayed there in dumb silence as they were afraid that they would disturb her.

A thick scent of herbs permeated throughout the entire house, tinged with bitterness. Due to their heightened sense of smell, this strong scent made Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit extremely uncomfortable. The little black cat was a soul and hence it was not the least bit affected but it had a great impact on Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit.

Jun Wu Xie was trying to formulate a poison that could affect a Gold Spirit, so even if it was just a tiny whiff, the toxicity was deadly. However, Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit were stubborn and refused to budge, although they weren’t telepathic like the black cat and Jun Wu Xie, however, they could feel her fervent sense of anxiety.

Seeing that those two silly fluffballs had been smouldered with the various smells that their expression had long turned listless, the little black cat immediately morphed into the black beast and grabbed them with it’s jaws and threw them out.

“Meh!!”

Lord Meh Meh immediately protested and scuttled to return into the room, similarly, the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit hopped back in an attempt to slip back in. However, with a swish of its claws, Little Black blocked their way.

“The things inside are harmful to you, I know that you don’t care but we need you to conserve your energy and be at your best condition otherwise you won’t be able to help Mistress at all.” A glint of determination flashed by its eyes, being the companion that stayed by her side for the longest time, from the past life to the present life, they had never separated. It knew best what she was going through right now and how anxious she felt.

Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit understood the words of the little black cat and no longer dared to clamour. They could only plop sullenly to the ground and guard silently by the door.

The little black cat glanced at them before returning into the room. It then lay down, just like the past where countless years had gone by, with it quietly accompanying her by her side.

No one knows more than the little black cat on how she was feeling at the moment, in the past, she had no attachments. No matter what she did, she only needed to do it in the most effective way. However, now that she had family, friends and even a loved one, she had to ensure their safety.
