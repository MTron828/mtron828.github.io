“Master Gu, what movements are the in the Nine Temples?” One young man from the Rui Lin Army looked at Gu Li Sheng and asked.

Gu Li Sheng shook his head and said, “The Nine Temples are completely controlled by the Upper Realm, no matter what, they are just mere puppets.”

The bloody battle that happened that year at the Cloudy Brook Academy, Ba He and his people had all been completely annihilated and did not reveal the traitorous acts of the Nine Temples. However, the people from the Upper Realm were no fools. If Ba He and his people had been completely annihilated, how could the Nine Temples escape almost unscathed? Although there was no conclusive evidence, they had already discovered their disloyalty, therefore, after the incident at the Cloudy Brook Academy, all nine of the Nine Temple Lords had been arrested and had used their lives to threaten the fate of the Nine Temples.

From that day that the Nine Temples started to unify the Middle Realm, the forces of the Nine Temples had been controlled by the Upper Realm. Now that the one’s leading them were not the original Nine Temple Lords, but personnel specially selected by the Upper Realm. They had gained full control over the Nine Temples and had used them to control the entire Middle Realm with an iron fist. Now, it could be said that the entire Middle Realm had turned into a plaything in the hands of the Upper Realm. Everything was for the construction of the rune totems for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms.

“About Young Miss... is there still no news?” Another man could not help but ask.

A faint glint flashed by Gu Li Sheng’s eyes, eventually, he could only sigh helplessly as he shook his head and replied, “No, there is none at all.”

It had been five years, over the past five years, they had found all the Spirit Jade Palace disciples that had been scattered all around but there was still no news of Jun Wu Xie at all. It was as if she had evaporated from the world, no matter how much manpower and resources they had used, they could not find a single trace at all.

“Heaven helps the worthy, Young Miss would definitely be safe and sound. We only need to do everything that we should and I believe that Young Miss would come back one day!” That soldier of the Rui Lin Army had on an unwavering gaze, he strongly believed that she was still alive and she was somewhere in the Middle Realm. She did not appear because she had something even more important to do, there would definitely be one day that she would appear once again and bring them miracles!

That soldier’s words was like every other soldier in the Rui Lin Army, no one believed that she had died. In a sense, no news was good news!

“That’s right! We will all wait for Young Miss to come back!” As if cheering on, another young man also said in a determined tone. They saw that same affirmation in each other’s eyes. What they believed was the truth that remained unchanged in their hearts.

Gu Li Sheng looked at the unwavering gazes of the soldiers before him, there was a hint of gratification within. He still remembered the moment when the news of Jun Wu Xie’s disappearance had reached the Lower Realm. The entire Lin Palace had been smothered in silence. Gu Li Sheng was present at that time and after Qu Ling Yue had told them everything, Jun Xian and Jun Qing had remained dead silent. Just when everyone thought that the two closest relatives of Jun Wu Xie would suffer a devastating blow, Jun Xian stood up with resolution.

“Wu Xie is the child of the Jun family and would not be so weak. Since now that the crisis of the Three Realms is approaching, how could we, who are part of it just stand by and do nothing? Hear my orders, all soldiers of the Rui Lin Army are to be on alert. Before we find Wu Xie, it is necessary that we stabilize the situation. Although we cannot compare to the Upper Realm in terms of strength, but we cannot let them do as they please!”
