Chapter 2987 The four knights 6

“Abandon all my memory? How does this work?” Jun Wu Xie asked dubiously.

Chi Yan’s eyes fell on Su Ruiying aside.

“If you make up your mind, go and find Ying, she will tell you what to do.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly, and looked at Su Ruiying on the side. In those gray eyes, she could not see any fluctuations in emotions, nor did she know that Su Ruiying’s temperament was caused by it. .

With doubts in her heart, Jun Wu Xie sat quietly in the hall. The banquet that was hosted by Chi Yan, compared with the others, was extremely deserted, without singing and dancing. There were only a few of them in the entire hall. No one spoke except the sound of pouring water and the sound of chewing.

After explaining His Lord’s instructions, Chi Yan no longer paid any heed and never looked up at Jun Wu Xie again. Su Ruiying looked at Jun Wu Xie from time to time, but her gaze was strange. It was the fiery Long Yao who kept his eyes on Jun Wu Xie the entire time since she entered the hall.

It was understood that even a man frivolous like Long Yao could be suppressed. Chi Yan’s position in front of His Lord was self-evident.

Jun Gu didn’t say anything in the whole process. He behaved just like any person who was dragged along, either drinking or eating food, He did not look at Jun Wu Xie. Naturally, people couldn’t notice any strange signs at all. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It’s my pleasure to see my future colleagues today. But, it’s late at night. If you have nothing to do with Chi Yan, I’ll go back first.” Jun Gu stood up.

Chi Yan raised his head and looked at Jun Gu.

Long Yao sneered: “I know that Jun Gu has married the beauty of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, have you been so reluctant to the entire day?”

The smile on Jun Gu’s face dissipated and the gaze towards Long Yao became sharper. His whole momentum seemed to change in an instant, like the blade suddenly unsheathed.

Long Yao’s expression stiffened. Fortunately, Chi Yan said in a timely manner: “Okay, there is nothing else tonight. Jun Gu you go back first.”

Jun Gu then narrowed his eyes and left the hall.

Looking at Jun Gu’s back, Long Yao couldn’t help but frowned. “Towards the woman who once defected, this Jun Gu still regards her as a treasure.”

Chi Yan glanced at Long Yao and said nothing.

“It’s not too early today, Yan Hai. If you have anything in the future, please contact Ying. After your first session, I will arrange you to go meet His Lord.” Chi Yan had no further patience for tonight’s banquet as he directly sent all his guests back.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t have the intention to stay any longer. After a few words, she got up and left. Long Yao and Su Ruiying also left.

When walking to the gate outside Chi Yan’s Mansion, Long Yao passed Jun Wu Xie. The tall body consciously wanted to crash into Jun Wu Xie, but Jun Wu Xie shunned him cleverly, causing him to look at her in a disgruntled manner and unwilling to take a big step away.

“Long Yao’s heart is very narrow. If you provoke him, there will be a lot of trouble in the future.” Su Ruiying’s voice came from behind Jun Wu Xie at this moment.

After she spoke, Su Ruiying had reached Jun Wu Xie’s side and her strange eyes gently swept across Jun Wu Xie’s body.
