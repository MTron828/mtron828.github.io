Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In the Lower Realm, everything was as usual.

Qu Ling Yue walked through the military camp and watched the soldiers in the training field. There was no expression on her cold and indifferent face. Lei Chen stood behind her and looked at the powerful woman before him, there was unconcealed appreciation in his eyes. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ever since Qu Ling Yue became the Empress of the Fire Country to after unifying the entire Lower Realm, there was not a single thing people could fault her.

Because of the tragic past of Qu Ling Yue, she had been abandoned by everyone from the Thousand Beast City. They had come to realize their stupidity and narrowmindedness after some reflection. The Grand Chieftain of the Thousand Beast City had sent the Xiong Ba to meet Qu Ling Yue on many occasions. He just wanted to ask Qu Ling Yue to return to the Thousand Beast City once again for the father and daughter pair to reunite.

However, no matter how many times Xiong Ba had came, Qu Ling Yue had completely avoided meeting him.

The past her had already died in Thousand Beast City in that horrendous nightmare. Today, the Qu Ling Yue who was well and alive had only one identity – Jun Wu Xie’s wife and the Iron Blood Empress who unified the Lower Realm whom everyone admired and feared!

No one would have thought that the shy girl who flushed easily when she saw handsome men would grow up in just a few years and become the Iron Blood Empress whom everyone feared. She was tough and strong and for many years, no one had ever seen her tears. It was as if she had abandoned all earthly emotions and lived as an absolutely strong figure. This was the current Qu Ling Yue in all the rumours going around.

“Tomorrow, let everyone take a day off.” She rarely spoke but after she checked the training of this group of soldiers, she had granted them a day of rest.

In the past five years, through countless crazy training, the army of the Lower Realm had completely transformed and was turned into the invincible Iron Blood Army. Qu Ling Yue’s way of governing the army was learned from Lin Palaceand had been perfectly replicated by her. Now her army was not inferior to the Rui Lin Army which was known as the Number One Berserker Force.

“Yes.” Lei Chen replied amenably.

Lei Chen had personally watched Qu Ling Yue’s transformation, from the young girl on the verge of collapse to become one of the most powerful people of the Lower Realm. He was very well aware that there were only three words that supported Qu Ling Yue to persist on and achieved everything in the present- Jun Wu Xie.

She had grown so strong, all in order to be able to stand by the side of Jun Wu Xie. All that she had strived on and persisted on was in hope that one day, she could protect Jun Wu Xie from wind and rain.

Qu Ling Yue gave up any forms of weakness and put down the gentleness of a woman, only to hold and protect everything that Jun Wu Xie had entrusted to her.

Becoming strong all for one person.

Now that things have reached this stage, in this world, no one dared to ever use her past to discredit her. Those that ridiculed her in the past have already been shocked into silence by all her achievements.

Looking at her elegant and cool face from the side, the undisguised appreciation in Lei Chen’s eyes could not help but mixed with a tinge of infatuation. After Fire Country disappeared, he stayed in the army out of habit and assisted Qu Ling Yue, staying by her side as a Deputy General. He had been watching her but he did not realize that his gaze had already been attracted by the figure of this woman and that familiar figure had been unknowingly branded in his heart.

Of course...

He couldn’t say anything.

Because, he knew very well that in her heart, there was an existence that no one could replace – Jun Wu Xie.

That person who once made her obsessed, saved her from despair and even married her when she was abandoned by everyone else.

No one could replace Jun Wu Xie’s position in her heart.

“Master’s Wife!” A crisp voice rang out as a petite pretty figure bounced happily and was soon in the sight of Qu Ling Yue and Lei Chen.
