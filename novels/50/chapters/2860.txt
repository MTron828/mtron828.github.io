In fact, Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei’s considerations were right. Their status in the Upper Realms were almost incomparable. If they could join forces, Jun Wu Xie’s actions in the Upper Realm would be much smoother.

Jun Wu Xie knew in her heart that she had just found her parents. Subconsciously, she knew she wanted to keep her parents away from danger.

“Dear daughter, just give up. No matter what you say, your father and I have already decided. Two days later, your father and I will get married. It’s such a good opportunity, I don’t want to miss it!” Han Zi Fei apparently noticed Jun Wu Xie’s mind and smiled.

Jun Wu Xie looked at her parents for a long time and finally nodded in silence.

Han Zi Fei smiled with satisfaction, took a few steps forward, picked up the copper ball that had been thrown in the snow again. She handed it to Jun Gu.

“Take it, Knight of Destruction.” Han Zi Fei teased.

Jun Gu’s face became red again after trying so hard to look serious. He hurriedly reached out to take the copper ball and hung it on his waist.

“Oh, gifts given by other girls are so precious?” Han Zi Fei raised an eyebrow slightly in taunt. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jun Gu’s fingers froze and looked at Han Zi Fei in shock.

“No ... No, that Yan Xi was assigned by His Lord to control me with this thing ...” Jun Gu replied and he wanted to take it off.

Han Zi Fei couldn’t help laughing. She waved her hand and said, “I won’t tease you anymore, I understand, but that little maiden is not as simple as you think she is. Today, I can see that her eyes are spewing fire at me. ”

Jun Gu said rightly, “In my eyes and heart, you are the only one.”

“Fool.” Han Zi Fei chuckled.

Jun Wu Xie silently looked at her parents showing affection. Suddenly she understood Qiao Chu’s feelings.

“But now you can’t let anyone know about your recovery including Yan Xi. Before you think of a way to deal with her, you can act like how you usually do.” Han Zi Fei said with grievance and sighed.

Jun Gu was anxious again as he started to show his loyalty and affection to his beloved wife.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao had both calmed down. Jun Wu Xie had restored peace in her heart. Suddenly, she said, “I’ll take care of Yan Xi’s affairs.”

“Oh?” Han Zi Fei glanced at her own daughter and a suspicion came to her mind. She couldn’t help laughing.

“Then I will leave her to you.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded decisively.

In order not to interrupt Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu’s reunion, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao decisively left the Sacred Maiden Hall, leaving this enchanting moonlit night to her long-lost parents.

Out of the Sacred Maiden Hall, Jun Wu Xie looked at the bright moonlight, as her lips curled up in happiness. Jun Wu Yao looked at her quietly, and his heart was warmed by her smile.

“Come with me, let me bring you somewhere.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

Without a word, Jun Wu Yao nodded.

He thought that the reunion and affection of his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, his little wife would finally stroll with him under the moonlight. Jun Wu Yao was full of hope and came to the residence of another maiden with Jun Wu Xie. The smile on his face disappeared without a trace.

Jun Wu Xie even took him to Han Shu’s residence!

Han Shu’s room was lit with lights. From the figure falling from the window, it could be seen that a guest was sitting in Han Shu’s room at the moment.
