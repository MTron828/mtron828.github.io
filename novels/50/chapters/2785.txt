Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The few top generals frowned slightly. For some reason, they had an unprovoked disgust for Jun Wu Xie’s cloudless and light-hearted expression. What they wanted was not her calmness. Instead, he wanted to see Jun Wu Xie’s fear. They longed to wait for her to kneel and beg for mercy.

Unfortunately, Jun Wu Xie did not do what they had wished for.

Her eyes always made them have an illusion. As if ... it was them who were about to be killed, and it was them who were caught in the dead.

This feeling of disharmony makes them very uncomfortable!

“How? Are you getting impatient and so eager to die? Treasure all that you hear now. Because it won’t be long before you become a dead person. No matter how we scold you, you will not be able to live to hear it ... “A general sneered, and Jun Wu Xie’s indifferent face always made him have the urge to crush it.

“Hahaha.” A group of people were laughing and showed no respect for the opponent at all. They were completely cruel and dismissive.

Jun Wu Xie slowly raised her eyes and looked at the general who was the first to scream. In the next second, her figure disappeared suddenly!

Several generals noticed Jun Wu Xie’s move. They stopped laughing immediately!

“Good boy, are you really in a hurry to reincarnate? I’ll help you!” The general hummed arrogantly.

When his words had just come out, there was a strange feeling of coldness in his neck. He raised his hand subconsciously to touch his neck. His fingertips could not feel the unexpected coldness instead, but a sticky and warm touch ...

Uh ...

The harsh gurgling sound of water pierced the eardrums of everyone, the dazzling blood red spilled overwhelmingly, and a little warm and sticky liquid dripped on the faces and hands of those soldiers. They turned their heads subconsciously, but saw ...

The general who was still in front of Jun Wu Xie had already become a headless dead body. The head fell down on the horse’s hoof mixed with mud and blood, while his body was sitting upright on the horse’s back. A large swath of blood was sprayed on the neck, gushing towards the sky several meters high!

“What’s ... happening ...” Another general who was close had been sprayed with warm blood and he was dyed entirely in the scarlet blood as his eyes widened in horror, finally realizing that he was half a meter away from the lopped off head, and only at the moment when blood splashed on him, that person was already dead!

When did it happen? How was it that he didn’t even notice it!

Death came so suddenly, it was unexpected.

No one noticed when Jun Wu Xie approached or when the general’s head was lopped off. When they returned to their senses and looked up, Jun Wu Xie had disappeared instantly. She once again stood in her original position. Her silver light armor had not been stained with any trace of blood, all she held in her hand was a gleaming long sword, which had beads of fresh blood trickling down.

The deep crimson blood looked so beautiful and terrifying at the same time under the illumination of the sun!
