After Fang Jinghe landed, he immediately raised his head. But when he saw the picture in front of him, he was stuck in place in an instant.

The boy who was kicked and kicked by him suddenly stood up again. It was even more unbelievable for Fang Jinghe that it was Fei Yan’s spirit aura!

The spirit energy could be controlled by its owner and enveloped his body. This was what Fang Jinghe knew. But ... he never knew that the diffused spirit energy could be embodied! !! !!

At this moment, the aura enveloping Fei Yan’s body went straight into the sky and turned into a giant ape. At this moment, his eyes became beastly. The two fangs in his mouth were sharp. At this moment, his whole muscles swelled. His wide clothes almost burst open. The slate floor under his feet had already deepened and sank down.

But at the blink of an eye, Fei Yan’s appearance seemed to have completely changed. From the previous handsome young man, he had turned into a beast!

This weird scene made Fang Jinghe completely dumbfounded. He asked himself that he was knowledgeable enough. He had never seen such a strange thing. What even more shocked Fang Jinghe was Fei Yan’s spirit energy .

Fei Yan had just condensed a degree of spiritual inscriptions. Although it seemed very powerful to others, it was not worth mentioning in the eyes of Fang Jinghe. But at this moment, the spirit energy on Fei Yan seemed to have multiplied several times in an instant. That kind of spirit energy, a force that Fang Jinghe completely did not understand ...

Unfamiliar but crazy.

Rong Ruo looked at Fei Yan in front of her blankly. The face like a beast, the sharp fangs were imprinted in her eyes. Others may not know it, but she was clearly aware of it. At this point, Fei Yan seemed to have been integrated with his Ring Spirit. Isn’t that silhouette of an ape the same as Fei Yan’s Ring Spirit? !!

“You are not allowed to touch her !!!” Fei Yan gritted his teeth and roared at Fang Jinghe.

Fang Jinghe’s eyes regained peace from surprise. The meaning of the previous drama also disappeared at this moment. His eyes became extremely sharp, and his momentum had completely changed.

“What the hell are you, kid?”

“Do you mean... this is the effect of the elixir of the Sea Spirit City? The Dual Spirit Ring exponent... strange weird power ... it really makes one... full of curiosity!” Fang Jinghe’s eyes narrowed slightly. His figure disappeared in the spot in an instant, like a thunder light, heading towards Fei Yan!

Fei Yan growled and raised all the power to the apex. He retreated and rushed towards Fang Jinghe.

Suddenly, the two men’s figures rushed together in an instant!

Rong Ruo’s eyes stared at the two entangled figures, and her fists secretly clenched on the ground.

Faster!

Hurry up!

Fei Yan, who had suddenly improved in his strength, could actually fight with Fang Jinghe. This change, even Fang Jinghe was very surprised. The sudden increase of power was too strange. No such thing ever happened!

But...

Fang Jinghe’s eyes flashed a poisonous light. Under Fei Yan’s attack, he suddenly opened his mouth, a dark poison sprayed out from his mouth and directly onto Fei Yan’s face !
