Chapter 2650: I’m The City Lord (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Big brother, that’s the son of Yan Wan.” The man nudged the fouled-mouth, brawny man.

The brawny man was named Xu Zu and he was considered a strong exponent in Long Xuan City because of his capabilities in handling matters. And thus was held in high regard by the Lord of Long Xuan City, and so he was nominated to head to Sea Spirit City to demand for the Sea Spirit Beasts.

Xu Zu curled his lips in disgust. He looked at Jun Wu Xie from head to toe and he did not bother to hide his scorn.

This kid seemed young, with delicate features that did not align with being a powerful Lord. Yan Wan was not considered one of the strongest among the seventy-two city lords, but few people could be comparable to his ruthless and malevolent inclinations. The matter of Yan Wan’s few sons who died during infancy was well-known within the seventy-two cities. Everyone knew that it was Yan Wan’s fear of his sons surpassing his own strength and usurp his position that drove him to strike first in order to ‘gain an upper hand’.

The only one left was Yan Hai, but it was because at that time when he was born, his innate talent was very average and that saved his life.

A little brat that Yan Wan did not spare a thought to, how could he have good prospects?

Xu Zu was very disapproving, and the look on his face was unchanging. He did not care if he was sitting in front of the Young Lord of the Sea Spirit City. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Yan Hai is it? We are not looking for you, but your old man, Yan Wan. Don’t dawdle with us, we are not interested in engaging in pointless conversation with you! Hurry and call your old man out! The fouled-mouth, brawny man shouted.

On one side, Fan Zhuo frowned slightly, but did not say anything. Qiao Chu and others, who were hiding in the back hall, were observing the movements in the hall through a small dark hole. They were all curious at how Jun Wu Xie was going to deal with the group from Long Xuan City

Jun Wu Xie sat calmly on her chair, with a light and airy look about her. She unhurriedly took the cup of tea from the table and took a sip, with a look of contentment, as if she did not hear Xu Zu curse them out.

“Little imp, did you hear what I was saying?!” Xu Zu glared at Jun Wu Xie. Although his strength was not as powerful as the Lord of Long Xuan Cheng, but he was considered as top among the Gold Spirits. In the end, he was ignored by Jun Wu Xie, a young brat, and he felt he had ‘lost face’.

Disregarding whether Jun Wu Xie was the Young Lord of the Sea Spirit City or not, to the other people in the city, the two words ‘Young Lord’ was not even a consideration. In the dog-eat-dog world of the Upper Realm, the father-son relationships are far less close as compared to that of the Lower Realm or Middle Realm. Even if one was now a Young Lord, it was not implausible that her father had taken precautions against her. It was commonplace to remove an important chess piece.

Xu Zu naturally would not even bother with the Young Lord, Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie was still slowly drinking tea from her cup, her cold eyes lifted slightly and started impatiently at Xu Zu.

“Who are you looking for?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Xu Zu impatiently said: “We are looking for the Lord of Sea Spirit City, not the Young Lord. Do you have bad hearing? Do you not understand?”

Jun Wu Xie’s eyebrows were slightly lifted, and the empty cup was placed on the table, and she rested her chin on one hand, as she stared unruffled at Xu Zu, “I am the Lord of Sea Spirit City.”

“What?” Xu Zu was dumbfounded. He looked at Jun Wu Xie and could hardly believe what he had heard.
