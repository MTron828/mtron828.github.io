As the battle raged on, every move that Jun Wu Xie made, Luo Qingcheng could only defend and that was causing Luo Qingcheng to get increasingly frustrated.

“You want to kill me? Just based on your skills!” Luo Qingcheng derided, as the glow of her Spirit Ring suddenly increased in intensity – the intensity was like that of a glowing star burst.

Once Wei Ya, who was standing not far from them, saw that glare, his heart gave shudder in shock.

The greatest distinction between a Spirit Ring at its peak and a regular Spirit Ring was its ability to suddenly increase the intensity of its power. The extent at which Luo Qingcheng was able to exert control over her Spirit Ring, was almost to the point of perfection. At this stage, to be able to freely control the intensity of power exuding from the Spirit Ring like what Luo Qingcheng did was so she could increase the power to its highest level. This was something that Luo Qingcheng had not done in a thousand years.

The last time she used it, it was to capture the Night Regime.

Could it be? That Jun Wu Xie was powerful enough to force Luo Qingcheng into using that move?

Thinking about it, Wei Ya was shocked.

The battle of the Spirit Ring depended on the Spirit Ring as well as the spiritual strength of its owner.

The Spirit Ring of Luo Qingcheng suddenly doubled in strength. Under the intensity of such a surge, the speed became more rapid. In a blink of an eye, the original stalemate began to shift.

Jun Wu Xie constantly manipulated her Spirit Ring to fend off attacks from Luo Qingcheng. Her attacks were as dense as rain and at such a high intensity that it was trying to drive someone crazy.

“Aren’t you supposed to be good at fighting? How come you’re not fighting anymore? This is the difference between you and I. Watch carefully, you trash!” A cold light glinted from Luo Qingcheng’s eyes. All of a sudden, the spiritual power of her Spirit Ring exploded, and due to the immense power that swept across the battlefield, the soil got lifted up.

Like a storm sweeping through the desert, the enter battlefield descended into chaos.

Under the howling wing, countless of gravel mixed with spiritual power rained upon the battle armour of Jun Wu Xie, as she tried her best to control her Spirit Ring. At the same time, she continued to resist the tyrannical offensive that Luo Qingcheng has launched. However, even with her two feet planted firmly on the ground, she was still being forcefully pushed back by the immense spiritual pressure. Jun Wu Xie’s Spirit Ring was no longer able to defend her fully. The explosive power of Luo Qingcheng’s Spirit Ring turned the spiritual pressure into a sharp blade; as it left slash marks on the ground.

A loud bang was heard.

A strong explosion erupted right in front of Jun Wu Xie as her body was blown ten meters backwards, and she barely came to a stop.

As she regained her footing, a drop of blood dribbled past the corner of her mouth.

“Little Xie!” Qiao Chu and the rest of them watched with their hearts in their throats.

Jun Wu Xie lifted her hand to stop them from helping her. She took a gentle breath and stabilized herself, and stood up pencil-straight. Jun Wu Xie raised her hand to wipe the blood from the corner of her mouth. Those cold, unfeeling eyes did not show a sliver of defeat or resignation – they were burning with determination as she stared unflinchingly at Luo Qingcheng.

“Is this all you got?”

When Luo Qingcheng saw that Jun Wu Xie was injured, she grew smug. However, when Jun Wu Xie said those words, an ominous feeling grew within Luo Qingcheng.

“You’ve shown all your power, now it’s my turn.” Jun Wu Xie tilted her chin and her eyes displayed her killing intent.
