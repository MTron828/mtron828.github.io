Chapter 2192: If you want to fight, I too will fight!（6）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie and Ba He were deadlocked in battle, and the armour of the Face of Selvan had broken off quite a bit. Fresh blood stained the silver armour, but in her eyes, but not a sliver of fear nor retreat could be seen, her gaze only became more astute.

Ba He has never met such an opponent who did not care about their own life, obviously she was not as good as himself, but she was attacking him like crazy, even if her entire body was riddled with wounds, she seemed to feel no pain. Fighting without any room for retreat, this was simply fighting him with her own life on the line!

Even for such an arrogant person Ba He was, he was really shocked by Jun Wu Xie’s determination.

In the darkness, a pair of purple eyes was watching all this quietly. When the silver figure was slowly dyed red with blood, the calmness in the purple eyes had been replaced by the killing intent that soared towards the sky! He lifted his foot, ready to take a step forward.

At that moment!

Ye Mei immediately rushed before Jun Wu Yao, and with a bam, he slammed both knees onto the ground.

“Lord Jue! Lord Jue please think twice!” Ye Mei knelt down anxiously as he tried to persuade him.

“Scram.” Jun Wu Yao’s voice was so cold that it could freeze people’s blood.

“Lord Jue! I know that you do not want Young Miss to get hurt and you are not willing to listen to the persuasion of your subordinate. But I beseech you to believe in Miss’ plan, she made such a plan because she do not want to involve you. If you rashly go out now, even if you saved Young Miss, but you would have revealed your identity. If this was conveyed to the people in the Upper Realm, they would definitely hunt you down. At that time, how would Young Miss feel? She would definitely feel guilty and blame herself. Please consider for Young Miss as well and give her a little more time! Don’t let her efforts be all for naught!” Ye Mei desperately plead and begged, as his whole body shivered. This was the first time that he had went against Jun Wu Yao’s order. He was trembling, not from fear, but anger and anxiety.

He had already seen Jun Wu Xie as his other Master. How could he endure seeing her body with wounds all over?

However, before Jun Wu Xie had gone out, she had already given him a death order. He must be by Jun Wu Yao’s side and guard him to prevent him from being agitated by her injuries and rushing out. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I beg you, Lord Jue, you must believe in Young Miss!” Ye Mei desperately tried to stop Jun Wu Yao.

If Jun Wu Yao came out and struck, everything could be settled at once. However, the consequences would be disastrous and might spark a calamity.

Who knew if there were other people that belonged to the Upper Realm in the surroundings. If the news leaked out, it would be adamant to say that Jun Wu Yao would be hunted down. Even Jun Wu Xie wouldn’t be able to escape the attention of the Upper Realm.

In order to catch Jun Wu Yao, the Upper Realm will stoop to any means. Since they can catch Su Ya and force the little old man, they could also do something similar by catching hold of Jun Wu Yao’s weakness, which is Jun Wu Xie!

Jun Wu Xie insisted that Jun Wu Yao was not allowed to intervene, and she herself had made an astute determination.

How could he not know the fear that Jun Wu Xie had? There were dark ripples in Jun Wu Yao’s eyes as he fought down the impulses that had surfaced. In the two most difficult choices that Jun Wu Xie had to make, she chose the third way – which was her own way; to not only save Su Ya, but also to not have Jun Wu Yao expose his whereabouts.

But to let him watch her being in danger with his own eyes...

“Lord Jue, please wait, just wait a bit more. Don’t you believe Young Miss? Her plans had never failed once!” Ye Mei coaxed hurriedly.

Jun Wu Yao’s eyes were narrowed dangerously. Looking at Ba He who was fighting with Jun Wu Xie, the killing intent in his eyes could no longer be hidden.

“Upper Realm, one day, I will let you pay the price of blood!”
