Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Seated at the table with Qiao Chu was the whole gang of them. They arrived in the Sacred City two days ago. The messenger who sent the message to the Holy Mountain was anxious and they did not dally as they rushed all the way to Sacred City.

Before entering Sacred City, they had made full psychological preparations, and this time they had to meet the person behind the scenes of all happenings. Everyone pinched a cold sweat for Jun Wu Xie.

But...

No one ever thought that after entering the Sacred City, His Lord did not ask Jun Wu Xie to meet him at all. Instead, he asked her to temporarily stay in the restaurant in the city, and asked Jun Wu Xie to participate in the selection happening ten days later. During the whole selection of the experts, there was no mention of meeting Jun Wu Xie at all.

This made Qiao Chu feel relieved, yet at the same time, they were depressed.

With Jun Wu Xie’s strength, did she even need to participate in it?

Was there a problem with His Lord?

Not to mention the participants who came to the selection, even the Top Ten Experts were not good enough.

“Who knows, Mother Jun also said that His Lord’s temperament was strange. No one can understand him. But I feel that it is a good thing that the Little Xie is not in a hurry to see His Lord. We are now in the Sacred City. The position closest to His Lord is the most convenient place to gather information. It is always good to do more preparations.” Fan Zhuo said with a smile.

To be honest, after chatting with Han Zi Fei, they have a further understanding of that Lord. They knew that Jun Wu Xie had the strength of the Dual Spirit Ring as the other party, but still had no assurance of victory.

“What about Fei Yan?” Qiao Chu heard Fan Zhuo’s words and glanced around. Fei Yan disappeared early in the morning, but at noon, he never returned.

“Don’t look for it, he went out early to check the news.” Rong Ruo said lightly.

Qiao Chu nodded. He could not help but look curiously towards Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao who were sitting calmly. Among them, the most calm were these two. After entering the Sacred City, the two of them were like normal, there was not a sliver of nervousness about the final battle.

It seems that Qiao Chu’s sight was noticed. Jun Wu Xie slowly raised her head and looked at Qiao Chu with doubt in her eyes.

“What’s wrong?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Qiao Chu stared at Jun Wu Xie uncomfortably, his eyes expression were extremely complicated.

“Little Xie, are you not nervous at all?”

“Why should I be nervous?” Jun Wu Xie wondered.

“But you are going to deal with that person now.” Qiao Chu made a secret gesture.

That ruler of the Upper Realm was also the strongest master in the Three Realm. He was not only powerful, he was also cunning. At his peak, Jun Wu Yao had fallen into his trap!

“It’s sooner or later, why the tension?” Jun Wu Xie said indifferently, when the words landed, she looked up at Jun Wu Yao aside.

“You can stay in the room.”

In fact, Jun Wu Xie was not nervous about meeting His Lord. She was more concerned about Jun Wu Yao. Although Jun Wu Yao had never said it, Jun Wu Xie felt that she had no doubt His Lord placed a great deal of care on this matter. It was the only failure in her life.

She was worried whether Jun Wu Yao could control his emotions when he was so close to His Lord.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
