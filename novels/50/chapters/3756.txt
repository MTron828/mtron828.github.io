With a cold face, Luo Qingcheng sat on a chair.

“Just say it, why is Master here?” Apparently, Luo Qingcheng didn’t want to talk that much to him.

The man didn’t really care about Luo Qingcheng’s indifference towards him as the smile hanging on his face did not lessen even a bit.

“Nothing special, it’s just that a beaten dog has brought some news back.”

Luo Qingcheng looked at him. Puzzled.

“Nangong Lie has returned.” With a light laugh, the man said. “At the beginning, he brought an estimate of ten thousand Gold Spirits to the Middle Realm, but this time, he is the only one who has managed to come back. Now, ten thousand Gold Spirits died in the Middle Realm and not a single one survived except for him, who too, barely escaped from death. Just like a loser, he turned tail and ran back.”

Luo Qingcheng suddenly widened her eyes. Of course she knew that Nangong Lie went to the Middle Realm. She too, knew about his mission in the Middle Realm. Though most of the people he brought to the Middle Realm were just Gold Spirits, there were still some of them who were strong enough to condense spirit inscriptions.

How was it possible that almost ten thousand of Gold Spirits were completely wiped out in the Middle Realm! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Who did that?” Luo Qingcheng’s expression turned serious. Although Nangong Lie was not stronger than her, he was still one of the Top Ten Experts in the Upper Realm. His strength was definitely not weak, but how could he be defeated by a person from the Middle Realm?

The man did not respond immediately but just picked up the cup of tea and slowly took a sip of it. It seemed like his smiling eyes were admiring the changing expressions on Luo Qingcheng’s face.

“From what I have heard, the attack was launched by a woman named Jun Wu Xie. She had led a force called Night Regime which was left in the Middle Realm by Lord Jue.”

The moment the man spoke the three words ‘Jun Wu Xie’, there was an incitement flashing across the eyes of the expressionless pretty woman standing behind him. It was just a quick glare which disappeared instantly the following second as no one noticed that.

“Jun Wu Xie?” Luo Qingcheng tried to search in her memory for quite some time but still wasn’t able to think of anything about the background of this person.

“The one called Jun Wu Xie, where does she come from? There’s no way someone from the Middle Realm is able to win over Nangong Lie.” At the very first place, Luo Qingcheng excluded the possibility of Jun Wu Xie being a part of the Middle Realm.

For now, everything in the Upper Realm was already under the control of her Master. Yet, there were still some of them in the dark who were not satisfied with him, waiting for a chance to pull him down. Since those people won’t be able to get anywhere, it was natural for Luo Qincheng to attach no importance to them. Therefore, her conjecture was that the one who had the capability to defeat Nangong Lie was surely someone from the Upper Realm.

“You are right. She’s not from the Middle Realm.” The smile in the man’s eyes became denser. While slightly lowering his eyes, he hid the glimmer of coldness under his eyes.

“She’s from the Lower Realm and... You’ve met her before.”

“The Lower Realm? I’ve met her before? That’s impossible!” Luo Qincheng denied his statement right away. Saying that someone from the Lower Realm had defeated Nangong Lie? What a joke! “I have never been to the Lower Realm and also, I have no idea about the so called Jun Wu Xie.”

The man supported his chin with his single hand while grinning at Luo Qingcheng who had an icy expression on her face and said. “Nope, you had met her before. You even... had the chance to kill her five years ago.”

Luo Qingcheng’s face changed all of a sudden. Everything about the past five years ran across her mind. She stared at the man, with coldness in her gaze.

“Gu Ying, what are you trying to say!”
