Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A battle will be ignited on the land of the 72 cities.

The army of 72 cities led by White Night City and Blazing Flame City, were nearing Sea Spirit City. The army maintained an aggressive demeanour along the journey as they pressed a hard pace, and within a few days, the army had already arrived outside Sea Spirit City.

Outside the Sea Spirit City, there was nothing but the city which stood loftily in front of the army. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“This is Sea Spirit City?” A burly man raised his eyebrows and looked at Sea Spirit City in front of him, with a look of disapproval.

“This piece of shit little city actually activated so many of us to attack. I don’t know what the City Lords are thinking.” Another man frowned impatiently.

What happened on the day of the Banquet of Heroes was only known to the City Lords who participated. However, all the City Lords seemed to have a tacit understanding in keeping everything that happened under wraps. Hence, no one mentioned anything to their men. And after they had returned to their respective cities, the first thing they did was to assemble their troops and send them to Sea Spirit City. This time, more than 60 cities out of the 72 cities were involved in the alliance, and each city had sent tens of thousands of troops. Today, the number of troops assembled outside Sea Spirit City reached more than two million!!!

More than two million troops! It was enough to envelop the entire Sea Spirit City. Looking at the total number of troops in Sea Spirit City, they only numbered to 300,000 people and they were simply able-bodied citizens, how could they resist the attack of more than two million troops!

The great disparity between the enemy and them really made the generals and soldiers somewhat puzzled.

They couldn’t figure out how capable this Sea Spirit City really was that it could anger the City Lords of the 72 cities so much that they had to work together to completely destroy it!

Before they came, they had all received orders from their respective City Lords. In this battle, they had to kill everyone in Sea Spirit City, no one is allowed to escape!

“Forget it, since it is the order of the City Lord, we will just obey. To destroy this city, how difficult can it be?” A general waved his hand nonchalantly, as in his eyes, Sea Spirit City was already a dead city.

No matter how many rumors about the strength of Sea Spirit City have been spread, now, they have become meaningless.

They didn’t believe that with the strength of Sea Spirit City, the city could really defend against two million troops attacking?

Outside Sea Spirit City, the army was under pressure.

Within the city, it was a different scene.

Dongfang Ku Bi was anxious like an ant walking on a hot pot as he paced back and forth in the city’s official residence.

Seeing Ye Mei appear, he immediately greeted Ye Mei.

“What does the City Lord say? The army of the other cities is right outside the city. If the City Lord does not take more action, those people will really barge in!” Dongfang Ku Bi hurriedly spoke. He had received the news that the 72 cities have formed an alliance, as such, he brought 100,000 men to Sea Spirit City to help Jun Wu Xie. However, he had been in Sea Spirit City for two days but he still hadn’t even seen Jun Wu Xie.

Within Sea Spirit City, there was no tension seen during the preparation for the battle. This really confounded Dongfang Ku Bi.

This Jun Wu Xie didn’t seemed to be a stupid person. Why was he still not ready to fight at such a crucial moment?

Two million troops were just outside of Sea Spirit City. Once an attack was launched, it would take less than an hour to annihilate the entire Sea Spirit City!
