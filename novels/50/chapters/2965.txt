Chapter 2966 Ridiculous poison king 1

Bai Zhu’s expression was extremely tense. Although Fang Jinghe had some knowledge about the poison, he did not know why he felt that the matter was not that simple whenever he looked into Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

Fang Jinghe repeatedly searched Bai Zhu’s body in the eyes of the public. He checked using silver needles, bloodletting, and other methods. However, Fang Jinghe was stunned.

Jun Wu Xie stared at the sparkling silver needle that she just pulled out from Bai Zhu’s body. Fang Jinghe involuntarily looked at Jun Wu Xie, her expression seemed extremely strange.

“How’s it?” Long Yao asked coldly. Long Yao had recovered a little peace at this moment. He had the same thoughts as Fang Jinghe. Since Jun Wu Xie had said those words, it was necessary to bear the consequences.

As long as Fang Jinghe found out the origin of the poison, Jun Wu Xie could no longer find trouble with them.

Long Yao also believed that Jun Wu Xie would not easily let go of those who hurt her companions. By then, his plan could still be carried out!

The anger had just disappeared at this moment. Long Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie’s eyes with a little less surprise but a little more ridicule.

She was still too young to realise such a good opportunity to avenge him. Instead, Jun Wu Xie chose to take a gamble, which was simply killing herself.

As long as this poison was settled, It did not matter anymore if Jun Wu Xie wanted to deal with Bai Zhu or Fang Jin He in the future. Long Yao had a perfect excuse to wipe it out.

However, just when Long Yao was complacent about his plan, he didn’t realize that Jun Wu Xie’s eyes flashed a sneer.

“Lord Fang, what’s wrong with my poison ... what happened?” Bai Zhu completely lost his mind to think about something else. He just wanted to know if he would survive.

Fang Jinghe’s expression was tangled to the extreme. He stared at the silver needle in his hand, and said for a long while, “You ... are you not poisoned?”

When Fang Jinghe said this, everyone in the room was frightened. Long Yao couldn’t help showing a surprised expression, “Not poisoned? What does this mean?” Long Yao couldn’t believe it and asked.

Fang Jinghe could only explain: “I have checked Bai Zhu all over, but he showed no signs of poisoning ...

Fang Jinghe was also dumbfounded. He had seen countless poisons and hundreds or thousands of poisons. But he had never seen any poison that could not be detected by using silver needles or bloodletting. No evidence of poisoning was found on Bai Zhu’s body. Bai Zhu’s body was normal and there was no toxin at all. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Could it be that...

Is this a trap intentionally set by Jun Wu Xie?

She didn’t poison Bai Zhu at all, so she said that?

Long Yao’s eyes suddenly looked at Jun Wu Xie. But Jun Wu Xie’s expression was very calm.

“Yan Hai, did you poison Bai Zhu?”

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Long Yao, then her eyes fell on Fang Jinghe.

“It seems that the rumors are really not credible, and the so-called poison king is just nothing more than this.”

Fang Jinghe looked stiff. Among the Top Ten Experts, he did have the title of a poisoned king. This was what he had always been proud of. But for some reason, when this was said by Jun Wu Xie, it sounded sarcastic.
