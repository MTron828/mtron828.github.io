Chapter 2105: Spirit Lord (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Poison Ivy’s words were like the last straw that broke the camel’s back, that quashed the last sliver of hope in the hearts of Qiao Chu and the other companions.

Jun Wu Xie did not say a word, but just went charging inside Flame Dragon’s cave with the fastest speed possible and pulled out the little awl she carried on her to immediately carve out a series of Spirit Reinforcement runes just beside Nalan Shan.

“Little Xie..... What are you doing?” Qiao Chu asked as he turned his eyes around to look at Jun Wu Xie, not understanding what she was still doing at such a critical juncture?

“We won’t be able to escape and Nalan Shan must not be caught now or he will die.” Jun Wu Xie carved out the last Spirit Reinforcement runes at the quickest speed possible without any expression. Adding that circle of Spirit Reinforcement runes would hide a person’s aura for a short period of time but she had only tried it on a human and did not know whether it works on spirits. But with the way things have turned out, she had to give it a try!

She had promised Brownie that she would take good care of Nalan Shan and she would not go back on her word!

“Then, what should we do now?” Hua Yao asked with furrowed brows, as things had progressed to a stage where it had surpassed anything they could have expected.

All that waiting had not yielded them Wu Jiu being punished by the Spirit Lord but to give them such a result instead.

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath as she stared at the gradually approaching light, her mind constantly searching for possible way to resolve this.

Unfortunately.....

She was not that familiar with things in the Spirit World, and knew absolutely nothing about the Spirit Lord, an opponent she knew nothing about, that deprived her of many conditions for her to make accurate judgements. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The ball of ice blue light came to a stop right in front of Flame Dragon’s cave and he slowly descended, where all the Beast Spirits around the place fell to their knees in reverence and worship towards that light.

The creator of the Spirit World, the Spirit Lord.

The shade of Poison Ivy’s face was not looking too good.

From within the light, a slender figure came walking out slowly. A handsome looking man appeared before the eyes of Jun Wu Xie and the companions. The man was tall, dressed in a light blue long robe, his head of long silver white hair looking extremely striking, but what surprised people the most was that pair of light grey eyes.

The man who had appeared right before them was the Spirit Lord who created the entire Spirit World, the reigning ruler over all spirits!

The Spirit Lord had not even opened his mouth to speak and a powerful oppressive aura was already shrouded around Jun Wu Xie and the companions. That intense oppression seemed to cause the power in their bodies to drain out in an instant, and the companions had to grit their teeth hard to prevent themselves from falling.

Poison Ivy’s situation was the worst. His face had turned white, and his tall frame had gradually become bent and hunched over from withstanding that enormously powerful oppressive aura.

“Poison Ivy, why do you not kneel upon seeing me?” The Spirit Lord asked, the light grey eyes looking at Poison Ivy filled with complete arrogance.

Poison Ivy entire body was trembling uncontrollably under that stare, feeling as if endless streams of power were striking incessantly upon his body, rendering unable to stand, as he fell with a thud onto his knees on the ground.

“Poison Ivy pays his respects..... to the Spirit Lord.....” Every single word, was a great struggle for Poison Ivy to say.

The Spirit Lord’s gaze then turned away from Poison Ivy in satisfaction. His eyes were half narrowed as he then looked at Jun Wu Xie and her companions who were struggling to hold themselves up.

“Rather capable lot here. No wonder the Spirit Master Wu Jiu was defeated.” The Spirit Lord opened his mouth to say.

It was merely a simple statement, but it made Jun Wu Xie and her companions feel that the oppressive aura their bodies were withstanding under suddenly increase y several folds, their legs feeling like they could break off any moment.

“You are the Spirit Lord?” Jun Wu Xie forced herself to endure the highly intense oppressive aura, and her gaze was neither servile nor dominating as she looked at the man who reigned over the entire Spirit World before her.

“I am.” The Spirit Lord responded with the corners of his lips curled up slightly.

“Do all of you know what you have done?”
