“Duan Qi? Who is she?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao with some doubts.

Jun Wu Yao sneered, “She is an elder of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, and she holds a high status within the Upper Realm and the Sacred Maiden Tribe. However, the Sacred Maiden Tribe rarely comes into contact with others, but this time they are playing mediator for the 72 cities. This is interesting.”

“Sacred Maiden Tribe.” Jun Wu Xie frowned slightly. There were also several Sacred Maidens whom she had come into contact with, and except for Han Zi Fei, the rest of them did not give a good impression. Wasn’t Luo Qingcheng a part of the Sacred Maiden Tribe? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Thinking of Han Zi Fei, Jun Wu Xie’s heart suddenly started to pound.

Han Zi Fei left suddenly, she didn’t even bid them farewell.

“I don’t know where Zi Fei went.” Jun Wu Xie said suddenly.

Jun Wu Yao’s eyes flickered a little, but he said nothing.

“If that Duan Qi is as you said, why will they want to be the mediators for the 72 cities?” Jun Wu Xie asked, wanting to know the reason.

“I’m also a little curious about this.” Jun Wu Yao said, “I haven’t had much contact with the Sacred Maiden Tribe. In general, they are not easy to get along with. Their thinking is very stubborn and extremely xenophobic. With her arrival this time, I am afraid it won’t be that simple. I think the reason why she agreed to be the mediator has something to do with you.”

“Oh?” Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow slightly. “Related to me?”

Jun Wu Yao chuckled a little as he looked at the look of ignorance on Jun Wu Xie’s face. He couldn’t help but laugh as Jun Wu Xie was always shockingly calm in the face of tremendous obstacles. When it came to something she didn’t understand, she would always be very honest and straightforward about clarifying the issue. Everytime Jun Wu Yao saw that expression on her face, he couldn’t help but want to pinch that cute little face.

It was only at this moment that she seemed so loveable.

“A dual Spirit Rings exponent is unique in the Upper Realm. The Upper Realm has always cherished strength and power. The strongest dual Spirit Rings possessor is only that one person, and now that you’ve suddenly appeared? How can they not pay attention? Furthermore, although the Sacred MaidenTribe do not like to be in contact with others, there is one thing which forces them to have contact with the outside world.”

“Which is?” At that moment, Jun Wu Xie was like a child filled with curiosity, she was staring at Jun Wu Yao with a pair of wide eyes, with questions floating in them. It melted Jun Wu Yao’s heart and he wanted to tell her everything.

“While the Sacred Maiden Tribe are all women, they also need to continue their bloodline, so they will look for outstanding men from the Three Realms to procreate with. If they give birth to a boy, the boy will be left with the man to be cared for. If they give birth to a girl, she will be raised among the Sacred Maidens. In order to keep their bloodline strong, they will only choose the most outstanding men to conceive the next generation. As far as I know, the top ten masters are their main targets. Now, you are a girl but your outward appearance is that of a man, and and you’ve successfully subdued the top ten exponents, of course the Sacred Maiden Tribe is tempted to meet you.”

Jun Wu Xie was a little surprised at Jun Wu Yao’s words.

“You mean, Duan Qi wants me and a woman from the Sacred Maiden Tribe to... ” Jun Wu Xie was speechless for a while.

Jun Wu Yao smiled and nodded: “If I guess correctly, it should be so.”

“...” Jun Wu Xie was incredulous as she thought of the Sacred Maiden Tribe was mostly made up of women like Luo Qingcheng, and she really did not have any good feeling towards the tribe.

“Well, it’s nothing but our conjecture at this point. Everything will be unknown until after that Duan Qi arrives.” Jun Wu Yao watched as Jun Wu Xie’s brow wrinkled lightly, and he reached out to hug her in his arms and whispered softly.
