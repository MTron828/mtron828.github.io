Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Qiao Chu opened his mouth and looked at Fei Yan’s bloody face. His throat seemed to have swallowed knife blades and it hurt so much that he could not utter a single word.

“Answer me !!!” Anxiety was swelling a little in Fei Yan’s chest. He growled with great strength, tearing his sticky lip completely. A large swath of blood spurted from his mouth. His body was shaking and he was almost falling. Qiao Chu, who was scared, immediately stepped forward. But in the end, Fei Yan supported his own body and lowered his head.

“Tell me, where is she? Please ...”

Depressed voice, choked with pleading.

When Qiao Chu heard it, it was like a knife, stabbing fiercely into his heart .

“I ... I don’t know ... I really ... I don’t know ...” Qiao Chu held on to Hua Yao behind him with one hand, biting his roots, lowering his head. His hand hanging to one side had exposed a bone in the air, a trace of blood, dripping down his feet and along his arms.

Death was so close for the first time.

...

On this day, the whole Sacred City was filled with blood.

When Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao left and returned to the inn where they settled, it was completely engulfed by the blazing fire.

In the night, the red fire flew towards the sky, clearly showing the might of the flames.

Outside the inn, many onlookers gathered. Outside the fire, there was a lot of discussion going on.

“Why is this on fire?”

“Who knows? But I heard that in the afternoon, there seemed to be an intense battle here and many people had died!”

“Who is so daring? Making trouble in the Sacred City?”

“It seems that one of the Top Ten Experts was involved ...”

“Are you seeking death? How dare you say that!”

“...”

The words of chaos spread into Jun Wu Xie’s ears, and she stared blankly at the red flame. An ominous premonition suddenly exploded in her heart. She subconsciously lifted her feet and wanted to walk towards the flame. But a strong arm pulled her arm tightly.

“They won’t be inside.” Jun Wu Yao’s voice sounded in Jun Wu Xie’s ears, like a basin of ice water, which completely awoke Jun Wu Xie’s mind. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jun Wu Xie’s footsteps froze slightly.

At this moment, a familiar figure appeared beside Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

“Nangong Lie?” Jun Wu Xie saw Nangong Lie. Her eyes lightened slightly and just as she was about to say something she saw Nangong Lie make a silent gesture to her, and then turned around, secretly facing Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao, waving at them.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao gave each other a glance and immediately followed.

Nangong Lei led them into the dark, through the streets of the Sacred City. Finally they came to an inconspicuous villa and stopped. He stood at the door and looked at Jun Wu Xie with complexity.

“In the afternoon, your companions were attacked by one of the top ten experts. I dare not let them live in a crowded place so I can only arrange them here temporarily. You must stay calm.” Nangong Lie’s voice was a little depressed, and Jun Wu Xie’s expression immediately changed.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Nangong Lie and said nothing. He stepped forward and opened the locked door in front of him.

The moment the door was opened, the scene before Jun Wu Xie made her brain buzz as if it had cracked open!
