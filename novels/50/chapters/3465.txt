Jun Wu Xie lowered her head to look down at her chest, where she seemed to feel a certain kind of power stirring inside. That feeling was a little familiar, but at the same time strange. Although a little discomfiting, but it wasn’t really agonizing. She did not feel any abnormality in her soul, and concluded that it could be due to her having cultivated too intensely recently, not wanting to think too much into it.

The feeling of having regained power was just great and Qiao Chu and the others were excited to show off their new strength. It must be known that ever since they had come into the Spirit World, their weak and insignificant powers had been highly unbearable. Now that they have gained powers once again, these hot blooded and exuberant youths could not help but anticipate being able to exhibit their skills, and Jun Wu Xie going to the first Serene Spirit Tower would give them the best opportunity to do that.

“Jiang Yun Long seemed to have relaxed on his search for you. Do you think they are pursuing other motives?” Rong Ruo asked as she looked at Jun Wu Xie. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

From the news that Little Lotus and Poppy had brought, they came to know that the portraits of Jun Wu Xie that had been pasted everywhere had been taken down and Jiang Yun Long had reduced a large part of the spirits tasked with finding Jun Wu Xie. It would seem like they have finally given up on pursuing Jun Wu Xie. Similarly, they had still not located Nalan Shan and Brownie so their sudden silence had not only not made Rong Ruo and the others relax their guard but had instead made them suspect whether Jiang Yun Long and Wu Jiu had made new plans.

“Regardless what they plan to do, we will still destroy them! They dared to persecute Little Xie! They must be tired of living!” Qiao Chu harrumphed indignantly. Having known Jun Wu Xie for so long, no matter where they were, Jun Wu Xie had never fallen into a situation where she wanted as a fugitive, and Jiang Yun Long had set a new precedent.

Jun Wu Xie had wanted to say something but the strange feeling in her chest grew more and more intense. From a slight discomfort to gradually grow into a stinging pain. Her face turned pale in an instant, and her body then started trembling uncontrollably.

Qiao Chu and the other companions noticed Jun Wu Xie’s abnormality and they immediately halted their conversation, to looked at Jun Wu Xie anxiously as the colour on her face continued to worsen.

“Little Xie, what’s wrong?” Qiao Chu was so worried his palms were sweating, seeing Jun Wu Xie in such a condition but did not dare to touch her carelessly, afraid that he would inflict greater harm upon her.

It was so painful Jun Wu Xie could not even speak. She was feeling as if something was about to surge out from inside her chest, hard to imagine that such a kind of swelling and tearing pain she was feeling would manifest upon a spirit body.

A tall slender figure suddenly descended from up among the trees, and scooped Jun Wu Xie right into his arms.

Qiao Chu and the others stared in shock at the person who had suddenly appeared. Until they saw Jun Wu Yao’s familiar contenance, they all then breathed out in relief.

Jun Wu Yao’s brows knitted together as he looked at Jun Wu Xie in his arms, seemingly able to feel her pain from seeing Jun Wu Xie’s body that was shaking uncontrollably. His hands were constantly sending his devil spirit into Jun Wu Xie’s body, seeking to eradicate the agony, but with unnoticeable effect.

Jun Wu Xie had her teeth gritted tightly together, struggling to suppress the cry that threatened to come out of her mouth. Her tiny hand held Jun Wu Yao’s shirt collar in a death’s grip, trying to endure it with everything she had.

Suddenly, a streak of light shot out from Jun Wu Xie’s chest, the light flying up into midair before it fell to the ground in an instant. A blurry figure manifested within that light, and at the moment that the light faded away, a tall figure suddenly appeared before Qiao Chu and the others.

That manifestation caused Qiao Chu and the several companions to be completely stunned in place.

It was a tall figure, a man with a handsome countenance.
