Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Before, Xu Zu had been crushed utterly by Jun Wu Xie and it wasn’t easy for him to suppress the flames of rage that had welled up inside. Now that his strength had risen after taking the elixir, he was brimming with arrogance. With the addition of Ruan Zhongshan behind him, he became even more fearless.

Ye Sha glanced at Xu Zu who had rekindled the flames of arrogance, but he didn’t even put such a stupid thing in his eyes. His gaze fleeted by Ruan Zhongshan who stood outside the door before he pretended to panic and said meekly: “Yes...Yes, this small subordinate will immediately notify my Lord. ”

After speaking, he turned and left and returned after a short period.

“Esteemed City Lord, please come in.”

Xu Zu gave a cold harrumph before he turned and walked in front of Ruan Zhongshan immediately and started to fawn over Ruan Zhongshan all over again.

“City Lord, please.” Xu Zu diligently said.

Ruan Zhongshan nodded and walked into the manor of the City Lord.

The manor of Yan Wan had been renovated many times and it was already very exquisite and gorgeous, but compared to the interior decorations of Ruan Zhongshan’s place, it still looked a bit shabby. Ruan Zhongshan’s greedy gaze swept across the surroundings but wherever his gaze landed, nothing could catch his eyes.

Ye Sha led them all the way to the main hall yet there was no one else in the hall. When Xu Zu saw the empty hall, he frowned and asked in dissatisfaction, “Where is your City Lord?”

“The City Lord just received the news and is now changing. He will come over shortly, please have a seat while you wait.” Ye Sha smiled as he said.

With a scowl, Xu Zu raised his voice and said with undisguised contempt: “Your high and almighty City Lord is really busy, previously, it was so difficult to seek an audience with him. Don’t tell me that this time he wants our City Lord to wait for half a month before he grants an audience? ”

Xu Zu’s words were rather unpleasant and he showed no mercy at all in his words. It was because of Ruan Zhongshan’s presence that he dared to act so presumptuously.

If one didn’t know, back then when he was driven out of Sea Spirit City by Jun Wu Xie, he didn’t even dare to let out a fart. Now, his head had grown all big and arrogant again.

Towards Xu Zu’s provocation, Ye Sha only smiled back. In fact, he didn’t care what nonsense Xu Zu was spouting, in fact, he was watching Ruan Zhongshan’s reaction closely. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ruan Zhongshan was sitting leisurely on the chair and other than looking at everything before him in contempt, there was no other expression. There was also no sign of any intention to stop Xu Zu’s uncouth behavior.

That high and almighty attitude was simply appalling.

“Aren’t you going to call your City Lord out yet? Our City Lord’s time is precious and it can’t be squandered away so casually.” Xu Zu hollered as he puffed his chest up.

Although Ye Sha didn’t say anything, but a dangerous glint of murderous intent flashed by his eyes, but he cleverly concealed it.

When Xu Zu was about to continue creating a ruckus, a cold voice suddenly rang out.

“Since time is precious, why bother coming all the way to my Sea Spirit City?”

As soon as the words rang out, Jun Wu Xie who had already changed into Yan Hai strolled in. The moment her figure appeared, the proud Xu Zu who was creating a din just before subconsciously swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

Jun Wu Xie calmly walked into the hall and sat down with the gazed of Ruan Zhongshan and others all focused on her.

Ruan Zhongshan had been the City Lord of Long Xuan City for many years. He has sore foresight. Before he saw Jun Wu Xie before, he already had a vague concept in his heart.

Yan Hai was Yan Wan’s son. Even though he was not raised by Yan Wan’s side since he was a child, there was not much difference in his temperament from Yan Wan. In addition, Yan Wan has been very strict with Yan Hai since he was a child. With all the teachings he received, he should not be a simple and naive boy.
