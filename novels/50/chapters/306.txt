Chapter 307: “Obliterate (2)”

“Oh? For who?” Hua Yao asked lightly.

Qin Yue took a deep breath, suppressing the rage that welled up in his chest.

“Yu Yan and Elder Jiang are dead.”

Hua Yao froze a moment. The Qin Yu Yan that Qin Yue was talking about was his only daughter. He had pampered and spoilt rotten this daughter of his and did everything within his power to give her everything she had ever wanted. As the Eldest Miss of the Qing Yun Clan, Qin Yu Yan was the sweetheart of the clan, and was loved by everyone, and her benign and pretty looks was an almost exact replica of Qin Yue.

Hua Yao had had a prior encounter with Qin Yu Yan when he had first snuck into the Hidden Cloud Peak in search of the map, he had been hiding in the shadows when he saw Qin Yu Yan and Ke Cang Ju in the underground chamber tormenting the innocent youths, her beautiful face was an insidious mask, working in cahoots with Ke Cang Ju. She displayed a stark contrast to Ke Cang Ju, her false facade of benign kindness and gentleness on her face, like Qin Yue, but was party to dastardly deeds in secret, together with the hideous and sinister looking Ke Cang Ju.

But, as the very treasured apple of Qin Yue’s eye, how was she killed so suddenly?

The little black cat on the table flicked its ears and opened its eyes slowly, and a flicker of hatred flashed as it swept its cold gaze across the room and those eyes passed Qin Yue.

Qin Yue had received news of Qin Yu Yan’s death earlier than she had expected. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“The audacious tiny Kingdom of Qi dared to commit such a travesty against us! That useless no good Jun Family actually dared kill my daughter! I want the whole family to die and cut into a thousand pieces! Ke Cang Ju, give me the best poison of your life’s work! I want the Jun Family and the Qi Imperial Family to be buried together with my daughter!” Qin Yue’s jaw was tightly clenched as his rage threatened to overcome him. He was no longer young and already middle aged and he had only Qin Yu Yan, his most treasured one and only daughter. His most beloved daughter had been brutally murdered in the faraway Kingdom of Qi, and the humiliation and anger drove a strong urge within him to lead a force to storm the Qi Kingdom and shred his enemies to pieces.

Hua Yao was shocked after hearing Qin Yue’s rant and a incredulous notion crept into his mind. He innocuously glanced at the black cat, as his suspicion grew stronger.

Jun Family..... Didn’t Jun Xie shares that same name?

And, did Qiao Chu not first meet Jun Xie in the very same Imperial City of Qi?

Hua Yao had been curious about what had caused Jun Xie to harbour such deep hatred for the Qing Yun Clan, to want to obliterate the whole lot of them. Now, it seemed that if his suspicions were right, Jun Xie was closely linked to the Jun Family that killed Qin Yu Yan, and Jun Xie’s intention to wipe out the Qing Yun Clan was to strike first at the enemy while they were unprepared.

In that scenario, if the Qing Yun Clan remained, the Jun Family would be the one annihilated!

As working partners, no matter if Jun Xie was linked to the Jun Family in question, Hua Yao decided to probe further on Jun Xie’s behalf. “You don’t need me to do that, wouldn’t just a few of the highly skilled resident mercenaries of the Qing Yun Clan would be more than enough to squash them completely?”

A frosty laugh escaped from Qin Yue’s throat: “A straight death would be too easy on them, I want them to suffer a fate worse than death! I will bring them back to the Qing Yun Clan, and feel every bit of the agonising torment I would inflict on them, and have them beg to be killed! Nothing less than that would appease the anger and hatred in my heart!”

Those that killed my daughter must not be allowed to walk the earth! If her murderers were not put through insufferable torment, his daughter’s soul would not find peace!

Hua Yao nodded in supposed agreement.

Jun Wu Xie’s soul within the little black cat narrowed its eyes after hearing Qin Yue’s words. She appreciated Hua Yao gesture of thoughtfulness after finding out Qin Yue did not intend to send a force to the Qi Kingdom.

But even if he did, Jun Wu Xie was undeterred.

The fact that she dared to leave the Qi Kingdom meant that she had absolute confidence. Before she obliterated the Qing Yun Clan, no matter who Qin Yue sent, they would not be able to lay a finger on the Jun Family.
