Chapter 2961: Come Out and Die! (5)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Bai Zhu was frightened out of his wits, Jun Wu Xie’s anger was so obvious that if he still had to guess the reason for it, he was truly a fool!

Staying alive was all that was on Bai Zhu’s mind, he pleadingly looked at Long Yao. The only one present who could save him was Long Yao!

Long Yao said coldly, “Yan Hai, what are you doing? Don’t tell me you’re insisting on breaking the rules?”

Long Yao’s calm tone masked a bit of fear he felt on the inside. Ever since Jun Wu Xie appeared, nothing had gone according to his plan. Even the mighty Long Yao had to admit he had no way of knowing what she would do next.

This youth was more dangerous than he had imagined!

Jun Wu Xie lifted her head slightly to look at Long Yao, she had no intention to release Bai Zhu. “I don’t remember the rules having anything to do with the Lords of the 72 cities.”

“What?” Long Yao was a little shocked, apparently not understanding the meaning behind Jun Wu Xie’s words.

Jun Wu Xie said, “I am the Overlord of the 72 Cities and Bai Zhu, being Lord of White Night City, is my subordinate. It can’t be that disciplining one of my subordinates violates the rules right?” Jun Wu Xie stared blankly at Long Yao, even allowing a slight smile to creep through.

Long Yao dared to attack her, well now it was time to experience her vengeance! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jun Wu Xie’s words negated all of Long Yao’s warnings. He had originally intended to use His Lord’s name to control her actions but never did he expect to be defeated!

His Lord had never cared about the 72 Cities, whether it was one city destroying another or one rising above all others, he had always closed one eye and shut the other. In doing so, this brutal atmosphere was formed.

Jun Wu Xie had used her status as Overlord of the 72 Cities to crush Bai Zhu. Even if Long Yao wanted to come out with a reason, it would be hard to say she broke His Lord’s rules as he never interfered with matters of the 72 Cities.

If Long Yao really did it, it would have been as representing the Lord!

Even as a Knight of Destruction, there were places he dared not tread.

Long Yao’s eyes narrowed dangerously, Jun Wu Xie’s actions were a challenge to Long Yao himself!

“Lord....Lord Long Yao...save...save me...” Bai Zhu was terrified. Not having great strength, he was good at crafting strategies and did his best work behind the scenes. Now that he was in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, he had no way of escaping.

With Bai Zhu’s intelligence, how could he not know Jun Wu Xie’s intent!

For the first time in his life, Bai Zhu felt close to death. His only way out was Long Yao and he could only look towards Long Yao to give himself a chance of living.

However, Long Yao’s brows furrowed. Based on Jun Wu Xie’s argument, he had no reason to intervene.

It was hard to imagine that even while bearing so much hate, Jun Wu Xie could maintain such a cool head!
