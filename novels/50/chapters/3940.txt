Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The corpses in the three wooden boxes became the key to disgusting Yan Wan and Old He. Jun Wu Xie literally threw these dead bodies directly at their faces, but in the face of the current situation, they could not even resist and could only tolerate the sight.

Fortunately, Old He had already instructed his men to throw those bodies into the Sea of Death, so in the event Jun Wu Xie wanted to settle scores at a later date, dead men tell no tales.

Except the current situation made Yan Wan feel helpless.

“No matter who is helping him, since he knows that My Lord you are plotting against him, there could be no peaceful coexistence between My Lord and him anymore. It is best to make a final decision regarding this matter.” Old He said cautiously. Working smoothly for so many years to actually have made such an absurd mistake, he felt so discomforted within his heart.

“Naturally, I know this. But how should we handle the matter? I thought I had put an end to him yesterday but who would have guessed that these things got tossed about? Old He, I know that you are capable, do you still have ideas to get rid of that little bastard?” Yan Wan looked at Old He, he didn’t want to do it himself, if not it would be his misfortune; only Old He would still be able to come up with a plan.

Old He squinted his eyes and said, “I’ve still got men, but now the only question is – we do not know who is the one secretly helping Yan Hai, and what the person’s strength is. If we made a move, it’s fine if we don’t succeed but if we let Yan Hai get hold of some evidence, then it’ll make matters worse.”

Initially it would be easy to solve the problem of Jun Wu Xie. However, an exponent who no one knew appeared and caused Yan Wan and Old He to be over stretched.

“If My Lord really wants to get rid of Yan Hai, then we must find out who is the person behind him.” Old He said.

“If earlier, I might have been able to send someone to infiltrate Yan Hai’s mansion, but because of this matter, Yan Hai definitely won’t allow me to interfere with matters pertaining to his mansion. To investigate that person, it won’t be easy at all.” Yan Wan was exceptionally vexed. If he knew that Yan Hai had an important card up his sleeve, he wouldn’t have gone ahead with his plan.

Old He shifted and suddenly said, “There might be a way.”

“Oh?” Yan Wan looked at Old He expectantly.

“My Lord, do you still remember Ling Xin?” Old He asked.

Yan Wan’s eyes lit up!

Although Yan Hai is not favoured by Yan Wan, but he still carried the mantle of being the Young Master of Sea Spirit City and was respected by people in the city. Yan Hai was young and hot-blooded, although he didn’t indulge in the pleasures of female flesh, but he had many female confindates, and this Ling Xin was one of Yan Hai’s favoured.

Ling Xin was eighteen and at her prime. Her parents’ talents were average, her own was below average, and she could not climb up the hierarchy. fortunately , Ling Xin was blessed with good looks, a natural beauty; she was considered a top-notch beauty in all of Sea Spirit City. She attracted and was adored by many men. Among those who courted her, the most powerful was Yan Hai. Ling Xin and Yan Hai’s relationship was very intimate, to the point where Yan Hai had promised that he would marry her someday.

He was well aware about this matter, but he did not consider a woman with lowly talent.

But now that Old He had mentioned, he started to think about things differently.

“You mean to say.... Let Ling Xin investigate?” Yan Hai said.

Old He nodded, “That woman may be young but she is smart. If not, she would not be so clingy to Yan Hai. If it were others, Yan Hai would surely be on his guard, but if was the woman he cared about...”
