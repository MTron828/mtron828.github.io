Chapter 2079: Face Slapping of the Ecstatic Rapture Palm (6)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Blazing rage rose in the hearts of the Beast Spirits. They realized that they had all been toyed with by Wu Jiu. Wu Jiu’s exoneration and his lies, had now instead proven his shamelessness. He was seeking to capture the Spiritual Bear, their very own Spiritual Bear!

Unforgivable!

Unforgivable!

The Beast Spirits’ rage had been ignited. They all charged into the battlefield, going forward a step at a time towards their Spiritual Leader, a low threatening growl coming out from their jaws, their bodies taut, in a state that was ready to attack anytime.

Those human spirits who had surrounded around Brownie were so frightened by all those pairs of rage filled eyes that their souls very nearly fleeted out of them. They backed up in retreat a step at a time, not daring to look straight into the rage of the Beast Spirits!

Wu Jiu’s face had turned an extremely ugly shade. He could not have ever thought that the Spiritual Bear that had been completely drained of powers would still have the ability to execute a last gamble, and the manifestation of the Spiritual Bear had completely pushed him to the edge of the abyss.

Wu Jiu gritted his teeth, as he stared at the massive number of Beast Spirits.

In a fluster, he realized that things were suddenly not right. He had designed today’s events to be a beautiful moment that he would capture Nalan Shan, and after the Beast Spirits lost to the Weapon Spirits in their contest for the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, even if they did not blame Wu Jiu, they would definitely not want to come all the way out here just to watch.

Their numbers were too great!

The Beast Spirits’ numbers were just too overwhelming!

Logically, it shouldn’t be possible that there would be so many Beast Spirits here today.

Wu Jiu had not felt anything peculiar about it initially, having thought that the Beast Spirits were just here to catch the excitement.

But now that he thought about it, for such a large number of Beast Spirits to appear, it did not seem to have happened by accident, but by someone’s intentional design, only waiting for the moment that the Spiritual Bear reveals itself, to incite hatred to rise within the hearts of the Beast Spirits!

Just who had schemed all of this?

Poison Ivy? Nalan Shan? Or was it.....

Wu Jiu suddenly raised his eyes up, and looked towards the young lady he did not know well.

Anything and everything had always been within this control. It was until Jun Wu Xie appeared that caused things to fall into the current disarray.

It’s her!

Jun Wu Xie stared back at Wu Jiu’s gaze without a flinch, the corners of her mouth curling up in a slight arc, seemingly sneering at Wu Jiu’s stupidity, that just confirmed Wu Jiu’s suspicion.

This entire scheme, had been designed by Jun Wu Xie, that struck a most effective retaliation against Wu Jiu!

Wu Jiu could no longer deceive the Beast Spirits, where he could no longer openly imprison the Spiritual Bear!

Rage and shock intertwined within Wu Jiu’s heart. Not even in his dreams would he have thought that the plot that he had weaved so carefully would be defeated by Jun Wu Xie’s hand!

“Wu Jiu, you plot had been exposed. How are you going to deny it any further?” A deep booming voice rang out from above, up in the sky.

Wu Jiu suddenly raised his head to look up, to see the gargantuan sized Flame Dragon flying high up in the sky!

That’s right, how could he not have thought of that? Flame Dragon had always been rather guarded against him. Back when he had incited conflict among the three great races, Flame Dragon had tried its best to avoid becoming involved. To be able to summon so many Beast Spirits to appear here at this place today, besides Flame Dragon, who else could it be! ?

Flame Dragon, must have joined hands with Jun Wu Xie in this!

“Deny? What is there for me to deny! ? Capturing the Spiritual Bear is the Spirit Lord’s idea and I was merely following orders. I had thought to not worry the Beast Spirits too much but you are now not appreciating the thought. But you still can’t blame me for this.” Wu Jiu said with a sneer. Not only was he not showing any fear from being exposed, he was instead showing greater arrogance.

He lowered his head back down and looked at Soul Slayer who was standing dazed on the side to say: “Soul Slayer, do you know why I still have not completed the construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower all this time?”
