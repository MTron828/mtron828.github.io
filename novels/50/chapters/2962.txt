Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“What? His Lord has such a rule? If there is, I will stop now. But if there isn’t I hope Lord Long Yao would not interfere in the affairs of the 72 Cities.” Jun Wu Xie lowered her head and looked at Long Yao who was trembling with anger. She would not back down even half an inch.

His Lord’s rules?

How would it be possible that the Lord was interested in such trivial matters?

Long Yao was gnashing his teeth to their roots with anger. How would he ever have thought that by using His Lord’s name to trap Jun Wu Xie, his words would be used against him repeatedly and he in turn would have been trapped by Jun Wu Xie?

If Long Yao had not invoked the name of His Lord earlier, perhaps he could have found a way out. But now that he was caught in his own trap, he had nothing else to say.

Long Yao had been rebutted into silence by Jun Wu Xie and if he continued to argue, she could instead accuse him of defying the Lord’s will. In the Upper Realm, Long Yao could pay heed to nothing and nobody, unless it came to His Lord then he did not dare to step out of line. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If he were dealing with an ordinary person, Long Yao could simply kill him. But when facing Jun Wu Xie, bearer of the Dual Spirit Rings, Long Yao was not absolutely sure he could defeat her based on strength alone. Moreover, there were no charges that he could place on her to use the Sacred City’s army, it was difficult for him to achieve his objective.

Jun Wu Xie had backed Long Yao into a corner, making him angry but powerless to act.

Long Yao’s silence basically meant his consent to Jun Wu Xie’s actions.

Bai Zhu stared incredulously at Long Yao, who by now had lowered his gaze to the ground. He could not believe that with Long Yao as protection, Jun Wu Xie could still get to him and even more so, that his plan which seemed like a sure bet just moments ago, laid in tatters.

Bai Zhu’s entire body was trembling, he could clearly feel Jun Wu Xie’s spiritual power radiating from his neck down. With despair in his eyes, he cried out in desperation, “Lord Long Yao please save me! I did it all for you....you can’t leave me in the lurch....”

Bai Zhu’s plea made Long Yao’s brows furrow even further. He suddenly looked up at Jun Wu Xie and said, “Although this may be a matter of the 72 Cities, don’t forget this arena is for the Top Ten masters selection and not a venue for your personal vendettas. If your actions taint this place, is that a responsibility you can bear?”

After thinking for a long time, Long Yao finally found an excuse that sounded reasonable and did not violate the Lord’s will.

Upon hearing Long Yao’s words, Bai Zhu heaved a sigh of relief.

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows and looked at Long Yao’s grey face, an impish smile formed on her face.

“So Lord Long Yao is only afraid that I will dirty the place. That’s a simple fix....”

Just as Bai ZHu thought his life was saved, Jun Wu Xie opened his mouth and forced a pill down his throat, making him swallow it.

Jun Wu Xie’s actions were as fast and smooth as flowing water, Long Yao had no time to react.

“Yan Hai, how dare you?!” Long Yao shouted furiously, his eyes open wide.
