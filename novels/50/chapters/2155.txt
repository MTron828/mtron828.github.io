Chapter 2156: Sudden Calamity Out of Nowhere (8)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord stood before the full length mirror and looked at himself in the suit of light armour he had just changed himself into. After eyeing himself critically for a rather long while, he then turned his head to look at Granny Yue.

“Little Yue, dressed in this, does it look good?”

Standing before Granny Yue and the masked girl, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had shed off the light and thin clothes on his body, and changed into a suit of fiery red armour. He had always had a tall figure but was always laid back and slothful, his body wrapped within loose robes where it was not obvious to see. Now that he had changed into a suit of light armour, it made him look exceptionally towering and valiant, and upon that bewitching countenance, there was a lack of his usual frivolous allure, but an added sharpness and gallant valor.

Granny Yue’s eyes were filled with smiles as she nodded and said: “Very good, my Lord looks very good like that.”

The masked girl at the side was stunned. She had been in the Spirit Jade Palace for so many years, but never had she seen the Palace Lord so serious about his dressing. The Spirit Jade Palace Lord who had changed out of his normal clothes now seemed like a totally different person, handsome and not lacking in imposing manliness, carrying a completely different air around him.

[This is their Palace Lord?]

“I think I look good in it as well. I have not seen this suit of armour for more than a thousand years and had thought that I would not have another chance to wear it again in this life. Back when all of you risked your lives to bring it out from our original palace, I had still admonished you all. Looking back at it now, I have been too shortsighted.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord smiled handsomely, and turned around with a grand flourish to sit heroically upon the soft couch, exuding an imposing and terrifying flair.

“Go gather up all of the disciples in here outside the palace. I have something to announce.”

“Yes, my Lord.” Granny Yue nodded, before retreating silently away.

The masked girl stood at the side to look at the Spirit Jade Palace Lord whose demeanor felt entirely different and her eyes flashed with a glint of awe.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord turned to look at the masked girl whose eyes were filled with surprise and he said with a light laugh: “What? Never seen your Lord looking like this?”

The masked girl nodded her head.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord lifted his eyes and looked out through the doors.

“It has also been a long time..... since I’ve seen myself like this.....”

From the day that the Spirit Jade Palace was brought down, that him of the past, had died.

Not knowing why, the masked girl seemed to have heard a sliver of sorrow from the Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s mouth, and she lowered her eyes in silence.

“You’ve been here in the Spirit Jade Palace for quite a long time, but not long enough to know this. Do you know why the Twelve Palaces had wanted to annihilate our Spirit Jade Palace back then?” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord asked suddenly.

“Your disciple does not know.”

“Because, I am the one and only person among the original Thirteen Palaces, from the time the palaces were founded, to hold the position of a Palace Lord.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord said and started to laugh.

The masked girl lifted her head up immediately.

It had already been several thousand years since the founding of the Spirit Jade Palace! Did that mean..... their Palace Lord had been alive for several thousand years?

“What they feared, was merely me, the only Gold Spirit within the Thirteen Palaces.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord said, his eyes suddenly narrowing, and the silver spirit glow swirling around his body turned a blinding gold in that instant!

Gold Spirit! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord was actually a Gold Spirit!

Not even in her dreams would the masked girl ever have thought, that over the span of so many years, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had actually been hiding his real powers. Outside of the Nine Temple Lords, he was the one and only Gold Spirit in existence!

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord stared at the Gold Spirit glow around his own body, but was not feeling the least bit proud of himself, but just a kind of imperceptible anguish that other people had not noticed.

In the eyes of people, the Gold Spirit was a realm so high it could not be reached, but they did not know that such peerless power, had instead pushed the Spirit Jade Palace into endless danger. What crime had been the Spirit Jade Palace’s disciples been guilty of?

Just because of this Gold Spirit of his, how many of the Spirit Jade Palace’s disciples have died?
