When the people from Sea Spirit City were preparing to enter the island to find the Sea Spirit Beasts, suddenly a shrill sound came into their ears, and a cold light, as fast as lightning, appeared in front of their eyes from within the trees! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The other people standing along the shore simply did not have time to react to what happened. In an instant, the cold light pierced through the team who were about to enter the jungle.

There were five people. But in that moment when the sound resounded, they were rooted to the ground. The look of shock was frozen on each of their faces till the very last moment, and in the next second, they had all collapsed.

Blood filled cavities appeared on the chests of all five men, penetrated from the front to the back, an arrowed was stuck in the sand behind them!

The heavy scent of blood permeated the surroundings, and filled the nostrils of everyone present...

“What is going on.....” The old man, who was bootlicking Yan Hai, had widened his eyes and looked at the brawny men who had fallen over, his face showed incredulity.

The arrow which was stained with fresh blood was nailed just a few steps away from their feet!

One arrow pierced through five people.

What a terrible power!

“This island is inhibited!” Someone let out a horrified yell, and everyone on the coast immediately panicked.

Yan Hai’s expression changed, and he shouted, “Who are you! Don’t hide the head and just show the tail! If you got the guts, come out and face me!”

The moment Yan Hai’s words sounded, a figure radiating murderous rage walked out of the jungle, and stood in front of them.

Wearing a light armor and a mask, Zi Fei looked like a killer of God descending from the sky as she materialised in the sight of everyone from Sea Soul City. She was holding in her hand, the longbow which had just taken five lives.

These people from the Sea Soul City, even though they were not comparable to the Upper Realm army, they still possessed the Gold Spirit; normal human strength were not comparable to them, but who would have thought that with only one arrow, it could penetrate five people.

This sort of explosive power made everyone stunned!

Yan Hai looked at the person who appeared in front of him with caution, his eyes darkly sweeping around, seemingly checking to see if there were other opponents hiding in the forest.

“Who are you? How dare you kill the Sea Soul City people! You have some nerves!” Yan Hai maintained his composure as he cursed at the person, he did not see any signs of other people.

Zi Fei squinted her eyes at this group of so-called Sea Soul City people. She came from the Upper Realm and naturally knew what those three words mean.

It is a purgatory made up of the bones of countless Sea Spirit Beasts.

“Who am I, you do not need to know, because you are going to die here very soon.” The killing intent in the eyes of Zi Fei grew more intense. The two vessels that were docked near the shore was covered in traces of blood. It was conceivable that the two ships have hunted many Sea Spirit Beasts before.

“What a brag! I want to see, just with you alone, how will you kill us all.” Yan Hai sneered. Zi Fei’s arrow shocked him but they outnumbered her, confronting the enemy directly, they were not scared of her at all!

Zi Fei didn’t speak further as he sharp gaze swept past everyone standing on the shore. She lifted her right hand slightly, a red light was silently revealed in her hand, as it gradually condensed into a striking ring.

Yan Hai looked incredulously at the red ring in the hands of Zi Fei, as he stood rooted to the ground as if he had been struck by lightning.

“Spirit Ring!”
