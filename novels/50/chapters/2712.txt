Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The battles within Long Xuan City raged on as more and more exponents emerged. Every day, numerous exponents lay dead on the streets of Long Xuan City. The bloody scent of death permeated the entire Long Xuan City. Corpses could be seen everywhere, making those of average strength in the city afraid and putting them at risk.

However ...

As the sun rose from the east, a slender figure could be seen, seated on a steed, approaching the gates of Long Xuan City amidst the clacking of hooves.

Behind her, several slender young men accompanied her.

“This is Long Xuan City?” Qiao Chu raised his hand to block the early morning sunlight, and squinted at Long Xuan City which was less than a hundred meters away.

At a glance, thick walls surrounded the entire city, its range so wide that people couldn’t see the corners.

“No wonder that Ruan Zhongshan was so arrogant before. This place is a lot bigger than Sea Spirit City.” Qiao Chu rubbed his chin as a nasty smile hung from the corner of his mouth, his thinking unknown to the rest.

“So what if it’s big? Since it has fallen into the hands of a bunch of idiots, and sooner or later the city will be finished. How many civilians have we seen, escaping from Long Xuan City along the way? If this keeps up, this Long Xuan City will become a ghost city sooner or later.” Fei Yan pursed his lips in disapproval.

“That’s not true. There are still a lot of people left in the city. The chaos nowadays is temporary. Once a new City Lord in Long Xuan City is elected, everything will return to normal.” Fan Zhuo shrugged, he was already used to such fighting in the Upper Realm.

Jun Wu Xie who was riding in front of the group of people did not speak. She just kept her face cold and urged the horse under her to continue to walk towards the gates of Long Xuan City.

Due to the lack of a City Lord, the soldiers in Long Xuan City have been left unmanaged, and the gates, that should have been guarded, were left unattended. Thus, Jun Wu Xie did not meet any obstacles or questions when they entered the city. They came to the main street of Long Xuan City. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The streets of Long Xuan City were very wide as compared with the narrowness of Sea Spirit City, the buildings in the city were relatively dense. Even in the early morning, there were many people walking around the streets.

However, the expressions of those city dwellers were a little nervous, and their pace involuntarily accelerated as they walked, all looking very rushed.

There was a faint bloody smell wafting through the whole city. It was very light, but still it could not escape Jun Wu Xie.

After walking for a while, they saw a broken corpse lying on the corner of the street, blood had coagulated under it, but the corpse was left untreated, and the stench of decay has started.

“Where is the City Lord’s manor?” Jun Wu Xie paused her footsteps and turned to look at Zheng Weilong, who was at the end of the line.

Zheng Weilong pointed it out to Jun Wu Xie.

She had stayed in Sea Spirit City for a few days, but suddenly received news that Jun Wu Xie was going to Long Xuan City and needed her to lead the way. Zheng Weilong followed them without saying a word. She thought Jun Wu Xie wanted to lead her army to attack Long Xuan City, but when she found out that Jun Wu Xie’s travelling companions were only Chu Qiao and five others, as well as Ye Sha and her, she was a little confused.

What did Jun Wu Xie want to do?

Unfortunately, Jun Wu Xie was not interested in explaining anything to Zheng Weilong, she just walked in the direction pointed out by Zheng Weilong.

The front gates of the City Lord’s manor was covered in blood.

The manor which symbolised the prestige of Long Xuan City had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in this period.
