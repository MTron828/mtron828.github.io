Chapter 3007 You Have Returned 2

Qiao Chu and the rest looked at the stumbling puppet in disbelief, not daring to believe their eyes. They were frozen as they looked towards Jun Wu Xie stiffly, as if to ask for an explanation.

Yet Jun Wu Xie just motioned for them to observe silently.

The sudden silence disconcerted Fei Yan. He tried to move his head to listen for any movement. The feeling of not being able to make out anything in the dark made him very uncomfortable.

“Little Xie? Dumb Qiao? Why have you gone quiet?” Fei Yan said hoarsely.

With his eyes bandaged, he could not see that at the very moment he spoke, the puppet who had been making its way toward him, froze. When the puppet looked up and saw that Fei Yan was covered in bandages, the pain it felt could be seen in its big, gentle eyes.

The little puppet, warmly reached out and gently rested its hand on Fei Yan’s right little finger.

The cold, unfamiliar feeling made Fei Yan shudder and he called out, “Little Xie?”

A voice wracked with pain and guilt came from the room, “I’m sorry.”

Qiao Chu and the rest looked on in disbelief as the puppet started to talk, they had no idea what was going on.

But Fei Yan....froze suddenly.

It was a nice voice, gentle and melodic, obviously that of a stranger. He did not know why when the voice rang out, it seemed to shake Fei Yan and started to uncover the feelings that he had been suppressing all those days.

“Who are you?!” Fei Yan asked.

Puppet Rong Ruo did not speak again and just looked painfully at Fei Yan’s bandaged face. He could picture, underneath the layers of bandages, the moment before the explosion and Fei Yan’s blood covered face determined to die, telling him to leave.

If....

If he exploded earlier, Fei Yan might not have been so badly hurt, and the one who survived might be the soul of his sister.

Rong Ruo could not return Fei Yan’s love because from the start, he had not really been Rong Ruo. The one that Fei Yan loved was his sister and not him.

If....

If he was earlier, maybe everything would have been perfect.

Just when Rong Ruo was caught up in guilt, Fei Yan suddenly opened his mouth once more and asked in a trembling voice, “Little Ruo, is that you?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The moment Fei Yan said that, everyone in the room was stunned.

Qiao Chu was stunned for a while before finally saying tremblingly, “Fei Yan, you...”

Are you crazy?

Before Qiao Chu could finish, Fei Yan sat up straight and reached out with his left hand saying excitedly, “Little Ruo! It’s you isn’t it? You didn’t die! Little Ruo I knew you didn’t die! You’re back right?”

The hoarse voice echoed in the quiet room, and in that moment, everyone was holding their breath, looking at Fei Yan’s left hand waving in the air.

Qiao Chu could not bear to look any longer, and turned his face away. Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo also lowered their heads.

Only Jun Wu Xie continued to look at the stiff puppet.
