Suddenly, Situ Heng felt a strong uneasiness lingering inside him. He tightened his lips and his face stiffened.

The soul of Jun Wu Xie had fully recovered. With everyone looking at her in surprise, she stood up and faced directly at Situ Heng who was holding up a twisted expression on his face.

“You looked surprised, don’t you?”

Situ Heng didn’t speak anything but just clenched his teeth.

Qiao Chu and the others were about to talk to Jun Wu Xie but they suddenly came to a halt the moment they saw Jun Wu Xie began to speak to Situ Heng.

Their eyes were in confusion, wandering around Situ Heng and Jun Wu Xie. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Did you say it just now, that my soul is going to rip apart?” Situ Heng didn’t make a sound, causing Jun Wu Xie to open her mouth and speak again with an obvious coldness in her tone.

Even insensitive people like Long Jiu too, had noticed there was something wrong. While being at a loss, he looked at Jun Wu Xie and asked. “Hey lass, what’s going on? Why are you doing this out of a sudden...you scared us all out of our wits.”

Jun Wu Xie looked at Long Jiu. After her eyes glanced over Long Jiu, they then went back to Situ Heng.

“Everything that has happened today was just an act between me and the Spirit Lord. We just wanted to know what a certain someone was planning.”

This had made everyone to catch a trace of unusualness by listening to Jun Wu Xie’s words.

Almost everybody’s eyes were focusing on Situ Heng due to Jun Wu Xie’s words. They felt that the things Jun Wu Xie did definitely had something to do with Situ Heng.

Furthermore...

Previously, Situ Heng would always remain silent but as soon as Jun Wu Xie began to grow effete, he suddenly targeted at the Spirit Lord and had given him a hard time. Just come to think about it again, there was surely something wrong with his attitude.

“What are you trying to say?” Situ Heng tried hard to calm himself down, preventing himself from showing any sign of guilt.

The Soul Devourer was buried inside Jun Wu Xie’s soul by him with his own hands. Once the Soul Devourer invaded her soul, it would be really difficult for her to remove it. If she decided to remove it by force, it would definitely cause a huge damage on her soul. However, throughout these days, Situ Heng did participate in every round of Jun Wu Xie’s treatment and the time intervals between them were not that long. If there was any abnormality that appeared in the soul of Jun Wu Xie, he would have noticed it.

But within these two months, the condition of Jun Wu Xie’s spirit was very stable. There was no possibility for the Soul Devourer to be removed.

“Nothing, it’s just that I have two questions to ask you,” said Jun Wu Xie.

“Little lass... What are you...” No matter how stupid Long Jiu was, he was still able to tell that Jun Wu Xie was picking on Situ Heng, but he totally did not understand the reason of her acting like that. It was true that Situ Heng and Jun Wu Xie did not get along well with each other in the past, but Situ Heng did make an effort this time for the treatment of Jun Wu Xie. It would be quite inappropriate for Jun Wu Xie to show her enmity towards Situ Heng during this moment...

Jun Wu Xie didn’t care about Long Jiu’s doubt. She just kept on staring at Situ Heng whose face was stiffened and she then slightly open her lips. “First question, why do you want to kill me? Second, were you the one who let the people from the Upper Realm sneak into the Spirit World?”

Both the questions were like two striking thunderbolts, causing everyone to tremble in astonishment. They widened their eyes in disbelief, not wanting to believe what they had just heard.

Situ Heng wanted to kill Jun Wu Xie?

Situ Heng was the one who let Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord in during that time?

What the hell was going on?

As Jun Wu Xie voiced out her questions, the expression of Situ Heng was getting worse and worse. He actually didn’t think that the Soul Devourer inside Jun Wu Xie’s soul wouldn’t show its effect, moreover... she had already discovered some of the secrets...
