Chapter 3024 Entering tiger’s den 4

“There is one thing that I really want to ask.” Jun Wu Xie lowered her gaze.

“Oh? What’s the matter?” Su Ruiying asked.

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes slightly. Her cold eyes met Su Ruiying’s eyes, “That day, why did Long Yao look for you?”

Croak!

The smile on Su Ruiying’s face shattered in an instant. She looked at Jun Wu Xie stiffly. She could hardly believe what she had heard.

“You ... what do you mean ...” Su Ruiying couldn’t laugh at all.

Jun Wu Xie said: “That day, I saw Long Yao coming out of your mansion. I believe it’s because of me that he came to look for you. After all, it’s always your responsibility to erase the memories of a Knight of Destruction, right?”

Jun Wu Xie’s tone was not fast, but it was like a cold wind crossing, taking away the temperature of Su Ruiying’s body. She looked at Jun Wu Xie in horror, her hands on her knees began to shake uncontrollably.

“You know about it?” Su Ruiying almost extruded from her throat. The fear in her heart was magnified infinitely at this moment.

“What do you say?” Jun Wu Xie raised his eyebrows slightly.

Su Ruiying took a deep breath and almost stood up from the chair almost instantly. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Long Yao came over himself. I didn’t say anything to him at all. Yan Hai, I actively invited you as my guest as I had originally intended to be good with you. I believe you can see this. Long Yao is a Knight of Destruction, but his strength is far weaker than you. I don’t need to offend you because of him. “Su Ruiying almost instantly confirmed that Jun Wu Xie knew everything. Otherwise, Jun Wu Xie would not have suddenly mentioned this matter at this time.

Su Ruiying was anxious to clarify the relationship between Long Yao and herself, and she didn’t even think about Jun Wu Xie’s words at all.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Su Ruiying’s reaction in her eyes. A flash of chill flashed in her eyes.

In fact, Jun Wu Xie didn’t know why Long Yao came to find Su Ruiying. She just tried to test her out subconsciously. But she didn’t expect Su Ruiying to be so nervous.

However, Long Yao was now dead and seeing Su Ruiying overreacting and looking so frightened, it was apparent that she was deeply afraid that it would implicate her.

“It turns out so.” Jun Wu Xie didn’t reveal anything else, but her tone was ambiguous.

“That’s natural, and I’m not a fool.” Su Ruiying propped up her composure. But her eyes were empty.

“Since Lady Ying is so hospitable, can I live in your house in the next few days? Fortunately, if I don’t understand anything, I can ask you in time.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Su Ruiying almost cried. If it was the last time, she can’t wait for Jun Wu Xie to live in her house. Now she ... she was really scared, even though she could manipulate the soul, Long Yao had already been killed so easily. She was extremely terrified, how could she dare to keep this death god, Jun Wu Xie?

But...

The words have already been spoken. There was no reason to change it now.

Su Ruiying could only say with a stifled smile as the corner of her lips twitched: “Of course you may, as long as Yan Hai doesn’t find this place too small. You can live for as long as you want.”

“Sorry for the trouble then.” Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly and said, “But I don’t like those puppets, so please find me a room without puppets.”
