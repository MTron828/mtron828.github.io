3047 The Lost Temples 7

Jun Wu Xie had long noticed Qin Qi staring at her but pretended not to notice.

“You are Qin Qi?” Gu Ying suddenly asked.

At this Qin Qi finally tore his gaze away from Jun Wu Xie and looked at Gu Ying before replying respectfully, “Yes Highness Ying, I am your subject Qin Qi.”

“Why were you staring at Lord Yan?” With that one sentence, Gu Ying exacerbated an already awkward situation.

Su Ruiying almost choked on her food when she heard this. Although Gu Ying was not wrong, his statement was a bit too straightforward.

Qin Qi did not see anything out of the ordinary about his interest in Jun Wu Xie and said openly, “Because your subject is curious.”

“Curious?” Gu Ying raised his eyebrows.

“Yes, Lord Yan is from the Sea Spirit City, one of the72 Cities. I come from a city not far from there and am familiar with the Sea Spirit City. I’m just curious how an average place like that could produce such an extraordinarily strong person, in addition to the fact that he is so young.” Qin Qi said openly, in stark contrast to the impression he gave people.

“Lord Yan, since there is nothing much else to do tonight, why don’t you tell us? I heard you got much stronger after your first trip at sea, did something happen on the trip to cause your strength to increase exponentially?” Why don’t you tell us to kill some time?” Qin Qi said with a smile in a casual, chatty tone.

Su Ruiying didn’t dare make a sound. Qin Qi’s question sounded lighthearted but it was by no means so. It was obviously an attempt to find the origins of Jun Wu Xie’s strength and such matters were taboo to discuss. Qin Qi was no fool, why would he ask such a question in public?

Su Ruiying could not determine if Qin Qi was doing this on his own accord or if Chi Yan had put him up to it. Nevertheless, in the spirit of self preservation, she pretended not to hear anything.

Jun Wu Xie raised her head in the firelight, and her clear eyes focussed on the firelight.

“What are you?” The coldness in the voice enveloped everyone there like an icy gust of wind.

Qin Qi was stunned, he did not expect such a response. After recovering, he put on a smile and said, “I’ve overstepped, I am Qin Qi, Lord Chi Yan’s subordinate.”

“In what way are you qualified to ask me that?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed, the chill once again returning to her voice.

Qin Qi could not maintain that smile much longer. As Chi Yan’s confidante, he had gained the respect of many despite his lack of strength and in Sacred City, not many people dared to disrespect him.

Was it not the case with Su Ruiying, who tolerated him out of respect for Chi Yan? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

But with those two sentences, Jun Wu Xie thoroughly disrespected him, leaving him no place to hide.

Qin Qi continued to plaster on that smile and said, “Lord Yan does not need to be so angry, I was just asking casually. Since you will be by His Lord’s side, in a highly enviable position, I just wanted to hear of your past glories and achievements.”
