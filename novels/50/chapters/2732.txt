“Which five cities?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Ye Sha’s eyes subconsciously looked at Zheng Weilong, as he did not know about the uniforms of the 72 cities in the Upper Realm.

Zheng Weilong consciously said, “Blazing Flame City, Hidden Demon City, Resolute City, Heaven Fiend City and Epic Vesper City.”

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows slightly. Zheng Weilong continued: “These five cities are among the top ten cities within the 72 cities. Excluding Discerning Moon City, among the 72 cities, the ten strongest cities are called the ‘Top Ten Cities’. These past few years, there have been constant strife and veiled struggles. The 72 cities can remain separate to this day is mostly because each of the top ten cities wants to dominate all the cities but is unable to do so. Hence, the 72 cities are in a stalemate till now.”

Zheng Weilong paused and continued: “But the top ten cities have now divided themselves into two factions, one faction is headed by White Night City which is ranked number 1. The other faction consists of the Five City Coalition, led by Blazing Flame City. The two sides have fought against each other for many years. I’m guessing that Blazing Flame City has just received the news and wants to take the preemptive step in obtaining the prescription which you possess.”

Zheng Weilong’s analysis was very accurate, and briefly outlined the situation of the top ten cities.

The original purpose of Jun Wu Xie had been achieved. It was very rare to directly attract the attention of the top ten cities. With the original status of Sea Spirit City, no highly ranked city would willing set food into Sea Spirit City. Even when the supply of the Sea Spirit Beasts had been cut off, the top ten cities only asked those affiliated cities to send people to urge Sea Spirit City. Those who belonged to the top ten cities did not bother to set foot here.

“They want the formula? Just let them come! Just so happens I have not exercised my muscles for the past few days, it’s good to warm them up.” The moment Qiao Chu heard that people were here for provocation, he immediately livened up!

Jun Wu Xie looked at Qiao Chu, whose blood was surging, and shook her head slightly.

“No need to fight, Ye Sha, let them in.” Jun Wu Xie said suddenly.

Jun Wu Xie’s words shocked Qiao Chu.

“Little Xie, you want to let them in? Why? The purpose of those guys is so clear. By letting them in... Wouldn’t it...” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Not really, I believe the City Lord is using this incident to trap the Five City Coalition. Although they are arrogant, they are not invincible. They have requested to enter the city instead of attacking directly, and that means they must have some apprehension. Although the five cities are working together in an alliance, they must have exercised some caution against each other. Once a battle starts, neither party would want to lose their own people. Moever, they still have to deal with the might of White Night City at their backs. So if they have a choice, they will definitely choose to avoid war. Since the City Lord is willing to let them in, he probably wants to take advantage of the contradictions between them and do something.” Zheng Weilong said in a tempered tone, but with her words, she had already guessed more than 70-80% of Jun Wu Xie’s intention.

Fan Zhuo could not help but be surprised at Zheng Weilong. Zheng Weilong had only started following Jun Wu Xie for a short while, but she could easily guess Jun Wu Xie’s intentions. Although Jun Wu Xie did not deliberately hide it, but the fact that she could observe and analyse with such accuracy, Zheng Weilong’s mind was really quite brilliant.

Fan Zhuo had to lament that Jun Wu Xie knew how to read people. Although Zheng Weilong’s strength is not up to par, but if her mind is used to its full potential, she could definitely play a greater role than any exponent.
