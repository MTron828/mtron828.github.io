Jun Wu Xie looked up at Zheng Weilong who was surprised. “I won’t do this. Your ultimate goal is freedom. I will give you your freedom. As for how to do it, that is something that I shall consider.”

Zheng Weilong had wanted to say something else, but the indifferent and firm look on Jun Wu Xie’s face made her keep her mouth shut, as she nodded, “Then I shall leave it to my Lord to arrange.”

Jun Wu Xie’s scheme was more important than her freedom, so Zheng Weilong was not worried that Jun Wu Xie will destroy her plan.

After a good discussion, Jun Wu Xie asked Ye Sha to arrange accommodation for Zheng Weilong and Ah Da, so that they didn’t have to live in that shabby hut.

Zheng Weilong naturally agreed with pleasure.

After Zheng Weilong left, Jun Wu Yao, who had been in the backyard, came out. He directly lifted Jun Wu Xie from the chair, and nuzzled his chin to her cheek as he held her in his arms.

“At least now you’re being honest.” Jun Wu Yao smiled. Zheng Weilong’s proposal was good and if it were in the past, Jun Wu Xie would have agreed to it immediately.

Otherwise, she would not have “married” Qu Lingyue at that time.

However, this kind of thing, even if it was fake, was simply unbearable for Jun Wu Yao.

He had to endure a Qu Lingyue, and he definitely could not endure a second ‘wife’, not after he and Jun Wu Xie had married.

Jun Wu Xie looked up slightly to Jun Wu Yao’s handsome face, as she slowly raised her hand, and touched his cheek.

“I know.”

“I know you don’t like it. Since I’m your wife, I won’t make a joke about it.”

Jun Wu Yao laughed, his heart was suddenly at ease.

Everything in Sea Spirit City was stable. Although Zheng Weilong has cooperated with Jun Wu Xie, she knew her value ​​very well. Even if she was allowed to live in Sea Spirit City by Jun Wu Xie, she did not stray from her current residence, nor did she try to learn about the prescription for the elixir.

Jun Wu Xie was very satisfied with this. Smart people always did things with a peace of mind.

The situation on the side of the Sea Spirit City was stable, but things in Long Xuan City was as messy as a pot of porridge. The soldiers who fled from the battlefield of Sea Spirit City were all in dire straits by the time they returned to Long Xuan City. Each of them seemed to have lost their soul, as they broke down crying the moment they entered their city.

Soon, the news that Ruan Zhongshan died in battle, and that the army of Long Xuan City was completely abused spread throughout the entire city. For a moment, the news really shocked everyone in Long Xuan City.

If it weren’t for the despair of those crying deserters, the other citizens of Long Xuan City would not have believed that it was all true.

However, the shock in Long Xuan City did not last long. The death of Ruan Zhongshan instantly pushed the originally, relatively stable Long Xuan City into chaos. Numerous strong men who had been crushed by Ruan Zhongshan emerged and Immediately after that, a new round of scramble for the lordship of the city began.

No one felt sad for Ruan Zhongshan’s death, and no one shed a tear for him. Those who bent and bowed their heads at him, those who used to be his lackeys have begun to fight for the supreme position in Long Xuan City!

The entire Long Xuan City was caught in chaos, and in just a few days, large and small battles rang throughout Long Xuan City. The chaos made many lowly civilians flee from Long Xuan City to seek protection elsewhere.

However, in this chaos, the strong men of Long Xuan City did not realize the danger had arrived...RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
