Chapter 3100 Killing A God 6

Han Zi Fei was troubled, she was carrying Hua Yao on her back and her clothes were soaked with Hua Yao’s blood, making it cool to the touch. What troubled Han Zi Fei was the guards’ strange situation.

“I’m not sure but I have a feeling something bad is happening.” Han Zi Fei’s heart was beating fast as a sense of uneasiness washed over her.

In a flash, the guards were turned into corpses in front of their very eyes. All their strength and power were sucked out of their bodies by the golden light, accompanied by screams of pain.

Han Zi Fei’s uneasiness reached its peak in an instant. She could feel her spiritual body increasing rapidly and instead of bringing her joy, it filled her with a fear for her survival!

“This is terrible! It’s an integrated reincarnation spell!” She exclaimed as the colour drained from her face.

She was a Sacred Maiden from the Sacred Maiden Tribe. The previous two Sacred Maidens had served at the side of the God of Destruction. If Han Zi Fei hadn’t discovered the God of Destruction’s plan back then and escaped from the Upper Realms earlier, she might have been sent to the God of Destruction’s side just like the other two before her.

In any case, she had been taught from a young age to serve the God of Destruction and so over the years had much contact with him and understood many of his secrets.

Back then, she thought he was just a cruel master and not the God of Destruction who wanted to destroy the world!

“Integrated reincarnation spell? What is that?” Jun Gu furrowed his eyebrows, feeling the same uneasiness as Han Zi Fei.

Han Zi Fei looked very uncomfortable, she was constantly shifting her spiritual energy within her body, trying to counteract the spell but it was not having any effect.

“This is a spell of the God of Destruction that extracts the spiritual power and life force of anyone in its path and sends it to the God of Destruction to be absorbed into his own body. If he is using it, it means that Little Xie has recovered and is overpowering him.”

“According to what you’ve just said, then everyone’s power will be part of the God of Destruction’s. That would put Little Xie in grave danger!” Jun Gu shook his head, instead of rejoicing at his daughter’s recovery, the news filled him with even more worry.

Han Zi Fei remained silent. Although she knew what the spell was, she did not know how to break it.

At that moment, they could feel their spiritual power reaching its peak and start to leave their bodies uncontrollably. Moreover their feet felt like they were stuck to the ground, unable to move even an inch.

Before long, they would be just like those guards, corpses on the ground.....

Fear and helplessness ruled their hearts as they could only wait for their impending death.

However....

Just when things were at their most dire, two light golden circles appeared and encircled both of them and also Qiao Chu and the rest!Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
