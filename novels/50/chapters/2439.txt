Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Before entering her cell, Luo Qingcheng vaguely saw an inverted reflection of herself, and it was just a glance in a blink of an eye. She dared not look any further.

Su Ya let out a sigh of relief as she saw the jail cell. It was said that this cell was specially built for Luo Qingcheng after Jun Wu Xie arrived in the Lower Realm. Exactly how the jail cell looked, it was Su Ya’s first time seeing it.

She had initially thought that Jun Wu Xie would imprison Luo Qingcheng is a hidden place with no sunlight, but she didn’t expect that...

This was such a special place.

Suddenly, the edge of Su Ya’s lips lifted with a hint of a smile. As a woman, she could entirely understand the meaning behind Jun Wu Xie’s special arrangements.

“Put her inside.” Su Ya told the guards. She did not want to have any physical contact with this extremely disgusting woman.

“No! I don’t want to go in! Kill me! If you have the capability, just kill me! You sluts!!!!” Luo Qingcheng struggled violently against the guards, even though she was seriously injured and bound by the Soul Binding Chains. She was a useless person who could not even summon even strength to truss a chicken. The guards did not need to expend any energy to drag her into the cell, as they anchored the chains in each corner of the jail cell.

The shackles of the Soul Binding Chains were like the strings of a pupper, holding Luo Qingcheng in the cell.

On the ceiling, twelve candles burned brightly, illuminating every corner of the room, and made everything in the room looked so clear such that even the ugliness of Luo Qingcheng was revealed and highlighted.

“Ah ah ah!” screamed Luo Qingcheng in insanity. No matter where she looked, all she could see was the sight of her broken and beaten self.

Burnt flesh, bleeding and seeping facial wounds, this was an evil ghost who crawled out of hell!

This is not her!

Not her!

“Kill me! Kill me!!!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Luo Qingcheng didn’t dare to look, not even a glimpse. She cannot accept the fact that she had turned into such a terrible state.

Living like this, she’d rather die!

Su Ya stood unmovingly outside the jail cell as she watched Luo Qingcheng descend into madness. Her eyes downturned.

[Master, Bu Gui, can you see this?]

....

Within the city, the people who returned still have not stopped celebrating. Who would have thought that among the Realms, the most despised Lower Realm could actually win!

This battle has showed exactly how strong the Lower Realm was!

Mu Chen and Bai Xu did not stop for a rest and began treating the injured.

Jun Xian walked down the city floor and as he looked at the pair of figures who walked side by side. His handsome face involuntarily broke into a relieved smile.

Jun Wu Yao saw Jun Xian and nodded at him, smiling slightly.

“Why don’t you go wash off the blood?” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie and asked her sternly. Jun Wu Xie did not say rebut but just nodded her head earnestly, shook off Jun Wu Yao’s arm around her waist and headed off to wash up.

Jun Wu Yao held a smile as he watched the departing figure of Jun Wu Xie. The reluctance to part, clear in his eyes.

Upon seeing this, Jun Xian’s heart was slightly relieved, They already knew everything about Jun Wu Yao, including the fact that there was indescribable relationship between Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie .

“Do you have time to speak?” asked Jun Xian.

Jun Wu Yao replied, “Anytime.”
