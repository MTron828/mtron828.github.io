He returned with a big victory. In front of the throne, he did not seek wealth and fame, but a marriage between him and her.

A few years had passed. He had aged and lost his youthfulness. He fought on the battlefields and earned himself a good reputation. She sat in front of the bed at home and supported the little life in her belly.

All of a sudden, it flashed back to that year, that day, that moment ...

“Fool.” Han Zi Fei chuckled slightly. Her voice containing the smile broke the silence in the hall at this moment.

Jun Gu suddenly returned back to his senses. Apparently he realised his inappropriateness and quickly apologized, “This is so rude of me.”

Han Zi Fei looked at him with a smile. This was the man whom she loved for a lifetime. She thought they would never see each other again in this lifetime, but did not expect that they would reunite after so much had happened.

She was afraid that her real identity would be exposed and brought a fatal disaster to Lin Palace. She could only abandon the child wrapped in swaddle and fake her own death. Never had she imagined that, today, both her husband and child would appear in front of her.

Han Zi Fei smiled faintly and wondered if she should laugh at these unbelievable happenings or for some other reason?

Jun Gu regained his gaze slightly in a stiff manner as he felt his heart pounding uncontrollably within as a faint suspicious blush bloomed on his face.

Even a fool could tell what was happening after seeing Jun Gu’s expression.

Jun Gu fell in love with Han Zi Fei at first sight, without any dissatisfaction.

Duan Qi and others reassured that as long as Jun Gu was satisfied, everything that follows was logical.

But Yan Xi clenched her teeth. She looked at Jun Gu from the side and saw the infatuation that manifested in his eyes. Her whole brain was buzzing and she couldn’t think of anything else as she stared incredulously.

How could this be?

How could this be?

Yan Xi couldn’t believe that Jun Gu fancied Han Zi Fei at a glance!

Although Jun Gu’s temperament was gentle, he was very weak when it comes to relationship matters. Before sending Han Zi Fei, His Lord had sent many beautiful and unparalleled women for Jun Gu and sent them to Jun Gu one by one. Each and every woman, without exception, was kicked out by Jun Gu.

For so many years, Jun Gu only had her by his side. Yan Xi had always thought that she was special to Jun Gu. Jun Gu’s tepidness towards her was all because of his character. She thought she had owned all of Jun Gu.

Never would she have ever thought that...

Jun Gu was not heartless, but the person who captured his heart had not appeared yet...

The appearance of Han Zi Fei made Yan Xi really see Jun Gu who had a fresh new expression which showed his deep affection but it disappointed her at the same time.

Suddenly, Yan Xi raised her head. She stared at Han Zi Fei with her bloodshot eyes as if they would bleed in the next moment.

However, Han Zi Fei simply glanced at Yan Xi’s fuming face and looked away casually. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Sacred Maiden, you’re being too rude towards Lord Jun Gu, I’m afraid it is inappropriate!” Yan Xi squeezed these words out of her teeth.

Yan Xi’s words made Duan Qi and the others, who were just relieved, immediately glare at her.

What happened to Yan Xi? When did Han Zi Fei insult Jun Gu?

At this moment, Duan Qi couldn’t wait to cover Yan Xi’s mouth so that she would have less trouble and should not mess things up in front of Jun Gu.

Jun Gu froze for a moment. He was so absorbed in Han Zi Fei’s appearance that he did not respond to what Yan Xi was saying.
