Chapter 2982 The four knights 1

Even outside of the Sacred City, the influence of the word “Knight of Destruction” was far less than the Top Ten Experts.

However, they actually had enough power and were the closest to the supreme person in the Upper Realm. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Outside the residence, two units of armored soldiers stood on both sides of the gate in an orderly manner. At first glance, it gave people a solemn sense of depression. Few people lived in and the front of the door was empty.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao quietly released each other’s hands under the moonlight. Jun Wu Xie restrained her gentleness and was replaced by her usual solitude. She walked forward and rubbed her shoulders with Jun Wu Yao. She caught a glimpse of Jun Wu Yao’s smile at the corner of his mouth.

The guard standing outside the house noticed the arrival of Jun Wu Xie. With no intention to block her, the guard headed forward solemnly and politely: “Lord Yan, my lord has been waiting in the house for a long time . ”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. The guard led her into the garden.

Unlike the luxurious residences in the main cities, Chi Yan’s residence looked very cold. Most of the decoration and furniture in the house were made of dark red wood. Under the candlelight, it had no hint of warmth, instead, it gave people a chilling feeling.

Through the long corridor, the guard led Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao into a hall deeper within the residence.

After entering the long corridor, the lights in the hall were bright. Jun Wu Xie could see everyone in the hall clearly.

There were five main seats in the entire hall. Right opposite the door, there was a man wearing a crimson robe. He had a stoic face and a burly figure. Although the man’s facial features were handsome, his eyes were too sharp, which made him look like a sword out of its sheath.

Without much thought, this person should be Chi Yan.

And on this left, there were two men seated. When she saw the two of them, a glint flashed by her eyes.

Sitting at the position closest to Chi Yan, wasn’t that Long Yao whom Jun Wu Xie had been fighting with and ended up destroying five of the Top Ten Experts?

At this moment, Long Yao had a somber face. He sat with his legs crossed with dark shadows under his eyes. It seemed that these days he was in a state of indignation, he was unable to take a good rest. When he saw Jun Wu Xie’s figure, there was a hint of indifference and reluctance in his eyes.

And the person sitting next to Long Yao warmed Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

The gentleman in a black robe, sitting upright at the table with a gentle smile on the corner of his mouth. When he saw Jun Wu Xie come in, he did not reveal too much affection. He just nodded slightly, and it looked just right.

Sitting on the right-hand side of Chi Yan was an ordinary-looking woman. But if to describe her appearance as ordinary, it would be considered as ugly. So was her figure. She couldn’t hide the two scars on her face. The two scars that made up a big cross had been slit across the woman’s face. A large proportion of her eyes were white and they looked lifeless. When she narrowed her eyes at Jun Wu Xie, she looked, not a sliver of emotions could be seen.
