“I will do as you have instructed. Then... do you want to tell other cities about the news from Sea Spirit City?” Xu Zu looked at Ruan Chongshan hesitantly, because Long Xuan City and the Sea Spirit City were closer in distance, and in light of the insufficient supply of Sea Soul Beast, many cities have relayed the news to Ruan Chongshan, and had asked him to send someone to Sea Spirit City to find out what happened.

“Tell them half of what we know.” Ruan Zhongshan sneered.

“Half?” Xu Zu was stunned slightly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ruan Chongshan crossed his arms and rested them on the table, his eyes were shuttered as he said, “Hasn’t Yan Hai uttered conceited nonsense about how he will no longer supply a single drop of Sea Spirit Beast blood? You can pass that piece of news to several of the city lords. The newly appointed City Lord is ignorant and needs to be taught some lessons. ”

Xu Zu immediately understood the meaning of Ruan Chongshan’s statement.

Ruan Zhongshan wanted that elixir for himself, but to deliberately create difficulties for Sea Spirit City; he didn’t plan to do it alone.

“I will do so, right away!” Xu Zu’s face could not help but showed a happy look, the shame of being hurt by Jun Wu Xie made him uncomfortable. Now that Ruan Chongshan had told him only disseminate half of the information obtained, it would absolutely create a huge dissatisfaction between other cities and Sea Spirit City. Until that time, Long Xuan City would not need to lift a finger, Sea Spirit City would be bombarded by the other cities.

Xu Zu received his orders and immediately retreated from the study.

Ruan Chongshan sneered as he looked out at the pine and cypress in the yard.

An ordinary man is guileless, but a talented person would arouse the envy of others. If the medicine really existed, then the new City Lord of the Sea Spirit City can only be blamed for being an ignorant kid as he didn’t know how to to conceal one’s strengths and bide one’s time.

“My Lord, you are in a good mood?” The steward said as he observed Ruan Zhongshan’s expression diligently.

“Indeed, it’s good. I have established diplomatic relations with Guan Yue City and received good news from Sea Spirit City. Of course, I’m in a good mood.” Ruan Zhongshan chuckled.

“It seems that My Lord is confident over the matter in Guan Yue City.”

Ruan Zhongshan raised an eyebrow but made no comment.

...

In Sea Spirit City, after Jun Wu Xie had released the bait, she didn’t bother about these things again. While the people of Long Xuan City went back to spread the news, Jun Wu Xie, Qiao Chu and others supplemented their forces against the Upper Realm.

The entire Sea Spirit City was in the hands of the Night Regime and the Ghost Army. In addition to training, they were strictly guarding the inside and outside of the Sea Spirit City.

Jun Wu Xie secretly refined a batch of elixir. Among them, there were not many therapeutic elixirs, but there were a lot of venomous poisons.

With the growth of strength, the spiritual power in the human body would gradually change from being stored in the veins to being transformed into the internal organs. Although it was not a stronghold that was insurmountable, but the defense of the internal organs was greatly improved. As a result, resistance to toxicity had also increased.

The poison that Jun Wu Xie refined previously could not take on its full effect on the Gold Spirits of the Upper Realm. It was used on something with Spiritual Inscriptions and those who possessed Spirit Rings, the effects would be less than minimal.

Although she had established her stronghold in Sea Spirit City, Jun Wu Xie did not dare to relax her vigilance. The medical techniques of her past and present lives had not been abandoned by here as she now was using them to create highly toxic drugs.

During the time which Jun Wu Xie was refining her medicine, no one was allowed to come near. Now, she possessed Dual Spirit Ring, so the severity of toxicity she could endure was not something that someone else could withstand without succumbing to death. Hence, during this time, even Qiao Chu and the others wisely stayed away.
