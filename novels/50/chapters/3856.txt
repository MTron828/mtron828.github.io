Chapter 2452: The Cute Lord Jue (6)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The state of not knowing whether to laugh or cry, Qiao Chu and the rest really understood and experienced it, as they witnessed with their own eyes Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao seriously going through the process of getting married. They really wanted to cry.

They had thought that they were very lacking in terms of common sense, but having witnessed the reactions of Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao, they felt that they were as normal as they could get!

While Qiao Chu and the rest were feeling so embarrassed till they did not know what to do, Ye Mei and Ye Sha were all too pleased with themselves regarding the arrangements they had made.

In the remaining time, Qiao Chu and the others stared dumbly as they watched Jun Wu Yao pulled Jun Wu Xie onto the sea of flowers, hugged her and flew away.

“What is Brother Wu Yao doing...” Qiao Chu stared fixedly at the scene, he didn’t dare to believe that Jun Wu Yao would want to do “normal people’ things.

At this moment, Ye Sha and Ye Mei came out with smiles upon their faces as they worked diligently to free Qiao Chu and the others, who were buried in that sea of flowers. With overt pride colouring their tone, “Of course he is bringing Miss to wander around the lake and look at the lanterns.”

Wander the lake? Look at lanterns?

Qiao Chu and the rest were just too shocked.

They were finally pulled out of the sea of flowers although they had yet to recover from the shock of witnessing the weird actions of Jun Wu Yao. Before they could even brush away the flower petals from their clothes, they heard loud drum beats coming from the front hall. They hurried towards the source of sound.

In the end.....

Within the great hall, a dumbfounded Jun Qing stared at Ye Gu and the people he brought along.

“Please accept these betrothal gifts from Lord Jue, Young Prince.” Ye Gu held in his arms, a stack of gift lists, a group of Night Regime personnel behind him as they beat on the drums. The sight was so strange that it was unbelievable.

Who would have imagined that the usually cold members of the Night Regime would actually each wear a red ribbon across his chest and carried a musical instrument all the way to the hall.

That scene was so wonderful that Qiao Chu and the rest dared not believe they were actually witnessing it.

“What?” Jun Qing was also dumbstruck by such a display as he looked at the stack of lists which Ye Gu presented. He was still out of sorts.

Which act of the play is this.

“Where do we put the items?” Ye Gu asked in earnest.

“Items?” Jun Qing was still flabbergasted.

“The betrothal gifts.” Ye Gu withdrew a pair of white jade bracelets from within his sleeve.

Jun Qing still hasn’t recovered from his shock, and could only respond. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Put them here.”

“Alright.” Without further ado, Ye Gu placed the pair of white jade bracelets onto the table and took out the Hell Rodent out.

Afterwhich.....

Ding Ding Dang Dang.....

Ding Ding Dang Dang.....

The Hell Rodent opened its mouth and spewed out countless of rare and wondrous treasures, and in a short time filled up the floor of the hall.

“.....” Jun Qing let out a breath as he watched that blackhole of a Hell Rodent continue to spew forth treasures, both his legs weakened as he slid into a chair.

Without much effort, the treasured almost filled up the entire hall.

Jun Qing came back to his senses with much effort as he realised that he was almost buried neck-deep in treasures, as he quickly squeezed out some spiritual power. He raised his hand and shouted to Ye Gu, “Stop!!”

If the Hell Rodent was allowed to regurgitate further, someone would surely die!!

“Young Prince, this was instructed by Ye Jue and there are still more.....”

“What betrothal gifts! We don’t want any!”

“But, when one is getting married.....”

At the entrance of the hall, Qiao Chu and the others looked on at the interactions between and quietly retreated.
