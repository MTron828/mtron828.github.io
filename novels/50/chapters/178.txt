Chapter 179: “Might of the Qing Yun Clan (1)”

The former Emperor who was sharing the cell with Mo Xuan Fei looked on in silence at Bai Yun Xian in the opposite cell, his eyes narrowed in hatred. If Bai Yun Xian had not foolishly sent the Min Butterfly to the far distant Qing Yun Clan, they would have been saved earlier. If Bai Yun Xian had not used such an insidious poison on the people of the Imperial City, Jun Wu Xie and Mo Qian Yuan would not have any reason to bring their army into the Imperial Palace.

He would not have abdicated, and Mo Xuan Fei would not have turned into such a horrid looking beast.

It was all because of this woman!

Dumb and naive, and she made them lose everything.

Bai Yun Xian had been scared senseless and did not notice the stare of malevolence, she was praying fervently she does not turn hideous like Mo Xuan Fei.

At this moment, thoughts of love and devotion could not be further from her mind, and only staying alive and well was her foremost thought.

The former Emperor continued to stare coldly at Bai Yun Xian. Things have come to such a stage where he no longer harboured any hope for himself, but Jun Wu Xie’s intention to deceive Qing Yun Clan through Bai Yun Xian, would not be an easy task.

There was one other thing, he had dealt secretly with the Chief of the Qing Yun Clan, something that not even Bai Yun Xian was aware of. The people arriving in Qi, were coming not to just rescue Bai Yun Xian.....

He shall watch, watch Jun Wu Xie, watch Mo Qian Yuan, watch Bai Yun Xian, all die a thousand deaths!

The former Emperor gave out a low laugh, a laughter repressed and twisted. Bai Yun Xian looked up at the former Emperor at the in fear, and saw the scathing stare he gave her, eager to rip her apart.

Bai Yun Xian slithered back into the further corner in the cell. She did not feel any guilt, as she did not think herself responsible for the current situation. She saw herself a victim, victimised by Jun Wu Xie, a lunatic in the Kingdom of Qi who tormented her. A victim of the impotence of the former Emperor and Mo Xuan Fei, who dragged her into this mess. She was just looking after her own hide, what was wrong with that!?

Five days later, a convoy of beautiful carriages approached slowly from the outskirts of Imperial City, each carriage flying a banner with a cloud totem. The guards at the city gates hastened to let them pass upon seeing the banners, allowing them unobstructed passage right to the Imperial Palace.

The cloud totem, was the insignia of the Qing Yun Clan. Any convoy bearing the totem, went unobstructed everywhere.

In the midst of the convoy, the most beautiful carriage of all, was a girl clad in a light blue dress, a peerless beauty. She sat in the carriage, her bright eyes looking out the carriage window, watching the crowds of people gathered along the sides of the streets, people of the Kingdom of Qi, and she raised the corner of her red lips ever so slightly, gracing the people with a smile so graceful and gentle.

“This is the Kingdom of Qi?” The blue dressed girl turned her gaze back into the carriage and asked. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Yes, Eldest Miss.” Her companion in the carriage was a white haired old man. He might be advanced in age, but the penetrating and astute gaze he gave out told people otherwise.

“Yun Xian got herself trapped in this tiny place? That is.....” The girl sighed lightly, and shrugged it off, but a slight tinge of disdain flashed briefly in those eyes.

“That was what Miss Yun Xian’s Min Butterfly conveyed.” The old man replied respectfully.

“I did not see many guards within and without the city. Didn’t Yun Xian say the city was surrounded by the army called the Rui Lin Army?” The girl cupped her chin in her palm in disapproval. The Qing Yun Clan convoy had not seen anything untoward along its journey, and there were not many soldiers spotted, a contrast to the message the Min Butterfly had conveyed.
