Chapter 2609: A Helpless Sigh (4)

The Spirit Tree crouched on the ground until the last piece of Meng Qiu’s soul slid across its fingertips. It then slowly stood up. Instead of turning its back and looked at Qin Song and the others, it just raised its head and looked in the direction which Meng Qiu’s soul had gone to.

That was the kid which it had guided for thousands of years...

It had watched him grew, became matured, and managed the entire Soul World orderly and methodically. It had also watched him walked step by step into the path of self-extermination. It had witnessed the whole life of Meng Qiu, but was unable to save him.

The Spirit Tree was the origin of the souls. It knew nothing about the emotions and lusts owned by the humans as excess feelings would only reduce the pureness of its soul. It had always thought that this was right, but it didn’t realize that it was its affectionate but also ruthless attitude that had destroyed Meng Qiu.

“Qin Song.” The voice of the Spirit Tree was suddenly heard.

“Qin Song is here.”

“Was I wrong?”

Qin Song stunned. He wanted to say something, but it was as if his voice was stuck in his throat and it felt so painful.

Was the Spirit Tree wrong?

The Spirit Tree was equitable, lenient and benevolent. It treated all the soul entities in the Soul World equally. There was nothing wrong about it since this was a commendable behaviour that a high standing person could ever have. This was considered as a good thing in the Soul World.

However, on the contrary, there was too much of benevolence coming from the Spirit Tree. It was the same when it came to any spirit envoys, but for those spirit envoys who were very deep in emotive, this wasn’t a good thing but a kind of torture.

When the feelings came gushing out, the thing they seeked for wasn’t the equality that was given to everyone, but the unique treatment which was only accorded to them.

Qin Song suddenly thought of a saying which he had once heard the people joking about when he was in the Lower Realm.

[If the thing that you have given to me is the same as the thing that you have given to the others, then I don’t want it.]

It wasn’t the resemblance that one’s heart was looking for, but the difference.

Not knowing how should he answer the question, Qin Song was only remaining silent. Inside his mind, there was also such a thing which he could only hope for...

“Spirit Tree, it’s not your fault! It’s... It’s Master, he himself, has thought in the wrong way and chosen the wrong path. It has nothing to do with you,” said Long Jiu abruptly. Although he had already cut off his relationship with Meng Qiu, the moment he saw Meng Qiu’s regretful tears after he had gone, he suddenly felt like letting go of the past disputes and finally let out a call of Master.

As the quote said, a tutor for a day was a father for a lifetime. Even though he was wrong, he was now gone... VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Spirit Tree raised its eyes and looked at Long Jiu.

This was the first time Long Jiu made eye contact with the Spirit Tree in its human form. In the meantime, he was actually a little panic. With his face blushed, he quickly lowered his head.

The appearance of the incarnation of the Spirit Tree was truly stunning.

Meng Qiu was gone forever and the Spirit Tree had regained its freedom. This should be some good news, but the compulsion of Meng Qiu that had led him in doing all those crimes had caused everyone to involuntarily went into contemplations.

Jun Wu Yao suddenly recalled the things that had previously happened in his illusion. Inside the illusion, “he” had fallen into an endless compulsion due to her disappearance. At the end, not only he had destroyed everything, he had also destroyed himself. At the dazing moment, Jun Wu Yao found that it seemed like he was able to understand the moment of despair and helplessness of Meng Qiu.

Subconsciously, he landed his gaze onto Jun Wu Xie who was beside him.

If such things happened to him, would he react the same way as the way “he himself” reacted in the illusion and destroyed everything?

Jun Wu Xie had probably noticed Jun Wu Yao’s gaze, causing her to suddenly lift her head up and look into Jun Wu Yao’s eyes with her clear eyes. There was his face reflecting on her bright eyes. Jun Wu Yao saw a mark inside her eyes, telling him that he was her only one.
