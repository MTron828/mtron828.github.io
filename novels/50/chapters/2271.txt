Ye Gu was stunned momentarily before a glint of happiness appeared in his eyes. He immediately replied ecstatically, “Your subordinate obeys!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Xie waved her hand in dismissal.

“You may go.”

“Yes!” Ye Gu immediately retreated.

Outside the main hall, Ye Sha and Ye Mei did not leave and when they saw Ye Gu come out, they immediately went up to him.

“What did Young Miss say?” Ye Sha asked him in an eager tone.

Ye Gu glanced at them before he replied, “Young Miss has asked me to send people to follow the Rui Lin Army. Don’t let anything untoward happen to them.”

The moment he finished his words, the faces of Ye Sha and Ye Mei lit up with joy.

Sure enough, Jun Wu Xie was not able to ignore the Rui Lin Army. Essentially, there was no change in her nature. In a sense, this could also prove that her change had came about from the situation that made her so indifferent.

“Why are you two still standing there in a daze for? Hurry up and prepare! We have to destroy all the Palaces within three days, don’t pull me down! Bring out the majesty of our Night Regime and let those bastards of the Upper Realm see that with our Dark Regions around, it wouldn’t be so easy to control the Middle Realm!” Ye Gu harrumphed coldly as he rolled up his sleeves for battle.

Five years ago, Jun Wu Xie had followed them back to the Dark Regions and had taken over the entire Night Regime. They had spent five years to conceal their strength and bide their time, it was finally the moment for the Night Regime to unsheathe their swords!

“Yes!” Ye Sha and Ye Mei were extremely motivated and filled with vigour. They had been hiding for so many years and it was time for them to finally show their skills!

If they did not turn the Middle Realm upside down, then they would not be worthy to be part of the Night Regime!

Jun Wu Xie gave the Night Regime three days to destroy all the palaces for the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. However, in the end, they were extremely motivated and they completed the task in less than two days. Their speed was incredibly fast that made people’s eyes wide with their jaws open. They not only killed the tens of thousands of guards that were sent from the Upper Realm, there was not one death in the Night Regime. The most they had incurred was some superficial wounds.

This could be described as a huge victory!

This raid caused a great uproar in the Middle Realm and all the palaces had been razed to the ground, not a single tile was left intact. All the guards from the Upper Realm had been wiped out and those that had the privilege of witnessing the process were even more shocked.

The dark spirit that was unique to the Dark Regions quickly made people realize that the Dark Regions had came back, the Night Regime was back!

The moment they struck, the Dark Regions that disappeared for a thousand years had revealed their astounding strength to everyone. In each of their battles, they had never laid their hands on the innocent labourers, their only targets were the people from the Upper Realm and the Nine Temples. Other than their targets, they had not hurt anyone innocent.

The way they did things was a stark contrast to the cruel means of the Nine Temples. Under the oppressive rule of the Nine Temples, although no one dared to speak out despite their unhappiness, deep in their hearts, they were looking forward to the return of the Dark Regions. They were anticipating the return of the Middle Realm to its peaceful days.

The Rui Lin Army who had been secretly observing the movements of the Middle Realm had also been shocked by the torrential storm that the Night Regime had kicked up. Towards the battle prowess of the Night Regime, they were full of admiration. After they have received news that the Night Regime was highly likely to be related to Jun Wu Xie, they were elated and they even began to try and have a “chance encounter” with them. However, each time they met, the Night Regime would always leave a river of blood and blow the Palaces up before the members of the Rui Lin Army could even get in touch with them. It made the soldiers of the Rui Lin Army so frustrated that they felt as if their intestines had been tied up in knots, they could not wait to catch one person from the Night Regime.

Heroes of the Night Regime, wait a while more! We have prepared lots of good meat here, let’s chat for a bit!
