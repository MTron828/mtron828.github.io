“Master Uncle Tian Ze..... Just what really happened?” An ominous premonition swirled in Jun Wu Xie’s heart. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Tian Ze’s condition was so bad that she could not recognize him at all. Such severe wounds were definitely not left from a battle. Sword wounds, burn wounds, whip wounds..... covering his entire body had completely tormented that once good looking man at the prime of his life into looking like neither man nor ghost.....

Tian Ze struggled to suppress the sorrowful agony in his heart. He drew in a deep breath and raised his head up awash in sadness, his bloodshot eyes looking straight at Jun Wu Xie as he told Jun Wu Xie the truth that made her body turn cold.

After Jun Wu Xie’s batch of disciples left, the Cloudy Brook Academy was completely shut down and their teachers were all dismissed. For some reason, Tian Ze’s and Su Ya’s Master, who was also the Cloudy Brook Academy’s Headmaster had no choice but to take his two disciples to leave the Cloudy Brook Academy, to live under concealed identities, hiding from persecution by certain powers.

The powers the three of them possessed were not weak and though they were being persecuted, they still possessed the ability to defend themselves. But things took a turn for the worse when their whereabouts were discovered. The enemy came in with several thousand people, besieging them from all sides. Although they were powerful pugilists, faced with such great numbers, their two fists found it hard to fight against four hands.

During the great battle, Tian Ze and Su Ya were separated from their Master under the onslaught. Although they managed to break out from the encirclement after fighting with everything they had, their bodies were laden with injuries. They had escaped for just a few days when the enemy caught up with them, where Su Ya and Tian Ze were immediately thrown into jail. Those people still did not give up on their pursuit of their Master as their real target had always been the Cloudy Brook Academy’s Headmaster!

But how could the little old man who was able to teach two Silver Spirits possibly be someone those people could capture? They searched and investigated for a good half year’s time to absolutely no avail. Left with no other choice, they diverted their frustration and rage upon Tian Ze and Su Ya instead.

The wounds and injuries on Tian Ze were inflicted at that time. When they were captured, they were already injured. Locked up within the dungeon, they were not given any treatment. Half a year’s time caused his condition and Su Ya’s to worsen and deteriorate into an extremely terrible state, where they were placed under torture without any opportunity for them to resist.

Those people inflicted torment upon their bodies time and time again, attempting to force them into revealing their Master’s whereabouts. The two of them gritted their teeth tightly together, unwilling to say a single word.

Helpless as to what else they could do, those people then thought up the most vicious thing they could do. Throwing Tian Ze who was almost on his last breaths out, they told Tian Ze that after a month’s time, if their Master still remaining in hiding, then they would hold an open execution of his Senior Su Ya.

Tian Ze ran away in escape, but having lost contact with the little old man, how was he supposed to inform him of the news?

In a muddled daze, he had come to this city. He had already given in to despair and had not expected he would suddenly see Jun Wu Xie who had disappeared for a rather long while!

At that moment. Tian Ze felt as if his hands had grasped onto the final life saving straws of grass, and he went running with no regard for his own life straight towards Jun Wu Xie.....

As Tian Ze’s throat had been injured, throughout the process of his narration, his words were interrupted intermittently, constantly coughing as blood spewed out from his mouth. He did not care about that in the slightest, but just wanted to tell Jun Wu Xie everything as quickly as possible.

Wiping away the blood at the edge of his mouth, Tian Ze stared at Jun Wu Xie fervently.

“I can’t find Master. In another five days, they will kill Su Ya..... I am at my wits end. Jun Xie, you are Su Ya’s disciple. You must save her! They are inhuman! They will really kill Su Ya!”
