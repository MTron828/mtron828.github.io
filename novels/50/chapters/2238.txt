Ren Huang was extremely anxious, with Jun Wu Xie’s current strength, going against Luo Qingcheng was tantamount to seeking death. He wanted to kill off all those that stood in his way and save his grand disciple but the enemies that came at him were never ending. Ren Huang’s hands had been completely soaked in blood and the blue Spirit Ring was also stained with blood as drops of blood trickled down the Spirit Ring.

It was endless...

No matter how many he killed, they appeared like a river, streaming in endlessly.... completely separating the battlefield.

Jun Wu Xie facing off with Luo Qingcheng was definitely a nightmare and on the other side, Yan Bu Gui’s and Su Ya’s situation made Ren Huang’s heart more worried. If he didn’t see Su Ya huddled beneath Yan Bu Gui, Ren Huang would never recognize that that mangled back belonged to Yan Bu Gui.

Death could be seen everywhere. A thick blanket of death had covered the forest and Ren Huang’s eyes were bloodshot as he roared out in anguish, trying to breakthrough!

He wanted to save his own disciple, save his own grand disciple but due to the overwhelming numbers of enemies, he could not take half a step out and was stuck at the same place!

At this moment, Ren Huang felt despair like he had never felt before.

Ye Mei had also noticed Jun Wu Xie’s movements while he was caught in the battle and his heart almost rushed out of his throat.

Luo Qingcheng had easily escaped Jun Wu Xie’s sword and when she landed on the ground, Luo Qingcheng looked at Jun Wu Xie with a contemptuous gaze as she sneered. She was looking at Jun Wu Xie as if she was looking at an ant but the moment she noticed the Face of Selvan on Jun Wu Xie, her expression immediately changed!

“Why do you have the Face of Selvan!” Luo Qingcheng shrieked, her sudden raise in tone and volume in her voice contained shock and anger.

“What has it got to do with you?” Jun Wu Xie answered coldly, although she did not connect her previous attack, she did not give up and continued to attack.

Luo Qingcheng continued to dodge and avoided Jun Wu Xie’s attacks but her sharp gaze turned to look at Jun Wu Yao who was besieged on all sides!

The Face of Selvan was the most precious treasure that Jun Wu Yao had in the Upper Realm. It could transform into countless forms and it could continue to supplement the user’s strength. It was the only treasure that could be upgraded in the world. And this treasure was used by Jun Wu Yao on a few occasions and each time, it had dealt his opponents a devastating blow. Her Master had repeatedly tried to exchange for this treasure for many things, even half of the lands of the Upper Realm but Jun Wu Yao had adamantly refused.

Once, Luo Qingcheng had thought that the Face of Selvan was the most precious treasure Jun Wu Yao held dear to and even if she had been yearning for it, she knew that he would never give this powerful treasure away to anyone.

But now that she had discovered that the Face of Selvan was in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, all her previous confident conjectures had collapsed instantly!

Why!

Why would Jun Wu Yao give his most precious treasure to such a girl!

Jun Wu Xie was not worthy of the Face of Selvan, what good is there even if she has it? How could he bear to give it to her!?

The resentment in her heart seemed to have lit her heart on fire. She had never placed Jun Wu Xie in her eyes at all, even if Jun Wu Xie was that person’s target, she did not really bother. She never had the intention to bother with such a weakling, since that person also mentioned that he did not mind even if she brought back her dead body.

However, never would she have thought that her thoughts all these years would have been completely upturned! Who would have ever thought that the Face of Selvan that Jun Wu Yao refused to give up ended up in the hands of Jun Wu Xie!
