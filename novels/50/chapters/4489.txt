Chapter 3085 Decisiveness 2

He managed to erase the memory of Jun Wu Yao and it wasn’t until the new body of Jun Wu Yao was formed that the God of Destruction put his soul into the new body. Only then did Jun Wu Yao have a memory belonging to “Ye Jue”.

If possible, God of Destruction did not want to spend too much effort on this. He needed more than just Jun Wu Yao. He had no choice but to release Jun Wu Yao to lure Jun Wu Xie to appear.

However, in order to prevent accidents, God of Destruction deliberately saved Jun Wu Yao’s real body, in order to use it to threaten Jun Wu Yao at the critical moment. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

But...

Never would he have thought that Jun Wu Yao would take the chance to destroy himself without saying a word just as he was about to use his real body to threaten Jun Wu Yao.

That was simply seeking his own death!

Jun Wu Yao narrowed his eyes and looked indifferently at the distorted God of Destruction. He calmly said: “I will not be your bargaining chip for anyone. If his existence is a threat, then I will destroy him without hesitation. ”

Jun Wu Yao looked at his real body indifferently as if he was looking at a dead body.

“Don’t you want to live? If you destroy your real body, you will die!” The God of Destruction roared out.

Jun Wu Yao’s lips curled up casually and ignored the clamor from God of Destruction. He turned his head and looked at the worried Jun Wu Xie. He stretched out his hand and rubbed Jun Wu Xie’s little head.

“I said that as long as I am here, no one will hurt you. I will not even allow myself to hurt you.”

Jun Wu Xie froze in place. In a flash, she understood Jun Wu Yao’s intention.

Even if Jun Wu Xie disregarded Jun Wu Yao’s safety and attacked the God of Destruction with all her strength, Jun Wu Yao would not let this happen. He did not want to give the God of Destruction such an opportunity, he wanted to end this all with his own hands and protect Jun Wu Xie, even if it meant by sacrificing himself!

Jun Wu Xie wanted to say something, but Jun Wu Yao shook his head.

“You have walked all the way till now. I have seen it in my eyes, how can I be your burden?”

For many years, Jun Wu Yao couldn’t remember himself. He watched the indifferent girl grow bit by bit, silently carrying the fate of the Three Realms on her shoulders. Such a thin and weak body had to shoulder all this.

How could he endure and let her efforts go to waste?

“God of Destruction, you want to threaten me with my real body, then you are really wrong. Even if you don’t destroy it, I will destroy it myself!” Jun Wu Yao raised his head as the last sliver of gentleness in his eyes had faded. He would not give God of Destruction any chance.

“I don’t believe that you’ll dare to do it!” The God of Destruction glared at Jun Wu Yao as he gnashed his teeth. He didn’t believe that there would still be people in the world who would be stupid enough to sacrifice themselves. Especially someone powerful like Jun Wu Yao!

Jun Wu Yao sneered.

An ominous feeling rose within Jun Wu Xie’s heart suddenly as she subconsciously reached out and wanted to hold Jun Wu Yao, but her outstretched hand fell onto empty space instead.

Before anyone could react, Jun Wu Yao’s figure had already turned into a shadow and shot towards his real body that was the embodiment of his own existence.

There was a loud bang and inside the huge hall, the roaring explosion pierced everyone’s eardrum, and two identical figures overlapped at this moment... At this critical juncture, there was an explosion...
