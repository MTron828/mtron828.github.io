The other person of the Night Regime immediately took out a jade plaque which was used for communications. He quickly carved a sentence on the special jade plaque.

This jade plaque could only be found in the Dark Region. There was no word count limit but it can only be used once. Though, it was able to send a message to afar in just a blink of an eye!

The main hall of the Lin Palace was filled up with the major forces of the Lower Realm. Now, they were looking seriously at Jun Wu Xie who was seated beside Jun Xian. Nobody would open their mouths at this moment. They were all waiting for the latest news coming from the front line.

Soon, a faint halo appeared on the jade plaque that Jun Wu Xie placed on the table. The halo wasn’t that obvious but it still made the entire bodies of all the people in the main hall to shudder during that moment!

Jun Wu Xie picked up the jade plaque and quickly went through the content written on the plaque. Her pair of clear eyes slightly narrowed with a cold glint flashing across her eyes.

“They are coming.”

Everybody held their breaths at the moment. After preparing for such a long time, the time to battle had finally come!

“Ye Sha,” Jun Wu Xie called out suddenly.

Ye Sha who was standing aside immediately walked forward and kneeled on one of his knees in front of her.

“Your subordinate is here at your service, Young Miss.”

You’re reading on .com Thanks!

“Get them ready. They can start now.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed a little. There was a cold gleam emerging from the bottom of her eyes.

Let the idiots from the Upper Realm taste their warm hospitality and their “presents”!

“Yes!” The moment the words left his mouth, the figure of Ye Sha suddenly disappeared from the main hall.

The battle was going to begin but everyone was still confused about the things that Jun Wu Xie actually wanted to do. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Who were they?

What did she mean by saying that ‘they can start now’?

“Little Xie... What are you planning to do? Stop hiding it from us by now. The cities at the border were emptied a long time ago and you ordered Ye Sha them to do something just now. Is it that you have arranged something else in those cities? Just say it.” Jun Qing couldn’t hold himself back anymore. During this half a month, the most they knew was just Jun Wu Xie having secret meetings with Ye Sha and the rest. Other than that, they knew nothing.

Jun Qing had been leading the troops for years. Although he didn’t know what Jun Wu Xie was actually planning to do, he could tell that Jun Wu Xie had already set up an ambush in the cities!

But...

The main troops of the Night Regime was staying here. The amount of people who were sent to perform reconnaissance weren’t even enough for them to carry out any effective attack and fight, but... Except for the Night Regime, was there still any power hidden by Jun Wu Xie?

Jun Wu Xie suddenly raised her head and looked at Jun Qing who was holding on a worried expression on his face. She then looked at the people sitting in the main hall who were all questioning her with their eyes. After that, she said. “Uncle, do you still remember that who Wu Yao is?”

Jun Qing stunned a little. After Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were being in a relationship, Jun Wu Yao had removed the misleading memory from the Jun Family. After listening from Qiao Chu and the others, Jun Qing and the others had earlier knew that Jun Wu Yao was the Dark Emperor of the Middle Realm!

“Yeah. The Dark Emperor of the Middle Realm.” Jun Qing replied honestly.

Jun Wu Xie slightly nodded her head and suddenly looked in the direction of Qiao Chu and the rest. “Do you guys still remember the things we went through in Heaven’s End Cliff?”

Qiao Chu and the others were confused, not understanding the reason of Jun Wu Xie mentioning Heaven’s End Cliff at this moment.

“Yeah, how could we not remember? We nearly died there when we went for the first time. If it wasn’t for Lord Meh Meh who had taken the attack for you...” While speaking half through, Qiao Chu suddenly came to a halt. Something came into his mind, causing him to widen his eyes and stared at Jun Wu Xie in disbelief.
