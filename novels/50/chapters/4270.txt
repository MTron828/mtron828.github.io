As soon as the banquet started, young women of the Sacred Maiden Tribe vied for Jun Wu Xie’s attention. Prior to the banquet, they were informed of Jun Wu Xie’s capabilities, and compared to the first banquet where Jun Wu Xie was still unknown to them, this time round, the women made extra effort to dress up to impress her. Each of the women couldn’t wait to be the winner.

Han Shu was dressed more finely than the last time, but she was a little surprised when she found that Yan Xi was also at the banquet.

Compared to the other women’s glamorous appearances, Yan Xi was dressed very casually. In fact, she was dragged into this by Duan Qi to make up the numbers.

Duan Qi had long discovered Yan Xi’s feelings for Jun Gu. Now that Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei were married but they still had yet to leave the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Duan Qi did not want to make any mistakes during this critical period, so in order to prevent Yan Xi from doing anything that would be detrimental to the Sacred Maiden Tribe because of her resentment, Duan Qi requested her presence at the banquet so that she could keep an eye on Yan Xi.

When Jun Wu Xie walked into the banquet hall, the women’s eyes were all directed at her in an instant. One by one, they could not wait to show off their best points to Jun Wu Xie. Throughout the hall, every woman was looking at Jun Wu Xie, trying to catch her attention, and if Jun Wu Xie was to glance in their direction, they would wink and act coquettish.

However...

Since Jun Wu Xie entered the hall, she did not even glance sideways and walked directly to her designated seat and sat down. Elder Duan Qi and Elder Yun sat on either side of Jun Wu Xie, and they were both secretly observing Jun Wu Xie’s reaction.

With the marriage of Han Zi Fei, the Sacred Maiden Tribe had completely lost their pureblooded Sacred Maiden. They could only hope that one of the women from the tribe would catch the eye of Jun Wu Xie tonight.

“City Lord Yan, have you been in contact with Lord Jun Gu these few days?” Elder Yun stared at Jun Wu Xie’s indifferent expression as she asked with a smile to ease the atmosphere.

“No.” Jun Wu Xie said.

“Oh? That’s alright. Lord Jun Gu will be staying in the Sacred Maiden Tribe for a while more. If there is enough time, City Lord Yan can chat with Lord Jun Gu over the next few days. Now that the marriage ceremony has been completed, Lord Jun Gu should be at ease. ” Elder Yun smiled.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Elder Yun slightly but did not respond.

The indifference of Jun Wu Xie caused Elder Yun and Duan Qi to be a little confused. This time, they had already informed Jun Wu Xie about the banquet early on. And compared with before, Jun Wu Xie showed a rare agreement to the invitation. They had thought that this matter was almost settled. However, now it seemed.... Why was Jun Wu Xie so indifferent?

The two were anxious, since Jun Wu Xie had been staying in the Sacred Maiden Tribe for quite some time now. What’s more, Jun Wu Xie was never interested in a marriage alliance with the Sacred Maiden Tribe to begin with. The reason why she was even there was due to Jun Gu, and Jun Gu would be leaving in a few days. Some time had also passed since Jun Wu Xie rose to fame in the Upper Realm, and it won’t be too long before Jun Wu Xie was summoned to meet with His Lord. By then, even if they had all the courage in the world, they still wouldn’t dare to fight His Lord for Jun Wu Xie. .

So much so that they were so anxious and wanted to finalise their plan tonight!

“It’s been some time since City Lord Yan came to our Sacred Maiden Tribe, but that’s still not enough time to learn about our tribe’s customs and traditions. Today coincides with great joy, why not let my people help you with it.” Immediately after Duan Qi said this, she cast a glance at the women sitting around.
