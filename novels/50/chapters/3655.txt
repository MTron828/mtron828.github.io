Chapter 2250: Battle to the End (17)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Luo Qingcheng left with a team of people and the blood stained green hills became a site of devastation.

Ren Huang was gasping for his breath with his mouth wide open, this was the fiercest battle he had ever encountered in his life. Although he watched those black robed men leave, his heart had not relaxed one bit at all. Instead, he became even more vigilant as his eyes fell on the setting sun. That figure from the back was so little, all alone in the pool of blood, her back tall and straight but it could not help but make people feel worried.

“Young Miss...” Ye Mei rushed to Jun Wu Xie’s side. The look in his eyes was complicated, it looked as if he wanted to say something but when he looked up and saw her face, all the words that were at the tip of his tongue were instantly swallowed back.

On that pale white face, covered with fresh blood, an enchanting red against her fair skin was like blood red flowers blossoming. Crystal clear tears trickled down and rolled off her cheeks, washing away the blood, quietly....

Ye Mei was stunned and froze on the spot.

From the first time he had met her till now, they had experienced countless battles of various magnitude and size. No matter what kind of danger they faced, he had never ever seen her tears. He had always thought that Young Miss would never ever cry.

He could not associate the word ‘tears’ with her.

But in the end, Ye Mei was wrong.

Without sobbing, without wailing, she just stood in the bellowing wind in lone silence. Without any expression on her face, she faced the cool breeze of dusk, before the tears had landed, they had been blown dry by the wind.

It was sombre silence yet the atmosphere was heartbreaking.

For a moment there, Ye Mei was at a loss and did not know what to do. He could only stand in place in a daze.

The threat of Jun Wu Yao had bought everyone some time to catch their breaths. Those black robed men retreated to one side as they watched departure of Luo Qingcheng’s party. In the desolate wilderness, there was not a trace of relaxation. Blood had seeped deep into the ground, corpses were littered everywhere and that figure who had fallen was a sister that they were most familiar with. In the middle of the deep mountain, in the dark cave, they had relied on each other and accompanied each other for thousands of years.

However, now that things had come to this, they had been separated through life and death, breaking their fate. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Senior Sister...” A loud cry of anguish resounded as a young lady who was riddled with injuries knelt in a pool of blood, her hand quivered as she hugged the lady who had lost her breath who lay lifeless on the ground. Her whole body was trembling.

“Ahhhh!”

The sorrowful cry echoed in the quiet forest and countless birds had been scared as they flew away.

That voice was filled with so much sorrow and anguish.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s entire body was crimson red, no longer able to distinguish if it was the colour of his armour or if it was fresh blood. His hair was a complete mess as he swept his gaze over the battlefield, the moment he saw the figure of Granny Yue, he trembled and could not even stand properly.

Granny Yue who had been by his side for a thousand years had fallen peacefully on the ground. Under her body, she was protecting another disciple who had already lost her breath. A sharp sword ran through her back, skewering the disciple beneath her along. Fresh blood stained the ground.

“Yue...” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s voice trembled. The Spirit Jade Palace had been in seclusion for a thousand years, not many of the disciples that followed him initially were left. It was Granny Yue who had been by his side even before the Spirit Jade Palace had lost their glory, he had always thought that he would let her retire peacefully, never had he imagined that... He would actually implicate her.
