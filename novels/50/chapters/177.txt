Chapter 178: “Handling Matters (4)”

“Pry open her mouth.” Jun Wu Xie commanded coldly.

Bai Yun Xian who had already been scared out of her wits, went berserk at those words. She kicked and clawed against the guards’ firm grip, screaming at the top of her lungs, tears running freely down her face, a wretched sight to behold.

“No..... no..... NO..... I don’t want to die! Please..... Please..... Please let me go, I..... I will never go against you again.....” Bai Yun Xian sobbed as she pleaded, she understands..... She now knows the effects of the poison Mo Xuan Fei consumed..... She will never dare go against Jun Wu Xie again.....

To have your whole body constantly rotting, like a walking corpse..... That was just too terrifying!!

Even as a disciple of the esteemed Qing Yun Clan, she had never come across poison that had such terrifying effects.

Bai Yun Xian screamed herself hoarse, but was unable to escape her fate. The Rui Lin Army guards forced the poison down her throat. Bai Yun Xian was struck dumb as they pill went down her throat, she trembled violently, unable to move a muscle. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“This poison will not kill you. It will just make flesh rot bit by bit. Do not worry though, you won’t die from it. When the flesh rots to the bone, flesh will regenerate back onto it. Rest assured, it won’t kill you.” Jun Wu Xie looked coldly at Bai Yun Xian, her every word driving Bai Yun Xian to wail unabashed.

Staying alive like this..... Death would have been sweet.....

Does this mean, she would have to live out the rest of her life a hideous monster?

Her desperation to live lent her the strength to escape the hold of the guards, and she fell at the feet of Jun Wu Xie. She wailed as she pleaded: “I beg you to spare me, I beg you! Please! Spare me and I’ll do anything you want.... Anything! My..... my senior fellow disciple will arrive at the Qi Kingdom soon. Don’t kill me, I promise not to speak a word of this.....”

Bai Yun Xian was totally flustered, the Min Butterfly had come back with the news that people from Qing Yun Clan will arrive at the Kingdom of Qi within five days. She had held onto that as her last hope for rescue, but Jun Wu Xie’s poison had extinguished even that last glimmer of light and she only saw a future bleak and desolate.

If that was her life, living as a horrendous ghastly monster, she would rather not live!

Jun Wu Xie watched Bai Yun Xian as she pleaded and gestured to the Rui Lin Army guards. The two soldiers lifted Bai Yun Xian to stand before Jun Wu Xie.

“This medicine here can curb the poison within you. You will have to maintain the dosage or the rotting poison will start to take over, and nothing can save you then.” Jun Wu Xie produced a small pill and put it before Bai Yun Xian. Bai Yun Xian opened her mouth wide anxious to take the medicine immediately.

After Bai Yun Xian swallowed the medicine, a cold chill flashed briefly in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

“Remember what you promised me today. If you go back on your words, I will make sure you suffer a fate worse than Mo Xuan Fei.” Jun Wu Xie warned her frostily.

Bai Yun Xian nodded her head vigorously. Having suffered under her vicious hand, Bai Yun Xian had lost all will and guts to confront Jun Wu Xie in any way.

Jun Wu Xie had the guards return Bai Yun Xian and Mo Xuan Fei returned to their cells, and commanded Bai Yun Xian to surrender all information she had of the people of Qing Yun Clan who were arriving in the Imperial City.

Bai Yun Xian knelt on the stone floor within the cell, a brush in her hand and paper parchment spread on the ground. Her ears were filled by moans from Mo Xuan Fei, and when she raised her head, her eyes was met with the horrendous sight of Mo Xuan Fei, whose flesh had rotted to the bone. The unforgettable sight, made her shudder in horror every time she thought about it.
