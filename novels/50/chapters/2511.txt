Zi Fei let out a slight laugh but she didn’t say anything. She could have handled these murderers on her own, but she was very happy that Jun Wu Xie had helped without her asking.

Jun Wu Yao had a sense of Zi Fei’s strength; Zi Fei was the purest Sacred Maiden of the Sacred Maiden Sect and she used the Soul World’s cultivation technique to cultivate, hence her strength could not be compared to that of a regular person. He had no objection to Jun Wu Xie’s decision at that time. He saw that Jun Wu Xie had a good impression of Zi Fei, and if she wanted to do it, why should he object?

At this moment, Qiao Chu, who was full of vigor, was hauling a man who was drenched in blood, and the person kept wailing in anguish as he was being dragged by Qiao Chu, leaving a deep trail on the sand.

“What should we do with this guy?” Qiao Chu dragged the man in front of Jun Wu Xie and Zi Fei, as he kicked the guy on the ground.

“I noticed that the person’s clothes are of good quality, his skin is so smooth, so I reckon he must be a leader of sorts that’s why I detained him. Do you want to ask him anything?” Qiao Chu got smarter, since they have not been to Upper Realm before, and Jun Wu Yao had left that place so many years ago, keeping someone alive for interrogation, perhaps they could find out some information.

Zi Fei took a glance at the man, and it was then that she realised the battered and exhausted man was the person who tried to escape the fastest, Yan Hai. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Qiao Chu’s judgement was considered keen this time.

“This person is the young master of the Sea Spirit City. If you have anything to ask, you should.” Zi Fei said.

Jun Wu Xie quirked her brows, and looked at a shivering Yan Hai as he knelt on the sand.

“Don’t.... Don’t kill me.... I....I didn’t do anything.... Don’t kill me.....” Yan Hai knelt on the sand and kept kowtowing and pleading for mercy. That cowardly behavior is unbefitting of his title as a “Young Master”.

Yan Hai’s heart was crying empty tears. He didn’t know what sins he committed, he only wanted to stay on the island for a while. How did he provoke so many dreadful people. He obviously didn’t do anything wrong. How come he was going to be slaughtered?

“Lift your head.” Jun Wu Xie coldly ordered.

Yan Hai lifted his head up falteringly, and suddenly noticing that standing in front of him was a woman of extreme beauty.

“What’s your name?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“Yan...Yan Hai....”

“What sort of place is Sea Spirit City?” she asked again.

Yan Hai was a little surprised. What sort of place is Sea Spirit City? Why is she asking that?

Without waiting for Yan Hai to comprehend, Qiao Chu kicked him again.

“Dawdling like a woman! She asked you a question, so you better quickly answer. Stop acting dumb, if not I’m going to kill you.” Qiao Chu deliberately acted like a fiend.

Yan Hai didn’t dare to hesitate any longer and spat out all the information.

Sea Spirit City was one of the 72 cities of the Upper Realm, it didn’t hold a high status. In terms of strength, it was not the strongest, but the location of the Sea Spirit City was very close to the coast, and they were good at hunting Sea Spirit Beasts, hence it still held a certain position in the Upper Realm.

“What is your relation to Sea Spirit City?”

“I....I am the young master of the Sea Spirit City, the current City Lord is my father...” Yan Hai answered honestly.

Jun Wu Xie asked them what was the purpose of this trip to the sea, only to find out that this was a fleet of Sea Spirit City ships that went on a hunt for Sea Spirit Beasts every month. In addition to Yan Hai’s fleet, Sea Spirit City had also sent more than a dozen fleets, which departed during the same period but to different sea areas.
