Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie did not stay in Long Xuan City. Instead, she assigned a part of the Ghost Army to remain in Long Xuan City. However, because of her ruthless means, even if she was not in Long Xuan City, no one would dare to find trouble with the Ghost Army. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After returning to Sea Spirit City, Jun Wu Xie began to plan for the next step. The news of Long Xuan City’s defeat had already spread like wildfire, arousing suspicion in many cities. As Jun Wu Xie had taken over Long Xuan City, the news about Sea Spirit City spread throughout the 72 cities in the shortest span of time.

The City Lords who had originally wanted to make a trip over to Sea Spirit City to demand for an explanation for the severed Sea Spirit Beasts supply had also quietened down. At the same time, more and more spies were sent to the Sea Spirit City. Over the next few days, the number of people entering Sea Spirit City began to increase, all with different agendas on their mind.

As for these spies from other cities, Jun Wu Xie did not raise the thought of getting rid of them at all.

She simply managed Sea Spirit City leisurely and left it to the members of the Night Regime to monitor those spies who entered. The Night Regime members started spreading the news of the elixir, letting various channels discuss the matter and made the news sound more credible and let those spies “accidentally discover” it.

Everything on Jun Wu Xie’s side went very smoothly and very soon, Zheng Weilong also received news from Diminishing Moon City. After getting the news, she immediately looked for Jun Wu Xie and handed Zheng Ke’s letter directly to her.

Jun Wu Xie swept through the contents of the letter in a glance before she slightly raised her eyebrows and looked at Zheng Weilong who was sitting opposite her.

In Zheng Ke’s letter, he did not ask Zheng Weilong anything about her own situation. The contents were all enquiries about Long Xuan City and Sea Spirit City. As for Long Xuan City’s destruction, the different opinions of the 72 cities were all in accordance to the news Jun Wu Xie released. The City Lords of the 72 cities have already started wrecking their brains to find out more.

In Zheng Ke’s letter, he mentioned that he hoped Zheng Weilong could go to Sea Spirit City and contact Jun Wu Xie as well as to find a way to get her hands on the elixir formula in Sea Spirit City.

“Ye Sha.” Jun Wu Xie threw the letter written by Zheng Ye into a brazier and burned it.

Ye Sha stepped forward.

“Elixir.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Ye Sha placed the elixir that Jun Wu Xie had prepared earlier on right in front of Zheng Weilong.

Even the usually calm Zheng Weilong could not help but her eyes sparkled upon seeing the elixir. She reached for the elixir and examined it carefully before looking up at Jun Wu Xie.

“This is the elixir that changed the entire Sea Spirit city?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

“You want me to give it to Zheng Ye?” Zheng Weilong frowned slightly.

“Yes.”

“Are you really willing? This elixir is related to the strength of your Sea Spirit City. I understand that you want Zheng Ye to believe the truth of this matter, but ... Zheng Ye has a lot of doctors who have good medical skills. When it comes to this elixir, it is hard to guarantee that they will not find out the ingredients in this elixir, aren’t you afraid of taking this risk? “Zheng Weilong looked at Jun Wu Xie helplessly.

Ever since Long Xuan City’s incident, it had alerted all 72 cities and they began to pay close attention to Sea Spirit City. This attention had exceeded their interest over the issue of the supply of Sea Spirit Beasts. In Zheng Weilong’s heart, the strength of Sea Spirit City was solely based on this elixir. Once it had been obtained by other cities and after they have deciphered the formula, all the advantages of Sea Spirit City would disappear in an instant.
