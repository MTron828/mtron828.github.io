“That is very clever.” Jun Wu Yao sneered. What Jun Wu Xie thought of, naturally he too thought of it.

If not for their trip to the Soul World, they would have really missed out on this great piece of news!

Once the plan of the Upper Realm was successful, it would be very difficult for them to try and stop it!

Jun Wu Xie was silent for a moment. Suddenly, she took a step toward the Spirit Tree. She looked at the tall Spirit Tree and said: “Spirit Tree, thank you for your help, I still have one more thing to ask for your help with. You know everything about this world, then... Can you tell me, my father, my master and my grandmaster, are their souls in the Soul World?”

Jun Wu Xie’s voice echoed in the empty surrounding.

After a long time, a vine of the Spirit Tree slowly lifted up and gently rested on Jun Wu Xie’s eyebrow. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The gentle voice once again sounded in the mind of Jun Wu Xie.

“Your master and grandmaster have entered the reincarnation, they will be born again, but they will have no memory of their past. If you want to find them, after they are reborn, I can tell you where their souls are. They have outstanding souls, and they will be reborn into the Soul World. Whether they stay or leave, depends on them.”

Jun Wu Xie’s heart was overcome with joy as the Spirit Tree’s words were very euphemistic. Jun Wu Xie knew that Great Master Ren Huang and Yan Bui Gui were dead, but their souls could be reincarnated, it was unlike that of Meng Qiu’s soul. There was a chance to be born again, although they won’t remember their past.

Perhaps, this could be considered a good outcome.

“May I bother you, Tree Spirit, again to let me know when they are reborn.”

Jun Wu Xie sighed, but suddenly noticed that the Spirit Tree only answered with the news of Great Master Ren Huang and Yan Bu Gui, but only did not reply regarding her father.

“Spirit Tree, then my father... Is his soul in the Soul World?”

When Jun Wu Xie asked this question, her heartbeat accelerated unconsciously. The soul of Jun Gu had always been the most concerning issue in Lin Palace. If she couldn’t find it again, she did not know how to face Grandpa and Uncle.

This time, the Spirit Tree fall into a long silence.

After a long time, the voice of the Spirit Tree sounded again.

“Here.”

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes shone bright!

An indescribable joy spread wildly in her chest.

Even though she never had “contact” with Jun Gu, but the word ‘father’ had some sort of magical power that made Jun Wu Xie could not help but want to find him.

“Where is he?” Jun Wu Xie’s voice held a hint of urgency.

Found him, finally found him!

“Soul Ascending Altar.” After the Spirit Tree conveyed these three words, the vines were pulled back. Evidently there was nothing more to be said.

However, these answers had already made Jun Wu Xie feel unusually satisfied.

Her father, really was in the Soul World!

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were slightly bright, and her subtle changes allowed Jun Wu Yao to smile involuntarily.

“Little Xie, you have good news?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded. “Master and grandmaster can be reborn, my father... he is in the Soul World!”

Jun Wu Yao smiled more comfortably, and for now, their purpose in the Soul World had been achieved.

“Where is he?” Jun Wu Yao asked.

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath and said, “Soul Ascending Altar.”

There was a slight change on Jun Wu Yao’s face!
