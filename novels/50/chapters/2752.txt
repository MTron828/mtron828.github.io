“Like this, he can not only show Sea Spirit City his sincerity, but it can also mislead us and let us think that Sea Spirit City is already in alliance with them and force Sea Spirit City into a hostile position against us. He must have expected us to assume that Sea Spirit City is on his side and that we will not go to Sea Spirit City. That is why he purposely leaked the news. If we really fulfil his expectations, then I am afraid... ” The City Lord of Hidden Demon City did not finish what he wanted to say, after all, no matter what hidden agendas Bai Zhu may be hiding, one thing was very clear.

That was the value of Sea Spirit City!

At the beginning, it was a miscalculation to send their troops to Sea Spirit City. They also underestimated the strength of Sea Spirit City as they wanted to forcibly take over that city, but they were beaten by Jun Wu Xie instead.

Bai Zhu was very clever; he bided his time. After finding out the strength of Sea Spirit City, he approached them with caution and courtesy. Even after getting rebuffed, he still maintained his calm.

“What you’re saying is ... Sea Spirit City is really important?” Nangong Yan had a great bias against Sea Spirit City, but in the face of absolute vested interests, there were no eternal enemies.

“When has that brat Bai Zhu made any loss in his dealings? Since he is being so patient with Sea Spirit City, it is enough to prove that Sea Spirit City has certain value. I think we should change our methods and try to get in touch with Sea Spirit City.” said the City Lord of Hidden Hidden Demon City.

“But with the previous incident... ” The City Lord of Epic Vesper City had some hesitation as he looked at the City Lord of Hidden Demon City.

For them to attend the Banquet of Heroes, did it not mean that they were bowing to Sea Spirit City?

The corpses of their own soldiers had been piled up outside Sea Spirit City for so many days, they had lost face and now they had to attend the Banquet of Heroes? Wasn’t this a continued humiliation and won’t it make people think that they were afraid of Sea Spirit City?

“Don’t worry about this matter. There are no eternal friends and no eternal enemies in this world. Not to mention, Master Nangong was the one who led the soldiers to Sea Spirit City. We have nothing to do with it.” The City Lord of Hidden Demon City sneered.

At this moment, everyone immediately understood the meaning of the City Lord of Hidden Demon City!

Wasn’t he putting all the blame on Nangong Lie?

“Exactly.” Amazingly, Nangong Yan agreed.

Nangong Lie and the Five City Coalition army entered the Sea Spirit City, and till now there was no news. Everything pointed to a disaster. Hence, it would be easy to push all the blame to him. This way, they could resolve any conflict between the five cities and Jun Wu Xie.

“Master Nangong is one of the top ten exponents, thus, whatever he requests of his, we cannot disobey. But, the attack on Sea Spirit City is not our intention at all.” Nangong Yan took a deep breath and uttered those cold words, it was as if he had no relationship with Nangong Lie.

“Very good, even if we can’t win over Sea Spirit City, at least we will not let White Night City succeed. Otherwise, it will be very bad for us.”

Nangong Yan’s words immediately won the approval of other City Lords.

Compared with a dead Nangong Lie, Sea Spirit City was more important, and they could never let White Night City’s scheme succeed, otherwise in the future, in the battle of power, it would put them in a very passive situation. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

With that decision, the City Lords of the five cities left to each prepare for the Banquet of Heroes. No matter how much they were disgusted with and despised Jun Wu Xie and Sea Spirit City, as long as it was to move against White Night City, they would never back down.

Soon, the news of Blazing Flame City and the other four cities traveling to Sea Spirit City spread and everyone in 72 cities was dumbfounded.
