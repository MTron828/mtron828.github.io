Chapter 41: ‚ÄúGhost City (2)‚Äù

Unfortunately, none of the books in the Resource Hall were suitable for her.

In the world of cultivation, the techniques and practices were all based on the type of contractual spirit one has.

Those with weapons and those beast type forms each have a totally different technique.

However, Jun Wu Xie‚Äôs contractual spirit did not even fall into these two conventional categories! So no matter how much she read, how much she scoured through each book, she could not find a single cultivation technique suitable for her.

If she wasn‚Äôt able to find any technique, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to cultivate her spirit energy.

Where was she to find a plant cultivation technique? This problem became a headache for her.

She bore no more hope of finding it within Lin Palace. An idea flashed through her mind.

In the memories of this body, there was a secret place hidden deep within this Imperial City.

It was an underground market which entrance was tucked in a secluded corner of the city. Many rare items which could not be found in the city could be found here, it also had many unconventional things for sale.

Looking in the mirror was now a young scholarly looking man. She had slightly tweaked and changed her facial features to a more masculine look and changed into a white robe.

Before going to the underground market, she needed to prepare the ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô there where ordinary silver was deemed worthless. These days she had been in the pharmacy making various elixirs and potions to nourish and aid Jun Xian and Jun Qing‚Äôs recovery. She picked a few bottles, stuffed it into her robe and snuck out of the back door in the still of the night.

The Imperial City was extremely quiet at night and although it was her first time stepping out of Lin Palace, she followed her body‚Äôs memories to the entrance of the underground market.

She stopped in front of inconspicuous restaurant. It was a humble looking place, no different from any other buildings lining the streets, sitting at the counter was a waiter who was lazily resting his head on the counter top, when he saw her, he did not say hello and continued lazing.Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
