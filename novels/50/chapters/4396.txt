Chapter 2992 Dead or alive 1

In the darkness, there was no sound in the entire house. Only the moonlight quietly spilled to the ground. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The figures of Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie flashed quickly in the courtyard. The two probed every inch of the house with their perception and they finally found the breath of Su Ruiying.

It was said that Su Ruiying had to go back to rest first, but she didn’t take a rest. She had changed clothes and was walking down the long corridor. The ghoul masked man behind her carried a lantern and walked into a room.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao glanced at each other. They both wanted to see where Su Ruiying was up to. Immediately, they found a corner outside the window to stand, catching the gap in the window and looking into the room.

Rows of cabinets stood on the four walls of the room. Upon a closer look, there were all puppets in those cabinets, lined up in rows!

Under the candlelight, there was a long table. There were many tools scattered on the table, and a brand-new, treated leather was spread on the long table. From the color, it should be human skin.

“Lady Ying, are you not taking a rest tonight?” The ghoul masked man respectfully stood aside, slightly worried.

Su Ruiying waved her hand impatiently under the table at the ghoul masked man.

“Ah Fu, do not be so naggy anymore. There are a lot of things that His Lord has told me in these few days. I haven’t been quiet for a long time to do my own thing. Do you want to control me?” Su Ruiying glanced at the ghoul masked man from the corner of her eyes.

The ghoul masked man immediately lowered his head, “I dare not. I am only worried. If His Lord knows that Lady Ying uses those things, will it ...”

“What I use is nothing but how can His Lord know? Besides, I didn’t choose the best ones, but I chose some good-looking ones. You don’t have to say more. After finishing, if you still linger on, then go back to the cabinet and stay there. “Su Ruiying was obviously impatient and her tone turned bad.

The ghoul masked man was shocked. He didn’t dare to say a word, but retreated silently into the darkness, as if he was not in this room.

Su Ruiying turned her face and looked at the long table. The shape of the wooden block had been carved. A trace of fanaticism flashed in her weird eyes.

She picked up the wooden egg-shaped block and held a carving knife in one hand. She wanted to cut a few times, but she was hesitant. Her brows were light, and suddenly she put the carving knife down. She removed the black cloth on the long table.

The moment the black cloth fell, a large palm sized crystal ball was lying quietly on the long table. The crystal ball did not look expensive, but it reflected the candlelight.

Su Ruiying’s eyes fell on the crystal ball. Her furrowed brows slowly relaxed.

Inside the crystal ball, a terrifying face appeared before Su Ruiying!

A little nearly translucent person was trapped in the crystal ball and was slapping the crystal ball frantically but there was no effect at all. Su Ruiying’s gaze was fixated on the person and bit by bit, she started carving as a grin emerged on her face.

Jun Wu Xie witnessed everything from outside the window. She was shocked to find that the face reflected in the crystal ball turned out to be Bai Zhu’s face! !
