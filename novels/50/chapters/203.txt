Chapter 204: “Might (1)”

“And this is?” Mo Qian Yuan shrank back a little from Jun Wu Yao who was standing behind Jun Wu Xie. He sensed overwhelming danger from the man. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Jun Wu Yao, my….. big brother.” It was Jun Wu Xie’s first time to introduce Jun Wu Yao to someone.

Big brother? Mo Qian Yuan was filled with suspicion. He did not remember that the Jun Family had such a person, but he saw a brief flash of joy in the dangerous man’s eyes when Jun Wu Xie uttered the word ‘brother’.

That night, when Jun Wu Yao had rescued Jun Xian and brought him to the Imperial Palace gates, all eyes had been focused on Jun Xian, and no one had really noticed Jun Wu Yao then.

“What is so important that you came to find me so late in the night?” Mo Qian Yuan stepped away from Jun Wu Xie subconsciously, in order to distance himself from the dangerous Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Wu Xie replied simply: “The Soul Jade.”

“Soul Jade? Did you really…..”

Jun Wu Xie knew what he was going to say and shook her head resolutely.

“I will not hand the Soul Jade over to the Qing Yun Clan, and I want the other half of the Soul Jade that is with you.”

“What!?” Mo Qian Yuan exclaimed in wide eyed shock, looking at Jun Wu Xie in disbelief.

She wants to keep the Jun Family’s Soul Jade and….. she wants the Imperial Family’s half as well?

Has she gone mad?

“Wu Xie, what do you want the Soul Jade for? It’s just a symbolic ordinary piece of jade, and if you want, I can have people acquire better quality jade for you! To go against the Qing Yun Clan for a measly piece of jade isn’t the best decision you can make.” Mo Qian Yuan had always trusted in Jun Wu Xie’s decisions, but this time, it made him want to pull all his hair out in frustration.

Jun Wu Xie must have realised the consequences, right?

“Are you giving it or not?” Jun Wu Xie asked simply, her eyes narrowed. The Soul Jade being the Soul Calming Jade, Jun Wu Xie did not have the intention to explain it to Mo Qian Yuan as she could not afford to be careless with this matter that concerned Jun Gu.

This was the first time Jun Wu Xie had directed her icy stare at Mo Qian Yuan and he had a taste of the chill that that same stare had brought to Mo Xuan Fei and his gang.

Cold sweat beaded on his forehead. “If you want it, I will give it to you, but….. what about the Qing Yun Clan? You have seen it yourself. They are determined to get the Soul Jade and will stop at nothing to get it.”

“Give it to me and I will handle them.” Jun Wu Xie had no intention to shake hands and make peace with the Qing Yun Clan.

When she had made Bai Yun Xian take the poison, she knew then that she and the Qing Yun Clan could not coexist together.

Mo Qian Yuan’s heart sank into his shoes at Jun Wu Xie’s words. “You would go against the Qing Yun Clan!? ….. No! Wu Xie! You have seen Jiang Chen Qing’s powers! Even with the Rui Lin Army, we cannot stand up to the might of the twenty odd exponents in their delega…..”

Mo Qian Yuan could not finish his statement, the room was suddenly pervaded with an overpowering pressure. In the next moment, a mountainous force crushed upon his shoulders. That moment alone, made his whole body shake uncontrollably, making him lose all strength in his legs and he fell to the floor with a loud thud. His sweat flowed unabated, forming a pool around him upon the floor.

“Do as she says.” The voice was filled with power that rang within his ears. The voice had not been loud, but it had made his ears prick with stinging pain and blood trickled down a corner of his mouth, dripping onto his knees.
