But at this moment, Fei Yan was sitting on a chair. Although his face was covered with bandages and his eyes could not see anything, Jun Wu Xie knew what he was waiting for.

“Is he dead?” Fei Yan asked with his hoarse voice. His throat was also damaged because of the poisoning. That crisp voice no longer existed, his voice now was hoarse, like dead leaves rubbing on paper.

“Mn.” Jun Wu Xie answered gently. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Fei Yan did not move. His hands were holding tightly onto something.

Qiao Chu, who was at the side, bit his lip and his eyes had already turned red.

“I just hate that I can’t take revenge for Little Ruo with my own hands.” Fei Yan said with his muscles strained.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao at this moment. After Jun Wu Yao nodded slightly, she took a step forward. She walked to Fei Yan and pulled up Fei Yan’s hand. Fei Yan’s hand was holding a jade pendant that Rong Ruo used to hang on her waist.

The quality of the jade pendant was bad. It was inferior and its workmanship was very rough. It looked very inconspicuous.

However, this jade pendant was bought when Fei Yan was poor. He bought it from a stall when he went out one day. Although it was very cheap, it was only the only amount he could afford then after scrimping and saving. For Rong Ruo, she had been wearing it all the time. It was not suitable to wear it openly when she came to the Upper Realm, hence she had carefully kept it away.

And this piece of jade had become the last keepsake left by Rong Ruo.

Jun Wu Xie’s heart felt as if it was smashed by a heavy hammer. She took a deep breath and placed her hand into the Cosmos Sack. She took out a palm-sized ring and stuffed it into a Fei Yan’s hands.

When the ring was taken out, Bai Mo’s eyes suddenly widened.

Fei Yan was blind. He didn’t know what was placed in his hands. He felt that the item was a bit warm. He had a delicate feeling in his hands.

“What is this?” Fei Yan asked.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Fang Jinghe’s Spirit Ring.”

“What ?!” said Fei Yan with a shaky voice.

At this moment, Qiao Chu stood up in shock.

“I took the Spirit Ring from Fang Jinghe and the five others. This is what you need.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Long before she set off, she had already asked Jun Wu Yao about the possibility of attaining the Spirit Ring’s of others. Few people in the world could strip off the Spirit Ring. This problem was not difficult for Jun Wu Yao. He explained the details to Jun Wu Xie overnight, hence she used it to deal with the Top Ten Experts.

Jun Wu Xie did not care about the Spirit Ring at all.

She knew very well that with their current strength, if they wanted to stay in the Sacred City, there would be some difficulties. Before Jun Wu Xie was going to confront the Lord, she gave Qiao Chu and the rest a complete Spirit Ring! This was to prevent another similar tragedy from happening again.

“Little ... Little Xie... you ... you want us to use these ...” Qiao Chu had been dumbfounded, he had never seen anything so crazy.

“Sorry.” Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes. “I know that it may be unacceptable for you to use the Spirit Rings of our enemies. But I don’t want to lose any one of you any more.”
