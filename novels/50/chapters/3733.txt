“Please speak.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

Bai Xu looked at her before he continued with his words, “You can do whatever you want but there is something that you must promise. Although you have to ensure the safety of the soul bone, I do not wish for you to risk your own life in exchange.” Bai Xu was concerned about the soul bone as well as for Jun Wu Xie’s safety. The pain from the loss of Ren Huang was too great and he did not wish for his old friend’s beloved disciple to follow a similar tragedy.

“Alright.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

“Now then, you shall accompany me a trip to the Cloudy Brook Academy.” He suddenly said.

“Cloudy Brook Academy?” Jun Wu Xie was slightly stunned for a moment and did not understand why Bai Xu would suddenly request to go to the Cloudy Brook Academy.

Five years had passed and Jun Wu Xie had never stepped into the grounds of Cloudy Broke Academy ever since.

“Don’t you want the soul bone? If you do, follow me.” Bai Xu said, he could not deny that Jun Wu Xie’s medical skills were exceptional. In a mere span of five days, although he had not completely recovered, these five days of recuperation had already enabled him to take various modes of transportation, from boats to carriages without any repercussions. Such amazing skills with extraordinary talent, what more hidden cards did she have hidden up her sleeves?

Bai Xu did not know but he was willing to place all of his trust in her. To fulfil her quest for revenge was also helping his old friend to settle his blood debt.

Jun Wu Xie no longer asked any further and just arranged for people to settle the aftermath of the Nine Temples before she embarked on the journey to Cloudy Brook Academy with Qiao Chu and her companions, together with Bai Xu.

The Nine Temples had suffered heavy losses and it was difficult to recover in the short period of time. What the Upper Realm was focused on now, was to deal with Jun Wu Xie’s provocation. Hence they believed that the Middle Realm could have a short period of peace.

Returning once again to Mount Fu Yao and stepping into the Cloudy Brook Academy, it was apparent that time had changed many things.

Five years had passed, that was like sand running through one’s fingers, flowing quickly but quietly. For some people, it was just like smoke dissipating before one’s eyes, but for Cloudy Brook Academy, the traces of time was visible.

Over the past five years, not a single person had stepped into the premises of the Cloudy Brook Academy. The once resplendent Academy long turned into desolate ruins with weeds growing everywhere.

Standing outside Cloudy Brook Academy, Qiao Chu and the others were slightly stunned. They themselves had also studied here and even though it was not the first Academy that they had studied in, but to them, it was the first place in the Middle Realm that they had settled in.

However, the once flourishing academy had been lost to time forever. What was left was only the ruins from a large battle and the wilderness that was proof that this place had been deserted for a long time.

If it was many years ago, who would ever have thought that the number one Academy in the Middle Realm would ever have such a day?

Seated on the wheelchair, Bai Xu was pushed into Cloudy Brook Academy by Jun Wu Xie. His eyes that were filled with the vicissitudes of life were now full of sorrow as his gaze swept past the surroundings.

“It was here in the Cloudy Brook Academy where I first met with your Grandmaster. At that time, I was not a Medical Sage yet. I was merely a young and ignorant doctor. The reason that I came here was because I was sent here to cultivate and it was then that I had met your GrandMaster who was a little old man who was obsessed with refining medicine but totally ignorant of the various medicinal materials.” Bai Xu laughed lightly as he closed his eyes. He thought of the past and the scene where he met Ren Huang for the first time appeared before him. Just a simple meeting had intertwined both their fates and who would have thought that the two would eventually become bosom buddies?

Jun Wu Xie did not speak but instead, she lowered her head slightly, trying not to look at everything that surrounded them.

If she looked any more, it would bring back waves of memories from five years ago.
