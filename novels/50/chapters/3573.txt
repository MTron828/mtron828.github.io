Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“I have already said all that’s needed to be said. I think that you should have already comprehended the current situation. If you still insist on this, I will not ask any further. Rest assured, I will not talk to anyone about the matters today no matter whether you believe it or not. In the case of Nine Temples, the Upper Realm are enemies and not friends, we are just simply powerless.” Su Jing Yan smiled bitterly. If this was not the case, as the elder of the Heavenly Wolf Temple, I am afraid that no one could imagine that the illustrious Nine Temples, one of the major powerhouses in the Middle Realm could reveal such helplessness and weakness.

“Is the reason for the peace in the Nine Temples simply because of the Upper Realm or because of the Blood Sacrifice Array?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly asked.

Su Jing Yan looked at Jun Wu Xie strangely, he thought that she was here just to save people, but never did he expect... that she would actually know about the existence of the Blood Sacrifice Array.

“Yes.” Su Jing Yan gritted his teeth.

“The Upper Realm has ordered us to search for a precious artifact, and build the rune totems needed for the Blood Sacrifice Array in the Middle Realm. We didn’t know where the artifact was at first, until the news came from the Spirit Void Palace and divulged that it was hidden within Cloudy Brook Academy. It was from then on that...”

Before the Nine Temples, there was no malice against Cloudy Brook Academy until the news was released, which brought about the disaster to Cloudy Brook Academy.

“Spirit Void Palace...” The eyes of Jun Wu Xie narrowed as a dangerous glint flashed by. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Wasn’t the Young Palace Lord of the Spirit Void Palace the birth mother of Gu Ying? Wouldn’t that make the Palace Lord of the Spirit Void Palace the grandfather of Gu Ying?

In a mere moment, all the clues that were once scattered about in the mind of Jun Wu Xie gradually became clear. According to the information provided by Tian Ze, the very first time that Cloudy Brook Academy had noticed strange movements was precisely just the night before Gu Ying had left Cloudy Brook Academy. It was then that the news of the artifact being at Cloudy Brook Academy was divulged from Spirit Void Palace. All of this seems too coincidental and could only show prove that the news all came from Gu Ying!

Jun Wu Xie fell into silence. She also knew about the attack and they themselves had solved many killers. At that time, they did not think that it was actually a sign that was the start of the disaster of Cloudy Brook Academy...

“Nine Temples and the Upper Realm are enemies and not friends? That is not true.” A sudden voice that was filled with mirth transmitted over from the door.

Su Jing Yan was shocked and immediately turned to look.

However, just one glance and Su Jing Yan’s blood almost flowed backwards!

The handsome man standing in front of the door had a pair of violet eyes. The sexy thin lips evoked a sinuous arc. That pair of enchanting eyes clearly had a hint of smile, but Su Jing Yan only felt cold and terror.

“Dark Emperor...” Su Jing Yan uttered out in shock and couldn’t believe his eyes.

The very person standing at the door was the Dark Emperor that reigned over the Dark Regions that had fallen over a thousand years ago!

Wasn’t..wasn’t he already dead?!

The huge shock shrouded Su Jing Yan’s heart, and his heart felt like it was ready to jump out at anytime.

Jun Wu Yao strode over to the side of Jun Wu Xie in a leisurely manner, and rested one hand at the back of her chair. That pair of violet eyes fell on Su Jing Yan’s body.

“If I remember correctly, aren’t the Nine Temple Lords from the Upper Realm?” That voice that contained a hint of smile was very magnetic, but when it fell into Su Jing Yan’s ears, he could not help but tremble.

“The Palace Lords of the Nine Temples are from the Upper Realm?” There was a hint of surprise in the eyes of Jun Wu Xie. This piece of news was really amazing.

Jun Wu Yao curled his lips into a smirk and said: “In the past, the Upper Realm started the Lower Realm and the Middle Realm. In order to control the Middle Realm, nine people were sent to establish power in the Middle Realm. The nine people are now the Palace Lords of the Nine Temples.”
