Chapter 3056 Killing recovery 2

Obviously, Chi Yan was not going to say much.

Then ...

Since Chi Yan was reluctant to speak, he would force open his mouth and let him speak!

“Who the hell are you?” Chi Yan suddenly felt surrounded by a strong sense of oppression. With his strength, he felt a bit of breathing difficulty. The strength of this person in front of him was definitely not an ordinary follower and guard!

The corners of Jun Wu Yao’s mouth slightly lifted, and his evil eyes faded the disguised black color and restored its original purple ... His face changed after the content was fading a little bit, returning to his true appearance. .

Chi Yan stared at the unremarkable attendant before him. He instantly turned into a handsome and extraordinary man. Those purple eyes brought all the attention to Chi Yan in an instant!

Among the Three Realms, the only person who had purple eyes was the strongest person who could once match His Lord!

“Ye Jue! It’s you!” Chi Yan looked at Jun Wu Yao incredulously. He couldn’t believe it. The man who had been arrested by His Lord for thousands of years stood before his eyes at this moment.

Before this, this man had been disguised as a follower and followed them all the way. What was more terrible was that they were unaware of it!

Su Ruiying was shocked and stunned. When she realized Jun Wu Yao’s true identity, her mind was about to explode. She thought that she was so close to her death that she wanted to make Jun Wu Yao into a soul puppet doll. She was so scared that she couldn’t stand firmly...

If she really dared, she would have become a dead body!

“You still dare to come to the Upper Realm?” Chi Yan finally suppressed his inner shock. He looked at Jun Wu Yao unsteadily. He could not believe that Jun Wu Yao dare to return?

After being imprisoned twice in a row by His Lord, shouldn’t Jun Wu Yao be hiding far from the Upper Realms?

But ... how could he come back?

“Where is he?” Jun Wu Yao’s eyes narrowed slightly, dismissive of Chi Yan’s inquiry, and the only thing he wanted to know was where Jun Wu Xie was!

Up to now, Jun Wu Yao had realized that this time the itinerary was set by His Lord against Jun Wu Xie, just as he trapped him in the past. He would never allow this to once again happen to Jun Wu Xie!

Chi Yan sneered: “I was curious previously. With Yan Hai’s ability, how could such a big improvement be achieved in a short time. It turned out to be because of you, but it is a pity, no matter what you want to do now, it’s too late. Yan Hai had gone to where he should go according to His Lord’s plan. Other than Yan Hai and Gu Ying, there is no one else who set foot in that place. Even if I tell you where he is, you can’t find it! ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Jun Wu Yao’s eyes suddenly flashed a killing intent, the strong killing intent was suffocating.

Almost instantly, Chi Yan used the power of his whole body, and at the same time shouted at Su Ruiying, who was stunned: “Ying! What are you still looking at?”

Su Ruiying recovered in a trance, and hurriedly opened the red wooden box she carried with her. The two puppets fell to the ground from the box. Su Ruiying sipped, and the two puppets stood up immediately, and the two ray of lights immediately enveloped the two puppets.
