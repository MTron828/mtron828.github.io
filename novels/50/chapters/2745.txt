Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Jun Gu ... Do you know Lord Jun Gu?” Nangong Lie exclaimed.

Lord Jun Gu?

Jun Wu Xie’s brow frowned almost instantaneously. Nangong Lie really knew Jun Gu.

“Who is he?” Jun Wu Xie asked. The others might not say but not Nangong Lie. Jun Wu Xie had frightened Nangong Lie so much that the fear that had been deeply instilled into his bones.

Jun Wu Xie deliberately appeared in front of Nangong Lie to test his fear. To her surprise, he was much more terrified than she thought.

Nangong Lie opened his mouth and hesitated for a long time. Finally, with a trembling voice, he finally mustered up some courage and muttered, “The Knight of Destruction...”

“What?” Jun Wu Xie was distracted.

“Lord Jun Gu is one of the Knights of Destruction...” Nangong Lie said in a horrified tone. He had just mentioned something that even Jun Wu Yao knew nothing about. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ever since Jun Wu Yao escaped from the Upper Realm, the Lord had realized that the strength of the Top Ten Masters was not enough to satisfy him. Therefore, he had selected a few people from the Upper Realm and named them as the Knights of Destruction, just below him. Their status was above the Top Ten Masters. However, this was only thing about the Knights of Destruction that he knew about. Basically no one knew at the Upper Realm from the beginning.

Even the 72 cities must respect the Top Ten Masters, not to mention the Four Knights of Destruction who were one level higher than the Top Ten Masters. They had heard about the “Knights of Destruction” but they did not know who they were.

In the beginning, there was only one Knight of Destruction. The selection criteria was only known to the Lord. Those lucky ones who were selected would be blessed by the Lord and their power could be multiplied in a short span of time.

At that time, even the most famous Luo Qingcheng among the Top Ten Masters, if she faced a Knight of Destruction, she would not last for long in an exchange. But for the Knights of Destruction, the people in the Upper Realm no longer regarded them as normal people, so they would never rank them in the Upper Realm. This gave Luo Qingcheng the strongest title in the Upper Realm, other than the Lord.

In fact, the Top Ten Masters knew it for sure.

Even if the ten of them joined forces, they were not the opponent of even one knight.

“Lord Jun Gu is the latest Knight of Destruction. He was personally selected by the Lord himself a few years ago. Before Lord Jun Gu became a Knight of Destruction, no one had seen him. He was a nobody who appeared out of nowhere. But ... his strength is amazing ... “Nangong Lie told Jun Wu Xie all he knew about Jun Gu. He didn’t know why Jun Wu Xie suddenly asked about Jun Gu. He didn’t dare not answer and spilled all he knew out.

“Sure enough.” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed. Jun Gu’s situation was as she expected. His position was higher than the Top Ten Masters.

“Where is he now?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Nangong Lie shook his head.

“The Knights of Destruction rarely comes in contact with us. We are like nobodies to them. How can we know where they live? All I know is that Miss Yan Xi seems to be always by his side.”

“Yan Xi.” Jun Wu Xie’s mind suddenly remembered the woman who had taken Jun Gu away that day with that murderous look in her eyes.

Jun Gu’s mind was controlled by the rhinoceros horn. Just as Jun Wu Xie predicted, Yan Xi was just a chess piece used by the Lord to control Jun Gu.
