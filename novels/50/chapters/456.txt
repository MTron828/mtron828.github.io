Chapter 457: “Consecutive Slaps – First Form (4)”

Li Zi Mu found himself suddenly grabbed by two others and slammed hard against a tree. He felt as if his spine had almost snapped from the impact upon the sharp jagged tree trunk and he suddenly felt nauseated.

“ARRGGHH! What are you doing?! Let me go! I’ll have you know I’m a disciple of the Spirit Healer faculty! How dare you treat me with such disrespect !? When we get back to the academy, I’ll teach you pieces of trash some manners !” Li Zi Mu’s eyes were wide open. He stared in disbelief at the sudden attack from Hua Yao and Qiao Chu.

The sudden assault left Fan Jin shocked and he stood rooted to the ground. He turned reflexively to look at Jun Xie, his eyes filled with horror and unease.

“If you cannot bear to watch, you can go somewhere else first.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Fan Jin a moment and she turned to walk towards Li Zi Mu.

Fan Jin felt his heart skipped a beat. Something in his heart was telling him that those words Jun Xie had said before entering the Battle Spirits Forest had not been a joke at all!

And he was about to go fulfil the prophecy of those very words!

“Little Xie!” Fan Jin subconsciously grabbed Jun Xie’s arm, looking at him in terror.

However, when he saw Jun Xie’s unnaturally chilly eyes looking back at him, he found his grip loosening involuntarily.

On the other side, Li Zi Mu was screaming incessantly and Fei Yan ambled over casually, raised his hand, and slapped Li Zi Mu across the face a few times.

“What are you screaming for? The result is still death, save your energy.”

Li Zi Mu was dizzy from the slaps, and the handprints were red on his face. He trembled as he looked at Fei Yan to ask: “What..... what are you going to..... to do.....”

Fei Yan shrugged and took a step back, to allow Jun Xie enough space to stand right before Li Zi Mu.

At the moment Li Zi Mu’s eyes fell upon Jun Xie, both his legs crumbled. The pair of eyes staring at him sent chills up his spine with its undisguised murderous intent. Even a fool would be able to tell that Jun Xie had every intention to kill him.

“Jun..... Jun Xie..... wha..... What do you want.....” Li Zi Mu was sweating profusely, he found it difficult to breathe under the gaze of those chillingly frosty eyes.

“I stole your spot right?” Jun Wu Xie asked, her eyebrow raised. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Li Zi Mu shook his head vigorously. “No..... no..... Master had explained it all to me..... I did not mean it and I was wrong..... It has nothing to do with you.....”

“But that was not what you were telling everybody else.” Jun Wu Xie said, her head tilted as if in query, as she stared at Li Zi Mu’s face, completely drained of colour.

Li Zi Mu panicked. He had spread those malicious rumours to attract more attention to himself. But if he had known that he would end up in Jun Xie’s hands like this, he would never have spoken a single word against him!

“I am sorry, I am really sorry..... I beg you to spare me, I promise that I will never spout such nonsense ever again! I will clear everything up when we get back. I had lied, and you are completely innocent! I guarantee it! I will tell them everything! I will apologise! I am sorry!” Li Zi Mu was pleading with tears and mucus running down his face. He prayed that Fan Jin would save him but Fan Jin just stood on one side, unmoving, his head lowered and silent, having no intention of interfering.

And these disciples from the branch division, were obviously on the same side as Jun Xie, or they wouldn’t have grabbed him so suddenly, with just a single command from Jun Xie.

“I beg you, let me go.....”

Jun Wu Xie looked on indifferently as Li Zi Mu pleaded and begged, and she could not find it within herself to give him any sympathy.

“If you let me go, I..... I will obey your every word henceforth. I am a disciple of the Spirit Healer faculty and I know Spirit Healing. I will serve under you .....” Li Zi Mu brought up the Spirit Healer faculty once again, in an attempt to save his own life.
