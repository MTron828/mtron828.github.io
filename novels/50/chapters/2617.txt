Chapter 2618: The Soul Ascending Altar (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

There was a weird feeling arising from the bottom of Jun Gu’s heart. The words “Jun Wu Xie” sounded inexpressibly familiar to him. He seemed to have heard the name before but he simply couldn’t bring it to his mind no matter how.

“It feels like I’ve heard the name before from somewhere else.” Jun Gu slightly knitted his brows into a frown. There seemed to be a voice constantly urging him to recall something, but it was completely blank in his mind.

Yan Xi’s heart gave out a shudder, but she was still pretending to be calm on the face.

“It’s just a trash from the Lower Realm. You don’t have to waste your time for her, Lord Jun Gu. The problem now is that Meng Qiu is dead, and now that Ye Jue is in the Soul World, we’re not sure if he has noticed us. Hence, we should no longer delay the Soul Sacrificing Event anymore. We need to settle it down as soon as possible before getting into trouble.”

“You want to avoid the battle?” Jun Gu looked at Yan Xi, seemingly to be absorbed in thoughts. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yan Xi nodded her head.

“Although half of Ye Jue’s power has been suppressed, it’s still not that easy to deal with him with the remaining strength he has. If we keep entangling with him, it might probably obstruct our plan in carrying out the Soul Sacrificing Event. Although Meng Qiu is dead now, we’ve already gotten everything ready. There’s no need for us to fight face to face against Ye Jue. We just have to activate the Soul Sacrificing Array and everything will be done.”

While speaking, Yan Xi was just staring at the floor in front of her feet. In terms of strength, His Lord was the only person among the entire Three Realms who was able to rival Ye Jue during the period of time when Ye Jue was in his apex. But now, half of Ye Jue’s strength had been sealed off, and with the recent power Jun Gu got, there wasn’t really anything for him to be afraid of, it was just that...

A trace of trepidation flashed across Yan Xi’s eyes. The condition of Jun Gu was still unstable as his temperament was yet to be fully finalized. If something went wrong during the battle, which led his state of mind into turbulence, the responsibilities would then be something that Yan Xi was unable to take on.

Jun Gu frowned. He was quite confident with the power he owned, but the fact that Yan Xi was so quick in proposing the suggestion to avoid the battle had caused him to be a little frustrated. There seemed to have a kind of passion raging invisibly inside him, leading him in having a craving for a hearty and contented battle, and also for the great satisfaction when fighting against a strong opponent.

There was a weird aroma pervading in the main hall, constantly stimulating the nerves of Jun Gu, as if it was trying to extinguish his passion.

“Lord Jun Gu, I know that you have no fear for Ye Jue’s power, but please do look more into the overall interests, surely that His Lord is not willing to let you suffer from any injuries.” After noticing the defiance shown by Jun Gu, purposefully, Yan Xi softened her voice.

It seemed like there was some kind of special energy added into the voice. With the voice blending into the incense of the Rhinoceros Horn, the defiance of Jun Gu eventually subsided.

“Fine, just go and make the arrangement.” Jun Fu was slightly annoyed. It was certain that he was unwilling to accept all of these, but he was unable to control his mind. Such feeling irritated him very much.

“Yes.” Inwardly, Yan Xi let out a sigh of relief. She then immediately left the hall to prepare for the Soul Sacrificing Array.

Ever since the day Meng Qiu came and asked about the preparation of the event, they had already gotten the Soul Sacrificing Array ready, and it could be activated anytime.

Walking out of the palace, Yan Xi’s face had completely changed into a different expression. With her eyes filling with arrogance, she looked at those soldiers from the Upper Realm. Her gaze then swept across those spirit envoys who were empty in the eyes, being locked up in the prisons, with a quick glance.

“Activate the Soul Sacrificing Array now.” Yan Xi’s voice was heard abruptly around the Soul Ascending Altar.

Followed by Yan Xi’s voice was the one hundred and eight beacon towers, which were located around the Soul Ascending Altar, being lit up. There were numerous green flames burning, causing the bright Soul Ascending Altar to be enshrouded with a peculiar green light!
