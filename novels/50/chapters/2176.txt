Chapter 2177: Bloody Battle at the Summit of Mount Fu Yao (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

For the entire three days, Jun Wu Xie did not leave the room half a step, except for the black cat, no one knows what she did in there.

On the third day, when the sun peeked out over the horizon, a ray of sunlight shone through the window and illuminated the lands.

In the quiet room, there were scattered herbal residues all over the ground and it was also filled with bottles.

Sitting on the floor, she covered the lid of the last bottle. She sighed softly and her eyes fell on the pill bottle in her hand. Her eyes were cold and vacant, what was going on in her mind could not be deciphered one bit.

The black cat stood up, and its small claws nimbly stepped on the empty spaces between the clutter on the floor and reached her side.

“Meow.” It made a soft and gentle purr and rubbed affectionately against the back of Jun Wu Xie’s hand.

Jun Wu Xie raised her head, reached out and gently stroked its head before she swept all the bottles on the ground into the Cosmos Sack.

Could the three day struggle be exchanged victory?

No one knows.

...

It was a pleasant day in spring and the sun was shining brightly high in the sky. There was not a cloud in the sky, under the sunlight, the green hills dazzled like emeralds and the birds were chirping merrily alongside the gentle sound of flowing water from the stream. No one would ever think that it was a completely different scene at Mount Fu Yao.

The Cloudy Brook Academy, which had been abandoned for more than half a year, suddenly had a group of uninvited guests, which disrupted the tranquility of the academy.

Under the bright sunshine, team after team of people streamed out of the loft of Cloudy Brook Academy as countless people gathered in the largest square of Cloudy Brook Academy.

In front of the cloud stone statue, which once symbolized the glory of Cloudy Brook Academy, the neatly dressed Nine Temples disciples stood on both sides. They each had on a sombre expression and stood there without uttering a single word.

The large stream of people that spilled out of the Spirit Mastery Faculty were tall and majestic, and they each had outstanding temperaments despite being dressed in simple understated luxurious black robes .

Amongst the Middle Realm, the Nine Temples disciples were considered to be dragons among men, however when the men in black appeared, the Nine Temples disciples on both sides breathing had a trace of disarray. They did not even dare not look directly at the faces of those men in black and could only lower their heads to sneak a peek.

Among the group of awe inspiring black robed men, a shocking figure suddenly emerged.

The clanging sound of the gong reverberated across the vast square. A frail and thin woman gradually entered the sight of the Nine Temples disciples under the admonishment of those black robed men. She looked to be a woman in her twenties. She was tall and slender with a pair of subversive eyes. She should have been a beautiful woman, but at this moment, no one was in the mood to appreciate her beauty.

She was bound with heavy fetters of iron around her ankles, and her fair skin was covered with bloody wounds caused by the tightly bounded shackles around her ankles. She was walking barefooted, and the skin on her feet were broken, as a trail of blood followed behind. Each step she took left a blood red footprint, as she left a bloody trail wherever she walked, the sight of the blood red footprints were chilling.

Not only her feet, but on the woman’s body, she was covered with raw wounds and almost no part had her skin intact. The robes she wore were ragged and tattered, stained with blood and mud, even the original colour of the clothes could not be distinguished. On the that pair of bone thin hands, a pair of handcuffs were attached, and a long chain extended from the handcuffs to her back. A large iron ball with the size of a head was placed behind her, making every step she made a huge torment.
