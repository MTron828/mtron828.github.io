Jun Wu Xie was still sympathetic to Bai Mo’s tragic experience, while on the street, Bai Mo and Nangong Lie were facing each other measure for measure.

“Ah, by the way, I heard that you seem to have colluded with one of the City Lords from the 72 cities right? How sad it that? As one of the top ten exponents, you are standing with the people of the 72 cities. You’ve really lost face as one of the top ten exponents.” Bai Mo smiled as he said this. His immature face was extraordinarily innocent because of that smile, but the killing intent in his eyes made it impossible for him to be treated as a harmless child.

Nangong Lie’s face turned even more ugly. The news of his cooperation with Jun Wu Xie was passed on, whether intentionally or unintentionally, by the people of the 72 cities, and it had made his reputation among the top ten exponents dropped significantly.

Ever since Nangong Lie became one of the top ten exponents, the criticisms against his birth in 72 cities never stopped. Among the top ten exponents, he was the only one who came from the 72 cities, and after becoming one of the top ten exponents, he didn’t sever his relationship with them.

In fact, the top ten exponents did not have any regard for the 72 cities. In their minds, the 72 cities were just like ants, small and humble. Thus, Nangong Lie had always been under the scrutiny of the other exponents, he was even ostracised. However, because of the father-son relationship with Nangong Yan, he had to tolerate them.

“You’re just a puppet raised by Nangong Yan. Even if you have the capabilities, you’re still unable to get rid of your stench. Since you like the 72 cities so much, why not just go back?” Bai Mo smiled as he looked at Nangong Lie, his eyes were full of contempt and disdain for Nangong Lie.

Bai Mo should have participated in the top ten exponents’ trials long ago. With his strength, he would not have any trouble getting into the top five. However, because of that accident, he was bedridden for more than a thousand years, it was only in the recent hundred years that he gradually recovered. But, he had missed the previous selection for the top ten exponents. This time, he was able to finally grasp this opportunity, and naturally he would not want to miss it the slightest.

In his opinion, based on his strength, Nangong Lie was not worthy of becoming one of the top ten exponents. With him occupying this position, it only made others feel like he was a taint!

“Are you done?” Nangong said coldly.

“What? Getting angry? Alright, since the trials are in two days... Why not... Let me practice on you? If I kill you today, then I should be able to enter directly into the top ten.” Bai Mo wasn’t scared at all, but was more savage.

The people, who were watching on the side, were already stunned by the atmosphere in front of them. Many of them didn’t know the origins of Bai Mo. There was only one person from White Night City, who after much pondering, finally remembered Bai Mo’s identity as he screamed... nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“You are Lord Bai Mo!”

This scream made people come back to their senses. They might not recognise the appearance of Bai Mo, but they were not unfamiliar with the name ‘Bai Mo’.

The demon who single-handedly killed White Night City’s team seeking assistance...

“Bai Mo! He is Bai Mo?”

“Oh my God! He is the Bai Mo who challenged the Ye Jue?”

Shock spread like a tidal wave spread among the crowd. Bai Mo enjoyed the fear and awe he inspired but when he heard the words ‘Ye Jue’, the smile on his face disappeared in an instant, he immediately turned towards the man who spoke and pulled him out of the crowd!
