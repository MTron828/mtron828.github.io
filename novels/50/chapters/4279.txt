“Lord ...” That pathetic voice really made people’s bones crisp.

Though Han Zi Fei had a smile on her face, she no longer had a smile shown in her eyes. She secretly pinched Jun Gu’s waist and secretly blamed him for being unfaithful.

Look, someone is relating her grievance to you, begging you to uphold justice.

Han Zi Fei glared at Jun Gu.

Jun Gu was pinched hard on his waist but he did not feel any pain or itch. However, it was Han Zi Fei’s eyes that were filled with scorn that made him nervous and he tried to explain himself quickly. But he received another hint from Han Zi Fei. So for the time being, he put aside the thought of asking forgiveness from his wife. He looked at Yanxi seriously and said, “What the hell is going on?”

Yan Xi intended to talk about her grievances, but Duan Qi would not let her speak. Instead she replied, “Misunderstandings, it’s all misunderstandings ... Today is the big day for Lord Yan to choose a beauty. But I did not expect that I would be here and blessed to win the favor of Lord Yan. Have I just created some trouble? Yan Xi was originally Lord Jun Gu’s person and now that I have let .... Lord Yan... and ... Lord Jun Gu, how should it ...”

Duan Qi had been trying hard to minimise the issues and disputes. She completely ignored the incident that Yan Xi was slapped. Instead, she chose to mention that Yan Xi intentionally attended the banquet to seduce Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Gu frowned. But Han Zi Fei sneered: “Oh? How could I not know that this Yan Xi is my husband’s person...” Although the tone was light, any fool could hear Han Zi Fei’s dissatisfaction.

Look at the butterflies you have attracted.

Jun Gu quickly explained himself: “No, no...Yan Xi was the person assigned by His Lord to help me to familiarise with the surroundings when I first became a Knight of Destruction. So the manner of saying that she is my person, is not appropriate.”

Wife, please hear my explanation!

“Since His Lord has given her to you, why is she still not yours? Now Yan Xi is fancied by Lord Yan, why? Unwilling to give away?” Han Zi Fei raised an eyebrow slightly.

I would deal with you when I head back. Do what’s best for your girl.

“My lady is teasing me. Yan Xi and I have purely master and servant relations. There’s definitely nothing going on between us. Since Lord Yan fancies Yan Xi, I will congratulate him.” Jun Gu smiled.

I’ll do it!

Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu were arguing like a newlywed couple. At the same moment, Yan Xi’s identity and relationship with Jun Gu had been cut clean. Now that Jun Gu has given his approval and promised to marry Yan Xi to Jun Wu Xie.

This time, Duan Qi really had no choice.

Han Shu stared like she lost her soul. She couldn’t believe the rare opportunity that she had been waiting for was snatched before her.

The most shocking was Yan Xi. She looked at the loving scene of Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei. Her heart was feeling complicated. She was not foolish enough not to hear Jun Gu’s intentions. Thinking of her devotion towards him, was so neglected by Jun Gu. How could he just give her away so easily. The trace of love in her heart turned into hatred between these complex emotions ...

Yan Xi subconsciously turned her head to look at Jun Wu Xie. She stood in front of her, a flame at this moment quietly ignited in her heart.

As far as his current status was concerned, the young man in front of her may not be better than Lord Jun Gu. But his strength of the Dual Spirit Ring was the most valuable stake. Yan Xi was very clear that as long as Lord Yan was given more time, there would be great achievements!𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
