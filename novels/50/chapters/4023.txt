Chapter 2619: The Soul Sacrificing Event (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In a twinkling, the green flames gathered at the centre of the Soul Ascending Altar with numerous beams of green rays connecting to the one hundred and eight beacon towers. There were prisons where the soul entities were being locked up between each beacon towers. While being enshrouded with the green light, those wretched soul entities looked even more miserable at the moment. Screams coming from the depth of their souls could be heard, one after another, around the Soul Ascending Altar. It was such a bloodcurdling wail, as if a nightmare had befallen!

The moment the beacon towers were lit up, all the human souls from the Upper Realm pinned an emerald badge onto their chests. The badge seemed to have formed a protective shield around each of them, isolating them from the green light.

The beams of light converged above the Soul Ascending Altar. The runes that were engraved into the floor of the Soul Ascending Altar were covered under the light. The runes gave out a gold halo, which then connected with each other into a circle. The halo shoot upwards all of a sudden, straight towards the ball of green light!

And that was at the right moment, as if the green light sphere had gotten exploded, the cloud of eerie light spread across the entire Soul World!

Long Jiu and Qin Song were hastily leading Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao to the Soul Ascending Altar with a bunch of spirit envoys following behind them. When they were just not far from the Soul Mountain, they stopped their steps abruptly.

“What’s that?” Long Jiu looked up with his eyes big widening in disbelief. Coming above from the Soul Mountain, there was a green light spreading in all directions at an extremely high speed!

An ominous feeling began to hover over the heart of every spirit envoy.

“Oh no! The Upper Realm must have done something, they’ve known about the death of Meng Qiu.” The heart of Qin Song beat tremulously.

However, just as the moment they stopped, the green light had already come dashing towards them.

When the green light went over their heads, all the spirit envoys lost their energy at the instant, and in just the blink of an eye, those spirit envoys who were following behind Jun Wu Xie collectively collapsed onto the ground, legs flaccid, not being able to stand up.

Even Long Jiu and Qin Song had crumpled on the floor, feeling all sluggish, as if all their soul power had been sucked out by someone.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were the only two people who did not feel anything, but there wasn’t any single spirit envoy around them who was able to get up.

“What’s going on?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Long Jiu and the others who had fallen onto the ground with a trace of shock coming out from her eyes.

“I-... I don’t know... There’s something wrong... with this light... It feels like our soul power has been sucked out by someone else...” Arduously, Qin Song responded. It was just a simple sentence, but it took so much energy for Qin Song to speak it out.

The bodies of Qin Song and the others were turning transparent at a speed that was visible to the naked eyes. This was the exact same condition as Meng Qiu’s condition before he vanished! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Looks like the Spirit Tree is right. The Upper Realm wants to sacrifice all the soul entities in the Soul World. The light is the sign of them activating the array.” Jun Wu Yao narrowed his pair of eyes. As expected, the Upper Realm was fast with their actions. How pitiful of Meng Qiu thinking that he was able to have the Spirit Tree all for himself if he cooperated with the Upper Realm. He had no idea that the array used by the Upper Realm was actually aiming to sacrifice the whole Soul World. Once the array was activated, even the Spirit Tree couldn’t be excluded from being affected.

“Lord Ye Jue... please... save the... Soul World...” Not even having the energy to raise himself up, Qin Song could only raise his head miserably and looked at Jun Wu Yao with his imploring eyes.

Jun Wu Yao nodded.

“Why are we fine?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao. All the spirit envoys had been affected by the light, but she and Jun Wu Yao were the only two people who didn’t suffer from any abnormality.
