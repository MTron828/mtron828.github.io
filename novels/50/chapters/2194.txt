“Whether it is ascending to heaven or not, we must first see the abilities of the lot of you. Even though you all are powerful, us people from the Middle Realm are not afraid of death!” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord sneered, his oppressive and domineering aura increased as he looked at the battlefield. In a glance, he saw that the entire square had been dyed red with fresh blood and Jun Wu Xie’s injuries made him knit his brows tightly. However, what made him even more angry was that the Nine Temple disciples who stood on all sides and spectated.

“Today, I may not be able to prevail, however I would not yield to the Upper Realm. The Upper Realm is trying to gain more power by sacrificing the three realms in exchange. I would like to ask, people from the Middle Realm, are you willing to be used in such a manner?”

“Willing? Ha ha ha! Where did you this jumping clown jump out from? The timing you can see that this group of dogs had long been raised by me? I let them live, they shall live. If I want them to die, they shall die! Who dares to say a single word more?” Ba He’s crude manner of speaking and his arrogance had long made those Nine Temple disciples faces ashened.

A group of dogs...

This was the Upper Realm’s evaluation of the Nine Temples.

The group of Nine Temple disciples who had been suppressing their dissatisfaction in their hearts were now glaring at the arrogant Ba He with bloodshot eyes.

They may be weak, may be incompetent, but they were not willing to be dogs!

“So sad...this is too tragic, I can’t believe that the Nine Temples who used to be above the Twelve Palaces had now become so weak and incompetent. Even if they’ve been bullied to such an extent, yet they do not do anything about it. I will not recognise this group of cowards as people from the Middle Realm!” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord said sombrely.

His words made the Nine Temple disciples reveal embarrassment on their faces. Each and every word he uttered pierced the dignity of the Nine Temple disciples. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You with the surname ‘Hu’! I never knew that you were such a person! Mentor Su Ya had been caught, headmaster is being oppressed but yet you just stand at the sidelines and watch our saviour fall into desperation and ignore it! I don’t have such a brother, we shall break all our ties! If I can come live past today, I will kill you, this ungrateful disciple!” The man who came with the Spirit Jade Palace Lord harshly berated one of the disciple from the Nine Temples.

They were very familiar each other, however they had each recognised different masters. They were fine all along, however, never had expected that after all that happened today, they had broken off all ties of their brotherhood.

Other than the Spirit Jade Palace disciples who followed the Spirit Jade Palace Lord, there were those who had once studied in the Cloudy Brook Academy. They were all loyal to the Twelve Palaces. After the destruction of the Twelve Palaces, they were filled with pride and indignant justice and vowed to retaliate. However, once the crimes of the Twelve Palaces were revealed before the people, their conscience pricked them and no longer thought to seek revenge. That year when the Spirit Jade Palace rose up, they chose to disappear and meld into the crowd. He had been feeling remorseful over his actions all this while.

Until...

A few days ago, the Spirit Jade Palace had announced a shocking piece of news!

Cloudy Brook Academy was in peril and it had summoned all the former disciples to come together. It was precisely this piece of news that brought together all those who had that remaining thread of of conscience. They may have fallen into the mud, however they were still good people at heart. Knowing that their saviour was in trouble, how could they just sit by and watch?

In just a few days, the number of disciples from the Cloudy Brook Academy came from all over and it had reached a staggering number of tens of thousands! It was precisely this group of loyal and upright people that had banded together with the Spirit Jade Palace and directly killed their way in to Mount Fu Yao!

That person whose surname was Hu, stared with wide eyes, his heart was extremely uncomfortable and filled with shame, so much that his clenched fists were trembling uncontrollably.
