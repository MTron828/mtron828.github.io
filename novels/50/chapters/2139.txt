And Gu Ying had been severely wounded. Not only had there not been any movements from the Nine Temples, but even the Spirit Void Temple itself had not shown the slightest reaction. That in itself was highly abnormal.

Jun Wu Xie felt that the Nine Temples’ lack of reaction was not mere coincidence and they must have other motives.

“It’s strange to say in the least. The Nine Temples have been too docile throughout all this, and it’s not like their style like they were in the past.” Ye Mei said as he creased up his brows slightly. They, the Night Regime had followed Jun Wu Yao to conquer the entire Middle Realm, and they had encountered all the major powers of the Middle Realm before. The Twelve Palaces’ might back at that time was not as great as what they were commanding more recently and the Nine Temples reigned. The Four Sides did not involve themselves in worldly affairs like in present times and though it could be said that the Nine Temples style of doing things were not as arrogant as how the Twelve Palaces carried themselves, they kept a very tight rein on holding their position as the highest power in the Middle Realm.

Not to mention allowing the Twelve Palaces to expand unrestrained, even if they had stepped out of line a little, the Nine Temples would immediately knock some sense into them.

But over this period, the Nine Temples had really been too quiet, the kind of quiet that would not only make others become unable to be as ease, it would make people feel nervous.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed. Towards the Nine Temples, she knew nothing about them, but just the things she had heard from the mouths of Ye Mei and the others, while Jun Wu Yao was not even interested in knowing anything about Nine Temples, Twelve Palaces and such.

“Continue to observe them, and do not let down your guard.” Jun Wu Xie said.

“Yes.” Ye Mei nodded.

As Jun Wu Xie was speaking with them, the sound of knocking sounded from behind the door and Ye Sha immediately went to open it.

Upon opening the door, Ye Sha was slightly taken aback when he saw the person standing outside.

“I have no ill intentions. I only want to see her for a moment.” A gentle female voice sounded.

The voice reached Jun Wu Xie’s ears and Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes up slightly. Ye Sha’s towering figure completely blocked out the person outside the door but the sound of that voice was so familiar to her.

“Ye Sha, let her come in.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Ye Sha hesitated slightly, but then quickly moved to allow the person a way in.

A young lady wearing a rice white dress with a beautiful countenance stood outside the door, her long black hair draped loosely over her shoulders. The young lady’s looks were rather outstanding, but upon that countenance was also a steady calm that should not appear on a person her age.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the young lady before her eyes, her heart unusually calm. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You’ve come back.” The young lady said slowly, the eyes gazing at Jun Wu Xie looking highly conflicted, tinged with traces of surprise, and also a bit of bitterness, but were mostly filled with a kind of calm.

“Mm.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly.

For a moment, the two of them looked at each other without a word, and a awkward silence fell upon the room.

The young lady’s head then lowered slightly, her eyes looking down.

Jun Wu Xie was silent for a moment before she suddenly asked: “You do not hate me?”

The young lady raised her head up to look at Jun Wu Xie, before she slowly revealed a slight bitter smile.

“Maybe I should hate you, but I can’t make myself do it.”

“Gu Xin Yan, I brought people to destroy your father’s power and his forces. Don’t you hate me for that?” Jun Wu Xie said slowly.

The young lady standing before Jun Wu Xie was not anyone else but the Blood Fiend Palace’s Young Mistress from before, Gu Xin Yan.

Back then, on the day of the Twelve Palaces’ summit, Jun Wu Xie had lead men to wipe out the members of the Twelve Palaces. Gu Xin Yan was severely wounded by Jun Wu Xie when she tried to save Gu Yi, which lead to Gu Ying flying into a rage. Jun Wu Xie had saved Gu Xin Yan in the end but as Gu Xin Yan had been to seriously wounded then, Jun Wu Xie had had no choice but to hand her over into the care of Granny Yue from the Spirit Jade Palace, where she left behind medicine for the wound before she set forth on her journey to the Spirit World.
