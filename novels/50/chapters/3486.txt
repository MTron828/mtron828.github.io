Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Weapon Spirits mobilized by Soul Slayer immediately charged into the battlefield, coordinating with the human spirits as they moved to surround the Beast Spirits.

“Soul Slayer, are you really going to help Wu Jiu?” Flame Dragon asked as it stared at Soul Slayer in disbelief. Although Flame Dragon was not on all that familiar terms with Soul Slayer, but as the leader of the Weapon Spirits, how could it possibly fall for Wu Jiu’s ploy so easily?

Soul Slayer then replied in an indignant voice: “I am not helping him, but helping the Weapon Spirits ourselves! You Beast Spirits are so numerous in number and have been so used to being in a superior position, and you have been in that position for far too long. The Weapon Spirits are no longer willing to lie low and play second fiddle where the Weapon Spirits shall now finally rise!”

Soul Slayer’s voice had just fallen and it immediately leapt to fly straight towards the battlefield.

Flame Dragon cursed and immediately followed after.

For Soul Slayer to be able to become the Weapon Spirits leader, its might was not to be doubted. If it was allowed to fight the Beast Spirits, the resulting death toll might not be something that Flame Dragon would be able to take.

Wu Jiu stood before his chair as he watched the Weapon Spirits and human spirits push the Beast Spirits into a corner. His eyes were lit with an excited fiery light and everything that was happening before his eyes made it impossible for him to hold back from laughing out aloud.

With the Weapon Spirits on their side, the human spirits no longer had to fear. They all then charged straight at the Beast Spirits with a loud battlecry with the Weapon Spirits beside them!

To protect the Spiritual Bear, all the Beast Spirits let out a Heaven shaking roar. Faced with a combined army that far exceeded their numbers, the Beast Spirits did not show the slightest hesitation as they met the onslaught of the enemies pouncing right upon them!

In a blink.....

Human spirits, Beast Spirits, and Weapon Spirits tangled themselves up before the first Serene Spirit Tower, battlecries, roars, and the unique clanging of metal intertwined together in the air.

The battle among the spirits had no grisly blood, nor was there the nauseating stench of blood, but it still quaked the hearts of people all the same. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The Beast Spirits that were shredded apart let out their final roars, holding firmly onto their beliefs till the last moment, even when their spirit souls dissipated, they did not turn their backs on their Spiritual Bear.

With that belief in their hearts, close to a thousand Beast Spirits held their ground to slash at their enemies, continuously using their fangs, their claws, to tear through every enemy that sought to get close to the Spiritual Bear.

The bloodless battlefield, was however still suffocatingly stirring and tragic. The spirit souls scattering and dispersing into the air quietly, silent and without a sound as they disappeared from the world, not even able to leave behind a corpse.....

Flame Dragon blocked Soul Slayer’s way forward, and the Beast Spirits’ leader and the Weapon Spirits’ then commenced their epic battle.

One side was fighting to defend their spiritual leader, and the other side was seeking to gain might for a greater future. This was a battle that belonged to the two of them, though bitter, but they were fighting strongly, firm in their beliefs.

Within the chaos of battle, Jun Wu Xie directed the black beast to charge and kill off the human spirits and Weapon Spirits lunging at them. The black beast opened its jaws wide, tearing and biting through all the enemies before it and devouring them.

The power Spirit Devour!

This was an unique ability of the Black Beast’s, where it was able to devour any spirit body!

The black beast morphed into a black coloured whirlwind, like a wraith that swept over the battlefield, and wherever it passed, it left behind a trail of spirits who had yet to completely dispersed, to finally scatter into the wind.

Jun Wu Xie had pulled Nalan Shan out from his dangerous spot in the first instance, thinking to open the Soul Binding Chains on Nalan Shan’s hands.

“It’s no use. Without the key, the Soul Binding Chains would....” Nalan Shan was just merely halfway through his sentence when he saw Jun Wu Xie use a fine and tiny little hairpin to ope the Soul Binding Chains’ lock.

With a clatter, the Soul Binding Chains around Nalan Shan’s wrists then fell to land right by his feet.....
