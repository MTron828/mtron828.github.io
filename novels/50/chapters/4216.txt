Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

One day later, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were ready to go. Before leaving, they took Zheng Weilong and Ah Da together with them.

In the entire Sea Spirit City, there were only the troops of the Night Regime and the Ghost Army. In this way, if they retreat, they would not be noticed by anyone.

Jun Wu Xie prepared several carriages.Those for the maidens were divided into three carriages. Several carriages traveled from outside the Sea Spirit City. The opened door of the Sea Spirit City was slowly closing. Zheng Weilong looked through the window. At a glance, something vaguely felt that it was quietly proceeding.

“Miss, what’s wrong?” Ah Da asked, looking upset at Zheng Weilong’s face.

Zheng Weilong shook her head. “I don’t know what happened, I feel a little flustered.”

In the past few days, Jun Wu Xie rarely recruited her. It was not until yesterday night that she was sent to inform her about her trip today. Zheng Weilong was a little puzzled about going to the holy mountain with Jun Wu Xie. It was rather logical that Jun Wu Xie need not take her along at all.

“Lady, are you worried about the maiden thing?” Ah Da asked tentatively.

Zheng Weilong smiled bitterly: “What can I worry about? The target of The Sacred Maiden Tribe is the City Lord, and we are just foils.”

Ah Da looked at Zheng Weilong thoughtfully.

In another carriage, Duan Qi was sullen with a face. She looked at the three maiden of The Sacred Maiden Tribe who were sitting in the same carriage with her. One of them was Han Shu.

“This time, invited Yan Hai to the Holy Mountain, you should be very clear on my intention. No matter what method you use, you have to conquer him before he leaves the Holy Mountain, otherwise you will be locked up and age alone. The cellar is lonely and old, do you understand? “Duan Qi looked at the three women coldly.

These three people, including Han Shu, were the most likely women of the maidens to give birth to a saint. As long as one of the three of them could get him, Duan Qi was convinced that they could birth the next saint. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Yes.” All three women nodded honestly and darde not have any objections.

But Han Shu’s lowered face was hung with unwillingness.

“This matter affects the prosperity of our Sacred Maiden Tribe. You must not relax at all. If it can be done, I will ask other elders to help you ask for the name of the Son. It depends on your ability.” Duan Qi said.

As soon as Duan Qi said this, Han Yan couldn’t help raising her head and looked at Duan Qi excitedly.

Son, that is the position just below the elders and maidens in Sacred Maiden Tribe!

There were only a handful of saints in the entire Sacred Maiden Tribe. They were women who have made outstanding contributions to the tribe, or heroes who have bred pure blood saints. Although they do not have the power of the elders and the nobility of the maiden, It had a higher status and preferential treatment than other women. The people would salute when they see the Son, but it was of extremely high treatment.

Even the Holy Land could be entered occasionally. For those like Han Shu, who had no luck with being a saint, this would be their lifelong pursuit.

“Elder Duan, rest assured! I will wait and do my best, and I will never disappoint Elder Duan’s expectations!” Han Yan’s unwavering loyalty, her eyes faintly burned with a flame of greed.

But it’s just a small lad, it’s for the position of the Holy Son, she has to fight!

Duan Qi glanced at the three of them and nodded with satisfaction.
