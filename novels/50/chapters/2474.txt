“Miss Jun.” Bai Yunxian bowed, his attitude was subservient.

The difference between the two ladies were as wide as the clouds and mud, it needed no mentioning that even the determination to compete, Bai Yunxian could not even muster up any pride or confidence.

“Bring me to the prison.” Jun Wu Xie instructed coldly.

“The prison?” Bai Yunxian was a little surprised.

Jun Wuxie had only gotten married yesterday, she attended the wedding ceremony with Mo Xiaoyuan although they did not chat with Jun Wu Xie. This was only the second morning after the big wedding, why would Jun Wu Xie want to go to the prison?

Faced with the cold gaze of Jun Wu Xie, Bai Yunxian did not dared to question further as she obediently replied, “Alright, please follow me.”

Bai Yunxian led the way to the prison.

At this time, a figure was standing in the dungeon and doing something to an unkempt man.

The resounding footsteps made the man stop and turned his head to look. Upon seeing Jun Wu Xie and Bai Yunxian, he was shocked.

“Yin Yan? What are you doing here?” Bai Yunxian was somewhat surprised to see him.

Yin Yan bowed his head and replied, “Xie Changming has lost his mind, and wants to destroy his own ring spirit, so Master Gu asked me to come and see.”

Bai Yunxian nodded, Yin Yan and her were alike as they were once Jun Wu Xie’s opponents. But now, they could only look up to Jun Wu Xie and tamed the turmoil in their hearts.

Within the prison cell, Xie Changming collapsed onto the floor in his muddleheadedness, his clothes were dirty, his hair tangled together like dried hay and the appearance of Jun Wu Xie did not restore his senses. He was gazing at the corner of the cage, his mouth was slightly open as he muttered gibberish.

Jun Wu Xie did not spare him a glance and asked straightforwardly, “Where is Luo Qingcheng?”

“Please follow me.” Bai Yunxian stepped forward and led Jun Wu Xie towards the end of the jail.

It was a sealed cell which only had an opening the width of an arm wide.

Bai Yunxian nodded towards the guard, and he immediately opened the door to the cell.

Inside the cell, twelve candles illuminate the entire room, and the walls, roofs and floors were spliced with bronze mirrors, which was no different from the room where Luo Qingcheng was originally held. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In the bright dungeon cell, there was a disgusting, puke-inducing, sour smell, and the person ensnared within the cell by the Soul Binding chains no longer resembled a human being or even a ghost.

The clothes on the person’s body were utterly filthy that the original colour could not be discerned.

“Slut!” An unrecognizable Luo Qingcheng looked up, her bloodshot eyes glaring at Jun Wu Xie who walked into the cell.

She was detained in this special room, and suffered from a fate worse than death. She opened her eyes every day and saw her badly mutilated face, which caused her more pain than killing her. Her beauty has ceased to exist, and the reflection in the mirror was an ugly, goblin-like face.

Jun Wu Xie didn’t let anyone exert any other criminal law on her. She was just kept in the cell, supplied with water and food, but she could not move, and was only stiffly hung here, could not live a life, neither could she die.

“Bitch! Kill me if you got the guts to! I will haunt you as a ghost!” Luo Qingcheng swore at Jun Wu Xie, as she wished to devour Jun Wu Xie and drink her blood.

If it were not for Jun Wu Xie, why would she have landed in this dire state?

If she only knew that the result of being captured was torture, she would have commited suicide in the battlefield.

“I won’t kill you, you can live safely and well. That’s when you can truly appreciate your current ‘beauty’.” Jun Wu Xie stared coldly at the insane Luo Qingcheng.
