Chapter 2532: The Thought of Murder Had Been Aroused（3）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Many knives gathered and fell, but the feeling of the knives piercing the body did not spread!

The leader of the men dressed in black felt there was something, turned around and said in a low voice, “It’s a trap! Leave!”

But.....

In front of the broken door behind them stood a slender figure. The figure was silhouetted by the moonlight, therefore no one could see the face clearly. But the figure exuded a sense of coldness, blocking the only passage for the men in black to leave!

“Since you’re here, why are you in a hurry to leave?”

A cold, foreboding sound was abruptly heard, like a clash of thunder, which scared the wits out of them!

“Yan Hai?” The leader ventured with uncertainty, the voice sounded familiar but the tone was chilly, something that they had not heard from Yan Hai before.

“Why? You can’t recognise the person whom you want to kill?” The person who stood by the door took a step back, and the moonlight fell upon her body. The moonlight illuminated ‘Yan Hai’ facial features but the cold intent on that face frightened the men.

The leader heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing the face of Jun Wu Xie. This person was clearly ‘Yan Hai’, but with Yan Hai’s strength, how could he have appeared before them without a sound?

Until the soundless appearance of Jun Wu Xie, not one of them realised that someone was close by!

“You didn’t get drugged!” The leader remarked coldly.

Jun Wu Xie quirked her brow, “You actually used that thing on me? Don’t make me laugh.”

“You’re fortunate to avoid death! But you’re sending yourself to death’s door! We won’t give you another chance! Get him!” The leader maintained his composure and they all rushed at Jun Wu Xie.

Even if Jun Wu Xie was still conscious, and even found out about their scheme, so what?

‘Yan Hai’ was just a young man with an above average innate talent. If he was given another ten years, perhaps he would achieve even more. But currently, he was still young and immature, the skill levels of everyone sent on this mission were all above him; hence to kill ‘Yan Hai’ wasn’t a difficult task!

A dozen of black shadows flew uniformly towards Jun Wu Xie, everyone’s body was emanating a golden aura, it was conceivable that these people’s skills were not weak. Although they can’t be compared to those exponents who could condense spiritual inscriptions, but they were tyrannical enough!

However, Jun Wu Xie stood at the same spot unmoving as she looked at her fast approaching killers. A cold light was emitting from within her eyes.

Suddenly!

A ray of purple light suddenly appeared from outside the house!

However, in the blink of an eye, those men in black who rushed towards Jun Wu Xie, were all drawn out by the purple light.

Several screams suddenly rang out in the courtyard!

The leader of the men in black fell heavily on the ground, everything that happened was too just sudden. He didn’t even see how Jun Wu Xie moved and his whole person flew, as scorching pain radiated from his chest. The pain was like getting struck by lightning.

Anguished wailing from his men reached his ears as the leader looked wildly around and discovered that his men were sprawled on the ground, every one of their chests had a burnt, black spot as if struck by lightning!

“Just so so.” A cold voice suddenly spoke.

The leader immediately raised his head and looked to the source of the sound, but that one made him break internally.
