Chapter 2917: Recognizing ‘Father’ (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

At this moment, Bai Mo finally realized what the saying ‘the evil we bring upon ourselves are the hardest to bear’ really meant first hand.

Even if you beat him to death, he would never ever have expected that the person whose thighs he was currently clinging on to, would be the very devil who had troubled him for thousands of years!

Originally, Bai Mo had thought it out very well. He was a strange person but he was extremely focused on one thing. That was, to become strong. Otherwise, he would not have left the good position of the White Night City Lord that year and went to live in seclusion. Anything that prevented him from becoming strong, he would destroy it mercilessly. Correspondingly, anyone who could help him become stronger, he would win by whatever means.

Under the legend of the elixir that was released in the early period before Jun Wu Xie, Bai Mo saw the power of Jun Wu Xie, which also made Bai Mo believe in the rumored elixir. Then he thought to rely on Jun Wu Xie to see if he could earn some elixir.

Knowing that he was not Jun Wu Xie’s opponent, Bai Mo replaced his dead-faced object with the man beside Jun Wu Xie. He could see that the two were close and having lived for thousands of years, Bai Mo naturally knew that some emotions could cross genders, so it was natural to pair “Yan Hai” with this man.

But the result was...

This person wasn’t one he could afford to offend!

“Good son, how did you talk to your father?” Jun Wu Yao crossed his legs, and sat elegantly on the chair beside him. Looking at the frightened Bai Mo with one hand on his chin with a smile.

“Who is your son! I am definitely not!” Bai Mo immediately blew up.

Jun Wu Yao raised his eyebrows slightly: “Was it not you crying and yelling at me calling me “Father”? Why are you denying all that now? Really unfilial.”

“You! You !!!” Bai Mo lived in seclusion for a long time, relying on his own strength. He had always been able to fight without having to talk. He was completely rendered dumb by the barrage of Jun Wu Yao’s words and could not even utter out a complete sentence. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Don’t you know that disobedient children need to be educated?” Jun Wu Yao’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a dangerous smile bloomed on the corner of his lips.

Bai Mo subconsciously took a step back and his eyes were filled with terror as he looked at Jun Wu Xie for help.

“...” Jun Wu Xie hesitated for a moment, wondering why this unlucky child would ask her for help.

“Don’t look at your mother, loving mother spoils son. She won’t save you, come to Dad. Dad will educate you.” Jun Wu Yao raised his hand and ticked toward Bai Mo.

Bai Mo’s legs were frightened, crying with a face and shaking his head.

What iniquity did he make and how did it fall into the hands of such a demon.

What father!

Nonsense!

This guy is shameless!

“You ... don’t come over! I ... I ...” Bai Mo tried to find some threats, but ...

Fight?

He can’t beat him!

Run?

He can’t run away!

Bai Mo’s style seemed nothing special in front of Jun Wu Yao.

He extremely regretted whether he had flooded his brain at that time that he would keep up. He knew that the person around Jun Wu Xie was the demon. Even if he gave him the strength of Dual Spirit Rings, he would never take a step forward.

No way! !!

Jun Wu Yao didn’t even care about Bai Mo’s poor words. With the hook of a finger, Bai Mo flew uncontrollably in front of Jun Wu Yao, his small face was completely scrunched in fear.
