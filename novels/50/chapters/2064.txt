Chapter 2065: Pushing to the Point of Death (4)

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head and without saying anything more, she took out a little awl before started carving into the ground.

That was the awl that Jun Wu Xie has “misappropriated” from the fourth Serene Spirit Tower’s worksite. There seemed to be a certain power of the spirit hidden within the little awl as it didn’t grow blunt with use and was just great for carving out Spirit Reinforcement runes. Having felt that it was very useful, Jun Wu Xie had brought it out from the site.

Nalan Shan and the cheetah looked on quietly at Jun Wu Xie’s actions and they quickly noticed that the runes Jun Wu Xie carved into the ground actually looked so familiar, highly similar to those upon the Serene Spirit Towers.

Jun Wu Xie soon carved out a great big circle of Spirit Reinforcement runes in the ground, and from the width of the circle, it could be seen that it would just be able to contain Brownie’s body.

“This is?” Nalan Shan raised his head to look at Jun Wu Xie in surprise. Those familiar looking runes had made him recall everything back in the Serene Spirit Tower, but he was still not entirely certain.

“Adapted from the Serene Spirit Tower. But rest assured, I have completely modified it and this will not cause a spirit body any harm, but assist the spirit in its cultivation.” After Jun Wu Xie was finished, she kept the little awl away. Although Wu Jiu was definitely not any kind soul, but that little awl was quite a useful little toy.

Nalan Shan looked at Jun Wu Xie, and then looked at the circle formed with Spirit Reinforcement runes, his face staring in pure disbelief.

All the way back when Nalan Shan had discovered there was something strange in the Serene Spirit Tower, he had attempted to unravel the meaning of these runes. But even after several decades had passed, he had still come up with nothing, unable to understand what those runes were used for at all.

But looking at the current state Jun Wu Xie was in, it would seem like she had unraveled everything about it, and Jun Wu Xie’s words had made him think of the sudden and unbelievable advancement of the power of the spirit in Jun Wu Xie and her several companions.

“You gained your powers using this to cultivate?” Nalan Shan’s voice was shaking slightly.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head without hesitation.

Nalan Shan’s body then trembled uncontrollably. If all of this was true, then Jun Wu Xie’s decision here today would definitely bring about a great and important retaliation!

“Com.” Jun Wu Xie said as she beckoned at Brownie. Brownie lumbered over unguardedly and plomped his great behind down into the middle of the circle.

“Cultivate.” Jun Wu Xie then gave Brownie a crisp and curt order.

Brownie blinked its eyes foolishly as it stared at the circle of Spirit Reinforcement runes surrounding it. It looked to its left, and then looked to the right, looking highly curious. After staring at them for a while, it then obediently followed Jun Wu Xie’s order and began to cultivate.

At the moment Brownie began to cultivate, Nalan Shan was surprised to discover that the power of the spirit in the room was surging at an astounding speed towards the Spirit Reinforcement circle, and the Spirit Reinforcement runes carved into the floor were actually giving out a faint glow, where the light felt highly comforting.

The four Beast Spirits were completely stunned by the scene before their eyes. They jumped to their feet in shock, staring the the power of the spirit that was being drawn in by the Spirit Reinforcement runes that surged into Brownie’s body in an incessant stream. Brownie’s fur then seemed to be imbued with the power, waving when there was no wind, clumps of golden light gradually covering over that brown fur!

“How..... How is this possible.....” Nalan Shan’s eyes went wide as he stared, unable to believe everything that he was seeing.

“There is nothing impossible about this.” Jun Wu Xie’s arms were crossed over her chest, as she calmly watched the change that was coming over Brownie. The show was only just beginning.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
