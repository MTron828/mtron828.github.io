At this moment, Qiao Chu and others walked out from behind the hall. When Ruan Zhongshan came, they had all stayed hidden behind the back of the hall and heard everything that Ruan Zhongshan said. Jun Wu Yao had set a barrier up prior to the meeting and it was made in such a way that Ruan Zhongshan could not discover their presence and had no idea that there were people behind that were watching everything.

“I didn’t expect that the moment Ruan Zhongshan made his appearance, he would make our plan proceed so well. Little Xie, do you think that the person hiding in the dark was sent by Ruan Zhongshan?” Fan Zhuo sat down on the chair nearest to him as he asked in curiosity. From the moment Ruan Zhongshan had entered the main hall with his entourage, they had noticed that another presence had sneaked into the main hall and stayed hidden in the dark, watching everything in the main hall from start to the end. It only disappeared soon after Ruan Zhongshan left.

The reason why Jun Wu Xie had a moment of silence after Ruan Zhongshan left was precisely because she discovered the existence of that person.

“No.” Jun Wu Xie shook her head. That person’s breath was very faint. If one didn’t pay extra attention, it would not be easy to detect. He was obviously a master who was good at concealing his own spiritual power. Otherwise, it would not be possible to avoid Ruan Zhongshan’s perception.

“Ruan Zhongshan is quite arrogant. Since he dared to tear off his mask in front of me, he would not go to the extent of sending someone to observe in the dark. I think that person’s appearance may have been an unexpected gain.” The edge of Jun Wu Xie’s lips curled up slightly.

She thought that the bait they released could only catch Ruan Zhongshan, but she did not expect to catch an unexpected harvest.

“Who was that?” Fan Zhuo asked with some confusion. That person had entered and left along with Ruan Zhongshan, it was obvious that he had come together with him. Now that Sea Spirit City was already in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, not to mention that there were the members of the Night Regime everywhere, so how else could a mysterious person appear?

She did not rush to respond to Fan Zhuo’s question but raised her gaze to Ye Mei who walked in from the side.

“What have you found out?”

Ye Mei was responsible for all the movements in the City Lord’s manor. To sneak into the City Lord’s manor, that person would already be under the close surveillance of the Night Regime.

“When that man came, he was masked so we couldn’t see his face clearly. But in terms of his breath, his strength should be of one who is able to condense out spirit inscriptions, but the amount he can condense is only a small amount. He followed Ruan Zhongshan as he entered the manor, so he is unlikely a person from Sea Spirit City.” Ye Mei informed her of his findings. From the moment the man entered the City Lord’s manor, each and every move of his had been intently recorded down by Ye Mei. The reason why he did not take him down was to avoid alerting the enemy.

“Let someone check it out,” Jun Wu Xie said indifferently. If that person was not sent by Ruan Zhongshan, yet his strength was at such a strong level that could condense out spirit inscriptions, it meant that his origin was definitely not simple. If he wasn’t from Long Xuan City, it could only mean that he was a person from other cities. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ye Mei saluted and immediately retreated to arrange everything.

Qiao Chu couldn’t help but ask, “Little Xie, you’re letting Ruan Zhongshan off the hook so easily? That guy’s mouth should be washed thoroughly! He had spoken to such an extent, why aren’t you going to get rid of him since he’s here?”

When Ruan Zhongshan thought he could kill Jun Wu Xie in seconds, he didn’t know that in the eyes of Qiao Chu and the others, a person who could condense out spirit inscriptions at Ruan Zhongshan’s level, all Jun Wu Xie needed was to lift a finger. For Jun Wu Xie who could condense out two Spirit Rings, it was a simple feat to kill Ruan Zhongshan!

Jun Wu Xie shook her head and replied: “It’s not time... yet.”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Chu scratched his head.
