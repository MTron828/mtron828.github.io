3074 The Final Battle 2

The God of Destruction slowly sat up in his chair and raised his hand. Suddenly, an icy blue flame appeared in his palm.

The flame was reflected in his eyes, making him seem even more evil than he already was.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the flame in his hand, it was the same hue as the one that had followed her in the Seven World of Dreams which got bigger as time went by.

“Isn’t this flame beautiful?” The God of Destruction said to nobody in particular, not clear whether he was speaking to himself or to Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

“Do you know what this flame represents? The God of Destruction slowly turned his gaze to them. He was not in a hurry at all, the Blood Sacrifice Array had started and he was merely waiting for it to come to an end. In the meantime, he could spend their last moments with them.

“This is the flame of the gods, it belongs to me and is a part of me.” The God of Destruction laughed and waved his hand, the flame dropped to the ground at the side. In that instant, the flame grew and an unreal figure emerged from it.

It was Gu Ying, standing silently in the hall. His body was transparent, like the ghosts in the ghost realm but right then, he was even more transparent than the ghosts.

The arrogant figure he had cut once was no more and looked so frail that a gust of wind would blow him away. He just stood there, a blue light circling him.

He silently lifted his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie, a series of complex emotions could be seen in his eyes.

“The God of Light and the others were too stubborn, trying desperately to protect this weak world. Everyone in it was created by us and since they were created by us, they should also be destroyed by us. Isn’t the purpose of their existence but to be a showcase of our power?” The God of Destruction laughed once more but it was tempered slightl;y when he looked at Gu Ying.

“If they weren’t so stubborn, I wouldn’t have had to wait till now. I trapped them in the Seven World of Dreams where only a god could enter. Chi Yan and the rest couldn’t go in but even if they did, they would not have managed to get the powers from that lot. Fortunately, you turned up...” The God of Destruction’s gaze fell upon Jun Wu Xie.

“Only you could have made them lower their guard and because of that, my avatar, Gu Ying, could absorb their power. At the end of it all,I do need to thank you. Don’t worry, after this is all over, I will find a rock to carve your name into so that even without a corpse, you have a final destination.” The God of Destruction narrowed his eyes slightly.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
