Chi Yan looked at Jun Wu Yao, and his ink-dyed long hair fluttered in the wind, like a god, like a devil who fell from Nine Heavens. The endless pressure like a god and demon caused Chi Yan and Su Ruiying to shake their hearts violently.

The dark spirit in Jun Wu Yao’s hands exploded in a flash. Heaven and the earth rose in brilliance. As the dark spirits waved down, the brilliance was as if the only eternal light appeared between heaven and earth.

Rumble, Rumble, Rumble! ! !

This loud noise seemed to be out of chaos. In the next second, the mountains turned into powder, the gravel floated in the void, and fell like a rainstorm, piled up into high mountains. At a glance, as if it was connected to heaven and earth, the support pillar of heaven.

Jun Wu Yao was in midair, like the sovereign of the heavens and earth.

“Ye Jue, Ye Jue, you are really strong, beyond imagination ...” Chi Yan raised his mouth slightly, staring at Ye Jue who was stood in the air, and said.

“His whereabouts ... there is only one chance, otherwise, the next time you will turn into powder, it will be you and her.” Jun Wu Yao’s eyes fell on Chi Yan, then he pointed to Su Ruiying.

The only value of these two people in front of Jun Wu Yao was the whereabouts of Jun Wu Xie. Otherwise, Jun Wu Yao would not keep them alive until this time.

“Ye Jue, as I said before, you are indeed very strong and so outrageous, but you ... can’t kill us, or even, you will die here today.” Chi Yan burst into vain in his cold eyes and said.

Hearing what Chi Yan had said, Jun Wu Yao had no expression on his face: “Chi Yan, who gave you the confidence and gave you the courage to talk to me like this?”

“Ha ha, Ye Jue, you are indeed very strong.” At this time, Chi Yan suddenly laughed with a pair of cold and frightening eyes.

“Oh ...” Jun Wu Yao’s interest was completely aroused. The taste of Chi Yan’s words seemed to depend on him. In this case, he also wanted to take a look at what storms Chi Yan would be able to create. .

“You don’t know enough about me ... You don’t even understand the power of His Lord, so Ye Jue, you are very ignorant and funny ...”

Chi Yan raised his lips with a trace of ridicule, strode forward, and Su Ruiying followed behind Chi Yan, carefully watching Jun Wu Yao’s every move.

Above the void, Jun Wu Yao’s indifferent eyes stared at Chi Yan and Su Ruiying.

......

“Su Ruiying, is the spirit energy enough?” Chi Yan suddenly asked.

Su Ruiying was stunned for a moment, and she felt a strange feeling in her heart. She whispered: “Eight out of ten, there was not much loss before.”

“So, is it enough to support the strongest soul in this neighborhood.” Chi Yan asked again.

Su Ruiying thought for a moment, she didn’t expect Chi Yan to want to use it here ... but a moment later, she nodded: “Enough.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Good! Today is Ye Jue’s death!” Chi Yan’s right arm raised, and the void in front of him was rippling. Soon, the naked eye could see that the void was actually torn apart from the torn void. In the middle, a very strange corpse floated out.

The body of this corpse was distorted, the skin on and off was mottled, and the skin color was completely different. Obviously it was not from the same body, it should be stitched from multiple bodies to form a completed body.

That’s ... “Jun Wu Yao looked at Chi Yan and Su Ruiying’s actions, frowning slightly. The behavior of Chi Yan was indeed a little weird. After looking at the spliced ​​corpse, he inadvertently exuded the viciousness that made everything lose its color.
