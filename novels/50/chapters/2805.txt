“Han Shu, you should know what you need to do, do you want me to remind you again?” Duan Qi frowned slightly, her tone becoming harsh.

Han Shu, who had been nit-picking before, trembled. She knelt in front of Duan Qi immediately, her heart was tense. These couple of days, Duan Qi had been slightly relaxed with her and that made her think that she could say anything she wanted. But she had forgotten that under Duan Qi’s arrangement, she could not simply voice her dissatisfaction as she pleased. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Elder Duan please forgive me ...” Han Shu said with a shaking voice.

Duan Qi snorted and looked at Han Xu who was kneeling in front of her, “Thousands of years ago, your sister abandoned the Sacred Maiden Tribe and fled the Upper Realm. How much damage did she bring to the Sacred Maiden Tribe? Unless another Luo Qingcheng emerges in the tribe, you should know how His Lord would blame all of us. But now, Luo Qingcheng’s fate is uncertain, our Sacred Maiden Tribe has continuously made some mistakes in front of His Lord. is uncertain about life and death, my Sacred Maiden Tribe has made mistakes in front of the Lord. Since you were a child, your innate talent was average, and you can’t be compared to your sister Han Zi Fei. You also can’t be compared to Luo Qingcheng. The only thing you can depend on is the bloodline flowing through your veins. That’s why, this time I’ve brought you from the Holy Mountain, to find you a suitable match in order to give birth to the next Sacred Maiden. Do you think that with the current situation, you still have the right to be choosy? If within the next hundred years, you are unable to breed a pureblooded Sacred Maiden, the status of the Sacred Maiden Tribe in the eyes of His Lord will decrease greatly. If you continue to be so foolish, then you are dooming the entire Sacred Maiden Tribe.”

Duan Qi was angered and thus ranted at Han Shu. The other women from the tribe knelt on the ground, their expressions were strange.

The status of the Sacred Maiden Tribe in the Upper Realm was noble, but this was based on the premise that they had a pureblooded Sacred Maiden.

And for a pureblooded Sacred Maiden to appear among people was rare. In the thousands of years of history of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, there had only been three pureblooded Sacred Maidens. And because of their existence, it gave the Sacred Maiden Tribe the status they possessed today.

But...

After the deaths of the first two Sacred Maidens, the Sacred Maiden Tribe had hoped for a new pureblood Sacred Maiden for thousands of years and they finally had one. But that Sacred Maiden chose to abandon the tribe, and fled from His Lord’s side. This put the Sacred Maiden Tribe between a rock and a hard place. After that, the tribe barely managed to purify their bloodline. The talented Luo Qingcheng managed to gain a foothold in the Upper Realm, but Luo Qingcheng had left for the Lower Realm not too long ago and her fate was still unknown.

One step forward, two steps back. The Sacred Maiden Tribe could barely get a pureblooded Sacred Maiden. And if they continue in this manner, the tribe will soon lose their noble status.

This was unacceptable to Duan Qi, so when Gu Ying sent an invitation to Duan Qi, Duan Qi acquiesced to all of this. The Sacred Maiden Tribe needed fresh bloodlines, and the women who were of childbearing age were brought along with her to Sea Spirit City. Their sole purpose was to find outstanding men in the Upper Realm to conceive a new batch of children in order to find the next Sacred Maiden.
