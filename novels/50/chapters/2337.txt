For a moment, everyone in the hall stood up, their gazes were hot as they all inevitably landed on Mu Qian Fan and they seemed to have thousands of questions.

Jun Xian trembled as he stood up, holding the table with one hand and not letting himself fall. He quivered and looked at Mu Qian Fan: “Is she back? Little Xie... she...”

“Grandfather.”

Suddenly, a voice that had a tinge of chill in it was introduced into everyone’s ears and it was like a thunder clap that made everyone dazed.

The eyes of all the people looked at the source of the sound in an instant.

Jun Wu Xie stood in front of the main hall of the Lin Palace. Through the passage of time, the young girl had grown into a heroic and cool woman.

Jun Xian slightly opened his mouth, his lips could not stop trembling, the eyes reflecting the vicissitudes of life was looking at his beloved granddaughter.

“Granddaughter greets Grandfather.” Jun Wu Xie stepped forward as she got down on one knee and knelt in front of Jun Xian.

Jun Xian stretched out his trembling hand and reached out for her shoulder. He suddenly looked up and slapped it hard onto her shoulder.

The sound echoed in the hall, and it was so loud that Qu Ling Yue could not help but want to step forward, but Lei Chen pulled her sleeves and shook his head silently.

“Do you still know how to come back?” Jun Xian’s stern voice reverberated throughout.

“Do you still know how to come back! Do you not want Lin Palace anymore? Do you not want your grandfather and uncle anymore?” The hand that Jun Xian used to slap her was raised once again, but could not fall when he saw her looking back at him in silence. Jun Xian could not help but shed tears and fell into the chair.

“Five years, why have you... only come back now!” Jun Xian had his head down and his low and quivering voice was introduced into everyone’s ears, making everyone’s eyes red.

Five years of waiting, even if they all believed that she was still alive but over this 1800 days and nights, who could sleep peacefully for a night?

Were they not awakened by a nightmare every night?

Did they not pass a day painfully by everyday riddled with fear?

They were afraid that they would receive the news that they least wanted to hear.

Jun Wu Xie remained kneeling on the ground with her head slightly lowered and her gaze that was lowered could not help but revealed a trace of bitterness in them.

“Little Xie, aren’t you going to give your grandfather a cup of apology tea?” Jun Qing’s hoarse voice sounded beside her as he picked up the tea cup on the table and put it in her hands.

Jun Wu Xie’s hand held the blue and white porcelain cup in her hand and the temperature of the tea was slightly transmitted through the porcelain cup to her. It was slightly warm, but it was directly transferred from her fingertips straight to her heart.

“Grandfather...” Jun Wu Xie raised her head, she had obviously been cold for so many years and had endured everything on her own for so many years, but when she looked up and saw the teary faced Jun Xian, she felt as though her heart was being grasped tightly by someone and twisted it so hard that her face turned ashened with pain.

Her grandfather, the former Duke Lin of the Qi Kingdom, the founder of the Rui Lin Army and better known as a legendary War God. Yet, merely a few years had passed but in this short period of time, the wrinkles in his eyes had deepened and his head of black and white hair had now been turned completely into a full head of silver, and each strand was like a silver needle, stabbing into the heart of Jun Wu Xie.

“Grandfather...I’m sorry...” Jun Wu Xie choked on her words as she picked up the teacup in her hand and presented it to Jun Xian.

Jun Xian took a deep breath, looked at Jun Jun Wu Xie and said: “I know that you have always had your own ideas that is why your uncle and I have never asked. But the least you could do is let us know that you are safe and sound!”
