Chapter 261: “Twelve Peaks (3)”

When the final test started, most of the youths gave it everything they had, wishing they could show off everything they’ve learnt all their lives to the Qing Yun Clan’s Sovereign and Elders. Some recited from medical classics, some pointed out the various acupressure points on paintings of the human body they had brought along, and some presented elixirs that they had supposedly concocted themselves.....

There were all kinds of presentations, made in many varied ways. Very soon, it became just like a fish market.

Jun Wu Xie had not rushed to react from the start, and only watched quietly as the youths turned the final assessment into a circus as they tried their hardest to present themselves in the best light possible.

Qin Yue and the others frowned, and as the situation got more and more rowdy, the frowns on their faces grew deeper and deeper.

“What a fracus! Do not get me involved in things like this ever again. If there are any that catches your eye, bring them back with you, and get the rest off the mountain.” Qin Yue could not stand to see anymore of the childish behaviours and the absence of talents among them, and stormed off in a huff.

Qin Yue was usually absent from the monthly recruitment on the fifteenth of each month, and came infrequently just to watch. And every time that he came, he had always stormed off like he did today.

Mu Chen watched with cold eyes as Qin Yue left, a sneer at the corners of his mouth.

Qin Yue was as diplomatic as he always was. The good ones among the applicants had already been spotted by Qin Yue before they even entered the mountain and secretly brought within the Qing Yun Clan. He would not have any interest in these ‘leftover’ applicants here,and was rushing back to see and assess his new recruits.

The show he put up today here, was for the benefit of the Elders.

Mu Chen turned his eyes back to the front and looked at the applicants with neither pity nor compassion.

It was not their fault that the youths were blinded by their enthusiasm and exuberance, but it became their fault if they were blinded by it and did not use their brains, showing the lack of intelligence. These youths are just anxious to show off, without knowing what the Qing Yun Clan was looking for.

Just as Mu Chen was losing interest as well, he noticed something interesting.

A tiny petite figure was standing in the midst of the crowd, observing everyone around him with a cold stare, looking as if he wanted nothing to do with this crowd. The chill emanating from those eyes, did not seem fitting on someone of such a tender age.

For no apparent reason, Mu Chen found his interest stoked. Maybe it was the cold personality, or it might be the eyes, but they all just made Mu Chen feel, that that petite youth was different from the others.

As if the youth had felt his gaze, the youth raised his head and looked Mu Chen straight into his eyes and weaved his way out of the crowd in the direction towards Mu Chen.

Mu Chen watched the petite youth as he approached from far, but otherwise made no other move.

Several Qing Yun Clan disciples saw Jun Wu Xie walk out from the crowd and continued to approach closer to the Elders. They immediately stepped up and moved to stop the youth from getting any closer.

“The assessment has not ended, and you are not allowed to move freely within the Qing Yun Clan.” A lad looking to be in his early twenties frowned and looked at the petite Jun Wu Xie. ‘This youth was rather bold to dare approach the Elders!’

This had happened many times before, but it was usually resolved when the Qing Yun Clan disciples threw a word of warning, and the offender had always backed off.

But Jun Wu Xie had no intention of backing off. When she was stopped, she stood her ground and raised her head. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I’m sorry! We’ll take our leave immediately!” Qiao Chu, who had followed behind Jun Wu Xie, noticed the gradually darkening faces of the Qing Yun Clan disciples and had shot forward to stand beside Jun Wu Xie, trying to pull her back while he persuaded.
