Zi Fei looked astonishingly at Jun Wu Xie.

“You father?”

Jun Wu Xie slightly nodded. “Although I have never seen him, I could vaguely tell that he’s probably in the Upper Realm. I want... to find him.”

Where did the soul of Jun Gu go would always be the load on both the minds of Jun Xian and Jun Qing. Except for the sake of herself and Jun Wu Yao, the purpose of Jun Wu Xie going to the Upper Realm this time was to find out whether there would be the soul of Jun Gu in the Soul World, and maybe... she was also able to find the souls of Ren Huang and Yan Bu Gui...

“You have never seen him before?” The puzzlement in Zi Fei’s eyes became deeper.

“Yeah, he was already gone when I was born,” replied Jun Wu Xie.

With the gaze in her eyes suddenly turning soft, subconsciously, Zi Fei lifted her hand up and patted on Jun Wu Xie’s head. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The warm palm covered on Jun Wu Xie’s head wasn’t as potent as Jun Wu Yao’s. Instead, it belonged to the tenderness and softness of a woman.

“You will find him. As long as he’s in the Upper Realm, you will surely find him. He must be really happy if he knows that you’re searching for him.”

A warm sensation welled up in Jun Wu Xie’s heart. It was an indescribable and subtle feeling which she had never experienced before, slightly warm but with a little sorrow in it.

The voice of Zi Fei became very gentle. While moving her eyes onto Qiao Chu not far away from them who was rolling here and there together with the little Sea Spirit Beasts, something flashed across the bottom of her eyes.

“There isn’t any parents who are reluctant to leave their child alone. No matter what the reason is, there must be some difficulties causing them to have no alternative but choose to leave... Maybe there will be one day... where my child too... will come and find me... Sigh...” Zi Fei suddenly stopped her words, seemingly to recall of something, causing her words to come to a halt.

“You... have a child?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Zi Fei in shock. She had never seen the face features of Zi Fei as her face was being covered by the mask all the time with only a pair of eyes exposing in the air, but just by looking at her figure and her body, Zi Fei should be very young.

“Do I not look like someone who has a child? I’m more than two thousand years old.” Zi Fei let out a small laugh.

“Your child is also in the Upper Realm?” asked Jun Wu Xie.

But Zi Fei shook her head.

“Nope, she’s not. I’m glad that she wasn’t born in such a cruel place. It was not that I’ve been staying here for the whole time after I left the Upper Realm. I had gone to all the places in the Three Realms too... It’s just that at the end... I have still gotten back here...” There was a trace of anguish in Zi Fei’s eyes. If her child was able to grow up safely, she would probably be similar in age as Jun Wu Xie. Same as Jun Wu Xie, she might also have grown up into a beautiful and graceful woman... She wouldn’t know whether if her child was married... Or was she doing well in her life...

She always tried to imagine the appearance of her child in her countless night of dream, but as the time passed day by day, she wasn’t even able to imagine how would her child look like as she grew. Was she happy? Had she ever missed her mother?

Suddenly, Zi Fei realized why she treated Jun Wu Xie so differently. It was probably because of the age of Jun Wu Xie which was similar to the age of her child, leading her in subconsciously thinking of Jun Wu Xie as her child.

“She will come to find you,” said Jun Wu Xie.

Zi Fei shook her head.

“She won’t. To her, I was already a dead person. Furthermore, I don’t want her to come. It’s too dangerous here. The only thing I wish is for her to grow up safely with no worries. As long as she’s good, I’m good.”

Jun Wu Xie did not speak. She had never interacted with her mother before. She didn’t know how to console Zi Fei.
