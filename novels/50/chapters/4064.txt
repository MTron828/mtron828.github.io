“Boss, what do you mean?”

Xu Zu let out a sneer.

“I won’t believe that an idiot is capable of taking Yan Wan down. There’s no way he wouldn’t know how huge the consequences is to discontinue the provision of the Sea Spirit Beast, but he still had the guts to speak such presumptuous words. There’s definitely something hidden in his hand.”

Although Xu Zu was arrogant and imperious, he had been working beside the City Lord of the Long Xuan City for a long time, and he was certainly not some kind of moron. The wild and insolent words of Jun Wu Xie had, indeed, gotten him mad to the point that he almost coughed blood out, but after he calmed himself down and gave a thought about it, he realized that it was such an overly extreme decision to be made, causing him to suspect that Jun Wu Xie might be secretly planning to do something behind the scene.

With such a plan in his mind, Xu Zu and his people didn’t hurry themselves to leave the Sea Spirit City. Though Jun Wu Xie had requested them to leave, there shouldn’t be a big problem for them to stay for one or two days longer. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After returning to their lodging, Xu Zu had immediately asked his people to find him some residents of the Sea Spirit City who had strong cupidity with weak personality.

Due to the rules of the Upper Realm, there basically wasn’t any sense of belonging and feeling of honor in the residents of the seventy-two cities. They respected their City Lords because they held them in awe, but that didn’t mean they would always be loyal to only one city. Every city had a really huge floating population. If there was a talented expert in a low ranking city, it was usually hard to get him or her stay at the particular city as most of them would choose to settle themselves down in a city which was more powerful.

Hence, Xu Zu didn’t think that there was anything wrong about the fact of him spending some money to get information from the residents of the Sea Spirit City.

The people from the Long Xuan City immediately headed to the slums of the Sea Spirit City, where most of the people with the weakest strength and lowest status in the city lived.

They had found more than ten people, and had brought them to Xu Zu by separating them into two batches.

Just as the moment Xu Zu took a medicine pill to stabilize his heart meridian which had been injured by Jun Wu Xie, he saw his subordinates leading two men who were wearing dirty, ragged clothes behind them as they walked into the room.

Brows furrowed, Xu Zu looked up and down at the two men. There were patches on most parts of their clothes, and their faces were so grey that it seemed like they had not washed themselves since an unmeasured time. Although they had tall stature, Xu Zu could tell that both the two people were living in the lowest position in the city just by looking at their hunched backs and shrinking shoulders.

During the normal days, Xu Zu wouldn’t even want to cast a glance at people like these, but now, for the sake of disclosing the secrets of the Sea Spirit City, he could only hold his annoyance back and talk to them. Instead of speaking any nonsense, he straight off threw a pouch of coins on the table, causing a solid brisk clinking sound to be heard.

The moment the two anaemic men heard the clinking sound of the coins, their eyes immediately lit up, staring avariciously at the table.

A trace of scorn flashed across the bottom of Xu Zu’s eyes, “The purpose I find both of you today is that I have something to ask you. If you guys answer my questions nicely, the coins on the table will be yours.”

There wasn’t any need for the strong ones in the Upper Realm to own any wealth as their fists were already enough to get them everything they wanted, but for those weaker ones, money was something that could get them fed.

“Yes yes yes, please ask your questions, Lord.” After using some time to finally move their eyes away from those money, both the two men nodded their heads repetitively in eagerness, not to mention how fawning their expressions were.

Xu Zu had seen expression like this numerous times, of course he wouldn’t care much about it.

“Do you guys know that the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City has been changed?” asked Xu Zu.

“Sure, the Young Master killed Yan Wan and he is the City Lord now,” answered one of them quickly.
