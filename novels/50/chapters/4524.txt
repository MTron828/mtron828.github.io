Chapter 3120 Xiao Xie 4

Father....father....father....

Those two words nauseated Shen Yan Xiao. As she looked at Jun Mo Ye’s exquisite face, she saw shades of both Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

Shen Yan Xiao clutched her chest and had trouble breathing. She pointed at Jun Wu Yao, turned back to face Jun Wu Xie and said, “Little Wu Xie....you couldn’t have...”

Jun Wu Xie nodded silently, feeling some pity for her overwhelmed sister.

Shen Yan Xiao staggered back in shock and fell into a deep silence.

Di Xiu, standing behind her, was surprised as well but had a much calmer reaction than Shen Yan Xiao. He looked up at the enemy who had fought against him for many years and could not see any more evil in that pair of violet eyes. All he could see were loving eyes looking at Jun Wu Xie as if she was the only person in the world.

Di Xiu knew that that look meant.

“It can’t be!” Shen Yan Xiao grabbed Jun Wu Xie by the shoulders and said, “Little Wu Xie, do you know who he is? He’s an evil man who almost destroyed a whole world!”

Jun Wu Xie laughed bitterly as she looked at her good friend and helplessly looked towards the so-called evil man.

Jun Wu Yao raised both his hands to protest his innocence to his wife.

“Xiao Xiao....” Jun Wu Xie tried to speak.

However...

“He must have tricked you!” Shen Yan Xiao asserted.

“....” Jun Wu Xie was at a loss for words and could only look at Jun Wu Yao with an expression that only both of them knew.

Jun Wu Yao’s head was beginning to hurt. His wife’s expression meant that he should be cleaning up his own mess but he felt so maligned as the deeds from his previous life had nothing to do with him, even though Shen Yan Xiao disagreed.

“What’s going on?” The confused look on Qiao Chen’s face said it all, in addition to the chaotic scene in front of him, these strangers also had mystical golden glows.

Hua Yao and the others were just as confused.

Jun Mo Ye went over to Jun Wu Yao’s leg, pulled on his trouser leg and said, “Father, hug.”

Jun Wu Yao bent down and picked his daughter up, all the while being watched by Shen Yan Xiao’s wary eyes.

Despite her young age, Little Mo Ye could tell that the beautiful lady in front of her did not seem to like her father and furthermore, by standing in front of her mother, prevented her from getting a hug from her. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The aggrieved Little Mo Ye pointed a stubby little finger at the strange lady and said, “Naughty!”

“.....” Shen Yan Xiao was frozen to the spot.

Although she did not like Satan, she had great affection for Jun Wu Xie and consequently, her offspring. But to be despised by her after only one meeting was a great setback for her!

Her whole being just wilted.

“You’re not allowed to call my mother bad!” Suddenly, a green glow and a handsome boy appeared in front of Shen Yan Xiao, staring at Jun Mo Ye who was in her father’s arms.
