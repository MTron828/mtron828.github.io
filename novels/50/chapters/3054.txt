“But, Highness Ying and the rest...” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“They naturally went where they should go.” Chi Yan’s impatient opening, his slightly furrowed brows already showed his impatience.

Su Ruiying didn’t dare to keep asking, but the doubts in her heart were still unsolved.

Gu Xin Yan, who had been stunned all the time, gave a strange look at this moment. She was the person brought by Gu Ying. But now Gu Ying has disappeared. What was she going to do?

However, Gu Xin Yan was very clear that in front of Chi Yan, her humble strength had no effect at all. She almost looked subconsciously to Jun Wu Yao, who was brought by Jun Wu Xie. She did not know what the other party would do.

Almost at the moment when Gu Xin Yan looked at Jun Wu Yao, Jun Wu Yao suddenly took a step and walked towards Chi Yan.

Chi Yan didn’t look at Jun Wu Yao at all. But Qin Qi, who was standing beside Chi Yan, saw Jun Wu Yao approaching near. He couldn’t help but raise his head and stepped forward, blocking Jun Wu Yao’s way.

“You lowly servant, who allowed you to be close to Lord Chi Yan?” Qin Qi said proudly, watching Jun Wu Yao’s eyes full of contempt.

Before Jun Wu Xie’s cold pride towards Qin Qi, Qin Qi hated him. But he was not Jun Wu Xie’s opponent at all. Even though Chi Yan supported him, he did not dare to really conflict with Jun Wu Xie. But now it’s different.

Jun Wu Xie was no longer present. Qin Qi could use Jun Wu Xie’s follower to vent his anger. Anyway, even if he killed Jun Wu Xie’s follower, Qin Qi was naturally fearless with Chi Yan beside him if Jun Wu Xie asked about it.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Qin Qi with cold eyes. Only one glance, Qin Qi’s sweat all stood up in an instant with an inexplicable fear filled Qin Qi’s heart instantly.

This fear made Qin Qi hairy. Where could he think of it? A seemingly ordinary follower would have such terrifying looks.

“What are you looking at? Do you want to die?” Qin Qi couldn’t believe he would be scared by a follower, and he just held up a tough attitude and looked at Jun Wu Yao with fierceness.

“Don’t think that you can be brave with Yan Hai’s backing. Now that your lord is gone, I want to kill you, just like killing a dog ...”

The insult from Qin Qi was not done yet. The voice came to an abrupt halt in an instant. The red blood spattered out and the thick bloody smell filled everyone’s nose.

Su Ruiying, who was standing on the side, widened her eyes incredulously, and looked at the man who unscrewed Qin Qi’s head from his neck with one hand. In the blood curtain, the man’s figure seemed to be transformed into a ghost in an instant. There was no peace in the past.

The sudden killing made everyone shocked. But it was Chi Yan who did not expect that the follower beside Jun Wu Xie, who didn’t look inconspicuous, killed Qin Qi as soon as he struck. And he did it in front of him and he didn’t even have a chance to stop.

“Tell me, where is he?” Jun Wu Yao narrowed his eyes slightly, suppressing the killing heart for a long time to wake up again under the baptism of blood. He watched Jun Wu Xie disappear before him. The confusion in his heart at that moment had shattered his last calmness. The reason why he would wait until now is to wait for Chi Yan to give an answer.
