Jun Wu Xie’s words not only had gotten Xie Chang Ming triggered, it had also made Qiao Chu and the others who were standing beside her to almost laugh out loud.

Jun Wu Xie actually had the mood to make a joke at this moment?

How fascinating!

The nervous vibe which was first wandering around everyone just disappeared because of the words spoke out by Jun Wu Xie. Even the members of the Night Regime who were keeping a straight expression all the time too, had shown a trace of smile on their faces after listening to the words of their Young Miss.

Who cared if it was the Upper Realm?

Did they really think that their Young Miss would be afraid of them!

“You, this little bitch! Full of nonsense! Just watch, I’m going to pull all your teeth out!” Xie Chang Ming was so angry that he almost wanted to rush forward and slash Jun Wu Xie but Wei Ya stopped him with his hand. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ferociously, Xie Chang Ming roared. “Wei Ya! Why are you blocking me! Let me go and kill this rash little bitch!”

Wei Ya slightly frowned. His eyes were not on Jun Wu Xie. Instead, he was looking at the back of Luo Qingcheng, seemingly to imply something to Xie Chang Ming. Xie Chang Ming immediately noticed Wei Ya’s sight and he then held his anger back.

Luo Qingcheng had earlier given them her order, that the life of Jun Wu Xie belonged to her!

At this moment, the atmosphere around Luo Qingcheng was filled with killing intent. All the eyes of the people from the Upper Realm were focusing on Luo Qingcheng. Just one word from Luo Qingcheng and they would immediately be out in force.

“Are you done now? I thought that you would have some improvements in these five years, but the only thing that had been improved was just your skill of talking.” Luo Qingcheng sneered. While looking at Jun Wu Xie, she suddenly raised her hand and pointed at the army behind her. According to the direction Luo Qingcheng’s finger pointed at, the army of the Upper Realm quickly moved themselves and opened a path with the strictly locked carriage placing at the end.

“You asked me to bring Ye Jue here because you want to save him, right? He is in the carriage now. Take him away if you have the ability to do so.” The anger in Luo Qingcheng had been raging to the extreme, causing her to act the opposite way by staying calm. With a smile hanging on the corners of her lips, she stared at Jun Wu Xie.

The second Jun Wu Xie’s eyes came into contact with the carriage, a trace of coldness flashed across her eyes and Luo Qingcheng didn’t failed to catch the slight change of hers.

“Oh? You seem to value Ye Jue very much. Well, of course you do, since he surrendered himself with his own will during that time just to protect you. Not only him, didn’t Ren Huang too, choose to explode himself to save you? Jun Wu Xie, you are really lucky. Exactly how many lives were sacrificed to keep you alive? It’s just that we do not know if you are that lucky today, or is it that the people you brought are actually used to protect you at the very end so that you are able to run for your life like a beaten dog?” The voice of Luo Qingcheng was so vicious, as if there was venom dripping out from her voice.

Was it necessary for her to get angry because of a person who was going to die?

Was it not because she wanted to admire the tragic way Jun Wu Xie die that she came to the Lower Realm?

The pair of Jun Wu Xie’s eyes slightly narrowed with the coldness in her eyes getting denser.

Luo Qingcheng’s words were like a sharp blade, cutting abruptly through the wound of Jun Wu Xie which wasn’t fully healed yet and exposing the bloody wound in front of everyone. This was the memory that Jun Wu Xie didn’t want to recall the most after her rebirth.

And this time, for real, Qiao Chu and the rest of them burst with wrath!

It was almost with just a blink of an eye and Qiao Chu and the others had already called their ring spirits out and taken out their weapons. There was gold spirit light floating around them!

During the five years of cultivation, five of them had forced themselves to go beyond their limits to finally achieve the level of a Gold Spirit, just for them to be able to get up and stand in front of Jun Wu Xie when somebody disdained her one day!
