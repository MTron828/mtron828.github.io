“City Lord.” Zheng Weilong looked at Jun Wu Xie as she trembled with her words.

Upon hearing that, Dongfang Ku Bi laughed. He immediately stopped laughing and quickly got up from his chair. He stopped to look at Jun Wu Xie with his eyes full of worship.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at the three of them. The moment she saw Ah Da, she knew that the news on the battlefield had just reached Zheng Weilong’s ears.

“Stay in the Sea Spirit City for a few days.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Dongfang Ku Bi and said.

Dongfang Ku Bi nodded his head without saying a word.

Not to mention letting him stay in Sea Spirit City for a few days, even if he was to spend his whole life, he was most willing to do so!

Clinging onto Jun Wu Xie, he can almost imagine his sidewalk in the Upper Realm in the future! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zheng Weilong looked at Jun Wu Xie and did not speak again. But a smile appeared in her heart. Jun Wu Xie let Dongfang Ku Bi stay in the Sea Spirit City for a few days, this meant that he wanted to protect Dongfang Ku Bi. Afterall, 72 cities had been defeated. Who knows whether they will bow down or to create trouble. Everyone knows that Dongfang Ku Bi was Jun Wu Xie’s first supporter. Sea Spirit City was Dongfang Ku Bi safest choice.

“Anything else?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Dongfang Ku Bi and Zheng Weilong shook their heads.

Then Jun Wu Xie walked towards the backyard step by step. Dongfang Ku Bi didn’t dare to ask Jun Wu Xie further. They could pull Qiao Chu aside and ask them all.

Jun Wu Yao returned to the room with Jun Wu Xie. When the door was closed, the expressionless Jun Wu Xie frowned and sat directly on the side chair, looking a little ugly.

“The first time you used the power of the Dual Spirit Ring and created so much trouble, you really are not afraid of death.” Jun Wu Yao glanced at Jun Wu Xie. Although he said so in his mouth, he naturally took her out of the chair and held her in his arms. He slowly imbued his dark spirit energy into her.

“Somewhat uncomfortable.” Jun Wu Xie leaned on Jun Wu Yao’s arms. Her brows were lightly frowned. Once the power of the Dual Spirit Ring was used, all her spiritual and soul powers in her body would be used up. The sudden surge of power made her uncomfortable.

“Although you want to scare away the 72 cities, you don’t have to embarrass yourself so much, just release the Dual Spirit Ring, and they should retreat.” Jun Wu Yao chuckled, but there was a hint of light in his pitiful eyes.

Little Xie’s temperament was too stubborn. Her Dual Spirit Rings had been integrated since the Spirit Tree was nursed. As far as the time she was controlling a little short, it was magnificent and imposing. But few people knew that she had used so much power for the first time, which was also a burden for her.

“If not, how would they be afraid?” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes. If things weren’t bad, how could the Lords of the 72 cities surrender. How would they draw the attention of The Lord?

Jun Wu Yao chuckled a little. Although he told her a few words, it didn’t stop her. Jun Wu Xie wanted to save his father. How could she stop him? How could he stop her?

“Nothing, you have scared them this time. Sea Spirit City will be peaceful and calm in the next few days. You just wait. 72 cities will not easily surrender. Recuperate first and fight them once and for all. They will be obedient then. “Jun Wu Yao smiled.
