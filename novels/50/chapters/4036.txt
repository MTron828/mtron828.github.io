Jun Wu Xie was slightly shocked.

“I heard the voice of the Spirit Tree.” Jun Wu Xie raised her head. At that last moment, if it was not for the power the Spirit Tree had lent her, she was afraid that she could not get close to the Soul Ascending Altar.

Jun Wu Yao held her tighter in his arms. Jun Wu Xie’s soul was a little weak. Although Jun Wu Yao hugged her tighter, he did not use much strength. He whispered: “I know, the seed in your body is still too young, and it is not enough to counter the power of the Soul Sacrifice Array. But it is a medium through which the Spirit Tree can send power to your soul.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded in agreement and asked about the condition of Drunk Lotus and the other Wood Spirits. Jun Wu Yao asked that after the Soul Ascending Altar was destroyed, they were immediately taken back into Jun Wu Xie’s soul. Even with the help of the Spirit Tree, destroying the Soul Sacrifice Array Array was too taxing on Jun Wu Xie, hence Drunk Lotus and the others returned back into Jun Wu Xie’s soul at the first instance, using themselves to bolster Jun Wu Xie’s soul gently.

This was also the unique power of the Wood Spirit, although the effect was very small, but for Jun Wu Xie who had just experienced immense wear and tear, it was tantamount to helping her soul in a great time of need.

“I will take you to see the Spirit Tree.” Jun Wu Yao lifted Jun Wu Xie. When the power of Soul Sacrifice Array Array dissipated, Jun Wu Yao immediately rushed to the top of the mountain and what he saw in front of him was an unconscious Jun Wu Xie, lying on the body of Little Black, and Little Black was very exhausted as well, but it was working hard to hold on to its last thread of consciousness. The moment it saw Jun Wu Yao, it returned back to its little black cat form.

There was no strength left in Jun Wu Xie and she could only lie in Jun Wu Yao’s arms. Although her soul was weak, her heart was bright. No matter what, they foiled the plan of the Upper Realm. If the Upper Realm was allowed to succeed, then it would be a disaster for the Three Realms.

Walking down from the top of the Soul Mountain, all the soldiers from the Upper Realm were everywhere. The closer they were when the Soul Sacrifice Array Array was activated, the more obvious the impact on them was. They were all human souls who entered the Reincarnation Path. They had already used a special method to enter the Soul World, they were not like the original Spirit Envoys of the Soul World; they had become accustomed to the fluctuations of the soul. Even if the Soul Sacrifice Array Array was destroyed today, the previous influence still lingered as the soldiers fell to the ground, one by one, twitching with no energy to move even a finger.

However, at this moment, Jun Wu Xie couldn’t be bothered about the condition of the soldiers. The Soul Sacrifice Array has been destroyed, and the Soul World would be returned into the hands of the Spirit Tree again. Jun Wu Xie need not be involved with these people from the Upper Realm again; the Spirit Envoys would be enough......... to handle them.

Qin Song and other people, who were previously unable to move due to the Soul Sacrifice Array, were already standing by the foot of the Soul Mountain. They were preparing to ascend the mountain, but when they saw Jun Wu Yao carrying Jun Wu Xie down the mountain, Long Jiu and him ran up and greeted them in the first instance.

“How was it?” Qin Song was nervously watching Jun Wu Yao, his gaze glimmered and trembled as it touched Jun Wu Xie who laid weak within Jun Wu Yao’s embrace. He moved his gaze away without a trace of lingering, as he tried not to think of something that was not his...

“The Soul Sacrifice Array has been destroyed, and the Soul World is temporarily safe.” Jun Wu Yao said lightly, but the meaning within his words did not make Qin Song and the rest feel relaxed.

He said it was temporary, not permanent.

The meaning of these words, how could Qin Song not understand?
