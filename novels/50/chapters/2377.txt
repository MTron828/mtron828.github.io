Situ Heng’s words had caused everyone in the room to change their expressions instantaneously. With one accord, the generals of the Rui Lin Army looked at the Spirit Lord with full of puzzlement and astonishment in their eyes.

They had been staying in the Spirit World for five years and they had also interacted with the Spirit Lord for quite some time. They knew about the personality of the Spirit Lord. Besides, the Spirit World was indebted to Jun Wu Xie. Why would the Spirit Lord want to harm his benefactor?

“There must be some misunderstanding. I believe that the Spirit Lord will never do something harmful to Young Miss,” One of the generals of the Rui Lin Army said.

Situ Heng then refuted with disapproval. “Maybe. No one has ever used this kind of method, even the Spirit Lord himself had said before that he wasn’t able to make sure of the feasibility of the method. Maybe he is genuinely thinking of wanting to help your Young Miss, but the outcome...”

Though Situ Heng didn’t finish his words, everyone knew exactly what he meant.

Maybe the Spirit Lord never had the intention to harm Jun Wu Xie, but nobody was certain that if there was any mishap happened during the process of her treatment.

“Qin Song, Long Jiu, both of you were also there when the Spirit Lord mentioned about the method of treatment. Did he not say that he wasn’t sure about using this method?” Situ Heng suddenly raised his eyes and looked at Qin Song and Long Jiu who were at the side.

The expression on Qin Song’s face changed slightly, whereas a trace of panic was shown on the face of Long Jiu.

Nobody would know that things would actually develop into this situation today. Situ Heng’s words made them feel uncomfortable, but... all the things he pointed out were real. At that moment, Long Jiu who was going to defend the Spirit Lord, too, didn’t know what to say.

The atmosphere in the room became extremely strange. The generals of the Rui Lin Army were all staring at the Spirit Lord, seemingly to wait for him to voice his conclusion.

Situ Heng crossed his arms on his chest, looking at the Spirit Lord with a mirthless smile. He was very satisfied with the situation which was slowly getting into chaos.

Under the watchful eyes of everyone, the Spirit Lord held a serious expression on his face. After hesitating for a while, he finally said. “What Situ Heng said is true. It’s true that I’m not fully confident that whether the method was going to work.”

As the words came out from his mouth, everyone’s expression changed suddenly!

“Spirit Lord... How could you...” The generals of the Rui Lin Army looked at the Spirit Lord in disbelief. They never thought that the Spirit Lord would do anything that might harm Jun Wu Xie. Yet, just by looking at the condition of Jun Wu Xie now, if all of these were really caused by the Spirit Lord...

Then perhaps the cooperation between the Lower Realm and the Spirit World would come to an end.

The significance of Jun Wu Xie to the Lower Realm was a self-evident fact. She was someone that they could only expect to meet by chance, but not by force. No matter who was the one to hurt her, the person would definitely become the enemy of the Lower Realm.

Moreover, after five years of not having her news, the return of Jun Wu Xie was so precious to all the people in the Lower Realm. How could they bear the loss of Jun Wu Xie because of an accident?

Whatever the starting point of the Spirit Lord, once Jun Wu Xie died in his hands, the Lower Realm and the Spirit World would immediately turn from allies into deadly enemies!

Every person in the room was surrounded with a weird vibe. Even Qiao Chu and the others were looking really nervous. They couldn’t actually believe that Jun Wu Xie’s current condition was all due to the Spirit Lord, but the moment they looked at Jun Wu Xie who was lying on the bed, all of these were so real...

While watching the atmosphere of the situation with satisfaction, Situ Heng suddenly changed his gaze and glared sharply at the Spirit Lord. “Spirit Lord, don’t you think that you should give an explanation for the sin you did?”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
