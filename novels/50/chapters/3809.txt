The entire army of the Upper Realm was thrown into chaos as everyone started to panic with the occurrence of the sudden nightmare.

Even though they were from the Upper Realm, but they have never seen such a terrible behemoth that was so elusive!

“What the hell are those things?!” Xie Chang Ming watched the horror unfold before him. In just a moment, he had lost a few hundred men! He simply couldn’t believe it!

“It looks like the Earth Dragons from the Life World, but... the size of the earth dragon is far less massive and the speed should not be that fast...” Wei Ya’s brows were tightly knitted, those monsters were simply too fast. Despite his strength, he could only make out the appearance of those giant monsters.

However, those monsters looked exactly the same as those Earth Dragons in the Life World... But...how were they so big?

“Earth dragon?? Have you ever seen an earth dragon that’s as big as that? Damn it, the speed of those guys were even faster than the wind dragons!” Xie Chang Ming knew the earth dragon that Wei Ya spoke of. They did not put the people of the Middle Realm in their eyes but the Life World which was part of the Four Sides which were renowned for their behemoths were very much appreciated by the Upper Realm. There was a period when the Upper Realm seized many behemoths from the Life World and kept them in captivity in the Upper Realm. In captivity, these kinds of creatures were not uncommon and Xie Chang Ming had seen a lot of them but the size of those Earth Dragons were just the size of a house. Where were they as huge as those dozens that had suddenly popped out?

“We’ve really seen a damn ghost! How can there be such a monsterous being in this broken Lower Realm!” Xie Chang Ming spat out in disgust. Originally, he thought that once they’ve arrived in the Lower Realm, he could flatten everything with just a finger of his. Who knew that before they even met a single person from the Lower Realm, hundreds had perished just like that!

“Lord Qingcheng? What do you...” Wei Ya had no choice but to look at Luo Qingcheng.

Luo Qingcheng wrinkled her brows slightly, even she did not think that they would encounter such a “greeting” in the Lower Realm.

However, the giant monsters who drilled into the ground did not give Wei Ya time to think further. The second wave of the impact came very quickly. This time, the army of the Upper Realm were on high alert and looked out for where the vibrations were the most intense. Wherever the tremor was focused on, all the Gold Spirits scattered in an instant, avoiding the upcoming second wave of impact with their own speed.

However, just as they dodged the nightmares from beneath, sudden bolts of lightning started falling from the sky!

The dazzling thunder and lightning struck down at the places where the forces of the Upper Realm were most concentrated at. Those who were still avoiding the attacks from under the ground were caught off guard and didn’t notice the sudden crisis from above and were immediately turned into charred bodies by the sudden strike of lightning! !

The roaring of thunder was endless, leaving only charred bodies wherever it struck. Immediately after, those underground behemoths rushed out, coordinating with the flurry of attacks of the lightning. With the attack of lightning thrown into the equation, pandemonium immediately broke out!

This time, the large army of the Upper Realm personally experienced to be attacked from both sides; the ground under their feet was shaking vigorously and they didn’t know when would the behemoth emerge and yet they had to be mindful of the deadly lightning falling from the sky. Although they were all Gold Spirits, but being besieged from both sides with such a scope of damage and horror, they were all miserable! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wei Ya looked up incredulously and saw nine humongous birds with dark blue feathers hovering in the sky!
