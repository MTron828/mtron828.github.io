In the Spirit World, once the Spirit Lord heard that Jun Wu Xie was coming back, he immediately gathered his groups of people and hurried to the portal gate together with Brownie, Nalan Yue and Flame Dragon to wait for her. A big group of spirits were following behind him. All of them were human spirits who were wearing the uniform of the Rui Lin Army.

“Grandfather, are we going to meet Miss Jun soon?” A handsome boy pulled Wen Xin Han’s sleeve gently. His eyes were full of admiration.

While smiling with his eyes squinted, Wen Xin Han patted on his grandson head and said. “Yeah, we’re going to meet her soon.”

During the past year, Wen Xin Han was forced to put pressure on Lin Palace due to the duress of Qing Yun Clan in order to save his grandson. But how would he ever know, that the Young Miss from the Lin Palace was able to save his grandson with only one medicinal pill?

These years, the health of Wen Xin Han’s grandson was slowly recovering day by day. Wen Xin Han had also started to teach him the way of cultivating spirit energy. After the location of the Spirit World was transferred, he too, brought his grandson into the Spirit World to cultivate. The one thing that must be mentioned was that, after listening to the stories and rumours of Jun Wu Xie and the Rui Lin Army, Wen Qin, the grandson of Wen Xin Han, registered to join the army without Wen Xin Han noticing. And Wen Qin was now a member of the Rui Lin Army.

The thing Wen Qin regretted the most was that he had never seen Jun Wu Xie before.

The Spirit Lord, standing aside, was looking at both the grandparent and the grandchild with his smiling eyes. He was so surprised and happy when he received the news of Jun Wu Xie coming to the Spirit World. The Spirit World was indebted to Jun Wu Xie but she suddenly went missing five years ago. Though the Spirit Lord was so worried, he wasn’t able to find her by himself.

And today, he finally got the news saying that Jun Wu Xie had returned safely, for sure he would be feeling in a transport of joy.

As the conversation went on, a dazzling ray appeared at the portal gate that connects between the Human World and the Spirit World. At the very moment, all eyes of the spirits were focusing on the light.

A few figures walked out from the ray. The moment the first figure came out, its slim and thin body caught all the attention of the spirits!

“Roarrrrr!!” Brownie almost cannot wait. It rushed towards the light and straightaway gave the person walking in the front a big fat bear hug!

Jun Wu Xie just entered the Spirit World and she was hugged abruptly by a huge figure. Her pairs of eyes widened a little and she then found out that the one who pounced onto her was Brownie that she had never seen for a long time!

“Oh-o-o-o-oh! Roarrrrr! Woahhh!” Squealing in utmost happiness, Brownie hugged Jun Wu Xie tightly. Its sound was like the thunder, penetrating into the ears of every spirit there.

“Speak properly!” Nalan Yue moved forward and gave Brownie who was simply shouting and yelling a slap right away. It seemed like the strength he applied on Brownie was not that weak, but it didn’t feel painful at all since Brownie’s skin was rough and thick.

Brownie didn’t feel the pain but just held Jun Wu Xie closely in its arms, like it was afraid that people around him were going to snatch her away from it.

“I don’t feel comfortable speaking human language.” Brownie moved its nose a bit while two of its bear paws were still holding on Jun Wu Xie tightly but with care, preventing itself from injuring her.

Being a beast spirit, it was its instinct to growl. Although it can speak human language, it still wasn’t able to let its excitement out completely!

“Alright, stay calm you bear spirit. Miss Jun has just arrived. You’re going to scare her if you keep on being so excited,” said the Spirit Lord in an obvious delight tone while grinning.

“Roar?” The Yin Yang Bear that just entered after Qiao Chu saw the scene of Jun Wu Xie being hugged by the bear spirit. Subconsciously, it moved its paw and lightly scratched on Jun Wu Xie’s arm, seemingly to have the intention to compete with the spirit bear in obtaining her attention.
