Chapter 13: “Memories of (2)”

Jun Wu Xie glanced at him as he plopped himself in front of her and in a very smooth and practiced motion, he personally fed her the medicine.

For Jun Wu Xie, she didn’t think too deep into those actions as she naively took for granted that he was honestly repaying his gratitude.

From birth, she grew up in the secret villa for over ten years, from a naïve young child to her teens, she didn’t get much chance to learn and understand the outside world. How to get along with others were not within the scope of her thinking.

During that period of time, only numerous medical books and medical knowledge filled her brain, her only relative, held her captive deep in the mountains.

Do not expect anything from her with regards to the ways of the world.

Jun Wu Yao bent over slightly, one hand on her back firmly supporting her while a bowl of medicine in the other hand, slowly feeding her.

When he bent over she gave a slight frown.

“I do not like the smell of blood.” She said grimly.

Jun Wu Yao smiled stiffly. Jun Wu Xie continued sipping the medicine.

As Jun Wu Yao carried the empty bowl away, as soon as he left the room, his smile faded, raising his hand he sniffed his sleeve, a very faint smell of blood.

Earlier on, he was careful not to get any bloodstains on himself.

“It seems that next time, I must take a bath first.” Frivolous smile appeared once again on Jun Wu Yao’s handsome face, dark eyes so deep that reflected no traces of any emotion.
