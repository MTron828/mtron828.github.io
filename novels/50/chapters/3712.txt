Chapter 2307: Secrets of the Night Regime (2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Not considered ordinary?” Qiao Chu was surprised, he had this inkling that he would be listening to something incredible.

Jun Wu Xie placed the brush that was in her hand down and interlinked her fingers and placed them on top of the scroll before her.

“Do you still remember, back then at the Cloudy Peak? Ye Sha’s death?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Chu was stunned in surprise for a moment.

That year, they were still not familiar with Ye Sha and did not know that there was a hidden guard protecting Jun Wu Xie. It was only until that critical moment that Ye Sha appeared but because of the disparity in strength, he chose to blow himself up to protect them.

When his thoughts reached this point, Qiao Chu silently gulped his saliva.

Sacrificing oneself – these two words were Jun Wu Xie’s inverse scale and taboo subject.

After Ye Sha had sacrificed himself, there were no remains left. The only thing left was a pile of snake bones. Then, Qiao Chu and the others could only bring this away and only after returning to the Zephyr Academy did they use this in memory of Ye Sha and buried it in the hill behind.

And then....

Ye Sha suddenly appeared again!

“Oh... I’ve always wanted to ask, is the current Ye Sha the same person as the Ye Sha back then?” Qiao Chu asked in a cautious manner.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

“From the beginning to the end, it had been him all along. In Night Regime, there are a lot of people who do not actually exist, they were seeds of the Spirit Tree that Jun Wu Xie had brought over. They were souls, but seeds are after all mere seeds and without the Spirit Tree, they were not as efficient and Jun Wu Yao could only supplement them with his blood to sustain them.”

Using the seeds of the Spirit Tree as the soul and Jun Wu Yao’s blood as their flesh, these were the origins of the majority of the Night Regime. That is why they don’t have a real body, hence they could only be considered to be an existence that was incomplete. The snake bones was what Jun Wu Yao created them with and that was also why after Ye Sha had blown himself up, there were still the remnants of the snake bones.

The reason why the Night Regime was invisible in the Middle Realm was because other than their explosive power, it was because of their existence which was close to being immortal.

As long as the snake bones weren’t destroyed, Jun Wu Yao would be able to let them be reborn. It was just that once they have been reborn, they were able to inherit their memory from before but they would lose many emotions that had been there previously. To those who had died, although their souls had not been destroyed but they experience some sort like a reincarnation. In a sense, it was death. Being reborn was just using the same soul with a new body.

“Ye Gu’s existence is different.” Jun Wu Xie explained further, Ye Gu was an orphan of the Spirit Soul Race. Only after drinking Jun Wu Yao’s blood did he manage to harness the dark spirit.”

“It’s no wonder! After you’ve said it, I finally understand it all! No wonder Martial Master Tian Ze’s strength had soared tremendously over the past five years. I heard from Xue’er that when you saved him, it seemed like Big Brother Jun Wu Yao had also contributed a drop of blood. After hearing your explanation, I have understood it all!” Qiao Chu’s eyes were sparkling, previously Tian Ze’s strength was not comparable to Su Ya yet over the past five years, the one with the fastest growth was actually Tian Ze.

The speed in which he progressed was simply jaw dropping and he was the first person amongst all to have actually broken through to the Gold Spirit!

And it was also after reaching the realm of the Gold Spirit, there was a sudden change in his spirit energy, the originally resplendent gold light had turned greyish black in a very short period of time. When this happened, it had scared Tian Ze so much that he thought that there was a problem with himself and had completely freaked out.

He did not know that this was actually a blessing!

“After attaining the realm of Gold Spirit, then the spirit energy turned into dark spirit.... Hey! Wait! Does that mean that.... All the members of the Night Regime... are actually above the realm of the Gold Spirit?!” Qiao Chu was shocked at discovering such an astounding fact!
