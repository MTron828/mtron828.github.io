Chapter 357: “Discipleship (1)”

It was early the next morning when Jun Wu Xie awoke. Jun Wu Yao had disappeared once again and she walked outside. Ye Sha appeared before her.

“Miss.”

Jun Wu Xie stared at the familiar yet at the same time unfamiliar face in silence.

“Master Wu Yao has left to seek something. Please do not worry and wait here for a period.” Ye Sha said stoically.

Jun Wu Xie was thoughtful for a short moment before she guessed what Jun Wu Yao was seeking for.

He had mentioned yesterday that he would find a way to heal her soul to become complete again, but an incomplete soul was not that easily mended and what could have made Jun Wu Yao leave to seek can only be something that can heal her.

Jun Wu Xie felt a sudden warmth spread from her heart and only nodded to Ye Sha. Ye Sha then disappeared and his presence was completely erased in a moment.

The previous Ye Sha had done the same thing, protecting her in silence, and unnoticed.

Jun Wu Xie turned her attention back to the present and walked further outside. If she was not able to return to the Lin Palace, she had other plans in mind.

In the garden, Yan Bu Gui sitting on the stone bench, with a wine jar in hand, while he observed Fei Yan and Rong Ruo sparring each other. Right beside him, Hua Yao and Qiao Chu who were still rather weak stood. They had not recovered enough from their injuries to undergo any intensive training.

The two figures moved quickly in their battle, their speed an incessant blur, their actions too fast to be captured by the eye.

As Jun Wu Xie approached, she was watching the match between Fei Yan and Rong Ruo and she realised that the power of those two were in no way inferior to Hua Yao and Qiao Chu.

At such a young age and to possess such power, it was surely startling to many people.

“Little Xie?” Qiao Chu spotted Jun Wu Xie approaching immediately and he zipped right up to her without a moment’s hesitation.

“You came here just at the right time. The match between Fei Yan and Rong Ruo is just heating up. Don’t miss the show.” Qiao Chu had reached out to pull Jun Wu Xie, but he suddenly retracted his hand. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jun Wu Xie nodded anyway, and followed Qiao Chu into the garden.

Hua Yao and Jun Wu Xie nodded in greeting.

Yan Bu Gui was trying to observe Jun Wu Xie discreetly when he found the cold eyes looking right at him. Yan Bu Gui immediately averted his eyes and kept them on the match in front of him.

Jun Wu Xie turned and asked Qiao Chu who was beside her: “How do I enroll into Phoenix Academy?”

Qiao Chu was enjoying himself thoroughly watching the match when Jun Wu Xie’s query made him turn with his eyes widened, and stared at Jun Wu Xie in disbelief.

“Wha..... What did you say?”

“I want to train myself here.” Jun Wu Xie disregarded Qiao Chu’s shocked expression, and said with an expressionless face.

“.....” Qiao Chu’s mouth moved, but no words came out.

What did he just hear?

Jun Wu Xie wanted to stay here at the Phoenix Academy?

Even Hua Yao’s face registered shock at Jun Wu Xie’s statement.

“Are you sure?” Qiao Chu finally recovered and asked again.

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

Qiao Chu’s face broke into an impossibly wide smile at that moment!

“That’s just great! You can be our Master’s disciple! He’s really good!”

Qiao Chu could not hold in his excitement and literally pushed Jun Wu Xie to come stand before Yan Bu Gui. Yan Bu Gui was just taking a long draw at his wine jar when he was almost choked to death by his moronic disciple’s actions!

Even if he did not know what relationship this kid had with the Lord, he saw how protective the Lord was of him. This kid held a rather special place in the Lord’s heart.

If he were to accept the kid as a disciple.....

Just thinking about it made his blood turn cold.

But Jun Wu Xie was already standing before Yan Bu Gui and she had already toyed with the idea when she saw Hua Yao’s and Qiao Chu’s powers. In order to grow stronger, she must cherish every opportunity before her.

Before Yan Bu Gui could utter a single word of protest, Jun Wu Xie said: “Your disciple Jun Xie, pays his greetings to Master.”
