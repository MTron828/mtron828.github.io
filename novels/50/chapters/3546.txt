Thus, after Gu Xin Yan regained consciousness, she had not met with Jun Wu Xie. Although Gu Yi did not die under Jun Wu Xie’s hands, but Jun Wu Xie had every intention of killing Gu Yi, but just that that final strike was blocked by Gu Xin Yan.

From a certain perspective, wouldn’t it make Jun Wu Xie the killer who murdered Gu Xin Yan’s father?

Jun Wu Xie had never thought that Gu Xin Yan would not hate her, and for her to not mind it all that much. She had saved Gu Xin Yan only because she was not evil at heart, nor had she committed much evil, and just because of that.

A sliver of pain glinted in Gu Xin Yan’s eyes. She drew in a deep breath and shook her head slightly.

“My Father..... was not killed by you. I do not hate you.” Pain grew in Gu Xin Yan’s chest, and an indescribable emotion spread inside. Maybe she should be feeling hatred, but the hate would not come. Especially after the crimes of the Twelve Palaces had been exposed to the people, Gu Xin Yan really didn’t know whether she should feel any hate.

In the past, she was the Eldest Miss of the Blood Fiend Palace, a proud daughter of Heaven that everyone cradled in their palms. Gu Yi indulged her in every way, doing everything he could to groom her, seeking to make her become the next Palace Lord of the Blood Fiend Palace. But as Gu Xin Yan was still very young and moreover she was also a girl, Gu Xi had intentionally and unintentionally diverted all unspeakable deeds of the palace away from Gu Xin Yan. All that Gu Xin Yan knew was that her father might have committed some bad deeds and when all the crimes were revealed and made known, it was only then that Gu Xin Yan realized just how terrifying the deeds and actions of her father and all the other Palace Lords had truly been.

But.....

That was her father, so how could she detest him?

After she woke up, she was greeted with news of her father’s death, and the person who killed her father was Gu Ying..... the person she saw as her brother in her heart.

The Blood Fiend Palace was destroyed. She had initially almost lost her mind, a little crazed for a period where her heart had been filled with hate. The people in the Spirit Jade Palace had not made things difficult for her as she had been saved by Jun Wu Xie and they treated her with courtesy, not even restricting her freedom in any way.

That was the biggest setback Gu Xin Yan had ever encountered in her life. She had muddleheadedly escaped out from the Spirit Jade Palace’s branch and gone back to the city where the Blood Fiend Palace had originally been. But when she went into the city that had been all too familiar to her, where everything before her eyes were things she knew so well..... but felt so foreign at the same time.

The citizens who had lived in fear and trepidation in the past were all showing uninhibited smiles. They still lived the same lives like they had before, but were happier, and more blissful.

Gu Xin Yan stayed in the city for more than a month, and in that period of time, she could clearly feel the level of joy the destruction of the Blood Fiend Palace had brought to the citizens.....

She had not known that the citizens would really hate her father that much.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Gu Xin Yan and from Gu Xin Yan’s clear eyes, she did not see the slightest pretense or deceit, like all that she said was what Gu Xin Yan was thinking in her heart.

“I came here to look for you today for nothing else but to say this. I want to..... thank you.... for saving me.” Gu Xin Yan looked at Jun Wu Xie whose countenance had changed, the image of the handsome youth imprinted in her heart already gradually becoming blurry, but just felt a strange emotion that still lingered in her heart, causing her to be unable to hate Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie then said indifferently: “I was the one who wounded you. There is no need for you to thank me. Wherever you want to go in future, no one will stop you, and you can come seek revenge against me anytime you want. There is no debt owed between us.”

Jun Wu Xie’s voice was soft, but it caused Gu Xin Yan to startle slightly, and the corners of her mouth could not help but rise to reveal a faint bitter smile.
