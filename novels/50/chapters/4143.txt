Chapter 2739: The Art of Selling One’s Teammates（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Master Nangong, you are ...” Liu Yi looked at Nangong Lie in surprise. It was rare for the strong like Nangong Lie to fall sick, yet why ... had he fallen ill shortly after reaching Sea Spirit City?

Nangong Lie waved his hand and dismissed it as nothing but only he himself knew best what the root of the problem was – fear. After returning from the seaside, he felt a little uncomfortable. He knew clearly that that person would never appear in the Upper Realm. But the fear in his heart could not be dissipated for a long time and before he realized it, he had fallen sick.

Mu En and others didn’t dare to say anything when they saw Nangong Lie like this, but they were deep in thought and an idea formed in their minds.

“Master Nangong fell sick while in Sea Spirit City, where is the City Lord of Sea Spirit City? Why isn’t he here personally to serve and take care of Master Nangong? Hurry up! Send word to Yan Hai and make him hurry up and scoot his ass over! He must serve Master Nangong properly! If anything happens to Master Nangong, he can’t afford the repercussions! ”

At the urging of Mu En and others, the members of the Night Regime returned to the City Lord manor and conveyed their message to Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie sat calmly but Fei Yan who was seated on the side who heard every word almost spit all the water out of his mouth.

“What?!!! They actually want Little Xie to take care of Nangong Lie?!!” Fei Yan looked as if he had seen a ghost.

Zheng Weilong had no knowledge of their previous encounter, so she did not understand why they always react so strongly each time they mention Nangong Lie.

“I suddenly feel a little sympathy for Nangong Lie.” Rong Ruo chuckled and could not help but mourn for the teammates of Nangong Lie who behaved like pigs.

They had already guessed the reason why Nangong Lie fell ill. It was the day after Jun Wu Xie went to the beach for a walk and not long after, Nangong Lie was sick. There was no need to give it much thought at all. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In view of the strong psychological shadow that Jun Wu Xie left on him, the people in the Five Cities even dared to let Jun Wu Xie “take care of” Nangong Lie! Did they really think that Nangong Lie’s life was too long?

Qiao Chu and the rest knew all the ins and out but they could not say anything. Their weird expressions made Zheng Weilong even more confused. She always felt that something was wrong, but no matter what, she still couldn’t tell what it was.

“Tell them, I will pass by this afternoon.” Jun Wu Xie finally spoke and shockingly, she had actually agreed.

But...

“Little Xie, you are really bad.”

“Evil, too evil.”

Qiao Chu and Fei Yan looked peculiarly at Jun Wu Xie as if she had done a great evil.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at them indifferently without a word more.

However, Zheng Weilong was impressed by Jun Wu Xie’s attitude of knowing when to ‘bow and submit’.

“It’s good that City Lord has thought it out so carefully and knows when to take a step back. Nangong Lie is one of the Top Ten Masters, unlike any of those people in the 72 cities, so you can’t be too rude.” Zheng Weilong said with praise.

Who knew that the moment Zheng Weilong finished her words, Qiao Chu and Fei Yan who had been enduring for a long time could no longer take it and the two of them suddenly broke out in laughter. They started laughing hysterically, so much that Zheng Weilong was stunned in place.

“Did I ... say something wrong?” Zheng Weilong looked nervously at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Qiao Chu lightly: “No, they’re crazy, you don’t need to care about them.”

Zheng Weilong was stunned for a moment before she obediently nodded her head.

“Go and prepare, you will follow me later.” Jun Wu Xie got up and looked at Zheng Weilong.

“Me?” Zheng Weilong opened her eyes wide. “But I’m from Diminishing Moon City. Diminishing Moon City has always been affiliated with the White Night City. People in the five cities would definitely know that. If they were to see me, they might think more.”
