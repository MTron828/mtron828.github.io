Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Thunder Eagle?!” Wei Ya’s eyes opened incredibly wide as he stared unbelievably at the dark blue eagles hovering above the sky, each eagle was massive and nine gathered above the crowd and cast a huge shadow above them.

The nine huge eagles was like the Thunder Eagle found in the Life World from the Four Sides of the Middle Realm but they were way bigger!

Thunder Eagle was a kind of giant beast that was quite common in the Life World. Its shape was like an eagle and its feathers were naturally imbued with lightning. They could call forth thunder and lightning. But... although the Thunder Eagle could conjure up lightning, it was a far cry from such a ferocious lightning that brings forth destruction whenever it falls from the sky! The magnitude of the damage was so drastic that Wei Ya could not compare it with the Thunder Eagle he knew of.

However, the hovering monsters were exactly the same as the Thunder Eagle in his memory and this time, he could see clearly that they were just a whole lot bigger than the Thunder Eagle, but there was no change in appearance.

“What is happening? Why did the Thunder Eagle of the Life World appear here? When did they become so big, so strong?” Xie Chang Ming had also discovered the abnormality, and he turned livid, this Lower Realm was bedeviled!

Let’s not discuss how the giant monsters in the Life World will appear here, but one after another, they seem to have gone under some kind of mutation and their combat power had increased by many folds!

The situation in front of them had already exceeded their expectations. The sudden attacks had caught them totally unprepared.

Luo Qingcheng’s expression darkened and ordered, “All of you calm down and immediately counterattack!”

With Luo Qingcheng’s order, the flustered army recovered a trace of calmness. They began to organize counterattacks. However, the speed of the mutated Earth Dragons were too fast, and their scales were extremely hard. If they could not get them when they emerged from beneath the ground, then they would lose the opportunity to attack.

Coupled with the tumultuous Thunder Eagles that had been circling in the sky, the army of the Upper Realm had suffered considerably.

Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya had no choice but to join in the flay. They thought that they only needed to participate at the end of the battle but who knew that as soon as they came to the Lower Realm and in less than half a day’s time, they were forced to get involved.

It took awhile for the army of the Upper Realm to kill those mutated Earth Dragons. As for those Thunder Eagles, using their amazing speed and flight, they immediately retreated before the Upper Realm could counterattack and escaped unscathed.

Just this sudden siege had caused the army of the Upper Realm to lose thousands of men. It was really unexpected. Looking at the upheavelled ground that was filled with blood and incomplete or charred corpses splayed all around, the pungent blood stench provoked everyone’s nerves. The carnage had given this bunch of conceited and arrogant people of the Upper Realm a heavy blow.

Although thousands of men were nothing compared to the five hundred thousand strong army, but where they were now was the Lower Realm which they had never placed in their eyes. Yet, the ones that attacked them were mutations of behemoths they had never seen before. This blow from the behemoths was really heavy.

Wei Ya took a deep breath, this damage was not enough to hurt them deeply but deep in their hearts, there was a huge quake.

Was this really the Lower Realm that they despised? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Prepare and set off immediately.” Luo Qingcheng said with a gloomy face.

“Lord Qingcheng, do we need to investigate...” Wei Ya cautiously said because he had a nagging feeling that this attack was not a coincidence. These mutant behemoths had appeared out of nowhere and suddenly attacked them!
