Chapter 2921: Flooding paternal love (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Bai Mo thought that the biggest mistake in his life a thousand years ago was that he shouldn’t run to Jun Wu Yao to challenge him. If it wasn’t for that battle, he wouldn’t have been seriously injured by Jun Wu Yao. Given his strength, if he wasn’t seriously wounded, he would have already been among the Top Ten Experts, else he would not be provoking Nangong Lie today. Without provoking Nangong Lie, he would not encounter Jun Wu Xie and found out about Jun Wu Xie’s Dual Spirit Ring. He eventually rose to greed and fell into the hands of Jun Wu Yao again ...

Bai Mo found that he had walked an entire circle and came back to the same spot. The initial mistake made him end up nearly being killed by Jun Wu Yao. And this time, he was afraid that he would not even have the chance to hide and recover!

Only God knows what medicine did Jun Wu Yao take to have such unbelievable thoughts!

Bai Mo regretted his actions countless times, but he could only roll about the cold floor like a fish out of water and wanted to cry but didn’t even have any tears.

What good son? Where is his so-called father? !!

Even though Bai Mo was ignorant, he knew that no father would tie up and throw his son onto the ground!

Someone had no sense of being a father at all!

Bai Mo couldn’t help feeling a little distressed, and he was caught in an endless loop of remorseful thoughts. He didn’t notice that his room door was being pushed open a little by others.

When Bai Mo finally regained his senses, he realized that he was shrouded in shadows without knowing it!

Five pairs of eyes were staring at him intently!

Only for a moment, Bai Mo snorted loudly. If it hadn’t been for his spiritual power being sealed and his limbs tied up, he would have swept an aura of light over!

“What are you going to do !!!” Bai Mo stared at the uninvited Qiao Chu and others. If he remembered correctly, these five guys were just the ones who had watched the show in Jun Wu Yao’s room just now. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Why would they collectively run over here to watch?

“Hey!” Qiao Chu squinted his eyes with a smile. That wretched smile made Bai Mo feel all his hair rise...

If this had happened normally, Bai Mo would have kicked him a long time ago, but now ...

“What the hell do you want to do !?” Bai Mo was a little nervous. For the first time, he felt so helpless and without spiritual power, his little arms and calves couldn’t stop the “infringement” of these people!

“Nephew!” Qiao Chu slapped Bai Mo’s small shoulder.

A sudden call of “nephew” completely stumped Bai Mo as he froze in place ...

What did this guy call him! !! !!

The ignorant Qiao Chu did not notice Bai Mo’s menacing eyes, instead, he squatted beside Bai Mo, and said in a serious manner: “Nephew! We are all your mother’s good brothers. According to seniority, you have to address us Uncles, do you understand?”

“...” Bai Mo was dumbfounded, he didn’t understand! He didn’t wish to understand!

He was threatened to recognize someone else as his father and mother. He was already very aggrieved and yet at this moment, these five “uncles” suddenly popped out from nowhere?!

At this moment, Bai Mo fainted and his eyes rolled over!

He had never been so aggrieved being a Spirit Ring exponent!

“Hey? Be good and call out uncle!” Qiao Chu said very matter-of-factly. Although Jun Wu Xie had told them Bai Mo’s identity, but for Qiao Chu and the rest, they were more concerned that Jun Wu Yao recognized Bai Mo as his son. Some of them who have lacked affection since childhood, they will not miss the chance to claim a family connection with their relatives!
