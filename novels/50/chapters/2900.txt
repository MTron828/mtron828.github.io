Chapter 2901: Life and death worm (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Such startling news pulled them into deep contemplation. If His Lord created a life and death worm to target Jun Wu Yao, how did he know that Jun Wu Yao would appear?

No one knew this.

Everyone could only leave first and think about this issue separately.

Jun Wu Xie temporarily locked Elder Luo in the Sacred Maiden Hall, waiting for the arrival of Gu Ying a few days later. Perhaps, she could find a breakthrough point from Gu Ying.

Of course ...

The Heavens do not follow one’s wishes.

Before Gu Ying reached the Holy Mountain, the news of His Lord had been delivered in advance.

Because of the strength of Jun Wu Xie’s Dual Spirit Ring, His Lord already knew and paid close attention to it. The person who sent the message directly told Jun Wu Xie told her that she was to set off immediately to the Sacred City to meet His Lord!

This news completely disrupted Jun Wu Xie’s plan, but unexpectedly, it was reasonable.

Things were in a hurry, and Jun Wu Xie could not wait until the arrival of Gu Ying. At the same time, Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu decided to leave half a day in advance to ensure the safety of Jun Wu Xie.

When Duan Qi heard the news, her mood was even more complicated. She thought His Lord would take Jun Wu Xie away for a long time. She did not expect that this would happen so suddenly. The only thing was that Jun Wu Xie had already chosen Yan Xi, even if she was not in the tribe, they were still hopeful.

But...

On the night Jun Wu Xie and others were about to set off, a piece of news broke Duan Qi’s dream.

Yan Xi should have left with Jun Wu Xie, and Jun Wu Xie had already made good preparations. Elder Luo had also given hints by using elixir to make her forget everything that happened, including Ling’er. By the way, Ling’er was mixed within her own group of people and was ready to take her away.

However, when Jun Wu Xie asked Yan Xi to tag along, Ye Sha who went to Yan Xi ‘s residence returned in a short time, and passed a message to Jun Wu Xie’s ears.

“Yan Xi is dead,” Ye Sha said.

Jun Wu Xie froze slightly.

Qiao Chu, who was ready to go, was dumbfounded.

What’s going on?

“Dead? What’s going on?” Qiao Chu hurriedly asked. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ye Sha told everyone everything he heard.

Yan Xi was killed in her room, and the person who killed her was Han Shu!

Duan Qi and others arrived one step ahead of Ye Sha. They wanted to explain to Yan Xi before leaving, but they killed her. They did not expect and pushed the door open. They saw a bloody scene.

Han Shu, holding a blood-stained dagger in her hand, sat idly in a pool of blood. Lying beside her was Yan Xi, who had lost her breath.

That scene shocked Duan Qi.

After seeing people arrive, Han Shu suddenly laughed. Her crazy and twisted laughter shocked the entire tribe.

Han Shu was crazy because of jealousy and hatred.

She couldn’t stand her last chance to be taken away by Yan Xi. So she killed Yan Xi before she left. She didn’t want Yan Xi to get what she couldn’t have.

These two people who were supposed to be allies, ended up in death and madness. This also caused Duan Qi’s wishful thinking to fall.

Due to His Lord’s order, Duan Qi and the rest wanted to temporarily sacrifice individuals to Jun Wu Xie. But they did not have enough time.

In the end, Jun Wu Xie left with her companions, but the entire Sacred Maiden Tribe was in dead silence.
