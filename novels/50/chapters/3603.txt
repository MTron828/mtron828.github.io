Chapter 2198: Fighting Together（5）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Gold Spirits working with Ba He were getting more and more annoyed by this bunch of mad men. These were obviously just weaklings who could not even withstand a strike from them yet they just kept on rushing towards them without any regards for their own lives. It was as if... They didn’t know the meaning of death at all.

One Gold Spirit struck out a fist and it had completely passed right through the abdomen of a disciple of the Spirit Jade Palace. With just one strike, it had broken through her internal organs and a large amount of blood flowed down his palm. There was a touch of disdain in that cold smile of his. However, when he wanted to retract his hand, he found that he could not do so.

“I’ve caught him!!” The girl who vomited out a mouthful of fresh blood held on tightly to the hand of that Gold Spirit whose hand had went through her body. Using every ounce of strength left in her, she restricted the action of his hand. Her entire face was stained with blood, but her eyes were sparkling with a fascinating light.

In a flash, the surrounding disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace immediately turned around and attacked. More than a dozen people combined their strength to kill one Gold Spirit!

The moment that Gold Spirit fell, that girl breathed her last and when she fell, her hands that clutched onto the enemy were still tight in an iron grip and even after she fell, she did not let go.

There was no time for sorrow, no time to cry, all those disciples that had worked together to fight the Gold Spirit immediately turned and threw themselves back into the fray of battle.

No one knew that the feelings between them had long surpassed that of ordinary fellow disciples, having spent a millennium together in seclusion, they had long became a true family.

The eyes of the fallen girl had lost its lustre, however her mouth had hooked up into a dazzling smile.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord fully revealed his strength of a Gold Spirit as he summoned Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom out. With their unmatched coordination, they imminently paved a bloody path as he blitzed to Jun Wu Xie’s side while Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom forced Ba He back for moment.

“Can you still hold on?” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord supported Jun Wu Xie’s arm and the arm that held her quickly turned warm and sticky with her blood.

“I can.” Jun Wu Xie spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, yet there was no change in her expression.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord smiled.

“Why have you all come?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“Spirit Jade Palace has received the immeasurable grace from Cloudy Book Academy as well as yourself. In the entire Spirit Jade Palace, there isn’t any ungrateful person.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord looked at Jun Wu Xie and laughed teasingly as he said: “Don’t tell me that we are not allowed to repay our gratitude?”

Jun Wu Xie was stunned for moment before she revealed a trace of smile from the corner of her lips. She stood firm and she tightened the grip of the light swords in her hands as her eyes lit up. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Fighting together is my life’s fortune.”

“I feel this way too.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord smiled as he shook off the blood on his sharp sword and looked ahead as a cold glint flashed by his eyes.

Ba He looked at the Spirit Jade Palace Lord who had suddenly appeared and his gaze turned frosty.

“There are more and more ignorant wild dogs who are coming to seek death, did you think that with just the lot of you, you are able to turn the tide? Simply a bunch of ignorant fools!”

Ba He had never been as annoyed as today before. This was clearly a trap that had been set up for the little old man. He did not expect that there would be so many incidents in succession. First of all, there was Jun Wu Xie, then the appearance of Spirit Jade Palace followed by the disciples of the Nine Temples that had defected.

Even though he knew that the strength of these people were not enough to reverse the situation, however it still made him extremely furious!

A bunch of garbage that were disgusting like flies!

“In the end, who the fool is would soon be revealed.” Jun Wu Xie’s lips curled up into a sneer as she took the lead to attack Ba He. After the Spirit Jade Palace Lord attacked, Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom followed closely behind!

In a moment, three figures had blitzed forward in a flash!
