Chapter 1105: “Face Slap – Eleventh Form (7)”

But Qu Xin Rui had no qualms about abandoning all sense of scruples, and even to the extent of not being bothered in the least, that the same bloodline flowed within her body and Qu Ling Yue’s!

Jun Wu Xie’s face had seemingly turned so cold as if it had been covered with a layer of frost, so icily cold that the air around her suddenly became thin.

Qu Xin Rui was smiling gleefully, the cold expression on Jun Xie’s face making her feel the pleasure of vengeance more strongly.

“Little Young Master Jun. You asked for all of this to happen. If you had just obediently cooperated with me, I would not have needed to stir up so much trouble. In the end, you are the one who implicated them all into this. But don’t worry, I have still kept the little lass alive, although she has now become a wilted flower, but..... at least she still has a breath left in her. If you are willing to work together with me, I can jolly well return her and your Spirit Beast to you.” Qu Xin Rui said, feeling she was making a highly generous offer.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed.

Qu Xin Rui had put it across very nicely, but in actual fact, it did not matter whether Jun Wu Xie agreed to work with Qu Xin Rui, the Thousand Beast City would still end up annihilated. The various powers within the Lower Realm were just mere pawns the Twelve Palaces held in their hands and the only use they were good for was to locate the Dark Emperor’s tomb. Once that was found, no matter who they were, they would be silenced by the Twelve Palaces.

“Do you really think that I am as dumb as you are?” Jun Wu Xie said, laughing coldly.

The smile on Qu Xin Rui’s face immediately showed signs of cracking. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I have absolutely no interest in becoming a dog of the Twelve Palaces.” Jun Wu Xie sneered.

The two words, Twelve Palaces, had completely shattered Qu Xin Rui’s composure and her eyes suddenly widened as she stared at Jun Wu Xie in shock.

“What are you saying? How did you know.....?” Qu Xin Rui could not believe that she was hearing the words ‘Twelve Palaces’ coming out from the mouth of a person of the Lower Realm!

It must be known, before she broke through to the Purple Spirit, she had been completely ignorant of the fact that under these Heavens, there existed a place she had never ever heard of before. And Jun Xie was still so young, how could he possibly know about the existence of the Twelve Palaces!

Jun Wu Xie stared coldly at Qu Xin Rui. “The stupid, have no right to question.”

Previously, Jun Wu Xie had merely intended to let death be Qu Xin Rui’s punishment. But now, she had changed her mind.

The expression on Qu Xin Rui’s face was growing darker and darker. She had thought that Jun Xie’s appearance was happening just like she had planned, because she had gained control over Lord Meh Meh and Jun Xie would be passive. But the way everything was happening here, was completely different from what she had expected.

Jun Xie had not only failed to show the slightest sign, he was even on the defensive, his mannerisms and demeanor was instead much more highly aggressive than before!

All of this had completely deviated away from any of Qu Xin Rui’s plans!

In the Thousand Beast City, it had been a long time since Qu Xin Rui had met anyone who dared defy her orders. It could be said that she had turned to become a tyrannical dictator over the years in the Thousand Beast City but Jun Xie’s appearance had completely broken that state of affairs! It was the first time that Qu Xin Rui had wanted to win someone over and she had been given the cold shoulder. She had then tried all ways and means, in an attempt to force Jun Wu Xie to submit, but things had not gone her way.

“Jun Xie, are you going to refuse the offered wine and choose to drink it as punishment? Since you do know about the Twelve Palaces, then you must surely know if you are to go against the Twelve Palaces, you will definitely come to no good end. No matter you, or the Fire Country behind you, when placed before the Twelve Palaces, is seen to be miniscule, and highly insignificant. I don’t think I have to remind you of that fact, do I?” No matter how dumb Qu Xin Rui could be, it was obvious that Jun Xie was not interested in the least to cooperate with her. Regardless whether she used the stick or the carrot, she had not been able to move Jun Xie in the slightest!
