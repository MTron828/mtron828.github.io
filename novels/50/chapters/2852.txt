On the surface, there didn’t seem to be any problem with his pulse. However, this smooth pulse was more like trying to cover up for something. Jun Wu Xie frowned slightly and she did not want to miss out on checking the slightest anomaly.

Jun Gu was uncertain. All of a sudden, he saw Jun Wu Xie frown. He could not help but feel a little worried, although he knew that there was not a problem with his body. But ... in some aspects he was not particularly clear. After all, he had not been close to a woman for a long time ...

“How is it?” Even Han Zi Fei couldn’t help asking at this moment.

“It shouldn’t be too different from what I thought before. But the medicine I prepared earlier is still inadequate. Is there a room here? I think I need to adjust it.” Jun Wu Xie raised her head and looked up. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She was not too sure about Jun Gu’s body before hence she could not be entirely certain when she prepared the elixir.

“You can choose whichever room you want.” Han Zi Fei said as she waved her hand generously.

Jun Wu Xie nodded and found a room to refine the elixir. Only Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei were left in the courtyard.

Jun Gu touched his wrist and stood there in a daze, feeling slightly a little overwhelmed, as if there was a voice in his heart urging him to embrace Han Zi Fei into his arms. But his instinctual rationality made him restrain himself.

He didn’t know why he loved Han Zi Fei so much. That kind of feeling came suddenly, but it was so resolute. He didn’t want to resist instinctively.

In fact, in the beginning, when Jun Gu learned that His Lord had given him a marriage, he didn’t feel anything at all. He obeyed His Lord’s will and had no idea about the woman he was going to marry.

It doesn’t matter to him who she is, whether he truly loves her or not.

But the moment he saw Han Zi Fei, he knew that this woman was the only person he loved in his life.

Jun Gu’s gaze was smoldering and when Han Zi Fei had turned to look at him, their gazes met. She raised her hand and touched Jun Gu’s cheek gently, her gaze filled with attachment and nostalgia.

She should thank God for giving her such an opportunity to see him again.

“You are going to marry me soon, are you happy?” She asked.

Jun Gu nodded steadfastly.

His reaction caused a chuckle from Han Zi Fei.

“Wait a second, wait a minute ...” Han Zi Fei’s smile was vaguely mixed with some bitterness. His eyes remained unchanged, but his memory had disappeared.

Jun Gu didn’t understand where Han Zi Fei’s sudden grief came from. He only knew that he didn’t want to see her sad and could only whisper softly, “What happened to you?”

“Nothing, I’m very happy.” Han Zi Fei whispered softly.

Jun Gu didn’t know what to say. He could only stand under the moonlight and look at her quietly.

In the room, Jun Wu Xie took out all the elixirs in her cosmos sack and prepared it as fast as possible.

A slender figure appeared silently in the room, standing quietly with his hands crossed and watched the busy Jun Wu Xie.

Her resolute gaze would always be focused whenever she was busy and it was as if everything in this world can’t interfere with her actions. Such a side of her was Jun Wu Yao’s favourite, so pure as this figure slowly etched into his heart.
