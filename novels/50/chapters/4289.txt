Jun Wu Xie glanced at Elder Luo and said nothing.

Elder Yun, however, was satisfied with Jun Wu Xie’s answer.

The main purpose of inviting Jun Wu Xie was to conceive the next generation with one of the tribe’s women. After Yan Xi caught Jun Wu Xie’s eye, Elder Yun naturally hoped that Jun Wu Xie could ‘get along’ with Yan Xi more often so that they could get a new Sacred Maiden as soon as possible.

Seeing Jun Wu Xie didn’t seem to intend to change her mind, Elder Luo did not say anything more, except to give a brief explanation about the essentials of cultivation to Jun Wu Xie, and was pulled aside by Elder Yun.

“I wondered what kind of distinguished guest that had brought Elder Yun here personally. This time, Elder Duan has good foresight. This kid has such a great opportunity at his young age. It is really good luck.” Elder Luo glanced at Jun Wu Xie from afar, the emotion in her eyes was difficult to pinpoint.

Elder Yun couldn’t detect the sarcasm in Elder Luo’s tone.

Elder Luo has loved witchcraft since she was a child. No one in the Sacred Maiden Tribe understood it but they vaguely knew that practicing this art had a great impact on Elder Luo herself. After Elder Luo gave birth to Luo Qingcheng, there had been something wrong with her body’s constitution, she had been unable to conceive anymore. Also, because of the presence of Han Zi Fei within the tribe, Luo Qingcheng’s status could never reach its peak. Elder Luo, therefore, chose to care for the sacred land alone and focused on the study of witchcraft. She did not bother much about the matters within the clan.

The only exception was when Elder Luo returned to the tribe and found Yan Xi by accident, and it was unknown how she saw that Yan Xi had the talent to learn witchcraft. She actually accepted Yan Xi as a disciple and taught her a lot. The essence of witchcraft was the key to Yan Xi’s ability to ascend to her current position.

At the end of the day, Elder Luo had many connections with the elders in the tribe, she had an especially good relationship with Duan Qi. Both were strong and competitive people, and they wanted the power of control in their own hands. However, Duan Qi was one level higher than Elder Luo, thus resulting in the current situation.

Elder Yun was usually a neutral party in the tribe, but now that she favoured Duan Qi, how could Elder Luo still be nice to her?

Elder Yun could only bear with the ridicule and sarcasm from Elder Luo without getting angry, as she smiled and said, “Elder Luo, please don’t be mistaken, I came here today not because of City Lord Yan. But, there is a matter which Elder Duan has asked me to let you know.”

“Oh? What is the matter?” Elder Luo carelessly said.

“It’s a matter concerning Highness Ying.”

Elder Luo’s eyes flashed slightly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Highness Ying’s mental strength has been unstable. His Lord has allowed Highness Ying to come to the Holy Mountain for cultivation. It so happens that Highness Ying is free recently, so in a couple of days, Highness Ying will arrive at the Holy Mountain. He will be staying with us for a period of time for his cultivation. At that time, we will need to trouble Elder Luo.” Elder Yun said.

Elder Luo’s expression was somewhat unreadable. She didn’t immediately respond to Elder Yun, instead she remained silent for a long while.

Elder Yun was a little worried at the long silence, and couldn’t help but prodded, “Elder Luo?”

Elder Luo came back to her senses and pursed her lips in an impatient manner as she replied, “Alright, since it is Highness Ying, even if you didn’t say anything, I will still arrange it properly. Regarding this issue, you do not have to say anything more. ”

Elder Yun only nodded with a smile.

The two didn’t realize it though they thought they were talking secretly, but they were heard by someone else!
