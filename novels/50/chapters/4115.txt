“Then I only need a letter to magnify this effect. The prestige of the Discerning Moon City will also make the 72 cities more certain of the authenticity of this matter.” Zheng Weilong watched Jun Wu Xie unblinkingly, the hand on her side was clenched tightly.

She was betting whether Jun Wu Xie would need her help.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Zheng Weilong. In fact, her plan had been carried out. Even without Zheng Weilong’s help, those Long Xuan City soldiers who fled would spread the news, but with Zheng Weilong, the speed would be faster. And Zheng Weilong’s identity would be of certain use.

“Of course, but I want more than just spreading the news. I want you to cooperate with me and stir up battles within the 72 cities. Are you in agreement?” Jun Wu Xie said, spreading the news was just the beginning. What she wanted was to use the shortest time possible to climb high enough and find her father!

Zheng Weilong froze slightly as Jun Wu Xie’s words made her realize that Jun Wu Xie’s intent was more terrible than she had imagined.

But there was only one chance for freedom.

“I promise you, as long as I can do it, I will fully cooperate!” Zheng Weilong has too few gambling chips in her hands, and she must use the remaining chips to fight all at once!

“Alright.” Jun Wu Xie nodded, and the cooperative relationship between the two was reached.

“The Lord of Discerning Moon City sent me to Long Xuan City in an attempt to connect Long Xuan City by marriage. Now that you have destroyed Long Xuan City, even if I want to stay, I’m afraid I can’t. Zheng Ke would not allow a chess piece like me free. If it is not Long Xuan City, then he will send me to other cities. I hope that my Lord can help me to avoid a layer of worry. “Zheng Weilong looked to Jun Wu Xie. This was the first step towards her freedom, and she did not want to give up.

As long as Zheng Ke’s plan was not abandoned, Zheng Weilong would always be a chess piece at his mercy.

There were not enough areas to help Jun Wu Xie with.

“What do you want?” Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow slightly.

“The story of Long Xuan City will soon spread, and the status of Sea Spirit City will change. I hope that my Lord can propose to Zheng Ke that you intend to marry me. This way, Zheng Ke would agree because Zheng Ke also wants to get Sea Spirit City.”Zheng Weilong revealed her intentions and this was the only way that Zheng Ke could no longer control her marriage.

Zheng Weilong didn’t notice that when she said these words, Ye Sha’s face turned black.

Zheng Weilong looked like a pretty smart individual, how could she say such a frightening thing?

If this was made known to Lord Jue... Wouldn’t she be crushed to death?

Jun Wu Xie’s brows furrowed slightly, apparently aware that her identity was different from the past.

Zheng Weilong saw a trace of resistance on Jun Wu Xie’s face, and quickly said, “Please be assured my Lord that I only want my freedom. I am not hankering for the position of your wife, my Lord. You and I only need to put on an act. It is only in name that we are married.”

Jun Wu Xie looked at Zheng Weilong. As far as the current situation was concerned, Zheng Weilong’s proposal was the most appropriate, however... Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No,” Jun Wu Xie said coldly.

Zheng Weilong froze. As far as this matter was concerned, the only person who may suffer a loss in reputation was her, and Jun Wu Xie would not be affected at all. She had thought that Jun Wu Xie would not hesitate to agree, but she did not expect Jun Wu Xie to turn it down without even thinking about it.
