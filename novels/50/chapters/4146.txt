Just when Nangong Lie had just gotten better, he fell down again a few moments later. For a while, many doctors were confused and rushed over to save him. Guan Hu and others were shocked. If something were to happen to Nangong Lie, they would not be able to shed off the responsibility! The group of people quickily gathered around him to fawn and fuss over him.

Instead, Jun Wu Xie was left aside and with both her hands folded, she cast another glance at the frightened Nangong Lie once again.

Even if one’s appearance may have changed, people’s natural sixth sense can make them sense many things, just like Nangong Lie now.

Divine Doctor Lu suspected that they were in trouble, and immediately kicked them out.

Divine Doctor Lu’s status was not low. In the Upper Realm, Divine Doctor Lu had the highest medical skills other than the Lord. Therefore, even if Guan Hu was to have any major dissatisfaction, no one would dare to disobey him and would just get out.

Initially, they wanted to use Nangong Lie’s illness to create problems for Jun Wu Xie. However, before they could do it, Nangong Lie fell ill again.

However, Nangong Lie’s illness had reminded them to show a little more care and concern.

“Yan Hai, is this the Sea Spirit City that you manage? Master Nangong has just arrived here and he has fallen ill. Just by this, you can see how chaotic Sea Spirit City is. The clothing, food and shelter that you provide are not enough. This is your attitude?!” Guan Hu glared at Jun Wu Xie who was standing by the side. This City Lord of the Sea Spirit City was not very old but his indifference annoyed them.

Jun Wu Xie looked up at Guan Hu. Nangong Lie’s illness was a heart disease. Even Divine Doctor Lu had said it yet Guan Hu was holding Jun Wu Xie responsible for this matter.

There was a hint of coldness in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. She stepped forward slightly and swept her glance over Guan Hu and the others. However, she had lost all interest in dealing with them and she lifted her foot and walked towards the exit of the courtyard instead. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

When Guan Hu and others who were just about to raise the topic again, he saw Jun Wu Xie turn to leave without a word and his expression turned ugly.

This brat was just too arrogant!

“Hey! You nasty brat! I’m talking to you, did you hear me?” Guan Hu got up and reached for Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder in an attempt to grab her.

However, the moment when Guan Hu’s hand was about to reach her, Jun Wu Xie’s figure suddenly turned into a white light and disappeared before him.

This sudden change made Mu En and others dumbfounded. Before they realized what was happening, that white light swept towards Guan Hu and Guan Hu’s huge body was hit and flew out in an instant.

The Guan Hu fell to the ground heavily with his body twitching and he fumbled about, trying to stand up but instead, he vomited a mouthful of blood and there were even a few white teeth mixed in it.

At the place where Guan Hu was standing before, the figure of Jun Wu Xie appeared instead. However, any sliver of warmth in those eyes had faded. When those eyes landed on Guan Hu, she faintly revealed her intention to kill him!

This scene stunned everyone. They knew what Guan Hu was capable of. Even if he was not comparable to the top ten City Lords, he could still be considered as one of the top exponents. However, the powerful Guan Hu that they knew of was sent flying by the seemingly weak and frail kid?

How could that be?!
