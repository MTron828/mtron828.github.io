Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Now that Jun Wu Xie had attained so many victories in succession, unless Su Jing Yan was crazy, how could he help those people from the Upper Realm who had held their Temple Lords as captives?

Moreover, with their skills, even if they wanted to join the battle, what could they do?

The same thoughts emerged in the minds of every elder of the Nine Temples. Their hearts were stirring, from the initial fear, they had turned sentimental. At this moment, they were secretly praying for Jun Wu Xie’s victory and praying that Jun Wu Xie would be able to rescue their Temple Lords from the control of the Upper Realm.

In the hall, a heavy pungent stench of blood hung in the air and the rising heat made it another form of torture in the temple.

The violent impact that thundered all around was endless. The hard marble floor had already shattered into pieces of broken gravel under the strong impact. Following the surge of the airflow, these pieces of broken gravel got caught in the air and like a hail storm, it started whirling chaotically inside the hall!

An ear piercing scream resounded suddenly and all one could see was a blood-stained figure flying out of the storm and slammed hard onto the mural wall in the hall. The bright red blood added a touch of demonic hint on the mural. .

Nangong Lie fell to the ground and the right arm that was originally controlling the Spirit Ring had been broken while in battle. Blood started to pour out of the deep cut in his shoulder and flowed onto the ground as his red Spirit Ring floated above his broken arm. It was soaked in blood and the original radiance had long been covered with blood, making it look extremely terrifying.

However, in just ten minutes, the outcome had already been determined!

Jun Wu Xie’s figure once again appeared in front of people. She was dressed in white and had already been stained with blood, but if one looked closely, it could be seen that although she had blood on her, none of it was hers.

At the same time, Ye Sha and the others killed several people from the Upper Realm. Broken corpse missing arms and legs splayed across the hall and the original glorious temple had transformed into a battlefield of hell at this moment. Death and blood covered everyone’s sight.

Nangong Lie forcibly suppressed the severe pain as he vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. Even standing now proved to be a difficult feat and required a lot of effort. The knees that kept buckling made his figure look extremely embarrassing. He clutched onto the broken arm and blood kept dripping from his fingers. The heat and stickiness that he felt under the palm of his hands were nothing compared to the excruciating pain he felt all over his body.

After fighting with Jun Wu Xie, he realized that the difference between the two was too terrible. Not only was there the disparity in their Spirit Rings, but Jun Wu Xie’s battle experience was not inferior to him one bit. Each and every move of hers was directed at his vital points, and each strike of hers was fatal. He had to give up one arm to save his life, but even so, Nangong Lie’s inner self-confidence had already crumbled and shattered into smithereens.

If one did not experience it first hand, they would never ever believe that such a young lass from the Middle Realm could actually defeat a Top Ten Master from the Upper Realm in such a short amount of time? !

“Are you really a person from the Middle Realm?” Nangong Lie gasped fiercely. After battling with Jun Wu Xie, he became more and more convinced that Jun Wu Xie really came from the Upper Realm. Her strength was terrible, even in the Upper Realm, it was difficult to find an adversary.

Jun Wuxie kept her Spirit Ring under the intense gaze of Nangong Lie, and her cold eyes swept over his face.

“No.”

Nangong Lie heaved a sigh of relief subconsciously.

“I am from the Lower Realm.” Jun Wu Xie’s words were like thunder to his ears and the last trace of rationality of Nangong Lie snapped!
