Chapter 2387: The Lackey of The Upper Realm (5)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The status of the Soul Masters who were in charge of the Soul Devourers were considered very high in the Soul World. Situ Heng’s words had made Qin Song and Long Jiu to fall completely into a state of panic that they had never experienced before.

The ten or more Soul Masters mentioned by Situ Heng were all people with high standing in the Soul World. There were even some of them who were holding the important authorities in their hands, causing the Spirit Tree to value them very much. If it wasn’t for them who had heard everything from Situ Heng with their own ears, they couldn’t actually believe that those Soul Masters would have the thought of rebellion and had already colluded with the Upper Realm...

The moment they thought that there were so many lackeys of the Upper Realm hiding in the Soul World now, Qin Song and Long Jiu couldn’t help but just shivered with a huge sense of fear overwhelming both of them.

At this moment, they felt so lucky to have Jun Wu Xie who had been always keeping a keen insight. If it wasn’t for Jun Wu Xie who insisted on interrogating Situ Heng, they were afraid that... they were still being kept in the dark.

“I didn’t really do anything for that person. I’m just a nobody. All I did was just to give them some of the medicinal pills from the Soul World, other than that... Other than that, I wasn’t a part of it!” Realizing that it was currently the worst situation for him, Situ Heng quickly dissociated himself from the case.

Unfortunately, Jun Wu Xie had already decided not to care about the things he said.

“I had always been feeling something strange since the time Wu Jiu and the fake Spirit Lord sneaked into the Spirit World. It was really difficult for the other spirits to pass through the special method of the Spirit World in selecting spirits. How could those spirits enter the Spirit World without the permission of the Spirit Lord? Now the truth has seemed to be revealed.” Jun Wu Xie slightly narrowed her eyes. She had never really expected that the Upper Realm would have gotten their claws into the Soul World and had already drawn quite a number of the Soul Master over to their side.

The expressions of Qin Song and Long Jiu were extremely terrible.

Suddenly, Qin Song stepped forward and said while looking at Jun Wu Xie. “Miss Jun, Old Nine and I need to return immediately to the Soul World now. Thanks for all the things you did today. The Soul World owes you once. After we’ve purged the traitors, we will definitely pay you back. We have to go now, farewell!”

Qin Song finished his words and straightaway left with Long Jiu without even looking back.

All the missions were not that important anymore compared to the safety of the Soul World. If the Soul World was destroyed, what was the point of them to find back the seed of the Spirit Tree?

While staring at the figure of Qin Song and Long Jiu leaving hurriedly from the back, the Spirit Lord could only let out a sigh.

“I didn’t really think that things would be this complicated.” The Spirit Lord frowned. If Jun Wu Xie failed to notice the suspicious point of Situ Heng and didn’t carry out any precautions, not even the relationship between the Lower Realm and the Spirit World would come to an end, the Soul World would also continue to be placed in a dangerous situation like this.

On the other side, Qiao Chu and the others, including all the generals from the Rui Lin Army, who had witnessed the whole process of the incident were completely astounded by the plot twist. Who among them would think that Jun Wu Xie had set such a layout together with the Spirit Lord to trick and fool Situ Heng around... and they had even discovered so many secrets.

“How are you going to handle this guy?” The Spirit Lord looked at Situ Heng who was kneeling on the floor, trembling in fear. The fact that Qin Song and Long Jiu left just like that had clearly shown that they weren’t going to care about Situ Heng. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

From the moment Situ Heng chose to sell himself out to the Upper Realm, he was not considered as a member of the Soul World anymore.

Either he was being killed or being skinned, it was all up to Jun Wu Xie.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me... I have told you everything you want.” Situ Heng looked nervously at Jun Wu Xie with his eyes full of pleading and begging.
