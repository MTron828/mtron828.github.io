“If so, then I don’t need to stay here for a long time. Highness Ying invited me to help you out. Now, it seems unnecessary.” Duan Qi said.

Bai Zhu’s face changed slightly, and he was just about to say something.

A guard suddenly rushed into the backyard and knelt in front of Bai Zhu.

“What’s the rush?” Bai Zhu frowned.

“An urgent war report has been sent from the front, please read my Lord!” said the guard.

“Expedited battle report?” Bai Zhu raised his eyebrows slightly, but a joy in his heart. He came to Sea Spirit City and this moment it should have been defeated. But how to find an excuse to keep Duan Qi in White Night City, he needed to think about it.

“Why don’t you take a look, Lord Bai?” said Duan Qi glancing over at Bai Zhu.

Bai Zhu laughed: “It’s not a big deal, the Sea Spirit City is destroyed, it’s just a small city.” said Bai Zhu. He took the battle report from the guard and smiled.

But this glance at the report made Bai Zhu’s face turn pale in an instant!

Duan Qi noticed Bai Zhu’s abnormality, “What’s wrong?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Bai Zhu’s complexion turned pale, and his breathing became quicker at this moment. He raised his eyes suddenly, his eyes filled with incredibleness and stared at the guard asking, “Where did this battle report come from?”

The guard did not know the content of the battle report, so he could only report accordingly: “The report was from Master Hu at the frontline.”

Master Hu mentioned by the guard was exactly the general sent by Bai Zhu to the Alliance.

“How can this be ... how can this be ...” Bai Zhu murmured as if he had lost his soul.

Duan Qi frowned slightly, reached out and took the battle report in Bai Zhu’s hand. After reading, even the seriousness on Duan Qi’s face suddenly collapsed.

“Dual Spirit Ring?” Duan Qi raised her eyes and looked at Bai Zhu.

Bai Zhu was already stunned, unable to answer Duan Qi’s words at all.

Jun Wu Xie turned out to be a Dual Spirit Ring exponent?

Bai Zhu only felt that there was a spin in his head. There was nothing more difficult for him to accept than the news. He was pretentious and intelligent, and even when Jun Wu Xie said he was going to become the overlord of the 72 cities, he was able to handle it freely, But now ...

Bai Zhu had no idea what to do next!

Although it’s known that Jun Wu Xie was the supreme Spirit Ring, the supreme Spirit Ring was rare and was not completely existen. Therefore Bai Zhu wanted to combine the power of the 72 cities to destroy Jun Wu Xie.

But...

When this Single Spirit Ring became a Dual Spirit Ring, the meaning became very different!

Looking at the Three Realms, the only Spirit Ring exponent previously was His Lord, and no one else.

The power of the Dual Spirit Ring had been regarded as the supreme strength.

However, now there was a second Dual Spirit Ring exponent.

What’s more terrible was that Bai Zhu had sent someone to attack the Sea Spirit City, which was tantamount to declaring war against a Dual Spirit Ring!

Bai Zhu had never regretted it like now. If he had known that Jun Wu Xie was a Dual Spirit Ring exponent, he would not dare to run against him even if he was given a hundred guts.

This was just looking for death!

In a single stroke, he killed tens of thousands of powerful men. How could they be brought down by the 72 cities?

“It’s over ... this time ... and it’s really over.” There was a grin on the corner of Bai Zhu’s mouth. He tried hard for many years, but he didn’t expect that he would miscalculate in Sea Spirit City, as if any related to the Sea Spirit City were far beyond their control.
