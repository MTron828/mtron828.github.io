From then on, the one that appeared before all the spirits was no longer him but that imposter.

Jun Wu Xie listened to it all quietly as she looked at the real Spirit Lord before her eyes. Putting together his words and those of Poison Ivy’s and her doubts, the truth of things was immediately unraveled!

No wonder the Spirit Lord’s character had changed so drastically in a short period of time. No wonder he had shown so much favour to the human spirits and Wu Jiu. The truth was that he was not the Spirit Lord afterall, but an imposter all along!

All the questions had their answers unraveled and the doubts from before dissipated together with the realization.

“Wu Jiu has played a really good game of chess.” Even Jun Wu Xie had to admire the amount of thought Wu Jiu had put into this. According to what Nalan Shan had said, Wu Jiu had stayed at the Spirit Lord’s side for about two thousand years’ time and in the one thousand years before he took over the position of the Spirit Master, he was actually able to pretend to live under another guise so well that the previous Spirit Master had not even noticed his real personality at all. And after he assumed the position of Spirit Master, he had gone on to use another nine hundred years to bewitch the Spirit Lord, to make the Spirit Lord relax his guard before he usurped it all at one go!

Holding the Spirit Lord in captivity. Such a maniacal deed. It was thought that besides Wu Jiu, no one else would be capable of that!

“That’s right, even I was taken in by him. He is indeed rather amazing.” The Spirit Lord said with a bitter laugh.

“What is he really after?” Jun Wu Xie was getting more confused the more she thought about it. The Spirit Lord ruled over all spirits and even though Wu Jiu was able to dream all of this up, from where did he come to find someone who could hold as much power as the Spirit Lord himself in replacement?

Having experienced the power of the imposter herself, Jun Wu Xie did not think that it was just a superficial pretense of assuming the Spirit Lord’s identity. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“He seeks to do something that will destroy the Three Realms.” The Spirit Lord said as his eyes narrowed slightly.

“What?” Jun Wu Xie’s exclaimed, her eyes widened.

“The Three Realms are made up of the Lower Realm Realm, the Middle Realm, and the Upper Realm. Although the Spirit World exists within the Three Realms, I myself, was from the Upper Realm. I am born from the Spirit Tree and before I created the Spirit World, I once roamed within the Upper Realm for a rather long time, and I would more or less know of quite a few things in the Upper Realm. From a very very long time ago, the Upper Realm had been hatching up a terrifying plot. They had wanted to present all living beings throughout the Three Realms up as a sacrifice, in order to deliver themselves up into another realm that no one is able reach, one that Wu Jiu mentioned earlier..... shattering the void.”

“Sacrifice..... the Three Realms?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes flared wide. What the Spirit Lord said was really just too astounding!

“That’s right. The true purpose of the Serene Spirit Towers is not anything else but a circle of power runes, totems set up for a sacrificial array. The Upper Realm seeks to use the Middle Realm as a link, to tie together all the power in the Three Realms, for them to achieve their aims for the sacrifice. When I first came to know about this, I thought that it was just a joke, as who could possibly achieve such a feat? A sacrifice of the Three Realms. How many lives would that be among all living beings? I had not believed it at all until the construction of the Serene Spirit Towers came about. That was when I finally understood that the Upper Realm’s plot was truly beginning.....” The Spirit Lord’s eyes were tightly shut. The extent of such an apocalyptical calamity was not something a normal person could imagine.

Once the Sacrificial Array was completed, then the entire Three Realms would have all living beings be reduced to ash, and with the exception of people playing a part in this plan, all humans, beasts, spirits, creatures, would become sacrifices in this grand plot, without any chances of surviving it!

An uncountable number of lives, in exchange for peerless and unmatched power for just a group of people. Such a thing, just sounded too incredulous and unimaginable, so cruel that it sent chills running through people!
