Chapter 3121 Xiao Xie 5

The young boy looked to be about right or nine and was very handsome, with Shen Yan Xiao’s eyebrows. Despite his young age, he had an impressive aura about him.

Little Mo Ye had been the apple of everyone’s eye since she was born and had never been scolded in such a way before. When faced with the fierce look of the older boy in front of her, she suddenly burst out crying.

“Boo hoo hoo...”

Her crying removed all the awkwardness in the yard but replaced it with panic as nobody knew what to do.

When Shen Yan Xiao saw the little girl who looked like Jun Wu Xie bawling, her heart went soft and turning to her own son, she suddenly slapped him across the face saying, “Who said you could be fierce to her?!”

The boy, after receiving the slap, looked at his mother in puzzlement, feeling quite wronged.

“Boo hoo hoo...I want my mother....boo hoo hoo....he was fierce to me....” Little Mo Ye was quite a pitiful sight, crying in her father’s arms.

At this moment, Shen Yan Xiao couldn’t take it any longer and urged Jun Wu Xie to comfort her child.

Jun Wu Xie picked up the red eyed child while wryly smiling and Little Mo Ye started to cry even more.

As Jun Wu Yao comforted his daughter from the side, the image of the happy family of three made Shen Yan Xiao feel a bit depressed.

“Alright, Satan is no longer who he used to be and I’m sure you don’t want that child to continue crying.” Di Xiu looked at Jun Wu Xie and smiled.

Shen Yan Xiao’s eyebrows were twisted into a knot.

“What about the things in the past? This guy has been a thorn in your side for many years.”

Di Xiu shook his head, “Would I have met you if not for him?”

Shen Yan Xiao’s face turned red.

One one side Shen Yan Xiao and Di Xiu were going back and forth and on the other, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were trying to comfort their daughter.

The boy who caused it all did not know what was happening.

Things seemed completely different from what he had imagined.

“Why are you still standing there? Quickly go and apologise to her!” Shen Yan Xiao glared at her son.

The boy resigned himself to his fate and went up to Jun Mo Ye saying, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be fierce to you, I just didn’t want you to say my mother is bad. Stop crying ok?”

Little Mo Ye looked at the older boy and wiped away a tear, asking, “Will you be fierce to me again in the future?”

The boy immediately shook his head.

Xiao Moye looked at her father and mother, and after getting some encouragement from them, slowly came down from Jun Wu Xie’s embrace and walked to the young boy, saying, “Then I can forgive you, but you have to tell me your name so that if you are fierce to me again in the future, I will carve your name on the back of a little turtle and let everyone laugh at you.”

The threat was spoken in all seriousness but instead made all the adults in the audience laugh.

The boy however, took it seriously and said, “I am Di Jing and I mean what I say.”

“Di Jing?” Xiao Mo Ye was confused.

Di Jing stepped forward, took Xiao Mo Ye’s small hand in his and wrote his name on her palm. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
