Chapter 2077: Face Slapping of the Ecstatic Rapture Palm (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Double Headed Bone Snake and the Great Ape joined in with the Yin Yang Bear’s mighty roar, the ear shattering sound causing the spectating crowd surrounding the battle to cringe in terror.

The Beast Spirits stared with their mouths agape at the three massive sized beasts who were at least of the eighth grade, their eyes wide, unable to believe what they were seeing.

“That is the..... Double Headed Bone Snake? I..... I know of him..... It wasn’t this massive before.....” A Beast Spirit actually recognized the Double Headed Bone Snake, but from its memory, the size of the Double Headed Bone Snake was not even half of the one here. The Double Headed Bone Snake that it knew had merely been a fifth grade Beast Spirit’s size and having not seen it for so many years..... it had grown to become so massive?

“That is the Yin Yang Bear..... My Heavens, what did it eat?” Another Beast Spirit recognized the Yin Yang Bear.

Similarly being Beast Spirits of the Spirit World, the Double Headed Bone Snake and the others would naturally have old acquaintances, but with the current way they looked, they were completely different from what the other Beast Spirits remembered.

Eighth grade Beast Spirits. You wouldn’t be able to find more than a few looking throughout the entire Spirit World and if the Double Headed Bone Snake and its companions had such power from long before, then all the Beast Spirits of the Spirit World would have known them.

In fact, when the Double Headed Bone Snake and the others had first come to Hua Yao and his companions, they were not as powerful as they were now. But through their experiences together as Qiao Chu and his comrades strengthened themselves, they had led the Double Headed Bone Snake and the others to become stronger as well. Especially in the period when they had been in the Dark Emperor’s tomb, Jun Wu Yao could have caused the Double Headed Bone Snake and the others to grow maniacally in passing when he had put the companions in a place to cultivate where the power of the spirit had been most intense in the tomb for an extended period of time, added to the fact that they had taken miraculous elixirs and medicines with effects that aided the growth of their spirits.

As the Double Headed Bone Snake never left Hua Yao’s side and they saw each other so very often, Hua Yao had not noticed the growth and changes that had come over the Double Headed Bone Snake much, where it was the same for Qiao Chu and the others.

Not Just the Double Headed Bone Snake, the Yin Yang Bear and the Great Ape had grown. Even the Hell Butterfly and Fan Zhuo’s Weapon Spirit had grown as well, but it was just that they had not noticed it.

The things they had not realized was discovered by the other Beast Spirits here. The Beast Spirits who were here intending only to watch the show were suddenly astounded by the terrifying growth of the Double Headed Bone Snake and the others, shocked as they stared with eyes wide and mouths hanging open.

Not to mention that they had gone to the mortal realm to have become Ring Spirits. Even if they had been able to go into the Serene Spirit Tower to cultivate, it was thought that the growth could still not have been so maniacal. Where would you see a Beast Spirit that could shoot from the fifth grade right up to the eighth grade in just a few short years! ?

Could those three fellas have taken some godly medicine! ?

The three massive Beast Spirits displayed their might before the eyes of their fellow Beast Spirits without holding back, standing at their respective Master’s side to defend them, using the powers and might accumulated from experience, to protect their beliefs!

“It’s you! The ones that rescued the brown bear back then was all of you!” Jiang Yun Long immediately recognized the three gigantic beasts with just one glance and the rage immediately bubbled and rose within his heart.

“So what if it’s us? You still did not have enough of a beating? Then we would not mind giving you another thrashing here today!” Qiao Chu opened his mouth to say evilly, as he looked tauntingly at Jiang Yun Long.

Jiang Yun Long just could not wait to skin that arrogant and wilful little kid alive!

“Jun Wu Xie, what do you mean by this?” Wu Jiu sensed that something was not right, and his eyes were narrowed as he asked.

Jun Wu Xie lifted an eyebrow and looked at Wu Jiu with almost patronizing arrogance.

“I’ve said it. I came here to settle scores.”

Wu Jiu gritted his teeth and then said with a laugh that stemmed from extreme anger: “Alright, I would like to see how you are going to settle scores with me. Not a single one of you present here today should even think of running away!”
