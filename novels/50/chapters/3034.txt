Chapter 3035 His Highness Ying 2

Jun Wu Xie looked at Gu Ying with a regular expression on her face.

Gu Ying chuckled, “I’m being rude, I didn’t mean to imply you are a woman, just that that woman is really powerful.” When he finished, Gu Ying looked up in the air, as if he was recalling something.

“I’ve been defeated by her several times, no matter how I prepared and planned. Although I hate to admit it, she’s the strongest opponent I’ve ever faced. All my failures and defeats have come from her, I hate her to her core, yet I have to say I admire and respect her at the same time. In life, we all face trials and tribulations and encounter many different people, to have an opponent like her makes life worth living.”

“Is that so? If Highness Ying truly likes to wage battles, then no matter how much you respect an enemy, they are still the enemy and an obstacle to overcome. A true life worth living, is not battling people but to live a peaceful life.” Jun Wu Xie said flatly, not taking any pride from Gu Ying’s words.

She could not understand what went through the minds of the people who loved to wage war and fight. For her, true happiness came from stability.

If there was peace on earth, it would not be a loss to give up all her skills. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Humans were by nature greedy and those who were content were most often happy.

Jun Wu Xie had been forced down a path full of thorns and it brought her no happiness, only fatigue.

She hoped for a day when all this was over and she could live a peaceful and quiet life.

“Lord Yan does not seem to like disputes?” Gu Ying asked with his eyebrows raised.

Jun Wu Xie responded calmly,”When two people fight, there will always be a winner and a loser. Even though the loser is defeated, the winner also pays a big price for the victory. That desire for winning will never be quenched, isn’t it?”

This was the first time that Jun Wu Xie and Gu Ying spoke to each other calmly. Every previous meeting between the two always involved a lot of conflict and hostility. After several fights, it was difficult to imagine that the two of them would ever have a calm conversation.

But such an opportunity was also based on Gu Ying’s ignorance of Jun Wu Xie’s identity.

If Gu Ying knew that the person standing in front of him was really the woman who he hated so much, even a half smile would not be revealed.

“Lord Yan has really a good temperament, but it seems unsuitable for this world.” Gu Ying’s eyes narrowed slightly, his eyes flashed an unmistakable chill.

“You may wish for a quiet life but others may not grant it to you. Sometimes you have to do what is needed, taking you for an example, conquering the 72 Cities, defeating the Top Ten Exponents and killing Long Yao has stained your hands with much blood. In this world, there is nobody who is truly clean, as long as you are alive, you will have to keep fighting, no matter what.”

Jun Wu Xie spoke no further, she and Gu Ying had a fundamental difference in philosophies and even without the previous conflicts, there would be no chance of them being friends.

“Ah, I’ve misspoken and indulged in frivolity that is not to City Lord Yan’s interest. I have not yet congratulated you on becoming a Knight of Destruction.” Gu Ying clasped his hands together in a respectful manner.
