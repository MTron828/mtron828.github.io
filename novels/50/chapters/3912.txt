Chapter 2508: Annihilation (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Yan Hai could not believe that one this lone island, he would actually meet someone who possessed a Spirit Ring.

Throughout the entire Upper Realm, there were no more than one hundred people who could condense a complete Spiritual Ring. Each was an extremely strong, vicious person, and they were very well-known. Who would stay in such a ridiculous place?

In an instant, Yan Hai, who was initially arrogant, was stunned. Even though he was ignorant, he understood the disparity between that person and him.

He had never condensed Spiritual Inscriptions, how could he fight against a Spiritual Ring bearer?

Yan Hai’s expression immediately changed.

“This little one failed to recognize esteemed senior and I did not know that this is senior’s territory. We encountered a storm and had no choice but to come onto the island. I hope senior won’t blame us.” Yan Hai’s expression changed, even faster than flipping the page of a book. Before, he was so arrogant, but upon seeing that the other party possessed a Spirit Ring, he became as honest as a soft-shelled turtle. Gone was the haughtiness from his face, instead only reverence was shown, the only thing missing was him kneeling on the ground and licking Zi Fei’s feet.

With regard to Yan Hai’s adulation, the others from Sea Spirit City did not hold a trace of disgust, one by one they bowed with extreme deferential, and dared not show any dissatisfaction.

Regardless of the other party had just killed their comrades, they weren’t angry but feared the other party’s strength.

This was the rule to survive in the Upper Realm.

Zi Fei stood unmoving on the shore. If it were anyone else, she would have let them roll out of the island. But these Sea Spirit City people..... NO WAY!

“Put away your disgusting faces, today, none of you will leave here alive.” Zi Fei coldly proclaimed. She was indebted to the Sea Spirit Beasts, and yet Sea Spirit City were the ones who murdered these beasts. Countless of Sea Spirit Beasts in the Sea of Death had perished by the hands of Sea Spirit City. The number of carcasses contained within the two ships were unknown as well.

Facing the innocent Sea Spirit Beasts, did they show a shred of mercy?

Did they think to release these innocent Spirit Beasts?

NO!

Bloodletting, skinning, breaking bones, cutting out flesh.

These were all the forms of torture bestowed upon the Sea Spirit Beasts by the people of Sea Spirit City. Even the ignorant and vulnerable little cubs were not spared. How could Zi Fei spare this group of executioners?

“Senior, if you are unhappy, please let us know. We have no intention to offend you. Why....threaten us...” A drop of cold sweat oozed out on Yan Hai’s forehead. He was simply unaware of the reason for Zi Fei’s killing intent. If it was because of his earlier disrespect, he was perfectly fine to prostrate and apologize.

“Stop spouting rubbish!” Zi Fei intoned coldly, as she lifted the longbow in her hand once again.

Yan Hai panicked immediately!

His brain flipped and suddenly exclaimed, “Please have mercy! Please have mercy! Let’s talk calmly, Senior! We are from the Sea Spirit City, and we have many Sea Spirit Beasts on board our ships. If you let us go, we will give them to you as a tribute, as an apology from us from disturbing you!”

Sea Spirit Beasts were in great demand in the Upper Realm. Yan Hai wanted to protect himself, and he would rather exchange two ship-loads of Sea Spirit Beasts for a way to survive.

It was known that in the Upper Realm, killing people was the most natural and common thing.

Zi Fei suddenly lowered her hand holding the longbow, her eyes which shone through the mask did not reflect any emotions. She suddenly said, “How many Sea Spirit Beasts do you have onboard your ships?”

Yan Hai seized this opportunity as he hurriedly replied, “A total of one hundred and seventy eight beasts are onboard our vessels!”
