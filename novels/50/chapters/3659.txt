Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A cold glint flashed by her eyes as she looked at Ye Gu. He took in a deep breath before telling her everything that Jun Wu Yao had prepared before he was taken.

Jun Wu Xie listen quietly, after hearing everything, she still remained silent.

Ye Gu and Ye Sha stood by the side nervously, they had long arrived in the vicinity but had never assisted. It was not because they did not want to but because they could not, the order that Jun Wu Yao had left behind could not be defied. They were waiting silently, up to the moment when she had escaped, however the current her had made their hearts startled. They did not know if after experiencing all this, would she truly be like what Jun Wu Yao had said....

After the long silence, Jun Wu Xie tried to sit up. She had been placed on a straw mat, her wounds had already been dressed by them but because her injuries were too severe, they did not dare to move her too much which was why they had not left immediately.

“Have you seen the people from the Spirit Jade Palace?” Jun Wu Xie had finally said something, but her tone was too calm that it was scary.

“No, Master Ren Huang’s self... self explosion was...too powerful, Ye Mei held you and was directly flung to the foot of the mountain, as for the people of the Spirit Jade Palace, I’m afraid that...” Ye Sha’s voice was faint and trembling, this time, it was too cruel. From Ye Mei’s mouth, they had learned that she could escape this time round was all because of Ren Huang’s sacrifice. He had used ten thousand years worth of cultivation to blow himself up, the might of the explosion was too powerful, even Gold Spirits could not stop it.

In such a dire situation, that was the only way that could save more people.

There was nothing wrong with Ren Huang’s choice, but... He was Jun Wu Xie’s Grand Master...

Ye Sha and Ye Gu had thought that she would break down after knowing all of these, however, she was unexpectedly calm. She only lowered her head and looked at her left hand, and on that little hand that was stained with blood, there was a blue Spirit Ring that was glowing, that Spirit Ring was the one that Ren Huang had!

When they saw that Spirit Ring, their hearts thundered in shock!

In a moment, they understood everything.

Before Ren Huang had self-destructed, he had embedded his own Spirit Ring into Jun Wu Xie’s body and had brought her back from the brink of death. Otherwise, he was afraid that with her severe injuries, she would...

“Where are they?” She suddenly asked.

Ye Sha and Ye Gu was stunned momentarily before they looked at each other and saw the same cognition in each other’s gaze.

Who she was referring to was definitely not the people from the Spirit Jade Palace but...

“Young Miss, please wait a moment.” Ye Gu bent slightly before straightening his back as he raised his hands and clapped!

Suddenly, a cluster of flames rushed out from the dark forest and countless black figures appeared under the moonlight! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In just but the blink of an eye, a team of men with towering stature and cold face, each one of them wore a black light, their gazes chilling and fierce.

Ye Gu immediately knelt down in front of Jun Wu Xie!

“The Night Regime pays our respect to Young Miss!”

Swish!

Behind Ye Gu, the team of men knelt down uniformly right after he spoke, all lined up neatly before her!

Jun Wu Xie’s cold gaze swept over them, that was the Night Regime that had once shaken the entire Middle Realm! She tightened her grip on the Spirit Ring in her hand.
