Chapter 2170: Secret History of the Nine Temples (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Su Jing Yan was trembling, although Jun Wu Yao spoke with a smile, yet all he felt was unprecedented fear.

“How do you know... all these...” Su Jing Yan looked at Jun Wu Yao apprehensively. Towards the Dark Emperor, the Middle Realm knew very little about him. The Dark Emperor suddenly appeared in the Middle Realm which he then suppressed it with absolute strength. Initially, the Nine Temples thought that the Dark Emperor was also sent by the Upper Realm and was ready to reach out to him, in the end, they were utterly crushed under his violent oppression ...

Who was the Dark Emperor?

No one in the Middle Realm knows and his very existence was a huge mystery.

However, he knew the Three Realms like the back of his hands; he even knew the secret of the Nine Temples so clearly.

“Don’t ask me how do I know, you just need to answer my question. I think... you shouldn’t want to suffer too much?” Jun Wu Yao narrowed his eyes, as he slightly lifted his hand that was on his lap. A dark spirit suddenly appeared at his fingertips.

When Su Jing Yan saw the dark spirit, his face immediately paled to a shade of white. The dark spirit of the Dark Emperor was not the same as spirit energy. This mysterious power had evoked a whole new wave of fear in the Middle Realm.

“You...you’ve guessed it. The Nine Temples are dissatisfied with the practice of the Upper Realm.” Su Jing Yan gnashed his teeth, he was very clear, even if he does not say it, there would be other ways to make him open his mouth.

“When the Palace Lords first came to the Middle Realms, they were really loyal to the Upper Realm. Without knowing what kind of array they were going to construct, they simply followed the orders...”

Due to their loyalty to the Upper Realm, the Nine Lords of the Nine Temples never questioned a thing. They were like monsters without feelings, and everything was done in accordance with the instructions of the Upper Realm.

The construction of the Nine Temples, the strengthening of the forces, the engraving of the rune totems, and the hiding their own origins have nothing to do with them. For thousands of years, they have been doing this. In order to hide their own defects, they even married wives, and they raised their babies. These were originally intended to cover up their secrets, but after thousands of years passed, these eventually melted the hearts of the nine people.

For people that uphold loyalty, their heart wouldn’t be too bad, hence when they watched their adopted babies grow up to children, calling them father with a crisp voice... emotions other than loyalty started to manifest in their hearts.

These changes were quietly happening. They began to have more feelings. Although they couldn’t have their own children, they also fell in love with those gentle companions of theirs, and also loved the children who called them fathers...

Without knowing, these changes in their hearts made them start to think about their wives and children. When they gradually realized the real purpose of the Upper Realm, there was a crack in their loyalty.

How cruel was that? For them who had spent thousands of years in the Middle Realm, how could they bear it?

Although their wives and children could not accompany them for life, their grandchildren and generation after generations continued on. The hearts of the nine had been eroded with emotions and they couldn’t bear to destroy all of this.

But after all, they had all came from the Upper Realm and know how powerful the strength of the Upper Realm was. Even if they don’t want to, they couldn’t change anything with the ability of just nine of them. Hence, they chose to be perfunctory, as much as possible. To try to delay the arrival of that nightmare.
