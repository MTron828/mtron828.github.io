Like a ghost, Jun Wu Xie’s speed was so fast that the people in the hall had no time to react. The elites of the Upper Realm who were smug before the arrival of Jun Wu Xie had turned into a herd of lambs waiting to be slaughtered. Even though Jun Wu Xie had killed their companion in their presence, they could not even reach out to lend a hand to rescue.

At this moment, Jun Wu Xie revealed her Spirit Ring and her movements were even faster than before. She was so fast that they did not even have time to react. They could only open their eyes wide and gritted their teeth in anguish as they tried to follow her figure and see her actions.

However, in the entire hall, except for Nangong Lie, no one could capture the figure of Jun Wu Xie. The elites of the Upper Realm could not, not to mention the elders of the Nine Temples!

The red light and the dark green light were in the midst of battle in the middle of the hall. The nine elders of the Nine Temples had already been scared by the battle between the Spirit Rings. There was no need to mention going forward, just by standing on both sides of the main hall, they were already vomiting blood out from the pressure left by the afterglow of the lights and the strong air pressure made it even difficult for them to stand up.

“Damn it! We can’t let this little bitch succeed! Let’s go!” One of the people from the Upper Realm hollered out, even though they were arrogant, they could see that the strength of Nangong Lie’s Spirit Ring was not as powerful as Jun Wu Xie’s. The two could still fight, but the disparity in the Spirit Ring would soon turn the situation into a one-sided situation. Reaching such a point, they no longer cared about anything else and could only rush forward, wanting to use their numbers to their advantage and take Jun Wu Xie down!

However, before the several people from the Upper Realm had yet to approach the battle, several black shadows had blocked them in an instant.

“If you want to intervene, you all still don’t deserve it.” Ye Gu lifted up his chin in arrogance as a sneer hung on the corner of his mouth. He looked at the people who wanted to rush forward with disdain. Ye Sha and the Ye Mei stood on the left and right, and the three of them had completely blocked off the path of those people from the Upper Realm.

“Who are you!” The people from the Upper Realm screamed out, they had not even noticed when had these three people had appeared.

“Who are we?” Ye Gu raised his eyebrows and said, “Naturally, we are the ones who want to kill you. Remember, we are the Night Regime and after you’ve entered hell, don’t forget to tell Hades that it was us, the Night Regime who slaughtered you guys!”

The arrogant words of Ye Gu made the faces of the people of the Upper Realm turn blue as they roared with gusto and rushed toward the three of them!

Standing at the side, the people of the Nine Temples looked at everything that unfolded before them, in a flash, the entire hall had turned into a fierce battlefield, and the battle was so brutal that there was no room for them to even intervene!

“Elder Su, looking at all of this...do we...” The elder of the Obscure Soul Temple who was scared witless from everything as he looked at Su Jing Yan apprehensively. Su Jing Yan had survived twice after meeting Jun Wu Xie, and the elders of the Nine Temples had all subconsciously asked Su Jing Yan for advise.

Su Jing Yan blinked his eyes and constantly mobilized his whole body’s spiritual power to resist the aftermath of the shocks. He could not see the battle between Jun Wu Xie and Nangong Lie, but he was very clear about one thing.

Jun Wu Xie’s proclamation to wash the Nine Temples with blood would be proven to be a success very soon. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Don’t intervene.” Su Jing Yan said in a low voice as he stepped back. The elders of the Nine Temples standing behind him also followed suit. Obviously, they had chosen to follow Su Jing Yan’s decision in panic.

The Upper Realm were enemies and not friends of the Nine Temples, the previous obedience was only a forced choice.
