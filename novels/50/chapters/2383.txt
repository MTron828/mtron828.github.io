Chapter 2384: The Upper Realm’s lackey（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Situ Heng’s allegiance...was pledged to the Upper Realm? What did Jun Wu Xie just say?!

“What nonsense are you sprouting!” Situ Heng glared at Jun Wu Xie hatefully.

“It seems that you do not seem to want to answer this second question.” Jun Wu Xie stood up and her figure suddenly disappeared in front of everyone.

While everyone still hadn’t recovered from the sudden turn of events, a shrill scream resounded out in the large room!

Jun Wu Xie suddenly appeared beside Situ Heng and swiftly twisted his arms behind his back and slammed her knee against his waist. Situ Heng immediately crumbled to the ground. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The black cat jumped off her shoulder at the same time and it spat out a little red ball, using its furry tail to hold it.

As soon as he saw that little red ball, Situ Heng’s face turned white in an instant!

“There were a total of ten rounds of treatment, except for the first round, you’ve administered a total of nine doses of the Soul Devourer to me. I still have seven in my hands, would you like to try this evil fruit that you’ve reaped yourself?” With just one hand, she buckled both his hands behind him and used the other to forcibly yank his head up with his hair. The moment his head was raised with his mouth agape, the black cat’s tail swished over and all it needed to do was to gently release it and the Soul Devourer would fall into his mouth!

“Miss Jun!” Qin Song saw that the situation did not look right and hurriedly called out to stop it!

No matter what, Situ Heng was after all a spirit from the Soul World.

Jun Wu Xie raised her gaze and looked at the nervous Qin Song before she said in a faint voice: “Are you sure that you want to plead for this lackey of the Upper Realm?”

Qin Song froze upon hearing her words.

A lackey of the Upper Realm...

Qin Song’s gaze landed on Situ Heng, the Soul Devourer was specially managed by a spirit of special status from the Soul World. Even if it was he himself, he would not be able to take possession of it. However, it was a fact that this Soul Devourer had indeed appeared in the hands of Situ Heng, although he had no idea how. The points which she shared earlier about how Situ Heng was provoking the relationship between the Spirit World and the Lower Realm, it did raise some suspicions because those were beyond the scope of his duties.

If he said that he was full of amnesty towards Jun Wu Xie, Qin Song could still understand but as for provoking the relationship.... It was not something they should do.

Qin Song hesitated and if Jun Wu Xie’s conjuncture was right...then...

“Miss Jun, before things have been ascertained, the hope that you do not make things too difficult for Situ Heng, after all he is from the Soul World.” Although Qin Song said it in a careful manner, in his heart he had already been shocked by Jun Wu Xie’s power.

Towards Jun Wu Xie’s cultivation over the past five years, they were the ones who were most clear about it. However, she had never displayed her full strength in front of them, they only had a rough gauge on her abilities.

However, never would they have ever thought that she could bring Situ Heng down a single move!

One had no that although Situ Heng was not among the best in the Soul World, he had already entered the ranks of the strong. However, he was not even able to take one strike from her, such a level of strength... had really frightened Qin Song.

Qin Song was now certain that even he could not contend against her.

In just a span of five years... Jun Wu Xie’s growth was simply too terrifying!

Jun Wu Xie looked up at Qin Song and looked back at Situ Heng who was pinned beneath before she lifted her chin slightly. Only then did the black cat swish its tail away and kept the Soul Devourer.

Seeing her action, both Qin Song and Long Jiu were secretly relieved.

Situ Heng was incomparably frightened, since he dared to use the Soul Devourer, he knew how terrible it was. How would he dare to swallow it?
