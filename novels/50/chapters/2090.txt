Chapter 2091: Face Slapping of the Ecstatic Rapture Palm (18)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Wu Jiu saw with his own eyes Jun Wu Xie rescuing the Spiritual Bear and rage boiled up in his heart. His teeth tightly gritted together, Wu Jiu stared at that figure that was closing in on him at the speed of light, and his eyes were dripping with malice!

“Jun Wu Xie! You dare to spoil all that I’ve done!” The moment his voice dropped, Wu Jiu went charging towards Jun Wu Xie.

The two figures one black and one silver immediately tangled up in battle in midair!

The violent and intense clash came to affect the battlefield as wild winds blew and kicked up endless dust.

Rong Ruo sent a human spirit close to her flying with a kick as Fei Yan came close from the side.

“Why is it that Little Xie is still able to use the Face of Selvan?” Fei Yan and Rong Ruo were fighting with their backs to each other. Having the Face of Selvan appear on the battlefield had not only turned the tide of battle but it had also given the companions quite a shock.

Ever since they had turned into spirits, their flesh bodies had been left behind which included their magical artifacts that they had not been able to bring with them. Back when Jun Wu Xie had used the Face of Selvan to save Nalan Shan before, they had not paid all that much attention to it. But now, they saw that Jun Wu Xie was not just able to just use a little bit of the Face of Selvan’s power, as from the moment Selvan’s armour appeared, they came to realize that being in spirit form had not restricted Jun Wu Xie much and that she was able to completely utilize every single technique of the Face of Selvan!

Rong Ruo furrowed her brows slightly as she looked at Wu Jiu and Jun Wu Xie battling so ferociously in the air.

“I don’t know, but only Little Xie is able to take on Wu Jiu now. Wu Jiu’s powers had increased in a very strange manner that had gone beyond the realm of Spirit Outflare. Regardless of how Little Xie is able to use the Face of Selvan, to all of us, that’s good news.”

Fei Yan nodded his head, naturally having realized that the current circumstances did not allow them to nitpick on things too much.

“End this battle as quickly as possible and bring Brownie away from here. The Hell Butterfly has detected that the human spirit reinforcements are approaching and if this drags on, we’ll all be finished.” Rong Ruo said with her brows creased together, the information the Hell Butterfly transmitted to her making her feel highly uneasy.

“Sure!” Fei Yan replied, and his attacks immediately grew more ferocious.

The battle reached its most intense moments with the Beast Spirits, human spirits, Weapon Spirits and the Plant Spirits all entangled within. If it continued to drag on, the battle would grow unbounded, that could even spread throughout the entire Spirit World!

Wu Jiu’s heart was filled with surprise when he discovered that Jun Wu Xie’s powers was stronger than he had imagined, the additional power the Selvan’s armour gave was so strong it astounded him!

“Why do you have the Face of Selvan! ? What relations do you have with the Dark Emperor! ?” Wu Jiu was getting rather flustered by his fight with Jun Wu Xie, as he gave voice to the thoughts in his heart with a frustrated roar. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jun Wu Xie’s heart startled, but she composed herself very quickly.

She had been so hesitant to use the Face of Selvan all this time because she was worried that having the Face of Selvan make an appearance might attract suspicion. With the immeasurable amount of magical artifacts the Dark Emperor possessed, not all of them were widely known by others. But with the Face of Selvan being one of the ten greatest magical artifacts, it would definitely not go unnoticed by people.

If not for the fact that Wu Jiu’s methods had come to anger Jun Wu Xie, she would not have recklessly used the Face of Selvan. But with things having come to such a stage, she could no longer remain so apprehensive!

Unable to get the answer that he seeked, Wu Jiu could only continue to battle Jun Wu Xie. But as being in spirit form was still not the same as fighting in her flesh body, though she possessed powerful might, she was still restricted to a certain extent. Damage suffered by spirit bodies with every injury was not blood, but was a constant drain on the power of the spirit. But Jun Wu Xie’s Selvan’s Armour was extraordinarily tough and with attacks delivered purely just with the power of the spirit, Wu Jiu was unable to break the Face of Selvan in the slightest.
