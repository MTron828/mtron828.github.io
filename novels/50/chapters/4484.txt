God of Destruction’s laughter dissipated. He narrowed his eyes as he stared at Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie in front of him. Suddenly, he suddenly laughed again. This time, he laughed very strangely. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“How ... how could I be so careless?”

The God of Destruction pressed on the handle of the chair. The ground on both sides of his throne suddenly opened. Four golden and cylindrical columns rose from the open gap, while on the raised golden pillar, circling four light balls of different colors.

The balls of light, about the size of an egg, exuded a faint halo and suspended above the pillar.

The God of Destruction raised his hand and took the red sphere that was closest to him. The light sphere was like a flame held in the hand by the God of Destruction.

“This one is Chi Yan. He was my first chosen Knight of Destruction and one of my favorite works. He used to be the King of the Upper Realm, the true King, a strong co-created by me and the God of Light. He is a just, strict and benevolent king. But it’s a pity that the Upper Realm no longer needs him as a king. There is only one real King and that’s me. So I captured his benevolence and memory and made him a faithful dog to me. ”

“Look, he used to love his people very much. But in the end, he was captured by the heart of love. As long as I give any order, he will never hesitate to execute, even if it is the slaughtering of the people he once loved. Pushing his own wife and children into the fire, he would not have any hesitation ... ” The God of Destruction’s eyes fell on the red light ball, and the red color reflected on his eyes, making him look extremely malevolent.

The God of Destruction’s words made Jun Wu Xie’s heart quake. She did not forget what her mother had said before. Han Zi Fei once said that His Lord took away Jun Gu’s soul before he could be cultivated as a Knight of Destruction.

Jun Wu Xie was not clear of the reason behind it. At this moment, she had a hunch that God of Destruction’s next words would soon solve the doubts in her mind.

“It’s a pity that I always admire Chi Yan. After all, he is so loyal to me.” There was a slight opening in the mouth of God of Destruction, but there was no slight regret or loss in his eyes.

He lightly tossed the red sphere of light under his feet. The moment the sphere fell to the ground, a golden divine power sprang out of his fingertips, breaking the sphere of light instantly.

The crimson sphere of light turned into a red light in a flash, scattered on the ground, glowing with a little light. But after an instant, it vanished thoroughly.

“But he is dead, and this thing is useless for me to keep.” The God of Destruction said harshly without any remorse. He then reached out and took a silver-white light ball in his hand, his gaze fell on that one. There was a daze as he looked at the light ball, but calmness was restored after a while.

“This one belongs to Ying, a beautiful but stupid Ying. It was her such a beautiful look at the beginning that attracted that silly God of Light and gave me such a chance. I hate to thank her for it. So even if it was after destroying the body of God of Light, I did not kill her. I deprived her of her memory and her face that had turned the God of Light into a soul, allowing her to stay in the Sacred City and live. She should thank me ... after all ... I was so benevolent for the first time ... ” The God of Destruction’ cackled as he smiled deviously.
