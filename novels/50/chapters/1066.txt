Chapter 1067: “You’re Kidding (2)”

Ye Sha and Ye Mei sent in the food very quickly into Jun Wu Xie’s room. Compared to that pair’s culinary skills, the food brought in earlier from the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall’s kitchen could really only be described as totally unpalatable.

Finally being able to eat, Jun Wu Xie did not say a single word.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie’s profile as she enjoyed the feast and even before picking up his chopsticks, he already felt full.

Before they had even finished the meal, a knock sounded on Jun Wu Xie’s door and Jun Wu Yao got up to open the door.

Qing Yu who was standing outside, had upon seeing Jun Wu Yao’s attractive looking face which had a smile plastered upon it, immediately shivered involuntarily.

“Is anything the matter?” Jun Wu Yao’s face was smiling, but the gaze from that pair of eyes seemed to be telling Qing Yu, [Report if there’s something, scram if nothing.]

Qing Yu gulped noisily and said: “People from the Heavenly Cloud Chambers are here, saying they would like to invite Jun Xie to go over for dinner.”

Qing Yu’s voice had barely dropped when Jun Wu Yao’s eyes suddenly flashed brightly with intense murder!

The murderous aura caused Qing Yu to instantly hold his breath, and his face immediately turned white.

From inside the room, Jun Wu Xie had heard Qing Yu’s words clearly. The words “Heavenly Cloud Chambers” had completely ruined her appetite.

‘“I refuse.” Jun Wu Xie said coldly. She didn’t feel like seeing Qu Xin Rui in the slightest at that moment.

“Heard that?” Jun Wu Yao said, looking at Qing Yu with an eyebrow raised. Qing Yu immediately nodded his head and did not dare protest in the least as he ran away as if in escape.

Jun Wu Yao closed the door shut and looked at Jun Wu Xie who had lost her appetite.

“Dumb Qiao and the others have not sent back news which should mean they are already on their tail. It won’t be much longer before they will find out where those people have been imprisoned and there is no need for me to go deal with Qu Xin Rui now.” Jun Wu Xie said expressionlessly, as if she was explaining to Jun Wu Yao why she had suddenly refused Qu Xin Rui’s invitation.

“Don’t go if you don’t want to. Looking at that face will only spoil your appetite. You should rather look at me, it will make the food go down easier.” Jun Wu Yao said smilingly, the flash of murder in his eyes earlier seemingly just an illusion.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Jun Wu Yao and then silently lowered her head to continue eating.

Outside the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall, Shen Chi’s face was smiling as he waited to escort Jun Xie to the Heavenly Cloud Chambers. But after waiting for a while, he saw only Qing Yu coming out from the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall alone.

“Apologies, Young Master Jun just had his dinner and I’m afraid he would not be able to dine with the Great Aunt today.” Qing Yu said regretfully as he looked at Shen Chi.

The smile on Shen Chi’s face immediately turned into one of displeasure as he looked inside the Fiery Blaze Clan Hall and the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer. “Since that is the case, I shall then be making my way back.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll see you out.” Qing Yu said politely.

Shen Chi turned around and left before Qing Yu heaved a sigh of relief, but a growing worry rose within his heart at the same time. Shen Chi’s expression had not been pretty when he left just now and if even Shen Chi had such a reaction, he wondered when Jun Xie’s refusal reached Qu Xin Rui’s ears, what kind of consequences would that bring about.

In the Heavenly Cloud Chambers, Shen Chen told the news that Jun Wu would not be coming to Qu Xin Rui and sitting at her dressing table as she enjoyed the favoured men combing out her hair, Qu Xin Rui’s facial expression immediately turned gloomy.

“She’s not coming?”

“Right.” Shen Chen replied.

Qu Xin Rui snorted in disdain and the aura around her body turned highly dangerous. Standing right behind her, the favoured man’s hand trembled and broke one strand of Qu Xin Rui’s hair by mistake.

Qu Xin Rui immediately shot to her feet and kicked that favoured man onto the ground.

“Useless trash!”
