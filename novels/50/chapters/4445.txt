Chapter 3041 The Lost Temples 1

When it was time to leave, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao met Chi Yan and the rest at the agreed location. When they arrived, there were throngs of people at the city gate.

Whether it was by coincidence or not, Chi Yan, Su Rui Ying and Gu Ying each brought along someone, which made Jun Wu Yao’s presence seem not out of the ordinary.

Su Rui Ying had brought along the ghoul masked man whom Jun Wu Xie had met previously. That man, even when standing in the morning light, still gave people a creepy feeling. He did not look people in the eyes but instead just looked at them quickly before retracting his gaze.

It was the person standing next to Gu Ying that surprised Jun Wu Xie.

Standing next to Gu Ying was a beautiful woman. She was looking at Jun Wu Xie as she approached but hurriedly looked away when Jun Wu Xie made eye contact. She was beautiful but seemed devoid of life and stood like a giant puppet next to Gu Ying.

The wooden expression on her face contrasted sharply with the smile on Gu Ying’s face.

Gu Ying broke into a smile when he saw Jun Wu Xie approach but the woman next to him remained motionless.

“Lord Yan, you are the last one to arrive.” Bathed in the morning light and with a beaming smile on his face, Gu Ying looked almost angelic. The familiar tone he used would make a casual observer think they had known each other for many years before that day.

Jun Wu Xie gave Gu Ying a passive look and the nonplussed reaction created a sharp contrast to Gu Ying’s enthusiasm.

The plainly dressed man next to Chi Yan had been staring unblinkingly at Jun Wu Xie since she arrived, not seeming to care if anybody noticed. He seemed to harbour great animosity towards Jun Wu Xie.

“Lord Chi Yan, is that young man the newly appointed Knight of Destruction?” the man asked Chi Yan in a whispering tone.

Chi Yan looked at Jun Wu Xie and gave a slight nod of his head. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“It is quite unbelievable that he is able to have Dual Spirit Rings at such a young age. I have investigated what you instructed me to previously and although I still don’t have a definite answer, there are some results.” the man reported softly. He was Chi Yan’s top bodyguard whose power was advanced but in a place like the Sacred City where top masters were abound, he could never be more than that.

But nobody would have expected that Chi Yan, leader of the Knights of Destruction, would rely on such a man and even treated him as a confidant in whom he confided his troubles.

The man’s name was Qin Qi and he was once the deputy City Lord of one of the 72 Cities. However he made some mistakes and was on the run from the City Lord. While on the run he met Chi Yan, gained his favour and started serving him ever since.

Even though His Lord had given them an important mission, Chi Yan still decided to bring Qin Qi along.

His strength was quite low so there was no reason for his presence other than Qin Qi having an information network that could bring him news from all over the Three Realms.
