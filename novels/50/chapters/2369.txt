Jun Wu Xie looked puzzledly at Qiao Chu. She then moved her sight to Corpse Flower. It seemed like Corpse Flower had noticed that Jun Wu Xie was looking at him, the struggle on his face suddenly disappeared and his eyes began to avoid hers, not having the guts to make eye contact with Jun Wu Xie.

“What did he do again?” The black cat asked instead of Jun Wu Xie, swaying its tail like it had long accustomed to incidents like this.

With his face showing clearly that he was holding in his laughter, Qiao Chu cleared his throat and said in a way of pretending to be serious. “It’s not a big deal. To sum everything up, it’s still a good habit, just that the thing comes along with the habit is really...”

It turned out that although Corpse Flower looked powerful and burly, he actually had a virtuous character inside him. For the few days of Jun Wu Xie not being around, her ring spirits would either return to their homes to meet their friends or stay in Jun Wu Xie’s room, waiting for her to come back.

Corpse Flower belonged to the latter. He didn’t go anywhere else but just stayed in the house while the other five of them went outside. But today, the moment the five of them opened the door of her room after coming back, they almost fainted collectively due to his fumigation!

Jun Wu Xie’s room was suffused with strong rotten smell and there was Corpse Flower in the room, working hard to clean the room with his hand holding a broom and at the same time, singing a tuneless song!!

The breath he puffed out was just...

Just imagine a whole room filled with this smell, how “refreshing” it was!

No wonder Corpse Flower would get on everyone’s nerves and was whipped while being hung on the tree. Just think about it, five ring spirits were returning to Jun Wu Xie’s room in a relaxing mood and before they could even check out whether or not their Mistress was in the room, they were first welcomed by the “hugs and kisses” which was breathed out by Corpse Flower. The speciality of his greeting method! Nobody would ever top that!

While Qiao Chu was busy babbling, Corpse Flower seemed embarrassed. Despite being hung in mid-air, he stretched his hands and covered his masculine face...

He... really didn’t mean to do it. He was just thinking of cleaning the house so that it would be looking neat and tidy before Jun Wu Xie returned. He thought that since Little Lotus and the rest of the ring spirits weren’t coming back for these few days, it was okay for him to sing for “only” one or two sentences. At worse, he could ventilate the room by opening the windows before they came back. Well, flower proposes, but God disposes, who would know that...

The corners of Jun Wu Xie’s lips twitched a bit. This was actually not her first time experiencing Corpse Flower’s so called hobby. During the time Corpse Flower had just become her ring spirit, she didn’t know about the power of him opening his mouth so she didn’t really care about it. Until the moment she found out that Corpse Flower was good at doing housework, and the thing he loved the most was to sing when he was cleaning...

Since then, she never allowed Corpse Flower to touch the broom, not even a bit.

Nobody would ever think that Corpse Flower’s hobby would once again appear.

Staring at the door which was wide opening, Jun Wu Xie had totally lost her mood to go back to her house. Even though the house was still a little distance away from her, she was able to smell faintly of the weird odor. It was like multiple dead bodies were hidden inside her room.

“Mistress...” Little Lotus raised his head pitifully and looked at Jun Wu Xie, trying to plead for her forgiveness towards Corpse Flower.

Jun Wu Xie gently rubbed on his little head. She then turned her head and looked at Qiao Chu who was laughing cheerfully at the other side.

“I am going to stay in your room tonight.”

“Huh?!” At the very moment, Qiao Chu’s face turned pale!

Jun Wu Xie was going to sleep in his room... This... He still didn’t want to die at such a young age!

“Just go and squeeze a room with Brother Hua,” said Jun Wu Xie.

“...” Qiao Chu widened his eyes and turned his head unconsciously in the direction of Hua Yao who was just watching for the entire time. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Hua Yao immediately showed him an expression of undisguised disgust!
