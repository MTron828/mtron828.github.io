They came from all over the 72 cities. They only accompanied their masters to participate in the competition. In the Sacred City, those who were arrogant and treacherous on usual days could only behave obediently during this time.

“Have all your City Lords entered the city?” A big burly man looked at the people at the same table.

Those people nodded immediately.

“See, with such a good opportunity, how can the City Lords be reluctant to come? But ...” The speaker carefully looked around and whispered: “I heard that this time he was also invited, I think with that strength, I am afraid that he does not even need to participate, after all, few people can match that strength. ”

The man was vague, but everyone knew who he was talking about.

Now, the first person in the 72 cities was no longer Lord Bai Zhu from the White Night City. But the person that killed a million troops in the 72 cities with one force– Sea Spirit City Lord Yan Hai. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The young man had directly tore apart all order in the 72 cities, broke the balance maintained by the 72 cities for thousands of years, and completely held the 72 cities in his hands.

The strength of that person, compared with the 72 cities, absolutely had no resistance. The 72 City Lords who had been vying to be the top among the lords had been defeated for the first time. They could only bow low in front of that person.

Originally, everyone thought that the person who took control of the whole 72 cities would use bloody methods to suppress the restless hearts of the cities. Even if he would not kill them all at first, he would never spare them either.

After all, they had led people to attack the Sea Spirit City. And then bowed their heads after the defeat. The hatred had been built.

But...

Who would have thought that the Sea Spirit City Lord who had won the position of overlord of the 72 cities would have no action at all. The whole Sea Spirit City was peaceful and it was as if nothing had happened. Those City Lords who had been afraid for a long time even thought that they were dreaming.

This behavior was really weird. Who would want to come to the Upper Realms with that power and authority and still keep those City Lords alive?

One had to say that everyone in the 72 cities was shocked by the strange behavior. So far no one could understand the mind of that person.

“What’s there to compare? Even if to compare, which City Lord dared to really fight him? That person must be tired of living!” The big man on the side hummed.

How do ants fight against elephants?

“Also, that kind of strength, let alone the City Lords, even the Top Ten Experts could not withstand it.”

The discussion was heated and the voices gradually increased. Fortunately, most of the restaurants were visitors from the 72 cities. For those who spoke, they were not surprised. Most of them felt the same way.

But no one noticed that in the corner of the restaurant, several figures were silently observing.

“I said ... What did His Lord mean? Calling the Little Xie here, didn’t he mean to see her? After entering the city, he arranged Little Xie to stay in the restaurant and take part in the selection of the Top Ten Experts in a few days? Does he feel that his men were too obtrusive, so he wants to borrow the hands of the Little Xie to kill a few? “Qiao Chu supported his chin with one hand and looked at the people sitting and talking at the table.
