Chapter 3068 The Chaos Array 2

It was difficult to even recognise oneself in the chaos.

Jun Wu Xie was very deliberate in not fighting against the chaos as it would only deplete her and Jun Wu Yao’s strength and leave them helpless. Perhaps that was the God of Destruction’s plan.

The rules of The Chaos were fair. As long as one followed the rules, there would always be a way out. If not, the consequences would be unimaginable.

...

One year

Two years

Three or four years.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao had lost track of how long they had been suffering in that valley. In the beginning, Jun Wu Xie could still calculate the dates but as time went by, she forgot even the concept of time.

Occasionally a talking bird would fly past and say, “The green grass has withered 50 times and sprouted 50 times.”

“The green grass has withered 70 times and sprouted 70 times.”

......

“The green grass has withered 90 times and sprouted 90 times.”

There came a time when the talking bird flew past once more and said, “The green grass has withered 100 times and sprouted 100 times.”

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao looked at each other, not saying a word.

“How long have we been stuck here.” After a long time, Jun Wu Xie was a picture of calm and had long gotten rid of her initial anxiety regarding the situation. The current her was a calm young woman, smiling and carefree.

“The grass withering 100 times should be....”

Before Jun Wu Yao finished, Jun Wu Xie nodded her head and gave him a smile that made him go weak at his knees, “100 years.”

Indeed, the grass withered once a year so 100 times would mean that 100 years had passed.

The both of them had already been trapped there for 100 years.

During these 100 years, Jun Wu Xie had shed some of her anxiety and aloofness and gained a level of tranquility. When she was still, she looked like a perfect statue that people did not want to disturb.

Jun Wu Yao said, “Although we have been here for 100 years, I get the feeling that not the same amount of time has passed on the outside world.”

“Ah, I have the same feeling.” Jun Wu Xie replied.

Just as the words left her mouth, the low, heartwarming gong of an ancient bell rang out, sounding like it came from the heavens.

With each gong of the bell, the chaos power receded a little bit and after not more than 10 breaths, the chaos power was no more.

“The power of the rules....has disappeared?” Jun Wu Yao’s face registered surprise, “Little Xie, do you feel that the power has disappeared?”

He had waited 100 years, a whole 100 years! He had lost track of how many times he wanted to fight the chaos power but did not do so for fear of being trapped for longer and even more so out of not wanting to drag Jun Wu Xie down with him.

However, after 100 years, the chaos power had disappeared and he and Jun Wu Xie had regained control of their bodies!

Jun Wu Yao quickly became calm. He was smart enough to know that this 100 years was only a beginning and nobody knew what the future held.

“It’s not so simple, only the chaos power has faded.” Jun Wu Xie said flatly, “This is just the beginning.”
