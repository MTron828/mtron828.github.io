Chapter 2573: Walk Right into The Trap (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In the Soul World, there was a big broad man, dressed in a black light armor, sitting up straight on the ground under the Spirit Tree. The lofty tree behind him soared high up into the clouds, whereas its thick and sturdy trunk was as broad as a skyscraper. Its packed leaves were glowing with faint light, overlapping with each other, as if it was a huge umbrella.

The man had a calm expression on his face with a pair of dashing eyebrows projecting an aura of dignity. He looked tough and handsome, seemingly to be in his early thirties.

“Lord Meng Qiu.” A spirit envoy, dressed in a black armor, walked towards the Spirit Tree and bowed to the man with his waist slightly bending forward.

Meng Qiu turned his head over slowly and looked indifferently at the spirit envoy. A low and deep voice came under the Spirit Tree.

“What is it?”

Meng Qiu, the strongest spirit envoy in the Soul World of all time, was created by the Spirit Tree in the early years when the Soul World was established. It could be said that he was one of the oldest spirit envoys created by the Spirit Tree. He had no predecessor to guide him, and could only nesciently figure the connotation of his existence all by himself. Since he had been serving beside the Spirit Tree for many years, everyone would often think of him as the very first guardian of the Spirit Tree.

But now, he had become the first spirit envoy to betray the Spirit Tree.

“Lord Meng Qiu, we seem to have discovered the trace of Long Jiu,” said the spirit envoy.

“Long Jiu?” The expression on Meng Qiu’s face remained calm and steady, and there wasn’t any specific tone heard in his speaking voice. With his mouth mumbling the familiar name, he raised his eyes and looked at the Spirit Tree behind him.

It had been countless years and the Spirit Tree had always been silently rooting itself in this place. Neither would it get angry or speak. There were vines dangling from the branches with a faint halo radiating from them, as if they were the galaxies that had been falling from the sky. Once, those gentle vines were just like the pair of hands of the Spirit Tree, sending the newborn souls into the Soul World with a soft pat, but now, those vines were just hanging on the branches of the tree without even moving a bit, let alone expressing the feelings of the Spirit Tree.

While being in a daze, it was as if the tremendous glowing tree in his eyes was just a normal tree with no spirituality inside it.

“Of course he’ll be back. He has a close relationship with Qin Song since young. Since Qin Song has returned to the Soul World, it’s certain that Long Jiu will also come back.” There wasn’t any emotion in Meng Qiu’s flat voice. He just lifted his hand up and touched the vine that dangled from the tree.

The sense of coldness under his fingers was just like the cold skin of the plant that he stroked over, which had long lost its warmth that it usually had in the past.

“Then, do we need to capture him?” The black armored spirit envoy narrowed his eyes, “Since Qin Song has the ability to sneak into the surroundings of the Spirit Tree, the strength of Long Jiu too, isn’t weak, if he breaks in here...”

“What’s the matter if he comes?” Abruptly, Meng Qiu interrupted the black armored spirit envoy who hadn’t finished his words and said.

The spirit envoy stunned. By the time he raised his eyes and looked in the direction of Meng Qiu, Meng Qiu had already stood up with both his hands clenched on his back, giving out an invisible pressure from his big and tall stature.

Even the black armored spirit envoy who belonged to the same party as him couldn’t help himself from getting frightened when he saw how imposing Meng Qiu was with his manner.

Meng Qiu had yet to show his power, but that was already enough for him to bring them such a strong pressure, what if he began to attack...

Suddenly realizing that the worry he mentioned just now was such a ridiculous joke, the black armored spirit envoy quickly responded, “It’s your subordinate that has made an indiscreet remark! There’s Lord Meng Qiu guarding the Spirit Tree, even if there are ten Long Jius, they still aren’t the opponent of Lord Meng Qiu, not to mention that there’s only one Long Jiu. Of course... Of course there’s nothing to worry about.”

Meng Qiu slightly lowered his eyes, “Speak about it, it’s been a long time since I, the Master, and Long Jiu meet each other. Just settle it yourselves, lock him up in the Soul Prison. It will be nice for him to meet his bestie Qin Song.
