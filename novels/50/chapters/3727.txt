Chapter 2322: Washing the Nine Temples with Blood (9)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie stood calmly in the hall. Despite Nangong Lie revealing his Spirit Ring, there was no reaction from her at all. On her cold face, not the slightest fluctuations could be seen and it was as if nothing had happened at all.

Her calmness had became extremely dazzling in his eyes. He could only fight hard as he stood up from his seat and brought a faint glow to the red Spirit Ring in his hand.

At this moment, in the entire hall, only the screams of Da Han was endless, while the others were already holding their breaths.

“Master Nangong...save...save me...” Da Han’s ashened face was twisted in pain as his pair of eyes looked anxiously at Nangong Lie with hope.

Nangong Lie slowed down his breath and stared at Jun Wu Xie’s every move. He was very cautious and did not dare to relax.

Jun Wu Xie was definitely one of the most difficult opponents he had ever faced. Nangong Lie also had a certain confidence in his own strength as he ranked among the top four. The power of his Spirit Ring could not be compared to the likes of Qiu Yun. Looking at the entire Upper Realm, the power of the Spirit Ring that could compare with him were only the Top Ten Experts. He could not help but secretly speculate on how strong the Spirit Ring of Jun Wu Xie was.

Under the anguished wailings of Da Han, Jun Wu Xie pulled out her light sword and under the cautious gaze of Nangong Lie, she cut off the neck of Da Han.

The hot blood splattered onto everyone in the hall, and the drops of sticky, hot blood landed on their faces and bodies, and it startled them so that it felt as if the blood was like magma that had burned them.

Nangong Lie’s eyes widened. He did not think that at such a time, Jun Wu Xie still did not forget to kill the man who had uttered so much gibberish, was she so confident in herself?

“Spirit Ring, is it?” Jun Wu Xie flicked the blood off the light sword as her cold eyes swept by Da Han as she watched his head roll to the feet of Nangong Lie and a cold glint in her eyes flashed by.

“I heard that you are one of the Top Ten Experts.” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and looked at the Nangong Lie.

“Yes.” Nangong Lie only felt as if there was a stone stuck in his throat. Although it was not painful, it was unusually uncomfortable. Every time he said a word, he felt that his throat was itchy.

It was very strange that Jun Wu Xie had not released her Spirit Ring yet but Nangong Lie had already felt a strong sense of oppression. This situation has not been reduced even after he had released his own Spirit Ring.

Jun Wu Xie did not speak again, under the intense gaze of Nangong Lie, a dark green Spirit Ring suddenly appeared in her right hand!

When the dark green Spirit Ring appeared, Nangong Lie’s breathing stopped almost in an instant.

The dazzling Spirit Ring was actually brighter than the red Spirit Ring in his hand. For the strength of the Spirit Ring, a large part was based on the strength of the owner. Just based on Jun Wu Xie revealing her Spirit Ring, from the contrast of the two Spirit Rings, the results could be seen.

The red Spirit Ring in the hands of Nangong Lie seemed to be covered by the dark green Spirit Ring and looked a little dull even.

In just but a moment, Nangong Lie’s heart fell to the bottom.

No wonder... Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

No wonder Jun Wu Xie dared to be so arrogant!

It turns out that her Spirit Ring had been cultivated to such a realm!

“Then, let’s start with you first.” Jun Wu Xie smiled, but it made Nangong Lie feel cold instead.

Start from him?

Did this not mean that Jun Wu Xie planned to take out the Top Ten Experts of the Upper Realm one by one?

How arrogant was she!

No longer giving Nangong Lie any time to think further, Jun Wu Xie’s figure had already disappeared!
