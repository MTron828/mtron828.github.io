“Ha.” Nalan snorted in derision.

Wu Jiu instead saw it as a struggle while in the throes of death. He would be happy to see Nalan Shan’s crushing defeat, where he would even watch in admiration as a type of enjoyment for him.

“Nalan Shan. You are really such a good fellow junior of mine, so much so that you are able to satisfy my needs so very quickly. Since this brown bear has already delivered itself up to my door, you are still my good little fellow junior. Wait till I capture that brown bear, and I will set you free, without needing you to come play guest at my place anymore.” Wu Jiu said with his chin lifted, and a bunch of his disciples immediately surged forward, to surround Brownie and the other Beast Spirits within a circle six men thick facing both inwards and outwards.

Brownie let out a roar of rage and the cheetah bared its fangs, ready to jump into battle anytime.

Nalan Shan continued to stare at Wu Jiu who was looking beside himself with glee.

“Wu Jiu, you shall pay for everything that you’ve done today.”

“Oh? I would really like to see how you are going to make me pay. Arrest that bear right now!” Wu Jiu shouted out coldly.

Jiang Yun Long and a bunch of human spirits jumped straight towards Brownie and the others, but in the next instant, several massive vines shot out from behind them that sent the human spirits surrounding Brownie and the four Beast Spirits flying away in a blink!

Wu Jiu was startled as he quickly turned to look at the source of those vines.

Poison Ivy slowly walked into Wu Jiu’s line of sight, the dancing vines around his body clearly showing who was responsible for the strike that had just happened. It was him!

“Poison Ivy!” Wu Jiu’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Poison Ivy who had charged into the fray so suddenly, and his eyes took on a vicious tinge. He had heard from Jiang Yun Long before that Poison Ivy was involved in this matter and if not for the fact that he did not want to antagonize the Plant Spirits at this critical juncture, Wu Jiu would have moved against Poison Ivy long ago.

Even if he was to let Poison Ivy go this time, when the fifth Serene Spirit Tower was to be constructed, Poison Ivy would then be his next target.

“What have you come here for? Are you going to stick your nose into the affairs of us human spirits?” Wu Jiu asked as he glared threateningly at Poison Ivy.

Poison Ivy was nonchalant as he lifted his head, to look at Wu Jiu whose face was filled with nothing but malice.

“Human spirit affairs? I do not think that this is an affair concerning just you human spirits.” Poison Ivy said with a cold sneer.

Wu Jiu took a deep breath.

“The brown bear wounded human spirits, and broke the Spirit World’s rules. As the Spirit Master, I have the right to arrest it and take it to task.”

Poison Ivy arched up an eyebrow but did not respond.

But another cold clear voice sounded out right at that moment.

“You have the right? What right do you have to capture the Beast Spirits’ Spiritual Bear?” Accompanying that voice, was a flawlessly beautiful young lady that came walking gracefully out from among the masses of spirits, with a massive blank panther following by her feet, treading together with her every step as she went in closer, to come before the horde of human spirits.

Wu Jiu stared in surprise at Jun Wu Xie who came walking in quietly. Although he had never seen her countenance with his own eyes, but with the portraits that Meng Yi Liang had drawn up, he was able to recognize the owner of that set of facial features.

Jun Wu Xie.

Wu Jiu had attempted to capture this young lady before, wanting to interrogate her about Nalan Shan’s whereabouts.

Jiang Yun Long’s eyes were also staring widely, as he looked at the young lady whom he had been searching so hard for throughout the past half a year. In the past half a year, he had not given up on capturing Jun Wu Xie but there had been no result at all. It had been as if Jun Wu Xie had evaporated into thin air, where there wasn’t a single sign of her anywhere. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jiang Yun Long had never expected that he would see Jun Wu Xie here today.

“Jun Wu Xie! You can really hide!” Jiang Yun Long narrowed his eyes to a slit as he glared at Jun Wu Xie. Have searched so bitterly for the past half year without yielding any result, he had suffered much admonishments before Wu Jiu. Now that he saw Jun Wu Xie, all the aggrievement in his heart suddenly rose right to the surface!
