“What’s so great about it? I, your father, am not a coward!” That man whose surname was Hu rushed out of the crowd immediately. He was already feeling absolutely depressed and was condemning himself when he saw Jun Wu Xie had given it her all and did not care about dragging herself into a bloody battle, all just to save Su Ya. Within his heart, he was in turmoil and after hearing his brother’s accusations, it provoked his last thread of reason which had tugged hard on his heartstrings. Feeling his blood boiling, he threw away all caution to the wind.

That man fell down onto his knees, in front of the Celestial Temple elders, he said in a sombre tone with his head bowed down: “To have been recognized by the Celestial Temple is this disciple’s honour. However, this disciple can no longer stay silent after everything that has happened today. Please forgive me elders, but I can no longer sit back and watch. From now on, I no longer have anything to do with the Celestial Temple! I’m breaking all my ties with the Celestial Temple, so whatever I do today, has no relationship whatsoever with the Celestial Temple!” The moment he finished speaking, his forehead fell heavily onto the ground into a kowtow with a loud thud! The moment he stood up, he strode resolutely to where his brother was!

He could be afraid, could be timid, but he was not willing to be a coward that even his own good brother refused to recognize!

A tall figure entered into the group off the Spirit Jade Palace, the view of his back was majestic and awe inspiring.

There was a shocking silence in the entire square.

That man with the surname Hu walked to his good brother and the two stared at each other for a long while before they finally raised their arms with clenched fists and struck each other’s arms as they broke into a smile.

Since they’ve sworn to the heavens to be brothers, they shall share their joys and sorrows together!

“Elder, please let this disciple leave.” Suddenly, another voice resounded out as another disciple knelt down and said. Without waiting for that elder’s reply, he stood up and immediately walked towards the side of the Spirit Jade Palace.

“This disciple is thankful for all that the Scarlet Flame Temple has bestowed upon me, today we shall break all ties!”

“This disciple is willing to go through this life and death battle with Mentor Su Ya and headmaster!”

“This disciple is leaving on my own accord.”

“From today, everything that I no has nothing to do with the Nirvana Temple.”

“This disciple requests to leave the Heavenly Wolf Temple!”

“.....”

In an instant, hundreds of people broke away from the Nine Temples and walked to the Spirit Jade Palace. They all paid their last respects and broke all ties from their respective temples, abandoning all the glory that it had offered. Instead, they chose to join a battle that they had no chance at winning but they would rather do this than be burdened with condemnation of their own conscientiousness!

More and more left the Nine Temples as the army of the Spirit Jade Palace started to grow. This inexplicable scene was like a wildfire that had spread and it had lit up the hearts of everyone!

Su Jing Yan’s eyes widened. Never had he expected that the appearance of the Spirit Jade Palace could trigger such an intense reaction!

Just from their Heavenly Wolf Temple itself, there were close to a hundred disciples who had left!

Looking at their firm and unwavering gazes, the elders from the Nine Temples could not bear to let them go but simply remained silent the entire time.

Ba He’s dangerous gaze swept by those disciples that had left the Nine Temples and that gaze got colder and colder. He never expected that this group of dogs would actually bite back!

“These are the people that the Nine Temples had raised? Since they are a treacherous bunch, there’s no more need to keep them. Since they are bent on seeking death, let them bring along such a ridiculous notion of loyalty to the netherworld then.” He sneered and his gaze swept by the elders of the Nine Temples.

The faces of the elders were ugly to the extreme, if not for them representing the Nine Temples, they would not have been able to endure the raging flames of anger that were quelled in their hearts long ago.

At this moment, in their hearts, they were envying those who had left. They envied these disciples who had such strong courage and dared to pursue their own beliefs that they found true to their heart. They were not at all like them, weak and incompetent.

Among the Nine Temples, almost all of those who had came from Cloudy Brook Academy had left, while the remaining disciples could only lower their heads in shame and did not dare to utter a word.

When Jun Wu Xie saw all this happen before her, she had long forgotten about the pain from her own injuries. Her gaze fell onto the majestic presence that had started it all – the Spirit Jade Palace Lord.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
