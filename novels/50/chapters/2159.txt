Chapter 2160: Descending upon Mount Fu Yao Again (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“Your subordinate has checked many places but still have yet to find any signs of Su Ya.”

Jun Wu Xie’s brows knitted up slightly. Su Ya and Tian Ze were both Silver Spirits and the little old man as their Master would naturally possess more exceptional powers than them. For the Nine Temples to have hidden Su Ya so well and to have sent out such a large number of people to patrol the place, they must fear that the little old man would sneak in and bring Su Ya out of the place. Jun Wu Xie had guessed that it was impossible that they would just casually hide Su Ya anywhere but if even Ye Mei was unable to find her.....

“Are you saying that the Nine Temple Lords had not come here?” Jun Wu Xie then asked.

Ye Mei nodded. “Ye Sha sent news to me earlier. He is following Lord Jue’s orders and has been keeping close watch on the movements of the Nine Temple Lords. He has discovered that the Nine Temple Lords have gathered together in the Heavenly Wolf Temple and they seem to be discussing about something. As all of them possess Gold Spirits, Ye Sha did not dare to get too close and hence could not be clear about what they were discussing about. The only point to note was that they did not seem to have any intentions of coming to Mount Fu Yao.”

Mount Fu Yao could be said to be the demarcation line between the boundaries of the Twelve Palaces’ and the Nine Temples’ forces. The journey to Mount Fu Yao from the Heavenly Wolf Temple would take at least nine days. Although a Gold Spirit was highly powerful, but they wouldn’t be able to fly through the air like Jun Wu Yao. Hence, it was basically impossible for them to rush their way over to Mount Fu Yao within the next three days.

“The Nine Temple Lords are not coming?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed up slightly, a slight feeling telling her that something was not right.

To have been able to produce two disciples possessing Silver Spirits, it goes without having to say that the little old man’s powers would naturally be stronger, maybe already a gold spirit, and the prowess of a Gold Spirit was definitely not what Silver Spirits could stand against. Although he would not be able to take down tens of millions enemies, but having him rescue Su Ya while being heavily surrounded would not be too hard.

Since the Nine Temples had already spent so much effort to force the little old man to show himself, how could they possibly not know what kind of powers he possess? But the nine Gold Spirits of the Nine Temples were however sitting back and would not be appearing here at Mount Fu Yao. Wouldn’t that be presenting a great big flaw in their plans to the little old man?

“Besides the Nine Temples, are there any others on Mount Fu Yao?” Jun Wu Xie suddenly asked.

Ye Mei was slightly taken aback, not knowing why Jun Wu Xie would suddenly ask such a question, but he went on to answer: “Your subordinate did not see any others but I am not entirely certain of it.”

Ye Mei’s powers could not be compared to Ye Gu’s and if the target’s powers were above his, Ye Mei would then not be able to find out much.

But there was one point that Ye Mei felt was rather suspicious.

“I tailed several of the Nine Temples’ Elders and I discovered that they would gather everyday at a particular loft building in the Cloudy Brook Academy. But as their numbers were too many, your subordinate did not dare to follow them inside to investigate, and I do not know if there are more people in there.” Ye Mei was very careful with his report, as this was a matter of grave importance and he did not dare to be too stubborn about things.

“Loft.....” Jun Wu Xie bit her lip thoughtfully. She just did not believe that after the Nine Temples captured Su Ya to force the little old man to appear, they would still leave such a fatal flaw in their plot. Without the Gold Spirits to hold the fort, how could they possibly dare to invite the enemy to come in?

In the Middle Realm, people who had attained the Gold Spirit were only a rare few. Could it be possible that there were more Gold Spirits hidden?

Jun Wu Xie’s mind whirred quickly, seeking to fully decipher the entire situation on Mount Fu Yao in the shortest time possible.

“Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms..... Nine Temples..... Upper Realm.....” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes suddenly lit up and she lifted her head to look at Jun Wu Yao.

“Could it be that the people who wants to capture my Grandmaster isn’t the Nine Temples..... but the Upper Realm? It’s people from the Upper Realm who is trying to capture my Grandmaster?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

If that was true, then everything would make sense!
