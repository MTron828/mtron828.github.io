“Yeah. Sister-in-law said that she wanted to make you a wedding dress. At first, we thought that it might be too early for her to do so but who would know...” Subconsciously, the speaking tone of Jun Qing went down and intensified. During that year, Jun Wu Xie’s mother was badly injured while Jun Gu was far away from home, busy involving himself in the military expedition. But they didn’t know that the farewell this time was their very last goodbye to each other. Neglecting the fact that she wasn’t fully recovered yet, Jun Wu Xie’s mother began to prepare various clothes for her daughter when she was going through postnatal care. There were all kinds of clothes, from clothes for a kid to clothes for an adult, even the wedding dress was well prepared.

At that time, she might have noticed that there wasn’t much time left for her.

Jun Wu Xie was a little depressed. Even though she had never met the parents of this body, as the time of her living as Jun Wu Xie passed, she had been long regarding the Jun Family as her home, and Jun Qing and the others as her real family members.

Whereas, it was as if Jun Gu and her mother were her biological parents.

“It’s really a beautiful wedding dress, you’re going to like it. It’s just that we’re not sure whether if the dress fits you, but it can still be modified,” said Jun Qing.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

“Alright, let’s skip over this topic. Your grandfather and I will start to prepare your wedding ceremony once we get back. Get married as soon as possible or else Wu Yao will be doing something again.” Jun Qing changed the topic of the conversation on purpose. The moment he mentioned about all the things that were done by Jun Wu Yao during this period of time, he was so speechless that he wasn’t sure if he should be laughing or crying at the moment.

Along the way, Jun Xian and Jun Qing were discussing about the ceremony with Jun Wu Xie without mentioning her parents again.

However, the seed regarding her parents had been stealthily planted in Jun Wu Xie’s heart.

She couldn’t bring her mother back but she was definitely going to save her father!

...

The Imperial Qi Kingdom had already revoked the title “Kingdom” from its name and it was now called the Qi City.

When the troops came back, the residents of the city were all standing along the streets, welcoming their great return. All the troops that had participated in the battle came to the city, causing the Qi City which was originally very spacious to fail to accommodate such great amount of people, leading the army to have no choice but to camp outside the city. Even half of the places of the Rui Lin Army’s barrack was lent to other troops of the Lower Realm for them to stay.

But even so, nobody would have any complaints since joy and happiness had overwhelmed everyone.

Qu Lingyue rejected the invitation to temporarily stay in the Lin Palace and chose to stay at the military camp outside the city together with Lei Chen and the other generals.

Since the day the marriage of Jun Wu Xie was confirmed, Qu Lingyue never once visited Jun Wu Xie again. Neither she had no thoughts to see her nor she was unwilling to meet her, it was just because she didn’t have the courage to do so.

It had been so many years and even though she knew that it was impossible for her and Jun Wu Xie to get closer a step with each other, she couldn’t help herself from lying to herself. It was as if as long as she wouldn’t think about it, she could still keep the small little hope and the bits of imagination in her heart.

Nonetheless, the marriage of Jun Wu Xie had pulled her back into the brutal reality. She could only look from afar, halting herself from having any unrealistic expectations so that she wouldn’t be feeling so painful.

“Things like the wedding gifts, you go and choose it for me.” Qu Lingyue stared at the Qi City which was within a stone’s throw away from her. A few days later, the person who she had been hiding in her heart could no longer belong to her. Even the bits of imagination of hers must be destroyed.

While looking at Qu Lingyue who was trying hard to remain calm, Lei Chen could only sigh in his thoughts. But within the pity he felt towards her, there was a trace of delight arose unwittingly inside him.

Maybe the marriage of Jun Wu Xie would let Qu Lingyue go through a change.

Maybe...

He still had chance...

It was just that Lei Chen didn’t dare to speak about all of these at this moment, unwilling to disturb the very last melancholy of Qu Lingyue towards her sentiment.
