Chapter 1940: “The Dust Settles (4)”

“No need.” Jun Wu Xie shook her head. She was highly adverse to using anesthetics as the helpless feeling of being unable to control your own body made her think of the past, when she was under the control of that demonic devil, and was unable to break free.

Mu Chen confirmed it a few times with Jun Wu Xie, whom had though said it was not good to use it, but the pain from stitching one’s wound was not something anyone could tolerate.

Jun Wu Yao walked over to go to the side of the bed and sat down beside Jun Wu Xie. Wrapping his arms around her, he then held her her tiny hand. Smiling slightly, he raised his head and said to Mu Chen: “You can start.”

Jun Wu Xie only felt an incessant warm surge of power coming from Jun Wu Yao’s palm to spread through her, and it seemed that the pain she was feeling on her body lessened by quite a bit.

Mu Chen stitched up Jun Wu Xie’s wound speedily, not daring to prolong the process in the slightest. Although his skills in Medicine could not be compared to Jun Wu Xie’s, but having once been the legitimate successor to the Qing Yun Clan, his skills were rather outstanding as well.

Jun Wu Xie did not even utter a single sound, but merely closed her eyes and endured the heart piercing pain.

It was not till everything was completed, that Mu Chen finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Young Miss is more knowledgeable than I am in Medicine and you should know that the crack in your skull is really quite troublesome.” Mu Chen said as he looked at Jun Wu Xie. Fortunately it was only a very fine hairline, which did not crack deep into the skull. Otherwise..... the result would have been unthinkable.

Jun Wu Xie nodded. She knew that her injuries was rather serious this time and the most worrying thing was that she could possibly have suffered damage to the nervous system in her brain, or her vision would not have become so blurry.

As Mu Chen’s knowledge in Medicine was inferior to that of Jun Wu Xie’s, there was naturally nothing much more he could say. Jun Wu Xie then mouthed out a prescription for Mu Chen to have his people go prepare. The little black cat jumped out at that opportune moment and used its furry paw to push the cup filled with Little Lotus’ tears right before Mu Chen.

How could medicine brewed with regular water ever compare with one with Little Lotus’ tears?

Mu Chen held the cup of tears, not knowing whether to laugh or cry as he went walking outside.

“Get some sleep. When the medicine is ready, I’ll wake you.” Jun Wu Yao said gently. Seeing the little one in his arms like this pained him so badly.

Jun Wu Xie nodded. She was really rather tired. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Seeing that Jun Wu Xie had drifted off to sleep, Jun Wu Yao gently laid her down on the bed. When he stood up, his eyes then swung onto the softly sobbing Little Lotus standing at the side. Caught under that gaze, Little Lotus immediately clasped his tiny hands over his mouth, not daring to make another sound.

“Look after her well.” Jun Wu Yao said to the bunch of non humans in the room.

Poppy nodded especially earnestly, while the little black cat just swished its tail in acknowledgement.

Stepping out from Jun Wu Xie’s room, Ye Sha and Ye Mei were standing guard outside the door.

“Ye Gu went to get some rest first. His injuries were quite serious this time but he still came seeking to beg forgiveness from Lord Jue. I was afraid that Young Miss would feel guilty and I asked him to go to his room to rest first.” Ye Sha opened his mouth to report. Ye Gu had gotten injured because he was shielding Jun Wu Xie and with Jun Wu Xie’s personality, if Ye Gu did not recover as soon as possible, she would definitely blame herself for it.

After having followed Jun Wu Xie for so long, Ye Sha had come to know Jun Wu Xie’s character well.

Jun Wu Yao nodded, not showing any objection to the arrangements Ye Sha had made.

“Lord Jue, Gu Ying used the Soul Shifting Technique and is still not dead. Now that he knows my Lord’s identity..... he needs to be eradicated quickly. Otherwise, once news of this leaks out, it might draw those people here.” Ye Mei who was standing on one side said rather worriedly. He had rushed here together with Jun Wu Yao and he had witnessed everything that happened earlier.

To have been able to escape out from Jun Wu Yao’s Blood Burial alive, that Gu Ying was rather capable.
