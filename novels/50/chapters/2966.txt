Chapter 2967 Ridiculous poison king 2

“If you can’t find it, he’s going to die.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed his eyes and looked up at Long Yao. “Lord Long Yao, it seems I won.”

Long Yao’s expression became very ugly. He was very confident about Fang Jinghe’s ability to poison. Since Fang Jinghe could not detect the poison, it should be really non-toxic. Long Yao couldn’t feel any better.

“Yan Hai, whether you have been poisoned or not remains to be determined. If you dare to deceive me, you should know the consequences.” Long Yao threatened to say.

“Bai Zhu, do you feel any discomfort?” Long Yao asked.

Bai Zhu was already frightened. When he heard Long Yao’s inquiries, he immediately looked down.

Strange enough, after he took Jun Wu Xie’s poison, his body did not have any discomfort or pain.

He shook his head at Long Yao.

“Yan Hai, what else do you have to say?” Long Yao frowned and looked at Jun Wu Xie. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie didn’t take it for granted. Those cold eyes fell to the pale faced Bai Zhu.

“Lord Bai.”

Bai Zhu could not help but start shaking.

“As a man, your skin is really more delicate than a woman.” Jun Wu Xie said something inexplicable and she kept quiet.

Bai Zhu was confused by Jun Wu Xie’s words. He was born with pure white skin. Although he was better than an ordinary man, it was really very different comparing him with a woman.

While Bai Zhu was thinking about the meaning of Jun Wu Xie’s words, Fang Jinghe squatted beside Bai Zhu and swept around him casually. But this circling surprised Fang Jinghe. He sat on the ground, and he screamed.

Fang Jinghe’s scream shocked Bai Zhu’s heart. He turned to look at Fang Jinghe. He could only find Fang Jinghe staring at his face with horror.

Bai Zhu reached out his hand subconsciously, and touched his cheek. The touch of his fingertips was an unusually soft touch. The smooth feeling was actually a little tender than a woman’s skin. Bai Zhu stared to the extreme in an instant!

The softness had exceeded the limit that the flesh could bring. He tapped lightly, but he didn’t feel any obstacle under the skin. Without the support of a bit of meat and bones, his entire skin was wrapped with a warm and sticky liquid!

“What’s going on? What’s going on here?” A huge horror spread in the bottom of Bai Zhu’s heart. He raised his hand in a panic and stared. He almost fainted.

His hands became extremely white and tender. The slightly rough skin no longer existed. Now, what covers him was a thin layer of cicada-like, translucent skin. The criss cross blood vessels, and the blood-red, viscous fluid could be clearly seen under it.

Bai Zhu stared and unable to believe everything he saw.

His skin! !! !!

His muscles! !! !! !!

Everyone present was paying attention to the changes in Bai Zhu. It looked fierce that there was nothing unusual about Bai Zhu. But if you take a closer look, you could see that the skin of Bai Zhu’s entire body has become as thin as cicada wings. They could clearly see the blood vessels in Bai Zhu’s body and the muscles that have melted into pus ...
