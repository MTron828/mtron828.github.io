Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Until the Night Regime intercepted more than half the ships from Sea Spirit City and killed them, they had let some of the ships in the sea periphery go, did they began to prepare in earnest for the voyage to the Upper Realm.

Jun Wu Xie gave each a pill to change their appearances, this medicinal pill would allow the person who ate it to change their appearance into someone else. Jun Wu Xie made them remember the faces of those people whom they have killed. They found someone who was good at drawing portraits in the Ghost Army to help draw the faces, and once they took the medicinal pill, they could use that to change their appearances.

The effect of the medicinal pills could last up to a year, and as long as they didn’t not take the antidote, they could keep it up for a long while.

On the shore of that isolated island, a group of elites, who were originally handsome, grave stern, underwent various appearance changes under the influence of the medicinal pills. The black uniforms were also replaced with coarse linen. The picture was really spectacular.

Dozens of ships were docked by the coast, those who had changed their appearances, boarded the ships one by one according to different ships ‘they’ (the people whom they have assumed the identities of) were previously on.

Zi Fei stood by the shore, things were changing – Jun Wu Xie who already assumed Yan Hai’s appearance and identity, her eyes reflecting some trace of reluctance.

She had stayed on the island for so long, and her only accompaniment were the Sea Spirit Beasts. This time, it wasn’t easy to have met Jun Wu Xie and others. After spending several days with them, she really liked this thoughtful, sensible and wise child. Many times, Zi Fei thought to herself, would her own child be as loveable and sensible.

“Senior Zi Fei, we are leaving.” Qiao Chu laughingly walked to Zi Fei to bid her farewell. His current appearance was that of a young boy, no longer did he possess his dashing looks.

“Bon Voyage.” Zi Fei suppressed her reluctance to part, and waved at them.

Qiao Chu and the others also were a bit reluctant to board the ships.

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were the last to board the vessel. The two stood to the side of the ship, Jun Wu Xie walked halfway and stopped, and turned to look at Zi Fei, who was standing not to far as she sent them off.

She bowed slightly at Zi Fei, an expression of thanks and gratitude.

Zi Fei eyes were somewhat reddened, although reluctant, she knew that Jun Wu Xie and her friends had big plans, and she could not stand in their way.

“Little girl.” Zi Fei suddenly spoke.

Jun Wu Xie lifted her to look at Zi Fei.

“We’ve known each other for a while but you have yet to tell me your name.” Zi Fei said.

Jun Wu Xie was shocked, she totally forgot. She spoke clearly:

“Jun Wu Xie, I’m Jun Wu Xie.”

After she said her name, Jun Wu Yao led Jun Wu Xie towards the ship.

Zi Fei felt like she was struck by lightning, as she stood dazed and rooted to the ground. The eyes peeking through the mask widened dramatically, as they reflected incredulity.

Jun.... Wu Xie....

She said she was Jun Wu Xie!

During the moments where Zi Fei was stunned, the vessels had already set sail away from the coast.

Zi Fei’s heart tightened as an all-consuming sense of depression engulfed her whole being.

She wanted to chase after the ships. But when she saw Jun Wu Xie waving to her from the deck, her footsteps seemed to have rooted on the ground, unable to move.

Jun Wu Xie.....

Wu Xie....

Zi Fei’s eyes were red, she was unable to control the pain that seemed to spread throughout her being in that instant. She fell to the ground as she looked at the ships that were gradually departing. Two lines of tears slipped silently from her eyes.

That is her child!

It’s her child!
