The blinding light from the temple kept growing and soon, it enveloped the entire Sacred City.

Only a few days had passed since the selection of the current Top Ten masters and those who were not from the Sacred City had already left. Those who remained felt very weak under the glow of the golden light. No matter how strong, anybody would pale in comparison to the strength being shown in that battle.

Their spiritual power seemed to be agitated by some unknown force and it constantly churned inside their bodies!

Bai Mo and Nangong Lie were walking on the street and saw the strange scene in front of them. Both of them were completely dumbfounded.

“What is going on?” Bai Mo asked while looking at the rapidly expanding stream of light that before long would cover the entire city.

“I don’t know either.” Nangong Lie’s face was a little pale. He had earlier received news about Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao storming the Holy Temple, leaving a sea of blood in their wake. When he passed the information on to Qiao Chu and the rest, they immediately rushed to the Holy Temple themselves.

He and Bai Mo had intended to go with them but were rejected. They were going there to fight to the death and if Bai Mo and Nangong Lie went with them, they would surely die as well.

They instructed Bai Mo and Nangong Lie, in the event of their death, to immediately leave the Sacred City and take Rong Ruo with them to the Lower Realms where they might have a chance of survival.

“Do you think Fan Zhuo and the rest are alright?” Bai Mo felt an uneasiness that was turning into dread in his heart. He had always felt confident of his power but under the glow of the light, felt utterly weak and powerless.

This was a kind of power that was above all other types of power and it was laughable for anyone to think they could stand up to it.

Bai Mo and Nangong Lie were still quite a distance away from the expanding light but even with that distance they could feel the power coming from it. Nobody would ever dare dream of fighting against such power!

It instilled a fear that was indescribable with words and caused people to tremble uncontrollably.

“I don’t know but no matter what we must be ready to leave with Rong Ruo in case anything happens.” Nangong Lie furrowed his eyebrows, already prepared for the worst.

“I hope they are alright.” Bai Mo gritted his teeth. In that moment, he hated his own weakness but he also knew that even if his power was doubled, it would not have made a difference.

The golden light was still expanding over the city and all the so called experts found themselves in an unbelievable situation!

There was something in the golden light that when they came into contact with it, gave them a surge and pushed them to peak power in no time at all!

This sudden change was difficult for them to process and what was even more surprising was that under the light, their growth was exponential!
