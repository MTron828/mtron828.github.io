When the Lord made Jun Wu Xie part of the mission, Chi Yan immediately got Qin Qi to find out about Jun Wu Xie’s past. Although much had been said about her, being in the exalted position that she was in, Chi Yan never bothered listening to stories about a young person fresh out of Sea Spirit City.

After knowing that Jun Wu Xie was to become a Knight of Destruction, Chi Yan thought that she would go through a cleansing, erasing her past. Once that was complete, she would become as loyal as a dog, no matter what kind of person she once was.

But the Lord’s sudden decision surprised Chi Yan and turned what he knew upside down.

Chi Yan did not have the ambitions of Long Yao, but he would not allow anyone who might threaten His Lord’s success.

Chi Yan was clear as to what Long Yao’s ambitions were but Long Yao was no match for even Chi Yan, much less His Lord! So Chi Yan just let him be.

However Jun Wu Xie was different, her power was unbelievable and surpassed anything that had ever been seen in the Three Realms. There was no way Chi Yan could relax when it came to a person like that.

“Ah? What have you found?” Chi Yan asked.

Qin Qi whispered, “Yan Hai is not the first son of the Sea Spirit City Lord, there were a few sons before him but they were killed as babies due to their great innate talent. Yan Hai was lucky to survive as he was deemed just ordinary.”

“Ah? Seems like his father is a ruthless man, but why did he let Yan Hai live? After all, killing one more makes no difference after killing so many. Ordinary? I would not call someone who has Dual Spirit Rings ordinary.” Chi Yan replied gravely.

Qin Qi went on, “Yan Hai didn’t show any great strength at first but started to transform after his first sea voyage. It seems he discovered a recipe to create an elixir that greatly enhanced his strength after he took it. After that, he even managed to increase the strength of the entire Sea Spirit City.”

“An elixir that can transform an ordinary person into someone who can have Dual Spirit Rings? Can you get one for me?” Chi Yan was skeptical about Qin QI’s claims but was sure that Qin Qi would not lie to him. The problem had to be with Jun Wu Xie.

“The Sea Spirit City’s borders are tightly guarded and its people are fiercely protective of the elixir and thus your subordinate has not been able to get it yet. My sources tell me that people from other cities have tried out the elixir and managed to test it to great effect.” Qin Qi said cautiously.

Chi Yan didn’t speak, but his sharp gaze turned towards Jun Wu Xie, scrutinizing her closely.

Jun Wu Xie noticed Chi Yan’s gaze but pretended not to notice and just stood beside Jun Wu Yao with a calm expression on her face.
