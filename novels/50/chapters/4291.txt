Jun Wu Xie couldn’t help but think of Elder Luo’s ‘hobby’ – the art of witchcraft.

In her previous life, Jun Wu Xie had heard of certain ethnic groups in certain places, which were proficient at using this sort of strange and magical art. At that time, Jun Wu Xie was kept in a cage all day, and all she could do daily was to read books, thus having read several books on this subject.

Those books, however, only described the weirdness of this particular subject, but the basis and principle of it was not explained.

Jun Wu Xie remembered that when she was a little old, that demon had also whispered and mumbled about the magic of witchcraft in private, and he had even wanted to uncover the mystery in it, but the result was a failure. At that time, that person brought home among other things, many of these creatures with very strong toxicity.

Seeing everything in Elder Luo’s house, Jun Wu Xie just knew exactly what the uses were for those things.

Elder Luo was busy with what she had on hand, and she naturally did not notice Jun Wu Xie peeping from outside. After a while, she filled the liquid in the copper pot into small bottles, and turned away.

Following the direction where Elder Luo was headed, Jun Wu Xie noticed that on the wall behind Elder Luo, there was a thin woman who had been tortured. The woman’s face was haggard, and her four limbs shackled tightly to the wall. Her eyes were full of terror and panic. As Elder Luo approached with each step, the terror in her eyes became more and more obvious, as if she would fall apart in the next second.

“What’s with such a horrible look on your face? For ordinary people like you, to have the honour of coming to our Sacred Maiden Tribe is a great glory. And you can, up to now, contribute to the legacy of our Sacred Maiden Tribe, this is such a huge blessing that you should be grateful, and not fearful.” Elder Luo took a bottle of freshly prepared bewitched water as she stared laughingly at the scared and shivering woman.

She was obviously laughing, but the tone, if anyone heard it, contained indescribable horror.

The woman was already terribly frightened as she looked beseechingly at the devil approaching her. She kept shaking her head and trying to repel the approach of Elder Luo. Her chapped lips spread open but there was no sound coming from her throat. Her voice seemed as if it was blocked by someone. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Elder Luo didn’t seem to see the woman’s horror. She walked to the woman’s side and looked up and down at the woman’s skinny bones, her eyes were as cold as examining a dead object, not a person.

“If it weren’t for my witchcraft which has helped you maintain your beautiful face, you will be old and faint. This youth spell is a treasure that only my Sacred Maiden Tribe possesses. To have been used by an outsider like you, you really got a great bargain. It is only natural that you have to return the favour for my tribe.” Elder Luo reached her hand out, smiling, as she forced open the trembling woman’s mouth. With immense fear shining in the woman’s eyes, the bottle of potion was poured into the woman’s mouth....

The potion entered her mouth and flowed into her stomach, and after just a moment, the woman tensed up as if she had a cramp all over her body. Her blood vessels suddenly protruded all over her fair skin, and her eyes were bloodshot. She looked like she was going to explode in the next second.

As the initiator, Elder Luo just used a pair of unemotional eyes to record the woman’s reaction little by little.
