Chapter 260: “Twelve Peaks (2)”

With the appearance of the Sovereign and the Elders, the youths were bursting with excitement as they stood ramrod straight and tried to stretch to stand as tall as their small still developing bodies would allow them, trying their best to impress the Sovereign and Elders by showing how “gallant” and “imposing” they are.

Unknown to the hundreds of youths who had made it through the three tests, the actual test was just about to begin. How many of them will remain in the Qing Yun Clan was not known yet.

Qin Yue stood before the mass of pumped up youths, his chin lifted, as he surveyed them as he would a batch of materials. He nodded at a disciple standing at the side and the disciple stepped forward to announce the criteria for the final assessment to the crowd.

“To be qualified to join the Qing Yun Clan, you must possess extraordinary abilities. The Qing Yun Clan does not just accept anybody. You might have passed the initial three tests, but that does not mean you are one of us yet. Your performance in the upcoming test will be the deciding factor on whether you are fit to join the Qing Yun Clan.....”

To be specific, for this last test, there was no criteria. The Qing Yun Clan just needed the hundreds of youths to showcase their best display of medical skills before the Sovereign and the various Elders.

It could be treatment, ability to concoct elixirs and medicines. As long as it was outstanding, they would win acceptance into the Qing Yun Clan.

Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes, this seemingly simple test was in fact to make it easier for the Elders to select suitable candidates.

The Elders of the eleven peaks were specialised in different fields of medicine, and their selection were usually based on candidates whose strengths aligned with theirs.

Mu Chen was specialised in the nurturing and development of veins and arteries, while Ke Cang Ju portrayed his expertise as the planting and cultivation of medicinal herbs. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jun Wu Xie decided on entering Mu Chen’s Cloud Treading Peak, and would naturally display her expertise on veins and arteries.

“Hey, have you decided on which peak you want to go to?” Qiao Chu noticed that Jun Wu Xie had been silent and bumped his elbow against Jun Wu Xie’s.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at him, frowning slightly.

The youths around them heard Qiao Chu and they were shocked. They proceeded to stare at Jun Wu Xie and Qiao Chu from head to toe and saw that Jun Wu Xie was dressed in common clothes but Qiao Chu who was standing next to her could only be described as wretched. Qiao Chu could have been considered not bad looking but his worn out and patched clothes which had been washed thin made him look like a beggar on the street.

They all thought the two of them were shameless to even think they could choose the peak they liked when they were dressed so shabbily!

Qiao Chu finally noticed the disparaging glares directed at them. He narrowed his eyes and shook his fist at the few skinny youths who stood around them but that only won him more lowly muttered curses thrown in their direction.

“Brute!”

Qiao Chu could not be bothered with them and continued to badger Jun Wu Xie on her choice. Jun Wu Xie was slightly bothered by his persistence and finally muttered, almost in a whisper: “Cloud Treading Peak.”

“Cloud Treading Peak? Why do you want to go to the Cloud Treading Peak?” Qiao Chu was stunned. The Cloud Treading Peak was the smallest among the twelve peaks and had the weakest reputation. Even its Elder was only twenty over years old, how capable could he be? “Hey, let’s not go to Cloud Treading Peak, how about we go to the Hidden Cloud Peak? At Hidden Cloud Peak, we will only need to grow flowers and plants and be a gardener. Doesn’t it sound relaxing? Even as a new disciple, there won’t be much for us to do.”

And the criteria to enter is extremely low! This last statement, Qiao Chu chose to keep to himself.

“Not me.” Jun Wu Xie said coldly.

Hidden Cloud Peak relaxing? Only those who had died under mysterious and unexplained circumstances would find it relaxing.
