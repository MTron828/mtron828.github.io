Blood Velvet’s smile became even more brilliant.

“It should be me?”

“What do you mean by... it should be..” Fei Yan was depressed by such an ambiguous answer.

“Well, it’s better that you do not touch him. Little Blood Ball is not a good thing, what he is best at is to parasitize its seeds in the body of other creatures and use their blood as nourishment. Once parasitized, it is impossible to separate from it and you can only let it continue to grow in the body until it grows and blooms. When this flower blooms, the host would become all dried and shrivelled up, Little Blood Ball here blooms the most vividly at the time when its host has no blood left.” Poppy kindly explained as he shrugged his shoulders.

“....” In a mere instant, Fei Yan immediately retreated back five metres from Blood Velvet!

Whoa!

This plant was not poisonous, did not eat people but such an effect was even way more terrifying than being able to eat a person up!

Just the mere feeling of a plant growing in his own body and using his flesh as the soil and his blood as nutrient.... Just the thought about it was a type of torture!

“Poppy, if you are going to be vilifying me like that, I will be very upset.” Blood Velvet looked at Poppy with a troubled expression and the smile on Poppy’s face instantly stiffened.

The others did not know but the few of them understood Blood Velvet’s temperament the best. He looked very amicable and easy to get along with, he had on a bright smile all day long and did not seem to have any temper. However, the truth was the complete opposite, among all the ring spirits, be it brutality or bloodthirst, no one could be compared to Blood Velvet.

“I seem to finally understand why we have never met them before.” Rong Ruo touched her chin thoughtfully.

That malodorous stench from the corpse flower, let alone them, even the other plants could not endure it. Crystal orchid’s natural growth characteristics make the other plant ring spirits retreat from him whenever they see him and even blood velvet ... there is no need to mention it any further.

Fortunately, these three had never appeared before others, otherwise who knows what kind of troubles would they bring along.

Compared with them, Rong Ruo and the rest suddenly thought that Poison Ivy was just a small fresh sprout in front of these plant spirits, what were a few whips?

After they had been introduced to each and every of Jun Wu Xie’s new ring spirits, Qiao Chu and the rest had refreshed their mindsets once again. Jun Wu Xie’s journey on this bloody path was adamant and there was no road to return!

“Cough... These are all, right?” Fan Zhuo cleared his throat and as calm as a person he was, he too was blinded by the outstanding lineup of Jun Wu Xie’s ring spirits.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly.

Because of the Devious Wyvern and the spirit tree, her soul was no longer confined to one ring spirit and as her strength increased, her soul became more and more stable. Even the effects of the Devious Wyvern have been brought forth. Blood Velvet and the rest had appeared over the years as her strength had improved, even the Soaring Serpent that had been devoured had already been completely digested and not a trace was left.

“Then... Shall we depart tomorrow?” Fan Zhuo asked.

“Alright.” Jun Wu Xie agreed.

After having their meal, Jun Wu Xie was led away by Jun Xian to ask her more about how she passed those few years by and if she had suffered any hardships or grievances. Most of the time, she was listening and occasionally responded with a few lines but those warmth from the concern of family had flowed into her heart and let her cold heart melt bit by bit. She could not refuse the concern showered by her loved ones and even in the depths of her heart, though she knew that she was being too greedy but with the situation at hand, she was not allowed to relax.

If Jun Wu Xie was not rescued and the revenge for Yan Bu Gui and Ren Huang’s revenge not exacted, she would never be able to accept such warmth in peace.
