The six of them had been apart from each other for so long and had finally gotten together. Only after a long time did they finally let go and wipe off their tears silently. If not for Long Qi who had coughed two times, they were not willing to let go at all.

“Long Qi has brought forth the Rui Lin Army to greet Young Miss! Welcome back Young Miss!” Long Qi went down on one knee as he said with the utmost sincerity and reverence as he welcomed Jun Wu Xie back. Behind him, tens of thousand soldiers of the Rui Lin Army immediately followed suit and the entire army stretched all the way out of the city.

Five years of waiting... five years of persistence had finally paid off.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the neat rows of Rui Lin Army soldiers and when she swept her gaze over them, she saw many familiar faces and each and everyone of them was stained with tears. There was elation as well as excitement apparent on their faces.

“Young Miss, it is not advisable to stay here for long. After Su Jing Yan and his people go back, the Upper Realm that are controlling the Nine Temples would definitely act. Why don’t... we head back first?” Although Ye Sha was reluctant to disturb Jun Wu Xie’s moment, he proposed this as he still had some worries.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

Qiao Chu seemed to be afraid that Jun Wu Xie would leave without saying a word once again as he immediately rushed to her side before she even raised her foot. Holding on tightly to her arm, he looked at her with a brilliant smile on his face and said, “Big Brother Ye Sha, where are we going? Is it the Dark Regions?” Qiao Chu’s eyes were sparkling, during the past five years, the Upper Realm had instructed the Nine Temples to purge the Middle Realm and even the Spirit World had been forced to relocate to the Lower Realm. Only the Dark Regions had not been discovered by anyone and if one did not know that the Dark Regions was in the Middle Realm, they would have suspected that the Dark Regions was like the Spirit World who had moved away from this accursed land.

Having passed many years under such sombre and oppressive atmosphere, it was rare to meet someone happy-go-lucky like Qiao Chu. Even Ye Sha was infected by his smile and he turned to look at Jun Wu Xie. Only after he saw Jun Wu Xie nod her head did he reply: “If you do not mind, you are welcome to live in the Dark Regions.”

“Don’t mind! Don’t mind! We don’t mind it one bit! Let’s set off quickly! This place is a complete mess and is not suitable for reminiscing at all. Let’s go!” Qiao Chu exclaimed happily as he guffawed.

Everyone had been amused by his laughter and vivid expressions. At this time, it was people like him that were needed to bring joy to everyone. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Let’s go.” Jun Wu Xie said.

The people of the Night Regime led the way and brought the Rui Lin Army towards the Dark Regions.

Along the way, Qiao Chu stayed by Jun Wu Xie’s side and did not leave. He did not send the Yin Yang Bear back and whenever she was silent, he would immediately nudge it to come forward and give her a hug filled with love.

The Yin Yang Bear knew its role and in the end, it simply put Jun Wu Xie in its arms and walked as its soft and furry paws brought a huge sense of security to her.

They had made such a din that Jun Wu Xie became helpless and on that cold face of hers, there was another expression other than the usual coldness.

Even the black beast by the side who had noticed the subtle changes in her expression could not help but reveal a smile. Perhaps these were not enough for her to completely open her closed self but for the five years that have passed, this was an excellent change that proved that Ye Sha’s decision was right.

Rising winds and scudding clouds, a huge change that would stir the entire three realms had begun. As the waves stirred, Qiao Chu and the rest were on their way to the Dark Regions to have a look at the glory that Jun Wu Yao had built with his own hands.
