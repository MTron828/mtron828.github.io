Jun Wu Xie then looked up and said: “Get your men to retreat, or I do not think I’ll be able to control my strength with the next slash of this sword.”

The Second Disciple no longer dared to take a harsh stand against Jun Wu Xie anymore. To the human spirits, Wu Jiu was really just too important and as one of his disciples, the position and authority he enjoyed had only been possible because of Wu Jiu. If Wu Jiu was gone, then all of them would fall into dire straits together with him and hence, after thinking through it, the Second Disciple had to get the human spirits to retreat back a few steps.

“All of you step back as well.” Jun Wu Xie turned her head to say as she looked at the human spirits and Weapon Spirits surrounding them from the back. The human spirits had naturally not dared to make any rash moves but to step back in retreat, but the Weapon Spirits led by Soul Slayer were seemingly rather unwilling to back away.

Jun Wu Xie then said: “If Wu Jiu is dead, the Weapon Spirits will never be able to possess their own Serene Spirit Tower their entire lives. So you better consider it carefully.”

Soul Slayer was feeling so conflicted he wanted to die. Considering itself as one of the reigning powers within the Spirit World, when had he ever been threatened by a little lass like this before? But Jun Wu Xie now had her hand grasping their vitals.

The Weapon Spirits were willing to do everything for the Serene Spirit Tower, to the extent even when they knew that the construction needed the Spiritual Bear to be used as a sacrifice before it could be completed, they had abandoned their sense of righteousness and stood on Wu Jiu’s side, as the importance they had placed upon the Serene Spirit Tower outweighed all of that.

Soul Slayer led the Weapon Spirits to retreat to the side reluctantly, opening up a wide open path for Jun Wu Xie and the others in the middle.

The land that had just seen a highly intense battle was a little messed up. No one noticed that the soil on the ground had suddenly started to quake for no apparent reason. But the scale of that shaking was very minute and covered with a layer of soft soil, it did not feel to be all that distinct. Moreover, the attention of all the spirits were all drawn and focused upon Jun Wu Xie, who would go pay any notice to the slight imperceptible rumble?

“You want me to let all of you go, but I cannot let myself trust you. I’ll promise you now, if you release my Master, I will let all of you leave this place safe and sound.” The Second Disciple attempted to save Wu Jiu one more time.

However, Jun Wu Xie still left him dangling.

At the back of the battlefield, Brownie had finally finished carving out the Spirit Reinforcement runes and when he saw the constant stream of power of the spirit flowing gradually from the Spirit Reinforcement rune circle onto Nalan Shan’s body, slowly filling up Nalan Shan’s frail spirit, Brownie finally blew out a breath of relief. It was aware of the situation up ahead in front but Nalan Shan’s condition did not allow it to leave. Nalan Shan was so frail and weak at that moment that any single attack from any Weapon Spirit or human spirit would scatter and dissipate his spirit, hence, Brownie had no choice but to stand guard at his side.

The sound of a slight trace of the earth’s turning suddenly attracted Brownie’s attention. Brownie raised its eyes and looked in front of itself. It discovered that the earth under Nalan Shan’s body was suddenly pushed up by several vines. Before Brownie was even able to feel nervous, it immediately saw the little purple flower buds on those vines and it quickly recognized where those vines had originated from. It raised its head up in that instant and looked at the spirirts up in front.

A far distance away, Brownie saw Poison Ivy standing there with his back towards everyone, and making a shushing gesture, asking him to remain silent.

Brownie’s heart jumped, not daring to make a sound, as Poison Ivy’s vines slowly curled around Nalan Shan and Brownie.....

On the other side, the Second Disciple was about to go mad. Seeing that his Master was tormented half to death under Jun Wu Xie’s foot, he wished for nothing more than to be able to jump over and tear Jun Wu Xie to shreds. However..... Wu Jiu was still in Jun Wu Xie’s hands, and no matter how much hatred was brewing inside him, he did not dare to jump out and shed all pretense of cordiality with Jun Wu Xie at that moment.

Jun Wu Xie then said: “You do not believe me, and I cannot make myself trust you. Why not.....” Jun Wu Xie’s words had not yet even fallen to the ground when she suddenly lifted up her foot and sent Wu Jiu, who was lying upon the ground, to go flying with a mighty kick!
