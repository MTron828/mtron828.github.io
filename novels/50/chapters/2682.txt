The matter of a powerful city to send the children of the City Lord to a weaker city was an extremely incredible thing itself. It was even rarer to have them stay in the city for a long period of time, but Zheng Weilong had already lived in Long Xuan City for a month. A few days later, she received some news and that made her stay in Long Xuan City for a little while longer.

Why wouldn’t Zheng Weilong understand such intricacies?

She may not be outstanding in appearance, not to mention her strength, but it was not easy to survive till this day.

Marriage arrangements between the 72 cities weren’t uncommon. Usually, the powerful city marries its daughter to the weaker city. On one hand, it was to win over the power, and the other was to plant a spy on the other side. In the Upper Realm, everything was full of undisguised interests.

Zheng Weilong knew very well that she was a pawn used by Zheng Ke to turn Ruan Zhongshan into a chess piece.

The only use for a waste was to tuck her faraway in a remote city ...

Zheng Weilong lowered her eyes, not knowing what was on her mind, the servant girl did not dare to speak.

On the other side, after Ruan Zhongshan affirmed that the elixir of the Sea Spirit City was the real deal and after determining that there were no side effects, he immediately decided to set off for Sea Spirit City in person and have a good chat with the new City Lord.

However, before leaving, Ruan Zhongshan did not forget another “esteemed guest” in the manor. After not meeting Zheng Weilong for several days, Ruan Zhongshan prepared a banquet the night before leaving and invited Zheng Weilong to dine together.

Under the moonlight, the city’s main residence was brightly lit.

Ruan Zhongshan sat in front of the table in a luxurious black robe, with servants serving him, while Zheng Weilong who sat opposite him, was wearing a simple dress, she exuded a pleasant feeling that was simple yet dignified.

“I have to apologise for neglecting Young Miss Zheng over the past few days. I beseech Young Miss Zheng to forgive by rudeness.” Ruan Zhongshan was in a good mood because of the matters of the Sea Spirit City and even the smile on his face deepened.

Zheng Weilong smiled calmly and said, “Why are you saying this? You are the City Lord and you still need to take care of all the matters in Long Xuan City. I have been intruding for so long, who am I to say such matters of apologies?”

Ruan Zhongshan laughed heartily and drank a few glasses of fine wine. Very soon, a little drunkenness became apparent on his face as he looked at Zheng Weilong carefully.

Ruan Zhongshan was not young anymore and he had married many wives before, and those ladies eventually disappeared out of people’s sight. The underlying reason that Zheng Ke sent Zheng Weilong to Ruan Zhongshan was naturally clear to him. To be honest, Zheng Weilong’s appearance was really ordinary and if not for her identity, he would not even take a second glance at her. But what really caught his attention was the Discerning Moon City behind Zheng Weilong.

With the status of Long Xuan City, it was really difficult to climb up the ranks but if it was allied with the Discerning Moon City, it would naturally be the best thing. He didn’t care whether Zheng Weilong would monitor himself, if he couldn’t even handle one woman, he really would be useless.

Being in a good mood coupled with the intoxication of the fine wine, Zheng Weilong who looked plain normally also looked special under the silvery moonlight. Ruan Zhongshan laughed sinisterly in his heart.

After he had his hands on the elixir of the Sea Spirit City, he must give not disappoint Zheng Ke’s “good intentions” and “settle” Zheng Weilong.

“Young Miss Zheng is too kind. It Is unfortunate that I have some things to deal with tomorrow, and I may not be in the city over the next few days. If Young Miss Zheng needs anything, you can tell the steward.” Ruan Zhongshan chortled and said.
