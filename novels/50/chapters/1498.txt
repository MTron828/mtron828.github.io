Chapter 1499: “Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom (3)”

When the Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s Ring Spirit awoke, he was merely a youth of fourteen years old. And as he was born to be rather frail, his body’s constitution had not been very healthy then. After his plant type Ring Spirit awoke, the Spirit Ring did not manifest physically, hence the Spirit Jade Palace Lord most probably did not even know that his Ring Spirit had awoken.

Even more so, he wouldn’t know why he was suddenly prone to feelings and emotions that completely did not arise from himself.

If it had been feelings towards other things, it would not have affected him that badly. But, Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom had no feelings towards females and only liked young youthful boys.

The then fourteen year old Spirit Jade Palace Lord was surrounded by many youthful boys around his age he hung out with and based on how excited Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom had been when he saw Drunk Lotus, it was not hard to imagine the kind of feelings that Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom would have felt at that time that would have led the Spirit Jade Palace Lord to want to commit some unimaginably dastardly deeds.

The prime youth that the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had been at that time, was properly wrecked by Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom then. Which normal and ordinary youth would be able to tolerate the fact that he was going around to touch his fellow friends of similar gender inappropriately?

The way Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom influenced the young Spirit Jade Palace Lord, caused him to develop a huge psychological phobia deep within. To the extent where after many years had passed, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord started to abhor any males that he came to encounter, to the extent that he would be unwilling to even touch anything that a male person had touched before.

He did not want himself to ever develop any feelings beyond the boundaries of friendship with the other youthful boys and he could not accept that the urges were rising from within his own body. Before he came to discover the truth behind Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom, for a very long period of time, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord lived his life bogged down under that huge psychological trauma.

Jun Wu Xie listened quietly till Poppy finished with his explanation, her heart suddenly rising with feelings of rejoice. She had thought that Little Lotus and Poppy were rather eccentric and abnormal, but compared to Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom, she suddenly felt as if her two Ring Spirits couldn’t be anymore normal.

She could not imagine what it would be like, if she herself was to be influenced by Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom, to go hit on some young boys.

At that moment, it was on this rare occasion that Jun Wu Xie felt great sympathy for the Spirit Jade Palace Lord.

“No wonder the Spirit Jade Palace only accepts females as disciples.” Jun Wu Xie said as she stared at Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom, the biggest cause behind it.

“Haiz.” When that was brought up, Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom still had the cheek to appear exceptionally dejected.

After speaking a little while more, Jun Wu Xie then asked Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom to leave. When Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom was leaving, Little Lotus still hung on longingly upon his sleeve, reminding Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom that he must come more often to visit. Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom nodded vehemently, but his eyes were filled with a look that said, “never”.

Until Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom left, Little Lotus then picked up a wine jug and gulped it all down where Drunk Lotus immediately jumped out, to pin Poppy onto the ground to give him another good thrashing.

Jun Wu Xie remained seated at the table, calm and composed as she tended to the flowers.

“My Lord..... About the person you asked me to locate, we are still unable to find him.” A man said, as he stood with a highly sorrowful face within a loft.

Beside the window of the loft, a little old man holding a walking stick in his hand turned his head around slowly, his eyes bright and fiery as he stared in burning rage as he boomed: “What a bunch of morons! ! I have even painted a portrait of that kid for all of you to match it to him and the entire bunch of you still can’t locate him! ? All of you are just..... so stupid!”

The man lowered his head in embarrassment, and then said a little nervously: “Half of the fifteen days have already passed. If we still do not find him in the next few days, the Battle of Deities.....”

“Hmph! Let that bunch of dimbulbs from the Twelve Palaces continue to wait then.” The little old man snorted derisively.

The man just felt like sobbing at that moment.

“My Lord, we can’t do that right? It had already been pushed back by a whole half month and if we delay it further, it might not be that appropriate.”

The little old man drew in a deep breath. “Alright..... Just let it commence when time’s up.”
