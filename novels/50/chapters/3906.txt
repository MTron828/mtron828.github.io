Jun Wu Xie lifted her head up in surprise and looked at the woman’s eyes that were filled with affability. After hesitating for a while, she asked. “Can I?”

The woman nodded her head.

“If you guys aren’t in a hurry, you may stay here for a few days,” said the woman.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Wu Yao then gave her a pampering smile.

“It’s alright for us to stay for a few days, we’re not in a hurry.”

The Sea Spirit Beast hunting ships from the Upper Realm probably wouldn’t go far away from them for these few days. Getting some rest in the island would do good in staggering both their sailing hours. And of course, it was mainly because of Jun Wu Xie who wanted to stay.

A trace of a smile went across Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

Since they had decided to stay for a few days, the first thing Ye Gu did after the storm was to go and inform the Night Regime and the Ghost Army who were staying on the ships so that they would sail their ships, according to the woman’s instruction, into a hidden bay on the island. The ships of the Upper Realm wouldn’t notice the ten ships hidden by them as long as they didn’t pass by the facade of the bay.

Qiao Chu and the rest of them stayed at the haven of the Sea Spirit Beasts, enjoying the fantastic underwater world. Meanwhile, for the period of time, Jun Wu Xie was learning the method of cultivating the psychic force from the woman.

The woman didn’t tell Jun Wu Xie her full name but just asked Jun Wu Xie to call her “Zi Fei”.

The cultivation for the psychic force wasn’t complicated. One just needed to constantly condense the psychic force and increase the consumption of the force so that its capacity could be extended after it was used up. Though the progression of the cultivation was quite slow, it wasn’t considered difficult to learn.

Jun Wu Xie was able to learn the technique quickly and this had gotten Zi Fei a little surprised.

“You’re quite talented.” With a smile in her voice, Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie on the floor who had just released all her psychic force.

It was an indescribable feeling but the more she got along with this small little lady, the more she liked her.

However, she must admit that Jun Wu Xie’s psychic force was very strong. For a person outside the Sacred Maiden Tribe, the psychic force that Jun Wu Xie had was astonishingly strong, but the powerful strength owned by Jun Wu Xie might be the reason of her strong psychic force, which resulted Zi Fei in not thinking much about it despite being surprised.

“Really?” Jun Wu Xie wiped off the sweat on her forehead. The interaction between Zi Fei and her went really well. They knew each other just not long time ago but there wasn’t any estrangement between them. This was quite a rare case for her since up till today, Jun Wu Xie still hadn’t gotten used to strangers getting close to her.

“Just cultivate a little longer, you should be able to vaguely sense the thoughts of some beasts.” Naturally, Zi Fei sat beside Jun Wu Xie while Jun Wu Yao was just sitting aside quietly, looking at them without disturbing them.

Zi Fei took a look on Jun Wu Yao with her smiling eyes. She truly wouldn’t have thought that the past Ye Jue would actually turn into the wife-loving man he was today where his eyes were filled only with his deep affection towards his wife.

“What are you guys planning to do in the Upper Realm? To be honest, I wouldn’t suggest you to go to the Upper Realm during this period of time. I heard it from the Sea Spirit Beasts a few months ago that the Upper Realm had sent a troop to the Middle Realm. I’m not sure if they are going to do something big.” Zi Fei couldn’t help herself from getting worried for them. Her hatred and animosity towards the Upper Realm was implacable.

Thinking of something, Jun Wu Xie secretly touched the peak of her nose... Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

She knew why did the Upper Realm sent their army and... those soldiers had all been buried in the Lower Realm now. The Upper Realm might have already gotten some news. Though there would be some danger, she wasn’t afraid at all.

However, it wasn’t appropriate for her to talk much about all these things to Zi Fei.

She could only avoid the important and choose to dwell on the trivial. “I need to go to the Upper Realm to search for my father.”
