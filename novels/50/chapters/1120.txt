Chapter 1121: “Crumble and Fall (2)” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qu Ling Yue had never once thought that she would fall into such a state one day. She had carefully protected her chastity and always thought that she would give to her beloved everything that was most precious to her, but that had been cruelly stripped from her, together with her dignity, her spirit, all ground into tiny broken pieces, never to be put back together again.

“I beg you..... Do not look at me..... Can you please leave..... I’m really filthy..... dirty..... I beg you..... go.....” The Qu Ling Yue of the past had yearned so hard to be able to interact with Jun Xie, but now, she felt she wasn’t even qualified to be in the same room as him. She didn’t want Jun Xie to see the such an ugly and hideous her and Jun Xie’s gaze only made her feel unimaginably ashamed of herself.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and looked at Qu Ling Yue’s trembling figure.

Suddenly, she knelt down on one knee by the bed, and pulled Qu Ling Yue out from under the blanket with a quick tug!

“No! !” Utter despair filled Qu Ling Yue’s eyes, but as weak as she was, she was unable to resist it. She was dragged out from under the blanket, her face all streaked with tears, her trembling lips revealing how terrified she was feeling.

“Don’t look at me..... Please..... Don’t look at me.....”

Jun Wu Xie ignored Qu Ling Yue’s begging plea and held Qu Ling Yue by the shoulder with one hand, the other lifting Qu Ling Yue’s head by the chin, forcing Qu Ling Yue to look at her in the eyes.

“What are you so afraid of.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Qu Ling Yue’s sight was already blurred by her tears and she wanted to break free, but she did not have the strength, but to only shake her head helplessly.

“I’m just so filthy..... so filthy..... I beg of you..... Do not come again. Will you please just go? I do not want you to see me looking like this.....” Why was she even alive? Why was she not dead instead? Qu Ling Yue already had no will to live and she would rather she had died in that cell than have to face Jun Xie again.

Qu Ling Yue’s eyes were red from crying and she was choking so hard on her sobs that she could only take intermittent breaths in between them.

Jun Xie held on to Qu Ling Yue’s hands and brought them up before her eyes.

The fair tiny hands were filled with many small cuts and wounds. The wounds have been carefully tended to and they have begun to scab.

“Who said you are filthy? I had you all washed and you are all clean now.” Jun Wu Xie said, her eyes fixed on Qu Ling Yue.

Qu Ling Yue turned away, refusing to even look at herself.

“Let me go..... Don’t even bother about me.....” She continued to plead helplessly.

The current her, even felt that her very soul had become absolutely filthy and she wished so much that she was already dead, or completely demented, so she wouldn’t have to face all of this now.

There was nothing, more than having Jun Xie see her in this state, that would drive her to become so traumatised.

“Your mother is dead.” Jun Wu Xie then said.

The struggling Qu Ling Yue suddenly froze completely, her eyes widening as she stared in disbelief at Jun Xie.

“Your mother had been severely ill from the early onset and Qu Xin Rui did not get anyone to give her any treatment and even ordered for her dead body to be disposed in the wild, leaving it there for wild beasts to feed.” Jun Wu Xie’s voice was so cold it would make people shiver.

Qu Ling Yue was overcome with shock. She sat staring blankly on the bed, tears rolling down her face uncontrollably.

“Your Father has gone mad. If you die, then I will leave him to continue with his madness. If you want me to cure your father, you will have to live on.” Jun Wu Xie said, looking at Qu Ling Yue very seriously, her tone of voice hard and unyielding.

Qu Ling Yue then looked up in shock at Jun Xie.
