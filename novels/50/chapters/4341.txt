“I don’t think the Lord is deliberately trying to make things difficult for Little Xie through this selection, because it is not something he has done before. I do think he is using it as a test.” Han Zi Fei’s eyes narrowed slightly. “It is a test of how much strength Little Xie has, and whether it is enough to make him pay attention.”

Han Zi Fei’s words made Jun Gu and others fall into silence. Whether it was to make life difficult or a test, there was only one consistent point.

And that was that this selection was set up by His Lord specifically for Jun Wu Xie and nobody knew what would happen while it was running its course.

“Your mother may be right. Little Xie, you have to remember to be careful of Long Yao. He is His Lord’s first step to deal with you, and you will have to deal with him all by yourself. Your mother and I’s greatest desire is to see you safe and sound. Remember that in any situation, protect yourself! ”

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. The closer she got to His Lord, the more she realised that danger was everywhere.

......

On the Sacred City’s streets, Fei Yan was following Rong Ruo and not for a second did his gaze move away from Rong Ruo. Perhaps his stare was too obvious and after walking for a while, Rong Ruo could not help but turn around and look at Fei Yan.

Fei Yan was startled, and he averted his gaze stiffly and said: “The Sacred City is so big, but there are so many experts here. If in the future, Little Xie battles with His Lord here, I am afraid that it will be a fierce battle. With our current strength, we will not be of much help and I don’t know if there is any way to quickly improve our strength.”

Rong Ruo looked at the rambling Fei Yan with a smile. Although she knew what he was doing just now, she didn’t reveal it and very gently said, “If you want to improve your strength, you cannot do it overnight. However as long as we keep working hard, there will always be progress. Our strength may not be comparable to those with the Spirit Rings, but we have Ring Spirits. This is what people in the Upper Realm do not have, and it is our greatest advantage. ”

Ring Spirits, this kind of spirit had never been seen in the Upper Realm, was an inseparable binding for Rong Ruo. She believed that if used properly, it would have great effects in future battles.

“Unfortunately, this place is full of danger. I haven’t released the Ring Spirits for a long time, and I don’t know if it will be badly repressed.” Fei Yan sighed.

Rong Ruo laughed, said no more as she continued walking forward.

Fei Yan’s eyes could not help but rest on Rong Ruo’s back once more. Rong Ruo’s was very tall, not as petite as Jun Wu Xie, and not as graceful as the average woman, it was almost as if she moved with the freedom and ease of the man. But to Fei Yan, it was the most beautiful sight in the world, one that he would not tire of looking at everyday for the rest of his life.

He wanted to get closer, but did not know what to do. Fei Yan did not dare not take a step forward as he once tried that, but was rejected. Now he can only bury his love in his heart and go along as before as if it didn’t exist.
