3063 Battle Of The Gods 3

The God of Light was intoxicated by the feeling of being in love and believed the God of Destruction. He assumed human form and left paradise to spend a few days with the woman.

But....

When the God of Light returned to paradise, everything was over.

When he left paradise, the balance between him and the God of Destruction was lost. Many Gods were killed and the only ones who remained were the cruel God of Intentions and the God of Destruction who was dripping in blood and laughing maniacally.

That was the first time the God of Light felt rage. Looking at a face identical to his, his normally calm temperament gave way to violent intentions.

However.....

He could not act on those feelings.

The God of Destruction had abducted the woman that the God of Light was in love with, to blackmail him into giving up his resistance.

The God of Light eventually relented....

“I am not a stubborn God, or maybe I stopped being a God when I fell in love with that woman...” the God of Light spoke slowly with anguish and annoyance but with no regret.

“I’m sorry, the mess today is a result of my weakness then. Being imprisoned here is also what I deserve.” The God of Light sighed and looked up to face Jun Wu Xie again.

“I know that he needs to do certain things to complete his plan of breaking the void. I also know that a God who has lost his power would come here. I just didn’t expect it to be you.” The God of Light suddenly spoke in a very respectful tone.

Jun Wu Xie looked at the God of Light in confusion.

“I don’t recognise you but I can feel your aura. In the heavens, no God is omnipotent. We were once weak, small and didn’t know how to use our powers. Then, the Lord of Gods sent a messenger to teach us how to use our powers and create this world. You have the same aura as that messenger, you might be a messenger of the Lord of Gods.” the God of Light said gently.

Jun Wu Xie was stunned and recalled the dream she had at the Spirit Tree. In the dream, she was teaching two children amidst much chaos, just as the God of Lights had described.

“Lord of Gods? What is that?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

The God of Light went on, “That is the level that the God of Destruction wants to reach by breaking the void. There are many worlds in existence, not just the one we are in and the Lord of Gods controls them all while not existing in any one of them. He selects outstanding Gods from each world to bring them into the void. It is a pity that he has come to our world but only once and none of the Gods here were good enough to be selected before he left. It was after he left that the God of Destruction, after feeling the power of the void, wants to reach that level....”

Jun Wu Xie was getting more and more confused. The Lord of Gods that the God of Light was telling her about was beyond anything she knew and beyond even the world she lived in. However, according to what the God of Light was saying, the version of her who appeared in another world to teach both the golden haired and purple haired children was sent by the Lord of Gods?
