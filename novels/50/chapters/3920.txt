Located in the coastal area along the border of the Upper Realm, the Sea Spirit City was one of the most lively places in the Upper Realms. From the pier to the city, you could see many shirtless coolies transporting boxes of the Sea Spirit Beast carcasses from the dock.

These people were the lowest rung of the Upper Realm hierarchy. Although their spiritual power were Gold Spirits, but it was very weak. They could not maintain it for a long time during battles. In the Upper Realm, Gold Spirits were no longer worth anything. You could grab anyone off the streets and the person would be a Gold Spirit at least. But the depth of strength was unknown.

The pier was filled with Sea Spirit City people. Along the coast line, the ships filled with cargoes were docked, anchors were dropped and the ladders were unfurled. Countless of carcasses were transferred from the ships to land.

The ship that was first docked had all been unloaded, and a group of people who have been jolting for many days at sea were standing on the edge of the dock and stealing a chance to idle.

“Old Wu, this trip, your harvest is not that much. If you go back, I’m afraid it will be hard to explain.” A shirtless coolie, who was carrying a jar of Sea Spirit Beast blood on his shoulders, smilingly said.

The middle-aged man named Old Wu gave him a very unhappy look, “Damn it, we were given the furthest sea route, how can we manage to catch that many beasts? These wasted almost half my life. Stop pestering me! Go away!”

Although Old Wu was foul-mouthed but he actually felt uncomfortable. Every vessel in the Sea Spirit City fleet had its own mission. Among those ships which departed at the same time, the route given to Old Wu’s two ships was the most barren. Not only was it far, the number of Sea Spirit Beasts was abysmal. They spent a lot of effort and had only caught a dozen or so beast. Even if they had swept the entire area, there was not going to be any more.

Old Wu thought to himself that this mission would be impossible to complete as he turned his head stealthily to look at the other ships that just arrived and saw that those ships had large numbers of Sea Spirit Beast carcasses, hatred making his teeth itch.

For those who were not strong enough in terms of spiritual powers, there is basically no possibility to climb up any further. The room to improve spiritual powers was limited, and they only thing they could do was this sort of manual labour to earn a living. The number of Sae Spirit Beasts was directly related to the amount of income they earned. This made Old Wu very uncomfortable. But... He was the weakest amongst all the other captains, so even if there were any grievances, he could only bear with it.

“Yo.... Young Master’s ship has also come back. It seems that his harvest is not small!” The people at the pier started shouting, the last two ships finally docked, and a finely dressed ‘Yan Hai’ walked down under the attention of many.

Old Wu was dissatisfied and did not dare to show it. The opium pipe which he held was stuck into his waist, and with a charming smile he greeted the “Yan Hai”, along with the other people.

“Have you gotten accustomed to being at sea, since it’s your first time, Young Master? We hear that your harvest is good, it’s really amazing!” A group of people surrounded ‘Yan Hai’ as they flattered and fawned after him.

Taking a broad view of the whole of Sea Spirit City, the one with the most potential to overtake the current Lord was Young Master Yan Hai. Almost everyone acknowledged that Yan Hai would be the next city Lord and for their own survival, they rushed up to boot-lick Yan Hai.

‘Yan Hai’ remained expressionless as ‘he’ walked past these people, and turned a deaf ear to those congratulatory words.
