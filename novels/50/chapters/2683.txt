Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Ruan Zhongshan was leaving?

Zheng Weilong was startled but she didn’t show the slightest change of expression on her face. Thinking back on Ruan Zhongshan’s abnormality over the past few days, Zheng Weilong vaguely felt that Ruan Zhongshan’s departure tomorrow was not a simple matter.

“Please rest assured, City Lord.” Zheng Weilong smiled calmly.

The two continued to drink but because Ruan Zhongshan was leaving early tomorrow morning, he did not stay up too late. The slightly drunk Ruan Zhongshan was supported by the steward and left while Zheng Weilong who was also staggering was brought back to her own room by her servant girl.

The moment the door was closed, Zheng Weilong who looked drunk just a second ago, suddenly sobered up and all traces of confusion disappeared. In her pair of bright eyes, the swaying candlelight was reflected.

“Miss?” The servant girl looked at Zheng Weilong with a little surprise.

Zheng Weilong said: “Call Ah Da in.”

“Yes.” The servant girl nodded and immediately left. A moment later, a tall man with a mask appeared in Zheng Weilong’s room.

“What instructions does Young Miss have?”

“Ruan Zhongshan is leaving the city tomorrow, have you found out the reason?” Zheng Weilong looked at Ah Da.

Ah Da replied: “This subordinate found that Ruan Zhongshan assembled most of the soldiers in the city. They will be departing early tomorrow morning.”

Zheng Weilong was surprised. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Do you know where they are headed to?”

Ah Da thought for a while and said, “It seems that they are going to Sea Spirit City.”

“Sea Spirit City?” Zheng Weilong froze for a moment. If Long Xuan City was considered remote, then Sea Spirit City was really the humblest and most remote city out of the 72 cities. If it weren’t for Sea Spirit City that could always supply the Sea Spirit Beasts, it would already have long been swallowed by other cities!

“I seem to remember that before I came to Long Xuan City, Sea Spirit City seemed to have cut off its supply to the 72 cities?” Zheng Weilong seemed to have thought of something.

“Yes.” Ah Da replied.

The fact that the Sea Spirit City suddenly cut off the supply of the Sea Spirit Beasts was the only thing that could make the 72 cities notice it, but no one paid much attention to it. They only sent a few people to probe on the situation, that was it.

But Ruan Zhongshan suddenly amassed his soldiers and ventured to the Sea Spirit City. There was something wrong about this. If it was only for the Sea Spirit Beasts, why not just tell the truth?

Zheng Weilong had a feeling that Ruan Zhongshan’s trip to Sea Spirit City definitely had a huge secret behind it!

“Ah Da!”

“Yes!”

“Get ready, tomorrow we will follow Long Xuan City’s team to Sea Spirit City.” Zheng Weilong took a deep breath.

The servant girl on the sidelines panicked.

“Miss! What are you going to Sea Spirit City? If you leave ... Long Xuan City people would definitely find out that you are missing.”

Zheng Weilong said, “You just need to tell them that I suddenly feel homesick and miss Discerning Moon City terribly and I have no mood to go out. No matter how much they probe, you just need to insist on this point. I don’t believe it that they would really dare to break into Discerning Moon City’s Miss’ courtyard! “At this moment, a glint of toughness flashed by Zheng Weilong’s eyes and this was completely different from the usual gentle and easy image that she portrayed.

The servant girl couldn’t stop Zheng Weilong and could only follow her instructions.

Ah Da immediately went to make the preparations.

When the first rays of sunlight fell on the ground the next morning, Ruan Zhongshan took a team of Long Xuan City’s elite soldiers and journeyed to Sea Spirit City.

Xu Zu, whose strength had soared, was also on his side.

Ruan Zhongshan was full of confidence, but he didn’t know that this trip had kicked off the prelude to a huge change in the Upper Realm!
