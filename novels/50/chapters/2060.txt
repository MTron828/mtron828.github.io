“Alright.” Although Poison Ivy did not know what Jun Wu Xie was going to do, but from Jun Wu Xie’s eyes, he saw confidence. He subconsciously chose to trust Jun Wu Xie with her plan.

“Go tell Little Lotus and Poppy that they do not need to continue to watch the Serene Spirit Tower for this period but just move together with you.” Jun Wu Xie then said.

Poison Ivy nodded, then paused a moment thoughtfully before he looked at Jun Wu Xie to ask. “I have a question.”

“What question?”

“Poppy and Little Lotus.....”

“They are both my Ring Spirits.”

Poison Ivy was finally able to confirm the guess he had in mind.

“I will only remain her in the Spirit World for a year. Now that a good half year has passed, it won’t be much longer that I might have to go back. Are you willing to return with me?” Jun Wu Xie asked, looking at Poison Ivy. She still did not fully understand Poison Ivy’s powers, but from his position among the Plant Spirits, it could be seen that he was definitely not weak.

Poison Ivy knelt on the ground on one knee and said nonchalantly: “I shall willingly accompany my Mistress at her side.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

With his mission in hand, Poison Ivy did not tarry long but to immediately depart, seeking Flame Dragon to discuss the matter.

Till Poison Ivy had left, Qiao Chu and the others then gathered around Jun Wu Xie. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Little Xie, have you come up with a plan to deal with Wu Jiu and Jiang Yun Long?” The moment Qiao Chu saw the smile on Jun Wu Xie’s face earlier, he immediately knew that someone’s time was about to be up. Jun Wu Xie seldom smiled, but when she did, it often meant that someone was about to meet with misfortune.

“I have something in mind, but it’s still not certain. I need to see Brownie first before I can be sure of it.” Jun Wu Xie nodded his head to say

“Then when do we move out?” Qiao Chu could no longer hold back his excitement, wishing for nothing more than to be able to charge right out, and completely cleanse himself of all the aggrievement he had suffered in this place before.

“Clear up this place first.” Jun Wu Xie said, pointing at the Spirit Reinforcement circles on the ground.

Qiao Chu and the others immediately understood Jun Wu Xie’s meaning and the group of youths went over to the Spirit Reinforcement circles inscribed into the ground to wipe them cleanly off.

Jun Wu Yao put both his hands on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulders. What he liked to see the most was when Jun Wu Xie was in such high spirits, looking so confident, that he really could not resist wanting to kiss that pair of eyes that were shining so brightly.

And in actual fact.

Jun Wu Yao did just that.

He planted a light kiss upon Jun Wu Xie’s long curling lashes and squeezed her little cheeks, a feeling that he would never tire off his entire life.

Jun Wu Xie then looked at Jun Wu Yao, her eyes blinking.

“At that time..... You wait at home for me to come back.”

“Alright. I’ll wait for you to come back.” Jun Wu Yao could not help but laugh to say. Those words felt so heartwarming, and he absolutely loved the feeling.

Jun Wu Yao understood what Jun Wu Xie was worried about. And he believed that Jun Wu Xie would be able to deal with all of this.

His Little One was slowly growing up, into a little devil that could hold her own.

Qiao Chu and the others had naturally wisely chosen to disregard the fact they were seeing the pair engaging in obedience training, as they quickly dealt with the clearing up of the area appropriately.

As they left the Tranquil Dream Forest, Jun Wu Yao then reluctantly went back “home”, and Jun Wu Xie had conveniently left the unconscious little black cat in his hands to take care of it. As for Jun Wu Xie and her companions, they went along on their way towards an area near to the fourth Serene Spirit Tower to look for Nalan Shan.

Coming back to the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, a good half year had passed. From the outside, the construction of the entire Serene Spirit Tower looked to be fully complete, and outside around the tower, there were many Weapon Spirits who took on the guarding of the place from the human spirits, as they stood before the Serene Spirit Tower.
