Chapter 2102: The Lull Before the Storm (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Fan Zhuo’s Ring Spirit was a Weapon Spirit. This time, his and Rong Ruo’s Hell Butterfly suffered the lightest injuries. Even Poison Ivy, Poppy and Drunk Lotus were wounded. After Jun Wu Xie sabotaged the first Serene Spirit Tower’s Spirit Reinforcement runes, the little black cat had recovered and transformed into the black beast where it battled valiantly. It was now plopped in its little black cat form by Jun Wu Xie’s feet, looking highly obediently.

Although Flame Dragon was not around, but the Beast Spirits were still sternly keeping watch, afraid that with their two leaders not with them, the human spirits would join hands with their Weapon Spirits and come stir up trouble. The Beast Spirits who had not gone to the first Serene Spirit Tower had already come to know Wu Jiu’s insidious plot from their companions and they all hated Wu Jiu right into their bones.

All the spirits there were waiting, waiting for the Spirit Lord to provide them with a reasonable result.

But that wait went on for the entire day. Under the dim skies of the Spirit World, it was impossible to tell day from night, but to count the time passing with their fingers.

After waiting for a whole day, they did not see Flame Dragon and the others return and Qiao Chu was getting a little impatient.

“What happened? Didn’t Flame Dragon say that it would come back after half a day at most?” Qiao Chu could not help but to go running out to the mouth of Flame Dragon’s cave and glance around , his head tilted up towards the sky, hating the fact he could not magically wish them back.

“Wu Jiu has stirred up such a huge incident this time and the Spirit Lord must have flown into such a great rage that it wouldn’t be abnormal that he wasn’t able to calm himself down for quite awhile. That whatever Spirit Lord could very well be thinking how Wu Jiu is to be punished. We’ll just wait for a while more, what’s the rush.” Fei Yan said as he swept his glance over Qiao Chu. As a spirit now or when he was a normal human, that dolt had not possessed much in the way of patience.

Qiao Chu pursed his lips in a pout, seemingly not calmed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie glanced over at Qiao Chu, and her gaze finally fell onto Poison Ivy standing over there on the same side.

“Help me properly thank those Plant Spirits who stepped up to help yesterday.” The battle yesterday had been intense but she had not forgotten those few unfamiliar looking figures. It had been because of those Plant Spirits that the situation in that battle had stabilized.

“Mm I’ve thanked them.” Poison Ivy answered, but he seemed a little distracted.

“Poison Ivy.”

“What?” Poison Ivy snapped back to his senses, to look at Jun Wu Xie in puzzlement.

“What are you worried about?” Jun Wu Xie’s sharp instincts had detected that Poison Ivy was seemingly bothered.

Poison Ivy furrowed up his brows and paused a second before he said slowly: “I’m not sure.”

“What are you not sure of?”

“Not sure whether what I am thinking is real.”

“If you don’t tell us, how would we know if it’s real or not?”

Poison Ivy sighed, and then walked over to come beside Jun Wu Xie to sit on the ground. It might be due to the fact of his relationship as Ring Spirit and contracted owner with Jun Wu Xie, but Poison Ivy who had always detested coming into contact with humans did not seem to notice his proximity to a human spirit.

“I keep having the feeling that having Flame Dragon go see the Spirit Lord is not a correct decision.”

“Before Flame Dragon left, you have been seemingly highly hesitant to speak your mind. Were you thinking of persuading him to not go?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Poison Ivy nodded.

“I do not doubt the Spirit Lord’s wisdom, but it’s just that in the last hundred years, the feeling the Spirit Lord gives me is rather strange.....”

The Spirit Lord is undoubtedly the ruler of the Spirit World. His existence not only symbolized supreme and unmatched power and authority, but he was also the creator of the Spirit World. Regardless of any spirit from any of the spirit races, they all held absolute respect and gratitude for the Spirit Lord. If not for the Spirit Lord’s creation of the Spirit World, all of them as spirits would then have no choice but to enter the cycle of reincarnation, or to become wild wandering spirits. It could be said that the Spirit Lord was the benefactor of every one of those spirits.
