“Huh? Did you just say.. You are going to the Spirit World?” Qiao Chu widened his eyes and stared at Jun Wu Xie who had just given him a startling announcement. His hand which was holding the chopsticks stiffened. While swallowing his saliva, he looked aside at Hua Yao and the others. It seemed like he was trying to catch their reactions.

“Yeah, I will be going. Qing Song and Long Jiu are going too,” said Jun Wu Xie.

It might be that she was really tired yesterday that she slept in until late morning. It might also have been the feeling of warmth and peace in this home that she had not been back to for so long that let her sleep so soundly. But once she was awake, she immediately went to meet Qiao Chu and the others to discuss with them on her journey to the Spirit World.

There was no doubt that Jun Wu Xie was going to cooperate if it was able to stabilize her condition. Even medicinal pills and treatment weren’t be able to control the abnormality of her body and this was her first time feeling so helpless towards the condition of her own body.

“It’s not that difficult for us to enter the Spirit World now. We can bring you there whenever you want,” said Hua Yao while putting down his chopsticks. He believed that any decision she made had its own meaning.

“Well... Just go if you want to, since Zong Zong and the others missed you too.” Qiao Chu scratched his head. He then suddenly changed the topic of conversation after quietly taking a look at his surroundings and asked surreptitiously. “I have no issues if you are going together with Long Jiu and Qing Song, but how about that annoying guy Situ Heng... Is he going too?”

Situ Heng had been staying with them all the way from the Middle Realm to the Lower Realm and all they saw was just him giving them an unpleasant look on his face. If there was no need for them to take into account the fact that Situ Heng was someone who came from the Soul World, Qiao Chu had always been wanted to beat him up.

“Yeah, he is going,” replied Jun Wu Xie.

“What’s the point of him going... Such annoying person.” Qiao Chu immediately pouted the second he heard that Situ Heng was also going to the Spirit World.

“Forget it. We’re just going to ignore and leave him alone. Since Spirit World is so huge, plus he doesn’t like to stay with us, he can go anywhere he wants after we brought him there. Other than that, we won’t care.” Fei Yan didn’t really think that there was anything for them to be upset about. Just think of him as some nobody, that was it.

After making up their mind, everyone can finally finish their meals peacefully. It was because of Jun Wu Xie’s return that made Chu Qiao and the others were able to scrounge food shamelessly in Lin Palace. Although Jun Xi missed his granddaughter very much, he didn’t want to interrupt the interactions between the young. Furthermore, he felt that his granddaughter was too precocious. Maybe she will become more cheerful if she gathered more with her peers.

But of course... It seemed like Jun Xi’s wish was not going to come true since there was no sign of Jun Wu Xie in getting more lively after mixing with them for such a long time.

“Ah! So you are going to bring Qing Song, Long Jiu, Situ Heng, Little Black, Drunk Lotus, Poison Ivy and Poppy with you, aren’t you? It has been a long time since I’ve seen Drunk Lotus and the rest of them,” giggled Qiao Chu. It was inexplicably funny every time he watched Drunk Lotus and Poppy fighting with each other.

After swallowing the food in her mouth, Jun Wu Xie put down her chopsticks and raised her head slowly, looking at her friends.

“Nope.”

“Nope? Then who else? Seems like Lord Meh Meh and Sacrificial Blood Rabbit aren’t going too.” Qiao Chu was a little confused.

Elegantly, Jun Wu Xie wiped her mouth with a handkerchief. She then slightly raised her arm and six rays of lights suddenly appeared behind her.

When the lights faded off, six figures with different sizes appeared in front of them.

Clank! The tableware in Qiao Chu’s hands dropped on the table.

“S... Si... Six... ring spirits?! Little Xie, you own six ring spirits!!!”
