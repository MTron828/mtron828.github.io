Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

While being enveloped in the golden light, the spirit envoys noticed that their soul powers were returning, little by little, into their souls. With the frailty and feebleness slowly fading away, their bodies were no longer transparent. It was as if their souls were bathing in a warm spring, it felt as comfortable as the time they felt when they were first born into the world.

Bits by bits, the golden light spread wider and wider, trying its best to get rid off the light of the Soul Sacrificing Event.

In the midst of suffering, Jun Wu Xie suddenly felt a warm energy radiating from her soul. Soundlessly, a ray of gold light permeated out from her soul, wrapping itself around her and Jun Wu Yao, and at the same time, clearing out the discomfort that was brought by the Soul Sacrificing Event.

“This light...” Finally being able to catch a breath, Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and looked at the gold light that was surrounding her.

“It’s the Spirit Tree.” With his brows slightly furrowed, Jun Wu Yao looked up at the green light which was shrouding the Soul Mountain. “The Soul Sacrificing Event is almost done, and by the time when the whole thing comes to an end, even the Spirit Tree has no way to stop it. It’s helping to buy us some time. Little Xie, the seed of the Spirit Tree has fused into your soul, you’re the only one who is able to resist the energy of the Soul Sacrificing Event, go and destroy it.”

Jun Wu Yao looked seriously at Jun Wu Xie. At this moment, they had no other choices. He knew that Jun Wu Xie was worried about Jun Gu but once the Soul Sacrificing Event was successfully carried out, putting aside the problem of whether if Jun Gu will be fine or not, all the people in the Lower Realm and the Middle Realms who Jun Wu Xie cared so much would also be sacrificed!

This was the first time Jun Wu Xie saw such an earnest and cautious gaze in Jun Wu Yao’s eyes. She understood what was the thing that she should be doing now.

“I’ll do it.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head as she stood resolutely up from Jun Wu Yao’s arms.

All the spirit envoys around her had lost all their energy to get up. There were screams and cries coming one after another into Jun Wu Xie’s ears, as if the place she was standing at was a purgatory.

Jun Wu Xie cast a glance over her surroundings. Drunk Lotus, Poppy, Corpse Flower, Crystal Orchid, Poison Ivy and Blood Velvet had become so weak that they had all turned back into their original plant forms, and since the soul of the black beast had blended together with her soul, it had also gotten the protection from the seed of the Spirit Tree, being the only one who was able to temporarily withstand the damage brought by the Soul Sacrificing Event.

“Little Black.” In a low voice, Jun Wu Xie called its name.

The black beast immediately came to Jun Wu Xie.

“Take me there.” With a cold but determined gaze, Jun Wu Xie rode on the back of the black beast.

She would find her father. After settling the Soul Sacrificing Event, she would definitely bring Jun Gu back!

“Roar!” The black beast let out a furious roar as its four powerful claws began to sprint, bringing Jun Wu Xie to the apex of the Soul Mountain!

Along the way, all those people who had collapsed onto the ground were the soldiers from the Upper Realm. Perhaps they couldn’t even have thought it in their dreams, that the mission which they carried on their shoulders was actually the main culprit of them being destroyed at the end.

Amid the wails of pain, the black beast forced itself to withstand the intimidating pressure brought by the Soul Sacrificing Event while running wildly along the way with Jun Wu Xie sitting on its back. In the most possible shortest time, it darted up the Soul Ascending Altar! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

There were green flames raging vigorously in the one hundred and eight beacon towers, with the broiling waves burning the air to the point that the atmosphere began to twist. There was a huge green light sphere on the Soul Ascending Altar, constantly emitting an overwhelming energy. Even though they had the seed of the Spirit Tree protecting them, Jun Wu Xie and the black beast could still feel the strong pressure. Whenever they took one step closer to the Soul Ascending Altar, it was as if there was a thousand weights pressing on their shoulders, and they could hardly move forward!

“Don’t be afraid, you’re the only one now who can destroy it.” The voice of the Spirit Tree came into in Jun Wu Xie’s mind at the moment. As the voice appeared, the golden light on Jun Wu Xie’s body suddenly became brighter, causing the pressure that was pressing onto her to reduce!
