Although Jun Wu Yao was not accustomed to being in such a ‘position’, if his protector was Jun Wu Xie, then he naturally would enjoy such a treatment.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Jun Wu Yao, and hesitated slightly before she said: “With my father’s strength, will he be able to detect your approach?”

Duan Qi’s invitation was only to her. If Jun Wu Yao wanted to follow, he could only hide in the dark.

Jun Wu Yao shook his head confidently.

“Although most of my power has been sealed, as long as I don’t activate my Dark Spirit, there will be no major obstacles. The Dark Spirit is within my body, naturally others will not be able to detect my approach.”

There was a reason for this question.

Jun Wu Xie was focused solely on saving Jun Gu, and the previous conversation with Han Zi Fei caused some changes to Jun Wu Xie’s plan. But the plan could not keep up with the changes, and no one knew what would happen tonight, so if there were sudden changes, then the presence of Jun Wu Yao could help.

“Then you should come.” Jun Wu Xie obviously agreed with Jun Wu Yao’s thoughts.

“Okay.” Jun Wu Yao nodded with a smile as he looked at Jun Wu Xie, however his eyes had a certain strange look.

Duan Qi and the others were already at the banquet hall. However, today’s banquet didn’t bear the presence of the beautiful women from the previous banquet. Instead, there were women with quiet faces and eyes that seemed to speak of having experienced hardships in their early lives.Those women were the elders of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, who had been busy with the wedding preparations of Lord Gu and Han Zi Fei, and thus have not seen Jun Wu Xie before. In order to show the importance of Lord Jun Gu in the tribe, they have all been activated for the banquet.

Jun Wu Xie had arrived early at the banquet venue, and the moment Duan Qi saw Jun Wu Xie, she immediately went up to greet her.

“City Lord Yan, have you gotten used to our tribe these past few days?” Duan Qi asked as she tried hard to maintain a friendly smile, but the effort wasn’t evident as her smile still looked very stiff.

“Everything on the Holy Mountain is good.” Jun Wu Xie said lightly, she had initially thought that her arrival today would not have attracted Duan Qi’s attention.

Clearly, Jun Wu Xie had guessed wrongly.

Due to the status of Jun Gu, the Sacred Maiden Tribe had to tread carefully and treat him with the utmost care. But it was also because of his status that once the Sacred Maiden married him and gave birth to a pureblooded baby girl, it would be absolutely impossible for the child to be returned to the Sacred Maiden Tribe so that she could become the next Sacred Maiden. However, as for Jun Wu Xie, she had just become famous, and she hadn’t even had the opportunity to contact His Lord, but her strength had far surpassed the top ten exponents of the Upper Realm. If they could cement relations before Jun Wu Xie became really famous, that would be the best for the Sacred Maiden Tribe.

Considering all the pros, Duan Qi was naturally more attentive towards Jun Wu Xie.

“The Sacred Maiden and Lord Jun Gu will come later. If there is anything that City Lord Yan needs, please do let us know. Lord Gu had arrived quite suddenly and he was rather travel-worn, that is why I didn’t invite City Lord Yan to meet with him. I am waiting for the banquet tonight as an opportunity to let Lord Jun Gu and City Lord Yan have a good chat so as not to neglect both parties.” Duan Qi did not stay still for a moment and threw an olive branch directly to Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie nodded calmly.

“I thank you for your efforts, Elder Duan.”

“You’re welcome. It is only right, City Lord Yan is a noble guest of our Sacred Maiden Tribe. City Lord Yan can be assured, Lord Jun Gu’s temperament is very gentle. I’m sure he will be very happy to get to know someone like City Lord Yan.” Duan Qi laughed. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
