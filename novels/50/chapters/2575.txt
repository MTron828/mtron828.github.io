Chapter 2576: Soul Ascending Altar (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Based on strength, Long Jiu cannot be compared to Qin Song. In terms of intelligence, he had an inflexible, one-track mind, he only acted rashly and didn’t know how to adapt to circumstances. So upon knowing that Long Jiu was back, Meng Qiu didn’t spend much effort as he thought that he would be able to capture Long Jiu in a couple of days. Who knew...

As he looked at the bunch of snivelling black armoured Spirit Envoys, Meng Qiu could not help but wonder if Long Jiu had been “bought” by someone.

With Long Jiu’s character, if he knew the current situation of Soul World, they wouldn’t have to find him, he would have angrily barged up to them. Even though he knew he could not win, he would have just acted recklessly rather than employing such circuitous tactics.

“Lord Meng Qiu, we really don’t know what to do with that Long Jiu. He would fight then retreat. If we don’t chase after him, he would just stand there and curse at us. If he meets the prison warden team, he would create a disturbance, tormenting people till they fall off their horses.... Please, we request Lord Meng Qiu help us subdue this devil!” A black armoured Spirit Envoy kowtowed to Meng Qiu. The destructive force of Long Jiu might not be big, but that was too nauseating! Now when they saw Long Jiu, they got a tingling sensation, they were slowly developing trauma.

“Where is he now?” Meng Qiu asked coldly.

“Near Yun Ling Mountain.” The black armoured Spirit Envoy replied hurriedly.

Meng Qiu breathed a sigh of relief, and stood from under the Spirit Tree, “That’s fine. I’ll go meet with him myself.”

Upon hearing Meng Qiu’s words, the black armoured Spirit Envoys beamed. Meng Qiu was extremely strong, if he met with Long Jiu, even if Long Jiu tried his best, it would be hard to escape from Meng Qiu.

“Thank you for your trouble, Lord Meng Qiu!” the group of Spirit Envoys kowtowed in gratitude.

Meng Qiu waved his hand, “Go watch over him, I need to visit the Soul Ascending Altar first.”

When it came to the Soul Ascending Altar, the black armoured Spirit Envoys’ smiles froze on their faces in an instant, and their eyes became a little cautious and fearful.

In the Soul World, there were two areas the Spirit Envoys did not dare to visit, one was the Reincarnation Path and the other was the Soul Ascending Altar.

Reincarnation Path was for those spirit lives who wanted to be born human. Any spirit life who wanted to reincarnate to a human would walk into the Reincarnation Path and be reborn as a human in the Upper Realm. However, whoever who entered the Reincarnation Path would have their memories wiped; everything of the Soul World would no longer be a part of their memories. They would be each born into a household, and become the people of the Upper Realm.

It can be said that in a certain sense, the reincarnation would bring new life to the spirit life.

And the Soul Ascending Altar was the scariest place in Soul World.

Different from Reincarnation Path, once the spirit life stepped onto the Soul Ascending Altar, the spirit life would be scattered and disappear from Upper Realm forever.

The Reincarnation Path and the Soul Ascending Altar were respectively guarded by the strongest Spirit Envoys, Meng Qiu was in charge of the Soul Ascending Altar.

All Spirit Envoys, who upon hearing about the Soul Ascending Altar, could not control the fear from within their hearts.

In fact, in the Soul World, the Soul Ascending Altar was rarely used. Few souls will be punished by the rising soul station. Even if they make mistakes, most of them are also locked into the soul wall. From ancient times to the present, in the soul world. In the middle of it, there is no sin that has made it necessary to succumb to the ascendant, but the horror of the sorrowful platform was still lingering in the heart of every soul.

When Meng Qiu left the Spirit Tree, none of the Spirit Envoys followed him to the Soul Ascending Altar. He walked through Soul World alone, headed to the most forbidden place within Soul World.
