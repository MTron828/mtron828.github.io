Chapter 2772: Highness Ying (3）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Gu Xin Yan sat alone at the corner of the banquet hall. Everything that had just happened caused the City Lords of the 72 cities to be at a loss, but all this had nothing to do with her. She was just a spectator, protecting that little bit of calm in her heart in a night of fluctuating emotions.

“Miss.” A voice sounded in Gu Xin Yan’s ears.

Gu Xin Yan slowly raised her head and saw Ye Mei, who was dressed as a housekeeper, standing in front of her.

“My Lord has requested for you to go to the backyard for a short while. Would Miss be willing to?” Ye Mei said.

Gu Xin Yan froze a little, subconsciously she wanted to refuse, but suddenly a pair of slightly familiar eyes appeared in her mind. She swallowed her refusal. She did not immediately reply but looked towards the two guards, who were sent by Highness Ying, standing beside her.

The two guards thought for a moment before nodding slightly.

Gu Xin Yan then said to Ye Mei: “Alright.”

“Then, please follow me.” Ye Mei smiled.

Gu Xin Yan left her table as many people at the banquet watched. It wasn’t that they didn’t think to suck up to Highness Ying, but they were so overwhelmed by Jun Wu Xie that they didn’t have time to think about other things.

Ye Mei took Gu Xin Yan to the backyard of the city’s official residence, and the two accompanying guards went everywhere Gu Xin Yan went.

Under the moonlight, with less noise and bright lights of the banquet hall, the courtyard seemed slightly deserted and very quiet. The courtyard was filled with the faint fragrance of grass, unlike the sweet smell of flowers, but it suited the cool, moonlit night.

Involuntarily, Gu Xin Yan’s eyes fell on the figure sitting alone in the courtyard, slender and frail, the man was facing the moon and the shadow obscured his face, so she could not see his appearance as he just sat there quietly. However, it made Gu Xin Yan’s heart skip a beat, as the silhouette was superimposed onto the image hidden deep within her memories. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Walking under the moonlight, Gu Xin Yan moved towards Jun Wu Xie step by step, and sat down on the stone bench opposite to her. With the moonlight, she saw Jun Wu Xie’s sophisticated yet unfamiliar face.

“Lord Yan.” Gu Xin Yan nodded slightly, perhaps there was a hint of similarity, the other party had become the one person she did not hate since coming to the Upper Realm.

“Miss Gu has travelled far. Thank you for your trouble.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Gu Xin Yan as her mouth suddenly raised a gentle smile.

The smile was very shallow but very warm, and obviously beautiful, but it made Gu Xin Yan’s last glimmer of hope disappear.

Not her.

That person would never smile so gently, that person’s expression was always cold.

If the imposing manner displayed by Jun Wu Xie during the banquet had made Gu Xin Yan hopeful, then with this smile, it completely sobered her up.

Gu Xin Yan restrained the sense of disappointment in her eyes and forced her spirits to rise. “It is also to come see the scenery here, there wasn’t much trouble.”

“His Highness’ congratulatory gifts shocked me. His Highness and I do not know each other, and thus, I’m so flattered by His Highness’ consideration and courtesy.” Jun Wu Xie’s face deliberately revealed a state of surprise.

Gu Xin Yan could no longer superimpose this person in front of her with that person in her memory. She just said lightly: “His Highness heard about the Banquet of Heroes and so he sent me here.”
