“I have this. Can I go in with it?” Jun Wu Xie noticed the men’s hesitation and immediately took out the bronze badge she had gotten when she had laboured at the worksite of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower

The two men took a look at the bronze badge and immediately smiled.

“You can, you can.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The bronze badge was proof of having toiled for the Serene Spirit Towers. Spirits with the bronze badge would be able to gain priority entry into the Serene Spirit Towers to cultivate. But the bronze badges only had a seven day validity and although it allowed one to do away with waiting, it came with a time limit. The two men were still a little hesitant but seeing the bronze badge gave them a valid reason to allow Jun Wu Xie in. In this way, they were not only able to gain the little beauty’s favour, they did not have to break any rules for it, hence, they were naturally happy to do it.

With the bronze badge as a pass of passage, the two men were then more than happy to open the door of convenience for Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie went straight into the Serene Spirit Tower. The bronze badges had specific uses and the priority access the bronze badge provided was meant to be used only at the Serene Spirit Tower where they had contributed their efforts into its construction. Jun Wu Xie’s bronze badge had clearly had the character “four” inscribed into it but as the two men had been so besotted with Jun Wu Xie’s beauty, they had not even looked at the badge closely, which allowed Jun Wu Xie to win the advantage.

This was the first time that Jun Wu Xie had gained an advantage through her beauty, which she did not know whether to laugh or cry about. Towards her looks, she had never cared much about it, but it had come in useful today.

The inside of the Serene Spirit Tower was exactly the same as when Jun Wu Xie had come before, still fully packed with human spirits. The human spirits numbered the most in the first to fifth levels of the Serene Spirit Tower and the higher she went, the further the numbers thinned.

Those able to reach the twelfth level, were only two disciples of Wu Jiu’s, and due to the previous Spirit Master’s captivity, Jiang Yun Long and the other disciple were currently not cultivating there, but were busying themselves out there. Hence, when Jun Wu Xie came up to the twelfth level, it was completely empty, with only the enormous ball of Spirit Fire suspended in the air, taking up almost two thirds of the entire twelfth level.

Jun Wu Xie went around to inspect the place. There was only one human spirit on the eleventh level as the higher one went, the number of human spirits who were able to withstand it lessened. And when they were immersed in their cultivation, it was impossible for them to notice whether anyone had passed through the level they were in, so nobody had noticed that Jun Wu Xie had gone straight up to the twelfth level.

After ascertaining that no one would suddenly appear, Jun Wu Xie then took out the little awl hidden in her sleeve. She calmly stared at the ring of Spirit Reinforcement runes below the Spirit Fire as she recalled from memory once more the sequence she had checked through countless of times in her mind. At that moment, Jun Wu Xie then went walking up and crouched herself down by the Spirit Fire as she used the little awl in her hand to change the ring of Spirit Reinforcement runes.

The tiny sounds of carving sounded out in the twelfth level of the Serene Spirit Tower. The sound was very soft and if they were not on the same level, no one would ever detect it. After three whole hours of toil, Jun Wu Xie finally finished modifying the ring of Spirit Reinforcement runes under the Spirit Fire to the way she intended them to be. She had only modified a small part and under the shroud of the enormous Spirit Fire, no one would notice that the runes had undergone subtle changes. Unless Wu Jiu came in personally to inspect them, otherwise, Jun Wu Xie was confident that no one would notice.

Giving it a final inspection whether she had missed anything out, Jun Wu Xie was finally certain that she had modified them perfectly. That was when she then kept the little awl safely away and went walking down from the twelfth level.

Having just stepped onto the ninth level, the human spirit that walked towards her made Jun Wu Xie’s gaze change slightly. Her eyes lowered unnoticeably and acting like she had not noticed anything, she passed the human spirit by his shoulder, and went walking slowly down in descent.
