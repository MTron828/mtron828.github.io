Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Banquet of Heroes brought the City Lords of the 72 Cities who had not gathered in the past millennium together. Outside Sea Spirit City, streams of horse carriages rushed in. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Since the rise of Sea Spirit City, although many people have heard the news but only very few have seen the changes of Sea Spirit City.

When they came to Sea Spirit City, only then had they then realized that...

Sea Spirit City had really changed.

Yu Mou City’s Xu Yuanshan and East Peak City’s Dongfang Ku Bi were good friends. The cities they were in charge of weren’t very large. They were not ambitious and they thought alike. City Lord Xu Yuanshan was originally going to inquire about the situation about Sea Spirit City’s City Lord from Dongfang Ku Bi. However, along the way, Yu Yuanshan just heard Dongfang Ku Bi sing praises about Jun Wu Xie’s contributions on and on.

The act that Dongfang Ku Bi did to try to please Yu Yuanshan made him suspect that Dongfang Ku Bi was not intimidated by surrendering to Jun Wu Xie but it was all voluntary.

Originally, Yu Yuanshan also felt that the Dongfang Ku Bi was very pathetic. He was guarding East Peak City and did not provoke anybody to deserve this. But just because he was not far from Sea Spirit City, he was therefore beaten by Jun Wu Xie. Fortunately, Dongfang Ku Bi knows the current situation and did not struggle further. However, after seeing Dongfang Ku Bi’s fanatical worship of Jun Wu Xie, Yu Yuanshan felt that ... he was such an unreliable City Lord of East Peak City and the city was far better to be under Jun Wu Xie’s care.

Never had he seen such cowardice before!

However, when Yu Yuanshan and Dongfang Ku Bi came to the Sea Spirit City, they sat in a carriage and looked out the window and saw the fortitude of the city. Now he understood that Dongfang Ku Bi was not a coward, he just knew the way to survive!!!

“These ... these are the soldiers of Sea Spirit City?” Yu Yuanshan opened the window and watched the group of soldiers wearing black light armor pass by. He could not help swallowing his saliva.

This team of soldiers imposed were all strong and filled with vigor. At a glance, they felt frightened. Even if they did nothing, Yu Yuanshan felt the murderous intent from them.

Even if they knew that the murderous intent was not directed against him, Yu Yuanshan felt that his legs were wobbly.

Is this the type of soldier that a weak city should have? Even the soldiers in the number one White Night City from the 72 cities weren’t that terrifying!

He felt like he saw a group of Hade Lords passing by.

“How’s it? I didn’t lie to you, right? The fighting force of the City Lord is absolutely tough. Fortunately, I knew the current situation and did not lose anything. You can see how badly devastated Puppet City was under their assault. “Dongfang Ku Bi hummed.

Puppet City was the city that Jun Wu Xie attacked after conquering East Peak City. The City Lord did not believe in the combat power of Sea Spirit City, so he directly led his troops out of the city to fight. On that day, Puppet City was washed with blood and blood flowed out like a river as bodies piled up like mountains. The bloody stench was so suffocating that it frightened all the commoners who were too scared to even stand.

Yu Yuanshan swallowed his saliva again and remained obedient.

Puppet City, which was attacked by Jun Wu Xie, had become a ghost town.

“I’m pretty convinced. Fortunately, I have a brother to remind me, otherwise I don’t know how many jokes I will make out of myself. I must really thank you for this.” Yu Yuanshan cupped his fists before his chest and saluted to Dongfang Ku Bi.
