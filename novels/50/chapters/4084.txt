Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In less than five minutes, Xu Zu has already completed the sedimentation that originally took fifty years. This amazing effect really made the two men on the side look stunned. At this moment, the feeling they had towards Xu Zu was no longer as simple as envy and jealousy.

After seeing the effect of this elixir with their own eyes, they really wished they could take the medicine one step earlier!

However, Xu Zu didn’t have time to feel the joy after the increase in strength. He was drenched with sweat. After the growth of spiritual strength was calm, he seemed to be recovering from a serious illness, with a red face, sitting on the ground and gasping with his mouth wide open.

The scorching heat that pervaded him almost made him burnt out of his mind and the veins in his whole body were sore as if they had been pulled vigorously.

Of course ...

Under intense discomfort, he had no time to feel how powerful he had become ...

However, the changes in Xu Zu’s body fell into Ruan Zhongshan’s eyes as much as possible, gradually breaking Ruan Zhongshan’s calm expression.

Ruan Chongshan immediately gave the steward a look, and he immediately left the hall and called back the healers who had just left.

The healers returned to the city’s mansion in a haze, full of doubts, but afraid to say anything.

Xu Zu was so weak that he was lifted to the side of the chair by the lieutenant of the city’s main government. His sweat wet his clothes and made him look a little embarrassed. When those healers were re-stretched in front of Ruan Chongshan, his heart They are all playing drums, afraid that Ruan Zhongshan suddenly changed his mind.

“Show him.” Who knew that Ruan Zhongshan just threw them this sentence.

Those healers looked at Xu Xu who was slumped on the chair with some doubts. They remember that Xu Xu was fine when they left. How could it take a while ... to become this picture?

However, they did not dare to neglect at all, and hurriedly started to check the pulse and other conditions around Xu Zu.

During the whole process, Ruan Chongshan’s eyes did not leave Xu Zu and the reactions of those doctors. It seemed that a tiger was eager to try.

The rapid growth of Xu Zu’s spiritual power made him stunned, which made him startled a little by the effect of the elixir, but before he was shocked, Ruan Zhongshan still needed to do one thing, which was to determine the safety of the elixir !!

After a group of medical doctors repeatedly checked Xu Zu several times, he knelt in front of Ruan Zhongshan and said, “Master Qilu, Lord Xu, there is nothing to hinder, but there is a bit of exhaustion in the spiritual boiling. Just two days off. ”

The healer said that he was serious, but his heart was sweating profusely. Although Xu Zu’s strength was good, he was still not at the peak of the Gold Spirit. Yet ... he had suddenly advanced so much?

Ruan Zhongshan took a deep breath, and their answers made Ruan Zhongshan’s breathing light. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Are you sure he’s fine?” Ruan Zhongshan confirmed again.

“Yes.” Those healers answered honestly.

“Then you all may leave first.” Ruan Zhongshan waved his hand, he snaped back to his senses at this moment!

The news Xu Zu brought back was true!

Under the heavens, there really was such an amazing elixir!

No wonder ... no wonder the courage of Sea Spirit City had suddenly grown so big, they had actually gotten hold of such a tremendous treasure!
