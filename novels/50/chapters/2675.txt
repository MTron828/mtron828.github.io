As soon as Ye Jie said this, everyone in the backyard froze.

“Well ... another ignorant young girl who has been fooled by Xiao Ruo’s appearance.” Qiao Chu couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Rong Ruo’s appearance was not of a gentle beauty, she had that extra heroic spirit. If she dressed as a girl, she was very beautiful, but if she dressed as a man, it made it impossible to discern her gender.

In the Lower Realm, when Rong Ruo presented herself to others in men’s clothing, she had also owed a lot of “romance debts”. It caused her so much trouble that she had to switch back to women’s clothing for a while.

Fan Zhuo and others also laughed. Ye Jie was pure-hearted as until now, she was unaware of the fact that Rong Ruo was a woman.

Looking at the smiles on everyone’s face, huge confusion shone on Ye Jie’s face. She didn’t know what she had said wrong. Why did they all laugh?

Ye Jie looked at Jun Wu Xie anxiously, “Miss, did I ... say something wrong?”

Jun Wu Xie shook her head lightly, “Xiao Ruo is a woman, but she likes to wear men’s clothing in front of others.”

Fortunately, Rong Ruo was a woman, otherwise if Ye Gu heard what Ye Jie said, that was it.

However, instead of dissipating the bewilderment on Ye Jie’s face, her confusion became even deeper. She looked uneasily at the crowd, and lowered her head a little. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Obviously ...

She was not wrong.

Rong Ruo returned to her residence after leaving the city’s official residence. Jun Wu Xie had originally arranged for them to stay in the official residence, but her companions had the foresight and a clear view on things, and they were afraid of disturbing Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie from spending time together. Thus, they consciously declined Jun Wu Xie’s kindness and each of them picked a residence within Sea Spirit City.

The residence which Rong Ruo picked was not large, but she chose it because of the quietness.

In the small courtyard, there was only Rong Ruo, no other servants were around.

Rong Ruo walked to her room, and sat down in front of the dressing table. The dressing table was empty. There was no rouge gouache, lotions or powder, neither was there any gold and silver jewelry which women loved. The dressing table looked like a brand new one.

Sitting in front of the dresser, Rong Ruo looked at her reflection in the bronze mirror.

Cheeks that were fair and clear, exquisite facial features, although it was not as perfect as Jun Wu Xie’s, but there was also have a charming appeal, her forehead lacked a woman’s softness, but there was a sense of brilliance and carefree. When dressed up as a man, at first glance of the person in the mirror, no one could guess that it was a woman in said guise.

She had long been used to this kind of dressing; satin and silk, long sleeved gowns. For her, it was so strange and rarely useful.

Rong Ruo sat quietly in front of the dressing table, staring at herself in the mirror for a long time, her eyes were filled with deep troubles, her brows and forehead frowning with sorrow.

“Ah ...” After a long time, Rong Ruo couldn’t help but sighed. She raised her hand and touched the coldness of the copper mirror with her fingertips. She looked at herself in the mirror, but it felt like she was looking at something on the side.

“What should I do?” Rong Ruo’s brow frowned slightly, helplessness and perplexity filled her tone.

Fei Yan’s feelings, how could she not know?

However, the more serious he was, the more afraid she was.

She didn’t know how to respond, and did not dare to respond ...

She could only pretend to not understand, to not comprehend.

She just hoped that one day, Fei Yan would tire, would detest, or meet other women he admired and then everything would be over.

“Little sis ... if it were you, everything would easy right ...” Rong Ruo stared at herself in the mirror with a bitter smile ...
