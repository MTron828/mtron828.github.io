Chapter 2751: Banquet of Heroes (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The envoy of White Night City thought that Jun Wu Xie had agreed to speak with them. Who knew that upon seeing Jun Wu Xie, the group was ordered to leave before they could even finish speaking. The group was ‘sent out’ of Sea Spirit City directly but their gifts were retained.

Compared with the annihilation of the Five City Coalition, the expulsion of White Night City was not as bad.

Unable to entice Jun Wu Xie to join White Night City’s camp, the envoy team of White Night City could only return to their city.

But this operation seemed to take on a different taste as others have observed...

Initially, although Sea Spirit City was stronger than before, but in the eyes of many cities, it was still viewed as a barren and weak city. Furthermore, the cities which were taken over by Jun Wu xie weren’t very powerful cities, thus Sea Spirit City was not taken too seriously.

But after Jun Wu Xie destroyed the Five City Coalition, no one in the 72 cities dared to underestimate Sea Spirit City any longer. Everyone became uneasy; Sea Spirit City which dared to attack the top five cities; wasn’t it similar to a rabid dog, without scruples or hesitation?

The envoy from White Night City who came immediately after was also rebuffed. Although White Night City did not meet with a miserable end, they also weren’t afforded much regard by Sea Spirit City.

White Night City had not only represented itself, but was also represented one of the top ten cities. Jun Wu Xie had not only destroyed the army of the Five City Coalition, she even rebuffed the efforts of the other five cities. It could be said that the all-powerful top ten cities had all been ‘eaten’ by Jun Wu Xie, none of them received any sort of benefit from her.

Within that time, discussions of Sea Spirit City in the 72 cities reached unprecedented popularity, and those precarious surrounding cities were completely frightened of Jun Wu Xie’s vicious measures. By now, Jun Wu Xie need not lead her army out of the city, those cities have prepared big tributes and sent their envoys to Sea Spirit City to pay their respects to Jun Wu Xie in hopes that their cities would not be destroyed.

In the past, not many people would voluntarily visit Sea Spirit City, however, with the recent events, the city had become extremely lively. The envoys from various cities incessantly entered the city, and a large number of these treasures have been stuffed into Hell Rodent. Although these treasures could not be compared to Jun Wu Yao’s properties, but... they were nonetheless valuable.

Taking advantage of various parties who had gathered within the city, Jun Wu Xie publicly announced that the Banquet of Heroes will be held and she had sent out the invitations to all 72 cities.

Everyone didn’t understand the motives of Jun Wu Xie, but Sea Spirit was currently on a roll. Even if a city was not willing to attend, they still had to attend no matter how unpleasant it was. Otherwise, it might give Jun Wu Xie an opportunity to use that as a pretext to invade and destroy their cities. Did they not want to live?

In most of the seventy-two cities, preparations for the Banquet of Heroes were in full swing, however in Blazing Flame City, there were still dark clouds lurking around.

Nangong Yan had asked the other four lords to convene in order to discuss the Banquet of Heroes.

“Banquet of Heroes? Is Sea Spirit City worthy to organise it?!” The City Lord of Heaven Fiend City looked on disdainfully. There were also Banquets of Heroes held previously in the 72 cities. The so-called Banquet of Heroes was to invite all the top exponents within the 72 cities to gather, and it also included the lords of the 72 cities.

A thousand years ago, when Bai Zhu’s father was the the lord of White Night City, he once hosted a Banquet of Heroes. White Night City of yesteryear was even stronger than it was today!
