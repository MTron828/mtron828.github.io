Chapter 2222: Warmth before the storm（1）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

After establishing the new goal of relocating to the Lower Realm, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord informed his disciples of his decision. After learning the news, many of the girls were looking forward to it. They had been isolated from the world for too long and could not wait to go and look at the places they had never been to before. They had no home, no relatives and the fellow sister disciples in the Spirit Jade Palace were their only relatives they had, where the Spirit Jade Palace was, that was where their home was.

Yan Bu Gui had been guarding by Su Ya’s side all this while, be it day or night, he had cared for her without stop. The beard that had been shaved off grew back again into a stubbly mess. Although everything beneath his eyes was just a patch of black, however his eyes shone with happiness.

Under Jun Wu Xie’s care, Su Ya’s injury had improved tremendously. It was just that she had been too severely wounded, it would be difficult to revert back to her original appearance in such a short time. The wounds on her face had already turned to scabs, but they had been cruelly drawn all over her face and it was a scary sight that even she herself did not dare look. However, Yan Bu Gui did not care one bit. When she woke up every morning, he would gently kiss each and every part of her face, it was as if those scars did not even exist. No matter what, she was the most beautiful woman in his heart.

Jun Wu Xie had just brought the medicine into Su Ya tent and saw Yan Bu Gui and Su Ya in the midst of an intimate kiss.

Even Jun Wu Xie was stunned momentarily.

When Yan Bu Gui discovered the presence of Jun Wu Xie, he immediately straightened his body, but a suspicious blush coloured his face as he had on a flustered expression. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Su Ya only laughed out.

“You are already someone’s Master, yet your skin is still so thin.”

Yan Bu Gui’s face reddened even more after her teasing.

Jun Wu Xie had already returned to her usual expression she walked in with the medicine.

“Three days later, we will need to depart. Would Master Su Ya be able to take it?” In terms of injuries, other than Lord Meh Meh, Su Ya’s ones were the heaviest.

“What is this addressing of Master Su Ya? Just call me Master directly and call him Martial Master, listening to all this is so awkward.” Su Ya’s spirit was much better and her uninhibited speaking manner had also recovered.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Yan Bu Gui and only after she saw that he nodded his head with his reddened face did she say, “Yes, Master.”

Her relationship between Su Ya and Yan Bu Gui were a little complicated. Su Ya was her Master as well as Yan Bu Gui’s Master. However, she herself had recognised both of them as her Master, fortunately there was Su Ya and Yan Bu Gui’s feelings of affection, or else Jun Wu Xie would really not know whether to call Yan Bu Gui her Master or her Senior Brother...

“I will be fine, it’s just that I don’t know Tian Ze that brat....” Su Ya thought back of her own Junior Brother, they had both been caught together. She was left in the prison as bait while Tian Ze was thrown out. The injuries that he had suffered was no less than hers, and she had no idea how he was doing.

“Master, please rest assured. The reason why I was able to rush to Mount Fu Yao was because I met with Master Uncle. He has already recovered quite a bit by now and I have already instructed people to bring him over the moment we’ve departed from Mount Fu Yao.” Jun Wu Xie replied, other than Tian Ze, she had also naturally called Xue’er who had been taking care of Tian Ze to come together. Since the Spirit Jade Palace wanted to go to the Lower Realm, they could not leave Xue’er alone in the Middle Realm .

“That brat is one hell of a lucky ***.” Su Ya harrumphed, although she harrumphed, but it was not hard to hear the concern she had for her Junior Brother.

“But... kid, this woman has yet to settle our account!” Su Ya suddenly said.

“Tell me, you are a girl, yet you have to dress up as a boy in front of this woman to cover up this countenance that is fair like a flower. So how should we settle this account?”
