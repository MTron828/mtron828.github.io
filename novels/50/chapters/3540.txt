Xue Er looked at the lonely figure and her eyes flashed with a sliver of sadness and helplessness. But very quickly, she pushed back the look in her eyes and put on a brilliant smile on her face as she walked herself towards the figure.

The figure remained standing in its spot, not moving an inch. Xue Er walked over to the figure’s side and she still did not show any reaction. On her face, she wore a dark bronze mask. The mask covered her entire face, revealing only a pair of calm but slightly expectant eyes.

“Senior, life is really great now. I had never thought that we will ever be able live like this. The past one year has been the happiest time of my life.” Xue Er said as she followed the other girl’s gaze that was looking a far way off, her little round face rosy, looking very much like an apple.

The girl with the mask turned her head slightly, to look at Xue Er who was smiling prettily like a flower and she nodded her head slightly.

Xue Er went on to say smilingly on her own: “Senior, would you say that the Palace Lord’s words are true? Our benefactor is really coming back?”

The eyes of the masked girl flashed briefly as the bright sparkling eyes lowered in remorse.

“Since that was what Lord Ye Mei said to the Palace Lord, then it should be true.” The masked girl replied.

“No wonder the Palace Lord has been urging us to tidy up the various branches properly. It seems that our Lord wants to let our benefactor see how the lands have been reborn?” Xue Er said with a laugh.

Throughout the Spirit Jade Palace, the fact that not a single one among them would covet anything from the citizens was not just because the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had issued strict orders against it, but it was more due to the fact that all of them were well aware of where everything they had gained today really came from.

They were not the ones who obliterated the Twelve Palaces, and these rewards were not supposed to be theirs to enjoy. They were merely managing things on someone’s behalf and though the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had never said anything about it, they knew very clearly that everything the Spirit Jade Palace Lord was doing was merely trying to cleanse these filthy forsaken lands and return them to that person.

This was not what they should be getting afterall.

The Spirit Jade Palace had never seen themselves as the successor of the Twelve Palaces. What they had always sought and pursued had never been supreme authority, but just a breath of freedom.

“Mm” The masked girl answered softly, her eyes still peering far off into the distance. This time, her eyes were tinged with sadness and a little conflicted.

They seemed a little expectant, but fearful of something at the same time.

Suddenly, over the line where the Heavens and Earth joined, two black specks appeared over the horizon. Under the sunlight, they gradually became bigger.

The masked girl’s eyes widened slightly, her breathing becoming a little hurried.

In an instant, three figures suddenly appeared beside her and Xue Er. The three people were all dressed in black, and it was Ye Sha, Ye Gu, and Ye Mei. The three men’s eyes were bright as torches as they watched the two black specks slowly magnify, excitement and anxiety rising in their eyes.

They stood there barely for just a blink when they suddenly shot themselves forward straight towards the two dark figures!

Xue Er held the masked girl’s hand nervously while feeling excited at the same time, before she said anxiously: “Senior! ! Senior! ! That..... That.....”

“She’s back.” The masked girl’s eyes narrowed slightly, filling up with a smile.

Xue Er was staring with her eyes wide, as she watched the two figures gradually coming clearer into view.

Upon the magnificent white horses, a flawlessly beautiful young lady and a man with peerlessly handsome countenance rode shoulder to shoulder. The wild wind blew their hair up behind them, the two figures seemingly leaving a trail of themselves behind the places they passed.

Ye Sha and the two others sped forward at great speed to welcome them, and in the instant just before they were to meet the two figures, the three of them fell in uniform onto one knee!

“Your subordinate Ye Sha, Ye Mei, and Ye Gu, welcomes Lord Jue and the Eldest Miss on your return!”
