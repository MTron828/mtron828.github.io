“That ... Little Xie, now that you’ve made such a big move and that guy Gu Ying does not play by the rules... What if he suddenly came to Sea Spirit City?” Qiao Chu felt his scalp go numb when he thought about this.

Jun Wu Xie said: “Just kill him when he’s here.”

“...” You just mention killing him so easily, as if it’s such an easy feat!

“But fortunately, the situation in the 72 cities has been settled. We can also plan for the next step if we want to.” Qiao Chu cleared his throat.

“Not yet.” Jun Wu Xie suddenly said.

“Ah? What do you mean?” Qiao Chu was confused.But Jun Wu Xie had no intention to continue. Jun Wu Yao leisurely hugged his pretty wife and left, leaving Qiao Chu and their party wondering what Jun Wu Xie meant before she left.

The Banquet of Heroes ended fast. But the City Lords had a tacit understanding to leave their army early in the morning the next day. One ran faster than the other, but Dongfang Ku Bi kept Yu Yuanshan in Sea Spirit City for a long time.

Yu Yuanshan departed several times and stopped expressing his interests. But he was delayed further by Dongfang Ku Bi until two days later before both left.

Strange to say, something so important happened at the Banquet of Heroes. But the outside world seemed completely unaware and did not stir up the slightest storm.

“I said, Little Xie, why do I feel that something’s a bit wrong?” Qiao Chu asked nervously. He also noticed something was wrong on the third day after the Banquet of Heroes.

Jun Wu Xie raised her eyes and glanced at him.

“The City Lords all left one by one as if they were fleeing. I thought that soon, the news of your unification would come from the 72 cities. However... why hasn’t the people sent out by the Night Regime caught the slightest wind?” Qiao Chu’s face was filled with curiosity. It was reasonable to say that after the Banquet of Heroes, shouldn’t it be a happy moment for everyone to praise Jun Wu Xie?

How could the reaction of the 72 cities be so quiet?

Jun Wu Xie said lightly: “They won’t recognize it.”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Chu froze slightly.

“At the Banquet of Heroes, they were not my opponents. Naturally, they have to bow their heads. But since they have left the Sea Spirit City, they will never admit it. They have been the City Lords for so many years, how can they be willing and happily let me rule over them? I think the first thing they should do after they return to the city is to plan a crusade against me. “Jun Wu Xie said calmly and all her companions were stunned.

They thought that the incident in the 72 cities had ended. But what Jun Wu Xie had just said seemed to imply that a great war was coming.

“The Night Regime and the Ghost Army are ready, let them come.” Jun Wu Yao chuckled aside. He was not surprised that Jun Wu Xie was so good. If the 72 cities can be so easily defeated, then this place will not be the Upper Realm.

Sure enough, shortly after White Night City armies left the sphere of defence of Sea Spirit City, Bai Zhu, Nangong Yan, and others suddenly stopped. In a nearby city, the City Lords who had participated in the Banquet of Heroes, gathered again. Together, however, this time, they were not chanting and honoring Jun Wu Xie. But they gathered together to discuss how to destroy Sea Spirit City and Jun Wu Xie!
