Jun Wu Xie looked at the man in front of her with a frown. It had to be said that the man was indeed very good looking but what got her attention was that he looked exactly like His Lord!

He and His Lord of the Sacred City looked identical except for the colour of his eyes!

“Who are you?” Jun Wu Xie asked coldly, staring at the man.

The man snapped back to attention, looked at Jun Wu Xie’s cold expression and said somewhat apologetically, “Sorry, it seems my appearance has scared you. However I am not the same person as the one you have encountered before, it could be said that he and I are twins.”

The man spoke lightly, but his tone carried some haplessness, some bitterness. For those golden eyes, Jun Wu Xie could not detect any trace of lie. The man before her looked very similar to His Lord, but the feeling he gave her was the exact opposite.

No matter how much he tried, His Lord could never fully disguise his cruel and vicious nature under the facade of gentleness and kindness. But the man in front of Jun Wu Xie was radiating a kindness that could not be faked, it was a kindness that came from one’s soul.

Jun Wu Xie did not know why but she had a feeling that His Lord had always tried to disguise himself as the person in front of her.

“Since you are already here, I believe you would have learnt much from my friends. The one you encountered before used to be a god of this place. He mastered destruction and was called the God of Destruction. And the opposite of destruction is creation and life.” The man smiled once more and looked at Jun Wu Xie. “He and I were born at the same time and I am known as the God of Light. However, in this world, any place where there is light, also cannot escape the shadows.”

The Gods of Light and Destruction were the two most powerful gods in the Three Realms. Both looked the same and had identical levels of power but their characters could not be more different.

The God of Light believed in benevolence and gentleness, and the God of Destruction believed in killing and destruction. It was only because their levels of strength were indistinguishable and were twins, a tension formed. This tension was completely destroyed one day.

The God of Light fell in love with a woman that he had created himself. She was not a beautiful woman and he had initially created her just to see how she would live in the Three Realms as a human.

However as he watched her through the God’s mirror, he saw her grow up day by day, her radiant smile and joyous laughter stirred within him a feeling he had never felt before.

He started to pine for her and even wanted to leave the god’s paradise to see her. Alas, although the gods had created the world, they had strict rules as well. They could not appear in front of humans and could only use their powers to create miracles in front of them.

The God of Light became unhappy and the God of Destruction found out about it. The God of Destruction then used the prospect of meeting the woman to lure the God of Light out of paradise....
