Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“It is thanks to the kindness of Master Nangong, otherwise this Sea Spirit City is already in ruins.” Epic Vesper City’s Guan Hu hummed.

The members of the Night Regime who were ordered to send the message, had listened to these people bragging, as they restrained the growing disdain within themselves for these people.

If it weren’t for these idiots and their usefulness, they would have died many times over.

“We need to trouble our guests to move into the city, as we have made preparations to house you within the city.” The members of Night Regime lowered their heads, even though they were full of contempt and disdain for these people, their voices were sincere as evidence as of their acting skills.

“Mm.” Guan Hu responded proudly, turned his head and put on a charming smile to look at Nangong Lie at his side.

“Master Nangong, would you please?”

Nangong Lie nodded sternly and took the lead to follow the Night Regime into Sea Spirit City.

He didn’t understand why, but Nangong Lie had been so restless these past few days, and his sense of unease had only gotten stronger the closer they got to Sea Spirit City. Since his return from the Middle Realm, Nangong Lie ‘s nerves had been in a tense state. Everything that was destroyed by Jun Wu Xie made it hard to forget.

Walking into the Sea Spirit City, the city was silent and solemn. Occasionally, there would be one or two people passing by on the street, but other than that, the entire city seemed surprisingly quiet. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Compared with the luxurious Blazing Flame City, the Sea Spirit City looked shabby both in terms of architecture and surface appearances. The clothes of its citizens were also extremely simple.

“This is Sea Spirit City? It’s merely so.” Mu En of Heaven Fiend City glanced at the buildings in Sea Spirit City, and his face was full of disregard.

The members of the Night Regime brought the people from the five cities to their respective residences which had been arranged for the duration of their stay in Sea Spirit City. As soon as they entered the rooms, Guan Hu and others were disgusted, complaining that the place was too dilapidated and dirty, like a pigsty, and unable to live in at all. Their responses were beyond arrogant, which caused even the cold-hearted members of the Night Regime to be lit on fire.

“Is there no place to live in Sea Spirit City? How can we stay in such a worn down place? Even my dog ​​kennel is more comfortable than your yard. Go back and tell your City Lord that we cannot stay in such a lousy place.” Guan Hu frowned and shouted at the members of the Night Regime, apparently very dissatisfied with the residence.

Mu En and Liang Cheng’s situations were almost the same, they basically listed out their dislikes, and were unwilling to stay in such places.

Only Liu Yi and Nangong Lie stayed silent after being led to their respective residences.

In the end, even after changing the residences for Guan Hu and the others, they were only barely satisfied. After the people were resettled, members of the Night Regime returned to the City Lord Manor to recover from their experience with the people from the five cities. Although they were trying very hard to control, at the time of reporting back to Jun Wu Xie, their unhappiness and disdain were very obvious.

“People from the top ten cities are really arrogant.” Fan Zhuo could not help but sneer.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes slightly. She had never seen Guan Hu and others before, but she was already very disgusted by their behaviour.

“This is the true countenance of the Upper Realm.” Jun Wu Yao smiled as he spoke, he is no longer surprised at such a situation.

Jun Wu Xie waved her hand to let those members of Night Regime retire.

“When will the City Lord meet them?” Zheng Weilong asked.

“Not for the time being,” Jun Wu Xie said coldly.

Zheng Weilong was dazed for a moment. She thought that Jun Wu Xie had it all planned out clearly, but...

“Others are fine, but if you don’t see Nangong Lie...”
