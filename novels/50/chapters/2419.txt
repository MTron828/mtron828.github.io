They were fully aware of just how strong Luo Qingcheng is, because even the two of them were not confident that they can defeat her in a one-on-one match. But could Jun Wu Xie do it?

A Spirit Ring that only took five years to condense was actually strong enough to go up against Luo Qingcheng’s Spirit Ring and withstand a hundred strokes?

In fact, it instantly destroyed the contempt Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya had for Jun Wu Xie.

In that moment, a consensus was formed between the both of them. They were sure that if either one of them was fighting Jun Wu Xie, not only would they have not been able to kill her, to not be defeated by her would be the best outcome for everyone.

Had they not seen her every move with such clarity with their own eyes, they would not have believed that such a marvellous and imposing woman actually existed in the Lower Realm.

If she was from the Upper Realm, based on her capabilities, Jun Wu Xie would be amongst the Top Ten Expert exponents – most certainly within the top three.

“Is this a joke? Where the hell did she pop up from? It’s hard to believe that she’s that strong!!!” Xie Chang Ming’s tone of voice has also changed. At this moment, he no longer dared to despise the gloom of Nangong Lie. If it were him, he would not be better off than Nangong Lie.

This woman was simply not human, she was a demon.

The look on Wei Ya’s face was extremely godawful as Jun Wu Xie’s capabilities far surpassed their expectations. As the battle between Luo Qingcheng and Jun Wu Xie raged on with increasing intensity, she could not help but glance towards the group of soldiers from the Night Regime.

It was not false bravado on Jun Wu Xie’s part. She dared to provoke the Upper Realm because she truly possessed strong capabilities. It was in that moment that Wei Ya realised that they have truly underestimated Jun Wu Xie and the Lower Realm. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This place that was long considered a barbaric rubbish dump had left them dumbstruck as a battlefield of Asura.

“What’s the matter, Wei Ya? Are we just going to allow that demonic spawn to run amok?” Xie Chang Ming asked in a panic. Before this, he did not entirely took Jun Wu Xie very seriously, but right now, after seeing what Jun Wu Xie was capable of, he could not help but felt distraught with fear and anxiety.

“Let’s wait and see.” Wei Ya said as she furrowed her brows.

Feelings of shock started to appear in Luo Qingcheng’s heart. She had initially thought that she could win the fight against Jun Wu Xie within three strokes, but she hadn’t expected that even after more than a hundred strokes, Jun Wu Xie was still able to steadily deflect her attacks at full strength. The current situation caused Lu Qingcheng to turn a little pale with fright.

“What did you do within this five years? It’s impossible that you’ve become so strong!” Luo Qingcheng used an interval during the fight to distance herself from Jun Wu Xie. For the longest time, she had not met with an opponent who was so tough to deal with! To the point that Luo Qingcheng herself doubted that the Jun Wu Xie who stood before her was the same person who was unable to fight back, five years ago.

As Jun Wu Jie stood her ground calmly, her cold eyes swept over Luo Qingcheng’s astonished face, the dark green aura of the Spirit Ring which had expanded with the battle, its faint radiance reflected her stunning face.

“Everything that I did, is so that I can kill you.” Jun Wu Xie replied, as a cold gleam flashed in the depths of her eyes. Without giving any time for Luo Qingcheng to process her words, Jun Wu Xie abruptly rushed up towards her.
