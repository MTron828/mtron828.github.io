Jun Wu Xie’s lips were tight as she noted every reaction of Ye Jie. She suddenly turned and strode off without saying a word.

Ye Jie internally panicked as she hurriedly stood up and move to catch up with Jun Wu Xie.

However, Jun Wu Xie’s pace was very fast and was much faster than Ye Jie. In a blink of an eye, she had already reached the outside of the room. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The palace which was transformed by the Ghost City could not see the light of day but was lit with candles everywhere. The small courtyard outside the room was decorated intricately, but at this time, it was more like the graveyard shift, not daytime.

Jun Wu Xie’s gaze passed over every part of the courtyard as a faint, extremely inconspicuous scent of blood invaded her sense of smell. In a flash, her expression turned cold.

Ye Jie caught up with her as Jun Wu Xie chased after the scent of blood.

That scent of blood was so faint that it was almost invisible to the human nose, and unless Jun Wu Xie did not already had an inkling, it would have been very hard to have noticed.

As they stood guard outside the room, Ye Sha and Ye Mei’s faces were so anguished as they were very worried about Jun Wu Yao’s condition. They suddenly noticed Jun Wu Xie’s silhouette in their line of sight.

Almost in an instant, the goosebumps rose all over their bodies.

Seeing Jun Wu Xie fast approaching the door, Ye Sha took a step forward to subtly block Jun Wu Xie’s way and quickly said, “Miss? Why are you here? Lord Jue wanted to you rest, you...”

“Move.” Jun Wu Xie’s expression was icy cold.

Ye Sha panicked, and hurriedly gave a look at Ye Mei.

Ye Mei could only attempt to block Jun Wu Xie. If Miss saw Lord Jue’s current condition, this... would be a very bad situation.

Ye Jie who was chasing after Jun Wu Xie arrived and the three of them tried ways and means to stop her because they didn’t want her to enter the room.

Jun Wu Xie’s expression grew even colder as two Spirit Rings abruptly appeared in her palm and trapped the three of them to one side.

“Miss!” Ye Mei widened his eyes and tried to signal Jun Wu Yao’s impending danger.

Just as Jun Wu Xie was about to push open the door, the door suddenly opened.

A normal looking Jun Wu Yao stood within the doorway smilingly as he looked at the cold expression on Jun Wu Xie’s face, and he took a step forward to meet her.

The appearance of Jun Wu Yao not only surprised Jun Wu Xie, but also shocked the Ye trio.

Didn’t the Life and Death worm just attack Lord Jue?

Why does it seem like there is nothing wrong now?

“What’s wrong? Not seeing me for a while, is my wife missing her husband?” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie affectionately as he raised his hand to lightly pinch her face, his actions nothing out of the ordinary.

Jun Wu Xie was seemingly stunned as she saw an intact Jun Wu Yao, however she could not help but feel worried as she clearly smelled the faint scent of blood on his body.

“Just now when you saved me, did something go wrong? I smelled blood.” Jun Wu Xie swept a doubtful, suspicious glance all over Jun Wu Yao. His clothes were clean, there was no trace of blood and his face looked normal. It was completely different from her conjectures.

Jun Wu Yao let out a slight laugh, “What could possibly happen to me? You’re being too anxious. As for the scent of blood.....” A wicked grin flashed across his face as he bent slightly to whisper into Jun Wu Xie’s ear:

“The stained sheets, I’ve already kept them. If you don’t believe me, shall I take it out to show you?”

There was no change in Jun Wu Xie’s expression as she lifted her hand to check on Jun Wu Yao’s pulse, but did not discover anything strange.
