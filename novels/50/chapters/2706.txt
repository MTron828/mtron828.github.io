Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Ruan Zhongshan felt crushing pain throughout his whole body. Everything in front of him became blurred. In his line of sight, he could not no longer see appearance of Jun Wu Xie; only the vague white figure stood in front of him.

Never before had such immense fear shroud Ruan Zhongshan’s heart. After claiming to be the Lord of Long Xuan City, he had never been so embarrassed as he was today. All of his pride was completely destroyed by the white demon in front of him. .

Ruan Zhongshan shook his head violently, he could only hear a shrill ringing in his ears. Gradually, his vision cleared and he swept a glance through the battlefield and in that glance, everything he saw made his heart fall into a deep, dark pit.

The bloody battlefield was at a loss. Those Long Xuan City soldiers who had once made him proud had lost their helmets and armor, utterly defeated. Those men who emerged from Sea Spirit City were like a frantic wave that quickly engulfed Long Xuan City.

Over ...

Everything was over.

Ruan Zhongshan stumbled to his feet and it was not until this moment that he realized how much he had lost.

If everything could be repeated, he would never make such a choice again.

Unfortunately, everything is over.

Jun Wu Xie looked coldly at Ruan Zhongshan, who was downtrodden, and slowly walked towards him.

Ruan Zhongshan saw Jun Wu Xie approaching, his legs turned soft, and he fell onto the ground.

He raised his head and looked at Jun Wu Xie, who was unscathed, and the fear in his eyes could no longer be hidden.

“Wait ... wait a minute ...” Ruan Zhongshan lifted his hands which were full of blood, “I am wrong, I shouldn’t send troops to your Sea Spirit City, please forgive me ... I’ll leave right away ... Let’s pretend that nothing has happened! I can pay you many, many good things ... ”

Ruan Zhongshan was really scared. He never dreamed that he would be defeated in the hands of such a young boy, but that was what happened. In the face of Jun Wu Xie, he had no power to fight back. He could even harm one hair on Jun Wu Xie.

The enormous feeling of defeat made Ruan Zhongshan’s last trace of pride vanish.

Jun Wu Xie looked down coldly at a terrified Ruan Zhongshan, there was no emotions in her cold eyes at all.

“I gave you a chance.” Jun Wu Xie said lightly.

If Ye Sha’s message to him was the last chance she gave to Ruan Zhongshan.

However, he missed it, didn’t he?

Just as Ruan Zhongshan said to Jun Wu Xie before, but only this time, the person who answered was not Jun Wu Xie, but him!

“No ...” Ruan Zhongshan wanted to make the final struggle.

It was a pity that Jun Wu Xie did not intend to give him any more time to spout his nonsense! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A sword made of light materialised in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, with a flash of cold light, droplets of blood which fell in the sunlight...

Ruan Zhongshan lay on the ground with a thump, and a bloody gash had ripped open on his neck. The hot blood flowed from his wound continuously, taking away all his vitality at the same time.

The death of Ruan Zhongshan was the straw that broke the camel’s back. All the soldiers of Long Xuan City had no intention of fighting, and they fled one after another after being chased away by the Night Regime. The bloody killing finally came to an end. Those who were lucky to escape from Sea Spirit City unfortunately would have this nightmare accompany them for life.
