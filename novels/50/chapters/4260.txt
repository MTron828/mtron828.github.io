Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

As soon as Jun Gu’s words came out, the smile on Han Zi Fei’s face became extremely strange. Her gaze directly passed Jun Gu and was focused at Jun Wu Xie who was behind him.

Jun Gu also noticed Han Zi Fei’s anomaly. When he followed her gaze, it was a handsome boy that stood there. He couldn’t help but wonder as if he needed to ask something.

Of course ...

Jun Wu Xie’s heart was extremely shocked at this time. The dialogue between Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei greatly exceeded her expectations. She had discovered a secret between the two. At this moment, she could not care about the surprise and the recovery of her father’s consciousness. But she couldn’t help but stare at Han Zi Fei with a prying gaze, trying to ascertain something...

Father called her Zi Fei ...

He said...

Their child...

Huge clues were strung together in Jun Wu Xie’s mind and an answer came out from her heart. She opened her eyes wide and looked at Han Zi Fei in astonishment.

No wonder ... no wonder she had a natural affinity for Han Zi Fei. No wonder ... No wonder she subconsciously had no resistance to guard against Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei ...

So...

“Mother?” Jun Wu Xie’s lip trembled slightly and spit out the two words that lingered in her heart.

Han Zi Fei’s eyes became red in an instant. She immediately released herself from Jun Gu and took Jun Wu Xie into her arms.

“My child ... for so many years, You have suffered.”

The warm embrace made Jun Wu Xie a little embarrassed. Han Zi Fei’s response resonated with the conjecture in her heart. Jun Wu Xie didn’t know how to react for a while.

Han Zi Fei ... is her mother? !!

“Sorry, I didn’t dare to recognize you earlier... I’m not a good mother. I abandoned you back then, I ... I can’t believe it. I still have a chance to see you in this life, thank the merciful heavens ...” All the emotions that had been suppressed in her heart for all these years came pouring out as she broke down at this moment. She was holding Jun Wu Xie, her only child, and her long-awaited child. Her tears flowed and fell on Jun Wu Xie’s shoulders, and soaked her clothes.

That warmth was transmitted to the skin through the clothes on the shoulders. It was so real. The apology in her ears sounded like a dream.

She saved her father and found her mother?

The sudden news made Jun Wu Xie completely shocked. Both her hands hanging limply by her side, she didn’t know what she should do at this moment.

Jun Gu was even more shocked than Jun Wu Xie. He looked at his wife and daughter hugging tightly. His mind became blank. He had seen Jun Wu Xie in the Soul World before. He clearly remembered that his daughter had stunning looks like his wife’s. But why had she turned into the appearance of a young man?

The doubts in his heart came crashing down like the mountain. Jun Gu could not say a word. Looking at Han Zi Fei’s tears, his heart ached and felt distressed.

Han Zi Fei sobbed for a long time and finally raised her head. She looked at the surprised Jun Wu Xie with a smile at the corner of her mouth. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Little Wu Xie, do you hate me? Do you hate me for abandoning you?” Han Zi Fei had never dared to recognise Jun Wu Xie back then as she was afraid that her identity would bring trouble to Jun Wu Xie. Secondly ... She was afraid ... Afraid that Jun Wu Xie hated her!
