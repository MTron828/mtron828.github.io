A song here and a glass there and it was late into the night before anyone knew it and everyone present had become one large boisterous group. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jun Wu Xie and Shen Yan Xiao had not seen each other for ages and had much to catch up on.

Di Xie and Jun Wu Yao sat next to their respective wives, their feud now a thing of the past as they now only cared about the women next to them.

The so-called hatred had been resolved.

Fan Zhuo smiled and surveyed the happy scene in front of him and gradually came to rest his gaze on the handsome, smiling man seated opposite him. He was a man of few words and when the drunk Tang Na Zhi said something to him, he felt his hair stand on end.

If he remembered correctly, the man’s name was Qi Xia.

Fan Zhuo was curious about this man and observed him closely. After a while, he noticed that despite his outwardly casual demeanour, he carried an unmistakable air of sadness with him.

Qi Xia, who was in the middle of taking a drink, felt someone looking at him and raised his head to look Fan Zhuo in the eye.

The two intelligent men said nothing to each other. Qi Xia raised his glass and they made a silent toast to each other.

Fan Zhuo could not help but sigh after drinking the wine.

The moonlight was bright and the smell of wine filled the air.

The two tired children were carried back to the hall by Zhu Que and Tao Tie and their respective mothers took them over. Upon seeing the two sleeping children, Shen Yan Xiao flashed a mischievous smile and looked over at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie knew exactly what that look meant.

“Little Wu Xie, look...your LIttle Mo Ye is so well behaved and my son isn’t ugly. They may have gotten off on the wrong foot but they seem to be getting along fine now. Why don’t we....”

Shen Yan Xiao fluttered her eyelids at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie was helpless when it came to her friend’s way of thinking, but....

Regarding this proposal, she not only did not mind, she happily supported it.

“It’s all well and good but we live in different worlds. It’s easy to say when we are together but when the time comes for one of us to have to be separated from our child, there will be some difficulty.” Jun Wu Xie sighed lightly.

Shen Yan Xiao allayed her friend’s worry, “It’s a small matter, we’ve been fooled by the main god long enough and he should be grateful that we don’t take our revenge on him. Getting him to solve this issue won’t be a problem.”

Although Shen Yan Xiao was reluctant to bring him up, she had to admit that he was at a higher level than her or Jun Wu Xie.

“If that is possible, then I don’t see any issue.” Jun Wu Xie nodded.

The two children did not know that their futures had already been decided by their mothers while they were sleeping.

And that shared future will be another story.

For now, they were still children and they had a very long road ahead of them.
