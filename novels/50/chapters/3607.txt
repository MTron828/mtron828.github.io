“How does it feel to be like a dog that has lost its home?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Ba He as a cold smile emerged from the corner of her lips.

Ba He swallowed a mouthful of blood as he looked at her viciously. There was no need to mention him battling as a Gold Spirit now, even if he did not move, he could feel that the spirit power in his body was flowing out at an incredible speed and was increasing with each passing moment. In a mere moment, the last bit of good colour in his spirit energy had completely diminished.

Silver Spirit!

He had actually fallen to a Silver Spirit!

“There is no need to look at me like this, in just another ten minutes, you won’t even be a Silver Spirit anymore.” Jun Wu Xie looked at him with relish as she narrowed her eyes.

“Despicable! To actually use such unscrupulous means!” Ba He was infuriated and he could not wait to tear her apart.

“Despicable? In terms of despicable, how can I compare to you people of the the Upper Realm?” Jun Wu Xie was not angered by his words, instead, she looked at the Spirit Jade Palace Lord calmly and asked: “If a Gold Spirit wants to kill a Silver Spirit, is it easy?”

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord was stunned momentarily, grasping the meaning behind her words, he replied with a glee: “Naturally, it is simple as killing him like a dog.”

Although he suffered some injuries but it was not as heavy as Ba He’s. There was not much influence on his current strength.

Hadn’t Ba He kept mentioning that the people from the Middle Realm were like raised dogs to the Upper Realm? So why not let him experience how it felt like to be a beaten dog!

Jun Wu Xie raised her hand and threw a bottle of medicine over to the Spirit Jade Palace Lord. He reached out and caught it as he looked at her with puzzled eyes.

“This poison affects only the Gold Spirits, after taking the antidote, you wouldn’t be affected in any way.”

The face of the Spirit Jade Palace Lord lit up with joy and immediately drank it.

She waved her hands at Drunk Lotus and the three plants spirits immediately joined the battle.

Drunk Lotus strength was similar to that of a Purple Spirit. At the beginning when Jun Wu Xie started cultivating Little Lotus with the help of the embellished wooden bead given by Jun Wu Yao, it had a tremendous influence on his strength. Each time she cultivated, it would also boost the strength of her own ring spirit. In addition, Jun Wu Xie had previously cultivated in the Spirit World with some soul cultivating techniques. She had raised Drunk Lotus, Poppy and Poison Ivy alongside with hers which was why the strength of Drunk Lotus and the rest of them were not on par with Gold Spirits but they were not far off.

The moment the three of them joined the battle, they immediately stirred up three blood coloured whirlwinds on the battlefield!

The pressure that everyone felt had been reduced drastically and when they discovered that the Gold Spirits were losing their spirit energy, their morale had suddenly risen to an unprecedented height!

The situation of the other Gold Spirits were much worse than Ba He’s, in the blink of an eye, the entire situation had been reversed.

Ba He stared at Jun Wu Xie vindictively, even if you beat him to death, he would never have imagined himself to have fallen to such a point. He had long been accustomed to suppressing everything by force. Never had he expected that Jun Wu Xie would use such method and clip their wings.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord cracked his knuckles, on that handsome face of his, a resplendent smile filled with killing intent surfaced. His eyes were locked onto Ba He’s body, but he spoke to Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom beside him: “There is no need for you here, go help Drunk Lotus and the rest.”

Tenacious Snow Plum Blossom nodded his head cheerfully and with a resolute, “yes”, he immediately disappeared in a flash.

“Young Miss Jun, now all you have to do is to sit by and watch.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jun Wu Xie did not have any objections, the Face of Selvan had already been badly damaged, and her energy had been almost completely depleted. However, in exchange for the success in toppling over Ba He and the Gold Spirits, everything was worth it.
