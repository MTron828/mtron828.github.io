Ruan Zhongshan’s agenda was very obvious. He did all of this just to show some ‘goodwill’ to Jun Wu Xie. If it was changed to any other City Lords of Sea Spirit City, to be able to receive praises by the City Lord of Long Xuan City, they would have already agreed in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, the person Ruan Zhongshan met was Jun Wu Xie ...

Jun Wu Xie watched Ruan Zhongshan and Xu Zu perform the good cop bad cop routine without any changes in her expression.

After Ruan Zhongshan finally finished speaking, Jun Wu Xie then said, “Have you finished all that you wanted to say?”

Ruan Zhongshan was stunned momentarily. Jun Wu Xie’s response was a little too calm and it was completely different from his imagination.

“The good intentions of City Lord Ruan have been conveyed to my heart, but since this decision has been made, I will never take it back. Even if City Lord Ruan does not intend to let other cities know, I will let them know.” Jun Wu Xie raised her chin slightly as her cold gaze eyes swept across Ruan Zhongshan’s face.

Ruan Zhongshan’s complexion changed slightly. How would he have thought that this City Lord would rather have things done the hard way? He had already expressed his kind intentions, but not only did this kid not appreciate it, he even put on such a cold attitude!

“Has City Lord Yan really made up your mind?” Ruan Zhongshan’s face gradually became gloomy. He was not a good-natured man, and he was able to speak with Jun Wu Xie nicely for such a long time was rare, yet Jun Wu Xie did not care about it at all. This made it hard for him to believe.

“City Lord Yan, do you know that your decision will not be related to you alone, but to the entire Sea Spirit City? If the Sea Spirit City interrupts the supply of Sea Spirit Beast, do you think that there is a place in the 72 cities City for it? ”

This time, Ruan Zhongshan’s tone had completely changed.

He had never met such an idiot who did not to know what was good for oneself. He talked so well to persuade him, yet he still replied so impudently? Did he really think that just by the strength of Sea Spirit City, he could really dominate the 72 cities?

Even if there was an elixir to help, but the foundation of the Sea Spirit City was so fragile. Ruan Zhongshan did not believe that Jun Wu Xie could enhance the strength of the entire Sea Spirit City in a short time.

Since she refused the proffered wine, then she now could only have wine as punishment!

“Whether or not there is a position, it is not someone else who has the final say, but it is I.” Jun Wu Xie said in a cold voice, with a calm tone filled with absolute arrogance.

Ruan Zhongshan harrumphed coldly. Even if he was a fool, he could see that the kid in front of him didn’t take him seriously. Such arrogance had never appeared before any of the other City Lords of Sea Spirit City. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Yan Hai, one can’t be too rigid and talk with such arrogance. Be careful of biting your own tongue, don’t think that no one else knows the reason behind the matter of your Sea Spirit City suddenly stopping the supply of Sea Spirit Beasts. Perhaps there may be something in your hands that really might change Sea Spirit City, but if you think that a little trick can turn things around, it is really too naive!” Ruan Zhongshan sneered and completely tore off the hypocritical mask he wore, revealing the natural arrogance in his tone.

Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow and looked at Ruan Zhongshan who had completely exposed his nature. In a mild tone, she replied, “What do you mean, City Lord Ruan? Does this mean you that you’ve discovered something?”

“What if I have or what if I haven’t? I had advised you nicely, yet you refused to listen. Since that’s the case, then there’s no longer a need to continue to waste time with you. I’ll just tell you that I want the formula for the elixir!” Ruan Zhongshan looked at Jun Wu Xie coldly as he declared his stance.
