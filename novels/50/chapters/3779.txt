Five hundred thousand Gold Spirits...

Just thinking about it made their heads tingle. Not to mention that among the five hundred thousand people, how many of them were experts that were able to condense spirit inscription?

There was no way for them to estimate it.

“With the speed they carried forward, they need at least one and a half months to reach the Lower Realm. It seemed like we need to prepare ourselves beforehand.” A serious expression was hanging on Rong Ruo’s face. The power of their enemies this time was beyond everything they had ever met before. Even the past Twelve Palaces were only considered as the tiny ants when being placed in front of the Upper Realm.

The Rui Lin Army wasn’t able to get too close to the troops because the strength of the Upper Realm was very strong. Therefore, they weren’t able to probe the number of experts in the forces accurately, but there was one thing that made Jun Wu Xie to settle her heart down.

Among the troops of the Upper Realm, the members of the Rui Lin Army saw a carriage which was pulled by eight war horses afar. The carriage was in all black and the view inside the carriage was completely blocked. But there was one time when the carriage was bumping along the road, it accidentally bumped open the window, and through the gap of the window, the members of the Rui Lin Army saw the figure of Jun Wu Yao!

Not only the news had softened the look in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes, but it had also made Qiao Chu and the others to secretly feel happy for Jun Wu Xie.

No matter how hard and difficult would the battle be, they are bound and determined to win the battle!

“I won’t believe it! Who cares if the Upper Realm is more stronger! It is our territory that they are going to fight on! If we aren’t going to beat their asses up, the efforts we made all these years would just be fed to those damn dogs!” Qiao Chu slapped on the table and spoke out his courageous words with a soaring aspiration.

The Lower Realm today wasn’t the same as the Lower Realm ten years ago. This place had been going through a big shift after Jun Wu Xie united the entire Lower Realm. From that moment on, the Lower Realm never stopped their pace from getting stronger and stronger. When Jun Wu Xie went missing five years ago, everyone in the Lower Realm was even more motivated to enhance themselves. For the whole five years, they had been trying their best to do anything they could, just for this moment...

When the battle came, they will be able to stand behind Jun Wu Xie and fight alongside her!

They didn’t want to stare helplessly at the scenes of desolation again!

They didn’t want to just cry and feel regret about them not being able to do anything again!

They too, didn’t want their beloved ones to disappear from their world, ever again! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Make this a one way trip for them!” With his eyes blazing, Hua Yao stretched out his hand.

“Make this a one way trip for them!” Fan Zhuo immediately reached out his hand and covered it on Hua Yao’s hand.

“Let them know the greatness of the Lower Realm!” Agreed Qiao Chu while he took out his hand.

“I’ll shattered them into pieces!” Fei Yan similarly stretched out a hand with a smile.

“It’s time to show our power.” While grinning, Rong Ruo followed their actions.

At the same time, the sights of the five people moved in the direction of Jun Wu Xie who still didn’t give any response till this moment. A strange glint flashed across Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. Gazing at her five determined and persevering partners who was just in front of her eyes, she suddenly reached out her hand and held onto the five overlapping hands.

Her rosy lips opened slowly and she steadily spoke out her enunciation with confidence.

“The victory, it belongs to us!”

“It belongs to us!!” A thunderous enunciation echoed in the big room. No matter who they were going to face, they would not step back!

Five years of tragedy would never happen again! All the things they endured during the whole five years, they were going to pay ten or hundred times back to them in the future battle!

No one would be allowed to run wild in their home field, the Lower Realm!
