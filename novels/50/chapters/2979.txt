Chapter 2980 Enemy approaching 2

“Miss Jun, are you going this time?” Nangong Lie looked at Jun Wu Xie. He was a little worried. Maybe he personally witnessed the close friendship between Jun Wu Xie and Qiao Chu and others. His cold heart could not help longing for some warmth. He could not help wondering that if he was not born in the Upper Realm, would this longing and hope be answered?

Relatives, friends and lovers were meaningless to the people in the Upper Realm. It happened that these were the things that Nangong Lie hoped for. It was precisely because of this extravagant hope that Nangong Lie would compromise under a little threat from Jun Wu Xie. Until now, his heart had begun to involuntarily think about them.

“Go.” Jun Wu Xie said firmly.

No matter what reason Chi Yan finds her, this was an opportunity to get closer to His Lord. Only then she could find out what was taken away from Jun Gu by His Lord. She would then be able to lift the life and death worm from Jun Gu’s body. Ultimately, she could completely destroy the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms!

Jun Wu Xie had come this far. She had put in so much effort. She could no longer turn back.

Even if she had to pass through mountains of swords and a sea of flames, she had to make a breakthrough!

Nangong Lie opened his mouth. But in the end, he could only choose to remain silent. What Jun Wu Xie was shouldering was something that no other could replace.

“I’ll accompany you.” Jun Wu Yao stood up. Since he came to the Upper Realm, Jun Wu Xie had faced most of the things alone. Now, the enemies that she was about to face were too dangerous. He could no longer stand behind her and watch her quietly.

Jun Wu Xie nodded. This time, she did not refuse.

If Chi Yan’s invitation was a conspiracy, it would indicate that His Lord already knew her origins. There would be a war. By then, there would be no need to conceal the identity of Jun Wu Yao. But if it was just a simple invitation, then Jun Wu Yao did not need to take a shot and he would not be exposed.

After having an idea, Jun Wu Xie calmed down instead. She had planned it for so long, all for this one day.

Qiao Chu and Hua Yao were sitting at the side and they looked at Jun Wu Xie. At this moment, they hoped that they could stand beside her and stand up together with her in the face of danger. However, their injuries weren’t fully healed and the Spirit Ring integration had not yet reached the point of perfection. If they rushed headfirst and went ahead with what they had now, it would only add an extra burden to Jun Wu Xie. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

For three days, Jun Wu Xie had not left the room. She set out to prepare Qiao Chu’s elixir for emergency use.

In case of emergency, she deliberately left all her ring spirits to take care of the safety of her companions and instructed Nangong Lie to ensure their safety. A few days ago, a message was sent to Ye Sha and others who were far away in the Sea Spirit City. At this moment, Ye Gu and Ye Sha should have left for Sacred City.

Everything was ready. On the day of the appointment, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao made some preparations and left the room. They walked towards Chi Yan’s mansion.

These days, the selection battle was in full swing. Long Yao seemed to have disappeared and had not appeared at the competition again. His Lord had replaced Long Yao with Qing Ke who became the new examiner.

The night was dark and there was a bustling crowd everywhere in the Sacred City. Jun Wu Yao took Jun Wu Xie’s hand and shuttled among the crowd.
