Early the next morning, they were all prepared and ready to depart for the Spirit World. Before leaving, Jun Wu Xie summoned Ye Gu, Ye Sha and Ye Mei individually and spoke to each of them for a long time in her room. However, no one knew what they were discussing and only knew that after Jun Wu Xie left Lin Palace, all three of them brought the Night Regime and left as well, no one knew where they went.

Although Jun Qing was curious, but he knew that it was not suitable for him to know much about the Night Regime’s movements. All he can say that if there was a need for cooperation, the Rui Lin Army do their best.

In the small wooden cabin between the valleys, Jun Wu Xie and the others appeared and it made those guards from the Rui Lin Army extremely excited. If not for the strict discipline of self-control of the Rui Lin Army, they would have already rushed to the front of Jun Wu Xie. However, they could only look on at her with their excited gazes and bright smiles.

“Young Miss.” One soldier’s voice already trembled with excitement when he greeted her.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly.

Jun Qing had accompanied them here but this time round, he would not be entering the Spirit World together with them.

After reaching the little wooden cabin, Jun Qing’s footsteps halted for a moment as he turned to look at her.

“Little Xie, this time round your uncle will not be accompanying you. Since you want to hold the battle in the Lower Realm, then during this time, I would need to make some arrangements with Qu Ling Yue. Please be careful when you enter the Spirit World.” Jun Qing’s words may have sounded simple but all the care and concern were there.

The Spirit World had already joined forces with the Lower Realm but he still could not help but want to show some concern.

Jun Wu Xie understood his sentiments and obediently nodded her head.

“If you encounter any accidents, remember the words that you’ve promised to your grandfather. You are not allowed to play the disappearing act.” Jun Qing’s expression turned serious as he looked at her with a firm gaze.

They could no longer bear to be separated for another five years.

Jun Wu Xie replied with a soft “Mn.”

“Uncle, you can rest assured that we will take care of Little Xie and she would not leave our sights. We would bring her out the way we came in.” Qiao Chu patted his chest heartedly as he gave his assurance.

Jun Qing was unable to remain so serious when he saw Qiao Chu’s actions. He could only smile helplessly and nodded his head, “Then I would have to trouble you all.”

“Uncle, there is no need to be so polite with us.” Qiao Chu was full of smiles while he was talking. During those five years, in order to search for Jun Wu Xie, they had been very close with the people from Lin Palace, even the manner in which he addressed Jun Qing could be seen how familiar they had gotten.

“Alright, go on. Don’t let me delay you.” Jun Qing said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Only after Jun Wu Xie had one more look at Jun Qing that she stepped into that small wooden cabin. Qiao Chu and the others followed closely behind and even Qin Song and Long Jiu gave Jun Qing a slight nod before they entered. Only Situ Heng continued pulling on a long face all throughout.

Jun Qing looked at Situ Heng and the moment the door was shut, his brows furrowed. He did not know why but he was concerned about this person called Situ Heng, he always had a feeling that there was something not right with him.

Jun Qing did not give it much thought any further because Jun Wu Xie had informed them of her plan last night. She intended to lead the forces of the Upper Realm to the Lower Realm and use the natural suppression that the Lower Realm had on the people from the Upper Realm. It would be a battle to the death and she did not know which side would prevail. Jun Qing did not dare to have any neglect and would use all the remaining time and mobilize all the forces in the Lower Realm to prepare!

When he thought of this, his steps quickened and became more determined with each step.

This time, they would fight side by side with Jun Wu Xie!
