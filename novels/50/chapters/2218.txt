Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

As Ren Huang spoke, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord looked at Jun Wu Xie directly, for he knew where a certain someone came from.

Jun Wu Xie cleared her throat and said, “As for the matters of the Lower Realm, there is no need for Grandmaster to worry because... that’s my territory.”

“Huh?” Ren Huang looked at her with wide eyes.

Her territory? What did it mean?

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord could not help but laugh out as he explained, “Great Master Ren Huang was it? When your grand disciple annihilated the Twelve Palaces, it was not from the powers of the Spirit Jade Palace but it was a force that she had personally brought. After the Twelve Palaces had been uprooted, that force had completely disappeared from the Middle Realm without a trace. Can you guess where that force came from?

Ren Huang was stunned momentarily, there was something in the words of the Spirit Jade Palace Lord. He was obviously implying something as he looked at Jun Wu Xie meaningfully.

Jun Wu Xie said, “They’re from the Lower Realm, like myself.”

Her voice was calm but her words made Ren Huang look at her with incredulity. It was simply unbelievable! How sparse was the spirit qi in the Lower Realm? How was it able to raise Jun Wu Xie into such a perverse genius?

When he first met this child for the first time, he had thought that Jun Wu Xie was very talented. In the Middle Realm, Jun Wu Xie was already considered a Dragon and Phoenix amongst men. How could he ever have thought that Jun Wu Xie was originally from the Lower Realm? It was extremely difficult to cultivate to a Purple Spirit, if he had remembered correctly, he had met Jun Wu Xie at Mount Fu Yao, Jun Wu Xie was already a Purple Spirit...

She was only a teenager, to be able to reach such heights, moreover she had cultivated from the Lower Realm!

Even for Ren Huang who thought that he had seen everything, he still could not help but be surprised by her origins.

A Purple Spirit from the Lower Realm, in a short span of a mere two years, she was almost going to advance to the Gold Spirit, how old was she only?

“Is what you say true?” Ren Huang did not even notice that his voice was slightly trembling.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head.

“Each and every word is true.”

Ren Huang suddenly slapped his thigh with exhilaration!

“Good brat! I’ve already thought that you were a little monster so rare that could only be met once in a millennium. I did not expect that you are far beyond that! A Silver Spirit from the Lower Realm... No... It won’t be long before you would break through to the Gold Spirit. Ha ha ha... This is really... a talented generation ah!” Ren Huang chortled, he was very satisfied with this grand disciple of his. For Jun Wu Xie to be able to achieve such a height despite being from the Lower Realm made him extremely gratified.

“When did you come to the Middle Realm?” Ren Huang asked with his face full of smiles.

“When I came to Mount Fu Yao, I had just arrived in the Middle Realm not too long ago.” She replied honestly.

When he heard that, he was even more exhilarated as he roared out in laughter. According to her words, she had only been in the Middle Realm for slightly more than two years. And it was within these two years that this child had advanced from a Purple Spirit to Silver Spirit. If given more time, with this little prodigy’s frightening talent, even those from the Upper Realm could not compare to her.

“I have a strong hunch that you would definitely become a huge headache for the Upper Realm.” The more he thought about it, the happier he was. He was extremely happy to have able to have met someone who could rival the Upper Realm, moreover this person was the very person he had picked out as his grand disciple.

With the measly spirit qi in the Lower Realm, to be able to reach the Purple Spirit was very rare and adding on the two years that Jun Wu Xie was in the Middle Realm, she had almost reached the peak of the strongest in the Middle Realm. If this was not perverse, then what was it?
