3076 The Final Battle 4

The person in the wheelchair was stiff and his eyes were glazed over, it might have been more suitable to describe that person as a puppet.

However, what shocked Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao was the appearance of that person.

That man looked exactly like Jun Wu Yao and also had a pair of violet eyes. Those eyes however, were dim with no spark in them whatsoever.

The God of Destruction had also come down from his platform and was standing next to Feng Ming. He bent slightly to take a look at the man in the wheelchair.

“Ye Jue, do you remember anything now?” The God of Destruction picked up the left hand of the man in the wheelchair.

That otherwise slender and good looking hand was missing its little finger!

Jun Wu Yao looked at where the missing finger should have been and scenes began playing in his mind. The man looked weak and his head was swollen.

“Wu Yao?!” Jun Wu Xie looked at him nervously, his reaction was making her worry.

“Hahaha, looks like you do remember something.” The God of Destruction stood up straight, looking arrogantly and laughing at Jun Wu Yao.

“Do you need me to help you recall what happened in Su Ruiying’s Soul Chamber? If you didn’t break into the chamber then, you probably wouldn’t have had to suffer all that time.”

Jun Wu Yao covered his forehead while cold sweat kept dripping from it. When he saw those lifeless violet eyes, everything he had forgotten came rushing back to him.

His past which had been erased by the God of Destruction.

When Jun Wu Yao was still Ye Jue, nobody in the Three Realms could handle him and even the God of Destruction gave him a wide berth. Before getting afflicted with the life and death worm, he had met Su Ruiying and found her quite strange so he went to her residence to check on her.

And had also entered the basement that was full of souls.

What he found was not an empty chamber but instead there was a person inside it.

A person who looked exactly like him, lying in the middle of the room....

Jun Wu Yao was shocked and wanted to find out everything. But the God of Destruction appeared suddenly and used a spell cast by Su Ruiying to capture him. It was this spell that caused him to go into battle and get afflicted by the life and death worm and that memory was erased by the God of Destruction.

Flashes of his memory came back but Jun Wu Yao managed to straighten his furrowed brow, a cold light flashed across his eyes.

“If you had not discovered that, I might have let you stay in the Upper Realm since the other soul was always going to come. But you were too careless.”

Jun Wu Yao narrowed his eyes at the God of Destruction while Jun Wu Xie looked on worriedly.

Jun Wu Yao secretly pulled Jun Wu Xie’s hand and gave her a look that only she could understand. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The Soul Bone you stole was from him and no matter how well you’ve hidden it, as long as it remains in the Three Realms, you can’t escape the effects of the Blood Sacrifice Array.” The God of Destruction said gleefully.
