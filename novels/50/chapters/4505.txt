Chapter 3101 Killing A God 7

After the two golden circles came to rest upon them, they could feel their spiritual power and bodies return to normal as the circles protected them from the external forces.

“This power....” Jun Gu looked around at the golden hue that was now surrounding them. It brought a sense of peace to both their bodies and spiritual power and it also brought with it a sense of familiarity and intimacy.

“It’s Little Xie.” Han Zi Fei began to choke up as she felt the familiar presence of their daughter. Even in the heat of battle, she had not only remembered them but even used a part of her power to protect them.

“I hope Little Xie can get through this trial, I only pray for her safe return.” Jun Gu said worriedly, his heart filled with concern for their daughter.

Their child had already gone through too much and they were not strong enough to help her. They could only pray for her victory over the God of Destruction!

...

On the battlefield, the God of Destruction’s power kept increasing. In the face of Jun Wu XIe’s attack, not only was it not diminishing but seemed to be growing and the look on his face was only getting more and more crazy.

“Jun Wu XIe, you cannot defeat me! By using the integrated reincarnation spell, I’m only getting stronger! The powers of all your friends and loved ones are now part of the power that I will use to crush you!” The God of Destruction stared at Jun Wu Xie with bloodshot eyes.

He had to admit that Jun Wu Xie had become extremely powerful, but....

This was his battleground!

He had already given up on the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms. Even without Jun Wu Yao to break through the void, he could still absorb the power of everyone in the Three Realms and in doing so, become someone that was feared by all!

Jun Wu Xie stared coldly at the manic God of Destruction. In the midst of the battle, she could clearly feel his powers increasing and what he said made the gravity of the situation even clearer. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She had already guessed the God of Destruction’s plan and sent out some of her power to protect Han Zi Fei and the rest. But her powers were only being depleted and could only protect people within a certain range, if they left the Holy City she was not sure if she could continue to protect them.

The God of Destruction must be stopped!

He had to be stopped before his spell reached the entire Three Realms!

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath and attacked the God of Destruction once again!

The battle to end all battles continued to rage on and the God of Destruction’s power kept increasing. Power came from all around as it was used by the God of Destruction to defeat Jun Wu Xie. Something had changed in this previously one-sided battle.

Although Jun Wu Xie’s power had grown tremendously, it was not growing anymore and it was difficult to keep fighting against the God of Destruction whose power was ever increasing.
