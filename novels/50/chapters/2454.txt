Once Jun Wu Xie stepped into the Upper Realm, there was no doubt that she would be facing immense danger.

Disapprovingly, Jun Wu Xie shook her head and said. “Though we have won the battle this time, it was actually not a prudential strategy. As long as the Upper Realm hasn’t given up on conducting the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, even though Wu Yao has gotten his freedom back and we still have the soul bone in our hands, nobody can be sure if there’s still any more wicked method left for them to carry out their plan. We shouldn’t be just sitting aside and wait until the moment they move.”

A decision had earlier been made in Jun Wu Xie’s mind.

As long as the Upper Realm hadn’t given up their plan in conducting the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, then all the lives in the Three Realms would be living in fear for the whole time. Although she was now holding on some of the most important conditions of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, her lack of understanding towards the Upper Realm had failed her from being able to grasp the movement of the Upper Realm anytime. No one would know whether if the Upper Realm had kept a more vicious card in order to achieve their goal.

A passive counterattack was never a right way to deal with the issue. Only by launching an attack first, could they seize an initiative in the adversity.

“We need further considerations for this matter. No reckless action should be taken.” Subconsciously, Jun Xian turned solemn. Although they had won the battle once, it wasn’t their final victory. Uptil today, the person who was dominating the Upper Realm was still oppressing over the tops of their heads.

It had taken five years for Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao to deal with Luo Qingcheng and her people. Who would know how scary was the Master of Luo Qingcheng, also known as the strongest person in the Upper Realm, going to be?

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slowly.

She believed that the Upper Realm would find out the fiasco of Luo Qingcheng and her army in no time. The fact couldn’t be hidden long. When the moment came, how would the Upper Realm react? What were they going to do next? Jun Wu Xie had no idea. All she could do was just to make the sally as soon as possible to ensure that nothing would go wrong.

The only certain thing was that the following movement of the Upper Realm would definitely not be this careless anymore.

“Alright, it’s not too late for you to think about these later. Think about your marriage with Wu Yao first.” While looking at Jun Wu Xie who was lost in her thoughts, Jun Qing couldn’t help but say.

This girl had been all uptight for years and she could finally relax herself now. Just give her a break.

Jun Xian understood Jun Qing’s concern. He then smiled and said. “Your uncle is right. This is currently our most important thing to do. It’s our Lin Palace’s girl who is getting married, no sloppiness should be allowed.”

Jun Wu Xie stunned. Though she was the one who mentioned that she wanted to get married, but in reality, except for the few sentences that she had said before that, she didn’t really have any concept about marriage.

She thought that after the engagement, all she had to do was just to pray to God when the day she got married arrived.

These were even things that Jun Wu Xie learned after watching Qu Lingyue and “her” marriage.

“Qiao Chu and the others have told me the things about the wedding dress. There’s nothing for you to worry about. It has been ready for you,” said Jun Qing with a smile. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s ready?” Jun Wu Xie looked surprisingly at Jun Qing.

With his tone getting softer, Jun Qing nodded his head.

“It’s been long ready. We’re not the one to prepare the dress but your mother.”

“Mother.” Jun Wu Xie slightly stunned. There was almost nothing related to the word “mother” in her memory.

She had seen the “body” of her father, Jun Gu, but her mother... She only appeared once in a while in their conversations when Jun Xian and Jun Qing mentioned about her.

Jun Wu Xie still remembered their words, that her mother had faced difficulties when giving birth to her. Though her life was saved, her vitality was heavily sapped and she then passed away within a month. Jun Wu Xie had never known anything about her mother.
