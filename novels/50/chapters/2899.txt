Chapter 2900: Life and death worm (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

This news made Han Zi Fei infuriated, she could not tolerate such a thing! The souls of 9,999 babies who had just arrived in the world and had yet to feel the beauty of this world, were deprived of their right to survive after being born. And their souls would always be trapped in life and death worm!

Jun Wu Xie finally understood why Jun Wu Yao would be affected by life and death worm. Although she didn’t know all about refining life and death worm, this was enough to shock her.

Nearly ten thousand dead souls were entangled day and night, living and dying in Jun Wu Yao’s body, which was equivalent to torturing nearly ten thousand dead souls trapped in his body. Who could withstand this kind of resentment and despair?

As long as life and death worm still existed, those souls could not reincarnated. They still exist in life and death worm and have not disappeared. It was their resentment that was constantly limiting the power of Jun Wu Yao.

And this hatred did not arise because of Jun Wu Yao.

“Those souls are all from the Upper Realm ... that person is really ... cruel and ruthless.” Han Zi Fei’s complexion turned white. She was already a mother. She had always been very displeased with the indifference of the relationship from the Upper Realm. She could not stand to see children suffering at all.

As the ruler of the Upper Realm, His Lord could use the lives of nearly 10,000 people to quench a spirit without blinking ...

Han Zi Fei couldn’t imagine how bloody that life and death worm was, and how many people were deprived of their lives.

Jun Wu Xie wanted to ask more about life and death worm from Elder Luo. But Elder Luo could not say anything. When she was refining the life and death worm, Elder Luo had not given birth to Luo Qingcheng. Her body was not damaged yet so she had the opportunity to go out and collect those children, and His Lord only told her these, and she didn’t know more.

“No!” Jun Gu suddenly said.

“What’s wrong?” Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Gu.

Jun Gu’s gaze looked at Jun Wu Yao unsteadily.

“According to Elder Luo, when His Lord asked her to collect those children, Jun Wu Yao had not appeared in the Upper Realm. So in other words, before Jun Wu Yao appeared, His Lord had deliberately created the life and death worm. But looking at the whole Upper Realm, who could threaten His Lord’s position and made him want to spend his energy to refine such a brutal poison? This happened before the existence of Jun Wu Yao. Could it be such a coincidence that this life and death worm could restrain the power of Jun Wu Yao.” Jun Gu revealed his doubts in his heart.

In terms of timing, the life and death worm was created earlier than the presence of Jun Wu Yao. An early preparation for the arrival of Jun Wu Yao ... This was too weird.

Jun Gu’s words were like a beacon that illuminated the mist in Jun Wu Xie’s heart. She opened her eyes slightly and looked at Jun Wu Yao, but there was also a confusion in Jun Wu Yao’s eyes.

Life and death worm was like a tailor made for him.

But it was a long time before his arrival.

Could it be that...

His Lord knew early that Jun Wu Yao might appear, so he did all this ahead of time?

This guess was a bit too amazing, but no matter whether it was Jun Wu Xie or Jun Wu Yao, this suspicion could not be removed from the heart.

Even...

In their hearts, there was a voice telling them that it was all true.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
