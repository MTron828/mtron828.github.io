Chapter 343: “Overpowered (6)”

Hua Yao and Qiao Chu looked at Jun Wu Xie in surprise. That small frame before them had a backbone stronger than any!

“I don’t need you to protect me. Between us, we are merely allies in our cooperation. You do not need to give up your lives for that. I will not be able to repay you enough.” She already felt indebted to that moron and she did not want to increase that debt with any more people.

Hua Yao and Qiao Chu were speechless as they stared at Jun Wu Xie in confusion.

Jun Wu Xie’s words had been cold and almost sounded heartless. But the two of them knew deep in their hearts that Jun Wu Xie said it in such a way to make them back off and not get dragged into the danger before them.

“We need no repayment, we just feel like it.” Qiao Chu laughed as he said that.

Jun Wu Xie remained where she was, her back ramrod straight, unwilling to turn her head.

The white robed man looked on impatiently at the three youths. “Brat, I only want your ring spirit. If you don’t want your comrades to die, just stay still and let me take your ring spirit.”

The three youths put together would not need more than a finger of his to take them on.

“Enough with your nonsense! If you want to touch Little Xie, you’ll only be able to do that after we’re dead!” Qiao Chu stood forward without hesitation and and released his spiritual powers. Unexpectedly, the spiritual power surrounding him was actually purplish in colour!

Hua Yao followed right after and released his spiritual power. A purple glow emanated from his body!

Both of them have attained the purple level in their spiritual powers!

Jun Wu Xie looked in surprise at Hua Yao and Qiao Chu. They were both just a few years older than she was and they had both attained the peak purple level!

It had been a century since a purple spirit had appeared under the skies, and these two were still youths. How did they achieve that!?

The white robed stared in surprise as well when he saw the purple glow envelope Hua Yao and Qiao Chu. But soon, a smile appeared on his face.

“Forcefully upgrading your spiritual powers..... You would not last long, would you? Purple spirit..... Ha! I guess that’s the highest level you can forcefully raise yourselves up to at the moment. A pity..... Two purple spirits, are still beneath my notice!” The white robed man’s eyes narrowed and he charged right at Hua Yao and Qiao Chu!

Qiao Chu and Hua Yao used every ounce of their spiritual powers to take on the white robed man together. Even the double headed bone snake and the Ying Yang Bear joined the battle. Jun Wu Xie could not hold herself back any longer and rushed into the battle with the black beast!

It was one against six, and it should have been a given who had the advantage. But as the battle raged, the outcome was totally unbelievable!

The white robed man, under the assault from six joined forces, took them on easily!

Even having two highly skilled purple spirits joining forces were not a match for the white robed man.

Jun Wu Xie, who had just broken through to the orange level was not able to contribute much to their might.

The white robed man handled his opponents with a cold smile on his face. One of the strikes of his palm broke the tail of the double headed bone snake, and a flying kick sent the Ying Yang Bear soaring. The white robed man with his body still in mid air, fully extended his arms outwards, and a hand grabbed onto Hua Yao’s shoulder. He tightened his grip and the sound of bones breaking could be heard. He then flung his hand and Hua Yao was thrown out of the battle. His other hand clenched into a fist and he swung it smashing into Qiao Chu’s face!

In a flash!

Blood flew!

Qiao Chu’s temple bone cracked and blood flowed from the opened wound. Half of his face was bruised black and blue. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The black beast leapt at the white robed man from the back, but was held by its throat and lifted.

“Kid, if this fight continues, your comrades are really going to lose their lives.” The white robed man said as he laughed evilly, still holding the black beast by the throat.

Jun Wu Xie was already battered and bruised, her left hand was broken in the battle earlier. She bit on her lip and stared coldly at the frighteningly powerful white robed man.
