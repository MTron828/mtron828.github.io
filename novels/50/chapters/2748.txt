The guard told them everything he had heard, that not only were the soldiers of the Five City Coalition killed, the spies who were hiding in Sea Spirit City were killed as well. This was the reason why they had received the news so late.

Not only that, the spies placed in the other cities were killed as well! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jun Wu Xie cleaned up the entire Sea Spirit City with a bang. Nowadays, no one knew what was going on within Sea Spirit City.

“How is this possible? Sea Spirit City can destroy the Five City Coalition? By themselves? What about Master Nangong!” Nangong Yan refused to accept such unbelieveable news. Although the number of people they sent this time was not many, they were all elite fighters. And the leader was Nangong Lie, one of the top ten exponents. Such was the might of that army that even White Night City might not be able to stomach in a single night! And yet, how could Sea Spirit City have done so, especially after fighting a number of battles successively?

“We can’t find any news of Master Nangong ...” The guard said guiltily. In fact, no one would have believed this piece of news, if not for the fact that many people had witnessed the scorched bodies in person. They wouldn’t have been able to accept this fact so quickly otherwise.

“And actually ... Master Guan Hu, Master Liu Yi, their heads ... were placed in front of the corpses...”

They had found it hard to accept the deaths of Guan Hu and others. Although they were not as good as Nangong Lie, they were powerful in their own right. Not many people in the regular cities could be their opponents, and yet... they were all dead...

“What?!!!” The Lord of the Heavenly City suddenly blew up, a bloody sting was at his throat, and he couldn’t spit it out.

Sea Spirit City really did it so decisively? They really dared to kill Guan Hu and the others?

This was a clear declaration of war on the five cities!!!

Jun Wu Xie’s action was tantamount to slapping Nangong Yan and the four cities in the face, in front of everyone within the 72 cities. She had slapped them till they were befuddled.

“Damn Yan Hai! He really wants to cause havoc!” Nangong Yan smashed the wooden table beside him, his eyes were bloodshot!

The reaction of Heaven Fiend City Lord was exactly the same as that of Nangong Yan. They didn’t care about how many people had died. What they really cared about was Jun Wu Xie’s complete and utter disregard for them. Someone’s palm was already drawn up to their faces and they didn’t know till it was too late. How could they stand tall in front of the other cities?!

“Send out the troops!! I won’t believe that a piece of a shit place like Sea Spirit City really has the ability to go against the natural order of things! If I don’t raze Sea Spirit City to the ground, I will write the three words ‘Nangong Yan’ backwards!” Nangong Yan was thoroughly angry, even after fighting with White Night City for so many years, he had never been so embarrassed. He never thought that he would fail in an extremely simple task of eliminating Sea Spirit City, that city had caused him to lose face!

The Lord of Heaven Fiend City looked at Nangong Yan’s angry expression, he felt the same anger in his heart but he also had an extra concern.

“It’s not difficult to send troops to Sea Spirit City. Although they said they saw a lot of corpses, they still haven’t heard any news about Master Nangong. I remember... Did they bring news that Master Nangong is ill and bedridden? I think the reason why Sea Spirit City was able to succeed is probably because they used some unscrupulous means. Otherwise, with the strength of Master Nangong, how could he have fallen sick so easily? How Sea Spirit City destroyed our army remains to be discussed, but I can be sure, they definitely did not do it honorably. Now, the pressure from White Night City is mounting, if we were to transfer our forces to Sea Spirit City... the journey is long. If they become the target of White Night City, I’m afraid it would be a conflict too close to home.”
