Chapter 2882: Holy Land (1)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In the early morning of the second day, Jun Wu Xie woke up from her happiness. Yesterday, she had asked Han Zi Fei about the Holy Land before she left.

As far as Han Zi Fei’s understanding of the Holy Land was concerned, the Holy Land was of great help to Jun Wu Xie’s spiritual power. The person residing in the Holy Land was likely to be helpful in lifting the life and death worm from Jun Wu Yao. And that was Elder Luo.

Han Zi Fei did not know much about Elder Luo. Before Han Zi Fei had escaped, Elder Luo had disliked her. The reason was that Elder Luo had given birth to Luo Qingcheng whose bloodline was relatively pure. Although Luo Qingcheng’s bloodline was not as pure as Han Zi Fei, she was qualified to be a Sacred Maiden. But with Han Zi Fei’s existence, there was no room for Luo Qingcheng.

Because of this, Elder Luo’s status in the Sacred Maiden Tribe became stagnant and she had no chance to climb any further. It would be strange if she liked Han Zi Fei.

Jun Wu Xie wanted to enter the Holy Land. Qiao Chu could only remain at their residence. But for this, it was rare that Qiao Chu and the rest did not even let out a sigh. Instead they could not wait to send Jun Wu Xie away. Qiao Chu’s cheekiness made Jun Wu Xie speechless. This group of heartless friends could not wait for her to leave for a while so that they could rightfully seize her parents .

Only then did Jun Wu Xie realised that her parents were too outstanding that the others would want to cling on them!

However, Jun Wu Xie did not forget the process. Not only Qiao Chu and the rest, Zheng Weilong and Ah Da came to this trip too. But Jun Wu Xie had no time to manage them. They were very law-abiding and obedient. They rarely walk about in the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Jun Wu Xie only let Fan Zhuo convey her schedule and inform Zheng Weilong about it.

When Jun Wu Xie came to the hall of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, Elder Yun was already waiting there. When she saw Jun Wu Xie coming, she immediately greeted her with a smile.

“The Holy Land is the key in my Sacred Maiden Tribe. In order to enable Lord Yan to better cultivate here, I will take you there this time.” Elder Yun said beautifully.

Of course, Jun Wu Xie would not be easily mislead. Elder Yun suddenly changed her mind. There must be a special reason to take her personally. She just had to wait and see what will happen.

“I’ll have to trouble you then.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Elder Yun smiled and said, “Then let’s proceed. We will talk about the Holy Land as we walk.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

Elder Yun immediately led the way.

Along the way, Elder Yun explained a lot about the Holy Land.

In fact, the existence of the entire holy mountain had greatly benefited the cultivation of the psychic force. So the moment the Sacred Maidens appeared, they grew up in the holy mountain, which also made them born naturally after generations of inheritance. Have more powerful mental power than ordinary people.

In the eyes of others, the role of spiritual power may not be as obvious as that of timely spiritual power. In the battle, there are no gorgeous moves and overbearing lethality. However, the horror of mental power is in its defense . FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A person with enough mental power can control even the will of a single-spirited strong person, and can control a certain number of Gold Spirits within a certain range. How terrible was this influence in war?

Therefore, the Sacred Maiden Tribe rely on the strong psychic force. It held a pivotal position in the Upper Realm. This was the pride of the Sacred Maiden Tribe.
