“What did you say... about Ye Jue?” Jun Wu Xie stood in front of Qiu Yun as her gaze swept over his face that had crumbled with panic, like an ice blade that had been unsheathed.

Qiu Yun could not stop trembling and the way he looked at her now was as if she was a devil who had crawled out from the depths of hell. He had never felt such unprecedented fear ever since his strength was considered high in the Upper Realm, when had he suffered something like this? If not for the vines supporting his body, he would have already fallen to the ground with his soft legs.

Faced with such horror, Qiu Yun could not even utter a single word out and he could only look at Jun Wu Xie with wide eyes filled with trepidation.

Jun Wu Xie raised her chin slightly as she narrowed her eyes that were filled with killing intent.

She slowly raised her hand and a dark green Spirit Ring appeared. That faint dark green glow that it emitted shone onto his face and it took only a mere moment when his face turned white!

Spirit Ring!

This woman actually condensed out a Spirit Ring!

Qiu Yun widened his eyes incredulously, and was unwilling to believe everything that he saw. The Spirit Ring was the quintessence of power that only those who stood at the very top could muster. No matter how much spirit energy one had, it was this very Spirit Ring that would set them apart from the rest. One who could condense a Spirit Ring would be an existence above others.

Even if Qiu Yun was beaten to death, never would he ever have thought that in such a desolate place such as the Middle Realm, he would actually have a chance to see the appearance of a Spirit Ring!

“You... Why would you have... Spirit Ring....” Qiu Yun’s body slumped in despair, it was at this moment that he had completely gone crazy. At first, he thought that she had used some sort of evil technique to control those vines and it had nothing to do with her own abilities. However, at that moment when Jun Wu Xie’s Spirit Ring appeared, Qiu Yun realized how ridiculous his previous thoughts were!

Although he could condense a Spirit Ring as well, but his Spirit Ring was much weaker than hers. There was even a huge disparity on the number of spirit inscriptions condensed out!

This woman was much stronger than him!

Qiu Yun could not believe that with her age, she could actually condense out such a terrifying Spirit Ring.

Who was she exactly!

“Why?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed as she looked at the Spirit Ring on her palm, that faint dark green light was reflected in her eyes and it was like a streak of light that dove into the abyss as she lifted her gaze and said chillingly, “To be able to kill all of you.”

Qiu Yun’s eyes widened and he still wanted to say something but Jun Wu Xie no longer had any interest to look at him. The moment that Qiu Yun had besmirched Jun Wu Yao, it had already spelled his doom. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She slowly raised the Spirit Ring in her hand and flicked her fingertips as it shot straight in the direction of Qiu Yun’s neck at an incredibly fast speed. In the blink of an eye, the Spirit Ring started to rotate around his neck and the vines around him seem to feel the power of the Spirit Ring and quickly receded.

Losing the support of the vines, Qiu Yun immediately fell to the ground due to the immense fear welled up within him. His expression turned sinister and he wanted to reach out to remove the Spirit Ring but just as his fingertips touched the edge of the Spirit Ring, an electrifying pain shocked him and spread throughout his whole body!

“Arghhhh!!!” A blood curdling scream escaped from his mouth as he fell to the ground with convulsions and the Spirit Ring around his neck quickly condensed as it tightened and in a few moments later, streams of purple blood inscriptions started to spread out from where the Spirit Ring was and it was as if something was growing wildly from within his body!
