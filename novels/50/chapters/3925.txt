Yan Hai’s quarters weren’t in the city palace. Every successive city lord wouldn’t live together with their children to avoid being murdered one day, and just by this, we were able to know that how bad was the kinship in the Upper Realm.

Before ten, they might still be allowed to stay in the city palace, but after ten, they would have to move out of the palace.

The moment Jun Wu Xie left the city palace, Jun Wu Yao who was hiding in the dark appeared and both of them straight off headed to Yan Hai’s quarters. Although the City Lord was inwardly guarding against his son, according to the normal standard, the place where Yan Hai lived was still very spacious.

The huge mansion looked really imposing. Jun Wu Xie had just walked to the entrance, the servants in the mansion then came forward and greeted her attentively.

“Young City Lord, you’re back? Are you tired these days?” A group of tall guards stepped forward fawningly, hoping that they were able to leave as much good impression as possible on Yan Hai. Although everyone did not mention it, with the talent Yan Hai got, there was a big possibility that Yan Hai would surpass Yan Wan if he cultivated for ten more years. Since almost all of them assumed that Yan Hai would become the new City Lord of the Sea Spirit City in the upcoming time, they would, of course, put all their efforts in to flatter him.

Jun Wu Xie walked into the mansion with a cold face. After she made those servants leave, both she and Jun Wu Yao stayed in the main hall.

“The relationship between Yan Hai and Yan Wan can’t be described as cold or indifferent anymore, to be more accurate, it should be called a mutual hatred. After you’ve left, Yan Hai’s stepmother keeps on inciting Yan Wan to take action on you.” With a smile hanging on the corners of his lips, Jun Wu Yao sat on a chair. He had been hiding in the dark all the time when they were in the city palace. Even after Jun Wu Xie left, he didn’t leave the place immediately but chose to stay, leading him in being able to eavesdrop on some interesting stories.

“Oh? Take action? What are they going to do?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows, not feeling any surprise at the news. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The gaze of Yan Wan was so cold that there was no way it should be appearing in the eyes of a father. If it wasn’t for the rules of the Upper Realm, that parents weren’t allowed to kill their children whose talents were up to the standard, Yan Wan might probably have already choked Jun Wu Xie to death on the spot.

The rules in the Upper Realm were really weird. It had cut off the relationship between the family members but at the same time, they wanted to raise talented people, resulting them in creating such an order. It could be said that this was the most normal but also the most peculiar rule in the entire Upper Realm. However, it did make sense for them to give out the order, since all the rulers would probably have murdered their talented children at the first instant to prevent themselves getting killed in the future.

As the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City, It was certain that Yan Wan wouldn’t do anything to Yan Hai on the surface, but if it was in the dark...

“Well, it isn’t some smart tricks. They are just going to let you handle some duties of the Sea Spirit City to hold up on your cultivation time. If it’s the cultivation progression of an ordinary person, it’s basically impossible for you to keep up with both sides when you have so many things to deal with,” Jun Wu Yao shrugged. Nevertheless, this was considered a rather obscure way to hinder someone from getting stronger. If it was the real Yan Hai, he could only bite the bullet, but now it was Jun Wu Xie who had taken over his identity.

“Yeah.” The corners of Jun Wu Xie’s lips curved into a faint smile. She was a little upset for not being able to let the Night Regime and the Ghost Army come over faster, if this was really what Yan Wan had decided to do, it would be easier for her to take action.

Yan Wan who was secretly planning to set Jun Wu Xie up did not realize at all that he had indirectly dug himself a grave.
