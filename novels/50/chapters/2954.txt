Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Long Yao’s words made the people in the room go stiff. Nobody could have imagined that standing in that back room were most of the Top Ten Exponents except for Nangong Lie, all six others were present.

These six people held a high status in the Upper Realm with many people looking up to them. However in front of Long Yao, they could only lower their heads in obedience.

Qing Ke stood among them and scanned several people in the group. Just then, Long Yao’s voice thundered through.

“Qing Ke.”

Qing Ke was taken aback but tried to maintain a calm front. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Present.”

“I hear that you did not contribute much?” Long Yao’s voice was as cold as ice.

Qing Ke replied, “The one you sent me to kill, had left already with Yan Hai, so....”

All the Top Ten Exponents, with the exception of Nangong Lie, were assigned a target. Qing Ke’s target was Jun Wu Yao, who had left with Jun Wu Xie. Wherever Jun Wu Xie was, they could not attack.

Furthermore....

Qing Ke himself did not agree with these actions, otherwise he would not have warned Nangong Lie secretly.

“Oh? Is that so?”

Qing Ke felt a shiver run down his spine, but Long Yao turned around and called out: “Fang Jinghe”.

When Long Yao shouted that name, everyone in the room turned to look at Fang Jinghe, who was heavily strapped in bandages. He was supposed to partner with Qing Ke but due to a lack of coordination and Fang Jinghe wanting to take all the credit for himself, he acted alone and found himself in a two on one battle with Rong Ruo and Fei Yan. This mistake had grave consequences for him.

That day, Fang Jinghe had almost lost his life when returning from the street. It was only because his subordinates found him and immediately informed Long Yao, who summoned His Lord’s divine doctor to treat him that he was saved.

Although his injuries were serious, Fang Jinghe still dragged himself there that day and upon hearing his name called, he responded, “Your subordinate is present.”

“You have done well. You are the only one who has met my target, although you only killed one person, it is better than nothing.” Long Yao’s tone relaxed a little.

Fan Jinghe’s face immediately burst into a smile, “It is my honour to fulfill your request. It is a shame that I underestimated my opponents or else the other one would not have escaped.” Although he was being humble verbally, the others in the room could see the pride beaming off his face.

Fang Jinghe ranked lowly within the Top Ten and moreover his entry into the Top Ten was through underhanded means so many in the Top Ten did not hold him in high regard. However he indeed was the only one during this operation to achieve the goal of killing his target and this left a few of them speechless.

“Yes, after this, the ranking of the Top Ten Exponents will be re-evaluated, and I will certainly not forget your credit.” Long Yao promised.

Fang Jinghe could not help but be pleased, if there was not a door separating him from Long Yao, he would have immediately knelt at Long Yao’s feet.
