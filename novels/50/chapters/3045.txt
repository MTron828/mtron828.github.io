3046 The Lost Temples 6

They travelled continuously for two days and only stopped on the third day for a rest when the horses collapsed from exhaustion.

Although the carriage stopped, Chi Yan did not get out and only Qin Qi emerged from the carriage.

Gu Xin Yan still had the same blank expression on her face while the ghoul masked man went to get washed up. They had stopped by the edge of a forest and it was easy to get water and start a fire. Before long, there was a campfire burning.

Jun Wu Xie and the rest were gathered around the fire, eating the provisions they each had brought.

It was a time for socialising yet there was tension in the air. The only one with a smile on his face was Gu Ying.

Su Ruiying held on to her mahogany box and looked frightening as her face was framed by the light from the fire. She lifted her head but dared not to look at Jun Wu Xie, instead she was staring at the person next to Gu Ying, Gu Xin Yan.

“Highness Ying, this is....” Perhaps Su Ruiying could not bear the depressing atmosphere and decided to break the ice.

In fact, there were many rumours about the girl next to Gu Ying. She appeared not long after Gu Ying’s return and always seemed to be by his side. Gu Ying took great care of her but she seemed to be quite cold in return, rarely speaking to him and never once smiling. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yet Gu Ying never lost his temper.

Gu Ying looked at Gu Xin Yan and his smile intensified. He looked at the flames and his feelings seemed to be stoked by them.

“In my life, I only remember three women, Xin Yan being one of them. She has treated me the best out of anyone so I naturally should repay her.” Gu Ying was smiling but his words felt very unnatural to everyone.

Gu Xin Yan’s face was expressionless, as if Gu Ying was talking about someone else altogether.

“Is that so....” Su Ruiying’s mouth twitched. Although Gu Ying had been sincere, she felt embarrassed for some reason and from Gu Xin Yan’s expression, she was totally unmoved as well.

“What are the Lords talking about? Qin Qi appeared just as they were all thinking about returning to their carriages.

Truthfully, although Qin Qi’s looks were not outstanding, he could still be considered relatively good looking. It was just the way he looked at people that made them uncomfortable.

Su Ruiying did not like him but since he was Chi Yan’s man, she had to keep her opinions to herself.

The ghoul masked man knew of Su Ruiying’s feelings but did not want Qin Qi to speak nonsense to Chi Yan so he stepped in, “Nothing much, just casual chit chat. Does Lord Qin want to eat something?”

“Good timing, I’m hungry.” Qin Qi sat down next to the campfire without hesitation but from the moment he sat down, his eyes were fixed on Jun Wu Xie.

The ghoul masked man did not say anything and just took out some food to eat with Qin Qi.

From the time Qin Qi sat down, his eyes never left Jun Wu Xie, no matter what he did and he made no attempt to conceal his actions.
