In her residence, Jun Wu Xie received the news from Ye Sha that Jun Gu had arrived at the Holy Mountain and was received by the Sacred Maiden Tribe. However, Jun Wu Xie, at this moment, was abnormally calm. There was no sense of anxiety within her even with the arrival of Jun Gu.

While Jun Wu Xie was not anxious, someone else was anxious.

Han Shu knocked on the door of Jun Wu Xie’s residence. After Ye Mei brought her in, she immediately came before Jun Wu Xie.

“City Lord Yan.” Han Shu looked at Jun Wu Xie, who was sitting on a chair and had a strange cold light in his eyes.

Jun Wu Xie looked up at Han Shu. Whatever intention Han Shu had regarding her, Jun Wu Xie was very clear, however she didn’t have the slightest idea of how to deal with Han Shu.

What she gathered from Duan Qi and the others, Jun Wu Xie knew that Han Shu and Han ZI Fei were half-sisters. However, they were only half-sisters in name, and their temperaments were vastly different. Han Zi Fei was easy-going and calm, Han Shu, however, was scheming and heavy-minded.

Han Shu looked at Jun Wu Xie. In the past few days, she had wanted to approach Jun Wu Xie countless times. But she was always stopped by Duan Qi for some reason or other, until she did not dare to act rashly. But today, the moment she saw Jun Gu appeared as Han Zi Fei’s fiance, the floodgates of jealousy in her heart burst opened, and she could no longer control it.

Why?

Why were all the good things in the world given to Han Zi Fei?

What was the reason?

Han Zi Fei had clearly betrayed the Sacred Maiden Tribe, betrayed the Lord, and betrayed the Upper Realm. Why was it that she only had to admit her mistake and returned voluntarily, and every seemed to have forgotten her betrayal and accepted her back into the easily?

Even betrothing Jun Gu, one of the Knights of Destruction, to Han Zi Fei?

Han Shu would not be resigned to this!

And her only chance was Jun Wu Xie.

Only by getting Jun Wu Xie to like her, and for her to give birth to the next Sacred Maiden, would she be able to vent out all the things she had suppressed within herself.

Even Han Shu herself didn’t know why she suddenly came to Jun Wu Xie, but when she saw Jun Wu Xie, she understood.

She was unable to forget Jun Wu Xie’s special treatment towards Han Zi Fei at the banquet previously. Today, she wanted Jun Wu Xie to witness with her own eyes how good Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei were together, in order to completely break Jun Wu Xie’s connection to Han Zi Fei.

“City Lord Yan, Lord Jun Gu has just reached the top of Holy Mountain. Now Elder Duan and the others are welcoming him and his party. Before, didn’t City Lord Yan want to get to know Lord Jun Gu? Now would be a good opportunity for City Lord Yan, won’t you come together with mer?” Han Shu tried hard to calmly smile, but the burning in her eyes betrayed her intentions.

Jun Wu Xie glanced lightly at Han Shu, who was constantly snubbed despite showing ‘good’ intentions, how much did this woman desire for power that could make her embarrass herself time and time again without regards to her dignity?

But...

This time, Jun Wu Xie did not intend to embarrass Han Shu any more.

She finally deemed to speak to Han Shu, and said, “Lord Jun Gu is a guest of the Sacred Maiden Tribe, and I am the same. Without the consent of the elders, I will not take the liberty to go, I’m afraid that will be rude.”

Han Shu’s eyes brightened slightly. This was the first time Jun Wu Xie responded to her. Although there was no emotion in her response, Han Shu saw a glimmer of hope. She couldn’t help saying, “The Sacred Maiden Tribe is easy-going and the elders won’t say anything. “
