Chapter 228: “Only for a Gentleman (3)”

A Drunk Lotus who was powerful enough to cause consternation to the indigo spirit user, and Jun Wu Xie’s generous offer of a tempting alternative, had naturally made the strongest among the group, who did not like the Qing Yun Clan anyway, choose to leave.

With both might and strategy, Jun Wu Xie was bringing them down fast.

With the oppressive pressure lifted, the Rui Lin Army who had been rendered immobile rose back on their feet. They encircled the delegates of the Qing Yun Clan and forced them close into the range of the snapping jaws and mauling claws of the fearsome black beast, and the merciless tyrannical and unseen fists of the maniacal Drunk Lotus.

Drunk Lotus went on a terrifying rampage as he did not have to watch his back anymore.

In less than an hour, the four Qing Yun Clan disciples, and the five experts who joined the convoy were dead, pulverized and torn to shreds.

A glaringly red pool of blood on the ground surrounded Drunk Lotus’ feet, and his white clothes were now red. His exceedingly handsome face did not show any disgust or abhorrence, but it instead shone with the exhilaration of the gruesome massacre he had just executed!

“YEAHHH!” Drunk Lotus gave out a low roar of exhilaration as he held his blood smeared fists to his chest and clasped them hidden within his voluminous sleeves. With a light leap, his slender form drew a graceful arc and he landed right in front of Jun Wu Xie.

“Miss, all dead.” Drunk Lotus beamed at her.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. The threat against the Lin Palace had been diffused, but it was far from over. Jun Wu Xie had the injured soldiers carried in to be tended to. As long as they were still breathing, she was confident of saving them.

Jun Xian and Jun Qing’s injuries had not been serious, but Long Qi, who had three ribs broken, and sustained various wounds, had gritted his teeth and had been silent throughout the ordeal.

She then ordered for medicine to stabilize the condition of the wounded to be distributed but did not go back into the Lin Palace herself. She stood at the gates, staring at the bodies of the men of the Qing Yun Clan, her eyes chill as ever.

“Little darling, what’s on your mind?” Jun Wu Yao who had been absent all this while suddenly stood beside Jun Wu Xie.

“You were the one who released Drunk Lotus?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Jun Wu Xie smiled and surveyed the piles of ‘ground meat’ littered across the ground, and his smile widened. “Have you not always wanted to know how strong Drunk Lotus is?” Hence, he had given Drunk Lotus the opportunity.

It seemed, Drunk Lotus’ methods of slaughter, were just right up his alley.

“I am going to the Imperial Palace.” Jun Wu Xie said.

The smile on Jun Wu Yao’s face stiffened.

“That was not all the people from the Qing Yun Clan. Without getting their hands on the Soul Jade, they will not give up. I expect the rest of them, to have confronted Mo Qian Yuan.” Jun Wu Xie reasoned as she narrowed her eyes. From what she gathered from Long Qi, the Qing Yun Clan had attacked yesterday. It would seem that Mo Qian Yuan had fallen into the hands of the Qing Yun Clan for a day now.

What would the naive little Emperor have learnt of the ways of the Qing Yun Clan?

“You want to save him?” Jun Wu Yao raised an eyebrow.

“Yes.”

Jun Wu Yao’s smile faded.....

“I’ll go with you.” A damsel rescuing a distressed dog, what a thankless task.

Jun Wu Xie nodded and issued her orders to the black beast and Drunk Lotus to proceed to the Imperial Palace. When she was done, she was carried up by Jun Wu Yao within his arms and they soared towards the Imperial Palace.

In front of the Lin Palace, the black beast looked in distress at the blood covered Drunk Lotus and the corner of its jaws twitched.

Drunk Lotus looked at the black beast with one eyebrow raised and jumped right onto its back and grabbed a handful of its flesh and fur in his hand. He then laughed coldly: “Dumb kitty! Take me there! Move!”

“..........” The black beast almost teared, feeling so sorry for itself.

Its mistress must never abandon it to this extreme and maniacal flower again!
