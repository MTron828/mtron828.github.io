Not only Luo Qingcheng was shocked, even Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao with widened eyes.

At this moment, Jun Wu Xie seemed to have understood the plan of Jun Wu Yao... From the very beginning, he never thought that he could escape today, all that he had been doing was just to ensure her safety!

Life and death worm....

The existence of this worm could determine one’s life or death, Jun Wu Yao had already expected that the opponent would most likely bring this trump card a long. He knew that he could not escape that was why much earlier before, he had entrusted her to RH. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Words were stuck in her throat, she wanted to shout out and tell him that she would rather die with him them to abandon him but that oppressive pressure was so great and it pressed down on her throat. She could not even utter out a single word, she wanted to get up and rush to his side. She wanted to hold him like how he would to her countless times in the past, but... her injury was too severe and she could not even move an inch!

The feeling of powerlessness was like a huge wave that had crashed onto the shore.

It was at this moment that Jun Wu Xie hated herself for being so weak, she hated her own powerlessness.

If only....

If only she was stronger, and all of these would not proceed to such a step.

An excruciating pain engulfed her heart, she could not help but grit her teeth, as the fresh blood in her mouth stimulated her heart.

Luo Qingcheng took in a deep breath as she forcibly suppressed the urge to kill Jun Wu Xie. At this moment, she could not wait to cut her into a million pieces but under the threat of Jun Wu Yao, she did not dare to.

For the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, Jun Wu Yao was an indispensable sacrifice. If he died, then her Master’s plan would never be realized.

“Alright, I promise you that I would not kill her.” Luo Qingcheng tried to maintain her calm on the surface, “But, if you want to ensure her safety, he would have to put these Soul Binding Chains on yourself. Otherwise, I don’t mind stabbing a few more knives into that little slut’s body.”

As she spoke, she motioned to the black robed men at the side. With a clank, the Soul Binding Chains was immediately thrown and landed at the feet of Jun Wu Yao.

The dark chain that had once kept Jun Wu Yao trapped for a thousand years in that dark cave.

Jun Wu Yao looked at those chains and his gaze shifted to Jun Wu Xie who was lying in a pool of blood.

His Little Xie’er should not have suffered such atrocities, but because of him she had been involved. Jun Wu Yao suddenly laughed as he looked at Jun Wu Xie’s face. The moment he faced her, his smile had turned extremely gentle and doting, that smile was so beautiful. It was as if they were not in a crisis and it was as if there was no one else in the world, only the two of them.

“Don’t....” Jun Wu Xie’s chest was bursting with pain as a strong sense of uneasiness smouldered her. She tried to raise her body up but even with such a slight movement, it made the injury in her chest rapture once again as blood flowed out. Despite spewing out a large mouthful of fresh blood, she forcibly pulled out a silver needle from her waist and immediately pierced her acupuncture points and sealed her pain and gained the last shred of strength.

“Don’t wear it!” Jun Wu Xie stood up in panic, her petite figure looked exceptionally fragile the pool of blood, it was as if she could crumble any moment. She looked at Jun Wu Yao, eyes full of resistance.

He could not wear it.

If he were to put on the Soul Binding Chains, he really would no longer have a sliver of chance left!

Jun Wu Yao smiled at her affectionately, that trail of blood at the age of his mouth made his smile look extremely enchanting.
