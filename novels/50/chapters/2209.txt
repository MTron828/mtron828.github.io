“Good fella, Su Ya did not take you as her disciple wrongly. You’re so heavily injured, why are you still standing there dazed for? Hurry up and tend to your wounds.” Although his words were harsh, his tone was one filled with concern.

Jun Wu Xie took out a bottle of medicine from her Cosmos Sack and passed it to the little old man.

“Disciple has already taken medicine.” This meant that she wanted the little old man to treat his wounds.

Without saying anything, he took the medicine.

The crisis had been lifted and everyone began to get busy tending to the injured. The disciples from the Nine Temples were all busy helping the others after gaining the silent acquiesce from the elders. Until almost everyone had been tended to, Su Jing Yan came forward to bid Jun Wu Xie farewell. The Nine Temples had decided to let this all pass but this itself was also a big risk which was why it was not convenient to stay for too long. After saying a few words to Jun Wu Xie, he then left with the other elders and the disciples of the Nine Temples.

Jun Wu Xie watched them leave without saying anything as she removed the Face of Selvan and began to treat her own wounds.

This was not the place to stay long and after they had tended to all the wounded, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord started to make the necessary preparations to leave. There was the same for Jun Wu Xie and the rest and those that came to specially save the little old man and Su Ya came forward to bid their farewells. They had came together because they wanted to save them, although they could not bear to, they still bade their farewells. After today’s battle, although it was a victory for them, it was won with a lot of sacrifice and blood. Although they did not know who the opponent were exactly, but they knew that they were extremely powerful and could not be provoked. Only after the little old man exchanged a few words with them did they reluctantly leave with tears.

After those people left, a figure quietly came out from the dark.

Before Jun Wu Xie had reacted, she had already fallen into a warm embrace.

“Did you almost lose your cool?” Jun Wu Xie lay dociley in his arms as she snuggled within that warmth. In order to deal with Ba He, her entire body was taut as she fought against him with all she had, both mentally and physically. Now that everything was over, she could finally relax as she had Jun Wu Yao to rely on.

“Mn.” Jun Wu Yao hugged her tightly. He understood her, what she did today was her stubbornness that had brought it through. She wanted to save Su Ya as well as keep him protected him from being exposed. Even though the people from the Upper Realm had all died, however, to keep all that had happened today under wraps would be difficult. Although the Nine Temples had promised to not reveal anything, however as long as the Upper Realm has doubts, all that were involved today would certainly undergo some strict scrutiny. Knowing the malicious methods of the Upper Realm, cruel torture would be involved and no one can be sure that their lips would remain tight after all that. What Jun Wu Xie was protecting Jun Wu Yao from was this aftermath, without him revealing himself, his identity would not be exposed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I was so close to striking out.” Jun Wu Yao said without concealing anything, the situation that unfolded before him had made him lose all reason. If not for Ye Mei’s persistence as well as using Jun Wu Xie’s order as a pretext to calm him down, he was afraid that he would have already struck out the moment much earlier when she had first started battling.

“You can’t strike out this time, you have to believe in me.” Jun Wu Xie looked at him with her eyes half opened. She was exhausted and no longer cared about her entire body that was stained with blood. She only found herself a comfortable position in his arms and rested for a bit.

If Jun Wu Yao were to appear, the situation would have been completely different. She did not wish to let him be embroiled in this because of her and she was not willing to rely on him for every single thing. This would only reinforce her incompetence and weakness. What she wanted to protect, had to be protected with her own hands. This was the same for Su Ya as well as for Jun Wu Yao.

“I believe you, how can I not believe? You did great today.” Jun Wu Yao replied with a doting smile.

“I can’t walk anymore, we should not stay here for long. Bring me away.” Jun Wu Xie said with her eyes closed.
