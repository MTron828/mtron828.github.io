Chapter 2594: Breaking the Seal (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Meng Qiu had not once left the Soul World, but he also knew that to possess a Ring Spirit, it was only in the Lower and Middle Realms. According to rumours, he learned that the people in the Lower and Middle Realm only possessed one Ring Spirit in their lifetimes.

When Jun Wu Xie summoned Blood Velvet, Meng Qiu thought that Blood Velvet was Jun Wu Xie’s only Ring Spirit, but he did not think that with one move, Jun Wu Xie actually had six Ring Spirits!

And these were all very powerful Plant Spirits!

Maybe because the Spirit Tree itself was a Plant Spirit, so the Plant Spirits born from the Spirit Tree were stronger than the spirits of other races. Fortunately, the character of Plant Spirits was happy and calm, choosing to ignore what was around them. They just wanted to find a quiet place to grow, almost not moving for thousands of years.

If those Plant Spirits had similar passions and desires of human spirits, and were willing to cultivate, then the First Spirit Envoy in Soul World would not be Meng Qiu!

When Meng Qiu saw Little Lotus lying on the Spirit Tree, his eyes widened even more!

Among the many Plant Spirits bred by the Spirit Tree, there had been such an unconventional existence; dual soul form cultivation!

A confused and ignorant, timid and feeble, a violent and powerful, superior!

That particular Plant Spirit, at the beginning of his birth, confidently transformed into a human form, and was no different from the human soul. The dual soul made his character more elusive to read. He once became the most troublesome soul in the Soul World. He not only transformed into a human soul but he also cultivated together with many Spirit Envoys, his soul power grew exponentially, such that everyone could only bow before him. If that Plant Spirit was still present, Meng Qiu would not be able to attain the First Spirit Envoy position.

Unless....

The Plant Spirit belief was still unchanged within that Plant Spirit’s heart. In the end, he did not give more thought to becoming even stronger. Instead, he chose to enter Reincarnation Path. If not, it would be very difficult for Meng Qiu to wreak havoc in the Soul World.

However, Meng Qiu did not think that he would see the Plant Spirit again.

However, a certain Plant Spirit who had entered the Reincarnation Path, apparently lost all its memories. Sticking to the Spirit Tree with its naive attitude, just like an octopus.

“Can you start?” Blood Velvet looked at Jun Wu Yao. He wanted to unseal the Spirit Tree this time, and even with his carefree nature, he was still a little nervous.

Jun Wu Yao nodded slightly. The method to erase the Contemporaneous Knot, he had already instructed Blood Velvet and Poison Ivy, the rest was up to them.

In fact, it was not difficult to untie that knot. The only tricky thing was that after the knot enters the soul, it would spread immediately and become fragments throughout the soul. The longer the time spent, the larger the area of ​​diffusion. It would be basically impossible to dispel using a human soul. On the contrary, with a delicate soul like a Plant Spirit, it was easy to deal with those problems.

The thing that Jun Wu Xie was not missing was the Plant Spirits!

Poison Ivy was standing by Meng Qiu’s side. Under the control of the ink snake, Meng Qiu stood rooted in the same place, and Blood Velvet walked to the side of theSpirit Tree, raising his hand and detangling Little Lotus from the Spirit Tree, and threw it towards Poppy.

The two Plant Spirits shared a look as they waited for the most suitable window of opportunity. Only when the two sides were unsealed at the same time could they ensure success!
