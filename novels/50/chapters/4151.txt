Chapter 2747: The Four Knights of Destruction（3）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“This ... Only people of the same level are qualified to contact the Lord Gu...” Nangong Lie relented.

But what he meant, Jun Wu Xie was very clear.

Only by becoming a Knight of Destruction, or by being the suppressor of the top ten exponents, will she have the opportunity to come into contact with Jun Gu.

Having said all that, Nangong Lie closed his eyes resignedly. Perhaps the trauma bestowed by Jun Wu Xie on him was too strong, so much so that he was not at all surprised at Jun Wu Xie’s action in the Upper Realm, it seemed as if she should have been.

Since the beginning of Jun Wu Xie’s efforts to stop the Upper Realm, Nangong Lie knew that Jun Wu Xie’s enemy was not only Luo Qingcheng, but the entire Upper Realm.

However, Nangong Lie waited for a long time, but his death did not come. He closed his eyes and was at a loss, and he suddenly heard the door closing. He opened his eyes but the figure of Jun Wu Xie had already disappeared from before him. All that was left, was the corpse in front of him and the closed door.

Jun Wu Xie did not kill him, she just left.

Nangong Lie sat back on the soft couch ruined, his clothes were soaked with cold sweat.

In the courtyard, Zheng Weilong watched Jun Wu Xie come out of the room, her heart almost leapt out from her throat.

“Master ... Nangong Lie ...” Zheng Weilong said cautiously.

“House arrest.”

Jun Wu Xie spat out these two words and strode out of the courtyard. When she stepped out of the door, the ground beneath her had been stained with blood as the dead bodies paved the way to the main door. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Outside, the fire was burning strongly, the corpses were piled up like a mountain that was being swallowed by the flames.

Ye Mei’s figure suddenly appeared in front of Jun Wu Xie, kneeling on one knee.

“The troops of the five cities have been annihilated, none has fled.” Ye Mei’s voice was calm and undisturbed. In a single sentence, it brought on the deaths of the 30,000 elite soldiers.

Long before Jun Wu Xie came to see Nangong Lie, she had arranged for Ye Mei to eliminate the army of the five cities. Even if Liang Cheng and others screamed themselves hoarse, no one would come to their rescue.

This was a battle of life and death. Jun Wu Xie wanted to live, so her enemy had to die!

Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes swept over burning corpses and simply walked away. The coldness in her eyes did not thaw even with the flames.

Zheng Weilong followed Jun Wu Xie out of the house. Although the journey was short, she felt like she almost exhausted all her energy in her body. She had just stepped out of the door and saw that image of the corpses piled up high like a mountain, as they were being swallowed by the fire. Zheng Weilong’s legs turned soft and she fell over in an instant, fortunately Ah Da appeared in time to help her stabilize.

“Miss.” Ah Da looked at Zheng Weilong’s pale face in anxiety. When the Night Regime fought with the army of the Five City Coalition, he stood by to observe the battle. He clearly saw how devastating the Night Regime was, and how the army of the Five City Coalition could not retaliate. It was with that same crushing force with which Jun Wu Xie destroyed Long Xuan City. The strength of the elite soldier of the five cities was far above the army of Long Xuan City.

However ...

Even so, they were still just a flock of lambs to be slaughtered by the Night Regime.

“He, the Lord of Sea Spirit City ... is truly ruthless. To cooperate with such a person, Miss will you...” Ah Da was a little worried. Before today, Jun Wu Xie did not show any intent to massacre. But death came so suddenly, from the beginning to the end, within a blink of an eye.
