Chapter 225: “Third Slap (7)”

Drunk Lotus’ words, had made the faces of the men from the Qing Yun Clan turn white as sheets. The disciple that was now a pile of mashed up flesh and bones on the ground might not have been their best fighter, but he had the most powerful fists among them. He had prided himself on his mighty fists but those very fists had been utterly crushed and his bones shattered by the youth with a single punch to them! They could not even imagine, just how incredibly strong the youth’s punches were!

All of them possessed at least a green leveled spirit and none of them dared to face up to those fists.

But, Jun Wu Xie’s command had been given. There was nowhere to hide, as Drunk Lotus would not allow that to happen!

Drunk Lotus had turned his eyes on another disciple of the Qing Yun Clan. A chill ran up his spine and he started screaming. “Kill him! Senior Wen! Make your move! NOW!!”

When that man shouted, the skilled indigo spirit user was feeling conflicted. He had no dealings with the Qing Yun Clan before this. He came here against his wishes as he had needed the help of the top clan throughout the lands. He had received an invitation to join the delegation to come to the Kingdom of Qi and had been forced to accept. Hence, when they had faced the Rui Lin Army soldiers, he had not lifted a finger, and only when they were rushed by the Jun Family’s father and son and the Rui Lin Army had he reluctantly made a move and only released his spirit’s oppressive aura to stop an all out attack from their opponents. He had resisted from making a move against the Lin Palace till the last moment, and it was not because he couldn’t, but because he wouldn’t.

For anyone to attain the indigo spirit, they were usually people who were extraordinary in their gift and character.

Having lived close to a century, he had seen and heard much of the world. The righteous reputation of the Jun Family had not escaped his ears either, although their might did not take one’s breath away, their upright and noble integrity had him respect them a lot, and he was extremely reluctant to raise his hand against them.

If the Qing Yun Clan disciples were able to handle the situation on their own, he would just remain a bystander to their atrocities, but the tide had turned, and faced with the joint assault of the black beast and Drunk Lotus, two of the Qing Yun Clan disciples had been killed in a blink. The other invited expert exponents had had to move in and begin their attack on Drunk Lotus and the black beast, but based on the capabilities displayed by the youth and the beast, the answer was clear how this would end.

To make a move, or to refrain?

But, remembering the wounds of a member of his family back home, he sighed in resignation, and turned his eyes on to Jun Wu Xie.

He could see that the one who had command over the youth and the black beast, was this little girl standing in the distance.

“Hand over the Soul Jade and this will end here.” He said to Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie snorted coldly at him, and took a step forward: “You dare harm my family, and smear the Jun Family’s name. This will not end that easily. Today, I proclaim the Qing Yun Clan as my enemies. Not only the Qing Yun Clan people in the Kingdom of Qi will die, soon I will show up myself at the doors of the Qing Yun Clan! And none in Qing Yun Clan will live!”

The indigo spirit user looked in surprise at Jun Wu Xie. He saw her chilly gaze, her determined dominance and could not believe he was seeing all this coming from a little girl! Her proclamation was a mountainous task to undertake, was it even possible!?

Take down the top clan under the skies? The little girl was being rather arrogant!

“Ignorant junior, do you know what you are up against?” The indigo spirit user asked gently.

Jun Wu Xie said coldly: “You should ask that of the Qing Yun Clan. Do they know who they are up against?”

Jun Wu Xie continued: “I saw that you had not made any moves against us. If you leave now, I’ll spare your life. But those who harmed my Grandfather and Uncle, shall leave their lives here.”

The indigo spirit user was taken aback. Not even in his dreams, had he expected that he would one day be threatened by a little girl who had just broken through to the orange level. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

While he stood in astonishment, Drunk Lotus had obliterated and mashed up another disciple of the Qing Yun Clan to a pulp of flesh and bones into the ground!
