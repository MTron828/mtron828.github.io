Chapter 275: Impersonation (1) Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

To Jun Wu Xie, her concept of an alliance, was just something that made things easier for her if available to use, and would not be much of a concern even if she did not make one.

She had initially planned to do everything on her own anyway.

But.....

Did she look like she was..... kidding?

Hua Yao and Qiao Chu exchanged a quick glance and immediately saw the obvious answer in each other’s eyes.

Hua Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie and said: “We can work together, and after we succeed, we have a favour to ask of you.”

“Speak.” Jun Wu Xie was not surprised in the least. Qiao Chu had been enthusiastic all this time, and she did not think that having met just once before, would make Qiao Chu so fiercely protective of her.

“Qiao Chu mentioned that you have a way with producing elixirs, and we would like to ask for your help to produce a certain elixir. We will provide you with the recipe, and we will help to gather the herbs needed. You will only need to complete it from there.” Hua Yao paused before he continued: “We do not demand guaranteed success, but only hope you can give it your best shot. If it is successfully completed, we would be most grateful. But if it happened to fail, we will not force the issue further.”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. Little wonder Qiao Chu had been so protective of her, it seemed like the elixir she had produced in the Ghost City had made Qiao Chu take notice of her.

To have made Hua Yao and Qiao Chu request for it so solemnly, it would not be anything simple or easy. But when Hua Yao had been so upfront about it, she saw no reason to reject him of his request.

Besides, in terms of medicine and the skills involved in elixir production, Jun Wu Xie had utmost confidence in herself.

As long as anyone in this world had successfully produced the elixir before, she did not believe it would be beyond her!

“Alright, you have my word.” Jun Wu Xie agreed without any hesitation.

Qiao Chu’s face broke into a joyous smile, “I knew it! I knew you would agree!”

“.........” Jun Wu Xie looked at Qiao Chu, it was just a fair deal between two parties, excessive emotions would only cloud the mind.

Hua Yao was used to Qiao Chu’s exuberant personality and ignored his outburst, he then proceeded to tell Jun Wu Xie about the Hidden Cloud Peak in detail.

Having been in the Hidden Cloud Peak for a whole month, Hua Yao’s understanding of the Hidden Cloud Peak completely overshadowed Bai Yun Xian’s.

Ke Cang Ju stayed within his own quarters every morning and never stepped out. He would only pass down instructions to the disciples of the Hidden Cloud Peak in the afternoon and only for a short while. He was alone most of the time and even the authentic disciples of the Hidden Cloud Peak did not have much interaction with him. After sundown, Ke Cang Ju would come to this underground chamber, and subject his new recruits to unspeakable torment.

For the youths imprisoned here in this chamber, Ke Cang Ju only saw them as test subjects for his various experiments and research, consisting mainly of feeding poisons and torturing. All kinds of experiments are carried out here daily.

After sundown, the Hidden Cloud Peak turns into a nightmarish hell.

And for those who die from his experiments, would be carted out in the dead of the night by the disciples of the Hidden Cloud Peak and be buried within the herb beds, to lend nourishment to the growing herbs as fertiliser.

After being admitted into the Hidden Cloud Peak, unless they become a genuine disciple under Ke Cang Ju himself, they would not ever leave the Hidden Cloud Peak, not even after they died.

Those people were fated to never leave here alive, the moment they stepped into the Hidden Cloud Peak.

Jun Wu Xie listened intently to Hua Yao, her cold eyes lowered, as she pondered a moment. She suddenly raised her head and looked at Hua Yao to ask: “You can freely control your bones, can you change your body shape and looks?”

Hua Yao was shocked! And he seemed to realise what Jun Wu Xie was asking, but did not seem sure before he nodded.
