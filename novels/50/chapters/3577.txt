He knows! He really knows it! Cold sweat trickled down from his forehead and understanding Jun Wu Yao’s implicit meaning, he did not continue his words.

A hint of suspicion flashed by Jun Wu Xie’s eye. The sentence that Su Jing Yan did not complete made her think of something and she immediately turned to look at Jun Wu Yao, but found that he was also looking back at her with a smile. Under that intense gaze from that pair of violet eyes, she saw her own reflection.

“Little Xie, what else do you want to ask?” Jun Wu Yao asked her with an enchanting smile.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Su Jing Yan and continued to ask him a few more questions.

Su Jing Yan was naturally aware of what should be said and what shouldn’t be mentioned after that.

As she had guessed, Su Ya was indeed locked in the loft of the Spirit Mastery Faculty, but it only had a few levels. He did not know that the thousand Gold Spirits lived there and be it day or night, they guarded her closely.

Jun Wu Xie also asked Su Jing Yan, what was the artifact that the Upper Realm wanted that was in the hands of the little old man, but this point, even Su Jing Yan did not know. In fact, no one even knew the real identity of the little old man.

If it is said that the Dark Emperor’s appearance was very mysterious, then the headmaster of Cloudy Brook Academy wasn’t too far off. He appeared in the Middle Realm earlier than the Nine Temples. The Nine Temple Lords originally had the intention of ruling the entire Middle Realm. However, despite the nine of them joining forces, they still suffered a big loss in the hands of the little old man. They were beaten into a sorry state and they didn’t have the power to fight back. It was because of the very existence of the little old man that the initial ambition of the Nine Temples did not become successful; to rule the Middle Realm under hegemony.

Who was the little old man? No one knows the answer to that. The only thing that is known is that the little old man seem to be guarding the Middle Realm.

Hearing the strength of the little old man, Jun Wu Xie was shocked. One person fighting against nine Gold Spirits... This strength was really heaven defying. She thought that the little old man would be a Gold Spirit, but now it seems to be....

After she asked everything she wanted to know, Jun Wu Xie looked at Su Jing Yan and said: “You can leave now.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Su Jing Yan was taken by surprise. “Are you really letting me leave? Aren’t you afraid that I will tell the Upper Realm about you?”

Jun Wu Xie said: “You wouldn’t.”

Su Jing Yan had on a bewildered expression for a moment but in the blink of an eye, it had turned into a smirk. He raised his hand and touched the small wound on his neck that was cut by the sword of Ye Mei. A complicated gaze fell between Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie.

“Thank you for your trust. Nothing happened tonight.” After that, Su Jing Yan turned and left.

Ye Mei looked towards Jun Wu Yao in an inquiring gaze. Jun Wu Yao simply waved his hand in dismissal and Ye Mei instantly disappeared into the darkness.

In the room, only the two of them were left. Jun Wu Yao seemed to be very interested in Jun Wu Xie’s long hair. He was enthralled by the smooth feeling that lingered at his fingertips as he continued to twirl her hair.

Jun Wu Xie looked at him and her eyes looked more charming under the baptism of the moonlight.

However, Jun Wu Yao fell silent. He didn’t seem to notice her gaze as he just stared at her long hair.

“Wu Yao.” Jun Wu Xie broke the silence.

“Hmm?” Jun Wu Yao casually responded.

“For the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, the outworldly soul that they need is you.” Jun Wu Xie said with affirmation.

A glint of smile flashed by his eyes.

Sure enough, nothing could be hidden from her.

Su Jing Yan’s words had already made Jun Wu Xie aware of the anomaly.
