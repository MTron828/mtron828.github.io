Chapter 1759: “Impossibly Stupid (2)”

Zi Jin fell heavily to the ground, a mouthful of blood immediately spurting out from her mouth. She lay a wretched heap on the ground, her blood stained face slowly being lifted, the tears brimming in her eyes filled with brewing hatred as she stared fixedly at Jun Wu Xie.

“I know that I am not your match, but Jun Wu, your despicable shamelessness would be discovered by people sooner or later. A person like you is not fit to be allied to our Palace Lord!” Zi Jin did not dare to recall, that desolate back of Gu Ying’s, back at the palace hall.

Such a bright and gentle youth, but was forcefully pushed into an irrecoverable state of eternal condemnation by Jun Wu. An insidious mind like this, just send chills running through people.

“Despicable shamelessness?” Jun Wu Xie asked with an eyebrow lifting slightly. She stared at Zi Jin lying on the floor still vomiting blood. Hearing the admonishment coming out from Zi Jin’s mouth, all of a sudden, Jun Wu Xie’s mouth curled up into a smile, and a light laugh spilled out from her mouth.

That laughter, immediately caused Zi Jin to be stunned.

She had never seen Jun Wu laugh. This was the first time.

“Zi Jin, have you forgotten your own identity? Or are you thinking of going back to tell your Palace Lord that because you have fallen for the Young Lord of the Blood Fiend Palace, you did not hesitate for a moment even at the expense of exposing your own identity and that of the Spirit Jade Palace by revealing in betrayal to Gu Ying the plan I told to you?” Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly. Zi Jin’s stupidity, was just too hilarious.

Zi Jin was slightly taken aback.

Jun Wu Xie then said: “Zi Jin, you are a disciple of the Spirit Jade Palace. Do you need me to remind you why the Spirit Jade Palace till this day could only hide themselves in Mount Fu Yao, why the disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace do not even dare to set foot outside into the world? Why all of you must still live your lives hiding in a cave, crawling through an ignoble existence?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As Jun Wu Xie spoke, she stood up from her chair and walked over to come before Zi Jin. She squatted down and then hooked a finger under Zi Jin’s chin to force her head to lift up and look into her eyes.

“How many of your fellow seniors and juniors have the Twelve Palaces already killed? You are now actually telling me that I am despicable and shameless to plot against Gu Ying? I had not known that you are so benevolent that you would show pity to your very own enemy. Hm?” Jun Wu Xie’s voice was very soft, but when it fell into Zi Jin’s ears, it caused her entire body to tremble uncontrollably.

Zi Jin’s lip trembled slightly and she was silent for quite a long while before she stuttered out: “Young Master Gu..... Young Master Gu is not the same!” Upon saying that, Zi Jin bolstered up her courage and slapped Jun Wu’s hand away!

“Young Master Gu is different from the other people from the Twelve Palaces! He is very kind and gentle. Even when he knew my identity, he did not do anything that had harmed me! He had even wanted to protect me, and help me keep the secret!” Zi Jin’s voice continued to rise in pitch. She seemed to be trying to convince Jun Wu, but it was more like she was convincing herself.

Jun Wu’s words had shocked her heart. She had not considered before, that with her revelation of the Spirit Jade Palace before Gu Ying’s eyes, what kind of a calamity it could bring upon their palace. But she did not dare continue on with that thought. She firmly believed that Gu Ying was different. She believed that Gu Ying would definitely not do anything that would harm her and the Spirit Jade Palace.

“Kind? Gentle?” Jun Wu Xie laughed. This was the first time that she was hearing anyone use two such ridiculous terms to describe such a bloodthirsty youth.

“You really should go outside and have a good look around. Do you know why Gu Ying was asked to leave by the Cloudy Brook Academy in the beginning?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

Zi Jin shook her head.

Jun Wu Xie narrowed her eyes and then said: “Because when he was in the Cloudy Brook Academy, he dug out a young girl’s eyes, just because..... he felt that she had a very beautiful pair of eyes.”
