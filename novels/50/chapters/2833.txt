“You know that person well?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Han Zi Fei. From Han Zi Fei’s words and manners, she vaguely felt that Han Zi Fei and the Lord seemed to be familiar.

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie and chuckled: “Do you know who the first two Sacred Maidens were married to? I was supposed to be one of them, but I was lucky as my bloodline was purer, the Lord wanted me to cooperate with him to complete the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms rather than marry me back. Therefore, before I left the Upper Realm, I spent some time with him before. But I’m not that close with him and don’t understand much, all that I know is that he is ... mysterious and perculiar, but one thing is certain, that is his strength. Even if you have a Dual Spirit Ring, bringing him down is not that simple. ”

Han Zi Fei paused and said, “In terms of strength, Ye Jue’s strength back in those days was much higher than the Dual Spirit Ring. But that man has a way to balance this power. I don’t know what he is strong at. But as a whole person, there’s just something strange about him If you want to challenge him, remember that you must be fully prepared or the consequences will be unbearable. ”

Jun Wu Xie remained silent. She had not seen the person yet, but hearing it from someone else, she had a slight idea in her heart. The enemy she was about to face was unprecedentedly powerful. She had to plan and take each step carefully because if anything goes wrong, everything would be lost.

Jun Wu Xie could not afford to lose anything now. If she lost, she would lose not only her own life, but all the souls in the Lower and Middle Realm.

“If you want to become stronger, then use the sacred place of the Sacred Maiden Tribe to cultivate. That person has a special ability to control a person’s will to a certain extent. Your mental strength may be good, but it is not enough to resist him. Your strong psychic force. You must use your mental strength to control his mind before confronting him.” Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie seriously.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head and thought for a moment. She hesitated a little: “Duan Qi asked me to come here for ...”

“I know what they are thinking about, but you don’t have to respond to them so eagerly. After I’ve married, the Sacred Maiden Tribe would have no maidens to take over. You just need to hang this matter in front of them and they can only leave it to fate.” Han Zi Fei raised her eyebrows slightly as a glint flashed by her eyes.

“...” For the first time, Jun Wu Xie found that the gentle and dignified predecessor Zi Fei in the past had such a “lively” side

“Well, it’s late, you should go back to rest first.” Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie with a smile.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head before she turned away. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Looking at the back of Jun Wu Xie’s silhouette, the smile in Han Zi Fei’s eyes became gentler.

After Jun Wu Xie left the premises, she just stood there dazed under the moonlight.

She had come to talk to Han Zi Fei tonight about her marriage with Jun Gu. But..... in the end, they had inevidently talked about the Lord’s affairs instead?

Jun Wu Xie felt that ...

She seemed to have been misled by Han Zi Fei’s words.

However, what Han Zi Fei had said to Jun Wu Xie made sense. She was unable to stop it. If Jun Gu must have a maiden around him, she would prefer the maiden to be Han Zi Fei rather than the woman she saw that time in the Soul World.
