Chapter 2523: Let’s Beat Him at His Own Game (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“If it isn’t for places like this, how would they think of things like the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms?” Fan Zhuo sneered.

After all, the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms was to sacrifice all the living things in the Three Realms. Except for the Upper Realm, no any other one would ever have the guts to think about such insane and lunatic thing.

Fan Zhuo’s words had hit the bottom of everyone’s heart.

“Little Xie, what are you going to do?” Hua Yao raised his eyes and looked at Jun Wu Xie. Until now, Jun Wu Xie’s plan went really smooth, and this was thanks to the coldness and the indifference of the Upper Realm. If they were in the other places, the father might already have noticed the oddness of his son.

“We’ll beat him at his own game.” With a flat tone, Jun Wu Xie said.

There were four purposes of her in coming to the Upper Realm.

First, to search for Jun Gu’s soul in the Soul World.

Second, to find the method to resolve the problem of the chaotic energy in her body.

Third, to destroy the bronze sphere and remove the life and death worn in Jun Wu Yao’s body.

And for the last...

To completely crush the plan of the Upper Realm in carrying out the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms!

Four of these things were the huge rocks that would always be pressing on her heart, bothering her, but she couldn’t be too anxious or act with undue haste. Instead, she must advance gradually and entrench herself at every step she moved. She was in the Upper Realm and even though she had the Night Regime and the Ghost Army beside her, it was still a perilous situation where there was only a narrow door left for her to survive. Once a tiny mistake was carelessly done, they would lose the whole game.

Jun Wu Xie wasn’t in a hurry since there was much time left for her to slowly cope with the Upper Realm. Before she got to spy out the land in the Upper Realm, she wouldn’t do anything reckless.

And for now, her very first goal was to take the Sea Spirit City down!

Once she took over the Sea Spirit City, there would be a place for the Night Regime and the Ghost Army to stay, plus they had the Sea Spirit City as their camouflage, no one else would notice any unusualness. This hidden card was the first key buried by Jun Wu Xie in the Upper Realm!

“I’ll let the ships set off as soon as possible to transfer the people of the Night Regime and the Ghost Army here. Before that, we’ll just have to wait,” said Jun Wu Xie. The more dangerous the place was, the calmer one should remain to be.

“Then... do we need to go and have a look in the Sea Spirit City? I was quite nervous when we arrived here, I didn’t have the chance to get a good look in the city.” Qiao Chu scratched on his head.

“Just go if you want to, I’m not going to look at this broken place.” Fei Yan curled his lips. Was there anything worth seeing in this inhuman place?

“Let’s go and have a look. We might find something new,” said Rong Ruo all of a sudden.

“If Little Ruo wants to go, then I’ll go with you.” Without hesitating, Fei Yan changed his opinion. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Unreservedly, Qiao Chu threw an antipathetic glare at Fei Yan.

“Be careful then.” Jun Wu Xie stood up and her gaze fell onto Jun Wu Yao who was at the side.

“Do you want to go to the workshop with me?”

The workshop of the Sea Spirit City, a place where it had the thickest smell of blood in it.

Jun Wu Yao gave out a chuckle as he stood up.

“Sure.”

“Ah ah ah! Can we join you?” The moment Qiao Chu heard that Jun Wu Xie was going to the workshop, he immediately perked up. Compared to the streets and alleys in the city, they were more attracted to the workshop.

Jun Wu Xie nodded.

At the instant, everyone had decided to visit the workshop first. After they left Yan Hai’s quarters, a figure that was hiding in the dark immediately ran back to the city palace and report all the movements of Jun Wu Xie and the others to Yan Wan.

“He wasn’t complaining at all? This is rare.” After Yan Wan received the news brought by the steward and the surveillant, he couldn’t help himself from getting a little confused. The way Yan Hai reacted today had truly gone beyond his expectation, causing the methods that he had prepared before this in order to deal with him to turn into a waste.
