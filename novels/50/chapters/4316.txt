Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Just as Bai Mo’s Spirit RIng was about to hit Nangong Lie, Nangong Lie disappeared in an instant. That speed at which he did so was beyond what Bai Mo could reach.

For a moment, Bai Mo was stunned and stopped all his attacks.

The entire street, however, exuded a strange calm.

Nangong Lie landed ten steps away from Bai Mo, but his face was pale as he gasped for breaths. He had felt death coming at him, but...

On Nangong Lie’s shoulder, there was a distinct hand resting on it, and it was the same hand which had dragged him out from the abyss of death.

No one expected that in the battle between the two Spirit Ring powerhouses, there would be someone who was able to intervene, and everyone’s eyes were instantly turned towards the man standing behind Nangong Lie.

This glance stopped everyone on the street.

Standing behind Nangong Lie was a young boy with a beautiful face, and a cold stare like a star immersed in a cold pond. No one knew when he appeared as he stood there silently.

“It’s you?” Nangong Lie looked at the teenager behind him with amazement and surprise in his eyes.

The boy glanced at him and nodded slightly.

Bai Mo stared at the young man who appeared suddenly. His immature face was overcast with a dark shadow. The boy was unfamiliar to him and what made Bai Mo startled was that he was unable to detect the slightest trace of strength from this boy!

This discovery made Bai Mo’s killing intent disappear in an instant. With his current strength, there were only a few people whom he could not detect their spiritual powers. Unless, this person’s spiritual strength was more than double of his!

But Bai Mo found it hard to believe that the young boy standing in front of him really had that ability.

“Who are you?” Bai Mo narrowed his eyes and looked at the young man standing behind Nangong Lie.

Had the young man not intervened, he would surely have killed Nangong Lie in one blow!

The boy just looked at Bai Mo calmly as he stepped forward slightly. The thin body blocked Nangong Lie from Bai Mo.

“I’m the one whom you said colluded with Nangong Lie.” The young boy said coldly.

When his words reached the ears of the onlookers, they were all stunned but managed to regain their sense. Those who came from the 72 cities, after seeing the appearance of the boy, took a gulp of air.... VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yan Hai!”

“Overlord Yan Hai!”

“Overlord!”

Proclamations were sounded, one after another, the honorable title that the only person within the 72 cities had managed to uphold after thousands of years – thus revealing the identity of the young man and making Bai Mo’s expression sour in an instant.

“You are Yan Hai?” Bai Mo looked at the young man in surprise, however the shock within his heart had surpassed the others.

Bai Mo had lived in seclusion for a long time, and has only begun to go out in recent months. This time, he came for the selection of the top ten exponents. He had also heard that there were a lot of things happening in the Upper Realm. Among them, the most obvious was Yan Hai, the City Lord of Sea Spirit City who has overwhelmed the 72 cities and possessed an unsurpassed strength of Dual Spirit Rings!

When Bai Mo heard this news, he thought it was a joke. From the ancient times till now, there have been so many geniuses in the Upper Realm, but even at their peak, they could only cultivate a single Spirit Ring in their lifetimes.
