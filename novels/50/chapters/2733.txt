Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Although Zheng Weilong couldn’t figure out the ultimate purpose of Jun Wu Xie, she could vaguely guessed that Jun Wu Xie wanted the position of overlord of 72 cities. This idea might be egotistical, but for some reason, she always felt that Jun Wu Xie would be able to do so.

“In that case, let them in.” Rong Ruo nodded slightly.

Ye Sha heard this, and suddenly said: “In addition to the people from the five cities, I’ve discovered a particular person.”

“Who?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“Nangong Lie.” Ye Sha said.

Jun Wu Xie quirked her brow slightly upon hearing the name... she was not unfamiliar with that name...

As soon as she heard Ye Sha, Zheng Weilong, who was originally unperturbed, slightly paled as she looked at Jun Wu Xie, “City Lord, that Nangong Lie is one of the top ten exponents. He is also young and full of potential, he is the son of Blazing Flame City’s lord, Nangong Yan. I believe this time, Nangong Yan requested his presence... If a person like this is leading the troops, then My Lord, please make adjustments to your place. Nangong Lie is very strong. If you let him enter the city and if he were to find the slightest anomaly, I’m afraid ... ”

Zheng Weilong was in a mess, the appearance of Nangong Lie was really unexpected.

However, contrary to Zheng Weilong’s nervous look, Qiao Chu and others, who were sitting aside, all had strangely weird expressions. There was no tension on their faces, and they looked as if they were hiding their smiles.

Looking into those pairs of eyes, Zheng Weilong had a vague feeling that something was wrong, but she could not pinpoint what it was.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Zheng Weilong’s cautious look and knew that her caution was not wrong, but there was one thing that Zheng Weilong didn’t know.

The top ten exponents who were so powerful in the eyes of the Upper Realm, but to her ...

“Follow the plan.” Jun Wu Xie lifted her hand and settled the matter directly.

Zheng Weilong had wanted to say something else, but could only remain silent.

Qiao Chu and others were shocked by Zheng Weilong’s intelligence before, now wanted to laugh. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

No matter how clever Zheng Weilong was, she wouldn’t have realized that the powerful Nangong Lie was just a bereavement dog that was beaten by Jun Wu Xie in the past. The reason why he could save his life and escaped back to the Upper Realm was because Jun Wu Xie was magnanimous.

Everyone could remember how much fear Nangong Lie had as he looked at Jun Wu Xie. Qiao Chu and the others couldn’t help but look forward to when Nangong Lie saw Jun Wu Xie this time. They wondered how he would react...

Soon, Ye Sha sent someone to pass the message, and Liu Yi and others were not surprised when they received the message.

“Like I said, how powerful could this Sea Spirit City be. They just rely on some unexpectedly acquired treasures to oppress those weaker cities. No matter how courageous they are, they still dare to oppose us?” Resolute City’s Liang Cheng pursed his lips. He was warlike by nature, and he was the first to propose a direct war. If Nangong Lie didn’t agree, he would have brought people raze Sea Spirit City to the ground.

In his eyes, no matter how much the Sea Spirit City changed, it still wouldn’t be able to get it of its fate of a lowly, good-for-nothing fate.

“Brother Liang’s words are extremely true, but since Sea Spirit City is so aware of the current situation, why should we waste our energy? It is beneath Master Nangong to attack such garbage. If they can surrender the item obediently, it is a wise choice. “Liu Yi chuckled.
