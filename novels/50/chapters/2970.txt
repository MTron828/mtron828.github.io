Chapter 2971 I want to challenge six of them 1

Only one person, as usual, calmly responded to Jun Wu Xie’s gaze.

Jun Wu Xie soon knew that the man must be Qing Ke who had previously sent a letter to Nangong Lie. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She won’t touch Qing Ke, but the others here ...

In her mind, the sorrow of Fei Yan, the despair of Qiao Chu, and the sleepless Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo, echoed like a nightmare in Jun Wu Xie’s mind.

Her cold eyes swept through the five people who were present. The killing intent in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes was no longer disguised. Just by looking at her eyes, Fang Jinghe was frightened to the point of collapse and the rest could not wait to slip away.

“Lord Long Yao, do I only have one match to challenge the Top Ten Experts?”

Long Yao said, “Yes.”

He would like to see how Jun Wu Xie would make this choice.

Jun Wu Xie did not speak directly. She turned around and jumped from the high platform, returned to the empty ring platform, and returned to the sight of the crowd. At this moment, without cheers and applause from the onlookers on the field, Although there were no close-up crowds, they could already see what was happening there.

And that scene, no one wished to experience it again.

The people of the White Night City had already escaped from the game collectively when Bai Zhu had vanished. Obviously they did not understand how their City Lord had offended Jun Wu Xie.

Didn’t they see that even Lord Long Yao could not keep him checked?

People in White Night City dare not to stay longer. They could only blame their parents for not giving them two more legs. From this day on, White Night City, one of the strongest cities among the 72 cities, was set to decline.

At this moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on Jun Wu Xie. Everyone had seen Jun Wu Xie’s manner of killing Bai Zhu. That fear was transmitted to everyone present. But they did not ignore Long Yao’s ugly face who was seated at the high post as well.

Jun Wu Xie killed Bai Zhu in front of Long Yao. Although Long Yao didn’t stop him, any fool could tell that Bai Zhu was following Long Yao. This was why Jun Wuxie dared to fight Long Yao. She was slapping his face. The contradiction between the two would be difficult to resolve.

People in the arena trembled. No matter whether they were Jun Wu Xie or Long Yao, they were not the ones they could provoke. In the battle of dragons and tigers, they could only watch.

“Lord Long Yao.” Jun Wu Xie stood on the ring and looked at Long Yao.

Long Yao narrowed his eyes.

“In the next game, I want to challenge the six players from the Ten Top Experts who are present.” Jun Wu Xie said arrogantly.

What!

Jun Wu Xie’s words plunged the entire stadium into shock. The selection contest of the Top Ten Experts had always only been an example of one challenger challenging one of the Top Ten Experts. Only one player must be defeated to enter the Top Ten Experts. If you want to rise within the top ten, you need to fight alone.

Throughout the ages, no one had ever asked for six opponents!

Everyone knew that Luo Qingcheng, the head of the Top Ten Experts, went with the other two people to perform the task. She had not returned yet. Today, it would be a fierce fight. Now there were only seven people left in the so-called top ten. Except for the good relationship between Nangong Lie and Jun Wu Xie, she had singled out all ten masters!
