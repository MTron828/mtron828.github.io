Chapter 2229: Top Ten Experts（2）

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Ren Huang puffed up his chest proudly.

“Hmm.” Jun Wu Yao sneered.

Ren Huang wrinkled his nose and said, “I am too lazy to compare with a monster like you. I am talking serious things with my grand disciple now, stop interrupting.” After saying that, Ren Huang even waved his hand in dismissal towards Jun Wu Yao.

Such a casual action made the Spirit Jade Palace who was at the side swallow a large mouthful of saliva. He dared to swear that if Ren Huang was not Jun Wu Xie’s Grandmaster, Jun Wu Yao would definitely have slapped him with the palm of his hand!

“Little Wu Xie ah, the strength of the Upper Realm is determined by the number of spirit inscriptions. And there are only eleven people who can form a Spirit Ring. Out of these eleven people, ten of them are called the top ten experts. Your Grandmaster here is one of them.” Ren Huang completely ignored Jun Wu Yao’s gaze as he seriously boasted to Jun Wu Xie about his own great achievements.

“Eleven people? If that’s the case, why are only ten people ranked?” Jun Wu Xie could not understand as she asked.

Ren Huang’s expression changed slightly, as his eyes involuntarily glanced at Jun Wu Yao. Seeing that there was no abnormality in Jun Wu Yao’s expression, he whispered: “There are eleven people who can condense a Spirit Ring but among them, there is one who can condense a double Spirit Ring.

“Double Spirit Ring?” After experiencing the difficulty of condensing the spirit inscription, Jun Wu Xie felt shocked at this notion.

In the entire Upper Realm, where it was filled with Gold Spirits, to be able to condense out a Spirit Ring were only eleven people, this showed how rare and how hard it was to condense one out. And yet, that person not only condensed one Spirit Ring, but two! This was really startling.

Ren Huang continued on: “That’s right, that person dominates the Upper Realm, the plan of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms was also proposed by him. That person is no longer like a human any more, he could be said to have stepped one foot in the Realm of Gods. I can also tell you that if the ten experts join hands together to go against him, I’m afraid that they would suffer losses instead.”

The top ten experts teaming up, which means that ten people with the same strength as Ren Huang combining that monstrous power to attack... After personally witnessing Ren Huang’s strength, Jun Wu Xie found it hard to even fathom how powerful the person with the double Spirit Ring was.

Subconsciously, her eyes fell on to Jun Wu Yao. He had said that his strength was only one tenth of his peak, but even so, she could feel Jun Wu Yao’s strength now was stronger than Ren Huang. She did not know if that if compared to that person who has the double Spirit Ring....

Jun Wu Yao looked back at Jun Wu Xie but he did not say anything.

Ren Huang said: “They have never fought against each other before, once this fella here started wreaking havoc in the Middle Realm, that person could see how terrible this guy’s power is. That person is not a fool, he did not dare to provoke him and was quite courteous to him.”

If it was Jun Wu Yao at his peak and that person with the double Spirit Ring, it would definitely be a battle to behold.

“If you want to destroy the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, you will face off with him sooner or later, however before that it is imperative that you kill off other nine people of the top ten experts...”

That person commanded the entire Upper Realm and only Jun Wu Yao was the special case who was not constrained by him. Even Ren Huang that year was suppressed totally by that person and when he uncovered the plot of the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, he could no longer bear the condemnation of his conscience and could only steal the soul bone and flee from the Upper Realm.

If Jun Wu Xie wanted to put an end to the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, what Jun Wu Xie would need to contend against wasn’t just one or two people but she would be up against the entire Upper Realm!
