Chapter 2665: Believe It Or Not, It’s Up To You (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The voice of the majordomo suddenly came into his ears.

“There’s where the Young Miss of the Discerning Moon City staying at, you know that it’s inappropriate for you to look indecently at it, right?”

Stiffened, Xu Zu quickly moved his head lower, not having the courage to take one more glimpse at it.

Soon, Xu Zu was brought to the study room of Ruan Chongshan. After the majordomo knocked on the door and announce their arrival, a low and heavy voice was then heard from the room.

“Come in.”

After nodding his head at the majordomo, Xu Zu pushed open the door and entered the room.

Inside the study room, there was a middle-aged man who seemed to be in his early forties sitting solemnly at the table. His face projected an aura of dignity. By looking at the corners of his lips that were slightly sagging, it could be told that the man had an irritable personality. He was just simply sitting behind the table, but his broad shoulders had still manage to give out a strong sense of oppression.

Xu Zu walked towards the table with great trepidation and kneeled down on one of his knees as he spoke, “Your subordinate has come to meet the City Lord.”

“Hum,” Ruan Chongshan responded.

“Have you settled the matter of the Sea Spirit City?” asked Ruan Chongshan.

A sign of embarrassment was shown on Xu Zu’s face, “It’s your subordinate’s inability as we have failed to settle the matter of the Sea Spirit City.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“You trash! You couldn’t even handle such simple things.” The expression on the face of Ruan Chongshan immediately turned darker.

With a shudder from his body, Xu Zu quickly explained, “It’s not that your subordinate did not put the effort into the matter, it’s just that... the situation of the Sea Spirit City is much different now.”

“Oh? Why is it?”

“Following the instructions given by the City Lord, we had gone to the Sea Spirit City to request for the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast. After staying in the city for several days, the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City still refused to show up. It was until a few days longer that we were allowed to meet him. However, the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City has already been replaced by another person. The City Lord of the Sea Spirit City is no longer Yan Wan, but his son, Yan Hai,” said Xu Zu.

“Yan Hai?” Ruan Chongshan raised his eyebrows, “Though Yan Wan isn’t really that strong, he is very vicious and cunning. His son too, doesn’t seem to be someone who can make it big, how could he take over the position of the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City in such a short time?”

It wasn’t a rare thing for the replacement of the City Lords of the seventy-two cities to occur in the Upper Realm. Under the temptation of power and influence, there was no one expert who didn’t want to climb up to the position of the City Lord. There were usually some symptoms shown before things like these happened, but for the Sea Spirit City, it happened so suddenly.

“Your subordinate has no idea about the details, but it is definitely true that Yan Hai is now ruling the Sea Spirit City.”

“But what does it have to do with the resources of the Sea Spirit Beasts even if the City Lord has changed?” Ruan Chongshan didn’t really care about who was the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City as he had always turned his nose up at the city. The thing that he cared more about was the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast.

When the conversation came to this topic, Xu Zu’s face turned even paler.

“Yan Hai said... that from now onwards, the Sea Spirit City will not provide any resources of the Sea Spirit Beast to other cities.”

“What?!” There finally appeared a trace of astonishment on Ruan Chongshan’s face, “He will not provide the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast anymore? Is that guy crazy?”

Ever since the Sea Spirit Beast was established, supplying the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast to other cities had become the primary factor for the Sea Spirit City to gain a foothold in the Upper Realm. Had the brat who had just succeeded to the post gotten farts in his head? He had actually spoken such an utterance.

“Your subordinate too, thinks that Yan Hai is too arrogant and ignorant. Hence, before coming back, your subordinate has specially asked a group of people from the Sea Spirit City about this matter, and we have found out that after taking over the Sea Spirit City, Yan Hai has made a rather big movement...”

Xu Zu told all the information that he had “found” in the Sea Spirit City to Ruan Chongshan without missing any details. As time passed, the expression of Ruan Chongshan became more and more serious.
