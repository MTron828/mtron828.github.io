Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The loud thundering sound almost shattered everyone’s eardrums. Up in the sky, a thick black colour was like a sea of dark clouds, spreading through the sky all the way to the horizon.

A feeling of uneasiness appeared in Wei Ya’s mind without any reason.

Suddenly, the earth was shaking violently. Just like the fog, a white halo oozed out of the soil, slowly pervading into the air.

The white halo which appeared all of a sudden had blocked the way of the army from the Upper Realm who were all roaring to march forward. Subconsciously, they stopped their march and remained alert while looking at the strange scene in front of them.

A strange view suddenly appeared among the army of the Upper Realm. The armies who were all once valiant and high-spirited were suddenly behaving like a drenched chicken that had been standing in the rainstorm, an unusual paleness appeared on every one of their faces.

“What’s going on?” Carrying Luo Qingcheng, Xie Changming staring astonishingly at all the things that had happened in front of him with both his eyes and mouth wide opening. Not realizing why, an extremely strange phenomenon arose in the army behind him.

Those golden spirit lights that were first embracing the soldiers were fading away in a very fast speed, as if they were, bit by bit, unwittingly swallowed by the white halo that was coming out of the ground!

Even Xie Changming felt a little uncomfortable. The spirit energy inside his body seemed to be pulled out by some kind of energy, causing his energy to keep reducing. The condition of his energy withering had made the face of Xie Changming to turn pale at that moment. The terror that Xie Changming had never experienced before emerged from the bottom of his eyes.

How could this be?

Wei Ya had also noticed the abnormality that had been occurring. The light of the Spirit Ring on his hand was getting weaker quickly. He was able to clearly feel that the spirit energy in his body was disappearing frantically!

The assault from the army of the Upper Realm stopped abruptly. Qiao Chu and the others who were already getting ready to fight were stunned after seeing this scene. Since they were now at the level of the Gold Spirit, of course they were able to notice the decreasing power of the army of the Upper Realm.

The situation of all their powers decreasing was so weird that it was actually unbelievable!

And the thing that Qiao Chu and the rest of them were more curious about was that there was no sign of their spirit energy being attenuated. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

What had Jun Wu Xie done?

There was a huge question wandering in everyone’s mind.

At this moment, a figure intruded into the battlefield and stood beside Jun Wu Xie.

“Young Miss, the array is functioning.” The figure of Ye Sha appeared beside Jun Wu Xie with a trace of seriousness on his cool face.

Jun Wu Xie slightly nodded her head. The stare she gave to Wei Ya was as cold as the snow.

“What... What have you done?!” Even if Wei Ya was an idiot, he was still able to tell that whatever that was happening must be related with Jun Wu Xie. The decreasing strength of the people from the Upper Realm was simply unbelievable but he couldn’t really think of the method used by Jun Wu Xie to create such a terrible situation!

The environment of the Lower Realm wasn’t suitable for the people from the Upper Realm to stay for a long time. Everyone from the Upper Realm knew about that. However, the influence of the environment was still unlikely to deplete their energy in such a horrible way in this short time. This had already far gone beyond the normal range!

The array?

What was the array mentioned by Ye Sha?

Wei Ya was overwhelmed with a great fear. He could vaguely realize that the moment they stepped into the Lower Realm, it seemed like they had already walked into the trap that was set up by Jun Wu Xie beforehand.

While gazing at Wei Ya coldly, Jun Wu Xie slowly spoke in a calm and determined voice. “What goes around comes around. I just want to tell you, that even if you guys are from the Upper Realm, but for now, the ground you are stepping on is the ground of the Lower Realm!”
