Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Soon after Su Ya had recovered her spirits, she had learned that her delicate little disciple turned out to be a beautiful girl. This had shocked her greatly, when they had first met at Cloudy Brook Academy, they had spent most of their time together but she could not even see through the disguise of Jun Wu Xie. She did not know if it was she herself who had failed in observing that or it was that Jun Wu Xie had disguised herself too well. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jun Wu Xie touched the tip of her nose awkwardly, she had no intention to conceal that from Su Ya, at the time it was imperative to do so to avoid the Twelve Palaces as well as for the ease of movement.

“Alright, if you are going to be so fierce again, this would scare dear disciple.” Yan Bu Gui saw that his own woman was deliberately provoking his disciple and could not help but speak out.

“This is my disciple!” She raised her eyebrow.

Yan Bu Gui was speechless.

What she was protective about was that deep fear that he would rob her of her disciple...

He was obviously the first one to accept this disciple...

“You are also my disciple.” Su Ya harrumphed.

“Yes, Master...” Yan Bu Gui answered wryly but his heart was filled with joy. Today, Su Ya had already reverted back to her usual temperament and this meant that for the rest to recover, it was only a matter of time.

“Good disciple...”

Yan Bu Gui and Su Ya had staged such an affectionate scene in front of Jun Wu Xie that Jun Wu Xie quickly changed the medicine of Su Ya and left in a hurry.

If it was Qiao Chu and the rest, they would laugh on the spot. Only the heavens knew that each time Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao displayed affection in front of them, how much trauma to their frail hearts were inflicted?

The moment Jun Wu Xie stepped out of Su Ya’s tent, she saw the Spirit Jade Palace Lord standing outside while trembling. Ye Mei was holding on to Lord Meh Meh in a distance of approximately ten steps away from him. The expression on the Spirit Jade Palace Lord was one filled with resentment, it was as if he had suffered a great grievance. Rather, it was Ye Mei who was at a loss as he carried Lord Meh Meh in a stupor.

If others did not know, they would think that Ye Mei had given something to Spirit Jade Palace Lord.

“The two of you...?” Jun Wu Xie asked.

“I... I came because ...I wanted to ask if those disciple of mine are able to make the journey three days later. I... I shall return to the tent first to wait for you.” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s voice was trembling slightly and his pair of eyes was watching Ye Mei who was standing at the side with vigilance.

The moment he finished speaking, he turned and rushed back to his own tent.

Jun Wu Xie and Ye Mei looked at each other and Ye Mei immediately retorted: “I did not do anything!!”

It was only because Lord Meh Meh had wanted to see Jun Wu Xie, which was why he had carried it here to find her. However, he did not expect to see the Spirit Jade Palace Lord standing outside Su Ya’s tent. Before he could even say anything, the moment Spirit Jade Palace Lord saw him, it was as if he had seen a ghost and wailed loudly before he hugged his own shoulders and stood warily at one corner.

Ye Mei was scared by his reaction, and stood there dumbfounded.

Jun Wu Xie immediately understood what the reason was.

It was a relapse of the Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s old sickness.

Towards the fear of men, it had made the Spirit Jade Palace Lord almost not leave the Spirit Jade Palace at all. This time, in order to save Su Ya, he had brought forth a large force because of the urgent situation at hand. His ‘sickness’ was much better, however once the crisis had been lifted...it relapsed again.

In the entire campsite, there were only a handful of men. Yan Bu Gui was by Su Ya’s side taking care of her and did not leave at all. Jun Wu Yao did not appear much other than at Jun Wu Xie’s side. Ren Huang and the Spirit Jade Palace Lord were old acquaintances and there were certain ‘antibodies’ that had been built up.
