“Jun Wu Xie is just some shitty woman. I will not believe that a hillbilly from the Lower Realm is able to win over the Upper Realm. If it’s true, then wouldn’t us Upper Realm just become a joke? Because of Nangong Lie’s carelessness, he was defeated, that’s fine. But the way he made up stories to deceive everybody just for him to clear his name, I think it’s extremely embarrassing for him to continue to stay in the Upper Realm, and there is His Lord who still decided to spare his life, what is he thinking about?” The more Xie Chang Ming said, the angrier he got.

A Spirit Ring coming out from the Lower Realm?

Stop kidding!

Even if it was in the Upper Realm, the number of people who were able to condense the Spirit Ring could be just reckoned up on the fingers of one hand. If a barren place like the Lower Realm was able to produce an expert of the Spirit Ring, then wouldn’t people like them who were from the Upper Realm feel really ashamed of themselves?

“Soon we will find it out whether or not it is true. It doesn’t matter if it is true that Nangong Lie was defeated by Jun Wu Xie, this time we are going to teach the bold woman Jun Wu Xie a lesson. Whoever tries to challenge the Upper Realm shall die.” Wei Ya’s eyes slightly narrowed. He had the similar thought with Xie Chang Ming.

The spirit energy in the Lower Realm was so low that it was almost unfeelable. How would a place like this is able to train an expert who is able to condense the Spirit Ring? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Oh, right, I have heard before that even a Purple Spirit is considered as a super rare top expert in the Lower Realm. I’m really curious. How stupid can Jun Wu Xie be for her to attempt to fight against us with the power of the Lower Realm? Is she really going to let the rubbish which is not even up to the standard of the Purple Spirit to drown us with their saliva? Hahaha...” Xie Chang Ming laughed out loud without any scruple. For them, the weakness of a Purple Spirit was pathetic like an ant. If one person was willing to grind hundreds or thousands of ants to death, wasn’t it just as simple as moving one’s fingers?

Wei Ya let out a small laugh. “Chang Ming, you’re joking again. The people in the Lower Realm even think that a Purple Spirit is very valuable, how will they ever know the strength of a Gold Spirit? They think that the battle is all about the gap of the quantity, but they never realize that it is actually the disparity in the strength.”

“Ha? Are you saying that they think the Gold Spirit is just the same as the Purple Spirit?” Pretending to be shocked, Xie Chang Ming said.

Wei Ya shrugged his shoulders and said. “Are you expecting those rubbish that has never left the Lower Realm to understand the power of the Upper Realm? They were just a bunch of frogs living at the bottom of the well.”

Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya echoed with each other while belittling the Lower Realm like there was no one thing in the Lower Realm is nice. In reality, even though Nangong Lie returned with a fiasco, the Upper Realm had never thought that there would be any power in the Three Realms that was able to threaten them. Nangong Lie’s statement was more like a self-exoneration to Xie Chang Ming and the rest of them. They were more willing to believe that it was actually Nangong Lie’s stupidity that had caused him to fall into Jun Wu Xie’s trap and end up in a complete failure.

If somebody told them that the power of Jun Wu Xie and the Night Regime was able to destroy the hundred thousand forces from the Upper Realm directly, they would not believe it even if they were beaten to death.

“I guess so. If it is true that Jun Wu Xie is that powerful, what’s the point of her being so mysterious and even shift the battlefield to the Lower Realm? Now think about it, it’s just a method to buy them some time.” Xie Chang Ming sneered. Though he hadn’t met Jun Wu Xie, there was already a timid and cunning bitch image of her formed in his brain.

“Wait until I meet this Jun Wu Xie, I am surely going to slash her head off with my own hands and bring it back to the Upper Realm to let Nangong Lie the idiot have a clear look. I want to let him know that what is the actual meaning of being strong.”
