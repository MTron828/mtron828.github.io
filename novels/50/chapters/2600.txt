Chapter 2601: The Spirit Tree (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie blinked her eyes gently, the feeling was very subtle, but she did not reject it.

After experiencing betrayal and being sealed, the Spirit Tree was still so peaceful, and could also say words of welcome. It really made Jun Wu Xie highly respect the Spirit Tree who was the source of all souls look like a sinless. What Long Jiu and others considered as its benevolence and love, there was really no exaggeration in thinking that way.

The other vine of the Spirit Tree had been lifted up, and headed towards Jun Wu Yao. Jun Wu Yao saw the hint of laughter in Jun Wu Xie’s eyes and realised that this little guy did not reject the Spirit Tree. And so was unperturbed in having contact with the only “friend” in the Three Realms.

“You are back, but you have changed a lot. It is a good thing.” The voice of the Spirit Tree echoed in the mind of Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Wu Yao laughed lightly, he knew that he had changed. He no longer was the cold-blooded, ruthless Ye Jue. Today, he had changed because of her, he only belonged to her.

“I haven’t seen you for many years, but you haven’t changed, just...the Soul World has changed a lot.” Jun Wu Yao slowly opened his mouth and responded to the greetings of the Spirit Tree.

Although the Spirit Tree couldn’t speak, it could use those vines to establish a spiritual connection with the soul body, but it did so rarely. Today, it actually made contact with him and Jun Wu Xie, it was indeed rarely seen.

When Jun Wu Yao roamed the Soul World for hundreds of years, the Spirit Tree had just “said” five sentences to him.

As Jun Wu Yao spoke, his eyes fell on Meng Qiu who had collapsed on the ground.

After the release of the Contemporaneous Knot, Meng Qiu was subjected to a huge counter-attack. As the caster of the seal, after the Contemporaneous Knot was destroyed, his soul would suffer devastating damage. At this moment, Meng Qiu’s soul was wasting away an extremely fast speed. The power that had once made him the top Spirit Envoy was gradually slipping away. The anti-phago effect of the Contemporaneous Knot will increase or decrease according to the strength of the caster. The power of the Spirit Tree was beyond doubt. This counter-attack was enough to make Meng Qiu’s soul scatter.

Meng Qiu’s soul had become very unstable. Even if Jun Wu Yao was not controlling, he could not stand up and could only sit on the ground with shivering.

The Spirit Tree felt the gaze of Jun Wu Yao, and a sigh travelled into the ears of Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

The long vine slowly extended to Meng Qiu, Meng Qiu’s shaking became more violent as he looked at the vine gradually approaching him. His expression was about to collapse in desperation, there was no hatred, no unwillingness, only a deep sadness...

Meng Qiu’s reaction was completely different from those who were destroyed after the conspiracy. He suddenly became calm, but with a strong sense of fear, he was not worried about the revenge of the Spirit Tree, but it was more like an escape. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Don’t... don’t touch me!” Meng Qiu looked at the vine that was close and screamed loudly, That roar shook the sky, almost exhausting all his existing strength!

The vine of the Spirit Tree suddenly stopped moving, the distance to Meng Qiu’s forehead was only half a finger away.

Meng Qiu stared at the end of the vine as his expression trembled fiercely, his eyes suddenly became red, and his mood seemed to be boiling over.

“Spirit Tree!” A cry exclaimed!

Qin Song and Long Jiu were brought forth by the black armoured Spirit Envoys as “commanded” by Meng Qiu. After arriving, having seen the Spirit Tree regain its glory, it left both of them and the black armoured Spirit Envoys completely stunned.

The Spirit Tree which exuded a dazzling light was as holy and full of vitality as they remembered!
