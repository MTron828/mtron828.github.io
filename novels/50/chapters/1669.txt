Chapter 1670: “Seemingly Met Before (2)”

Gu Xin Yan followed the Pure Grace Palace’s disciple through the squeezy crowd in the main hall, walking themselves into a quiet corridor. Occasionally, disciples from other palaces passed them but Gu Xin Yan’s gaze merely looked straight ahead without diverting, her heart filled with an indelible figure.

[Was it him?]

[Will he appear here?]

Gu Xin Yan shook her head discreetly, feeling that her guess could just be a mistake.

[That person is from the Spirit Jade Palace, so how could he possibly appear here?]

Her heart longing for it to be true, but thinking it impossible.

“Young Miss Gu, this will be your living quarters. If there is anything unsuited to your needs, please feel free to let us know.” The Pure Grace Palace disciple said eagerly. Without having to mention the Blood Fiend Palace behind Gu Xin Yan, just with Gu Xin Yan’s looks was enough to make them eager to please. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Gu Xin Yan nodded her head slightly, and at the moment that she opened her door, there was coincidentally another girl standing at the door right opposite hers.

That young girl had a delicate countenance and was dressed in the Shadow Moon Palace’s uniform. Gu Xin Yan did not pay her much attention and was intending to go inside through her door when she suddenly heard a familiar voice.

“Zi Jin.”

The slightly cold voice sounded from behind Gu Xin Yan’s back and Gu Xin Yan jumped slightly, but she did not dare to turn her head back.

“Come to my room.” That voice sounded once again but was from a little further inside. Gu Xin Yan could not help herself but silently turned her head around, to see a ordinary looking youth conversing with the young girl opposite her.

[It’s not him.....]

That youth was dressed in the Shadow Moon Palace’s uniform, and his features were different from what she remembered of that person’s. But that pair of eyes and that voice were so highly familiar to Gu Xin Yan.

The youth and Zi Jin spoke for awhile and Zi Jin then followed behind the youth with a slight blush on her face. Gu Xin Yan stood at the mouth of her door, to look at the backs of the pair leaving together. For some reason, Gu Xin Yan could feel her tinge of regret in her heart.

Despite knowing that it was impossible for that person to appear here in this place, and knowing that even if they met again they would be enemies, her heart however could not help anticipating, that if there would come a day..... that they could meet again, how great that would then be.

“Young Miss Gu?” The disciple from the Pure Grace Palace called out softly in puzzlement as he looked at Gu Xin Yan standing frozen in front of the door.

Gu Xin Yan’s mind snapped back to her senses and she gave a apologetic smile before opening the door and going inside.

Zi Jin was led by Jun Wu Xie’s to come into Jun Wu Xie’s room and she sat herself down quietly upon a chair, not daring to move.

During this period as the birthday celebrations were being carried out, all the guests would stay in the Pure Grace Palace. But for the sake of convenience, the male and female guests stayed in separate quarters.

“Young Master Jun, why did you ask me to come here?” Zi Jin asked as her clear eyes looked at Jun Wu. Throughout the journey, after having been with Jun Wu for a longer period of time, though he did not speak much, Zi Jin had been able to detect that the youth who was a person of few words had a mind deeper and more intelligent than she had imagined.

Robbing the Shadow Moon Palace’s convoy and winning Yue Yi over to finally enter the Pure Grace Palace as guests from the Shadow Moon Palace. An act of such audacity was something that Zi Jin would never be able to even imagine. But Jun Wu had executed it so smoothly and when they were handing over their invitation, the calm and steady manner Jun Wu had carried himself made the highly nervous Zi Jin secretly admire the youth.

“In here, do not address me as Young Master Jun.” Jun Wu Xie said as she rubbed at her temple. She had noticed among the arriving guests from the Blood Fiend Palace, that Gu Xin Yan and Gu Ying had been among them. She didn’t really care about others, but these two people had interacted with her directly before.
