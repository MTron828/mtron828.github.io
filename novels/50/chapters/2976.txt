Chapter 2977 Stronger as a team 3

Qiao Chu was a little dazed. For a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

But Fei Yan suddenly clenched his hands. He held the spirit ring firmly in his hands.

“I want it, I want this Spirit Ring.” Fei Yan’s voice had a deep determination in it.

“I don’t know what integrity nor nobility is. I only know that because of my weakness, my whole family has been slaughtered before me. Because of my weakness, Little Ruo can only choose to blast herself to save me. There is nothing I want more at now, I just need strength ... I don’t want such a thing to happen anymore. I’m never going to let anyone around me die because of my weakness! No matter what kind of strength, as long as I can protect the person I love, I will ! Even if I want to make a deal with evil spirits, I will do it! ”

Fei Yan gripped the Spirit Ring, revealing a knot that could not be resolved in his heart.

A weak person has no power and cannot protect his loved one. Why should he insist on it?

“I want it too.” Qiao Chu took a deep breath and made his choice.

In fact, they were all clear that the most difficult person to accept was Jun Wu Xie. She never relied on anyone. But this time, everything she did was for their safety.

It was their weakness that made them her burden.

The process of fusing the Spirit Ring was slightly complicated. Only Jun Wu Yao could operate it. Jun Wu Xie could only stand by and watch.

The effort of trying to blend in with the great strength of the Spirit Ring was hard to imagine. But he was ready. The process of integration, the pain suffered by Qiao Chu and Fei Yan still made Bai Mo on the sidelines look pale.

If it took such pain to gain power, maybe ... he should really think about it.

Fan Zhuo and Hua Yao were still in a coma. Jun Wu Xie did not want to do anything against the wishes of her companions, so she could only suppress the fusion of the two with the Spirit Ring.

Perhaps because of the fusion of the Spirit Ring, Fei Yan and Qiao Chu’s injuries also began to recover greatly. This made Jun Wu Xie relieved.

Right now, Jun Wu Xie was helping her friends to improve their strength. But the situation in Sacred City had already exploded into a mass of chaos!

Three of the Top Ten Experts had already three missing. In today’s first battle, Jun Wu Xie directly turned the other five into meat paste. Given best medical techniques, they would not be able to recover back a complete body.

Among the Top Ten Experts, Jun Wu Xie had just been “promoted”. Only Nangong Lie and Qing Ke were left. Their high position, admired by countless people, had suddenly collapsed within a day.

Everyone who had witnessed everything in the arena spared no effort to spread what they saw and heard. Soon, everyone in the entire Sacred City knew about Jun Wu Xie’s “great achievements”.

Killing five of the six people all alone, this stout strength really shocked many people.

For a while, there was a discussion on how powerful the Dual Spirit Ring was.

Although His Lord was also a Dual Spirit Ring, he had never shown it in front of people. To many people, the Dual Spirit Ring was more of a fantasy than reality.

But Jun Wu Xie had made this fantasy into reality.
