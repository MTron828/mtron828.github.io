The footsteps stopped abruptly outside the door, and the atmosphere inside the room began to tense up. Those spirit envoys who were at first looking down quietly raised their heads up cautiously and looked in the direction of the door.

Suddenly, a sonorous voice came from outside the door!

“Old Five!! Old Five! Are you here! I’m Long Jiu! Say something if you’re here!!”

The deafening shout shredded apart the dead silence in the room, causing Qin Song who was sitting at the corner to be staggered at the moment.

The voice...

It was such a familiar voice!

“Brother Five, is he calling you?” asked a teen boy timidly.

After recovering from the stun, Qin Song immediately stood up and rushed towards the door in the most possible shortest time. He then looked outside the door through the air outlet which was just the size of two palms.

Outside the door, the big and tall figure of Long Jiu was standing steadily in front of his eyes!

“Long Jiu?! Why are you here? You dumbass, why are you still standing there? Do you want to die? Quickly, run!” The moment Qin Song saw Long Jiu, he was so shocked that his entire body broke out in a cold sweat. He was afraid that both of them would be caught at the same time and that was why he decided to split up with Long Jiu at that time.

Furthermore, Long Jiu was such a short fuse. Once he was caught by those traitors, he might probably suffer a lot, but... Qin Song never expected Long Jiu to still come in the end...

The moment Long Jiu who was standing outside the door saw Qin Song, a smile immediately hung onto his face, but before he could even speak, Qin Song had already bawled him out, causing him to be dumbfounded at the moment.

Through the air outlet on the door, Long Jiu saw the pair of agitating eyes of Qin Song. Unknowingly why, he suddenly felt a strong sense of poignancy arising within himself.

He was a carefree person who always act without using his brain, and it was Qin Song who had been leading him all the time. But now, even Qin Song himself had gotten himself into trouble, he was still busy thinking of asking him to run away. Such ties of friendship had made the eye rims of Long Jiu to instantly turn red.

“Old Five, what are you talking about! I won’t run! I’m here to save you!” Sniffing, Long Jiu said in a pretentiously firm manner. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Save me? Long Jiu, stop kidding, this isn’t the time for you to joke. Leave before those people find you and run as far as you could. It’ll be the best if you can leave the Soul World. Go wherever you want, just don’t come back!” said Qin Song earnestly.

Startled, Long Jiu didn’t really know how should he reply at the moment. Suddenly, a hand grasped onto Long Jiu’s shoulder and tugged him over!

A sense of horror went across the heart of Qin Song who had witnessed everything, but after he saw the person who was walking towards the door, his entire person was struck dumb.

There was a petite figure reflecting on his eyes. Although the face wasn’t the same one as the face he saw during the past five years, it was the exact same face when she was in the Spirit World. Even if the face had changed, the aura that belonged to the soul wouldn’t have any bits of change. The thing that they, the spirit envoys, sensed was never the appearance, but the aura of the soul...

“Miss Jun...” Eyes widening, Qin Song looked astonishingly at Jun Wu Xie who had just appeared outside the door. He simply couldn’t believe what he had just seen.

Why was she here?

“It’s me.” Jun Wu Xie slightly nodded her head.

“What are you doing in the Soul World? It’s too dangerous here, you should leave now.” Not having the time to bother the throb that suddenly emerged from his heart, Qin Song said quickly.

“Dangerous? You do know something, don’t you?” Jun Wu Xie had no intention to leave at all, whereas it was the anxiety in Qin Song’s speaking tone that had made her to vaguely notice something.

Qin Song had asked Long Jiu to escape from the Soul World just now. This didn’t seem to be something that Qin Song would say, but still, he said it. He must have found something big that had led him in making such a decision.
