Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao hid behind the trees as they watched the group of soul entities closely.

“What is that?” Jun Wu Xie asked in a low voice.

Jun Wu Yao’s gaze fell upon that group of soul entities, as he pondered before replying in a low voice, “It looks like the law enforcement of the Soul World. The souls in Soul World do break the laws and when they do, they would be taken by the law enforcement to be punished. Those shackles around the soul entities are similar to the Soul Binding Chains, they suppress soul power.”

“So many criminals?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows slightly, she felt that something was off.

However, at that moment, a curse rang out that came from within the group!

“Damn it! You guys are smug! I want to see how long you can keep being so smug! Betray the Soul Tree, you guys will not have a good end!” A tall and strong soul entity pulled at the shackles around his wrists, as he screamed angrily at the soul entities who were using powerful their connections to intimidate people. A pair of furious eyes glared at the leader, the anger in his eyes were a burning rage!

The voice immediately caught the attention of the guards. The intimidating guy immediately frowned and looked at the person who had shouted. He pulled off the whip at his waist and strode towards the screaming soul entity.

A slamming sound echoed through the quiet mountain.

The long whip cut through the air like lightning, as it lashed across the person’s body. One lash of the whip, the soul entity was suddenly wrecked with pain; his whole body felt as if it was struck by lightning. The figure was in a frenzy as he almost fell. Fortunately, his comrades behind him stabilised him by the shoulders.

The guard who wielded the whip looked at the soul entity dismissively and sneered: “Master Long Jiu, you think you’re still Master Long Jiu from before? Haven’t you figured out the current situation? Even now, you are still so arrogant? Not just you, even if it is the Soul Tree, so what? Don’t blame me for not reminding you, if you are so loyal to the Soul Tree, then you better behave, otherwise you will not be the only one who suffers.”

The person who suffered a lash from the whip was not just anyone, it was the person who rushed back to Soul World together with Qin Song, Long Jiu!

Only now, Long Jiu had lost his impressiveness of the past. The clothes he was wearing were tattered and torn, and his face was covered with several scars. Obviously, on this journey, he had been “served” with lashes of the whip.

“Tch! Aspirations of a vile person!” Long Jiu’s whole body was wrecked in pain, but he wasn’t in the slightest bit cowed. The glare he directed at the watchman was full of hatred, like he couldn’t wait to devour him whole.

“I’m the vile person? Haha! Long Jiu, you are really not afraid of death! Since your skin is itchy, then I won’t stand on ceremony!” The watchman was pissed off by Long Jiu, and without further delay, picked up the long whip and greeted Long Jiu’s body with lashes. Every lash is served with full strength, and in an instant, Long Jiu’s body was whipped to trembles!

Long Jiu gritted his teeth, and did not utter a single sound. He only stared at the watchman venomously.

The cracking sounds of the whip caused the other soul entities tremble in fear. They wanted to try and stop it but were threatened by the other guards, and thus unable to render any help to Long Jiu! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Just as the guard lifted his hand high to whip Long Jiu another time, his hand was frozen in mid-air!

Long Jiu, who was surrounded by pain, lifted his gaze as he wanted to continue cursing at the guard, but that instant when he lifted his eyes, he was stunned....

He only saw a petite figure walked through the group. When Long Jiu finally saw the face clearly, there was a surprise in his eyes!

“Jun’s little lass!”
