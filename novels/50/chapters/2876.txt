Duan Qi remained silent for a long time. The rapid change of issues really made her feel incompetent. The thought of the good plans she had had all turned out differently, how could Duan Qi be happy about this? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When Elder Yun saw Duan Qi’s uncertain face, she looked at Jun Wu Xie again. She could not help but sigh with a gentle smile on her face. She said to Jun Wu Xie: “Congratulations to Lord Yan. Since Lord Jun Gu approved both of you and Yan Xi is willingly to marry you, this is the best outcome. Just that, previously the matter that we had discussed with Lord Yan, I wonder if Lord Yan remembers?

“Is it regarding the birth of a baby girl to remain with the Sacred Maiden Tribe?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Elder Yun’s expression. How would she not know her thoughts? Her motive was to make use of the Dual Spirit Ring capabilities to give birth to a baby maiden.

Regarding this, Jun Wu Xie had already asked her mother about the details.

There was no special reason for the origins of maidens from the Sacred Maiden Tribe. The purity of the blood depends on fate. The more outstanding a man was matched with a pure maiden, the higher chance that they would give birth to a pure Sacred Maiden. But it was not absolute.

Just like Jun Wu Xie’s maternal grandmother, Han Zi Fei’s as well as Han Shu’s mother, Jun Wu Xie’s grandmother’s bloodlines in the Sacred Maiden Tribe were as pure. They were just like ordinary tribe people. The first man to be chosen from the tribe possessed great strength but may not be as mighty. But still, a pure Sacred Maiden like Han Zi Fei was born.

At that time, the Sacred Maiden tribe was confused. The tribe was thinking to have maidens give birth and nurture more baby maidens. But a few years later, when Han Zi Fei was learning to talk, the tribe requested Jun Wu Xie’s grandmother choose an outstanding man to matchmake with Han Zi Fei. But in the end, she gave birth to an average maiden like Han Shu.

Maybe it’s heaven’s will that the number of Sacred Maidens in the Sacred Maiden Tribe was scarce. There was no birth of a new Sacred Maiden since the existence of the last Sacred Maiden in the tribe. After the Sacred Maiden was married to His Lord, a second Sacred Maiden was born. And Han Zi Fei was born after the second Sacred Maiden left.

This made the whole tribe extremely upset and they tried various methods. After countless guesses, they still could not figure out the reason.

The reason why Duan Qi hurriedly wanted to find Jun Wu Xie was because Han Zi Fei was about to marry someone. During this period of time was the highest chance that a Sacred Maiden could birth a new Sacred Maiden.

“Exactly.” Elder Yun smiled.

“Yes,” Jun Wu Xie said lightly.

“That would be good.” Elder Yun secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Lord Yan was still young and didn’t know much about the situation of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. But given Lord Yan’s capability and Yan Xi got married to him, the tribe could not interfere if they could keep the baby maiden.

“There is nothing much to say about this. But the Elder Duan had said before. As long as I approve of her decision, I can cultivate my psychic force in this Holy Land of the Sacred Maiden Tribe. Is this true?” Jun Wu Xie asked as she slowly revealed her true intention.

Choosing Yan Xi was to solve the problem for her mother and secondly was to gain access to the Sacred Maiden Tribe’s Holy Land !
