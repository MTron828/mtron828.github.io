Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Once Jun Wu Xie spoke, her words had blown everyone’s mind on the spot.

Jun Wu Xie and Luo Qingcheng... One-on-one?

The people from the Upper Realm were all looking at Jun Wu Xie in disbelief. It was as if they had heard some sensational news.

Just to know that Luo Qingcheng was an expert whose strength was ranked at the second place in the entire Upper Realm, just below her Master. Even Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya who were also part of the Top Ten Experts wouldn’t have the courage to fight against Luo Qingcheng one-on–one.

So far, Luo Qingcheng was the only top expert who had achieved the peak of Spirit Ring. If it wasn’t for the Double Spirit Ring to be the one and only unique talent owned by her Master, Luo Qingcheng would have went up to the level of the Double Spirit Ring if she kept going on.

It was said that even if Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya teamed up against Luo Qingcheng, it would still be difficult for them to get any advantage from her, let alone Jun Wu Xie who was still so young.

To Xie Chang Ming and Wei Ya, the words of Jun Wu Xie had no difference with finding herself a way to die!

“Just by you? And you think you are up to the standard to challenge me?” Without taking her words seriously, Luo Qingcheng curved the corners of her lips up. Five years ago, Jun Wu Xie couldn’t even stand her one attack, and after five years, she actually had the guts to challenge her. She was just some idiot talking about some empty dreams!

Qiao Chu and the others too, looked astounded. Before this, they had never heard of Jun Wu Xie mentioning that she was going to pick a fight with Luo Qingcheng.

While facing Luo Qingcheng who didn’t really pay attention to her words, Jun Wu Xie oddly remained calm and said. “Over the last five years, the poison must have made you suffer quite a bit?”

With only one sentence from Jun Wu Xie, the rosy face of Luo Qingcheng immediately turned pale and furious the following second. Her pair of eyes widened a bit and glared at Jun Wu Xie with full of hatred. “You bitch! It’s really you! What was the poison you used on me!”

Luo Qingcheng couldn’t hold her anger back anymore. In the whole five years, she didn’t even dare to let anyone know her condition. Even her Master had only seen her injury once at the very beginning. And after seeking for the help of various highly-skilled doctors and there was still no sign of her recovering, the situation of Luo Qingcheng’s poisoned wound became worse and worse.

The wound had been spreading from her arm to one side of her face, completely destroying her gorgeous appearance! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Since then, Luo Qingcheng would always carefully cover her face with make-up before she could even meet somebody. She, who had already gotten used to her beauty, was unwilling to let anyone know her ugliness now.

“If you win the fight, then I will tell you.” Jun Wu Xie wasn’t afraid of Luo Qingcheng who was now boiling with rage at all. There wasn’t any change heard in her tone.

“Lady Qingcheng, she’s trying to get on your nerves.” Wei Ya suddenly became aware of something. He didn’t know anything about the so called poison, but he could faintly tell that the animosity between Jun Wu Xie and Luo Qingcheng should be starting from five years ago by listening to their conversations.

And now Jun Wu Xie mentioned about it again. She was trying to trick Luo Qingcheng into start the fight!

Wei Ya was confused. How brave was Jun Wu Xie to propose such a risky suggestion to Luo Qingcheng?

“Shut your mouth up!” Luo Qingcheng groaned furiously. Her wrathful voice had caused the whole body of Wei Ya to shudder, not daring to speak a word more.

Luo Qingcheng raised her eyes and gazed at Jun Wu Xie. Looking at the small face that was more beautiful and more attractive than five years ago, the jealousy inside her was just like a freed horse, running wildly without stopping.

“You bitch, since you wish to die, I will make it happen!” Luo Qingcheng narrowed her eyes. She wanted Jun Wu Xie to die in pieces! She would make Jun Wu Xie suffer the most painful torment in the world before she ended her last breath. She wouldn’t kill her instantly. Instead, she would chop off Jun Wu Xie’s limbs and let her watch the scenes of her friends, her family and her subordinates being tortured to death with her own eyes!
