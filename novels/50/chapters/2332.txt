Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Situ Heng’s expression did not turn for the better after hearing Jun Wu Xie’s words.

“Lower Realm! Why do you need to go to the Lower Realm! Jun Wu Xie, you have delayed time and time again, five years have already passed. What do you really want?” Displeasure was written all over Situ Heng’s face as he said in irritation.

Qiao Chu and the others who were standing at the side were stupefied when they saw this. They had met the straightforward Long Jiu as well as Qin Song who was like a smiling tiger. Suddenly meeting this stubborn Situ Heng, they were unable to react for a while. However, Ye Gu’s expression was ugly to the extreme and looked as if he was about to punch Situ Heng in the face any moment.

“Oh, Situ, so you were here.” Suddenly, a smiling voice came into the ears of everyone and the originally stifled atmosphere with daggers drawn had immediately dispersed.

Qin Song strode over with his face full of smiles with the burly Long Jiu following close behind.

“Qin Song? Why were you looking for me?” The moment Situ Heng saw Qin Song, his face had eased quite a bit but there was still a scowl remaining.

“I came to tell you that Miss Jun had already informed me about the matter of going to the Lower Realm yesterday. I have already discussed this with Long Jiu and felt that it was all right, so we have already agreed.” Qin Song replied with a smile. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Situ Heng’s expression sunk immediately as he retorted, “Agreed? How could you two agree to such a thing so easily? Why did you not discuss this with me first?!”

Qin Song replied with his signature smile still hanging on his face and said: “Weren’t you in closed seclusion for the past few****? Long Jiu and I did not want to bother you that was why the two of us had come to a mutual decision. Hadn’t the Spirit Tree said that after we went out, if there were any disagreements, weren’t we to vote to settle it? For this matter, since Long Jiu and I have both agreed, that there is nothing wrong.” The words of Qin Song sounded nice and pleasant but it was also implicit and it made Situ Heng’s face turn livid with anger.

“Qin Song, you really know how to mess around! Forget it, I’m not gonna care anymore!” Situ Heng stormed off after he said his piece.

Qiao Chu and the others were stumped as they saw Situ Heng storm off in anger. The words that Qin Song said just now were clearly helping Jun Wu Xie, but.... Weren’t Qin Song and Situ Heng on the same team?

“I’ve let everyone seen something embarrassing.” Qin Song said with his hands cupped.

Jun Wu Xie shook her head slightly, she was long accustomed to Situ Heng’s antics.

“About the matter on going to the Lower Realm, Long Jiu and I have already agreed to it so you can proceed on with your previous proposal.” Qin Song said as he gave her his assurance.

“Alright.” Jun Wu Xie nodded her head, among the three from the Soul World, Qin Song was the only one who was the easiest to discuss things with. Long Jiu was too lazy to use his brain’s and Situ Heng was always ready to disagree with everything she said. Only Qin Song was the smart one and did things reasonably.

“Since we are on this topic.... The last time that we’ve been to the Lower Realm, we didn’t have a chance to have a proper look around. This time, can we go out and look around?” Long Jiu asked as he touched his chin with a glint in his eye. When they had first embarked on their journey to search for the seeds of the Soul Tree, they had followed Jun Wu Yao all the way to the Lower Realm. Unfortunately, Jun Wu Yao was extremely crafty and the moment they had closed up the distance, he would disappear without a trace. The few years that they had spent in the Lower Realm was just spent chasing Jun Wu Yao and they had spent days and nights chasing without stop. Hence, where would they have the mood to stop and appreciate the scenery of the Lower Realm?

“Don’t worry, you can rest assured that as long as you go to the Lower Realm, whatever you want to see, I will definitely bring you to see!” Qiao Chu and Long Jiu were like birds of a feather, the moment he heard Long Jiu’s words, he immediately stood up and patted his chest as he spoke with gusto.

“Good brat! I’ll be relying on you then! Ha Ha!” Long Jiu patted Qiao Chu’s shoulders with a grin filled with satisfaction.
