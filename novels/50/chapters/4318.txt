Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

A drop of cold sweat oozed from Bai Mo’s forehead, and using the power of his Spirit Ring, he prevented himself from appearing too fearful of the spiritual pressure from Jun Wu Xie.

“Is this the power of Dual Spirit Rings?” Bai Mo squeezed these words out of his teeth, as he stared at Jun Wu Xie steadily.

“Would you like to try it?” Jun Wu Xie looked at Bai Mo, her spiritual power suddenly doubled, and Bai Mo’s expression turned even worse. Even with the support of his Spirit Ring, he was still sweating buckets.

How could he fight under such disparities?

Nangong Lie stood behind Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Xie did not deliberately exert pressure on him, thus, he wasn’t as influenced by the spiritual pressure as the others. When he confronted Bai Mo, he had felt the strength of Bai Mo, and with Bai Mo’s capabilities, there would be no problem for him to rise up into the top ten exponents, even more so, a great opportunity to leap into the top five.

However, even such a strong man, under the coercion of Jun Wu Xie, could not even lift his head.

At this moment, Nangong Lie became even more aware of the power of the Dual Spirit Rings.

That was a realm in which ordinary people simply could not compete in!

“City Lord Yan, it is alright. This matter is caused by me. No matter what Bai Mo did, please show mercy, City Lord Yan.” Nangong Lie returned to his senses and begged on behalf of Bai Mo.

Jun Wu Xie glaned at Nangong Lie, it was hard to imagine that in a world like the Upper Realm, there was someone like Nangong Lie who still had such a soft heart.

“As one of the top ten exponents, I myself need to face this type of challenge. I have also prepared for it. The trials have not yet started. If something happens, I wonder if it will alarm His Lord, so ... ... ” Nangong Lie said eloquently; he hated Bai Mo’s brutality, and thanked Jun Wu Xie for his rescue, but he was unwilling to drag Jun Wu Xie into trouble because of his own affairs.

Jun Wu Xie understood the hint in Nangong Lie’s words and immediately dissipated all the spiritual power.

The suffocating pressure that surrounded the crowd disappeared in an instant without a trace. Everyone gasped for breath like they were reborned. At that moment, as they looked into Jun Wu Xie’s eyes, it wasn’t just simply nerves, but everyone was full of fear and panic.

“It’s up to you.” Jun Wu Xie said faintly as she had no interest in taking a shot at Bai Mo. Although Bai Mo was strong, she did not hold him in any regard. Her real enemy was that one person. That person was sitting on the throne at the top of the Upper Realm!

Nangong Lie gave Jun Wu Xie a grateful look and immediately asked his men to take the injured guard back for treatment. During the whole process, Nangong Lie showed much respect for Jun Wu Xie. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Before anything had happened, the others might laugh at the weakness of Nangong Lie, who was one of the top ten exponents, being so respectful to a young man, but after witnessing the power of Jun Wu Xie, no one dared to say another word.

Even if it wasn’t Nangong Lie, if it were any one of the top ten exponents, when facing such a strong opponent like Jun Wu Xie, who would be able to withstand her?

If they weren’t self-aware and knew that Jun Wu Xie wouldn’t bother with them, those onlookers would be very eager to rush up and flatter Jun Wu Xie, they would even be willing to do anything for her!

It was an honour to them if Jun Wu Xie looked at them more than once!
