“I am afraid it is not appropriate to treat us people from the Middle Realm like this.” A lazy voice sounded from high above the square.

There was a certain distance between Ba He and Jun Wu Xie as they looked over to the source of the voice. The Nine Temples disciples also looked over curiously.

From within the dense crowd, a majestic and handsome man dressed in a crimson armour appeared. When Su Jing Yan’s eyes fell on the flaming red figure, he was stunned in place!

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord!

Standing in front of everyone was the very person who had been in seclusion for a thousand years, the very elusive Spirit Jade Palace Lord who had only been very active in the past one year.

When the Spirit Jade Palace had suddenly disappeared, it fell from the peak into mud. Everyone thought that the Spirit Jade Palace would disappear without any traces left, however never had they expected that within the past year, after the Twelve Palaces had been destroyed, the Spirit Jade Palace appeared before everyone and it instantly became a force not to be reckoned with in the Middle Realm!

Behind the Spirit Jade Palace Lord, there was a group of girls dressed in the Spirit Jade Palace’s attire. Each of them had beautiful and peerless countenance, but what made them outstanding was that unwavering gaze of theirs. Having hidden for a thousand years, the Spirit Jade Palace once again stood in front of everyone and revealed the sharp blade that had been concealed for millennium!

What was more shocking was that behind the disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace, there was a group of people dressed in all sorts, the ages of the people in that group varied as well as their dressing. They each held a weapon in hand, however on their faces, they had on the same unwavering gaze as the disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace!

“Ah Liu!” One Nine Temple disciple suddenly recognised a person from within and called out.

Wasn’t that person that the very person who had enrolled and entered the Cloudy Brook Academy together with him? Only after the two had graduated from the Academy, one had entered the Nine Temple while the other had entered the Flame Demons Palace. It was ever since then that they had been split up, never in their wildest dreams but they have imagined that they would meet after so many years in such a peculiar situation.

The Spirit Jade Palace Lord stood in front of the people and there was a strange silence because of their sudden arrival.

Jun Wu Xie’s silver armour had long been dyed red with blood, and that red looked strangely harmonious with the flame red armour that the Spirit Jade Palace Lord was wearing!

She looked at the Spirit Jade Palace Lord of the curious glance before her eyes fell on the girl was wearing a mask behind him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It’s her?

That girl’s face was covered with a bronze mask and she exuded a light and heroic disposition. When she saw Jun Wu Xie’s bloodstained silver armour, her initially calm eyes suddenly reflected shock and pain!

“Even though the Upper Realm is mighty, however you seem to have forgotten that you are currently standing on the grounds of our Middle Realm! In the lands of our Middle Realm, I don’t allow you to act so impudently!” The Spirit Jade Palace Lord’s changed to one that was awe inspiring and no one could piece him together with the lazy and languid person of the past.

Ba He’s lips curled into a sneer as he looked at the group of people that the Spirit Jade Palace Lord had brought. In his eyes, the Middle Realm was just a mishmash of riffraffs and there was no difference between them and dogs.

“Middle Realm’s lands? What can this Middle Realm be counted as? To me, it is just a place that I can kill who I want to kill, just like a slaughterhouse. Did you think that by bringing a bunch of shrimps and crabs, you will be able to scare me? What a joke! Just a bunch of wastes that have delusions of ascending to heaven!”

Ba He’s words made all the expressions of the Middle Realm’s people ugly to the extreme, even the Nine Temple disciples glared at him.

Although their Middle Realm was not as powerful as the Upper Realm, but they did not need to be humiliated to such an extent!
