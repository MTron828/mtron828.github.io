Bai Mo stared at the direction that Jun Wu Yao was pointing. If it wasn’t for him unable to defeat the big devil, he would have kicked his face swiftly!

Pointing at a young man and asking him to call ‘mother’?

Was he sick in the head?!!

“You should know that I am a wanted criminal in the Upper Realm and you just happened to recognize me again. This is not going to be easy.” Jun Wu Yao’s voice came into Bai Mo’s ear with a hint of confusion.

A chill suddenly rose from the soles of Bai Mo’s feet. Jun Wu Yao, who had just returned to the situation, now gave off a suffocating killing intent.

Bai Mo jolted in shock and it was at this moment that he realized the seriousness of the matter!

Jun Wu Yao was the subject of arrest by His Lord. But now he happened to know his identity. Not to mention Jun Wu Yao, if it was replaced by Bai Mo himself, he would silence that person ...

There was almost no hesitation when Bai Mo immediately turned to look at the helpless Jun Wu Xie with a blank face, and opened his mouth and called out: “Dear Mother ~”

The voice was soft and kind and for those who didn’t know would think that this was really Jun Wu Xie’s child!

“...” Jun Wu Xie turned away slowly, no matter how innocent Bai Mo’s appearance looked, but she could not associate him with a real child.

No child could kill one of the Top Ten Experts alone.

Regardless of Jun Wu Xie’s disregard, Bai Mo’s heart tightened. He couldn’t figure out what Jun Wu Yao was thinking. He could only look at Jun Wu Yao innocently, showing that he was very obedient.

“Your mother is shy.” Jun Wu Yao calmly said.

Bai Mo could only entertain with a smiling face, but his heart was bleeding. He was also the City Lord of the first city of the 72 cities, White Night City. He was also the overlord for the 72 cities for many years. In Jun Wu Yao’s hand, there was no trace of integrity in him.

He thanked God for saving his life.

“Oh, that ... what, if it’s okay, let’s go back first.” Hua Yao cleared his throat a bit awkwardly, thinking that something had happened. I didn’t expect it to be a Brother Wu Yao ... the scene. It was really subtle.

Qiao Chu and others also followed Hua Yao in a timely manner, leaving only the “family of three” in the large room.

Bai Mo could only pretend to be dead and be held by Jun Wu Yao, trying to make himself ignore his self-esteem.

“Little Xie?” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie, who had never spoken, with a hint of doubt in his eyes.

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Jun Wu Yao and sighed helplessly. No matter what she had experienced in her previous life, at least she knew what her relatives were. She was also lucky to be loved by the Jun family in this life and lived and died with Qiao Chu’s group of friends.

But Jun Wu Yao ...

He didn’t have any relatives, he didn’t know what the father, son, mother and daughter were. He existed, but he didn’t know why he existed. Before on the Holy Mountain, Jun Wu Yao often talked with Jun Wu Xie and Han Zi Fei and Jun Gu. More often, he just sat quietly and accompanied Jun Wu Xie. The family warmth belonging to the Jun family was unfamiliar to Jun Wu Yao.

In this world, for Jun Wu Yao, there was only one Jun Wu Xie, occupying everything in his life. She opened up his long-established feelings. Besides that, for the others, he was more ignorant than Jun Wu Xie.
