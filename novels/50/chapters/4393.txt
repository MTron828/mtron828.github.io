Chapter 2989 Strange Ying 2

“You can rest assured that, out of the kindness as your colleague, I will treat your city people well.” Su Ruiying suddenly said something inexplicably. Before Jun Wu Xie responded, she turned around and walked into a house at the side.

In the deep of the night, the yard was quiet. Only an old man with a simple broom stood outside. When Su Ruiying approached, the old man raised his head slightly.

It was an unrecognizable face, the position where the nose was supposed to be looked as if a big pit had been dug out instead. His face looked as if it had been burned deeply before. His lips seemed to be stuck together and coupled with the uneven burn scars and odd features, he looked like a monster at night.

“Ah ...” Seeing Su Ruiying, the old man quickly hugged the broom and saluted.

Su Ruiying waved her hand, stepped forward to push open the gate of the yard. She turned to hook her fingers at Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao.

“Come in, this is my residence.”

Jun Wu Xie walked over, and when passing by the old man, she faintly felt a familiar breath.

She seemed to have encountered it before but for a moment, she couldn’t recall.

Su Ruiying’s courtyard was gloomy, and by the roadside there were only two faint lights, and the fire swaying in the night breeze seemed to be tugging the shadows constantly.

“Lady Ying.” A low voice filled with vicissitudes came from the darkness.

From the illumination of the flame, Jun Wu Xie vaguely saw a pair of green eyes at the end of the corridor.

“Ah Fu, there are guests today, prepare some tea.” Su Ruiying said.

Those green eyes stared straight ahead, seeming to hear Su Ruiying’s words, and disappeared into darkness after a while.

When she came to the hall, Su Ruiying invited Jun Wu Xie to sit down. There was an uncomfortable coldness in the whole hall. The decoration in the room also showed strangeness. The wall hangings were not suitable for landscape paintings. There was a skull of a beast that was emptied of flesh and blood, and its eyes were dug away. Only white bones were left, and it was hung on the wall, showing its fangs.

Jun Wu Xie glanced around the hall, but her eyes were attracted by the rows of dolls on Su Ruiying’s table.

The puppets were about the length of an adult’s forearm. The workmanship was extremely fine. Each one was wearing delicate little clothes, standing in a row and standing, one by one, counted, a little as many as thirty or forty, just ... Those puppets gave Jun Wu Xie a strange feeling. The puppet’s eyes did not know what the material was, reflecting the candlelight in the hall, as if the human eyes were as divine.

“Lord Yan also likes these gadgets?” Su Ruiying noticed Jun Wu Xie’s gaze and said with a smile.

“The workmanship of these puppets are very delicate.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Su Ruiying chuckled, raised her hand, and picked up a doll at the forefront. The doll looked like a handsome young man, with a very handsome face. The small facial features were exquisite. In her hands, it gave a different feeling. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Lord Yan, these are not puppets.” Su Ruiying’s eyes narrowed slightly. She suddenly threw the puppet in the hand on the ground.

There was a crunch with a click. The puppet fell not lightly. Just after that crunch, the puppet fell to the ground and stiffly climbed up from the ground!
