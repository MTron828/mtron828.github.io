The next moment, the silence was broken by the clamourings of the Nine Temples disciples who were in a heated discussion. Afterall, the words “Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms” were too incredible for them. They could hardly believe that they heard such a shocking revelation.

Under the panic of the Nine Temples disciples, only the elders remained silent. From their faces, not a trace of surprise and panic could be seen. Only helplessness and despair was apparent on their faces, they already knew this, but never told the ordinary disciples.

Ba He narrowed his eyes coldly, and his chilling gaze swept over the Nine Temples disciples who stood at the side whispering amongst themselves. A glint of killing intent flashed by his eyes as he suddenly raised his hand, and a golden light flashed past. The moment one of the Nine Temples disciple was touched by that golden light, his whole person exploded in an instant!

The bright red blood mixed with the flesh and the internal organs spattered all around.

The other disciples who were whispering along with that man were now covered with his flesh and blood. They widened their eyes in disbelief, their mouths still had warm blood dripping. Just a moment ago, he was still a living person, and it happened just right before their eyes.... He exploded!

The thick bloody smell permeated throughout the square. The original murmurs of discussion immediately disappeared after the occurrence of this cruel and bloody scene. Order restored in the square as well as the silence brought forth by death...

Ba He’s cold gaze swept through the Nine Temples disciples who had been frightened out of their wits. He did not put this group of wastes from the Middle Realm in his eyes at all.

“All of you better shut your mouth. If you let me hear another word, I don’t mind letting you never open your mouth ever again.” Ba He’s malicious gaze was like a poisonous snake staring threateningly at everyone. All the Nine Temples disciples who had been swept by his gaze couldn’t help but tremble, fearing to utter a single sound, they even grasped their throats to stifle any sound, even breathing became difficult for them.

The little old man furrowed his brows. For Ba He’s cruelty, he had already expected it, but he didn’t think that... he treated even his own men similarly. Ba He was indeed a mad man.

Perhaps, Ba He had never regarded this group of Nine Temples disciples as his own people, and in his eyes, perhaps they were just a group of dogs raised in the Middle Realm when they were bored. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

To Ba He, it was merely killing a dog. What about it?

The disciples of the Nine Temples were completely quiet, but from their fearful eyes, it could be seen that for Ba He’s cruelty, they could only endure but did not dare to speak out, and some disciples couldn’t help but look at their elders. Initially they thought that the elders would stand out and say a few words on their behalf, but they did not expect that the elders of the Nine Temples chose silence at this moment. They even did not dare to look back at the pleading eyes of the disciples. They could only bow their heads and look away.

The strength of the Upper Realm, was not something that the Nine Temples could contend against. Even if they were elders, in Ba He’s eyes, they were just a group of lambs that could be slaughtered any time. Even their Temple Lords were in a similar plight.

Fear and anger started to spread among the Nine Temples disciples. However, the fear overwhelmed the anger and made them choose silence. The thick blood smell stimulated their nerves and made them extremely tense.

After Ba He killed that disciple, he looked at the little old man, and did not attempt to hide the maliciousness in his eyes.

“What about the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms? Are you trying to provoke the rebellious heart of this group of wastes? I advise you to save some strength. Since you’ve come today, there is no room for leaving alive!”
