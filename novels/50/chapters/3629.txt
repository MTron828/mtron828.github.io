Looking at the entire campsite, the only male was Ye Mei and there was because he ran many errands, mainly sending medicine and the likes. Hence, his presence had scared the Spirit Jade Palace Lord silly due to his fear of man.

Jun Wu Xie understood the reason and did not say anything further. She just walked over and picked up Lord Meh Meh from hands of the stunned Ye Mei.

The self-recovery ability of the spirit beasts were much higher than that of humans, coupled with the care and high medicinal skills of Jun Wu Xie, Lord Meh Meh’s wounds had recovered by quite a bit. It was just that it seem to realize that it’s ‘weakness’ could bring about some benefits and it could clearly walk on his own but it still rested on the bed pitifully, in order to be cared by Jun Wu Xie.

“Shrewd Meh Meh.” The black cat who was standing on the shoulder of Jun Wu Xie said in a pompous tone.

Lord Meh Meh ignored its contempt and only looked up pitifully at Jun Wu Xie with half opened eyes as it raised its front hoof and scratched Jun Wu Xie’s collar and it successfully exchange for the gentle touch of Jun Wu Xie.

The Blood Sacrificial Rabbit who had followed by the side was green with envy, if it was not for the size of Lord Meh Meh, it had very much wanted to exchange the task with Lord Meh Meh, so that it could also experience the attention of such affection.

After Jun Wu Xie patted Lord Meh Meh, she bent down to pet the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit. Only after this set of actions did it appease the frail and unbalanced heart of the little rabbit. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It squinted it eyes with delight as it enjoyed the touch of Jun Wu Xie, because of Jun Wu Xie’s advancement and the addition of Poison Ivy, her affinity with plants had increased and the aura of plants was more dense and it made the rabbit greedy for more.

Lord Meh Meh was initially the only one to enjoy this special treatment, and when it thought about how it had to share Jun Wu Xie’s affection with the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit, it immediately used its hoof to kick at the face of the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit when Jun Wu Xie was not paying attention.

After being stepped on the entire face by that sheep, the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit could no longer bear the continuous provocation as it opened its large mouth and directly bit onto that restless hoof.

The rabbit had flipped!

“Meh Meh Meh!!!” The moment Lord Meh Meh felt the pain, it was stunned momentarily before it jumped out of Jun Wu Xie’s embrace as it hurled itself at the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit. The two silly beasts started chasing each other and the entire scene turned into a complete chaos.

“See, I told you. It’s injuries had long recovered seventy to eighty percent, yet you still didn’t believe.” The black cat casually licked its paws as it looked at the bleating Lord Meh Meh who was chasing the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit all around energetically. This guy had been fed so many miraculous medicine by Jun Wu Xie, it even ate a whole handful of lotus seeds from Drunk Lotus. Let’s not even mention it being injured, it’s strength should have already advanced yet it still acted all pitiful?

Jun Wu Xie did not feel the same, Lord Meh Meh and the Blood Sacrificial Rabbit had followed her by chance. They were not like the black cat who was closely linked to her soul, nor were they like her ring spirits. It was a coincidence that they had met and yet they had followed her diligently, trying their best for her, ardently pursuing and pushing themselves to help her in all of their capacity. They were not afraid of getting hurt for her, even if they were to stake their lives, they had done so on their own accord. This alone made her willing to share with them all her affection.

“I wonder if...Qiao Chu and the rest have received the news already...” Jun Wu Xie retracted her gaze. Before she had acted, she had transmitted a message to the Lower Realm just in case. They should have received the news by now, and she was afraid that they would rush to the Middle Realm. Things had temporarily came to an end here and if they could meet each other, she could entrust them to help settle the move to the Lower Realm, and she could save one trip.

She was afraid that once she went back, the moment she met with Jun Qing and the others, she could no longer bear it. She did not manage to find Jun Gu and she was not willing to see the disappointment in Jun Xian’s eyes.
