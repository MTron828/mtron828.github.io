Chapter 2950: Anger (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

That face...could no longer be called a face.

The entire face was no longer covered by skin. It was a mangled mess of rotten flesh. All the flesh on one side of the cheek had been corroded away, leaving only a piece of white bone. The eyelids too had no flesh left, leaving only the two dull eyes balls which stared back.

Jun Wu Xie took a deep breath, as her hand that was holding the bandaged hand was squeezed so tightly that her knuckles had already turned white.

She was used to seeing flesh and blood. She was strongly stimulated when she saw Fei Yan’s face.

The surrendered young man who always likes to ridicule others with a bad attitude ... was no longer there, and that face which had both accents of a male and female has been completely replaced by a mangled mess of flesh and blood. Although Jun Wu Xie had the power to heal him, Fei Yan’s face could not recover back to the original!

“I’m a man.” Fei Yan suddenly said.

Jun Wu Xie’s fingers froze.

“Men don’t need to care about their appearance. Little Xie, I just want to see, my face doesn’t matter, I just want to see, I want to see Little Ruo with my own eyes, please.” Fei Yan’s voice became extremely firm, and he knew Jun Wu Xie’s concerns.

Jun Wu Xie shuddered. She could only tolerate the pain of heartbreak that was stubbing her throat while she cleaned up the wounds for Fei Yan.

After processing Fei Yan and Qiao Chu, Jun Wu Xie could not rest for a while.

Jun Wu Yao stood behind Jun Wu Xie so quietly. He was very worried.

The time ticked by slowly and soon it was already late at night. The room was still silent. Little Lotus contributed all his lotus seeds and leaves, nourishing Hua Yao, and the Ring Spirits were silently guarding them. They could feel Jun Wu Xie’s pain and anger at this moment.

Qiao Chu and Fei Yan had been exhausted to the extreme.The return of Jun Wu Xie gave them a moment of peace of mind. The two eventually couldn’t take it and drifted off to sleep. Jun Wu Xie sat quietly by the bed, watching her companions who were in an embarrassed state and her mood was extremely heavy.

How could she have imagined that she had just left for half a day and such a big change would have happened.

With Qiao Chu’s current strength, even if they were within the Sacred City, only those who were strong Spirit Ring exponents could suppress. But they did not expect that there were only a few strong Spirit Ring exponents.

“Can you ... come out for a moment? I have something to tell you.” Bai Mo returned to his senses. The injuries on his body were not serious and Jun Wu Xie had checked on him earlier.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Bai Mo. No matter what Bai Mo did, this time he didn’t run away alone, but brought Fan Zhuo out. Jun Wu Xie was very grateful to him for this. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She was unwilling to lose any more of her companions.

Jun Wu Xie got up and Jun Wu Yao as well as Nangong Lie followed her.

In the backyard, Bai Mo was standing under the moonlight, and his expression was a little depressed. He turned to look at Jun Wu Xie. His immature face had no expression at this moment, and his gaze became extremely serious.

“Before, Bai Zhu had been following you, I felt that things were weird. Today, after you left, Bai Zhu once went to the restaurant and said that he was going to find you and he left after learning that you were away. Soon after we left, we were attacked. If I didn’t guess wrong this time, we should have nothing to do with him. The Bai family, none of them are kind-hearted. You took the position of the Overlord of the 72 cities. He can’t fight you, he was just waiting for the right moment to strike back. He won’t really submit to you willingly ... ”
