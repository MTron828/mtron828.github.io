Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Qiao Chu and the others stood before the Night Regime as they advanced towards the Upper Realm army. It was uncertain when Ye Mei appeared amongst them, as he rode a handsome black stallion and was dressed in the black light armour of the Night Regime. Ye Mei looked extremely imposing and domineering.

“Brother Ye Mei!” Qiao Chu was startled as he realized the sudden appearance of Ye Mei.

Since the departure of Ye Sha, Ye Mei and Ye Gu, there was no news of their whereabouts. It was until Ye Sha’s appearance, that they revealed themselves.

“Brother Ye Mei, what is going on? The Upper Realm army doesn’t look right! When did Uncle and Qu Lingyue come?” Great doubts were floating in Qiao Chu’s mind.

Before the battle, Jun Wu Xie had arranged for the Night Regime to wait within the city. However, there was no other arrangement for the army of Qu Lingyue and the Rui Lin Army, thus they didn’t ask too much. Only upon the arrival of the two other groups of army that they realised that Jun Wu Xie had made sufficient arrangements.

Ye Mei lifted his head and looked at the battlefield, and that silver figure.

It was evidently petite and slender, yet it was so firm and straight.

“This is the joint masterpiece of Miss and Lord Jue.” Ye Mei replied with unabashed pride.

Jun Wu Yao and Jun Wu Xie joined forces?

But Jun Wu Yao...

Ye Mei’s words increased the confusion of Qiao Chu and the others. With the battle about to begin, they didn’t have the time to question further.

“Whatever the reason, if these bastards are not vomiting blood, I will have lived my life in vain!!” Fei Yan said nothing further as he leaped from his war horse and headed straight for the muddleheaded Upper Realm army, killing them.

Following Fei Yan’s attack, Qiao Chu and the others did not hold back and attacked as well.

With every punch, every kick, they vented their fears over the past five years.

In a flash, the battle started between the armies of the Lower Realm and Upper Realm. Dust flew, deafening and ear-splitting noises everywhere, the grievances that were suppressed within the hearts of the people in the Lower Realm finally broke out.

When Wei Ya saw that the situation was not favourable, he immediately withdrew and joined Xie Changming in protecting an upset Luo Qingcheng.

Jun Wu Xie stood on the battlefield as she observed the chaotic situation. That strong killing intent had boiled over. Her gazed skipped over the people, and she was looking at the heavily guarded black carriage.

That year, as she lived in despair, the only thing that helped her survive was everything that Jun Wu Yao had given her.

Not just the Night Regime, but also his final bargaining chip!

As soon as Jun Wu Yao discovered the evil intentions towards him by the Upper Realm, he had already begun preparations. Setting up the Dark Regions, conquering the Middle Realm, all these were just smoke bombs to divert everyone’s attention.

Hence no one was aware that he had already planted the chess pieces that would turn tides.

People of the Lower Realm knew, before the unification, within the Lower Realm, there was the existence of the mysterious Ghost City. Everyone knew that the Ghost City had special rules, but what they didn’t know was the owner was none other that Jun Wu Yao!

The existence of the Ghost City was not meant to be just another city, but it was to hide that under the terrain of the Lower Realm, there a powerful array drawn.

An array that could make the exponents of the Upper Realm become useless trash in an instant.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
