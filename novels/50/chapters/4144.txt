“There’s no problem.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Seeing that Jun Wu Xie was firm about it, Zheng Weilong no longer said anything as she nodded her head and went on to make the necessary preparations.

Later that afternoon, Jun Wu Xie brought Zheng Weilong to Nangong Lie’s residence. Qiao Chu, who wanted to follow the lively scene, was stopped by Jun Wu Xie.

Knowing that Jun Wu Xie would finally show herself in the afternoon, Guan Hu and the others were all prepared as they thought back on how they had been ignored for three whole days. How much resentment had they been harboring in their hearts?

As soon as Jun Wu Xie entered, she saw that in the hall, Guan Hu, Mu En, Liang Cheng, and Liu Yi sat there glumly. All of them had on a sombre expression which had not a hint of firendliness in it.

Zheng Weilong stood behind Jun Wu Xie and watched them silently.

“It is really hard to invite the Lord of the Sea Spirit City. Are you not even paying attention to our five cities now? We’ve been in the city for so many days since we’ve came and yet we haven’t even managed to catch the sight of City Lord’s face. Hmph! If it wasn’t for the serious illness of Master Nangong, would you even show up?” Mu En sneered upon seeing Jun Wu Xie.

Guan Hu and Liang Cheng were also frowning, sulking and had the same thoughts as Mu En. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Only Liu Yi looked at the teenager in front of him. In terms of size, the new City Lord of Sea Spirit City was so petite. If he had not known that the other party was the new City Lord of Sea Spirit City, it would be difficult for Liu Yi to connect the petite boy in front of him with the war crazed man who had taken several cities.

There was no shortage of ambitious individuals in the 72 cities, but no matter how antagonistic they were, they would still weigh the pros and cons. Not to mention, there were still the ten big cities to go up against so basically no city dared to provoke a war between the 72 cities.

But the emergence of Jun Wu Xie completely broke this balance.

Those who had the ability to do such things were by no means comparable.

But Liu Yi stared at Jun Wu Xie for a long time, and never found the frivolity that should belong to a young man.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes were too indifferent, there was no trace of desire in her eyes and she was calm and collected, not at all like a person who was keen on fighting and power.

While Liu Yi was studying Jun Wu Xie, the three others were busy blaming Jun Wu Xie. Their words were full of sarcasm, but Jun Wu Xie did not speak, it was as if she was letting them vent.

Until they finished speaking, Jun Wu Xie said coldly, “Where is Nangong Lie?”

“You brat, you actually dare to directly call out Master Nangong’s name!” Guan Hu glared menacingly at Jun Wu Xie, let alone them, even if it was their City Lord, when they saw Nangong Lie, they would always address him respectfully!

Jun Wu Xie ignored Guan Hu’s questioning.

Guan Hu just wanted to continue his verbal assualt but Liang Cheng who was by the side pressed him down subtly and gave him a slightly restless glance.

“Master Nangong is in the backyard and I will bring you there.” Suddenly, Liang Cheng smiled and was unexpectedly kind as he let his men guide Jun Wu Xie to see Nangong Lie.

After Jun Wu Xie stepped out of the doorway, Guan Hu frowned and looked at Liang Cheng as he asked begrudgingly: “What was that all about? Why didn’t you let me teach this arrogant little brat a lesson?”

Liang Cheng retorted: “Why should you care about him? Just let him annoy Master Nangong and whatever that happens after is his own bad luck. Why should you be so kind to remind him of his lacking manners?”

Guan Hu was stunned for a moment and immediately understood what Liang Cheng meant. A mere Sea Spirit City Lord, if he had garnered Nangong Lie’s dissatisfaction who was one of the top ten masters, he was really seeking his own death!
