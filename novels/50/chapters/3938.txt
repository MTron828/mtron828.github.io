Those black robed men told everything they knew to Jun Wu Xie, that they gave no fidelity to Yan Wan but Old He. They were the chess pieces held in Old He’s hand, and also the one to handle most of the shady and furtive things given by Old He.

Since when Yan Wan became the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City, they had been surreptitiously helping him in getting rid of those talented youths just for him to be able to sit firmly on the position of the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City.

But the most shocking news they revealed was that it was actually Yan Wan who had ordered them to sneak into the creche and secretly murder all his five children!

Yan Hai was the only life to be spared because he wasn’t gifted to an outstanding aptitude when he was born, but Yan Wan didn’t expect Yan Hai to actually get a boost in his flair after going through the period of staying in the creche and the initial cultivating lesson. It was just that the fact was deeply hidden by Yan Hai’s mother, resulting Yan Hai’s talent in not getting exposed to Yan Wan immediately. At the time when Yan Hai’s mother had passed away, Yan Hai was already sensible and thoughtful enough to hide his talent from his father. It was until when Yan Hai reached his adulthood that he began to slowly show his ability, but by the time came, Yan Wan had already missed the best timing to kill him since Yan Hai’s aptitude had earlier been recorded by the Upper Realm.

It could be said that since their first meet with each other, both the father and the son had started to pit their wits and strengths against each other. Both of them were definitely not someone to be went easy with.

Even though Jun Wu Xie had somewhat made an assumption regarding this matter, it was still really astounding to know that what she guessed was true.

The malevolence of Yan Wan was truly something that could be hardly found in the world!

However, Yan Hai too, wasn’t someone to be sniffed at. Earlier before this, he had bribed the people in the city palace to laced Yan Wan’s meals with poison.

As the quote said, a wild goose would never lay a tame egg.

“Young Master, we’ve told you everything we know. Regarding this matter... how about...” The black robed leader looked at Jun Wu Xie in great trepidation. Not to mention that the Spirit Ring of Old He had already been damaged, even if he still got the Spirit Ring in his hand, he might not be able to stand face to face against Jun Wu Xie. The strength of Jun Wu Xie’s Spirit Ring was extremely strong, there was no way the level achieved by Old He’s strength was comparable to it. Even if the Spirit Ring of Old He had not broken, he might still not be able to fight against Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie glanced over them. Without speaking a word, she then suddenly turned her back and left.

At the moment, those black robed men let out a sigh of relief after they saw the way Jun Wu Xie responded, assuming that she wasn’t planning to do anything to them anymore. The moment they were going to get up and escape, those guards in the mansion who were being drugged by the rosemary before that had come encircling them, causing those black robed men to be all besieged in the centre!

“Remember to send those things back to the city palace.” The cold clear voice of Jun Wu Xie came from inside the mansion. The casual and insouciant voice was just like the ringing sound of the death knell, echoing beside their ears!

It was almost at the same time when Jun Wu Xie finished her words that the Night Regime who had disguised into the guards of the mansion gushed forward. Within seconds, they had killed all the men who were all dressed in black!

Even before the moment they died, those people couldn’t believe that all of these mediocre-looking guards were actually first class experts. Not even having the ability to resist, they were straight away murdered on the spot...

The smell of blood was whirling outside the room, but Jun Wu Xie was just sitting in the room, staring at the candlelight with something seemingly to went across her eyes.

Yan Wan had decided to kill her. Though he failed this time, there was still a second chance.

And since when Jun Wu Xie came to the Upper Realm, she had never thought of resigning herself to death!

If there was no reciprocity between both of them, wasn’t it against the principle of “hospitality” then?
