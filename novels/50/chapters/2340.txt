Chapter 2341: I’m Back (4)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Maybe it was because they were worried about Jun Wu Xie who had travelled for days, they didn’t want to disturb her that much. They just let some of the younger ones let it all out and let them cry all they wanted when they faced her. Yue Ye was crying so much that she was almost out of breath while Little Jue, who was affected by Yue Ye, was also whimpering. At last, Jun Qing was the one who finally coaxed them into taking a rest in their rooms located at the backyard. They finally stopped crying after he promised them that they were still going to meet Jun Wu Xie the next day.

Even so, Yue Ye and Little Jue each tore out a piece of cloth from Jun Wu Xie’s sleeves and carried the cloths in their arms like they were some kind of treasure. At that moment, Jun Qing was not sure if he should laugh or cry upon their act.

Both of them... sure had the hearts of kids inside them.

Not wanting to hold her up in having rest, Yue Yi and Elder Ying just briefly greeted her. They had no other choice but to control their emotions and return backyard to console crying Yue Ye who could hardly breathe whereas Little Jue’s bodyguards too, scooted off to comfort their little master.

Jun Wu Xie let out her breath among the cries of joy. She was given an order by Jun Xian to rest immediately and was not allowed to get out of the house unless she slept till the late morning of the following day.

Ye Gu and his fellow comrades were having discussion with Jun Qing and Qu Ling Yue about how to settle down the members of Night Regime. As someone who was more experienced, the Spirit Jade Palace Lord stood beside them and would lend them a hand by voicing out his opinions whenever needed.

After being told about Bai Xu’s identity, Mu Chen brought him to his mansion. The way he treated Bai Xu was totally just like how he worshipped the ancestors.

“Three of these...” Looking at the three dorky but adorable creatures standing in front of him, Tian Ze frowned.

There were one black beast, one little sheep and one big eared rabbit... Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Ye Sha and the others found two of the creatures in the mountain, they were seriously injured. The very thought of Jun Wu Xie being dead caused them to almost knock themselves to death. Fortunately, Ye Sha and the others stopped them with all their effort and finally managed to stop them. After they sent them to Jun Wu Xie, only then did Lord Meh Meh and the Sacrificial Blood Rabbit stop their suicidal behaviour.

For the whole five years, Lord Meh Meh and Sacrificial Blood Rabbit never left the Dark Regions. Jun Wu Xie too, was unwilling to put them in danger again.

“Hand them to me,” said a gorgeous woman who walked towards Tian Ze and stood beside him while looking at the three cute but dumb creatures which were sitting side by side.

Tian Ze took a glance at her and there was a slight tremble in his eyes. With a stiff voice, he said. “Senior Sister...”

Calmly, Su Ya glimpsed at Tian Ze and frowned a little. She then lifted her leg and kicked him to the side.

“Stop giving this woman that look! Don’t you dare to flaunt just because this woman is not able to defeat you now! One day, this woman is definitely going to beat your ass!”

Even though he was given a kick, Tian Ze didn’t have the guts to make a sound. Despite that, he was relieved to see Su Ya looking great and energetic.

During the year she was brought back, it just felt like she had lost her soul. She didn’t even eat or drink for a total of five days. As she was badly injured at that time, her body wasn’t able to hold up to such treatment. She obviously had the thought of wanting to die and it was only after listening to the dissuasion of the Spirit Jade Palace Lord that she regained a little desire to stay alive.

And this was what the Spirit Jade Palace Lord said to Su Ya at that time: “Jun Wu Xie has already lost one of her Master, her Grandmaster and the one she loves. And when she returns, do you really have the heart to let her find out... that her remaining Master has also left her?”

It was these words that boosted her desire to live.

If it wasn’t for her who was caught by Ba He, all of these might not happen. Su Ya felt guilty towards Jun Wu Xie and that was why she didn’t greet her when Jun Wu Xie returned. What she experienced was just the same with Jun Wu Xie. Su Ya lost her loved one and her respectable Master during the battle. Hence, Su Ya might be the only one who was able to understand the despair experienced by Jun Wu Xie.

It was a feeling of devastation that could never ever be felt by the others.
