There was a blue Spirit Ring flickering with dazzling light on Jun Wu Xie’s left hand!

“The Spirit... The Spirit Ring... How is this possible...” The leading black clothing man widened his eyes, not being able to believe everything he had just seen.

Just how old was Yan Hai?

Though he was quite talented, he was just a Gold Spirit, how was it possible for him to own a Spirit Ring!!

Even up till today, Yan Wan was still unable to condense a perfect Spirit Ring, how was it possible that Yan Hai was able to achieve it?!

But the Spirit Ring on the hand of Jun Wu Xie was so vivid, and the pain of the wounds on their chests were still reminding them all the time about everything that had just happened just now!

If it wasn’t a strong Spirit Ring, how could she defeat them, the supreme Gold Spirits, in just an instant?

No matter how unwilling the leader was to believe everything he saw in front of him, it was still impossible for him to obliterate the truth.

“How is it impossible?” With her brows slightly raised, Jun Wu Xie looked at those black robed men who had all collapsed on the floor. There wasn’t any emotion in the coldness of her eyes, as if the things that she was looking at was just some ants that did not have the ability to make any counterattack.

The leader was overwhelmed with fear at the moment. Even if he was beaten to death, he would never think that his target of assassination was actually an expert of the Spirit Ring!

This was such a farce!

Even if the number of killers got to double, it still wasn’t enough to entertain a strong Spirit Ring, let alone them!

Forget about the mission as they might not even have the chance to escape now!

“Yan Wan sent you here?” Steadily and composedly, Jun Wu Xie looked at them. Once these people were caught by her, their paths to return had already been cut off. Since all she needed to do to end their lives was just to simply move her finger, she didn’t have to worry about them being able to escape.

Those black clothing men too, had come to an understanding about the disparity of the strength between they themselves and the Spirit Ring. After they heard Jun Wu Xie’s words, they immediately suited their actions with their current circumstances by giving up in resisting. This was how the rules in the Upper Realm worked, the strong should always rule over the weak. When facing the strong, the so called loyalty and benevolence were all bullshit as they only obey and follow the powerful strength owned by one.

And now, the strength shown by Jun Wu Xie had far gone beyond the power that was supporting behind them, of course they would know which one to side.

“It wasn’t the Master... It was Old He,” answered the leading person.

Jun Wu Xie asked, “Is he the steward of the city palace?”

“Yes.”

A trace of coldness flashed across Jun Wu Xie’s eyes. The Old He that was being mentioned by the man was the steward of the city palace, and was also one of Yan Wan’s confidants. The time when Yan Hai told them all the information about the Sea Spirit City, he had also mentioned that, though it seemed that Old He was the subordinate of Yan Wan, Yan Wan was very respectful towards him as he had never insulted or humiliated him. There were even times where Yan Wan would listen to Old He’s advises. Such interaction was really odd in the Upper Realm.

Nobody knew the background of Old He, even after putting a lot of effort in seeking it, Yan Hai could only get a rough outline of it. He only knew that Old He was very strong, seemingly to be a Spirit Ring expert in the past. But due to some special reasons, his Spirit Ring was damaged, resulting him in falling off from the high position he once had and ended up staying in the Sea Spirit City. Nobody knew why would he agree to work under Yan Wan as in terms of strength, Old He might be stronger than Yan Wan.

Since this was the order given by Old He, this matter would most probably have something to do with Yan Wan.

Obviously, Jun Wu Xie’s previous act had triggered the thought of murder in Yan Wan’s mind, and now, he couldn’t wait to kill her!
