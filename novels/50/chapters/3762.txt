“Roarrr!!” Without saying a word, Brownie slapped off Rolly’s paw and gave it a threatening growl.

“...” Shrinking its shoulder, Rolly ran quickly towards Qiao Chu and hid behind him.

Well, the beast spirits had always been standing in awe of the bear spirits since they were born and there was nothing they could do about it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

What a shame! Qiao Chu couldn’t even bear to look at Rolly.

Did it really realize that who was its actual Master?!

Calmly, Hua Yao took a glance over his Double Head Bone Snake, feeling a sense of relief that his snake didn’t have any fluffy hair on it as it still didn’t learn how to act cute after Jun Wu Xie tried to tickle it...

No matter what the others said, Brownie persisted in hugging Jun Wu Xie. It wouldn’t let her go , until ...

“Blood Velvet!!!!!” Brownie widened its eyes when he saw a red figure, not knowing exactly when did that familiar figure appear behind Jun Wu Xie. Just as if there was an electric current flowing into its whole body, Brownie shuddered.

While staring at Brownie, Blood Velvet smiled brilliantly and said. “Till when are you going to hug my Mistress? It really bothers me a lot.”

And Whoosh! Brownie let go its hold of Jun Wu Xie and jumped seven or eight metres away from her before the last word had even flowed out of Blood Velvet’s mouth. Hardly recovered from the shock, Brownie glared at Blood Velvet in horror.

Although the seeds of Blood Velvet weren’t able to parasitize the spirits, they could still stay inside their bodies. It was unlikely that all their nutrients will be sucked out by the seeds, but the seeds would let them experience great pain. Before that, Brownie had interacted with Blood Velvet without knowing about the truth of the seed. It might be its impetuous personality that had accidentally triggered Blood Velvet, causing him to plant seventeen or eighteen seeds into all over its body and made it suffer pain for a whole month...

Since then, Brownie would always keep itself away from Blood Velvet as far as possible.

He was really a bad and evil guy! Bad! Evil!

While watching Brownie’s face turned pale because of Blood Velvet, all the spirits couldn’t help themselves but to finally laugh out aloud.

Surrounded by the sound of laughter, the Spirit Lord surprisingly found out that not only three of the plant spirits, Little Lotus, Poison Ivy and Poppy who were behind Jun Wu Xie had connections with her spirit, but also Corpse Flower, Crystal Orchid and Blood Velvet. Other spirits may not realize that, but for the Spirit Lord whose had his power recovered, he can immediately tell that Blood Velvet and the rest of them were now all Jun Wu Xie’s ring spirits!

One single person had six spirit rings? It was something that he had never heard of!

Even the Spirit Lord was startled by Jun Wu Xie’s valiant effort.

But before the Spirit Lord could regain his consciousness, he quickly caught sight of three unexpected “guests”.

A gaze of astonishment flashed across the Spirit Lord’s eyes when his eyes met Qin Song’s grey eyes. Qin Song was also looking at him at the same time. The moment the Spirit Lord glanced over him, Qin Song nodded his head slightly to greet him.

“Why are they here?”

Though there was this huge question wandering in the Spirit Lord’s brain, he still was able to tell that Qin Song and the others had come to the Spirit World together with Jun Wu Xie and her group. Since he couldn’t really think of the answer in a short time, he would just put the problem aside temporarily and welcome Jun Wu Xie’s arrival together with the other spirits.

Of course there must be a feast prepared for the return of Jun Wu Xie. She was brought to the Spirit House by the friendly spirits and once again, she was able to enjoy the delicacies from the Spirit World.

During meals, Brownie did not dare to hug Jun Wu Xie again because of Blood Velvet. However, it didn’t stop it from talking for even one second. It had been asking non-stop about questions like where did Jun Wu Xie go for the past five years and why didn’t she return to the Spirit World. Its questions was so many that Jun Wu Xie didn’t know where should she start to answer from but fortunately, Nalan Yue would always try to divert Brownie’s attention with food in time.
