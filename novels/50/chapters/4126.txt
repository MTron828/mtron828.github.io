Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

“The people of East Peak City, listen, the Lord of our city came to challenge you, please ask the owner of East Peak City to come out and face the challenge.” Ye Sha said nonchalantly.

The voice was loud enough for everyone on the gate tower of East Peak City to hear clearly.

It also included Dongfang Ku Bi.

Dongfang Ku Bi heard Ye Sha’s words, and wanted spit on Ye Sha’s face.

Going out to fight?

Did they think he was a fool?

He was shot with an arrow as soon as he emerged, as if he would appear again just to become a hedgehog!

“My Lord, what are we going to do now?” The guard on the side looked at Dongfang Ku Bi as he hid bitterly in the corner.

Dongfang Ku Bi hummed: “How should I know? This Sea Spirit City is like a lunatic. We, East Peak City, did not call or mess with them. What did she come to us for? To fight? Damn! Ruan Zhongshan and my strength was similar and yet that bastard Yan Hai had killed him. If I head out again, wouldn’t I be courting my own death?”

“...” The guard watched silently at the terrified Dongfang Ku Bi.

Dongfang was a special one among the 72 city lords. He was born with a fear of death, but he was also a braggart. He was born with high qualifications. Even casual training allowed him to improve faster than those who worked hard. His father was the previous lord of East Peak City.

Dongfang Ku Bi had inherited the position of the Lord of the City, he did not snatch it himself. It was given to him by his father before his father died of old age and illness. Although he was cowardly, his strength was quite good, so his position as Lord of the City was considered safe. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But Dongfang Ku Bi’s bad habits and flaws were very interesting. If he knew that the other party was inferior to himself, then he would strut around to show off his strength. But if he knew that the other party was stronger, then he would be afraid and not display any resistance.

Now, Dongfang Ku Bi was deathly afraid of Jun Wu Xie...

He didn’t want to be the second Ruan Zhongshan.

“But ... If you didn’t reply, won’t that anger the Lord of Sea Spirit City?” The soldier muttered.

Dongfang frowned and suddenly waved at the man ...

Outside the city gate, Ye Sha called for a long time without receiving any response. He could only turn to look at Jun Wu Xie to seek her advice.

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly to Ye Sha.

Ye Sha immediately understood the meaning of Jun Wu Xie, and once again spoke to East Peak City: “Our Lord has a command! If East Peak City Lord does not appear again, then Sea Spirit City will immediately attack the city! We won’t ...”

Ye Sha was only halfway issuing Jun Wu Xie’s words when there was movement on the gate tower. A faint white shadow could be seen slowly coming out from behind the city wall.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes looked slightly.

Qiao Chu, who was hiding behind Hua Yao, also noticed the white shadow, and immediately stretched his neck to see what the real Dongfang Ku Bi, who was almost killed by his arrow, looked like.

However...

When that white shadow appeared before the crowd.

Jun Wu Xie and the others suddenly stopped!

Only seen on the high walls of East Peak City, was a white cloth propped by the hilt of a sword,fluttering in the wind. The white cloth looked like a piece of underwear ...

The Lord of East Peak City did not appear. What appeared in front of Jun Wu Xie’s eyes was a “white flag” which symbolizes surrender.

“What’s this ...?” Qiao Chu was dumbfounded for a while, and didn’t understand the meaning of the underwear blowing in the wind.

Surrender?

This was impossible!

They... haven’t even fought yet!
