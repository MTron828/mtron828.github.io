Chapter 3077 The Final Battle 5

“What are you trying to say exactly?” Jun Wu Yao said in a deadpan manner. The God of Destruction was so sure of his victory that he was now taking the time to savour the moment of his plan coming together and leaving his opponents no room to maneuver.

“What am I trying to say? Haha, I want you to know how honoured you should be to be witnessing this great moment. You will be absorbed into my power and I will transcend this boring and meaningless world. It is your privilege to be a part of it.” The God of Destruction looked hopeful at his impending power, he would never forget how small and weak he felt when he first saw the great power of that great god. It was then that he resolved to be as powerful as him!

“Madman.” Jun Wu Xie muttered coldly.

“Madman? Haha, you will never understand my true desires.” The God of Destruction shook his head.

He returned to his chair and looked at them, “You may have been strong in the past but you’ve forgotten the thrill of having such power but I will never forget.”

Jun Wu Xie looked coldly at the God of Destruction. Golden light was slowly starting to surround her body as her god power was forming up on its own volition, creating a suffocating atmosphere in the hall.

At the same time, Jun Wu Yao was similarly surrounded by a layer of Dark Spirit.

The two of them stood side by side, with their black and gold auras mixing, it felt like a merging of the earth and sky.

Their two auras filled the hall and the smile of the God of Destruction’s face faded slightly.

He already knew what Jun Wu Yao was capable of at his peak and naturally knew the gap between their powers. He also knew that Jun Wu Xie had her god powers unlocked in the Seven World of Dreams. Nevertheless he remained confident he could subdue them.

But the God of Destruction also saw something that surprised him. Surrounding both of them was an aura which was at once strange and familiar, it reminded him of the aura of boundless power that he once saw from the great god. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Are you done? If so, it’s time for us to crush your dreams.” Jun Wu Xie looked intensely at the God of Destruction who had come down from his high.

“What is that power you have?” The God of Destruction was startled and uncomfortable by that strange aura.

Jun Wu Yao cracked a slight smile, “We have you to thank for that. If you didn’t trap us in the Chaos Array, we wouldn’t have had the opportunity to obtain these chaos powers. You are clever and confident but that cockiness will be your downfall. The goddess you trapped in the array many years ago was still there and she was the one who gave us these powers and opened the door in the array for us to be standing in front of you to make you pay for your past misdeeds!”

The God of Destruction’s face turned into an ugle snarl. He never expected that the chaos array he used to trap them would end up benefiting them so greatly!
