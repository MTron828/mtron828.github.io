Jun Gu glanced at Han Zi Fei who was next to him. The couple tacitly exchanged a look. He said lightly: “Since we are just married, I’m afraid that Zi Fei is not used to it, so we plan to stay in Holy Mountain for two more days. Will this pose a problem for Elder Duan?”

Duan Qi froze slightly. She didn’t even think Jun Gu would respond in this manner?

When Jun Gu first arrived at the Holy Mountain, he had said to Duan Qi that after the wedding, they would leave Holy Mountain immediately. And it was precisely because of what Jun Gu had said that Duan Qi decided to inquire.

But she never thought that...

Jun Gu would suddenly change his mind!

This really made Duan Qi a little bit ignorant of what was going on.

She had already made arrangements for tonight. After sending Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei off, she would be arranging a feast, along with a beauty selection for Jun Wu Xie, but ... Jun Gu and his party would not be leaving!!

Duan Qi was embarrassed for a moment. She had already notified Jun Wu Xie about the banquet tonight. And Jun Wu Xie also showed a slight hint of agreement today. She had thought that Jun Wu Xie was agitated by the marriage of Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei, and wanted to do the same. Duan Qi was thus happy with her plan.

However, Jun Gu and his party were not leaving ... DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Duan Qi was now caught in a dilemma. She couldn’t help but look at Elder Yun at the side.

Elder Yun also felt awkward.

If Jun Gu and his entourage didn’t leave, then the banquet tonight would definitely be to celebrate the union of these two persons. But it wasn’t easy for Jun Wu Xie to have agreed to the banquet tonight, and they didn’t want to miss such a good opportunity!

“That being the case, then I’ll prepare the banquet tonight.” Elder Yun said tentatively.

Her hidden intention had not escaped Han Zi Fei’s eyes, and Han Zi Fei could see the little movement between Elder Yun and Duan Qi in one glance, but ... this time, she didn’t intend to expose it.

“Forget about the banquet, it is troublesome and boring, we will arrange our time ourselves, you don’t need to worry about it.” Han Zi Fei waved her hand nonchalantly. She had previously received a hint from Jun Wu Xie, since her daughter had made the move, she would naturally not destroy her girl’s plan.

“I’m afraid that’s not appropriate?” No matter how happy she was, Elder Yun was still embarrassed.

“Don’t think too much about it. We will leave first.” Han Zi Fei waved at Elder Yun, pulling at Jun Gu, and turned away without giving Elder Yun and Duan Qi any time to react.

Han Shu, who had been eavesdropping by the side, saw that Han Zi Fei had left, her heart became extremely tangled.

She thought that Han Zi Fei would be on the road today, and Yan Xi could also succeed as soon as possible, but who would have thought that they would not be leaving?

Han Shu couldn’t help but feel a little annoyed. In addition to the anxiety in her heart, she now not only hoped that Han Zi Fei could quickly get out of her sight, and even Yan Xi, she didn’t want either to stay any longer in the Sacred Maiden Tribe!

“Elders.” Han Shu pretended to walk calmly in front of Duan Qi and Elder Yun. The only good news was that Han Zi Fei did not plan to attend the banquet tonight, or Han Shu was really going to cry. She just learned from Duan Qi that Jun Wu Xie seemed quite interested in tonight’s banquet. She had already prepared her dress and makeup so that she would stand out tonight.

“You don’t have to be here, go back and prepare. Tonight is a good opportunity, you have to seize the opportunity” Duan Qi looked at Han Shu and said coldly.

Han Shu nodded pretentiously, and then retreated.
