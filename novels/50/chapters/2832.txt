Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie nodded again. When Han Zi Fei left, Jun Wu Xie didn’t know that Jun Gu was the Knight of Destruction. She didn’t know that Han Zi Fei knew all this. But now it seemed that Han Zi Fei knew it all along ...

Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie, who suddenly became extremely honest. She couldn’t help laughing again.

“I remember you said that your mother had died a long time ago. Now that your father is alone, he can’t marry anymore? Or do you not like me?” Han Zi Fei looked at Jun Wu Xie seriously. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jun Wu Xie was silent again ...

She couldn’t accept it instinctively. The fact that her father remarried. In Jun Wu Xie’s understanding of love, the concept was of one lifetime between two people. She couldn’t accept any new beginnings. Even if it was her ... in this world, no matter how good a man can be, she could not accept it once again.

That heart had long been branded with Jun Wu Yao. Even if he disappeared, the branding in her heart would remain. Once they have given all their love, they will not change because of time, place and anyone. Not just that person, but those memories still belonged to them.

Jun Wu Xie had never seen her mother. But she believed that her father would not be such a forgetful person.

She didn’t hate Han Zi Fei. In her heart, she clearly had a great affection for Han Zi Fei. Sometimes she also imagined that if her mother was a woman like Han Zi Fei, she would definitely be very happy.

Of course ...

All of these could not be confused.

Seeing Jun Wu Xie and not speaking again, Han Zi Fei couldn’t help but chuckled. This little girl was usually very shrewd. But sometimes she could be simple and powerful. Although she didn’t say it, she had a subtle look on her face. She had already shown her resistance.

Han Zi Fei really didn’t know that she should be happy having the protection of her daughter from her mother or feeling helpless because her daughter was going to prevent her parents from getting married.

“This marriage was ordered by the Lord.” Han Zi Fei’s tone suddenly changed.

Jun Wu Xie looked up.

Han Zi Fei said: “But I asked the Lord to arrange this marriage as I know that Jun Gu is your father and that you want to save him. But Wu Xie, I have to remind you that the Knight of Destruction has something very important that was held by the Lord, and this is something they even didn’t know themselves. If you want to save Jun Gu, you must snatch back from the thing that is held by the Lord, otherwise the person will be incomplete even if you managed to save him. ”

“What?” Jun Wu Xie shuddered slightly.

Han Zi Fei went on to say: “Also, now there is a maiden around Jun Gu. That woman is good at witchcraft. She controls your father with the rhinoceros’s horn. Unless another maiden replaces her to stay beside Jun Gu to monitor him, otherwise she won’t leave or take away the control over your father. So ... Wu Xie, whether you are willing or not, but you must know that my purpose is the same as yours. The only way to save your father is to let me marry him. Only this way, when that woman leaves his side, it would give me a chance to find out exactly what was taken from him by the Lord. ”

“My father ... what exactly was taken away? I don’t understand.” Jun Wu Xie had huge questions in her heart.

Han Zi Fei said: “I’m not sure. Maybe it’s the soul or something else. the Lord isn’t as simple as you think.”
