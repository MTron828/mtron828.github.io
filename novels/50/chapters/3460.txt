“Flame Dragon, exactly for what have you invited all of us here?” A strange voice sounded out from the Soul Slayer. The voice was neither male nor female, a sound that was a metallic resonance with every word spat out, the voice seemingly passing through the ears and straight into the brain.

“I have naturally invited thee here regarding the matter of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower.” The Flame Dragon’s deep booming voice rang out suddenly. It then turned its head slightly to look at Wu Jiu standing at the front and paused a moment before it said: “Because, recently, with the construction of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower being completed, it was accompanied by news that it would be handed out. I am of the thought that as the possessor of the Serene Spirit Tower, Wu Jiu, isn’t an explanation due to all of us here?”

Flame Dragon went straight to the point to voice out his doubt. In the recent period, quite a number of incidents had sprung up among the Beast Spirits. Although Flame Dragon had quickly suppressed them, it was not able to prevent all of those incidents from happening. As long as the right to possess the fourth Serene Spirit Tower was not certain, then such situations would only continue to worsen by the day. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Flame Dragon’s question was coincidentally what Soul Slayer had wanted to ask, and the pair of blood red rubies seemed to be looking at Wu Jiu.

Only Poison Ivy, merely swept a fleeting glance over Wu Jiu.

Wu Jiu gave a faint smile, the smile blossoming on that good looking and effeminate face. There was an unspeakable allure, that though beautiful, made others feel a chill run through them.

“So that’s what this is all about. I had wondered what was the matter. The fourth Serene Spirit Tower was one I appealed to the Spirit Lord to build. Because after the previous three Serene Spirit Towers were built, the results were remarkable, and hence I built the fourth Serene Spirit Tower. As for the results the Serene Spirit Towers give, I am sure it is clear for the three of you to see. It can elevate the cultivation of spirits which is such a great thing. I, Wu Jiu, do not dare to horde something that great for myself and have hence decided to give up possession of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, wishing only that the benefits of the Serene Spirit Tower do not only go to the human spirits alone, as it should belong to the entire Spirit World, to belong to all the spirit races of the Spirit World.

Wu Jiu’s voice was gentle, the pace of his words unrushed, but rather emotional. He spoke with a smile on his face, his eyes smiling, his words sounding highly earnest and sincere.

But that sincerity was lost upon Flame Dragon and the others.

As the leaders of the three great spirit races, they would not be taken in with just a few flowery words. They knew nothing about the Serene Spirit Tower and they would naturally not believe Wu Jiu’s words so easily.

“From what I know, the Serene Spirit Tower does not seem to be beneficial to non human spirits.” Soul Slayer then said.

Wu Jiu nodded his head without hesitation and then replied very candidly: “That’s true. Only human spirits are allowed into the previous three Serene Spirit Towers and right from the beginning of their construction, I have already told all the spirit races that besides human spirits, all other spirit races must not come close to the Serene Spirit Towers even a step. My warning at that time might sound domineering and tyrannical to all your ears, and rather disrespectful. But please forgive my unintentional mistake as I had not wanted our friends from the other spirit races to come to harm due to a lack of understanding.”

Wu Jiu paused a moment, and then continued on in an earnest tone.

“The previous three Serene Spirit Towers, were experiments I was carrying out. I am a human spirit myself, and hence I understand human spirits the most. Everything in those three Serene Spirit Towers were built according to suit the human spirits’ method of cultivation and that is why to a human spirit, it is a priceless treasure. But to other spirit races, it does not benefit them at all, to the extent that it might even bring them harm.”
