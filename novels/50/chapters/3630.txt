Over on this side, Jun Wu Xie and the rest were resting after having found a new path to head towards to.

However, on the other side, a group of uninvited guests step into the blood filled Cloudy Brook Academy. The few black robed man looked at the devastated site before them, with bodies scattered all around the square. Looking at the dried blood on the ground and at the condition of the dead bodies, it seems that a fierce battle had ensued quite some time ago. The deep scarlet red that had dyed the entire place was a startling sight to behold.

“This... How did this happen?” The man leading the group was shocked beyond words, everything he saw before him was really unexpected. With a pale face, he immediately said, “Go back immediately and inform the Lord.”

“Yes!”

In the entire square of the Cloudy Brook Academy, all the bodies had belonged to the people of the Upper Realm. If one did not witness the with one’s own eyes, no one would ever believe that a thousand Gold Spirits would actually be wiped out here!

The black robed men quickly left at an amazing speed, wherever they passed, all they left was a golden afterimage!

In a dimly lit room, there was a revolting stench. It was a myriad of smells mixed together, however one thing was clear – blood.

It was obviously a bright and clear day where the sun was the hottest. However, the doors and windows were tightly shut in that room and the curtains had blocked out every single ray of light. The room was illuminated by only a few lit candles.

The closed door was pushed open and a black robed man walked in from outside and immediately knelt down in front of the big bed in the room. That bed was covered with layers of cloth, veiling that person on the bed.

“Lord! Something happened at the Cloudy Brook Academy, I had gone to over to take a look but discovered that Ba He and his men were all killed, not one survived.” The black robed man reported in a hurry.

There was a long silence in the quiet room. Only after a long while later did a slightly hoarse voice sound out from beyond the veil.

“Do you know who did it?” The voice was hoarse but it was sounded unexpectedly nice, it was just that it had a hint of coldness that would make people shudder.

“Your subordinate have yet to identify that. A few bodies have been brought back, however looking at the traces, it seems that it should have been a fierce battle and both sides suffered huge casualties.... They should have been in a large scale battle because we have found that although only the bodies of Ba He’s men were found, however there were large patches of blood stains next to them, and there were also traces of mass burning which we believe to be the perpetrators burning the bodies of their dead companions.... As for who they are... Further investigations are needed before we can determine the identity.” The black robed man had reported everything he had discovered at the Cloudy Brook Academy.

“Really useless.....” A sigh came from beyond the veil, although it was sounded very casual, it was filled with a strong killing intent.

The black robed man who was kneeling on the floor could not help but feel a trickle of cold sweat drip down his forehead as a strong sense of fear enveloped him.

“The person that Ba He and his men caught was Su Ya of the Cloudy Brook Academy?” The voice rang out again.

“Yes.” The black robed man replied.

“Oh? Then... it’s great...that they are dead.” A hint of laughter could be heard in the voice.

Sweat started to trickle down like rain as the entire back of the black robed man had been completely soaked in cold sweat.

It’s great?

A thousand Gold Spirits had all been wiped out and yet the Lord had said ‘it’s great’?

What did he mean exactly?

“Heed my orders, dispatch all of the dark guards and carry out a large scale search in the vicinity of Mount Fu Yao. Being able to wipe out Ba He and his men, she would not leave unscathed. Under such heavy injuries, she won’t be able to escape far...” His laughter echoed in the room, insidious and dark as if a devil had crawled out from the depths of hell.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
