“How can you cultivate with a flesh body? You’ve gotta be kidding! Miss Jun doesn’t know how powerful it is but don’t you all know?!” It was the very first time the Spirit Lord had ever revealed such profound anger. Having originated from the Soul World, he had a very deep understanding towards the cultivation methods there and although that method was indeed powerful enough for people, but at the same time, the damage that they had to exchange for such power was also terrible.

Qin Song became silent.

Instead, Jun Wu Xie said: “I know it is dangerous, but I have no other choice. The Upper Realm has already stretched their hands out to all three realms. If I were to just remain a spectator at the sidelines, no one would be able to stop them.”

If she could, she too did not want to cultivate such an extreme method, but... she had no choice.

The face of the Spirit Lord was ugly to the extreme. Jun Wu Xie had saved the Spirit World yet he could only watch her push herself forcibly to gain such powers through such dangerous means.

“You want to deal with the Upper Realm?!” The Spirit Lord looked at her incredulously, the courage of this girl was too big and it seemed that there was nothing in the world that she did not dare to do.

The query of the Spirit Lord made Qin Song and other people similarly stunned. They only knew that she wanted to exact vengeance but they did not know to whom her vengeance was directed to. Today, when they found out that she was going to deal with the Upper Realm, they were incomparably shocked.

The expression on Situ Heng’s face changed slightly.

“Don’t tell me that I can only helplessly watch them carry out the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms?”

In a single sentence, she had rendered them speechless.

They were very clear on the plan of the Upper Realm and even though they were enraged, they were powerless to stop it.

Never would they have thought that Jun Wu Xie had been secretly preparing to deal with the Upper Realm.

The Spirit Lord leaned forward with his brows wrinkled and looked at her intently: “The danger is too great, do you have any certainty?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head slightly.

The plan that she had spent five years on that had supported her to the present was not an illusory fantasy, but power that she grasped with her own hands.

“So you’ve come to the Spirit World to use the Spirit World’s soul power to stabilize the power of Miss Jun?” The Spirit Lord shifted his attention and looked at Qin Song.

Qin Song nodded: “This is also our last resort. If we are able to go back to the Soul World, I believe that the effect will be better, but now we can’t go back to the Upper Realm. We can only use your Spirit World, and... I know that you have a deeper understanding for such matters more than I do.”

The Spirit Lord smiled bitterly, yes that was right, he stayed longer than any of them in the Soul World. Naturally, he knew everything about the Soul World. Under the great stimulation, the Spirit Lord took a deep breath and fixated his gaze on Jun Wu Xie.

“I can help you temporarily stabilize the power, but if you want to completely stabilize it, you still have to go to the Soul World. I can only let your soul and spirit power calm down for a short time and the process will be extremely painful. Are you able to endure the pain?”

“What can I not endure?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows. She had to endure the pain for five long years. In order to achieve her own goals, even if she had to suffer such great pain, she could still endure it!

“Good!” The Spirit Lord’s gaze was profound and at the same time, he looked at Qin Song, Long Jiu and Situ Heng.

“I want to stabilize the chaos of the powers in her body. It isn’t enough with just me. You all need to help out as well. I will arrange the place. In the meantime, we must take turns to suppress the power in her body. Are you all willing to help?”

Qin Song and Long Jiu naturally agreed without a second thought and their gazes could not help but land on Situ Heng.
