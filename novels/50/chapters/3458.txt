Throughout the constant fighting, it was inevitable that some spirits would lose their heads and instances where injuries were so severe that deaths occurred began to happen. The conflicts that had started barely just for two days grew more and more complicated.

In that period, the Flame Dragon had already extended an invitation to Wu Jiu, and similarly invited the leaders of the Plant Spirits and Weapons Spirits, to come together and discuss about the fourth Serene Spirit Tower.

Wu Jiu dragged his feet on it for a few days before he finally agreed to meet. At the moment that the conflict between the three big spirit races had reached its peak, he accepted the Flame Dragon’s invitation and brought only Jiang Yun Long with him to go to where the Flame Dragon resided.

Among the mountainous peaks and within the rocky canyon, the caves of Beast Spirits were everywhere. A scattering of several Beast Spirits walked past by the mountain stream and at the moment they saw Wu Jiu and Jiang Yun Long, their faces lit up with traces of joy and not with animosity and enmity like in the past.

They could not help but start to guess whether Wu Jiu presence here could mean that the fourth Serene Spirit Tower was going to be handed over to the Beast Spirits.

Jiang Yun Long followed at Wu Jiu’s side as he looked at the group of Beast Spirits they were passing right by their shoulders and his eyes flashed with a moment of mirth. He then said softly right by Wu Jiu’s side: “Master’s plan has succeeded as expected. The Plant Spirits, Beast Spirits and Weapon Spirits are locked in endless conflict and your disciple even heard that two Weapon Spirits were attacked till their spirits scattered and it is feared that the Weapon Spirits are now highly displeased with the Beast Spirits. But..... there hasn’t been much of a reaction from the Plant Spirits and Poison Ivy has not even shown himself.....”

With just one Serene Spirit Tower, they had successfully diverted away the enmity that had originally fallen upon the human spirits and thrown the harmonious three great spirit races into chaos.

“It would naturally have to succeed. Even if the Flame Dragon and the other leaders were to smell a rat, but before the irresistible allure of mighty power, how many spirits could resist that kind of temptation? Even if they are not willing to accept that fact, they would have no choice but to accept the opinions of their race.” Wu Jiu’s effeminate face was tinged with a malicious smile. Ever since he had released the news of the fourth Serene Spirit Tower, things had remained highly stable for him and he had just sat back to watch the great show unfolding.

Jiang Yun Long then sneered: “How could all those fellas be a match for Master at all? It had only taken a simple ploy from Master and it has already caused them to start strangling each other. Now, they have already had blood spilled and heads broken over the Serene Spirit Tower and even if they wanted to stop, they wouldn’t be able to anymore.”

Wu Jiu snickered, but his face did not not show the slightest bit of glee on the surface.

“But..... Master, with the three great spirit races going at each other’s throats now, isn’t it still a little too early for you to accept the Flame Dragon’s invitation to come? Why not wait till their fighting gets them more desperate first? It still wouldn’t be too late for you step up at that time.” Jiang Yun Long said, the thought in his head highly vicious. Though the Plants Spirits were least in numbers, but among the four spirit races, they were strongest in terms of individual might. The Beast Spirits were most numerous while the Weapon Spirits were most connected and cohesive, their steel bodies incomparably tough. But for the human spirits, in all these aspects, they could not compare to the other spirit races.

But with the appearance of the Serene Spirit Tower, it had allowed the human spirits who had been oppressed by the other three spirit races to gradually rise, to the extent that they had already shaping up to emerge above the three great races.

If they were able to make good use of this opportunity presented to them by the fourth Serene Spirit Tower and let it cause the three great spirit races to lose more of their numbers, it would naturally be a good thing to the human spirits.

As Wu Jiu’s First Disciple, Jiang Yun Long was naturally highly valued by Wu Jiu, enjoying the status of reigning above all and subservient only to one among the human spirits. With the growing might of human spirits, it also meant that the power and authority Jiang Yun Long enjoyed would grow as well, so how could he not look forward to that?

Wu Jiu threw Jiang Yun Long a glance. How could he not understand what Jiang Yun Long was thinking?
