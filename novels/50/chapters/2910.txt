“What did you just say?” Bai Mo narrowed his eyes and looked at the man who was held tightly in his grip. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The frightened man’s soul seemed to have left his body, his teeth were chattering in fear as he couldn’t utter a single word.

Bai Mo raised his arm violently and smashed the man onto the ground. Before he could even make a sound, the man’s head was split open. Brain matter and blood mixed as they leaked out from the head wound. Shocked gasps were heard all around.

Ye Jue ...

The ultimate exponent who had once appeared in the Upper Realm, even His Lord had to show that demon some respect.

However, to Bai Mo, he was his eternal nemesis!

At the time, Bai Mo had already cultivated a Spirit Ring. But just as he became famous, he nearly lost his life due to a rash challenge against Ye Jue.

This name was like a curse that had troubled Bai Mo for thousands of years. He couldn’t bear to hear it or see him.

Looking at the raging Bai Mo, Jun Wu Xie looked up at Jun Wu Yao, the source of his anger.

Jun Wu Yao had an innocent look on his face.

“I couldn’t just tie my hands up by myself and let him beat me?”

Jun Wu Xie’s lips twitched, but she didn’t say anything else.

Actually, she wanted to say ...

Even if Jun Wu Yao didn’t do anything, Bai Mo most likely couldn’t beat him.

To fight against Jun Wu Yao, who at that time was at his peak, was definitely a nightmare for anyone. Even if one was born with innate talent and skills, when confronted with Jun Wu Yao, he would surely have his pride and confidence shattered.

Bai Mo, who had been angered to an extreme, turned to look at Nangong Lie with the scent of blood growing strong. He curled his lips up in a sneer and said, “What should I do? I’m really upset now, so ... Nangong Lie, let me vent my anger on you.”

Before Nangong Lie had time to speak, Bai Mo’s voice had disappeared!

Nangong Lie felt only a burst of killing intent rushing towards him, and he immediately used all of his spiritual power to launch a defense.

But in a flash, Bai Mo’s figure appeared again, and in the next instant, Nangong Lie and him were brawling in a tight ball of movements!

Both of them were strong users of their Spirit Rings. The crowd around them couldn’t keep up with their speed, they could only see a stream of light flashing across their eyes, but they couldn’t make out the details of the fight.

The collision of the two spiritual powers set off a wave of aftershocks, and those strong aftershocks made those around, who were not strong enough, feel a sense of suffocating pain.

Not only could they not step in to interfere, even standing in their spots to watch the battle in situ was also very difficult!

This was a battle between two very strong Spirit Ring users!

Of course ...

Standing behind the crowd, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao could see the details of the battle between the two clearly.

Nangong Lie’s strength was obviously inferior to that of Bai Mo. Although he could be supported by his Spirit Ring for that moment, in the face of Bai Mo’s violent attacks, there were already indications that Nangong Lie was moving into a disadvantageous position.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes flashed.

Bai Mo grew more and more insane. The many years of suppressed frustration and powerlessness from the battle with Ye Jue seemed to have lingered in his heart like a constant nightmare. Thus, while battling Nangong Lie, he felt immense pleasure as his opponent was being driven more and more into desperate straits.

This made him increasingly out of hand!

He desperately wanted to prove his strength with blood and death!

Nangong Lie had already lost some strength. He didn’t expect Bai Mo to be so powerful, and what shocked him even more was that Bai Mo was intent on killing him, all his attacks were close to Nangong Lie’s vitals, it was evident that Bai Mo was not letting him go alive!
