Chapter 2575: Walking Right Into The Trap (3)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

If there was an axe in hand, those black clad Spirit Envoys would hack him to death!

Not fighting back?

Not escaping!

He’s here to create trouble!

As he looked at the black armoured Spirit Envoys nearing the mountain, Long Jiu didn’t hesitate as he turned tail and ran. Looking at the way he broke into a wild run, he no longer had that abusive attitude from just now.

The black armoured Spirit Envoys were spitting mad as they flew into a rage because of Long Jiu’s humiliation, as they shouted their murderous intents. They couldn’t manage more than a few lines because they lacked more curse words.

“Long Jiu! If you got guts, don’t run!”

“You better stop!”

“Dammit! Still running!”

Long Jiu ran on madly, even if the screams sounded one after another, he turned a deaf ear towards them as he ran at the fastest speed possible.

Although Long Jiu’s strength was not at the top of the Soul World, but he was also considered an exponent. Amongst those black armoured Spirit Envoys, there were some who are on par with Long Jiu. If they were to seriously engage in a fight, it would be difficult to win. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

But the problem was...

Long Jiu had no intention of fighting them. He kept dodging them in order to not give them a chance to close in on him. Once he was a little distance from them, he would stop, turn his head and shouted curses at them. Those black armoured Spirit Envoys following close behind would get so mad that their blood vessels were on the verge of bursting!

In the dark, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao were observing that scene of chaos. With regard to Long Jiu’s action, Jun Wu Xie was rather speechless.

“I didn’t think that...” Jun Wu Xie looked at Long Jiu who had stopped to curse at those Spirit Envoys once more, her expression was slightly confused.

She really didn’t think that the vocabulary of Long Jiu’s curses would be so rich. She still remembered that when she was in the evil domain, Long Jiu was not like this...who had he learnt this from?

Jun Wu Yao originally wanted Long Jiu to distract the black armoured Spirit Envoys but he didn’t expect that not only did Long Jiu fulfilled his task so well, he even.... Exceeded beyond Jun Wu Yao’s expectations.

“Don’t listen anymore.” Jun Wu Yao covered Jun Wu Xie’s ears with his hands.

The more Long Jiu cursed at them, the worse the words became. Although it was part of Jun Wu Xie’s plan, but Jun Wu Yao didn’t want those nasty words to taint Jun Wu Xie’s ears.

Jun Wu Xie lifted her head to Jun Wu Yao, helplessness in her eyes.

Long Jiu kept dodging the black armoured Spirit Envoys for a few days. They didn’t even touched the corner of his clothes, they no longer had the energy to chase after Long Jiu. At the beginning, they were cursing back loudly at Long Jiu, but now, they didn’t even have an interest in chasing after him. But, if they didn’t chase, Long Jiu would start cursing at them, he cursed at them until they were fuming mad and rushed at him.

The end was tragic....

On the seventh day, Long Jiu led more than a hundred black armoured Spirit Envoys on a wild goose chase, and those people finally couldn’t take it anymore.

“Lord Meng Qiu!!! That damn Long Jiu, our comrades are about to be tormented to death by him!” A black armoured Spirit Envoy, with tears and snot covering his face, kneeled before Meng Qiu as he accused Long Jiu of ‘many evil deeds’.

They were the actual traitors, but after meeting Long Jiu, they lived in agony as if they have met their fathers’ killer. In their hearts, they have considered Long Jiu to be the root of evil that needed to be vanquished.

Meng Qiu knitted his brows slightly as he looked at the Spirit Envoy who knelt at his feet. His calm face finally showed a little unhappiness.

“You can’t even capture him?” Meng Qiu’s face held mild anger. Long Jiu was his disciple, and Meng Qiu knew exactly what he was capable of.
