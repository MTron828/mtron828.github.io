“Even up till this day, you’re still seeking to use the Spirit Lord to deceive me? The Spirit Lord is benevolent and he would never allow the Spiritual Bear to be sacrificed to go build the Serene Spirit Tower!” Flame Dragon said with a sneer.

The Second Disciple then puffed up his chest and said: “I do not care whether you believe me or not. This is all carried out under the Spirit Lord’s orders. Your decision to hide that Spiritual Bear today and the fact that you wounded my Master today has doomed you to your fate!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I’ll be waiting for that!” Flame Dragon was not giving in an inch, and the stances of the Beast Spirits there were all ready for battle.The Second Disciple could no longer hold himself up against Flame Dragon and he could do nothing but to sweep his gaze over all the spirits present there.

“You win today! But you just wait! I will report all of this to the Spirit Lord and you have better not regret it at that time! Hmph!” The Second Disciple said vehemently, and then shouted out ruefully: “Let’s go!”

The bunch of human spirits retreated in a fluster, under the baleful gaze of all the Beast Spirits, which sent chills right through them. They all seemed to not dare stay there a single moment longer as they quickly disappeared without a trace in a blink.

It was only till all the human spirits had disappeared from sight that Flame Dragon could finally blow out a breath in relief.

Many of the Beast Spirits still were not completely clear about what was happening but looking at the Spiritual Bear, their hearts lifted in delight and subservient worship.

“Save Nalan Shan!” Brownie really could not be bothered with any of those ceremonial etiquette as it held up Nalan Shan, its eyes filled with anxiety.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head and went on to borrow Flame Dragon’s cave to quickly carry out treatment for Nalan Shan.

Flame Dragon took charge of tying up the loose ends as it made the necessary arrangements for all the Beast Spirits, ordering them all to always keep their guard up, against any sneak attacks from the human spirits and Weapons Spirits.

Nalan Shan’s injuries were grave. If Jun Wu Xie had not asked Brownie to use Spirit Reinforcement runes to stabilize Nalan Shan’s spirit, Nalan Shan’s spirit might have already scattered and dispersed by now.

Jun Wu Xie carved out the Spirit Reinforcement runes with her own hand and placed Nalan Shan inside the circle to absorb the power of the spirit, to replenish the deficiencies.

Several of the Plant Spirits who had stepped up to help them then came forward to greet Drunk Lotus and the others before they left without seeking any credit, but merely reminding them to be careful.

Brownie stood watch beside Nalan Shan, not stepping away from him at all. Its injuries were not that light as well but it stubbornly refused to budge. Even Jun Wu Xie could not do anything about it but just let Brownie did what it wanted.

“Whew! Today’s really exhilarating!” Qiao Chu exclaimed as he sat himself onto the ground, the sorry state of his body unable to cover over the excitement in his heart.

“Speaking of which..... What do we do with this fella?” Fei Yan asked as he nudged the unconscious Wu Jiu on the ground with the tip of his foot. Although he wanted for nothing more than to be able to slaughter that scoundrel who was absolutely overflowing with evil, they were afterall still in the Spirit World, and there were many things that they could not wilfully do as they wished.

“Hand him over to me.” Flame Dragon came in after it had finished up with business, its eyes filled with disgust as they gazed at Wu Jiu.

“Are you really intending to go ask the Spirit Lord?” Poison Ivy who was standing on the side asked with his brows creased, seemingly not all that approving of Flame Dragon’s intentions.

“This matter is beyond what I can decide upon. I need to ask the Spirit Lord to mete out the appropriate punishment. I shall go together with the Spiritual Bear tomorrow, and bring Wu Jiu with us to see the Spirit Lord. I shall report every single one of Wu Jiu’s deeds to the Spirit Lord, and follow the Spirit Lord’s orders from there. I am of the belief that the Spirit Lord will surely deliver justice to the Beast Spirits!” Flame Dragon was highly indignant and infuriated. It wasn’t that it did not want to have Wu Jiu killed, but although Wu Jiu was nefarious and hateful, he was afterall still the current leader of the human spirits. Killing him recklessly would only incite the conflict between the races to reach an irreconcilable stage. In any case, as Wu Jiu had committed such an evil deed, even if the Spirit Lord did not take his life, he would definitely not allow Wu Jiu to continue to hold the position of Spirit Master.

Poison Ivy knitted his brows together and seemed like he was going to say something. In the end, he was unable to put them into words.
