Chapter 95: “Second Slap (3)”

Bai Yun Xian stood biting her lip, unwilling to admit the authenticity of the Jade Dew pills, but it was now hard to refute with what Jun Wu Xie has schemed.

But, how was this possible?

Jun Wu Xie was just the Missy of Lin Palace, there was no way she knows the recipe for Jade Dew pill. It was impossible she can process and produce those Jade Dew pills! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Moreover, she achieved it in half a day! It was already unimaginable she produced a bottle of Jade Dew pills in such a short span of time, she made TWO bottles at that!

“Your furnace room is old and falling apart, and that wasted a lot of my time refining the pills.” Jun Wu Xie grumbled at Mo Qian Yuan.

Due to the furnace room being run down due to disuse and neglect, and much of the equipments left not functionable, Jun Wu Xie would have produced five instead of two measly bottles.

Mo Qian Yuan stifled his laughter at the thought of Bai Yun Xian declaring that the production of Jade Dew pills needed three to five days, and Jun Wu Xie’s nasty rebuke by producing two bottles within half a day. To add insult to injury, she now claims my furnace room is dilapidated and equipment spoilt, causing her delays in production, telling Bai Yun Xian that she is capable of more in ideal conditions?

This unspoken reprimand and innocent grumbling, had delivered another two slaps upon the face of Bai Yun Xian.

Such exhilaration! You could almost hear them!

Mo Qian Yuan finally understood Jun Wu Xie’s contempt for Jade Dew pills.

Bai Yun Xian’s praise for her unparalleled jeweled Jade Dew pills, in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, had turned to mere worthless rocks, being thrown upon the face of Bai Yun Xian.

“Jun Wu Xie, how did you come to know the recipe for Qing Yun Clan’s medicine!” Bai Yun Xian was seething with anger, as she had never been so humiliated.

Jun Wu Xie replied nonchalantly : “You need a recipe for this? You can tell just by smelling them.”

“ ..... “ Bai Yun Xian almost foamed at the mouth with her dismissive tone.

Mo Xuan Fei, sensing that the situation steering out of control, held Bai Yun Xian’s by her shoulder.

“We were just kidding today, it is getting late, we should go.” Mo Xuan Fei said abruptly, thinking they have been humiliated enough and staying any longer wouldl only embarrass them further.

“No hurry, my dear brother. Miss Bai has not verified the pills’ authenticity.” Mo Qian Yuan was unwilling to let him off easy.

Bai Yun Xian glared at Jun Wu Xie, murder in her eyes.

Struggling to find the words, she faintly mumbled: “Those pills are ..... Jade Dew pills.”

Those words seemed to have drained her completely as she stumbled, her legs giving out..

“Yun Xian!” Mo Xuan Fei rushed to hold her up, and through gritted teeth : “We shall not impose on you anymore, Yun Xian seems unwell, we will catch up again another day.”

Without waiting for Mo Qian Yuan’s reply, Mo Yuan Fei hastened out, holding Yun Xian up.

The eunuch bearing the gifts, confused, hurriedly hastened behind the Second Prince, to present the jewels.

When everyone has left, Mo Qian Yuan could not suppress his mirth anymore and laughed out heartily.

“Jun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Xie, you greatly surprise me, the humiliation you put my brother and Bai Yun Xian through today, it was a sight to behold! You withheld the truth in the beginning, luring them to sink in deeper by allowing them to brag more, before you dropped the axe. That was simply wicked! Ha ha ha.”

Jun Wu Xie glanced at Mo Qian Yuan laughing heartily, and thought to herself.

Wicked? I don’t think so.

The humiliation they suffered today was their own doing. Evil begets evil.

“But, your actions today will earn the wrath of the two of them.” warned Mo Qian Yuan.

“It’s bound to happen.” Jun Wu Xie lowered her eyes, hiding the lethal glance that flashed briefly in her eyes.
