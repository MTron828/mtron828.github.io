Chapter 1660: “Borrow to Use (3)”

Jun Wu Xie stared coldly at the bunch of youths who were on the verge of breaking into tears and she flippantly tossed a bottle of medicine at their feet.

“One pill each.”

The youths then wailed more pitifully.

The Shadow Moon Palace had absolutely no intention of giving the Pure Grace Palace any face at all and hence, they had sent out this bunch of youths with highly average powers who had just come into the palace recently. They were all merely in their teens and they had been so terror stricken by the bloody and gory scene before their eyes, so how could they still be able to think straight at that moment? When they saw the medicine bottle rolling at their feet, they immediately took it to be poison and they wailed out to the Heavens, thinking that they were sure to die this time.

Jun Wu Xie was getting an headache from the noise and her brows immediately furrowed up.

Suddenly, two black shadows leapt out from the shadows and they knocked the youths squatting on the ground and were wailing noisily out out one by one.

The noisy clamour immediately quietened down.

“Have them swallow the medicine.” Jun Wu Xie said.

Ye Sha and Ye Gu immediately picked up the medicine bottle and fed each youth one pill in their mouths.

Those were not any kind of poison, but something that Jun Wu Xie concocted that would confuse a person’s memories for a short period of time. She had merely intended to “borrow” the Shadow Moon Palace’s carriages and birthday gift to use and had not wanted to do anything against that bunch of rascals.

But that one who had first come down from the carriage had his face filled with contempt when he saw Jun Wu, and he had arrogantly stabbed at Jun Wu with his cutting words. Without waiting for Jun Wu Xie to say a word, Ye Gu had already sliced his neck.

In the end, it had frightened the youths who had come down after almost out of their wits.

After the youths had been properly dealt with and thrown into the bushes at the side, Jun Wu Xie stood before the horse carriage and stared at the tightly shut door.

“You want to come out on your own or do you want me to drag you out?” Jun Wu Xie’s voice was slightly chilly. She could sense that there was one more person within the carriage.

Moments later, a pale faced youth came walking slowly out from the carriage. The youth had eyes that was slightly different from normal people. They had an extremely light amber colour, very attractive looking but in that clear pair of eyes, there was no life in them.

The youth’s gaze swept indifferently over the pool of blood on the ground before they finally rested upon Jun Wu Xie.

“You want to kill people from the Shadow Moon Palace?” The youth opened his mouth to ask, his tone questioning.

Jun Wu Xie arched up an eyebrow. This youth had not been from the Cloudy Brook Academy. His aura was highly foreign, seemingly weak but in actuality powerful. Such a chaotic aura made Jun Wu Xie feel it to be rather strange but at that moment, she could not identify what was so strange about it.

“Then can you kill me?”

“.....” Jun Wu Xie widened her eyes slightly, as she stared at the youth who uttered such startling words. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

[Did he say..... kill him?]

Jun Wu Xie had seen her fair share of lunatics but had never seen one like this. One who did not resist nor struggle but instead beg for death.

“If you are an enemy of the Shadow Moon Palace, then just kill me. If you do not kill me, then I will definitely come kill you in future.” The youth said nonchalantly, his tone calm and unhurried, like he was speaking of something of no importance at all.

The moment the youth’s voice fell, the figure of Ye Gu had already soundlessly appeared behind the youth, and the dagger in his hand was already pressed against the back of the youth’s neck.

The youth felt the cold chill on the back of his neck and he calmly closed his eyes, seemingly awaiting the arrival of death.

[He really wasn’t going to resist?]

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly as she stared at the youth, and a strange feeling rose within her heart. A guess then suddenly grew in her mind.
