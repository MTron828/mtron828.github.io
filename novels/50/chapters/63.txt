Chapter 64: “The Banquet (6)”

Even if Qing Yun Clan’s Sovereign could not cure, who else is in this world could?

Bai Yun Xian’s diagnosis gave the Emperor a huge relief, he felt as though a huge boulder was lifted off his shoulders.

Jun Xian whispered his thanks with a pale face as he silently sank bank into his seat. Those with sharp eyes noted his hands holding onto his wine cup was trembling.

Looks like Jun Qing’s condition was really hopeless, look, even Jun Xian’s hands were shaking! Indeed his hands were trembling but it never crossed their minds that it was not due to grief but due to him holding back his own laughter.

If it wasn’t for the situation at hand, he could not wait to shout out to the whole world and tell them that his son’s poison had already been completely cleared by his brilliant granddaughter! Not only that, his son would soon be able to walk again! Qing Yun Clan...was simply.. to simply put it they were simply ****!!!

Just his granddaughter alone could clear the poison that the Qing Yun Clan’s Sovereign deemed hopeless, under the guidance of an esteemed master. This Bai Yun Xian actually had the audacity to say that her Master’s solution was the best and if he could not cure it, no one else could! Hmph!

Previously he had admired the Qing Yun Clan fervently, however after seeing with his own eyes how his granddaughter easily did what their Sovereign could not accomplish, he had lost all his respect for the clan and scoffed at them instead.

Other than his family’s Wu Xie, who else dares to say that they are best in the world?!

Jun Xian looked around at the reaction of the crowd and swore in his heart that after the comeback of his Lin Palace, he would make these guys know where they stand! He couldn’t wait to see their expressions after they knew the truth!

For now, he played a distraught man.

Jun Wu Xie simply admired her own grandfather and uncle for their acting skills and gave them full points.

After completing the task, Bai Yun Xian went back to the Second Prince’s side. He immediately looked at her gently and said: “Yun Xian, you’ve worked hard.”

Bai Yun Xian smiled sweetly back.

“You really are a romantic at heart dear brother, looks like your feelings run deep.” The silent Crown Prince suddenly spoke up, with a pair of sharp eyes staring intently at Mo Xuan Fei.

“Big Brother, you really know how to joke.” He did not know why his brother suddenly praised them.

“Well, I don’t know if this romantic you is a bit too irresponsible, favouring the new over the old is not the style of our Royal Family. Now here you are acting all lovey dovey with Miss Bai, have you ever thought about the feelings of others?” Mo Qian Yuan sneered.

Mo Xuan Fei’s face stiffened.

Even a fool knew what Mo Qing Yuan meant as all eyes subconsciously shifted to Jun Wu Xie who had been neglected the whole night.

The infamous lady in question was surprisingly really quiet tonight, if not for the Crown Prince mentioning her, everyone had almost forgotten about her presence.

Mo Xuan Fei and Jun Wu Xie were betrothed, however after the appearance of Bai Yun Xian, Mo Xuan Fei no longer met up much with Jun Wu Xie and not long ago, the Emperor even broke their engagement.

When their engagement was broken off, the incident sparked a major uproar that spread beyond the State of Qi. Everyone had been anticipating the trouble she would bring with her, however she had instead remained low-key and disappeared for such a long time. In fact, this was the first time people had seen her after that incident. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Although she was more beautiful now, somehow they felt that there was something different about her from the past.

In the whole country, it could be said that she was one of the finest beauties. However with her brash,fiery,rude and arrogant personality it conflicted with her outward appearance. Today she was sitting quietly in the corner made her seem like totally different person!

Misty ramblings: In the beginning it was emphasized that she was not a beauty however it changed after awhile. My guess is that... after she went through the whole lotus seed conditioning, her complexion had improved and she looked fresher too. In many other novels usually such changes will let them have virtually poreless skin almost akin to a baby’s skin. So think models without the photoshop and without makeup.

Also her demeanor is now different so the charisma she exudes now makes her more poise. And also she’s still growing, there’s this chinese saying “女人十八变” which if you do a search these are the literal :a girl changes eighteen times between childhood and womanhood (idiom) and not so literal: girl changes fast in physical appearance from childhood to adulthood.

Also, it had been emphasized over and over again how horrid the previous Wu Xie’s character was so perhaps her personality really was so bad that her beauty did not matter. No one wanted to have anything to do with her...
