When all the evidence heaped onto the Spirit Lord and overwhelmed him, the smile at the bottom of Situ Heng’s eyes almost became impossible to suppress.

A cold voice suddenly sounded.

“The soul would be ripped apart? Are you talking about me?”

The moment this familiar voice was heard, everyone in the room opened their eyes wide and immediately turned towards the source of the voice.

They didn’t know when the supposedly weak Jun Wu Xie who was lying on the bed had actually sat up. Although her body was still translucent, but her spirit was much better.

For a moment, everyone looked at Jun Wu Xie incredulously and the trace of laughter revealed on Situ Heng’s face was frozen the moment he saw her get up. He looked at her in disbelief, incredibly shocked by what he saw. He simply couldn’t believe it, how could she still speak in that condition?

Once the Soul Devourer attacked, the damage of the soul could not be determined. After being nourishment to the Soul Devourer, no souls could even muster up enough strength to even speak . Even their consciousness had long been devoured up by the Soul Devourer.

“Little Xie... you... are you all right?” Qiao Chu gulped loudly as he looked at her, bewildered.

“All right? Of course I am, should I not be?” Jun Wu Xie raised her eyebrows slightly.

Everyone looked at her without uttering a word. [Was this still considered all right? Haven’t you noticed how unstable the state of your soul has become? !]

It was as if she did not feel the piercing gazes of everyone when she suddenly raised her hand and peered at her translucent palm. She raised a brow and looked at the Spirit Lord.

“I think it should be all right now.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The sudden words spoken by Jun Wu Xie made everyone confused.

All right?

What was all right? !

The cornered Spirit Lord who was distraught just before vanished the very moment he saw Jun Wu Xie sit up. The originally furrowed brows had immediately smoothened out and a gentle smile bloomed from the corner of his mouth.

The Spirit Lord walked to the side of Jun Wu Xie under the gazes of everyone present and raised his hand to hold her wrist. He started to imbue his own soul power and bit by bit, it started to fill Jun Wu Xie’s weak soul.

In the blink of an eye, the translucent figure of Jun Wu Xie turned into an entity, exactly the same as when she entered the Spirit World. There was not a single trace of any weakness from before.

The huge change that just happened moments ago shocked everyone present and had them gape with their mouths wide open. They simply couldn’t understand what was going on.

Situ Heng was the only person whose face turned white in an instant!

He looked at Jun Wu Xie as her soul recovered unblinkingly, if he did not see it with his own eyes, he would never believe it.

How could this be?

Did the Soul Devourer not devour her soul?

Others may not have been able to see what the Spirit Lord had done, but for Situ Heng, Qin Song and Long Jiu, they were after all the souls from the Soul World. Towards matters of the soul, they were clearer about it more than anyone else.

There was no weakening at all, but by borrowing the power of the Spirit Lord, he had temporarily suppressed her soul power to a point that such a situation occurred. And this itself had no influence on her soul itself but it had caused the illusion that her soul power was continuously depleting!

Situ Heng couldn’t believe it at all! Everything that happened in front of him had completely spiraled out of his control from the moment Jun Wu Xie spoke.

There was no episode with the Soul Devourer, all that happened was just a play acted out by Jun Wu Xie and the Spirit Lord!
