Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

With such a one-sided situation occurring, Ah Da and Zheng Weilong, who were hiding in the forest, widened their eyes as they stared at everything on the battlefield.

“This is ... the power of Sea Spirit City?” Zheng Weilong had some difficulty breathing. She had previously guessed what Jun Wu Xie might have prepared, but she did not expect Jun Wu Xie’s counterattack had turned out to be so simple and brutal.

The strength of the Sea Spirit City had far exceeded Zheng Weilong’s expectations, a terrible idea appeared in her heart. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She had a hunch that even if the army of Discerning Moon City met these people from Sea Spirit City, they would not have much chance of winning.

“Ah Da, those in Sea Spirit City, their strength ...” Zheng Weilong turned to look at Ah Da, as she had no spiritual power, she could not tell what the strength of those in Sea Spirit City was, although just watching them defeat the Long Xuan City army, she felt that they were very powerful.

“Very strong,” Ah Da said dumbly.

“How strong?” Zheng Weilong couldn’t help asking.

Ah Da thought for a moment before saying: “If you replace the army of Long Xuan City with the army of Discerning Moon City, I am afraid that the situation will not be too optimistic as well.”

“What?” Zheng Weilong couldn’t help but take a sharp breath. She might have guessed it before, but after confirmation by Ah Da, she was still very surprised.

You know, the strength of Discerning Moon City can be ranked among the top within the 72 cities, but Ah Da had said that even if Discerning Moon City fought against these people in Sea Spirit City, the situation will not be any better.

Doesn’t this mean that the strength of the Sea Spirit City had already topped the 72 cities?

With Sea Spirit City’s past, this conclusion was really unacceptable.

“Their fighting strength may not be the most powerful, but their moves are very odd. I have observed the way they fight and found that there isn’t anything unnecessary with their fighting skills. Almost every move is life-ending move. “Ah Da replied.

“What do you mean?” Zheng Weilong asked cautiously.

“Although spiritual practitioners can rely on the level of spiritual power to determine the outcome, but how to maximize the use of spiritual power differs for each person. With the same level of spiritual power, how one makes a move will have great influence on the battle. Moreover, the weak might be able to defeat the strong. These people in Sea Spirit City use their spiritual powers with great efficiency and accuracy. As long as they hit their opponent, they are either dead or gravely injured. This fighting method is very effective, especially in terms of killing.” Ah Da frowned, it was clear that the strength of the Sea Spirit City had shocked him.

What kind of city was the Sea Spirit City? No one in the Upper Realm knew about it. Who would believe that in a remote and lowly city like this, such a powerful combat power was hidden?

It might come a day when the true strength of the Sea Spirit City would be exposed, and the ranking of the 72 cities would be rewritten!

Zheng Weilong turned her head and looked at the murderous battlefield unblinkingly. On the chaotic battlefield, the white figure still entangled with Ruan Zhongshan really attracted Zheng Weilong’s attention.

Even if she can’t perceive the spiritual power, she could clearly perceive that the strongest in the whole Sea Spirit City was the City Lord, Jun Wu Xie!

Zheng Weilong watched Ruan Zhongshan get kicked by Jun Wu Xie and flew. The once-proud City Lord of Long Xuan City was thrown to the ground like a clay, and he vomited a lot of blood ..
