Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

When the wine had been round three times, all the spirits were already drunk, collapsing and lying here and there. This was when the Spirit Lord got the time to ask Jun Wu Xie his questions.

“The three of them...” The Spirit Lord’s eyes fell on Qin Song, Long Jiu and Situ Heng who were seated beside Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie then gave the Spirit Lord a simple explanation regarding the purpose of Qin Song and the others following her to the Spirit World. Though, the shock received by the Spirit Lord after listening to her wasn’t as simple as that.

The seed of the Spirit Tree was actually inside Jun Wu Xie’s body?!!!

But... He couldn’t feel it at all!

“It has been a very long time since we met, everyone really misses you after you’ve left the Soul World.” Holding his glass of wine, Qin Song looked at the Spirit Lord and laughed cheerfully. The look in the Spirit Lord’s eyes changed slightly. There was a little sadness in them.

Qin Song’s words immediately attracted the attention of Qiao Chu and the rest, causing everyone to prick up their ears after being aware that there may be some gossip involved in the conversation.

This fella Qin Song was an old friend of the Spirit Lord! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Spirit Lord forced a smile and said. “There’s no point in missing me. It’s just that I’ve left for a trip. The Soul World is lively enough. It doesn’t really matter whether or not if I am there.”

“The Spirit Tree misses you very much,” sighed Qin Song.

The Spirit Lord shuddered. He didn’t respond but just drank sullenly.

On the other side, Qiao Chu was itching to know more about the conversation between Qin Song and the Spirit Lord but he couldn’t really get to know the exact details. Thus, he could only prod secretly at Long Jiu, who was pigging out on his meals, with his elbow. “You guys know the Spirit Lord?”

At that time, Long Jiu was eating heartily. Just to know that even though the Spirit World was more primitive than the Soul World, the spirits here knew how to really “enjoy their lives” as they had already went through all the vicissitudes in life. And for the Soul World? Where can you ever find this amount of delicious food to chow down?

“Uh? Yea... Yeah...” replied Long Jiu unclearly with his mouth full of food.

Of course Qiao Chu wasn’t satisfied with the response. He forced Long Jiu to swallow the food down quickly, feeling desperate to learn more about the inside stories.

Long Jiu and Qiao Chu often got along well with each other since they were both outgoing and straightforward people. As the quote said, birds of the same feather flock together, that would also mean that they were able to chat with each other without much reserve. Without thinking too much, Long Jiu then openly explained. “Isn’t it quite normal for us to know him? The Spirit Lord was formed from the seed borne by the Spirit Tree. He had been staying at the Soul World for way more longer time compared to Old Five and me. It’s just after that, all of a sudden, he said he wanted to go outside to explore the world. And he just simply left like that...”

Though Long Jiu narrated it all so casually, his words had made Jun Wu Xie who was listening stunned for a little. She looked at the Spirit Lord with astonishment in her eyes.

The Spirit Lord...

Even him was formed from the seed of the Spirit Tree?

Jun Wu Xie had heard the Spirit Lord mentioned before, that the fruits of the Spirit Tree were able to transform into spirits, but she didn’t know that... the seeds could also be cultivated similarly?

Long Jiu thought that he was whispering, but he didn’t realize that his voice was going to be so loud and clear after consuming alcohol. Not only Qiao Chu and Jun Wu Xie heard him, Qin Song and the Spirit Lord also heard vividly about what he had just said. At the moment, everyone sitting at the table went silent. The Spirit Lord frowned a bit and looked down while Qin Song too, glared at Long Jiu.

Long Jiu suddenly noticed that he had made an indiscretion. He drew back his neck and lowered down his head in a sense of guilt to finish his food.

“Since... The seed of the Spirit Tree is able to transform into spirit, why do you still insist on taking back the one in Little Xie?” Rong Ruo realized there was something wrong. If the seeds of the Spirit Tree was still going to turn into spirits at last, then what was the reason of Qin Song and the others working so hard to get back that one particular seed? Wasn’t it just a seed that hadn’t transform into a spirit?
