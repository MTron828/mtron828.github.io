After Jun Wu Xie left, Yan Wan let out a contemptuous smile, as Liang Shi Shi seized the opportunity to lie in his embrace and wrapped her arms flirtatiously around his neck.

“My Lord, the Young Master’s temperament might be difficult, but he is still young. Don’t bother about him.”

Yan Wan smirked, “Still young? He is not young anymore. Usually he has a lot of ideas, but when he meets me, he always puts on this attitude. He is so eccentric and peculiar, I can’t be bothered to see him.”

Yan Wan was very wary of Yan Hai, their father-son relationship was weak, he took more precaution against Yan Hai.

“My Lord, you may nag, but actually you are concerned about Young Master. If not, why did you arrange his voyage so well.” Liang Shi Shi said smilingly.

“Appropriate? Is it?” Yan Wan sneered, there was a trace of cold light reflected within his eyes.

The people of Sea Spirit City were very familiar with the Sea of Death, and they could more or less predict the situation at sea. Yan Wan knew earlier that this voyage would be besieged by storms, and he purposely arranged for Yan Hai’s maiden voyage to be during this time. If he was really concerned for Yan Hai, why would he choose this stormy season?

Liang Shi Shi was observing Yan Wan’s reactions silently, she was snickering in her heart. Who couldn’t tell that Yan Wan did not have any love for his son, and instead was filled with strong contempt and discriminated against him. Liang Shi Shi commented nonchalantly, “My Lord, you seem to not like the Young Master.”

“Why should I like him? He has never respected me, his father. Why should I like this sort of son? Since he was young, Yan Hai and I have never been closed. His character is exactly like that of his mother, ignorant and egotistical. If he didn’t inherit my innate cultivation talent, what does he count as?” Yan Wan sneered, his words were filled with disdain and abhorrence towards Yan Hai.

Liang Shi Shi smiled, “That is true, Young Master does not seem to take after you. If it was anyone else, it’s ok. But as the City’s Lord, your identity is special.... Young Master’s innate talent is pretty good and if he cultivated more. But what if he starts to have some bad intentions....” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Liang Shi Shi hadn’t finished her sentence, but Yan Wan comprehended what she was implying.

If it was an ordinary family, the indifference between the father and son would only be estrangement. But Yan Wan was the Lord of the Sea Spirit City; with Yan Hai’s feelings towards him, if Yan Hai was allowed to cultivate further, there would be a fierce battle.

“Ah, he already has this sort of intentions. Those miscellaneous ‘trash fish’ he has collected, he thinks he’s hidden it well and that I don’t know. But, I am well aware of what he is thinking about, what he wants to do. How can I not know?” Yan Wan gave a smug smile, the look in his eyes became sharp.

In the Upper Realm, in order to obtain a higher status, killing one’s own father or children is something that was not uncommon.

Liang Shishi had noticed the bad relationship between Yan Wan and Yan Hai, and she couldn’t help but laugh inwardly. Although she was married to Yan Wan, if Yan Hai was to rise to power abruptly, he would kill his father, what more her, a stepmother.

“If My Lord really doesn’t like him, there are many ways to tame him. Any cultivation method requires concentration and sufficient time. If there is a mistake, even if a genius won’t be able to achieve it. Now that Young Master has already been out to sea, why don’t you let him try to handle the affairs of Sea Spirit City?” Liang Shi Shi said.
