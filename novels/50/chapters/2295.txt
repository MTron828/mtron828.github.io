Qiao Chu made a sign of victory to Hua Yao and the rest and when they saw that, they finally let out a sigh of relief as they walked slowly over to Jun Wu Xie. They nodded to the Yin Yang Bear and only after that did it release its furry arms reluctantly.

“Welcome back.” Rong Ruo came forward and gave Jun Wu Xie a big hug. They were not good at expressing their feelings, more so under the burden of such immense guilt. Fortunately, amongst them, there was one person who had thick skin and was shameless enough to resolve the awkwardness between them.

“Welcome back.” Fei Yan took a step forward and reached out to her both Jun Wu Xie and Rong Ruo.

Hua Yao and Fan Zhuo also walked towards them and with a goofy smile on each of their faces, they reached out and embraced their companion who had been missing for five years.

“There’s still me! Little Xie! Welcome back!” Qiao Chu wiped off his tears as he leapt onto all of them.

In a flash, six companions were huddled together without saying anything more, but they were all locked in a gentle but firm hug as they all just silently unburdened themselves from the pain of separation for five years.

Long Qi stood by and looked at the trusted aides that surrounded Jun Wu Xie as the corner of his lips curled up unknowingly into a smile filled with gratification. He followed the orders of Jun Wu Xie and had intentionally leaked the news to the Nine Temples but he had also secretly leaked the same message to the Rui Lin Army. What he had hoped for had happened exactly.

Young Miss had suffered bitterly for five years and she had beared the burden all by herself. Although he, Ye Mei, Ye Gu and Night Regime had tried their best, but could not pry open her closely shut heart. He knew that she needed Qiao Chu and the others, she needed this bunch of companions who had gone through life and death together.

It was a heartwarming reunion as they all wept together and this group of youths had matured and transformed into outstanding individuals over the years of tempering. They had became stronger and more reliable as they guarded that unwavering belief in their hearts. They had grown up in the midst of despair.

All their eyes were red rimmed as they tried to hold back the tears that threatened to fall again once more, as they felt a wave of relief wash over them.

Long Qi entered the city with the Rui Lin Army. One after another sounds of muffled sobbing from the stalwart men behind him could faintly be heard as they stealthily wiped off their tears and looked at Jun Wu Xie.

Their Young Miss was back.

Long Qi and Ye Sha looked at each other and nodded their heads slightly. Both of them were clever men and knowing that everything today was the arrangement of Ye Sha, Long Qi was filled with gratitude towards him. No matter how Jun Wu Xie had passed the five years, at least Ye Sha and the rest had accompanied her and she was not entirely alone, at least there were people that cared for her and was guarding her by her side. This was enough.

Not wanting to disrupt the rare warmth that Jun Wu Xie had, Ye Sha silently let Su Jing Yan bring the traumatized survivors of the Nine Temples leave. Jun Wu Xie had changed, she was colder and had became more ruthless. However, her heart remained or else Su Jing Yan and the rest would not have possibly survived.

Filled with gratitude and expectations for the future, Su Jing Yan left with the survivors and when they reached the city gates, he could not help but turn around and looked at her being surrounded in an embrace by the people around her. The uneasiness and fear in his heart had slowly started to dissipate.

He had a hunch that in the near future, Jun Wu Xie would definitely sweep the Upper Realm with a torrential storm and who had brought about her suffering from that year would pay a painful price.

Upper Realm, are you ready?

Are you ready to meet the revenge of Jun Wu Xie head on?
