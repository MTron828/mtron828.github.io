Chapter 2991 Strange Ying 4

The residence that the ghoul masked man arranged for Jun Wu Xie was as creepy as Su Ruiying. In the large room, only a candlelight was lit. The room was empty. No one lived here.

“Two of you please rest here. If there are no other matters, please don’t walk around the house at night.” The hoarse voice of the ghoul masked man urged.

Jun Wu Xie nodded. After the ghoul masked man left, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao looked carefully at everything in the room.

Although the lights were dim, their strength could let them see everything around them in the dark room.

The furnishings in the room were complete.The most special was the standing doll on the table. The doll was a young woman with extremely finely carved facial features and long black hair scattered behind her body. It was placed on the table with a kneeling posture. The table was just opposite one of the beds in the room.

“This doll is a little weird.” Jun Wu Yao looked at the doll. Not only Jun Wu Xie thought Su Ruiying was strange, she also noticed her breath was not like an ordinary person, to be more precise, it was more towards a ghost’s than a human’s.

Jun Wu Xie walked to the table and picked up the puppet. The puppet was not heavy, but it had some weight in her hand. Jun Wu Xie’s fingertips brushed the puppet’s delicate facial features. The touch underneath made the eyes of Jun Wu Xie suddenly widen.

“Human skin.”

An unusually soft touch. Only human skin would feel this way. As a doctor, Jun Wu Xie had a clearer understanding than anyone.

It was just that brief contact that made Jun Wu Xie realize that the well-made puppet in front of her was simply created with human skin. That was why it would be so vivid and delicate! ! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In addition to the skin, the doll’s hair was also made up with human hair.

Obviously a delicate little doll. But now, it made people feel a little creepy.

Jun Wu Xie’s eyes narrowed slightly, remembering so many dolls placed on the table of Su Ruiying before. Back then, a wealthy businessman liked to collect human organs. He put those organs in a bottle and placed them in his home like fine pieces of art.

And Su Ruiying’s hobby was to use parts of the human body to create these dolls.

Just when Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao planned to take a closer look at this puppet, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Jun Wu Yao’s gaze fleeted to the door as he quickly went to open it.

But outside that door, it was empty. Not even a ghost of a shadow could not be seen, only the moonlight that illuminated the courtyard.

But that knock on the door should not be wrong ...

“Someone?” Jun Wu Xie also came over. She didn’t feel anybody’s breath.

“Shall we take a look?” Jun Wu Yao cautiously spoke. Now that they had come this far, they had to be extremely careful every step of the way. The strangeness of Su Ruiying and the house made them raise a lot of queries in their hearts and with the level of their skills, even if they left, the people here would not notice their absence at all.

Jun Wu Xie nodded her head. She wanted to put the puppet back in place, but after she thought about it. She put the puppet into her cosmos sack that was at her waist pocket instead.
