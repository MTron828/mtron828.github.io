“Mn.” Jun Wu Yao admitted it easily.

Although he had admitted it in such a casual and straightforward manner, countless turbid waves stirred up within Jun Wu Xie’s eyes.

“Leave now.” Jun Wu Xie immediately said.

Jun Wu Yao’s hand suddenly stopped and he slightly raised his head as that pair of violet eyes met hers that sparkled under the radiance of the moonlight.

“I can’t leave.”

“I don’t need you here. You have to leave immediately.” For the first time ever, Jun Wu Xie’s voice was tense and there was even a trace of anxiety mixed in.

Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms was the ultimate goal of the Upper Realm. The most important thing that they need for it to succeed was the Otherworldly Soul and that was Jun Wu Yao! In the Cloudy Brook Academy, there were a thousand Gold Spirits! Even if she believed in his abilities, however against such a large number of powerful enemies, there was no guarantee that an accident wouldn’t occur. After all, this was a trap set for the little old man who was similarly powerful.

Jun Wu Xie was certain that once the people from the Upper Realm was in the vicinity, they would rather give up the pursuit of the little man and would risk it all to catch Jun Wu Yao!

“Are you worried about me?” Jun Wu Yao laughed lightly as his enchanting eyes looked at her, reflecting a deep smile in his eyes.

“That time that you were locked up in the Lower Realm, was their doing?” Jun Wu Xie glazed over his question and asked him instead.

“Yes, that’s right.” Jun Wu Yao shrugged, in his eyes, a thousand years of captivity was insignificant.

However, the more he trivialised the matter, the deeper her heart sank.

No matter how much he played the matter down, he could not dispute the fact that he had once lost in the hands of the Upper Realm. Yes, it was true that Jun Wu Xie wanted to rescue Su Ya but she had no intention of exchanging Jun Wu Yao. She was not willing to give up any of them.

“Little Xie, the current you is still not able to face the Upper Realm as your opponent. If I were to leave and you still insist on saving your Master, you won’t be able to save her.” It was the first time that Jun Wu Yao had said such ruthless words to her.

Jun Wu Xie was strong, for her age and the environment she grew up in, she was already a heaven defying existence.

However, the enemies that she was facing now were not just any ordinary people but people of the Upper Realms. She was still too young and had insufficient experience. How could she contend against them?

A trace of self loathe flashed by her eyes. It was not the words of Jun Wu Yao but it was the incompetency that she felt from the depths of her heart. She once vowed that she would become stronger, strong enough to be able to stand by his side with him. At that time, she would no longer need to worry about being unable to fight against his enemies, but the time had came too soon and too suddenly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What Jun Wu Yao said was the cold hard truth, even if she had a few trump cards, but to contend against a thousand Gold Spirits, even if she used them all, it was still a fruitless attempt. Moreover, those people did not even leave the loft making it harder for Jun Wu Xie to come up with any viable plans.

If they wanted to save Su Ya, it was imperative for Jun Wu Yao to strike as well. If he did not participate in this, Su Ya would only have one ending and that would be death!

Never before had Jun Wu Xie ever encountered such a precarious situation that needed to make such a heart rendering choice.

Making a choice was the last thing she wanted to do.

Jun Wu Yao suddenly reached out and pulled the frowning Jun Wu Xie into his arms as he whispered gently: “Don’t worry, ever since I have left the cave, they have long known that I had escaped. All these years, never had they once given up on hunting me down, so even if I do not show up today, the hunt for me would never stop.”
