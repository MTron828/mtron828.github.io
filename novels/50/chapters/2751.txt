Chapter 2752: Banquet of Heroes (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

At the Banquet of Heroes that year, the 72 City Lords and deputies were invited to go and no one was absent during the heyday of White Night City. Following the banquet, the lord of White Night City passed away due to illness and Bai Zhu took over the ownership of the city. At that time, he was still young and although he was extremely talented and powerful, he did not have the domineering nature of his father to suppress the 72 cities. He had weathered a lot of storms, received countless challenges and assassination attempts. After a hundred years, White Night City was finally stable again.

However, because of the century of depletion, White Night City was no longer flourishing and no one there had the ability to host a Banquet of Heroes.

Who would have thought that a thousand years later, another Banquet of Heroes would be hosted by the little City Lord of Sea Spirit City?

If this had happened a thousands of years ago, Sea Spirit City would have become the biggest joke within the 72 cities.

“Even if the Sea Spirit City is not worthy of hosting the Banquet of Heroes, this matter has already been settled. I have heard news that the cities led by White Night City have already taken action. They have brought tributes with them to Sea Spirit City, and with them leading the way, the other cities will also attend the banquet. Sea Spirit City now is different from the Sea Spirit City of the past.” The City Lord of Hidden Demon City frowned, he always felt a bit off about the sudden rise Sea Spirit City, but he couldn’t pinpoint what was exactly wrong.

“If they want to go, then go! I am not going! This piece of shit Sea Spirit City! When Yan Wan was still around, he was just a piece of waste carrying my shoes. Now that his son has replaced him, and I have to go attend the Banquet of Heroes in Sea Spirit City? He’s such a big shot huh!” The City Lord of Epic Vesper City growled through gritted teeth.

Guan Hu was the most trusted confidant of Epic Vesper’s City Lord, thus he was sent as the representative to Sea Spirit City. Who knew that Jun Wu Xie would be so bold as to chop off Guan Hu’s head. This caused Epic Vesper City’s Lord to hate Jun Wu Xie to the bone.

There was a saying that to beat the dog, one also had to find out who was its master. Jun Wu Xie killed the ‘dogs’ from the Five City Coalition, and that was tantamount to slapping the five cities on their faces in front of everyone. How could he swallow this indignity?

The Heaven Fiend City Lord looked at Nangong Yan with a somber face as he hesitated for a moment before he said, “Did you find out? Is White Night City supporting Sea Spirit City from the back? If so, then this Banquet of Heroes, we really have to go.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Nangong Yan frowned, “Based on current information, it is still uncertain. The rumours from outside are saying that the envoy of White Night City was driven out by that Yan Hai kid, but that did not anger White Night City. Even this Banquet of Heroes, they have encouraged those cities who are in alliance with them to go. I am still confused. If there is no alliance between them, then why is White Night City giving many courtesies to Sea Spirit City? If it is an alliance, how can Sea Spirit City simply expel the White Night City from its grounds? ”

Nangong Yan had thought about this for a few days, but couldn’t figure out anything.

White Night City has very tight defense, so they have not been able to successfully send spies into White Night City.

“I think ... they don’t have an alliance.” the Hidden Demon City Lord said.

“Oh? Why do you say that?” Nangong Yan raised his eyebrows slightly.

“If it is truly an alliance, with the status of Sea Spirit City, you still cannot get White Night City to give it so much respect. The reason is because White Night City has the intention to entice Sea Spirit City, but Sea Spirit City is not agreeable to it. That’s why the smiling tiger, Bai Zhu, is ‘showing’ respect for the wise.” The Hidden Demon City Lord replied.
