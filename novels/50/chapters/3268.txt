Chapter 1858: “Jun Wu Xie’s Revenge (7)” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

That day, Elder Ying went to seek an audience with the Shadow Moon Palace Lord about the destruction in Hill City, speaking frankly of the shock and rage he felt and he went on to state that he was willing to conduct a full investigation into the entire incident. Moreover, he went on to say that as Yue Yi had gone missing, Elder Yue being his “grandfather” would be swayed by emotions and he requested for the Shadow Moon Palace Lord to hand over the matter to him to deal with.

The Shadow Moon Palace Lord was initially still a little hesitant, but after hearing that Yue Ye had fallen ill from heartbreak and was being placed into Jun Wu Xie’s residence for them to allow Yue Ye to recover, the Shadow Moon Palace Lord then made a firm decision.

He decided to hand the entire matter at Hill City over to Elder Ying fully, and also bestowed upon Elder Ying a certain level of authourity.

When Elder Yue knew about it, he was greatly shocked.

The Hill City’s incident implicated many other things. Once it was handed over to Elder Ying, it would definitely take away a certain portion of the authourity and power he wielded. At that moment, Elder Yue became as anxious as ants on a hot pan as he had wanted to deal with the matter but was now unable to do it due to the Shadow Moon Palace Lord’s displeasure towards him.

“Damn it. What is Elder Ying really trying to do?” Elder Yue muttered as he sat in his room with a dark expression on his face.

“Elder Yue, the Lord has already decided to hand over the Hill City’s incident over to Elder Ying together with the control of some of the branches surrounding the Hill City as well. What do you think we should do now?” A trusted aide of Elder Yue’s could not help but begin to worry.

“I would like to see what he can come up with.” Elder Yue said with a cold laugh. The entire incident in the Hill City had all been engineered by him all along and there hadn’t been any troublemakers stirring up trouble there at all. He did not believe that Elder Ying would really be able to resolve the matter at all!

“Yue Ye seemed to have fallen ill from the shock and she had been sent to Chang Huan’s residence.....”

Elder Yue’s brows creased up. “I had really underestimated that little wench. Never have I ever thought that she is in cahoots with Chang Huan. I should have noticed it when she had bit the hand that fed her back then. Chang Huan is Elder Ying’s disciple and that little wench truly knows how to use people, to be able to realize that the only person that was able to stand against me was Elder Ying, but she is afterall still too green. She might be able to hide for a time, but it won’t be forever. I shall wait and see how long she can hold out until, unless she has no intentions of saving her brother.”

“But now that she has gone to hide in Chang Huan’s place, we have no way of seeking her out. So the matter with Yue Yi.....”

“There’s no need to fret. Elder Ying is pouncing onto my mistake and seeking to checkmate me this time. Unfortunately for him, he does not know that the entire incident in Hill City was all just a plot I engineered. There is no way he will be able to produce any result. He took the initiative to go ask the Palace Lord to let him deal with the matter and if he comes out empty handed, I would then like to see how he’s going to answer for it. You go get all those people in Hill City to withdraw. Do not give him a single opportunity. Once he messes up with the way he handled this matter, he would naturally lose all face before the Palace Lord and I will then take over thereafter, to give the Palace Lord his answer. The gap between him and me will then widen, and he will not be able to shield Yue Ye anymore.” Elder Yue’s eyes narrowed up slightly, flashing with a cold venomous glint.

“He is protecting that little wench, doesn’t he know that that little wench is an insatiable white eyed wolf, just a heartless ingrate? With Yue Yi in my hands, Yue Ye will not be able to escape. When that times comes, I will have Elder Ying know just how dangerous keeping a white eyed wolf by his side really is.”

“With Elder’s divine strategy, Elder Ying would never be a match for you.” The disciple immediately hurried to butter Elder Yue up.

Elder Yue laughed, feeling highly pleased with himself as he said: “Alright. You do not need to worry too much about this. I’d rather you go take a look at Yue Yi, and also prepare a “little gift” for Yue Ye on the way, in case she has forgotten about her elder brother.”
