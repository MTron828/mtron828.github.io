Ye Sha and Ye Mei immediately helped Jun Wu Yao to the side room to rest.

“Let Ye Jie take care of Little Xie.”

“Yes.” Ye Sha immediately went to find Ye Jie.

Ye Mei was beyond anxious as the life and death worm is a rare, poisonous intestinal parasite which needed a special kind of employment. It was smelted using a locust that involved the soul. It suppressed one’s strength, and also temporarily sealed the soul.

On normal days there would not be any abnormalities, but once the soul power was activated, it would trigger the poison and cause an attack.

Jun Wu Yao had always known the special characteristics of the life and death worm, so even though his strength might be suppressed, he would not use his soul power.

The attack of the life and death worm this time caused Ye Mei to be incessantly worried. Once the life and death worm has been activated, it would enter an insane state of attack. Even if Jun Wu Yao didn’t use his soul power in the future, this kind of agony will continue for a long time, and it would cause great damage to his body.

“Lord Jue, what exactly happened? Why did you.... Use your soul power?” Ye Mei frowned hard with worry.

Jun Wu Yao did not reply as he was trying his best to control the intense pain that was wrecking throughout his whole body. The pain he was experiencing was vastly different to a physical pain as it came from the soul. It was indescribable and the soul pain made one even more helpless compared to physical pain.

The hand upon the table was clenched tight into a fist, so tight that his veins and bones stood out stark white.

Jun Wu Yao had experienced this sort of pain when he was administered the poison and in the thousand years since, to experience the pain once again, it was a hundred times more painful than before.

Ye Mei stood aside not knowing what he could do. Once the life and death worm was activated, there was no other way to suppress or control it. There was only one such poison within the Three Realms and it so happened that it was planted within Jun Wu Yao’s body.

“Don’t tell her.” Jun Wu Yao’s lips were bloodlessly pale. That offending trail of blood by the side of his mouth was wiped clean by his hand, his voice trembled as he spoke.

“Your subordinate understands. Lord Jue, don’t speak anymore.” The eyes of Ye Mei were rimmed red as he realized how truly powerless they were in the face of the life and death worm.

Jun Wu Yao waved his hand and Ye Mei retired.

Once the life and death worm broke out, no one could help him. He had to withstand the first round of attack, failing which, his strength would once again be largely damaged.

Ye Mei did not utter a word as he silently retreated from the room.

Once exited, Ye Mei stood outside the room looking sad and dreary.

Ye Sha returned once he had instructed Ye Jie to attend to Jun Wu Xie. Upon reaching the room, he saw Ye Mei standing outside with his face so unsightly, the two of them exchanged a glance but did not speak.

Who would have thought, just yesterday was the grand wedding ceremony, and today, Jun Wu Yao’s life and death worm would be activated. They were very clear that Jun Wu Yao had endured the intense pain as he left the wedding chamber so that Jun Wu Xie could not discover his strange behaviour. No matter what, they didn’t dare to recount a single word of what happened to Jun Wu Xie.

Ye Jie followed Jun Wu Yao’s instruction and went to attend to Jun Wu Xie. When he first entered the room, he saw the water on the bathroom floor, and as he looked up, he saw that Jun Wu Xie was perched on the edge of the bed, wearing a single piece of unlined garment.

“Young Miss?” Ye Jie watched Jun Wu Xie, and wondered why she felt that Jun Wu Xie’s face held some strangeness. Her face was obviously fair, but somehow it felt like within that fairness, there was also a wanness that was brought on by some illness.

“Hmm?” Jun Wu Xie lifted her eyes and looked towards Ye Jie.

“Lord Jue told me to attend to you.” replied Ye Jie.
