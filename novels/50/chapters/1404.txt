Chapter 1405: “Iron Empress (3)”

Besides Jun Wu Xie inside the great hall, Jun Wu Yao, Qiao Chu and the rest of the gang were standing on the side. Qu Ling Yue’s gaze slowly swung over the few of them and nodded slightly, in a show of greeting.

Qiao Chu looked at Qu Ling Yue who had undergone a complete transformation over the past year and his mind suddenly could not seem to process it quickly enough as he turned his head around to whisper softly beside Hua Yao’s ear: “This is that same little lass from the Thousand Beast City? Why do I feel she has become a completely different person?”

The change that had come over Qu Ling Yue was just too great and Qiao Chu should not be blamed for his shocked reaction as even Hua Yao and the others could clearly detect the tremendous change that had come over Qu Ling Yue.

“Little Xie’s judgement of her had been right.” Hua Yao said softly.

Qiao Chu quickly nodded vehemently in agreement.

Qu Ling Yue only managed to suppress her highly excited heart after much effort. She wanted so much to ask how Jun Wu Xie had been the past one year and whether she was fine, but she was unable to put it into words. She was silent for a while before she said: “Your Majesty’s purpose in returning to the palace, is regarding the matter with the monsters?”

Jun Wu Xie nodded slightly. “That’s right.”

Qu Ling Yue immediately understood and did not say anything else but just clapped her hands together. The palace attendants who had been waiting outside then brought in all the scrolls she had prepared before coming here. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“All these records the movements of the monsters in the past one year and I implore for Your Majesty take a look at them.” Without the slightest bit of conventional greetings and a single tedious question, Qu Ling Yue efficiently presented the information Jun Wu Xie needed the most without a fuss.

Those scrolls were delivered into Jun Wu Xie’s hands and with Jun Wu Xie’s photographic memory which remembered all she saw, scanning through all of them did not take much out of her.

Every single scroll was clearly categorized and it recorded in detail the place the Poison Men first appeared and all the places every time the Poison Men army launched a battle. The records included the number of Poison Men and the losses of both sides for those battles, every single one of those graceful characters in those small and intricate lines, all penned by Qu Ling Yue herself. The Fire Country’s information network spans all over the place and Qu Ling Yue had gathered all the the information pertaining to the Poison Men together to arrange and mark them out systematically, that allowed Jun Wu Xie to understand them all with just one glance through them.

“The countries that the Poison Men first appeared in, are all countries that the Condor Country had invited back then. Your Lady has heard that the Condor Country’s Imperial Capital had possessed something evil that was able to alter the constitution of a human. But according to the investigations Your Lady has carried out, these Poison Men had not been created from the remnant forces of the Condor Country. But even they were not, it would most certainly still be linked to the Condor Country in some way.” Qu Ling Yue said in a clear voice.

Jun Wu Xie saw upon the scrolls, the row upon row of numbers specifying the number of deaths, and she quickly discovered that any place that had the Buckwheat Kingdom, the Fire Country or the Qi Kingdom as reinforcements, the death toll of the side friendly to them were controlled within an acceptable range, much better than she had previously thought.

“In all the places that the Fire Country, the Qi Kingdom and the Buckwheat Kingdom had soldiers in, the number of battles carried out there are significantly reduced. Have all of you discovered a way to deal with those Poison Men?” Jun Wu Xie asked as she looked at Qu Ling Yue. She believed in the prowess of the armies in the Fire Country and the Qi Kingdom, but if even the places where reinforcements from the Buckwheat Kingdom were showed the same phenomenon, it then became somewhat inconceivable.

Afterall, the Buckwheat Kingdom did not have a firm foundation and did not possess a ferocious attack force like the Rui Lin Army, hence, the prowess they were showing was rather surprising.

Qu Ling Yue stared slightly surprised at Jun Wu Xie and after a moment of stunned bafflement, she suddenly gave a light laugh. Her face flushed faintly pink and she looked at Jun Wu Xie to say.

“Has Your Majesty forgotten?”

“What?” Jun Wu Xie asked in puzzlement.

“That thing that Your Majesty left behind before.” Qu Ling Yue said with a smile.
