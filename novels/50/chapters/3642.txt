In her choked voice, there was a never heard before desperate plea mixed in. Death was inevitable, even she could not escape it. However, Yan Bu Gui still had a chance to survive, but that would all be gone if he stayed behind.

Su Ya knew that her current condition was not able to withstand any battle, she did not even have the strength to escape. With the strong enemy that they were facing, she was just a burden, she no longer had any chance for survival. Yan Bu Gui should put her down.

Yan Bu Gui gnashed his teeth, the excruciating pain he felt almost caused him to faint countless times. However, the person in his arms had spurred him on and forced him to maintain his consciousness time and time again. A huge gush of blood flowed out from his mouth, flowed down his chin and started to flow all over Su Ya. His blood was scalding with desperation.

“I will never ever let go again, never ever......”Yan Bu Gui squeezed out the words that were in the depths of his heart. He knew that he was not opponent of these Gold Spirits and he could only use his own strength to protect his beloved woman. Although he may not be strong enough, but he was not willing to be a coward again.

Even if it leads to death, he would never ever let go!

“I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’ve made you wait for all these years, I’ve made you complain all these years... I had thought that I would... I would be able to compensate you... But I’m too weak, too useless... Sorry... Ya’er.. I’m sorry...” Under the constant flurry of attacks, the heart-rending pain was so intense that his body started to convulse. However, no matter what, he had not loosened his grip on Su Ya one bit. He tried his best to suppress the convulsions to not let Su Ya find out the pain he was in. But it was too painful ... So painful that his lips had turned purple, and no matter how hard he gritted his teeth, he was not able to restrain the convulsions.

Yan Bu Gui could clearly feel that his spine had been broken and he could not hold on for long...

He could be a waste, but he was not willing to be a coward!

Even if there was only a chance of one in ten thousand, he was also willing to bet on it, he would give it his all in exchange for her to live on. Even if it was just a tiny sliver of hope, he was willing!

Jun Wu Xie witnessed all the tragedies before her very own eyes, everything had happened in the blink of an eye. The speed of these Gold Spirits were almost impossible to follow, and they were carrying out a massacre without any mercy.

As Luo Qingcheng had mentioned earlier, other than Jun Wu Yao, they were to kill the rest!

The movements of these Gold Spirits were too fast, while Jun Wu Xie and the rest were all riddled with injuries. Recuperating for a few days was not enough...

“Little Wu Xie, once you find a chance you have to go! Today, it is imperative that you escape, you cannot strike them head on, we are not their opponents!” Ren Huang was upholding the promise made with Jun Wu Yao, as he continued to fight off the black robed men. However, the number of black robed men only increased and he was soon caught in a stalemate.

All Ren Huang could see was only a group of black robed men, he could not even see the situation outside.

However, even if he could not see, he was very clear that since Luo Qingcheng had given such an order, these people here would have no mercy.

Jun Wu Xie remained silent as she only used the Face of Selvan to contend against those Gold Spirits. She had still not recovered from her injuries and she could not withstand dealing with them directly. She could only rely on the flexibility of the Face of Selvan to avoid those fierce and deadly attacks.

Her gaze swept across the battlefield, she could no longer see the figure of Jun Wu Yao. Only thing that she could see was the tight encirclement.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
