Chapter 94: “Second Slap (2)”

He could not allow Jun Wu Xie to triumph, as long as he got to Imperial Father first, have Imperial Father instruct the Royal Doctors to declare that the Jade Dew pills were fake, Jun Wu Xie shall suffer his wrath!

Dragged along by Mo Xuan Fei, Bai Yun Xian abandoned her usual contrived poise in her haste. It is clear if the Royal Doctors are to verify the Jade Dew pills as the real deal, she will suffer utter disgrace and humiliation.

Jun Wu Xie sat there watching Mo Xuan Fei’s dramatic antics, making no move to stop him.

With Jun Wu Xie’s inaction, Mo Qian Yuan jeered after the departing figures.

“Second Brother, why the hurry? If there are issue with the pills, the Royal Doctors will not allow medicine of dubious origins to reach our Imperial Father.” Mo Qian Yuan taunted with a smile at the flustered Mo Xuan Fei, in return for the oppression suffered at the hands of Mo Xuan Fei all this time, freeing the heavy knot in his chest.

Being helpless himself against Mo Xuan Fei, it was a grand sight to behold seeing Jun Wu Xie’s resounding ‘slap’ on Mo Xuan Fei. That felt really good!

Mo Xuan Fei was in no mood to bicker with Mo Qian Yuan, he just needed an excuse to leave quickly. Irregardless whether he can stop the Royal Doctors, as long as he leaves the Crown Prince Residence now, he could pretend that none of today’s events ever happened and salvage some dignity for Bai Yun Xian and him.

Alas, the Heavens seemed to be against Mo Xuan Fei. Before he could scamper out of the Crown Prince Residence, two palace eunuchs scurried forward, carrying a tray of jewels, wide smiles across their faces.

“Your Highness, Miss Bai, I was thinking I will find you here. The Jade Dew pills from Miss Bai have been received and His Majesty has gifted these jewels for Miss Bai’s pleasure.” The eunuch bearing the gifts was His Majesty’s personal senior eunuch, obsequiously smiling.

“What did you say?” Mo Xuan Fei could not believe his ears.

The eunuch was somewhat taken aback by Mo Xuan Fei grim expression, and stammered.

“Hi ...... His Majesty, ordered your ..... lowly servant ...... to send these gifts over......”

“You said Yun Xian sent the pills to Imperial Father?” Mo Xuan Fei stared, eyes wide in astonishment, Bai Yun Xian paled further, blood drained from her face.

The eunuch did not know what to make of the situation, Jade Dew pills are exclusive to the Qing Yun Clan, they must have been sent by Bai Yun Xian. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Mo Qian Yuan looked on at the stupefied people by his doorway, his mouth curled up in scorn, and turned to see Jun Wu Xie, calmly head lowered, still sipping her tea.

Jun Wu Xie had known Mo Xuan Fei would develop cold feet, and weasel his way out. She secretly sent the pills to His Majesty and sent it under Bai Yun Xian’s name! The Emperor, to garner support from Qing Yun Clan, will gift in return, oblivious to the fact that will cut off his way out of this mess.

With the gifts here, it just showed that the pills sent by Jun Wu Xie have been verified by the Royal Doctors, and conveyed to the Emperor.

It is now clear, whether those Jade Dew Pills were genuine.

The eunuch’s uncanny timing with his arrival bearing the gifts, did not give Mo Xuan Fei any wiggling room.

“Jun Wu Xie, you dare deceive His Majesty! Those pills were clearly not from Yun Xian!” Mo Xuan Fei eyes full of malice, refusing to be toyed around by Jun Wu Xie, a woman he once abandoned, it was intolerable.

Jun Wu Xie slightly raised an eyebrow, “It belongs to her.”

“What nonsense!”

Jun Wu Xie said indifferently: “Replacement for the bottle my cat broke.”

She had assured, she will compensate Bai Yun Xian for the Jade Dew pills.

“The result is plain to see, Bai Yun Xian, your conclusion?” Jun Wu Xie fixed her frosty gaze upon the pale quivering frame of Bai Yun Xian.
