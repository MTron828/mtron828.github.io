3075 The Final Battle 3

“You knew I was coming a long time ago.” Jun Wu Xie stared at the God of Destruction unflinchingly. She was intelligent but she had misjudged her opponent. She could deal with people with confidence but against a god who was willing to sacrifice anything, she had lost the chance to strike first.

The God of Destruction laughed, “I knew that eventually there would be two people who are from a different world. Many years ago, Ye Jue appeared and I knew another would come. I did now know what form or status you would have when you did appear but I knew that you and Ye Jue had a connection and this is why you are now both before me. That’s why I left him in the Lower Realm as I was sure that when you came along, both of you would meet and come to face me. Looks like I was correct.”

The God of Destruction knew that if he controlled one of the souls that was from another world, the other would soon follow.

And his bet proved correct.

“Ye Jue knew of my plan and moreover he had been afflicted with the life and death worm, you would surely come. The only thing that has surprised me is how weak you are.” The God of Destruction said with a sigh.

“I thought you would be strong like Ye Jue but you look like a normal person. But then again, that allowed Ying’er to absorb the powers of those seven fellows. Hahaha...” The God of Destruction made no attempt to hide his madness.

“Isn’t it such a great honour for the both of you to witness the destruction of the world with me?

“Madman.” Jun Wu Xie frowned at the increasingly maniacal God of Destruction.

The God of Destruction was very smart, and being the only remaining god in the Three Realms, his power was unmatched. But he was also a madman whose ambition would destroy everything. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

If this had occurred when she was just reborn, Jun Wu Xie would not have batted an eyelid at the world’s destruction. But now, with her family, friends and lover, things were different and she would not allow it to happen.

“Madman?” he shook his head, “Plebeians like you will never understand my desire, to reign supreme over all. You only need to experience that sort of power once and you’ll never forget it ever in your life!”

His expression was getting more and more crazed, he looked up as if he was looking at something he had been waiting for for a long time.

“I will get everything one day!”

“Don’t even dream of it as long as we’re here.” Jun Wu Yao interjected.

The God of Destruction said to Jun Wu Yao, “Ye Jue, do you think you are a match for me now that you are rid of the life and death worm? It’s such a shame that you don’t seem to remember what happened when you contracted the life and death worm. Do you need me to jog your memory?”

The God of Destruction flashed an evil grin and gently clapped his hands together. Feng Ming suddenly emerged from the shadows pushing a wheelchair into the hall. When Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao saw the wheelchair, they were rooted to the spot!
