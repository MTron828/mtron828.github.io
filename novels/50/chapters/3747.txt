Qin Song did not say anything but immediately used the soul power in his body and congealed a mass of soul power in the palm of his hand. He then directly covered it above her hands.

The soul of power in the palm of his hand entered her hands at a speed visible to the naked eye, and her body convulsions gradually calmed down as well.

Long Jiu who was standing outside the door swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

“This girl really can endure. We’ve already told her that this kind of cultivation method was too tough, even if she can attain power that ordinary people can’t, the price that she has to pay is too big...” In his eyes, it could be seen that he could not bear to let her go through so much.

Qin Song did not speak but carefully observed Jun Wu Xie’s reaction. Only after seeing her gradually return to normal did he then retreat to the side.

“I’ve told you before that although the method of dual soul form cultivation can quickly improve your strength, but the risk is too great. Fortunately, you have the seed of the spirit tree in your body, otherwise you would have already exploded and died. Listen to me, You are already very strong now. Don’t continue to practice, or else, even if there is the seed of the spirit tree, no one in the world will be able to save you.” On Qin Song’s face, no longer was there the usual gentle smile as he looked at her with his brow slightly wrinkled. The current situation of Jun Wu Xie was not as optimistic as what the others had thought.

The enormous power that she has gained in five years was not something that ordinary people could afford.

“I’m fine...” Jun Wu Xie supported herself and sat up. Her clothes had already been soaked in cold sweat. Her complexion was as white as a sheet, which made people feel worried.

“You call this fine? Your attacks are getting more and more frequent, and they are getting more intense each time. If not for Old Five and I using our soul power to suppress it, just based on the intensity of the pain, it’s enough to kill you!” Those who were not afraid of death knew that this method of cultivation was like suicide, and yet they still cultivate it with sheer desperation. It was simply... as if they did not want their own lives at all!

“I have no other choice.” Jun Wu Xie said as she gasped for her breath.

If there was another way, she too was not willing to suffer such pain.

But...

At that time, she had no other way to choose from.

The Soul World has a special cultivation method but it’s made up of a combination of methods that poses great risks to people who are still alive. Not only can it cultivate the power of the soul, but it also has the ability to cultivate spirit energy together. Cultivating two forms at one go would speed up one’s cultivation.

Otherwise, even if it was Jun Wu Xie who possessed a perverse talent, she still wouldn’t be able to reach such a terrible height in five years.

It’s just this kind of dual soul form cultivation is detrimental to the human body. It emphasizes on forcing the fusion of spirit power and soul energy and this was equivalent to blurring the boundary between the soul and the flesh, and just a little carelessness could cause an explosion and end one’s life.

Over the years, Jun Wu Xie had been cultivating on like crazy. When she first started, the pain was too much to bear that she almost wanted to die, but eventually she managed to endure it. The drawbacks of the dual soul form cultivation was not known to even Ye Gu and the others. This was an agreement that was made in private between Jun Wu Xie and Qin Song and Long Jiu.

They will give her enough strength for her to exact her revenge and she in turn will return the seed of the spirit tree after that.

She once told Qiao Chu that the seed of the spirit tree have already merged with her soul and cannot be separated.

But this does not include her death...

If her soul was dispersed, the seed of the spirit tree will naturally come out.

At that time, the agreement between them would be completed.

She did not lie to anyone, no matter whether it was Qiao Chu and the others or Qin Song and the rest, all she said was true.
