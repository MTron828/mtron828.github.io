There was no change in Jun Wu Xie’s expression, she had never felt that her own cultivation speed was heaven defying. For she was clearer than anyone that her achievements today, what price she had paid. She had exhausted all her strength and effort, with each step she took, there was an immense amount of hard work poured in. The amount of hardships she faced was not something others could fathom.

Others only saw her glory, but they did not know the arduous journey behind it all.

Leaving her home at a young age, not being able to be with her family, getting rid of enemies, collecting maps, searching for the Dark Emperor’s tomb, entering the Middle Realm, fighting against the Twelve Palaces, stepping into the Spirit World to cultivate the soul.... Each and every step, each and every adversity she faced, she never mentioned it to anyone.

If given a choice of a peaceful and stable life, who would be willing to leave their loved ones and live each day on the edge?

She was not seeking supreme power, all she wanted to was to live so she had no choice but to do this.

“Grandmaster, you can rest assured that once you’ve reached the Lower Realm, there would be someone to arrange everything properly.” Jun Wu Xie did not reveal the emotions in her heart, there was not a ripple of emotion in her eyes.

“Good, good, good.” Ren Huang was nodding his head in delight, until he suddenly realized what she meant as he furrowed his brows and asked, “Someone would arrange? Do you mean that you do not intend to follow us to the Lower Realm?”

She replied: “We have to take precautions against the Blood Sacrifice of the Three Realms, I already know that the arrays are scattered all about the Middle Realm. There are as many as one hundred and eight totems and although we have destroyed more than half of them, however it is better to be safe than sorry. Only after destroying all of it will I feel assured.”

There were three most crucial points for the Blood Sacrifice array. The first being the soul bone which has been stolen by Ren Huang. Second was the otherworldly soul; Jun Wu Yao won’t be caught so easily. The third would be the array itself. There was no need for Jun Wu Xie to do anything for the first two points as they had already been covered, but she wasn’t willing to give up the third point, she would destroy everything so that there wouldn’t be any room for regrets.

After hearing her words, Ren Huang let out a sigh. He could see that she paid close attention to the Blood Sacrifice Array, her concern was his as well. No one would know for sure what other sinister plans the Upper Realm might resort to if they were unable to retrieve back the soul bone or capture Jun Wu Yao. The only thing they could do now was to thoroughly put a stop to this and eliminate all the risks.

“Since that’s the case, there’s no need for me to head to the Lower Realm then. I shall follow you guys as well.” Ren Huang said with a smile full of pride, his own grand disciple was so upright, as the elder, how could he he just sit by and do nothing?

However, Jun Wu Xie shook her head and urged, “The soul bone is in the possession of Grandmaster, your safety will ensure that the soul bone will be kept safely away, you have to leave.”

Ren Huang sighed in regret, he fully understood where she was coming from, since the Upper Realm could use Su Ya to lure him out, what other means would they stoop to the next time? The best way for him to avoid them would be to head over to the Lower Realm.

“So be it then, but you have to be extremely careful, the means of the Upper Realm are beyond unscrupulous and aren’t easy to deal with. It’s better to thread carefully although you have that brilliant head of yours. Ye..Jun Wu Yao, will you be accompanying her by her side?” Ren Huang looked towards Jun Wu Yao, compared to himself, Jun Wu Yao was way stronger and if he was by Jun Wu Xie’s side to protect her, then he wouldn’t need to worry.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie with a gaze filled with adoration.

“Of course, I will give my all to protect her.”

His voice wasn’t loud but it made everyone around the campfire understand how much Jun Wu Xie meant to Jun Wu Yao.
