Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

At this moment, the arrogance of Luo Qingcheng had been shattered by the appearance of the Face of Selvan. She retracted her gaze and looked at Jun Wu Xie. She narrowed her eyes as a cold glint flashed by her eyes.

“Did Ye Jue give this to you?”

Jun Wu Xie simply did not pay attention to Luo Qingcheng and only continued to attack relentlessly. She had already discovered that Luo Qingcheng’s reaction to the Face of Selvan was extremely big. Since this was a good opportunity for her so why should she waste her time and have a battle with words?

“On what basis? Why should a garbage like you have the Face of Selvan! You simply don’t deserve it!” Luo Qingcheng’s calm expression had long cracked as a deep sense of hatred spread throughout her chest.

The reason that Jun Wu Yao would give the Face of Selvan to Jun Wu Xie was definitely not a coincidence, if it was not someone he was fond of, why would he give away something so precious?

Half of the Upper Realm could not even exchange for the Face of Selvan. Now that the Face of Selvan was in Jun Wu Xie’s hands, how could Luo Qingcheng feel convinced?

“You do not deserve the Face of Selvan! Give it to me!” The aura of Luo Qingcheng immediately changed and she suddenly disappeared .The moment Luo Qingcheng had lost her composure, Jun Wu Xie flap the silver wings behind her and flew up into the air.

Just as her feet left the ground, a ghostly figure appeared at her original position and a large deep hole suddenly appeared on the ground!

Because of this heavy blow, a cloud of dust lingered in the air as the figure of Luo Qingcheng appeared in the midst of it. Just a single blow at such a powerful impact. If not for the Face of Selvan, Jun Wu Xie would not be able to avoid this attack and if it was just based on her own speed, she would not be able to escape the pursuit of Luo Qingcheng!

At this moment, Jun Wu Xie had clearly understood first hand on why Ren Huang was afraid of Luo Qingcheng. He was not being an alarmist, Luo Qingcheng could be regarded as the most powerful and enemy she had ever faced!

Her strength was far above Ren Huang!

“Slut! Did you really think that just by hiding in the air, I would not be able to touch you?” Luo Qingcheng raised her head up as her eyes narrowed dangerously. She raised her right hand and a yellow Spirit Ring appeared. Be it the size or the light, Luo Qingcheng’s Spirit Ring was much stronger than Ren Huang’s Spirit Ring!

Even with the protection of the Face of Selvan, Jun Wu Xie was sure that if any of Luo Qingcheng’s attack landed on her, even if she did survive, she would be injured very seriously, more than all her previous battles combined!

Jun Wu Xie looked at Luo Qingcheng indifferently, Luo Qingcheng’s eyes had already been clouded by hate and her crazed expression made her look extremely dangerous.

The appearance of the Face of Selvan had completely stimulated Luo Qingcheng.

Jun Wu Xie’s gaze swept through the battlefield, the disciples of the Spirit Jade Palace had suffered heavy casualties and almost half of them had been slain. If there was no turning point, she was afraid that.... Everything would be too late.

How much confidence did she have? This time round, even Jun Wu Xie could not determine the odds because Luo Qingcheng was so strong that any kind of schemes could fall short.

Luo Qingcheng swung the Spirit Ring in her hand as the yellow Spirit Ring suddenly grew larger and flew beneath her feet. Luo Qingcheng rose into the air with the power of the Spirit Ring!

When Ren Huang saw this, he held his breath as he looked on in shock. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
