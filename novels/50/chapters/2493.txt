Jun Wu Xie’s words made everyone sink into silence.

Even the Sea Spirit beasts would raise their own children, and even raise the children of others, but the Upper Realm would not even let go of their own kin... there people were really more terrible than the beasts.

“Sigh, Ye Sha and I will pitch the tents first, just in case if they can’t find a cave, then at least we will have a place to keep out of the rain.” Ye Mei gave Ye Sha a look and the two tacitly ran into the forest to pitch a tent.

It was unknown when the storm would hit, pitching the tent by the shore would be too dangerous.

The rain was getting heavier, but fortunately, their strengths were still present. Using some spiritual power they formed an air barrier to isolate their bodies from the rain.

The pitter-patter of rain soothed and calmed everyone down.

The eyes hidden within the jungle in the darkness stared unblinkingly at the little Sea Spirit Beast cradled in the hands of Jun Wu Xie, the hand which held the dagger lifted slowly, but upon seeing Jun Wu Xie gently stroking the little cub, the hand dropped down.

There was a little caution in those eyes, sweeping over everyone around the coast.

Until the moment when Jun Wu Yao turned around, shock registered in those eyes.

It’s him!

Over at the shore, Jun Wu Xie observed that the little beast seem to like Rong Ruo, and therefore wanted to let Rong Ruo carry the little beast.

Who knew that when she wanted to place the little fellow into Rong Ruo’s embrace, the little Sea Spirit Beast’s four cold, little legs tightened their hold on Jun Wu Xie’s arm, just like a koala bear, it held on tightly and refused to let go.

This scene really made Jun Wu Xie not know whether to laugh or cry. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Indeed such a fickle little fella.” Rong Ruo let out a slight laugh and gently tapped on the creature’s snout.

This little fellow, wanted to be close to her but yet refused to let Jun Wu Xie go. What a greedy little thing!

Jun Wu Xie smiled as she shook her head, but suddenly, a familiar discomfort suddenly rose from her body, and in the blink of an eye, Jun Wu Xie’s body began to tremble slightly, sinister blue veins from her arm started to slowly spread upwards.

“Meow!!!” Black Cat’s back fur stood erected!

Jun Wu Xie was actually having an attack right this moment!

However, in the twinkling of an eye, Jun Wu Xie’s face turned white, and her whole body could not stop shaking. The sudden situation made Rong Ruo and Hua Yao and others instantly stunned.

“Little Xie? What’s happening to you? Are you alright?!” Rong Ruo held a shocked expression as she grabbed Jun Wu Xie’s shivering hand. When she saw Jun Wu Xie’s hands covered with the violent blue veins, she stared at Jun Wu Yao with wide eyes.

What was going on?!

The figure of Jun Wu Yao rushed to the side of Jun Wu Xie in an instant, and after throwing the little Sea Spirit Beast into Rong Ruo’s arms, he immediately held Jun Wu Xie in his arms, and supported her body. The coldness within those purple eyes was indescribable. He held up Jun Wu Xie’s back with one hand, and with the other, he started to use his Dark Spirit.

Suddenly, a small hand covered with blue veins grabbed Jun Wu Yao’s wrist in a death grip.

Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie in surprise as she stopped him.

Jun Wu Xie’s face seemed drained of blood, and cold sweat covered her forehead. Her lips are shockingly white, but she was adamantly resisting the pain as she shook her head at Jun Wu Yao.

She knew what Jun Wu Yao wanted to do.

But he could not.

Once he used Soul Power to control her chaos, Jun Wu Yao’s Life and Death Worm would once again attack!
