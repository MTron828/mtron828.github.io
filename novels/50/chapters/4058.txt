Chapter 2654: Not Even A Drop Will Be Provided (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

While looking at Xu Zu who was working hard to put up an appeasing face, Jun Wu Xie suddenly let her hand which was originally supporting under her chin down. With her pair of long legs crossing in the chair, she placed both her hands, overlapped, on her legs.

“Go back and tell your City Lord,” said Jun Wu Xie all of a sudden.

Xu Zu straightened his clothes and sit in all seriousness.

“Nope, to be more precise, tell all the people in the seventy-two cities.” Jun Wu Xie narrowed her pair of eyes.

With an inauspicious presage suddenly emerging from his heart, Xu Zu had a feeling that the following thing that Jun Wu Xie was going to mention was definitely not some nice words.

“From today onwards, the Sea Spirit City will not provide any resources of the Sea Spirit Beast to any cities in the Upper Realm. Neither it was the meat, the bones, the organs, nor the blood, not even a drop of it will be provided!” The piercingly cold declaration of Jun Wu Xie was just like a thunderbolt, striking on the top of the heads of everybody from the Long Xuan City, causing everyone to quake their souls off in stunned.

From today onwards, the Sea Spirit City would not provide any resources of the Sea Spirit Beast?

This was absolutely ridiculous!

Even though Xu Zu was slightly fear for Jun Wu Xie, he had still been flabbergasted by the shocking announcement made by Jun Wu Xie.

“City Lord, do you really know what are you actually talking about? Discontinuing the provision? This means that the Sea Spirit City...” Xu Zu stood up, flustered. Once the Sea Spirit City halted the provision of the Sea Spirit Beasts, all the cities in the Upper Realm would then lose all their methods to train their newborns, causing the possibility of obtaining a Gold Spirit after they were born to be cut off!

The uniqueness of the Sea Spirit Beast couldn’t be replaced by any other medicine, or else the Upper Realm wouldn’t have relied on the Sea Spirit Beast so much.

Jun Wu Xie’s words were just the same as amputating a powerful arm of the Upper Realm!

Not to mention those infants who had just been born, even adults like them who were still cultivating would also need to take the meat and the haslet of the Sea Spirit Beast to refine their spirit energies. If Jun Wu Xie really implemented her decision in terminating the provision of the Sea Spirit Beasts, it would definitely cause a mighty uproar in the entire Upper Realm!

The expression of Xu Zu looked extremely ghastly at the moment. With the way Jun Wu Xie moved, not only would the entire Sea Spirit City be pushed to the teeth of the storm, even the seventy-two cities would also be hugely affected! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I am the City Lord of the Sea Spirit City, and I am the one who has the final say here.” Without giving a damn about the agitation shown by Xu Zu and his comrades, Jun Wu Xie had completely cut off Xu Zu’s words which he hadn’t finished speaking out, with her decisive and sharp words.

The colour on Xu Zu’s face turned blue. The reason they waited in the Sea Spirit City for such a long time was to get more meat and blood of the Sea Spirit Beast from the city, but who could have known that at last, the thing which they had been waiting for had turned out to be such a shocking news!

The Sea Spirit City would no longer provide the resources of the Sea Spirit Beast to the Upper Realm...

Xu Zu simply couldn’t imagine how horribly would the entire Long Xuan City be affected after he brought the news back. If this matter was spread out, perhaps all the seventy-two cities would fall into turmoil!

“If there’s no any other things left, you may return to your city,” said Jun Wu Xie coolly. She had already finished saying all she wanted to say.

With his face alternatively turning from green to pale, and from pale to green, Xu Zu sat on the chair, stiffened, not knowing whether to leave or stay. Seeing that Jun Wu Xie was about to get up and leave, Xu Zu quickly stood up and said, “City Lord, don’t you worry that you’re going to bring the tragedy of annihilation to the Sea Spirit City by committing the public anger?”

Jun Wu Xie slightly paused her steps and turned around gracefully. With her clear cold eyes glancing over the frightened face of Xu Zu, she moved her red lips and said, “Whoever has the nerves to mess with the Sea Spirit City, I’ll surely make it a one-way trip for them.”
