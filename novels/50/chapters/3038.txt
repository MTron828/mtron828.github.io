Chapter 3039 That Day 2

“Your subordinate believes that that day will come soon, and your wish will be fulfilled.” Feng Ming’s said sincerely, but his tone suddenly changed, “Chi Yan’s loyalty to you is undoubted, but your Highness doesn’t seem to be too convinced of mine. ”

“Oh? What do you mean?” His Lord spoke lightly and did not seem to be surprised by Feng Ming’s words.

Feng Ming said, “Earlier when Chi Yan left, Highness Ying and Yan Hai spoke for a long time, I just felt like he was trying to win Yan Hai over. Moreover, Yan Hai has not yet been cleansed....”

“I know what you mean. He is my child after all so his ego and his temperament would naturally be similar to mine. No matter how humble and obedient he appears normally, his ambition has never disappeared.” His Lord laughed as if he did not care about Gu Ying’s growing ambition.

“If he were not like that, could he really be considered my child? Regarding Yan Hai, you should know full well that even if I sent him to Ying’er, Ying’er would not have the ability to cleanse him, just like Ye Jue all those years ago.” The Lord seemed to be thinking of something that made his eyes twinkle with laughter.

“It is just a short memory that needs to be blocked off, it makes no real difference in the end. The window of opportunity is now, if we miss it, who knows how long we’ll have to wait for the next one? Besides, the Dual Gods have gathered, how can I let this slip?”

After being stunned momentarily, Feng Ming said, “Your subordinate has been shortsighted, your Highness will naturally control everything in the Three Realms.”

“Everything in the Three Realms ... haha ... I’m not interested in these trivial things. They were able to leave, why can’t I? I’m really fed up with this meaningless and weak world.” His eyes suddenly became sharper, and a golden stream of light flashed through his eyes!

“It won’t take long, it won’t take long ... in a while, I can leave and stay away from this world that makes me sick, ha ha ha ha ...”

His creepy laughter echoed in the hall, but Feng Ming kneeling in the hall only had a look of respect and worship. He looked up quietly in absolute faith. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jun Wu Xie told Jun Wu Yao and the rest what she had heard from Gu Ying immediately after returning to her residence.

After hearing Jun Wu Xie’s words, Jun Wu Yao looked troubled.

“Lost Temples? Brother Wu Yao, have you heard of that?” Qiao Chu looked towards Jun Wu Yao.

Jun Wu Yao shook his head, “I haven’t been in this world for too long and have never heard about anything from tens of thousands of years ago.”

Hua Yao and the rest also knew nothing.

“Could it be that Gu Ying has discovered something and told Little Xie those things to test her?” Qiao Chu speculated.

If it were not for Gu Ying’s ruthlessness, Fan Zhuo’s adoptive father would not have died.

“I do think that Gu Ying’s words may be true.” Puppet Rong Ruo stood up on the table. After being retrieved by Jun Wu Xie, Jun Wu Yao used a drop of his blood every day to stabilize his soul. As a result, Rong Ruo’s soul was becoming more and more stable, but he was still unable to get rid of this body for a while.

“Little Ruo, why do you say that?” Fei Yan asked out of curiosity.
