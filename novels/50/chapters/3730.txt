He had lost and he could not find any words of excuses...

Nangong Lie suddenly wanted to laugh, laugh at their ignorant self-confidence and self-righteousness. He had been beaten into such an embarrassed state by a woman of the Lower Realm. It was as pathetic as a dog who had fallen into water, was this the price they had to pay?

“I lost, my skill is not as good. I’ve thoroughly lost, kill me.” Nangong Lie took a deep breath and sat down against the wall. Now, he has already seen it clearly. In front of him, he did not have any power to fight back. The continued struggle and unwillingness would only make him die a more ugly death.

Nangong Lie’s eyes suddenly closed, lifting his chin and revealing his neck, as if waiting for Jun Wu Xie to give him the final blow.

However...

After waiting for a long time, he did not feel anything. Nangong Lie opened his eyes with some apprehension, but found that Jun Wu Xie had stood in front of him. She stood there quietly with her blood-stained skirt in front of him, her cold eyes swept away from him, not knowing what was on her mind.

“You... why haven’t you done anything?” Nangong Lie looked at Jun Wu Xie in astonishment. She did not look like someone with a soft heart.

Jun Wu Xie was silent for a moment, before she suddenly said: “I will leave you your life.”

“What?” Nangong Lie’s eyes open widely as he looked at her in shock, she... actually said to leave him a life?

Had she gone crazy?! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Go back to the Upper Realm, tell Luo Qingcheng that the soul bone is in my hands. If she wants to get the soul bone, bring Ye Jue to find me in the Lower Realm, otherwise she will not be able to see the soul bone again in this life. Also, when you return to the Upper Realm, don’t even think about building anymore Sacrificial Array totems in the Middle Realm.” Jun Wu Xie looked at Nangong Lie coldly and left the words that made Nangong stunned.

Soul bone? Ye Jue!

The huge shock from the news he received was still quaking in his mind. Jun Wu Xie’s words were like a bomb that had blown his mind completely blank!

“You...you really want to let me go?” The only thing that was realized in Nangong Lie’s mind was that she had left him his life.

This point itself made Nangong Lie felt that everything was hard to believe.

“I... I am... the Top Ten Experts of the Upper Realm. If you want to be an enemy of the Upper Realm, I will still fight with you in the future. You really want to...” Nangong stared at Jun Wu Xie. If it was to convey the message, she could just let go of an insignificant person from the Upper Realm. Instead, why should someone of his calibre, one that belonged to the Top Ten Experts be released?

Wasn’t this returning a tiger back to the mountain 1 ?

Jun Wu Xie’s cold eyes were fixed on Nangong Lie’s befuddled face, and her cold eyes swept by him once as a slight sneer escaped the corners of her lips.

“Do you still have the courage to fight with me?”

Such words filled with mirth and a hint of ambiguity instantly changed the look on Nangong Lie’s face. His expression crumbled immediately as the demon named fear started gnawing at his soul silently.

Fight with Jun Wu Xie again?

Just the thought of this alone had made Nangong Lie feel that his back was cold and his legs could not stop shaking.

Jun Wu Xie was very clever. She was evidently aware that under her absolute attacks that had inflicted serious trauma in both mind and body, Nangong Lie’s self-confidence and proud heart had already been crushed. Even if he recuperated and recovered his bodily wounds, in the future, he would forever be plagued by the shadow of his crushing defeat by Jun Wu Xie . As long as he heard the name of Jun Wu Xie, the image of Jun Wu Xie would appear as an inner demon and he would be pulled into the abyss by this fear.

He would never be able to muster up his courage to face another battle with Jun Wu Xie ever again.
