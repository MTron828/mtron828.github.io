Chapter 1071: “Venomous Woman (4)”

“When man does not fight for himself to live, the world will come to an end. If I am able to gain a firm standing in the Soul Return Palace, to the Thousand Beast City, wouldn’t it be also a good thing for them?” Qu Xin Rui did not feel that she was being that cruel. To climb from the Lower Realm into the Middle Realm, just how enormous an amount of effort did she expend, how much she had had to sacrifice, and how much had she put out? Nobody would be allowed to impede her. Anyone who stood to obstruct her would have to die!

“To succeed in big things, how could one tie oneself down with such trivialities? Even if I have to tread over the bones of thousands, I will achieve a higher position for myself. Moreover..... when all of you agreed to work together with me, wasn’t this exactly the point that all of you liked in me? When the Elder asked all of you to seek an appropriate power in the Lower Realm but you secretly held on to the map and roped me in to take control the Thousand Beast City. Wasn’t that because you knew that I wouldn’t care in the least about the lives of all these people? Since we have all chosen to do it this way, there is nothing else here that I will find unbearable to exploit. If I succeed here, your own positions in the Soul Return Palace will be elevated exponentially as well!” Qu Xin Rui said, looking coquettishly at Shen Chi.

Shen Chi smiled. “You’re right. Since you are giving it all you’ve got, how could I stand back and not act accordingly? Rest assured. For the sacrificial offering, I will get it all settled tonight and you will be able to regain your youthful beauty tomorrow. As for the Spirit Taming Bone Flute, you will have to deal with it on your own, as it is..... Qu Wen Hao doesn’t like the idea of us getting to close to his Grand Chieftain’s Residence.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I will get that done.” Qu Xin Rui said, her eyes narrowing up.

.....

The dark night encompassed the Thousand Beast City and Qu Ling Yue was sitting within her room, holding a brand new handkerchief in her hand. On that pure white handkerchief, two graceful Chinese characters were embroidered beautifully upon it, small and exquisite, but filled with the weighty thoughts and feelings of a girl’s heart inside.

Qu Ling Yue’s eyes stared at the embroidered characters that read “Jun Xie” on the handkerchief and as she stared, a faint pink flush rose into her cheeks. She bit on her lip and covered her face with the handkerchief. With the handkerchief over her face, she gave out a soft and delight squeal.

The thought of a young girl was always so tenuous and unpredictable. Alone in the room and just by looking at the person’s name, she was suddenly overcome with a feeling of bliss, as if the person was currently seen through that layer of thin gauze, smiling at her with a gentleness she had never seen before.

Loss in that moment of bliss, a shadow blocked out the candlelight, shrouding Qu Ling Yue in darkness. Qu Ling Yue was suddenly shocked as she sat up hurriedly!

In her shock, she saw a figure dressed in red, and realised it was the amourous Qu Xin Rui standing before her as the cotton handkerchief slipped off her face onto the floor.

“Great Grandaunt!” Qu Ling Yue immediately fell to a kneel upon the floor in nervousness, the pink tinge on her cheeks fading away instantly.

Qu Xin Rui looked at the pretty faced Qu Ling Yue kneeling on the ground. Qu Ling Yue’s features were not considered to be stunning, but when summed up together, it exuded a lively energy that only young girls possessed, where just a slight smile would be able to make people feel the as if the girl was as beautiful as a hundred flowers in full bloom. In terms of looks, Qu Ling Yue could not compare with Qu Xin Rui’s ravishing beauty, but the kind of innocent beauty that a young girl possessed would be beyond Qu Xin Rui’s reach for the rest of her life.

Qu Xin Rui narrowed her eyes as her gaze swung over to the handkerchief fallen to the floor. She bent down and picked it up and nervousness flickered in Qu Ling Yue’s gaze.

The two characters that read “Jun Xie” fell into Qu Xin Rui’s eyes and they immediately flashed with a sharp glint!

She looked up and saw Qu Ling Yue’s tiny face looking flustered and so very pitiful and Qu Xin Rui’s eyes burned with detest and hatred.

“Ling Yue, you are interested in little Young Master Jun?”
