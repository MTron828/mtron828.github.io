Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

In front of Han Zi Fei, the beauty of other maidens in the Sacred Maiden Tribe were overshadowed by her. Even if Duan Qi could not deny this fact.

Now it seemed like ...

Inviting Han Zi Fei over was really their biggest mistake.

The only good news was that Jun Wu Xie seemed to show a little attention to Han Zi Fei. Han Zi Fei did not seem to mean anything. She had already made clear the fact that she was married to Jun Gu. Though Duan Qi had a lot of dissatisfaction in Han Zi Fei, she thought Han Zi Fei was still doing a good job.

Duan Qi and Elder Yun glanced at each other. Both saw anxiety in each other’s eyes. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Elder Yun sighed and said suddenly: “Lord Jun Gu is the dragon among the people, and Sacred Maiden can rest assured. Previously, the family of my maiden family had served Lord Jun Gu and you can rest assured Lord Jun Gu is definitely the most suitable candidate for Sacred Maiden. ”

Elder Yun and the others could only assert and emphasize Han Zi Fei’s “determined heart” towards Jun Gu.

Of course ...

As soon as Elder Yun said this, Jun Wu Xie’s brow frowned slightly. She suddenly thought of the woman who appeared in the Soul Realm and appeared next to Jun Gu and forcibly took him away.

Is it possible that the person is from the Sacred Maiden Tribe?

“That’s natural.” Han Zi Fei nodded slightly in cooperation.

Aside from Han Shu being unwilling and jealous, she happened to see Jun Wu Xie’s frown. She murmured in her heart that only if it’s true that Jun Wu Xie really fancy Han Zi Fei. The unwillingness in her heart made her suddenly feel and she said: “Lord Jun Gu is a Knight of Destruction. He is naturally a man of high moral standing. Since ancient times, beautiful women have matched heroes. In the eyes of the Sacred Maiden, only the unattainable man can match it. How can an ordinary man and a Sacred Maiden be matched?”

Han Shu’s words were awful, it was clear that Han Zi Fei was snobbish. And it was Jun Gu’s identity that she was fond of.

Han Zi Fei raised her eyebrows slightly, looking at the provocative Han Shu. She found it funny. She slightly tilted her head, supported her chin with one hand, her lips raised, and indifferently said: “Yeah, in this world, the person I want to marry is only one Lord Jun Gu. And only he can only marry me. ”

Han Shu was almost vomiting blood on the spot when Han Zi Fei declared it out loud.

She was obviously sarcastic about Han Zi Fei, yet how could she reply so? Having said that, it meant that she was not good enough for Lord Jun Gu?

Han Shu had never won a fight with Han Zi Fei, be it verbal or physical.

Han Zi Fei’s words made Jun Wu Xie more depressed. But in front of so many people, she couldn’t say anything, she could only lower her eyes and not respond for the time being.

A banquet carefully arranged by Duan Qi finally made everyone’s heart heavy and full of questions. In the following time, how could Duan Qi and Elder Yun care about letting Jun Wu Xie choose a beautiful lady. Even if it was a top beauty, so long there was Han Zi Fei was still around, it was akin to having no other beauties at all.

It was better to prevent what was happening between Jun Wu Xie and Han Zi Fei now.

Jun Wu Xie did not even realize that her conversation with Han Zi Fei had made Duan Qi suspect that she had no intention towards Han Zi Fei.

It was Han Zi Fei who looked at all this, only that things became more and more interesting. But ... she didn’t care about those beside her. She just admired her little daughter’s tangled appearance.

The little girl’s reaction was really cute.
