Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Jun Wu Xie had just roughly described the happenings and had skipped many of her past actions. But Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei already found it shocking as their hearts dropped the more they listened to her experience.

The kingdoms of the Lower Realm had existed for many years and were deeply rooted, Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei dared not imagine what Jun Wu Xie had done and been through to actually cause such a change?! They could only feel their hearts ache to have their daughter experience such hardships at such a tender age. The world had taken away all the happiness and innocence that she should have enjoyed like all other girls at this young age.

Of course ...

Even if Jun Wu Xie hasn’t experienced anything, this was her temperament. But her parents were completely ignorant about it. They were heart broken. Both their eyes were filled with distress as they looked gently at Jun Wu Xie.

As Jun Wu Xie explained, the more she found that her parents’ expressions were not right. She stopped immediately to look at her parents who were almost at the brink of tears. She didn’t know what she said wrong to make her parents’ emotions unstable. Hence, she could only turn to look at Jun Wu Yao helplessly.

Jun Wu Yao couldn’t help but laugh. He probably understood Jun Gu’s concern. He took a step forward and reached out for Jun Wu Xie’s shoulder.

“His Lord’s mind is deceitful. Without destroying his plan, the Three Realms will never be peaceful.”

Jun Gu looked at Jun Wu Yao, who was holding her daughter’s shoulder. His gaze immediately became sharp and the frown that suddenly emerged showed his discomfort.

Where did this guy come from? Dare to take their daughter’s advantage in front of their presence? !!

“This is Little Xie’s husband.” said Han Zi Fei quickly when she saw the careful thoughts of her man at first glance so as to prevent Jun Gu and Jun Wu Yao from having a fight.

“What ?!” Jun Gu was shocked. He looked at Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao. Apparently he was unable to accept the news that his own daughter had married. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Cough...To be more accurate, this man should be called Ye Jue. Since you have been in the Upper Realm for so many years, so I think you would have heard of his name before.” Han Zi Fei said again.

Jun Gu’s eyes suddenly jolted open in surprise!

“You are Ye Jue?!”

Jun Wu Yao nodded politely and replied, “Yes, Father-in-law.”

The phrase ” Father-in-law” almost caused Jun Gu to vomit blood.

During this time, his consciousness regained slightly. But he heard something about Jun Wu Yao, knowing that His Lord had hated this person deeply. This was a wanted man by His Lord. But ... Jun Gu could not have imagined that his own daughter actually married such a dangerous man!

“Little Xie, did he threaten you to marry him?” Jun Gu’s first reaction was that his own daughter was coerced!

Jun Wu Yao suddenly burst into tears and laughed. He could only look at Jun Wu Xie resentfully.

Jun Wu Xie also hesitated for a moment, not understanding why Jun Gu had such a thought.

“You fool, from where do you see that our girl is being coerced?” Han Zi Fei gave Jun Gu a dismissive look.

Jun Gu opened his mouth but he saw Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao fighting side by side with one another. He then realized that his thoughts might be wrong.

Just that...

He still couldn’t accept the fact that his daughter was married.

Little Wu Xie was still so young ... Why did she get married so early?

In the hearts of every father, no matter how strong and mature their daughters were, they were always little princesses in their hearts ...

Jun Gu’s heart was really complicated and he could not say anything any further.
