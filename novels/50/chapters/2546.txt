Chapter 2547: The Banquet of Treachery (6)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Had to say that among all the opponents that Jun Wu Xie had ever faced before, there weren’t really many of them who were such a ruthless person like the way Yan Wan was, that they were able to kill their kids or wives without even hesitating. No matter how malicious and evil the person was, there were always some goodwills left for one’s children and wife Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

But, such goodwills had never existed in Yan Wan.

Jun Wu Xie had completely figured out Yan Wan’s plan. All the things that Yan Wan had done today couldn’t be considered as perfect, but there was no need for him to actually go for the acme of perfection. He had already decided to kill her with such a reason, and once she was dead, nobody would really think of looking into those suspicious and indistinct points of the case.

Yan Wan had already been forced to such an extent, that he had to risk it all in order to kill her.

Suddenly, Jun Wu Xie gave out a smile. The smile that bloomed on the icy face was especially dazzling. Under the moonlight, she had attracted everyone’s attraction, and not a single person was able to move their eyes away from the smile.

Jun Wu Xie’s smile crept Yan Wan out. He couldn’t understand it at all, how was she still able to smile at this time?

“You unfilial son! You actually got the nerves to smile! It’s my fault that I’ve indulged you so much in the past days! I didn’t think that you would actually do such a disgraceful thing! Even though you’re my son, I will not easily forgive you today!” Grinding his teeth, Yan Wan glared at Jun Wu Xie with the murderous intent raging furiously inside his heart. No matter what Jun Wu Xie had up in her sleeves, there was no way for her to leave the official residence alive today!

Brows cocking, Jun Wu Xie gazed pathetically at the indignant Yan Wan with a trace of piercing coldness in her clear eyes.

“Yan Wan, I thought that you’re smart, but I didn’t expect you to be actually so dumb. Do you think that everything is going to run as you wish today?”

“Shut up! You brute! What else do you have by now to excuse yourself?” Yan Wan bawled. After he had secretly made a gesture to Old He, the guards in the official residence gushed over and besieged the entire yard.

Those guests who were all ready for the drama too, got appalled. It didn’t matter whether if who was the one causing all of these today, at the end, the fight between Yan Wan and Jun Wu Xie was still inevitable!

However, everyone had no high expectations for Yan Hai.

The Young Master was really talented, but after all, he was still young. It was obvious that Yan Wan was well prepared tonight, plus Yan Wan had such an ample cultivation experience, how could it be easily caught up just by a period of ten or twenty years?

“Excuse myself? I don’t have to do that,” said Jun Wu Xie flatly. Even when she was being laid siege by the guards of the official residence, there wasn’t any panic seen on her face.

Yan Wan stared at Yan Hai as he sneered covertly inside himself. He had earlier ordered Old He to look into those people that were brought by Yan Hai today. They were just some useless trash who had accompanied him during his first hunt. They had no strength at all, and wouldn’t do anything else except to flatter Yan Hai all day.

It was pretty unlikely that the expert who had once secretly helped Yan Hai was with him today!

And because of this, Yan Hai was destined to be defeated today!

“Since you’ve nothing to defend yourself, that’s good, out of the respect of our kinship, I’ll make your death a quick one,” Yan Wan sneered as he began to condense the spirit energy on his hand. Light twinkling, a few spirit inscriptions appeared on his hand all of a sudden.

The strength Yan Wan had wasn’t enough to condense a complete Spirit Ring, but in the Sea Spirit City, he was still the apex of all the experts!

The moment all the people saw Yan Wan showed his spirit inscriptions out, they understood that...

Yan Wan was determined to kill Yan Hai today!
