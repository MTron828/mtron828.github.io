In this harmonious fun, everyone felt relaxed after getting tensed up for a long time. Being Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei’s daughter, there was no room to play. All night, Jun Gu and Han Zi Fei were occupied by Qiao Chu. Qiao Chu had been calling them like his own parents till their hearts melted.

Jun Wu Xie could only stand by their side with tears and laughter. Fortunately, Jun Wu Yao walked over to her, and stood with her. Otherwise Jun Wu Xie would have been lonely and miserable ...

“How do you feel?” Jun Wu Yao bowed his head slightly, looking at Jun Wu Xie next to him.

Jun Wu Xie lifted her head, holding the tame little black cat in her arms. Her cold eyes revealed a deep smile.

“I’m glad, here ... it’s warm.” Jun Wu Xie pointed to her chest. She thought she was strong enough. But did not expect that she could be so gentle. Seeing that her friends and parents were happy, her heart was as sweet as honey.

Jun Wu Yao stooped slightly and kissed Jun Wu Xie’s forehead. He had no parents and no memory of his parents. What was conveyed by the Spirit Tree was his previous life memories, indicating that he was being brought up and nurtured by heaven and earth.

Even if this was the case, he had the thought of nestling into a family.

The reason why he was so in love with the woman was probably because she was the first in the world that gave him warmth.

That kind of existence and warmth that cannot be replaced by anyone.

A pure soul was the most precious imprint.

“If I hadn’t met you back then, I wouldn’t have been as happy in my life as I am now.” Jun Wu Yao looked at Jun Wu Xie. His eyes were full of tenderness, and he seemed unable to speak in words.

Jun Wu Xie looked at Jun Wu Yao in amazement. What he wanted to say was exactly what she wanted to say.

She was very happy to be able to meet him when she was reborn. The scene of their encounter was not beautiful. She was in an embarrassed state, he was in shackles. The bond fell on them both silently from then on. As time went by, it deepened.

Till now, there was nothing that could separate them.

Fate begins, fate never ends.

“Little Wu Xie, after the incident is over, shall we find a place to hide in the mountains and rivers?” Jun Wu Yao suddenly said. Everything in the world had lost appeal to him. The only thing he thought was just to live with her for the rest of his life.

Jun Wu Xie just wanted to nod, but Han Zi Fei’s voice suddenly sounded.

“Son-in-law, how could you abduct Little Wu Xie in the presence of her parents, brothers and sisters. It is very inappropriate, right?” Han Zi Fei laughed.

Jun Wu Yao stunned slightly, but he smiled.

“I was wrong, not to live in seclusion, but to live.”

Little Xie finally got all the warmth and care. How could he have the heart to let her give up?

“It’s almost the same.” Han Zi Fei then smiled with satisfaction.

Qiao Chu and others by the side rarely saw someone who could change Jun Wu Yao’s mouth and laughed suddenly.

Feelings, even formidable Brother Wu Yao would be afraid of his mother in law!

In the midst of laughter, the moon was shining brightly. Even if it was snowy, it felt so warm.
