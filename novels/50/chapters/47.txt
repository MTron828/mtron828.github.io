Chapter 48: “It’s a Small World (3)”

Mo Xuan Fei had on an ugly expression as he tried to suppress his emotions. Bai Yun Xian slightly wrinkled her brows as she stepped forward and handed that old man a small porcelain bottle.

“These should be enough?” She tilted her chin upwards and asked smugly.

The old man took the bottle as he lifted his brows and glanced over at her.

All the onlookers craned their necks to see what Qing Yun Clan Sovereign’s disciple handed over. It certainly must be good stuff!

The old man opened the bottle and took a whiff.

Once he opened the bottle, a sweet refreshing scent permeated the surroundings and left the crowd fascinated.

“This is...?” He asked in a raspy voice.

Bai Yun Xian sneered and replied, “This is Qing Yun Clan’s infamous Qing Yun Pill.”

Once these words came out from her mouth, gasps could be heard everywhere. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qing Yun Pill!

This was the rumoured elixir which was personally concocted by Qing Yun Clan’s Sovereign. It was infamous to be known as THE life saving pill – even a person who had half a foot in the grave could extend their lifespan by having a pill a day.

This recipe was a closely guarded secret and the Sovereign was the one and only person who knew how to concoct this pill. For this, many kings and rulers had tried all means and ways to get their hands on it. This time, Bai Yun Xian had made this trip to Kingdom of Qi to specially deliver this prized elixir to the Emperor.

The one she had just handed over was specially given to her by her Master for her own use.

The name of this pill resounded throughout various nations and was an illusive name that many wanted but could not get their hands on.

“Wow, she really lives up to the name of being Qing Yun Clan Sovereign’s disciple. She could even pull out THE Qing Yun Pill out so easily! This old man is really lucky and have scored big time.” Many people were secretly envious as they stared agape at that little porcelain bottle as they discussed in hushed tones.

Changing these items for a Qing Yun Pill was a huge loss for Bai Yun Xian.

“What do you know? These pills were personally concocted by Qing Yun Clan’s Sovereign! Even if she finished it, all she need to do is to simply ask for more from her Master. Don’t mix her up with the ordinary folks like yourself! These pills to her may not be worth that much.” One of the onlookers said as he looked enviously at the golden couple in front of him.

To be able to hook up with Bai Yun Xian, the Second Prince influence had gone up by a few notches.

Bai Yun Xian was definitely in a different league from Jun Wu Xie.

Although these were spoken in hushed tones, it could still be heard and Bai Yun Xian nodded in approval inwardly as she smiled towards Mo Xuan Fei.

However, after sniffing the elixir, the old man simply stuffed the cover back and chucked the bottle back to her.

Bai Yun Xian’s smiling face stiffened.

“This is something I do not need. Not changing... Not changing.” He said wistfully as he sat back in a laid back position and slowly inhaled a deep breath and blew out the smoke from his pipe.

For that moment, everyone’s eyes almost popped out.

Had this old man gone senile already?!

That was THE Qing Yun Pill!

Bai Yun Xian’s smile immediately crumbled and her displeasure was shown on her face. This was the first time someone had rejected her Master’s personally concocted elixir!

“Dear Sir; this is The Qing Yun Pill. Q-I-N-G Y-U-N pill ah!! Are you sure you don’t want it?” She broke it down for him in exasperation.

“No, no, no! If you don’t have any other types of elixirs then don’t disturb my other patrons.” He snorted impatiently.

This was a huge blow to the couple as they stood there awkwardly – their expressions black to the extreme.

They even began to suspect this old man was not out to do business, he even had the audacity to slight and reject the Qing Yun Pill?

“If you don’t want to trade then we won’t trade! You really think your items are worth that much?!” Mo Xuan Fei coldly rebutted.

The old man glanced at him, sneered and no longer bothered with him.
