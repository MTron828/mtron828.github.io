“You and your damned confidence, after all these years, it hasn’t changed one bit.” Ren Huang shook his head wryly, towards the antics of Jun Wu Yao, he was long accustomed to it.

No... To be more precise, not everything has changed.

Ren Huang’s inquisitive gaze could not help but fall onto Jun Wu Xie who was leaning on Jun Wu Yao. Jun Wu Yao has changed, moreover it was a huge change. Although his arrogant temperament hasn’t changed, however, he was more like a person now. The past Ye Jue, even in the Upper Realm was like a great demon king that instilled fear in everyone. No one could restrict him... Nor tell him what to do. Not one dared to anger him, even that man had to take a step back.

If Jun Wu Yao was not the key to the Blood Sacrifice Array, those people would never ever dare to provoke such terrible person.

But the Jun Wu Yao of today, although he still made people fear him, in that pair of eyes some subtle changes could be discovered, and this was all due to Jun Wu Xie!

His gentleness, his serenity, they were all for Jun Wu Xie.

Towards others, he still remained cruel and ruthless. But for her, he was willing to exercise restraint.

Ren Huang had lived a carefree life and was alone for thousands of years. After so long, he had only taken in two disciples and raised them as his own children. However upon seeing Su Ya and Yan Bu Gui, Jun Wu Xie and Jun Wu Yao... He started to feel that such true feelings were worth feeling envious about. This was the most beautiful thing in the world, an irreplaceable treasure.

“Today’s matter would very soon reach the ears of the Upper Realm. I’m afraid that the Middle Realm would no longer be peaceful.” Ren Huang sighed and shook his head.

Originally, Jun Wu Xie want to divulge a matter of her soul peculiarity, however since Jun Wu Yao did not allow her to say out, she could only say, “Grandmaster, you’ve mentioned earlier that the Upper Realm could not reach their hands into the Lower Realm, what did you mean by that?”

He replied, “That is the most mysterious place between heaven and earth. Among the three realms, the Lower Realm is the weakest and the spirit energy the thinnest. It is not suitable for anyone to cultivate spirit energy. The Middle Realm is slightly better but the Upper Realm enjoys the richest and densest spirit energy. You all know that the spirit energy at Mount Fu Yao is the densest in the entire Middle Realm but in the Upper Realm, just any random desolate place that you pick, spirit energy there is several times more abundant than that of Mount Fu Yao.”

“The more abundant Spirit qi is in an area, the easier it will be to cultivate and the faster the growth is. Even without cultivating, living in such an environment and breathing in such pure spirit qi would be enough to let that person reach a frightening realm. This is one reason why it is possible for the people from the Upper Realm to comprise mainly of Gold Spirits, they do not need much talent, they do not need to cultivate so hard, all they need to do is to stand in the Upper Realm and breathe. Just something so simple to achieve such strength...” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If one were to say that Jun Wu Xie’s advancement in strength was already incredible, then those from the Upper Realm would be akin to a huge cheat. The most fundamental gap among the three realms was not the potential of the people themselves, but it was a matter of the place that they inhibited, the difference was astounding and their starting point varied.

“Think about it, if a person had grown up in a place full of abundant spirit qi since young, and suddenly throw him in a place where there’s almost no spirit qi. What kind of terrible repercussions would there be? The body has long been accustomed to the abundant spirit qi in the surroundings and with such a sudden change in environment, I’m afraid just stabilizing the body from the natural rejection of the lack of spirit qi requires a great deal of endurance.”
