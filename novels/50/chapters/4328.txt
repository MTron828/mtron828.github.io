Chapter 2924: Knight Long Yao (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Although Nangong Lie was still not clear about what was going on with Bai Mo, seeing Bai Mo’s blank expression after being reprimanded by Jun Wu Yao, his heart was very pleased...

As Nangong Lie watched on with pleasure, Bai Mo’s heart was shattered.

It was only yesterday in front of a crowd that he had pressed Nangong Lie into submission. But alas, it was only one night. He was even defeated in front of his own subordinates, taught a lesson like a boy by that demon king...

Dignity!

Where was his dignity!!!

Leave him some dignity!!!

With tears streaming down his face, Bai Mo covered his abused head, wishing that he could find a hole in the ground to crawl into.

“Oh, I don’t know much about Lord Long Yao. If Senior Bai knows about it, please share with us a little.” For some reason, Nangong Lie could not bear looking at Bai Mo’s aggrieved and sobbing bun-like face and immediately gave Bai Mo a chance to extricate himself from this rather awkward situation.

Bai Mo was not a fool. He knew, even without saying, that Jun Wu Yao could pry his teeth out one by one. He now had serious suspicions as to whether this person was a sadist. What was the reason for disciplining him like a son?

If this was the son of a certain demon king, suffering such a blow, would surely result in brain damage!

“Long Yao is the second Knight of Destruction, and no one knows where he came from. Furthermore, presently no one knows the origins of the four Knights of Destruction. Ever since they have appeared to people, they already possessed strong and unbeatable power. Standing in the supreme position, being second only to the existence of His Lord. It is said that each of them is strong enough to crush the top ten exponents, but no one actually knows how strong they are. ”

“The Knights of Destruction rarely interact with the outside world, usually staying at His Lord’s side. However, I have seen Long Yao once....” At this point, Bai Mo couldn’t help but look at Jun Wu Yao.

“At that time, I had been living in the mountains while recovering from my injuries, and occasionally I practiced in the mountains. It was then that I saw Master Long Yao ...”

Bai Mo was known to be arrogant and looked down on others. If he were not, he would not have rushed to challenge Jun Wu Yao so impetuously, getting injured in the process. However, his arrogance continued. When he met Long Yao in the mountains, Bai Mo did not know the identity of the other party and wanted to show off. However, he saw that Long Yao, with just one move produced enough force to level a mountain in front of him ...

Seeing that completely stunned Bai Mo and he instantly knew that he would never be that person’s match. Later, after he had overheard the person next to him call him Lord Long Yao, did he know the identity of the person.

At that time, Bai Mo was very glad that he had been injured and did not rush out, otherwise he was afraid that he would be injured further there and then. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Long Yao is extremely arrogant and merciless to anyone in his way. Even if it is a mountain or river, if it displeases him, he can also level it without hesitation. With him as the host, I’m afraid this selection would not be that simple. ” Bai Mo honestly said what he knew.

Although he didn’t know much, from this alone he could tell what Long Yao’s strength was and also his uninhibited arrogance.
