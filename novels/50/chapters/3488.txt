Chapter 2083: Face Slapping of the Ecstatic Rapture Palm (10)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

The Spiritual Bear was stunned. The Beast Spirits were sacrificing themselves to protect it, but it tormented its heart greatly. If its survival was made possible only through the loss of countless lives among the Beast Spirits, how was it going to be able to live with itself in future?

“Do not be rash. The cheetah is right. Even if you are to strike at them, it will not bring that big an effect. If we end up being unable to protect you, it would not make a difference whether you fight or not. What’s most important is that you are protected, as only when you still stand, the Beast Spirits will stand with you.” Jun Wu Xie said as she appeared beside Brownie in a flash. Brownie stood as the faith and belief of the Beast Spirits and hence, it must not fall. At least before all the Beast Spirits have fallen, Brownie must not come to the slightest harm.

Brownie clenched its jaws tightly together, tears streaming out of its eyes as they fell, to soak up into its thick fur.

Helplessness and grief twisted up in its heart. It did not want to be so weak, but it had no choice but to continue to stand here feeling like a coward. It understood that what Jun Wu Xie said was right, as he was Wu Jiu’s target, and the moment it charged into the battlefield, Wu Jiu would spare no effort to have all the human spirits and Weapon Spirits turn all their attacks onto him. At that time, regardless of what kind of powers it possessed, it would be impossible for it to remain standing. When that happens, Wu Jiu would seize the chance to capture it and all the sacrifices of the Beast Spirits would have been in vain.

“I won’t go, I won’t go anymore.....” Brownie suddenly took a step back and said, its eyes sorrowful as it saw the Beast Spirits paying no heed to their own safety, to battle the human spirits and Weapon Spirits, and every minute and every second that passed, tore and tormented his heart.

Cheetah heaved a sigh of relief as it looked gratefully at Jun Wu Xie. Jun Wu Xie did not say anything more but just charged into the fray anew.

Out on the battlefield, Poison Ivy went all out with the power of his vines. Supple and strong vines swept through a wide area, taking down countless human spirits, where only the sharp blades of the Weapon Spirits could cut through them, the broken segments falling to the ground, but Poison Ivy did not care in the least.

Drunk Lotus and Poppy were summoned, and the two killing machines joined hands to drive back a large wave of the enemy!

With the participation of the three Plant Spirits into the battle, a subtle change came over the battlefield. The powerful might of the Plant Spirits was something only the Weapon Spirits were able to stand against, and some other Plant Spirits who were merely spectating suddenly looked on in puzzlement at Poison Ivy, Poppy, and Drunk Lotus within the battlefield.

These three Plant Spirits, held great fame throughout the lines of Plant Spirits and if they were to raise a call to arms, a number of Plant Spirits would be sure to answer their call.

But they had not done that, as they had been just like Brownie, unwilling to pull their fellow comrades into danger.

But.....

Even when they did not call out, it did not mean that the Plant Spirits would just sit back and watch.

“Dang! You dare to touch my boss Poison Ivy! I’ll fight you with everything I have!” A youth who had tender thorns all over his body exclaimed as he charged into battle. With a great leap, the thorns on his body immediately turned hard and sharp, and like a scattering of rain, the thorns all pierced into the bodies of the human spirits.

“Hey hey hey, isn’t that Drunk Lotus? Why has he suddenly come back to join in the fun?” A lady with a bewitching body said with a smile as she watched Drunk Lotus charging right into the thick of battle, her enchanting emerald green eyes flashing with a malicious glint. “Bullying our dear Drunk Lotus, unpardonable.”

As she spoke, the lady slipped herself into the battlefield, her slender jade like hand sweeping over the handle of a Weapon Spirit and opened her palms for an instant before clamping them shut together, to turn into a carnivorous man eating plant with endless serrated teeth!

In one gulp, the Weapon Spirit was swallowed whole.

“This lady has gone vegetarian for a very long time, why must you force me to break my vow of abstinence?” The bewitching lady’s face was mournful, but her hands were already reaching towards a human spirit at the side.

‘Chomp.....’

Off with the head in one bite!
