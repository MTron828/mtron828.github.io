Chapter 2817: The Sacred Maiden Tribe (2)

Translator: Misty Cloud Translations Editor: Misty Cloud Translations

Duan Qi’s tone was full of pride. The Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus in her hand was the rarest treasure in the world.

However...

There was no expression on Jun Wu Xie’s face. Qiao Chu and others looked at Duan Qi, but their gazes were extremely strange.

Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus ...

Pffft! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wasn’t that Little Xie’s Little Lotus?

Since the growth of Jun Wu Xie’s spiritual power, the number of lotus seeds produced by Little Lotus had also increased each day. Lotus seeds were very rare then but now, they could be harvested in large numbers. Jun Wu Xie distributed to those around her on a daily basis as snacks.

When Qiao Chu looked at Duan Qi holding a non-spiritual Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus and smiling to herself, he did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Compared with Little Lotus, Duan Qi’s Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus could not even compare to a leaf of Little Lotus’.

Wonder how Duan Qi would feel if she were to know that the precious Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus in her mouth was akin to a waste to Jun Wu Xie.

Duan Qi waited for a while, but didn’t attain Jun Wu Xie’s focused gaze. She couldn’t help but have some doubts. This Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus was very rare and although the peak of Holy Mountain had also grown bigger, these Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus were supplied to the elders of the tribe or the saints. The rest were to be dedicated to His Lord while the rest gained nothing.

Before she saw that Jun Wu Xie seemed to have some interest in Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus. She originally planned to attract Jun Wu Xie using the Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus. However, Jun Wu Xie just looked at it and did not even ask any other questions!

Even Duan Qi was calm. She couldn’t help but be dumbfounded by Jun Wu Xie’s whimsical nature.

What does this kid like?

To be so indifferent to such beautiful women as Han Shu and even ignored a treasure like theHeavenly Imperial Snow Lotus. Wouldn’t it be true that this boy is so hard to please?

Poor Duan Qi was badly mistaken. She hadn’t caught hold of Jun Wu Xie’s weakness at all. If she replaced the Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus in her hand with a little white rabbit, Jun Wu Xie would probably look at it more.

As for Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus ...

Jun Wu Xie already owned the King of Heavenly Imperial Snow Lotus, Little Lotus. The others were not important to her at all.

When Duan Qi was a little embarrassed, a group of women in white clothes and cloaks came out of the maiden’s tribe. Several women had good looks. When they saw Duan Qi, they immediately knelt down and paid their salutations.

“Welcome back, Elder Duan.” The fragile female voice passed into everyone’s ears.

Looking at the respectful looks of the women in the clan, Duan Qi’s self-confidence, which had been crushed and broken at Jun Wu Xie, finally eased a little. She raised her chin proudly and said in a deep voice: “How were things in the recent days?”

“Everything is fine in the clan, please rest assured Elder Duan.”

“Mm.” Duan Qi nodded with satisfaction, then said: “This is a noble guest of my tribe. Now, prepare a good place to welcome Lord Yan.”

Having said that, Duan Qi looked to Jun Wu Xie and said: “I have just returned and there are still some things that need to be dealt with. Lord Yan, please feel at ease and help yourself. If there is any need, please feel free to speak. The Sacred Maiden Tribe will host a banquet tonight to celebrate your arrival.”

Jun Wu Xie answered with a ‘Mm”.

Duan Qi immediately walked into the tribe. Although Han Shu and others wanted to continue to get closer with Jun Wu Xie, they were called in together by Duan Qi.

Several women from the tribe looked at Jun Wu Xie curiously. Although they were full of doubts, they did not dare to violate Duan Qi’s orders and obediently brought Jun Wu Xie and her companions to their residence.
