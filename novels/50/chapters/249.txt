Chapter 250: “The Way of an Emperor (1)”

“If my Miss was to go to the Qing Yun Clan, you must make sure, not to go to the Hidden Cloud Peak.” Bai Yun Xian cautioned carefully. Disciples of the Hidden Cloud Peak had always disappeared mysteriously or were found dead for no reason. It was a fact not known to people outside of the Qing Yun Clan, but many who did not possess the capabilities to be accepted as a disciple were surreptitiously personally accepted by Ke Cang Ju and brought into the Hidden Cloud Peak. Those people had always thought that it was a god given opportunity, but little did they know that they had just put a foot forward into Death’s door.

“Tell me more about Ke Cang Ju.” Jun Wu Xie had decided that the Qing Yun Clan was a place that was anything but open and aboveboard. Anyone that could produce a disciple like Bai Yun Xian and fathered a daughter like Qin Yu Yan, could not possibly be anything but abominable as the Qing Yun Clan’s Sovereign.

“Ke Cang Ju was not originally of the Qing Yun Clan. He was brought into the Qing Yun Clan after Qin Yue was named the Sovereign, and rose up the ranks within a few years to the position of an Elder.” Bai Yun Xian replied honestly. “I do not know of Ke Cang Ju’s real identity, but only of his gloomy personality, as he’s not often seen within the Qing Yun Clan. His Hidden Cloud Peak was closed off to the other disciples and even if Qing Yue were to go there, he had to inform Ke Cang Ju of his intention beforehand.”

Jun Wu Xie paid note to the mysterious circumstances surrounding this person and listened on to Bai Yun Xian’s narration of her knowledge of the Qing Yun Clan for a little longer before she dismissed Bai Yun Xian and proceeded to Mo Qian Yuan’s chambers.

Having been unconscious for a whole night, Mo Qian Yuan had regained consciousness. But the pain that still lingered all over continued to torment him. He was bandaged from head to toe and even sitting up became a wish that cannot be fulfilled.

When Jun Wu Xie stepped into the chambers, she saw the two palace guards that she had summoned yesterday standing on each side of the bed, with one holding a teapot, and the other holding on to a tray filled with medicine bottles, their faces gaunt, obviously from a lack of sleep.

“Miss Jun.” The two guards hurriedly fell to their knees when they saw Jun Wu Xie approach.

“Leave.” Jun Wu Xie said coldly.

The two guards scrambled out without hesitation, not forgetting to leave the things in their hands behind.

“You’re here.....” Mo Qian Yuan could not move, and could only move his eyes to try to see Jun Wu Xie.

“Has your mind been cleared?” Jun Wu Xie did not check on Mo Qian Yuan’s wounds but sat down on a chair by the side.

Mo Qian Yuan laughed bitterly, but it tore at the wounds on his face and his expression contorted in agony. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It couldn’t be any clearer now. Don’t you think I asked for it myself?” If he had not tried to dissuade Jun Wu Xie, he would not have been put through the agony. Had he not been blind to the true nature of the mightiest clan across the lands, thinking they were reasonable and understanding, he would not have realised that they were in fact just a bunch of merciless and unfeeling beasts.

Without any signs of a reply from Jun Wu Xie, Mo Qian Yuan, despite himself, carried on with his monologue.

“I have been really dumb, or I would not be in this state, and had needed you to save me umpteen times. When I was small, my mother, the Empress, had always told me, it is man’s nature to be kind. However fiendish a man was, he possessed a kind side. Treating people with a genuine heart will gain you an equal reciprocation in return. I had believed her to be right all this time, but the recent events had shown me that my mother could have been wrong right from the start. She had treated that man so well, and suppressed the jealousy in her heart, and overseen the six palaces, only wishing for peace and stability within the Imperial harem. No matter whichever concubine that man had favoured at anytime, she had met them only with smiles, never harming a single one of them, to support and assist that man to become a brilliant ruler of the generation. She swallowed the whispered sweet nothings of promises, and would never have thought till the day she was murdered, that her whole life’s efforts for him and her whole family would finally be destroyed by the hand of that very man.” Mo Qian Yuan’s voice sounded choked up, hiding the bitterness that welled up within.
