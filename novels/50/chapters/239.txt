Chapter 240:”All For You (2)”

As promised, Jun Wu Xie had left the antidotes behind for Qin Yu Yan. The only catch was to identify and separate the antidote from the pile of charred powder and porcelain bits.

Even if Qin Yu Yan was not under torment from the agonizing pain from the poison, it was still impossible to pick out the antidote from the pile of trash.

The glimmer of hope that had shone through, was mercilessly extinguished and robbed from her the next moment, throwing Qin Yu Yan deeper down into the depths of despair.

Falling from the high clouds and into the mud low on the ground, feeling the disparity and futility of the situation, Qin Yu Yan was utterly devastated and she lay curled up, resigned.

The agony brought about by the poison, wrecked at her body, and Jun Wu Xie’s mockery by raising her hopes and then shattering it completely broke the will of Qin Yu Yan.

Jun Wu Xie to offer a lifeline?

In your dreams.....

After seeing Mo Qian Yuan’s condition, Jun Wu Xie had wanted to skin her alive.

Jun Wu Xie had spent so much time and effort to nurse and enable the recuperation of Mo Qian Yuan into such a healthy specimen, yet Qin Yu Yan had come and erased all that in one stroke. It was all back to square one!

Qin Yu Yan did not dare harbour the tiniest sliver of anticipation anymore, and had sunk deep into despair as the pain continue to wreck her body. The agony brought about convulsions and her bones felt like millions of ants were slowing biting and chipping away at them.

All these poisons with their malicious effects were made by her own hands. Qin Yu Yan had used them on countless people before to inflict the unspeakable torment upon her enemies. She had never thought that the poisons of her own device, would one day be turned around to be used to give her a taste of it herself!

“Everyone is to get out of here and leave the main hall to allow our Miss Qin to find the antidote in peace.” Jun Wu Xie ordered tonelessly. But her words were music to the many ears huddled in the corner as palace maids and eunuchs held back their tears of joy as they rushed out in escape from the bloody and gory main hall, filled with mutilated corpses strewn all over.

Bai Yun Xian remained in her corner, left with nowhere to go, and stood woodenly where she was, looking with dread at Jun Wu Xie.

Jun Wu Xie turned towards her and Bai Yun Xian hurried to kneel before Jun Wu Xie before she could say anything and rambled on ashen faced: “I did not tell them anything! I swear! Qin Yu Yan forced me to kill Mo Xuan Fei! I..... I..... really never said anything! Not a single word!”

Jun Wu Xie raised an eyebrow. She did not know, that Bai Yun Xian had been so afraid of her to this extent.

But.....

Mo Xuan Fei is dead? He got off too easy.

“Stand up.” Jun Wu Xie said coldly. Bai Yun Xian was still of use, and she will allow her to live, for now.

If Bai Yun Xian had revealed anything to Qin Yu Yan, she would have outlived her usefulness. But it seemed that, she was not that dumb.

Bai Yun Xian’s body shook as she stood up, as she knew she had just managed to keep herself alive this time.

“You stay here, and make sure she does not kill herself.” said Jun Wu Xie as she gestured at Qin Yu Yan. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bai Yun Xian nodded her head furiously, not daring to comment.

With all said and done here, Jun Wu Xie turned to leave and Jun Wu Yao walked with her. The black beast carried Mo Qian Yuan on its back and followed after. Drunk Lotus, who brought up the rear, hooked his hands on the doors as he stepped out, and pulled the doors of the Imperial main hall shut tightly behind him, shutting out the gory scene within.

In the main hall, only Qin Yu Yan, who was trembling violently, and Bai Yun Xian, who heaved a huge sigh of relief, were left.

A bright red trickle ran down the corner of Qin Yu Yan’s mouth. Her eyes were venomous as she stared at Bai Yun Xian. She had realised from Bai Yun Xian’s pleading that the slut, Bai Yun Xian, had conspired with Jun Wu Xie all this while.

Bai Yun Xian was put off by Qin Yu Yan’s stare and said with a frown: “Senior, you can’t blame me for this. Haven’t both you and Master always taught me, the wise must bend according to changing circumstances?”
