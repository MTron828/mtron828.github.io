“”It’s nothing.”Ye Zao pressed the cap on his head. “If there’s anything, you can contact me again.””

“W quickly stood up. “God, I’ll send you out.””

Lin Ze and Xiao Dan also stood up.

Ye Zao’s car was parked downstairs.

W instructed ye Zao to drive carefully.

“Seeing the black car disappear into the road ahead, W sighed. “I really didn’t expect Z to be a student! Oh right, Lin Ze, Z must be very famous in your school’s computer science major, right?””

“At the last sentence, W turned to look at Lin Ze.”

Lin Ze’s tone was indifferent. “She’s from our school’s chemistry department.”

Chemistry department? !

W was stunned!

A person from the evolutionary chemistry lab actually became a hacker?

Was He really not dreaming?

“Lin Ze continued, “Brother, Xiao Dan, I’m going home first! Thank you all for today!””

“W knew that Lin Ze was eager to find his mother, so he smiled and said, “Go back! It’s not too late to thank US after you find Auntie.””

“Xiao Dan helped Lin ze hail a taxi. “Brother Ze, quickly get in.””

The engagement day was getting closer and closer.

The Lin family had been very lively these past few days.

Lin Ze had just entered when he saw Feng Xianxian and old madam Lin chatting in the living room. Old Madam Lin was so amused by Feng Xianxian that she burst out laughing.

“Ah Ze!”

Old Madam Lin called out to Lin Ze.

Lin Ze stopped in his tracks. “Grandma.”

Old Madam Lin’s face was stern. “Xianxian will be your sister from now on. Don’t you even know to greet her when you see her?”

Sister?

What kind of sister was Feng Xianxian?

“But Lin Ze knew that now was not the time to go against old Madam Lin. He could only suppress the anger in his heart, “Grandma, I know that you’re doing this for my own good, but everything has a transition period. I hope that you can give me a chance to adapt to Aunt Feng and Xianxian.””

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes revealed some unhappiness.”

ADAPT?

How many years had Lin ze known Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian?

“Moreover, Lin Ze and Feng Xianxian grew up together!”

Did he still need to get used to this?

Lin Ze was clearly deliberately making things difficult for Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian!

She thought Lin ze was sensible.

She didn’t expect him to still be so insensible.

“”Then tell me, how long will it take you to get used to it?””

“Lin Ze tried his best to say calmly, “Grandma, can you give me five days?””

Five days later was the day Lin Jincheng and Feng Qianhua got engaged.

He would definitely find his mother within five days to help Lin Jincheng recover his memories.

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin’s expression softened.”

“Lin Ze continued, “Grandma, I’ll go upstairs first.””

Old Mrs. Lin nodded.

“Feng Xianxian looked at Lin Ze’s back and said worriedly, “Grandma, does brother Ah Ze not like me?””

“Old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “Xianxian! Don’t worry. Ah Ze only has you as his sister. If he doesn’t like you, who else can he like?””

“Old Lady Lin had a total of five sons and several great-grandsons. The entire family only had one precious granddaughter, Feng Xianxian, so of course she had to be pampered!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Even though Old Lady Lin said so.., but Feng Xianxian hugged Old Lady Lin’s arm and said, “Grandma, it doesn’t matter even if brother Ah Ze doesn’t like me. I just need to know that you like me! Grandma, don’t worry. I will be filial to you with my unborn younger brother in the future.””

“Once Feng Qianhua gave birth to Lin Jincheng’s flesh and blood, what would Lin ze be?”

“At that time, Lin Ze would be a pitiful wretch that no one wanted!”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Feng Qianxian’s lips curled up.”

“Old Madam Lin was very happy to be coaxed by Feng Qianxian’s words. “Qianxian still understands Grandma’s Heart!”After all, Lin Ze had crawled out from ye Shu’s stomach. It was normal for him to not be on the same side as her.”

“In the future, Feng Qianhua and Lin Jincheng would have their own children.”

...

Lin Ze went upstairs.

Lin Jincheng’s room was closed.

“There was a cleaning maid upstairs at the moment, so it was definitely not appropriate for him to go in now.”

“So, Lin Ze could only return to his room temporarily.”

“Twenty minutes later, when Lin Ze came out again, the maid who was already cleaning had already left. Lin Ze took the key that he had made and opened Lin Jincheng’s room.”

The safe was still in the corner.

Lin Ze took a deep breath and walked to the front of the safe. He entered the password one by one.

18911114.

“At this moment, Lin Ze’s hands were shaking.”

He was afraid that he had entered the wrong number.

“After he finished typing the eight numbers, Lin Ze let out a long breath.”

Da —

The safe’s door opened.

At this moment.

Linze was extremely excited.
