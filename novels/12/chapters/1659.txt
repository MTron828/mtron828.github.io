“”Isn’t worker nie overestimating himself too much?”At this moment, a light voice suddenly appeared in the air. The tone was light, but it was loud and clear, “Team leader Yu joined our Big C district with his own strength. It has nothing to do with anyone!” ”

“Seeing the person who came, Yu Zifei’s eyes lit up. “Miss Ye!” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Team leader Yu, get ready. There’s a meeting in ten minutes.” ”

“Okay.”

Old Nie walked in front of Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye! I know I’m wrong. Please give me another chance!”

“Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. “I’ve said it before. There’s only one chance. It was nie gong who didn’t grasp it well. He’s an adult now. He should learn to pay for his own actions.”Ye Zhuo wasn’t some saint, if she made an exception for old nie, there would be countless examples waiting for her to break. ”

“Miss Ye!”

Ye Zhuo ignored old nie and walked out of the door.

“Yu Zifei sorted out the information and followed him out. “Teacher, I’m going to have a meeting. Help Yourself.” ”

Old Nie stood in his original spot in a daze.

He couldn’t go back.

He really couldn’t go back. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the conference room.

The topic of this conference was how to build an oasis on Mars and develop interstellar tourism.

“”Miss Ye, Mars is too barren. Its surface is covered in desert, and its atmosphere is mainly made up of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen and argon. I think this plan is a little difficult to achieve.” ”

“Hearing that, a small number of people nodded in agreement. ”

“If humans wanted to survive on Mars, oxygen was an indispensable part. They could not let tourists travel on Mars in spacesuits. ”

“Cen he smiled and asked, “Then, director Ma, do you think that the speed of light is easy to achieve?” ”

“Hearing that, director Ma choked. ”

“Before ye Zao built an aircraft carrier, the speed of light was indeed impossible for them. ”

“Even now, other than ye Zao, there was no other person who could build an aircraft carrier faster than the speed of light! ”

“Watching China land on Neptune and then land on other planets like metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the other countries were very envious! ”

“At present, many countries had come to the base to rent samples! ”

“Cen Jiang followed up, “Director Ma, we should believe in Miss Ye and support her! I think the Mars plan is not that difficult to achieve.” ”

“”Team leader Cen Jiang, this is not a question of trust, but based on the analysis of the soil brought back from Mars, there is no way to grow plants on Mars! “Just like the deserts on Earth, do you think we can turn our deserts into an Oasis?” ”

The environment in the desert was much better than on Mars!

“At the very least, there was oxygen in the desert! ”

“At the moment, there was no way to change the environment in the desert, let alone on Mars. ”

How could Mars be so easily modified?

“Listening to everyone’s discussion, ye Zao knocked on the table and opened his red lips. “Everyone, quiet down.” ”

The air immediately quieted down.

“Ye Zao continued, “Actually, it’s not difficult to modify Mars. “First of all, the atmosphere of Mars is not completely devoid of oxygen. Other than carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon, it also has a small amount of oxygen. This proves that Mars is not completely uninhabitable. “Therefore, we have to solve the problem of water and soil first!” ”

“Mars was very similar to Earth. They both had an atmosphere. The only difference was that the Earth’s atmosphere was mainly raised, while Mars had carbon dioxide. ”

“Although there was not much oxygen on Mars, there were many types of elements. Once developed, the resources on Mars would even surpass those on earth! ”

“Moreover, there were studies that indicated that there were once mountains and rivers on Mars. ”

“This meant that a long time ago, Mars was like Earth, it would rain! ”

“Director ma continued, “Miss Ye, actually, compared to Mars, we should go to Europa to take a look.” ”

Europa was discovered in the last century.

“Europa was also known as Europa, a Jupiter satellite. ”

“Through the observation of scientific researchers, they found that Europa not only had water, but there were no craters on its surface. This meant that Europa was a very young planet, and it was very likely that there was life! ”

“Therefore, Europa also had another name. ”

Small Earth.

“Unfortunately, the technology of humans was limited before, and they could not reach the possibility of landing on Europa! Therefore, the landing plan had been put on hold! ”

“Now that there was a light-speed aircraft carrier, it was very easy to go to Europa, but ye Zhuo had always refused to go to Europa. ”
