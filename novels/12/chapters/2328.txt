“In the world, Ye Zao was the only girl who had reached such a high realm. ”

“Unfortunately, Ye Zao did not take good care of her feathers. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“She could have relied on the aircraft carrier to shine, but now, she would fall as hard as she stood. ”

“The aircraft carrier was very fast, reaching Mars in less than half an hour. ”

What everyone saw was a green planet.

The Yellow Sand was nowhere to be seen. Everywhere was covered by green vegetation and big trees.

“There were also red, orange, yellow, and purple flowers blooming in the green vegetation. Beautiful Elk were running freely in the boundless wild. ”

This scene could not help but remind Mi Jia Di of the video that Wen Zhi had sent back from Mars.

“In the video, the boundless green vegetation was withering and turning yellow at the speed of light. The elk and rabbits that were running had all fallen, and the Paradise on Earth had become a living hell. ”

“But now, what was happening in front of him? ”

Who could explain it to him?

Mi Jiadi’s face gradually turned pale. He told himself that this was all an illusion. It was 3D holographic technology.

Yes.

It must be 3D holographic technology!

“After all, the holographic technology in China was very mature now. ”

“As long as they opened the hatch and walked on Mars, they would definitely be able to prove that these were fake. ”

“Looking at everything outside the window, ye Zao’s voice sounded again in the cabin. “Now, can everyone believe that all of this is real?” ”

“”Since Dr. YC is so confident, why don’t you dare to let us open the hatch and step on the Green Mountains and water to experience it? “After all, this is our first time on Mars,”a leader of country P continued. ”

“”Mr. Hewitt is right, Dr. YC. Since we are already here, let’s avoid any other rumors in the future. Why Don’t you open the hatch and let us experience it for ourselves,”said the top tech leader of Country L. ”

“Until the last one, they would never believe that ye Zao could create an oasis on Mars ”

It was impossible!

Especially the leader of Country P.

“Almost one-third of country P’s land was desert. In recent years, they had made a lot of efforts to improve the desert environment. However, after so many years, they still did not see any changes. ”

“Not to mention, it was the harsh conditions on Mars. ”

How could it be possible to grow green plants on Mars.

“”Why wouldn’t I Dare?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and continued, “Since everyone is so curious about Mars, then let’s visit Mars personally. Captain Yu, Captain Tang.” ”

“Miss Ye.”

“Hearing this, Yu Zifei and Tang Mi immediately walked over. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Prepare to land on Mars.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, the aircraft carrier smoothly stopped on Mars. ”

“Under the arrangement of Yu Zifei and Tang Mi, everyone began to walk out of the cabin door. ”

Standing in the first place was Mr. Hewitt from Country P.

Hewitt had some understanding of Mars.

“He didn’t have any equipment at the moment. He was only wearing a very ordinary suit. Without the protection of the Martian suit, what if he died on Mars? ”

“Besides, this was Mars. Even if ye Zao killed them all, no one would know. ”

No.

He couldn’t be the first to go down.

“Mr. Hewitt took a step back. “Dr. YC, you should go first. After all, no one knows Mars better than you.” ”

Ye Zao smiled faintly and walked forward. He walked out of the cabin door and stepped on the soft grass.

“Seeing ye Zao walk out of the cabin door, Mr. Hewitt heaved a sigh of relief and then walked out. ”

The others followed Mr. Hewitt.

“This is really Mars!”

“Oh my God! This is just another small earth!”

“I didn’t know that the Earth looked so beautiful on Mars.”

“”Dr. YC, Congratulations! You have finally completed the OASIS project after two years!” ”

“It turns out that Mars can really be transformed.”

“...”

The air was filled with congratulations and exclamations. No one had expected that ye Zao had successfully completed the OASIS project.

“Seeing the scene on the big screen of the live broadcast, Wen Zhi’s legs trembled like a sieve. ”

His face was completely drained of blood.

What should he do now?

Run!

He had to run quickly before ye Zao discovered him.

“Otherwise, how could he escape when Ye Zao returned from Mars? ”

Wen Zhi immediately turned around and ran.

“Fortunately, no one paid attention to Wen Zhi at this time. He ran all the way to the exit of the exhibition hall. At this time, the hair on the top of his head was grabbed by someone, and a tearing pain came from his scalp. ”
