“After the two of them left, Ye Zao continued to drink Long Island ice tea. ”

“Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao, her eyes almost shining. ”

Ye Zao was really too amazing!

“Searing. Why Are You So Amazing? Who Did you learn those moves from?”

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and said somewhat arrogantly, “Of course, if Daddy isn’t amazing, who is?” ”

“At this moment, the phone rang. ”

Ye Zao answered it. “Hello.”

A low voice came from the other end of the phone. “Leader.”

“Ye Zao was stunned for a moment before he reacted. That person was Cen Shaoqing. “Yes, what’s Up?” ”

“Where are you now?”

“Ye Zao looked around and continued, “At 666 Ying Bin Road, Qing Bar.” ”

Qing Bar?

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “You’re at the Bar?”

“Yes.”

“Who are you with?”Cen Shaoqing’s voice immediately changed. He asked a series of questions. “When did you guys go? Have you been drinking?”

“I’m with Yueyue.”Ye Zhuo was a little impatient from being asked. “Why are you so annoying! I’m not going to talk to you anymore. I’m hanging up now!”

“After saying that, ye Zao directly hung up the phone and raised his cup, “Come, yueyue! Let’s continue drinking.” ”

“Long Island ice tea did not feel much after drinking it, but the aftershocks were especially strong. At this time, Ye Zao was clearly a little drunk! ”

“Li Yueyue was no exception. She looked at ye Zao and said with a silly smile, “Eh, why are there two burning flames?” ”

“”Are You a Fool?”Ye Zao smiled and said, “There are two of me! Do you think it’s the real and fake beautiful Monkey King?” ”

The two of them answered each other’s questions and laughed like the silly son of a landlord.

“When Cen Shaoqing arrived, this was what he saw. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Cen Shaoqing massaged his temples and walked over. “Ancestor, how much have you drunk?” ”

“Hearing a familiar voice, ye Zao looked back and said to Cen Shaoqing, “You, who are you?” ”

“Ye Zao felt that the person standing in front of him was somewhat familiar, but he could not remember his name. His figure was blurry. ”

Cen Shaoqing put the Buddha beads into his pocket and took the wine glass from ye Zao’s hand. “Don’t drink anymore!”

“Who are you! How dare you Bully da Zao Zao!”Li Yueyue slammed the table and stood up. “Zao Zao! Deal with him!”

“Ye Zao immediately rolled up his sleeves, looking like he was going to fight. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“In the next second, ye Zao attacked. ”

“Although he was already drunk, his moves were not wrong at all. If it was anyone else, they really would not be able to withstand it. ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing was standing in front of Ye Zhuo. ”

“CEN fifth master, who was once famous in the capital. ”

Cen Shaoqing stretched out his hand slightly and held her waist. He directly carried her in his arms and turned to look at his assistant behind him. “Bring Madam’s classmates back and settle them down.”

“The assistant was not unfamiliar with the term ‘madam’. He nodded slightly and said, “Alright, Fifth Master.” ”

“The assistant was a man, and he was a man with a family. It was definitely not appropriate for him to settle Li Yueyue down. Hence, he called his wife and asked her to come over. ”

“On this side, Cen Shaoqing carried ye Zhuo back to the car. After saying “Go to Phoenix Manor”to the driver, he pressed the lift board in the car and isolated a small space. ”

“”Water, I want to drink water...”ye Zao moved restlessly in Cen Shaoqing’s arms. ”

Cen Shaoqing was already at the age where he was in the prime of his life and had been a monk for so many years. How could he stand such teasing.

“But at this moment, he had no choice but to endure it. ”

“”I want to drink water!”Seeing that Cen Shaoqing did not move for a long time, ye Zao stretched out his hand and gave him a slap on the face. ”

Slap.

It was crisp and clear.

“This slap made Cen Shaoqing sober up quite a bit. He held ye Zao with one hand and opened the door of the car refrigerator with the other. He took out a bottle of mineral water, opened the cap of the bottle, and carefully fed her. ”

“Ye Zao drank more than half of the bottle of water in one go. Some water droplets rolled down from the corner of his mouth to his neck, followed by his collarbone, and finally his white collar. ”

This scene made Cen Shaoqing’s blood boil. He could not help but swallow his throat.

Cen Shaoqing silently chanted the clear heart mantra in his heart a few times before looking out of the window.

“”Who are you?”After drinking the water, Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing and asked. ”

Cen Shaoqing slightly lowered his eyes. His deep eyes could not see the bottom. His tone was a little hoarse. “Who do you think I am?”

Ye Zhuo looked at him very seriously. “Cen Shaoqing.”

“”You’re Cen Shaoqing, right?” ”

“Seeing that she could still recognize him, Cen Shaoqing’s expression softened a little. He opened his thin lips slightly and said, “I’m still your future husband.” ”

“Future husband?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.
