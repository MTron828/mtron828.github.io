“”Yes, I’ve thought it through.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. ”

“Since she had already made things clear with Feng Yang, she would not be bothered anymore. ”

From now on.

Her identity was only Zhou Ziyue. She had nothing to do with Feng Yang.

“Even if she did, it was only as a stranger. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Good Girl, Ziyue, your fortune is still in the future.” ”

Zhou Ziyue’s eyes were filled with determination.

“At this moment, wechat rang. ”

Zhou Ziyue looked down at her phone.

It was a wechat message from Ma Lu.

“Who sent this message? Feng Yang?”Ye Sui asked.

“”No,”Zhou Ziyue shook her head. “It’s Ma Lu.” ”

“”Ma Lu?”At this moment, ye Sui’s eyes lit up. He continued, “Then you have to have a good chat with little ma. Be careful with your words. Don’t let little Ma discover anything.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

On the other side.

Feng Yang finished all his official business and sat on the sofa. He looked especially tired.

It was very uncomfortable.

He had given his heart to Zhou Ziyue. He had even thought of the names of their children in the future.

He had thought of many possibilities for the two of them in the future.

But he had not thought of breaking up.

The word ‘break up’was too far away for them.

But everything happened so suddenly today.

“Feng Yang pinched the bridge of his nose, tears flowing uncontrollably from his eyes. ”

“At this moment, he suddenly thought of something and immediately took out his phone to call Zhou Ziyue. ”

“He didn’t believe, didn’t believe that Zhou Ziyue would really break up with him. ”

All of this might just be a joke.

“However, the busy tone on the other end of the phone was hinting to Feng Yang that Zhou Zi Yue had already blocked him. ”

It was impossible.

There was really no possibility between them.

Feng Yang hung up the phone.

“Just as he hung up the phone, the ringtone sounded again. ”

Was It Zhou Zi Yue?

“Feng Yang’s already dim eyes instantly lit up with hope. He picked up the phone again, but the caller ID disappointed him. ”

It wasn’t Zhou Ziyue.

It was his mother in Yun Jing.

Feng Yang took a deep breath and pretended to be fine as he picked up the phone. “Hello.”

“”Hello, Yang Yang.” ”

“Mom.”

“Mother Feng continued, “Yang Yang, have you eaten?” ”

“I’ve already eaten. How about you?”Feng Yang continued to ask.

“”I’ve eaten too.”Mother Feng smiled and said, “Have you seen Ziyue today?” ”

“”Yes,”Feng Yang answered. ”

“”That’s good.”Mother Feng asked again, “Will you come back with Ziyue?” ”

“Probably not.”Feng Yang Thought for a moment and finally decided to go back and tell his mother about him and Zhou Ziyue. “She said that she wants to stay at her aunt’s house for a while longer.”

“”Aunt is her aunt after all. Isn’t it inappropriate to stay at her house for such a long time?”Mother Feng continued, “Tell Ziyue that relatives are separated by a layer after all. They are too embarrassed to take the initiative to bring it up, but we adults shouldn’t be insensible.” ”

“”It’s fine. That’s her biological little aunt,”Feng Yang said. ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Hearing Feng Yang’s words, mother Feng smiled helplessly and said, “Anyway, I’m just saying.” ”

“After saying that, mother Feng reminded, “You must take good care of yourself outside. Remember to eat on time.” ”

“”Yes, I know.” ”

“Mother Feng said again, “By the way, have you told Ziyue about the house? I heard from your uncle that the house prices in South Lake are about to rise. If you have such plans, you must make the down payment earlier.” ”

“Feng Yang’s uncle worked in a real estate company, so he had a clear view of the real estate problem. ”

Mother Feng was extremely regretful that she had not listened to her brother and bought a few more houses.

“Hearing this, Feng Yang fell silent. ”

“After a while, he said, “Yes, if the price is going to go up, why not buy it? I’ll settle the down payment when I get home.” ”

“So Soon?”Mother Feng asked.

“Yes.”Feng Yang nodded.

“Mother Feng asked again, “Have you discussed it with Ziyue?” ”

“”Mom, I’ll be back the day after tomorrow.”Feng Yang changed the topic. ”

“Okay.”

“After chatting with his mother for a while, Feng Yang hung up the phone. ”

“After hanging up the phone, Feng Yang sighed. “Life!” ”

It was like a joke.

Feng Yang finally believed a sentence.

“In this world, apart from family ties, everything would go bad. ”

Zhou Ziyue and Ma Lu were chatting quite well.

Ma Lu even asked her out for dinner and a movie.

“Of course, Zhou Ziyue happily agreed. ”

The next day.

Zhou Ziyue got up early in the morning to put on her makeup.

“Seeing her like this, ye Sui was very happy. He smiled and asked, “Are you going on a date with Xiao Ma?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“”Okay.”Ye Sui bent down and put his hand on Zhou Ziyue’s shoulder. “Ziyue, you must seize the opportunity. The wealthy families pay the most attention to bloodline issues. If you can...”the rest was self-evident. ”

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Mom, I know.” ”

“”Well, it’s good that you know,”ye Sui said. ”

“After breakfast, Zhou Ziyue went to the restaurant where she had a date with Ma Lu. ”

“When she arrived, Ma Lu had not arrived yet. ”

“However, Zhou Ziyue was not angry. She just sat by the window and waited. ”

“After about half an hour, Ma Lu arrived late. ”

The most important thing was that Ma Lu was not alone. Beside her stood a beautiful woman with a good figure.

Her skin was fair and she looked much better than Zhou Zi Yue.

“The beautiful woman took the initiative and said, “Hello, Miss Zhou. I’m Nina and I’m also Young Master Ma’s female companion. Nice to meet you.” ”

Zhou Zi Yue sat there and forgot to react.

What did Ma Lu mean by this?

There were actually other women around her on a date with her. was he trying to humiliate her?

“Seeing that Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything, Nina smiled at Ma Lu. “Young Master Ma, Miss Zhou seems to be angry!” ”

“At this moment, Zhou Ziyue stood up from the chair and smiled. “Sister Nina, Nice to meet you. My name is Zhou Ziyue.” ”

Nina was stunned.

How could she have thought that Zhou Ziyue could actually smile.

Amazing!

“Obviously, Ma Lu also did not expect Zhou Zi Yue to be so tolerant. She hugged Nina and sat down on the chair. Then, she said, “In the future, when I go out with you, Nina will always be by my side. You Won’t mind, right?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“No.”Zhou Zi Yue said.

“”That’s good.”Ma Lu continued, “Not only Nina, but also ANSHA, Coco, se se...” ”

“I’ve said it before.”Zhou Ziyue looked straight at Ma Lu’s ugly face. “What I Like Is You. It has nothing to do with other people.”

Nina took a sip of her drink.

“She was with Ma Lu purely for money, but she didn’t expect that someone would actually say such words in front of Ma Lu. ”

“Ma Lu raised her cup. “So, you’re different from them? They’re all interested in my money, only you. You’re doing this for me?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhou ziyue continued, “After seeing you, I have no doubt about love at first sight.” ”

“Love at first sight?”Ma Lu laughed out loud. “Are you sure it’s not money at first sight?”

“No.”Zhou Ziyue said firmly.

“She wasn’t after money, she was after the position of Mrs. Ma. ”

“”Okay.”Ma Lu nodded. “I believe you. Otherwise, Jingshu wouldn’t have introduced you to me.” ”

“For the first time in her life, Zhou Ziyue felt that she should thank Bai Jingshu. ”

“At the same time, she also hated Bai Jingshu. ”

She hated why Bai Jingshu would introduce such an ugly freak to her.

“Ma Lu continued, “You did well. As my wife, you will have to endure more than this in the future. I will slowly let you get used to it. Of course, if you can’t get used to it, you can quit anytime.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, he pulled Nina over and kissed her on the cheek. ”

Zhou Ziyue maintained her smile. “I got it.”

Ma Lu looked at Zhou Ziyue and nodded.

“After the meal, another beauty who was on par with Nina arrived. ”

Ma Lu hugged her left and right while Zhou Ziyue followed behind the three of them like a servant serving tea and water.

“Zhou Ziyue was also a person with dignity. She could not stand such things, but she still endured it and did not complain on the spot. Instead, she went home and complained to ye Sui. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “What is this? “At least Xiao Ma has told you his true self, unlike some people who pretend to be affectionate when they are clearly having an affair outside! “Anyway, the two of you are getting what you want. You Don’t need to think so much! “You just need to get what you want.” ”

“In the face of money and power, everything was just floating clouds. ”

Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes and felt that ye Sui’s words made sense.

“Ye Sui continued, “When you become Mrs. Ma, those vixens outside will have to look at your face. As long as you become Mrs. Ma, they will never be as good as you.” ”

“”Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Mom, you’re right.” ”
