“Grandma Cen.”

“This was the first time ye Zao had seen Grandma Cen wearing a qipao. Her eyes were filled with amazement. “Grandma Cen, you look so good in a qipao.””

“”Of course. Grandma, I’m a famous beauty in my youth. The people who chased me in the past could circle the earth several times by holding hands,”Grandma Cen said with a smile. “I’m just a little inferior to you, Ye Zao.””

“When she said the last sentence, old Mrs. Cen made a gesture.”

“Old Mrs. Cen had lived to such an old age, but no one was convinced, so she was convinced by Ye Zao.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Grandma Cen, you’re too modest. When I reach your age, I definitely won’t be as good-looking as you.””

“”Who said that! Ye, in My Heart, you’re the best-looking person in the universe! Even if you’re old, you’re still the best-looking person in the Universe!””

Ye Zao smiled.

“Old Madam Cen sat in the passenger seat and turned to look at Ye Zao, then she said, “Zao Zao, I heard from the second girl that your driving skills are very good! You can even drive a car to the point of flying. Today, you’re going to let me have an eye-opener? When I was young, I also liked racing cars very much. Unfortunately, I’m old now and can’t do it anymore!””

“Ye Zao was a little surprised. “Grandma, you also like racing cars?””

“Of course!”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Your Grandpa Cen and I met because of racing cars. It’s just that we’re both amateurs.”

“Ye Zao continued, “Then sit properly. Let’s take a detour to the Winding Mountain Road. Otherwise, it won’t be easy to perform.””

“There were many cars in the capital. Not to mention racing cars, even if they drove normally, they would be stuck in traffic for a long time.”

“”Okay, okay!”Old Mrs. Cen was especially excited.”

“Soon, a red car appeared on the Winding Mountain Road.”

The car swung its tail —

The car skidded at high speed —

All kinds of thrilling movements took place one after another. It was a feast for the eyes.

The people sitting in the car were even more excited.

The Adrenaline was surging!

“Old Mrs. Cen had never experienced such an exciting feeling before. She turned to look at ye Zao and said with admiration, “Ye, you’re really amazing!””

“Ye Zao placed both hands on the steering wheel. His expression was so calm that it was as if the person driving the car was not her. “Just so-so, third in the world.””

“”Nonsense!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You’re clearly the first in the world!””

Ye Zao laughed out loud.

“Soon, the car stopped in front of the venue.”

“At this moment, the parking lot of the venue was already filled with all kinds of luxury cars.”

“After all, the election of the president was not a small matter.”

Ye Zhuo held the Cen old lady’s arm and the two of them walked towards the entrance of the venue.

The election was held in the form of a cocktail party.

“Inside, there were toasts and toasts. There were people everywhere and it was very lively.”

“Once they entered, they could hear all kinds of conversations.”

“Who do you think will be the next president of the Association?”

“It must be Liu Caiyi! Is there a need to say that?”

“I also think it will be Liu Caiyi.”

“Liu Caiyi was the vice president herself. She was very capable and talented, so it was normal for her to become a vice president.”

“Liu Caiyi is quite amazing. I heard that she is only 28 this year.”

“Then does she count as the youngest president in the history of the Literature Association?”

“Do you even need to say that?”

“It was already a foregone conclusion that Liu Caiyi would become the president of the association from the Vice President. Therefore, today, she was dressed rather grandly. She was wearing a wine-red evening gown and held a goblet in her hand, she calmly dealt with everyone’s blessings and flattery.”

“”Miss Liu, Congratulations!””

“Thank you.”Liu Caiyi raised the goblet in her hand.

“”Look at my mouth. From now on, I should call you president Liu,”the middle-aged woman continued, “President Liu, please take care of me in the future.””

“Sure.”Liu Caiyi nodded lightly.

She had been waiting for this day for three years.

The position of president was just an excessive one.

“In the future, she would climb higher and go further.”

Her future was bright.

“At this moment, Liu Caiyi swept her gaze and saw a slender figure.”

White clothes and black pants.

“Her eyebrows were like a painting, and there was a sense of coldness in her undisciplined manner. There was also a sense of bandit aura that could not be ignored. The noisy cocktail party had inadvertently become her backdrop.”

This was... Ye Zhuo.

Liu Caiyi’s gaze turned cold.

Today was her venue. What was Ye Zhuo doing here?

Stealing the limelight?

It was said that Ye Zhuo had recently gone to the Entertainment Circle and filmed a variety show.

Could she have mistaken the Chinese Art Circle for the Entertainment Circle?

Those who were good-looking might be able to gain a wave of cosmetic fans in the entertainment circle.

“After all, those fans all depended on their looks.”

But this was the Chinese art world.

“In the Chinese art world, those who were good-looking could only be considered vases at most.”

Liu Caiyi frowned.

“At this moment, ye Zao suddenly raised his eyes.”

His gaze happened to meet Liu Caiyi’s gaze.

“Ye Zao slightly curved his lips, the light in his eyes overflowing with color. He looked at Liu Caiyi like he was looking at a clown.”

Liu Caiyi did not expect ye Zhuo to suddenly make such a move.

“Feeling guilty, a layer of cold sweat broke out on her back. She hurriedly averted her gaze.”

Only after she averted her gaze did Liu Caiyi react.

Why was she panicking?

The person who should be panicking should be ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo relied on cheating to win first place in the assessment competition.

“Yet, she was an extraordinary talent!”

“Soon, she would be the President of the Chinese Arts Association.”

What was Ye Zhuo?

“Other than being master Yu’s disciple, she was nothing.”

“Thinking of this, Liu Caiyi raised her head again and looked at Ye Zhuo.”

“At this moment, there was only one silhouette left for Liu Caiyi.”

“As Liu Caiyi looked at Ye Zhuo’s back, a glimmer flashed in her eyes.”

Ye Zhuo held the Cen old lady’s wrist as they walked in the hall.

“Everyone looked over curiously. When they saw ye Zao’s face clearly, their eyes were filled with surprise.”

She was too eye-catching.

She was like a shining sun.

It was hard to ignore her.

“Who is this girl?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’m not sure.”

“”My God, she’s So Beautiful.””

“Do you think she’s even prettier than Liu Caiyi?”

“”These two people are not on the same level at all, Okay?””

“I thought Liu Caiyi was already pretty enough. I didn’t expect someone to be even prettier than Liu Caiyi!”

“I didn’t expect Liu Caiyi to be outclassed one day.”

“Listening to the crowd’s voices, Liu Caiyi’s expression changed again and again.”

Pretty?

What was the use of being pretty?

She was the one who was about to become the president.

What could ye Zao Do?

Ye Zao was just waiting to be crushed by her!

“Thinking of this, Liu Caiyi felt much better.”

Ye Zao and old Madam Cen found an empty seat and sat down.

“Not long after they sat down, ye Zao’s phone rang.”

This was a special notification.

“Ye Zao looked at Old Madam Cen. “Grandma Cen, I’m going to the washroom.””

“Go ahead.”Old Madam Cen nodded.

Ye Zhuo stood up and walked towards the washroom.

“When he found out that old Madam Cen had come, elder Qi immediately came over to welcome her. “Sister Tang, there are many people today. I’m really sorry for neglecting you.””

Old Madam Cen waved her hand. “We’re all on the same side. There’s no need to come here.”

“Elder Qi looked around old madam Cen and continued, “Your granddaughter-in-law isn’t free to come today?””

“Ever since he had returned that day, elder Qi had been very curious about what kind of person grandmother Cen’s granddaughter-in-law was.”

“To be able to draw such a landscape painting, it was definitely not simple.”

Elder Qi even suspected that the painting was really the work of a young man.

He always felt that young people nowadays were too impetuous and did not have such a state of mind.

Not to mention young people.

Even he found it difficult to draw such a painting.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “She went to the bathroom. She’ll be back soon.””

“Okay.”Old Qi nodded. “Then I’ll wait for a while.”
