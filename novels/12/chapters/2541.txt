“Okay.”Vivi nodded.

Ye Zao stood up. “I’ll be leaving now.”

“Okay.”He nodded slightly.

Ye Zao turned around and left. The nurse followed her and left the ward together.

Vivi looked at ye Zao’s back. She couldn’t tell what expression was on her face.

It was... quite uncomfortable.

Ye Zao returned to his office and looked up at the nurse. “Little Zhao.”

“”Miss Ye, if there’s anything you need, just say it.” ”

Ye Zhuo pressed his temple. “Find out who Weiwei has met recently.”

“Okay.”Xiao Zhao nodded.

“Weiwei had been living in the hospital recently. Other than the lady boss of the pet shop, the others she had met were the delivery staff, doctors, and nurses. ”

Xiao Zhao reported everything he had found to Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo pressed his temples and asked, “Who else is in Vivi’s family?” ”

“”Besides her parents, she has a younger brother,”Little Zhao answered. ”

“Do they know about Vivi’s situation?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Little Zhao nodded.

“Both her parents knew about Vivi’s situation, but none of them wanted to ask. ”

“Little Zhao continued, “Her parents divorced in the early years and each had their own family. So, Vivi became a burden that no one wanted.” ”

“Who is Weiwei’s current guardian?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Weiwei’s previous heir was her grandmother. Ever since the old man left, Weiwei has been living alone,”the nurse replied. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“The nurse sighed. “If it wasn’t for Weiwei’s self-reliance, who knows what she would have become!”Although Weiwei had a father and mother, her life was worse than living without a father and mother. ”

“Ye Zhuo flipped through the documents on the table and said, “Xiao Zhao, go back and rest first. I’ll call you if there’s anything.” ”

“”Okay.”The nurse nodded and turned to walk out. “Miss Ye, I’ll go out first.” ”

“After Xiao Zhao left, ye Zhuo analyzed the entire process very seriously. ”

“A moment later, she called Xiao Zhao over. “Xiao Zhao, go and call doctor Wang over.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, Little Zhao called Doctor Wang over. ”

“”Miss Ye, you called for me.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Doctor Wang, take a seat.” ”

Doctor Wang sat opposite ye Zhuo. He felt a little uneasy. Why did ye Zhuo call him over?

Ye Zhuo handed doctor Wang a set of documents.

“What’s This?”Doctor Wang asked.

“”Doctor Wang, you’ll know once you take a look.” ”

Dr. Wang did not say anything else. He opened the information and found that it was Weiwei’s operation risk notice.

“”Dr. Wang, can you tell me why Weiwei suddenly did not want to cooperate with the operation?”Ye Zhuo went straight to the point. ”

Dr. Wang was stunned.

How did ye Zhuo know that this matter was related to him?

“”Miss Ye, why do you say that?”Dr. Wang subconsciously wanted to deny it, but he could not tell the reason. He just felt inexplicably guilty. Logically, he should not feel guilty. ”

“”Doctor Wang, a man is a man who dares to take responsibility for his actions. There are some things that should not be said until the point is reached. What do you think?”Ye Zhuo asked. ”

Should not be said until the point is reached?

What a good thing that should not be said until the point is reached.

“Doctor Wang organized the words in his heart and then said, “Miss Ye, since you already know about it, I won’t hide it anymore. Anyway, these things have to be said on the table.” ”

“Then.., doctor Wang continued, “Miss Ye, to tell you the truth, I took Weiwei for a comprehensive check-up on malaria, but the results were completely different from what you said. So, I don’t think that Weiwei has malaria. That’s why I persuaded Weiwei to refuse the surgery.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Doctors were kind-hearted. Doctor Wang did not think that there was anything wrong with his way of doing things.

“”Have you seen Weiwei’s case?”Ye Zhuo continued, “Weiwei’s malaria can not be compared to ordinary malaria, so naturally, she can not be examined according to the routine...” ”

“It was not difficult to find out about doctor Wang because when doctor Wang first found out about her results, he was very surprised. However, what ye Zhuo did not expect was that doctor Wang actually told Weiwei all of his doubts. ”

“”Miss Ye, I know about your achievements in oncology and your position in the medical field, but your achievements in oncology can’t represent everything.” ”

“Dr. Wang paused at this point. “Similarly, you can’t deny other people’s doubts just because you think it’s malaria.” ”

“Dr. Wang said everything he wanted to say in one breath. Initially, he was under a lot of pressure, but after he finished saying everything in one breath, he felt less stressed. ”
