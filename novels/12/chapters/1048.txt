“3,2,1! ”

The box was still unable to be lifted.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Let me do it.” ”

“Cen Jiang said somewhat embarrassedly, “Miss Ye, how heavy is this?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “About 150 kilograms.” ”

It was actually so heavy!

No wonder he couldn’t lift it.

“Just as Cen Jiang was surprised, ye Zao picked up the box easily. It was so light, as if the box in his hand didn’t have any weight. ”

Cen Jiang looked at ye Zao’s back and swallowed his saliva.

“At this moment, ye Zao looked back slightly. “Aren’t you going in with me?” ”

Cen Jiang reacted at this moment and immediately trotted to catch up with Ye Zao’s footsteps.

“The gate of the base was for facial recognition, so the two of them entered the laboratory without any obstruction. ”

“When they entered the laboratory, they ran into many people. ”

“When everyone saw ye Zao and Cen Jiang walking over, they started to discuss, “Miss Ye is Here!” ”

“”I heard that Miss Ye is going to set up a research group with Jianghe, Huhai, and Tang Mi. Is it true that she wants to develop an aircraft carrier?” ”

“The research team was set up yesterday. Do you think it’s true?”

“F * ck! I thought they were talking nonsense! I didn’t expect it to be true!”

That was an aircraft carrier!

It was not an ordinary flying object.

200 countries in the world had not been able to develop an aircraft carrier until now. Ye Zhoneng?

“No matter how one looked at it, it was not reliable! ”

Tang Xue looked at Ye Zhoneng in the crowd with a sarcastic look in her eyes.

“She had long felt that ye Zhoneng was too young, impetuous, and could not become a great man. ”

Now it seemed.

Her intuition was not wrong at all.

“If Ye Zhoneng was unable to develop an aircraft carrier two years later, she would see how she would end up! ”

“At that time, even Cen Shaoqing would be implicated by her. ”

“Thinking of this, Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. ”

Ye Zao and Cen Jiang walked all the way to the group’s exclusive laboratory.

“Seeing ye Zao come over, Cen Hai immediately trotted forward. “Cen Jiang, What’s wrong with you? How could you let Miss Ye carry something?” ”

“Cen Jiang said, “That’s too heavy. I can’t carry it.” ”

“Trash!”Cen Hai scolded Cen Jiang.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “This isn’t Cen Jiang’s fault. It’s really quite heavy.” ”

“Cen Hai took the box from ye Zao’s hands. “Miss Ye, let me do it.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “You might not be able to carry it either.” ”

“Cen Hai smiled and took the box from ye Zao’s hands. “I’m not as useless as Cen Jiang...”the remaining word ‘thing’.., it was stuck in Cen Hai’s throat. At this moment, Cen Hai’s waist suddenly sank. He had never dreamed that these two boxes would actually be so heavy! ”

“If not for ye Zhuo retracting his strength in time, his front teeth would have been lost! ”

“CEN Jiang mocked, “Cen Hai, you trash. You Can’t even carry such a light box.” ”

Cen Hai:”...”

“Ye Zhuo placed the box on the experimental table and turned to look at the two of them. “Alright, stop laughing. Let’s Get to work!” ”

The two of them immediately straightened their expressions.

“Cen Hai said, “I’ll go get Cen he, Cen Hu, and little stutter to come over.” ”

“Go.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Cen Hai jogged to call for people.

“In a short while, everyone had arrived. ”

Ye Zao turned on his computer and enlarged the picture that he had designed overnight onto the projector.

The five of them looked at the huge space mothership on the projector and could not help but gasp.

“Ye Zao swiped the mouse and changed the design in a few different directions. He gave a brief introduction, “This aircraft carrier is a three-in-one combination of sea, land, and air. This is the defense isolation zone, this is the control system, and this...” ”

Everyone listened attentively to ye Zao’s introduction.

“The reason why they joined the research group was actually to give it a try. However, after seeing ye Zao’s design, they were suddenly filled with confidence in ye Zao! ”

Ye Zao would definitely be able to develop an aircraft carrier that would amaze the world!

“At that time, those who looked down on ye Zao would regret it! ”

“Especially Ceng Jiang. He had always admired ye Zao. When he saw the design, he was so excited that his blood was boiling! ”

He could not wait to start working on it.

“After briefly introducing the design to everyone, ye Zao arranged work for the five of them. ”

Tang Mi was a girl with a delicate mind. She was responsible for the quality inspection and weapon system.

“The four brothers of Jianghe, Huhai were mainly responsible for the functions, power, high-density information management, and welding processing. ”

“Cen Jiang said, “Miss Ye, the high-melting-point deck steel and nano-metal materials for the manufacture of aircraft carriers are almost ready. When do we start the preparation work?” ”
