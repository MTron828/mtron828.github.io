“Man Wen said angrily, “She is not my sister!” ”

“”Man Wen,”man xing sighed, “You are not a child anymore, when will you be sensible!” ”

“”I don’t care! I don’t have her as my sister!”After saying this, man Wen ran away while panting. ”

“Looking at man Wen’s back, man Xing shook his head helplessly. ”

Not long after.

Another video was posted on the Star Network.

Man Wen stood in front of the camera and expressed his dissatisfaction with Ye Zhuo.

“He even said that a month ago, he had warned ye Zhuo not to dream of returning to the man family and becoming her sister. ”

“Once this statement was made, the netizens’opinions changed instantly. ”

[ it turns out that Mr. and Mrs. Man already knew that ye Zao was their biological daughter a month ago. Then why didn’t they announce this news in time? Why did they have to wait until now? ]

“[ now, I still want to understand Miss Ye. I have a younger brother who doesn’t welcome me at home. If it were me, I wouldn’t be willing to come back either. ] ”

“[ compared to Manxing, this Manwen is much worse! ] ”

“[ Princess Manxing was born to be a little lucky star. I don’t know how much fortune she brought to Manxing. Of course, Manwen can’t compare to her! ] ”

[ I’d better not express my stance. It doesn’t feel good to slap my own face. ]

[ what’s going on with this Manxing Family? ]

“[ miss ye has been wandering outside for so many years. It wasn’t easy for her to find her biological parents. Her family even threatened her and refused to acknowledge her as her sister. It’s normal for her to be angry in her heart! ]! No matter how powerful ye Zhuo was, she was only a human being. A human being would have emotions! Therefore, everyone should stop blaming Miss Ye. I feel that I can completely understand Miss Ye! ] ”

“[ yes, yes, yes. The facts have proven that Miss Ye’s choice is also forgivable. ] ”

“Seeing that the public opinion on the Starnet was slowly turning towards ye Zao, man Jiangshan wished that he could slap man Wen to death. ”

“”It’s more than enough to ruin things. I, Man Jiangshan, have always been a hero. How could I give birth to such a thing!”Man Jiangshan shouted towards the door. “Men!” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mr. President!”The assistant walked in from outside.

Man Jiangshan was furious. “Call man Wen in.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.”The assistant went to call man Wen. ”

“”Wait a moment.”Just then, Zhao Dan walked in from outside and called for the assistant. ”

“The assistant stopped and man Jiangshan looked at Zhao Dan in disbelief. “It’s already so late, do you still want to protect that useless thing?” ”

A loving mother is a loser!

“Zhao Dan sighed. “I know you blame Wen ‘Er! But Wen ‘er didn’t do it on purpose! He did it for Xing ‘er, his sister!” ”

“No matter what consequences man Wen’s words had caused on the star network, his starting point was for Manxing. ”

“At the very least, he did not side with outsiders. Such consequences were not what man Wen wanted to see. ”

“”Zhao Dan, you played a big part in making Manwen into what it is today!”Man Jiangshan pointed at Zhao Dan. ”

“”Yes, I played a big part in it. What About You?”Zhao Dan looked at man Jiangshan and asked, “Man Jiangshan! Did you fulfill your responsibility as a father? So, Wen ‘er is my son, right?” ”

Man Jiangshan did not say anything when he heard this. He seemed to have thought of something and the anger on his face dissipated a little.

“Zhao dan continued, “Jiangshan, I know you’re angry, but Wen Er is also our son! “Don’t worry, I’ll think of a way to resolve this matter. I’ll also go and Tell Wen Er to not show his face on the star network and make any comments in the near future.” ”

Man Jiangshan pressed his temples. “Go and make the arrangements.”

Zhao Dan nodded.

“After leaving man Jiangshan’s office, Zhao Dan went to man Wen’s bedroom. ”

“Man Wen had been slapped by man Jiangshan previously. Because he had not applied the medicine, the scars on his face were still clearly visible. ”

“Zhao Dan was very distressed. “Wen ‘er, does it still hurt? Your father really doesn’t know how to handle things.” ”

“”It doesn’t hurt.”Man Wen looked at Zhao Dan. “Mom, are you and Dad really going to bring ye Zhuo back?” ”

“Zhao dan continued, “Wen ‘er, listen to Mom. Mom isn’t really going to bring her back. She is now the fiancee of the main ally, the young master of Dongli. In the future, she will be the most honorable woman in our S Galaxy. Bringing her back won’t do any harm to our family. You and Xing ‘er, you can both follow behind and bask in the light... ... Moreover, she is your older sister after all. She has the blood of our entire family flowing through her ... ...” ”
