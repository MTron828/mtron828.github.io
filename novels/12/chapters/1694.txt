“Chapter 1695: 352: High Energy Ahead, Big Ye is on-line abusing trash! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Lin Sha was the first friend Ye Zao had met when he came to this world.

She valued this friendship very much!

Lin Sha Hugged ye Zao.

She was really grateful to ye Zao.

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she would be a housewife now. ”

Over here.

Zou Feifei was reviewing his English when he suddenly heard a knock on the door.

Who would come at a time like this?

Could It Be Lin Sha?

Zou Feifei put down his English revision materials and walked over to open the door. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It wasn’t Lin Sha who came, but a few uniformed police officers! ”

Police!

Why would the police come!

Why would the police appear here?

“Zou Feifei was a little flustered, but he had no choice but to calm himself down. He smiled and said, “Excuse me, police uncle, who are you looking for?” ”

“The leading police officer said, “Zou Feifei, right?” ”

“It’s me.”Zou feifei nodded.

“We found out that you were involved in the poisoning of classmate Lin Shasha. Please come with me immediately.”

Boom —

Zou Feifei’s face immediately turned pale.

How could this be?

The surveillance cameras had already been deleted. How did the police find out?

“Zou feifei said, “Police officer, you must have made a mistake! Lin Shasha is my good friend. How could I possibly poison her! Moreover, I ate lunch with her!” ”

“”Don’t worry, we won’t arrest people without evidence. Come with us.” ”

“”No, I can’t go with you! I have an exam tomorrow! You Can’t arrest people without evidence!”Zou Feifei wanted to close the door, but the police found out his intention. They put their hands on the door, then controlled Zou Feifei and dragged her out. ”

“Lin Sha was standing at the entrance of the hotel, waiting for Zou Feifei. ”

“When he saw Lin Sha, zou feifei shouted, “Sha Sha! I really didn’t do anything to you! You have to believe me!” ”

“Lin Sha smiled, “Didn’t do anything? I saw everything! You put drugs in the drink I drank, and then you even contacted the hacker to delete the video of the restaurant! Zou Feifei, do you really think that deleting the video will be okay? God is watching! I just want to ask you one thing, why are you doing this to me! I don’t think I’ve ever offended you!” ”

Zou Feifei panicked!

She really panicked!

“Putting drugs in the drink and asking the hacker to delete the video, How Did Lin Shasha know all this? ”

Could the surveillance footage really be restored?

No!

It couldn’t be!

“”I didn’t, Shasha! I really didn’t! You have to believe me!”Zou Feifei was taken to the police car before he could finish his sentence. ”

“When they arrived at the police station, Zou Feifei refused to admit that he had poisoned her. ”

Until the police officer in charge of the interrogation brought the surveillance footage.

“Looking at himself in the video, Zou Feifei’s face turned pale. He swallowed his throat and said, “No, that’s not poison, that’s VC effervescent tablets!” ”

“The drink had already been drunk by Lin Sha, and there was no sample left. As long as she insisted that it was VC effervescent tablets, they wouldn’t be able to do anything to her! ”

Could there be anyone who could prove that it wasn’t VC effervescent tablets?

“Zou feifei continued, “Police uncle, I’m really innocent! I have no enmity with you, Lin Sha. Why would I poison her? What’s My Motive? It’s Lin Sha who wants to harm me! Her father borrowed over a million yuan from my father’s company. I think she’s jealous that my family is richer than hers. That’s why she wants to frame me!” ”

“”Since it’s a blockbuster, why did you get someone to delete the restaurant’s surveillance footage?” ”

“”No, I didn’t!” ”

Officer Zhao showed Zou feifei a screenshot of the printed chat history. “Then what’s This?”

Screenshot!

Where did these groups come from?

Zou Feifei took a deep breath. “I want to see my parents! I want to see my parents!”

The police had already informed Zou Feifei’s parents about such a big incident.

“Three hours later, Zou Feifei met her mother. ”

“Feifei! What happened! Why did they say that you poisoned Lin Sha?”Zou feifei had been very obedient since she was young. Her mother did not believe that her daughter would do such a thing.

“Seeing her mother, Zou Feifei’s heart calmed down a lot. ”

She was the only daughter in the family. She was the apple of her parents’eyes. Her parents would definitely not watch her go to jail!

“”No, I didn’t!”Zou Feifei held Zou’s mother’s hand tightly. “Mom, I was framed by Lin Shasha and ye Zao! Lin Shasha is jealous that I was born better than her!” ”

“Why would she frame you?”Zou’s mother asked.

“Zou feifei continued, “Because she was born better than me! Mom, Lin Shasha is Lin Jinshui’s daughter, the one who took out a loan of more than one million yuan from our family!” ”
