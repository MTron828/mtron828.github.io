Chapter 2427: 508: it doesn’t look like a joke

Translator: 549690339

“The next second, Cen Shaoqing walked out from inside. ”

It was almost without any warning.

He had just finished showering. His hair was wet and his body was wet. He was holding a white towel in his hand and drying his hair.

This was not the most important thing. The most important thing was that he was not wearing anything.

He was not even wearing a towel.

“This time, he had seen everything that he should have seen and everything that he should not have seen. ”

“Ye Zao’s face instantly turned red. He immediately turned his head. “I, I didn’t see anything.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment before he reacted instantly. There was no expression on his cold face. He remained serious. “It doesn’t matter even if you saw it.”

He would definitely see it in the future anyway.

“”I really didn’t see it,”ye Zao said. ”

“For some reason, there was a hint of guilt in his words. ”

“Cen Shaoqing curled his lips slightly. “Yes, I believe that you didn’t see anything.” ”

“It was clearly a very serious sentence, but ye Zao could hear a teasing tone in it. ”

“However, when Cen Shaoqing said this, the scene that he had just seen appeared faintly in front of ye Zao’s eyes. ”

“His face, which had already returned to normal, gradually turned red again. ”

“Cen Shaoqing took out a scarf from the towel rack and wrapped it around his waist. He walked to ye Zao and said, “Alright, don’t be shy. You’ll have to face it in the future.” ”

“What are you saying?”Ye Zao looked up at him.

“Cen Shaoqing said in a low voice, “Am I Wrong?” ”

“After saying that, he leaned slightly and whispered something into ye Zao’s ear with his thin lips. ”

His voice was so soft that only ye Zao could hear it.

Ye Zao’s face instantly turned red.”... I already said that I didn’t see it!”

“As long as she kept denying it, Cen Shaoqing couldn’t do anything to her. ”

“You really didn’t see it?”Cen Shaoqing asked again.

“No!”Ye Zao said righteously.

“Cen Shaoqing chuckled and his thin lips fell on her ear. His low voice was slightly hoarse. “Okay, then I’ll find an opportunity to let you take a good look at it.” ”

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing reached out and hooked his arm around her waist, pulling her into his embrace. ”

“In an instant, ye Zao’s body was tightly pressed against his body. ”

“The two of them were not wearing much, especially Cen Shaoqing, who only had a towel around his waist. ”

Ye Zao almost could not catch his breath. His heart was beating rapidly.

Bang Bang Bang.

“One after another, as if he could not stop. ”

“Do you want to see? HMM?”The last part of the sentence was slightly raised with a sense of oppression.

“Ye Zao’s face was already very red. At this moment, how could he endure such words to provoke him? His breathing also became rapid. ”

How could this person be like this!

He simply opened his mouth and said lewd words.

“Hooligan!”Ye Zao cursed in a low voice. He pushed Cen Shaoqing away and ran out of the door.

He was simply a big hooligan.

Cen Shaoqing looked at her back view as she ran away in a panic. His eyes were filled with a faint smile.

She was indeed still a little girl who could not be teased.

“After a moment, CEN Shaoqing retracted his gaze and turned around to walk to the bathroom. ”

Teasing a little girl made him want to take a shower again.

Was It Worth It?

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“After running to the entrance of the second floor in one breath, ye Zao stopped and took a deep breath. However, in the blink of an eye, he returned to his calm and composed appearance. ”

Old Mrs. Cen was still sitting on the sofa downstairs listening to the Huangmei Opera.

“When she heard the footsteps, she immediately turned around. “Zao Zao, why are you the only one coming down? Where’s the other one?” ”

“”That one is still upstairs,”ye Zao said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded and did not think much about it. She continued, “What Time Are you preparing to leave tonight?” ”

“”It depends on Cen Shaoqing,”ye Zao answered. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then when will you be back?” ”

Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “About ten days to half a month.”

“”Let’s play for a month,”old Mrs. Cen said. “When you’re busy, you don’t even have time to sleep. It’s not easy for you to decide to go out and play. It’s not fun to play for only ten days or so!” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It depends on the situation. If the conditions allow, we’ll play for a few more days.” ”

“Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“About half an hour later, Cen Shaoqing came down from upstairs. ”

“At this time, he was already dressed neatly. ”

“He wore a plain-colored long gown, cloth shoes, and held a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. No matter how one looked at him, he looked like a gentle and handsome young master. No one would have thought that he would be able to press down on ye Zao’s ear and say those extremely erotic words. ”

“Thinking of the scene just now, Ye Zao’s face turned slightly red. He cursed in a low voice, “You Dog!” ”

Cen Shaoqing seemed to have heard her curse in a low voice. He raised his eyes and looked in this direction. His eyes were filled with ridicule.

Ye Zao immediately glared back.

You Can’t Lose Your Aura when you lose!

“Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were filled with a faint smile. He walked over and said, “Are you ready?” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zao said. ”

“Shall we set off now?”Cen Shaoqing asked. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Ye Zao continued, “Aren’t you going to eat?” ”

“”We can eat on the plane,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”That’s fine.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Then, Grandma Cen, we’ll be leaving first.” ”

“”Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen’s face was full of a kind smile. “Okay, let’s go back.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Grandma, you take good care of yourself at home. We’re leaving.” ”

“Get lost!”Old Mrs. Cen’s face instantly changed.

“One in front of the other, the other in the back, they were two completely different people. ”

“Looking at his biological grandmother who had turned hostile faster than flipping through a book, Cen Shaoqing:”...”he also suspected that today was the day he was picked up. ”

Old Mrs. Cen smiled and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Remember to call me when Yezi arrives.”

“Okay.”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and said in a low voice, “I suspect that you are Grandma’s biological granddaughter.” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Do you still need to suspect that?”
