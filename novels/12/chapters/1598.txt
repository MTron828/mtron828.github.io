“Unexpectedly, Zeng Rou was chased out. ”

“Especially father Zeng. He pointed at Zeng Rou and said angrily, “You bastard! What have you done! ? You were chased out by your cousin? You’ve completely disgraced me!” ”

“Everyone in the circle knew that he had sent his daughter to the Zhao family. In the future, she would definitely marry into the circle of the southern city. ”

Who knew that Zeng Rou would actually be chased out!

“In the circle of the wealthy, there were also the capital circle, the Southern Circle, the Sea Circle, and the Cloud Circle. ”

Just as the name implied.

“The capital circle was the circle of the wealthy in the capital. The southern circle was the circle of the wealthy in the southern city, and so on. Among them, the capital circle was the most prestigious. It was the top of the four circles of the wealthy, followed by the Southern Circle. ”

Father Zeng originally thought that Zeng Rou would definitely become a phoenix in one leap this time and smoothly bring the Zeng family along to upgrade.

He didn’t expect Zeng Rou to make such a joke in the end.

How could he go out and meet people in the future?

“”Dad, I didn’t do anything!”Zeng rou felt wronged. “I just said a few words. The old lady of the Zhao family hasn’t said anything yet! Zeng Qiuwen slapped me and tried to kick me out!” ”

“It was Zeng Qiuwen’s fault in the first place. If Zeng Qiuwen had helped her, things wouldn’t have ended up like this! ”

But what about Zeng Qiuwen?

“Not only did she not help her, she even added fuel to the fire. ”

Zeng Qiuwen did not treat her as a sister at all!

“”Rou’er, what did you say? ! Qiuwen even hit you?”Hearing this, mother Zeng immediately stood up. ”

“Her heart ached for her daughter. Usually, she could not bear to hit Zeng Rou. ”

What right did Zeng Qiuwen have?

“”Yes.”Zeng rou nodded, with red eyes, she said, “Mom, Zeng Qiuwen doesn’t want to help me at all! She is pregnant now, and her words carry a lot of weight in the Zhao family. But what about her? Not only did she not help me, but she also let the people of the Zhao family bully me! Mom, Look, my face was hit by Zeng Qiuwen!” ”

“”Let mom see, let Mom See.”Looking at Zeng Rou’s slightly red and swollen face, Zeng’s mother’s heart almost ached to death, “I knew it, da Fang and the others didn’t have any good intentions! How are they helping us? They are clearly trying to humiliate us! Rou’er, does it still hurt now?” ”

“Yes!”

“Seeing Zeng Rou like this, Zeng’s mother felt even more heartbroken. She turned to look at Zeng’s father, “Go! Go find da Fang’s family and get justice for Rou’er!” ”

Zeng’s father frowned slightly and did not say anything.

“Mother Zeng continued, “Zeng Qiuwen, this little B * TCH, does she really think that being a mistress is that big of a deal? A mistress is a mistress, a thing that can’t be put on the table!” ”

“”Shut up!”Hearing this, Father Zeng said angrily. ”

“”Zeng Qiuwen bullied our Rou’er so much, and I can’t even say a word about her?”Mother Zeng continued, “Besides, she was a mistress to begin with, so why can’t I say anything about her?” ”

“She had given Zeng Qiuwen so many good things, and she had thought that Zeng Qiuwen would help Zeng Rou. ”

“Zeng Qiuwen, on the other hand, treated Zeng Rou like this! ”

It was disgusting!

Mother Zeng was so angry that she couldn’t stand it anymore.

“”I told you to shut up!”Father Zeng was furious. “She and Rou’er are sisters from the same family! If she is a mistress, who is Rou’er? The sister of a mistress? Do you think it will be nice to hear about it?” ”

“Although the Zeng family could not be considered as a genuine wealthy family, they were still a wealthy family among the common people! ”

The most important thing for a wealthy family was their reputation!

They would rise and fall together!

“Although Zeng Qiuwen’s way of getting to the top did not look good, at least no outsiders knew about it. If outsiders knew about it, they would also lose face. ”

“Hearing this, mother Zeng immediately shut up. ”

“She could ignore Zeng Qiuwen’s reputation, but she had to care about Zeng Rou’s. ”

She could not let this affect Zeng Rou’s future. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But Mother Zeng was still unwilling. “Is our Rou’er being bullied by the little B * Tch for Nothing?”

“Do you have to do something to be happy?”Father Zeng looked at Mother Zeng.

“Great-mother pursed her lips, “Didn’t I do it for our Rou’er? “Besides, Rou’er isn’t my only daughter. She has suffered so much, and you, as her father, don’t feel bad at all? “Are you still Rou’er’s biological father? “Your own daughter has suffered outside, and you, as her father, don’t even dare to say a word!” ”

“”Zeng Qiuwen is now the daughter-in-law of the Zhao family. How Do You Expect Me to seek justice for Rou’er?”Great-father continued, “Then do you want me to stab her with a knife and perish together with her?” ”

Great-mother was stunned.
