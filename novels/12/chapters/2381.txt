As soon as possible?

Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes lit up. “How long is as soon as possible?”

“Keep it a secret.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted.

Old Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing’s back the same day and shook his head helplessly. “This brat!”

“When he went upstairs, Cen Shaoqing closed the door of the study room, opened the computer’s drawing software, and began drawing. ”

“If there were people who knew what was going on, they would definitely recognize that this was a design of a venue. ”

Time passed by minute by minute.

“A few hours later, there was a knock on the door of the study room. ”

“Cen Shaoqing clicked to save the design and said slowly, “Come in.” ”

His slightly cold tone was a little low.

“The next second, Zhou Xiang walked in from outside the door. “Shaoqing.” ”

“Mom.”Cen Shaoqing raised her head slightly.

Zhou Xiang held a bowl in her hand. “This is the bird’s nest that has just been cooked in the kitchen. Drink it while it’s hot.”

“”Thank you, Mom.”Cen Shaoqing picked up the bird’s nest and drank it in one gulp. ”

“After drinking the bird’s nest, Zhou Xiang continued, “The day after tomorrow is Ah Ze’s wedding day. What gift do you think our family will bring?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “What do you think of the courtyard house in the city center?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang thought for a while and then said, “That courtyard house is really not bad. I also heard that Ah Ze’s girlfriend likes ancient culture. Shaoqing, you’re really thoughtful.” ”

Zhou Xiang said it casually as if it was not a courtyard house. It was as simple as what to eat the next morning

Little did he know that the value of a courtyard house in the center of the city had already reached 10 digits.

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Then send it to the courtyard house.”

“”Alright.”After saying that, Zhou Xiang continued, “Then you and Zhuluo, the two of you?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said without a trace, “Mom, are you in a hurry?” ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “How can I not be in a hurry? For people my age, they already have several grandchildren! My daughter-in-law is still at someone else’s home!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing maintained his smile. “Since you and Grandma are in such a hurry, I’ll try my best to put the wedding on the agenda.” ”

“Zhou Xiang was much more honest than old madam Cen. Before she realized that she had been tricked by Cen Shaoqing, she smiled and said, “Alright, when do you want to Get Married? I’ll make some preparations.” ”

“”You can prepare whatever you need to prepare. You’ll have to get married sooner or later anyway,”Cen Shaoqing said. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day of Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s wedding. ”

“It was different from the time they were in the s galaxy. This time, there were many people at the wedding. ”

There were four bridesmaids and four bridesmaids.

“The bridesmaids were ye Zao, an Lizi, and two authors and friends that Bai Jingshu knew. ”

“Both of them lived in sea city. In order to attend Bai Jingshu’s wedding, they had rushed over from sea city two days in advance to help Bai Jingshu decorate the wedding room. ”

“The best man team consisted of Cen Shaoqing, dog two, Fat Tiger, and Mozzie. ”

“Fat Tiger walked to Lin Ze’s side and whispered, “Are those two girls sister-in-law’s friends?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“They’re both authors?”Fat Tiger asked again.

“”Yes.”Lin Ze smiled and said, “Let me tell you another secret. Both of them are still single.” ”

“When he heard this, Li Wen immediately walked over. “F * ck! Is this for real? !” ”

“Lin Ze said, “Of course it’s for real. However, whether or not you can catch up to them is up to the both of you.” ”

“Li Wen laughed twice and placed his hand on fat tiger’s shoulder. “Brother, to be honest, I like the one who wears glasses.” ”

“Fat Tiger said a little excitedly, “What a coincidence! I like curly-haired girls!” ”

“If both of them liked the same bridesmaid, it would be a little awkward. ”

“Fortunately, both of them had different aesthetic standards, and the girls they liked were also different. ”

“Li Wen extended his hand to fat tiger, and fat tiger immediately high-fived Li Wen. “Good brother, you can do it!” ”

Li Wen raised his eyebrows. “You too. I hope that we can be like brother Ze and successfully get the beauty back.”

“Of course!”Fat Tiger raised his eyebrows.

“At this moment, Li Wen seemed to have thought of something. He looked at Lin ze and asked, “Brother Ze, when we eat later, will there be a table full of bridesmaids and groomsmen?” ”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “Of course there will be a table full of bridesmaids.” ”

“That’s Great!”Li Wen was already planning how to add the bridesmaids’wechat when they ate.

“Just as the few of them were whispering, the bridesmaids began to pose difficult questions to test the groom and the Sina team. ”

“In order to perform in front of the two bridesmaids, Li Wen and fat tiger stepped forward. ”

Buttface saw that something was wrong!

How could he let these two people perform in front of him? He also had to perform well in front of an Lizi.

“Therefore, Cen Shaoqing had nothing to do. He stood there calmly and watched the show. He watched as Buttface, Li Wen, and fat tiger were completely disfigured by the four bridesmaids. ”

“In the past, Cen Shaoqing rarely attended weddings. Even when his three sisters got married, he only went to the hotel to go through the formalities. Last time in the S galaxy, there were no such procedures. He had never known that.., it turned out that getting married was so difficult. ”

“It seemed that when he married ye Zhuo, he had to make two preparations. ”

He had to leave the bridesmaids at a loss.

Bai Mo mingled among the guests and looked at the beautiful bride and handsome groom. She was extremely jealous.

On what basis?

On what basis did Bai Jingshu get everything?

“On the other hand, she had nothing. ”

Lin Ze should be hers!

Bai Mo narrowed her eyes.

She had to make Bai Jingshu pay the price and turn this wedding into a funeral.

“”Sister, I wish you and brother-in-law a happy marriage and an early child.”Bai Mo walked out from the crowd with a blessing smile on her face. ”

“Seeing Bai Mo, Bai Jingshu was stunned. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Why, you don’t Welcome Me?” ”
