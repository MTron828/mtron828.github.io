Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Ye Sen became even angrier. ”

“”Then why didn’t you bring Ah Ze to Yunjing to find my sister last year? Why did you drag it out until now? Do you know how hard my sister has been living these years! You lived in luxury in the capital, while my sister took your daughter to live in a basement that was less than 20 square meters! Do you know how my sister lived these 19 years? You said you were in a car accident, but you were in a car accident? What evidence do you have to prove that you were in a car accident and lost your memory?” ”

Lin Jincheng did not say anything about the paternity test.

“When he came to Yunjing last year, he was shocked to see ye Shu living in a basement with very little money. He did not expect that ye Shu’s life would turn out like that. ”

“Because when ye Shu was pregnant, he had people transfer more than two million yuan into ye Shu’s bank account. ”

“At that time, fifty to sixty thousand Yuan could buy a house in Yunjing. ”

He thought that two million yuan could make ye Shu live comfortably.

“Nineteen years later, Lin Jincheng saw his ex-lover become like this and personally transferred thirty million yuan into Ye Shu’s account. ”

“Until now, Lin Jincheng did not know that he had just transferred the money last year. Under Feng Qianhua’s deliberate instigation, the money was intercepted by Old Lady Lin. ”

“I’m sorry...”a thousand words could only be turned into an apology.

He was the one who had let ye Shu down.

“Ye Sen looked at Lin Jincheng and continued, “And your name! Lin Qingcheng, what is your name? We went to Liu City to look for you later, but there was no Lin Qingcheng There!” ”

“Lin Jincheng sighed, “Lin Qingcheng is my name. From the beginning to the end, I never lied to Ah Shu. However, after my accident, my mother changed my name from Lin Qingcheng to Lin Jincheng, and my family moved from Liu City to the capital. That’s why you couldn’t find me. I’m sorry...”. “...”. “...” ”

Lin Jincheng only found out about these things after he recovered his memory.

“What else can you say besides saying sorry?”Ye Sen picked up Lin Jincheng’s sleeve. “I want you to kneel down for my sister!”

“Lin Jincheng’s eyes were full of guilt, but his legs were so hard that they could not bend. ”

“”Bastard! I want you to kneel down for my sister!”Ye Sen was angry. “You’ve let my sister down for so many years, and now you can’t even kneel down for my sister?” ”

Lin Ze was about to say something when ye Sen grabbed Lin Jincheng’s hand and forced him to kneel down.

Bang!

“Lin Jincheng was thrown to the ground, and his prosthetic limb fell to the ground. ”

Everyone present was shocked.

Including ye Sen.

“Your leg...”Ye Sen looked at Lin Jincheng and suddenly made a slip of the tongue.

“Lin Jincheng said casually, “Amputate.” ”

Amputation.

Was it because of the car accident?

“”Dad!”Lin Ze ran over with red eyes, picked up the prosthetic limb, and installed it on Lin Jincheng’s leg. ”

Lin Ze had never helped Lin Jincheng massage a prosthetic limb before.

“As he installed it, tears fell from his eyes. ”

Boiling tears wetted Lin Jincheng’s suit pants. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“After the prosthetic limb was installed, Lin Ze helped LIN Jincheng stand up from the ground. He turned to look at Ye Shu and said in a low voice, “Mom, not only did the car accident damage my dad’s cerebellum, he was in a vegetative state for ten years. He also lost a leg. He didn’t mean to change his name, and he didn’t mean to move. ”

“”Everything was done by Grandma When My dad was in a coma. He didn’t know anything. When my dad woke up, everything was set in stone. Mom, please forgive my father! He hasn’t forgotten you all these years. I beg you... ... ...” ”

“At the end of his sentence, Lin Ze knelt down directly towards ye Shu. ”

Ye Shu covered her mouth with both hands and cried out loud.

She had given up nineteen years of her youth. She had been separated from her son for nineteen years.

She had thought that she had given up the most in this relationship. She didn’t expect that Lin Jincheng had also suffered for nineteen years.

He had lost his memory and one leg.

“In the past, she had thought that Lin Jincheng was a liar. Only now did she see the truth. ”

She did not know what she should do at this moment.

“For a moment, ye Shu’s blood rushed to her heart. Her vision turned black and she fell backward. ”

“Mom!”

“Ah Shu!”

“Sister!”

“In the end, it was ye Zao who quickly supported ye Shu. “Mom, are you okay?” ”

“I’m fine.”Ye Shu shook her head. “I’m fine.”

“Seeing ye Zao, Lin Jincheng was stunned. ”

“From the moment he entered, his attention had been focused on Ye Shu. He did not notice ye Zao beside Ye Shu. ”

Who Was this girl?

“If he was not mistaken, this girl looked extremely similar to him and ye Shu. ”

“Last year, he had seen Ye yourong, but last year, Ye Yourong did not look like this at all. ”

What’s going on?
