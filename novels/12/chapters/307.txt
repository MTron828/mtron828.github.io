Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Xiang continued, “You’re just like our Shaoqing. Shaoqing also gets up early every morning to exercise! Don’t look at him as if he’s weak, but his body is actually very good! He needs a vest with a vest and abdominal muscles! He can lift a barbell that weighs 200 jin in one go!”If anyone were to marry him.., they would definitely be very happy! ”

“At this moment, Zhou Xiang’s phone suddenly rang. ”

Zhou Xiang picked up the phone and his expression changed instantly. “What? How can this be! I’m currently on vacation at the beach! The old lady is also here!”

“Can you wait for a few days?”

“”Alright, I got it.” ”

“Zhou Xiang hung up the phone and said with a frown, “Zha Zha, your grandma Cen and I might not be able to go on vacation with you guys! The housekeeper just called and said that there’s something urgent that we have to go back and take care of.” ”

“”Then I’ll go back with you guys,”ye Zhuozhuo said. ”

“Zhou Xiang waved his hand. “No need, no need! It’s not easy to come here. You and Shaoqing stay here and have fun. When your grandma Cen and I are done with our work, we’ll come back and look for you guys!” ”

“As Zhou Xiang said that, he went back into the house to change his clothes. ”

“After changing his clothes, Zhou Xiang went downstairs to look for old Mrs. Cen. ”

Old Mrs. Cen had already packed her things and was sitting in the jeep.

“When she heard this, Old Mrs. Cen’s face fell. “It’s not easy to come out to play, why are there so many things!” ”

“Zhou Xiang quickly comforted old Mrs. Cen. “Let’s hurry back, we should be back soon.” ”

“It’s so annoying!”Old Mrs. Cen discontentedly got out of the jeep.

“Zhou Xiang told Cen Shaoqing, “Shaoqing, you and searing stay here and have fun.” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked thoughtfully at Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen.

Zhou Xiang felt a little guilty from being looked at.

“Old Mrs. Cen stood in front of Zhou xiang, “Little Brat, you’re not allowed to bully Yezi! If you dare to Bully Yezi, Don’t blame me for not recognizing you!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I won’t bully her.”Cen Shaoqing continued to count the Buddha beads with the same expression. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Ye Zao and said with a smile, “Yezi, this brat of our family is devoted to Buddhism and is about to become a monk. You Don’t have to be reserved when you are with him. Just treat him as your good sister!” ”

Ye Zao smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“One dared to say it, and the other dared to answer it. ”

“”Xiang Xiang, let’s go quickly.”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang. ”

Zhou Xiang nodded.

“CEN Shaoqing said calmly, “I’ll drive you to the beach.” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “I’ll leave the yacht to you. Your grandmother and I will go back by helicopter.” ”

“As soon as he said that, there was a rumbling sound in the air. ”

From far to near.

“Zhou Xiang said, “The helicopter is here!” ”

Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo sent the two of them to the door.

“Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang got on the helicopter and waved at the two of them. “Yezi, Shaoqing, you two have a good time!” ”

Ye Zhuo also waved at them.

They got on the helicopter.

“Old Mrs. Cen leaned against the back of the chair and said with narrowed eyes, “I hope that Shaoqing will be enlightened this time. It’s not in vain for us to put on such a show.” ”

That’s right.

This was just a show.

“Actually, there was no urgent matter at all. ”

All of this was planned by old Mrs. Cen in advance.

It was to create more space for the two of them.

“Zhou Xiang looked at the scenery outside the window. “Actually, I feel that young master has already fallen in love with searing. It’s just that he hasn’t realized it yet. Mom, don’t you think that we are doing something unnecessary?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said in disdain, “With that blockhead of his, by the time he comes back to his senses, Yezi has already been abducted by other hogs! If I don’t help him out, he’ll regret it for the rest of his life!” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s IQ was 170 points.

His EQ was at most 7 points!

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “You’re right.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s personality had been especially perverse since he was young.

Other boys had a crush during puberty.

“During puberty, he had actually seen through the secular world and started a vegetarian journey. ”

“All these years, if it weren’t for the old lady Cen stepping in to stop him, he would have long been accompanied by ancient Buddhas. ”

“Now that he had suddenly met a girl he was attracted to, it was normal for him to not be able to see the true nature of her. ”

“At this time, they really needed someone to give them some advice. ”

“After Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang left, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing set off for the beach. ”

Old Mrs. Cen packed a lot of things that could be used on the beach.

And they were all for four people.

It seemed that the two of them really had something to do at the last minute and left.
