“Yi Tao continued, “Cousin, you have been unconscious for half a year.” ”

“”Half a year?”Han Dongliang was stunned, his eyes filled with disbelief. “Tao Tao, is it really half a year?” ”

Yi Tao nodded.

Han Dongliang could not put on any expression.

He thought that it was only a few days.

He did not expect that half a year had passed!

One could imagine what kind of life his parents had been living during this half a year.

He was the only son in the family.

“During that period of time, even the sky would collapse for his parents! ”

“At the thought of this, Han Dongliang felt extremely guilty. “Dad, I’m sorry. My Son is unfilial. I’ve caused you and mom to worry...” ”

“”It’s alright, it’s alright. As long as you can wake up.”Han Laoshan did not even have time to wipe away his tears. He continued, “Dongliang, how do you feel now? Do you still feel uncomfortable anywhere?” ”

“”I feel very good now.”Han dongliang said, “Dad, you don’t have to worry. Tao Tao said that Miracle Doctor Ye’s medical skills are very good. I’ll be able to be like a normal person soon.” ”

“Han laoshan nodded and continued, “Then, do you want to eat something? I’ll get the kitchen to prepare it for you right away.” ”

“During the period when Han Dongliang was unconscious, he could only rely on the nutrient solution to maintain his life. ”

“Hearing Han Laoshan’s question, Han Dongliang was about to speak when he saw Han Laoshan continue, “Wait! Contact President Ye First! She said that you can only eat if you can eat!” ”

Yi Tao picked up his phone. “I’ll contact him right away.”

The call was quickly connected and ye Zhuo’s voice came from the other end.

“Miracle Doctor Ye!”

“Mr. Yi.”

“Yi Tao continued, “Miracle Doctor Ye, my cousin is awake now. May I ask if he can eat?” ”

“A clear and shallow voice came from the phone screen, “Don’t eat for the time being. Drink some water first. I’ll come over at night. After taking a look at Mr. Xiao Han’s physical condition, I’ll be able to determine if he’s fit to eat now.” ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, Han Laoshan looked at Han Dongliang. “Since President Ye has already said that we can’t eat, let’s not eat for now. Come, drink some water.” ”

Han Laoshan picked up the cup and fed Han Dongliang some water.

“After a while, Chen Qiaoye helped Mrs. Han in. ”

“Mom.”

“Upon seeing Han Dongliang, Mrs. Han could not control herself. She covered her mouth and sobbed softly. ”

“”Mom, Don’t cry. I’m fine now.” ”

“Mrs. Han tried hard to calm herself down. “I have to thank Miracle Doctor Ye. If it weren’t for her, you wouldn’t have recovered so quickly!” ”

“In the past six months, the Han family had looked for famous doctors of all sizes. ”

But they all said that there was no cure for Han Dongliang’s illness.

The only thing that could save Han Dongliang was an gong bezoar pill.

“But even if they found an gong bezoar pill, they were only 70% sure. ”

Mrs. Han thought that she was going to lose her son forever.

She did not expect that Han Dongliang would actually wake up!

“From the time he took the medicine until now, Ye Zhuo only used three days. ”

“If she did not see it with her own eyes, no one would believe that it was true. ”

“In the past, Mrs. Han never believed in miracles. ”

“Now, to her, Ye Zhuo was a miracle! ”

A miracle for the entire Han family.

“”I still have to thank you.”Mrs. Han grabbed Chen Qiaoye. “Qiaoye, thank you. Thank you for recommending Miracle Doctor Ye to us...” ”

“”Aunty, we are family. This is what I should do.”Chen Qiaoye said, “The person you should thank the most is Miracle Doctor Ye.” ”

Mrs. Han held Chen Qiaoye’s hand and wiped her tears.

“In a moment, Mrs. Han’s emotions gradually calmed down. She turned to look at Han dongliang and said, “Dongliang, after this is over, listen to your mother and go on a blind date. Then...” ”

“”The child has just woken up. What nonsense are you talking about!”Before Mrs. Han could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by Han Laoshan. ”

Han Dongliang was thirty-six years old this year.

“If he wanted to get married, he would not have to wait until now. ”

“Before he was sick, he had argued with Mrs. Han countless times for the sake of a blind date. ”

“Now, he had not recovered yet, and Mrs. Han was bringing up old matters again. ”

Han Laoshan was worried that Mrs. Han’s words would agitate Han dongliang.

“Upon hearing this, Mrs. Han was filled with regret. She looked at Han Dongliang, then, she said, “Dongliang, don’t be angry. I just want you to be well now. Don’t worry, I Won’t force you to go on blind dates anymore. You can do whatever you want in the future!” ”

She thought that Han Dongliang would be very angry.

“However, Han Dongliang was not angry at Mrs. Han’s words, instead, he smiled and said, “Mom is right. I’m already so old. I should find someone and start a family. Mom, don’t worry. When I’m better, I’ll definitely listen to you and go on blind dates. I’ll try my best to let you and Dad have a grandchild as soon as possible.” ”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
