“Li Yueyue said, “Second aunt didn’t let you go back.” ”

“Then why did you pull me back?”Li Shuyi was a little displeased.

She hadn’t even had a moment alone with fifth master Cen yet!

Li Yueyue was really too blind.

“Li Yueyue’s expression also didn’t look too good. “Fifth master and searing flames are a couple. When a couple chats together, what’s the point of US following behind?” ”

“Li Shuyi wanted to scold Li Yueyue angrily, but she held back. She held onto Li Yueyue’s arm and said, “Yueyue, you’re right. I really didn’t think it through.” ”

“After saying that, Li Shuyi continued to ask, “Right, what’s the relationship between Fifth Master Cen and Your Family? Why is he staying at Your House?” ”

“For so many years, Li Shuyi had never known that Li Sanzhu actually knew such a great Buddha like fifth master Cen. ”

No wonder Li Sanzhu’s business was getting better and better.

“Li Yueyue said, “Zhuoluo is my classmate.” ” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Hearing that, Li Shuyi narrowed her eyes. ”

So Li Yueyue and ye Zhuoluo were classmates.

“Li Shuyi immediately asked, “Then how is their relationship usually? Is it good? How did that classmate of yours manage to woo Fifth Master Cen?” ”

Li Yueyue was speechless!

Why did she have such a cousin?

“”Cousin, what are you talking about! Of course, Fifth Master Cen was the one who chased after zhongruo first. Moreover, Fifth Master Cen is still in his internship period! Zhongruo is so beautiful, how could he chase after someone else!” ”

What!

It was actually Cen Shaoqing who took the initiative to chase after Ye Zhongruo?

How was that possible!

“Although ye Zhongruo was indeed somewhat beautiful, it was not to the extent that Cen Shaoqing would personally chase after him! ”

“Li Shuyi felt very uncomfortable when she thought of Cen Shaoqing, an outstanding man, taking the initiative to chase after Ye Zao. Moreover, he was still in the trial period. ”

It was impossible!

Li Yueyue must be lying to her.

“”It shouldn’t be, right?”Li Shuyi said. ”

“”How could it not be! Don’t tell me I’m lying to you?”Li Yueyue continued, “Cousin, let me tell you, CEN fifth master really likes Zao. By the way, do you know Qing Zao Dessert House?” ”

“Yes.”Li Shuyi nodded.

“Two years ago, a dessert house called Qing searing hot dessert house quickly became popular in China. Now, the chain stores had already opened overseas. ”

Li Shuyi also liked to go to the Qing searing hot dessert house for a short while. She could be considered a loyal fan of the Dessert House.

“Li Yueyue said, “Qing searing hot dessert house was given to searing hot by fifth master on the day he confessed to searing hot. Qing searing hot dessert house is the meaning of Cen Shaoqing’s adoration for ye Zao. Fifth Master wants the whole world to know that he and searing hot are a couple.” ”

What!

Li Shuyi’s eyes were filled with disbelief and confusion.

She had never expected Cen Shaoqing to be so affectionate towards ye Zao.

“She had thought that ye Zao had taken the initiative to chase after Cen Shaoqing. This way, she would have a chance to take advantage of him. ”

Who knew...

“Li Shuyi instantly became very dejected. She said dejectedly, “Yueyue, I’m going back first.” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “Cousin, aren’t you going to attend the bonfire banquet?” ”

“At this time, how could Li Shuyi still have the mood to attend the bonfire banquet? ”

“”I suddenly feel a little uncomfortable,”Li Shuyi said. ”

“Then should I accompany you back?”Li Yueyue said.

“No need.”Li Shuyi waved her hand. “I can go back by myself.”

“After saying that, Li Shuyi turned around and walked back. ”

“Seeing that she had returned so quickly, Linda frowned slightly. “Didn’t you see Fifth Master Cen?” ”

“”I did,”Li Shuyi said. ”

“Linda asked doubtfully, “Why did you come back so early after seeing him?” ”

Li Shuyi told Linda what had happened.

“Hearing that, Linda didn’t show any other expression on her face. Instead, she smiled and said, “My silly child, you fell for it!” ”

“Fooled? How So?”Li Shuyi asked.

“Linda continued, “Li Yueyue said all this to scare you. After all, you’re her most powerful competitor now! Of course, she has to think of a way to trick you away! As long as you leave, won’t her chance come?” ”

“That was Cen Wuye. As long as she could get close to him, she could soar to the sky. ”

“In this world, how many girls were unwilling to marry Cen Shaoqing? ”

“Hearing this, Li Shuyi suddenly came to a realization. ”

So that was it!

Mother was right!

“Then I’ll go find them now.”Li Shuyi immediately turned around and walked back.

“”Wait,”Linda suddenly said. ”

“”Mom, What’s Wrong?”Li Shuyi turned around and asked. ”

“Linda narrowed her eyes. “Since we’re going to do it, let’s do something different. Let’s directly hit a home run.” ”

“Home run?”Li Shuyi looked at Linda with some confusion.
