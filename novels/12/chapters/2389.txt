“”Liu Chao! You lowly human, are you crazy?”Although Bai Mo could not move, she still had the habit of looking down on others. ”

“No matter what time it was, a dog could only be a dog. ”

And a human would always be a human.

Lowly human?

“Hearing this, Liu Chao laughed. “Is Bai Mo in your eyes? I’ll always be a lowly human! I, a lowly human, deserve to be trampled on by you!” ”

“Liu Chao had always thought that Bai Mo was his savior, which was why she was so loyal to Bai Mo.. ”

But he did not expect that.

His loyalty had been fed to the dogs.

“In Bai Mo’s eyes, he was even worse than a dog. The reason why he had ended up in this movie was all because of Bai Mo.. ”

“Looking at Liu Chao’s expression of wanting to eat people, Bai Mo was a little flustered. She gulped. “Liu Chao, what are you trying to do? Don’t forget, I Am Your Savior. What do you want? Don’t come over!” ”

“Liu Chao continued, “What’s supposed to happen has already happened. Bai Mo, don’t Tell Me You Still Think You’re a Virgin?” ”

“What do you mean?”Bai Mo’s expression suddenly turned extremely terrified.

Could it be that she had been taken over by a lowly person like Liu Chao?

How could this be?

No!

She didn’t accept it!

“What do you think?”Liu Chao asked back.

“”How dare you! How dare you!”Bai Mo was so angry that her face turned red. “Do you know who I am? Liu Chao! I’m telling you, you will die! You will die a horrible death!” ”

“Bai Mo was the daughter of the Bai family after all. Once the Bai family knew that something had happened to her on Earth, Liu Chao would be finished! ”

“With the power of the Bai family, crushing Liu Chao was as easy as crushing an ant. ”

“If Bai Mo had not been immobilized, she would have been able to take care of Liu Chao herself! ”

Liu Chao looked at Bai Mo with a sarcastic expression. “Do you think the Bai family can still take care of you?”

“What do you mean?”Bai Mo asked.

“Liu Chao continued, “Do you think you can still go back?” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo became even more flustered. “What do you mean?” ”

Liu Chao reached out and lifted Bai Mo’s chin. “The person you offended is Miss Ye.”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo almost choked. ”

“With Ye Zhuo’s methods, she would definitely not have a good ending. ”

“Seeing Bai Mo like this, Liu Chao released Bai Mo’s chin in satisfaction. “From today onwards, you will be like me. You will be an ordinary earthling. This is your identity card.” ”

“After saying this, Liu Chao threw an ID card at Bai Mo.. ”

An ordinary person?

An Earthling?

“Before Bai Mo could react, Liu Chao turned around and left the bedroom. ”

Bai Mo lay on the bed and looked at the ceiling. Her entire being sank into endless fear.

What should she do now?

She couldn’t be trapped on earth forever.

She didn’t want to be an inferior person!

“She was born superior. Even in the s galaxy, she was an existence that people looked up to. ”

“Bai Jingshu was, after all, the eldest daughter of the Bai family. Ye Zhuo would definitely not kill the Bai family. ”

She had to go back!

She had to make Liu Chao pay the price.

Did Liu Chao really think that a lowly person like him could control her?

Dream On!

“At this moment, Bai Mo actually felt that her physical strength was recovering bit by bit until she could move completely. ”

Bai Mo was overjoyed and immediately sat up from the bed. She picked up her clothes and randomly put them on.

“After putting on her clothes, she recalled the experience of being raped by Liu Chao when she was unconscious. Bai Mo’s face was filled with humiliation. ”

“She must make Liu Chao, this lowly trash, pay the price! ”

Especially Bai Jingshu!

Bai Mo bit her lip. Her eyes were filled with determination and viciousness.

“A moment later, Bai Mo pushed the door open and walked outside. ”

Liu Chao wasn’t there.

It looked like he had gone out on a sports car.

He probably didn’t expect Bai Mo to recover so quickly.

Bai Mo couldn’t come and look for Liu Chao either. The most important thing now was to immediately return to the s galaxy and deal with Liu Chao later!

Bai Mo rushed to the place where the interstellar shuttle was stored.

“But after searching for a long time, he still couldn’t find the interstellar shuttle that was stored back then. ”

What was going on?

Bai Mo frowned tightly.

Could it be that she remembered the wrong place?

“Just as Bai Mo was wondering if there was a problem with her memory, a figure appeared behind her. “Bai Mo, you can’t go back.” ”
