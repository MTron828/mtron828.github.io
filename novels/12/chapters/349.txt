“Ye Zhuo had already recovered her natural state. At this moment, she was sitting in front of her computer, typing furiously on her keyboard. ”

“Actually, this was just a superficial phenomenon. ”

Ye Zhuo’s heart was already in a state of panic.

That was her first kiss just now.

It was the first time in her past life and this life!

“Ye Zhuo.”

A deep voice sounded above her head.

“Huh?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and bumped into those dark and heavy eyes.

“Here’s the Iced Coke You Wanted.”Cen Shaoqing handed the coke over.

Ye Zao took the coke and took a sip.

“The Iced Coke entered his throat and instantly, his restless heart slowly settled down. ”

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes in satisfaction.

Cen Shaoqing drank a mouthful of iced water.

It was bland and tasteless.

He couldn’t help but be a little curious. was the taste of the Iced Coke that good?

“Cen Shaoqing continued, “Ye Zhuo.” ”

Ye Zhuo bit the straw and looked up at Cen Shaoqing.

“I’m going to Country P tomorrow.”

“OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”It might take a week for you to come back.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “If you’re free during this period of time, you can visit my house more often. My grandmother likes you very much.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo continued to drink his coke.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “My house has recently recruited a new dessert master. He is especially good at making Mousse desserts.” ”

“In the hot summer, a mouthful of ice-cold Mousse desserts spread on the tip of the tongue. The taste could not be better. ”

Ye Zhuo had no resistance to desserts. His eyes lit up. “Really?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“As expected, she was still a child. A single dessert could satisfy her so much. ”

Cen Shaoqing drank a mouthful of ice water.

“After drinking the coke, ye Zao went on with his work. Cen Shaoqing sat at the side and read a document. ”

The air was filled with the sound of typing.

“Occasionally, ye Zao would raise his head and say a few words to Cen Shaoqing. ”

The two of them got along very well.

“Soon, it was evening. ”

Ye Zhuo stood up and stretched. “Everything has been settled! It’s time for me to go home.”

Cen Shaoqing put down the documents in his hands. “It’s been hard on you. I know a restaurant that tastes really good. I’ll treat you to dinner tonight.”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo did not stand on ceremony with him.

The restaurant Cen Shaoqing mentioned was near the CEN Group.

The two of them found a seat by the window and sat down.

“Soon, a waiter came over. “Are you two ordering now?” ”

Cen Shaoqing handed the tablet to ye Zao. “I can eat whatever I want. You Can Order.”

Ye Zao ordered two meat dishes and three vegetarian dishes. He also instructed the waiter not to put scallions and garlic in the vegetarian dishes.

Buddhism forbade five meat dishes and five spices.

“Five spices referred to scallions, garlic, leeks, onions, and Xing qu. ”

“Xing Qu was an Indian spice that was passed down in the western regions, but it was not available in the country at the moment. ”

The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled into an unnoticeable arc.

Ye Zhuo had actually noticed the scallions and garlic.

“She was concerned about him, wasn’t she? ”

A certain part of his heart seemed to fill up quickly.

It was a very strange feeling.

“Nothing particularly happy had happened, but he was very happy. ”

He was even a little excited.

“Ye Zhuo looked up at Cen Shaoqing and said, “You haven’t ordered the staple food yet. How about some mushroom and vegetable porridge?” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing still looked the same. He nodded slightly and did not have any objections.

Ye Zhuo added more vegetables and mushroom porridge and handed the plate to the waiter. “These will do.”

“The waiter nodded. “Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

“Soon, the dishes were served. ”

“Cen Shaoqing ate at a moderate pace, looking extremely elegant. ”

He was obviously well-educated.

“Ye Zhuo picked up a drumstick and asked curiously, “Don’t you feel anything when you see me eating a big drumstick?” ”

“Is there a difference between drumsticks and vegetables?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Drumsticks are meat! Aren’t you curious at all about the taste of meat?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing took a sip of the porridge. “In my eyes, their only use is to fill the stomach.” ”

“Ye Zao took a bite of the chicken drumstick. “You’re really a magical person! You say that you earn so much money, but you don’t eat, drink, or enjoy yourself. What do you want?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up at Ye Zao, and his deep eyes were black. “In the past, I didn’t know what I wanted, but now I know.” ”

“Then what do you want?”Ye Zao was curious.

“Keep it a secret.”Cen Shaoqing put down the spoon and took out a tissue to wipe his mouth.

“He sat casually, but it couldn’t hide his natural noble aura. In addition, Ye Zao was sitting opposite him. For a time, he attracted many people’s attention. ”
