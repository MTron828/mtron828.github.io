Bai Mo looked at Bai Jingshu with a smile on her face. She felt extremely happy in her heart.

“When she thought about how Bai Jingshu could only be a lowly earthling, she would always have to suppress Bai Jingshu. Bai Mo felt even more happy. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Thank you.” ”

“”Sister, you’re too polite.”Bai Mo continued, “As your sister, I hope that you can be happy more than anyone else. Now that I see you with Mr. Lin, I’m relieved. I believe that Mr. Lin will definitely make you happy.” ”

Bai Jingshu looked at Bai mo. “I also hope that you can find your own happiness as soon as possible.”

“Bai Mo lowered her head and said a little embarrassedly, “Then I’ll give you my blessing.” ”

“After saying that, Bai Mo seemed to have thought of something and continued, “In the future, when Mr. Lin is with my sister, won’t he be my brother-in-law? Brother-in-law, you have to treat my sister well. Otherwise, I won’t let you off!” ”

“Lin Ze nodded. “Don’t worry, I definitely won’t bully her.” ”

“”That’s good.”Bai Mo saw with her own eyes that Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze’s relationship was indeed good, so she heaved a sigh of relief. “Sister, brother-in-law, I still have other things to do, so I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Take care on the road.”

“I know.”Bai Mo turned to leave.

“Lin Ze looked at Bai Mo’s back and said, “This sister of yours has bad intentions. Try to keep a distance from her in the future. Otherwise, you won’t even know that she has set you up one day.” ”

“How did you tell?”Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze.

“Lin Ze continued, “From the first time we met, I felt that she was different from other girls.”Lin Ze seemed to have the ability to judge girls, just like how he disliked Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian from a very young age. ”

“If he could not differentiate between good and bad, he would definitely treat Feng Qianhua as his own mother. After all, Feng Qianhua had watched him grow up. ”

“When he was very young, old Mrs. Lin had even asked Feng Qianhua to feed Lin Ze milk. However, Lin Ze seemed to know something and would rather drink milk powder than Feng Qianhua’s. ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “Your feeling is correct. Bai Mo was involved in Chen Yaosheng’s matter last time.”

“Otherwise, would chen Yaosheng know about her hobbies? ”

It was obvious that Bai Mo had given all her personal information to Chen Yaosheng.

“However, Bai Jingshu only found out about this after the incident. ”

“Hearing this, Lin Ze frowned slightly. “Did you tell her about this?” ”

“”No.”Bai Jingshu shook her head, then, she said, “I don’t want to see Grandpa in a dilemma. Bai Mo has been reminding Grandpa that he is biased in front of him. If I bring this up, Grandpa will definitely stand up for me. By then, second uncle and second aunt’s family might not be able to handle it. “It’s better to avoid trouble. It’s worth it to see a person clearly through this matter. I’ll just stay away from her in the future.” ”

“Bai Jingshu had a gentle personality. She tried her best to avoid trouble, especially if she didn’t want to make things difficult for the old man. ”

The Old Man’s greatest wish in his life was to see the younger generation as amiable and amiable.

“If Bai Mo really provoked her, she wouldn’t sit still and wait for death. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “In the future, if Bai Mo dares to make things difficult for you again, just tell me that when dealing with people like Bai Mo, you must never repay a grudge with kindness.” ”

“When dealing with Bai Mo, one must repay a grudge with kindness. ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Lin Ze continued, “When do you plan to return to Earth?” ”

Bai Jingshu thought for a moment. “I want to accompany grandfather for a few more days.”

“Okay.”

“What About You?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”I’ll wait for you to go back together,”Lin ze said. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “If you’re busy, you can go back first. I can do it alone.” ”

“”I’m not busy.”Lin Ze reached out and put his arm around Bai Jingshu’s shoulder. “If I don’t even have time to spend with my girlfriend, how can I be considered a boyfriend?” ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Bai Jingshu chuckled. “I didn’t realize you were so sweet in the past.”

“In Bai Jingshu’s impression, Lin Ze had always been cold and indifferent. He didn’t say much to anyone. ”

“”I’m telling the truth,”Lin ze said. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I’m serious too. If you’re busy, go back first. I can really do it alone. Don’t let me delay your work.” ”

“It’s nothing serious. I know what I’m doing.”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “I’ll accompany Grandpa for another three days.”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze put the gifts into Bai Jingshu’s aircraft. “When you go back later, bring these things to Grandpa. Although I can’t go over, it’s a token of my appreciation.” ”
