Translator: 549690339

“White-haired lord grim, time never defeats a beauty. ”

“It was very rare that old Mrs. Cen didn’t call Cen Shaoqing a brat today. Instead, she had a kind expression and said with a smile: “Shaoqing, hurry up and set off. Don’t delay the auspicious hour.” ”

The appointed auspicious hour was 8:00 and they would arrive at the Lin family’s house at 8:58.

“The two families were not far apart and could arrive in twenty minutes. However, it was the wedding today, so the speed of the car could not be too fast. ”

“”Yes, Grandma.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and left with the best man team, the motorcade, and the other people who were going to pick up the bride ”

8:30.

Ye Zao had already finished preparing and was waiting for Cen Shaoqing to pick him up.

“At this moment, the door was pushed open. ”

“Zao Zao!”

“When he saw who it was, ye Zao’s eyes were filled with surprise. “Pingting!” ”

An Lizi was also very surprised. “Didn’t you say that you couldn’t come?”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “I fired the boss.” ”

“”Good for you,”an Lizi said. ”

“Zhao pingting continued, “I was just joking. Actually, the reason why I said that I couldn’t come was to give Zao Zao a surprise. How could I not come when she’s getting married!” ”

“Ye Zao was not only her best friend, but also the most important person in her life. ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“After saying that, Zhao pingting continued, “I’m not the only one here. My parents are here too.” ”

“Uncle and aunt are here too?”

“Yes.”

The Lin family was filled with guests today. Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were so busy that their feet did not touch the ground.

Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu were the same.

8:58 pm.

The wedding car arrived at the Lin family’s entrance on time.

The sound of firecrackers filled the sky.

“Li Yueyue immediately reacted. She stood up and said, “Pingting, quick, quick, lock the door! I’m going to Hide My Shoes!” ”

An Lizi took out some prank tools that she had bought at night.

“There were cling film covers, finger pressure plates, and lipstick. ”

“Before the groom and the groomsmen could go upstairs, the door was locked. ”

“On the other side, Cen Shaoqing led the groomsmen and his friends to the door. ”

“Open the door!”He Ziteng knocked on the door.

“Who is it?”Li Yueyue asked deliberately.

“”It’s a wedding reception,”he ziteng answered. ”

“”Wedding reception? What wedding reception?”An Lizi continued, “Let the person who came to pick up the bride speak.” ”

“”Fifth brother, I’m asking you to speak!”He ziteng immediately made way for Cen Shaoqing to stand in front. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s heart was pounding non-stop. He suppressed the restlessness in his heart and opened his thin lips. “Leader, open the door.” ”

“”Your voice is too soft. Your leader can’t hear you,”Zhao Pingting continued. ”

“Cen Shaoqing cleared his throat and continued, “Leader, I’m here to pick you up.” ”

“I heard you. Where’s your sincerity?”

“Sincerity?”Cen Shaoqing turned to look at he ziteng.

“He ziteng naturally did not expect Cen Shaoqing to understand what sincerity was. Although Cen Shaoqing was getting married, he was more attentive than Cen Shaoqing. He specifically investigated how to bribe the bridesmaids to let them open the door. ”

He ziteng took out a bunch of red packets from his bag. “There’s naturally time for sincerity. Open the door and I’ll pass the sincerity in.”

Zhou chuyue gave he ziteng a thumbs up.

Amazing!

Truly amazing!

An Lizi’s voice came from inside the door. “Open the door? Do you think we’re Stupid? You can shove sincerity in through the door.”

He ziteng had no choice but to shove the red packets through the door.

“After receiving the red packets, the three of them were extremely excited. Li Yueyue smiled and said, “I didn’t expect he ziteng to be so smart.” ”

“An lizi continued, “He was taught by Master Wu. You Don’t even know how straight he used to be.” ”

He ziteng had chased an Lizi before. That straight man’s behavior almost scared an Lizi to death.

“Although he ziteng looked okay, he was really not an Lizi’s type. ”

“After receiving the red packet, the three of them opened the door. Just as they opened a crack, they were pushed open by the groomsmen and bridal party outside the door. ”

“You’re in! You’re in!”

“Cen Shaoqing was dressed in a red wedding gown and held a bouquet of flowers in his hands. He looked at Ye Zhuo, who was sitting upright on the bed. ”

“She stood straight and held a fan in her hand, covering her flowery face. ”

“”Leader, I’m here to bring you home.” ”

“An Lizi crossed her arms across her chest. “Master Five, is this your attitude when you bring your leader Home?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

“He ziteng immediately whispered to Cen Shaoqing, “Fifth brother, kneel, kneel.” ”

“In the past, he ziteng might have been worried that Cen Shaoqing was unwilling to kneel because of his chauvinism. ”

But now...

He wouldn’t.

Because CEN Shaoqing had no bottom line in front of ye Zhuo.
