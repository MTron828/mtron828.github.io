“Chapter 801: 176: Old Mrs. Lin’s retribution, the burning began to torture the dregs! 5”

Translator: 549690339

Miracle?

“If a miracle could be so easily seen, would it still be called a miracle?”

A huge rock in Feng Xianxian’s heart finally fell to the ground.

“When Old Mrs. Lin woke up again, the tip of her nose was filled with the choking smell of medicine.”

She was...

In the ward?

Old Lady Lin tried to move her hands.

“However, it was as if her hands were weighed down by a huge rock. She could not lift them up at all. Her hands and feet could not move.”

“Old Lady Lin tried to open her mouth again. “Ah, ah...””

A complete sentence turned into a broken syllable when it reached her mouth.

“”Elder sister, you’re Awake?”At this moment, an old man with a walking stick walked over. He looked at Old Lady Lin and said, “Elder sister, you’re looking for your granddaughter, right?””

“”Your granddaughter went downstairs to buy food. Don’t worry, she’ll be up soon.””

Who was this old man’s granddaughter?

Was It Ye Zhuo?

“Thinking of this, a glimmer of hope appeared in Old Lady Lin’s eyes.”

“After saying this, the old man continued, “Elder sister, you’re a lucky person. Your granddaughter stayed in front of your bed all night last night. Her eyes were swollen from crying!””

“At this moment, footsteps could be heard from outside the ward.”

A figure walked in from outside.

“The old man smiled and turned around. “Xianxian, you’re back. Your grandmother has already woken up.””

Hearing this.

The light of hope in Old Lady Lin’s eyes instantly disappeared without a trace.

Feng Xianxian...

Why was it still Feng Xianxian.

“To the current Old Lady Lin, Feng Xianxian was a devil.”

“Feng Xianxian walked over with a smile, “Grandma Liu, I don’t know what you like to eat, so I brought you a portion of preserved egg and lean meat porridge.””

“”Look at you, child, why are you still buying it for me! I Can’t Take This! You can give it to your grandmother.””

“Feng Xianxian directly placed the preserved egg and lean meat porridge on the old man’s bedside table, “I also bought a portion for my grandmother, so you can eat it. Your legs aren’t good, so it’s not convenient for you to go downstairs to buy things.””

“The old man was extremely grateful. He turned around to look at Old Lady Lin and said enviously, “Elder sister, why do you think I don’t have the same fortune as you?”At the end of his sentence, the old man sighed.”

Old Lady Lin looked at the old man.

It was as if she could see herself in the past.

“At that time, everyone said that Feng Xianxian was up to no good.”

“However, she seemed to have been possessed.”

She was determined to go her own way.

She had hurt the people closest to her for Feng Xianxian!

“At the thought of this, Old Lady Lin’s eyes turned red once again, and tears streamed down her face.”

She was wrong.

She was really wrong.

“If she was given a chance, she was willing to kneel down in front of everyone and repent.”

“When the old man saw Old Lady Lin Crying, his eyes also turned red. He said emotionally, “Elder sister, Don’t cry. When you cry, I’m going to cry too. With such a good granddaughter, you should laugh.””

Laugh?

“When she heard this, Old Lady Lin felt that it was extremely ironic.”

She was indeed very funny!

She was the biggest joke in the world!

“Feng Xianxian sat by the bed and opened the disposable lunch box to feed Old Lady Lin. “Grandma, you haven’t eaten for a day. Hurry up and eat something.””

Old Lady Lin only wanted to strangle Feng Xianxian right now. How could she be willing to open her mouth?

“Feng Xianxian cried, “Grandma, I know that you’re feeling very uncomfortable right now and can’t accept this reality, but things have already happened. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of you in the future. “It’s okay if you can’t walk anymore. In the future, I’ll be your leg. Wherever you want to go, I’ll accompany you!””

“The old man beside her also advised Old Lady Lin, “Elder sister, this child is giving you a token of his appreciation. Just eat a little. Xianxian was worried that you wouldn’t be able to make it last night and didn’t sleep a wink. You should eat a little more so that this child can rest assured!””

The old man felt that Old Lady Lin was a little insensible.

“Feng Xianxian was so nice, but Old Lady Lin didn’t appreciate it.”

“If she had such a good granddaughter, she would wake up laughing in her dreams.”

Some people...

Really did not know how blessed they were.

“Old Lady Lin glared fiercely at Feng Xianxian, and there was something she wanted to say in her heart.”

“However, she could not say a single word.”

She hated herself!

“Right now, she wished that she could go back to three months ago and slap her stupid self to wake up.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Unfortunately.

There was no medicine for regret in this world for her to eat.

“”Grandma, I’m begging you, just eat a little.”Feng Xianxian sighed. If people who did not know saw her, they would really think that she was a good and filial granddaughter, “Grandma, I Know You’re blaming me for not arranging a VIP ward for you, but we don’t have any money now. All my money has been spent on your surgery...””
