“When she heard this, Yang Jiao fainted on the spot.”

...

“When XI Weiyue returned to the Xi family’s villa, she saw the notice of the court pasted on the wall.”

Xi Weiyue’s brows jumped. “Mom! What’s going on?”

Jiang Yan walked out of the house with an ugly expression. “Your mom fainted...”

Xi Weiyue quickly ran into the house and saw Yang Jiao lying on the bed.

Yang Jiao opened her eyes at that moment. “Weiyue.”

“Xi Weiyue’s face was pale. “Mother, what’s going on? Why is our villa being mortgaged to the court? Why did my father’s company suddenly become like this? Where’s Ye Langhua?””

Xi Weiyue had too many questions in her mind.

She did not know why things had become like this!

“One day ago, she was grandfather Ye’s heir, the Xi family’s eldest daughter.”

“But one day later, she was nothing. She did not even have a home anymore.”

Yang Jiao sobbed as she told her the general story of what had happened.

PA —

“When she heard this, the cup in Jiang Yan’s hand instantly fell to the ground and shattered into pieces.”

“She had not lived a wealthy life for long, was she going to be beaten back to her original state?”

Xi Weiyue’s heart was also flustered. “How did ye Langhua find out about these things?”No Wonder Zhao Xueyin dared to revoke her identity as the heir!

“Xi Weiyue originally thought that by coming back this time, she could invite ye Langhua over to make the decision for her.”

She did not expect that things would turn out like this.

“Yang Jiao sighed. “Weiyue, let’s Go! We’ll go to your grandmother’s house!””

“Then what about my father?”Xi Weiyue asked.

“Yang Jiao and Xi Muwen were husband and wife. How much true love could the old and young couple have? “Husband and wife are birds in the same forest. When disaster strikes, they’ll fly separately! If we don’t leave now, will your father’s creditors let us go when the time comes?””

“If ye Langhua did not find out the truth, then it would be fine.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Now, Ye Langhua already knew that Jiang Yan was not half a month old.”

Would ye Langhua still help them?

“Now, they could only save themselves!”

“Yang Jiao still had some private money hidden. If they did not leave now, then the mother and daughter would have to live under the overpass!”

Xi Weiyue was also a smart person. She quickly understood the stakes involved. “Alright! Then let’s Leave Now!”

Yang Jiao nodded.

“I want to go with you too!”Jiang Yan said.

“XI weiyue said coldly, “Go back to where you came from!””

“It had always been easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but it was difficult to go from extravagance to frugality. Jiang Yan did not want to return to the aid station, “It was the two of you who got me out of the aid station back then. Now, if you want me to go back, I’ll go back? How can there be such a cheap thing in this world? The two of you have to be responsible for the rest of my life!””

“Xi Weiyue could not care less about Jiang Yan anymore. She and Yang Jiao had to leave as soon as possible. “Mother, get up quickly. Let’s pack up and leave immediately!””

“Okay!”Yang Jiao sat up from the bed.

“Seeing that the mother and daughter dared to ignore her, Jiang Yan was so angry that her whole body was trembling. She reached out and pushed Xi Weiyue. “I’m talking to you!””

“Get lost!”Xi Weiyue directly waved away Jiang Yan’s hand.

“Jiang Yan was not easy to bully either. She grabbed Xi Weiyue’s hair and gave Xi Weiyue a slap, “Little B * Tch! You Little B * Tch! Do you really think that I’m easy to bully? When you wanted to use me, you used me with all your might. Now, you want to kick me open with a single kick? No Way!””

“Xi Weiyue was no match for Jiang Yan, so she was instantly pushed to the ground by Jiang Yan.”

“Yang Jiao was shocked. She didn’t expect Jiang Yan to suddenly attack Xi Weiyue, so she immediately got into a scuffle with Jiang Yan.”

Shunxi Financial Group.

Si lui returned to the top-floor office.

“Zhao Xueyin asked impatiently, “How’s brother Si?””

“Si lui said, “Ye Langhua found her biological daughter.””

“What do you mean?”Zhao Xueyin frowned. “Didn’t she find her biological daughter long ago?”

“The lawyer explained, “The ye family is not ye Banyue. The Real Ye Banyue is the wife of the head of the Lin family in the capital city, Ye Shu.””

“After saying that, the lawyer placed a document in front of Zhao Xueyin. “This is Ye Shu’s information?””

Zhao Xueyin picked up the document and looked at it. “She grew up in the countryside?”

“Yes.”The lawyer nodded.

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “How can a girl who grew up in the countryside suddenly become the wife of the head of the Lin Family?”
