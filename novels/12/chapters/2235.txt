“She would give them a grade-3 bloodstone, and she would give Bai Jingshu a top-grade Bloodstone! ”

“It’s not like he’s been biased for a day or two. He’s always been like this since he was young.”Bai Mo’s face was full of sarcasm. “Aren’t you used to it?”

“In any case, she was already used to it! ”

“Although she was a little used to it, Bai Mo still felt a little uncomfortable every time she saw elder Bai like this. ”

“This is too much! This is too much!”Bai Yuanyuan kicked the grass on the side of the road unhappily.

It was obvious that she had vented all her anger on the grass.

“At this moment, Bai Mo nudged Bai Yuanyuan with his elbow. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Bai Yuanyuan looked up.

“Bai Mo said, “Look.” ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Bai Yuanyuan followed his line of sight and saw Bai Jingshu’s figure.

“Didn’t you want to know what Grandpa gave Bai Jingshu?”Bai Mo asked in a low voice.

“Yes.”Bai Yuanyuan nodded.

“Bai Mo continued, “Go and ask her now.” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan said in surprise, “Ask Her Face to face? Can she tell us?” ”

“”Go and ask her,”Bai Mo said. ”

Bai Yuanyuan nodded and walked to Bai Jingshu’s side.

“Sister Jingshu.”

“Hearing Bai Yuanyuan’s voice, Bai Jingshu stopped and looked back. “Yuanyuan, what’s the matter?” ”

“Nothing big.”Bai Yuanyuan ran over and held Bai Jingshu’s hand. “Nothing big. I just want to walk with you and talk for a while.”

Bai Jingshu was actually a little opposed to Bai Yuanyuan’s action for no other reason than that Bai Yuanyuan and Bai Mo were too abnormal!

She didn’t know what Bai Yuanyuan was trying to do.

“Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “Sister Jingshu, this outfit of yours looks pretty good. Where did you buy it?” ”

“”On Earth,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Bai Yuanyuan’s smile instantly froze on her face. What was up with Bai Jingshu?

Was she here to disgust her on purpose?

“As expected, anyone could only be matched with what they wore. ”

A trash like Bai Jingshu who knew nothing could only be matched with this kind of low-grade outfit!

Bai Yuanyuan put on a fake smile. “I didn’t expect to buy such good-looking clothes on Earth.”

“”Yeah,”Bai Jingshu looked back and said, “Yuanyuan, I didn’t know that you like Earth’s clothing. If you like it, I’ll buy you a set when I have time to go to Earth.” ”

“Hearing that, Bai Yuanyuan’s face was full of disdain. She quickly waved her hand. “No, no, I don’t need it!” ”

She would never wear such low-class clothes!

“”Yuanyuan, please don’t stand on ceremony with me.”Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Actually, the clothes on Earth are not only good-looking, but they also have many functions.” ”

“”Thank you for your kindness, sister Jingshu, but I really don’t need it,”Bai Yuanyuan said. ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded and said with a smile, “Then, when you need it, you can contact me again.” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “Thank you, Sister Jingshu!” ”

“”You’re welcome. We’re sisters,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan held Bai Jingshu’s arm tightly and said, “Sister Jingshu, why didn’t I see Grandpa Give You a present just now?” ”

“”Maybe I went in first, so Grandpa gave it to me first,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Then what did Grandpa Give You? Is it the same thing as ours?”

Bai Jingshu shook her head. “It’s not quite the same.”

“Hearing that it was different, Bai Yuanyuan instantly perked up and said, “How is it different? Can I take a look?” ”

“”Sure.”Bai Jingshu nodded. Then, she took out the marriage amulet from her pocket. “This is it.” ”

“Bai Jingshu didn’t want to show the marriage talisman to Bai Yuanyuan, but she was afraid that Bai Yuanyuan would misunderstand and think that old master Bai had given her something good. ”

“What’s This?”Bai Yuanyuan frowned. “Talisman?”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “This is a marriage talisman. Grandpa wants me to find my home as soon as possible.”

“Grandpa gave you a marriage talisman?”Bai Yuanyuan didn’t believe it.

How was that possible!

Grandfather Bai gave them all level three Armored Beasts’blood stones. How could it be a marriage charm for Bai Jingshu?

Absolutely impossible!

Especially since Bai Jingshu was grandfather Bai’s favorite granddaughter.

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Just a marriage charm. Perhaps in grandfather’s eyes, nothing is more important than me finding a boyfriend.” ”

“”Sister Jingshu, we’re sisters, so don’t hide it! Tell me! What else did Grandpa Give You? ! I swear, I won’t tell anyone else!”Bai Yuanyuan hugged Bai Jingshu’s arm, she began to act coquettishly. ”

“”It really is just a marriage charm,”Bai Jingshu said. ”
