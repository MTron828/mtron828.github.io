Translator: 549690339

The moment this was said.

The entire room was silent.

Everyone knew that Miss Ye was already dead.

“But now, Miss Ye had actually returned! ”

No.

It wasn’t Ye Zao.

Ye Zao was already dead.

How could a person who was already dead suddenly come back to life?

Looking at the figure that was gradually approaching her.

“Ye Lan kept retreating, her face becoming extremely pale. ”

Everyone just looked at her like this.

Their expressions were all different.

Was this person really miss ye.

“Li Ziyue looked at her silhouette, and his pupils instantly became extremely large. ”

It was Miss Ye!

She was Miss Ye!

“Although he couldn’t see her face clearly, he recognized her temperament at once. ”

“At this moment, Li Ziyue’s eyes were slightly red. ”

Ye Zhuo had returned.

So was his hope.

“At this moment, she walked to Li Zi Yue’s side, bent down slightly, and placed her hand on old Dai’s pulse. ”

Old Dai opened his eyes weakly. “Miss... Miss Ye.”

She did not speak.

“In a moment, she took out a pill and let old Dai take it. ”

“”Who are you? !”Ye Lan looked down at her. She was very nervous, but her voice could not be heard. ”

“No matter what, she could not lose her footing now. ”

She did not believe that a person who had already died could still stand out and stir up trouble.

“Hearing this, the person who came stood up unhurriedly and looked at Ye Lan. ”

“Someone who came to clean up Miss Ye’s house.”

A very cold voice.

It made people’s hair stand on end.

“After saying this, she unhurriedly took off the cap on her head and met Ye Lan’s gaze. ”

A face was exposed to the air.

This face was very ordinary.

“It was not just ordinary, it was also somewhat ugly. ”

“A round face. Although the eyes were not small, the skin was a little dark, and there were obvious freckles on both sides of the nose. ”

There was an unsightly birthmark on the right side of the face.

All in all.

This figure and Aura could not support this face.

Fortunately.

It was not ye Zao.

“As long as it was not ye Zao, she did not need to panic. ”

She knew that ye Zao was already dead.

It was just a dead person. There was nothing to be afraid of.

Ye Lan heaved a sigh of relief. She held the table behind her tightly and tried her best to calm herself down.

“When the others saw this face, the expression in their eyes also changed. ”

“No, it was not ye Zao? ”

How could this be?

“Especially Li Ziyue, the disappointment on his face was almost overflowing. ”

He had thought that he was going to see hope.

He did not expect that the person who came was not ye Zhuo at all. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Clean up the house?”Ye Lan curled the corners of her lips, her eyes full of sarcasm. “Your tone is not small. I just don’t know if you have the life to come, or if you have the life to go back!” ”

“Today, not a single person here could think of escaping! ”

“Leng Ye.”Ye Lan looked at Leng ye beside her.

“Yes.”Leng ye nodded.

“On this side, Leng ye had yet to make a move. In the next second, a gun was already pressed against Ye Lan’s head. ”

“Ye Zhuo held the gun slowly and said in a very faint tone, “Miss ye treats you as her biological sister. Is this how you treat her? HMM?” ”

Ye Zhuo had always treated ye LAN sincerely.

She did not expect that ye Lan would betray her one day.

She never thought that ye Lan would hold a grudge against her.

When she first met Ye Lan.

Ye Zhuo felt as if she had met her old self.

“The eight-year-old ye Lan was homeless on the streets and had no one to rely on. Every day, she had to undergo the baptism of strong acid rain. ”

“Every day, she hoped that her family would be able to find her. ”

“Or, it would be good for someone to help her. ”

Until that old Granny appeared in her life.

“Therefore, the first time ye Zhuo met ye Lan, she felt that she had met her long-lost relatives. ”

She brought her home.

She gave her luxurious living conditions and the best education...

“She did not expect that in the end, she actually raised an ingrate. ”

Ye Zhuo could not tell what kind of feeling it was.

It was because she was too conceited when she was young.

“She thought that she had arranged the best ending for everyone, but it was not the case. ”

What she thought was good was not good at all in the eyes of others.

“”She treats me as her biological sister?”Ye Lan sneered, “If she really treats me as her biological sister, why doesn’t she help me find my family! She knows it. She clearly knows that I want to find them even in my dreams! But what about her? How did she do it? To her, I’m just a chess piece! She just wants to use me! If it wasn’t for me, how could she show her good side!” ”

“Everyone said that ye Zao had the heart of a Bodhisattva, treating an orphan girl who wasn’t related by blood as if she was his own sister. ”

Ye Zao’s good name was all set off by her.
