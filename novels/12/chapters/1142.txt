“It’s good that no one is marrying me.”Jiang Xiaoyu snorted. “I don’t want to marry anyway!”

“You Little Girl!”Madam Jiang poked Jiang Xiaoyu’s head. “I asked the kitchen to save some food for you. Go and eat some.”

“I’m not hungry.”Jiang Xiaoyu walked to the entrance and began to change his shoes.

“You still want to go out at this time of Night?”Madam Jiang asked curiously.

Jiang Xiaoyu nodded. “I’ll go out for a walk first.”

“It’s too late. Why Don’t You Go Out Tomorrow?”Madam Jiang was a little worried.

“It’s fine.”Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t care at all. “I often do this abroad. is the security in the country worse than abroad?”

Madam Jiang sighed helplessly. “Then you have to be careful.”

“Got it.”Jiang Xiaoyu waved her hand and walked out.

“As soon as she walked out of the door, Jiang Xiaoyu immediately regained her dejected look. ”

She was a little worried now. What If ye Zhuo ignored her?

“After all, she had treated ye Zhuo like that before... ”

“”Miss, are you going out?”The driver came up to her and asked. ”

“Yes.”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded. “I’m going to No. 526 Haicheng Road.”

“”Okay, get in the car.” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu got in the car in a daze.

“The driver saw that she seemed to have something on her mind, so he took the initiative to talk to her. “Miss, did you encounter something unhappy?” ”

“”No.”Jiang Xiaoyu shook her head. At this moment, she suddenly saw a dessert house that was open for business. “Uncle Liu, please pull over. I’m going to buy some dessert.” ”

“Do you want to eat desserts?”Uncle Liu asked.

“Yes.”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded.

“Uncle Liu smiled and said, “If you want to eat blow-up desserts, I know a very good dessert shop! Although it’s not a big brand, the taste definitely made you eat the first time and want to eat the second time. Do you want to try it?” ”

“”Okay, let’s go to the place you mentioned, Uncle Liu.” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”Okay!”At the next intersection, Uncle Liu turned the steering wheel to the left. ”

This dessert shop was located in a very remote alley.

The owner was a young couple.

All the desserts in the shop were handmade.

The prices were not expensive.

“But once they entered, they could smell a fragrance that could not be stopped. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu took a deep breath. “It smells so good.”

“”Miss, what would you like to eat?” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “Would you like to have one serving of every dessert in your store?” ”

“”Can you eat all of them? Our store doesn’t add any additives to our desserts, so the shelf life is very short.” ”

“Hearing that, Jiang Xiaoyu thought about it seriously. ”

“From Ye Zhuo’s actions, it could be seen that she was a very frugal person. ”

“If she caused a waste, it would be the opposite! ”

“After a while, Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Then, then give me one serving of every dessert that you think is delicious! Two servings to go!” ”

“Okay.”The beautiful lady boss nodded.

“Adding on the delay in buying the dessert, Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t arrive at the Ye residence until nine o’clock. ”

“Standing in front of the Ye residence, Jiang Xiaoyu was very nervous. ”

“After hesitating for ten minutes, she finally mustered up her courage and rang the doorbell. ”

“Soon, the door opened! ”

“”Dear guest, Hello Duck!” ”

“”Xiaobai!”Jiang Xiaoyu said in surprise, “You know me?” ”

“Of course I know you! Didn’t you come here last night?”Xiaobai looked like an idiot.

“”It’s me, it’s me!”Xiaobai continued, “But next time, before you call me, you must add the words ‘cute’to my name!” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu smiled and said, “The cute Xiao Baibai!” ”

“Come in quickly!”

Jiang Xiaoyu followed behind Xiao Baibai.

“That? Isn’t miss ye at Home?”

“”Miss Ye? Who’s Miss Ye?”Xiao Baibai scratched his head in puzzlement. It took him a moment to react. “Oh! You’re talking about Great Scorch, aren’t you?” ”

“Yes!”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded.

“Xiao Baibai continued, “The Great Scorch is taking a shower! Take a seat for a while.” ”

“Okay.”Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t sit down even though she said it was okay.

She had come here without permission. It was better to wait for ye Zao to come out.

Xiao Baibai was busy pouring water for Jiang Xiaoyu.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the room. ”

Ye Zao Came.

Jiang Xiaoyu immediately stood up straight like a primary school student who had made a mistake.

“The next second, Ye Zhuo walked into the living room. ”

She had just taken a shower and was still wrapped in a white towel.

Her legs were long and white.

Her legs were so perfect that it was amazing.

“Even Jiang Xiaoyu, this woman, felt that they were perfect. ”
