“You’re back.”Auntie Wang nodded.

“”You Go!”Old Lady Lin pointed to the door and said, “Go and call them over!” ”

Auntie Wang immediately went to the east courtyard to look for Lin Jincheng.

“Hearing Auntie Wang’s intentions, ye Shu put down his chopsticks and stood up. “Then let’s go quickly.” ”

Lin Jincheng took out a tissue to wipe his mouth. “I’ll go.”

Old Lady Lin was definitely here to cause trouble.

Lin Jincheng did not want ye Shu to suffer any grievances in front of Old Lady Lin.

“Coincidentally, Ye Shu was too lazy to deal with Old Lady Lin. ”

Lin Jincheng followed Mrs Wang to the western courtyard.

“As expected, just as they reached the door, a glass glass smashed over. ”

Bang!

The glass shattered all over the floor.

“”Mom, it’s so early in the morning. What are you doing this time?” ”

Old Lady Lin walked out of the room in a rage. “Let me ask you! Did you know that Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman were getting married?”

“Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Who allowed them to get married? Who allowed you to attend his wedding? I’m Still Alive! Do you all think I’m Dead?” ”

Old Lady Lin was furious when she thought about how Lin Qingxuan had married Xia Xiaoman behind her back.

“She was the old lady of the Lin family, Lin Qingxuan’s biological mother. However, Lin Qingxuan had avoided her and married Xia Xiaoman! ”

What was she then?

Old Lady Lin felt that her dignity had been challenged.

“Lin Jincheng was not angry and continued, “Mom, fourth brother should have told you about his wedding yesterday, right? He also invited you to attend his and fourth sister-in-law’s wedding. It was you who didn’t want to Go!” ”

“”Fourth sister-in-law?”Old Lady Lin pointed at Lin Jincheng and said, “Who is your fourth sister-in-law? Let me tell you! As long as I don’t die, I will not acknowledge that B * Tch Xia Xiaoman!” ”

Lin Jincheng frowned. “It doesn’t matter if you don’t admit it. I will admit that she is my fourth sister-in-law!”

“What did you say?”Old Lady Lin was furious. “Say It Again!”

What did Lin Jincheng mean by that?

Did he mean that she was no longer in charge of the Lin Family?

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Even if you let me say it ten more times, it won’t change the fact that Xia Xiaoman is my fourth sister-in-law.” ”

“”It’s all wrong! It’s all wrong!”Old Lady Lin was so angry that her eyes were red. “Lin Jincheng, I’m your biological mother! I carried you for ten months to give birth to you, and now you’re treating me like this! Do you still have a conscience? !” ”

“One cry, two bickering, and three hanging. ”

“Lin Jincheng had long been fed up with Old Lady Lin’s behavior. “Mother, if you have nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Jincheng’s back and was so angry that she couldn’t say a word for a long time. If it weren’t for sister-in-law Wang supporting her from behind, Old Lady Lin would have fainted long ago. ”

“Now, even Lin Jincheng had begun to ignore her. ”

It must be ye Shu. Ye Shu was instigating her from behind.

“If it weren’t for ye Shu instigating her from behind, Lin Jin Cheng wouldn’t have ended up like this. ”

Her family was unlucky!

This was simply the misfortune of her family!

Her two sons had been bewitched by the woman from Yun Jing!

Madam Lin went to look for the other brothers of the Lin family.

“When she found out that Lin Qingfan and Wu Mei were still staying in the hotel, Madam Lin immediately rushed to the hotel. ”

“Without saying a word, madam Lin slapped Wu Mei across the face. ”

Wu Mei was stunned. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

“After being married to the Lin family for so many years, this was the first time Madam Lin had hit her! ”

Lin Qingfan was also shocked. He immediately stood in front of Wu Mei and glared at her. “Mom! What are you doing? !”

“”What am I doing? I should be the one asking you, what do you want to Do?”Old Lady Lin continued, “I’m not dead yet! All of you are overstepping your authority! Let me ask you, who agreed to let you officiate Qing Xuan’s wedding? And who agreed to the matter between Qing Xuan and Xia Xiaoman? !” ”

“If Lin Qingfan and Wu Mei hadn’t made the decision to officiate Lin Qingxuan’s wedding, would Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman have successfully held their wedding? ”

All the relatives of the Lin family were present!

She was the only one missing!

How would those relatives view an old lady like her?

Saying that she was heartless?

“When a biological son got married, the one who hosted the wedding wasn’t her mother, but the eldest son and eldest daughter-in-law of the family! ”

She wasn’t dead yet!

“”I agreed to this! What does it have to do with Wu Mei?”Lin Qing fan continued, “If there’s anything, just come at me! What right do you have to hit Wu Mei? ! You have to apologize to Wu Mei Right Now!” ”
