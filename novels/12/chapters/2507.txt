“As Cen Shaoqing spoke, she untied the ribbon that covered ye Zao’s eyes. ”

“As the ribbon scattered, ye Zao slowly opened his eyes. The scene in front of her made her slightly stunned. ”

All she could see was an endless amount of red.

The air was filled with a faint fragrance.

It was roses.

It was as if he was in a sea of roses.

It was especially magnificent!

“No matter what time it was, girls always had a romantic heart. ”

And roses were the representative of romance.

There were almost no girls who didn’t like flowers.

Especially roses.

“At this time of year, it was still a little difficult to gather so many roses in this city of the South China Sea. ”

It would be a lie to say that it was not shocking to see so many roses.

No wonder Cen Shaoqing had asked her to close her eyes when the helicopter was near the island. This was the reason.

“”Sear Sear,”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Sear, he continued, “One rose represents that you are the only one in my heart; two roses represent that I love you; three roses represent that I love you; Four Roses represent that I promise you that I will never change; five roses represent that I love you with no regrets; six roses represent that we are united forever and Wish You a lifetime of peace; seven roses represent... ... 99 Roses represent my love, 999 Roses represent my love for you to the end of time. I have many 999 roses here, representing my love for you to the end of Time!” ”

“”Burning, I love you.” ”

“As soon as he said that, a small drone flew over from the sky. ”

A heart-shaped balloon was hanging on the drone.

“Under his feet was a sea of red roses. When he raised his head, he saw the blue sky and white clouds. Then, a heart-shaped balloon flew over. It was as romantic as a movie. ”

The drone flew closer and closer until it stopped in front of Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing reached out to take the balloon and took out the diamond ring that was hidden on the balloon.

“Then, he knelt on one knee and looked at ye Zao. He said word by word, “Miss Ye, marry me.” ”

“The diamond, which was as big as a pigeon egg, shone with a rainbow-colored light under the sunlight. ”

“Ye Zao knew that Cen Shaoqing was planning to propose, but she did not expect that the day would come so soon. ”

“Moreover, all of this did not seem to be something that Cen Shaoqing, a steel-like straight man, could do. ”

“Ye Zao thought that Cen Shaoqing would just kneel down and say, “Leader, marry me.”Then it would be over. He did not expect that CEN Shaoqing would have the same sense of ceremony as Cen Shaoqing. ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo even felt like he was dreaming. ”

It was very unreal.

When did the steel-like straight man become enlightened?

“As he finished speaking, Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips and said slowly, “From now on, I’m yours. Everything I own belongs to you. If you want me to go east, I’ll Never Go West. If you want me to wash clothes, I’ll never cook.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing paused and continued, “With your surname and my name, Miss Ye, allow me to be your subordinate.” ”

His tone was low and his pleasant voice was charming.

“Especially when he deliberately lowered his voice, it was simply irresistible. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Like now.

“Although he was 20 centimeters taller than ye Zhuo, he was a lot shorter than her when he knelt on one knee. He looked up at her with a serious expression, and her figure was reflected in his dark pupils. ”

It was as if she was the only one left in the world.

“Ye Zhuo also lowered his eyes at this moment. His gaze overlapped with his. After that, she appeared in his eyes, and she appeared in her eyes as well. ”

She was loyal and unswerving.

“After a moment, she placed her hand in front of Cen Shaoqing and opened her red lips slightly. “Okay.” ”

Just the simple word ‘okay’stirred up a storm in Cen Shaoqing’s heart.

“Although he already knew the answer, Cen Shaoqing still couldn’t control his excitement the moment ye Zao stretched out his hand. ”

He was very excited.

This feeling was indescribable.

His heart was about to jump out.

Thump thump thump.

Again and again.

“Like Ye Zao, he also had the illusion that he was dreaming. ”

Thus.

“Cen Wu Ye, who had always been high and mighty, had a feeling of panic for the first time. ”

He didn’t even know what to do.

He was stunned.

His mind went blank.

“”What are you standing there for?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “If you don’t say anything, I’m going to go back on my words.” ”

Cen Shaoqing finally reacted and immediately grabbed ye Zhuo’s hand.

“Next, should he put a ring on her finger. ”

“Do... do I have to put it on?”Cen Shaoqing had already forgotten about the planned procedure.
