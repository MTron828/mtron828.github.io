“After the paternity test, master Cao thought that ye Zao was no longer a full moon and that this was just a mistake. ”

Who would have thought...

“Man Xing continued, “Ye Zao is my biological sister, and Man Wen is her biological brother. That’s why she helped man Wen. Otherwise, who else in the entire s galaxy would have the qualifications to gather so many big shots?” ”

“Maybe it’s for other reasons?”Master Cao said.

Man Xing shook his head. “There’s no other reason. My intuition has always been very accurate.”

Ye Zao was definitely a full moon.

“After saying that, man Xing looked at Master Cao. “Master, other than the paternity test, what other way can you prove that she is a full moon?” ”

Master Cao shook his head.

“Even if he could prove that ye Zao was a full moon now, it would be useless. ”

“After all, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had abandoned ye Zao first. ”

“Man Xing seemed to have seen through master Cao’s eyes, then he said, “They did abandon her, but what does all this have to do with me? I didn’t abandon her! I’m still her biological sister, her biological sister. She can support man Wen, so why can’t she support me!” ”

“Man Xing understood ye Zao’s current power too well. Although she was no longer the monarch of changyue, as long as she spoke, the real power of Changyue was still in her hands. ”

“In fact, master Cao was also very curious as to why ye Zao would treat Man Wen so well. ”

“Logically speaking, if ye Zao was really a full moon, she should hate the entire family, but ye Zao treated man Wen... ”

“Man Xing was also right. She and man Wen were both ye Zao’s biological sister and younger brother. If ye Zao treated man Wen so well because of their blood relationship, he should not treat man Wen alone. ”

“As an elder sister, Ye Zao should be fair. ”

“Compared to man Xing, Man Wen was trash. ”

What qualifications did man Wen have?

“Thinking of this, master Cao narrowed his eyes. “Xing ‘er, I think this must be ye Zao’s conspiracy.” ”

“What Conspiracy?”Man Wen asked.

“Master Cao continued, “She deliberately treated man Wen so well because she wanted to raise a marionette that could work for her.” ”

Ye Zao would definitely not treat Manwen so well for no reason!

“”I don’t think so.”Manxing shook his head and continued, “With Ye Zao’s current status in the s galaxy, she doesn’t need to do anything unnecessary.” ”

“Ye Zao was now Miss Ye, who had made her name in Chang Yue country. She was also the fiancee of the young master of the main alliance country. Did she want anything? Why did she need to spend so much effort to raise a marionette in Manxing Country? ”

“Hearing this, master Cao frowned.”... then, should we continue with our plan?” ”

“”Continue,”said man Xing. ”

“”If we continue, what about ye Zao’s side?”Master Cao was in a difficult position. ”

“Since ye Zao had taken action to protect man Wen, he would definitely continue to protect him. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“With ye Zao around.., ”

“man Xing narrowed his eyes. “No matter how powerful ye Zao is, the blood in his body is the blood of his entire family. I don’t believe that I won’t be able to defeat her this time!” ”

They were born from the same root. She did not believe that she could be worse than ye Zao.

How could she be worse than ye Zao?

“She wanted to prove to ye Zao that even without ye Zao’s help, she could still drag man Wen down from the highest point and crush him into pieces! ”

“Master Cao also trusted man Xing very much. He nodded and said, “Xing ‘er, no matter what you do, I will support you!” ”

“Man Xing was right. She and Ye Zao were sisters from the same mother. The same blood flowed in their bodies, so man Xing was not necessarily inferior to ye Zao. ”

“Everyone needed explosive power. MAN XING had already been defeated by Ye Zao once, and he would definitely not be defeated a second time! ”

...

“When he returned to thoughtful rain pavilion, Ye Han’s heartbeat was still somewhat out of control. When he raised his head, he just happened to see ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing passing by the corridor side by side. ”

“Ye Han immediately stood up and walked out, stopping the two of them. “SIS, Mr. Cen.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo turned his head slightly.

“”Nothing.”Ye Han touched his nose and continued, “I, I want to talk to Mr. Cen. Mr. Cen, are you free?” ”

Cen Shaoqing turned his head to look at Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You go ahead.”

“Then I’ll go first.”Cen Shaoqing followed ye Han’s footsteps.

The two of them had just left when Shi Qingcheng put her arm around ye Zao’s shoulder from behind. “Zao Zao!”

“Oh?”Ye Zao glanced sideways slightly. “What’s Wrong?”

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “What do you think of me and Ye Xiaohan?” ”

Ye Zao was stunned.

“Shi Qingcheng explained, “That’s right. If I were to be together with Ye Xiaohan, would you object?” ”
