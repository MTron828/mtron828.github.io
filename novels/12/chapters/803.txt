Translator: 549690339

Who Is This?

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

It’s... Ye Zao?

What is ye Zao doing here?

Is he here to make a fool of himself?

“Seeing ye Zao Come Over, Old Lady Lin’s originally obscure eyes instantly filled with hope.”

Ye Zao.

It’s Ye Zao.

Ye Zao has finally arrived.

“This feeling was like someone who had lost their way in the desert, suddenly walking out of the desert and seeing the bustling city.”

Old Lady Lin just looked at Ye Zao.

She couldn’t even bear to blink her eyes.

“”Zao Zao.”Seeing ye Zao, Lin Jincheng, who was originally uneasy, suddenly felt reassured.”

Although ye Zao was only 20 years old.

She was more steady and self-controlled than many adults.

Even his father often felt inferior to her.

“Ye Zao suddenly came over, and the aggressive reporter immediately handed the microphone to ye Zao. “Are you the daughter of the Lin family who has been missing for many years?””

“”Excuse me, Miss Lin, what is the meaning of your words to Miss Feng?””

“”Did your father, president Lin, really kick old lady Lin out of the family and do nothing about it?””

What did wealthy families value the most?

Filial piety and reputation.

“If Lin Jin Cheng really did something outrageous, he would be finished after the media’s ferment.”

“As a well-known entrepreneur, he had to establish a correct view of the world for the people!”

“Ye Zao’s lips curled up slightly. He lowered his eyes and pressed down on the microphone that the reporter handed over. His clear and picturesque eyebrows seemed to be coated with a layer of snow. “I am ye Zao, Ye Zao’s Ye, Ye Zao’s Zao.””

“Ye Zao’s Ye, Ye Zao’s Zao.”

“It was a short sentence, but it was so powerful that it made people shudder.”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Regarding the questions that everyone has, I think that my grandmother is the most suitable person to answer them!””

Old Lady Lin?

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

What was ye Zao trying to do?

Could it be that ye Zao Could Cure Old Lady Lin?

No!

That was impossible!

“She had consulted all her life, and even the most authoritative doctor in Beijing could not do anything about Old Lady Lin’s illness.”

How could ye Zao Possibly Cure Old Lady Lin?

Feng Xianxian comforted herself in her heart.

“Hearing this, the reporter also frowned. “Miss Ye, don’t you feel that what you said is contradictory? Old Lady Lin can’t speak now, how can she dispel our doubts?””

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

She wanted to see how ye Zao would explain himself!

“Ye Zao’s brows remained the same. “My grandmother suffered a stroke because someone drugged her. As long as the poison in her body is removed, she can open her mouth to dispel elder sister’s doubts.””

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s heart skipped a beat.”

Ye... Ye Zao could really remove the poison in Old Lady Lin’s body?

“Also, how did ye Zao Know That Old Lady Lin was poisoned?”

What was going on?

Feng Xianxian’s face was slightly pale.

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s face was almost covered in tears.”

Biological granddaughter.

Ye Zao was indeed her biological granddaughter.

“Now that she knew that she was the one who was poisoned by Feng Xianxian, Ye Zao was probably the only one.”

“In the past, she had let ye Zao Down.”

“She had raised a tiger as a threat, and she had let someone down.”

“Ye Zao looked back slightly. “Miss Feng, my grandmother is still unable to speak. Why are you panicking?””

“Feng Xianxian tried her best to calm herself down. “Miss Ye, What’s there for me to panic about? Don’t slander me!””

“Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent, and the corners of his mouth held a hint of a smile. “I saw that Miss Feng’s face was so pale, and I thought that Miss Feng was panicking! Looks like I’ve misunderstood Miss Feng. I hope that Miss Feng can be as calm and composed as she is now.””

“As he finished speaking, ye Zao took out a silver needle.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“His fair fingertips twirled the silver needle. Under the light, it reflected a cold light.”

The others did not recognize this silver needle.

“Feng Xianxian, on the other hand, did. Back then, when Master Yu suddenly fell ill, ye Zao had used this silver needle to save Master Yu.”

What should he do?

What should he do now?

No!

No.

He could not let ye Zao Cure Old Lady Lin.

“Thinking of this, Feng Qianqian immediately stood in front of Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, what are you trying to do? Grandma’s body is not good to begin with. Do you want to kill Grandma?””

“Looking at Feng Qianqian who was blocking in front of her, Old Lady Lin wished she could stand up and bite her to death!”

Slut!

“Feng Qianqian, this slut.”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and the corners of his mouth curled into a faint smile. “Why? Are you feeling guilty?”

“”Why would I feel guilty?”Feng Qianqian continued, “I’m afraid that you’ll kill Grandma!””

“Ye Zao stretched out his hand and gently pushed Feng Qianqian aside. “Since you’re not feeling guilty, then don’t block the way.””

“She seemed to be gently pushing him away, but in fact, only Feng Qianqian knew how much strength ye Zao had.”
