What was the relationship between these two people?

What was going on?

“What surprised Cen Yuyan even more was that Lu Xiu was such a cold person. He was usually not interested in anything, but she did not expect him to have such a time! ”

“Cen Yuyan’s face alternated between green and white, as beautiful as a color palette. ”

Only after hearing Lu Xiu’s words did ye Zao remember the fact that she had a bunch of sons in the science and Technology World.

“Hello.”Ye Zao took the initiative to extend his hand to Lu Xiu.

“Looking at the hand that ye Zao handed over, Lu Xiu’s heart was extremely excited. His palm was covered with layers and layers of wet sweat as he shook ye Zao’s hand with a trembling hand. ”

He shook hands!

He had made a name for himself!

He actually shook hands with his father!

“If this were to be spread out, how many people would die of envy! ”

Lu Xiu’s heart almost jumped out of his chest.

“After shaking hands, Lu Xiu continued, “That father, can you give me an autograph?” ”

“Although Lu Xiu didn’t talk much in real life and was very low-key, in the world of Science and Technology, he was the complete opposite. Especially when he was chatting with the members of the Niu Hu Lu family online, he was practically telling them everything he knew. ”

“Now that he saw his idol in the world of Science and Technology, Lu Xiu just wanted to show off to those people in his family right away. ”

“If he didn’t sign his name, they definitely wouldn’t believe that it was true! ”

“Ye zhuo nodded slightly, “Where do you want to sign?” ”

“Lu Xiu rolled up the sleeves of his suit, revealing a white shirt. He also gave ye zhuo a marker pen, “Please sign my sleeve.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao took the pen.

Ye Zao signed Niu Hulu YC’s name on Lu Xiu’s sleeve.

“Thank you!”Lu Xiu bowed very respectfully to ye Zao.

Lu Xiu’s actions completely shocked everyone.

Everyone was very curious about who ye Zao was!

“Especially Cen Yuyan, she was so angry that her face turned pale. ”

“Lu Xiu was the kaolin flower that she couldn’t chase after, but now, this kaolin flower actually nodded and bowed to ye Zao with extreme respect. ”

What was this?

On what basis did ye Zao have?

Song Chenyu also frowned without leaving a trace.

“After knowing Lu Xiu for so many years, song Chenyu had never known that Lu Xiu had such a side to him. ”

“Usually, Lu Xiu had never lost his composure like this in front of her. ”

“If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, she almost couldn’t believe that this was Lu Xiu. ”

“Song Chenyu was originally the same as Cen Yuyan, thinking that ye Zao was being narcissistic. ”

She didn’t expect it.

“Not only was Lu Xiu calling ye Zao Daddy, he even got ye Zao to autograph it for him. ”

Could it be that Lu Xiu was a fan of ye Zao?

“After all, Ye Zao was a public figure. ”

Song Chenyu furrowed her brows without a trace.

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zao looked at Lu Xiu and continued: “Oh Right, let me introduce you. This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Ye Zao had a feeling that if she didn’t introduce Cen Shaoqing to Lu Xiu, this man would kill her. ”

“As expected, after ye Zao said this, the pressure on CEN Shaoqing lessened. ”

Lu Xiu was here asking for an autograph and calling him father. How could he not feel uncomfortable?

“”CEN Fifth Master.”Lu Xiu raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing, returning to his previous appearance. “Nice to meet you.” ”

“Nice to meet you.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Lu Xiu continued, “CEN fifth master, remember to treat our Dr. YC well. If you dare to bully her, our Niu Hulu family members are not to be trifled with.”Although CEN Fifth Master could control the sky with a single hand in the capital. ”

“But if he dares to bully ye Zhuo, then those who stand behind ye Zhuo Niu Hu Lu family, will certainly not give up. ”

“After all, Ye Zhuo with them. ”

It’s the light.

And faith.

“When Cen Shaoqing put his arm around ye Zhuo’s shoulder, “Rest assured, I certainly won’t bully her.” ”

“He ziteng continued, “Lu Xiu, aren’t you going to explain to us what’s going on? When did Master Wu’s girlfriend, Miss Ye, become your father?” ”

He ziteng wasn’t the only one who wanted to know the answer. The others in the room were also very curious.

Everyone craned their necks to listen to Lu Xiu’s answer.

“Lu Xiu raised his head to look at He ziteng, he continued, “Miss Ye is a big shot in our science and technology industry. She is also the youngest phd in the science and technology industry. She has made a lot of contributions to the science and technology industry. At the same time, she was also the first winner of last year’s science and Technology Competition! “Because Miss ye is really too amazing, all of us call her that.” ”

Hearing these words.

Everyone looked at each other. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

What did they just hear?
