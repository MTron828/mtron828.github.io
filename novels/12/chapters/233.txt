Translator: 549690339

Good night?

Ye Zao looked at the time on the top left corner of his phone.

It was only 10:30.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. Could it be that old people sleep so early?

“[ good night, old people. ] ”

Old People?

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly when he saw the message from ye Zao? Did He look very old?

Cen Shaoqing frowned and went to the bathroom.

He started to wash up.

He had always been self-disciplined.

He went to bed at 11 o’clock every night.

He got up at 7 o’clock in the morning.

Ten years went by as one day.

No one had ever been able to break his biological clock and his work and rest time.

...

In a certain corner of the city.

“In a sealed room, there were five computers. Four men and one woman were controlling the computers. ”

At this moment.

The computer that was still in operation suddenly had a blue screen!

“Boss! My computer was hacked!”

“My computer was hacked Too!”

“F * ck! My computer was Hacked Too!”

“...”

“The man who had a tattoo on his arm with his legs crossed immediately lost his composure when he heard this. He said angrily, “What’s going on? Don’t you all claim to be top-notch experts?” ”

“One of the slightly plump young men stood up and said, “We were about to break through the other party’s firewall, but it seems that they suddenly changed people...” ”

“Is this the reason why you were hacked?”The Tattooed Man was furious.

“As a professional hacker, he was actually hacked by the other party. What would happen if word got out? ”

The room was very quiet.

“After a while, the tattooed man continued, “Didn’t you say that the CEN Corporation’s Hacker W went overseas for a vacation recently? Other than W, who else could be a match for you guys?” ”

They specifically took advantage of W’s vacation to make their move.

They did not expect to still be tricked.

“We’ve fought w a few times before. This person’s style doesn’t seem like W’s.”

“”Indeed, it doesn’t! Although W is very powerful, under the combined efforts of the five of us, he can’t Hack our computers directly.” ”

“I think you guys are all trash!”

The Tattooed Man was furious and immediately got someone to send over a new computer.

The five of them were prepared to fight again. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“But this time, they couldn’t even log in to their own accounts. ”

“”Boss, my account has been stolen...” ”

“Mine has been stolen too!”

The tattooed man frowned. Only then did he realize that something was wrong. He quickly turned on his computer and realized that his account had been stolen too. The worst thing was that the date of his complaint was 100 years later!

“F * ck! This time I’ve Met a Thorn!”The tattooed man threw away the cigarette butt in his hand.

He had not participated in the attack just now.

This could only mean one thing.

The other party had traced their IP address and wiped them out!

Who was this person?

Since when did the hacker world have such a figure?

...

Today was the day that ye Shu returned from overseas.

“After breakfast, Ye Sen drove to the airport to pick ye Shu up. ”

“Ye Zhuo had to go to school today, so he naturally couldn’t go with her to pick ye Shu up. “Uncle, drive slowly on the road.” ”

“”Uncle, drive slowly on the road.”Little White imitated him. ”

“Got it.”Ye Sen patted Little White’s head.

Ye Shu’s flight was at nine o’clock in the morning.

Ye Sen had only arrived for a short while when he saw ye Shu walking out from inside with a suitcase.

“Sister!”Ye Sen waved at ye Shu excitedly.

“Ye Sen.”ye Shu ran over with the suitcase. “When did you come?”

“I just arrived.”Ye Sen took the suitcase from ye Shu.

“Ye Shu continued, “Did you go to school?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Sen nodded and said, “Sister, how have you been these days?” ”

“Very well!”

The two of them chatted as they walked.

“An hour later, they returned home. ”

Ye Sen rang the doorbell.

“Ye Shu said in puzzlement, “Didn’t Zhuozhuo go to school? Is there someone at home?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Who is it?”Ye Shu was very curious.

Ye Sen smiled mysteriously. “A new member.”

“”A new member?”Hearing this, Ye Shu became even more curious. ”

“Yes.”

“At that moment, the door opened. ”

“”Master, Welcome Home.” ”

“Ye Shu covered her mouth and said in surprise, “What is this thing?” ”

“Little White looked up. “Master, I’m not a thing! I’m the most advanced robot in the universe! You can call me little white!” ”

“When did our family buy a robot?”Ye Shu turned to look at Ye Sen.

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “We didn’t buy it. It was assembled by searing with a sweeping robot.” ”

“Searing assembled it?”Ye Shu’s face was full of disbelief.
