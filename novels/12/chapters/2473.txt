Things always turn around when they reach their limit.

Old Master Chen sighed.

“After Chen Siyao went back, she covered herself with the blanket and cried. ”

“In the following days, she refused to eat, not even taking a sip of water. ”

She wanted old master Chen to see her determination!

“In less than a day and a half, Chen Siyao’s entire person became depressed and her face turned pale. ”

“Hearing this news, Old Master Chen frowned. “She really went on a hunger strike?” ”

The housekeeper nodded. “Absolutely!”

“Then, the housekeeper added, “Eldest miss hasn’t eaten for quite a few meals.” ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “Let’s go take a look.” ”

“Okay.”The housekeeper nodded and immediately pushed old master Chen towards Chen Siyao’s courtyard.

“Very soon, they arrived at the east courtyard. ”

“When the servants saw Old Master Chen coming over, they immediately came over to welcome him, “Old Master, please come over and take a look! The eldest miss hasn’t eaten since yesterday, and she hasn’t eaten anything today! If this continues, how will her body be able to endure it!” ”

The housekeeper pushed Old Master Chen into the house.

“Chen Siyao sat there, her entire being devoid of energy. She was extremely dispirited, and there wasn’t even the slightest bit of luster in her eyes. ”

“Are you going to continue starving like this?”Old Master Chen asked at this moment.

Chen Siyao didn’t say anything. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Old Master Chen sighed and continued, “Why are you doing this?” ”

Chen Siyao still remained silent.

“”Yaoyao,”old master Chen looked at Chen siyao and said, “If you really can persist, I have a way to make Shiyu marry you.” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao’s eyes instantly lit up. She turned to look at Old Master Chen. “What Way?” ”

“Let Shi Yu know your attitude.”

“In other words, he was forcing her with his life! ”

“Chen Siyao was about to die, so how could song Shiyu not lower his head? ”

“Although doing so was a little unseemly, at this juncture, he couldn’t care less about being unseemly! ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao narrowed her eyes. “Then...” ”

“Before she could finish her sentence, old master Chen added, “You just need to persevere. Leave the rest to me.” ”

“Okay.”Chen Siyao nodded.

“After leaving Chen Siyao’s courtyard, Old Master Chen instructed the butler, “Think of a way to spread this news to our ears. Say that Yaoyao won’t marry anyone else but him. If he doesn’t, Yaoyao will starve to death!” ”

“The butler frowned. “Old Master, isn’t this... isn’t this a little inappropriate?” ”

The Chen family was not a small family. Using this kind of greeting was a little embarrassing.

The Butler even suspected that old master Chen had lost his mind!

“Otherwise, why would he say such words! ”

“Old Master Chen couldn’t care less. He sighed and said, “With such a granddaughter, what can I Do? I Can’t just watch the Chen family die!” ”

“If grandfather Chen had a granddaughter or grandson, he wouldn’t have ended up like this! ”

“However, the situation was different now. ”

“The housekeeper continued, “What if third master song doesn’t respond?” ”

“Can he just stand by and watch Yaoyao Die?”Grandfather Chen asked.

“The housekeeper said, “Grandfather, it’s not like you don’t know about third master song’s past. If he didn’t have any tricks up his sleeve, he wouldn’t have become the head of the song family.” ”

“Outsiders only knew that song Shiyu had killed his father, but they didn’t know that song Shiyu had a half-brother. Ever since Father Song went missing, that brother had also disappeared. ”

“Hearing this, Old Master Chen was stunned. ”

“The butler continued, “I still think that using death to threaten him is the worst option.” ”

“As long as there was a slight mistake, there was no way to end this. ”

“Old Master Chen frowned. “But now, there’s no other way!” ”

“”Old Master! Old Master!”At that moment, the assistant rushed over with a pale face. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Old Master Chen asked.

“The assistant gulped and said, “Something... something big happened!” ”

“Old Master Chen looked at him and said, “What happened? Tell me slowly. Don’t Worry!” ”

“The assistant said, “Sir, sir was arrested!” ”

“The Sir the assistant mentioned was Chen Siyao’s biological father, Chen Youlong. ”

“What?”Old Master Chen’s face turned pale. “What happened this time?”

“From what he said, it was obvious that this was not the first time Chen Youlong had gone in. ”

“The assistant continued, “I heard that he offended the Zhao family.” ”

The Zhao Family?

Old Master Chen frowned. “When did he get involved with the Zhao family again?”
