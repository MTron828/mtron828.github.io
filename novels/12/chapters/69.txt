Chapter 70: Beautiful and Handsome!

Everyone would be able to witness whether she had cheated through the chess match.

Ye Zhuo had never been someone to beat around the bush and be afraid of others. Since Mu Yourong wanted to whip up trouble, then she would play along with Mu Yourong!

After Ye Zhuo finished recording the video, she did not edit it and directly sent it out.

Lin Shasha looked at her from the side, her eyes almost sparkling.

The way Ye Zhuo recorded the video just now was really handsome and beautiful!

It was simply too much!

If Ye Zhuo were a boy, she would definitely fall in love with Ye Zhuo!

Lin Shasha said, “Zhuo Zhuo! I can’t wait to see you give them a huge face slapping! Unfortunately, I can’t go to the venue to watch it personally!”

Wonderful Sound Broadcasting’s third anniversary party would be live broadcasted, and when that time came, it would definitely be a very exciting scene.

Ye Zhuo patted Lin Shasha’s shoulder as she said, “Don’t worry, Sister Shasha. I heard that the party will be live broadcasted the entire time. You will definitely be able to see it!”

As a platform, Wonderful Sound Broadcasting would definitely add fuel to the fire and create heat for this event. When that time came, the face-smacking scene would definitely be even more exciting!

“Really?” Lin Shasha’s eyes lit up.

Ye Zhuo nodded.

“That’s great!” Lin Shasha said, “By the way, Zhuo Zhuo, when is the anniversary party?”

“It should be in two months time. I’ll need to see the invitation letter for the specific date.”

“I’ll check it online.” Lin Shasha turned on her phone and suddenly said excitedly, “Damn, Zhuo Zhuo! The statement you just made has already received 100,000 likes!”

That was amazing!

It had been less than ten minutes since Ye Zhuo posted her video online.

Lin Shasha read the comments and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, your fans are so loving!”

‘Ahhh! Ye Zhuo is so handsome! I love Ye Zhuo!’

‘We’re all here, Ye Zhuo.’

‘We believe in you, Ye Zhuo.’

‘I knew that the streamer of my dreams is not a white lotus at all.’

‘Ye Zi, you’re so amazing! Please do your best, we’ll be rooting for you!’

‘Screenshots have been taken to keep a record of the video. I hope the streamer keeps her word and doesn’t act like a coward!’

‘I’m just here to watch the show and eat melons.’

‘Cheating dogs are so shameless!’

‘The streamer has made herself very clear. We’ll find out whether there’s any cheating going on in the anniversary party!’

‘Ugly freak! If you weren’t the second Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire, why didn’t you dare to show your face? Why did you say that you would attend the third anniversary party? Who knows if this is just a delaying tactic! When the time comes, we don’t want to hear some lame excuse from you, such as something urgent came up or there’s a plane delay.’

‘Let’s wait for the anniversary party!’

‘Whether it’s a mule or a horse, you’ll know when you take them out for a walk!’

‘Wow! This year’s Wonderful Sound Broadcasting anniversary party is going to be a very interesting one!’

‘I’m looking forward to it!’

Suddenly, Lin Shasha jumped up from the sofa, she said excitedly, “Zhuo Zhuo, I read in the comments that those attending the Wonderful Sound Broadcasting’s anniversary party are allowed to bring along a family member. Can you bring me? I haven’t been to Beijing before! Quick, check the invitation letter and see if it’s true!”

Ye Zhuo opened her phone and looked at the invitation letter in the Mailbox. “Yes, we’re allowed to bring a family member. Sister Shasha, we can go together.”

“That’s great!” Lin Shasha hugged Ye Zhuo excitedly.

As they hugged each other in the summer, even though the air conditioner was turned on, it was still a little hot. Lin Shasha could not help but complain, “It’s so hot today! It’s so stuffy! Even though the air conditioner is turned on, it isn’t as cooling as I want it to be! It would be great if there were clothes that could adjust to the desired temperature at will!”

Hearing that, Ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up.

In her previous life, she was also very afraid of the heat, so she specially invented a suit that could adjust to one’s desired temperature.

With the suit, one could stay warm in winter and cool in summer.

It was like a walking air-conditioning, it was very convenient.

The most important thing was that this suit was not limited to styles. As long as it was designed by a designer, it could be manufactured.

However, this body did not seem to be very afraid of the heat, so Ye Zhuo almost forgot about this invention of hers.

Perhaps, she could bring the work of her previous life into this world.

In her previous life, this style of clothing had become popular all over the world as soon as it was released.

Ye Zhuo made up her mind and reached out to hug Lin Shasha again. “Sister Shasha, thank you!”

Lin Sha was confused and speechless. ‘What’s she thanking me for?’

At this moment, Zhou Yuelian’s voice came from outside the door.

“Shasha, Xiao Zhang and the others have arrived.”

Hearing this, Lin Shasha immediately stood up. “Oh! They’re here! Let’s go, Zhuo Zhuo, let’s go out quickly! I’ll introduce your brother-in-law to you!”

Ye Zhuo nodded, put her phone back into her pocket, and went to the living room with Lin Shasha.

There were three people standing in the living room.

Lin Shasha dragged a young man to Ye Zhuo and introduced him, “Zhuo Zhuo, this is your brother-in-law, Zhang Qiang. Zhang Qiang, this is my good sister, Ye Zhuo.”

Lin Shasha was so infatuated with Zhang Qiang that she was in a hurry to get married when she had just turned 20. Ye Zhuo originally assumed that Zhang Qiang would be a very handsome guy. After all, Lin Shasha was quite beautiful, so her taste in men should definitely be not too bad.

However, Ye Zhuo did not expect Zhang Qiang would look so ordinary.

He was so ordinary that he could not be found in a sea of people. He was a little fat, his beer belly was slightly puffed out, and there were even some parts of him that looked older than his actual age.

From the looks of it, Zhang Qiang was at least 30 or 40 years old…

His parents were both businessmen, so they took good care of their appearance. Zhang Qiang and his dad did not look like father and son, but more like brothers…

Could this be the very definition of ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder’?

In fact, beauty was indeed in the eye of the beholder. Lin Shasha did not want anything, she only wanted Zhang Qiang to be honest, sincere and to treat her well.

Lin Shasha believed that honest people wouldn’t have any tricks up their sleeves, unlike a scumbag. Her greatest fear was that she would meet a scumbag who would go out and have an affair with another woman after they got married.

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows and greeted him with a smile, “Hello, brother-in-law.”

“Hi, Miss Ye.” Zhang Qiang thought that Lin Shasha was very beautiful, but he didn’t expect that Lin Shasha to have a sister who was even more beautiful!

Lin Shasha hit Zhang Qiang and scolded, “What Miss? You’re being too distant! Zhuo Zhuo is my good sister, you can just call her by her name.”

“Sister Shasha is right,” Ye Zhuo pipped in, “Brother-in-law, you can just call me Zhuo Zhuo.”

Zhou Yuelian was introducing Zhang Qiang’s parents to Ye Shu.

Zhang Qiang’s father didn’t like to talk much, so he nodded at Ye Shu as a greeting.

Mother Zhang was a person who knew how to make conversation. “Sister Ye Shu, I’ve long heard about you from my in-laws. I heard that you opened a restaurant, right?”

“Yes.” Ye Shu nodded.

“How’s business?” Mother Zhang asked.

Ye Shu smiled and said, “Business is pretty good.”

Mother Zhang said again, “Where’s the location of your restaurant? If our company has a gathering next time, I’ll go to your restaurant to support you.”

Ye Shu continued, “It’s at 612, Ba Cheng Road. You are welcome to come over anytime. I will give you a discount when the time comes.”

‘612, Ba Cheng Road?’

Mother Zhang frowned.

If she remembered correctly, the customer flow at 612, Ba Cheng Road was particularly poor. Many restaurants had closed down!

Ye Shu said that the business was not bad. was she bragging?

Yes!

It must be.

She must be afraid that she would laugh at her!

After all, it was a shabby restaurant that was about to close down. It was really scary to say it out loud.

However, Mother Zhang did not point it out, but there was a hint of mockery in her eyes. It seemed that birds of the same flocked together. From the beginning, she did not agree with the union between her son and Lin Shasha.

Their family was so well-off, what kind of daughter-in-law could they not find?

But Zhang Qiang was a stubborn man, and he had decided to marry Lin Shasha, out of the sea of women he could have his pick from!

So, Mother Zhang thought of a way to get the two to marry as soon as possible. She originally thought that Lin Shasha was only 20 years old this year, so her family would not want her to get married so early.

Who knew that the family actually agreed!

She could guess the reason.

They must have taken a fancy to their family’s money!

Their family ran a renovation company, and their business was very good, with an annual revenue of over a million!

Moreover, every time Lin Shasha visited their house, she would think of ways to make things difficult for her, but the girl would have no reaction at all.

How shameless!

This family would do anything for money.

If Zhang Qiang wasn’t her only son, she definitely wouldn’t compromise so easily. But who asked her to have such a precious eldest son? So, she had no choice but to bite the bullet and come to acknowledge her future in-laws!

When she saw Ye Zhuo walk to Ye Shu’s side, Mother Zhang’s eyes lit up and she asked with a smile, “Who is this little girl?”

Ye Shu answered, “This is my daughter, Ye Zhuo. Zhuo Zhuo, this is your Sister Shasha’s future mother-in-law, Aunt Zhang. Quickly greet her.”

“Hello, Aunt Zhang,” Ye Zhuo greeted politely.

Mother Zhang looked at Ye Zhuo and said, “How old is the little girl this year?”

“Eighteen.”

Mother Zhang continued, “Do you have a boyfriend?”

“Aunt Zhang, I’m still in school,” Ye Zhuo said.

Mother Zhang said in surprise, “You’re still in school! Auntie, don’t be angry if I say something unpleasant! For a girl to study and receive a higher education, there’s no use for it at all! She will still get married in the future! Look at me, I didn’t even graduate from primary school. Am I worse off than so many people out there? And your Sister Shasha, she is only two years older than you, yet she is getting married soon! And she is getting married into such a good family! In the future, you just have to enjoy life in our family!”

It was better to get married than to study well.

Mother Zhang was living a good life because she got married with a good and well-off husband. Therefore, she thought that girls didn’t need to have a high education!

Lin Shasha was lucky enough to marry into their family!

If it were not for their family, Lin Shasha would be a poor person for the rest of her life.

After saying that, Zhang’s mother continued, “Our company also hired an undergraduate designer! She is also a girl. Now, she only gets five thousand yuan a month.”

The important thing was not five thousand yuan a month. It was that this undergraduate was actually working for her, who had not even graduated from primary school.

Mother Zhang’s words were filled with pride.

So what if she had not graduated from primary school? She could still be a boss even if she had not graduated from primary school! Those who had graduated from university still had to call her the lady boss.

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “One who is filled with knowledge always behaves in elegance. Auntie, your words are too biased. Only when you stand on a high ground can you see far. Your own structure determines your current speech and behavior.”

Mother Zhang’s life structure was there. She did not have the opportunity to meet a truly successful person, so she felt that reading was useless. She truly fit the description of ‘the longer one’s hair, the shorter their knowledge.’ She thought that she was the most successful one, but little did she know that there were people who fared far better than her in this world.

“What do you mean? Why don’t I understand it?” She could understand every word, but when combined, she could not understand it. Mother Zhang looked at Ye Zhuo in confusion.

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “This is probably the difference between studying and not studying.”

Mother Zhang suddenly understood what she meant.

This little girl was mocking her for being uncultured. She was really sharp-tongued! To dare to treat an elder like this, she was really uncultured.

Mother Zhang believed herself to be a kind person. Hence, she refused to lower herself to Ye Zhuo’s level.

If it were anyone else, they would definitely argue with Ye Zhuo.

Mother Zhang looked at Ye Zhuo and rolled her eyes, “The bridge that Auntie has crossed is longer than the road that you have walked. Going to school is really useless for girls. How about this, Auntie will introduce you to a boyfriend? Auntie’s nephew is not bad. He owns a car, a house, and a large supermarket! You can just marry him and become the boss’s wife!”

Mother Zhang’s nephew did not have any shortcomings. He just liked to compete with the Joneses!

Seeing that Zhang Qiang had found a beautiful girlfriend, he wanted to find a girlfriend that was even more beautiful than Lin Shasha.

If he could not find a girl that was even more beautiful than Lin Shasha, he would not get married.

Zhang Qiang’s mother was about to become a mother-in-law herself. Seeing that her nephew was almost forty years old and still alone, she was really anxious for his future.

Although Ye Zhuo’s family background was not that good, she was still quite good-looking.

She was barely worthy of her nephew, and she seem to have quite a bad temper. However, her temper issues could be slowly resolved after they got married. If it really did not work out, Mother Zhang would personally handle it! When that time came, she would definitely be able to teach Ye Zhuo to become an obedient wife.

Ye Shu frowned slightly and directly interrupted Mother Zhang’s words. “Auntie, thank you for your good intentions, but our family’s Zhuo Zhuo is going to enter university next year. Right now, our main priority is for her to focus on her studies. We can’t be distracted at this time!”

Ye Shu’s temper had always been very good. She never lost her temper. However, this time, she really couldn’t listen to it anymore!

Ye Zhuo was her last line of defense. Others could joke about her, they could say that she was fine, but she would not stand for it if others were to say anything bad about Ye Zhuo!

Mother Zhang’s expression turned cold, and she said with a fake smile, “It’s my fault for not thinking things through. Zhuo Zhuo is so beautiful, her academic results must be pretty good too! Next year, she will definitely be able to get into a university!”

A university?

For someone like Ye Zhuo, it would be impressive enough if she could get into a junior college! Did Ye Shu really think that her daughter was some kind of treasure? Did she not like her nephew?

She thought highly of Ye Zhuo, so she took the initiative to introduce Ye Zhuo to her nephew. Otherwise, how could Ye Zhuo be worthy of her nephew? This woman was simply overestimating herself!

She wanted to pull Ye Zhuo out of the slums, but she did not expect Ye Shu to be so unappreciative!

She deserved to marry a poor man and be poor for the rest of her life!

Ye Zhuo also frowned. Mother Zhang was so rude. Would Lin Shasha really be happy if she married Zhang Qiang?

She saw that the Zhang family didn’t think too highly of Lin Shasha.

It was the first time they had come to discuss marriage. Logically speaking, as the man, he should have brought some gifts to show their sincerity.

There was no need to mention about chicken, duck, fish, and meat. The Zhang family did not even bring any fruits.

Moreover, when Mother Zhang was talking to her just now, she did not seem to like Lin Shasha very much. Instead, there was a sense of superiority in her words.

As a good friend and a good sister, Ye Zhuo felt that it was time for her to talk to Lin Shasha.

When one was in love, they were usually oblivious to the obvious.

Ye Zhuo did not want to see her first good friend in this strange world fall into such a dangerous situation.

It was better to break up now than to divorce after they got married.

Lin Shasha was helping Zhou Yuelian wash the vegetables in the kitchen. When she heard Ye Zhuo call her, she said, “Zhuo Zhuo, wait a minute, let me finish these.”

Ye Zhuo smiled and walked over to help Lin Shasha wash the vegetables. “Why didn’t you ask brother-in-law to help you?”

Lin Sha scratched her hair and said, “He seems to be busy playing games.”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

Playing games?

This was the first time he came to visit his parents-in-law. Not only did Zhang Qiang not perform well in front of his future parents-in-law, but he was also busy playing games.

They were not even married yet!

If they got married, wouldn’t he be even more outrageous in the future?

Although it was a trivial matter, it was precisely because of these trivial matters that it reflected a person’s character and quality.

The details revealed the truth.

Ye Zhuo teased, “Sister Shasha, you are really a good wife and mother. Brother-in-law is playing games while you are washing vegetables in the kitchen. It seems that in the future, brother-in-law will have the final say in everything when the both of you form a family!”

“You are the only one who knows how to tease me.” Lin Shasha smiled at Ye Zhuo and said, “Your brother-in-law’s upbringing is stricter. The men in his family don’t cook. They believe that a gentleman should stay away from the kitchen.”

“It’s surely an older generation thinking that a gentleman should stay away from the kitchen! What era is it now? Oh right,” Ye Zhuo continued, “Sister Shasha, who usually cooks when you go to your brother-in-law’s house?”

“Me,” Lin Shasha answered.

“You?” Ye Zhuo was a little surprised, “You’re a guest. Why are you cooking for their family?”

Cooking a meal wasn’t the problem. The problem was, the whole scenario didn’t seem right. Lin Sha was a guest and Zhang Qiang’s girlfriend. It was reasonable that their family should not let Lin Shasha cook their meals for them.

“Yeah.” Lin Shasha obviously did not take it to heart. “Uncle and aunty all like my cooking.”

Seeing that Lin Shasha was smiling so happily, Ye Zhuo couldn’t help but frown.

She didn’t understand what it meant that a woman’s IQ became 0 when in love, but now she finally understood.

Lin Shasha was usually a smart person, but now she was so blinded by love.

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “They asked you to do the laundry and cook their meals even before you get married into their family. When you get married to Zhang Qiang one day, wouldn’t all the housework be done by you?”

Lin Shasha looked at Ye Zhuo and asked, “Zhuo Zhuo, how did you know that I did the laundry for uncle and aunt?”

Her words left Ye Zhuo speechless.

“You… You really did the laundry for them?” She had just said it casually. She didn’t expect that Lin Shasha had actually done it.

“Yes.” Lin Sha nodded. “Aunt said that the washing machine is not capable of properly cleaning the laundry, so every time I go there, I wash the clothes for them by hand.”

Washing clothes was one thing.

They even wanted her to hand-wash their dirty laundry.

Ye Zhuo was really shocked!

Her face was full of shock and question marks.

“Sister Shasha, after you marry him, are you going to wash their clothes and cook for them every day?”

Lin Shasha was stunned. It was obvious that she had not considered this question.

Ye Zhuo continued, “Sister Shasha, there is a saying that goes, ‘habits become nature. When you go there, you do this and that for them. They are already used to your efforts. Once you get married, all the housework will be yours!”

“It’s just washing clothes. I don’t think it’s anything wrong…” Lin Shasha didn’t think anything was wrong.

Ye Zhuo continued, “In other words, have you helped your dad and mom wash clothes at home?”

Lin Shasha shook her head, “No.”

“So, Sister Shasha, uncle and aunt are reluctant to let you wash their clothes, but you actually do it for others. Don’t you think it’s a bit wrong…”

Lin Shasha was a treasure in her parents’ eyes, but in the eyes of Zhang Qiang’s parents, she was just a blade of grass.

If Zhang Qiang’s parents had a little respect for Lin Sha, they wouldn’t let her wash their clothes.

As she listened to Ye Zhuo words, Lin Shasha suddenly felt that something was wrong.

Ye Zhuo decided to persuade Lin Shasha slowly and gradually, “Have you discussed with brother-in-law where you will live after you get married?”

“Zhang Qiang said that his parents are old, so it’s convenient to stay with them so that we can take care of the elderly…”

“So you will live together with his parents after you get married?” Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly.

“Yes.”

“So, their family didn’t get a new daughter-in-law, but hired a free nanny.” Seeing that Lin Shasha’s face had become pale, Ye Zhuo continued, “Sister Shasha, good medicine is bitter to the mouth, and good advice is harsh to the ear. Think about it carefully.”

How old were the parents of the Zhang Family? They were not even fifty years old! They were not even fifty years old, yet they needed someone to take care of them?

Ye Zhuo continued, “Today is the first time they came to visit. What did they bring? You should be well aware of the common etiquette in Yunjing. This is the first time the man has come to visit. What should he bring along? To put it nicely, they don’t care about trifles. To put it bluntly, Sister Shasha, they don’t take you seriously at all.”

Ye Zhuo’s words seemed to wake Lin Shasha up from her dream. Her face turned paler and paler.

At this moment, a sigh sounded in the air.

Ye Zhuo looked up and saw that it was Zhou Yuelian.

Zhou Yuelian continued, “Shasha, I also think that Zhuo Zhuo is right. It seems that Xiao Zhang’s parents really don’t think much of you… How could someone come empty-handed for the first time the visit their future in-laws?”

Hearing this, Ye Zhuo breathed a sigh of relief.

Finally, there was someone in the Lin family who spoke up about it!

“Mom?” Lin Shasha looked at Zhou Yuelian in surprise.

Zhou Yuelian looked at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuo Zhuo, what do you think we should do about this?”

Ye Zhuo was only eighteen years old. However, in Zhou Yuelian’s eyes, Ye Zhuo was more thoughtful than her elder. She could see the essence of the situation through appearances.

“Aunt Lian, we can’t force love, and we can’t break up the couple. It’s mainly up to Sister Shasha.” After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Lin Shasha. “Sister Shasha, do you want to see if brother-in-law values you or not?”

“Yes.” Lin Shasha nodded.

“Then do as I say.” Ye Zhuo whispered a few words.

Hearing that, Lin Shasha smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Zhuo Zhuo! It’s only 80,000 yuan. Uncle and aunt will definitely agree!”

“Sister Shasha, are you that confident?” Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows and asked.

Lin Shasha patted her chest and said, “Of course! Just wait and see!”

Zhou Yuelian also said, “80,000 yuan is nothing to the Zhang family. Zhuo Zhuo, if you really want to use the betrothal gifts to test the attitude of the Zhang family, it would be better to say 180,000 yuan. Anyway, I don’t want their money. I will let Sasha take it back after they get married.”

The annual income of the Zhang family was one million yuan. 80,000 yuan was a small amount to them.

“Let alone 80,000 yuan, I think the Zhang family doesn’t even want to pay 8000 yuan,” Ye Zhuo said faintly.

She could tell that the Zhang family wanted to take advantage of the situation and pay nothing at all.

The reason Ye Zhuo did not suggest 180,000 yuan was because she wanted Lin Shasha to open her eyes and see her situation more clearly and thoroughly.

“No way!” Lin Sha said firmly, “Zhang Qiang is not that kind of person, and uncle and aunt are not that kind of people.”

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Whether it is or not, Sister Shasha, just wait and see. But Sister Shasha, I advise you to be mentally prepared.”

Zhou Yuelian also felt that 80,000 yuan was not enough to test the sincerity of the Zhang family, because 80,000 yuan was nothing to the Zhang family.

During dinner, Zhou Yuelian talked about the betrothal gift.

Mother Zhang was stunned when she heard that. “There wasn’t any mention about the betrothal gift before!”

80,000 yuan!

Lin Shasha came knocking on the door, and she actually wanted a betrothal gift?

No way! She had never seen such a shameless person.

Seeing Zhang’s mother’s attitude, Zhou Yuelian’s heart turned cold.

She did not expect the Zhang family to be unwilling to even pay 80,000 yuan!

It seemed that Ye Zhuo was right. The Zhang family wanted to find a free nanny to serve them.

Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “Look at what you’re saying. We didn’t say we wanted a dowry before, but we didn’t say we didn’t want a dowry either! Go outside and ask around. Which family doesn’t ask for a betrothal gift when they marry their daughter? Take for example the girl who lives from across us who is three years older than Sasha. Not only did her in-laws gift a car and a house, but they also gave a betrothal gift of 280,000 yuan!”

Zhou Yuelian’s words were indeed reasonable.

Throughout the ages, there had never been anyone who did not ask for a single cent of a betrothal gift when they married their daughter.

Mother Zhang smiled and said, “80,000 yuan is not a small amount. I have to go home to discuss it.”

Zhou Yuelian nodded. “Then when you have discussed it, we will discuss the marriage of these two children.”

Mother Zhang’s smile did not disappear as she said. “Then we will do as you say, Shasha’s mother.”

Mother Zhang did not even address her as her in-law anymore.

What disappointed Lin Shasha was that throughout the entire process, Zhang Qiang did not say a word.

Zhang Qiang did not seem to care about her at all, just as Ye Zhuo had said.

After dinner, Lin Sha went to look for Zhang Qiang. “Is your family going to pay the 80,000 yuan betrothal gift or not?”

Zhang Qiang said awkwardly, “I have to ask my mother about that.” Zhang Qiang’s mother was in charge of the Zhang family. She was already very unhappy when Zhang Qiang insisted on marrying Lin Shasha.

Lin Shasha looked at Zhang Qiang. “What if your mother doesn’t agree to it?”

Zhang Qiang remembered what his mother had said to him just now. “Shasha, are you going to marry me for me, or are you marrying me for my money?”

It seemed that his mother was right. Lin Shasha had chosen to marry him because of money! Otherwise, how could someone like Lin Shasha fall in love with him when he looked like this!

“What’s 80,000 yuan enough for? Do you think that 80,000 yuan is even enough to host a wedding? Zhang Qiang, do you think I care about 80,000 yuan?” She wanted Zhang Qiang to understand where she was coming from and fight for her!

Then, she continued, “Do you even want me to pay for your family’s part of the expenses?”

Seeing that Lin Sha was really angry, Zhang Qiang quickly explained, “No! That’s not what I meant! Shasha, don’t think too much. I’ll definitely persuade my mother to pay 80,000 yuan.”

“What if your mother refuses to?” Lin Shasha asked again.

Zhang Qiang said, “I will sit her down and talk to her properly!”

“Zhang Qiang, if I remember correctly, your secret stash is more than 80,000 yuan, right?”

Zhang Qiang was stunned for a moment and then continued, “My mother knows about the money in my card. If I suddenly lose 80,000 yuan, she will definitely find out… Shasha, I love you! Don’t worry, I will definitely get my mother to pay this 80,000 yuan!”

Lin Shasha looked at Zhang Qiang. “Okay, I’ll wait for you.”

Before this, Lin Shasha trusted Zhang Qiang very much, and she also trusted his parents. But now, she was very nervous.

She was even afraid.

In the hearts of the Zhang family, she wasn’t even worth 80,000 yuan.

…

When she returned home, Mother Zhang threw a tantrum.

She said that Lin Shasha didn’t know what was good for her!

She was so angry that her face turned white.

Zhang Qiang tried to persuade her, “Isn’t it just 80,000 yuan? Our family doesn’t lack money. Just give it to her family.”

Mother Zhang glared at Zhang Qiang, “This is not about 80,000 yuan. If I take out this money today, that Lin Shasha will dare to climb over my head tomorrow!”

She had long seen through Lin Shasha’s intentions! Lin Shasha was trying to show off! The Lin family was lucky that the Zhang family didn’t ask them for any money for allowing their daughter to marry into the Zhang family!

After saying that, Mother Zhang pointed at Zhang Qiang and said, “Call Lin Shasha now and tell her that the Zhang family won’t pay a single cent of the 80,000 Yuan!”

Zhang Qiang looked at Mother Zhang with a troubled expression. He could tell from Lin Shasha’s words and actions today that if the Zhang family didn’t pay the 80,000 Yuan, Lin Shasha might really break up with him.

Lin Sha was so beautiful and was a few years younger than him. It would make him look very dignified if he brought her out to show her off to others. He did not want to break up with her.

Zhang Qiang knew his own conditions. His family conditions were better, but he did not have any advantage over Lin Shasha in other aspects.

Zhang Qiang’s mother saw Zhang Qiang’s hesitation, she continued, “Son, our family conditions are so good. It’s not like you can’t get a wife! Lin Shasha didn’t even look at herself in the mirror. She is so lucky to be able to marry into the Zhang Family! Don’t worry, son. Lin Shasha won’t let you go. You can just tell her about our decision!”

Zhang Qiang also felt that Mother Zhang was right. He was so well-off. Lin Shasha definitely wouldn’t break up with him. Could Lin Shasha even find someone better than him?

When Lin Sha received Zhang Qiang’s call, her face was full of disbelief. She didn’t expect that the Zhang family would be so stingy.

Lin Shasha felt nauseous and couldn’t help but vomit.

What should she do now?

Lin Shasha came out of the bathroom and looked at her pale self in the mirror.

Should she ask Ye Zhuo for help?

Yes!

Ye Zhuo must have a way to handle this situation!

Lin Shasha informed her parents and went to the Ye family home.

Ye Shu was about to go to the restaurant when Lin Shasha arrived at the Ye family residence.

“Shasha is here!” Ye Shu quickly poured a glass of water for Lin Shasha.

Lin Shasha nodded, “Aunty Shu, you go ahead. I’ll say a few words to Zhuo Zhuo and then I’ll leave. By the way, is Zhuo Zhuo athome?”

“She’s in her room! Go ahead look for her! I’ll make my leave first!”

“Take care, aunt.”

The door to Ye Zhuo’s bedroom was open.

She was wearing a black singlet, revealing her delicate collarbone. Under the contrast of the black singlet, her fair skin now looked even whiter and flawless.

Ye Zhuo sat on the carpet, lowering her head to study something. A wisp of her hair playfully slanted down and brushed past her picturesque features. Her expression was so focused that she did not even notice that Lin Shasha had entered.

There were a bunch of parts, machines, wrenches, and so on on the ground beside her.

On the furthest side, there was a piece of clothing.

Lin Shasha subconsciously felt that this piece of clothing was not quite the same as ordinary clothes.

“Zhuo Zhuo.” Lin Sha knocked on the door.

Ye Zhuo finally reacted. She raised her eyes to look toward the door and asked in surprise, “Sister Shasha, why are you here?”

“I came to look for you about something…” Lin Shasha was not as bright and active as she usually was.

Ye Zhuo noticed that her expression was not right. “Sister Shasha, are you not feeling well?”

Lin Shasha said, “I’m fine.” She was just angry with the Zhang family.

“Let me take a look at you.” Ye Zhuo reached out and put her hand on Lin Shasha’s wrist.

After about ten seconds, Ye Zhuo looked up at Lin Shasha. Her expression was a little complicated.

Lin Shasha was stunned. “Zhuo Zhuo, what’s wrong?”

Ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment and then said, “Sister Shasha, you… you might be pregnant.”

“What?” Lin Shasha was shocked.

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Sister Shasha, if you don’t trust me, you can go to the hospital for a check-up. From what I can tell, the fetus is more than a month old.”

The next second, Lin Shasha laughed out loud. “That’s great, Zhuo Zhuo! I’m pregnant!”

Ye Zhuo was speechless. She thought that Lin Shasha would be very sad and surprised, but she didn’t expect that Lin Shasha would be so happy.

Lin Shasha continued, “I’m pregnant now. Zhang Qiang and his parents will be very happy when they find out! At that time, they would definitely pay 180,000 yuan, let alone 80,000 yuan.”

Moreover, Lin Shasha felt that Zhang Qiang’s parents were not that bad.

This child came just in time!

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly. “That’s hard to say. Sister Shasha, don’t you feel that they don’t value you at all? And Zhang Qiang…”

Before Ye Zhuo could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by Lin Sha. “Zhuo Zhuo, I can guarantee that Zhang Qiang and his parents are not that kind of people!”

After learning that she was pregnant, Lin Shasha did not have any worries anymore. She wanted to go to the hospital for a check-up as soon as possible and then tell the good news to Zhang Qiang.

Ye Zhuo also knew that Lin Shasha would not give up until reality slapped her in the face, so she could only let her go.

At the same time.

Beijing.

Lin family residence.

Feng Qianhua spent a some time chatting with Madam Lin almost every afternoon. So whenever it was time, Madam Lin would stand at the door and wait for her.

Lin Jincheng was not in good health and was very busy every day.

Lin Ze had to go to school.

Old people feared loneliness the most. Chatting with Feng Qianhua every afternoon became what Madam Lin looked forward to the most.

Hearing the sound of a car engine coming from the door, Madam Lin’s eyes lit up. “Qianhua is here.”

“After so many years, Miss Qianhua is the most thoughtful one. She comes to accompany you every day,” Nanny Zhang said from the side.

Madam Lin smiled and said, “That’s right. Among all the sons and daughters-in-law, she is the most thoughtful one!” Madam Lin also liked her the most.

Nanny Zhang hesitated for a moment and then said, “Madam Lin, there is something that I want to say but I don’t know if I should say it.”

“Auntie Zhang, you’ve worked for the Lin family for so many years. What else are you afraid of saying? Speak.” Nanny Zhang had only been 20 when she first came to work for the Lin family. Now, her grandson was already three years old!

After so many years, she was no longer as simple as a servant to Madam Lin.

Auntie Zhang continued, “I just feel that Miss Qianhua has been waiting for Jincheng for so many years. Shouldn’t Jincheng give her a status? She has given Jincheng her best eighteen years. How many eighteen years can a woman have? Old Madam, do you think this is right?”

At this point, Nanny Zhang paused, then she said, “Madam, I don’t mean anything else. It’s just that Miss Qianhua hasn’t had it easy, and I don’t want you to miss out on such a good daughter-in-law. If I say anything inappropriate, please don’t mind me.”

After saying that, Nanny Zhang sighed, “Logically speaking, I’m a servant of the Lin family, so it’s not my place to say these words. But I just feel that Miss Qianhua has been wronged all these years. Even an outsider like me feels that she’s wronged, let alone herself…”

Madam Lin also sighed. “Aunt Zhang, how could I not want Qianhua to become our Lin family’s legitimate daughter-in-law as soon as possible? But you also know the character of that Jincheng…”

Nanny Zhang looked in the direction of the manor’s entrance, her eyes flashing, “Madam, Jincheng has always cared about Ah Ze the most. As long as Ah Ze asks Miss Qianhua to marry his father, Jincheng will definitely agree. Moreover, after so many years, Miss Qianhua has long treated Ah Ze as her own son.”

Hearing this, Madam Lin’s eyes lit up. “That seems reasonable.”

She had to start with Lin Ze.

Once Lin Ze had his eyes set on Feng Qianhua as his mother, Lin Jincheng would have to marry her even if he didn’t want to.

Just then, Feng Qianhua walked in with a thermos box. “Aunt Lin, what are you talking about with Nanny Zhang? You seem to be having such a good time!”

Madam Lin smiled and said, “Of course we’re talking about happy things.”

“This is the health-preserving soup I made for you. Let’s go in and drink it while it’s hot.”

Madam Lin had a serious cough, and many doctors were not able to treat her condition. After Feng Qianhua learned about this, she was very anxious and asked a miracle doctor for a prescription for health-preserving soup.

Strangely enough, after drinking Feng Qianhua’s soup, Madam Lin felt much better.

So, all these years, Madam Lin had been relying on Feng Qianhua’s health-preserving soup to heal her body. Feng Qianhua had been doing the same every day for ten years, personally making soup for Madam Lin.

If not for Feng Qianhua’s health-preserving soup, Madam Lin would have kicked the bucket a long time ago. Therefore, Madam Lin felt that Feng Qianhua was her lucky star, or rather, their Lin family’s lucky star. This was also an important reason why Madam Lin liked Feng Qianhua so much.

Madam Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Qianhua, out of so many people, none of them can compare to you!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Don’t make me shy! Shouldn’t I be filial to you? Besides, eldest brother, second brother, third brother, fifth brother, and sister-in-law are also very filial to you!”

“Them?” A hint of dissatisfaction flashed across Madam Lin’s eyes. “They are only filial verbally.”

She had a total of five sons.

Apart from Lin Jincheng who lived with her, she did not see much of her other four sons, not to mention her daughters-in-law. It was as if they did not exist.

Feng Qianhua stayed at the Lin family residence until evening before returning.

Aunt Zhang sent her out.

As they were walking out of the manor, Feng Qianhua suddenly stopped in her tracks. “Nanny Zhang, here’s fine. You should go back quickly.”

Nanny Zhang looked around and then said in a low voice, “I’ve already mentioned that matter to the old madam today. Madam likes you very much. Don’t worry. The position of the matriarch of the Lin family will be yours sooner or later.”

“Thank you for your kind words.” Feng Qianhua took out a box from her bag and handed it to Nanny Zhang. “I heard that your little grandson’s birthday is today. Take this as a small token of my appreciation.”

Nanny Zhang did not take it. “It’s not easy for you to raise Xianxian all by yourself.”

The Feng family was a place where the weak would be eaten whole. Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian looked like they lived glamorous lives on the surface. However, only this pair of mother and daughter knew about the troubles and heartaches they had to face.

“Take it.” Feng Qianhua stuffed the box into Nanny Zhang’s hands. “It’s nothing valuable.”
