Translator: 549690339

Feng Qianhua never dreamed that Lin Jincheng would suddenly think of looking for ye Shu.

Did he not care at all about ye Shu’s previous infidelity? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Jincheng could even forgive ye Shu’s infidelity.

Then what was nineteen years of waiting for her?

Was her sincerity not worthy of being taken seriously by him once?

Feng Qianhua felt as if she could hardly breathe.

It was very uncomfortable.

“Before this, Old Lady Lin had always refused to accept ye Shu because the child was not part of the Lin family. Now that the truth was out, would old lady Lin still refuse to accept ye Shu as before?”

Would she still have a reason not to accept ye Shu?

What should she do now?

“Feng Qianhua clenched her fists so tightly that she was on the verge of collapse, but she still tried her best to calm herself down.”

She could not panic.

She could not panic now!

The position of the matriarch of the Lin family could only be hers.

No one could snatch it away!

Old Lady Lin raised her head to look at Lin Jincheng. Her eyes were filled with scrutiny as she angrily threw the appraisal report to the ground. “Do you really think I’m Old and muddle-headed? You still want to use a fake report to deceive me!”

Old Lady Lin did not believe that ye Shu had not cheated on her!

“After all, she had seen Mu Yourong with her own eyes before.”

She was the one who had personally taken the appraisal report!

“Moreover, Ye Shu was so beautiful.”

“It was said that a beautiful woman would bring disaster to others. Ye Shu was so beautiful, so how could she be a good woman who kept to herself?”

This was clearly Lin Jincheng colluding with that woman to lie to her together!

Did she really think that she was a fool?

How could she be deceived by them?

“Seeing Old Lady Lin like this, Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes and hurriedly picked up the report, she said gently, “Aunt Lin, please calm down. I’ve Long said that Sister Ye Shu isn’t that kind of casual person! Brother Jincheng wouldn’t use such a thing to deceive you. Perhaps, he really carried the wrong child! When you went to Yun Jing previously, the children of the two families hadn’t been switched back yet, so the paternity test report doesn’t support that the child and brother Jincheng are father and daughter.””

“Old Mrs. Lin looked at Feng Qianhua, her eyes filled with heartache.”

“This silly child. At this time, she was actually still speaking up for ye Shu.”

Couldn’t she think for herself?

“Lin Jincheng asked his assistant to take out a photo and handed it to Old Mrs. Lin. “If you don’t believe the report, you can take a look at this.””

Old Mrs. Lin took the photo.

“The girl in the photo was wearing a military uniform. She looked back at the crowd and smiled. She was like a green flower in the army. Her cold beauty carried a valiant and heroic bearing. Her phoenix-like eyes were bright and beautiful. Her skin was as white as jade. Her lips were red and her teeth were white, the crowd behind her became her background.”

“Although Old Mrs. Lin didn’t want to admit it, the girl in the photo indeed looked like Lin Jincheng.”

She also looked a little like Lin Ze.

Could it be that this girl really had the Lin family’s bloodline?

“After a long while, old madam Lin finally found her voice. She raised her head and looked at Lin Jincheng. “She, she, she is really the Lin family’s flesh and blood?”No matter how ruthless old Madam Lin was.., she could not ignore the Lin family’s flesh and blood.”

“”Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded firmly and continued, “Mother, I plan to bring the mother and daughter back.””

“”Them?”Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Jincheng, her eyes full of anger. “What do you mean?””

“”I mean it literally,”Lin Jincheng replied.”

“Old Lady Lin instantly became angry again. “What about Qianhua? Don’t forget, Qianhua is now your fiancée!””

“”The engagement party has been canceled. I have nothing to do with her!”Lin Jincheng looked at Old Lady Lin. His voice sounded calm, but it was actually turbulent, “Whether you agree or not, I will bring the mother and daughter back!””

“Old Lady Lin said, “The Lin family’s flesh and blood naturally can not be left outside. I did not say that I would not bring the child back! But Ye Shu can forget about stepping into our Lin Family!””

“Old Lady Lin now hated ye Shu. If it were not for ye Shu, the mother and son relationship between him and Lin Jincheng would not have become like this.”

A woman like ye Shu still wanted to marry into the Lin Family?

Dream On!

“”I’m informing you now, not discussing it with you.”After saying this, Lin Jincheng turned and left.”

Lin Ze glanced at old madam Lin and turned to leave with Lin Jincheng.

“Feng Qianhua looked at Lin Jincheng’s back as if she wanted to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say anything.”

It was better to speak less than to talk more.

Especially at such a tense time.

“Jincheng! Stop Right There!”
