Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao really fit his dream daughter.

“Then I’ll thank uncle.”

“You and I don’t have to be so polite!”

Wu Youyu accompanied Zhang Qingqing as they walked around the campus.

“Zhang Qingqing said, “Let’s go and have a cup of coffee.” ”

“This coffee shop was famous for being expensive. Zhang Qingqing couldn’t bear to drink it, but Wu Youyu was here today. ”

“Wu Youyu was not lacking in money. Of course, he had to let Wu Youyu pay for it. ”

“Okay.”Wu Youyu nodded.

“Wu Youyu was very generous when it came to treating his little sweetheart, Zhang Qingqing. ”

The two of them walked into the coffee shop.

“The moment they entered, Wu Youyu saw a familiar figure. ”

That Was...

Zhou Jinbei.

Why was Zhou Jinbei in Beijing too!

“Wu Youyu narrowed his eyes. “Qingqing, let’s sit here.”Wu Youyu picked a seat next to Zhou Jinbei. ”

“He knew Zhou Jinbei, but Zhou Jinbei did not know him. ”

“Sitting here, he could clearly hear the conversation between the two. ”

“Zhou Jinbei continued, “Zha Zha, do you like Jadeite and agate? Your aunt has a lot of jadeite and agate. Go pick some some some other day.” ”

Ye Zha took a sip of cappuccino. “I haven’t even thought about where to decorate the pink diamond that you gave me. There’s no need for jadeite and agate. I appreciate it.”

“Zhou jinbei smiled and said, “Your aunt wants to have a daughter even in her dreams. If she sees you, she will definitely be very happy.”Zhou Jinbei’s wife was also a very virtuous person. ”

“Because of Xie Wanqiu’s example, when he first found his wife, Zhou Jinbei had put in some effort. ”

Reality proved that his judgment was not wrong.

“Wu Youyu pricked up his ears and listened, frowning slightly. ”

The girl opposite Zhou Jinbei called him Uncle Zhou Jinbei.

But she did not think that he was one of Zhou Xiang’s four daughters.

Then who was she?

Could it be that Zhou Xiang had other daughters?

“Just as Wu Youyu was puzzled, Zhang Qing Qing stretched out her hand and waved it in front of Wu Youyu. “What are you thinking about? I can’t even hear you when I’m talking to you!” ”

Only then did Wu Youyu react. “What did you say?”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “I asked you what you wanted to drink.” ”

“Wu youyu said, “Just the same as you.” ”

Zhang Qingqing handed the menu to the waiter. “Just the ones I just ordered. Two cups of coffee.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

“After the waiter left, Zhang Qingqing looked up at Wu Youyu. “Why? Do You Like That Beauty?” ”

“What nonsense are you spouting!”

“”She’s not someone you can dream of!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Did you see the hair clip on her head? It’s lanting’s, and it’s worth this much!”At the end, Zhang Qingqing stretched out five fingers. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Wu Youyu did not really study girls’things. “Five hundred?”

“”Five hundred?”Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “Five hundred can’t even buy a fake!” ”

“5000 Yuan?”Wu Youyu asked.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “50,000 yuan!” ”

“50,000 yuan! ”

Wu Youyu widened his eyes.

Wasn’t it just a hair clip?

Was there a need for it to be so expensive?

“After all, the most expensive bag he had ever bought for Zhang Qingqing was only 100,000 yuan. ”

“If he didn’t really like Zhang Qingqing, he wouldn’t have been so ruthless. ”

But now.

“A small hair clip actually cost 50,000 yuan. ”

This was too exaggerated!

Who Was this girl?

She actually wore such an expensive hair clip.

“At this moment, Wu Youyu seemed to suddenly remember something. ”

Ye Zhuo!

She was definitely ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. According to seniority, she should indeed be called Uncle Zhou Jinbei. ”

This Zhou Jinbei was really something.

At least Zheng Wanyin wanted to call him uncle.

But how did he treat Zheng Wanyin?

He was indifferent to Zheng Wanyin.

“But now, he was so nice to Ye Zhuo. ”

What was this?

“”What’s wrong with you now?”Zhang Qingqing was a little impatient. “I said, don’t tell me you really like her?” ”

“What nonsense are you talking about!”Wu Youyu retracted his gaze. “I just think she looks a little familiar.”

“I’m just making it up.”

“”I’m serious.”Wu Youyu suddenly lowered his voice and continued, “Do you see that man?” ”

“Yes.”Zhang Qing Qing nodded.

“Wu youyu continued, “She’s Xie Wanqiu’s stepson.” ”

“Hearing that, Zhang Qing Qing’s face was filled with surprise. “If you round him up, isn’t he also your son?” ”

Wu Youyu and Xie wanqiu were good friends. Xie Wanqiu was Zhou Jinbei’s stepmother.

“When Zhou Zuolong left and Wu Youyu entered the house, wouldn’t Zhou Jinbei become Wu Youyu’s son? ”

“Wu youyu smiled and said, “Yes.” ”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “When the time comes, you can’t forget me.” ”

“Don’t worry. I Won’t forget you even if I forget someone.”Wu Youyu moved closer to Zhang Qingqing and kissed her fiercely on the face.

“Although Zhang Qingqing felt a little disgusted, she could only endure it and continued, “Who’s that beautiful lady? I heard her call your son uncle. Could she be Zhou Xiang’s Daughter?” ”

Wu Youyu shook his head. “She’s Xie Wanqiu’s grandson’s girlfriend.”

Zhang Qingqing nodded. “I see.”

“Wu Youyu felt that he should tell Xie wanqiu about all this and continued, “Qingqing, I’m going to the washroom.” ”

“Go ahead.”

In the hospital.

“When Xie Wanqiu received Wu Youyu’s call, she was so angry that her lungs were about to explode. ”

She did not expect Zhou Jinbei to actually come to the capital city.

This unfilial ingrate did not even know to come to the hospital to visit her when she came to the capital city. She was Zhou Jinbei’s mother.

Zheng Wanyin was Zhou Jinbei’s biological niece.

“But what about Zhou Jinbei? He would rather give the pink diamond to that outsider, Ye Zhuo, than give one to Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Not to mention the pink diamond, Zhou Jinbei had not even given a needle to Zheng Wanyin during the festive season. ”

This was too much!

This was simply too much!

“When she came out of the bathroom, Xie Wanqiu waved at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, come over here for a moment.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin walked over. “Grandma, What’s Wrong?” ”

Xie wanqiu whispered something into Zheng Wanyin’s ear.

“When she heard that, Zheng Wanyin’s expression changed. ”

She had always treated Zhou Jinbei as her biological uncle.

“However, Zhou Jinbei did not seem to treat her as his biological niece. ”

The human heart was really something that could not withstand scrutiny.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “You’ll know what to tell your grandfather later, right?” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Coincidentally, the sound of the door opening came from outside. Zheng Wanyin immediately smiled. “Grandpa, you’re back!” ”

“”Yes.”Zhou Zuolong walked in with a box. “I ordered Lotus Leaf Rice, your and your grandmother’s favorite.” ”

“”Grandpa, you’ve worked hard.”Zheng Wanyin took the bag from Zhou Zuolong and continued, “Grandpa, you’re back so late. Did you run into Uncle Outside?” ”

“Zhou Zuolong was stunned at first, then he said, “You said he went to the north? He came to the capital too?” ”

“”Yes.”Zheng wanyin nodded and continued, “I saw my uncle on the Long Street just now. I was about to greet him when my uncle left.”. ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Zuolong frowned and his expression changed in anger. “This unfilial son! He came to the capital and didn’t come to see me to see his mother!” ”
