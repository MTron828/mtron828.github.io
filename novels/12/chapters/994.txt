“Chapter 995: 225: The Legend of Ranito, Ye Zhuo is actually Dr. YC! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Professor Yue and Tang Xue were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.

Master Aiwen actually came to greet ye Zhuo!

Neither of them thought that ye Zhuo and professor Yue really knew each other.

How did ye Zhuo Know Master Aiwen?

“Before the two of them could react, master aiwen continued, “Miss Ye, this is your first time in C Nation, you must let me do my best as a host!” ”

It was also at this time that Professor Yue realized that Master Aiwen and ye Zhuo were actually speaking Mandarin.

“She remembered that the last time she worked with Master Aiwen, Master Aiwen was still speaking Hindi. ”

“In order to work with Master Aiwen, she had learned Hindi for more than a year. ”

She did not expect that master aiwen would speak Mandarin so fluently in just three years.

“Moreover, if she did not hear wrongly, master Ai Wen had always used honorifics to ye Zhuo. ”

He kept calling her ‘you’.

Who Was Master Ai Wen?

A big shot in C Nation’s science and Technology Industry!

“But now, master Ai Wen was so respectful to ye Zhuo. ”

“If she had not seen it with her own eyes, professor Yue would never believe that it was true! ”

She even pinched her thigh hard because of this.

It hurt.

This wasn’t a dream.

“Faced with Master Aiwen’s invitation, Ye Zao tactfully declined. “Thank you, I appreciate it. But I may not have time today. We have other plans later.” ”

“”That’s such a pity!”Master aiwen continued, “Then when are you free? Why don’t we chat on Instagram?” ”

Instagram was a multinational software.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sure.” ”

“”Okay!”Master Ai Wen nodded. Just as he was about to say something else, he was called away by his assistant. As he walked forward, he turned to look at ye Zao and said, “Miss Ye, remember to reply me on INS!” ”

“Last year, he had sent many messages to ye Zao on INS, wanting to discuss academic knowledge with her. However, Ye Zao was too busy and had almost no time to log in to INS. Naturally, he did not reply to any of the messages he sent. ”

It was not easy to see ye Zhuo in person this time. Master Aiwen did not want to miss such a good opportunity.

Ye Zhuo was too amazing.

To use a Chinese phrase to describe it:

Listening to a word from a gentleman is better than studying for ten years.

“In order to be able to communicate normally with ye Zhuo, Master Aiwen even went to learn Mandarin. ”

“In the past, it was always others who accommodated him. ”

“Master Aiwen did not expect that one day, in order to accommodate a person, he would learn a certain language. ”

“Moreover, this person was a very young girl. ”

“After Master Aiwen left, professor Yue looked at ye Zhuo with a complicated expression. “Miss Ye, how do you know Master Aiwen? Is it because of master five?” ”

Professor Yue thought for a long time and it seemed that this was the only explanation.

Master Aiwen was a well-known figure in the world of science and technology. Ye Zhuo had not even stepped into the world of science and technology.

How could these two people know each other?

Just thinking about it did not seem possible.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

She and master aiwen had met at the technology competition last year. Cen Shaoqing and master aiwen were very good friends. There was nothing wrong with saying that it was because CEN Shaoqing knew Master Aiwen.

“Upon hearing this, professor Yue’s eyes flashed with such a look. ”

She really thought that ye Zao had some ability.

So it was really because of Cen Shaoqing.

Tang Xue also heaved a sigh of relief.

Now it seemed that Master Aiwen was not respectful to ye Zao. The person he was truly respectful to was Cen Shaoqing.

“If it was not for CEN Shaoqing, Master Aiwen probably would not even know who ye Zao was. ”

“Thinking of this, Tang Xue felt a lot better. ”

“If she was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend today, then master aiwen would be equally respectful to her. ”

“When Cen Shaoqing was a non-marriage activist in the past, Tang Xue had never thought of this. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

But now it was different.

Cen Shaoqing was no longer the CEN Shaoqing of the past.

“As the saying goes, flowers never bloom for a hundred days. ”

Who knew if ye Zao could accompany Cen Shaoqing to the end!

“Before Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo got married, anyone would have a chance. ”

“Professor Yue continued, “Let’s go over there and take a look. Our products will be displayed there tomorrow.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at his phone. “Professor Yue, I still have to go out for a while. You and Miss Tang don’t have to wait for me. I’ll go back to the hotel myself.” ”

Professor Yue turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “C country has been quite chaotic recently. Why Don’t you have Xiaoxue go with you?”

Ye Zhuo’s eyes were indifferent. “There’s no need to trouble Miss Tang. I’ll go alone.”

No need?

Professor Yue furrowed his brows without a trace. Ye Zhuo really knew how to cause trouble for her.
