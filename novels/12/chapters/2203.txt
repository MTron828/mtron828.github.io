“A member of the JY team said, “We’ve worked with Miss Ye once and feel that it’s really rare to have a partner like Miss Ye. I feel that she’s very different from others and very loyal. She’s clearly a girl, but at times, she’s even more straightforward than a man.” ”

“”Miss Shi, how did you know burning father?”Leo asked. ”

“Shi Qingcheng did not hide anything and smiled. “I roamed around with her when I was young. She was about the same age as me, but she comforted me like a big sister.” ”

“Hearing this, everyone was stunned. No one had expected that Shi Qingcheng had roamed around. ”

“The life of a roamer was not easy. She often ate and ate, but no matter what ye Zhuo found, he would share it equally with her. ”

“Soon, the aircraft landed. ”

Ye Zao was already on the ground to welcome everyone. “Thank you for your hard work.”

“”Miss Ye, you’re being too polite! What hard work? If there’s anything in the future, just let us know directly. You’re welcome!” ”

“Because everyone still had matters to attend to, they did not stay in the alliance. ”

“Other Than Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng, the rest of the people had all returned in the aircraft. ”

“Shi Qingcheng looked at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, I heard from Ye Xiaohan that you’re going back to Earth?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”What about here?”Shi Qingcheng asked, “Is your boyfriend going with you too?” ”

“Yes.”

“Shi Qingcheng asked with some doubt, “Can he give up the position of the General Alliance?” ”

Most men had great power and influence. How many people could give up their power and influence?

“”The handover is almost done. He just needs to be a nominal general alliance.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Besides, we don’t belong here to begin with.” ”

“Although she was born in the s galaxy, she had a greater sense of belonging to Earth. ”

“Shi Qingcheng still could not believe it. “You’ve already discussed it? He won’t go back on his word, right?” ”

“”No,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Shi Qingcheng Glanced at ye Zao. “It’s said that the IQ of a woman in love is zero. Zao Zao, are you sure he won’t go back on his word? There are plenty of scumbags!” ”

“”Don’t worry,”ye Zao smiled and said, “He’s not that kind of person.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng clicked her tongue and teased, “Zao Zao, I think you’ve really been poisoned by love.” ”

Ye Zao smiled but did not say anything.

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “When are you going to introduce brother-in-law to me?” ”

“”Right now is fine,”ye Zao said. ”

“Really?”Shi Qingcheng asked.

“Yes.”

“When are you leaving?”

Ye Zao lowered his head and looked at his watch. “He’ll be here soon.”

“As soon as he said that, the sound of footsteps could be heard in the air. Shi Qingcheng turned around and saw a tall figure with a body as long as jade. ”

“Although she could not see his face clearly due to the backlight, she could sense his powerful aura. Even Shi Qingcheng, who had seen many important figures before, could not help but shudder. ”

“Leader.”Cen Shaoqing walked to ye Zao’s side.

“Shi Qingcheng could clearly feel that Cen Shaoqing’s aura changed the moment he walked over. When he faced ye Zao, he was like the Spring Breeze in spring and March, without any coldness at all. ”

“”You’re here.”Ye Zao slightly raised his eyes and continued, “Let me introduce you. This is my childhood friend, Shi Qingcheng. Qingcheng, this is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing politely nodded at Shi Qingcheng. “Hello, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“”Hello, brother-in-law.”Shi Qingcheng was a person who knew how to cause trouble. “No wonder when Zao Zao mentioned you, his eyes were full of light. You’re indeed a dragon and Phoenix among individuals!” ”

“”Thank you.”Cen Shaoqing had always been a serious person. Other than being a little talkative in front of ye Zao, he did not have much to say in front of others. ”

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Alright, I’ve already met you. I Won’t be a third wheel anymore. Ye Xiaohan, I haven’t been to the General Alliance for many years. Aren’t you going to bring me around?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes. Ye Han, bring Qingcheng around the area. Oh right, Qingcheng, do you have a boyfriend?” ”

“”A single dog,”Shi Qingcheng said. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Our family’s Ye Han is passionate about matchmaking. We can ask him to introduce you.” ”

“Okay.”Shi Qingcheng looked at Ye Han. “How about it? Do you have a handsome guy to introduce me?”

“Without waiting for ye Han to speak, Shi Qingcheng continued, “If you really don’t have one, you can make do with it!” ”

“After saying that, Ye Han’s face instantly turned red. ”

“Shi Qingcheng had a smile on her face as she raised her feet and walked forward. After taking a few steps, she turned around and looked at Ye Han. “What are you waiting for! Let’s Go!” ”

Ye Han responded and followed Shi Qingcheng’s footsteps.

“The two of them chatted as they walked. Suddenly, Shi Qingcheng changed the topic and continued, “Ye Xiaohan, have you found a girlfriend?”? ”

“”No,”ye Han replied. ”

“”Then, let me introduce you to one?”Shi Qingcheng continued. ”

Ye Han scratched his head and did not say anything.

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Do you mind someone who is two or three years older than you?” ”

“”No, no, I mind...”Ye Han said. ”

“Shi Qingcheng smiled and said, “Then, what do you think of Me?” ”
