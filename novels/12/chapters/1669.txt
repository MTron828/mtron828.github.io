Professor Feng was stunned.

She did not expect to see Jamila here.

“Although she was a little surprised, she did not show it. She smiled and said, “Hello, Dr. Jamila.” ”

“”Hello, Professor Feng.”Jamila stood up and took the initiative to reach out her hand to professor Feng. ”

Professor Feng reached out his hand to hold Jamila’s hand.

“Director ma smiled and said, “Professor Feng, we are all on the same side. There’s no need to be so formal. Please sit down.” ”

Jamila smiled and nodded. “Director Ma is right.”

Professor Feng felt that something was wrong.

Why would director Ma arrange for her to have dinner with Jamila?

Professor Feng did not have a good impression of Jamila.

“It was because when the aircraft carrier project hadn’t been completed, Jamila had been so arrogant. ”

It was as if the Chinese were inferior to C Nation in everything!

Jamila called the waiter over to order. “What’s the Chef’s recommended menu today?”

The waiter handed the menu to Jamila.

Jamila took the menu and began to order.

Professor Feng then realized that the usually crowded western restaurant didn’t have many customers today.

Professor Feng felt that something was wrong and raised his head to look at director Ma.

“Director ma smiled at her, indicating that she was at ease. ”

“”I’m sorry, I have to go to the washroom.” ”

“Okay.”Camilla nodded.

“After professor Feng left, Camilla looked at director Ma and continued, “Didn’t director Ma explain the situation to Professor Feng?” ”

“Director ma said, “Professor Feng has a strange personality. In our words, she is a hypocrite. If I had told her in advance, she wouldn’t have come with me.” ”

“After working with Professor Feng for so many years, director Ma knew director Ma too well. ”

Jamila nodded to show that she understood.

“At this moment, director Ma received a text message. ”

Director ma clicked on the text message and saw that it was from Professor Feng.

“After reading the text message, director Ma stood up from the dining table. “Dr. Jamila, I’m sorry. I need to go to the bathroom too.” ”

“Please go ahead.”

Director Ma walked in the direction of the bathroom.

“Just as he reached the corner, he saw Professor Feng standing there waiting for him. ”

“Director Ma walked over. “Professor Feng, are you looking for me for something?” ”

“Professor Feng’s expression didn’t look too good. “Director Ma, what do you mean?” ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What’s Wrong?”Director Ma was stunned.

“Professor Feng continued, “Why did you call Jamila over?” ”

“I just want to ask you a question.”Director ma looked at Professor Feng. “Do you want to land in Europa?”

Of course!

Europa was professor Feng’s lifelong dream.

“Hearing this, professor Feng nodded. ”

“Director ma continued, “I have a way for you to successfully land in Europe.” ”

Professor Feng’s eyes lit up. “What Way?”

The corners of director Ma’s mouth curled into a satisfied smile. “Cooperate with C Nation. Dr. Jamila will help us realize this wish.”

What?

Cooperate with C Nation?

“Professor Feng widened his eyes and glared at director Ma. “Ma Jianbang, what are you talking about? You want me to betray the base? Betray Miss Ye?” ”

“Although professor Feng really wanted to land on Europa, she couldn’t make her betray ye Zhuo and the base! ”

“”Keep your voice down! “Listen to me!”Director ma continued, “This is not betrayal, this is a good bird choosing its habitat! “Think about it, what was our purpose in joining the CEN’s base? “Was it to study Europa and land on Europa?” ”

Professor Feng didn’t say anything as he recalled their original goal and dream.

“When Professor Feng first heard about Europa, she was in her second year of high school. ”

“At that time, she had been longing to land on this beautiful and mysterious planet. ”

“When she learned that the aircraft carrier plan had succeeded in taking off, she was so happy that tears filled her eyes. ”

Because she saw hope.

“She had thought that she would never be able to land on Europa in her lifetime! After all, Europa was too far away from Earth. With the current speed of humans, it was impossible for them to land on Europa. ”

Until the light speed aircraft carrier appeared!

“But who knew that when they proposed the plan to land on Europa, Ye Zhuo rejected the plan without hesitation! ”

God knows how desperate she was at that time!

Only those who had experienced it personally would know that feeling.

“Not only did ye Zhuo reject their plan to land in Europe, but he also belittled Europe to the point that it was useless and permanently banned them from entering Europe! ”

“Seeing that Professor Feng remained silent, director ma continued, “Professor Feng, I’m the same as you. None of us want to betray the base or Miss Ye! But now, we have already gone against our original ideals. Are you willing to give up on Europe just like that?” ”
