Translator: 549690339

“When Lin Jincheng said this, Old Lady Lin felt as if her heart had been broken. ”

“Originally, Lin Qingxuan’s matter had been a thorn in her heart. ”

But Lin Jincheng had openly revealed this matter.

What was the difference between this and a public execution?

“She was Lin Jincheng’s biological mother, but Lin Jincheng, this unfilial son, had poured salt on her wound. ”

UNFILIAL!

It was simply unfilial!

“”Do you still treat me as your biological mother?”Old Lady Lin’s eyes were red as she said, “The reason why Qingxuan and I ended up like this is all because of you unfilial sons! If you didn’t allow Xia Xiaoman, this B * Tch, to marry in, would qingxuan and I end up like this? Ask yourselves, do you still treat Qingxuan as your biological brothers!” ”

“Of course, if the four brothers of the Lin family treated Lin Qingxuan as their blood brother, they would not let someone like Xia Xiaoman marry into the Lin Family! ”

They thought that they were doing it for Lin Qingxuan’s good!

In fact!

They were harming Lin Qingxuan!

Only she was doing it for Lin Qingxuan’s good.

“However, Lin Qingxuan did not know how to appreciate their kindness and even thought that those people were doing it for his good. ”

“Every time she thought of this, Old Lady Lin felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Jincheng and continued, “Now, I will give you two choices. One is to take Xianxian as your goddaughter, and the other is to get out of the old mansion!”The Lin family manor was hers. ”

She was the old lady of the Lin family.

“If a tiger did not show its might, would everyone treat her like a sick cat? ”

Old Lady Lin had finally seen through it. She would rather leave the Lin family manor and the family business to Feng Xianxian than to leave it to an unfilial son like Lin Jincheng.

Unless Lin Jincheng was willing to accept Feng Qianxian and treat Feng Qianxian as his own daughter.

“Now, there were only two paths before Lin Jincheng. ”

“Lin Jincheng frowned and said, “First, I will not accept Feng Qianxian as my goddaughter. Second, I will not leave the old manor!”The Lin family manor was Old Master Lin’s life’s work. To let him move out and let an outsider take advantage of him! ”

Was there such a good thing in the world?

“Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Jincheng in disbelief. “You, you dare not move! Lin Jincheng, do you still have a mother in your heart?” ”

Old Lady Lin did not expect Lin Jincheng to say such a thing.

Not moving?

This huge Lin family was her family business. Why shouldn’t Lin Jincheng move?

“This family’s surname is Lin. It’s not Zhao!”

“”They’re rebelling! They’re rebelling! I see that all of you are rebelling!”Old Lady Lin roared, “Men! Men!” ”

“Immediately, bodyguards walked in from outside. ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Chase this unfilial son out!” ”

“The bodyguards looked at each other, and no one dared to make a move. ”

After all.

“The person in charge of the Lin family was Lin Jincheng, and the person who paid their salaries was also Lin Jincheng. ”

“Seeing this, Old Lady Lin became even angrier and almost fainted. ”

Lin Jincheng glanced at Old Lady Lin and turned to leave.

East courtyard.

“Seeing that Lin Jincheng had returned, ye Shu asked curiously, “Old lady asked you to go over?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Ye Shu moved out the Lily of the valley from the house to bask in the Sun. “She asked you to go over for something, right?” ”

“The Lily of the valley was like a string of small white bells. The Breeze blew gently and the fragrance of the flowers could be smelled. Ye Shu liked these flowers very much. Because the temperature was low sooner or later, she only brought them out to bask in the sun at noon. ”

Lin Jincheng told ye Shu exactly what Old Lady Lin had said.

“Hearing this, Ye Shu frowned and said, “She wants us to take Feng Xianxian as our goddaughter? What is she thinking? Does she still think that Feng Qianhua didn’t poison her enough?” ”

Lin Jincheng’s expression was also a little ugly. “Just ignore her.”

“After saying this, Lin Jincheng looked at the Lily of the valley in ye Shu’s hand and said with a smile, “This flower has bloomed again?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Yes, it’s the second one this year.” ”

“When the Lily of the valley was first bought, it was in full bloom. Unexpectedly, after the flower had withered, it bloomed a second time. ”

“Moreover, this time it bloomed even more vigorously than the previous one. ”

“Ye Zao walked out from inside and said in a low voice, “Dad, although you have already rejected grandma, based on her personality, she definitely won’t let it go.” ”

Lin Jincheng frowned. “Then what else does she want?”

“I guess she is already planning to bring Feng Qianxian over.”Ye Zao understood Old Lady Lin’s personality too well.

Bring her over?

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng’s frown deepened. “Do you have any solutions, Zhuo Zhuo?” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo smiled. “There is one. It depends on whether you cooperate or not.”
