“”His name is Chen Yaosheng,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Old Master Bai narrowed his eyes. “Chen Jinyan’s son?”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“”The people in the Chen family are all very scheming. Be careful when you get along with him,”Old Master Bai instructed. ”

“After that, old master Chen added, “However, Chen Jinyan’s descendant should be stronger than Chen Jinyan. Jingshu, don’t think too much about it. It’s best to follow your heart.” ”

“After all, this was the first time Bai Jingshu had a good impression of a boy. Old Master Bai did not dare to say too much. ”

“If Chen Yaosheng was a good man, wouldn’t he be a hindrance? ”

“After leaving Old Master Bai’s side, Bai Jingshu arranged to meet man Wen at the same place. ”

“When Bai Jingshu arrived, Man Wen was already waiting. ”

“The Sun was setting in the west. The sunlight shone on his body, making his back look a little lonely. ”

It was as if he had suddenly grown up overnight.

“Manwen!”Bai Jingshu said softly.

“”Sister Jingshu.”Seeing Bai Jingshu, Manwen immediately stood up. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Why are you here so early? I thought I would wait for you for a while, but I didn’t expect you to wait for me.” ”

“”I just happened to have nothing to do, so I came,”Manwen continued. “I can’t let a Girl like you wait for me. Do you understand gentlemanly manners?” ”

“You’re right.”Bai Jingshu sat down next to man Wen. “How have you been?”

“”I guess.”Man Wen said, “What About You? Aren’t you supposed to be on Earth at this time? Why did you come back all of a sudden?” ”

“”I ran into something,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“”What is it? Tell me.”Man Wen opened a bottle of wine and handed it to Bai Jingshu. Then, he opened another bottle himself. “Let me see if I can help you with your doubts.” ”

Bai Jingshu took a sip of the wine. “Someone confessed to me. I don’t know if I want to be with him.”

“Man Wen was stunned at first, but then he asked curiously, “Really? Who Is It?” ”

He and Bai Jingshu were life-and-death friends.

“Although they were not blood-related siblings, they both regarded each other as very important. They were like family, and they talked about everything. ”

“In Manwen’s eyes, Bai Jingshu had always been a girl who had her own independent thoughts and would not be influenced by others. ”

“Moreover, in all these years, Manwen had never seen Bai Jingshu develop a good impression of any boy. Now that he heard that Bai Jingshu was actually considering whether to accept a certain boy, Manwen was quite surprised. ”

The reason why Bai Jingshu was considering it was definitely because this boy had also moved her heart.

“Otherwise, Bai Jingshu would never have told him this. ”

“”His name is Chen Yaosheng,”Bai Jingshu replied. ”

Chen Yaosheng?

“Hearing this, Man Wen Thought for a moment and continued, “Chen Yaosheng seemed to have chased after you before, right?” ”

“Actually, there were quite a number of people who chased after Bai Jingshu. The reason why man Wen had an impression of Chen Yaosheng was because Chen Yaosheng had some friendship with man Wen before. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “He did chase after me before.”

“So you only realized it now?”Man Wen continued to ask.

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “It’s not that I only realized it now. It’s only until today that I’ve gotten to know him again. It turns out that he’s very different from what I imagined.” ”

“How is he different?”Man Wen asked.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “He likes the ancient culture of Earth and likes to eat the same things as me. Most importantly, our three views are very appropriate.” ”

Different paths lead to different strategies.

“The most important thing between couples was their three views. If their three views were different, then there would be no more topics to talk about. ”

“Without topics, how could there be tacit understanding? ”

“Then what are you thinking now?”Man Wen asked.

Bai Jingshu shook her head. “I don’t know what I’m thinking either...”

She was a little confused and at a loss.

She didn’t know if she should accept Chen Yaosheng.

It was as if there were two little people fighting in her heart.

One said she accepted.

The other said she didn’t accept.

It was hard to choose.

“”Man Wen, have you ever liked someone?”Bai Jingshu continued to ask. ”

“”No.”Manwen was also an idiot in love, so he couldn’t give Bai Jingshu a better opinion, he continued, “I’ve dealt with Chen Yaosheng before, and I feel that he’s quite scheming. He’s the type who will do anything to achieve his goals. “If you’re with him, you must be very careful. Don’t be impulsive.” ”

“At this point, manman paused and continued, “And I also heard that girls have an IQ of 0 in the process of falling in love. You have to be careful. Don’t be fooled by those who have intentions.” ”
