“While other families’children had their hands full with all sorts of trophies, Bai Jingshu liked to research into some strange things. ”

“”Bai Jingshu, let me tell you! Don’t think that just because you have your grandfather backing you up that you can be so unruly! The old man is already ninety years old this year. He can protect you for a while, but he can’t protect you for the rest of your life!”Bai jiasheng continued, “Let me tell you, this marriage has to be arranged, or it has to be arranged!” ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“This was a notification, not a negotiation. ”

Bai Jingshu looked at Bai Jiasheng. “Then go ahead and arrange it. It has nothing to do with me anyway.”

“After saying that, she turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Bai Jingshu’s back, the Bai family was so angry that their liver hurt. ”

“Stop right there!”The Bai family was so angry that they roared.

Bai Jingshu didn’t seem to hear Bai Jiasheng’s voice.

“Bai Jiasheng turned to look at Zhou Ying and was so angry that he cursed, “Look at the good daughter you gave birth to! She’s disrespecting her elders! She’s getting more and more lawless!” ”

“He thought that marrying into a family would be a good marriage, but he didn’t expect Bai Jingshu to reject him directly. ”

UNFILIAL thing!

“Zhou Ying was a little speechless and said, “You say that as if she’s my only life!” ”

“Bai Jiasheng wanted to say something more, but when the words reached his mouth, they turned into a sigh. ”

Bai Jingshu went upstairs and looked up the information as if nothing had happened. She studied the outline and laid the foundation for the next novel.

She was a very responsible writer.

She never made up historical facts and was realistic. She restored the dust-covered history word by word.

“The next morning, Bai Jingshu went to Old Master Bai’s residence and said goodbye to him. ”

“”Grandpa, I’m going on a long trip again. I may not be able to visit you for some time.”Bai Jingshu squatted in front of old master Bai and massaged his legs. ”

“”Go ahead.”Old Master Bai smiled and said, “Young people should pursue their dreams at the best time.” ”

“”Grandpa, if I say that I’m going to Earth, will you still support me?”Bai Jingshu continued to ask. ”

“Old Master Bai looked at Bai Jingshu, “Silly Child, Grandpa already knows about your little matter. Isn’t it just earth? Everyone says that Earth is the lowest grade planet, but Grandpa doesn’t think so. Earth has Green Mountains and rivers, beautiful scenery, and beautiful people. It’s a very spiritual place! “It’s unlike this place. Although technology is advanced, it has long lost its humanity.” ”

“”Go, Jingshu, go chase your dreams! No matter what, Grandpa will support you.”At this point, elder Bai paused and continued, “As for your parents, you don’t have to worry about me. Leave everything to Grandpa.” ”

“”Thank you, grandfather.” ”

“”Silly child.”Elder Bai looked out of the window, his gaze distant and profound. ”

“After bidding farewell to elder Bai, Bai Jingshu came to Earth. ”

Over here.

Bai Yuanyuan successfully made an appointment with Chen Yaosheng.

Chen Yaosheng really liked Bai Jingshu.

It was a pity.

“In Chen Yaosheng’s opinion, Bai Jingshu was too cold and aloof. He simply couldn’t get her. ”

“When he found out that Bai Yuanyuan and Bai Mo wanted to help her, Chen Yaosheng was very excited. He immediately said, “If this matter can really be successful, I will definitely thank you both very much. I will go through fire and water without hesitation!” ”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “Mr. Chen, you are too polite. We sisters don’t ask for anything in return for helping you. We just want sister Jingshu to find her own happiness as soon as possible since she is not young anymore.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes,”Bai Yuanyuan said. ”

“Chen yaosheng said, “I still have to thank the two of you.” ”

“Bai Mo looked at Chen Yaosheng and continued, “Let’s Skip the pleasantries. Next, let’s get straight to the point.” ”

“Okay.”Chen Yaosheng was also a little impatient.

“Bai Mo continued, “Sister Jingshu has always liked Earth. You should know that.” ”

“”Yes.”Chen Yaosheng nodded. After all, Bai Jingshu was the person he liked. How could he not know that! ”

“Then do you know why sister Jingshu likes Earth?”Bai Mo continued to ask.

Chen Yaosheng shook his head. They really did not know about this question.

“”Because she likes Earth’s culture.”In order to let Chen Yaosheng better guide Bai Jingshu, Bai Mo specially went to investigate, he continued, “Sister Jingshu not only likes the culture of Earth, but she also likes to study the history of humanity on Earth. Oh right, she’s also a rather famous writer on Earth.” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Yaosheng frowned slightly. He did not understand why Bai Jingshu, who was such a nice girl, would like such things. ”

“People were all studying advanced things, but Bai Jingshu specifically picked them up and threw them away for research. If it was not because he liked Bai Jingshu, he really could not stand it! ”
