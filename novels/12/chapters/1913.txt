“After saying that, Qiu di took out the information on the star-crossing case. ”

“When she saw the information on the star-crossing case, Yi Ling’s fluttering little wings stopped. She said angrily, “You actually stole the information on the star-crossing case!” ”

“”No, you misunderstood.”Qiu di continued, “This information was personally sent by the Great Elder.” ”

The Great Elder sent it over?

How was that possible!

Ye Zhuo had helped the eight great clans to rebuild their foundations. The eight great elders would not betray ye Zhuo at all.

How could they possibly hand over the information of the trans-star case to Qiu Di?

“You’re lying!”

“”I’m not lying to you.”Qiu di continued, “As Miss Ye’s clothes spirit, I think you should be clear about the strength of the eight great clans. If the great elder had not personally sent it over, do you think I would have been able to snatch something from the hands of the eight great clans?” ”

This was a rhetorical question and also a statement.

“Hearing this, the spirit was immediately stunned. Her tiny eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

What Qiu di said was very right.

“Unless the eight great clans gave it to her with clasped hands, otherwise, with Qiu Di’s ability, she would absolutely not be able to snatch something from the hands of the eight great clans. ”

What exactly was going on?

Why did the eight great clans betray ye Zao?

Yi Ling only wanted to understand everything immediately.

“Qiu Di saw the change in Yi Ling’s expression, then he said, “Actually, sometimes i myself find it quite unbelievable. How did someone like me, who doesn’t know anything, get chosen by Miss Ye? So, it’s normal for you to have doubts about me. I Don’t blame you.” ”

This was taking a step back in order to advance.

Yi Ling had been by Ye Zao’s side for a long time and had long connected with Ye Zao’s mind. She could naturally see through Qiu di’s thoughts.

“”Bad Woman! You’re a bad woman! No matter how much you say, you’re still a bad woman!”Yi Ling glared angrily at Qiu Di, she flapped her wings and launched an attack. “You’ve coveted Miss Ye’s position for so long. Perhaps you’re the one who caused Miss Ye’s death. I’m going to kill you and avenge Miss Ye!” ”

Qiu Di quickly dodged.

“The transparent shockwave hit the wall behind him, directly piercing through the wall one hole after another. ”

“”Calm down.”Qiu Di narrowed his eyes. “I’m also very sad and sad about Miss Ye’s death, but things have already happened. We living people can’t keep standing still!” ”

“”Bad woman, Shut Up!”The spirit coat was a very loyal creature. It only acknowledged one master in its life. ”

“Moreover, it was nourished by ye Zhuo’s blood. ”

It was born for Ye Zhuo.

“Even if it died, it would die for ye Zhuo. ”

“Although Qiu Di’s disguise was very good, it absolutely did not believe it. ”

“Seeing that the clothes spirit’s moves were becoming more and more ruthless, Qiu Di was somewhat unable to withstand it and pressed the switch on his wrist. ”

Di —

“The next second, the office door was pushed open from the outside. Ye Han rushed in from the outside and blocked in front of Qiu Di. ”

“Seeing ye Han, Yi Ling became even angrier, she said angrily, “Ye Han, you’re a traitor! Are you letting miss ye down by doing this? Miss ye treated you so well, yet you repaid kindness with enmity! As long as you have a little bit of conscience, you can’t do such a thing!” ”

There was only one thought in ye Han’s mind right now.

“Protect Qiu di well, and don’t let Qiu di get hurt in the slightest. ”

“Ye Han threw out the emei thorn, directly hitting Yi Ling who was flying in the air. ”

Bang!

“Fresh blood splattered everywhere, directly dyeing the snow-white wall red. ”

“Yi Ling looked at Ye Han like this, the expression in her eyes turning from pain to disappointment, and then to disbelief. ”

Was the person in front of her really ye Han?

A warm scene appeared in front of Yi Ling’s eyes.

“”Little Ling Ling, you can’t eat anymore. Look at how fat you’ve become!” ”

“”You’re the pig, your whole family is pigs!” ”

“”Ling Ling, do you want to eat Margot?” ”

“Are you crazy? That’s burning’s favorite dessert.”

“Ye Han lowered his voice and said, “It’s okay, I only took a little.” ”

“...”

“In his memory, Ye Han treated it very well. Although he despised it every day, he would bring it delicious food every time he went out, and even stole ye Zao’s favorite dessert for it. ”

“In her memory, Ye Han was even more respectful to ye Zao than his own sister... ”

What happened?

What happened to Ye Han?

“Yi Ling was hit by the Emei Spike on the wall and slowly slid down. She looked at Ye Han like this, her eyes very red as she spoke in a hoarse voice, “I was just taking a nap. Why has everyone changed after I woke up? Miss ye is no longer around, the great elder has betrayed us, and even you have changed... why...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Yi Ling directly burst into tears. She sobbed incessantly, feeling extremely aggrieved. ”
