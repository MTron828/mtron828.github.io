Second place...

One place higher than Feng Xianxian.

Old Mrs. Lin was instantly speechless.

“The next day, Lin Ze, Li Wen, Fatty Hu, and dog two boarded the plane to Yun Jing. ”

It was different from last time.

“This time, Lin Ze went openly. ”

“Four and a half hours later, the plane landed on time at the airport. ”

The four of them pulled their suitcases out of the airport.

“Fat Tiger’s family had relatives in Yun Jing, so he wasn’t too unfamiliar with Yun Jing. “Let’s go to the hotel first, then we’ll set off in the afternoon to play.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Knowing that they had a small tail behind them, the other three tried their best not to talk about Lin Ze’s biological mother. ”

“It was the first time that dog two and Li Wen had come to Yun Jing, so they were amazed. “So Yun Jing is so prosperous. I thought that Yun Jing was many times behind our Jing City!” ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yun Jing was a very old and charming city. The tourism chain had driven the development of the entire city.

“Fat tiger smiled and said, “Don’t think that Yun Jing is small, but there are a lot of rich people in Yun Jing!” ”

The four of them chatted and laughed until they reached the hotel.

“It was not until they closed the door that Li Wen said, “What about brother Ze? With people following us, how are you going to find Auntie?” ”

“Although the four of them were not that old, their acute senses were not inferior to anyone else’s! ”

Lin Ze frowned slightly. “We’ll go to the temple in the afternoon and wait and see.”

Li Wen nodded.

“In the afternoon, the four of them went to the temple to burn incense and pray for their respective grandmothers. ”

Old Madam Lin was especially happy when she heard about this.

The first thing Lin Ze did when he went to Yun Jing was to go to the temple to burn incense and pray for her. How could she not be happy?

“This meant that he had put himself, his grandmother, first! ”

“”Alright, you don’t have to follow Ah ze tomorrow! It would be bad if ah ze found out,”said old Mrs. Lin. ”

The butler nodded.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian came on time to deliver the health soup to Old Mrs. Lin.

“”Qianhua, you’re here! Xianxian, come over quickly. Come and sit with Grandma.”Old Mrs. Lin waved at Feng Xianxian kindly. ”

“As there had never been a girl at home, Old Lady Lin liked Feng Xianxian no matter how she looked at it. ”

She felt that Feng Xianxian was her biological granddaughter.

“Grandma Lin.”Feng Xianxian walked over with a smile.

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “You Child, how many times have I told you! In the future, you’re not allowed to call me grandma Lin, you’re allowed to call me grandma.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s face showed a somewhat troubled expression. “Grandma, this is a little against the rules...” ”

“”What’s against the rules? If I say it’s against the rules, it’s against the rules!”Old Lady Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand. ”

“Feng Xianxian immediately called out sweetly, “Grandma!” ”

“Hey! Grandma’s good granddaughter!”Old Lady Lin was overjoyed.

“With Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian, the house was immediately filled with laughter. ”

Old Lady Lin was very happy.

This family could only be called a home with Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian.

“When Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were not around, the house was cold. ”

How was it like a Home?

“After Lin Ze and the others returned from the temple, they were surprised to find that their tails had disappeared. ”

Back to Beijing?

Lin Ze turned on his computer and hacked into the hotel’s internal system. He found that they had already checked out.

“”Mozzie, fat tiger, and Buttface.”Lin Ze looked up at the three people who were playing landlord. ”

“What happened to brother Ze?”The three people looked up in confusion.

“Lin Ze continued, “The person my grandmother sent to follow me has disappeared. You guys go and play tomorrow. Remember to buy me a tourist souvenir.” ”

“”Disappeared?”Buttface asked curiously, “Where did they go?” ”

“They should have returned to the capital.”

“Fat tiger added, “Brother Ze, why don’t we accompany you to look for them?” ”

Li Wen and dog two nodded.

“Lin Ze said, “There’s no need. You guys go and play. Remember to take more photos. Otherwise, it’ll be hard to explain when you go home. Besides, I don’t even know who my mother is. You guys won’t be able to help much.” ”

“Alright!”

“The three of them continued to play landlord. Lin Ze lay on the sofa and sent a wechat message to ye Sen. [ Uncle Ye, I’m here in Yunjing. ] ”

“Ye Sen happened to be chatting with Bai Wei. When he saw Lin Ze’s wechat message, he immediately replied, [ already here? ] ”

Lin Ze: [ yes. ]

“Ye Sen continued to reply, [ then we’ll have time to meet. ] ”

[ Okay. ]

The next day soon arrived.

“Early in the morning, Lin ze set off. ”

“Lin Ze did not know anything, so he naturally did not get any news that day. ”

But he was not discouraged.

“He believed that as long as he persevered, he would definitely be able to find his mother. ”

On the other side.
