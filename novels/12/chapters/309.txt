“Is there anything wrong?”Cen Shaoqing asked. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“”Your health is very good. There’s nothing wrong,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Are you sure?”

Ye Zhuo nodded very seriously. “I’m sure.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “But why do I have a feeling that something is wrong with me recently? I think I’m sick. Take a closer look at me and prescribe me two sets of Chinese Medicine.” ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. could he have seen wrongly? He reached out his hand to touch Cen Shaoqing’s pulse again and carefully felt it.

“Don’t worry. There’s nothing wrong. Everything is normal.”Ye Zhuo let go of his wrist.

“Everything is normal?”Cen Shaoqing was a little doubtful of ye Zhuo’s medical skills.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Judging from the pulse, there’s no problem at all. You said that there’s something wrong with you. What’s Wrong?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing counted the Buddha beads and recalled his symptoms. “Sometimes, it feels like I can’t control myself. My heart will suddenly beat faster and I Can’t Breathe...” ”

He could barely breathe.

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. It sounded quite serious.

Could it be that there was something wrong with her medical skills.

“Otherwise, how could she not see through Cen Shaoqing’s illness? ”

“Ye Zhuo had been single in his previous life, so he naturally did not know that this was the feeling of liking someone. ”

“When did these symptoms start?”

“”About... two to three months ago,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Is there a pattern to the onset of the illness?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing thought about it very seriously. “It doesn’t seem to be very regular. Sometimes it’s in the morning, sometimes it’s in the afternoon, and sometimes it’s at night.” ”

Ye Zhuo searched through the medical knowledge in his mind. “Then how often does it happen?”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “It doesn’t seem to be regular either. Sometimes it happens once a week, and sometimes it happens once every two or three days.” ”

Ye Zhuo reached out his hand. “Let me take a look at your pulse again.”

Cen Shaoqing passed his hand over.

Ye Zhuo carefully listened to Cen Shaoqing’s pulse again.

“His pulse was strong and powerful, and it beat 90 times a minute. ”

“Not only was there no problem, but he was also very healthy. ”

Strange!

It was really too strange!

Ye Zhuo fell into self-doubt.

“Can’t you see anything?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “Other than being unable to control himself and having a rapid heartbeat and being unable to breathe, are there any other symptoms?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression remained the same. “No.”

“”This illness of yours is a little strange.”Ye Zao said anxiously, “I’ve been a doctor for so long, but I’ve never seen such a strange symptom.” ”

“Not only had he not seen it before, but he had also never seen it before. ”

Even the ancient medical books that ye Zao had read did not record it.

“After saying that.., ye Zao continued, “However, based on my experience, it shouldn’t be a serious illness. Don’t be too anxious. I’ll go back and flip through the medical books. You should also go to the hospital to have a check-up. Sometimes, western medical instruments can detect problems that can not be detected by traditional Chinese medicine.” ”

“Alright.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

Ye Zhuo looked at the sky. “It’s still early. I’ll go for another two laps.”

“Pay attention to your safety.”

“Don’t worry.”Ye Zhuo turned around and walked towards the reef.

Cen Shaoqing watched her back view.

Those two long legs swayed in front of his eyes.

“Suddenly, the strange feeling of his heart racing and being unable to breathe came back. ”

“Bang, Bang, Bang — ”

It was as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

Even ye Zao could not diagnose what illness it was.

Could it be...

A terminal illness?

“Ye Zao swam a few laps in the sea. Before sunset, he returned to the shore and prepared to go to the villa to take a shower and change his clothes before enjoying the sunset by the sea. ”

“Just as he walked to the shore, he saw Cen Shaoqing lying on the beach chair with his eyes slightly closed. It seemed that he was asleep. ”

“The hand on his abdomen was holding a string of bright red Buddhist beads. Tassels of the same color surrounded his fingers, making his already fair skin look as white as jade and giving off a cold light. ”

“His entire body was shrouded in the shadow of the beach umbrella. There was a coldness in his abstinence. He was clearly a thousand miles away from others, but he was also full of temptation. ”

Ye Zhuo looked down at Cen Shaoqing from above.

He suddenly realized.

This guy was really not ordinary good-looking.

At least.

“In her previous life, she had never seen such a good-looking person. ”

“He had straight eyebrows, a very high nose bridge, and thin lips that were almost pursed into a line. ”

How could such a good-looking person see through the secular world?

“Ye Zhuo was a good-looking dog to begin with. At this moment, he could not help but bend down slightly. Looking closer, there was actually not a single blemish on this person’s face. His eyelashes were long enough to be comparable to a girl’s. ”
