He had really done something evil in his previous life. That was why he had such a son and daughter-in-law in this life!

“Zhou Ying looked at elder Bai, “Dad, it’s not right for you to talk like that. There are all parents in the world. which parent doesn’t want their children to be good? The reason why we are like that is for the sake of Jingshu! Isn’t it normal for parents to have a little bit of friction with their children? Why do you have to cling onto this point? Yes, it was our fault to sever our relationship with Jingshu back then, but we have now realized our mistake! Can’t we just admit our mistake and change? Killing people is just a nod of the head. What else do you want? Do you really want our children to be separated?” ”

Zhou Ying’s eyes turned red. She really looked like a good mother.

“If people saw her, they would think that Zhou Ying was a good mother who loved her daughter dearly. What kind of vicious husband was elder Bai to make things difficult for his daughter-in-law online! ”

“Elder Bai was angered by Zhou Ying’s actions and laughed. “Wrong? Now You Know You’re Wrong? If saying you know you’re wrong can solve the problem, then why do you need the Court?” ”

“”Dad, then what do you want us to do?”Bai Jiacheng was a little angry, he stood up and said, “Jingshu is my daughter, and I’m her father. Even if we break the sky, she’s still my daughter! The father-daughter relationship between us is not something that you can change with just a word!” ”

“Sometimes, Bai Jiacheng even doubted if he was his biological son! ”

“Other fathers were eager for their sons to cross the line, but his old father had to become a stumbling block on his road to success! ”

And it was the kind of stumbling block that couldn’t be kicked away!

“”Do you think that the letter of termination was signed for Nothing?”Elder bai continued, “Also, if outsiders were to find out that you have designs on cloning, do you think you would still be tied to Jingshu? If you don’t believe me, you can try! Bai Jiacheng, I’m warning you, if I really provoke your father, I’ll do anything!” ”

“In the S Galaxy, cloning technology was already very mature, but cloning technology was strictly prohibited here. ”

“Once it was discovered that cloning technology had been used for private purposes, the highest penalty could be death! ”

“In short, elder Bai would definitely not let the couple, Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying, continue to cause trouble for Bai Jingshu! ”

“Bai Jingshu had finally made it this far. In the days to come, elder Bai hoped that she would be happy and spend the rest of her life with Lin Ze. ”

Bai Jiacheng was stunned when he heard that. He looked at elder Bai in disbelief. “Dad! Are you still my biological father?”

Bai Jiacheng was starting to doubt his life!

How could there be such a father in this world?

“Elder bai continued, “Think about it. Think about it. Do you deserve to be a father? And you, Zhou Ying! Jingshu is the daughter that you’ve been carrying for ten months. Even if you don’t like her, you shouldn’t be thinking about cloning!” ”

“Zhou Ying didn’t say anything. She lowered her head, her eyes filled with regret. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“If she had known that Bai Jingshu would end up like this, she wouldn’t have understood what cloning meant even if she was beaten to death! ”

“But now, what was the use of regret? ”

“Zhou Ying looked up at elder Bai, she said sincerely, “Dad, please give us another chance! “I swear that I will be a good mother in the future and protect Jingshu well. I Won’t let her get hurt! “Besides, Jingshu’s in-laws should have a family to support her!” ”

“Bai Jiasheng quickly nodded in agreement. “Zhou Ying is right. Dad, please forgive us this time. I can promise you that there won’t be a next time!” ”

“”Have you really regretted it?”Elder Bai looked at the two of them. “Touch your conscience and tell me, have you really not taken a liking to Lin Ze’s identity?” ”

“If it had been the day before Bai Jingshu’s wedding and the two of them had regretted it, he might have given them another chance, but now... ”

They wouldn’t!

The two of them were clearly here for Lin Ze’s identity.

“If Lin Ze was down and out one day, they would definitely be the first to abandon Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze. ”

“”No, it really isn’t!”Zhou Ying smiled obsequiously, “Dad, we really know that we were wrong. We want to make it up to Jingshu. We know that we haven’t been good parents all these years. Now that Jingshu is married, please forgive us for once so that she won’t be looked down upon in-laws!” ”

“Get lost!”Old Master Bai pointed at the door.

Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying were unwilling to leave.
