“”Then, then what should we do?”Uncle Fu said anxiously, “We can’t really let the eldest young master become the son-in-law of the Zhao family, right?” ”

“Hearing this, Old Master Jin didn’t get angry. Instead, he laughed, “Son-in-law of the Zhao family? If he wants to become the son-in-law of the Zhao family, people might not even like him! Do you really think that the Zhao family is so easy to enter? He thinks too highly of himself!”Without the status of the eldest young master of the Jin family, the lawyer was just a worker who wanted nothing. ”

How could Zhao Xueyin take a fancy to him?

It was simply a fantasy!

“Uncle Fu was stunned. “But from what I see, Zhao Zhenfei seems to be quite satisfied with eldest young master... Miss Zhao treats eldest young master quite well too.” ”

“”Satisfied?”Old Master Jin sneered, “With that Old Fox Zhao zhenfei, how could I not understand him? He treats Ruyu like a chess piece that he can manipulate at will! And that Zhao Xueyin, her heart is as high as the sky, and her life is as thin as paper! In her heart, Ruyu is a worker for their Zhao family! Ruyu doesn’t even have the right to carry her shoes! It’s also because Ruyu can’t see her true face clearly!” ”

Old Master Jin saw all of this.

Unfortunately.

The lawyer didn’t believe him.

“Y-you’re telling the truth?”Uncle Fu gulped.

“Old Master Jin looked at Uncle Fu. “Why? Don’t tell me you’re like Ruyu, thinking that I’m trying to sow discord? Sow discord between him and Zhao Xueyin?” ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Uncle Fu didn’t say anything.

“In fact, he really thought so. ”

“All these years, Old Master Jin had thought of many ways to get the lawyer to come back. ”

Uncle Fu thought that it was old master Jin’s doing this time.

He didn’t expect...

“Seeing uncle Fu like this, old master Jin sighed, “Ruyu is my son! A Tiger doesn’t eat its own son, let alone a human? If he and Zhao Xueyin really love each other, I’ll accept it even if it’s the other way around!” ”

“Seeing that old master Jin didn’t seem like he was going against his words, uncle Fu quickly picked up his phone, “Then I’ll call eldest young master again! I Can’t let eldest young master waste his time in the Zhao family!” ”

The Zhao family was obviously using the lawyer as a backup!

“”Forget it, forget it,”old master Jin continued, “He doesn’t believe us. No matter how many times you call him, it’s useless! “Ruyu, that child, has an extreme personality. She Won’t turn back until she hits a wall! “However, this is also my fault. If I hadn’t chilled his heart, he wouldn’t have become like this!” ”

“When he said the last sentence, Old Master Jin sighed deeply. ”

“In the past, he never knew what it felt like to regret what he had done. ”

Now.

He lived every day in regret.

Uncle Fu wanted to say something but hesitated. He didn’t know how to comfort Old Master Jin.

After all.

It was indeed Old Master Jin’s fault for what had happened in the past.

“After some thought, uncle fu continued, “It’s better to call him! What if the young master listens this time?” ”

Old Master Jin nodded.

Uncle Fu dialed the number.

“One second, two seconds... ... until uncle Fu thought that Si lui was going to answer the call, but there was a busy tone on the other end of the line. ”

It was very obvious.

Si lui immediately cut off the call.

“Uncle Fu called again, but the line was cut off again. ”

Old Master Jin’s eyes dimmed and he turned to look outside. “It’s getting late. You should rest early.”

“Uncle Fu looked at the phone that had been hung up and explained on Si lui’s behalf, “Master, don’t think too much. Perhaps eldest young master is busy right now.” ”

Old Master Jin waved his hand and turned around to leave. “Go and rest.”

Uncle Fu bowed to Old Master Jin’s back. “You should rest early too.”

...

The next day arrived in the blink of an eye.

In the top-floor office of the Shunxi Financial Group.

“Zhao Xueyin sat behind her desk and looked up at Si lui. “Brother Si, Ye Zhuo is coming soon. Tell me, where do you want to arrange for her?” ”

Si lui was a person with real talent.

“Every time he encountered a major event, Zhao Xueyin would ask for his opinion so that he would not take detours. ”

“Si lui flipped through a page of the document in front of him, “Ye Zhuo is different from that Xi Weiyue. When it comes to people like Xi Weiyue, we can arrange for her to be at the lowest level, but not ye Zhuo. After all, Ye Zhuo is ye Langhua’s granddaughter! Her job is passable on the surface!” ”

“”If she can’t be at the lowest level, then can we only arrange for her to be at the higher level?”Zhao Xueyin asked. ”

“Yes.”

“Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly, “You said it yourself, Ye Zhuo is ye Langhua’s granddaughter after all. We’re related by blood. In addition, there are many old man Ye’s subordinates in the consortium. If we arrange for ye Zhuo to be at the higher level, will it affect us?” ”

“Of course.”Si lui smiled.

“”Since there is, why do you want me to arrange for her to be in a high position?” ”

“Si lui smiled and said, “It’s good to have an influence.” ”

“What do you mean?”Zhao Xueyin did not understand Si lui’s words.

“Si lui continued, “What do you think of Ye Zao’s ability?” ”

Zhao Xueyin did not say anything.

“Si lui said, “Ye Zao may have had very high achievements in the scientific and technological world! But this is the financial world. How much does a scientific researcher know about finance?” ”

The circle was different. How could they blend in?

Ye Zhuo was not omnipotent!

She could control technology with her left hand and understand finance with her right hand?

Zhao Xueyin instantly understood the meaning behind the lawyer’s words. “Are you trying to make her back down?”

“”Yes.”The lawyer nodded, “Even if she backs down, those old shareholders are not fools. They are not stupid enough to support a person who has no business talent! “If we let ye Zhuo take the position of the chief operating officer, can our consortium still see the future? “Since we can’t see the future, of course we should stop the losses in time!” ”

“Businessmen only talked about money, not feelings. ”

“The lawyer not only wanted ye Zhuo to retreat in the face of difficulties, but also wanted her to become a joke in the financial world. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer. “Listening to your words is better than studying for ten years. Brother Si, thank you.” ”

The lawyer closed the document and raised his eyebrows. “You still want to say thank you to me?”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “If you don’t say thank you, I’ll treat you to a meal. Are You Going?” ”

“”Yes, I’m invited by a beauty. How can I not go?”The lawyer smiled. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes dimmed. ”

She was very clear that she did not like the lawyer.

The lawyer was not worthy of her.

But she was afraid that she would hurt the lawyer’s self-esteem by saying it out loud.

She couldn’t bear to hurt the lawyer.

The two of them went to the basement parking garage.

The lawyer opened the car door.

“Zhao Xueyin’s gaze inadvertently swept across the lawyer’s hand. She frowned slightly and said, “Big Brother Si, I remember that you had a burn on your wrist earlier, right?” ”

A faint light flashed in the lawyer’s eyes. “I used the scar removal cream to remove it.”
