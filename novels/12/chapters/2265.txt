“Looking at Ye Shu’s back, Bai Jingshu exclaimed, “Auntie is so passionate!” ”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu even felt that it would be great if this woman in front of her was her mother. ”

“”Yes, my mother is a very nice person.”Lin Ze continued, “You don’t have to worry about Chen Yaosheng’s matter. I’ve already arranged for someone to send him back to the s galaxy.” ”

“Chen Yaosheng was suspected of attempted rape and attempted murder. The evidence was conclusive. With the two charges added together, it was enough for him to suffer quite a few grievances. ”

“”Mr. Lin, thank you.”She had only met Lin Ze by chance, but Lin Ze had helped her so much. Bai Jingshu was really grateful in her heart. ”

“Lin Ze chuckled. “Since I woke up this morning, think about it. How many times have you said thank you to me?” ”

‘thank you’seemed to have become Bai Jingshu’s catchphrase.

“Bai Jingshu subconsciously bit her lip and continued, “Because other than thank you, I don’t know what else to say.” ”

The Lin siblings had been too kind to her.

She would definitely repay them properly.

“”Other than thank you, you can also give yourself to me.”Even Lin Ze himself did not expect to say this out loud. After saying that, Lin Ze was stunned, and his expression was a little unnatural. ”

There were only two things in this world that could not be concealed.

Coughing and liking.

“Perhaps even Lin Ze himself did not expect that one day, he would fall in love with a girl so quickly. ”

“Although Lin Ze had never liked a girl before, he knew very well that this was liking. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu was also stunned. “What?” ”

She really did not hear him clearly. Perhaps she did not expect Lin Ze to say this.

“Because in Bai Jingshu’s eyes, Lin Ze had always been a serious person. ”

“”It’s nothing.”Lin Ze pressed his fist against his lips and coughed lightly to cover up his awkwardness, then, he said, “I think that with our current friendship, you don’t have to call me Mr. Lin anymore. Just call me by my name. My name is Lin Ze, and this name is meant for people to call me.” ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Okay, then you don’t have to call me Miss Bai. You can call me Bai Jingshu or Jingshu.” ”

“Okay.”

“Lin Ze continued, “Although Chen Yaosheng has already been sent back, I think it’s best if you go back.” ”

Only Bai Jingshu would keep an eye on this matter. She would not let anyone take advantage of it.

“I...”Bai Jingshu hesitated.

“What’s Wrong?”Lin Ze continued to ask.

“Bai Jingshu said, “My interstellar shuttle is out of order.” ”

“After learning that Chen Yaosheng was lying to her, Bai Jingshu decided to go back. ”

Who knew that the interstellar shuttle wouldn’t start no matter what.

“Helpless, Bai Jingshu could only give up on going back. ”

“I’ll Lend You Mine.”Lin Ze took out an electronic key from his pocket.

“What About You?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze said, “I won’t use the interstellar shuttle for the time being. If I really need it, I can borrow my sister’s.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Thank...”

“Before she could finish her sentence, Lin ze smiled and said, “You have to thank me again?” ”

Bai Jingshu chuckled. “You can see that.”

“Although it hadn’t been that long, the two of them got along more naturally. ”

“A moment later, Lin Ze brought Bai Jingshu to the basement where the interstellar shuttle was stored. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “If you encounter any difficulties in Galaxy S, you can contact me. Don’t find it troublesome!” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Jingshu wanted to say thank you, but she swallowed her words just in time. ”

There was no need to thank her.

“When ye Shu came back from work, Lin Ze was the only one left in the house. ”

“Ye Shu asked curiously, “Where’s Jingshu? Why Are You Alone?” ”

Lin Ze adjusted his glasses. “She’s going back.”

“Why don’t you let her stay for a few more days?”Ye Shu complained.

“”She has something to do when she goes back.”Lin Ze continued, “Do you like her a lot?” ”

“”Who wouldn’t like a beautiful and sensible girl?”Ye Shu continued, “Ah Ze, in the future, you can just look for a girlfriend according to Jingshu’s conditions.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded with a smile.

Ye Shu was stunned. She subconsciously felt that Lin Ze was a little strange today.

“If it were any other time, Lin Ze would definitely say that he was not in a hurry right now. ”

“But today, Lin Ze actually nodded. ”

What did this mean?

It meant that Lin Ze didn’t resist finding a girlfriend!

“”Ze, tell mom honestly. What’s going on between you and Jingshu?”Ye Shu looked at Lin Ze and asked with narrowed eyes. ”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
