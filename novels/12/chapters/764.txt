Apologize?

Ask her to apologize to Ye Zhuo?

“Liu Caiyi’s face was already ugly to begin with. After hearing these words, her face became even uglier.”

She was the vice president of the Chinese Painting Association.

She was going to be the president of the association in the future.

How could she apologize to Ye Zhuo?

“If she really apologized, where would she put her face?”

No.

She couldn’t apologize.

“Liu Caiyi’s hands, which were hidden in her sleeves, shook again and again.”

“”Chief Li,”Han Zhen stood up from the seats, “Vice-president Liu merely raised objections to the competition. Everyone makes mistakes. Since it’s a competition, it’s normal for someone to raise objections. There’s no need to apologize, right?””

“Liu Caiyi was, after all, the President of the Chinese Arts Association. If she really apologized, it would make the Chinese arts world lose face.”

Han Zhen was a very thoughtful person.

She was afraid that this would offend the Chinese art world.

To make Liu Caiyi apologize and offend the entire Chinese art world was a very unwise decision.

Ye Zao’s talent could not be denied.

But this apology could not be said.

“If ye Zao was a sensible person, she should have stood up herself and asked Li Zhentian not to fuss over this matter and at the same time give Liu Caiyi a way out.”

But now it seemed.

Ye Zao was completely carried away.

He actually did not say a word.

Such a person could really become the future hope of the literary world.

Han Zhen was faintly worried.

She was afraid that ye Zao would not be able to shoulder this heavy responsibility.

When Han Zhen said this.

The audience also felt that Han Zhen was quite right.

It was normal for someone to raise objections in the competition.

“Now that it was proven that ye Zao was not an imposter, there was no need for ye Zao to be calculative.”

“After all, she had not lost anything.”

“Ye Zao is too pretentious. isn’t she just being suspected? What’s The Big Deal! She has nothing to lose!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That’s right! What right does she have for president Liu to apologize to her?”

“She’s just being petty!”

“Seeing that the public opinion was gradually shifting in her direction, Liu Caiyi heaved a sigh of relief.”

Her popularity in the Chinese art world all these years had not been accumulated for nothing.

So what if ye Zao got first place?

He was just a rookie!

Master Yu frowned and turned his head to look at Han Zhen.

Han Zhen looked straight ahead and avoided master Yu’s gaze.

Master Yu was muddle-headed. It was normal that he had not thought things through thoroughly.

“However, she had to be responsible for the literary world.”

“In the audience stands, an Lizi was about to die from anger.”

“”What’s wrong with these people? It was clearly that vice-president Liu who deliberately picked a fight. Now, they actually think that it’s Zao Zao’s fault! Is there something wrong with these people?””

“Zhao Pingting held an Lizi’s hand. “Lizi, don’t be anxious. I believe that Luohou will definitely have a way to deal with it.””

An Lizi could only show her anger and cheer ye Zao on.

“Hearing the discussions below the stage, ye Zao’s expression did not change. He turned to look at Han Zhen and said in a shallow voice, “President Han, I now suspect that there’s something wrong with your character. I also suspect that you’re having an affair outside and have an illegitimate child.””

“The moment these words were said, the audience exploded.”

No one had expected ye Zhuo to say such a thing.

There was something wrong with his character.

Having an affair.

Illegitimate Child?

This was Han Zhen!

Han Zhen’s character was universally acknowledged in the literary world.

“In front of so many people, Han Zhen’s expression immediately changed. He said angrily, “You have no existence! You’re insulting my character! You have to apologize to me immediately!””

Arrogant!

Ye Zhuo was simply too arrogant.

“Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “Since President Han knows that something is created out of nothing, I can rest assured that you are insulting my personality.””

Han Zhen frowned. He did not understand the meaning of ye Zhuo’s words.

“Just as Han Zhen was still unable to react.., ye Zhuo continued, “President Han, you only saw that I created something out of nothing and insulted your personality. “Then why can’t you see that vice-president Liu accused me of cheating without any evidence? When I impersonated him, I also created something out of nothing and insulted my personality? “President Han immediately thought of asking me to apologize to you. Why didn’t he think of asking vice-president Liu to apologize to me for his words and actions?””

“At this point, Ye Zhuo paused. “Is it because the person vice-president Liu is blaming isn’t you? Because it’s not you, you can stand on the moral high ground and carelessly persuade others to forgive you?””

The moment these words were said.

Han Zhen was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo’s words were logical and well-grounded, making it impossible for her to refute them.”

Han Zhen had never thought that ye Zhuo would say such a thing.
