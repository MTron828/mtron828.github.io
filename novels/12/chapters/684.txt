He got first place in the Tech Conference?

F * ck!

How could a small Internet celebrity be so powerful?

They thought that Lu Xiu had met ye Zao on the live broadcast platform.

They didn’t expect ye Zao’s background to be so powerful!

A big shot in the tech industry!

“Everyone looked at ye Zao with contempt, disdain, shock, and disbelief!”

He ziteng was also stunned. He originally thought that ye Zao was only very good at racing cars. He did not expect that Ye Zao was also an invincible existence in the technology industry!

“He ziteng looked at Ye Zao and gulped. “God, how many other identities do you have that I don’t Know?””

Ye Zao smiled. “There are so many that I can’t even remember clearly.”

“Really?”He ziteng was a little in disbelief.

Just the position of Technology Guru was a peak that ordinary people could not reach.

Ye Zao could have achievements in other fields?

“It shouldn’t be possible, right?”

“Ye Zao said with a serious expression, “Of course it’s true!””

“Hearing this, a look of disdain flashed across Cen Yuyan’s eyes.”

This ye Zao was really good at pretending!

Wasn’t it just having some achievements in the technology industry?

What was so great about it?

Did Ye Zao really think that she was all-rounder?

She was too vain!

Why did Cen Shaoqing fall for her?

“Cen Yuyan bit her lip tightly, feeling very indignant.”

“When she thought of Lu Xiu again, Cen Yuyan felt even more indignant.”

Why did a man like Lu Xiu look at ye Zao like a little fan looking at his idol?

When song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan.

“Cen Yuyan glanced at song Chenyu and her expression returned to normal. She smiled at Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zao. “Shaoqing, take Zao and sit here.””

“We can sit here.”Cen Shaoqing took ye Zao and sat on the sofa at the side.

“Cen Yuyan’s expression did not change, but she did not feel good in her heart.”

Ever since Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao got together.

Cen Shaoqing did not have a sister like her in his eyes anymore.

“Although Cen Shaoqing had a cold personality in the past, he had never been so disrespectful to her in front of so many people.”

“After Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao sat down, everyone originally wanted to bring up the topic of these two people.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“However, the auras of these two people were really too strong. They did not dare to casually say anything, so they could only bring up the topic of Song Chenyu.”

“”Miss song, I see that the bracelet on your hand is a limited edition of HT family, right?””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yes, it is.””

“Upon hearing this, some sharp-eyed people immediately noticed, “This is the new design by Master Gui Chen, right?””

“Song Chenyu said with some surprise, “Miss Li saw through it. This is indeed Master Gui Chen’s new winter product.””

Master Gui Chen was the chief designer of HT Jewelry.

It was hard to see his head and tail.

“Miss Li continued, “Master Gui Chen’s new product is not easy to buy. I’ve been waiting in line for three months, and their customer service still keeps me waiting! It’s still miss song who has a wide network.””

“The rarer the item, the more expensive it was. It was precisely because Master Gui Chen’s bracelet was not easy to buy, that owning a bracelet designed by Master Gui Chen had become the pursuit of all the socialites!”

“Upon hearing this, Ye Zhuo also looked in song Chenyu’s direction.”

His gaze was indifferent.

She originally thought that she had misheard.

She did not expect that the bracelet on song Chenyu’s hand was really the design that she had submitted not too long ago.

“Seeing that ye Zhuo was looking in her direction, a faint light flashed in song Chenyu’s eyes. She continued, “I have some relations with HT’s director nine miles.””

Which woman didn’t like jewelry?

“Moreover, it was designed by Master Gui Chen.”

It seemed that even ye Zao was no exception.

“Hearing that song Chenyu and HT’s director Jiuli knew each other, Miss Li was both surprised and envious. “When you have time, Miss Song, you must introduce director Jiuli to me.””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Sure, no problem.””

“After everyone chatted for a while, he ziteng stood up and said, “The preparations downstairs are almost done. Shall we go downstairs and have a barbecue?””

“Sure!”

The group of people went downstairs noisily.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walked at the back. The two of them talked in a low voice as they walked.

Lu Xiu wanted to take advantage of this moment to chat with Ye Zhuo.

“After all, it was not easy for him to meet his father once.”

“Unfortunately, with Cen Shaoqing by Ye Zao’s side, he simply couldn’t find a chance to interact with ye Zao alone.”

“Downstairs, the He family’s butler had already set up the self-service barbecue stove.”

“The weather today wasn’t bad, and the sun was warm. Under such weather, barbecuing while basking in the sun was the most suitable.”

“Cen Yuyan pulled song Chenyu’s hand and walked over. “Shaoqing, Zao Zao, why don’t the four of us roast together? Chenyu’s cooking is really good! She’ll definitely let the two of you have a feast.””
