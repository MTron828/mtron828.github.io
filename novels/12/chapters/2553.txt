“Liu Meilian held her hand and comforted her, “Weiwei, don’t be afraid. Your father and I will accompany you in the operating room. We will walk through this hurdle together. As long as we pass this hurdle, everything will be fine!” ”

“Xiang Chao immediately said, “Your mother is right. Weiwei, you must not be afraid. Your parents are with you. You will be fine. We will accompany you through this hurdle.” ”

“Weiwei nodded and looked out the window. She was looking forward to the days to come. She held her parents’hands and said, “Dad, Mom, I’m not afraid.” ”

“Good child.”

8:30 am.

Weiwei was pushed into the operating theater.

“Xiang Chao and Liu Meilian also put on their isolation suits and entered the operating theater together. At the same time, a few cameras were also pushed into the operating theater. ”

Everything seemed to be extremely tense.

Wang Dajun made a simple self-introduction in front of the cameras before he began the surgery in an orderly manner.

“Because this surgery involved Miracle Doctor Ye, it attracted a lot of people’s attention. ”

Even many people came to the international website.

It was extremely popular!

[ who is this person? He seems to be very corrupt! ]

“[ if you’ve studied before, you can do the same. ] ”

[ can this person really be compared to Miracle Doctor Ye? ]

[ I’m afraid not! ]

“[ you can’t judge a book by its cover. How should I put it? Actually, I think this doctor is right about one thing. You Can’t look down on anyone at any time. If no one trusted miracle doctor ye back then, then the cancer wouldn’t have been cured. ] ”

“[ in any case, Miracle Doctor Ye and his diagnosis were two completely different outcomes. Moreover, Miracle Doctor Ye also said that during the surgery, there would definitely be a drop in heart rate and non-stop bleeding. Let’s just watch! ] ”

[ why do we have to code it? We can’t even see it clearly! ]

“”Hemostatic forceps, gauze...” ”

The nurse handed everything to Wang Dajun one by one.

“Wang Dajun responded carefully. He did not feel the slightest bit nervous because from the beginning until now, the surgery had been very smooth. There was not the slightest error, and there was also no situation where the surname Lu was dropping and the blood loss did not stop. ”

What did this mean?

This meant that ye Zhuo’s deduction was completely wrong.

“Thinking that the entire process of the surgery was broadcasted live, Wang Dajun was extremely excited. He was finally going to be famous throughout the world! ”

[ F * ck! F * ck! The surgery actually succeeded. ]

“-LSB- docWangwang, YYDS! ] ”

[ I’m dying of laughter. Why aren’t those people who support Miracle Doctor Ye coming out? ]

[ what’s the situation? ]

Beep! Beep! Beep!

“At this moment, the operating theater that was originally so quiet that only the sound of breathing could be heard suddenly sounded the alarm of the monitor! ”

It was extremely urgent.

“When he looked at the ECG monitor again, the patient’s heartbeat was decreasing in a straight line! ”

It was especially terrifying!

“The atmosphere in the operating theater instantly changed. “Doctor Wang, it’s bad. The patient’s wound is bleeding non-stop!” ”

“”Doctor Wang, the patient’s blood pressure is dropping!” ”

“”Doctor Wang, the patient’s heart rate is dropping rapidly!” ”

“Doctor Wang...”

“Wang Dajun stood there, stunned for a few seconds. His mind was filled with what to do. ”

How could this be?

The surgery had clearly been very successful!

How could such a situation still happen?

“The assistant doctor’s voice became more and more urgent. “Doctor Wang, the patient’s pupils are beginning to dilate!” ”

Dilated pupils!

Any doctor knew what dilated pupils meant. Wang da Jun instantly reacted. “Prepare for defibrillation!”

“Okay!”The assistant doctor immediately prepared defibrillation equipment.

“Liu Meilian and Xiang Chao, who were by the side, were anxious to death when they saw this situation. ”

What should they do?

“If Weiwei died just like that, wouldn’t their acting for the past few days be in vain? ”

“They had already checked the bottom line. The current Weiwei did not have much money. At most, she had saved 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Compared to 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, of course, the long-term meal ticket was more fragrant. ”

“”Dr. Wang, Will Weiwei be okay?” ”

The originally harmonious ward instantly turned into a mess.

The bullet screen was also very interesting. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

[ oh my God! Miracle Doctor Ye really hit the nail on the head! ]

[ terrifying! ]

“[ as expected, Miracle Doctor Ye is still you, Miracle Doctor Ye. ] ”

“[ I heard that the patient is still a young girl in her teens. It’s such a pity. If she had supported Miracle Doctor Ye, she would still be alive! Now... ] ”

“[ the two people on the side are her parents, right? At this time, they are actually concerned about whether the young girl has made a will or not? They are really presumptuous parents! ] ”

“[ it seems that the young girl is a very powerful person. At such a young age, her parents are already concerned about her inheritance! ] ”

[ the young girl is also pitiful! ]
