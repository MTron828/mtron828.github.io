Now was the crucial moment when the Shunxi Financial Group was running for the position of first chair.

Han Laoshan could guess the reason why Zhao Xueyin was looking for him.

Han Laoshan took a sip of tea and looked up at Zhao Xueyin. His tone was a little calm. “Your Big Brother Han is doing well.”

Doing Well?

“Based on Han Dongliang’s current situation, how could everything be fine. ”

“Zhao Xue smiled and said, “Uncle Han, actually, I came here today because I have something to tell you.” ”

“Tell me.”

Zhao Xue Yin put down the cup. “I have a way to treat brother Hang’s illness.”

“”You?”Han Lao Shan looked up at Zhao Xue Yin, his eyes full of scrutiny. ”

“Zhao Xue Yin was not a doctor, how could she possibly cure Han Dongliang? ”

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded confidently.

“Han Laoshan continued, “What can you do?” ”

“”Uncle Han, you should have heard of my grandfather, right?”Zhao Xueyin asked. ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s grandfather’s surname was Ma, and his name was MA youcai. ”

Ma youcai had two daughters.

“One of the daughters was Zhao Xueyin’s mother, and the other daughter had married into the Zhou family. ”

“Back then, MA youcai was known as Hua Tuo because of his superb medical skills. ”

Unfortunately.

“The Ma family’s medical skills were only passed down to men, not to women. ”

“Although Ma Jiayue had learned some superficial things from Ma youcai, she had not learned the true essence. ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s mother had left early again, so the MA family had declined. ”

“Although MA youcai was Zhao Xueyin’s grandfather, MA youcai was no longer around. ”

What could Zhao Xueyin Do?

“When Ma youcai had left, Zhao Xueyin had not been born yet, so it was impossible to say that Zhao Xueyin had inherited ma youcai’s medical skills. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Han Laoshan narrowed his eyes and smiled. “Of course I know about Miracle Doctor Ma.”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Everyone knows that my grandfather was known as the world’s huatuo, but very few people know that before he passed away, he left us a life-saving pill. This pill can cure the illness. Once Big Brother Han eats it, he will return to normal.” ”

These words were a little too exaggerated.

Han Laoshan looked up at Zhao Xueyin. “What Pill is so magical? Could it be an immortal pill?”

“”It can’t be called an immortal pill.”Zhao xueyin paused before continuing, “Uncle Han, have you heard of the An Gong Bezoar Pill?” ”

The An Gong bezoar pill was the most famous emergency medicine for traditional Chinese medicine in China!

“Traditional Chinese medicine called the An Gong Bezoar Pill, the Purple Snow Pill, and the supreme treasure pill the “Three Treasures of cooling.”The An Gong bezoar pill was the top of the “Three Treasures”and was famous overseas. ”

“Among them, the older an gong Niuhuang Wan was, the better its effect was. ”

“During the period when his son was sick, many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners mentioned an gong Niuhuang Wan in front of Han Laoshan. However, because of its good effect and the fact that the older it was, the better its effect was, it was basically out of stock in the country. ”

“It had been bought back at a high price by the rich to save their lives. Currently, it was an existence that had a price but no market. ”

Ma youcai was a godly doctor to begin with. The bezoar pill that he had left behind was definitely the best of the best.

“When he heard this, Han Laoshan seemed to have grabbed onto a life-saving straw. “Xueyin, do you really have your bezoar pill?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Uncle Han, do you think I would use such a life-threatening matter to deceive you?” ”

“Han Laoshan continued, “Xueyin, then thank you! Your Big Brother Han and I will remember your kindness for the rest of our lives! How much does this bezoar pill cost? I will immediately arrange for someone to transfer the money to you!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Han Laoshan and asked in return, “Uncle Han, do you think that I came here today for money?” ”

“At this point, Zhao Xueyin paused and continued, “Or does uncle Han think that this life-saving thing can be measured by money?” ”

Han Laoshan was stunned.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “The day to run for the chief seat is coming soon. I hope that Uncle Han can support me more and help me ascend to the chief seat.” ”

“Although he had already guessed Zhao Xueyin’s intentions, Han Laoshan was still a little surprised that Zhao Xueyin had voiced out her thoughts. ”

He was also a little troubled.

He had already discussed with the shareholders that all of them would vote for ye Zhuo for the chief election this time.

This was because only ye Zhuo could lead the Shunxi Financial Group to a new peak.

“Compared to Ye Zhuo, Zhao Xueyin was not just a little inferior. ”

“Of course, Zhao Xueyin had been acting as the first seat for so long, but the Shunxi Financial Group hadn’t improved at all. On the contrary, it was gradually going downhill. ”

“Ye Zao had only joined the Shunxi Financial Group for less than three months, but he had already made the Shunxi Financial Group on the right track. From this, it could be seen that ye Zao was the best candidate to be the first seat of the Shunxi Financial Group! ”

“If the Shunxi Financial Group was really handed over to Zhao Xueyin, then the Shunxi Financial Group really couldn’t see the future. ”
