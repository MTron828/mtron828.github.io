A person could do anything on impulse. The Butler was also afraid that Father Zhao would do something he would regret.

“Speaking up to this point, the Butler lowered his voice and continued, “Master, even if you don’t want anything else, you should consider for the young master!” ”

“Hearing the words ‘Young Master’, Father Zhao calmed down a little. ”

“The butler heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “No matter what, the young miss is the young master’s younger sister. I think that if the young master were to return, he would definitely not want to see your relationship with the young miss become so strained!” ”

Father Zhao gradually calmed down.

“The Butler let go of Father Zhao and continued, “Master, it’s getting late. You should quickly go and rest. You still have to wake up early tomorrow morning.” ”

Why would he wake up early tomorrow morning?

“To find his son, of course. ”

“To Father Zhao, nothing was more important than finding his son. ”

“Father Zhao kicked the door and said angrily, ”

“”I want to see if you can hide in your room for the rest of Your Life!”After saying this, Father Zhao turned around and went downstairs. ”

“Seeing Father Zhao go downstairs, the butler let out a sigh of relief. He looked at the door and said, “Miss, master is already so old, and you have already made him angry.” ”

“Inside, Zhao Xueyin did not reply. ”

...

The next day.

“Early in the morning, Father Zhao woke up. ”

“The Butler walked in and said, “Master, the things are all packed. Shall we set off now?” ”

“”Where’s that evil daughter?”Father Zhao asked, gritting his teeth. ”

“”Well, she doesn’t seem to have woken up yet.” ”

“B * Stard!”Father Zhao slammed the table and stood up. “I don’t know how she slept!”

“”Master, please calm down. It doesn’t look good to be angry so early in the morning. We still have to look for young master!” ”

“Hearing this, the anger on father Zhao’s face dissipated a little. ”

He no longer counted on Zhao Xueyin!

It was better to count on a dog than Zhao Xueyin!

“To be able to play a good hand like this, he saw that Zhao Xueyin would be like this for the rest of her life. ”

Father Zhao stood up from the stool. “Let’s go now.”

The Butler immediately followed Father Zhao’s footsteps. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“After two hours of driving, the luxurious Maybach stopped in front of a large company. ”

“Although it was a large company, compared to the financial world’s consortia, it was still a little lacking. ”

Father Zhao got out of the car. “This is my son’s company?”

“Yes.”The butler nodded. “Young master is currently the boss of this company.”

“Father Zhao looked up at the sign on the side, “Express delivery company?” ”

“”Yes.”The butler continued, “Master, your current identity is as an exporter. You need to go through the young master’s company to transport the goods out.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, the Butler looked at his watch and continued, “Master, the appointment time with the young master has arrived.” ”

“Got it.”Father Zhao lifted his foot and walked inside.

The Butler followed behind Father Zhao.

“Just as they entered, the customer service at the front desk asked, “Do you have an appointment?” ”

“The Butler stood out and said, “We are from ocean shipping company. This is our CEO Zhao.” ”

“Hearing this, the smile on the front desk lady’s face became even more cordial. “CEO Zhao, please follow me.” ”

They arrived at the eighth floor.

The front desk lady knocked on the door. “CEO Ye.”

“Come in.”A man’s mellow voice came from inside.

“The receptionist pushed the door open. “President Ye, this is President Zhao from the ocean shipping company.” ”

“As soon as she said this, the man sitting behind the desk immediately stood up. “President Zhao, I’ve heard a lot about you! I’m the person in charge of Chengfeng Express delivery, Ye Zhaomu.” ”

“Ye Zhaomu looked about thirty-five or thirty-six years old. She was about 1.8 meters tall, with handsome features and a dignified appearance. ”

“Father Zhao nodded and sized up ye Zhaomu without batting an eyelid. “President Ye, you’re really young and promising.” ”

It was his son.

This must be his son.

“Look at his eyes and nose, how handsome he was. ”

“The more father Zhao thought about it, the more excited he became. ”

“”You must be joking.”Ye Zhaomu continued, “President Zhao, please take a seat.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhaomu instructed her secretary to pour some tea. ”

“Soon, the secretary came over with two cups of tea. ”

“Father Zhao took the tea and took a sip before continuing, “I heard that President Ye’s old home is in Yun Capital?” ”

Ye Zhaomu nodded. “Yes.”

“Father Zhao continued, “My deceased wife is also from Yun capital. Yun capital is a good place for outstanding people. If there’s a chance, I must go to Yun capital to take a look in my lifetime.” ”

Late Wife?

“Ye Zhaomu could not reply and could only say, “Yun Jing is indeed a good place. The tourism industry has been very good these two years. If you want to go back and take a look, you can look for me as a guide.” ”

“Okay!”Father Zhao nodded. “Then it’s a deal!”
