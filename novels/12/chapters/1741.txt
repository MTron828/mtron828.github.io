Jamila shook her head. “Nothing much. Feng Qi’s mother is even more stubborn than I imagined!”

“She’s just an old lady. Is she that hard to deal with?”Tina frowned.

“After saying that, Tina continued, “She refused to go back with us?” ”

“Yes.”Jamila nodded.

“Why?”Tina asked.

“Jamila continued, “Not only did she refuse to go back with us, she also refused our pension and didn’t ask about Feng Qi’s funeral. “In short, she doesn’t act like a mother who lost her child!”Jamila had never seen such a calm mother. ”

“Hearing that, Tina was also stunned. ”

“Under normal circumstances, when such a thing happened, the family members would only complain that the pension was not enough. ”

She had never seen a family member who refused to go to country C to live in peace and also refused the astronomical pension.

Also.

“Feng Qi was the old lady’s biological daughter after all, but the old lady was so calm! ”

Wasn’t there a saying in China that the dead were the most important?

Did she not think about the mother-daughter relationship in the past at all?

“After thinking for a while, Tina continued, “Chinese people are greedy by nature. Does Feng Qi’s mother complain that the money is too little?” ”

“”I don’t think so.”Jamila shook her head. “She never mentioned how much the pension is from the beginning to the end, let alone opening the envelope. If it’s really about the pension, she could have just raised it directly. There’s no need to do this.” ”

“Tina frowned and asked, “Then what should we do now? Dr. Cara has repeatedly told us that we must figure out the matter of the National Treasures of the Song dynasty. If we don’t gain anything from this trip, how are we going to explain it when we go back?” ”

“I don’t know either.”Camilla lit a cigarette. “This matter is more troublesome than we imagined.”

“Before coming here, Camilla had already planned everything. ”

“This trip, she would bring the old lady back to C country and then make a cenotaph for Feng Qi. ”

“In China, funerary objects were very important. He originally wanted to take advantage of the old lady’s longing for Feng Qi and propose to take out the national treasure of the Song dynasty as a funerary object for Feng Qi. ”

Who knew that the old lady would directly reject him!

“”I have an idea,”Tina said immediately. ”

“What Idea?”Asked Jamila.

“Tina continued, “We can let Feng Ying Do the old lady’s work. Feng Ying is the old lady’s only granddaughter. After a hundred years, Feng Ying will be the legal heir. Other than giving those things to Feng Ying, who else can we give them to?” ”

“Hearing that, Camilla narrowed her eyes. “We can try that.” ”

“Feng Qi was the only person who had been expelled from China. Feng Ying had not been expelled, so she could still enter and leave China freely. ”

“Tina continued, “Then I’ll go back to China immediately and bring Feng Ying here.” ”

“Okay.”Camilla nodded. “I’ll think of a way to invite Gu si out. Let me know when you guys arrive.”

“Apart from the National Treasures of the Song dynasty, they had to successfully convince Gu si during this trip to China. ”

They hoped that everything would go smoothly on Gu Si’s side and that they would not run into any obstacles again.

“Okay.”

...

Cen’s base.

“Gu Si was one of professor Feng’s proudest disciples. In the past, she and Liu Yuan were considered as a pair of talents. The two of them had completed many famous experiments behind Professor Feng. ”

“Before this, Gu Si was also very interested in Europa. She had almost followed professor Feng to C country. ”

“Fortunately, she had stopped at the precipice in time. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“If she had really followed professor Feng to C country, then she would be the one who died in a foreign land! ”

Gu Si was terrified when she didn’t think about this.

She still had a big family counting on her!

“”Worker Gu.”At this moment, the assistant’s voice sounded in the air. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Gu Si turned around.

“The assistant continued, “Section B’s leader Fang is looking for you.” ”

Section B?

Leader Fang?

Was she familiar with this person?

“Gu Si hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Alright, I’ll be there right away.” ”

The assistant took the rubber gloves that Gu si handed over.

“When she arrived outside the laboratory, she saw team leader Fang waiting for her outside. ”

Team leader Fang was 35 years old this year. He was an elderly youth with a simple and honest appearance. He was a native of Beijing.

“After she composed her expression, Gu si walked over. “Team leader Fang, You’re looking for me.” ”

“Worker Gu.”Team leader Fang smiled and raised his head.

“Why is team leader Fang looking for me?”Gu Si continued to ask.

“Leader Fang held a stack of documents in his hand. “Gu, I have an analysis report here. No matter how you look at it, it doesn’t seem right. Could you please help me check it?” ”
