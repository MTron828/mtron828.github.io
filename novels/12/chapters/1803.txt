“Old Mrs. Cen might be old, but her thoughts were at the forefront of the fashion industry! ”

She read all kinds of beautiful novels one after another.

“After saying that, an excited look appeared in old Mrs. Cen’s eyes. “I have never seen gay people in real life!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen had always been very interested in this group. Unfortunately, there had never been such people around her, so she did not know much about them. ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng was very speechless and said, “Grandma Cen, what are you talking about! I’m very normal! I’m not gay!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Ziteng, don’t worry. Your Grandma Cen is definitely not that kind of feudal person. If you are really gay, grandma CEN will definitely not discriminate against you! On the contrary, Grandma Cen will even bless you!” ”

“I really am not!”He ziteng said.

“Really not?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“Really not!”He ziteng was very serious.

“Seeing him like this, the excited expression on old Mrs. Cen’s face instantly disappeared. She continued, “Since you’re not, isn’t Xiao Chen pretty good? Why Don’t you agree?” ”

“She’s not my type.”

“Old Mrs. he said with a confused look, “What are you guys talking about? What gay and straight? Why Can’t I understand a single word?”She was different from old Mrs. Cen, old Mrs. He’s life was relatively simple. Apart from walking the dog every day, she played mahjong. She was not very interested in Wang Nuo. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Saying something that can change your worldview! The most important thing now is Xiao Chen. Ziteng, are you really unwilling to meet Xiao Chen?” ”

“Not every old lady was like her, closely following the fashion trends. Old Mrs. He was a traditional old lady. If she knew that there was still a same-sex marriage, she would probably be shocked to death! ”

“I’m not meeting her!”He ziteng directly refused. “There’s no need for me to meet her.”

“Hearing this, old Mrs. he frowned and said, “Isn’t That Lady from the Ouyang family quite good? It’s your fortune that she likes you, and you even picked up Qiao!” ”

“”Grandma, don’t Worry About Me!” ”

“Old lady he said, “I’m your grandma, who would worry if I’m not worried!”The He family’s parents were especially busy. They flew all over the world every day and did not care about he ziteng. He ziteng himself was not in a hurry, old Lady he was extremely anxious now! She was already so old, what if she could not carry a great-grandson? ”

“”I’ll tell you the truth! I already have someone I like,”he ziteng continued, “If things go well, I should be able to bring her back to see you in half a year.” ”

“Really?”Old Mrs. He’s eyes lit up.

“He ziteng nodded, “Of course it’s true. Why would I lie to you with this?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously, “Which family’s girl? Is Xiao Chen Outstanding? Xiao Chen is a good girl that’s one in a thousand.” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “As for which family’s lady, I’ll keep it a secret first! In short, my taste isn’t too bad, don’t worry.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Whether she’s a good lady or not, we’ll only know after we get along with her! Don’t be like the Mu Family!”After experiencing the MU family’s incident, Old Mrs. Cen no longer trusted people easily! ”

“Back then, their relationship with the Mu family was so good. When the MU family found out about the fake news of the Cen family’s bankruptcy, they immediately cut off their relationship with the Cen family! It could be seen how sinister people were! ”

“Hearing this, old lady he nodded. “Your Grandma Cen is right. Since you’ve decided to get along with them, you must get a clear understanding of their character! You Can’t bring those indecent people back!” ”

“”Grandma, Grandma Cen, do I look like an idiot to you?”He ziteng looked at the two elders and asked. ”

Old Mrs. Cen shook her head. “No.”

He ziteng smiled.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You look very much like the silly son of a landlord.” ”

He ziteng’s smile immediately froze.

“”So, ziteng, you must be careful.”Old Mrs. Cen patted he ziteng’s shoulder. “Don’t be fooled by those people! Although there are many good people in this world, there are also bad people!” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He ziteng nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You’d better tell me and your grandmother the name of that little girl. That way, your grandmother and I can help you to test her character.” ”

“He ziteng frowned slightly and continued, “Grandmother Cen, I think this kind of behavior is wrong, and it’s an insult to people! I believe her.” ”

It could be seen from her face that Xu Xiao was a good girl.
