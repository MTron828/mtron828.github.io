“Goodbye.”

The few of them waved at the miniature ye Han.

“After saying goodbye, ye Han closed the door of the interstellar shuttle and activated the button. ”

“The interstellar shuttle instantly shrunk and finally disappeared into the air, soaring in the quantum world. ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Lin Ze. “Brother, I have something to tell you.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said slowly, “I’ll go get some snacks for the both of you. You can chat while you eat.” ”

“Although he said that he was going to get snacks, he actually wanted to leave both time and space for the siblings. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Okay.”

“Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked out, closing the door. ”

Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze came to the office.

The two of them sat opposite each other.

“Ye Zhuo poured a cup of tea for Lin Ze. “Brother, this story might be a little long.” ”

“Lin Ze raised his eyes slightly. “It’s Alright, I’m not busy in the afternoon.” ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up his cup and sipped his tea, then, he said, “Brother, I think you should have guessed it. I’m not the Real Ye Zhuo. “I’m not from Earth either. Ye Han and I come from the s galaxy outside the Milky Way. The country I grew up in is called Changyue Country... “An accident caused me to die in an experiment. When I woke up, I became Ye Zhuo “... “You saw what happened next.” ”

“Ye Zao spoke calmly, and so did Lin Ze. ”

“A moment later, he continued, “Zao Zao, no matter what happened, where you came from, who you are, in my heart, you will always be my only biological sister. I will always be your brother!” ”

“”Brother, thank you.” ”

“Lin Ze patted her head like he was patting a big cat. “What are you talking about? We are all family. Oh right, are Ye Han and you biological siblings?” ”

“”No.”Ye Zao shook his head. “When I met Ye Han, he was only ten years old. From then on, we called each other brother and sister. Ye Han is a very responsible younger brother.” Ye Zao was very relieved to leave the Changyue kingdom to him. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Then do you have any other relatives in the Changyue Kingdom?” ”

“No.”Ye Zao said.

“Then you...”

“Ye Zao’s expression was the same as usual. He smiled and said, “I was an orphan since I was young. But I’m not anymore.”She had parents, an older brother, and a bunch of people she loved, as well as people who loved her. ”

“Zao Zao.”Lin Ze looked at ye Zao.

He wanted to ask her if she had been through a lot during that period of time.

But he could not say a word.

His eyes were a little sour.

“”Brother, that’s all in the past.”Ye Zao smiled. “I’m very satisfied now, really.” ”

“She had never thought that one day, she would be able to live in such a happy family. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lin Ze stood up and hugged ye Zao.

“”Zao Zao, you’ll have us in the future.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“The atmosphere turned from relaxed to heavy, then from heavy to relaxed. Ye Zao continued, “Brother, do you want to go to the s galaxy to take a look?” ”

“I do.”Lin Ze nodded.

He wanted to see what the place where ye Zao grew up looked like.

He also wanted to see what kind of environment could create such a girl.

“”If there’s a chance, I’ll definitely bring you there to take a look,”ye Zao said. ”

“”Yes,”Lin ze continued, “By the way, how long will it take for the interstellar shuttle to reach the s Galaxy?” ”

“”It used to be about three days,”ye Zao continued, “But now it only takes two days.” ”

“After returning to the country of changyue, ye Zao had changed the equipment of the shuttle. ”

He had also used the resources in the S Galaxy to split the entire plain jade into five pieces.

“Although ye Han had returned with the shuttle, Ye Zao still had four permanent energy sources. As long as she wanted to, she could go back at any time. ”

“However, she was now a Zen master in the country of Changyue. In addition, the Manxing country was uncomfortable, so ye Zao did not really want to go back. ”

“Lin Ze nodded. “Right, Zao Zao, I want to study the interstellar shuttle.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao took off the bracelet on his wrist and gave it to him. “This is the controller. Press this and your body will shrink.”

The interstellar shuttle looked like it was only the size of a toy car. It had to shrink before it could be controlled to enter the quantum world.

Lin Ze took the controller and went to the second interstellar shuttle.

Ye Zao told Lin Ze some things to take note of.

“After Lin Ze heard them all, he activated the controller. ”

In the next second.

“He felt his body shrink in an instant. Everything around him became huge, even if it was just an ordinary mosquito. ”

“Lin Ze followed the steps ye Zao told him and opened the door of the interstellar shuttle. Then, he jumped in. ”
