“Chapter 375: 113: face-smacking scene, burning to destroy the system! 7”

Translator: 549690339

What the hell is going on?

Where did the system go?

“Without the system, she knew nothing about technology. ”

“Without the system, how could she crush ye Zao? ”

What should she do now?

“Mu Yourong looked at the high-tech equipment in front of her, and her forehead broke out in cold sweat. ”

“”System, come back quickly!” ”

“Ye Zhuo glanced at Mu Yourong, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly. ”

Mu Yourong was also bold.

“Even when she could not find the system, she still dared to force herself to go onstage. ”

“Compared to Mu Yourong’s nervousness, ye Zhuo could be said to be extremely calm. ”

“He placed his phone on the table, turned on the computer, and began to handle the tasks. His hands clattered on the keyboard. ”

“His snow-white jade-like hands were facing the cold and hard keyboard, forming a beautiful scenery. ”

There were five tasks in total.

All of them were SSS grade.

The task usually took two hours.

“After 15 minutes, Ye Zhuo finished the first task. ”

“After 30 minutes, Ye Zhuo finished the third task. ”

“After 50 minutes, Ye Zhuo successfully completed the fifth task. ”

He clicked submit.

“The participants from different countries could not see the process of the competition, but the people on the forum could. ”

“Seeing that ye Zao completed all the missions in less than an hour, the forum completely fell into chaos. ”

[ F * ck! F * ck! Dad Is Awesome! ]

“[ Ahhhh! I Cry Bird! This year, it’s finally our China’s turn to be Number One! ] ”

[ Dad won glory for our country! ]

[ I’m so excited! ]

“-LSB- those who mocked dad for being a team dog, come oAcceptcept the face xr,@small building misty rain 69,@i miss you so much, 0636, and 1,000 others! ] ”

[ Ah Ah Ah! Dad is really awesome! ]

[ dad will always be dad! ]

“[ oh my God! Dad is probably the first person in history to complete all the missions within an hour, right? ] ”

“[ you are right! Last year, the three people from country P who claimed to be Giants only completed three missions in two hours! ] ”

[ I remember that the highest record was three missions! ]

[ dad broke the record! ]

“[ look at that Yr. What’s going on? Everyone else is doing missions, but she hasn’t moved at all? Don’t tell me she doesn’t understand? ] ”

[ maybe she really doesn’t understand! ]

[ F * ck! So the real cheater is Yr! ]

“[ YR, get out of the tech world! Shame on our Niu Hulu family! Disgusting! ] ”

“[ look at Yr’s clothes. Look at how capable and handsome our father is dressed! ]! [ look at Yr. She’s wearing a gown and fake eyelashes. She doesn’t look like she’s here for the Tech Convention! ]! I think she’s here for the gala, right? ] ”

“For a moment, everyone was cursing Mu Yourong for getting out of the tech world. ”

Ye Zhuo could not see the situation on the forum.

“After completing the mission, she sat on her seat and played with her phone. ”

“However, because her phone was not connected to the internet, she could only play Tetris. ”

The way she played with her phone was all seen by the three people from Country P.

She played on her phone when others were doing missions?

China was really down and out!

No wonder they had always crushed her. She could only be the fourth in a million years.

No one knew how this kind of person got into the world of science and technology.

“Seeing ye Zao playing on his phone, Mu Yourong also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It turned out that she was not the only one who knew nothing about scientific research.

Ye Zao also placed her at the bottom.

Very soon.

Two hours passed.

“The contestants from different countries stood in their respective positions, waiting for the host to announce the results. ”

“The host was from Country L, and he held a piece of paper in his hand. “This year’s competition has brought in a lot of new blood. I now announce the top three winners of the competition.” ”

As soon as he finished speaking.

Deafening applause rang out from below the stage.

“The third place goes to Dr. Charlie from country P!”

This result was within everyone’s expectations. It was also within Charlie’s expectations.

Charlie bowed to everyone.

“The second place goes to Dr. Barney from country P!”

This result was also within everyone’s expectations.

“”Next, it’s the first place that everyone has their eyes on. I now announce that the first place winner of this science and Technology Conference is...” ”

“At this point, the host deliberately kept him in suspense and dragged out his words. ”

Carol slowly stood up from her chair and looked at the cameras below the stage and present.

“As someone who had participated in the science and Technology Conference for more than ten years, Carol naturally knew that there were cameras live streaming the event. ”

Needless to say!

The first place winner was definitely him.

“After all, the top three in every year’s competition were all the three of them. ”

Could there be any other tricks up their sleeves this year?

“When the host saw Carol stand up, an awkward expression flashed across his face. However, he had no choice but to continue announcing, “The first place winner is Niu Hulu YC from China!” ”

Niu Hulu YC?

Clap Clap Clap —

The entire stadium erupted in cheers!

Warm applause rose one after another.

Especially Chu Zimo and Zheng Yuanjie. They were so excited that their hands were almost red from clapping.

Dr. Warne’s eyes were red.

“Although he knew that ye Zao would definitely win,. ”

He still couldn’t help but be excited when he saw this scene with his own eyes.

No one could understand this feeling.

Ye Zao stood up from his seat and bowed to express his gratitude.

“At this moment, she was the focus of everyone’s attention. ”

At this moment.

“Carol’s expression completely changed. She couldn’t just stand there, nor could she sit down. ”

She was in an awkward situation! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He was not the first place winner.

How could it not be him?

He had actually lost to a Chinese!

How could he lose?

Mu Yourong looked at Ye Zao.

Her face was full of jealousy.

She should be the one in the limelight!

Where on Earth had the system gone?

“Mu Yourong clenched her fists. Because she had used too much strength, her sharp nails had pierced deeply into her skin, but she was completely unaware of it. ”

Next was the award ceremony.

“The moment the honored guest walked out, Ye Zhuo was stunned. ”

This was Cen Shaoqing?

“He was still wearing that old-fashioned long gown with a string of Buddhist beads on his right hand. There was an air of being able to look down on the world in a scholarly manner, and the Red Mole at the end of his eyes had added a myriad of charms. ”

“This kind of person, no matter where he went, was an existence that stood out from the crowd. ”

The three etiquette girls followed behind him with medals in their hands.

Cen Shaoqing presented the prizes in turn.

“Third place, second place, and then first place. ”

Cen Shaoqing walked in front of ye Zao.

He lowered his head and helped her wear the medal.

The medal was worn on her chest.

Although ye Zao was thin.

“She was not thin in any way, but she was not thin at all. ”

Perhaps no one noticed that Cen Shaoqing’s hands were shaking at this moment.

“After wearing the medal, Cen Shaoqing gently pulled her into his arms. His thin lips seemed to be pressed against her ear, and his breathing was shallow. “Congratulations, Ye Zhuo.” ”
