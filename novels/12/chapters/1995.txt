The sunset on the sea was especially spectacular.

The sunlight dyed the surface of the sea a golden yellow.

Ye Zhuo walked over and laid down on another chair.

“Leader.”Cen Shaoqing turned her eyes slightly and looked at Ye Zhuo.

“En.”Ye Zhuo turned back to look at her.

“”Tell me, why can’t we find any remains on the shipwreck?”Cen Shaoqing continued to speak. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Do you think the captain realized the danger and moved them ahead of time? Coincidentally, after they moved, they encountered pirates again?” ”

“If that was really the case, then it would be easy to explain. ”

“After the island moved all the people on the ship, they manually intervened and sank the ship to the bottom of the sea. ”

“Therefore, no remains could be found in the sunken ship in the trench. ”

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly, “Impossible. After the sunken ship incident, the higher-ups arranged for people to investigate the pirates on the nearby islands. “Moreover, there were more than 1,300 people on the ship at that time. Including the guards and the like, there were close to 1,400 people. If they really encountered pirates, it was impossible to not find any traces of fighting on the ship.” ”

“What kind of pirates could make more than 1,300 people disappear from this world without a sound. ”

It was impossible!

“There was also a high-ranking official of C Nation on the sunken ship. Therefore, after the incident, C Nation joined forces with several other countries of x continent to seal off the surrounding waters. ”

“Do you think that this sunken ship is related to the core mechs that were lurking around me?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo.

“Other than a higher civilization that could make more than 1,300 people disappear out of thin air, CEN Shaoqing could not think of any other reason. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“”It’s hard to say,”ye Zao continued, “If it’s really related to the core robots, then your Cen family must have a big secret.” ”

“Otherwise, the General Alliance would not have sent out the core robots to cause trouble. ”

“First, it was Cen Shaoqing’s father, then it was Cen Shaoqing. ”

“But under normal circumstances, the alliance wouldn’t target any family on Earth. ”

Because there was no need.

“After all, the space civilization in S galaxy was several levels higher than Earth’s. ”

“Furthermore, the alliance had a clause stating that no country or individual in s galaxy could do anything to disturb Earth’s public order. ”

There was no need for the general alliance to slap themselves in the face.

Besides.

The S galaxy was millions of light years away from Earth.

“Although the General Alliance was technologically advanced, it still needed to spend some effort to come to Earth. ”

Big Secret?

What kind of secret did Cen Jiang have that was worth the general alliance of the S Galaxy putting in so much effort?

Cen Shaoqing was also puzzled.

“Ye Zhuo picked up a dry towel from the side of the chair and wiped his hair. “Right, in the past few years, did anything strange happen to your family?” ”

Anything Strange?

“Cen Shaoqing massaged his temples and continued, “If you really want to talk about strange things, there is one.” ”

“”Tell me about it,”ye Zhuo said with interest. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “That is, the men of our Cen family all have short lives.” ”

“At this point, Cen Shaoqing suddenly thought of something. ”

That Was...

Dead without a corpse!

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “My grandfather had an accident while he was doing business overseas. When my grandmother rushed over, he was already cremated. My father was shipwrecked and his body has yet to be found.” ”

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes. “In that case, your grandfather and your father’s deaths have one thing in common.” ”

Accident.

“They were all accidental deaths, and there were no corpses. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“What about your great-grandfather?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Great-grandfather was from the Qing dynasty. I don’t know the exact reason, but I know that he passed away at the age of 32. “Furthermore, I’ve flipped through the family tree. Five generations up, those ancestors all passed away young.” ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

Died Young.

Why did the Cen family die young?

“Did they also die by accident?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Basically, there were all kinds of accidents. Missing, mudslides, earthquakes, they were all missing.”Therefore, many of the Cen family’s ancestors’graves were covered with cenotaph. ”

“In the past, he didn’t pay attention to these details. Now that he thought about it, it was simply terrifying. ”

“If they didn’t die, where did they go? ”

Were they brought to the s galaxy by those core robots?

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo’s brows furrowed deeply. ”

“”If that’s the case, then 80% of the shipwreck accident must be related to those core robots.” ”
