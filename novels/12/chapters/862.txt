“Sure.”

The three of them walked together because they pressed the photo button.

“At this moment, a villager passed by. Yin Wei immediately walked over and said with a smile, “Aunty, wait a moment.””

“What’s the matter?”

“Yin Wei continued, “Aunty, can you help us take a photo?””

“Sure.”The aunty nodded and took the phone that Yin Wei handed over.

Yin Wei immediately ran to the side of the three of them and made a pose.

“The Auntie held the phone. “Three, two, one, cheese.””

A group photo of the four of them was fixed on the screen of the phone.

“After the Auntie took the photo, she walked over with a smile. “Can I take a photo with you guys?””

“Yin Wei said, “Of course.””

The Auntie stood in the middle of the four of them. The staff of the photography team held the Auntie’s phone and took a photo of them.

“After taking the photo, the Aunty left happily”

The four of them also began their fishing plan.

“Not only were there fish in the fish pond, but there were also crayfish. In the evening, they could see crayfish that came to the shore to look for food in the shallow water.”

“Because there were lotus flowers in the fish pond, they needed to row a boat to lower the fishing tools.”

A small wooden boat was parked by the pond.

The few of them jumped onto the boat.

“The director asked, “Which one of you knows how to row a boat? If you don’t know how to row a boat, you can spend 50 yuan to hire a captain to row a boat for you.””

Row a boat?

Wei Xingzhi knew how to sail a yacht.

“However, he didn’t know how to paddle a boat manually.”

“Moreover, if he didn’t control the paddle boat well, it would easily capsize.”

The program team was obviously causing trouble and trying to earn their money.

“”Is 50 yuan so expensive? Isn’t it cheaper?”Wei Xingzhi stood up and said, “How about 25 yuan?””

The director shook his head. “The minimum is 50 yuan.”

Ye Zao smiled and picked up the paddle. “There’s no need to bargain with them. I know how to row.”

“Everyone looked at ye Zao in unison, and their eyes lit up.”

Amazing!

Ye Zao was really too amazing.

“Wei Xingzhi looked at Ye Zao. “Ye, do you really know how to do it?””

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Everyone, take your seats. We’re about to set off.””

Everyone immediately took their seats.

Yin Wei got into the water and raised her head in surprise. “This water is so cold!”

“It was 36 degrees, and the sun was scorching hot. They had thought that the water would definitely be very hot, but they did not expect the water to be so cold.”

“Wei xingzhi said, “There are lotus flowers in the fish pond. The Lotus leaves have a heat resistance effect. If there were no lotus leaves, the water temperature would definitely not be so low.””

“Teacher Wei is right.”Chang Yu agreed.

“Ye Zhuo stood at the bow of the boat. His body was extremely slender, and he was rowing the oars.”

“Yin Wei’s hobby was photography. At this moment, looking at ye Zhuo’s back, she immediately took out her phone and took a few photos in a row.”

Those who knew photography knew a secret.

That was to never take photos with beautiful flowers.

“Because if one was not careful, one’s appearance would be dwarfed by the flowers.”

“But in ye Zao’s case, there was no such problem.”

“Whether it was the beautiful lotus flowers or the blue sky and white clouds behind him, under the contrast of this person, they could only become a dull background.”

The small wooden boat floated and soon disappeared among the endless lotus leaves. The camera crew’s boat immediately followed.

“Soon, they arrived at the center of the fish pond.”

“The lotus flowers here bloomed the most beautifully, and they were also the most suitable for fishing.”

The water in the fish pond was not deep. Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu went into the water and placed the cage on the ground. “The water is too cold. you two girls don’t have to come down. Chang Yu and I will put the cage and net on the ground.”

“Not only was it bad for a girl’s health, but it was also inconvenient for her to go into the water in front of so many cameras. Needless to say, Wei Xingzhi was a very meticulous person.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Teacher Wei, it’s been hard on you and Chang Yu.””

“Yin Wei also said, “It’s been hard on you.””

“It’s not hard. It’s what I should do.”

Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu took the fishing net and walked inside. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ye Zao looked at Yin Wei. “Wei Wei, shall we pick some lotus seeds?””

“Sure.”

“The two of them not only picked a lot of lotus seeds, but also a lot of lotus flowers and leaves.”

“”I’ll put a hat on you too.”Yin Wei picked a lotus leaf and placed it on ye Zao’s head, blocking out the sunlight.”

Ye Zao sniffed it gently. “This lotus leaf smells so good.”

“It does smell good.”Yin Wei nodded.

“Two hours later, Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu returned with a full load of fish nets and cages.”

There were a total of eight fish.

All of them were extremely plump.

The largest fish weighed around seven to eight catties.

“”This fish is so big!”Yin Wei said excitedly, “Teacher Wei, Chang Yu, you guys are really amazing!””
