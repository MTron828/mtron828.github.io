Jin Ruyu?

The person in front of her was Jin Ruyu?

“When she heard this, Zhao Xueyin was stunned. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. She turned to look at Wen Silan and tried her best to calm herself down. “Silan, who did you say he was?” ”

“”Jin Ruyu.”Wen Silan continued, “He’s the eldest young master of the Jin family. He just returned from studying abroad. Isn’t he handsome?” ”

“”He’s Jin Ruyu? Si Lan, are you sure you didn’t recognize him wrongly?”Zhao Xue Yin gulped. ”

He was obviously the lawyer!

How could the poor lawyer who had nothing be Jin Ruyu!

He recognized him wrongly!

Wen Si Lan must have recognized the wrong person!

“If the lawyer was Jin Ruyu, then who was the lawyer? ”

“Wen Si lan smiled and said, “I just attended the Jin family’s banquet not long ago! Don’t worry, I won’t recognize him wrongly. He’s Jin Ruyu! I’m not a three-year-old child, how can I recognize the wrong person! I Won’t Be Wrong!” ”

“At this moment, the man walked over step by step. ”

“Wen Si lan said excitedly, “Oh my god! He’s walking over here! Xueyin, look quickly!” ”

Zhao Xueyin raised her head slightly and saw Si lui walking over with deep affection.

The others present also looked over.

“Wen Si Lan said in a low voice, “Xueyin, do you think he’s here to greet us?” ”

There was an unconcealable excitement in his words.

The Wen family could only be considered average in the financial world.

“At this moment, when Wen Si Lan saw si lui walking over, other than excitement, she was also in disbelief. ”

“When she heard this, a mocking light flashed across Zhao Xue Yin’s eyes? ”

“US?”

“Si Lui was clearly here to greet her, what did he have to do with Wen Si Lan? ”

This Wen Si Lan really knew how to flatter her!

Shameless.

“Zhao Xueyin said gently, “Maybe! Si Lan, you’re so beautiful, Jin Ruyu must be here to greet you. I’m just a foil to you.” ”

This was called flattery.

Wen Si Lan was so pleased with herself now that she would be disappointed in a moment.

Zhao Xueyin could already imagine Wen Si Lan’s face when Si lui walked up to her and affectionately called her ‘Xueyin’.

“At that time, not only would wen si lan be slapped in the face, but the other socialites in the banquet hall would also be envious. ”

Jin Ruyu was the sole heir of the Jin family.

Most of the socialites tonight were here for Jin Ruyu.

The Jin family’s position in the financial world was only second to DK Financial Group.

“Jin Ruyu was still unmarried. As long as she could marry Jin Ruyu, she would be the matriarch of the Jin Financial Group! ”

“And now, she was the only white moonlight in Jin Ruyu’s heart, the cinnabar mole. ”

“From the way the lawyer was acting, he knew that he would definitely use today’s opportunity to give her a deep and affectionate confession in front of everyone. ”

“Thinking of that scene, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes lit up. ”

It was as if she could see the envious and jealous eyes of everyone. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However.

Zhao Xueyin still hadn’t decided whether to agree to the lawyer.

Men all had a bad nature.

They were too easy to get and didn’t know how to cherish them.

“Therefore, she couldn’t agree to the lawyer in front of everyone. ”

She had to hang on to the lawyer first.

Let the lawyer know that she wasn’t someone who could be coaxed back with just a few words of love.

“The lawyer loved her so much that even if she rejected the lawyer once, the lawyer would continue to love her. ”

It was just that she didn’t know if the lawyer would be able to accept her rejection in front of everyone.

The lawyer might even cry out loud.

“When she thought of the sole heir of the Jin family seeking death for her, Zhao Xueyin’s heart was filled with a sense of superiority. ”

“In the entire financial world, who else could become like the Jin family? ”

She watched as the lawyer was getting closer and closer to her.

Zhao Xueyin’s heart was beating faster and faster.

Bang Bang Bang —

“One after another, it was as if it would jump out of her chest at any moment. ”

“At the same time, Zhao Xueyin was also thinking about how she was going to reject si lui. ”

“Wen Si Lan was also very excited. “Xueyin, it seems like Jin Ruyu is really coming for us! Look! Look!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin pretended not to care. “There’s nothing to see. No matter how powerful Jin Ruyu is, he’s just an ordinary man.” ”

“Wen Si Lan lowered her head and looked at Zhao Xueyin with admiration in her eyes. “Xueyin, as expected of someone who has seen big things! You’re still so calm when facing the heir of the Jin family!” ”

Zhao Xueyin lowered her head and smiled.

Wen Si Lan was now so shocked.

“When the lawyer stood in front of her and confessed, Wen Si Lan would be so shocked that her jaw would drop? ”
