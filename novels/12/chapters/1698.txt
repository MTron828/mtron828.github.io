“This place is pretty good.”Ye Zao’s brows and eyes were still the same. No expression could be seen on his calm face.

“Upon hearing this, Qian You Long’s face broke out in cold sweat. “Then, then please wait a moment. I’ll go and contact team leader Wu Now.” ”

“Go.”

“”Alright, I’ll go right away.”Qian you long continued, “Oh right, Miss Ye, this is Xiao Tao. If you have any needs, just tell him directly.” ”

“After saying that, Qian Youlong walked out of the door and asked someone to pour tea for ye Zao. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The person in charge of pouring tea was called Fan Lian. She had been in the Institute for a while, but this was the first time she had seen Qian Youlong like this. It was also the first time she had sent tea to the interrogation room. ”

She didn’t know who this Miss Ye was.

Fan Lian was a little curious.

On the other side.

At the Zou family home.

Zou Feifei was still very angry all the way home.

“”Mom, what did my godfather say? Ye Zhuo and Lin Sha made me miss the college entrance exam. He told my godfather not to let them off so easily!” ”

“Zou’s mother smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’ve already told them everything!” ”

“Really?”Zou Feifei asked.

“Zou’s mother continued, “Silly daughter, when have I ever lied to You?” ”

Zou Feifei was extremely excited at the thought of Ye Zhuo and Lin Shasha going to jail soon.

“At last, the bad guys got their comeuppance! ”

Especially ye Zhuo.

“What was the use of being so beautiful? In the end, she was still a trash who was going to jail. ”

“At the thought of this, Zou Feifei’s lips curled up. ”

Just wait.

“Once he went to jail, Ye Zhuo would never be able to stand out again in his life! ”

And then there was Lin Sha.

Wasn’t she arrogant before?

She wanted to see how Lin Sha would be arrogant in the future!

“Zou looked at Zou feifei and reproached him, “You too! Why did you provoke those people for no reason? You almost got yourself involved in the college entrance exam!” ”

“”How could I have known that things would turn out like this! And it wasn’t my fault at all! “Lin Sha didn’t die, she wasn’t injured, and she didn’t delay the college entrance exam. What right do they have to cause trouble for me?”Zou Feifei’s original intention was to stop Lin Sha from participating in the second half of the college entrance exam, who would have thought that Lin Sha would actually turn the situation around! After taking the medicine, not only was she completely fine, she even participated in the college entrance exam! What made Zou Feifei most angry was that Lin Sha even said that she did well in the exam. ”

“After all, this year’s math exam was very difficult. Even Zou Feifei dared to say that he did well in the exam. Who knew how jealous Zou Feifei was when Lin Shasha said those words in front of Zou Feifei! ”

The top scorer was hers!

“What right did that Old Woman, Lin Shasha, have to compete with her? ”

“Zou’s mother continued, “Fortunately, your godfather is here this time. Otherwise, you would really be finished!” ”

“”I know.”Zou Feifei hugged Zou’s mother’s waist and smiled, “Don’t worry, I will definitely thank Godfather.” ”

Zou’s mother nodded.

“Zou feifei continued, “By the way, when you left the police station, did they capture Lin Sha as well?” ”

“”Not yet,”Zou’s mother continued, “But Qian Youlong promised me that he will make Lin Sha pay the price. Don’t worry, those two little girls will definitely pay the price for this!” ”

“That’s good.”

“Zou feifei continued, “But I’m still a little worried. You can call godfather and ask him about it. After all, godfather is a noble and forgetful person.” ”

“Okay.”Zou’s mother nodded and took out her phone to make a call.

The call was quickly connected.

“Wu Jiaguo smiled and said, “Mingzhi, don’t worry. Feifei is my goddaughter. I will definitely take this matter to heart and deal with it until Feifei is satisfied.” ”

“Hearing that, Zou Feifei snatched the phone away and said in disbelief, “Godfather, is it true?” ”

“”Of course it’s true,”Wu Jiaguo said. ”

“”Then thank you, Godfather!”Zou Feifei did not forget to add, “Godfather, don’t forget about Lin Sha! She is also one of the Masterminds!” ”

“”Okay, okay, I will remember everything.” ”

Zou feifei hung up the phone in satisfaction.

“Mother Zou continued, “Hurry up and prepare for the exam! There’s still time.” ”

“”Okay.”Zou feifei was very confident. This time, she would definitely be the top scorer in the college entrance exam! ”

“Mother Zou continued, “If you can get the top scorer, you won’t have to go through all the trouble of being the Princess Consort’s godfather.” ”

“Zou feifei smiled and nodded. “Mom, don’t worry. I’ll definitely be the top scorer this year!” ”

Zou Feifei arrived at the examination venue at the right time.

“After hanging up on Zou Feifei, Wu Jiaguo dialed the secretary’s internal line. “Ask Qian Youlong. Have you done what he asked him to do this morning?” ”
