Went out for the New Year?

Li Shuyi immediately stood up from the sofa.

“If CEN fifth master went out for the New Year, what would she do? ”

“In order to leave a good impression on CEN fifth master, Li Shuyi specially put on makeup and changed into a certain brand’s Gao Ding. ”

“In the end, CEN fifth master wasn’t around! ”

What was this?

“After a while, Li Shuyi continued to ask, “Why didn’t you go with him?” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “They’re dating each other. Why would I go? To be a third wheel?” ”

Li Yueyue was a person who knew her limits.

She would never be a third wheel!

She didn’t even add her best friend’s boyfriend’s wechat or QQ.

Boyfriend and girlfriend dating each other?

Li Shuyi was stunned again and couldn’t react in time.

Li Yueyue also looked at Li Shuyi strangely.

Why did Li Shuyi ask all these questions out of the blue?

Li Shuyi wanted to cry now!

“She had meticulously prepared everything, but now, fifth master Cen wasn’t here. ”

What was this?

But Li Shuyi still maintained her smile.

It didn’t matter.

“Fifth Master Cen was living in the Li family now, so she still had a chance. ”

“Li Shuyi nodded and continued, “I see! Then they should be attending the bonfire banquet later, right?” ”

“Coming to the prairie to celebrate the new year, they would usually not miss the bonfire banquet. ”

“I think so.”Li Yueyue nodded.

“Li Shuyi held onto Li Yueyue’s arm. “Yueyue, let’s go to the Bonfire Banquet Tonight as well!” ”

“Li Yueyue wanted to reject Li Shuyi, but she was embarrassed and could only bite the bullet and nod. “Okay.” ”

“Then let’s go and eat. We’ll go after we finish eating.”

“At the dining table, Li Shuyi started to praise Fang yinyue’s cooking skills again. ”

“The mother and daughter pair were singing along, causing Li Sanzhu to be a little dumbfounded. ”

The situation didn’t seem right.

“Finding an opportunity, Li Sanzhu whispered to fang yinyue, “Yinyue, what’s going on with second brother and second sister-in-law today? Something doesn’t seem right to me!” ”

“As a younger brother, Li Sanzhu knew Li Erzhu’s character very well. ”

“If it weren’t for the sake of their brothers and sisters, Li Sanzhu would have long stopped interacting with Li Erzhu’s family. ”

But there was no other way.

A brother was a brother.

“Fang yinyue glanced in the direction of the living room and then said, “Can’t you see it?” ”

“See what?”Li Sanzhu asked.

“Fang yinyue said, “Who did the family of three come for? Can’t you see it?” ”

Li Sanzhu shook his head.

He really couldn’t tell.

Li Sanzhu was a standard big man from the north. His mind was not that meticulous. He ate meat and drank wine.

“Fang yinyue continued, “Don’t you realize that when they eat, they are always talking about Cen Wu?” ”

“Li Sanzhu was just a little careless. He was not stupid. He immediately recognized the hidden meaning in Fang yinyue’s words. “Yinyue, you can’t say such things!” ”

“”You’ll know if it’s nonsense.”Fang yinyue continued, “You know better than me what kind of people your second brother and second sister-in-law’s family are. Why would they treat US so well for no reason?” ”

This was simply a dream!

“Li Sanzhu was silent for a moment before he continued, “Then this is not a good thing!” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Who Was Cen Wu Ye?

He had power both at home and abroad!

Even the big shots from abroad had to give him some face when they saw him.

“If Li Erzhu’s family angered him, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“Fang yinyue sighed. “I really don’t know what your second brother and sister-in-law are thinking! They even dare to have such an idea! Fortunately, fifth master Huo and Miss Ye will be leaving tomorrow. Otherwise, there would really be some trouble.” ”

Li Sanzhu nodded.

“After eating, Li Shuyi pulled Li Yueyue along to attend the bonfire dinner. ”

“As the name suggested, Bonfire dinner was a huge bonfire in the snow. The men and women on the grassland held hands and danced around the bonfire to sing. ”

Unmarried men and women could also sing to each other to attract the attention of their loved ones.

“On New Year’s Eve, everyone would come out to attend the bonfire dinner. ”

“At this moment, the bonfire dinner had not officially started yet. The staff responsible for burning the bonfire was adding firewood to the bonfire to ensure that the bonfire could burn even brighter! ”

The Bonfire Dinner started at 8 o’clock sharp. The Bonfire had to burn until 8 o’clock the next morning.

“The brighter the bonfire burned, the brighter the new year would be. ”

“If the bonfire was extinguished midway, it would be a very bad omen. ”

“Therefore, before the start of the bonfire dinner, they had to carry out a strict inspection to ensure that the bonfire dinner could start and end smoothly. ”

No one wants to leave any bad omens in the New Year’s Eve.

“The flames are all over the sky, and before we go in, we feel the heat wave rolling. ”
