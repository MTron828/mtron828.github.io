Chapter 200: 089: Lin Jin city’s secret, brother Ze who dug up the trap, so domineering! 6

It was all that Old Hag’s fault.

If it wasn’t for brewing the medicine for that old hag, she wouldn’t have been beaten by Feng Qianhua.

Feng Xianxian bit her lip.

Feng Qianhua continued, “Stay at home. I’ll get someone to send the medicine over.”

After saying that, Feng Qianhua turned around and left.

Not long after, they arrived at the Lin residence.

Auntie Zhang came out to welcome her mother. “Isn’t Xianxian not going to school today? Why didn’t she come along?”

Thinking about what had happened today, Feng Qianhua sighed. “That child is too insensible.”

“What’s going on?”Auntie Zhang frowned.

Feng Qianhua shook her head. “There’s no point in talking.”

The two of them walked along the way. At this moment, Lin Ze walked out from inside.

He walked past Feng Qianhua, but he didn’t even greet her.

A hint of dissatisfaction flashed across Feng Qianhua’s eyes.

...... T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She was going to marry into the Feng family and become Lin Ze’s mother.

Lin Ze was getting more and more outrageous!

In the past, when he saw her, he would at least pretend, but now he didn’t even pretend!

After taking Lin Ze far away, Feng Qianhua lowered her voice and said, “Did you pay attention to the thing I asked you to pay attention to last time?”

Aunt Zhang raised her head and looked around. Seeing that there was no one around, she stood on her tiptoes and whispered a few words into Feng Qianhua’s ear.

Hearing this, the corners of Feng Qianhua’s mouth curled up.

Good!

This was really great!

Didn’t Lin ze turn the tables the last time?

This time, she wanted to see how Lin Ze would turn the tables!

She had to make old Mrs. Lin give up on Lin Ze, this grandson of hers, completely.

Only the child she gave birth to was worthy of being the Lin family’s grandson!

What was Lin Ze?

He was a bastard child born from a shameless woman!

He should get the hell out of the Lin Family!

Little did he know.

Lin Ze, who was supposed to have walked out of the Lin family’s door, suddenly appeared behind the two of them.

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes.

He had always felt that Feng Qianhua was behind his last trip to Yun Jing. Otherwise, it was impossible for Old Lady Lin to find out the moment he arrived at Yun Jing.

In this family, Aunt Zhang was her insider.

As for whether it was as he had guessed, he would soon be able to verify it.

He had to prepare the bait and wait for the fish to take the bait.

...

In the LIN Group’s office.

Lin Jincheng stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and looked down at the traffic below the company. At this moment, his expression changed. He immediately walked to his desk, picked up the microphone, and quickly made a call.

Soon, his secretary arrived.

“Secretary Zhang.”

“Director Lin, is there something you need me for?”

Lin Jincheng pressed his temples. “Secretary Zhang, I can’t remember those things again. I’ve Forgotten Ah Ze’s mother again. Who Is Ah Ze’s mother? What is Ah Ze’s mother’s name?”

The car accident 19 years ago not only took away one of Lin Jincheng’s legs.

It also took half of his life.

He lay in the hospital bed for 10 years before he really woke up.

Although he had woken up, there were serious sequelae.

Because of the damage to the cerebellum, part of his memory was short.

In addition, he had to endure the pain of phantom limbs that ordinary people could not bear.

Before Lin Jincheng recovered his memory, Old Mrs. Lin had been telling Lin Jincheng that Lin Ze’s biological mother had died.

And she had been matchmaking Lin Jincheng and Feng Qianhua.

Until February last year.

Lin Jincheng suddenly found his memory.

He remembered the person he loved the most in his heart.

So, Lin Jincheng ignored old Mrs. Lin’s hindrance and dragged his sick body to Yun Jing to look for ye Shu.

He personally took the child’s hair for identification.

He had wanted to reunite the family after the identification results came out.

He did not expect fate to play a huge joke on Lin Jin Cheng.

The child was not his.

This was something Lin Jin Cheng had never expected.

Lin Jin Cheng, who had finally recovered, was stimulated by this incident and his condition worsened. He started to stay in the hospital and take medicine.

His memories were also intermittent.

Sometimes he could remember.

Sometimes he could not remember.

Secretary Zhang poured a glass of water for Lin Jincheng. “CEO Lin, don’t worry. Take your time to think.”

“I actually forgot Ah Ze’s mother! How could I forget her?”Lin Jincheng pressed his temples. “I’ve Let Ah Ze’s mother down. I’ve let her down...”

He hadn’t forgotten anything.

He had only forgotten Lin Ze’s mother.

Why was it like this?

“Oh right, chief Lin, there’s also the diary.”Secretary Zhang seemed to have suddenly remembered something, “The diary in your safe. You Asked Me to remind you before that if you ever forget your wife again, you will remember it when you look at the diary.”
