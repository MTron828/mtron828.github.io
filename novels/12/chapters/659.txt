“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing was also a little surprised. “Then if this matter is successful, won’t you and your good friend become relatives?””

“You can say that.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Leader, who is older between you and your friend?””

Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “Lizi is older than me by half a year.”

Older by half a year?

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”fine, this ancestor had given him another sister.”

He had thought that he would be able to turn the tables and become brother-in-law again.

He did not expect it to be brother-in-law...

“Ye Zhuo held Cen Shaoqing’s hand and walked in another direction. “Let’s go this way. If fourth uncle and aunt Xia see us, they will definitely be embarrassed.””

Cen Shaoqing followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

It was not until four o’clock in the afternoon that Cen Shaoqing reluctantly sent ye Zhuo back.

...

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next morning.”

“After breakfast, Lin Ze drove ye Zhuo to the airport.”

“After sending him to the airport, Lin Ze frowned slightly. “Does your boyfriend know that you are returning to Yun Jing today?””

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Hearing this, Lin Ze’s frown deepened. “Even if he knew, he wouldn’t come to see you off?””

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “He’s been quite busy recently. Brother, don’t be angry.””

“Lin Ze said, “Is work more important than a girlfriend?”Lin Ze had never thought highly of Cen Shaoqing from the start. Now That Ye Zhuo was returning to cloud capital, Cen Shaoqing didn’t even come to see him off. This made Lin Ze even angrier.”

He felt that Cen Shaoqing did not have the awareness that a boyfriend should have.

“It was still in the dating period. If they got married, would ye Zao still have a presence in front of him in the future?”

“Ye Zao continued, “Isn’t it already the end of the year? Everyone is quite busy. Brother, let’s understand each other.””

Lin Ze looked at the time on his phone. “It’s getting late. Hurry up and go in. Don’t miss your flight.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then I’ll go in first.”

“Go in. Remember to call me when you get there.”Lin Ze watched ye Zao enter the boarding gate. He only turned around and left when he couldn’t see ye Zao at all.

Ye Zao had booked First Class.

There were two seats in a row in the first class cabin. There were eight seats in total. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin except for Ye Zao.

Ye Zao found his seat and sat down. He asked the stewardess for an eye patch and began to take a nap with his eyes narrowed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He did not know how much time had passed.

Ye Zao felt as if there was an additional person beside him.

“Moreover, that person even extended a claw at him.”

“Just as that Claw was about to reach ye Zao’s cheek, ye Zao quickly reacted. He used an grappling hand and pinned the person to the seat. His knees were pressed against his chest.”

“The entire action was done in one go, and in less than three seconds, the man was subdued.”

“”Leader, it’s me.””

A deep and familiar voice sounded in the air.

This is...

Cen Shaoqing?

“Ye Zao pulled down his blindfold. As expected, the person under her was Cen Shaoqing.”

“Ye Zao let go of Cen Shaoqing and said in surprise, “Didn’t you say that you’ve been very busy recently?””

Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled up slightly. “I have a surprise for you.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to have such a romantic side to you.”Cen Shaoqing had been with Cen Shaoqing for so long, and he had always been a straight-laced person.”

“Therefore, when Cen Shaoqing said that he was very busy today, ye Zao did not suspect anything.”

Cen Shaoqing just looked at Ye Zao. “It’s all thanks to the leadership’s good training.”

“Ye Zao glanced at the empty first-class cabin and asked, “Did you book this place?””

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and said, “Yes.””

...

“Four hours later, the plane landed at Yun Jing Airport.”

Cen Shaoqing held the luggage in one hand and ye Zao in the other as they walked out of the airport.

“As they had made arrangements beforehand, there were already drivers waiting outside the airport.”

“After getting into the car, Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo. “Are we going to the hotel or somewhere else?””

“Ye Zhuo said, “Let’s go to my house.””

“It had been such a long time since he had returned, so ye Zhuo was quite worried about his family.”

“Sure.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The car sped along and soon arrived at the ye family’s residential area.

The chauffeur went around to the trunk and took out their luggage.

Cen Shaoqing took the suitcases from the driver. “Take a taxi back first. Leave the car here.”

“”Okay, fifth master.”The driver nodded.”

“Although no one lived in the Ye family for a long time, Zhou Yuelian often came to water the plants at home, so there was no dust at home. It was almost the same as when they left.”

The few pots of plants on the balcony looked even more verdant.
