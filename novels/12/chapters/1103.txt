“Chapter 1104: 243: Master Technology, Control Finance! The all-powerful burning! 6”

Translator: 549690339

“””I think your brain is broken!””Elder Guo was a straightforward person. When he spoke, he was not polite at all.”

“Elder Zhang looked at elder guo, “”Are you here to quarrel with me?”””

“Elder Guo sighed, “”I’m worried about the future of the Shunxi Financial Group! The position of president was not easy to sit on. Every word and action of hers represented the old man! The old man has been gone for so many years, people are looking forward to his descendants, if outsiders see the old man’s descendants... . .”””

The rest is self-evident.

Master IP is famous all his life.

He didn’t want Ye to lose face.

“Ye Zhuo even within two years to build an aircraft carrier such a big impractical, groundless boasting dare to say, there is nothing that she dare not do?”

“Elder Guo paused at this point and continued, “”Why don’t we let her go back? It’s better for her to leave on her own than to be kicked off the stage by everyone!”””

“As a financier, they all paid attention to stopping losses in time.”

“Looking at Ye Zhuo’s appearance, it was obvious that she wouldn’t be able to stand up.”

It was better to let her go back as soon as possible.

“This way, not only could they save grandfather Ye’s face, but they could also reduce the losses of the Shunxi Financial Group. It was simply killing two birds with one stone.”

“””Your worries are unnecessary.””Old Zhang’s expression was firm. “”The position of the President will definitely be more stable than anyone else’s!”””

“After saying this, old Zhang turned to look at old Guo and continued, “”You don’t understand burning, so I don’t blame you for saying these words today. Just wait! Burning will make all of Your Eyes Light Up!”””

Light Up?

What made ye Zhuo’s eyes light up?

Was he trying to bluff them with that mouth?

“Elder guo sighed helplessly, “”Why can’t you listen to Reason!”””

“””Facts speak louder than words.””Elder Zhang walked to the door and frowned, “”Just you wait!”””

“After saying that, elder Zhang opened the door and walked out.”

“Elder Guo looked at elder Zhang’s back with an inexplicable look in his eyes. In the end, he shook his head helplessly, opened the door, and walked out.”

On the other side.

Zhao Xueyin led ye Zao around the Financial Group. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Everyone was very curious about this new president who had descended from the sky.

Because she was too young!

“Although Zhao Xueyin was also very young, everyone had witnessed Zhao Xueyin’s ability.”

“After hearing that ye Zao was the descendant of Grandfather Ye, everyone instantly came to a realization.”

So there was a backer.

And the backer was very strong!

Sun Yiran looked at ye Zhuo beside Zhao Xueyin and bit her lip tightly.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, the person standing beside Zhao Xueyin right now would be her.”

Sun Yiran had prepared for more than three years for this position of president.

“She had waited with great difficulty for president Yu to step down, but she didn’t expect ye Zhuo to beat her to it.”

What right did ye Zhuo have?

“As far as she knew, Ye Zao was a financial idiot!”

“Thinking of this, Sun Yiran narrowed her eyes.”

“Ye Zao stole her position as president, right?”

Then she would let ye Zao Make a fool of himself in public!

She would let ye Zao know that the position of president wasn’t so easy to sit on.

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin brought ye Zao to Sun Yiran’s side, “”Yiran, this is the new president, Miss Ye. “”Sister Ye Zhuo, this is elder Sun’s granddaughter, Sun Yiran. She’s also the vice president of our consortium.””. “”Yiran, in the future, when it comes to work, you have to cooperate well with sister Ye Zhuo.”””

“””Hello, Miss Ye. I’m Sun Yiran.””Sun Yiran extended her hand to Ye Zhuo. “”Please take care of me in the future.”””

“Ye Zhuo extended his hand to hold Sun Yiran’s hand. “”Hello.”””

“Sun yiran continued, “”Miss Ye, you’ve just arrived at the consortium. You must not understand the history of the development of the consortium, right? This is the corporate culture of our consortium. Take a look.”””

“After saying that, Sun Yiran handed a document to ye Zao.”

Ye Zao flipped through it and frowned slightly.

“””Oh, I’m sorry, Miss Ye! I forgot that this is a financial system! You’ve just arrived at the consortium. You must not understand the financial system. Tomorrow, I’ll get someone to send you a Chinese version.”””

Financial systems were a language unique to the financial world and only circulated in the financial world.

The outsiders could not understand it at all.

“As the descendant of Grandfather Ye, ye Zhuo actually did not even know about financial systems. It was simply a joke!”
