Translator: 549690339

Who would have thought that Cen Haifeng would fall in love with Zhou Xiang at a glance during the blind date.

“At that time, Xie Wanqiu was extremely depressed. ”

“For someone like Zhou Xiang, it didn’t matter what she wanted. Cen Haifeng also didn’t know what he saw in her! ”

“If Xie Lingli had married Cen Haifeng, then Zheng Wanyin was now the legitimate eldest daughter of the Cen family. ”

“”No matter what happened in the previous generation, it’s all in the past!”Zheng wanyin said angrily, “I only know that cousin has a girlfriend now! “I can’t do such immoral things. Grandma, please don’t say such things in the future!” ”

“Xie wanqiu glanced at Zheng wanyin and sighed, “I don’t know who you followed! You’re so useless! If it weren’t for me by your side, you would have been bullied to death by those people sooner or later!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin held Xie Wanqiu’s arm and said with a smile, “Then Grandma, you can accompany me for the rest of your life!” ”

“Xie wanqiu poked Zheng Wanyin’s arm, “The one who can accompany you for the rest of your life is the person next to you. How can an old woman like me accompany you for the rest of your life!” ”

“”Aiya,”Zheng Wanyin hugged xie wanqiu, “If I say I can, then I can!” ”

Downstairs.

“Seeing that Xie Wanqiu and Zheng Wanyin had already gone upstairs, CEN yuying sighed and said, “It’s really rare for someone like the old lady not to raise Wanyin Askew!” ”

The old lady was obviously referring to Xie wanqiu.

“CEN yueying continued, “Big Sis, your words are too one-sided. You know a person’s face but not his heart. Who knows what Zheng Wanyin is thinking in her heart!” ”

“Cen Yuying frowned. “I don’t think Wanyin and the old lady are the same kind of people, right?” ”

“”Who cares if they are the same kind of people!”CEN yueying said, “In short, one must be wary of others! Moreover, not only does Zheng Wanyin bleed from the old lady, she was raised by the old lady herself.” ”

Old Lady Cen nodded. “Third girl is right! One must be wary of others. Who knows what she is thinking?”

“Yes.”Cen Yuying nodded.

“After saying that, CEN yuying continued, “I wonder when the old lady will leave!” ”

“CEN yueying said, “How many days has she been in our house?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “A week.” ”

“”A week?”Cen yueying said in surprise, “How can my mother tolerate her?” ”

“CEN yuying said, “Don’t you know our mother? Just endure it!” ”

“Old Madam Cen shook her head speechlessly. “If you continue to bear with it, you’ll turn into a ninja turtle. Fortunately, you kids don’t follow her!” ”

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day Cen Shaoqing came back. ”

“When she learned that Cen Shaoqing was coming back, Xie Wanqiu was especially excited. ”

Who was the real head of the Cen Family?

“Of course, it was Cen Shaoqing! ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was already 10:30 pm. Xie wanqiu was a little anxious when she still did not see Cen Shaoqing. “Xiangxiang, is Shaoqing coming back today?” ”

“”It’s today,”Zhou Xiang replied. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Then why isn’t he back yet?” ”

“Zhou Xiang explained, “Zao Zao will be here today. He must have gone to fetch Zao Zao.” ”

“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu was a little unhappy. ”

Fetch ye Zao?

Could it be that ye Zao was more important than her grandmother?

Each and every one of them did not know what was more important!

“Zheng Wanyin, who was by the side, said excitedly, “Does this mean that I’m going to meet my future cousin-in-law?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

Xie wanqiu glanced at Zheng Wanyin.

This girl was really heartless.

Who Was Ye Zhuo?

Her biggest enemy!

She was actually able to laugh.

“At this moment, Zheng Wanyin’s cell phone rang. ”

Zheng Wanyin picked up the call. “Hello.”

“The next second, Zheng Wanyin’s accent changed into fluent English. ”

“After hanging up, Xie wanqiu asked, “Who called?” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “ABA’s Deputy Executive Officer.” ”

“ABA was an International League organization. Three years ago, Zheng Wanyin officially joined ABA and was now a core member of ABA. ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Is there something the executive officer wants to talk to you about?” ”

“Zheng wanyin replied, “Mr. Carl will be in Beijing tomorrow. When the executive officer learned that I was in Beijing and that I had a good relationship with Mr. Carl, he asked me to pick him up. ”

Who is Mr. Carl?

An International Master of Scientific Research!

Xie wanqiu’s face was filled with pride.

Look at how capable she was at kissing her granddaughter.

“Not only did she join ABA, but she also had a good relationship with Mr. Carl. ”

Was that ye Zao Good Enough?

Ye Zao was probably not even half as good as Zheng Wanyin.

The two of them could not be compared at all.

“At this moment, footsteps and the voice of the butler could be heard from outside the door. ”

“”Fifth master, Old Madam and the others are already waiting inside.” ”

“Yes.”

Zheng Wanyin looked up and saw a tall and slender figure.

“Her face was like a crown of jade, and her well-defined facial features seemed to be covered with an impenetrable layer of frost. ”

She was dressed in a plain robe and held a string of bright red Buddhist beads in her hands. Her flawless hands seemed even more well-defined at this moment.

“Looking further to the side, she could see the figure of a girl. ”

Her figure was like Jade.

“She wore a simple light-colored qipao with a wine-red coat draped over it. Her 3,000 black hair was draped behind her head, and she wore a side clip of the same color as the coat on the left side of her ear. She was talking and laughing merrily, she was as beautiful as a young lady from an oil painting from the Republic of China. ”

She was beautiful and elegant at the same time.

“However, as she walked, a powerful aura erupted from her. ”

“When she walked together with Cen Shaoqing, they looked like a beautiful couple. ”

Zheng Wanyin was stunned and could not react in time.

Xie Wanqiu was also stunned.

“Although the old lady Cen had emphasized that ye Zao was very beautiful several times, she did not expect ye Zao to be so beautiful. ”

But what was the use of being beautiful?

“As long as one had money, what beautiful woman could not be found? ”

Ability was the most important thing.

No.

She could not let ye Zao steal everyone’s attention just like that.

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, when Will Mr. Carl Arrive Tomorrow? Do you need Grandma to go with you to pick him up?” ”

Zheng Wanyin and Mr. Carl were close friends.
