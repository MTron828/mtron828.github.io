“Every word the assistant said turned into a sharp knife, directly cutting on Qiu Di’s face. ”

It made Qiu di feel ashamed.

What did it mean that only miss ye had the right to look up information about the trans-star case?

Where did they put her Qiu Di?

“When Ye Zao was here, it was fine if they couldn’t see her, but now that ye Zao was dead, what did they mean? ”

Could it be that Chang Yue could find a second woman who was more outstanding than her? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Qiu Di’s brows were cold, and the anger on her face was almost overflowing. She never expected that the eight great families would be so disrespectful to her. ”

“The eight great families had a very high status in Chang Yue, and their origins were especially mysterious. ”

“Five years ago, a sudden interstellar disaster almost wiped out the eight great families. Thankfully, Ye Zao had acted in time at the most critical moment, so the eight great families were saved and the alien civilization was repelled. ”

He also signed a contract with the alien civilization to not invade Chang Yue for another hundred years.

“Therefore, the eight great families were loyal to Ye Zao. Even though ye Zao had passed away, they were still loyal to him and only listened to his orders. ”

“However, what happened in the past was in the past. Now, she was the one in charge in Chang Yue. Could it be that she was worse than a dead person? ”

“Right now, she just wanted to take a look at the information on the inter-planetary case. The eight great families had all stepped in to stop it. If it was the day of the general election, what would happen? ”

“If the eight great families did not choose her, then how could she ascend to the throne? ”

No!

No!

She had to take that position. No one could stop her.

“Thinking of this, Qiu Di clenched her fists. ”

“The assistant carefully looked at Qiu Di’s expression. He didn’t even dare to make a sound, then he said, “Young miss, don’t be angry. No matter how powerful Miss Ye is, it’s all in the past. She can’t be compared to you. You’re like the waves in the Yangtze river receding before the waves in the front. Miss Ye’s waves in the front have long been smashed to death on the beach. “Those old fellows from the eight great clans are all blind. You’re a magnanimous person, so why bother to lower yourself to their level?” ”

“”Go and call Wu Han over for me,”Qiu di said. ”

“”Alright, Please Wait a moment.”The assistant nodded and turned around to look for Wu Han. ”

“Wu Han stood outside, his posture straight. From the back, he looked like an emotionless sculpture. ”

“Captain Wu.”The assistant walked to Wu Han’s side and cautiously asked.

“In the entire Qiu Clan, who didn’t know that Wu Han had a strange temper? Most importantly, his origin was still unknown. Although Qiu di was very strict with Wu Han, he was still someone who followed Qiu Di. ”

“Qiu Di was the eldest daughter of the Qiu family, and she was also a candidate for the general election. Once Qiu di was really elected to the position of female sovereign, Wu Han’s status would rise along with the tide. ”

“If they really offended Wu Han, they wouldn’t have a good ending. ”

Wu Han didn’t say anything and glanced at his assistant.

“Other than Qiu Di, Wu Han rarely spoke to outsiders. His assistant wasn’t surprised that he was like this. He continued, “Captain Wu, the eldest daughter wants you to go in. She has something to tell you.” ”

Wu Han nodded. He put down the gun in his hand and walked in.

“When he walked in, Wu Han stood in front of Qiu di and said respectfully, “Eldest miss, what do you need?” ”

“Go to the eight great clans and bring the information on the trans-star case.”Qiu Di looked at Wu Han and said.

“Wu Han used to be ye Zao’s most loyal subordinate. Of course, when Ye Zao helped the eight great clans, Wu Han was also there. ”

“At this moment, if Wu Han went over, the eight great clans would definitely listen to her. ”

“”Alright, Please Wait a moment.”Wu Han bowed. ”

“After saying this, Wu Han bowed and walked out. ”

“Wait.”

“At this moment, Qiu di suddenly called out to Wu Han. ”

“”Eldest miss, do you have anything else?”Wu Han stopped and turned around. ”

“The eight great clans were located at the heart of the Chang Yue country. It was easy to defend but hard to attack. They needed to see a pass to enter and exit. As soon as Wu Han came over, he was recognized by the guards. ”

The guards immediately went to inform the head of the clan.

“When he heard that Wu Han had come, the head of the clan was extremely excited. He personally came out to welcome him, “Mr. Ye, long time no see! Please come in!”Ever since ye Zao disappeared.., wu Han also disappeared. Now that he saw Wu Han again, the head of the clan saw hope. ”

“Although he had already attended ye Zao’s memorial ceremony, he still felt that ye Zao was not dead yet. Ye Zao was definitely still alive! ”

A person like ye Zao would not die so easily.

“As long as Ye Zao was alive, there was hope. ”

“Chang Yue could do without anyone, but it could not do without ye Zao. ”
