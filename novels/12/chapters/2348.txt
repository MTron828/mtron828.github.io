“Old Master Bai did not directly answer Bai Sanfeng. Instead, he raised his head and said, “Third sister, don’t you regret it? Not at all?” ”

“Upon hearing this, Bai Sanfeng paused. ”

She did not know how to answer.

“After a moment, Bai Sanfeng looked at Old Master Bai and said firmly, “I don’t regret it. I will never regret it.” ”

“”But I regret it.”Old Master Bai did not directly expose Bai Sanfeng’s words. “So I will not let my granddaughter regret it again. This is the only time in life. When it’s time to love, you have to love. When it’s time to rush, you have to rush.” ”

Bai Sanfeng frowned slightly. “Don’t you feel that you are being very childish now?”

How Old was she?

“She should have learned to see through appearances long ago, but her younger brother still yearned for love. ”

It was even a little ridiculous.

Old Master Bai looked at Bai Sanfeng. “It’s just that you don’t dare to face reality.”

“I’ll ask you one thing now. Are you going to cancel the wedding between Jing Shu and that Earthling?”Bai Sanfeng continued to ask.

“”No,”elder Bai rejected her outright. ”

Bai Sanfeng nodded. “Then you won’t cancel my relationship with you even if I break off from now on?”

“Yes.”Elder Bai remained firm.

“All these years, elder Bai had always treated Bai Sanfeng with great respect. This was the first time he had refuted Bai Sanfeng. ”

He did not feel that he was at fault.

True Love was not at fault.

Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze were even more at fault.

“Looking at Old Master Bai like this, Bai Sanfeng knew that she did not need to say anything else. ”

Old Master Bai was her younger brother. No one knew old master Bai better than she did.

“”Alright, I understand.”Bai sanfeng nodded and continued, “As long as you don’t regret it in the future.” ”

It was the same for Ma Yue. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“She had said a lot to Bai Jingshu, but Bai Jingshu refused to listen and insisted on marrying Lin Ze. ”

“Helpless, Ma Yue had no choice but to give up trying to persuade Bai Jingshu. She sat by the bed and held Bai Jingshu’s hands. “Cousin, I hope you’ll be happy no matter what.” ”

“”Thank you,”Bai Jingshu said with a smile. ”

“At that moment, Ma Yue’s Communicator Rang. She looked down and said, “Cousin, my grandmother contacted me. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“I’ll send you off.”Bai Jingshu stood up as well.

Ma Yue nodded.

The two of them went outside and saw Bai Sanfeng already waiting at the door.

“Bai Jingshu greeted politely, “Great-aunt.” ”

“Bai Sanfeng’s face no longer had the usual benevolence. She nodded indifferently and said to Ma Yue, “Let’s go to Miss Mo’s Place! I brought her quite a number of top-grade blood stones!” ”

“These words were deliberately said for Bai Jingzhu to hear. After all, the blood stones usually belonged to Bai Jingzhu. ”

“Okay.”Ma Yue nodded.

Bai Jingzhu watched as Bai Sanfeng and Ma Yue’s figures disappeared outside the main door before she turned around and returned to her room.

“Ma Yue smiled and said, “Grandma, aren’t you going to ask cousin if she changed her mind after I persuaded her?” ”

“”Is there a need to ask?”Bai sanfeng continued, “Whether or not she changes her mind now has nothing to do with me. I didn’t notice before that Miss Mo is actually not bad. Remember to come into contact with miss mo more in the future.” ”

“Okay.”Ma Yue nodded.

On the other side.

Beijing.

The wedding date was getting closer and closer.

The Lin family manor was also very busy during this period of time.

“Lin Ze was, after all, the eldest son of Lin Jin city. ”

The wedding of the eldest son naturally had to be held in a grand manner.

“Even Cen Shaoqing got busy with it, preparing all kinds of things needed for the wedding banquet. ”

“In fact, Cen Shaoqing had a little plan in mind. After helping Lin Ze prepare this time, he had experience. When he and Ye Zhuo got married, he would not be as blind as a headless fly. ”

“Ye Zhuo sat on the sofa and smiled as he watched Cen Shaoqing busy himself. He teased, “Why are you more proactive than the person involved in my brother’s marriage?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly and lowered his voice. “Ah Ze is, after all, my child’s future uncle. How can I not be proactive when my brother-in-law is getting married?” ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing was a little older than Lin Ze, he was not ambiguous when it came to calling himself his brother-in-law. ”

“”Who is your child’s future uncle?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Mr. Cen, can you please have some face?” ”

“”Facts speak louder than words.”Cen Shaoqing’s gaze fell on Ye Zhuo’s abdomen. “Leader, when are we going to settle this matter?” ”

He suddenly looked forward to having a child.

It would be best if it was a girl who looked like Ye Zhuo.

Be Good.

“Based on Ye Zao’s looks, Cen Shaoqing could almost imagine what his daughter would look like. ”
