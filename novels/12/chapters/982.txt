“He ziteng nodded. “Don’t worry, don’t worry. Fifth brother, you can rest assured. I have more experience than you in chasing after a girlfriend.””

“Thinking that Cen Shaoqing was about to call him brother-in-law, he ziteng was so excited that he wanted to sing a song!”

It would definitely be a wonderful scene!

“He ziteng took out his phone and continued, “Right, fifth brother, do you have an Lizi’s wechat? I forgot to add her!””

“No.”

He ziteng opened wechat. “Then I’ll ask Zhao Pingting for it.”

“When Zhao Pingting received he ziteng’s wechat, she turned to look at an Lizi. “Lizi, that he ziteng asked me for your wechat. I pushed your business card to him.””

“Push it.”An Lizi was playing a game and casually replied.

“A few seconds later, an Lizi looked up at Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, who did you say asked you for my wechat?””

“”He ziteng,”Zhao Pingting replied.”

“Him?”An Lizi frowned slightly. “I feel that he ziteng is a little crazy.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “He ziteng was Cen Shaoqing’s childhood friend. He’s actually a good person.””

“An lizi continued, “Zao, do you know what he said to me during dinner?””

“What?”

“An Lizi said, “He asked me if I have a boyfriend. If I don’t, should I consider him? Do you think strangers would talk about this on their first meeting?””

“In an Lizi’s opinion, it was a little frivolous.”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “He ziteng said it himself?”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded. “Do you think he has a screw loose in his brain?”

“Ye Zao said, “Actually, he’s usually quite steady. Did he fall in love with you at first sight?””

Zhao Pingting immediately came over. “Wow! Love at first sight!”

“An Lizi said speechlessly, “What era is it now? Do you guys still believe in love at first sight? I think he’s just a little dim-witted.””

An Lizi did not believe in love at first sight.

She felt that he ziteng’s brain was not good and his behavior was frivolous. He was not a good man.

On the other side.

“After he ziteng successfully added an Lizi’s wechat, he immediately sent her a message.”

“But after waiting for a long time, he still did not receive a reply from an Lizi.”

He ziteng frowned slightly.

It shouldn’t be.

“If an Lizi fell in love with him at first sight, she should have replied immediately.”

“He ziteng raised his head to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth brother, why do you think an Lizi hasn’t replied me yet?””

“Before Cen Shaoqing could say anything, he ziteng continued, “Do you think an Lizi is afraid that I’ll see through her? After all, girls are more reserved. She’s afraid that I’ll find out that she fell in love with me at First Sight!””

“”Yes! That must be the case! Actually, she doesn’t have to be like this. After all, I already know what’s on her mind.””

Cen Shaoqing was afraid that he would fall too deep into it. “Are you so sure that she fell in love with you at first sight?”

“Of course!”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “What if it’s a misunderstanding?””

“”Fifth brother, you’re jealous of me!””

Cen Shaoqing: ? ? ?

“He ziteng continued, “You’re jealous of an Lizi falling in love with me at first sight. After all, when you were courting fifth sister-in-law, fifth sister-in-law did not fall in love with you at first sight. Actually, fifth brother, you don’t have to be jealous of me at all. After all, people are different. Although you’re better than me, it doesn’t mean that every girl will fall in love with you at first sight!””

Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. “I don’t need love at first sight. I just want your fifth sister-in-law to be strict with her husband.”

“Strict with her husband?”He ziteng asked.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Of course. I’m a man of my word at home. If I tell your fifth sister-in-law to go east, your fifth sister-in-law won’t dare to go west. If I want to eat sweet food, your fifth sister-in-law won’t dare to eat spicy food. Can you do it?””

“He ziteng said, “I believe you! If fifth sister-in-law is really under the husband’s control, when we have dinner together tonight, you’ll still act like a cloth maid, supporting fifth sister-in-law?””

He ziteng could see all of this for real.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “In front of outsiders, we have to give her some face.””

“Is that so?”He ziteng frowned.

“”Of course it’s true.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “So, let me tell you, when a man is in a relationship, he must set his own rules. There’s a thing called husband gang.””

“He ziteng nodded, feeling that Cen Shaoqing’s words were very reasonable.”

“An Lizi had fallen in love with him at first sight, so she would definitely listen to him. He ziteng smiled and said, “Fifth brother, my husband Gang is definitely better than yours.””

Cen Shaoqing looked indifferent. “I’ll wait and see.”

“Just you wait and see.”

“At this moment, he ziteng still did not know that he had completely fallen into Cen Shaoqing’s trap.”

“In the blink of an eye, another three days had passed.”

Cen Shaoqing brought ye Zhuo to eat for half a month and went to visit Aunt Lang.

“Just as they stepped into the courtyard, they heard Aunt Lang coughing.”

“Are You Alright?”

Aunt Lang raised her head and saw ye Zao. “Zao Zao is here! Where’s Shaoqing?”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “He’s parked at the back. He’ll be here soon.””

Aunt Lang nodded.

“Ye Zao continued, “Did you go to the hospital to have a look at your cough?””

“I did. The doctor also prescribed some medicine. It’s not a big problem.”

“Ye Zao said, “I see that you look a little pale. You must not be sleeping well recently, right? I have some sedative medicine here. If you can’t sleep, take one.””

“Then, Ye Zhuo took out a bottle of medicine from his pocket and handed it to Aunty Lang.”

Aunty Lang reached out to take the medicine.

“However, when she lowered her head, she was stunned.”

It was exactly the same.

The Little Red Mole was exactly the same.

“Before Aunty Lang could react, Xiao Mei ran out from inside and said, “Aunty Lang, you have a phone call. It’s Miss Weiyue Calling.””

Aunty Lang was stunned for a moment before she took the phone. “Hello.”

“”Aunty, it’s me.”Xi Weiyue’s voice came from the other end of the phone. “My dad found Sister Half Moon.””

“”What?”Aunty Lang’s eyes instantly turned red. “Weiyue, what did you say? Say It Again?””

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “My dad found Sister Half Moon.””

“After a long while, Aunt Lang finally found her voice. “Weiyue, are you not joking with me?””

“”Aunt Lang, look at what you said. Would I joke with you about something like this? Please come back quickly! Sister Half Moon is by my side right now!””

Aunt Lang quickly nodded. “Okay! Okay! I’ll be back immediately! I’ll be back immediately!”
