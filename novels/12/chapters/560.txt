The Li family in the east of the city?

A smile appeared in Feng Qianhua’s eyes.

“It seemed that Zhao shuning was also a sensible person. She didn’t even mention it, but Zhao shuning immediately thought of the Li family in the east of the city. ”

Feng Qianhua suppressed the thoughts in her eyes. “Isn’t the Li family in the east of the city a little inappropriate?”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “Although the head of the Li family is already forty years old, the Li family has a big business. If we let that Little B * tch, Ye Zhuo, marry into the Li family, we won’t let her down.” ”

It was ye Zhuo who was able to marry into the Li family.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “What if… Jin city doesn’t agree?” ”

“Zhao shuning patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Qianhua, thank you for reminding me. I know what to do about this.” ”

“Feng Qianhua frowned. “Shuning, I’m just giving you a suggestion. I want you to marry that girl off. But if it’s the Li family from the east of the city, isn’t it a little inappropriate… After all, the head of the Li family…” ”

Feng Qianhua knew Zhao shuning too well.

“At this moment, the more she said that the head of the Li family was bad, and the more she stopped Zhao shuning, the more exhausted Zhao shuning would be to handle this matter well. ”

“In fact, Feng Qianhua was right. ”

“At this moment, Zhao Shuning was already planning how to marry Ye Zhuo to the Li family. ”

That Little B * Tch ye Zhuo deserved to be married to the Li family’s patriarch.

She deserved to be tortured to death by the Li family’s patriarch!

“Thinking of this, a vicious light appeared in Zhao Shuning’s eyes. He turned his head to look at Feng Qianhua, “What’s wrong with the Li family’s patriarch? The Li family is very powerful in the capital. Once ye Zhuo marries, she’ll become the Patriarch’s wife. It’s her fortune to be married to the Li family. How could she not be willing?” ”

“Feng Qianhua curved her lips without leaving a trace. “Although that’s what I said, Shu Ning, you shouldn’t be too rash. Think Before You Act.” ”

“Zhao shuning nodded. “Don’t worry, I know.” ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “As long as you think it through.” ”

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu walked over from opposite sides. ”

“The two of them were chatting and laughing. Although they couldn’t hear the content of their conversation clearly, they could tell from their expressions that they were definitely having a very happy conversation. ”

“Feng Qianhua’s expression darkened, but it quickly returned to normal. She walked up with a smile. “Brother Jincheng, Sister Ye Shu.” ”

Ye Shu smiled politely at Feng Qianhua.

“Lin Jincheng raised his head and looked at Feng Qianhua, his eyes filled with scrutiny, “Qianhua, my mother has watched you grow up since you were young. It’s natural for you to call me brother. However, shouldn’t you call Ah Shu sister-in-law while calling me brother?” ”

“As he said this, Lin Jincheng placed his hand on ye Shu’s shoulder. ”

This scene deeply pierced Feng Qianhua’s heart.

Sister-in-law?

Let Her Call Ye Shu sister-in-law?

“What qualifications did ye Shu, the mistress, have? ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Shu, the person standing by Lin Jincheng’s side would be her. ”

What qualifications did ye Shu have to strut around Lin Jincheng?

Shameless!

She was simply Shameless.

“Feng Qianhua’s face was a little stiff, and her heart was filled with mixed feelings. She held her breath in front of her chest, neither up nor down, but she had no choice but to pretend as if nothing had happened. ”

“”Brother Jincheng, you’re right. I was indeed careless in addressing you.”After saying that, Feng Qianhua turned to look at Ye Shu, “Sister-in-law, I grew up with brother Jincheng since young, and we have always been close. You’re a magnanimous person, so don’t lower yourself to my level.” ”

Feng Qianhua’s words were very artistic.

“Firstly, she was showing off that she had known Lin Jin Cheng Longer Than Ye Shu. ”

“Secondly, she was provoking ye Shu. ”

As long as ye Shu showed the slightest bit of unhappiness.

Then Ye Shu was a petty person.

“Ye Shu could hear the hidden meaning in Feng Qianhua’s words. She raised her head and looked at Feng Qianhua. With a smile on her lips, she directly countered, “Nineteen years ago, when you were pregnant and pretending to be brother Jin Cheng’s fiancée, I didn’t even bother with you. Now, it’s just a form of address. How could I lower myself to your level?” ”

Feng Qianhua didn’t expect ye Shu to suddenly bring up the old matter again.

She also didn’t expect ye Shu to bring this matter up on the table.

“In front of Lin Jin Cheng, Feng Qianhua was extremely embarrassed. Her face alternated between red and white, and she wished she could find a hole to hide in. ”

Even though she had always claimed to be Lin Jincheng’s fiancée.

“For so many years, she had even deceived herself. ”

“However, she had to admit that. ”

She had never been engaged to Lin Jincheng.

“However, if ye Shu did not appear between them, then she would definitely become Lin Jincheng’s fiancée and wife. ”

Giving birth to children for Lin Jincheng!

“Ye Shu, this slut who interfered in other people’s feelings, what right did she have to humiliate herself? ”
