“”Okay, then thank you, Young Lady. Remember to inform me,”mother he said. ”

“”I will, don’t worry.”The assistant continued, “Oh right, Mrs. He, my name is Shen Jie. You Can Just Call Me Little Shen! Worker he is so good, he will definitely be fine. Don’t Worry!” ”

“Hearing the assistant’s comforting voice, mother he felt a little better. “Xiao Shen, thank you.” ”

“”Mrs. He, you’re too kind.” ”

“After hanging up, father he immediately asked, “How was it? What did Miss Ye Say?” ”

Mother he shook her head.

“What happened?”Father he asked.

“Mother he continued, “Miss Ye is doing experiments on Mars. I Can’t contact her for the time being.” ”

“Hearing that, father he fell back into the chair behind him with a defeated look on his face. ”

“How could this be?”

Was the heavens trying to destroy the he family?

...

On the other side.

“When the Xu family’s parents received the call, they were ecstatic. ”

Pregnant!

Xu Yao was actually pregnant.

They had always dreamed of getting Xu Yao pregnant. Who would have thought that happiness would come so suddenly.

“”Old Xu, pinch me. Let’s see if I’m Dreaming!”Mother Xu looked at Father Xu. ”

Father Xu reached out and pinched mother Xu’s arm.

Hiss!

It hurt!

Mother Xu immediately pulled her arm back and looked at father Xu with a smile. “It hurts! Old Xu! It’s Not a dream! It’s really not a dream! Our Yaoyao is pregnant!”

Father Xu was also very happy. He hugged mother Xu and cheered. “That’s great! Yaoyao is pregnant!”

“If Xu Yao successfully got pregnant with he ziteng’s child, it meant that she had stepped into the he family’s door. ”

“In the future, the Xu family would also prosper. ”

“Thinking of this, the couple was very excited. ”

“Father Xu calmed himself down. He looked at mother Xu and said, “Let’s quickly pack up and go to the hospital. Didn’t they say that Yaoyao is in the hospital taking care of the baby and that Xu Yao will be taken care of?” ”

“At such a critical moment, they couldn’t let Xu Yao get away with anything. ”

“Mother Xu nodded. “Yes, yes, yes. Let’s hurry to the hospital! Oh, wait a moment. I’ll go to the kitchen to make some chicken soup to nourish yaoyao!” ”

“”I’ll go to the kitchen. You Go pack up the things,”father Xu said. ”

“That works too.”

The two of them split up. One went to the kitchen while the other went upstairs to the bedroom.

“Before long, everything was ready and they arrived at the hospital. ”

Xu Yao was lying on the hospital bed. Her face was pale and her expression was sorrowful. There was even a bandage wrapped around her forehead.

“The He family only said on the phone that they would come to take care of Xu Yao, but they did not say that Xu Yao was injured. Seeing Xu Yao like this, the couple’s expression changed and they immediately walked to Xu Yao’s side, “Yaoyao, are you alright? What happened to your head? And your face! Who Hit You? Was it he ziteng?” ”

Xu Yao was pregnant and was pregnant with the He family’s bloodline. How could he ziteng hit her!

“When he ziteng was mentioned, Xu Yao instantly burst into tears. ”

“Seeing that she was crying so hard, the Xu family’s parents became even more nervous. “Yaoyao, what happened? Did He Ziteng Bully You? Does he know that you’re Pregnant?” ”

What happened to He Ziteng Now?

Could it be that he didn’t want to have a child anymore? !

“Xu Yao cried as she said, “Ziteng, ziteng, he, he got into a car accident! Father and mother, it’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have been so pretentious and wanted to drink milk tea... ... It’s all my fault... ... If I didn’t drink milk tea, Ziteng wouldn’t have gotten into an accident!” ”

“Hearing this, the Xu parents finally understood the ins and outs of the matter. ”

So something had happened to he ziteng!

He ziteng’s life and death were currently unknown. The only thing in Xu Yao’s stomach was the he family’s only bloodline.

“This way, Xu Yao would become the living ancestor of the Xu family. ”

Mother Xu looked at Father Xu. “Go Stand Guard outside the door. I want to say a few words to Yaoyao.”

“Okay.”Father Xu went outside and closed the door.

“In the blink of an eye, only mother Xu and Xu Yao were left in the ward. ”

“Mother Xu looked at Xu Yao. “Okay, Don’t Cry Anymore!” ”

Xu Yao picked up a tissue to wipe her tears.

“Mother Xu continued, “Now that he ziteng is free, tell me, what do you think?” ”

“Xu Yao looked up at her mother and smiled. “Of course, give birth to the child and inherit the he family’s property!” ”

“Once he ziteng died, the child in her stomach would be the only heir. ”

“Other than giving the he family’s assets to the mother and son, who else could they give it to? ”

“Mother Xu nodded and continued, “However, we are still lacking something. Let me ask you, were the injuries on your head and face caused by the he family?” ”

“Yes.”Xu Yao reached out and touched her face. “It’s all because of that old B * Tch Ouyang Xunfang!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Mother Xu narrowed her eyes and waved at Xu Yao.

Xu Yao immediately leaned over.

“Mother Xu whispered in Xu Yao’s ear and then said, “What do you think?” ”

“”Okay.”Xu Yao nodded. “Mom, we’ll do as you say.” ”

It had to be said that the older the wiser.

It was hard not to admire mother Xu’s strategy.

“After a while, mother Xu walked over and opened the door. She said in a low voice, “Has anyone come?” ”

“No.”Father Xu shook his head.

Mother Xu looked at him. “Come with me for a moment.”

Father Xu followed his footsteps.

“Soon, the two of them appeared in he ziteng’s office. ”

“”Hello, we are he ziteng’s girlfriend’s parents. How is He Ziteng Now?” ”

“The attending physician shook his head. “He ziteng’s current condition is very bad. His body’s various indicators have been declining. It’s very likely that he won’t be able to survive tonight. Even if he can survive tonight, he will only be a vegetable in the future!” ”

“Vegetable?”Mother Xu looked at the attending doctor in surprise. “Are you kidding me?”

“”As a doctor, I also hope for a miracle.”Unfortunately, the matter was already settled. ”

“Mother Xu continued, “Then isn’t a vegetable a cripple?” ”

The doctor didn’t say anything.

“In fact, mother Xu was right. A vegetable was a cripple. ”

“”No! How can my daughter marry a useless person!”Mother Xu looked at Father Xu. “Let’s Go! Let’s Get Yaoyao out of this as soon as possible! She’s only two months old now, so it’s good for her to have an abortion. If it takes too long, it won’t be good for her to have an abortion!” ”

Father Xu followed mother Xu’s footsteps.

The two of them walked out of the door.

“Seeing that the situation didn’t seem right, the attending doctor immediately picked up the phone and contacted the he family’s parents. ”

“He ziteng had created such a huge incident. If Xu Yao aborted the child in her belly again, then the he family’s parents’spiritual support would completely collapse! ”

“Hearing this, the He family’s parents did not dare to delay and immediately rushed to Xu Yao’s ward. ”

“As soon as they arrived at the ward, they saw the Xu family’s parents dragging Xu Yao out. ”

“”The Doctor has already said that even if he ziteng survives, he will only become a vegetable in the future! You wretched girl, are you stupid? Hurry up and follow us to complete the procedures. We absolutely can not have this child!” ”

Xu Yao knelt on the ground and begged bitterly:

“”Mother, I beg you, please let me keep this child! Something has happened to ziteng. This child is the only blood that he has left! I want to give birth to him and raise him well!” ”

“Xu Yao’s mother said angrily, “Xu Yao, I think you’re Crazy! You’re an unmarried girl. You’re giving birth to someone else’s child. You’re Shameless. Your father and I are Shameless! “Get up, get up quickly! “Come with me for an abortion. I’m telling you, I’m doing this for your own good. I don’t want you to regret it in the future!” ”

“”Mom, I won’t regret it. I really won’t regret it! I want to give birth to this child for Ziteng! Mom, I’m begging you. Dad, Dad, can you help me persuade Mom?”At the end of her sentence, Xu Yao turned her head to look at her father. ”

The three of them cooperated very well. It was impossible to tell who was acting.

They were born to be actors!

“Father Xu sighed and said earnestly, “Yaoyao, your mom is really doing this for your own good! Do you know how difficult it is to be a single mother? You are still young. After all, your mom has been through it before! Just listen to your mom. Don’t be so stubborn!” ”

“Seeing this scene, the he family’s parents immediately walked in, “Mr. and Mrs. Xu, don’t worry. As long as Xu Yao gives birth to the child, we will not mistreat her!”! “If she is willing, we can hold a wedding for her and ziteng. If she is not willing, we can take her as our goddaughter. In the future, she will be our biological daughter!” ”

“When she saw the he family’s parents walking over, Xu Yao immediately stood behind the He family’s parents. “Uncle and aunt!” ”

“At this moment, mother he couldn’t care less. She firmly protected Xu Yao behind her. “Don’t worry. As long as your uncle and I are here, no one can force you!” ”

“Xu Yao nodded, and a glint flashed in her eyes. ”

Mother’s trick of hiding the truth was really effective.

“Mother he had originally been wary of her. Now, all she had left for her was gratitude! ”

Mother Xu placed her hands on her hips and looked at Xu Yao. “Xu Yao! I’m going to ask you one last time. Are you going to have an abortion or not?”

“Xu Yao shook her head as she cried. “Mom, I really can’t do this. Please forgive me!” ”
